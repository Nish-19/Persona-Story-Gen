        "story": "Every morning, Will Solace woke up next to Nico di Angelo, the love of his life. The first rays of the sun filtered through the curtains, casting a golden hue over Nico's peaceful face. Will couldn't help but smile. He pressed a soft kiss to Nico's forehead, careful not to wake him just yet. \n\n\"Morning, sunshine,\" Nico murmured, eyes fluttering open. \n\n\"Morning, death boy,\" Will teased, earning a playful swat from Nico. \n\nTheir mornings were always filled with laughter, kisses, and the occasional battle to get out of bed. Will would try to drag Nico out from under the covers, and Nico would stubbornly cling to the warmth, pulling Will back into a tangle of limbs and blankets. \n\n\"Come on, Nico, we have training today,\" Will reminded, though his heart wasn't really in it. He loved these lazy mornings with Nico more than anything.\n\n\"Five more minutes,\" Nico pleaded, wrapping his arms around Will's waist and burying his face in Will's chest. \n\nWill chuckled, running his fingers through Nico's tousled hair. \"Fine, but only five.\"\n\nThey stayed like that for a moment, basking in the comfort of each other's presence. Will was about to suggest breakfast when Nico looked up at him with a serious expression.\n\n\"Will, I've been thinking,\" Nico started, his voice hesitant.\n\n\"Uh-oh, should I be worried?\" Will joked, but Nico's solemn gaze told him this was no laughing matter. \n\n\"No, really. I\u2019ve been thinking about us. About the future,\" Nico continued, his voice barely above a whisper. \"What if we changed things up a bit?\"\n\nWill's heart skipped a beat. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nNico took a deep breath, his eyes searching Will's for reassurance. \"I want to travel. Together. See the world. We've been through so much, and I think we deserve a break from all the fighting and chaos. Just us, exploring new places, making new memories.\"\n\nWill was stunned. It was so unlike Nico to suggest something so spontaneous, so adventurous. But the more he thought about it, the more he realized how much he loved the idea. \n\n\"You mean, like a road trip?\" Will asked, excitement bubbling up inside him.\n\n\"Yeah, something like that,\" Nico replied, a small smile tugging at his lips. \"We could visit all the places we've always wanted to see. No monsters, no quests. Just us.\"\n\nWill's mind raced with possibilities. The thought of waking up to new landscapes, experiencing different cultures, and having Nico by his side through it all was intoxicating. \n\n\"I love it,\" Will said, pulling Nico into a tight embrace. \"Let's do it.\"\n\nNico's smile widened, and for the first time in a long time, Will saw a glimmer of hope and excitement in his eyes. \n\n\"Really? You're okay with it?\" Nico asked, his voice laced with disbelief.\n\n\"More than okay. I can't think of anything I'd rather do,\" Will assured him, pressing a kiss to Nico's lips. \n\nThey spent the rest of the morning planning their adventure, mapping out destinations and dreaming about the experiences they would share. \n\nAs the sun climbed higher in the sky, they finally got out of bed, ready to face the world together. Their routine had changed forever, but it felt right. They were no longer just surviving; they were living. And they were doing it together.\n\nWill couldn't help but feel grateful for the suggestion that had sparked this new chapter in their lives. Every morning would still begin with laughter, kisses, and the occasional battle to get out of bed, but now, they had the promise of endless adventures ahead."

        "writing_prompt": "Your partner insists you can look through their phone anytime, but when you do, you discover a collection of candid photos of yourself\u2014each one capturing a moment you didn\u2019t even realize was special.",
        "story": "Percy\u2019s fingers trembled slightly as he unlocked Nico\u2019s phone. It wasn't that he didn\u2019t trust his boyfriend, but curiosity had gotten the better of him. Nico had always been a mystery, and Percy, well, he was a demigod who couldn't resist a good puzzle.\n\nNico had been so nonchalant when he handed over his phone earlier. \"Go ahead, Percy. There's nothing on there I wouldn't show you.\" His dark eyes had sparkled with a hint of mischief, and Percy had taken it as a challenge.\n\nAs he scrolled through the usual apps, Percy stumbled upon the gallery. He hesitated for a moment, then tapped on it. The first few photos were typical\u2014selfies, pictures of their friends at Camp Half-Blood, and a few shots of the Underworld that Nico had taken when he was feeling particularly nostalgic.\n\nThen Percy found a folder labeled \"Percy.\"\n\nHis heart skipped a beat as he opened it. Inside were dozens of photos, all of him. But these weren\u2019t the kind of photos he was used to seeing. There was one of him laughing with Annabeth at a campfire, his head thrown back in pure joy. Another showed him sleeping, curled up in Nico\u2019s lap on a sunny afternoon, a soft smile on his lips.\n\nEach photo captured him in moments of vulnerability, happiness, or quiet reflection. Moments he hadn\u2019t even realized were special until now. Percy felt a lump form in his throat as he continued to swipe through the images. He saw himself looking out over the ocean, the wind tousling his hair, and another of him reading a book, completely absorbed in the story.\n\nOne particular photo caught his eye. It was of him and Nico, taken from behind. They were sitting on the beach, shoulders touching, the setting sun casting a golden glow around them. Percy remembered that evening; they had talked for hours, sharing secrets and dreams they hadn\u2019t dared to voice before.\n\nNico had captured not just a moment, but an essence\u2014a piece of their shared lives that Percy hadn\u2019t fully appreciated until now. He felt a wave of emotion wash over him, a mixture of love, gratitude, and a bit of embarrassment for snooping in the first place.\n\n\u201cHey, find anything interesting?\u201d Nico\u2019s voice broke through Percy\u2019s reverie.\n\nPercy looked up to see Nico leaning against the doorframe, a knowing smile playing on his lips. His dark hair fell over his eyes, and Percy\u2019s heart did that annoying fluttery thing it always did when Nico was around.\n\n\u201cNico, I\u2014\u201d Percy started, but the words seemed to stick in his throat. He held up the phone instead, showing Nico the open gallery.\n\nNico\u2019s smile softened. \u201cI guess you found my little secret,\u201d he said, walking over to sit beside Percy. \u201cI wanted to remember all the moments that made me fall in love with you.\u201d\n\nPercy\u2019s eyes welled up with tears. \u201cI didn\u2019t even realize...\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d Nico interrupted gently, taking Percy\u2019s hand in his. \u201cYou don\u2019t see how amazing you are, Percy. But I do. And I wanted to capture that, for both of us.\u201d\n\nPercy leaned in, resting his forehead against Nico\u2019s. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cFor seeing me. For loving me.\u201d\n\nNico\u2019s hand came up to cup Percy\u2019s cheek. \u201cAlways,\u201d he murmured, sealing the promise with a kiss.\n\nAs they sat there, wrapped in each other\u2019s presence, Percy realized that the moments Nico had captured were indeed special. They were the foundation of their relationship, each photo a testament to the love they shared. And in that quiet, stolen moment, Percy promised himself he would treasure every single one."

        "story": "Percy stared at the array of makeup brushes, palettes, and tubes sprawled across the vanity with a mix of apprehension and curiosity. He shifted uncomfortably in the chair, his sea-green eyes flicking up to meet Nico's dark, mischievous gaze in the mirror.\n\n\"Nico, I don't know about this,\" Percy muttered, his fingers drumming nervously on the armrest. \"I mean, I've faced monsters and gods, but this...?\"\n\nNico grinned, a rare lightness in his expression that made Percy's heart do a little flip. \"Relax, Seaweed Brain. It's just makeup. Besides, you promised.\"\n\nPercy sighed, knowing he was cornered. \"Yeah, yeah. But you didn't tell me you'd be filming it!\"\n\n\"Details, details,\" Nico replied with a wink, adjusting the camera on its tripod. \"Think of it as a new kind of quest. The quest for fabulousness.\"\n\nPercy rolled his eyes but couldn't help the smile tugging at his lips. \"Alright, Death Boy. Do your worst.\"\n\nAs Nico began his work, brushing foundation onto Percy's skin with surprisingly gentle strokes, Percy tried to relax. He watched Nico's concentrated expression, the way his brow furrowed in adorable focus, and felt a warm affection bloom in his chest. This was Nico's world, and he was happy to be a part of it, even if it meant being a human canvas.\n\n\"Okay,\" Nico said after a while, stepping back to admire his handiwork. \"Close your eyes. This next part's a surprise.\"\n\n\"Why do I feel like I'm about to regret this?\" Percy muttered, but he obediently closed his eyes.\n\nNico's fingers were deft and sure as they applied some kind of product to Percy's eyelids. There was a faint, pleasant scent of vanilla and something else Percy couldn't quite place. He felt the soft brushstrokes, the light patting, and then, finally, Nico's satisfied hum.\n\n\"And...done!\" Nico announced, a hint of excitement in his voice. \"Open your eyes, Percy.\"\n\nPercy opened his eyes and stared at his reflection. He blinked once, then twice, his mouth falling open in shock. Nico had transformed him into...a glittering sea nymph?\n\nHis skin shimmered with an ethereal glow, his eyelids adorned with shades of ocean blue and green, flecks of gold sparkling like sunlight on water. His lips were a soft coral pink, and tiny starfish decals were artfully placed along his cheekbones. It was absurdly beautiful and completely unexpected.\n\n\"Nico, I look like a\u2014\"\n\n\"\u2014sea nymph, I know,\" Nico finished, grinning from ear to ear. \"It's perfect, right? I mean, you are the son of Poseidon, after all.\"\n\nPercy couldn't help but laugh, the sound bubbling up from deep within him. \"You really got me, Nico. I never saw this coming.\"\n\nNico's grin softened into something more tender. \"You look amazing, Percy. And hey, maybe this will be our new thing. Makeup transformations and monster-slaying. The ultimate power couple.\"\n\nPercy's heart swelled with affection. \"As long as I'm with you, I'm up for anything.\"\n\nNico leaned in, their foreheads touching. \"Good. Because I've got a whole list of looks I want to try on you.\"\n\nPercy chuckled, pressing a kiss to Nico's lips. \"Bring it on, Death Boy. Bring it on.\"\n\nAs the camera continued to roll, capturing their laughter and love, Percy realized that sometimes the most unexpected transformations were the ones that mattered the most."

        "story": "Nico di Angelo never expected the Labyrinth to be boring. Dangerous, yes. Confusing, definitely. But today, after hours of wandering aimlessly through its ever-changing corridors, he found himself craving a good monster attack. Anything to break the monotony.\n\nHe turned a corner and stopped in his tracks. There, in front of him, stood a boy around his age, with curly hair and freckles, looking just as lost as Nico felt. The boy's clothes were strange\u2014too modern, even for Camp Half-Blood standards.\n\n\"Uh, hi?\" the boy said, his voice an odd mixture of nervousness and relief. \"You're Nico, right?\"\n\nNico's eyes narrowed. \"Who are you? And how do you know my name?\"\n\nThe boy took a cautious step forward, raising his hands in a gesture of peace. \"My name's Will. Will Solace. I'm... well, I'm from the future.\"\n\nNico blinked. Time travel wasn't exactly a common occurrence, even in the world of Greek demigods. \"The future?\" he repeated, skepticism heavy in his voice. \"Prove it.\"\n\nWill hesitated, then pulled out a small, rectangular device from his pocket. Nico recognized it as a smartphone\u2014he had seen a few at camp, though they were usually forbidden. Will tapped the screen, and an image of the two of them appeared. They were older, standing close together, smiling.\n\nNico's heart skipped a beat. \"That could be fake,\" he said, though his voice lacked conviction.\n\n\"It's not,\" Will insisted. \"Look, I know this is a lot to take in. But I'm here for a reason. You're in danger, Nico. We both are.\"\n\nNico's mind raced. He had faced countless threats before, but this felt different. \"What kind of danger?\"\n\n\"There's a creature in the Labyrinth,\" Will explained, his expression grim. \"A monster that feeds on time. It's been pulling people from different eras into the Labyrinth, trying to gather enough power to break free.\"\n\nNico frowned. \"And why should I trust you?\"\n\nWill's eyes softened. \"Because I care about you, Nico. In the future, we're... well, we're together.\"\n\nNico felt a strange mix of emotions\u2014confusion, curiosity, and something he couldn't quite name. \"Together?\" he echoed, incredulously. \"Like, dating?\"\n\nWill nodded, his cheeks turning a faint shade of pink. \"Yeah. Dating. And more than that, we're partners. We fight side by side, protect each other.\"\n\nNico's heart pounded. He had always felt like an outsider, someone destined to be alone. The idea of having someone by his side, someone who cared about him\u2014that was something he had never allowed himself to hope for.\n\nBefore he could respond, the ground beneath them shook violently. The walls of the Labyrinth shifted, and a low, menacing growl echoed through the corridors.\n\n\"We need to move,\" Will said urgently, grabbing Nico's hand. \"It's getting closer.\"\n\nNico didn't resist. Together, they ran through the twisting passages, their footsteps echoing in the dim light. As they turned another corner, the growling grew louder, and a massive shadow loomed ahead of them.\n\n\"It's here,\" Will whispered, his grip tightening on Nico's hand.\n\nThe creature stepped into the light\u2014a monstrous, serpentine figure with eyes that glowed like burning coals. It hissed, and the air seemed to shimmer around it, distorting time and space.\n\nNico drew his sword, shadows curling around him like a protective cloak. \"Stay back,\" he told Will, his voice steady despite the fear gnawing at him.\n\nWill pulled out a celestial bronze dagger. \"I'm not leaving you. We're in this together.\"\n\nNico glanced at him, a surge of warmth filling his chest. \"Alright,\" he said, a small smile tugging at his lips. \"Together.\"\n\nThey faced the creature, side by side, ready to fight. The battle was fierce, but with every strike, they moved in perfect sync, as if they had been fighting together for years. Nico could feel the bond between them growing stronger, a promise of what was to come.\n\nAs the creature finally fell, disintegrating into dust, Nico turned to Will, breathing heavily. \"So... the future, huh?\"\n\nWill smiled, his eyes bright with hope. \"Yeah. And trust me, it's worth fighting for.\"\n\nNico nodded, feeling a spark of something new and wonderful ignite within him. For the first time, he allowed himself to believe in a future where he wasn't alone\u2014a future with Will by his side."

        "writing_prompt": "After surviving the horrors of Tartarus, Will and Nico have developed quiet rituals to soothe their lingering fears. One sleepless night, they find themselves dancing in the kitchen, holding each other close as the weight of their shared past fades into the rhythm of the present.",
        "story": "The kitchen was dark save for the faint glow of the moonlight filtering through the window. Nico di Angelo leaned against the counter, the cool surface grounding him as he tried to shake off the remnants of another nightmare. Tartarus had left scars that no amount of time could fully heal, but here, in the quiet of the night, he found solace in the small rituals he and Will Solace had developed.\n\nWill appeared in the doorway, his blond hair tousled from sleep and a concerned furrow etched on his brow. He didn\u2019t need to ask; the haunted look in Nico\u2019s eyes spoke volumes. Without a word, he crossed the room and wrapped his arms around Nico, pulling him into a tight embrace.\n\n\u201cAnother one?\u201d Will murmured, his breath warm against Nico\u2019s ear.\n\nNico nodded, burying his face in Will\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYeah. Couldn\u2019t shake it.\u201d\n\nWill pressed a kiss to the top of Nico\u2019s head, his fingers tracing soothing patterns on his back. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s do something about that.\u201d\n\nHe led Nico to the center of the kitchen, where the tiled floor was cool under their bare feet. Reaching over to the small radio on the counter, Will turned the dial until soft music filled the room. The gentle melody was a stark contrast to the horrors they had faced, a reminder that there was beauty and peace to be found, even after everything.\n\nWill held out his hand, a playful smile tugging at his lips. \u201cMay I have this dance?\u201d\n\nNico couldn\u2019t help but smile back, taking Will\u2019s hand and stepping into his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re such a dork,\u201d he teased, though his voice was soft, affectionate.\n\n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m your dork,\u201d Will replied, pulling Nico closer. They swayed to the music, their movements slow and deliberate, a dance born of necessity rather than skill. It was a ritual they had stumbled upon one sleepless night, a way to remind themselves that they were alive, that they had each other.\n\nAs they danced, Nico felt the tension in his muscles slowly unwind. Will\u2019s presence was a balm, his touch gentle yet grounding. They didn\u2019t need words; the silence between them was filled with understanding, a shared history that bound them together.\n\nThe song changed, and Nico rested his head against Will\u2019s chest, listening to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat. It was a sound that had become his anchor, a reminder that there was something worth fighting for, something worth living for.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Will whispered, as if reading Nico\u2019s thoughts. \u201cWe\u2019re here, and we\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d\n\nNico nodded, tightening his grip on Will. \u201cI know. It\u2019s just\u2026some nights it\u2019s harder to remember that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get it,\u201d Will said softly. \u201cBut you\u2019re not alone, Nico. You\u2019ve got me, and I\u2019ve got you. We\u2019ll get through this together.\u201d\n\nThey continued to dance, the music blending with the quiet hum of the night. The kitchen, once a place of mere sustenance, had become their sanctuary, a space where they could find comfort in each other\u2019s arms.\n\nAs the last notes of the song faded, Nico lifted his head and looked into Will\u2019s eyes. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said simply, the weight of his gratitude evident in his voice.\n\nWill cupped Nico\u2019s face in his hands, his thumbs brushing away the lingering traces of fear. \u201cAlways,\u201d he replied, sealing his promise with a gentle kiss.\n\nIn that moment, the nightmares seemed a little less daunting, the darkness a little less suffocating. Together, they could face anything. And as they stood there, holding each other close, the weight of their shared past faded into the rhythm of the present, a dance of hope and healing."
