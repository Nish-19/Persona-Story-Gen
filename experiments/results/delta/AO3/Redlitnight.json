        "writing_prompt": "Every morning, Will Solace wakes up next to Nico di Angelo, the love of his life, and every morning begins with laughter, kisses, and the occasional battle to get out of bed\u2014until one day, Nico suggests something that changes their routine forever.",
        "story": "The sun peeked through the curtains, casting a soft golden glow over the room. Will Solace stirred, feeling the warmth of the morning sun on his face. He turned over, smiling as he saw Nico di Angelo still asleep beside him. Their legs were tangled together, and Nico\u2019s dark hair splayed across the pillow like a halo.\n\nWill reached out, brushing a stray lock of hair from Nico\u2019s face. Nico\u2019s eyes fluttered open, and he groaned softly, burying his face in Will\u2019s chest. \u201cMorning,\u201d Will whispered, pressing a kiss to Nico\u2019s forehead.\n\nNico mumbled something unintelligible, causing Will to chuckle. He loved these mornings, the ones where they could afford to be lazy, wrapped up in each other and their shared warmth. \u201cCome on, we have to get up,\u201d Will said, although he made no move to untangle himself from Nico.\n\n\u201cFive more minutes,\u201d Nico murmured, his voice still heavy with sleep. He tightened his hold on Will, making it clear he had no intention of letting go. Will laughed, the sound bright and melodic in the quiet room.\n\n\u201cAlright, five more minutes,\u201d Will conceded, nuzzling into Nico\u2019s hair. They lay there in a comfortable silence, the only sound the soft rustling of the sheets and their steady breathing.\n\nEventually, Will sighed and tried to extricate himself from Nico\u2019s embrace. \u201cSeriously, we need to get up,\u201d he said, though the fond smile on his face betrayed his reluctance.\n\nNico finally opened his eyes fully, a mischievous glint in their dark depths. \u201cI have an idea,\u201d he said, his voice more awake now. Will raised an eyebrow, intrigued.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a day off,\u201d Nico suggested, a playful smile tugging at his lips. \u201cJust you and me. No responsibilities, no schedules. Just us.\u201d\n\nWill blinked in surprise. Nico was rarely the one to suggest deviating from their routine. He was the one who thrived on structure, on knowing what came next. But the idea of a day spent entirely together, without any interruptions, was incredibly appealing.\n\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Will asked, searching Nico\u2019s face for any sign of hesitation. But Nico\u2019s expression was earnest, hopeful even.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Nico said, his smile widening. \u201cWe deserve it.\u201d\n\nWill\u2019s heart swelled with affection. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s do it,\u201d he agreed, leaning in to capture Nico\u2019s lips in a kiss. It was slow and sweet, filled with the promise of the day ahead.\n\nThey spent the morning lounging in bed, talking and laughing about everything and nothing. Will made them breakfast in bed\u2014pancakes with an excessive amount of syrup, just the way Nico liked it. They ate slowly, savoring the food and each other\u2019s company.\n\nAfter breakfast, they decided to go for a walk in the park. The sun was high in the sky, and the air was crisp and fresh. They held hands as they strolled, talking about their hopes and dreams, their plans for the future.\n\nThe day passed in a blissful blur. They visited their favorite bookstore, had lunch at a cozy caf\u00e9, and spent the afternoon at the beach, watching the waves crash against the shore. As the sun began to set, they sat on the sand, wrapped in a blanket, and watched the sky turn shades of pink and orange.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you suggested this,\u201d Will said, resting his head on Nico\u2019s shoulder. Nico smiled, pressing a kiss to Will\u2019s temple.\n\n\u201cMe too,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWe should do this more often.\u201d\n\nWill nodded, feeling a sense of contentment wash over him. The day had brought them closer, reminded them of the simple joys of being together. And as they sat there, watching the sun dip below the horizon, they knew they would carry this memory with them, a testament to the strength of their love."

        "writing_prompt": "Your partner insists you can look through their phone anytime, but when you do, you discover a collection of candid photos of yourself\u2014each one capturing a moment you didn\u2019t even realize was special.",
        "story": "Nico di Angelo was sprawled on the couch, a book in hand and his head resting on Will Solace's lap. The warmth of Will's presence always had a calming effect on him, something he cherished deeply. The gentle hum of a song played from Will's phone, lying next to him on the couch.\n\n\"You know,\" Will said, absentmindedly playing with Nico's hair, \"you can look through my phone anytime, right? No secrets here.\"\n\nNico scoffed, rolling his eyes. \"Why would I want to do that? Your texts with your mom about what you had for lunch aren't that interesting.\"\n\nWill chuckled, shaking his head. \"There's more to my phone than that, you know.\"\n\nWith a sigh, Nico reached over and grabbed the phone, unlocking it with ease. He wasn't expecting much\u2014a few messages, maybe some silly memes. But as he scrolled through the gallery, he stopped short, his breath catching in his throat.\n\nThe first photo was of Nico, standing by the window of their living room, bathed in the golden light of the setting sun. He was lost in thought, a small, content smile playing on his lips. He didn't even remember Will taking that picture.\n\n\"Will,\" he murmured, unable to tear his eyes away from the image. \"When did you take this?\"\n\nWill glanced at the screen and smiled. \"A few weeks ago. You looked so peaceful, I couldn't resist.\"\n\nNico continued scrolling, each photo revealing a moment he hadn't even realized was special. There was one of him laughing, his head thrown back in pure joy, his eyes crinkled at the corners. He recognized the setting immediately\u2014the park where they often went for walks. Will must have taken it during one of their impromptu picnics.\n\nAnother photo showed Nico asleep on the couch, a book resting on his chest and his hair a wild mess. Will had captioned it with a heart emoji, and Nico felt a warmth spread through his chest.\n\n\"Why did you take all these?\" Nico asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nWill's fingers continued their gentle caress through Nico's hair. \"Because I wanted to capture all the little moments that make up our life together. The ones you don't always notice. I love seeing you happy, peaceful, just... being you.\"\n\nNico's heart swelled with emotion as he looked at the next photo. It was of him cooking breakfast, a rare smile on his face as he flipped pancakes. He remembered that morning\u2014how Will had teased him about his cooking skills and how they had ended up in a flour fight.\n\n\"These are beautiful,\" Nico said, his voice thick with emotion. \"I never knew you were taking them.\"\n\nWill leaned down, pressing a soft kiss to Nico's forehead. \"That's the point of candid photos, love. They're meant to capture the genuine moments, the ones that mean the most.\"\n\nNico set the phone down and turned to face Will, his eyes glistening with unshed tears. \"Thank you,\" he whispered, his voice cracking. \"For seeing me, for loving me.\"\n\nWill's eyes softened, and he cupped Nico's cheek in his hand. \"Always,\" he replied, his voice filled with sincerity. \"I love you, Nico. Every moment with you is special to me.\"\n\nNico leaned into Will's touch, feeling the depth of his partner's love in that simple gesture. \"I love you too, Will,\" he said, his voice steady and sure.\n\nThey sat in comfortable silence, the weight of the day melting away in the warmth of their love. And as Nico closed his eyes, he knew that every moment, no matter how small, was a treasure when shared with Will."

        "writing_prompt": "A mischievous makeup artist convinces their reluctant partner to star in a video, only to reveal a hilariously unexpected transformation\u2014what happens next?",
        "story": "\"Come on, Nico, it'll be fun,\" Will coaxed, fluttering his eyelashes in a deliberately exaggerated manner. He held up the makeup brush like a magic wand, twirling it with practiced ease. Nico crossed his arms, a skeptical eyebrow raised.\n\n\"Fun for you, maybe,\" Nico replied, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \"I don't exactly enjoy being your guinea pig.\"\n\nWill pouted, leaning in closer. \"But think of the viewers! They'll love it. Besides, I promise it won't be anything too crazy. Just a little transformation.\"\n\nNico sighed, running a hand through his dark hair. \"Fine. But if I end up looking like a clown, I'm never doing this again.\"\n\nWill's eyes sparkled with victory. \"Deal! Now sit down and let the magic happen.\"\n\nNico sat in the makeup chair, feeling a bit like a prisoner awaiting his fate. Will buzzed around him, gathering his tools and humming a cheerful tune. As Will began applying primer, Nico closed his eyes and tried to relax, despite the nagging feeling that his partner had something up his sleeve.\n\n\"Just trust me, okay?\" Will said softly, sensing Nico's tension. \"You're going to look amazing.\"\n\n\"Better,\" Nico muttered, though his tone was more playful than annoyed. Will chuckled and continued working, the sound of brushes and palettes filling the room.\n\nAs the transformation progressed, Will's mischievous grin grew wider. He added layers of foundation, concealer, and a myriad of other products, each swipe and dab bringing Nico closer to the grand reveal. Nico remained still, his curiosity piqued despite himself.\n\n\"Almost done,\" Will announced, adding the finishing touches. \"Ready to see the new you?\"\n\nNico opened his eyes and stared at his reflection. His jaw dropped. Staring back at him was not the familiar face he expected but a striking, otherworldly creature. Will had transformed him into a glamorous version of Hades, complete with smoky eyes, sharp cheekbones, and a touch of ethereal glow.\n\n\"Holy Styx,\" Nico breathed, unable to tear his gaze away. \"I look... incredible.\"\n\nWill beamed, clapping his hands together. \"I knew you'd love it! Now, let's get the camera rolling.\"\n\nThe video began with Will introducing Nico, who gave a half-hearted wave, still in awe of his transformation. As Will walked viewers through the process, Nico couldn't help but admire the artistry. He looked both regal and intimidating\u2014a perfect embodiment of the Underworld's ruler.\n\n\"And now, for the best part,\" Will said, grinning at the camera. \"Let's see how Nico reacts to the final surprise.\"\n\nNico's eyes widened. \"Surprise? What surprise?\"\n\nWill reached behind the chair and pulled out a prop\u2014a glittering crown adorned with tiny skulls and dark gems. He placed it on Nico's head, adjusting it until it sat perfectly.\n\n\"There,\" Will said, stepping back to admire his work. \"Now you're the true King of the Underworld.\"\n\nNico burst out laughing, the sound echoing through the room. \"This is ridiculous,\" he said between chuckles, though his eyes shone with amusement. \"But I kind of love it.\"\n\nThe video ended with Nico striking various dramatic poses, the crown gleaming atop his head. Will joined in, the two of them hamming it up for the camera. As the camera clicked off, they collapsed into a fit of giggles.\n\n\"Okay, you win this round,\" Nico said, catching his breath. \"But don't think this means I'll be your model all the time.\"\n\nWill leaned in, kissing Nico's cheek. \"One step at a time, my love. One step at a time.\"\n\nNico smiled, a playful glint in his eye. \"Just wait until it's my turn to plan something. You're in for a surprise.\"\n\nWill laughed, wrapping an arm around Nico's shoulders. \"I can't wait.\""

        "writing_prompt": "While navigating the Labyrinth, Nico encounters a strange, freckled boy claiming to be from the future\u2014and his future boyfriend.",
        "story": "Nico di Angelo moved cautiously through the twisting corridors of the Labyrinth, his senses on high alert. The air was thick with the musty scent of ancient stone and the distant echo of dripping water. Shadows danced on the walls, cast by the flickering flame of his torch. He could feel the oppressive weight of the maze pressing in on him, each turn leading him deeper into the unknown.\n\nHis mission was simple: find Daedalus\u2019s workshop and retrieve the plans that could help the demigods navigate this treacherous maze. But the Labyrinth was anything but simple. It was a place where time and space twisted, where the past and future collided, and where danger lurked around every corner.\n\nNico rounded a bend and found himself in a dimly lit chamber. The walls were covered in ancient runes that seemed to pulse with a faint, eerie light. He took a cautious step forward, his eyes scanning for any sign of danger. That\u2019s when he saw him\u2014a boy, about his age, with a mop of curly hair and a face covered in freckles, sitting casually on a stone ledge as if he had been waiting for him.\n\nNico tensed, his hand instinctively reaching for his sword. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he demanded, his voice echoing off the walls.\n\nThe boy smiled, a mischievous glint in his eyes. \u201cRelax, Nico. I\u2019m not here to hurt you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d Nico\u2019s grip on his sword tightened.\n\nThe boy hopped down from the ledge and took a step closer. \u201cI know a lot of things about you. I\u2019m from the future.\u201d\n\nNico blinked, momentarily thrown off by the boy\u2019s casual declaration. \u201cThe future? Prove it.\u201d\n\nThe boy shrugged, his smile never faltering. \u201cAlright. You\u2019re Nico di Angelo, son of Hades. You\u2019ve been through a lot\u2014Tartarus, the Titan War, the Giant War. But you\u2019ve also got a future ahead of you, a future with me.\u201d\n\nNico\u2019s heart skipped a beat. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\nThe boy took another step closer, his expression softening. \u201cI\u2019m Will Solace. In the future, we\u2019re together. Boyfriends, actually.\u201d\n\nNico stared at him, his mind racing. The idea seemed impossible, yet there was something about Will that felt\u2026 familiar. \u201cYou expect me to believe that?\u201d\n\nWill chuckled. \u201cI knew you\u2019d be skeptical. But I can prove it. You\u2019ve got a scar on your left shoulder from when you fought the drakon in New York. You hate olives but love blue chocolate chip cookies. And you have this little habit of tapping your fingers when you\u2019re nervous.\u201d\n\nNico\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cHow do you know all that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you, I\u2019m from the future,\u201d Will said, his tone gentle. \u201cI came back to warn you. The Labyrinth is more dangerous than you think. There are things here that can change your destiny.\u201d\n\nNico frowned, uncertainty gnawing at him. \u201cWhy should I trust you?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I care about you,\u201d Will said simply. \u201cAnd because I know you. I know you\u2019re brave and strong, but you also have a habit of pushing people away. You don\u2019t have to do this alone, Nico.\u201d\n\nNico\u2019s heart ached at Will\u2019s words. He wanted to believe him, but the Labyrinth had taught him to be wary of illusions. \u201cIf you\u2019re really from the future, then what happens next?\u201d\n\nWill\u2019s eyes sparkled with a mix of hope and sadness. \u201cThat\u2019s up to you. But know this\u2014you\u2019re not alone. You never have to be alone again.\u201d\n\nNico took a deep breath, the weight of his isolation pressing down on him. Could he really trust this boy from the future? Could he open himself up to the possibility of a different destiny?\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Nico said finally, his voice barely above a whisper. \u201cI\u2019ll trust you. For now.\u201d\n\nWill\u2019s smile widened, and he reached out to take Nico\u2019s hand. \u201cThat\u2019s all I need.\u201d\n\nTogether, they turned to face the twisting corridors of the Labyrinth, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. For the first time in a long time, Nico felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, his future wasn\u2019t as dark as he had always believed."

        "writing_prompt": "After surviving the horrors of Tartarus, Will and Nico have developed quiet rituals to soothe their lingering fears. One sleepless night, they find themselves dancing in the kitchen, holding each other close as the weight of their shared past fades into the rhythm of the present.",
        "story": "The kitchen was quiet, bathed in the soft glow of the moonlight filtering through the curtains. The clock on the wall ticked softly, marking the passage of time in the otherwise still room. Will stood by the counter, his hands wrapped around a mug of chamomile tea, the warmth seeping into his fingers. The steam rose in gentle curls, carrying the soothing scent of the herbs to his nose. He took a deep breath, letting the calm wash over him.\n\nNico entered the kitchen silently, his bare feet making no sound on the cool tiles. He moved with the grace of a shadow, a habit formed from years of navigating dark places. His eyes, deep and haunted, met Will\u2019s, and a silent understanding passed between them. The horrors of Tartarus had left their mark on both of them, but they had found solace in each other\u2019s presence.\n\nWill set his mug down and walked over to Nico, pulling him into a gentle embrace. Nico\u2019s head rested against Will\u2019s chest, and he could hear the steady beat of his heart, a comforting rhythm that grounded him in the present. They stood like that for a while, letting the silence speak for them.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Nico murmured against Will\u2019s shirt, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\u201cMe neither,\u201d Will replied, his hand gently stroking Nico\u2019s hair. \u201cBut we\u2019re here now. Together.\u201d\n\nNico nodded, his arms tightening around Will\u2019s waist. They had developed quiet rituals to soothe their lingering fears\u2014small, intimate moments that brought them back from the edge. One of those rituals was dancing in the kitchen, a practice they had stumbled upon one sleepless night, much like this one.\n\nWill took a step back, his hand still holding Nico\u2019s. He reached over to the small radio on the counter and turned it on, the soft strains of a slow song filling the room. He led Nico to the center of the kitchen, their feet moving in sync with the music. They swayed together, the world outside fading away as the melody wrapped around them.\n\nNico\u2019s eyes closed as he rested his head on Will\u2019s shoulder, the music carrying him away from the darkness of his memories. Will\u2019s hand rested on the small of Nico\u2019s back, guiding him gently through the dance. Their movements were slow and deliberate, a silent conversation that spoke of love and healing.\n\nAs they danced, the weight of their shared past began to lift, replaced by the warmth of the present. The kitchen, once a place of quiet solitude, became a sanctuary of connection and comfort. Will hummed softly along with the music, his voice a soothing balm to Nico\u2019s frayed nerves.\n\nNico opened his eyes and looked up at Will, a small smile playing at the corners of his lips. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered, his voice filled with gratitude.\n\nWill leaned down and pressed a gentle kiss to Nico\u2019s forehead. \u201cAlways,\u201d he replied, his voice steady and reassuring.\n\nThey continued to dance, the music weaving a tapestry of peace around them. In that moment, the kitchen was their haven, a place where the past could not reach them. They held each other close, their hearts beating in time with the music, finding strength in their connection.\n\nAs the song came to an end, they slowed their movements, coming to a gentle stop. Will looked into Nico\u2019s eyes, his gaze filled with love and determination. \u201cWe\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he said softly.\n\nNico nodded, his heart swelling with the truth of Will\u2019s words. \u201cYes, we will.\u201d\n\nThey stood there, wrapped in each other\u2019s arms, the kitchen silent once more. The fears of Tartarus might never fully fade, but in the quiet moments of their shared rituals, they found the strength to face the night\u2014and each new day\u2014together."
