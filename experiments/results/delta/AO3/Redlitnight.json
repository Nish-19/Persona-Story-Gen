        "story": "Every morning was a symphony of sunlight and laughter in their shared little cabin at Camp Half-Blood. Will Solace would wake up first, his golden hair tousled like a halo, and he\u2019d lie there, basking in the warmth of Nico di Angelo beside him. Nico, still in the throes of sleep, would inevitably grumble and try to bury himself deeper into the covers, eliciting a chuckle from Will.\n\n\u201cMorning, sunshine,\u201d Will would whisper, pressing a kiss to Nico\u2019s temple. Nico would groan, eyes barely open, and mumble something incoherent.\n\n\u201cFive more minutes,\u201d Nico would plead, his voice muffled by the pillow. Will, being the morning person he was, would take this as an invitation to start a playful struggle, tugging at the blankets and peppering Nico with kisses until he gave in.\n\n\u201cAlright, alright! I\u2019m up!\u201d Nico would finally concede, laughter spilling from his lips as he swatted at Will. They\u2019d lie there for a moment longer, sharing quiet smiles and the occasional kiss, before starting their day.\n\nOne such morning, after the usual ritual of laughter and kisses, Nico lay back, staring at the wooden beams of their ceiling. Will noticed the contemplative look on his face and propped himself up on one elbow, concern knitting his brows.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, Neeks?\u201d Will asked, his thumb brushing softly against Nico\u2019s cheek.\n\nNico turned to him, a mischievous glint in his dark eyes. \u201cI was thinking... how about we do something different today?\u201d\n\nWill raised an eyebrow, intrigued. \u201cOh? Like what?\u201d\n\nNico bit his lip, a playful smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. \u201cHow about... we skip our usual training and go on an adventure instead?\u201d\n\nWill\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. Nico suggesting they deviate from their routine was unexpected, but the idea was undeniably exciting. \u201cAn adventure? What kind of adventure?\u201d\n\nNico\u2019s smile grew. \u201cA day trip to the Underworld.\u201d\n\nWill blinked, taken aback. \u201cThe Underworld? Are you serious?\u201d\n\nNico nodded, his expression earnest. \u201cYeah. I want to show you my world, the parts you haven\u2019t seen. Besides, it\u2019s been a while since I visited home.\u201d\n\nWill considered it for a moment. The Underworld wasn\u2019t exactly his idea of a relaxing day out, but the thought of experiencing it with Nico, seeing the place that shaped him, was undeniably appealing.\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Will said, a grin spreading across his face. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d\n\nNico\u2019s eyes sparkled with excitement, and he pulled Will into a kiss, their laughter mingling in the morning light. They quickly got dressed, packing a few essentials before setting out.\n\nThe journey to the Underworld was unlike anything Will had ever experienced. Nico guided him through the shadows, their hands tightly clasped together. When they arrived, Will was struck by the eerie beauty of the place. Nico led him through the Fields of Asphodel, the Elysian Fields, and even the palace of Hades.\n\nThroughout the day, Nico\u2019s demeanor was lighter, more at ease. Will watched as Nico pointed out landmarks, shared stories, and even introduced him to some of the spirits they encountered. The Underworld, once a place of fear and mystery, became a realm of wonder and connection.\n\nAs the day drew to a close, they returned to their cabin, exhausted but elated. Will pulled Nico into his arms, their foreheads touching.\n\n\u201cThank you for today,\u201d Will whispered. \u201cIt was amazing.\u201d\n\nNico smiled, his eyes softening. \u201cI\u2019m glad you enjoyed it. Maybe we should do this more often.\u201d\n\nWill nodded, pressing a tender kiss to Nico\u2019s lips. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d\n\nAnd so, their mornings continued with laughter and kisses, but now with the promise of new adventures, their love growing deeper with each passing day."

        "writing_prompt": "Your partner insists you can look through their phone anytime, but when you do, you discover a collection of candid photos of yourself\u2014each one capturing a moment you didn\u2019t even realize was special.",
        "story": "Percy Jackson was sprawled out on the couch, his head resting on Annabeth's lap as she read a book. The living room was cozy, with the gentle hum of the city outside their window. Percy felt content, his fingers tracing idle patterns on Annabeth's knee. It was one of those rare moments of peace, the kind that made the chaos of their lives feel worth it.\n\n\"Hey,\" Annabeth said, breaking the comfortable silence. \"I need to grab something from my office. Be right back.\" She placed her book on the coffee table and gently lifted Percy's head before standing up. As she walked away, she casually tossed her phone onto the couch beside him. \"Feel free to look through my phone if you want. No secrets here.\"\n\nPercy chuckled, rolling onto his side and picking up the phone. He knew Annabeth well enough to trust her implicitly, but the temptation to snoop a little was too good to pass up. He opened the photos app and started scrolling through the gallery, expecting to find pictures of architectural sketches, selfies with friends, and perhaps a few shots of their adventures.\n\nWhat he found instead took his breath away.\n\nThe first photo was of him, sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee, sunlight streaming through the window behind him. He looked lost in thought, a small smile playing on his lips. Percy didn't even remember Annabeth taking that picture.\n\nCurious, he continued scrolling. Each photo he found was a candid shot of himself, captured in moments he hadn't realized were significant. There was one of him reading a book by the fireplace, the warm light casting a golden glow on his face. Another showed him laughing with their friends at a campfire, his eyes sparkling with joy.\n\nPercy felt a lump forming in his throat as he continued to scroll. There was a picture of him napping on the beach, the waves gently lapping at the shore in the background. Another showed him helping a child at Camp Half-Blood with their archery stance, his expression patient and kind.\n\nEach photo told a story, revealing a side of himself that he rarely saw. He hadn't realized how much Annabeth cherished these quiet, unguarded moments. It was like seeing himself through her eyes, and the love and admiration in each image were palpable.\n\nAnnabeth returned to the living room, a stack of papers in her hand. She paused when she saw Percy staring at her phone, his expression a mix of wonder and emotion.\n\n\"Find anything interesting?\" she asked with a knowing smile.\n\nPercy looked up at her, his eyes brimming with tears. \"Annabeth, these photos... I didn't know you took these.\"\n\nShe set the papers down and sat beside him, taking the phone from his hands. \"I wanted to capture you as you are, Percy. Not the hero or the demigod, but the person I love. These moments mean everything to me.\"\n\nHe pulled her into a tight embrace, his heart swelling with affection. \"I had no idea,\" he whispered, his voice thick with emotion.\n\nAnnabeth kissed his forehead, her fingers gently brushing through his hair. \"You don't always see what I see, but that's okay. I wanted to show you how much you mean to me, how much I appreciate every little thing you do.\"\n\nPercy smiled, a tear slipping down his cheek. \"Thank you, Annabeth. For everything.\"\n\nThey sat together in silence, holding each other close, the weight of their love and the beauty of those captured moments settling around them like a warm, comforting blanket. In that cozy living room, they found a deeper understanding of each other, their bond growing stronger with every passing second."

        "writing_prompt": "A mischievous makeup artist convinces their reluctant partner to star in a video, only to reveal a hilariously unexpected transformation\u2014what happens next?",
        "story": "\"Please, Percy,\" Will pleaded, his blue eyes wide with excitement. \"It'll be fun! I promise!\"\n\nPercy Jackson crossed his arms, leaning against the kitchen counter with a skeptical expression. \"Will, you know I don't like being in front of the camera. Especially not for one of your makeup videos.\"\n\nWill Solace, renowned makeup artist and all-around mischief-maker, pouted dramatically. \"But Percy, my subscribers are dying to see you in one of my transformations! And besides, it's just for fun. I promise I won't make you look like a clown.\"\n\nPercy sighed, knowing he was fighting a losing battle. Will's enthusiasm was infectious, and Percy could never resist when Will turned on the charm. \"Alright, fine. But if I end up looking ridiculous, you're taking me out for the biggest blue ice cream sundae you can find.\"\n\nWill's face lit up with triumph. \"Deal! Now, come on, let's get started!\"\n\nHe led Percy to their cozy home studio, which was filled with an array of makeup products, brushes, and lighting equipment. Percy sat down in the chair, feeling a mix of nerves and anticipation. Will buzzed around him, setting up the camera and arranging his tools.\n\n\"Alright, folks,\" Will said, addressing the camera with a grin. \"Today, we have a very special guest\u2014my amazing boyfriend, Percy Jackson! He's agreed to let me work my magic on him, so let's get started!\"\n\nPercy gave a half-hearted wave to the camera, feeling a bit self-conscious. Will began by applying primer to Percy's face, chatting animatedly about the products he was using and their benefits. As he worked, Percy couldn't help but relax a little, enjoying the soothing sensation of the brushes on his skin.\n\n\"So, Percy,\" Will said with a mischievous glint in his eye, \"I've got a surprise for you. Instead of a regular makeup look, I'm going to transform you into a character from Greek mythology. Any guesses who?\"\n\nPercy raised an eyebrow. \"Uh, I don't know. Zeus?\"\n\nWill chuckled. \"Good guess, but no. You'll just have to wait and see!\"\n\nThe anticipation built as Will continued working, applying layers of foundation, contour, and eyeshadow. Percy tried to peek at his reflection in the mirror, but Will kept blocking his view, insisting that it had to be a surprise.\n\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity, Will stepped back with a satisfied smile. \"Alright, Percy. Are you ready to see the final result?\"\n\nPercy took a deep breath and nodded. Will spun the chair around to face the mirror, and Percy stared at his reflection in shock.\n\n\"Oh my gods,\" he exclaimed, bursting into laughter. \"I'm Medusa!\"\n\nWill had indeed transformed Percy into the infamous Gorgon, complete with green-tinted skin, dramatic snake-like eyeliner, and even a headpiece adorned with fake snakes. The effect was both stunning and hilarious.\n\n\"Will, you outdid yourself,\" Percy said between fits of laughter. \"I can't believe you turned me into Medusa!\"\n\nWill grinned, clearly pleased with himself. \"I told you it would be fun! And you look amazing, if I do say so myself.\"\n\nPercy shook his head, still chuckling. \"Alright, you win. This was definitely worth it. But you still owe me that ice cream sundae.\"\n\nWill pulled Percy into a hug, planting a kiss on his cheek. \"Deal. And who knows, maybe next time I'll turn you into Poseidon. Now that would be something to see!\"\n\nAs they laughed and joked, the camera captured every moment, immortalizing the playful and loving dynamic between them. And as for their audience, they were in for a treat\u2014one they wouldn't soon forget."

        "writing_prompt": "While navigating the Labyrinth, Nico encounters a strange, freckled boy claiming to be from the future\u2014and his future boyfriend.",
        "story": "The Labyrinth twisted and turned with every step Nico took, the walls alive, breathing with an ancient magic that seemed to mock him at every corner. His mission was clear: find Daedalus\u2019s workshop. But clarity was lost in this endless maze, each passage more confusing than the last. Shadows flickered in his peripheral vision, but he pressed on, determined.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, a voice called out, \"Hey, Nico!\"\n\nStartled, Nico turned to see a boy standing in a side passage. He seemed about Nico's age, with freckles splattered across his nose and cheeks like stars across the night sky. There was something oddly familiar about him, yet Nico was sure he'd never met this boy before.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Nico demanded, his hand instinctively reaching for his sword.\n\nThe boy held up his hands in a gesture of peace, a small, crooked smile on his lips. \"Easy there. My name's Will. Will Solace.\"\n\nNico frowned. \"I've never heard of you. How do you know my name?\"\n\nWill hesitated, his blue eyes flickering with uncertainty before he took a deep breath. \"This is going to sound crazy, but... I'm from the future. And, well, I'm your future boyfriend.\"\n\nNico blinked, utterly taken aback. He'd heard some wild claims in his time, but this one took the prize. \"You're joking, right?\"\n\nWill shook his head. \"I know it sounds insane. But it's true. In my time, we're together. And I know things about you that no one else does.\" His gaze softened as he took a step closer. \"Like how you still blame yourself for Bianca. Or how you feel like you don't belong anywhere.\"\n\nNico's breath caught in his throat. How could this stranger know such personal details? It was unnerving, but there was something in Will's eyes\u2014something genuine and warm\u2014that made Nico want to believe him.\n\n\"Prove it,\" Nico challenged, his voice hoarse. \"Prove you're from the future.\"\n\nWill nodded, as if he'd been expecting this. \"Alright. In two days, you'll meet a girl named Rachel Elizabeth Dare. She's going to lead you to Daedalus's workshop. And in a month, Percy Jackson will ask you to join his team for the final battle against Kronos.\"\n\nNico's eyes widened. How could Will possibly know that? He barely knew Rachel, and Percy hadn't mentioned anything about a final battle. \n\n\"Okay,\" Nico said slowly, still wary. \"Let's say I believe you. What are you doing here?\"\n\nWill's smile faded, replaced by a seriousness that made Nico's heart skip a beat. \"I came to warn you. There are things coming, Nico. Dark things. And you need to be prepared. But more than that, I came because I couldn't stand the thought of you being alone down here.\"\n\nNico felt a strange warmth spread through him at Will's words. It was a feeling he hadn't experienced in a long time\u2014comfort, hope, maybe even something like happiness. But he couldn't let himself get distracted. Not now.\n\n\"Fine,\" Nico said, trying to sound more confident than he felt. \"But I'm still keeping an eye on you.\"\n\nWill chuckled, the sound like music in the eerie silence of the Labyrinth. \"Fair enough. Just remember, I'm here to help.\"\n\nAs they moved through the twisting passages together, Nico couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to Will's story. The boy was too familiar, too comfortable in the Labyrinth's treacherous depths. And yet, despite his skepticism, Nico found himself trusting Will more with each step.\n\nFinally, after what felt like hours, they reached a large, ornate door. Will stopped, placing a hand on Nico's shoulder. \"This is it. Daedalus's workshop. But remember, Nico, this is just the beginning. There are still many challenges ahead.\"\n\nNico nodded, his heart pounding. \"I know. But with you here... maybe I won't have to face them alone.\"\n\nWill's smile was radiant, his freckles dancing in the dim light. \"Exactly. And no matter what happens, Nico, I'll always come back for you.\"\n\nAs they pushed open the door together, Nico couldn't help but feel that, for the first time in a long while, he wasn't alone. And maybe, just maybe, the future didn't seem so daunting after all."

        "writing_prompt": "After surviving the horrors of Tartarus, Will and Nico have developed quiet rituals to soothe their lingering fears. One sleepless night, they find themselves dancing in the kitchen, holding each other close as the weight of their shared past fades into the rhythm of the present.",
        "story": "The kitchen was bathed in the soft glow of moonlight, casting elongated shadows across the tiled floor. The house was silent save for the occasional creak of settling wood and the whispering rustle of the trees outside. Nico di Angelo stood by the counter, fingers wrapped around a steaming mug of chamomile tea, the warmth seeping into his bones and chasing away the chill of his memories. Will Solace moved quietly around him, his presence a comforting balm to Nico's frayed nerves.\n\nThe horrors of Tartarus were never far from their minds. Nightmares lurked in the shadows, ready to pounce the moment they closed their eyes. So they had developed rituals\u2014small, intimate acts that anchored them to the present and reminded them they were safe, alive, and together. Tonight, the ritual involved warm tea, gentle touches, and the soft hum of a familiar tune that Will began to sing under his breath.\n\nNico\u2019s eyes flicked up to Will\u2019s face, illuminated by the moonlight streaming through the window. Will\u2019s golden hair glowed like a halo, and his eyes, the color of a summer sky, were filled with a tenderness that made Nico\u2019s heart ache. Will reached out, his hand warm and solid as it closed around Nico\u2019s. He tugged gently, guiding Nico away from the counter and into the center of the kitchen.\n\n\u201cDance with me,\u201d Will whispered, his voice a soft plea in the quiet night.\n\nNico hesitated for a moment, the ghosts of Tartarus flickering in his mind. But then he looked at Will, saw the love and patience in his eyes, and nodded. Will\u2019s smile was like the sun breaking through storm clouds, and Nico couldn\u2019t help but smile back.\n\nWill\u2019s arms wrapped around Nico, pulling him close. They began to sway, their movements slow and unhurried, as if they had all the time in the world. The kitchen became their sanctuary, a place where the past couldn\u2019t reach them. The rhythm of their dance was steady and soothing, the soft shuffle of their feet a counterpoint to the distant whisper of the wind.\n\nNico closed his eyes, resting his head against Will\u2019s shoulder. He focused on the steady beat of Will\u2019s heart, the rise and fall of his chest, the warmth of his embrace. It was a grounding presence, something solid and real in the midst of his tumultuous thoughts.\n\nWill\u2019s voice, low and melodic, filled the space around them. He sang an old campfire song, one they had both learned during their time at Camp Half-Blood. The familiar lyrics wrapped around Nico like a comforting blanket, and he found himself humming along, the words a bridge between their shared past and their hopeful future.\n\nAs they danced, the weight of their experiences in Tartarus began to fade, replaced by the simple joy of being together. The fears that had haunted them were still there, lurking in the corners of their minds, but they were manageable, diminished by the strength of their bond.\n\nThey danced until the first light of dawn began to creep into the kitchen, painting the room in soft hues of pink and gold. Finally, Will pressed a gentle kiss to Nico\u2019s forehead, his lips lingering for a moment.\n\n\u201cReady to try and sleep?\u201d Will asked, his voice a soft murmur against Nico\u2019s skin.\n\nNico nodded, feeling a sense of peace he hadn\u2019t known in a long time. \u201cYeah,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI think I am.\u201d\n\nHand in hand, they left the kitchen, the echoes of their dance lingering in the air. They returned to their bed, the warmth of their shared ritual still wrapped around them like a protective shield. As they drifted off to sleep, the memories of Tartarus were far away, held at bay by the strength of their love and the quiet comfort of their nightly dance."
