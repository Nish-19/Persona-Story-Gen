        "story": "We were in Jimmy\u2019s backyard playing Wiffle ball when the news broke that the shortstop had been traded. The game halted mid-play as if someone had pulled the plug on a carousel. Jimmy\u2019s dad came out from the kitchen, wiping his hands on a dish towel, and the look on his face told us everything. We dropped our plastic bats and gathered around him, searching his eyes for any sign of a joke, a mistake, something that might undo the impossible truth that hung between us like the heavy summer air.\n\nOur shortstop. The one who danced like a magician on the infield dirt, whose glove was a siren\u2019s call to any ball foolish enough to cross its path. He was gone. Traded. To the other side of the country where we couldn\u2019t even watch his games on TV.\n\nI remember Jimmy staring at the ground, his freckled face shadowed by the brim of his cap. \"He always did that thing,\" he said, voice small, \"before every pitch.\" We all knew what he meant: the pre-pitch routine. Batting gloves first, fingers waggling, then the tugged wristband, the tapped chest, hip, back pocket, belt, palm to the shining blue helmet, bat rapped gently on his left shoulder, then the toe taps, one foot and then the other, four taps in all, one, two, three, four. The rhythm of it had been a litany to us, a sacred invocation we mimicked in our games, though none of us could quite capture the grace of it.\n\nThe backyard felt different after that. Our games grew quieter, as though the air itself had taken on a weight that bore down on our shoulders. We played on, of course, but it wasn\u2019t the same. Something vital had slipped away, and we were left with only the shadow of it, stretching long and thin as the afternoons themselves.\n\n---\n\nYears passed, and life unfolded in its unpredictable ways, scattering us like dandelion seeds. Jimmy moved to the East Coast, got a job in finance, while I stayed behind, planting roots in the same soil that had seen our childhood triumphs and losses. We lost touch, as people do, the strings of our connection frayed by time and distance.\n\nThen, one spring, a conference took me to Orlando, and I found myself with a day to spare. On a whim, I texted Jimmy, who was in town for business. We agreed to meet at Disney World, of all places, an unexpected setting for two grown men trying to reconnect with a shared past.\n\nAs I walked through the sprawling park, the air was thick with the scent of popcorn and sunscreen, laughter and screams from roller coasters weaving an unseen tapestry overhead. It was a place designed for joy, for the innocence we\u2019d long since left behind.\n\nI spotted Jimmy near the entrance to Space Mountain, a grin already stretching across his face. He looked the same, mostly, the years having softened the sharp angles of his jaw but not the brightness in his eyes.\n\n\"Can you believe this?\" he said, gesturing around us. \"It\u2019s like being a kid again.\"\n\nWe wandered through the park, riding rides and eating cotton candy, the chatter of old friends filling the space between us. As we passed a small baseball-themed attraction, Jimmy paused, a thoughtful look crossing his face.\n\n\"Remember the shortstop?\" he asked. The question hung between us, a bridge to the past.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"I think about him sometimes.\"\n\nJimmy nodded. \"You ever wonder what happened to him?\"\n\n\"Not really,\" I admitted. \"I guess I just assumed he kept playing.\"\n\nJimmy\u2019s eyes drifted to the sky. \"He retired a few years ago. Injuries, I think. But I heard he coaches now, somewhere out west.\"\n\nFor a moment, neither of us spoke, the memory of that pivotal trade weaving itself into the fabric of our conversation. The shortstop\u2019s routine, his grace, had been more than just a part of our games\u2014it was a symbol of the dreams we\u2019d shared, the simple joy of believing in something larger than ourselves.\n\nWe found a bench near a fountain, the water\u2019s gentle splashing providing a soothing counterpoint to the surrounding chaos. As we sat, Jimmy picked up a stick from the ground, twirling it between his fingers in a way that was achingly familiar. Batting gloves first, fingers waggling\u2014without thinking, I mirrored the motions, the tugged wristband, the tapped chest, hip, back pocket, belt, palm to the shining blue helmet, bat rapped gently on my left shoulder, then the toe taps, one foot and then the other, four taps in all, one, two, three, four.\n\nA laugh bubbled up between us, a sound as bright and unexpected as the sunlight glinting off the fountain. In that moment, surrounded by the echoes of childhood, we found something we hadn\u2019t even realized we\u2019d lost.\n\nThe sun began to dip toward the horizon, painting the sky in shades of pink and gold, and I realized that, in a way, we\u2019d come full circle. The shortstop was gone, but his ritual, his grace, lived on in us, a testament to the enduring power of shared dreams.\n\nAs we left the park, Jimmy turned to me, his eyes reflecting the colors of the fading day. \"Let\u2019s not wait so long next time,\" he said.\n\n\"Agreed,\" I replied, and together we walked into the twilight, the rhythm of our steps echoing the beat of a memory we\u2019d carry forward, always."
