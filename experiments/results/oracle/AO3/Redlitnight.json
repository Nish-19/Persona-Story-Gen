        "story": "The best feeling in the world was waking up next to Nico di Angelo. The morning sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting a gentle glow over the room, and Will Solace blinked awake to the familiar sight of dark hair splayed across the pillow. Nico\u2019s hair was always a mess in the mornings, like he\u2019d been tussling with shadows in his sleep. Will smiled, brushing a stray lock from Nico's forehead, his fingers lingering on the cool skin.\n\n\u201cWake up, my love,\u201d Will whispered, his voice soft and teasing. Nico mumbled something incoherent, nuzzling deeper into the pillow. Will leaned in, pressing a kiss to Nico\u2019s temple, feeling the warmth of his skin against his lips.\n\nNico groaned, eyes fluttering open, his dark lashes casting shadows over his angled face. \u201cFive more minutes,\u201d he grumbled, pulling the blanket over his head.\n\nWill chuckled, tugging the blanket back down. \u201cCome on, you know the rules. Breakfast in bed, remember?\u201d\n\nNico peeked out, a reluctant smile tugging at his lips. \u201cI love you even more for the breakfast in bed.\u201d\n\nTheir laughter echoed through the room, a melody of warmth and affection. Will slipped out of bed, the cold floor a stark contrast to the warmth of their shared cocoon. Connie, their tabby cat, padded over, her tail flicking as she meowed for attention.\n\n\u201cConstable demands breakfast too,\u201d Will announced, scooping the cat into his arms. Connie purred, content in the familiar comfort of Will\u2019s embrace.\n\nNico stretched, finally rolling out of bed and joining Will in the kitchen. Their routine was a dance, a familiar choreography of making coffee and toasting bread. They moved around each other with ease, sharing small touches and playful nudges.\n\n\u201cHey, Will,\u201d Nico started, a hint of mischief in his voice as he buttered toast. \u201cWhat if we did something different today?\u201d\n\nWill arched an eyebrow, intrigued. \u201cDifferent how?\u201d\n\nNico set the knife down, turning to face Will fully. \u201cWhat if we had breakfast outside? We could take a blanket, sit under the tree, and just\u2026 be.\u201d\n\nWill considered it, picturing the two of them beneath the wide branches of their favorite oak, the sunlight dappling through the leaves. It was a simple suggestion, but it painted a picture of tranquility and togetherness that made Will\u2019s heart swell.\n\n\u201cI love that idea,\u201d Will replied, his smile wide and genuine. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d\n\nThey gathered their breakfast, balancing plates and mugs as they made their way to the backyard. The morning air was crisp, the grass cool beneath their feet. They spread the blanket, settling down with Connie curled between them.\n\nAs they ate, laughter and conversation flowed easily, the world around them quiet and peaceful. Nico\u2019s eyes sparkled with life, his laughter a symphony that filled the space between them. Will found himself mesmerized, lost in the moment, in the love that surrounded them.\n\nWhen the food was gone, they lay back, side by side, hands entwined. The world seemed to pause, holding its breath as they basked in the simplicity of the moment.\n\n\u201cEvery morning with you is perfect,\u201d Will murmured, his heart full.\n\nNico squeezed his hand, turning to meet Will\u2019s gaze. \u201cAnd this is how I want it to be, always.\u201d\n\nWith that, they lay in silence, the morning unfolding around them, unchanged yet forever different in the way it made their love feel new."

        "writing_prompt": "Your partner insists you can look through their phone anytime, but when you do, you discover a collection of candid photos of yourself\u2014each one capturing a moment you didn\u2019t even realize was special.",
        "story": "The afternoon sun filtered through the kitchen window, casting a warm glow over the small table where Nico and Will sat, mugs of coffee cradled in their hands. It was a typical Saturday, the kind where they let the world drift by outside while they enjoyed the quiet comfort of each other's company.\n\nWill leaned back in his chair, stretching his legs out with a contented sigh. \"You remember Rachel and her on-again, off-again boyfriend, Ethan?\"\n\nNico nodded, taking a sip of his coffee. \"Yeah, the one who keeps 'accidentally' finding her phone unlocked.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Will said, rolling his eyes. \"They broke up again. She found out he was checking her messages.\"\n\nNico frowned. \"That's not cool. But why does she keep taking him back if she doesn't trust him?\"\n\nWill shrugged, a small smile playing on his lips. \"Some people are just drawn to drama, I guess. But it got me thinking about us.\"\n\nNico raised an eyebrow. \"Us?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Will said, setting his mug down. \"You know you can look through my phone anytime, right?\"\n\nNico chuckled, shaking his head. \"I don't need to check your phone, Will. I trust you.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Will replied, reaching across the table to squeeze Nico's hand. \"But seriously, if you ever wanted to, you could.\"\n\nNico smiled, their fingers interlocking. \"I appreciate that. But I prefer just asking you if I have any doubts.\"\n\nThe conversation drifted to other topics, but the thought lingered in Nico's mind, curiosity piqued by Will's insistence. Later, when Will was in the shower, Nico found himself glancing at Will's phone on the coffee table. It was just sitting there, unlocked, an invitation unspoken.\n\nFeeling a bit mischievous, Nico picked it up. He wasn't planning on snooping, just maybe checking out Will's photo gallery. As he scrolled through the images, he noticed a folder labeled \"Moments.\"\n\nOpening it, he was surprised to find picture after picture of himself. Candid shots, each one capturing a moment he hadn't realized was special. There was one of him laughing so hard he was doubled over, another of him asleep on the couch with a book resting on his chest. In one, he was gazing out at the ocean during their beach trip, the wind tousling his hair.\n\nNico felt a warmth spreading through his chest, a realization settling in. Each photo spoke volumes of Will's love for him, capturing the essence of their life together in unguarded moments. \n\nJust then, Will emerged from the shower, towel draped around his shoulders. He paused when he saw Nico with his phone. \"Find anything interesting?\"\n\nNico looked up, caught. \"I wasn't snooping, I swear. I just...I found this,\" he said, gesturing to the screen.\n\nWill smiled softly, coming over to sit beside him. \"I wanted to remember all the moments that made me fall in love with you.\"\n\nNico's heart swelled, and he turned to Will, pulling him into a tight embrace. \"You're such a sap,\" he murmured, voice thick with emotion.\n\nWill chuckled, resting his head against Nico's. \"Guilty as charged.\"\n\nThey sat there together, the world beyond their walls forgotten, wrapped in the quiet understanding and trust they had built. In that simple, shared silence, Nico knew he had found something rare and precious, a love captured not just in pictures, but in every unspoken moment between them."

        "story": "Hello, my little hell spawns! Today is a very special day because I finally persuaded my boyfriend, Nico di Angelo, to be in a video with me! Yes, you heard that right. The Ghost King himself has agreed to let me, Will Solace, work my magic on his face. And trust me, folks, it\u2019s going to be epic.\n\n\u201cDo I really have to do this, Will?\u201d Nico grumbles, crossing his arms but already seated in the chair under the bright ring light. He\u2019s squinting at the camera with a look that could wither a demigod.\n\n\u201cOf course, you do, tesoro! It\u2019s for the fans,\u201d I say with a wink, holding up my palette of colors. \u201cBesides, don\u2019t you trust me?\u201d\n\nNico rolls his eyes but there\u2019s a hint of a smile playing on his lips. \u201cI trust you, sunshine. But I\u2019m not so sure about your artistic vision.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d I clap my hands and lean in, rubbing our noses together affectionately. \u201cNow, let\u2019s get started.\u201d\n\nI begin with a primer, patting it gently onto his skin. Nico\u2019s eyes flutter shut, and he lets out a soft sigh, his reluctance slowly melting away. I take this opportunity to pepper his cheeks with quick kisses, making him laugh.\n\n\u201cStop distracting me, Solace,\u201d he mutters, though he\u2019s clearly enjoying the attention.\n\n\u201cSo, Nico,\u201d I say, picking up a brush, \u201cwhat\u2019s your favorite thing about being my canvas today?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot being your canvas,\u201d he deadpans, but there\u2019s a twinkle in his eye. \n\nI chuckle and start applying a light foundation. \u201cYou\u2019re going to love this, I promise. You\u2019ll look like a dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr a nightmare,\u201d he counters, but he\u2019s smiling now, and I know I\u2019ve got him.\n\nAs I work, I ask, \u201cDo you love me?\u201d\n\nNico opens one eye and peers at me. \u201cI tolerate you.\u201d\n\nI pretend to be wounded, clutching my heart. \u201cOh, the tragedy! But seriously, do you trust me?\u201d\n\nHe nods, more seriously this time. \u201cYeah, I do. With my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, you\u2019re in good hands,\u201d I assure him, dusting his cheeks with blush. \u201cNow, time for a surprise!\u201d\n\nI reach for a special palette, one he hasn\u2019t seen before, and begin the transformation. I can see the curiosity building in his eyes, but he remains still, allowing me to work my magic.\n\nOnce I\u2019m done, I step back and let out a dramatic gasp. \u201cBehold, the new and improved Nico di Angelo!\u201d\n\nNico turns to the mirror and his jaw drops. \u201cWill, what did you do?\u201d\n\nHis face is painted with vibrant colors, and he looks like a character straight out of a whimsical cartoon. His eyes are wide, cheeks painted with hearts, and his lips are a bold, sparkling blue.\n\n\u201cSurprise! You\u2019re a carebear!\u201d I exclaim, laughing as I watch his reaction.\n\nNico stares at himself, then back at me, and bursts into laughter. \u201cOnly you, Will. Only you could turn me into a carebear and make it look kind of... adorable.\u201d\n\nI pull him into a hug, pressing a kiss to his forehead. \u201cI love you, my little carebear.\u201d\n\nAnd as we dissolve into giggles, I know this video is going to be a hit."
