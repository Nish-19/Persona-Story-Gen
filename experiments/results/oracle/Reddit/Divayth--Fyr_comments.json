        "writing_prompt": "when the zombie apocalypse came, everyone raided gun stores. Except you. You raided a medieval armory and now, armed with full plate armor and a long sword, you will take back your home",
        "story": "I have to weigh about half a ton, I'm hot, I can't scratch anywhere, and I am just about certain there's a chipmunk in my greaves. The apocalypse really ought to come with a health warning. But here I am, lumbering down Main Street in full medieval armor, sword in hand, and Maisie right beside me. She\u2019s got the firecrackers. I\u2019ve got the sword. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nMaisie\u2019s voice crackles in my earpiece, \u201cYou sure about this, Jeff?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure as I\u2019ll ever be, Maisie,\u201d I reply, trying to ignore the rivulets of sweat cascading down my back. \u201cJust think of it as the ultimate Renaissance fair. Except with fewer turkey legs and more zombies.\u201d\n\nShe chuckles, and for a moment, the world doesn\u2019t seem quite so apocalyptic. Our mission: reclaim my house from a ragtag group of humans who decided squatting was more fun than surviving elsewhere. My castle, my rules, and I\u2019m not about to let some band of hooligans have the run of the place. \n\nWe approach the old iron fences, now bent and twisted under the weight of the dead, held up with sticks and baling wire. The driveway is cluttered with debris\u2014abandoned cars, shattered glass, and the occasional zombie limb. \n\n\u201cAlright, plan\u2019s the same,\u201d I say, rehearsing our strategy. \u201cI\u2019ll make the entrance, you light the fireworks, and we dance our medieval hearts out.\u201d\n\nMaisie rolls her eyes, though I can\u2019t see her. \u201cYou know, most people would go for stealth.\u201d\n\n\u201cStealth is overrated,\u201d I retort. \u201cBesides, you ever seen a knight sneak?\u201d\n\nWith a sigh, Maisie moves into position. I take a deep breath, my armor clinking in protest, and step forward. The front door is barricaded, naturally, but the side window\u2014now that\u2019s a different story. I wedge Chrysamere (yes, I named my sword) under the frame and pry it open. \n\nA gunshot rings out. I am leaning on the big stone pillar to the right of the driveway, trying to scratch my forearm with a dagger without stabbing myself. Maisie hits the deck, and I follow suit, albeit less gracefully. \n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d she whispers.\n\n\u201cJust a flesh wound,\u201d I mutter, checking for dents in my armor. \u201cAlright, time for Plan B.\u201d\n\nI nod to Maisie, who lights the first firecracker and tosses it towards the back. The crackling explosion draws attention away from us, and we take the opportunity to clamber through the window, armor and all. \n\nInside, the place is trashed. The walls are smeared with dubious substances, and it smells like something died in here, which is entirely possible. \n\nWe hear voices from the kitchen, and I nod to Maisie. She grins, lighting another round of firecrackers. In the chaos that follows, we burst into the room, a whirlwind of metal and noise. \n\n\u201cHey!\u201d I shout, clanging my sword against my shield for emphasis. \u201cYou hungry, buddy? Munch on some chainmail, deadbrain.\u201d\n\nThe intruders are caught off guard, scrambling for weapons as fireworks pop around them. I swing Chrysamere with all the grace of a lumbering bear, but the effect is surprisingly effective. Maisie, meanwhile, is a whirlwind of activity, setting off fireworks and creating confusion. \n\nThey retreat, yelling and stumbling over each other. I manage to land a few strikes, the weight of my armor providing momentum if not precision. Maisie and I drive them back, out into the open where the undead are more than happy to take over.\n\nBreathing heavily, I collapse into an armchair that\u2019s somehow still standing, bits of armor clattering to the floor. Maisie joins me, her face flushed with victory.\n\n\u201cGonna be a job of work, getting this place fixed up again, Maisie,\u201d I say, surveying the damage.\n\n\u201cYeah, but at least it\u2019s ours,\u201d she replies, settling into the chair next to mine. \u201cAnd hey, the knight thing wasn\u2019t such a bad idea after all.\u201d\n\nI snort, reaching up to remove my helmet. \u201cTold you. You can\u2019t beat the classics. Now, let\u2019s see about getting some running water, maybe a turkey leg or two.\u201d\n\nMaisie laughs, and for a moment, the world outside fades away. We\u2019re back home, and for now, that\u2019s enough."

        "writing_prompt": "You never knew you were a god until you got your very first follower.",
        "story": "Drifting along for a couple hundred years, I never considered myself anything more than a lingering whisper in the rafters of an old barn. Decent work, if you can get it. Sometimes I could make a bit of sound or move the air a bit, which I assumed was just the draftiness of the place helping me along. It wasn't much, but it was home. I had cows and cats for company, and the occasional wandering raccoon. I thought I might be a ghost, one of those poor souls stuck in limbo, but I wasn't too bothered about it. I had all the time in the world and nowhere else to be.\n\nMy existence was a quiet one, filled with the gentle mooing of cows and the rustle of straw. Until, one day, a child named Matilda wandered into my barn. She was a curious little thing, all freckles and mischief, with a determined look in her eyes that said she was up to something.\n\nShe sat herself down in the corner by the moldy tractor tire, and, much to my surprise, began to speak. \"Alright, barn ghost, or whatever you are,\" she announced, her voice carrying a note of authority that seemed too big for her small frame, \"I need some help.\"\n\nI was intrigued. No one had ever spoken to me directly before. I watched as she fiddled with a small charm bracelet around her wrist, the type with jangly little trinkets that clinked together whenever she moved. \"I lost my bike key,\" she explained, pouting a bit. \"Mom says I have to find it before dinner, or no dessert. And it's apple pie night.\"\n\nApple pie. Now, if there was one thing I missed from my more corporeal days, it was the smell of apple pie. I decided, for the first time in my rather ambiguous existence, to do something about it. I summoned a slight breeze, one of those accidental powers that seemed to work when I wasn't thinking too hard. The wind swirled around the barn, and lo and behold, it nudged the key out from underneath a pile of hay.\n\nMatilda's eyes widened as the key landed at her feet. \"Wow! Thanks, barn ghost!\" she exclaimed, giving a little clap. She picked up the key and looked around with a newfound reverence. \"You're real, aren't you? Like, really real.\"\n\nI suppose that was the moment I became more than just a whisper in the wind. Something about her belief, her conviction that I was more than just an odd draft or a creaky floorboard, started to shift things. I felt a warmth spreading through whatever constituted my current form, something akin to a heartbeat.\n\nFrom that day on, Matilda became a frequent visitor. She'd bring her friends, telling them tales of the mysterious barn ghost who could find lost things and make the chickens lay extra eggs. It was all very flattering, really. And with every visit, with every whispered prayer of thanks or request for help, I felt more solid, more real.\n\nMatilda decided that I needed a name, because \"barn ghost\" wasn't dignified enough for a deity. She settled on \"Barnabas,\" which I found quite charming. It seemed that with a name came a sense of purpose, a sort of identity I hadn\u2019t realized I craved.\n\nThe barn became my little kingdom, a place where I could stretch my newfound powers. I could make the cats come when called, influence the weather just a smidge, and even coax the cows into particularly generous milkings. All these little miracles, as Matilda called them, were delightful to perform.\n\nMatilda, bless her heart, took her role as my first follower with the utmost seriousness. She even started a club\u2014The Society of Barnabas Enthusiasts, she called it. They would gather in the barn, sharing snacks and stories, and occasionally asking for small favors. I tried not to be pushy about it, but I did encourage them to remember their prayers. It seemed important, somehow.\n\nOne day, Matilda brought me a gift\u2014an apple pie she'd made with her mother. She placed it in the middle of the barn, a sweet offering to her barn-bound deity. \"For you, Barnabas,\" she said solemnly, before breaking into a grin. \"But, you know, if you don't actually eat it, we'll help.\"\n\nI laughed, or what passed for laughter in my ethereal state. It was a good feeling, being appreciated, being a part of something. I watched as Matilda and her friends enjoyed the pie, and for the first time, I felt a sense of belonging, like I was part of their world, not just a shadowy observer.\n\nAs the months passed, the Society of Barnabas Enthusiasts grew. The barn was filled with laughter and light, with the smell of pies and the sound of prayers and chatter. Matilda's belief had transformed me from a mere whisper into something more\u2014a god, perhaps, but one content to watch over a small corner of the world.\n\nMatilda's leadership and moral compass guided me, teaching me about kindness and community. I learned that being a deity wasn't about grand gestures or divine proclamations, but about the small, personal interactions that made life meaningful. It was in the way Matilda shared her pie, the way she listened to her friends, the way she believed in me without question.\n\nIn time, I came to embrace my new role. I was no longer just a ghost or a draft in the rafters. I was Barnabas, guardian of the barn, friend to children and animals alike. And with Matilda's belief to guide me, I found purpose in the simplicity of my existence, in the joy of being part of their lives.\n\nAnd so I remain, watching over my little domain, ensuring the cows are content and the chickens are generous. I try not to be pushy about it, but I do encourage them to remember their prayers. After all, it's nice to be needed, to be believed in. It's nice to be a god."

        "writing_prompt": "Wizards have as much faith in magic as software designers have in software - none at all. A wizard is explaining to the rest of the party why they won't use magic to solve all their problems.",
        "story": "The Chasm of Terror loomed before the party, stretching wide and ominous across the rugged landscape. The wind howled through the abyss, carrying whispers of untold doom. The party stood at the edge, gazing into its depths with a mixture of awe and dread.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d spake Gorrim, the burly warrior, hefting his massive axe. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan, oh wise wizard? Magic us a bridge, perhaps?\u201d\n\nThaddeus the Illusionist, a man of wiry build and perpetually skeptical eyebrows, leaned against his staff with an air of nonchalance. \u201cAh, the classic solution,\u201d he mused, \u201cconjuring a bridge. Might I also suggest cutting off our legs so we don\u2019t have to worry about crossing it at all?\u201d\n\nGorrim blinked. \u201cThat\u2026 that doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrecisely!\u201d exclaimed Thaddeus, with a flourish of his cloak. \u201cAnd neither does relying on magic for every sneeze and hiccup. Magic, my dear Gorrim, is as reliable as a one-legged centaur in a sack race.\u201d\n\nLiliana, the elf ranger, snorted. \u201cYet you carry that staff around as if it\u2019s your lifeline.\u201d\n\n\u201cA prop, dear Liliana, a mere accessory,\u201d Thaddeus replied, waving the staff dismissively. \u201cNow, as for this chasm, I propose we use the ancient and mystical art of \u2018walking around it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe party exchanged dubious glances. \u201cWalking?\u201d asked Bertram, the timid bard, adjusting his lute. \u201cThat sounds... mundane.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, but therein lies the brilliance!\u201d Thaddeus declared, eyes twinkling with mischief. \u201cWhile others waste their days whispering incantations and burning eyebrows, we shall simply stroll to the nearest ford.\u201d\n\nGorrim scratched his head. \u201cBut what of the beasts that lurk in these lands? The terrors that stalk the shadows?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, yes,\u201d Thaddeus replied, inspecting the chasm as if it were a particularly interesting painting. \u201cThe beasts are indeed a concern. But consider this: instead of being devoured while attempting a hazardous magical feat, we might simply be eaten while taking a leisurely walk. Much more dignified, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d\n\nLiliana raised an eyebrow. \u201cAnd if we do come across these beasts?\u201d\n\nThaddeus tapped his chin thoughtfully. \u201cWhy, I shall perform the most mystifying spell of all: hiding behind Gorrim.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d Gorrim protested, though he couldn\u2019t suppress a grin.\n\nLiliana crossed her arms. \u201cAnd what if Gorrim is busy fighting them?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I shall perform the second most mystifying spell: a strategic retreat. You see, the essence of wisdom is knowing when to run away.\u201d\n\nBertram, who had been nervously plucking his lute, finally spoke up. \u201cBut, Thaddeus, surely there must be some magic that could help us?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, Bertram, ever the optimist,\u201d Thaddeus spake, patting the bard on the shoulder. \u201cIndeed, there are spells aplenty. One might summon a flaming phoenix, or call upon the winds to carry us across. But consider the price, my friends: the complexity, the risk, the inevitable gremlins of unforeseen consequences. I once cast a spell to light my pipe, and instead incinerated a chicken coop. The farmer was not amused.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re a wizard!\u201d Gorrim exclaimed. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what wizards do?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly!\u201d Thaddeus replied with a mock serious nod. \u201cAnd that\u2019s precisely why the life expectancy of a wizard is shorter than a gnome\u2019s sneeze.\u201d\n\nLiliana chuckled, shaking her head. \u201cSo, what you\u2019re saying is, magic is your last resort?\u201d\n\n\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Thaddeus affirmed, \u201cMagic is like a wild horse: thrilling, unpredictable, and prone to throwing its rider. Better to rely on one\u2019s own two feet\u2014steady, reliable, and far less likely to explode.\u201d\n\nThe wind continued to howl, but the party felt its sting less as they turned away from the abyss. Thaddeus led the way, his stride purposeful, if not a bit whimsical, as he began the long trek around the chasm. \n\n\u201cSo, what will you do if we encounter the Chasm of Despair next?\u201d Bertram asked, half in jest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll suggest we all take up knitting,\u201d Thaddeus replied with a wink. \u201cFar safer, less likely to end in catastrophe, and we\u2019d all have splendid scarves.\u201d\n\nAnd so, the party embarked on their journey, laughter echoing behind them as they left the Chasm of Terror and its perilous temptations. In the end, it was not magic that carried them forward, but the simple, unyielding wisdom of knowing when not to use it."

        "writing_prompt": "As a witch you know everything that happens in your woods. You always know who comes and goes and their intentions. Yet when you return to your hut you are surprised to find a teenager you don't recognise waiting for you, with no clue what they may want from you.",
        "story": "Now, lemme tell ya, these woods ain't just any ol' bunch of trees standin' around gossippin' about the weather. Nope, they got character, like a whole town gathered for a festival. Each tree's got its own story, and they ain't shy about sharin' it. I'm the witch of these parts, name's Hester Puddingfoot, and I know every twig and critter like the back o\u2019 me own hand. If a squirrel sneezes outta line, I hear about it through the grapevine, or rather, the vine vine.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when I come trottin' back to my humble hut after a jaunt to gather wild mushrooms\u2014those cheeky little fungi like to play hide-and-seek\u2014only to find a teenager sprawled out on my front porch like they owned the place. Now, teenagers ain't the usual clientele in these enchanted parts; they tend to steer clear of ol' Hester, 'cause apparently witches give 'em the heebie-jeebies or some such nonsense. But here was this young\u2019un, lookin' as outta place as a cow in a canoe.\n\nI squinted through my glasses, wipin' a bit o' mushroom dirt off with my apron. \"Well, bless my broomsticks,\" I said, approachin' the porch. \"What sort o' wind blew you in, child? Ain\u2019t never seen your face 'round these parts before.\"\n\nThe teen looked up, awkwardly pushin' back a mop of unruly hair. \"Uh, hey. I\u2019m Jamie. I think I\u2019m a bit lost.\"\n\n\"Lost, is it?\" I cackled, but in the friendliest way possible, mind ya. \"These woods got a mind of their own, I\u2019ll grant ya that. But they don\u2019t usually let folks wander without my say-so. You must be somethin' special, eh?\"\n\nJamie shrugged, a bit bashful-like. \"I dunno about that. I was just lookin\u2019 for some quiet, I guess. And then, well, here I am.\"\n\n\"Here you are indeed!\" I chuckled, my necklace of acorn charms jinglin' with mirth. \"Well, come in then. No sense sittin' out here like a garden gnome. Let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t figure out what the woods want with ya.\"\n\nI swung open the door to my hut, lettin\u2019 the aroma of herbs and spices welcome us in. The place was a cozy chaos, as any good witch's home should be. Jars of every color lined the shelves, filled with mysterious ingredients that would make a chef's knees buckle in envy. Jamie followed, eyes wide, takin' in the spectacle.\n\n\"Don\u2019t mind the mess,\" I said, usherin' them to a chair that didn\u2019t look too precarious. \"The dust bunnies in here have unionized, and I ain't got the heart to bust 'em up.\"\n\nJamie cracked a smile at that, the first I\u2019d seen. \"This place is... really cool.\"\n\n\"Cool as a cucumber in the snow,\" I agreed, settlin' down with a teapot that never seemed to run dry. \"Now, tell me what\u2019s been troublin' ya. Forest spirits don\u2019t just invite folks over for tea willy-nilly.\"\n\nJamie hesitated, fiddlin\u2019 with a loose thread on their sleeve. \"It\u2019s just... things have been kinda rough lately, y'know? I needed a break. Thought maybe the woods could help.\"\n\n\"Ah, lookin\u2019 for a bit o' peace, are ya? Well, you came to the right patch of magic, that\u2019s for sure,\" I said, pourin' out a cup of something soothing. \"These woods got a way of sortin' folks out, even if it means tossin' 'em in the deep end first.\"\n\nJamie took the cup with both hands, eyes softenin' a bit. \"Thanks. I didn\u2019t expect to find anyone here. I mean, you're a witch, right?\"\n\n\"Last time I checked!\" I laughed, the sound echoing like a merry bell. \"Been doin\u2019 this gig longer than you've been breathin'. And I gotta say, you\u2019re a curious case. The trees didn\u2019t even whisper a word about ya.\"\n\n\"Guess I\u2019m good at hidin',\" Jamie said, somethin' like pride mixed with sadness in their voice.\n\n\"Or maybe you\u2019re good at becomin' part o' the magic,\" I suggested. \"Takes a special soul to blend into these woods without raisin' a ruckus.\"\n\nJamie looked thoughtful, sippin' their tea. \"You really think so?\"\n\n\"I know so. The forest don\u2019t lie. Now, have you got any inklin' about what you might be capable of? Any odd goings-on around you lately?\"\n\nJamie blinked, contemplatin' this with the seriousness of a cat decidin' whether or not to nap. \"Well, sometimes I think about things, and then they happen. Like, I really wanted to be alone today, and then I was.\"\n\n\"Ah, a touch of manifestation, eh?\" I said, tappin' my chin. \"Powerful stuff, that. Could be the woods picked up on your need and decided to lend a hand.\"\n\n\"So... I'm not just some weird kid?\" Jamie asked, hope flickerin' in their eyes like a candle flame.\n\n\"Darlin', you\u2019re about as weird as a fish in water, and that's a compliment,\" I said, winkin'. \"Weird\u2019s just another word for special 'round these parts. Now, how\u2019d you feel about learnin' a bit more about what you can do? Could always use an apprentice, if you\u2019re willin\u2019.\"\n\nJamie looked up, a smile breakin' through like sunshine after rain. \"You\u2019d teach me? Really?\"\n\n\"Teachin\u2019s just another kind of magic,\" I replied, my heart warmin' like a pie in the oven. \"And I reckon you\u2019ve got a knack for it already.\"\n\nWith the decision made, Jamie stayed on, and life in the woods took on a new rhythm. We spent our days explorin\u2019 the magical nooks and crannies, learnin\u2019 and laughin\u2019 and uncoverin\u2019 the secrets of the forest together. The trees sang a little sweeter, and the woods felt fuller, knowin\u2019 a new soul had found its place among them.  \n\nAnd so, in a world that sometimes felt too big and too lonely, we made our little corner of it just right, full of magic, mystery, and a good dose of merry mischief."

        "writing_prompt": "\"I'm immortal yes, but I was born in 1986, so no, I have no knowledge of ancient civilizations\"",
        "story": "The laboratory hummed with the quiet efficiency of modern science, all sleek surfaces and blinking lights. It was the kind of place where mysteries were unraveled, truths uncovered, and yet today, it housed a mystery that seemed to defy even the most advanced scientific minds.\n\nDr. Elaine Carter, head of the research team, peered through the reinforced glass at their peculiar subject. He lounged casually on a sterile bench, a wry smile playing on his lips. His name was Alex, and according to every test they ran, he was immortal. \n\n\"I'm immortal, yes,\" Alex said, his voice carrying through the speaker system with an amused lilt. \"But I was born in 1986, so no, I have no knowledge of ancient civilizations or how to build a pyramid.\"\n\nDr. Carter sighed, tapping her pen against her clipboard. Her team of \"security weenies\" stood nearby, ever vigilant but mostly bewildered. \"Alex, we're trying to understand the nature of your immortality. Any information you can provide might help.\"\n\nAlex leaned back, arms behind his head. \"Oh, I see. You want the secret to eternal life, eh? Well, let me tell you, it\u2019s not all it's cracked up to be. You ever try finding a decent Netflix show after binging everything? Absolute torment.\"\n\nElaine pinched the bridge of her nose. His flippancy was a constant challenge, a playful evasion that left her both irritated and intrigued. \"This isn't a joke, Alex. Your cells don't age. You heal instantly from any injury. It's unprecedented.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, but think of all the sunscreen I save on. Hardly ever get a sunburn,\" Alex quipped, winking at a particularly anxious-looking scientist. \"But seriously, folks, I was just a regular guy. One day, I woke up, and bam! Immortal. No backstory involving ancient curses or mystical springs. Just a genetic fluke, I guess.\"\n\nElaine exchanged a look with Dr. Marcus Fields, her second-in-command. He shrugged, his expression mirroring her own skepticism mixed with curiosity. The idea of an immortal being with no grand tale or mythic origin was almost disappointing. \n\n\"Let's try a different angle,\" Marcus suggested, stepping up to the intercom. \"Alex, have you ever met anyone else like yourself? Any other immortals roaming around, attending secret parties or something?\"\n\nAlex chuckled, shaking his head. \"Oh sure, we have a monthly meeting. Immortals Anonymous. We sit in a circle, share our feelings, and complain about eternal life. 'Hi, I'm Alex, and I've been alive for thirty-seven years.'\"\n\nThe team chuckled despite themselves, Alex\u2019s humor infectious. But as the laughter faded, Elaine caught a glint in his eyes, something deeper, almost sorrowful. It was there and gone in an instant, leaving her wondering if there was more to his story than he let on.\n\n\"You know,\" Alex said, his tone shifting, \"I get why you're curious. I do. But sometimes the answer isn't as exciting as you'd like. I mean, what if I told you I was the product of a secret government experiment? Or maybe a time traveler stuck in a loop?\"\n\nElaine leaned forward, interest piqued. \"Is that true?\"\n\n\"Could be,\" Alex said with a smirk. \"Or maybe I\u2019m just messing with you. See, the thing is, no one knows. Not even me. And maybe that\u2019s the real mystery here.\"\n\nThe team exchanged glances, the room filled with a contemplative silence. Despite the humor, Alex\u2019s words resonated, suggesting a depth beyond his playful surface. \n\n\"Okay, let's focus on what we do know,\" Elaine said, rallying her team. \"We have a unique opportunity to study Alex\u2019s condition. We owe it to science to keep digging.\"\n\nAs the team returned to their workstations, analyzing data and running simulations, Elaine lingered by the glass, watching Alex. He met her gaze, his expression shifting to one of gentle understanding.\n\n\"You know, Doc,\" he said, \"sometimes not knowing is part of the fun. Keeps things interesting. Besides, who wants all the answers anyway?\"\n\nElaine couldn't help but smile. \"Some of us are scientists, Alex. We thrive on answers.\"\n\n\"Ah, but answers don't always lead to the truth, do they?\" He winked again, turning his attention to a book he\u2019d been carrying, some worn paperback with a cover too faded to make out.\n\nElaine left the observation room, thoughts swirling with possibilities. There was a mystery here, one not easily solved with microscopes or databases. Maybe Alex was right. Maybe the journey was more important than the destination. \n\nAs she walked down the sterile corridors, a thought struck her, a flicker of intuition. Perhaps Alex\u2019s immortality was less about biology and more about perspective. Time flowed differently for him, a constant stream of moments to be experienced, not just endured.\n\nBack in her office, she made a note to explore the psychological aspects of immortality, a study of the mind rather than the body. There was more to Alex than met the eye, layers waiting to be uncovered, stories yet to be told.\n\nIn the end, the real mystery was not how Alex had become immortal, but how he chose to live with it. And that, Elaine realized, was a puzzle worth solving.\n\nAs the lights dimmed in the lab, Alex\u2019s laughter echoed softly down the hallways, a reminder that some mysteries were best approached with a touch of humor and a willingness to embrace the unknown."
