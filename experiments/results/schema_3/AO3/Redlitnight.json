        "writing_prompt": "Every morning, Will Solace wakes up next to Nico di Angelo, the love of his life, and every morning begins with laughter, kisses, and the occasional battle to get out of bed\u2014until one day, Nico suggests something that changes their routine forever.",
        "story": "The morning sun filtered through the thin curtains, casting a soft glow across the bedroom. The air was filled with the scent of fresh pine from the forest outside and the faintest hint of coffee brewing in the kitchen. Will Solace stirred, feeling the familiar warmth of Nico di Angelo beside him.\n\n\"Good morning, sunshine,\" Will murmured, pressing a kiss to Nico's temple. \n\nNico groaned, burying his face deeper into the pillow. \"Five more minutes,\" he mumbled, his voice muffled.\n\nWill chuckled and propped himself up on one elbow, looking down at his boyfriend with a fond smile. \"You say that every morning, you know.\"\n\n\"And every morning, you try to drag me out of bed,\" Nico retorted, peeking one eye open to glare playfully at Will. \"Can't a guy get some peace?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" Will said cheerfully, poking Nico's side. \"Not when there's a whole day ahead of us. Come on, rise and shine.\"\n\nNico grumbled but couldn't suppress the smile tugging at his lips. He rolled over and wrapped his arms around Will's waist, pulling him down for a lazy kiss. \"Fine, you win. But only because I love you.\"\n\nWill's heart fluttered at the words, even though he'd heard them countless times before. \"I love you too, Nico,\" he replied, pressing another kiss to Nico's lips. \"Now, let's get moving. We've got\u2014\"\n\nNico cut him off with a sudden, mischievous glint in his eyes. \"Wait. I have an idea.\"\n\nWill raised an eyebrow, intrigued. \"Oh? And what might that be?\"\n\nNico sat up, dragging Will with him. \"What if we changed things up a bit? Instead of rushing out of bed, what if we started our mornings with a little adventure?\"\n\nWill's curiosity was piqued. \"Adventure? Like what?\"\n\nNico's smile turned almost conspiratorial. \"Like a morning run through the woods. Just you and me, before everyone else is up. We could explore the trails, maybe find a hidden spot to sit and watch the sunrise.\"\n\nWill's eyes widened in surprise. Nico wasn't exactly the outdoorsy type, preferring the quiet solitude of shadows and the comfort of their home. But there was something in Nico's expression that told Will this was important to him.\n\n\"Are you serious?\" Will asked, searching Nico's eyes.\n\nNico nodded, his gaze earnest. \"Yeah. I think it could be fun. And... it might be nice to have something that's just ours, you know?\"\n\nWill felt a rush of affection for the boy in front of him. He reached out and cupped Nico's cheek, his thumb brushing over the soft skin. \"I think that sounds amazing.\"\n\nNico's smile widened, and he leaned into Will's touch. \"Really?\"\n\n\"Really,\" Will confirmed, kissing Nico's forehead. \"Let's do it.\"\n\nThey dressed quickly, pulling on comfortable clothes and lacing up their shoes. Will grabbed a couple of water bottles, and Nico pocketed a flashlight\u2014just in case. Hand in hand, they slipped out of the cabin and into the cool morning air.\n\nThe forest was still and quiet, the only sounds their footsteps on the leaf-strewn path and the distant chirping of birds. The sky was beginning to lighten, a soft pink hue spreading across the horizon.\n\nAs they ran, Will couldn't help but steal glances at Nico. There was a lightness to his steps, a rare joy in his eyes that made Will's heart swell with happiness. This was their adventure, their new routine, and it felt perfect.\n\nThey found a small clearing just as the sun began to rise, casting golden rays through the trees. They sat down, side by side, and watched in awe as the world woke up around them.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Nico whispered, his voice filled with emotion.\n\nWill squeezed his hand. \"No, thank you. For this. For everything.\"\n\nNico leaned his head on Will's shoulder, a content sigh escaping his lips. \"Every morning with you is an adventure, Will. This just makes it even better.\"\n\nAnd as they sat there, wrapped in each other's warmth, Will knew their mornings had changed forever. For the better."

        "writing_prompt": "Your partner insists you can look through their phone anytime, but when you do, you discover a collection of candid photos of yourself\u2014each one capturing a moment you didn\u2019t even realize was special.",
        "story": "Nico was sprawled across the couch, half-heartedly flipping through a book while the afternoon sunlight poured into the cabin. Will sat beside him, humming along to a tune, his phone resting on the armrest. Suddenly, Will nudged Nico with a playful grin.\n\n\u201cHey, you know you can look through my phone anytime, right?\u201d Will said, his tone light and casual.\n\nNico raised an eyebrow, intrigued. \u201cOh yeah? Are you hiding something from me?\u201d\n\nWill chuckled, shaking his head. \u201cNope. Go ahead, be my guest.\u201d\n\nWith a shrug, Nico picked up Will\u2019s phone and unlocked it. He scrolled through the apps aimlessly, not expecting to find anything particularly interesting. But then, something caught his eye in the photo gallery\u2014an album titled \u201cMoments.\u201d\n\nCuriosity piqued, he opened the album and was met with a collection of candid photos of himself. Each one captured a seemingly ordinary moment, but as Nico swiped through the images, he realized that these were anything but ordinary.\n\nThe first photo showed Nico sitting by the campfire, the flames casting a warm glow on his face. He was laughing at something Percy had said, the joy in his eyes unmistakable. Nico couldn\u2019t even remember what the joke was, but the photo made him smile.\n\nThe next image was of Nico asleep, a book resting on his chest, his hair tousled. Will had taken the photo in the early morning light, and Nico looked peaceful, content. He vaguely remembered falling asleep while reading, but he\u2019d never seen himself like this\u2014so vulnerable and at ease.\n\nAs he continued to scroll, each photo revealed a different facet of his life. There was one of him and Will sharing a quiet moment on the beach, the sunset painting the sky in hues of orange and pink. Another showed him helping Hazel with her sword practice, a look of pride on his face as she executed a perfect move.\n\nNico\u2019s heart swelled with emotion as he realized how much these moments meant to Will. They weren\u2019t just random snapshots; they were memories, carefully preserved and cherished. He glanced up at Will, who was watching him with a soft smile.\n\n\u201cYou took all these?\u201d Nico asked, his voice tinged with awe.\n\nWill nodded, his eyes twinkling. \u201cYeah. I wanted to capture all the little moments that make you, well, you.\u201d\n\nNico felt a lump form in his throat. He\u2019d always been self-conscious, struggling to see himself as anything more than the son of Hades. But here, through Will\u2019s eyes, he saw a different version of himself\u2014one full of life, love, and laughter.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about this?\u201d Nico asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nWill shrugged, a hint of bashfulness in his demeanor. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to feel self-conscious. I just wanted to show you how much you mean to me.\u201d\n\nNico\u2019s heart fluttered, and he reached out to take Will\u2019s hand. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, his voice thick with emotion. \u201cThank you for seeing me like this.\u201d\n\nWill leaned in, pressing a gentle kiss to Nico\u2019s forehead. \u201cYou deserve to be seen, Nico. All of you.\u201d\n\nNico smiled, feeling a warmth spread through him that had nothing to do with the afternoon sun. In that moment, he realized that their future together was bright, filled with countless more moments like these\u2014moments that would continue to shape their love story.\n\nAs he nestled against Will, Nico knew that he was exactly where he was meant to be, captured in the candid moments of a life well-loved."

        "writing_prompt": "A mischievous makeup artist convinces their reluctant partner to star in a video, only to reveal a hilariously unexpected transformation\u2014what happens next?",
        "story": "\u201cCome on, Will. Just this once?\u201d Nico pleaded, holding up the makeup brush like it was a magic wand. His eyes sparkled with mischief and excitement, while Will sat cross-legged on the bed, arms crossed, looking skeptical.\n\n\u201cNico, I love you, but you know how I feel about this stuff,\u201d Will sighed, trying to keep a smile from breaking his stern facade. \u201cI\u2019m a healer, not a\u2026 whatever it is you\u2019re planning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink of it as a healing experience for your soul,\u201d Nico teased, wiggling his eyebrows. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s just for a fun video. What\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d\n\nWill raised an eyebrow. \u201cWith you? Plenty.\u201d\n\nBut Nico\u2019s enthusiasm was infectious, and after a few more minutes of persuasion, Will found himself seated in front of a brightly lit vanity mirror. The array of makeup and brushes Nico had laid out was intimidating, but Nico\u2019s excitement was endearing.\n\n\u201cAlright, alright. But if I end up looking like a clown, you\u2019re doing the dishes for a month,\u201d Will warned.\n\n\u201cDeal,\u201d Nico said, grinning. \u201cNow, close your eyes and trust me.\u201d\n\nAs Nico worked, he hummed softly, occasionally pausing to admire his handiwork. Will could feel the gentle strokes of brushes and the cool touch of makeup on his skin. Despite his initial reluctance, he found the process oddly relaxing.\n\n\u201cOkay, almost done,\u201d Nico said after what felt like an eternity. \u201cJust a few more touches\u2026 and\u2026 perfect! Open your eyes.\u201d\n\nWill slowly opened his eyes and stared at his reflection. His jaw dropped.\n\n\u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201d he started, but then he burst out laughing. Staring back at him was not the handsome doctor he knew, but a hilariously exaggerated version of a Greek god. Nico had transformed Will\u2019s face with golden eyeshadow, a deep bronzed contour, and a glittering laurel crown made of makeup. Will looked like a parody of Apollo himself.\n\nNico was laughing so hard he had tears in his eyes. \u201cBehold, the god of healing and beauty!\u201d he declared dramatically, waving his hands.\n\nWill couldn\u2019t help but laugh along. \u201cI look ridiculous!\u201d he said, wiping a tear from his cheek. \u201cBut\u2026 kind of fabulous, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d Nico said, pulling out his phone. \u201cNow, let\u2019s make that video.\u201d\n\nWill rolled his eyes but couldn\u2019t stop smiling. They set up Nico\u2019s phone on a tripod and hit record. Nico narrated with exaggerated flair, introducing \u201cthe magnificent Will Solace, reborn as Apollo himself!\u201d Will played along, striking silly poses and making grand gestures.\n\nWhen they finished, they collapsed onto the bed, still laughing. Nico turned to Will, his eyes twinkling. \u201cSee? Wasn\u2019t that fun?\u201d\n\nWill nodded, catching his breath. \u201cOkay, you win. It was fun. But you\u2019re still doing the dishes for a month.\u201d\n\nNico pouted playfully. \u201cFair enough. But now we have to show everyone at camp.\u201d\n\nWill\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh, no. Absolutely not.\u201d\n\nBut it was too late. Nico had already sent the video to their friends. Within minutes, their phones buzzed with incoming messages and laughter.\n\n\u201cGuess I\u2019m never living this down, huh?\u201d Will said, shaking his head.\n\nNico wrapped an arm around him, grinning. \u201cNope. But just think of it as spreading joy and laughter. You\u2019re a natural.\u201d\n\nWill smiled, leaning in for a kiss. \u201cAs long as I have you, I think I\u2019ll survive.\u201d\n\nAnd as the video continued to go viral among their friends, Will couldn\u2019t help but feel a warm glow of happiness. Because if being with Nico meant a lifetime of unexpected transformations and laughter, he was all in."

        "writing_prompt": "While navigating the Labyrinth, Nico encounters a strange, freckled boy claiming to be from the future\u2014and his future boyfriend.",
        "story": "The labyrinth twisted and turned, its stone walls cold and foreboding. Shadows danced along the passageways, cast by the flickering light of Nico's torch. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and ancient secrets. Each step Nico took echoed through the labyrinth, a reminder of the vastness and the unknown dangers that lurked within.\n\nNico's mind raced as he navigated the maze, his thoughts a whirl of strategy and survival. He had faced monsters, gods, and his own inner demons, but this place, with its endless corridors and deceptive paths, was something else entirely. The labyrinth had a way of making him feel small, insignificant, and terribly alone.\n\nHe turned a corner, his eyes scanning the walls for any sign of an exit or a clue to guide him. Instead, he found something\u2014or rather, someone\u2014completely unexpected. A boy, around his age, with wild, curly hair and freckles splattered across his nose and cheeks like stars in the night sky. He wore strange clothing, a mix of armor and some metallic, futuristic fabric that Nico had never seen before. The boy's eyes widened in surprise, and then he smiled.\n\n\"Hey, you're Nico, right?\" the boy said, his voice full of warmth and familiarity.\n\nNico's grip tightened on his torch. \"Who are you? And how do you know my name?\"\n\nThe boy took a step closer, holding up his hands in a gesture of peace. \"Relax, I'm not here to hurt you. My name's Will. Will Solace. And, uh, this might sound crazy, but I'm from the future.\"\n\nNico blinked, his skepticism evident. \"The future? Really? And I'm supposed to believe that?\"\n\nWill chuckled, the sound light and infectious. \"Yeah, I get it. It sounds insane. But it's true. I came back to find you. In my time, we're... well, we're together.\"\n\nNico's eyes narrowed. \"Together? Like, together together?\"\n\nWill nodded, his smile softening. \"Yeah. Boyfriends.\"\n\nNico felt a flush creeping up his neck. \"You're serious.\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Will said, taking another step forward. \"I know this is a lot to take in, but I can prove it.\"\n\nNico raised an eyebrow. \"Oh really? How?\"\n\nWill reached into a pouch at his side and pulled out a small device. It looked like a mix between a smartphone and a piece of celestial bronze. He tapped the screen, and a holographic image appeared above it. Nico's breath caught in his throat as he saw himself, older and happier, standing next to an older Will. They were holding hands, laughing, and the love between them was palpable.\n\nNico stared at the image, his mind racing. \"This... this is real?\"\n\nWill nodded. \"It is. And I know it might not make sense right now, but I had to come back. To find you. To make sure you knew.\"\n\nNico's heart pounded in his chest. He had always been skeptical of destiny and fate, but seeing that image, feeling the sincerity in Will's words, made him wonder. Could it be true? Could he really have a future with this boy from another time?\n\nAs if sensing Nico's inner turmoil, Will reached out and gently took his hand. \"I know it's a lot to process. But we have time. I can help you get out of this labyrinth, and we can figure things out together.\"\n\nNico looked down at their joined hands, the warmth of Will's touch grounding him in the present moment. He took a deep breath and nodded. \"Okay. Let's get out of here.\"\n\nWill's smile was radiant. \"Great. Follow me, I know the way.\"\n\nAs they navigated the labyrinth together, Nico found himself glancing at Will, studying his features, the way his eyes crinkled when he smiled, the sound of his laughter. There was something comforting about his presence, something that made Nico feel like maybe, just maybe, he wasn't so alone after all.\n\nThey reached a clearing, the exit of the labyrinth in sight. Nico turned to Will, a mixture of curiosity and hope in his eyes. \"So, what happens next?\"\n\nWill grinned. \"Anything we want. The future is ours.\"\n\nNico felt a warmth spread through his chest, a feeling he hadn't experienced in a long time. As they stepped out of the labyrinth and into the sunlight, he realized that maybe, just maybe, the future wasn't so scary after all."

        "writing_prompt": "After surviving the horrors of Tartarus, Will and Nico have developed quiet rituals to soothe their lingering fears. One sleepless night, they find themselves dancing in the kitchen, holding each other close as the weight of their shared past fades into the rhythm of the present.",
        "story": "The kitchen was dimly lit, the only illumination coming from the small lamp on the counter casting a soft, golden glow. Nico stood at the sink, staring out the window into the night. The horrors of Tartarus still haunted his dreams, waking him in a cold sweat more often than not. Tonight was no different. He heard the soft padding of Will's feet behind him and turned, his eyes meeting his boyfriend\u2019s concerned gaze.\n\n\"Another nightmare?\" Will asked gently, stepping closer and wrapping his arms around Nico's waist.\n\nNico nodded, leaning into the warmth of Will's embrace. \"I couldn't go back to sleep.\"\n\nWill pressed a kiss to Nico\u2019s temple. \"Come on, let's do something to take your mind off it.\"\n\nWith a gentle tug, Will led Nico to the center of the kitchen. He pulled out his phone, scrolling through his playlist until he found the perfect song. The soft notes of a familiar melody filled the air, and Will set the phone down on the counter, turning to Nico with a soft smile.\n\n\"Dance with me,\" Will said, holding out his hand.\n\nNico hesitated for a moment, but the look in Will's eyes was so full of love and understanding that he couldn't resist. He placed his hand in Will's, letting his boyfriend pull him close. They swayed gently to the music, the rhythm of the song washing over them like a soothing balm.\n\nThe warmth of Will\u2019s body, the gentle pressure of his hands on Nico's back, the soft hum of the music\u2014each sensation worked to ground Nico in the present, drawing him away from the lingering shadows of their past. They moved slowly, their steps uncoordinated but perfectly in sync with each other\u2019s emotions.\n\n\"Remember when we first started doing this?\" Will murmured, his breath warm against Nico's ear. \"Back at camp, after everything?\"\n\nNico closed his eyes, a small smile tugging at his lips as he nodded. \"Yeah. I thought it was silly at first, but it helped.\"\n\n\"It still does,\" Will replied, his voice filled with quiet conviction.\n\nTheir shared memories of Tartarus were a heavy burden, but moments like this made it easier to bear. They had learned to find solace in each other, to create small rituals that brought them comfort and peace. Dancing in the kitchen had become one of those rituals, a way to remind themselves that they were safe, that they had survived.\n\nAs the song continued, Nico felt the tension in his body slowly melt away. He rested his head on Will's shoulder, letting himself be held and comforted. The world outside the kitchen seemed to fade, leaving just the two of them, lost in the music and each other.\n\nWhen the song ended, Will pulled back slightly, his hands still resting on Nico's waist. \"Feeling better?\" he asked softly.\n\nNico nodded, his heart swelling with gratitude and love for the boy who had stood by him through everything. \"Yeah. Thank you, Will.\"\n\nWill smiled, his eyes bright with affection. \"Anytime, Nico. I'm always here for you.\"\n\nThey stood there for a moment longer, the silence between them filled with unspoken promises and shared understanding. Then, with a gentle squeeze of his hand, Will led Nico back to their bedroom.\n\nAs they settled back under the covers, Nico felt a sense of peace wash over him. The nightmares might return, but he knew that with Will by his side, he could face them. They had survived Tartarus together, and they would continue to heal together, one quiet, tender moment at a time.\n\n\"Goodnight, Nico,\" Will whispered, his voice a soft caress in the darkness.\n\n\"Goodnight, Will,\" Nico replied, his heart full as he drifted off to sleep, the memory of their dance lingering like a comforting embrace."
