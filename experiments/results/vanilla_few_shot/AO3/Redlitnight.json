        "story": "Every morning, Will Solace wakes up to the gentle rise and fall of Nico di Angelo\u2019s chest, the warmth of his body curled comfortably against his own. It\u2019s a routine they\u2019ve perfected: Will wakes first, his inner clock attuned to the earliest rays of sunlight creeping through their cabin window. He spends a few moments watching Nico sleep, tracing the faint lines of his face, marveling at the serenity that has finally found its way to the son of Hades.\n\nEventually, Nico stirs, his eyes fluttering open, and a soft smile plays on his lips as he meets Will\u2019s gaze. \u201cMorning,\u201d he mumbles, his voice still thick with sleep. Will leans in for a kiss, the first of many that will punctuate their morning.\n\n\u201cMorning, Sunshine,\u201d Will replies, the nickname a playful contrast to Nico\u2019s darker nature. Their mornings are filled with laughter, teasing, and the occasional playful battle to get out of bed.\n\nToday, however, there\u2019s something different in Nico\u2019s eyes. Will can sense it even before Nico speaks. There\u2019s a weight to his gaze, a pensive quality that makes Will\u2019s heart skip a beat.\n\n\u201cNico?\u201d Will asks, brushing a strand of hair from Nico\u2019s forehead. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d\n\nNico takes a deep breath, his fingers intertwining with Will\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d he begins, his voice steady but soft. \u201cAbout us. About our future.\u201d\n\nWill\u2019s heart races. They\u2019ve talked about the future before, in vague, hopeful terms. But this feels different. More immediate. More real.\n\n\u201cI love our mornings,\u201d Nico continues, his eyes never leaving Will\u2019s. \u201cI love waking up next to you, the way we laugh and kiss and just\u2026 be together. But I\u2019ve been thinking about how we could make it even better.\u201d\n\nWill\u2019s curiosity is piqued. \u201cBetter?\u201d he echoes, a smile tugging at his lips. \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d\n\nNico hesitates for a moment, then takes another deep breath. \u201cI want to go on an adventure with you. Just the two of us. Away from the camp, away from everything. I want to see the world with you, Will. I want to create new memories, explore new places, and share experiences that are just ours.\u201d\n\nWill\u2019s eyes widen in surprise and excitement. An adventure. It\u2019s not something he\u2019d ever considered, but the more he thinks about it, the more it feels right. They\u2019ve faced monsters and gods together, but an adventure of their own making? That sounds perfect.\n\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Will asks, his voice filled with wonder.\n\nNico nods, his eyes shining with determination. \u201cI am. I know it might not be easy, but I think it\u2019s something we need. Something we deserve.\u201d\n\nWill\u2019s heart swells with love and admiration for the boy who has faced so much darkness and still manages to find light. \u201cI think it\u2019s a wonderful idea,\u201d he says, pulling Nico into a tight embrace. \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d\n\nNico\u2019s smile is like the sun breaking through clouds. \u201cEverywhere,\u201d he replies. \u201cAnywhere. As long as I\u2019m with you.\u201d\n\nThey spend the rest of the morning wrapped in each other\u2019s arms, dreaming of the places they\u2019ll go and the memories they\u2019ll make. Their routine has changed, but the love they share remains stronger than ever. And as they lie there, planning their future, Will realizes that this adventure is just the beginning of a lifetime of laughter, kisses, and the occasional battle to get out of bed\u2014together."

        "writing_prompt": "Your partner insists you can look through their phone anytime, but when you do, you discover a collection of candid photos of yourself\u2014each one capturing a moment you didn\u2019t even realize was special.",
        "story": "Nico di Angelo had always been a private person. It wasn't that he didn't trust people; he just preferred to keep his thoughts and feelings to himself. So when Will Solace, his boyfriend, casually tossed his phone onto the couch one evening and said, \"You can look through it anytime,\" Nico was a little taken aback. \n\n\"Why would I want to do that?\" Nico asked, looking up from his book. \n\nWill shrugged, a playful grin on his face. \"In case you think I'm hiding something. Or if you're just curious.\"\n\nNico rolled his eyes but couldn't help the small smile tugging at his lips. \"You're impossible, Solace.\"\n\n\"That's why you love me,\" Will shot back, plopping down beside Nico and draping an arm around his shoulders. Nico leaned into the warmth, feeling the familiar comfort that came with Will's presence.\n\nIt wasn't until a few days later, while Will was in the shower, that Nico found himself staring at the phone again. Will had said he could look through it anytime, and curiosity was getting the better of him. With a sigh, Nico picked it up and unlocked it with the password he knew by heart.\n\nHe scrolled through the usual apps and messages, finding nothing out of the ordinary. Then he opened the photo gallery, expecting to see the usual selfies and group shots from Camp Half-Blood. What he found instead took his breath away.\n\nThere, in a folder simply labeled \"Nico,\" was a collection of candid photos of himself. Each one captured a moment he didn't even realize had been special. \n\nThere was a picture of him reading by the fire, his face illuminated by the warm glow of the flames. Another showed him laughing at something Will had said, his eyes crinkled in genuine amusement. There was one of him asleep on the couch, a blanket pulled up to his chin, looking more peaceful than he ever felt awake.\n\nNico's heart ached as he continued to scroll through the photos. There was one of him standing at the edge of the lake, staring out at the water with a contemplative look on his face. Another showed him helping a younger camper with their archery stance, a rare smile of encouragement on his lips.\n\nHe hadn't realized Will had been paying such close attention, capturing these moments that Nico himself had barely noticed. It was like seeing himself through Will's eyes, and the love and care in each photo were overwhelming.\n\nThe sound of the bathroom door opening startled Nico out of his reverie. He quickly locked the phone and set it back on the couch, his heart pounding in his chest. Will walked in, towel around his waist, and raised an eyebrow at Nico's flustered expression.\n\n\"Everything okay?\" Will asked, running a hand through his damp hair.\n\nNico nodded, unable to meet his eyes. \"Yeah, everything's fine.\"\n\nWill sat down beside him, concern etched on his face. \"Did you look through my phone?\"\n\nNico bit his lip, feeling a pang of guilt. \"I did. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to invade your privacy.\"\n\nWill's expression softened, and he reached out to take Nico's hand. \"I told you it was okay. What did you find?\"\n\nNico took a deep breath, finally meeting Will's gaze. \"I found the photos. The ones you took of me.\"\n\nWill's eyes widened, and a blush crept up his cheeks. \"Oh, those. I didn't mean for you to find them, but... I guess I wanted you to see how I see you.\"\n\nNico felt his heart swell with emotion. \"Thank you,\" he whispered, leaning in to rest his forehead against Will's. \"For capturing those moments. For loving me.\"\n\nWill smiled, pressing a gentle kiss to Nico's lips. \"Always, Nico. Always.\""

        "writing_prompt": "A mischievous makeup artist convinces their reluctant partner to star in a video, only to reveal a hilariously unexpected transformation\u2014what happens next?",
        "story": "\"Nico, please,\" Will begged, his blue eyes wide with a mischievous glint that Nico knew all too well. \"Just this once. It'll be fun, I promise.\"\n\nNico crossed his arms, eyeing the array of makeup products spread out on the table like weapons of mass embarrassment. He had always admired Will's passion for makeup artistry but the idea of being his canvas was a different story.\n\n\"I don't know, Will,\" Nico muttered, shifting uneasily. \"I'm not exactly... photogenic.\"\n\nWill's laughter was light and musical, a sound that never failed to make Nico's heart flutter. \"Nico, you're gorgeous. Come on, it'll just be a fun transformation video. The fans will love it.\"\n\nNico sighed, knowing he was fighting a losing battle. Will's enthusiasm was infectious, and Nico couldn't deny him this simple request. \"Fine, but if I look ridiculous, I'm blaming you.\"\n\n\"Deal!\" Will grinned, pulling Nico down into the chair and draping a cape around his shoulders. \"Now, close your eyes and trust me.\"\n\nNico did as he was told, feeling the soft bristles of brushes against his skin, the cool touch of foundation, and the gentle pressure of Will's hands. He listened to Will's soothing voice as he explained each step to the camera, feeling a strange sense of calm wash over him.\n\n\"And now,\" Will said, his tone taking on a conspiratorial edge, \"for the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance.\"\n\nNico's curiosity piqued, but he kept his eyes closed as Will worked his magic. The minutes ticked by, filled with the sounds of laughter and Will's playful commentary. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Will stepped back.\n\n\"Okay, Nico,\" Will said, his voice tinged with excitement. \"You can open your eyes now.\"\n\nNico hesitated, then slowly opened his eyes, blinking against the bright lights. He turned to face the mirror, and his jaw dropped in shock. Staring back at him was not the brooding son of Hades he was used to seeing, but a strikingly accurate rendition of a 1980s rock star.\n\nHis dark hair had been teased into wild, voluminous waves, and his eyes were rimmed with bold, smoky eyeliner. His lips were painted a vivid, electric blue, and glitter sparkled across his cheekbones. He looked like he had stepped straight out of a music video.\n\n\"Will!\" Nico exclaimed, half-laughing, half-horrified. \"What did you do to me?\"\n\nWill was doubled over with laughter, tears streaming down his cheeks. \"You look amazing, Nico! You should see the comments already\u2014they love it!\"\n\nNico couldn't help but laugh along, shaking his head in disbelief. \"I look like I belong in a glam rock band.\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" Will said, wiping his eyes. \"It's perfect. You make an amazing rock star.\"\n\nNico rolled his eyes but couldn't deny the warmth spreading through his chest at Will's words. Despite the ridiculousness of it all, he felt a strange sense of confidence, like he could conquer the world with his new look.\n\n\"Alright, alright,\" Nico said, grinning. \"I'll admit, this was kind of fun. But next time, we're doing something a little more... subtle.\"\n\n\"Deal,\" Will agreed, still chuckling. \"But you have to admit, you look pretty awesome.\"\n\nNico glanced at his reflection again, feeling a surge of pride. \"Yeah, I guess I do.\"\n\nAs they wrapped up the video, Nico couldn't help but feel grateful for moments like these. Will had a way of bringing light into his life, of making even the most unexpected transformations feel like an adventure. And as long as they were together, Nico knew he'd always be willing to embrace the unexpected."

        "writing_prompt": "While navigating the Labyrinth, Nico encounters a strange, freckled boy claiming to be from the future\u2014and his future boyfriend.",
        "story": "Nico di Angelo had seen a lot of strange things in his short life, but this one took the cake. The Labyrinth\u2019s twisted corridors had a habit of throwing surprises his way, but nothing could have prepared him for the boy who stumbled out of the shadows, looking as bewildered as Nico felt.\n\nThe boy had sandy blond hair, a smattering of freckles across his nose, and wore an orange Camp Half-Blood T-shirt that was frayed around the edges. He looked at Nico like he\u2019d seen a ghost.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Nico demanded, summoning his sword from the shadows. The boy didn\u2019t flinch.\n\n\u201cWill,\u201d the boy said, eyes wide. \u201cWill Solace. And you\u2019re Nico, right?\u201d\n\nNico\u2019s grip tightened on his sword. \u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s...complicated,\u201d Will said, scratching the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019m from the future. Your future.\u201d\n\nNico stared at him, trying to gauge whether this was some sort of trick or trap. The Labyrinth was notorious for playing mind games. \u201cProve it.\u201d\n\nWill\u2019s eyes softened, and he took a hesitant step forward. \u201cYou hate the color pink, but you secretly love strawberry ice cream. You pretend not to care about what people think, but you\u2019re one of the most loyal friends anyone could have. And...\u201d He hesitated, his cheeks turning pink. \u201cYou\u2019re my future boyfriend.\u201d\n\nNico felt a rush of heat to his face, both from embarrassment and anger. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Why should I believe you?\u201d\n\nWill sighed, running a hand through his hair. \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t. But you have to trust me, Nico. I\u2019m here to help you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHelp me with what?\u201d Nico asked, still not lowering his sword.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a monster in the Labyrinth,\u201d Will said, his voice urgent. \u201cA powerful one. It\u2019s going to break free and wreak havoc unless we stop it. I was sent back to make sure you\u2019re not alone when it happens.\u201d\n\nNico\u2019s mind raced. It wasn\u2019t like he hadn\u2019t faced monsters before, but the idea of having someone from the future claiming to be his boyfriend was...a lot to process. Still, there was something in Will\u2019s eyes\u2014a sincerity that Nico found hard to ignore.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Nico said, lowering his sword slightly. \u201cBut if this is some kind of trick, you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d\n\nWill nodded, relief washing over his face. \u201cIt\u2019s not a trick. I promise.\u201d\n\nThe two of them navigated the Labyrinth together, Will leading the way with surprising confidence. Nico couldn\u2019t help but study him out of the corner of his eye. There was something familiar about Will, something that made Nico want to trust him despite his better judgment.\n\nAs they walked, Will filled Nico in on the details. The monster was a remnant of the Titan War, a creature that had been sealed away but was now gaining strength. They had to find its lair and seal it for good, or else it would escape and cause untold destruction.\n\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d Nico asked as they rounded a corner. \u201cWhy not someone else?\u201d\n\nWill smiled, a small, sad smile. \u201cBecause you\u2019re the only one who can. Your powers, your connection to the Underworld\u2014it\u2019s the key to sealing the monster. And...because I wanted to make sure you were safe.\u201d\n\nNico didn\u2019t know how to respond to that. He wasn\u2019t used to people caring about him, let alone someone from the future who claimed to be his boyfriend. It was...nice, in a way that made Nico\u2019s heart ache.\n\nEventually, they reached a large, cavernous room, the air thick with the stench of decay. In the center of the room was a massive creature, chained to the floor but thrashing violently.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Will said, gripping Nico\u2019s arm. \u201cWe have to act fast.\u201d\n\nNico nodded, summoning his courage. With Will by his side, he felt a strange sense of calm. They fought together, their movements in sync as if they\u2019d done this a thousand times before. Nico used his powers to reinforce the chains while Will chanted a spell in Ancient Greek.\n\nFinally, with a blinding flash of light, the monster was sealed away once more. Nico collapsed to the ground, exhausted but triumphant. Will knelt beside him, his hand warm on Nico\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou did it,\u201d Will said, grinning. \u201cWe did it.\u201d\n\nNico looked up at him, feeling a strange sense of hope. Maybe, just maybe, the future wasn\u2019t as bleak as he\u2019d always thought. \u201cThanks, Will.\u201d\n\nWill\u2019s smile widened. \u201cAnytime, Nico. Anytime.\u201d"

        "writing_prompt": "After surviving the horrors of Tartarus, Will and Nico have developed quiet rituals to soothe their lingering fears. One sleepless night, they find themselves dancing in the kitchen, holding each other close as the weight of their shared past fades into the rhythm of the present.",
        "story": "The clock on the kitchen wall showed 3:17 AM, but neither Nico nor Will were paying it any mind. The house was silent except for the rhythmic ticking of the clock and the gentle hum of the refrigerator. Outside, the world was wrapped in the stillness of the early morning hours, but inside, two souls found solace in the small rituals they had cultivated together.\n\nAfter the horrors of Tartarus, sleep didn\u2019t always come easy. Nightmares had a way of creeping in, dragging Nico back to the suffocating darkness and relentless terror. Will, ever the healer, had his own ghosts\u2014visions of Nico slipping away, of battles fought and wounds barely mended. But they had each other, and that made all the difference.\n\nNico stood by the kitchen counter, his slender fingers tracing the grain of the wooden surface. He was clad in one of Will's oversized t-shirts, the hem brushing his knees. Will was nearby, pouring two mugs of chamomile tea, his golden hair tousled from bed. He glanced over at Nico and their eyes met, a silent understanding passing between them.\n\n\"Couldn't sleep?\" Will asked softly, his voice a soothing balm in the quiet kitchen.\n\nNico shook his head, offering a small, wry smile. \"You know me too well.\"\n\nWill set the mugs down and crossed the room to Nico, wrapping his arms around his boyfriend's waist. Nico leaned into the embrace, resting his head on Will\u2019s shoulder. They stood there for a moment, simply breathing each other in, letting the comfort of their closeness chase away the lingering shadows.\n\nThen, without a word, Will reached for the small radio on the counter and turned the dial. A soft, jazzy tune filled the kitchen, the kind of music that wrapped around you like a warm blanket. He took Nico\u2019s hand, guiding him into a slow, gentle dance.\n\nNico chuckled, the sound a rare and precious thing. \"Dancing? At this hour?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Will replied, his blue eyes twinkling with mischief. \"It\u2019s our own little world right now.\"\n\nThey moved together, swaying to the rhythm of the music. Will\u2019s hand rested on Nico\u2019s hip, while Nico\u2019s fingers curled around Will\u2019s neck. The kitchen, with its mundane appliances and everyday clutter, transformed into a sanctuary just for them. Each step, each touch, was a reminder that they had survived, that they were here, together.\n\nAs they danced, the memories of Tartarus seemed to fade, replaced by the warmth of the present. Will hummed along with the music, his voice a comforting presence. Nico closed his eyes, letting the sound wash over him, feeling the steady beat of Will\u2019s heart against his chest.\n\n\"You know,\" Nico murmured, his voice barely above a whisper, \"I never thought I\u2019d find peace like this.\"\n\nWill tightened his hold, pressing a kiss to Nico\u2019s temple. \"Me neither. But we have it now, and we\u2019ll hold on to it.\"\n\nThe song ended, but they continued to dance, lost in the moment. The weight of their shared past might never fully disappear, but here, in the safety of their kitchen, it felt lighter. They had each other, and that was enough.\n\nEventually, they stopped, still wrapped in each other\u2019s arms. The first light of dawn began to peek through the window, casting a soft glow over them. Will smiled, brushing a stray lock of hair from Nico\u2019s face.\n\n\"Ready to try for some sleep?\" he asked.\n\nNico nodded, feeling a warmth in his chest that had nothing to do with the tea or the music. \"Yeah, I think I am.\"\n\nHand in hand, they made their way back to bed, leaving the kitchen and its quiet rituals behind. But the peace they found there followed them, a gentle reminder that in the midst of darkness, there was always light."
