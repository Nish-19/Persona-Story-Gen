        "story": "The marketplace was alive with the chatter of villagers, the aroma of freshly baked bread, and the occasional whistle of a vendor calling out their wares. It was a scene of everyday normalcy\u2014a scene I\u2019d grown up in\u2014but today, something extraordinary was happening.\n\nAt the far end of the square, where the cobblestone path met the grassy knoll leading to the old oak tree, a crowd was gathering. Whispers of \u201cmagic\u201d and \u201csorcery\u201d floated through the air, carried by the wind and the excited murmurs of onlookers. Intrigued, I wove through the throng, clutching my basket of apples, eager to see what was drawing such fascination.\n\nThere, at the center of the crowd, stood Elara. She was known in our village, not just for her striking features\u2014fiery red hair cascading down her back, eyes as blue as the summer sky\u2014but for her affinity with magic. She wasn\u2019t officially trained, not by the Academy standards, but she had a knack for spells that left even the most skeptical elders nodding in reluctant approval.\n\nToday, Elara was performing a spell I\u2019d only heard about in hushed tones\u2014the Dance of the Silver Flame. It was said to be a spell of incredible beauty and danger, involving the conjuring of fire that danced like liquid mercury, swirling in hypnotic patterns without burning the caster. The elders always warned of its dangers, the potential for it to spiral out of control, consuming everything in its path.\n\nYet here was Elara, standing confidently, arms raised, as silver flames erupted in the air around her, weaving intricate patterns that seemed to defy the very laws of nature. The crowd gasped in collective awe, some stepping back instinctively, while others leaned in closer, mesmerized by the spectacle.\n\nBut as I watched Elara manipulate the flames with such grace and ease, a question lingered in my mind, as it must have in others\u2019: How did her first attempt look?\n\nI couldn\u2019t shake the image from my mind\u2014Elara, years ago, perhaps in the solitude of her own room or hidden away in the woods, attempting this very spell for the first time. Did it explode into chaos, or merely fizzle out, a shadow of what it was meant to be? The thought was both humorous and terrifying.\n\nAfter the performance, when the applause had faded and the crowd began to disperse, I approached her. She was sitting under the oak tree now, sipping from a flask, her cheeks flushed from the exertion.\n\n\u201cElara,\u201d I began, hesitating slightly, \u201cthat was... incredible.\u201d\n\nShe looked up, a playful glint in her eyes. \u201cThank you, Arin. It took a lot of practice.\u201d\n\nI sat down beside her, the grass cool under my legs. \u201cI\u2019ve got to ask\u2014how did your first attempt go?\u201d\n\nElara laughed, a sound like tinkling bells, and I couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cOh, it was a disaster. I nearly set my own hair on fire.\u201d\n\nThe image came to me unbidden, and I chuckled. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\u201cReally,\u201d she confirmed, leaning back against the tree. \u201cI\u2019d read about the spell in one of my mother\u2019s old grimoires. The instructions were vague at best, just a few lines about channeling your energy and visualizing the flames. I thought I understood it perfectly, of course.\u201d\n\nShe paused, a fond yet rueful smile playing on her lips. \u201cSo, I went out to the forest one afternoon, confident as ever. I was sure it would be spectacular.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked, leaning forward, eager for the story.\n\n\u201cWell, I started off fine, or so I thought. I could feel the magic pulsing through me, the way it should when you\u2019re on the verge of something great. But then, as I tried to shape the flames, they just... exploded. Not in the beautiful, controlled way you saw today, but in a wild, unpredictable burst. My hair caught the edge of it, and I panicked. Ended up rolling around on the ground trying to put it out.\u201d\n\nI burst into laughter, unable to help myself, and Elara joined in, the sound echoing around us. It was hard to imagine her, so poised and confident now, flailing around in the forest, trying to extinguish her own hair.\n\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t give up,\u201d I said, once our laughter subsided.\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d she replied, her tone turning thoughtful. \u201cI went back again the next day, and the day after that. Every time, I got a little better. Less fire in my hair, more control over the flames. Until finally, one day, it just clicked.\u201d\n\nHer words hung in the air, a testament to perseverance and the relentless pursuit of mastery. It was a reminder that even the most talented among us start somewhere, often far from where they eventually end up.\n\n\u201cThanks for sharing that,\u201d I said, feeling a newfound admiration for her. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget that everyone has their struggles, even someone as gifted as you.\u201d\n\nElara smiled, a soft, genuine smile. \u201cWe all have to start somewhere, Arin. It\u2019s not about where you begin, but where you\u2019re willing to go.\u201d\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the marketplace in hues of orange and purple, I found myself reflecting on her words. They lingered in my mind, intertwining with the image of her first, chaotic attempt at the Dance of the Silver Flame.\n\nIt was a comforting thought, really\u2014that behind every graceful execution, every seemingly effortless performance, there lay a history of trial and error, of missteps and lessons learned. It was a reminder that magic, much like life, was as much about the journey as the destination.\n\nWith a farewell wave, I left Elara under the oak tree, her silhouette a dark shape against the vibrant sunset. As I walked back through the now-quiet marketplace, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder: what other spells were out there, waiting to be mastered? What other first attempts, filled with chaos and humor, were waiting to be made? The possibilities seemed as endless as the sky above, and I couldn\u2019t wait to discover them."

        "writing_prompt": "An uneasy alliance\u2026 Humans and vampires band together as the world is ravaged by zombies. Humans need the vampires for protection and the vampires need a food source in the dying world",
        "story": "The moon hung low and full in the sky, its light spilling across the landscape like the ghostly remnants of a forgotten past. In the hushed stillness of night, the world felt like it was holding its breath, caught in the uneasy truce between what once was and what now is. \n\nThe town of Haven had become a sanctuary of sorts, a place where the unthinkable alliance between humans and vampires played out against the backdrop of an ever-encroaching zombie apocalypse. The air was thick with the scent of earth and decay, a grim reminder of the world outside the hastily erected barricades.\n\n\u201cAre they out there?\u201d Elena asked, her voice barely above a whisper. She stood at the edge of the settlement, peering into the darkness beyond the flickering torches that marked the perimeter. Her heart thudded in her chest, a relentless drumbeat of anxiety.\n\nBeside her, Adrian, a vampire with eyes as sharp and glinting as polished obsidian, nodded. \u201cAlways,\u201d he replied, his voice smooth and steady. There was an undeniable elegance to him, a grace that belied the predatory nature lurking beneath his skin. \u201cThey\u2019re relentless, but we have the advantage here.\u201d\n\nElena shivered, not from the cold, but from the weight of what that meant. The zombies were a constant threat, their hunger unending, their numbers swelling with each passing day. And yet, it was the alliance with the vampires that truly set her nerves on edge. They were, after all, predators by nature, and the humans in Haven were their sole source of sustenance. It was a precarious balance, one that could tip into chaos with the slightest provocation.\n\n\u201cDo you ever wish it could go back to how it was before?\u201d Elena asked, her eyes searching Adrian\u2019s face for a flicker of something\u2014regret, hope, anything.\n\nHe turned to look at her, his expression inscrutable. \u201cBefore, you mean when humans hunted us as monsters? Or when the world didn\u2019t stink of rot and blood?\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth, I guess,\u201d she replied, kicking at a loose stone with the toe of her boot. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026hard to remember what normal felt like.\u201d\n\nAdrian\u2019s gaze softened, and for a moment, he seemed almost human. \u201cNormal is a luxury we can\u2019t afford to dwell on. We adapt, or we perish.\u201d\n\nHis words hung in the air, heavy with truth. Elena nodded, though her heart ached with the weight of memories from a time when the world hadn\u2019t been so fractured. She glanced back at the settlement, where families huddled together in makeshift shelters, their faces weary but determined. They had forged a community here, a fragile bastion against the darkness, and it was the vampires who stood as their unlikely guardians.\n\n\u201cPatrol\u2019s coming back,\u201d Adrian said, drawing Elena\u2019s attention to the group emerging from the shadows. The returning vampires moved with fluid precision, their senses attuned to threats that lurked beyond human perception.\n\n\u201cHow was it?\u201d Elena asked as they approached, her eyes flicking over the group. She recognized each of them, knew their stories and the sacrifices that had brought them here.\n\n\u201cQuiet tonight,\u201d replied Lucien, the leader of the patrol. His voice held a trace of an accent, a relic from a time long past. \u201cBut it won\u2019t last. There\u2019s movement to the south. We\u2019ll need to reinforce the barricades.\u201d\n\nElena nodded, the familiar twinge of fear curling in her stomach. \u201cI\u2019ll let the others know.\u201d\n\nAs the vampires dispersed, melting back into the night, Elena felt the weight of responsibility settle over her once more. The alliance was a tenuous one, held together by necessity and the shared goal of survival. But beneath that practical arrangement simmered a cauldron of mistrust and fear, emotions that could easily boil over if not carefully managed.\n\nAdrian lingered, watching her with an intensity that made her pulse quicken. \u201cYou should get some rest,\u201d he said. \u201cTomorrow will be another long day.\u201d\n\nShe managed a smile, small and weary. \u201cYou too, though I suppose you don\u2019t really need it.\u201d\n\nHe chuckled, a low, comforting sound. \u201cTrue, but I can still appreciate the sentiment.\u201d\n\nThey stood there for a moment longer, two figures silhouetted against the flickering torchlight, bound by the fragile hope that their uneasy alliance might endure.\n\nWhen dawn broke, its light spilled across Haven, painting the settlement in hues of gold and rose. The humans stirred, their movements sluggish but determined as they went about the business of survival. Elena found herself at the barricades once more, overseeing the repairs needed to fortify their defenses.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d came a voice from behind her. She turned to see Marcus, a fellow human and one of the settlement\u2019s leaders. His face was lined with fatigue, his eyes shadowed by the weight of leadership.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d she replied, offering him a mug of the bitter brew that passed for coffee these days. \u201cHow\u2019s it looking?\u201d\n\nHe took the mug with a grateful nod. \u201cWe\u2019re holding, for now. But we\u2019re running low on supplies. We\u2019ll need to send out a scavenging party soon.\u201d\n\nElena\u2019s stomach twisted at the thought. Each foray beyond the safety of Haven was fraught with danger, a gamble against the odds of encountering zombies\u2014or worse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d she said, the decision settling over her like a mantle. \u201cI can handle it.\u201d\n\nMarcus studied her, his expression one of reluctant acceptance. \u201cBe careful,\u201d he said, his voice rough with worry. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to lose you.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, the weight of his words sinking deep into her bones. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\nAs the day wore on, preparations for the scavenging party took shape. Adrian and a few other vampires would accompany them, their presence a necessary safeguard against the threats lurking beyond Haven\u2019s boundaries.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d Adrian asked as they gathered at the edge of the settlement, the sun dipping low in the sky.\n\nElena tightened her grip on her makeshift weapon, a sense of resolve settling over her. \u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d\n\nThey set out into the twilight, a motley group bound by necessity and the shared hope of finding what they needed to endure. The world beyond Haven was a desolate landscape, marked by the scars of civilization\u2019s collapse. Buildings stood in various states of ruin, their windows gaping like empty eyes.\n\nThe air was thick with the scent of decay, a cloying reminder of the ever-present danger. As they moved through the hushed streets, the tension was palpable, each creak and rustle setting their nerves on edge.\n\n\u201cOver here,\u201d Adrian called softly, motioning to a building that had once been a grocery store. They approached cautiously, eyes scanning for any sign of movement.\n\nInside, the shelves were picked clean, but a few forgotten cans and boxes remained, hidden beneath layers of dust and debris. Elena worked quickly, gathering what she could while the others kept watch.\n\nA sudden noise\u2014a scrape, a groan\u2014sent a jolt of adrenaline through her veins. She froze, heart pounding as the sound grew closer.\n\n\u201cZombies,\u201d Lucien hissed, his eyes narrowing as he peered into the shadows.\n\nThe group tensed, weapons at the ready, as the first of the undead shambled into view. Their eyes were vacant, their movements jerky and uncoordinated, but their hunger was palpable.\n\n\u201cBack to Haven,\u201d Adrian ordered, his voice calm and commanding. They moved as one, retreating from the building with a practiced efficiency.\n\nAs they navigated the treacherous streets, the zombies in pursuit, Elena\u2019s mind raced. The alliance with the vampires was uneasy, fraught with the potential for betrayal. But in that moment, as they fought side by side against a common enemy, she felt a flicker of something like hope.\n\nPerhaps, in this shattered world, they could find a way to coexist. Perhaps, against all odds, the alliance would hold.\n\nThe settlement loomed ahead, its walls a beacon of safety in the gathering dark. As they crossed the threshold, adrenaline giving way to exhaustion, Elena allowed herself a moment to breathe, to feel the warmth of camaraderie that had formed amidst the chaos.\n\nAdrian caught her eye, offering a nod of acknowledgment, and she returned it, a silent understanding passing between them.\n\nIn the uneasy alliance between humans and vampires, there was fragility, yes, but also strength. And as long as they stood together, there was hope."

        "writing_prompt": "There is just one problem with your plan. Humans. They will pack bond with anything. Even **that**.",
        "story": "The plan was flawless\u2014at least, that\u2019s what we thought. As the commander of the interstellar fleet, I had spent countless cycles devising the ultimate strategy to infiltrate Earth. Our technology was superior, our tactics refined, and our understanding of human weaknesses seemed complete. Yet, there was one variable we underestimated: the humans\u2019 bizarre propensity to bond emotionally with anything.\n\nWe first observed this phenomenon with their pets\u2014creatures they called dogs and cats. It was amusing at first, watching them fawn over these simple animals, granting them food, shelter, and affection. Our analysts assured us that this attachment was limited to domesticated creatures. Surely, they wouldn\u2019t extend this behavior to something like a surveillance drone.\n\nHow wrong we were.\n\nThe initial deployment went smoothly. Our drones, disguised as local wildlife, infiltrated their cities and towns, capturing data and transmitting it back to our mothership. But then, it happened. Somewhere in a quaint little town, a human child discovered one of our units. The drone, sleek and metallic, was meant to blend in as a common bird. Instead, it became the child\u2019s new best friend.\n\nWe watched in disbelief as the child christened the drone \u201cChirpy.\u201d The drone, programmed to mimic bird sounds for camouflage, obliged with a series of electronic tweets. The child was delighted, and soon, the family adopted Chirpy as their own. They even built a small perch for it in their living room. Our advanced reconnaissance tool had become a pet.\n\nThe situation escalated quickly. Other humans noticed the family with the \u201cspecial bird\u201d and wanted one too. Before long, other drones were being scooped up, each given a name and a place in human homes. Our most sophisticated technology was being used as a substitute for companionship\u2014a role we never anticipated.\n\nBack on the mothership, debates raged. The scientists were baffled. \u201cThey\u2019re bonding with technology!\u201d one exclaimed, throwing his appendages up in frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s irrational!\u201d\n\nOur plan was crumbling. The humans were not just tolerating our presence but welcoming it. Reports streamed in of drones being decorated with ribbons, playing in human games, and even being featured in their social media. The infiltration had turned into a cultural phenomenon.\n\nI realized then that our failure was not in our technology but in our understanding. The humans\u2019 capacity for connection was limitless, extending beyond biological boundaries. They could turn an invader into a family member with the simple power of affection.\n\nWith a resigned sigh, I addressed my crew. \u201cWe need a new approach. If we can\u2019t outsmart them, perhaps we must join them. Learn from them.\u201d\n\nAs we recalibrated our strategy, I couldn\u2019t help but marvel at the humans. In their relentless capacity to bond, they had turned our greatest strength into a charming vulnerability. Perhaps it was time to embrace this strange alliance, to understand and, maybe, even become part of their peculiar world. And so, we did, one drone at a time."

        "writing_prompt": "Your bloodline is known for carrying superpowers, but you didn\u2019t inherit them. And so your family cut ties with you. But after having children who did inherit those powers, your family tries to reinsert themselves into your life.",
        "story": "The dusty box of old family photos sat on the top shelf of the closet, untouched for years until curiosity got the better of my daughter, Lily. I walked into the living room to find her surrounded by a sea of sepia-toned memories, her blue eyes wide with fascination.\n\n\u201cMom, who are these people?\u201d she asked, holding up a picture of a group of stern-looking individuals in outdated formal wear. My heart clenched at the sight. My family.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re your grandparents and some other relatives,\u201d I said, keeping my voice steady. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen them in a long time.\u201d\n\nLily\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\nI sighed, sitting beside her on the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, sweetheart. They\u2026well, they didn\u2019t want to stay in touch after I didn\u2019t inherit the family powers.\u201d\n\nLily frowned. \u201cBut I have powers. Doesn\u2019t that count for something?\u201d\n\nI brushed a strand of hair from her face, marveling at how much she looked like my mother. \u201cTo them, it might. But it\u2019s not that simple.\u201d\n\nIn our family, powers were everything. From the moment you were born, your life was defined by whether you would be one of the gifted ones. My siblings all had powers: my brother could manipulate metal, my sister could communicate with animals, and my youngest brother had the gift of flight. And then there was me, the anomaly, the one who didn\u2019t fit in.\n\nWhen my powers failed to manifest, I became the family\u2019s silent disappointment. They didn\u2019t say it outright, but the subtle shifts in conversation, the way they stopped sharing stories of their supernatural exploits with me, told me everything I needed to know. So, I left. I built a life, married a wonderful man, and had children who, to my surprise, inherited the very powers I lacked.\n\nLily had the gift of telekinesis, a talent she discovered accidentally while arguing with her brother, Max. Max, on the other hand, had the ability to control fire, a fact that kept our home insurance rates higher than average.\n\nAnd now, my family was trying to wedge themselves back into our lives. It started with a letter, an ornate envelope with my mother\u2019s elegant handwriting. A simple invitation to a family gathering, a plea for reconnection. I\u2019d read it a dozen times, each word poking at the old wound they\u2019d left behind.\n\n\u201cMom?\u201d Lily\u2019s voice pulled me from my thoughts. \u201cAre you mad at them?\u201d\n\nI considered her question, feeling the weight of years of estrangement. \u201cNot mad, exactly. Just\u2026hurt. They didn\u2019t want me when I was just me. But now, with you and Max...\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want us because we have powers?\u201d she asked, her voice tinged with indignation.\n\nI nodded. \u201cMaybe they do. But more than that, maybe they want to know you. And Max.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to go?\u201d she asked, her small hand resting on mine.\n\nI took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. But if you and Max want to meet them, I think we should.\u201d\n\nLily grinned, her excitement palpable. \u201cIt might be fun. Like meeting superheroes!\u201d\n\nI laughed, pulling her into a hug. \u201cYes, like meeting superheroes.\u201d\n\nThe day of the gathering arrived, and I was a bundle of nerves. As we pulled up to the sprawling family estate, memories flooded back\u2014summer afternoons playing in the gardens, winter nights by the grand fireplace. The house loomed as grand and imposing as ever, a testament to our lineage.\n\nLily and Max bounced out of the car, their enthusiasm infectious. My husband, Tom, squeezed my hand reassuringly. \u201cWe can leave anytime you want,\u201d he whispered.\n\nI nodded, steeling myself as we approached the front door. It swung open before we could knock, revealing my mother, looking older but just as regal as I remembered.\n\n\u201cEvelyn,\u201d she said, her voice warm, if a bit tentative. \u201cAnd these must be Lily and Max.\u201d\n\nThe children nodded, their eyes wide with curiosity. My mother\u2019s gaze softened, and for a moment, I saw the grandmother she could be, the one I wished I\u2019d known growing up.\n\n\u201cHello, Mother,\u201d I said, my voice steadier than I felt.\n\nShe stepped aside, motioning us inside. The house was filled with relatives, each more extraordinary than the last. My brother David was there, floating mid-air as he reached for a book on a high shelf. My sister Claire was surrounded by a chorus of birds, chirping harmoniously.\n\nThe day unfolded with a mix of awkward introductions and genuine interest. My family was enchanted by Lily and Max, their powers a source of endless fascination. Yet, as the day wore on, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of being the outsider in my own family.\n\nAs the sun set, my mother found me on the back porch, a place I\u2019d often sought solace as a child.\n\n\u201cThank you for coming,\u201d she said, standing beside me, her eyes on the horizon. \u201cIt means a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut the kids were curious.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, her expression thoughtful. \u201cI know we made mistakes, Evelyn. I wish things had been different.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too,\u201d I said softly, the old hurt resurfacing.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019d like to try,\u201d she continued. \u201cTo be part of their lives. And yours, if you\u2019ll let us.\u201d\n\nI considered her words, feeling the warmth of her sincerity. Perhaps time could heal what had been broken. Perhaps this was a new beginning, a chance to rebuild what we\u2019d lost.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d I said finally, the words surprising me with their truth.\n\nAs the stars began to twinkle above, I felt a sense of peace, the kind that comes with letting go of the past and embracing the possibility of a future, powered by love and family bonds, both old and new."

        "writing_prompt": "the university had monster dorms for werewolves,  vampires, etc. however you: a regular human. Got assigned to live there for the duration of your schooling...",
        "story": "When I first got my university acceptance letter, I imagined the typical college experience: dorm life, late-night study sessions, and maybe a coffee addiction. What I didn\u2019t expect was to be assigned to Monster Dorms. Yes, that\u2019s right\u2014Monster Dorms, where werewolves, vampires, and other supernatural beings resided.\n\n\u201cMust be a mistake,\u201d I muttered, rereading the letter in disbelief. But nope, there it was in bold: \u201cRoom 13B, Monster Dorms.\u201d I figured it was a prank or some kind of initiation ritual. But as I stared at the gothic architecture of the dormitory, I realized this was no joke.\n\nThe building loomed, with ivy crawling up its stone walls, gargoyles perched on the roof, and windows tinted as if to shield whatever lurked inside from the sun. I took a deep breath and stepped through the creaky wooden doors. The lobby was dimly lit, with chandeliers casting flickering shadows that danced like ghosts.\n\nMy senses were immediately overwhelmed. The scent of wet dog mingled with what could only be described as the metallic tang of blood. My instincts screamed at me to turn and run, but the curiosity of what lay beyond the archways kept my feet planted.\n\n\u201cNewbie?\u201d A voice broke through my inner turmoil. A tall, muscular guy with shaggy hair and a hint of fangs grinned at me. \u201cName\u2019s Jake. Werewolf. You must be the human.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, yeah. I\u2019m Alex,\u201d I replied, trying to sound more confident than I felt. \u201cIs it always this\u2026 intense?\u201d\n\nJake chuckled, a deep rumble that seemed to echo off the stone walls. \u201cYou get used to it. Just don\u2019t get too close during a full moon, and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nI nodded, not entirely reassured but grateful for the advice. As we walked, I noticed students of all shapes and sizes. A vampire was gliding down the hallway, her feet barely touching the ground, while a ghost hovered by a notice board, trying to pin a flyer without much success.\n\n\u201cHere we are,\u201d Jake announced, stopping in front of a door with the number 13B etched in brass. \u201cHome sweet home.\u201d\n\nI stepped inside, half-expecting to find cobwebs or maybe a coffin. Instead, the room was surprisingly normal\u2014two twin beds, a couple of desks, and a mini-fridge. My roommate was already there, a vampire who introduced himself as Lucian. His skin was pale as snow, eyes a deep crimson, but he offered a friendly smile.\n\n\u201cI promise not to bite,\u201d he said, a hint of mischief in his voice. \u201cUnless you\u2019re into that sort of thing.\u201d\n\nI laughed nervously. \u201cGood to know.\u201d\n\nOver the next few weeks, I learned to navigate the unique challenges of living with monsters. I discovered that werewolves had an uncanny ability to sniff out anyone trying to sneak food into the dorms, and vampires were surprisingly good at all-night study sessions. Lucian even helped me ace my history paper, drawing from his own experiences in the 18th century.\n\nDespite the strange encounters and occasional moments of terror, I found a sense of belonging. We all had our quirks, but so did any group of college students. In a way, we were all just trying to figure out life together.
