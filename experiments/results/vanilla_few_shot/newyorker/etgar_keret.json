        "story": "The apartment was the kind Romi had always imagined for herself, with high ceilings and windows that captured the afternoon light just so, spilling it across the honeyed oak floors. It was the kind of place where the air seemed to hum with possibilities, as if it held its breath in anticipation of the life she would live there. She and Ethan had marveled at their good fortune, securing it amidst a city that often felt like a swirling, indecipherable puzzle. They had wandered through each room, touching the walls as if to confirm their solidity, each corner promising to house the happiness they envisioned.\n\nThe neighbors had introduced themselves politely enough. There was Mrs. Feldman, who lived directly across the hall, a retired schoolteacher who wore her hair in a tight bun and spoke with the clipped precision of someone accustomed to managing unruly classrooms. Downstairs lived a young couple whose names Romi promptly forgot, though she remembered the way the woman had wrinkled her nose at the faint smell of paint still lingering in the hallway.\n\nIt was a week into their new life when Romi first saw the man. She had been adjusting the blinds in the living room, trying to find the right angle to let in the light without the glare, when she noticed him on the building opposite. He stood on the ledge, arms outstretched as if embracing the air. For a moment, she thought he might be a window cleaner, absurdly balancing there without equipment. But then he leaned forward, and her breath caught in her throat. He fell with a terrible, slow grace, as if the world had tilted and he was simply sliding down its surface.\n\nIn the seconds that followed, Romi found herself frozen, her mind struggling to comprehend what she had witnessed. The street below erupted in a cacophony of shouts and sirens, the city\u2019s usual soundtrack suddenly amplified. She stumbled back from the window, her heart pounding in her chest. She felt an irrational urge to call out to Ethan, but he was at work, immersed in meetings and schedules that now seemed trivial in the face of what had just occurred.\n\nThe days passed in a surreal haze. The police came and went, their questions a blur of procedural detachment. She learned the man\u2019s name was Daniel, and that he had lived alone in the building across the street. There were murmurs of mental illness, whispers of a life unraveling quietly behind closed doors. Yet, even as the neighborhood absorbed the tragedy, returning to its routine rhythms, Romi felt an unsettling disquiet settle into her bones.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that the man\u2019s death, stark and sudden, had been meant for her. It was a notion she didn\u2019t dare voice, not even to Ethan, who tried his best to comfort her with logical reassurances. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing,\u201d he said one evening, holding her close as they sat on the sofa. \u201cBut it had nothing to do with us.\u201d\n\nRomi nodded, but inside, the unease persisted. She found herself staring out the window, tracing the path of Daniel\u2019s fall with her eyes, her mind replaying the moment over and over like a looped film reel. Each time she did, she felt as if a part of her carefully constructed life had shifted, leaving her unmoored in a way she couldn\u2019t quite articulate.\n\nOne afternoon, she ventured into the building across the street. She told herself it was a simple act of closure, a way to confront the specter that haunted her thoughts. The lobby was quiet, the air heavy with the smell of dust and history. She was about to turn back when she noticed Mrs. Feldman coming down the stairs, her expression a mixture of curiosity and concern.\n\n\u201cAre you all right, dear?\u201d Mrs. Feldman asked, her voice softened by the echo of the empty hallway.\n\nRomi hesitated, unsure of how to explain her presence. \u201cI just... I needed to see,\u201d she said finally, the words feeling inadequate even as she spoke them.\n\nMrs. Feldman nodded, as if she understood more than Romi had said. \u201cIt\u2019s unsettling, isn\u2019t it? When something like that happens so close to home.\u201d\n\nThey stood there for a moment, the silence stretching between them like a fragile bridge. Romi found herself wondering what Mrs. Feldman had seen in her years of teaching, what hidden tragedies had played out in the lives of her students. \u201cDid you know him?\u201d Romi asked, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nMrs. Feldman shook her head. \u201cNot well. He kept to himself, mostly. But we exchanged pleasantries now and then. He was always polite.\u201d\n\nRomi nodded, feeling a pang of sadness for this man she had never known, whose life had ended in such a public, violent way. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about it,\u201d she admitted, surprised by her own candor.\n\nMrs. Feldman reached out, her hand resting lightly on Romi\u2019s arm. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone in that,\u201d she said gently. \u201cWe all feel the ripples of such an event. It\u2019s human nature, I suppose, to look for meaning in the chaos.\u201d\n\nRomi nodded, grateful for the older woman\u2019s understanding. As she made her way back to her apartment, she tried to hold onto Mrs. Feldman\u2019s words, to let them anchor her in the shifting landscape of her thoughts.\n\nOver the following weeks, Romi gradually resumed the routines that had once defined her days. She focused on furnishing the apartment, turning each room into a reflection of the life she and Ethan had envisioned. She returned to her work, finding solace in the structure it provided. Yet, beneath it all, she remained acutely aware of the fragility of the world she had built around her.\n\nOne evening, as she stood at the window, she noticed a small memorial had appeared on the sidewalk below\u2014a bouquet of flowers, a candle flickering in the twilight. It was a quiet tribute, easily overlooked by those passing by. But to Romi, it felt like an acknowledgment of the man whose life had intersected with hers in such a fleeting, tragic way.\n\nShe watched as Ethan joined her, his arm slipping around her waist. They stood together, looking down at the memorial in silence. In that moment, Romi felt a sense of peace, as if she had finally accepted the randomness of the universe, the way lives collided and diverged without reason or warning. She leaned her head against Ethan\u2019s shoulder, grateful for his steady presence, for the life they were building together, even in the shadow of uncertainty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d Ethan said softly, as if sensing her thoughts.\n\nRomi nodded, feeling the truth of his words settle within her. She knew now that she couldn\u2019t control the world around her, couldn\u2019t prevent the tragedies that might unfold. But she could choose how to respond to them, how to hold onto the things that mattered most.\n\nAs they turned away from the window, leaving the city\u2019s lights to flicker in the darkness, Romi felt a renewed resolve to embrace the life they had chosen, to find meaning in the moments that filled their days, however fragile they might be."
