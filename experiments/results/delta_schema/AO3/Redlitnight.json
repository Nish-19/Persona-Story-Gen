        "story": "Sunlight peeked through the curtains, casting a warm glow over the room. Will Solace groaned dramatically, flopping back onto the pillows like a defeated hero. \"Morning already?\" he mumbled, rubbing his eyes and turning towards the tangle of dark hair beside him. \n\nNico di Angelo, looking like a disgruntled hedgehog, stirred slightly, his face half-buried in the pillow. \"Your hair looks like Medusa had a bad day,\" Will teased, a grin spreading across his face. \n\nNico cracked an eye open, a smirk playing at the corners of his lips. \"And your breath could scare a hellhound,\" he shot back, the familiar banter beginning to chase away the last remnants of sleep.\n\nWill leaned over, ignoring the jibe, and planted a kiss on Nico's forehead, feeling the warmth and comfort of the morning settle around them. Their mornings were always like this\u2014filled with laughter, gentle teasing, and the occasional wrestling match to see who would brave the cold floor first.\n\nNico stretched, cat-like, and sighed contentedly. \"You know,\" he began, his voice still thick with sleep, \"I've been thinking.\"\n\nWill blinked, feigning mock horror. \"Thinking? At this hour? Nico, you know we have a strict no-thinking-before-coffee policy.\"\n\nNico chuckled, shifting closer. \"I was thinking we should shake up our morning routine.\"\n\nWill raised an eyebrow, intrigued. \"What do you have in mind? Let me guess\u2014getting out of bed without a fight?\"\n\n\"Better,\" Nico replied, eyes gleaming with mischief. \"A morning dance-off.\"\n\nWill stared at him, his mind processing the suggestion. \"You want me to dance before coffee? Are you trying to kill me?\"\n\nNico laughed, a sound that always warmed Will's heart. \"Oh come on, it'll be fun! We can start every morning with a dance-off, like one of those TikTok challenges.\"\n\nWill groaned, but he couldn't help the smile tugging at his lips. \"This is madness,\" he muttered, but deep down, he knew that perhaps madness was exactly what they needed. \"Alright, alright. But you're going to have to show me the moves, Mr. Di Angelo.\"\n\nNico sat up, his excitement contagious. \"It's settled then. Tomorrow morning, we dance.\"\n\nThe next day, the sun rose, and with it, the promise of something new. Will awoke to the sound of music\u2014a catchy tune Nico had found online. He looked over to see Nico already standing, an eager grin on his face.\n\n\"Ready to bust a move, Solace?\" Nico challenged, extending a hand.\n\nWill hesitated, then laughed, taking Nico's hand and letting himself be pulled to his feet. \"Alright, let's do this.\"\n\nWhat followed was a chaotic, hilarious attempt at dancing\u2014Will's limbs flailed, Nico's graceful movements contrasting with his own awkward ones. They laughed, tripping over each other, the world outside forgotten in their shared joy.\n\nThe dance-off became a staple of their mornings, a new tradition that brought them closer, filling the room with laughter and warmth. They found themselves looking forward to it, eager to start each day with smiles and stolen kisses amidst the playful chaos.\n\nWill realized that sometimes, all it took was a little madness to make life brighter. Nico's unexpected suggestion had changed their mornings forever, adding a touch of magic to the mundane.\n\nAnd as they collapsed back onto the bed, breathless and grinning, Will knew that these were the moments he cherished most\u2014moments that reminded him why he fell in love with Nico in the first place."

        "story": "The late afternoon sun was casting its golden glow through the curtains, warming the living room in a way that made everything feel soft and serene. Nico was sprawled on the couch, half-heartedly scrolling through his own phone when Will, casually munching on an apple, tossed his phone onto the couch beside Nico.\n\n\"You know you can look through it anytime, right?\" Will said, a playful grin tugging at his lips. Nico raised an eyebrow, intrigued. \n\n\"Is that a challenge, Solace?\" Nico teased, setting his phone down and picking up Will\u2019s. The screen was already unlocked, and Nico\u2019s curiosity piqued. He couldn't resist the opportunity to dig a little deeper into Will\u2019s world.\n\nAs he swiped through the apps, he hesitated at the photo gallery icon, glancing up to find Will watching him with an amused expression. \"What are you hiding in here?\" Nico asked with mock suspicion.\n\n\"Only the evidence of your secret life as a superhero,\" Will replied, his eyes twinkling. Nico chuckled and tapped on the gallery.\n\nThe photos loaded, and Nico was greeted with a gallery of candid shots. At first, they seemed ordinary\u2014pictures of their friends, snapshots from their adventures\u2014but as he scrolled, he noticed a pattern. There he was, in each photo, often oblivious to the camera.\n\nThere was one of him sitting on the porch, book in hand, the setting sun painting the sky in hues of pink and orange. Nico laughed, crinkling his eyes at the memory. \"I can't believe you captured my 'thinking face'\u2014it's a rare sight!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"You caught me in my natural habitat!\" he added, voice dripping with sarcasm. Will chuckled from the kitchen, setting his apple down and walking over to sit beside Nico.\n\n\"That one\u2019s my favorite,\" Will said, pointing to a photo of Nico holding a steaming cup of coffee, a soft smile on his lips as he gazed out the window. \"I never realized how much joy a simple cup of coffee could bring until I saw it through your eyes,\" Nico mused, his voice softer now, introspective.\n\n\"I knew you were up to something with all those sneaky smiles!\" Nico declared dramatically, feigning shock. Will laughed, nudging him playfully.\n\n\"You have a 'serious face' in this one,\" Will pointed out, teasingly prodding at a picture of Nico intensely focused on a board game. \"You look like you\u2019re plotting world domination.\"\n\nNico leaned back, letting out a theatrical sigh. \"I never knew you saw me like this. I never knew these moments mattered so much,\" he said, a touch of wonder in his voice.\n\nWill gently brushed a stray hair from Nico\u2019s face, a small, affectionate gesture that spoke volumes. \"I see you, Nico. Every day. These moments\u2014they\u2019re special because you\u2019re in them.\"\n\nNico felt a warmth spread through him, not just from the sun but from the depth of Will\u2019s words. It was like discovering a behind-the-scenes Instagram story of their life, capturing the essence of everything they shared.\n\n\"You\u2019re a secret paparazzo,\" Nico accused, a smile tugging at his lips. They both laughed, the sound filling the room with an easy, intimate joy.\n\nThe world outside continued to glow with the fading light, but inside, Nico felt a different kind of light\u2014a shared warmth, a connection that needed no words. He leaned his head against Will\u2019s shoulder, feeling at home in every sense of the word."

        "story": "The sun dipped low over Camp Half-Blood, casting long shadows that danced like mischievous sprites across the training grounds. Nico di Angelo stood with his arms crossed, trying to look stern, but the corners of his mouth twitched upward as Will Solace, the camp\u2019s resident makeup maestro, launched into his latest scheme.\n\n\u201cCome on, it'll be fun!\u201d Will chirped, brandishing a palette of eye shadows with colors so vivid they could rival a peacock. \u201cYou can be my canvas, and I'll make you a masterpiece\u2014or at least a meme.\u201d\n\nNico sighed dramatically, though a smile tugged at his lips. \u201cI didn't sign up to become a walking art exhibit, Will.\u201d\n\nWill laughed, leaning in to press a quick kiss to Nico\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou always said you wanted to try something new. Well, here it is!\u201d\n\nNico rolled his eyes but relented, plopping down onto a stool with exaggerated reluctance. \u201cFine, but if I end up looking like a disco ball had a baby with a clown, I\u2019m blaming you.\u201d\n\nWill\u2019s eyes sparkled with mischief as he set to work, brushes flying like tiny wands casting spells of color and light. Nico sat still, his mind a whirl of thoughts. I can\u2019t believe I let him do this. But his smile\u2026 it\u2019s worth it, right? Or am I just a fool in glitter?\n\nAs Will layered on the colors, he kept up a running commentary, teasing and joking in a way that made Nico's heart warm. \u201cThis is going viral faster than a cat video on TikTok,\u201d Will declared as he added the final touches, a shimmer that caught the light like a kaleidoscope.\n\nFinally, Will stepped back, a triumphant grin on his face. \u201cAnd voil\u00e0! A masterpiece!\u201d\n\nNico opened his eyes and stared at his reflection, his jaw dropping. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you turned me into a rainbow warrior!\u201d he exclaimed, trying not to laugh.\n\nThe room erupted in laughter as Nico struck a pose, his face a canvas of chaos and color. The dramatic gasp he let out was pure theatrics. \u201cI look like a demigod gone rogue! I could give Dionysus a run for his money!\u201d\n\nWill doubled over in laughter, wiping tears from his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re perfect, Nico. Absolutely perfect.\u201d\n\nNico turned to face Will, his initial confusion melting away in the face of Will\u2019s infectious joy. \u201cOkay, okay, I admit it. You got me. But only because you look so happy.\u201d\n\nHe adjusted his new look in the mirror with a resigned smile. Maybe this isn\u2019t so bad after all. Maybe it\u2019s kind of amazing. \n\nAs they both settled into the comfortable banter that came so easily to them, Nico felt the weight of the day\u2019s worries lift. In Will\u2019s laughter and light, he found his own peace.\n\n\u201cNext time, I\u2019m doing your makeup,\u201d Nico declared with mock seriousness, a playful glint in his eyes.\n\nWill grinned, slinging an arm around Nico\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDeal. But only if I get to be a sunburst of glitter.\u201d\n\nTogether, they watched the sunset, the sky painted in hues that mirrored Nico\u2019s new look. And in that moment, surrounded by laughter and love, everything felt just right."

        "story": "The Labyrinth twisted around Nico like a serpent, its walls shimmering with an eerie glow that cast long shadows with every flicker of torchlight. Nico had grown accustomed to the oddities of this place, but nothing prepared him for the freckled boy who appeared seemingly out of nowhere, a cheeky grin plastered across his face.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Nico demanded, summoning shadows to his fingertips just in case this was another trick of the Labyrinth.\n\nThe boy raised his hands in mock surrender, freckles dancing across his nose and cheeks like constellations. \"Whoa there, shadow boy! I'm not here to mess up your timeline, just your heart.\"\n\nNico blinked, his mind a whirlwind of 'what ifs' and 'why nots.' \"You're what? My heart? Are you serious?\"\n\n\"As a heart attack,\" the boy replied, his grin widening. \"Name's Will, by the way. Future boyfriend extraordinaire.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Nico muttered sarcastically, lowering his guard just a fraction, \"now I have to worry about future me's love life too?\"\n\nWill laughed, a sound that echoed warmly off the Labyrinth's walls. \"Relax, Nico. I'm just here for a little sneak peek. Think of it as a... romantic spoiler.\"\n\nNico was both intrigued and exasperated. \"Is this real? Am I really destined to fall for this freckled time traveler?\"\n\nWill stepped closer, and Nico noticed how his presence seemed to make the shadows retreat just a bit, as if they, too, were curious. \"I promise, no paradoxes. Just here to tell you that things turn out pretty great.\"\n\n\"Do future boyfriends come with a warranty?\" Nico asked, trying to keep his tone light despite the chaos of thoughts in his head.\n\n\"Lifetime guarantee,\" Will shot back, eyes twinkling.\n\nThey walked side by side, the Labyrinth's endless corridors somehow less daunting with Will's easy presence. As they maneuvered around yet another corner, Will started sharing stories\u2014tales of a world filled with pop culture phenomena Nico couldn't begin to comprehend.\n\n\"Wait, so you\u2019re telling me there's a movie about a superhero raccoon?\" Nico asked, trying and failing to suppress a laugh.\n\n\"And a talking tree,\" Will confirmed, his enthusiasm infectious. \"You\u2019re gonna love it.\"\n\nNico found himself relaxing, the absurdity of the situation blending into a strange sort of comfort. They talked about everything and nothing, their banter weaving a tapestry of familiarity and warmth amidst the cold stone of the Labyrinth.\n\n\"So, what's this future me like?\" Nico asked, half-joking, half-earnest.\n\nWill paused, his playful demeanor turning serious for a moment. \"You're amazing, Nico. Brave, stubborn, kind... and yeah, a little scary sometimes. But you always make me feel like I belong.\"\n\nThe sincerity in Will's voice caught Nico off guard, a warmth spreading in his chest. \"And you? How do you fit into all this?\"\n\nWill shrugged, trying to play it cool. \"I just try to keep up with you.\"\n\nNico glanced at him, a small smile tugging at his lips. \"You know an awful lot about me for someone who claims to be from the future.\"\n\n\"Perks of being your boyfriend,\" Will teased, nudging Nico with his shoulder.\n\nThey continued through the Labyrinth, the shadows no longer as menacing. Nico began to trust Will's presence, the way he knew just when to step aside to avoid a hidden trap, or how he seemed to anticipate Nico's questions before they were even asked.\n\n\"Why me? Why now? Why him?\" Nico pondered, but every time he glanced at Will, his questions seemed to fade into the background.\n\nAs they turned yet another corner, Nico felt a sense of peace, like maybe, just maybe, this strange, freckled boy was telling the truth. The Labyrinth still loomed around them, but Nico felt a warmth in his heart that hadn't been there before.\n\n\"Hey, Will,\" Nico said quietly, \"thanks for the spoiler.\"\n\nWill grinned, reaching for Nico's hand as they walked onward. \"Anytime, shadow boy. Anytime.\""

One sleepless night, they find themselves dancing in the kitchen, holding each other close as the weight of their shared past fades into the rhythm of the present.",
        "story": "The soft glow of the kitchen lights cast gentle shadows across the worn tiles, illuminating the scene with a warmth that belied the chill of the night outside. Nico and Will found themselves there, caught in one of those quiet, shared moments that had become their lifeline. It was their unspoken ritual, a dance they both knew well, though neither of them could quite master the steps.\n\n\u201cSeriously, you dance like you\u2019re battling a hydra,\u201d Nico teased, a rare smile tugging at his lips as Will spun him clumsily, their feet tangling together in a mess of limbs.\n\nWill chuckled, his laughter a gentle melody that wrapped around them like a comforting embrace. \u201cHey, I\u2019m just trying to keep it interesting. Besides, if we ever get ambushed by monsters in the kitchen, we\u2019ll be ready.\u201d\n\nNico\u2019s laughter bubbled up, a rare sound that filled the kitchen with warmth, and he leaned into Will, their shared breaths mingling in the space between them. The faint aroma of chamomile tea lingered in the air, a reminder of quieter nights and whispered conversations.\n\n\u201cRemember when we couldn\u2019t even look at each other without thinking of Tartarus?\u201d Nico murmured, his voice soft, reflective. \u201cAnd now here we are, stepping on each other\u2019s toes and pretending we know how to dance.\u201d\n\nWill\u2019s grip tightened around Nico\u2019s waist, drawing him closer. \u201cYeah, but we\u2019re getting better. Just like everything else.\u201d\n\nThey swayed gently, the music playing from Will\u2019s phone a surprising choice\u2014Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cLover,\u201d a song neither of them would have admitted to liking in daylight. Yet here, in the sanctuary of their kitchen, it felt just right.\n\nNico closed his eyes, leaning his head against Will\u2019s shoulder, allowing himself to be enveloped by the warmth and the rhythm. He held onto Will, feeling the weight of their past slip away with each step, each turn, each shared breath. It was a dance of healing, of letting go, of finding peace in the presence of the person who had become his anchor.\n\n\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll ever stop being afraid?\u201d Nico asked quietly, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nWill\u2019s fingers traced soothing patterns on Nico\u2019s back. \u201cMaybe. Maybe not. But we have each other, and that\u2019s enough. We\u2019re enough.\u201d\n\nThe words hung in the air, comforting and solid, and Nico let them sink in, feeling the truth of them settle into his bones. They were enough, together. More than enough.\n\nThe kitchen was their haven, a place where they could be themselves without fear or pretense. The soft glow of the lights, the lingering scent of tea, the gentle music\u2014it all combined to create an atmosphere of serenity, a stark contrast to the tumultuous journey that had brought them here.\n\nAs the song faded into the quiet hum of the night, Nico pulled back slightly, meeting Will\u2019s gaze. There was a light there, a reflection of everything they had been through and everything they had yet to become.\n\n\u201cThanks for the dance,\u201d Nico said with a smirk, his tone teasing.\n\nWill grinned, leaning in to press a soft kiss to Nico\u2019s forehead. \u201cAnytime, death boy. Anytime.\u201d\n\nAnd so, wrapped in the warmth of their shared moment, they stood together, letting the silence and their love speak for them as the night carried on outside, the world slipping away until only they remained."
