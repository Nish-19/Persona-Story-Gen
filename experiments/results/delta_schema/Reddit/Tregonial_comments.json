All he had was $5000 in cash, a change of clothes, a pack of cigarettes, and a lighter. He sighed, pulled down the brim of his Colts hat, and stepped into the smoggy air of Indianapolis.",
        "story": "Blake coughed as he stepped into the gray haze that blanketed Indianapolis, the skyline a jagged silhouette against the smog-streaked sky. It wasn't the birthday gift he had hoped for\u2014being booted from the creaky, old orphanage with nothing but a few bills, a change of clothes, and a pack of cigarettes was hardly a cause for celebration. But here he was, a free agent in a city that seemed to swallow people whole.\n\nHe pulled the brim of his Colts hat lower, as if it could shield him from the harshness of the world, and stuffed his hands deep into his pockets. The cash was a meager cushion, and he felt the lighter's comforting weight. He flicked it open, its small flame a beacon in the murk, before snapping it shut again. \n\nBlake wandered aimlessly, the city's pulse thrumming beneath his feet. The streets were a patchwork of cracked pavement and faded murals, the remnants of a better time. As he walked, a glint caught his eye\u2014a metallic flash amidst the grime.\n\nHe approached the source of the glimmer and found a peculiar object half-buried in a pile of trash. It was a small, ornate compass, its needle spinning wildly in all directions. Intrigued, he picked it up, brushing off the muck. The second his fingers wrapped around it, he felt a strange tingle run up his arm, as if the compass was alive and aware.\n\n\"Curious little trinket, isn't it?\" came a gravelly voice from behind him.\n\nBlake spun around to see a scruffy old man leaning against a lamppost, a mischievous grin splitting his weathered face. The man wore a patchwork coat that looked as if it had been stitched together from a dozen different eras.\n\n\"Uh, yeah,\" Blake replied, eyeing the man warily. \"What's it to you?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing much,\" the man said, waving a hand as if dismissing a fly. \"Just that it might lead you to places you never imagined.\"\n\nBefore Blake could question him further, the old man vanished into the throng of pedestrians, leaving Blake with more questions than answers.\n\nShaking his head, Blake pocketed the compass and continued on, a sense of unease prickling his skin. The streets seemed to twist and turn in ways they hadn't before, leading him into an alleyway that hummed with an otherworldly energy.\n\nAs he turned a corner, the alley opened into a bizarre bazaar, a marketplace bustling with creatures and beings that defied description. A minotaur haggled with a gnome over a pair of enchanted boots, while a floating jellyfish puffed on a cigar, its tendrils trailing lazily behind it.\n\nBlake blinked, wondering if he had somehow stumbled into a fever dream. But no, the sights and sounds were too real, too vibrant to be mere fantasy.\n\n\"Welcome to the Crossroads Market!\" chirped a small, feathered creature perched on a nearby stall. \"Everything you never knew you needed, and some things you probably don't want!\"\n\nBlake's gaze fell to the compass in his hand, its needle now pointing steadily toward a tent at the market's center, emblazoned with a symbol that looked suspiciously like an eye. His feet moved before his mind could catch up, carrying him toward the tent.\n\nInside, the air was thick with incense and mystery. Shelves lined the walls, crammed with jars of glowing substances and artifacts that whispered secrets. At the tent's heart sat a woman with skin as dark as the night sky, her eyes swirling galaxies.\n\n\"Ah, the orphan boy,\" she said, her voice a melody. \"I wondered when you might arrive.\"\n\n\"How do you know who I am?\" Blake asked, his voice trembling slightly.\n\n\"The compass chose you, did it not?\" she replied, gesturing to the object in his hand. \"It only reveals the path to those with a destiny.\"\n\nA laugh bubbled up from Blake's chest, unexpected and sharp. \"Destiny? Me? I just got kicked out of an orphanage. I'm nobody.\"\n\nThe woman smiled, a constellation of stars. \"Nobody is nobody, dear child. We all have a role to play in the grand tapestry.\"\n\nBlake shifted his weight, skepticism warring with curiosity. \"So, what's my role?\"\n\n\"That,\" she said, leaning forward, \"is for you to discover. But know this: the compass will guide you to where you need to be, not where you wish to go.\"\n\nWith that cryptic message, Blake found himself back on the streets of Indianapolis, the market and its wonders vanished as if they had never been. The compass lay in his palm, still and silent.\n\nHe walked on, the city's grit mingling with the promise of magic. In the days that followed, the compass led him on a series of unexpected adventures\u2014befriending a talking raccoon who claimed to be a prince under a curse, navigating a labyrinthine library that contained all the knowledge of the multiverse, and even thwarting a plot to unleash cosmic chaos upon the world.\n\nEach step of the way, Blake's understanding of himself and the universe expanded, his resourcefulness and adaptability tested in ways he had never imagined. Humor and surprise became his allies as he faced bizarre and whimsical challenges, each more absurd than the last.\n\nAnd one day, as he stood atop the tallest building in the city, the compass in his hand pulsed with a warmth that radiated through his body. Blake chuckled, shaking his head at the absurdity of it all. Kicked out of an orphanage, he might have been, but he had found something far greater\u2014a sense of belonging, a hidden power within, and a destiny that was his to shape.\n\nWith a final glance at the skyline, Blake stepped forward, ready to embrace whatever the compass\u2014and life\u2014had in store."

        "writing_prompt": "After humans have finally discovered FTL travel, they receive a\u2014wait, what's that? A speeding ticket?",
        "story": "The day humanity first breached the light-speed barrier was celebrated with all the grandeur of a planetary gala. Fireworks lit up the skies of Earth, Mars, and even the twinkling domes of Europa. Captain Lana Breckenridge, at the helm of the starship *Vagabond*, was hailed as a hero, a pioneer of the cosmic seas. But the jubilation was short-lived, interrupted by a peculiar beep on the ship's console.\n\nLana frowned, adjusting her captain\u2019s hat, an old Earth relic she wore for luck. Her fingers danced across the touch panel, bringing up the message that had so rudely intruded on her moment of glory. It read, in bright galactic standard text: \"FTL Speed Violation: 3,000 c. Pay immediately or face cosmic court.\"\n\n\"A speeding ticket?\" Lana exclaimed, her voice echoing through the ship\u2019s bridge. \"In space?\"\n\n\"What's up, Cap?\" piped up Benny, the ship's AI, who had the personality of a mischievous teenager.\n\n\"We\u2019ve got a... speeding ticket,\" Lana replied, still trying to process the absurdity.\n\nBenny let out a digital snicker. \"Well, you did kinda floor it back there.\"\n\nLana rolled her eyes. \"Who knew there were speed limits in the infinite expanse of space?\"\n\nThe ship's communication console buzzed again, and a hologram flickered to life on the bridge. It was a cosmic police officer, a being of shimmering stardust, donning a uniform that seemed more ceremonial than functional. His badge read \"Officer Nebulax.\"\n\n\"Captain Breckenridge,\" Nebulax intoned, his voice reverberating like the hum of distant stars. \"You have been cited for exceeding the galactic speed limit.\"\n\nLana blinked. \"There\u2019s a galactic speed limit?\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Nebulax replied, his form pulsating with authority. \"The Interstellar Traffic Code, section 42, paragraph 7, clearly states that no vessel shall exceed 2,000 times the speed of light.\"\n\n\"That's preposterous!\" Lana protested. \"We just broke the light-speed barrier! How could we know about your speed limits?\"\n\nNebulax's eyes twinkled with cosmic wisdom. \"Ignorance of the law is not an excuse, Captain.\"\n\nLana sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. \"And what if I don\u2019t pay this... ticket?\"\n\nNebulax's starlit form flickered ominously. \"Failure to comply will result in a mandatory appearance before the Cosmic Council.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Lana muttered, sarcasm dripping from her words. \"A cosmic court date.\"\n\nWith a poof of stardust, Nebulax vanished, leaving Lana and Benny to contemplate their bizarre predicament. The ship's engines hummed gently in the background, as if waiting for the captain\u2019s next move.\n\n\"Guess we're heading to court,\" Benny quipped, clearly enjoying the absurdity.\n\n\"Not if I can help it,\" Lana grumbled, determination sparking in her eyes. \"Set course for the nearest galactic outpost. We\u2019re going to sort this out.\"\n\nThe *Vagabond* zipped through the cosmic highways, weaving past nebulae and asteroid fields, until it reached the bustling outpost of Zarnak Prime. The station was a vibrant hub of interstellar activity, with ships of all shapes and sizes docking and departing like bees in a cosmic hive.\n\nLana disembarked, her boots clanking on the metallic floor of the station. Benny\u2019s avatar, a holographic projection resembling a cheeky raccoon, followed her.\n\nInside the Galactic Administrative Building, Lana approached a counter manned by a bored-looking clerk, whose skin shimmered like mercury.\n\n\"How may I assist you?\" the clerk drawled, barely lifting her gaze from a floating data pad.\n\n\"I need to contest a speeding ticket,\" Lana declared.\n\nThe clerk sighed, pulling up a holographic screen. \"Name?\"\n\n\"Captain Lana Breckenridge.\"\n\nAs the clerk tapped away, Lana glanced around. The waiting area was filled with creatures from across the galaxy, all grumbling about fines and citations. A tentacled being was arguing about parking violations, while a crystalline entity was attempting to explain why its luminescence was not a public disturbance.\n\n\"Ah, here it is,\" the clerk finally said, bringing up the ticket. \"Issued by Officer Nebulax. You\u2019ll need to speak with the adjudicator.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Lana said, feigning enthusiasm. \"Where do I find them?\"\n\n\"Down the hall, third door on the left,\" the clerk gestured, clearly relieved to pass on the problem.\n\nLana and Benny made their way to the adjudicator\u2019s chamber. The door slid open to reveal a room filled with floating orbs of light, each representing a different case. At the center, a rotund being with a dozen eyes and a jovial smile greeted them.\n\n\"Welcome, Captain Breckenridge!\" the adjudicator boomed, his voice like a chorus of bells. \"I hear you\u2019re contesting a ticket.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Lana replied, trying to sound confident. \"I believe there\u2019s been a misunderstanding.\"\n\nThe adjudicator chuckled, a sound like gentle rain. \"Oh, dear Captain, there\u2019s no misunderstanding. It\u2019s quite simple. Officer Nebulax has been known to play pranks on new FTL travelers.\"\n\nLana blinked, her mouth dropping open. \"A prank?\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" the adjudicator confirmed, his eyes twinkling with amusement. \"Consider it a welcome to the cosmos. Your ticket is void.\"\n\nLana let out a breath she didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d been holding, relief washing over her. \"Thank you,\" she said, shaking her head at the absurdity.\n\n\"Safe travels, Captain,\" the adjudicator said, waving them off with a multitude of hands.\n\nAs Lana and Benny returned to the *Vagabond*, the captain couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the bizarre welcome they\u2019d received. The vastness of space was filled with wonders and absurdities, and she was ready to embrace them all.\n\n\"Well, Cap,\" Benny said as the ship launched back into the starry expanse, \"here\u2019s to more cosmic adventures.\"\n\n\"Let\u2019s just keep an eye on the speedometer this time,\" Lana replied, her heart light with the thrill of the unknown."

        "writing_prompt": "You're granted a wish giving you the power to transform into any animal. You're surprised to find some cryptids, undiscovered species, and . . . sinister things at your selection. The implications are starting to unnerve you.",
        "story": "When the peculiar gentleman in the velvet jacket offered me a wish, I thought he was pulling my leg. Who wouldn\u2019t? But the glint in his eyes screamed mischief, and before I knew it, I blurted out, \u201cI wish I could transform into any animal I want.\u201d\n\nWith a snap of his fingers and a wink, he vanished, leaving me alone with my thoughts. At first, I felt nothing, just the same old me standing in my cluttered apartment. Then I glanced at the mirror, attempting to conjure something simple\u2014a cat perhaps. The world tilted and stretched, and suddenly I was staring at my reflection, now sporting a pair of whiskers and a tail.\n\n\u201cOh, this is going to be fun,\u201d I thought, reveling in my newfound feline agility. I practiced leaping from the couch to the windowsill, each jump more graceful than the last. But curiosity, that ever-persistent feline trait, got the better of me. What else could I become?\n\nI closed my eyes, picturing something more exotic\u2014a majestic eagle soaring high above the clouds. With a flutter, my wings spread wide, and I could feel the wind beneath my feathers. The freedom was intoxicating, the world below a blur of colors. But as I flew, I noticed something peculiar\u2014a sensation of possibilities, lingering at the edges of my mind.\n\nI landed, reverting to my human form, and sat on the park bench pondering my next transformation. \u201cWhy stop at the known?\u201d I mused, thinking of the cryptids and mythical creatures whispered about in hushed tones. Could I really become a dragon? Or better yet, a griffin?\n\nWith a leap of faith, I imagined the legendary creature, scales glimmering in the sunlight, wings casting shadows over mountains. A surge of energy enveloped me, and as I opened my eyes, the startled cries of onlookers confirmed the truth. I was a dragon, albeit a small one, sputtering smoke rather than fire. The park became a scene of chaos, with people running and pointing. I couldn't help but chuckle\u2014a dragon that couldn\u2019t breathe fire was hardly terrifying.\n\nBut then came the unsettling part. As I delved deeper into the reservoir of transformations, I stumbled upon forms that were neither animal nor myth. They were things with too many eyes, limbs that moved in impossible ways, and shadows that whispered secrets. The implications were unnerving. What kind of world had I tapped into? And why did these sinister forms appeal to some hidden corner of my mind?\n\nDetermined to shake off the unease, I reverted to something more familiar\u2014a dog. Who doesn\u2019t love dogs? Trotting down the street, I basked in the affection of strangers, all eager to pet my golden fur. Yet, even amidst the cheerful barks and wagging tails, the sinister possibilities lingered, like a shadow trailing behind me.\n\nI decided to test the boundaries of my power further, imagining a creature from the depths of the ocean\u2014a kraken. As tentacles sprouted from my sides, I realized I hadn\u2019t thought this one through. The living room was no place for a giant sea monster. My grandmother\u2019s china crashed to the floor, and I quickly morphed back, surveying the watery wreckage with a sheepish grin.\n\nIt was then I understood the dual nature of this gift. The transformations were thrilling, but the lurking presence of those sinister creatures whispered a darker truth. I had to be cautious, lest I lose myself in the allure of the unknown.\n\nThe next day, I found myself at the library, pouring over dusty tomes and ancient scrolls, seeking knowledge about these mysterious beings. A librarian with a knowing smile handed me a book titled \u201cCryptids and Other Curiosities.\u201d As I read, my heart raced. The creatures were more than myth; they were echoes of forgotten realms, dangerous and unpredictable.\n\nIn the end, I chose to embrace the whimsical side of my power, leaving the sinister shadows for another day. I spent my afternoons as a squirrel, darting up trees, and my evenings as a wise old owl, watching the world from above. The gentleman in the velvet jacket had given me more than a gift; he\u2019d opened a door to endless adventure.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, one day I\u2019d have the courage to explore the darker corners of my imagination. But until then, the sky was the limit, and I intended to enjoy every moment of my wild, transformative journey."

        "story": "Harold Jenkins, an unassuming accountant by day and a cosmic architect by night, sat across from his therapist with a grin that outshone the fluorescent lighting. The therapist, Dr. Larkwood, adjusted his glasses, trying to decipher the intentions behind Harold\u2019s latest confession.\n\n\"I kicked out my tenants, demolished my 5 million housing units, salted the ground with radioactive matter, and wreaked the sewer system. All in 2 weeks. New York will soon become a wasteland.\" Harold\u2019s voice was casual, as though he were discussing the weather.\n\nDr. Larkwood blinked, his pen hovering over his notebook. \"Why are you telling me this?\" he asked, a hint of disbelief in his voice.\n\n\"Because no one will believe you,\" Harold chuckled, leaning back in his chair. \"After all, who\u2019d believe that a mild-mannered accountant holds the power to bend reality?\"\n\nThe room seemed to ripple for a moment, Dr. Larkwood\u2019s diplomas shifting slightly on the walls. Harold\u2019s eyes glimmered with a hint of iridescent green, betraying the cosmic chaos that simmered beneath his human facade.\n\n\"You know, ever since I discovered I could manipulate reality, I\u2019ve been itching to try something big. Something... transformative,\" Harold mused, tapping his chin thoughtfully. \"Turning New York into a wasteland seemed like a fitting challenge.\"\n\nDr. Larkwood swallowed, trying to maintain his composure. \"But... why New York?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's not personal,\" Harold said, waving his hand dismissively. \"Think of it as a cosmic art project. Besides, it\u2019s the city that never sleeps. I figured it could use a permanent nap.\"\n\nOutside the window, the New York skyline shimmered under an eerie, otherworldly hue. Harold had taken special care to orchestrate the transformation with a touch of whimsy. Radioactive tumbleweeds rolled down Fifth Avenue, and Times Square now displayed cryptic messages in glowing runes only Harold could read.\n\n\"But Harold,\" Dr. Larkwood ventured, \"what about the people? The city\u2019s inhabitants?\"\n\n\"Ah, the people,\" Harold sighed, as though lamenting a minor inconvenience. \"They\u2019re safely relocated to a pocket dimension. I\u2019ve given them front-row seats to watch their city\u2019s grand transformation. It\u2019s quite the spectacle.\"\n\nDr. Larkwood scribbled furiously, trying to process the surreal tale unfolding before him. \"And what do you hope to achieve with all this?\"\n\nHarold leaned forward, his expression shifting to one of childlike excitement. \"I wanted to see if I could do it. It\u2019s not every day you get to test the limits of cosmic power, you know. Besides, I\u2019ve always been a fan of post-apocalyptic aesthetics.\"\n\nThe room filled with a soft hum, and Harold waved his hand, conjuring a miniature hologram of Central Park now overrun by phosphorescent fungi and bioluminescent creatures. \"Isn\u2019t it beautiful?\" he asked, eyes wide with wonder.\n\nDr. Larkwood was at a loss for words. \"Harold, this is... extraordinary. But what\u2019s next? You can\u2019t just leave it like this.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course not,\" Harold agreed. \"This is just phase one. I\u2019m thinking of turning the Hudson River into a giant lava lamp next. The colors would be mesmerizing, don\u2019t you think?\"\n\nThe therapist took a deep breath, trying to regain control of the session. \"Harold, I must ask\u2014what about the authorities? The government? Surely they\u2019ll intervene.\"\n\nHarold laughed, a sound that reverberated with cosmic energy. \"By the time they figure out what\u2019s happening, it\u2019ll be too late. Besides, I\u2019ve woven a little confusion spell around the city. Bureaucracy moves slower than a snail in molasses.\"\n\nDr. Larkwood found himself both terrified and fascinated by Harold\u2019s grandiose scheme. \"And what if you change your mind? If you wanted to undo all this?\"\n\nHarold tapped his temple, a sly smile creeping across his face. \"Ah, that\u2019s the beauty of it, Doc. I can snap my fingers and poof! Everything\u2019s back to normal. But where\u2019s the fun in that?\"\n\nAs the session drew to a close, Dr. Larkwood couldn\u2019t help but admire the audacity of Harold\u2019s cosmic artistry. It was a tale that defied logic and reason, yet in Harold\u2019s world, it made perfect sense.\n\nHarold stood up, straightening his tie. \"Thanks for listening, Doc. I\u2019ll keep you posted on the lava lamp project.\"\n\nAs he left, Dr. Larkwood sat in stunned silence, his mind reeling from the day\u2019s revelations. New York was indeed changing, but perhaps, just perhaps, it was not all for naught. After all, who could resist the allure of a cosmic spectacle, even if it turned the world upside down?"

        "writing_prompt": "You were send to kidnap a loved one of your objective as bait, what you weren't told is that they were a lot more dangerous and lethal than your objective.",
        "story": "Harris never imagined his career as a professional kidnapper would lead him to a quaint cottage on the outskirts of the bustling city of Eldergrove. The mission seemed simple enough: abduct the loved one of the notorious gang leader, Vesper Kane. It was a classic bait-and-switch maneuver, and Harris was confident. After all, he had pulled off trickier jobs with less intel and more risks.\n\nThe file said the target was someone named \"Dotty,\" a harmless old lady who lived alone with her cat, Mr. Whiskers. The plan was to catch her off guard, bundle her into a van, and wait for Vesper to make the inevitable trade-off. Easy peasy.\n\nHarris approached the cozy cottage with its white picket fence and overgrown flowerbeds. He was ready with his usual gear: chloroform, rope, and a sack\u2014a kidnapper\u2019s essentials. But as he tiptoed towards the porch, the air seemed to thrum with an unusual energy. The kind that made the hairs on your neck stand up and whisper, \"Something is not right.\"\n\nHe shook off the feeling and knocked on the door. After a brief shuffling sound, the door swung open, revealing Dotty, who looked every bit the frail, sweet grandmother. Her silver hair was neatly tied in a bun, her glasses perched on her nose, and her floral apron was dusted with flour.\n\n\"Hello, dear,\" she said with a warm smile, \"Can I help you?\"\n\n\u201cUh, yes ma\u2019am,\u201d Harris stammered, momentarily thrown by her grandmotherly aura. \u201cI\u2019m here to\u2026 uh, check your gas meter?\u201d\n\nDotty\u2019s eyes twinkled with a hint of mischief. \u201cOh, I see. Well, come in, come in. But mind Mr. Whiskers, he\u2019s a bit protective.\u201d\n\nHarris nodded, stepping inside, and immediately felt a chill run down his spine. The interior was cluttered with the usual knick-knacks, but something felt off. An odd assortment of ancient runes covered the walls, and a peculiar scent of spices hung in the air.\n\nAs Dotty bustled about, offering tea, Harris tried to assess the situation. He needed to act fast. He moved closer, ready to spring his trap, when Mr. Whiskers, an unassuming tabby, leapt onto the table, knocking over a small vial.\n\nThe room exploded in a flash of light.\n\nWhen Harris regained his senses, he found himself bound to a chair, with Dotty standing over him, her demeanor now anything but grandmotherly. Her eyes glowed with an ethereal light, and her aura was that of a seasoned warrior.\n\n\u201cDid Vesper send you?\u201d she asked, her voice carrying an edge that could slice through steel.\n\n\u201cY-yes,\u201d Harris admitted, struggling against the ropes. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were\u2026 well, like this.\u201d\n\nDotty chuckled, a sound that sent shivers down his spine. \u201cOh, you poor thing. Vesper always did underestimate me. You see, I\u2019m not just Dotty. I\u2019m Dotty the Dreaded, once the most feared sorceress in all the realms.\u201d\n\nHarris blinked. \u201cThe Dreaded?\u201d\n\nShe nodded, pouring him a cup of tea as if they were merely discussing the weather. \u201cRetired, of course. But I do enjoy a bit of excitement now and then.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, what now?\u201d Harris asked, trying to maintain some semblance of dignity.\n\nDotty tapped her chin thoughtfully. \u201cWell, I suppose I could let you go. After all, you\u2019re just doing your job. But first, I think I\u2019ll have a little fun.\u201d\n\nWith a flick of her wrist, Harris found himself floating, the ropes dissolving into thin air. He landed with a thud, scrambling to his feet.\n\nDotty grinned. \u201cCatch me if you can, dear.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was a series of comedic and chaotic encounters throughout the cottage. Harris found himself dodging enchanted brooms, sidestepping teapots that spat scalding liquid, and avoiding carpets that tried to swallow him whole. All the while, Dotty moved gracefully, orchestrating the chaos with a gleeful cackle.\n\nAt one point, Harris found himself cornered by Mr. Whiskers, who had transformed into a miniature tiger. The feline growled, swiping at him with oversized paws.\n\n\u201cAlright, alright!\u201d Harris shouted, hands up in surrender. \u201cYou win! I\u2019ll leave!\u201d\n\nDotty clapped her hands, the chaos ceasing as quickly as it had begun. \u201cOh, that was delightful! You\u2019re quite spry for a kidnapper.\u201d\n\nHarris panted, catching his breath. \u201cThanks, I think?\u201d\n\nDotty approached, her eyes softening. \u201cYou know, Vesper might be a gang leader, but he\u2019s still family. Next time, perhaps consider a career change? One less dangerous.\u201d\n\nWith a wave, she opened the door, and Harris stumbled out, grateful to be alive. As he made his way back to the city, he couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all.\n\nFrom that day on, Harris decided to try his hand at something less perilous. Maybe accounting. As for Dotty, well, she continued to enjoy her quiet life, with the occasional thrill, of course. And Mr. Whiskers? He went back to being an ordinary tabby\u2014mostly."
