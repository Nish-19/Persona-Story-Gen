        "story": "The council chamber buzzed with cosmic energy, the walls adorned with shifting constellations that seemed to whisper ancient secrets. I stood in the center, feeling the weight of a thousand eons pressing down on me. The council members, each a figure of immense power and wisdom, gazed down from their elevated positions. Their eyes glowed with the light of a billion stars, and their presence felt like the gravitational pull of a black hole.\n\n\"To classify as one of us, you must be immortal and have lived through a rebirth of a universe,\" the council declared in unison, their voices resonating like a supernova. \"From what we see, you merely cheated and ended your universe without letting it reborn.\"\n\nI clenched my fists, feeling a surge of frustration. \"I didn\u2019t cheat,\" I protested, my voice echoing in the vast chamber. \"I did what I had to do to survive.\"\n\nA council member, her form shimmering like the aurora borealis, leaned forward. \"Survival is not enough,\" she said, her tone icy. \"You must prove your immortality and experience the cyclical nature of existence.\"\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves. \"You don't understand,\" I began, my voice softer now. \"It's been eons since I last saw another being. The stars have become my only companions. The void between universes is a place of profound isolation.\"\n\nThe council members exchanged glances, their expressions inscrutable. The one who had spoken first, a being with eyes like twin supernovas, spoke again. \"Show us your journey,\" he commanded. \"Let us see the truth.\"\n\nI closed my eyes, summoning the memories of my long and arduous journey. The chamber faded away, and I found myself floating in the void, a place where time and space seemed to stand still. The silence was deafening, the stars' whispers barely audible.\n\nIt's been eons since I last saw another being, I thought. The stars have become my only companions.\n\nAbruptly, I was standing on the surface of a barren planet, its once vibrant landscape reduced to desolation. I remembered the feeling of crushing loneliness, the despair that gnawed at my soul. I had wandered across countless worlds, each more desolate than the last, searching for any sign of life.\n\nThen, without warning, I was engulfed by a supernova, the heat and light searing through me. I felt my very essence being torn apart, only to be reformed in the aftermath. It was a rebirth, a cycle of destruction and creation that I had endured countless times.\n\nAnother universe, another chance, I thought, the phrase echoing in my mind.\n\nI was back in the council chamber, the memories still vivid in my mind. \"I've lived through the rebirth of a universe,\" I said, my voice steady. \"I've experienced the cyclical nature of existence.\"\n\nA council member, his form crackling with cosmic energy, leaned forward. \"Prove it,\" he said, his voice a challenge.\n\nI raised my hand, summoning a small fragment of cosmic energy. It danced in my palm, a miniature universe in itself. \"This is a piece of my journey,\" I said, my voice filled with determination. \"A fragment of the countless cycles I've endured.\"\n\nThe council members murmured among themselves, their expressions thoughtful. The one with eyes like twin supernovas spoke again. \"Your journey is impressive,\" he admitted. \"But it is not enough. You must prove your worth in a different way.\"\n\nI felt a surge of anger. \"What more do you want?\" I demanded. \"I've endured isolation, destruction, and rebirth. I've proven my immortality.\"\n\nA council member, her form shifting like a nebula, spoke softly. \"You must show us your strength,\" she said. \"Demonstrate your power and resilience.\"\n\nI took a deep breath, focusing my energy. The chamber around me seemed to warp and twist as I summoned a cosmic energy blast. I directed it at a distant target, obliterating it in a burst of light.\n\nThe council members nodded, their expressions approving. \"You have proven your strength,\" the one with eyes like twin supernovas said. \"But strength alone is not enough. You must also show compassion and wisdom.\"\n\nI closed my eyes, thinking of the countless beings I had encountered on my journey. I had helped them, guided them, and learned from them. I had grown wiser with each cycle, understanding the delicate balance of the universe.\n\n\"I have compassion and wisdom,\" I said, opening my eyes. \"I've learned from my experiences and grown stronger because of them.\"\n\nThe council members exchanged glances, their expressions unreadable. Finally, the one with eyes like twin supernovas spoke. \"You have proven yourself,\" he said. \"You are one of us.\"\n\nI felt a surge of relief and pride. I had finally achieved what I had sought for eons. I was immortal, a being of cosmic power and wisdom. And I had earned my place among the council."

        "writing_prompt": "They say the stars have chosen this man to lead. But you know better; this man is no leader, and, if the stars have given the omen, then they have misaligned. You can't \u2014 you *won't* allow him to take what you have built and run it into the ground for the sake of his endless ambition.",
        "story": "I stared at the night sky, the stars twinkling in their eternal dance, a cruel mockery of fate. They said the stars had chosen him. YEAH, RIGHT, like the stars really chose him. The thought made me scoff. I knew better. That man was no leader. If the stars truly gave the omen, then they had misaligned in the most disastrous way possible.\n\nI took a deep breath, the cold air of the secluded observatory filling my lungs. This place, perched high on a mountain, had been my sanctuary for months. The mountain pass here collects the snow during Winter. We essentially get cut off from the world for 6 months out of the year. Perfect for isolation, perfect for contemplation. Perfect for planning how to stop him.\n\nI turned to the group of allies gathered around me, their faces illuminated by the flickering candlelight. \"Welcome to the Hidden Archive,\" I said, my voice echoing in the musty room filled with old books and star charts. \"This is where we will find the answers, where we will understand the omens and the dangers of his ambition.\"\n\nKylain, a loyal friend, raised an eyebrow. \"You really think the stars are in on it?\"\n\nI chuckled, a bitter sound. \"Oh, I'm sure the stars have a sense of humor. But no, I believe they're just as misaligned as everything else in this world.\" I walked over to a large, dusty tome and flipped it open, revealing intricate diagrams of constellations. \"We've got to figure out how to realign them, or at least, figure out how to prevent his rise.\"\n\nValorie, ever the skeptic, crossed her arms. \"And what if we can't? What if he's truly meant to lead?\"\n\nI paused, the weight of her question settling over me. \"Then we're all doomed,\" I said quietly. \"But I refuse to accept that. We can't trust the stars anymore. We have to trust ourselves.\"\n\nFor months, I had poured over these charts, looking for any sign, any clue that could help us. I had spent countless sleepless nights in this observatory, the machine crackling in the background like it was judging my lack of words. The isolation, the solitude, it had taken its toll on me. But I couldn't stop. I wouldn't stop.\n\nAnother sleepless night, another night lost to the stars. I wandered through the empty halls, my thoughts drifting to the false leader. His arrogance, his endless ambition. The thought of him leading was killing me. I couldn't let it happen. I couldn't let him take what we had built and run it into the ground.\n\nI found myself in the grand hall, the walls lined with star charts. It was here that I had my first realization. The stars weren't just misaligned; they were warning us. I had to convey this to my allies, to make them understand the stakes.\n\nThe next day, I gathered them in the grand hall. \"Look at these charts,\" I said, pointing to the constellations. \"These aren't just random patterns. They're omens, warnings. If he rises to power, it could mean societal collapse, personal loss for all of us.\"\n\nI could see the doubt in their eyes, but also a glimmer of understanding. \"So, what do we do?\" Ishaan asked, his voice trembling slightly.\n\n\"We prepare,\" I replied, determination hardening my resolve. \"We practice, we plan. We can't afford any missteps. Our future depends on it.\"\n\nDays turned into weeks, and we trained relentlessly. I could feel the weight of responsibility pressing down on me, the anxiety gnawing at my insides. But I pushed through, knowing that any misstep could lead to disaster. \n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the observatory, I found myself in a mysterious chamber. A hidden door had led me here, to a room with a black tiled floor and pure red velvet curtains. The atmosphere was surreal, introspective.\n\nIn the center of the room stood a vision of the false leader, his eyes filled with a smug confidence. \"You think you can stop me?\" he sneered.\n\n\"I know I can,\" I retorted, my voice steady. \"Because I am a leader. It was never about YOU.\"\n\nThe vision wavered, then disappeared, leaving me alone with my thoughts. The encounter had solidified my resolve. I couldn't let him win. I had to protect what we had built.\n\nAs I left the chamber, I felt a sense of clarity wash over me. The stars might have misaligned, but I wouldn't. I would fight, I would resist, and I would ensure that the false leader's ambition would never come to fruition.\n\nThe path ahead was uncertain, but one thing was clear: I wouldn't allow him to take what we had built. Not now, not ever."

        "story": "\"Don't press the button.\"\n\n\"This button?\"\n\n\"No, this one-oh.\"\n\nAnd just like that, I was gone.\n\nI found myself standing on a floating island, surrounded by clouds that glowed with an eerie blue light. A gust of wind nearly knocked me off my feet, and I clung to the nearest tree\u2014a gnarled, twisted thing with leaves that shimmered like silver. Well, this is just great, I thought. Another day, another accidental adventure through the surreal.\n\n\"Welcome, traveler,\" a voice said from behind me. I turned to see a figure cloaked in shadows, his face obscured by a hood. \"I am your guide.\"\n\n\"Right,\" I said, brushing off the dirt from my jeans. \"And you're going to tell me what this place is?\"\n\n\"Indeed. This is the Island of Lost Time,\" the guide said, his voice echoing as if it came from the depths of a cave. \"Each location you visit will reflect a part of your inner struggle. Pressing the button has consequences, as you will soon discover.\"\n\n\"Great, just what I needed,\" I muttered. \"Another cryptic guide in another bizarre world.\"\n\nThe guide ignored my sarcasm and continued, \"You must confront the challenges in each place to understand your true self. Only then can you find your way back.\"\n\n\"Fantastic,\" I said. \"Let's get this over with.\"\n\nWith a wave of his hand, the guide vanished, leaving me alone on the floating island. I wandered aimlessly, the clouds parting to reveal other islands in the distance, each with its own unique landscape. I felt a strange sense of isolation, the weight of my actions pressing down on me. What had I done by pressing that button?\n\nTime seemed to stretch and blur as I walked. Eventually, I came across a small pedestal with a button on it. The button was red and shiny, practically begging to be pressed. I hesitated, my finger hovering over it. What if this just made things worse?\n\n\"Another button, another world,\" I whispered to myself. With a deep breath, I pressed it.\n\nIn an instant, I was transported to a room filled with clocks. They covered every inch of the walls, their incessant ticking creating a cacophony that echoed in my ears. I felt a sense of urgency, as if time itself was slipping away from me. In the center of the room stood the guide, his hood still obscuring his face.\n\n\"Time is a precious commodity,\" he said. \"How you spend it defines who you are. Do you waste it, or do you use it wisely?\"\n\nI stared at him, my mind racing. \"I don't know,\" I admitted. \"I feel like I'm always running out of time, like there's never enough of it.\"\n\nThe guide nodded. \"You must confront your fear of time slipping away. Only then can you find peace.\"\n\nBefore I could respond, the room began to dissolve around me. I found myself standing in a vast desert, the sun beating down on me mercilessly. In the distance, I saw a single tree, its branches bare and twisted. I trudged through the sand, my feet sinking with each step.\n\nAs I approached the tree, I saw another button on the ground beneath it. This one was green, blending in with the sparse patches of grass. I knelt down, my fingers trembling. What if this took me somewhere even worse?\n\n\"Another button, another world,\" I said, pressing it.\n\nThis time, I found myself in a dojo. The walls were lined with weapons, and the air was thick with the scent of incense. A group of students practiced their martial arts, their movements fluid and precise. I watched them for a moment, feeling a pang of nostalgia. I had trained in a dojo like this when I was younger, before life had gotten so complicated.\n\n\"Discipline and focus,\" the guide's voice echoed through the room. \"These are the keys to mastering oneself.\"\n\nI turned to see him standing beside me, his hood still concealing his face. \"I used to be disciplined,\" I said quietly. \"But somewhere along the way, I lost it.\"\n\n\"You can find it again,\" the guide said. \"But you must first confront your inner turmoil.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a sense of determination. \"How?\"\n\n\"By facing your fears head-on,\" the guide replied. \"Only then can you regain control.\"\n\nThe dojo began to fade, and I found myself back on the floating island. The clouds had darkened, and the wind had picked up, howling around me. I felt a sense of urgency, as if time was running out.\n\n\"Another button, another world,\" I whispered, pressing the button on the pedestal once more.\n\nThis time, I found myself in a room filled with mirrors. Each reflection showed a different version of myself, some younger, some older. I walked through the room, my eyes darting from one reflection to another. I saw the boy who had trained in the dojo, the teenager who had wasted time, and the adult who had lost his way.\n\n\"Who are you?\" the guide's voice echoed through the room.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said, my voice trembling. \"I don't know who I am anymore.\"\n\n\"You are all of these,\" the guide said. \"But you must choose which version of yourself you want to be.\"\n\nI stared at my reflections, feeling a sense of clarity. \"I want to be the best version of myself,\" I said firmly. \"The one who is disciplined, focused, and uses time wisely.\"\n\n\"Then embrace it,\" the guide said. \"And press the button one last time.\"\n\nI walked to the center of the room, where a final button awaited me. This one was gold, shimmering in the dim light. I took a deep breath and pressed it.\n\nIn an instant, I was back in my own world, standing in front of the original button. The guide's voice echoed in my mind, \"Remember what you have learned. Use it to shape your future.\"\n\nI took a deep breath, feeling a sense of determination. I wouldn't waste any more time. I would embrace discipline and focus, and become the best version of myself.\n\nAs I walked away, I couldn't help but smile. \"Another button, another world,\" I whispered. \"But this time, I'm in control.\""

        "story": "\u201cThat was a simple curse for our interrogation, you can no longer lie.\u201d\n\nI blinked, trying to process the words. \u201cThat is evil, especially because I lie so often, like when I said your shirt looked nice but I actually thought it was ugly as hell.\u201d\n\nThe interrogator raised an eyebrow. \u201cOversharing is not a part of the curse, that is just you.\u201d\n\nI groaned, feeling the weight of the curse settling in. The room around me was stark and clinical, the cold metal chair I was strapped to only adding to my discomfort. The fluorescent light above flickered intermittently, casting harsh shadows across the room. My mind raced, trying to find a way out of this mess.\n\n\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d I asked, my voice trembling slightly.\n\nThe interrogator, a tall man with a stern expression and piercing blue eyes, leaned forward. \u201cYou\u2019re here because you have information we need. Information you\u2019ve been hiding.\u201d\n\nI swallowed hard. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\n\u201cLies won\u2019t work on me anymore,\u201d he said, a cruel smile playing on his lips. \u201cSo, let\u2019s start with something simple. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\nI opened my mouth to lie, but the curse kicked in. \u201cEvelyn,\u201d I muttered, cursing myself internally. \n\n\u201cGood. Now, what were you doing at the docks last night?\u201d\n\nMy mind flashed back to the previous night, the clandestine meeting, the exchange of information. I tried to resist, but the curse forced the truth out of me. \u201cI was meeting with a contact. We were discussing plans for an upcoming operation.\u201d\n\nThe interrogator\u2019s smile widened. \u201cSee, that wasn\u2019t so hard, was it?\u201d\n\nI clenched my fists, the restraints biting into my skin. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re doing,\u201d I spat. \u201cThis curse... it\u2019s not just about lying. It\u2019s about control.\u201d\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, studying me. \u201cTell me more.\u201d\n\nI hesitated, but the words spilled out of me regardless. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that I can\u2019t lie. It\u2019s that I can\u2019t stop talking. Everything, every little thought, it just... comes out.\u201d\n\nHis eyes gleamed with interest. \u201cInteresting. So, you\u2019re saying that this curse not only prevents you from lying but also compels you to speak the truth at all times?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said through gritted teeth. \u201cAnd it\u2019s driving me insane.\u201d\n\nThe interrogator stood up and walked around the room, his footsteps echoing off the walls. \u201cWell, Evelyn, I think we\u2019re going to have a very productive session.\u201d\n\nI watched him warily as he approached a table covered in various interrogation tools. He picked up a small, silver device and turned it over in his hands. \u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d\n\nI shook my head, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\n\u201cThis is a truth serum,\u201d he said, holding it up for me to see. \u201cBut given your current predicament, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need it.\u201d\n\nHe set the device back down and returned to his chair. \u201cNow, let\u2019s get to the heart of the matter. Who are you working for?\u201d\n\nThe answer was on the tip of my tongue, but I fought to keep it in. The curse, however, had other plans. \u201cThe Resistance,\u201d I blurted out, feeling a surge of panic.\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d the interrogator said, leaning forward once more. \u201cAnd what is your role within the Resistance?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a strategist,\u201d I said, unable to stop myself. \u201cI plan operations, coordinate with other cells, gather intelligence.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, taking notes on a small pad of paper. \u201cAnd what are your current plans?\u201d\n\nI bit my lip, trying to hold back, but it was no use. \u201cWe\u2019re planning a raid on the government\u2019s weapons depot. We need supplies, and it\u2019s the only way to get them.\u201d\n\nThe interrogator\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhen is this raid supposed to take place?\u201d\n\nMy mind screamed at me to stop, but the curse forced the words out. \u201cTomorrow night. Midnight.\u201d\n\nHe smiled, satisfied with the information. \u201cThank you, Evelyn. You\u2019ve been very helpful.\u201d\n\nI slumped in my chair, feeling defeated. The curse had stripped me of my ability to resist, to protect my comrades. I had betrayed them all with my uncontrollable honesty.\n\nThe interrogator stood up and walked to the door, opening it slightly. \u201cGuards, take her back to her cell,\u201d he ordered.\n\nTwo burly guards entered the room and unstrapped me from the chair. They led me down a long, dimly lit corridor, the walls lined with doors leading to other interrogation rooms. I could hear the faint sounds of other prisoners being questioned, their cries of pain and desperation echoing through the hall.\n\nAs we walked, my mind raced, trying to come up with a plan. I couldn\u2019t let the Resistance\u2019s plans be thwarted because of me. I needed to warn them, to find a way to communicate the danger.\n\nThe guards threw me into a small, windowless cell and slammed the door shut. I sat on the cold, hard floor, my thoughts swirling in a chaotic mess. The silence was deafening, and my thoughts were my only company.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long I sat there, my mind drifting in and out of focus. Time seemed to stretch and warp, the minutes blending into hours. The curse weighed heavily on me, the compulsion to speak the truth gnawing at my sanity.\n\nJust when I thought I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, the door to my cell creaked open. A figure stepped inside, cloaked in shadow. I squinted, trying to make out their features.\n\n\u201cEvelyn,\u201d a familiar voice whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\n\nMy heart leaped in my chest. It was Marcus, one of my closest friends and a fellow member of the Resistance. \u201cMarcus, how did you find me?\u201d\n\nHe knelt beside me, his eyes filled with concern. \u201cWe have our ways. Are you okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted, feeling the curse compel me to speak. \u201cI\u2019m not okay. I told them everything, Marcus. The raid, our plans... everything.\u201d\n\nHe placed a reassuring hand on my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Evelyn. We know about the curse. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nI looked at him, hope flickering in my chest. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to get you out,\u201d he said, a determined glint in his eyes. \u201cAnd to stop the raid. We can\u2019t let them win.\u201d\n\nTears welled up in my eyes as I realized I wasn\u2019t alone. Despite the curse, despite my betrayal, my friends hadn\u2019t given up on me. \u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered.\n\nHe smiled, helping me to my feet. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We have work to do.\u201d\n\nAs we made our way out of the facility, I felt a renewed sense of purpose. The curse may have taken away my ability to lie, but it hadn\u2019t taken away my resolve. We would fight back, and we would win.\n\nAnd this time, I wouldn\u2019t let anything stand in our way."

        "story": "Another night, another hunt. I rubbed my temples, trying to block out the relentless groans echoing through the empty streets. Zombies. God, they were everywhere. I ducked behind a decrepit newsstand and peered around the corner. Three of them shuffled aimlessly, their rotting flesh hanging in tatters. \n\n\"Great, another zombie. Just what I needed,\" I muttered under my breath. \"Zombies are like stale bread\u2014no flavor and hard to chew.\"\n\nThe real problem wasn\u2019t avoiding zombies. They were slow and predictable, like clockwork. The real issue was finding a fresh meal. The apocalypse had made humans a rare commodity, and the few that were left were either holed up in fortified shelters or half-insane from the constant fear of being eaten.\n\nI moved through the city, the stench of decay clinging to the air like an unwanted guest. My heightened senses picked up faint heartbeats from a distance, but most were too faint, too sickly. I needed something more... robust.\n\nThe city was a wasteland, a reflection of my own hollow existence. Once vibrant streets now lay desolate, littered with debris and the occasional gnawed bone. I passed a crumbling theater, its marquee still advertising a film from a time when the biggest worry was being late for a date. \n\nI rounded another corner, and there it was\u2014a small group of survivors. They had made camp in an old school gymnasium, of all places. Their barricades were impressive, but not impenetrable. \n\nI approached cautiously, blending into the shadows. The gym was eerily silent, save for the occasional murmur of conversation. I watched as they practiced self-defense, their movements precise and deliberate. They were a resilient bunch, I\u2019d give them that.\n\nAs I observed, a sharp pang of hunger reminded me why I was here. I needed to feed, but the thought of attacking these people filled me with a sense of guilt. They were survivors, fighting to maintain their humanity in a world overrun by death. \n\nI shook off the sentiment. Sentiment was a luxury I couldn\u2019t afford. \n\nSlipping into the gym, I moved silently, my eyes scanning for the healthiest target. There\u2014a young man, his heartbeat steady and strong. He was practicing with a makeshift weapon, completely unaware of my presence.\n\nI approached, my movements fluid and silent. Just as I was about to strike, a voice interrupted me.\n\n\"Hey, what do you think you're doing?\" \n\nI spun around to face a woman, her eyes blazing with defiance. She held a wooden staff, poised to strike.\n\n\"Relax,\" I said, raising my hands in a placating gesture. \"I'm not here to hurt anyone.\"\n\n\"Could\u2019ve fooled me,\" she shot back, not lowering her weapon.\n\nI sighed. \"Look, I'm just trying to survive, same as you.\"\n\nHer eyes narrowed. \"You're a vampire, aren't you?\"\n\nI nodded, not seeing the point in lying. \"Yes, and I need to feed.\"\n\nShe glanced at the young man I had been eyeing. \"Not him. Take me instead.\"\n\nI blinked, taken aback. \"What?\"\n\n\"You heard me,\" she said firmly. \"Take me.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I asked, genuinely curious.\n\n\"Because he's the best fighter we've got. We need him more than we need me.\"\n\nI studied her, my hunger warring with a newfound respect. \"You're willing to sacrifice yourself for him?\"\n\nShe nodded, her expression resolute. \"Yes.\"\n\nA strange feeling stirred within me. It had been centuries since I had seen such selflessness. \"Alright,\" I said slowly. \"But not here. Follow me.\"\n\nShe hesitated, then nodded. I led her away from the gym, to a secluded alley. As we walked, I couldn't help but admire her courage.\n\n\"What's your name?\" I asked.\n\n\"Elena,\" she replied.\n\n\"Elena,\" I repeated, committing it to memory. \"Thank you.\"\n\nShe looked at me, surprised. \"For what?\"\n\n\"For reminding me that there's still humanity left in this world.\"\n\nWith that, I sank my fangs into her neck, drinking deeply. Her blood was rich and warm, a stark contrast to the lifelessness around us. As I fed, I felt a surge of vitality, a reminder of what it meant to be alive.\n\nWhen I was done, I laid her gently on the ground. \"Rest now,\" I whispered.\n\nI stood up, feeling stronger than I had in years. The encounter had given me more than just sustenance\u2014it had given me hope. Hope that even in a world overrun by death, there was still life worth fighting for.\n\nAs I made my way back through the city, I repeated the phrase in my mind. Another night, another hunt. But tonight, I had found more than just a meal. I had found a reason to keep going.\n\n\"Maybe the zombies aren't the worst thing after all,\" I mused aloud. \"It's the loss of humanity that's the real killer.\"\n\nWith that thought, I disappeared into the shadows, ready to face another night in this desolate world."
