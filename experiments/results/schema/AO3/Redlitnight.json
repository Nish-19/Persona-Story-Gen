        "story": "The first rays of dawn painted their bedroom in soft hues of gold and pink, the kind of light that made everything seem just a little more magical. Will Solace stirred, his senses slowly coming to life as he became aware of the warmth beside him. Nico di Angelo, the love of his life, was still sound asleep, his dark hair a tousled mess against the pillow.\n\nWill smiled, his heart swelling with affection. He gently brushed a stray lock of hair from Nico's forehead, earning a sleepy mumble in response. \"Morning, sunshine,\" Will whispered, pressing a tender kiss to Nico's temple.\n\nNico's eyes fluttered open, a small smile tugging at the corners of his lips. \"Morning,\" he replied, his voice thick with sleep. \"You're up early.\"\n\n\"I couldn't resist watching you sleep,\" Will teased, earning a playful swat from Nico. \"Plus, I have a busy day at the infirmary. Figured I'd get a head start.\"\n\nNico stretched, his muscles protesting the movement. \"You always have a busy day at the infirmary,\" he said, but his tone was affectionate. \"You need to take it easy, Will.\"\n\nWill chuckled, pressing a quick kiss to Nico's lips. \"I'll try,\" he promised. \"But first, we need to get out of bed.\"\n\nNico groaned dramatically, pulling the covers over his head. \"Five more minutes,\" he pleaded, his voice muffled.\n\n\"Nope,\" Will said, his tone firm but playful. \"We have a routine to stick to, remember?\"\n\nTheir mornings were a cherished ritual: laughter, kisses, and the occasional battle to get out of bed. It was their way of starting the day on a positive note, no matter what challenges lay ahead.\n\nBut today, as Nico peeked out from under the covers, a mischievous glint in his eyes, Will sensed that something was different. \"What are you plotting, di Angelo?\" he asked, raising an eyebrow.\n\nNico's smile widened. \"I was thinking,\" he began, his voice taking on a thoughtful tone. \"What if we changed things up a bit?\"\n\nWill's curiosity was piqued. \"Changed things up how?\" he asked, leaning in closer.\n\nNico sat up, the covers pooling around his waist. \"You know how we always rush through breakfast because we're running late?\" he said. \"What if we took a little more time in the mornings? Made breakfast together, maybe even went for a walk before you head to the infirmary?\"\n\nWill considered this, his mind racing with the possibilities. \"You mean... slow down a bit?\" he asked, a smile creeping onto his face.\n\n\"Exactly,\" Nico said, his eyes shining with excitement. \"I think it could be good for us. A way to start the day feeling more connected, less rushed.\"\n\nWill felt a surge of warmth in his chest. \"I love it,\" he said, pulling Nico into a tight embrace. \"Let's do it.\"\n\nThe next morning, they woke up with the first light, just as they always did. But instead of their usual routine of hurried kisses and quick goodbyes, they took their time. They made pancakes together, laughing as they flipped them in the pan. They talked about their dreams and plans for the day, savoring each moment.\n\nAfter breakfast, they went for a walk in the early morning light, hand in hand. The world seemed to slow down around them, and for the first time in a long time, they felt truly present.\n\nAs they returned home, Will knew that Nico's suggestion had changed their routine forever. It was a small change, but it made a world of difference. They felt more connected, more in tune with each other.\n\nAnd as they shared one last kiss before Will headed to the infirmary, he knew that no matter what the day brought, they would face it together, one slow, meaningful morning at a time."

        "writing_prompt": "Your partner insists you can look through their phone anytime, but when you do, you discover a collection of candid photos of yourself\u2014each one capturing a moment you didn\u2019t even realize was special.",
        "story": "Percy had never been one to pry. He trusted Nico implicitly, but when Nico casually mentioned he could look through his phone whenever he wanted, Percy was intrigued. It was one of those lazy Sunday afternoons, the kind where time seemed to stretch endlessly, and curiosity got the better of him.\n\nNico was napping on the couch, the soft rise and fall of his chest almost hypnotic. Percy quietly picked up Nico's phone from the coffee table, feeling a mix of excitement and guilt. He unlocked it easily\u2014Nico had given him the passcode ages ago\u2014and began to scroll through the gallery.\n\nThe first few photos were what Percy expected: selfies of Nico, pictures of their friends, snapshots from various demigod quests. But then he stumbled upon a folder labeled \"Perseus.\" His heart skipped a beat. He opened it with a mix of anticipation and trepidation.\n\nThe first photo was of Percy at the beach, his back to the camera, gazing out at the horizon. He remembered that day vaguely\u2014it was one of their spontaneous trips to Montauk. He had been lost in thought, feeling the weight of the world momentarily lift as he stared at the endless sea.\n\nThe next photo showed Percy laughing, his eyes crinkling with genuine mirth. He recognized the scene: it was taken during Annabeth and Piper's joint birthday party. He had been recounting a particularly ridiculous quest mishap, and everyone had been in stitches. Percy smiled, feeling warmth spread through his chest.\n\nPhoto after photo, Percy found himself reliving moments he had either forgotten or hadn't realized were being captured. There was one of him reading a book under the shade of a tree in Central Park, another of him cooking breakfast\u2014pancakes, his specialty, with a grin on his face and flour smudged on his cheek.\n\nOne photo, in particular, caught him off guard. It was of him asleep, tangled in the sheets, with Nico's hand gently brushing a strand of hair from his forehead. Percy had no recollection of this moment, but the tenderness in Nico's gesture was palpable.\n\nPercy glanced over at Nico, still peacefully napping, and felt a surge of emotion. These photos weren't just candid snapshots; they were Nico's way of preserving the moments that mattered to him, the moments that made up their life together. It was Nico's silent love letter, captured through the lens of his phone.\n\nHe continued scrolling, finding even more gems: Percy playing fetch with Mrs. O'Leary, his face lighting up with pure joy; Percy concentrating fiercely while attempting to assemble a piece of IKEA furniture, Nico's amused reflection visible in a nearby mirror; Percy and Nico's hands intertwined, a simple yet profound testament to their bond.\n\nTears welled up in Percy's eyes as he realized the depth of Nico's affection. Each photo was a testament to the love and admiration Nico held for him, capturing not just Percy, but the essence of who he was in those unguarded moments.\n\nGently, Percy set the phone down and moved to sit beside Nico. He brushed a kiss on Nico's forehead, causing him to stir and open his eyes groggily.\n\n\"Hey,\" Nico mumbled, a sleepy smile forming on his lips. \"What're you doing?\"\n\nPercy wrapped his arms around Nico, holding him close. \"I was looking through your phone,\" he admitted softly. \"I found the photos.\"\n\nNico's eyes widened slightly, a blush creeping up his cheeks. \"Oh. I didn't mean for you to find those.\"\n\nPercy shook his head, his voice thick with emotion. \"They're beautiful, Nico. I didn't realize... you see me in a way I never even see myself.\"\n\nNico's blush deepened, but he smiled, a tender, loving smile that made Percy's heart swell. \"That's because I love you, Seaweed Brain.\"\n\nPercy leaned in, capturing Nico's lips in a gentle kiss. \"I love you too, Death Boy. Thank you for showing me... us.\"\n\nAs they settled back into the couch, wrapped in each other's arms, Percy knew that every candid photo, every stolen moment, was a piece of their love story\u2014one that would continue to unfold, frame by frame."
