        "writing_prompt": "Every morning, Will Solace wakes up next to Nico di Angelo, the love of his life, and every morning begins with laughter, kisses, and the occasional battle to get out of bed\u2014until one day, Nico suggests something that changes their routine forever.",
        "story": "The sun filtered through the curtains, casting a warm, golden glow over the cozy bedroom. Will Solace stirred, blinking sleepily as he turned over to find Nico di Angelo snuggled up against him, his dark hair a stark contrast to the white pillows. Will couldn\u2019t help but smile, pressing a gentle kiss to Nico\u2019s forehead.\n\n\u201cMorning, Sunshine,\u201d Will whispered, his voice still thick with sleep.\n\nNico mumbled something incoherent, burrowing deeper into Will\u2019s chest. He could feel the soft rise and fall of Nico\u2019s breath, the steady rhythm that had become the heartbeat of his mornings. \n\n\u201cDo we really have to get up?\u201d Nico groaned, his voice muffled by the blankets.\n\n\u201cYes, we do,\u201d Will chuckled, running his fingers through Nico\u2019s hair. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a big day ahead. Besides, I promised Chiron I\u2019d help with the infirmary today.\u201d\n\nNico peeked up at him, his dark eyes filled with sleepy affection. \u201cCan\u2019t we just stay here a little longer? Five more minutes?\u201d\n\nWill sighed dramatically, though his heart swelled with love. \u201cAlright, five more minutes. But only because you\u2019re cute.\u201d\n\nNico grinned, his smile lighting up his entire face. They lay there in comfortable silence, the only sounds the soft rustle of the sheets and the distant chirping of birds outside. Will traced lazy patterns on Nico\u2019s back, savoring the quiet intimacy of the moment.\n\n\u201cWill,\u201d Nico said suddenly, his tone thoughtful.\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Will replied, curious.\n\n\u201cWhat if we changed things up a bit?\u201d Nico suggested, propping himself up on one elbow to look at Will.\n\nWill raised an eyebrow. \u201cChanged things up how?\u201d\n\nNico hesitated for a moment, then took a deep breath. \u201cWhat if we tried waking up earlier and going for a run together? Before everyone else is up. It could be our thing.\u201d\n\nWill blinked in surprise. Nico wasn\u2019t exactly known for being a morning person, let alone someone who enjoyed physical exercise. But the idea intrigued him. It was something new, something they could share.\n\n\u201cA morning run, huh?\u201d Will mused. \u201cI never pegged you for a runner.\u201d\n\nNico rolled his eyes playfully. \u201cI\u2019m not, but I think it could be fun. Plus, it means more time together before the chaos of the day starts.\u201d\n\nWill considered it, imagining the two of them jogging through the camp as the sun rose, the world still quiet and peaceful. It sounded\u2026 perfect.\n\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s do it,\u201d Will agreed, a grin spreading across his face. \u201cBut don\u2019t blame me if you regret it after the first mile.\u201d\n\nNico laughed, the sound warm and rich. \u201cDeal.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, Will awoke to the soft beeping of an alarm clock. He blinked groggily, realizing it was still dark outside. Beside him, Nico was already sitting up, stretching his arms above his head.\n\n\u201cReady for our run?\u201d Nico asked, a mischievous glint in his eyes.\n\nWill groaned but couldn\u2019t help the smile that tugged at his lips. \u201cI guess so.\u201d\n\nThey laced up their running shoes and quietly slipped out of the cabin, the cool morning air a sharp contrast to the warmth of their bed. As they started their run, the first rays of sunlight began to peek over the horizon, bathing the camp in a soft, golden light.\n\nThey ran side by side, their breaths mingling in the crisp air, the world around them waking up slowly. It was peaceful, almost magical. And in that moment, Will realized that this new routine, this shared experience, was exactly what they needed.\n\nBy the time they returned to their cabin, flushed and breathless, Will felt more alive than ever. They collapsed onto the bed, laughing and panting, their hearts pounding in unison.\n\n\u201cBest idea ever,\u201d Will declared, pulling Nico into a sweaty, exuberant kiss.\n\nNico smiled against his lips. \u201cI\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d\n\nAnd just like that, their mornings were forever changed, filled with new adventures and endless love."

        "writing_prompt": "Your partner insists you can look through their phone anytime, but when you do, you discover a collection of candid photos of yourself\u2014each one capturing a moment you didn\u2019t even realize was special.",
        "story": "The late afternoon sun cast a warm glow across the living room as Percy lounged on the couch, idly scrolling through his phone. He heard the familiar creak of the front door opening and smiled, knowing that Nico was home. Nico entered, looking exhausted but content, and gave Percy a quick kiss before collapsing into the armchair opposite him.\n\n\"Long day?\" Percy asked, setting his phone aside.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Nico replied, rubbing his temples. \"But at least it's over. You?\"\n\n\"Same here,\" Percy said with a grin. \"Hey, you know what? You always tell me I can look through your phone anytime. I think I might take you up on that offer.\"\n\nNico raised an eyebrow but nodded. \"Sure, knock yourself out. It's in my bag.\"\n\nPercy retrieved the phone from Nico's bag and settled back on the couch. He unlocked it and began to scroll through the usual apps and messages. Nothing out of the ordinary\u2014until he opened the photo gallery.\n\nThere, amidst the typical snapshots of sunsets and selfies, was a folder labeled \"For Percy.\" Curious, he tapped on it.\n\nThe first photo was of Percy asleep, his face relaxed and peaceful. He couldn't remember Nico taking it, but he felt a warmth spread through him. The next was a candid shot of Percy laughing with Annabeth and Grover, his eyes sparkling with joy. He continued scrolling, finding more and more photos capturing moments he hadn't even realized were special.\n\nThere was one of him staring out at the ocean, lost in thought. Another showed him cooking breakfast, a smudge of flour on his cheek and a look of concentration on his face. There were photos of him playing with their dog, reading a book, and even one of him frowning at a particularly difficult Sudoku puzzle.\n\nEach photo was a testament to the love and care Nico had for him, capturing Percy in moments of vulnerability, happiness, and everyday life. Percy felt a lump form in his throat as he continued to scroll through the gallery. He had always known Nico loved him, but seeing these moments through Nico's eyes made it feel even more real.\n\nHe looked up to see Nico watching him with a small, knowing smile. \"I didn't mean to snoop,\" Percy said, his voice thick with emotion. \"But these... they're amazing.\"\n\nNico shrugged, a faint blush coloring his cheeks. \"I wanted to capture you the way I see you. All those little moments that make you, you.\"\n\nPercy set the phone down and crossed the room to Nico. He knelt beside the armchair and took Nico's hand, pressing a kiss to his knuckles. \"You have no idea how much this means to me,\" he whispered.\n\nNico squeezed his hand and leaned down to kiss Percy gently. \"I'm glad you like them,\" he murmured against Percy's lips.\n\nPercy pulled back slightly, his eyes shining with unshed tears. \"I love them. And I love you.\"\n\nNico's smile widened, and he cupped Percy's cheek. \"I love you too.\"\n\nPercy stood and pulled Nico into a tight embrace, feeling the weight of the day melt away. They stayed like that for a long moment, simply holding each other and reveling in the quiet intimacy of their shared love.\n\nAs they finally pulled apart, Percy couldn't help but chuckle. \"You know, if you keep this up, you might just turn me into a sentimental sap.\"\n\nNico laughed, the sound warm and genuine. \"I think I can live with that.\"\n\nAnd in that moment, Percy knew that every candid photo, every captured memory, was a testament to the beautiful life they were building together."

        "writing_prompt": "A mischievous makeup artist convinces their reluctant partner to star in a video, only to reveal a hilariously unexpected transformation\u2014what happens next?",
        "story": "\"Come on, Nico, it's just a little makeup! It'll be fun,\" Will coaxed, waving a makeup brush like a magic wand. Nico, sprawled on their living room couch, eyed the brush as if it were a venomous snake.\n\n\"Fun for you, maybe,\" Nico grumbled, crossing his arms. \"I don't see why I have to be your guinea pig.\"\n\nWill's eyes sparkled with mischief. \"Because, my darling, you're the perfect canvas for my art. Plus, think of the views! Everyone loves a good transformation video.\"\n\nNico sighed, knowing he was fighting a losing battle. When Will got an idea in his head, there was no stopping him. \"Fine,\" he conceded, \"but if I end up looking like a clown, we're breaking up.\"\n\nWill laughed, leaning down to kiss Nico on the forehead. \"Deal. Now, sit up and close your eyes. You're going to look fabulous.\"\n\nReluctantly, Nico sat up and closed his eyes, bracing himself for whatever madness Will had planned. He could feel the soft bristles of the brush against his skin, the cool touch of foundation, and the gentle tug of eyeliner. Will hummed happily as he worked, and despite himself, Nico began to relax. There was something soothing about the rhythmic strokes and Will's quiet concentration.\n\n\"Okay, open your eyes,\" Will said after what felt like an eternity. Nico hesitated, then slowly opened one eye, then the other. \n\n\"What the\u2014\" Nico's jaw dropped as he took in his reflection. Staring back at him was a perfectly sculpted face, but it wasn't his own. Will had somehow transformed him into a spitting image of Percy Jackson, complete with sea-green eyes and tousled black hair.\n\n\"Surprise!\" Will exclaimed, stepping back to admire his handiwork. \"What do you think? Pretty convincing, huh?\"\n\nNico blinked, still processing the shock. \"I look like Percy,\" he said, incredulous. \"Why do I look like Percy?\"\n\n\"Because it's hilarious,\" Will replied, grinning from ear to ear. \"Imagine the look on his face when he sees this. Plus, I thought it would be fun to mess with Annabeth a little. Just wait until she sees you.\"\n\nNico couldn't help but laugh. The idea of Annabeth doing a double-take at his new look was too good. \"You are evil,\" he said, shaking his head. \"But I have to admit, this is impressive.\"\n\nWill's grin widened. \"See? I told you it would be fun. Now, let's get that video rolling.\"\n\nThey set up the camera and began filming, with Will providing a running commentary on the transformation process. Nico played along, striking poses and making exaggerated expressions. By the time they finished, both of them were in stitches.\n\nWhen they finally uploaded the video, the reaction was immediate and explosive. Comments flooded in, ranging from \"OMG, this is amazing!\" to \"Percy, is that you?!\" Even Percy himself chimed in, leaving a string of laughing emojis and a promise to get back at them.\n\nAnnabeth's reaction was the best, though. She called Nico, trying to sound stern but failing miserably through her laughter. \"You two are ridiculous,\" she said, still giggling. \"But I have to admit, you make a pretty convincing Percy.\"\n\nIn the end, the video was a hit, and Nico had to grudgingly admit that Will's crazy idea had been worth it. As they curled up on the couch that evening, Nico leaned into Will's side, a contented smile on his face.\n\n\"Okay, maybe this makeup thing isn't so bad,\" he murmured. Will chuckled, wrapping an arm around him.\n\n\"Just wait until you see what I have planned for next time,\" he teased. Nico groaned, but there was no hiding the amusement in his eyes."

        "writing_prompt": "While navigating the Labyrinth, Nico encounters a strange, freckled boy claiming to be from the future\u2014and his future boyfriend.",
        "story": "The labyrinth stretched out before Nico, its walls looming and twisting in an endless, eerie maze. Each turn seemed to close in on him, shadows dancing in the dim light of his torch. The air was thick with an ancient, musty smell that clung to his skin, making him shiver. He could hear the faint echoes of distant footsteps, but whether they were his own or someone else's, he couldn't tell. The corridors felt alive, as if the labyrinth itself was watching his every move.\n\nNico's fingers tightened around the hilt of his sword, his senses on high alert. \"Just another quest,\" he muttered to himself, though his voice sounded small and uncertain in the vastness of the labyrinth. \"Just another monster to defeat.\"\n\nSuddenly, he heard a soft rustling behind him. Nico spun around, his eyes narrowing as he peered into the darkness. Out of the shadows stepped a boy, around his age, with a mop of curly hair and a face dusted with freckles. He wore strange clothes, not the typical garb of demigods or mortals. Instead, he had on some kind of sleek, metallic jacket and pants that shimmered slightly in the torchlight.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Nico demanded, his voice edged with suspicion.\n\nThe boy raised his hands in a gesture of peace. \"Whoa, easy there! Name's Will. Will Solace. And before you ask, yes, I'm from the future.\"\n\nNico's eyes widened. \"The future? Are you serious?\"\n\nWill chuckled, the sound warm and reassuring. \"Dead serious. And, uh, you're Nico di Angelo, right? Son of Hades?\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\" Nico asked, taking a cautious step back.\n\n\"Because,\" Will said, his eyes sparkling with mischief, \"in the future, we're kind of, you know, boyfriends.\"\n\nNico felt his cheeks heat up. \"You're joking.\"\n\n\"Wish I was,\" Will replied, his grin widening. \"But nope. I'm here to help you navigate this labyrinth and make sure you don't get lost.\"\n\nNico's skepticism didn't fade. \"And why should I trust you?\"\n\nWill tilted his head, his expression turning serious. \"Because I know things about you that no one else does. Like how you hum that old Italian lullaby when you're nervous. Or how you secretly love chocolate gelato. And that you have this really cute snore when you sleep.\"\n\nNico's mouth fell open. \"How\u2014?\"\n\n\"Time travel perks,\" Will said with a wink. \"Also, you\u2019re going to find this hard to believe, but you\u2019re the one who sent me back. Something about ensuring we meet at the right time and place.\"\n\nNico studied Will's face, searching for any sign of deceit. But all he saw was sincerity and a twinkle of affection in those blue eyes. \"Alright,\" he said slowly. \"Let's say I believe you. How do we get out of here?\"\n\nWill's grin returned, bright and infectious. \"Follow me. I've got this cool gadget that helps map out the labyrinth. Future tech, you know?\"\n\nAs they walked, Will pulled out a small, glowing device that projected a holographic map of the labyrinth. Nico watched in awe as the map shifted and adjusted with every step they took.\n\n\"So,\" Nico said after a while, trying to sound casual, \"we're really... boyfriends in the future?\"\n\nWill glanced at him, his smile softening. \"Yeah. And you make me really happy, Nico. Even if you can be a bit grumpy sometimes.\"\n\nNico felt a strange warmth spread through him, something he hadn't felt in a long time. \"I guess we'll see about that.\"\n\nThey continued their journey, the labyrinth's twists and turns becoming less daunting with Will's guidance. Along the way, they talked and laughed, sharing stories and secrets. Nico found himself relaxing, the eerie atmosphere of the labyrinth fading into the background.\n\nBy the time they reached the exit, Nico felt a connection with Will that he couldn't explain. As they stepped out into the sunlight, Will turned to him, his eyes filled with hope.\n\n\"Maybe the future isn't set in stone,\" Will said softly. \"But I'd like to think that some things are meant to be.\"\n\nNico smiled, a genuine, rare smile that reached his eyes. \"Maybe you're right.\"\n\nAnd as they stood there, bathed in the warmth of the sun, Nico felt a spark of something new and wonderful blossoming between them."

        "writing_prompt": "After surviving the horrors of Tartarus, Will and Nico have developed quiet rituals to soothe their lingering fears. One sleepless night, they find themselves dancing in the kitchen, holding each other close as the weight of their shared past fades into the rhythm of the present.",
        "story": "The kitchen was dimly lit, the soft glow from the overhead bulb casting long shadows across the room. The clock on the wall ticked quietly, each second marking the passage of another sleepless night. Nico di Angelo stood by the window, staring out into the darkness, his mind a labyrinth of shadows and memories that refused to fade.\n\n\"Hey,\" a gentle voice called from behind him. Nico turned to see Will Solace, his husband, standing in the doorway. Will\u2019s blond hair was tousled from sleep, but his blue eyes were bright and full of concern.\n\n\"Couldn't sleep again?\" Will asked softly, stepping closer. Nico nodded, the weight of Tartarus still pressing heavily on his chest, even though they were miles and years away from that dark abyss.\n\nWill reached out, taking Nico's hand in his. \"Come on,\" he said, leading him to the center of the kitchen. \"Let's dance.\"\n\nNico raised an eyebrow but didn't resist. This was one of their quiet rituals, one of the many ways they had learned to soothe their fears. Will walked over to the small radio on the counter and turned it on, a soft melody filling the room. It was a song they both knew well, one they had danced to countless times before.\n\nWill wrapped his arms around Nico, pulling him close. Nico rested his head against Will's shoulder, closing his eyes and letting the music wash over him. For a moment, the memories of Tartarus receded, replaced by the warmth and safety of Will's embrace.\n\nThey swayed gently to the music, their movements slow and deliberate. Will's hand traced soothing circles on Nico's back, his touch a silent promise of comfort and love. Nico could feel the tension in his muscles slowly melting away, the rhythm of the music and the steadiness of Will's heartbeat grounding him in the present.\n\n\"Remember the first time we danced like this?\" Will murmured, his breath warm against Nico's ear. Nico smiled, a faint blush creeping up his cheeks.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he replied softly. \"It was after that nightmare, the one about the Pit.\"\n\nWill nodded, his grip tightening slightly. \"You were so scared, but you let me hold you. And we danced until the fear went away.\"\n\nNico's smile widened. \"I remember thinking that if I could just hold on to you, everything would be okay.\"\n\n\"And it will be,\" Will said firmly. \"As long as we're together, we'll get through anything.\"\n\nThey continued to dance, the kitchen fading away until it was just the two of them, wrapped in each other's arms. The horrors of Tartarus seemed distant, almost unreal, replaced by the love and trust they had built together.\n\nWhen the song ended, they didn't let go. They stood there, holding each other in the quiet kitchen, the silence filled with the unspoken words of their bond. Nico pulled back slightly, looking up into Will's eyes.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he whispered.\n\nWill smiled, leaning down to press a gentle kiss to Nico's forehead. \"Always,\" he replied.\n\nThey stayed like that for a while longer, the weight of their shared past fading into the rhythm of the present. In that moment, they knew that no matter what nightmares might come, they would face them together, with love and quiet rituals that reminded them of the strength they had found in each other.\n\nAs the first light of dawn began to filter through the window, they finally broke apart, but the warmth of their embrace lingered. Hand in hand, they left the kitchen, ready to face another day, knowing that together, they could weather any storm."
