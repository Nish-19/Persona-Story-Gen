        "writing_prompt": "Every morning, Will Solace wakes up next to Nico di Angelo, the love of his life, and every morning begins with laughter, kisses, and the occasional battle to get out of bed\u2014until one day, Nico suggests something that changes their routine forever.",
        "story": "The first rays of dawn painted their bedroom in soft hues of gold and pink, the kind of light that made everything seem just a little more magical. Will Solace stirred, his senses slowly coming to life as he became aware of the warmth beside him. Nico di Angelo, the love of his life, was still sound asleep, his dark hair a tousled mess against the pillow.\n\nWill smiled, his heart swelling with affection. He gently brushed a stray lock of hair from Nico's forehead, earning a sleepy mumble in response. \"Morning, sunshine,\" Will whispered, pressing a tender kiss to Nico's temple.\n\nNico's eyes fluttered open, a small smile tugging at the corners of his lips. \"Morning,\" he replied, his voice thick with sleep. \"You're up early.\"\n\n\"I couldn't resist watching you sleep,\" Will teased, earning a playful swat from Nico. \"Plus, I have a busy day at the infirmary. Figured I'd get a head start.\"\n\nNico stretched, his muscles protesting the movement. \"You always have a busy day at the infirmary,\" he said, but his tone was affectionate. \"You need to take it easy, Will.\"\n\nWill chuckled, pressing a quick kiss to Nico's lips. \"I'll try,\" he promised. \"But first, we need to get out of bed.\"\n\nNico groaned dramatically, pulling the covers over his head. \"Five more minutes,\" he pleaded, his voice muffled.\n\n\"Nope,\" Will said, his tone firm but playful. \"We have a routine to stick to, remember?\"\n\nTheir mornings were a cherished ritual: laughter, kisses, and the occasional battle to get out of bed. It was their way of starting the day on a positive note, no matter what challenges lay ahead.\n\nBut today, as Nico peeked out from under the covers, a mischievous glint in his eyes, Will sensed that something was different. \"What are you plotting, di Angelo?\" he asked, raising an eyebrow.\n\nNico's smile widened. \"I was thinking,\" he began, his voice taking on a thoughtful tone. \"What if we changed things up a bit?\"\n\nWill's curiosity was piqued. \"Changed things up how?\" he asked, leaning in closer.\n\nNico sat up, the covers pooling around his waist. \"You know how we always rush through breakfast because we're running late?\" he said. \"What if we took a little more time in the mornings? Made breakfast together, maybe even went for a walk before you head to the infirmary?\"\n\nWill considered this, his mind racing with the possibilities. \"You mean... slow down a bit?\" he asked, a smile creeping onto his face.\n\n\"Exactly,\" Nico said, his eyes shining with excitement. \"I think it could be good for us. A way to start the day feeling more connected, less rushed.\"\n\nWill felt a surge of warmth in his chest. \"I love it,\" he said, pulling Nico into a tight embrace. \"Let's do it.\"\n\nThe next morning, they woke up with the first light, just as they always did. But instead of their usual routine of hurried kisses and quick goodbyes, they took their time. They made pancakes together, laughing as they flipped them in the pan. They talked about their dreams and plans for the day, savoring each moment.\n\nAfter breakfast, they went for a walk in the early morning light, hand in hand. The world seemed to slow down around them, and for the first time in a long time, they felt truly present.\n\nAs they returned home, Will knew that Nico's suggestion had changed their routine forever. It was a small change, but it made a world of difference. They felt more connected, more in tune with each other.\n\nAnd as they shared one last kiss before Will headed to the infirmary, he knew that no matter what the day brought, they would face it together, one slow, meaningful morning at a time."

        "writing_prompt": "Your partner insists you can look through their phone anytime, but when you do, you discover a collection of candid photos of yourself\u2014each one capturing a moment you didn\u2019t even realize was special.",
        "story": "Percy had never been one to pry. He trusted Nico implicitly, but when Nico casually mentioned he could look through his phone whenever he wanted, Percy was intrigued. It was one of those lazy Sunday afternoons, the kind where time seemed to stretch endlessly, and curiosity got the better of him.\n\nNico was napping on the couch, the soft rise and fall of his chest almost hypnotic. Percy quietly picked up Nico's phone from the coffee table, feeling a mix of excitement and guilt. He unlocked it easily\u2014Nico had given him the passcode ages ago\u2014and began to scroll through the gallery.\n\nThe first few photos were what Percy expected: selfies of Nico, pictures of their friends, snapshots from various demigod quests. But then he stumbled upon a folder labeled \"Perseus.\" His heart skipped a beat. He opened it with a mix of anticipation and trepidation.\n\nThe first photo was of Percy at the beach, his back to the camera, gazing out at the horizon. He remembered that day vaguely\u2014it was one of their spontaneous trips to Montauk. He had been lost in thought, feeling the weight of the world momentarily lift as he stared at the endless sea.\n\nThe next photo showed Percy laughing, his eyes crinkling with genuine mirth. He recognized the scene: it was taken during Annabeth and Piper's joint birthday party. He had been recounting a particularly ridiculous quest mishap, and everyone had been in stitches. Percy smiled, feeling warmth spread through his chest.\n\nPhoto after photo, Percy found himself reliving moments he had either forgotten or hadn't realized were being captured. There was one of him reading a book under the shade of a tree in Central Park, another of him cooking breakfast\u2014pancakes, his specialty, with a grin on his face and flour smudged on his cheek.\n\nOne photo, in particular, caught him off guard. It was of him asleep, tangled in the sheets, with Nico's hand gently brushing a strand of hair from his forehead. Percy had no recollection of this moment, but the tenderness in Nico's gesture was palpable.\n\nPercy glanced over at Nico, still peacefully napping, and felt a surge of emotion. These photos weren't just candid snapshots; they were Nico's way of preserving the moments that mattered to him, the moments that made up their life together. It was Nico's silent love letter, captured through the lens of his phone.\n\nHe continued scrolling, finding even more gems: Percy playing fetch with Mrs. O'Leary, his face lighting up with pure joy; Percy concentrating fiercely while attempting to assemble a piece of IKEA furniture, Nico's amused reflection visible in a nearby mirror; Percy and Nico's hands intertwined, a simple yet profound testament to their bond.\n\nTears welled up in Percy's eyes as he realized the depth of Nico's affection. Each photo was a testament to the love and admiration Nico held for him, capturing not just Percy, but the essence of who he was in those unguarded moments.\n\nGently, Percy set the phone down and moved to sit beside Nico. He brushed a kiss on Nico's forehead, causing him to stir and open his eyes groggily.\n\n\"Hey,\" Nico mumbled, a sleepy smile forming on his lips. \"What're you doing?\"\n\nPercy wrapped his arms around Nico, holding him close. \"I was looking through your phone,\" he admitted softly. \"I found the photos.\"\n\nNico's eyes widened slightly, a blush creeping up his cheeks. \"Oh. I didn't mean for you to find those.\"\n\nPercy shook his head, his voice thick with emotion. \"They're beautiful, Nico. I didn't realize... you see me in a way I never even see myself.\"\n\nNico's blush deepened, but he smiled, a tender, loving smile that made Percy's heart swell. \"That's because I love you, Seaweed Brain.\"\n\nPercy leaned in, capturing Nico's lips in a gentle kiss. \"I love you too, Death Boy. Thank you for showing me... us.\"\n\nAs they settled back into the couch, wrapped in each other's arms, Percy knew that every candid photo, every stolen moment, was a piece of their love story\u2014one that would continue to unfold, frame by frame."

        "writing_prompt": "A mischievous makeup artist convinces their reluctant partner to star in a video, only to reveal a hilariously unexpected transformation\u2014what happens next?",
        "story": "\u201cCome on, Percy, it\u2019ll be fun!\u201d Leo grinned, waving a makeup brush like a magic wand.\n\nPercy folded his arms and glared at Leo from the safety of their couch. \u201cFun for you, maybe. I\u2019m not so sure about me.\u201d\n\nLeo pouted, his eyes twinkling with mischief. \u201cPlease? It\u2019s just one video. Think of the views! Besides, I promise I won\u2019t make you look ridiculous.\u201d\n\nPercy raised an eyebrow. \u201cYour promises are about as reliable as a Hermes delivery service.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey! That\u2019s low, even for you,\u201d Leo chuckled. He sidled up to Percy, batting his eyelashes. \u201cI swear, it\u2019ll be worth it.\u201d\n\nWith a long-suffering sigh, Percy relented. \u201cFine. But if I end up looking like a clownfish, I\u2019m dunking you in the nearest fountain.\u201d\n\nLeo\u2019s face lit up. \u201cDeal! Now, sit back and let the magic happen.\u201d\n\nPercy slumped into a chair, watching as Leo laid out an array of colorful products. The makeup artist hummed a cheerful tune, his hands moving with practiced ease. Percy closed his eyes, trying to relax as Leo applied primer, foundation, and an assortment of other mysterious concoctions.\n\n\u201cHold still,\u201d Leo murmured, gently brushing eyeshadow onto Percy\u2019s lids. \u201cYou\u2019re going to love this.\u201d\n\nPercy\u2019s skepticism was palpable, but he kept his eyes shut, trusting Leo despite his reservations. After what felt like an eternity, Leo finally stepped back, clapping his hands together.\n\n\u201cOkay, open your eyes!\u201d\n\nPercy blinked, his vision adjusting to the light. He turned to the mirror and gasped. Staring back at him was not the demigod he knew, but a stunningly glamorous figure. Leo had transformed him into a dazzling mermaid, complete with shimmering scales and iridescent eyeshadow.\n\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d Percy breathed, touching his cheek in awe. \u201cI look... amazing.\u201d\n\nLeo beamed. \u201cI told you! You look like you just swam out of Poseidon\u2019s treasure trove.\u201d\n\nPercy laughed, shaking his head. \u201cYou really outdid yourself this time, Leo.\u201d\n\nLeo\u2019s grin turned sly. \u201cOh, we\u2019re not done yet. Now, for the final touch.\u201d\n\nBefore Percy could protest, Leo fastened a tiara adorned with seashells and pearls onto his head. Percy glanced at his reflection again, unable to suppress a smile. He looked like the king of the ocean, regal and radiant.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re enjoying this way too much,\u201d Percy teased, but there was no malice in his tone.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Leo admitted, snapping a picture with his phone. \u201cBut admit it, you love it too.\u201d\n\nPercy rolled his eyes, though his expression softened. \u201cAlright, you win. This was actually kinda fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee? I told you!\u201d Leo leaned in, giving Percy a quick kiss on the cheek. \u201cNow, let\u2019s get that video rolling.\u201d\n\nThey set up the camera, and Leo guided Percy through a playful, light-hearted skit. Percy embraced his new persona, playing along with Leo\u2019s antics. They laughed and joked, the room filled with their infectious energy.\n\nWhen the video was done, Percy collapsed onto the couch, still smiling. \u201cThat was... surprisingly awesome.\u201d\n\nLeo joined him, curling up by his side. \u201cTold you. And just wait until you see the reaction online. People are going to love it.\u201d\n\nPercy chuckled, resting his head on Leo\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWell, if it makes people smile, then it\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\nLeo kissed the top of Percy\u2019s head, his eyes sparkling with affection. \u201cYou always know how to make waves, Percy. Even as a mermaid.\u201d\n\nAnd as they sat there, basking in the afterglow of their shared creativity, Percy couldn\u2019t help but feel grateful for his mischievous makeup artist and the unexpected magic they brought into his life."

        "writing_prompt": "While navigating the Labyrinth, Nico encounters a strange, freckled boy claiming to be from the future\u2014and his future boyfriend.",
        "story": "The labyrinth stretched endlessly before him, dark and winding, each turn more disorienting than the last. Nico di Angelo felt the weight of the Underworld pressing down on him, cold and relentless. The walls seemed to pulse with a life of their own, whispers of ancient secrets brushing against his ears as he moved.\n\n\"Left or right?\" he muttered to himself, trying to ignore the echo of his own voice. He glanced at his Stygian iron sword, the blade reflecting faint glimmers of light from unseen sources.\n\n\"Definitely left,\" a voice said from behind him. Nico whirled around, sword raised, only to find a boy about his age standing there, grinning. His hair was a tousled mess of curls, and freckles dotted his cheeks like constellations. He wore clothes that looked oddly modern\u2014a hoodie with a logo Nico didn't recognize, jeans, and sneakers that seemed to glow faintly in the dim light.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Nico demanded, his heart pounding. \"And how did you get here?\"\n\nThe boy raised his hands in mock surrender. \"Whoa, easy there. Name's Alex. And believe it or not, I'm from the future.\"\n\nNico's eyes narrowed. \"The future. Right. And I'm the King of Olympus.\"\n\nAlex chuckled, the sound echoing eerily through the labyrinth. \"I know it sounds crazy, but it's true. I'm actually here to help you.\"\n\n\"Help me with what?\" Nico asked, skepticism clear in his voice.\n\n\"Finding a way out, for starters,\" Alex said, taking a step closer. \"And also, well, to meet you. The future you, I mean.\"\n\nNico lowered his sword slightly but didn't let his guard down. \"Why would I need to meet you?\"\n\nAlex's grin softened into something more genuine. \"Because, in the future, we're kind of a thing. Boyfriends, actually.\"\n\nNico blinked, his mind reeling. \"Boyfriends? You and me?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" Alex said, his eyes twinkling. \"Surprised?\"\n\n\"That's one way to put it,\" Nico muttered, feeling a strange mix of emotions. \"How do I know you're not just some trick of the labyrinth? Or worse, a monster in disguise?\"\n\nAlex shrugged. \"Fair point. But do monsters usually know your deepest secrets? Like how you still feel guilty about Bianca, or how you sometimes wonder if you'll ever find a place where you truly belong?\"\n\nNico's grip on his sword tightened. \"Stop. Just\u2014stop.\"\n\n\"I'm not here to hurt you, Nico,\" Alex said softly. \"I'm here because I care about you. Because future-you asked me to come back and make sure you don't get lost in this maze.\"\n\nNico took a deep breath, trying to steady himself. \"Okay, let's say I believe you. How do we get out of here?\"\n\nAlex's smile returned, a bit more mischievous this time. \"Follow me.\" He turned and started walking confidently down the left path.\n\nWith a reluctant sigh, Nico followed. As they walked, Alex pointed out subtle markers on the walls\u2014tiny symbols and grooves that Nico had overlooked. \"These are future markers,\" Alex explained. \"Left by people who\u2019ve navigated the maze before.\"\n\nNico's curiosity got the better of him. \"So, what else can you tell me about the future?\"\n\nAlex glanced back with a teasing smile. \"Wouldn't want to spoil too much, but let's just say you find your place. And you find people who care about you. Including me.\"\n\nNico felt a warmth spread through him, a tiny spark of hope. \"And you're sure about this? Us, I mean?\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Alex said without hesitation. \"We make a pretty great team.\"\n\nAs they turned another corner, the labyrinth's oppressive atmosphere seemed to lighten just a bit. Nico found himself trusting Alex more with each step, his earlier skepticism fading.\n\n\"So, do future boyfriends get any perks?\" Nico asked, attempting to sound nonchalant.\n\nAlex laughed, a sound that seemed to brighten the dark corridors. \"How about this?\" He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small device, pressing a button. A holographic map of the labyrinth appeared, glowing softly.\n\nNico's eyes widened. \"That's...incredible.\"\n\n\"Just one of many perks,\" Alex said with a wink.\n\nTogether, they navigated the labyrinth with newfound ease, the map guiding them through the twists and turns. And as they walked side by side, Nico couldn't help but feel a budding connection forming\u2014a sense that maybe, just maybe, the future held something worth fighting for.\n\nEventually, they reached a large iron door, its surface etched with ancient runes. Alex turned to Nico, his expression serious. \"This is it. Beyond this door is your way out.\"\n\nNico took a deep breath, feeling a mixture of relief and anticipation. \"Thanks, Alex. For everything.\"\n\nAlex smiled, reaching out to squeeze Nico's hand. \"Anytime, Nico. See you in the future.\"\n\nWith a final nod, Nico pushed open the door, stepping into the unknown with a newfound sense of hope and curiosity."

One sleepless night, they find themselves dancing in the kitchen, holding each other close as the weight of their shared past fades into the rhythm of the present.",
        "story": "The kitchen was bathed in the soft glow of the moonlight filtering through the window, casting gentle shadows on the walls. The storm outside was a distant memory as the quiet of the night wrapped around them, a stark contrast to the chaos they had once known. Nico di Angelo stood by the counter, his dark eyes reflecting the silver light, lost in thoughts that were both distant and immediate. \n\nWill Solace, his ever-bright presence a beacon in the darkness, approached him with a quiet smile. \"Can't sleep?\" he asked softly, already knowing the answer. \n\nNico shook his head, his fingers drumming a restless rhythm on the countertop. \"Memories,\" he murmured, his voice barely above a whisper. \n\nWill nodded, understanding all too well. The horrors of Tartarus were not easily forgotten, and the shadows of their past had a way of creeping into the present. But they had found ways to cope, small rituals that brought them back to the here and now, grounding them in each other\u2019s presence.\n\n\"Come here,\" Will said gently, reaching out a hand. Nico hesitated for a moment before taking it, allowing himself to be pulled into the warm embrace of his boyfriend. The kitchen seemed to shrink around them, the world narrowing down to just the two of them and the slow, comforting rhythm of their breaths.\n\nWill hummed a tune, soft and soothing, as he began to sway. Nico rested his head on Will's shoulder, his eyes closing as he let the music wash over him. It was a song they both knew well, one that had become a part of their ritual. The melody was simple, but it held a power that words alone could not convey. \n\nAs they danced, the tension in Nico's shoulders began to melt away. Will's arms were strong and steady, a constant reminder that he was safe, that they were both safe. The horrors of Tartarus seemed a lifetime away in this moment, replaced by the warmth and comfort of their shared presence.\n\n\"Remember the first time we did this?\" Will whispered, his breath tickling Nico's ear. \n\nNico nodded, a small smile tugging at his lips. \"I thought it was ridiculous,\" he admitted. \"Dancing in the middle of the night, in the kitchen of all places.\"\n\nWill chuckled softly. \"And now?\"\n\n\"Now,\" Nico said, his voice steady and sure, \"I can't imagine getting through the night without it.\"\n\nThey continued to sway, lost in the rhythm of their dance. The kitchen, with its familiar scents and sounds, became a sanctuary, a place where the past could not touch them. Will's humming grew softer, and he began to sing the words to the song, his voice a soothing balm to Nico's frayed nerves.\n\n\"You are my sunshine, my only sunshine,\" he sang softly. \"You make me happy when skies are gray.\"\n\nNico joined in, his voice blending with Will's. \"You'll never know, dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away.\"\n\nThe song ended, but they continued to hold each other, the silence between them comfortable and warm. Nico lifted his head, his eyes meeting Will's. \"Thank you,\" he whispered.\n\nWill pressed a gentle kiss to Nico's forehead. \"Always,\" he replied. \"We'll always have this.\"\n\nAs the night wore on, the weight of their shared past began to fade, replaced by the strength of their bond. In the quiet of the kitchen, with the moonlight casting its gentle glow, they found peace in each other's arms. And for that moment, the world was exactly as it should be."
