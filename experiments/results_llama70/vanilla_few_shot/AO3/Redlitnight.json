        "story": "\n\nWill Solace woke up to the warm glow of sunlight peeking through the windows of their small cabin, casting a golden light on the messy tangle of blankets and Nico's dark hair. He stretched, yawned, and reached over to tickle Nico's side, earning a sleepy growl and a half-hearted attempt to swat at his hand.\n\n\"Morning, sunshine,\" Will whispered, peppering Nico's face with gentle kisses.\n\nNico's eyes fluttered open, and he smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. \"Morning, Will.\"\n\nTheir morning routine was a well-oiled machine: wake up, kiss, laugh, and then the inevitable battle to get out of bed. Nico always won, pulling Will back into the warmth of their bed, where they'd spend a good hour just lounging, talking, and enjoying each other's company.\n\nBut today was different. As they lay there, Nico's expression turned thoughtful, and he said, \"Hey, Will?\"\n\n\"Hmm?\" Will replied, his head on Nico's chest, listening to the steady beat of his heart.\n\n\"I was thinking... maybe we should try something new.\"\n\nWill's ears perked up. \"What kind of new?\"\n\nNico's eyes sparkled with mischief. \"I was thinking we could try... a morning ritual.\"\n\nWill raised an eyebrow. \"A morning ritual? You mean, like, a spell or something?\"\n\nNico chuckled. \"Not exactly. I was thinking more along the lines of... a shared goal. Something we work towards together, every morning.\"\n\nWill's curiosity was piqued. \"What kind of goal?\"\n\nNico's face lit up with excitement. \"I was thinking we could try to... summon a sunrise.\"\n\nWill's jaw dropped. \"A sunrise? Nico, that's not exactly something we can control.\"\n\nNico shrugged. \"I know, but hear me out. We're both powerful demigods, and we're in love. I think we can do it. And even if we can't, it'll be fun trying.\"\n\nWill couldn't resist Nico's infectious enthusiasm. \"Okay, deal. But if we end up summoning a storm instead, I'm blaming you.\"\n\nNico grinned, and they sealed their deal with a kiss.\n\nTheir first attempt was... interesting. They stood outside, hands clasped, and focused all their energy on calling forth the sun. Instead, they managed to summon a flock of confused birds, who chirped angrily at them before flying away.\n\nTheir second attempt was more successful, but they ended up summoning a miniature rainbow, which promptly got tangled in the trees.\n\nAs the days went by, their attempts became more and more creative. They summoned a gentle breeze, a sprinkle of glittering stardust, and even a small, adorable puppy (who promptly became their new cabin-mate).\n\nAnd every morning, they'd laugh, kiss, and try again, their love and determination growing stronger with each passing day.\n\nAs they stood outside, hands clasped, and faced the horizon, Will turned to Nico and smiled. \"You know, I never thought I'd say this, but I think I'm actually enjoying our new morning ritual.\"\n\nNico's eyes sparkled with amusement. \"Told you it would be fun.\"\n\nTheir lips met in a gentle kiss, and as they broke apart, the sky erupted in a glorious sunrise, painting the horizon with hues of pink and gold.\n\nWill grinned. \"I think we did it.\"\n\nNico smiled back, his eyes shining with love and pride. \"We sure did, Will. We sure did.\""

        "writing_prompt": "Your partner insists you can look through their phone anytime, but when you do, you discover a collection of candid photos of yourself\u2014each one capturing a moment you didn\u2019t even realize was special.",
        "story": "\n\nI flopped onto the couch beside Will, snatching his phone from his hand as he laughed and pretended to try and get it back. \"Hey, I'm just checking the time,\" I said, scrolling through his notifications.\n\nWill raised an eyebrow. \"You know I don't have anything to hide, Nico. You can look through my phone anytime.\"\n\nI nodded, already knowing that. Will was one of the most open and honest people I'd ever met. But as I scrolled through his photos, I stumbled upon an album labeled \"Nico\". My heart skipped a beat as I opened it.\n\nThe first photo was of me sleeping on the bus during a quest, my head lolled to the side and a peaceful expression on my face. The next was of me laughing with Annabeth during a training session, my eyes crinkled at the corners and my mouth wide open. As I scrolled through the album, I found more candid shots of myself - me reading a book in the camp library, me looking out at the sunset on the beach, me concentrating on a puzzle in the common room.\n\nEach photo captured a moment I didn't even realize was special. I had no idea Will had taken them, and I certainly didn't know he'd kept them all in a secret album.\n\nI felt a lump form in my throat as I looked up at Will, who was watching me with a soft smile. \"When did you take these?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nWill shrugged. \"Whenever I saw something that made me love you a little more. You're so beautiful, Nico, not just on the outside but on the inside too. I wanted to capture that.\"\n\nI felt my eyes well up with tears as I looked back at the photos. I had no idea I was so loved, so seen. \"Why didn't you show me these before?\" I asked, my voice cracking.\n\nWill took the phone from me and set it aside, pulling me into a hug. \"I wanted to keep them just for myself, I guess. But I'm glad you found them. I'm glad you know how much you mean to me.\"\n\nAs we hugged, I realized that these photos were more than just candid shots - they were a testament to the love and attention Will had been paying me all along. I felt seen and loved in a way I never had before, and it was overwhelming in the best possible way.\n\n\"I love you,\" I whispered into his shoulder.\n\n\"I love you too, Nico,\" Will replied, his voice full of emotion. \"And I'll keep taking these photos, as long as you'll let me.\"\n\nI smiled, feeling grateful for this little collection of moments that had been hiding in plain sight. \"I'd like that,\" I said, pulling back to look at Will. \"I'd like that a lot.\""

        "story": "\n\nNico flopped down onto the couch, exhausted from a long day of battles with mythological monsters. Will, on the other hand, was bouncing with energy, his eyes sparkling with mischief.\n\n\"Come on, Nico, just one video,\" Will wheedled, waving a makeup brush in the air. \"I promise it'll be fun, and it's for a great cause \u2013 my YouTube channel needs more views!\"\n\nNico raised an eyebrow, skeptical. \"What's the theme this time? 'Demigods in drag'?\"\n\nWill's grin grew wider. \"No, no, nothing like that. I promise you'll love it. It's a... a... surprise.\"\n\nNico raised an eyebrow, but Will's enthusiasm was infectious. He finally agreed, and Will let out a triumphant whoop, dragging Nico to the makeshift studio in their living room.\n\nAs Will worked his magic with the makeup, Nico's skepticism grew. \"Will, what's with the glitter? And the... the... rainbow-colored wig?\"\n\nWill just winked. \"Trust me, darling. You'll be a natural.\"\n\nFinally, the transformation was complete. Nico stared at his reflection, aghast. He was... a chicken. A giant, glittery, rainbow-feathered chicken.\n\n\"Will, what have you done to me?\" Nico demanded, his voice muffled by the beak.\n\nWill burst out laughing, holding his sides. \"I told you it was a surprise! You're going to be the star of my new video \u2013 'Demigods in Fowl Play'!\"\n\nNico's eyes narrowed. \"You're going to pay for this.\"\n\nThe video shoot was a disaster, with Nico flapping his wings and squawking in protest. But despite his initial reluctance, he couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. Will's infectious energy was impossible to resist.\n\nAs they wrapped up the shoot, Nico turned to Will, still in his chicken getup. \"You know, I never thought I'd say this, but... that was kind of fun.\"\n\nWill beamed, hugging Nico tightly. \"I knew you'd come around! And don't worry, I'll make sure to edit out the part where you chased me around the room, flapping your wings and squawking 'Bock-bock-bock'.\"\n\nNico chuckled, shaking his head. \"You're a menace, Will Solace.\"\n\nWill grinned, snuggling into Nico's side. \"Hey, someone's got to keep things interesting around here.\"\n\nAs they uploaded the video to YouTube, Nico couldn't help but feel grateful for his partner's mischievous sense of humor. Who else could turn a reluctant demigod into a glittery chicken, and make it look fabulous?\n\nThe video quickly went viral, with fans of the demigod community cracking up over Nico's hilarious transformation. And as they sat on the couch, watching the views roll in, Nico turned to Will with a smile.\n\n\"You know, I think I'm starting to get the hang of this YouTube thing.\"\n\nWill's eyes lit up. \"Really? I have a great idea for our next video...\"\n\nNico's eyes widened in mock horror. \"Oh no, what have I gotten myself into?\""

        "story": "\n\nNico trudged through the Labyrinth, his eyes scanning the twisting passages for any sign of the exit. He had been walking for what felt like hours, and the eerie silence was starting to unnerve him. As a son of Hades, he was no stranger to the underworld, but the Labyrinth was a whole different story.\n\nSuddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows. Nico's hand instinctively went to his sword, but the boy just grinned and held up his hands in a peaceful gesture.\n\n\"Hey, no need for that,\" he said, his eyes crinkling at the corners. \"I come in peace.\"\n\nNico narrowed his eyes. There was something familiar about the boy, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it. \"Who are you?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I'm... well, my name is Alex,\" the boy said, his freckles scattering across his nose as he smiled. \"And I'm from... um, a bit of a different time.\"\n\nNico raised an eyebrow. \"A different time?\"\n\nAlex nodded enthusiastically. \"Yeah! I'm from the future. And I've come to meet you, Nico di Angelo.\"\n\nNico's eyes widened. \"How do you know my name?\"\n\nAlex chuckled. \"Well, let's just say I've heard a lot about you. You're kind of a legend in my time.\"\n\nNico snorted. \"A legend?\"\n\nAlex nodded, his eyes sparkling. \"Yeah. You and your... exploits. But I'm here to talk to you about something specific.\"\n\nNico's instincts were screaming at him to be cautious, but there was something about Alex's warm smile that put him at ease. \"What is it?\"\n\nAlex took a deep breath. \"I'm here to tell you that... we're going to be boyfriends.\"\n\nNico's jaw dropped. \"What?\"\n\nAlex nodded, his face serious. \"In the future, we meet and... it's complicated, but we end up together. And I've come to warn you about some stuff that's going to happen.\"\n\nNico's mind was reeling. A boyfriend from the future? It sounded like something out of a myth. But as he looked into Alex's eyes, he saw something there that made him trust this strange, freckled boy.\n\n\"Okay,\" Nico said slowly. \"Tell me.\"\n\nAlex launched into a story about their future selves, about battles fought and won, about laughter and tears and quiet moments together. Nico listened, entranced, as the Labyrinth seemed to fade away around them.\n\nAs they talked, Nico found himself feeling a connection to this boy from the future, a connection that went beyond words. It was as if he had known Alex his whole life, not just this strange, disjointed conversation.\n\nFinally, Alex finished his story and looked at Nico with a serious expression. \"You have to be careful, Nico. There are people who will try to hurt you, to use you for their own gain. But you're strong, and you're brave. And I'll be there to help you, whenever you need it.\"\n\nNico felt a surge of determination. He would face whatever the future held, knowing that he had Alex by his side.\n\nAs they parted ways, Nico felt a strange sense of loss, as if he was leaving a part of himself behind. But he knew that he would see Alex again, that their story was far from over.\n\nAs he emerged from the Labyrinth, Nico couldn't help but wonder what other surprises the future held. But with Alex by his side, he was ready to face whatever came next.\n\n\"Thanks for the warning,\" Nico called back, as Alex disappeared into the shadows.\n\nAlex's voice echoed back, \"No problem, future boyfriend!\"\n\nNico grinned, feeling a spark of excitement ignite within him. He couldn't wait to see what the future held."

        "writing_prompt": "After surviving the horrors of Tartarus, Will and Nico have developed quiet rituals to soothe their lingering fears. One sleepless night, they find themselves dancing in the kitchen, holding each other close as the weight of their shared past fades into the rhythm of the present.",
        "story": "\n\nThe moon cast its silvery glow over the quiet streets of New Rome, the only sound the distant hum of crickets and the soft creaking of the cabin's wooden floorboards. Will Solace, ever the night owl, stood in the kitchen, his eyes fixed on the cup of coffee he was nursing. The rich aroma filled the air, but even its warmth couldn't chase away the lingering chill of Tartarus's darkness.\n\nNico di Angelo, his partner in every sense of the word, entered the kitchen, his eyes heavy with the weight of his own memories. The shadows that danced across his face told a story of their own, a testament to the horrors they'd faced in the depths of the Underworld.\n\nWithout a word, Will held out his hand, and Nico took it, his fingers intertwining with Will's in a gentle, reassuring grasp. It was a gesture they'd developed over the years, a quiet acknowledgment of the demons they'd fought and the scars they still bore.\n\nAs they stood there, the silence between them grew, until Nico's gaze drifted to the old radio on the counter. He flipped it on, and the soft strains of a jazz standard filled the room. The music was a balm to their frazzled nerves, and without thinking, Will began to sway to the rhythm.\n\nNico's eyes met his, and a small, wry smile played on his lips. \"Dance with me?\" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nWill's heart skipped a beat as Nico drew him close, their bodies swaying in perfect sync. The music wove a spell around them, transporting them to a time before Tartarus, before the wars and the losses. For a fleeting moment, they were just two people, lost in the beauty of the present.\n\nAs they danced, the shadows receded, and the weight of their shared past began to lift. The kitchen, once a mundane space, became a sanctuary, a place where they could let their guard down and simply be.\n\nTheir movements grew more fluid, their bodies attuned to the rhythm and to each other. Will's hands slid up Nico's back, settling on his shoulders, while Nico's arms wrapped around Will's waist, holding him close.\n\nIn this quiet, intimate dance, they found solace. The music became a reminder that even in the darkest moments, there was always beauty to be found, always a reason to keep moving forward.\n\nAs the song drew to a close, Nico's lips brushed against Will's ear. \"Better?\" he whispered.\n\nWill nodded, his eyes drifting shut as Nico's warm breath sent shivers down his spine. \"Yeah,\" he replied, his voice barely audible. \"I'm better when I'm with you.\"\n\nThe radio crackled, and a new song began, but they didn't need the music anymore. They had each other, and in this moment, that was all that mattered. As they swayed to the rhythm, their hearts beating in tandem, the darkness of Tartarus receded, and the warmth of their love shone bright, a beacon in the night."
