        "story": "\n\nRomi dropped the tray, spilling coffee all over herself, and her eyes locked in on the stains on her sweatpants so she wouldn\u2019t have to see anything else. The scream had pierced the air, followed by the thud that made her heart sink. She stood frozen in the doorway of her new apartment, her gaze fixed on the coffee-stained fabric as if it was the only thing that could keep her grounded. The sounds of shattering glass and crunching metal still echoed in her mind, refusing to let her process what had just happened.\n\nThe neighbor from across the hall had jumped. Romi had seen her just the day before, exchanging awkward smiles and introductions in the elevator. The woman had seemed nice, a bit reserved, but nice. Romi's mind struggled to reconcile the friendly face with the shattered remains on the pavement below.\n\nAs she stood there, numb and helpless, Daniel burst into the apartment, his face a mask of concern. \"Romi, what's wrong?\" He took in the scene, his eyes darting from the spilled coffee to the look of horror on her face. \"What happened?\"\n\nRomi's voice caught in her throat as she tried to form words. Daniel's grip on her shoulders tightened, and he pulled her close. \"It's okay, I've got you.\" But it wasn't okay. Nothing was okay.\n\nThe days that followed were a blur of police questioning, awkward encounters with other neighbors, and the constant feeling of being watched. Romi couldn't shake the sense that the woman's death was somehow connected to her. She knew it was irrational, but the feeling lingered, gnawing at her like a rodent in the walls.\n\nAs she tried to settle into her new routine, Romi found herself constantly looking over her shoulder, expecting to see the woman's ghostly figure in the hallway. She began to wonder if she had somehow contributed to the tragedy, if her presence in the building had triggered something in the woman's fragile mind.\n\nDaniel tried to reassure her, but his words fell flat. He didn't understand. He couldn't understand. He hadn't seen the woman's face, hadn't heard the sound of her body hitting the ground.\n\nOne night, as they were watching TV, Romi's eyes drifted to the window. She felt an overwhelming urge to get up and look out, to see if the woman was standing on the fire escape, watching her. Daniel noticed her distraction and followed her gaze.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" he asked, his voice low and gentle.\n\nRomi hesitated, unsure of how to articulate the creeping sense of dread that had taken up residence in her mind. \"I don't know,\" she admitted, feeling a lump form in her throat. \"I just feel like...like it was meant for me.\"\n\nDaniel's expression turned skeptical. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nRomi's words spilled out in a rush. \"I mean, what if it was a message? What if she was trying to tell me something?\"\n\nDaniel's grip on the remote control tightened. \"Romi, that's not rational. The woman was struggling with her own demons. It had nothing to do with you.\"\n\nBut Romi knew what she felt. She felt like her carefully constructed life was beginning to unravel, thread by thread. The woman's death had been a catalyst, a wake-up call that had shattered the illusion of her perfect world.\n\nAs the days passed, Romi's obsession with the woman's death only grew. She scoured the internet for information, talked to the other neighbors, and even snuck into the woman's abandoned apartment, searching for clues. Daniel's patience wore thin, and their arguments escalated.\n\nOne night, as they stood in the kitchen, the tension between them palpable, Romi realized that she had lost sight of what was real. The woman's death had become an all-consuming force, a black hole that was sucking her in.\n\nBut what if it was more than that? What if it was a warning, a sign that her life was not as perfect as she thought? Romi's mind reeled with the possibilities, and for the first time, she wondered if she was ready to face the truth.\n\nAs she looked at Daniel, she saw the concern etched on his face, and her heart ached. She knew she needed to let go, to release the grip of the woman's death and focus on the life she had built. But as she turned to walk away, she caught a glimpse of herself in the window reflection.\n\nFor a moment, she could have sworn she saw the woman's face superimposed over her own, a haunting reminder that the truth was still out there, waiting to be uncovered."
