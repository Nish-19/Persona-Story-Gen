        "story": "\n\nGeorge Floyd is dead while I write this story. If I had written these words a little more than a year ago, G.F. alive. In a year, he will not be alive, whether I write or don\u2019t write this story about him. The words I write are not life. They are not life support. They are not life-giving. They are only words. But I will write them. I will write them to remember. To resist. To hold on to what I can, though what I hold onto is nothing, nothing but words.\n\nIn the sweltering heat of a summer afternoon, I find myself wandering through the city streets, trying to escape the weight of my memories. But memories are not something you can escape. They are not something you can leave behind. They are not something you can forget. They are the very fabric of who we are, the threads that weave our stories together. And yet, I try. I try to outrun them, to outwalk them, to outwrite them. But they are always there, lingering in the shadows, waiting to pounce.\n\nI think of my grandmother, who died when I was just a child. I remember the smell of her cooking, the sound of her laughter, the feel of her warm hands on my skin. But I also remember the pain she endured, the struggles she faced, the injustices she suffered. I remember the way she was treated, the way she was marginalized, the way she was forgotten. And I remember the way I felt, the way I still feel, the anger, the sadness, the frustration.\n\nI think of the countless others, the ones who have been forgotten, the ones who have been erased. I think of the Native Americans, the African Americans, the Latin Americans, the Asian Americans. I think of the women, the children, the poor, the marginalized. I think of the ones who have been silenced, the ones who have been oppressed, the ones who have been killed.\n\nAnd I wonder, what is the point of remembering? What is the point of holding onto these memories, these stories, these lives? Is it to relive the pain? To relive the suffering? Or is it to honor the dead? To honor the living? To honor the struggle?\n\nI think of the words of Toni Morrison, who said, \"If there is a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, you must be the one to write it.\" I think of the power of storytelling, the power of words, the power of memory. I think of the way that stories can shape us, can mold us, can change us.\n\nAnd I realize, the act of remembering is not just a personal act, it is a political act. It is an act of resistance. It is a way of saying, \"I will not forget. I will not forget the pain, the suffering, the injustices. I will not forget the lives that have been lost, the lives that have been lived.\"\n\nI think of the way that memory can be a burden, a weight that we carry with us always. But I also think of the way that memory can be a gift, a gift that allows us to learn, to grow, to become. I think of the way that memory can be a bridge, a bridge that connects us to our past, to our present, to our future.\n\nAnd I wonder, what does it mean to remember? What does it mean to hold onto these memories, these stories, these lives? Does it mean that we are stuck in the past? Does it mean that we are unable to move forward? Or does it mean that we are able to learn from the past, to grow from the past, to become something new?\n\nI think of the words of James Baldwin, who said, \"People are trapped in history and history is trapped in them.\" I think of the way that our memories shape us, the way that our stories shape us. I think of the way that we are trapped in our own histories, our own memories, our own stories.\n\nAnd I realize, the act of remembering is not just about the past, it is about the present. It is about the way that our memories shape our lives, our choices, our futures. It is about the way that our stories shape our understanding of ourselves, of others, of the world around us.\n\nI think of the way that memory can be a form of resistance, a way of pushing back against the forces of oppression, of marginalization, of erasure. I think of the way that memory can be a way of reclaiming our stories, our histories, our lives.\n\nAnd I wonder, what does it mean to resist? What does it mean to push back against the forces of oppression, of marginalization, of erasure? Does it mean that we are fighting against something? Does it mean that we are fighting for something? Or does it mean that we are simply being, simply existing, simply remembering?\n\nI think of the words of Audre Lorde, who said, \"When I dare to be powerful, to use my strength in the service of my vision, then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid.\" I think of the way that memory can be a source of power, a source of strength, a source of vision.\n\nAnd I realize, the act of remembering is not just about the past, it is about the future. It is about the way that our memories shape our visions, our dreams, our hopes. It is about the way that our stories shape our understanding of what is possible, of what can be.\n\nI think of the way that memory can be a form of resistance, a way of pushing back against the forces of oppression, of marginalization, of erasure.

Or does it mean that we are able to learn from the past, to grow from the past, to become something new?\n\nI think of the words of Adrienne Rich, who said, \"The moment of change is the only poem.\" I think of the way that memory can be a moment of change, a moment of transformation, a moment of becoming.\n\nAnd I realize, the act of remembering is not just about the past, it is about the present. It is about the way that our memories shape our lives, our choices, our futures. It is about the way that our stories shape our understanding of ourselves, of others, of the world around us.\n\nI think of the way that memory can be a form of resistance, a way of pushing back against the forces of oppression, of marginalization, of erasure.

What does it mean to be free from the forces of oppression, of marginalization, of erasure? Does it mean that we are able to move forward? Does it mean that we are able to become something new?\n\nI think of the way that memory can be a form of resistance, a way of pushing back against the forces of oppression, of marginalization, of erasure.
