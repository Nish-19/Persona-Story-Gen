        "writing_prompt": "Every morning, Will Solace wakes up next to Nico di Angelo, the love of his life, and every morning begins with laughter, kisses, and the occasional battle to get out of bed\u2014until one day, Nico suggests something that changes their routine forever.",
        "story": "\n\nMorning sunlight filtering through the curtains danced across Nico's face, illuminating the gentle curve of his lips and the dark wisps of hair that always seemed to fall across his forehead. Will couldn't help but smile as he gazed at his partner, feeling the warmth of their shared bed and the comfort of their morning routine. He leaned in, his lips brushing against Nico's in a soft, gentle kiss.\n\nNico stirred, his eyes fluttering open as he smiled back at Will. \"Morning,\" he mumbled, his voice husky from sleep.\n\nWill chuckled, his fingers tracing the lines of Nico's face. \"Morning, beautiful. Time to wake up.\"\n\nNico groaned, rolling onto his side and burying his face in the pillow. \"Five more minutes.\"\n\nWill laughed, snuggling closer to Nico's side. \"You know we can't sleep in today. We have a busy day ahead.\"\n\nTheir morning routine was a well-choreographed dance, with Will trying to rouse Nico from his slumber and Nico resisting with all his might. It was a game they played every morning, with Will using kisses, tickles, and playful teasing to coax Nico out of bed.\n\nBut today, as they were getting ready for the day, Nico dropped a bombshell. \"Hey, Will? I was thinking... why don't we start our mornings with something new?\"\n\nWill raised an eyebrow, intrigued. \"What did you have in mind?\"\n\nNico's eyes sparkled with excitement. \"I was thinking we could start a garden. You know, grow our own herbs and vegetables. It'll be fun, and we can use the fresh produce for our cooking.\"\n\nWill's eyes widened in surprise. He hadn't seen this coming. \"A garden? Nico, that's... unexpected.\"\n\nNico's face fell, and Will quickly reassured him. \"I mean, it's a great idea! I love it. But it's definitely a change from our usual morning routine.\"\n\nNico's smile returned, and he leaned in to kiss Will. \"That's the point. I want to mix things up a bit. We can still have our morning laughs and kisses, but now we'll have something new to look forward to.\"\n\nAs they spent the morning preparing the garden, Will realized that Nico's suggestion was more than just a change in routine \u2013 it was an opportunity for growth and exploration. They worked together, side by side, their hands touching as they planted seeds and watered the soil.\n\nAs the sun climbed higher in the sky, casting a warm glow over their little garden, Will turned to Nico and smiled. \"You know, I think this is going to be amazing.\"\n\nNico's eyes met his, and they shared a tender moment, the air filled with the promise of new beginnings. \"I'm glad you like the idea,\" Nico said, his voice low and husky.\n\nWill's heart swelled with love for this man, who always managed to surprise him and bring joy into his life. \"I love it,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"I love you.\"\n\nNico's face lit up with a radiant smile. \"I love you too, Will.\"\n\nAs they sealed their declaration with a kiss, the morning sunlight danced around them, casting a warm glow over their little garden and their love, which continued to grow stronger with each passing day."

        "writing_prompt": "Your partner insists you can look through their phone anytime, but when you do, you discover a collection of candid photos of yourself\u2014each one capturing a moment you didn\u2019t even realize was special.",
        "story": "\n\nI flopped onto the couch, phone-less and bored, and Will handed me his phone without a second thought. \"Hey, look through it if you want, I don't care,\" he said with a shrug, going back to his book. I raised an eyebrow, but he just smiled and continued reading.\n\nWe'd been together for a while now, and I was used to the easy trust between us. Still, I hesitated for a moment before scrolling through his phone. I was expecting the usual \u2013 memes, texts from friends, and maybe some work emails. But instead, I stumbled upon a folder labeled \"Nico\" with a bunch of photos inside.\n\nCuriosity got the better of me, and I opened the folder. The first photo was of me laughing, eyes scrunched up and mouth wide open, as I was trying to catch a particularly slippery fish in the River Styx. I didn't remember Will taking it, but the memory came flooding back \u2013 the sun was setting, and we were on a picnic, trying to relax after a long quest.\n\nAs I scrolled through the photos, I felt like I was reliving our time together. There was one of me sleeping on the bus, mouth slightly ajar, with a peaceful expression on my face. Another of me concentrating intensely on a puzzle, tongue stuck out of the corner of my mouth. Each photo captured a moment I hadn't even realized was special, but Will had seen the beauty in them.\n\nI felt a lump form in my throat as I looked at a photo of me and Will sitting on the beach, watching the sunset together. I was leaning on his shoulder, and he had his arm around me. It was a moment I remembered, but I hadn't realized it was so... intimate. So us.\n\nAs I continued scrolling, I noticed that the photos weren't just of me; they were of the moments we shared together. There was one of us making silly faces at each other during a particularly boring meeting, and another of us sharing a kiss under the mistletoe at Christmas.\n\nI looked up to find Will watching me, a soft smile on his face. \"You're really something else, you know that?\" I said, feeling a little overwhelmed.\n\nWill set his book aside and came over to sit next to me. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nI handed him the phone, and he took it, scrolling through the photos with a small smile. \"I just... I didn't realize you saw me like that. That you saw the beauty in all these little moments.\"\n\nWill looked up at me, his eyes shining with affection. \"I see the beauty in everything about you, Nico. Even when you're being ridiculous or sleepy or just plain you.\"\n\nI felt my heart swell with emotion, and I leaned in to kiss him. \"I love you,\" I whispered.\n\nWill's arms wrapped around me, holding me close. \"I love you too,\" he whispered back.\n\nAs we sat there, surrounded by the photos and the memories they held, I realized that sometimes the most special moments are the ones we don't even notice. And I was grateful to have someone like Will, who saw the beauty in everything, even when I didn't."

        "writing_prompt": "A mischievous makeup artist convinces their reluctant partner to star in a video, only to reveal a hilariously unexpected transformation\u2014what happens next?",
        "story": "\n\n\"Come on, it'll be fun! Just one little video,\" Nico wheedled, his eyes sparkling with mischief as he gazed at Will, who was lounging on the couch, engrossed in his book.\n\nWill raised an eyebrow, skeptical. \"What kind of video?\"\n\nNico grinned. \"A makeup transformation, of course! I've got a new look I want to try out, and I need a model. You're the perfect candidate.\"\n\nWill shook his head, chuckling. \"I don't know, Nico. I'm not exactly the makeup type.\"\n\nNico pouted, his lower lip jutting out. \"But it'll be fun, I promise! And think of all the views we'll get on YouTube. We can be famous!\"\n\nWill raised an eyebrow, amused by Nico's persistence. \"You're not going to let this go, are you?\"\n\nNico shook his head, his curls bouncing. \"Nope! Now, come on, it'll only take a few minutes. I promise I won't make you look too ridiculous.\"\n\nWill sighed, setting his book aside. \"Fine, but if I end up looking like a clown, I'm blaming you.\"\n\nNico whooped in triumph, dragging Will to the cluttered vanity in their home studio. The surface was overflowing with brushes, palettes, and tubes of colorful makeup. Nico began rummaging through the supplies, his eyes shining with excitement.\n\nAs Nico started applying the makeup, Will couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. Nico was chattering away, explaining the inspiration behind the look, which seemed to involve a lot of glitter and bright colors. Will's initial reluctance began to fade, replaced by curiosity.\n\nFinally, Nico stepped back, admiring his handiwork. Will gazed at his reflection, and his jaw dropped.\n\n\"I look like a disco ball!\" he exclaimed, staring at the explosion of rainbow colors across his face.\n\nNico cackled, clearly delighted. \"Isn't it fabulous? I call it 'Mythical Mermaid Chic'!\"\n\nWill couldn't help but laugh at his reflection. The makeup was outrageous, but somehow, it worked. He looked... sparkly.\n\nAs they filmed the reveal, Will's initial embarrassment gave way to giggles. Nico was having the time of his life, striking poses and making funny faces behind the camera.\n\nWhen they finished filming, Will turned to Nico, grinning. \"You know, that wasn't as terrible as I thought it would be.\"\n\nNico beamed, pleased with himself. \"Told you it'd be fun! And we make a pretty great team, if I do say so myself.\"\n\nWill chuckled, shaking his head. \"You're a menace, Nico di Angelo.\"\n\nNico just winked, snuggling up close. \"Hey, someone's got to keep life interesting around here.\"\n\nAs they uploaded the video to YouTube, Will couldn't help but wonder what other zany adventures Nico had in store for him."

        "writing_prompt": "While navigating the Labyrinth, Nico encounters a strange, freckled boy claiming to be from the future\u2014and his future boyfriend.",
        "story": "\n\nNico trudged through the Labyrinth, his senses on high alert as the walls seemed to shift and breathe around him, casting shadows that danced like phantoms. He had been navigating this ancient maze for what felt like hours, with no clear direction or purpose. The whispers of the Labyrinth swirled around him, secrets only the brave dared to uncover. Nico's eyes narrowed, his grip on his sword tightening as he turned a corner into a seemingly endless corridor.\n\nA figure emerged from the darkness, freckles scattered across his cheeks like constellations in the night sky. Nico's instincts screamed warning, but the boy's bright blue eyes sparkled with a warmth that put him at ease.\n\n\"Hey, Nico,\" the boy said, his voice husky and familiar.\n\nNico's brow furrowed. \"Do I know you?\"\n\nThe boy chuckled, a low, throaty sound. \"Not yet, but you will. I'm from the future\u2014and I'm your boyfriend.\"\n\nNico's laughter was immediate, incredulous. \"What? That's ridiculous!\"\n\nThe boy shrugged, his grin unwavering. \"I know this sounds crazy, but hear me out. I've been sent back to... Well, I'm not entirely sure why, but I think it's to meet you.\"\n\nNico raised an eyebrow. \"You expect me to believe you're from the future just because you say so?\"\n\nThe boy nodded, his expression deadpan. \"I know it sounds insane, but I have proof. You're going to love poptarts, especially the strawberry kind. And in a few years, you'll trip on a rock during a quest and face-plant in front of your friends. You'll also develop a weird obsession with collecting rare coins.\"\n\nNico's skepticism faltered, his mind reeling with the specificity of the boy's claims. How could he possibly know these things?\n\nAs they walked through the Labyrinth, the boy continued to share snippets of Nico's future, from his favorite snack to a yet-to-be-written prophecy. Nico's curiosity grew, despite his reservations. The boy's words painted a picture of a life he couldn't quite imagine, yet couldn't deny the excitement that stirred within him.\n\nThe Labyrinth's paths twisted and turned, leading them to a room filled with floating orbs that showed glimpses of possible futures. Nico's eyes widened as he saw himself standing alongside Percy, Annabeth, and other demigods he had yet to meet. The boy's hand brushed against his, sending a spark of electricity through his veins.\n\n\"Maybe the future isn't as set in stone as I thought,\" Nico mused, his gaze drifting back to the boy.\n\nThe boy's smile was soft, his eyes shining with a warmth that made Nico's heart skip a beat. \"I think that's what I'm here to show you.\"\n\nAs they explored the Labyrinth together, Nico found himself torn between his initial skepticism and the growing sense of connection with this enigmatic boy. The air was thick with the scent of ancient stone and magic, and Nico felt the Labyrinth whispering secrets in his ear, secrets only he dared to uncover.\n\nFor the first time in his life, Nico felt a sense of hope, a sense that his future might be more than just a predetermined path. The boy's presence had awakened a spark within him, a spark that ignited a sense of possibility.\n\nAs they navigated the ever-changing maze, Nico couldn't help but wonder: what other secrets lay hidden in the Labyrinth, waiting to be uncovered? And what lay ahead for him and this mysterious boy, who claimed to be his future boyfriend?\n\nThe Labyrinth's whispers seemed to grow louder, urging Nico to take a step forward, into the unknown. He glanced at the boy, his heart pounding in his chest.\n\n\"Tell me more,\" Nico said, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThe boy's smile was radiant, his eyes sparkling with a promise of adventures yet to come. \"I've got all the time in the world.\""

        "writing_prompt": "After surviving the horrors of Tartarus, Will and Nico have developed quiet rituals to soothe their lingering fears. One sleepless night, they find themselves dancing in the kitchen, holding each other close as the weight of their shared past fades into the rhythm of the present.",
        "story": "\n\nThe kitchen's soft glow cast a warm light on the quiet scene unfolding within its walls. Nico stood at the counter, staring out the window as the moon cast an ethereal glow on the darkness outside. The hum of the refrigerator provided a soothing background melody, a familiar comfort in the stillness of the night. Will's gentle footsteps broke the silence, his eyes finding Nico's as he approached. Without a word, Will wrapped his arms around Nico's waist, pulling him close as they stood together, lost in the tranquility of the moment.\n\nNico's eyes fluttered closed, his head finding the familiar curve of Will's shoulder. The soft music drifting from the living room \u2013 a lullaby of acoustic guitar and whispered lyrics \u2013 wove a tapestry of comfort around them. The song, one they'd listened to countless times during their recovery, held a deep significance, its melody a balm to their frayed nerves. As the notes wrapped around them, Nico's tension began to seep away, his breathing slowing in sync with the rhythm.\n\nWithout thinking, Will's hand found Nico's, his fingers intertwining with a gentle pressure. Nico's eyes opened, a flicker of hesitation crossing his face before he allowed Will to lead him into the open space of the kitchen. The soft music swelled, the guitar's gentle thrumming guiding their steps as they began to dance. It was a silent conversation, each step speaking of resilience and love, of the countless nights they'd weathered together.\n\nAs they moved, the shadows cast by the kitchen light danced around them, a reminder of the darkness they'd faced and overcome. Yet, in this moment, those shadows held no power. The music, the warmth of the kitchen, and the gentle pressure of Will's hand in his own created a sanctuary, a space where the horrors of Tartarus receded, and all that remained was the gentle ebb and flow of their love.\n\nNico's eyes met Will's, a soft smile spreading across his face as their bodies swayed to the music. The world outside, with all its dangers and uncertainties, melted away, leaving only the two of them, lost in the rhythm of their dance. In this moment, they were free \u2013 free from the weight of their past, free from the fears that still lingered in the recesses of their minds.\n\nAs the song drew to a close, Will's arms wrapped around Nico, holding him close as the final notes faded into the silence. They stood there, swaying gently, the only sound the soft hum of the refrigerator and the quiet beat of their hearts. In this stillness, they found peace, a sense of release from the burdens they'd carried for so long. As they held each other, the world outside receded, and all that remained was the warmth of their love, a flame that burned bright, illuminating the darkness, and guiding them forward, into a brighter future."
