    "<thinking>\nAnalyzing the Author History, I observe several recurring themes and stylistic patterns across the stories. Here are the short descriptive phrases summarizing each writing prompt:\n\n1. \"the story regarding a boy trapped decades in the past using drawings to preserve memories\"\n2. \"the story regarding meeting your younger self and the secrets that could unravel everything\"\n3. \"the story regarding waking up in different versions of life and discerning reality from dreams\"\n4. \"the story regarding rebuilding identity in a society valuing individuality over genetic perfection\"\n5. \"the story regarding a charity nature hike turning into a battle of survival and sabotage\"\n6. \"the story regarding a date haunted by the ghost of a late best friend\"\n7. \"the story regarding achieving dreams but facing an unraveling life and inner darkness\"\n8. \"the story regarding a former Crown Prince facing an uncertain future after choosing love over duty\"\n9. \"the story regarding learning about parents' wedding day through old photos and stories\"\n\nRecurring tendencies include a focus on complex emotional and psychological themes, the use of memory and identity as central motifs, and a preference for introspective and character-driven narratives. The author often explores the tension between past and present, reality and perception, and personal versus societal expectations. The stories frequently involve characters grappling with internal conflicts and the consequences of their choices, often set against a backdrop of speculative or slightly surreal elements.\n</thinking>\n\n<writing_style>\n### **Plot**  \n1. **The author structures narratives around the tension between past and present, often using memory as a pivotal element.**\n   -
