    "<thinking>\n- Detailed reasoning and analysis here on how the base_story differs from the ground-truth, organized by the four narrative categories:\n  1. **Plot**: The Ground Truth story employs a non-linear, fragmented structure, jumping between various memories and moments in time. It uses repetition and abrupt transitions to create a sense of disorientation and urgency. The narrative is driven by the protagonist's need to keep the monster at bay by constantly shifting through memories. The Base Story, on the other hand, follows a more linear progression, detailing the protagonist's encounters with the monster from childhood to adulthood, and their strategies to keep it contained.\n  2. **Creativity**: The Ground Truth story uses a highly imaginative approach, blending mundane activities like drinking coffee with surreal and intense memories, creating a vivid and chaotic mental landscape. It incorporates elements of psychological horror and surrealism. The Base Story is more straightforward, focusing on the protagonist's mental strategies and the monster's presence in a more conventional horror narrative.\n  3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Ground Truth story develops the protagonist through fragmented memories, revealing their past actions, emotions, and the consequences of their choices. The setting shifts rapidly between different locations and times, contributing to the sense of chaos. The Base Story provides a clearer, more linear development of the protagonist, with a focus on their growth and coping mechanisms over time. The settings are more stable and less varied.\n  4. **Language Use**: The Ground Truth story uses repetitive phrases, abrupt transitions, and vivid, often jarring descriptions to create a sense of urgency and disorientation. The language is fragmented and intense, reflecting the protagonist's mental state. The Base Story uses more conventional narrative techniques, with clear descriptions, steady pacing, and a more cohesive flow of events.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative in a non-linear, fragmented manner, jumping between various memories and moments in time.\n  - Use repetition and abrupt transitions to create a sense of disorientation and urgency.\n  - Drive the narrative through the protagonist's need to keep the monster at bay by constantly shifting through memories.\n  - Incorporate mundane activities and surreal, intense memories to create a vivid and chaotic mental landscape.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Blend mundane activities with surreal and intense memories to create a vivid and chaotic mental landscape.\n  - Incorporate elements of psychological horror and surrealism to enhance the narrative.\n  - Use highly imaginative and unconventional approaches to depict the protagonist's mental struggle.\n  - Create a vivid and chaotic mental landscape that reflects the protagonist's inner turmoil.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist through fragmented memories, revealing their past actions, emotions, and the consequences of their choices.\n  - Rapidly shift settings between different locations and times to contribute to the sense of chaos.\n  - Focus on the protagonist's mental state and their strategies to keep the monster contained.\n  - Use fragmented memories to reveal the protagonist's past actions, emotions, and the consequences of their choices.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use repetitive phrases, abrupt transitions, and vivid, often jarring descriptions to create a sense of urgency and disorientation.\n  - Employ fragmented and intense language to reflect the protagonist's mental state.\n  - Create a sense of urgency and disorientation through the use of repetitive phrases and abrupt transitions.\n  - Use vivid and jarring descriptions to enhance the chaotic and intense atmosphere of the narrative.\n</story_rules>",
