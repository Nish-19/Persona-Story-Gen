    "<thinking>\n- Detailed reasoning and analysis here on how the base_story differs from the ground-truth, organized by the four narrative categories:\n  1. **Plot**: The Ground Truth story presents a more personal and immediate conflict, focusing on the protagonist's reluctance and the dire situation of humanity. The narrative is driven by the protagonist's interaction with the aliens and the tension of potential surrender. The Base Story, on the other hand, has a broader and more hopeful plot, focusing on the possibility of an alliance and rebuilding.\n  2. **Creativity**: The Ground Truth story employs a darker, more ironic tone, with a twist that highlights humanity's stubbornness and self-destructive tendencies. The Base Story leans towards a more conventional sci-fi narrative with a hopeful twist, emphasizing cooperation and mutual benefit.\n  3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Ground Truth story develops its characters through their flaws and desperate circumstances, creating a gritty and raw portrayal of the post-apocalyptic world. The setting is bleak and emphasizes the devastation. The Base Story develops its protagonist as an ordinary person thrust into an extraordinary situation, with a setting that, while devastated, holds potential for renewal.\n  4. **Language Use**: The Ground Truth story uses a more colloquial and direct language style, with a focus on internal monologue and dialogue that conveys the protagonist's anxiety and defiance. The Base Story uses more descriptive and formal language, with a focus on creating a vivid and immersive atmosphere.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with the protagonist's immediate reaction to being chosen, emphasizing their reluctance and the dire state of humanity.\n  - Focus on the tension and conflict between the protagonist and the aliens, highlighting the potential for surrender and the protagonist's defiance.\n  - Include a twist that underscores humanity's stubbornness and self-destructive tendencies, leading to a dramatic and impactful conclusion.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Employ a darker, more ironic tone throughout the narrative, using humor and irony to highlight the absurdity and desperation of the situation.\n  - Integrate unconventional elements, such as the protagonist's flawed background and the bleakness of the post-apocalyptic world, to create a unique and engaging story.\n  - Use imaginative descriptions of the aliens and their technology, emphasizing their otherworldliness and the protagonist's awe and fear.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as a flawed and reluctant hero, using their background and internal monologue to create a multidimensional character.\n  - Create a gritty and immersive setting that emphasizes the devastation and hopelessness of the post-apocalyptic world.\n  - Use secondary characters to highlight the diversity and desperation of the remaining survivors, adding depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use colloquial and direct language to convey the protagonist's anxiety and defiance, creating an immediate and engaging narrative voice.\n  - Focus on internal monologue and dialogue to develop the protagonist's character and convey their emotions and thoughts.\n  - Employ vivid and imaginative descriptions to create a sense of otherworldliness and tension, particularly in the scenes involving the aliens and their technology.\n</story_rules>",
