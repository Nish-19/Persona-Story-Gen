    "<thinking>\n- Detailed reasoning and analysis here on how the base_story differs from the ground-truth, organized by the four narrative categories:\n  1. **Plot**:\n     - The Ground Truth story focuses on a single day and a specific interaction between Imogen and Euryale, emphasizing the mystery and emotional depth of their relationship. The plot is more introspective and character-driven, with a subtle revelation about the statues.\n     - The Base Story has a broader scope, covering multiple days and a significant event (the threat to the garden and the subsequent community effort to save it). It includes a clear conflict and resolution, making it more plot-driven and action-oriented.\n  2. **Creativity**:\n     - The Ground Truth story uses a more subtle and atmospheric approach, creating a sense of mystery and emotional depth through the interactions and the setting. It hints at the supernatural without explicitly stating it.\n     - The Base Story incorporates more overt elements of mythology and community action, blending the protagonist's blindness with the magical realism of the garden and the statues.\n  3. **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n     - The Ground Truth story develops the characters through their dialogue and interactions, focusing on their emotional states and the nuances of their relationship. The setting is described in a way that enhances the mood and themes of the story.\n     - The Base Story provides more background on the protagonist's daily life and the garden, with detailed descriptions of the setting and the statues. The characters are developed through their actions and the broader narrative arc.\n  4. **Language Use**:\n     - The Ground Truth story uses a more poetic and introspective language, with a focus on creating an immersive atmosphere and conveying the characters' emotions. The dialogue is natural and reveals character depth.\n     - The Base Story uses a more straightforward and descriptive language, with a focus on advancing the plot and providing clear imagery. The dialogue is functional and serves to move the story forward.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Focus on a single day or a specific interaction to create a more intimate and character-driven narrative.\n  - Emphasize the mystery and emotional depth of the relationship between the protagonist and the Greek lady.\n  - Introduce subtle revelations about the statues and the Greek lady's past without resolving all mysteries.\n  - Avoid broad, action-oriented plot developments; keep the story introspective and focused on personal interactions.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use a subtle and atmospheric approach to create a sense of mystery and emotional depth.\n  - Hint at supernatural or mythological elements without explicitly stating them.\n  - Blend the protagonist's blindness with the sensory details of the setting to create a unique perspective.\n  - Focus on the emotional and psychological aspects of the characters' interactions rather than external conflicts.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through their dialogue and interactions, revealing their emotional states and relationship dynamics.\n  - Create an immersive setting that enhances the mood and themes of the story, using sensory details that the blind protagonist can perceive.\n  - Keep the setting consistent and familiar, emphasizing its role as a sanctuary for the protagonist.\n  - Use the setting to reflect the characters' inner lives and the themes of the story.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ poetic and introspective language to create an immersive atmosphere and convey the characters' emotions.\n  - Use natural and revealing dialogue to develop character depth and advance the narrative.\n  - Focus on sensory descriptions that the blind protagonist can perceive, such as sounds, textures, and scents.\n  - Maintain a consistent tone that reflects the introspective and emotional nature of the story.\n</story_rules>",
