    "<thinking>\nTo create the **Combined Author Writing Sheet**, I will analyze the claims and evidence from both the **Previous Combined Author Writing Sheet** and the **Current Author Writing Sheet**. I will follow the algorithm provided to merge equivalent claims and include unique claims as-is. Here is the detailed plan:\n\n### Plot\n1. **Identify Equivalent Claims:**\n   - The claim about structuring the narrative with a delayed revelation from the current sheet is similar to the previous claim about structuring the narrative around internal conflict and psychological struggles, as both involve a reflective narrative style. However, they focus on different aspects (delayed revelation vs. psychological struggles), so they will remain separate.\n   - The claim about structuring the narrative with a non-linear timeline from the previous sheet is distinct from the current claim about delayed revelation, so they will remain separate.\n\n2. **Unique Claims:**\n   - The current claim about structuring the story with a delayed revelation is unique and will be included as-is.\n   - The previous claims about sibling estrangement and ordinary characters in extraordinary situations are unique and will be included as-is.\n\n### Creativity\n1. **Identify Equivalent Claims:**\n   - The current claim about integrating elements of mystery and introspection is similar to the previous claim about integrating psychological realism, as both involve introspection.
