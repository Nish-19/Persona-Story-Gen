[7]\n\n2. **The author structures the narrative around a gradual realization of emotions through interactions rather than direct confrontation.**\n   - Evidence: In the story regarding \"Obi-Wan noticing a pattern in his choices linked to Cody's lipstick color,\" the author writes, \"Obi-Wan bites back a curse and stands, drawing his tray close to his chest. He\u2019d thought that he was being careful with his crush on the other man, keeping it close to his chest and obfuscated behind several very plausible reasons for his level of attention, of care.\" [6]\n\n3. **The author structures the narrative around a single, pivotal moment of emotional revelation.**\n   - Evidence: The narrative builds up to the moment when Cody and Obi-Wan share a fruit from Kamino, leading to a kiss that signifies the culmination of their unspoken feelings. [2]\n\n### **Creativity**\n\n1. **The author uses vivid sensory imagery to enhance the emotional depth of the narrative.**\n   - Evidence: Cody's experience with the fruit: \"Juice floods his mouth, escaping down his cheeks and onto the fabric and he chases after it, tasting a home he never thought he would know again.\" [2]\n\n2. **The author integrates introspective elements to reinterpret the prompt, focusing on Cody's internal journey.**\n   - Evidence: In the story regarding \"Cody navigating a new life in the Jedi Temple with Obi-Wan,\" the author delves into Cody's thoughts and emotions, such as when Cody considers his love for Obi-Wan, \"He is in love with Obi-Wan. He has been since that first battlefield with blood pouring down the side of his face.\" [5]\n\n3. **The author creatively integrates domestic and mundane details to enhance character relationships.**\n   - Evidence: In the story regarding \"a graduation reunion amidst chaos and uncertainty,\" the author includes a scene where Cody recalls Obi-Wan ironing a shirt with a cigarette in his mouth, which adds a layer of domesticity and familiarity to their relationship, contrasting with the typical grandeur of a graduation setting. [7]\n\n### **Development (Character and Setting)**\n\n1. **The author develops characters through detailed introspection and emotional depth, using sensory descriptions and personal interactions.**\n   - Evidence: In the story regarding \"a graduation reunion amidst chaos and uncertainty,\" Cody's recognition of Obi-Wan's shirt and the scent of his shampoo are used to deepen the connection between them, as Cody notes the \"sharp artificial scent of Obi-Wan\u2019s shampoo\" and the \"rich scent of his cologne,\" which evokes a sense of closeness and familiarity. [7]\n\n2. **The author establishes an immersive setting by using detailed and sensory descriptions that reflect the protagonist's emotional state.**\n   - Evidence: The setting is vividly described, mirroring Cody's journey: \"The lake is still, perfectly flat and it reflects the moon overhead like a mirror.\" [3]\n\n3. **The author develops characters through intimate and playful interactions that reveal deeper emotions.**\n   - Evidence: In the story regarding \"Obi-Wan noticing a pattern in his choices linked to Cody's lipstick color,\" the interaction between Obi-Wan and Quinlan, where Quinlan leans forward, propping his chin onto Obi-Wan\u2019s shoulder, showcases their close relationship and provides insight into Obi-Wan's internal conflict. [6]\n\n### **Language Use**\n\n1. **The author employs vivid sensory imagery to create an immersive and intimate atmosphere.**\n   - Evidence: In the story regarding \"a graduation reunion amidst chaos and uncertainty,\" the author uses sensory details like \"the sharp artificial scent of Obi-Wan\u2019s shampoo\" and \"the rich scent of his cologne\" to draw the reader into the moment, enhancing the emotional depth of Cody and Obi-Wan's reunion. [7]\n\n2. **The author uses a narrative perspective that blends internal monologue with external action, creating a seamless flow between thought and reality.**\n   - Evidence: Cody's internal thoughts are interwoven with his actions, as seen when he reflects on his task while sewing: \"He lowers his head and begins to work.\" [3]\n\n</combined_author_sheet>",
