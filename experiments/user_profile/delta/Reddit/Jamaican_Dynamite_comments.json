    "<thinking>\n- Detailed reasoning and analysis here on how the base_story differs from the ground-truth, organized by the four narrative categories:\n  1. **Plot**:\n     - The Ground Truth story focuses on a single, intense scene in the kitchen, where the parents discuss their son Zane's otherworldly nature and experience a dramatic confrontation. The plot is tightly contained within this setting and time frame, creating a sense of immediacy and tension.\n     - The Base Story, on the other hand, spans several years, detailing the gradual realization of the son's otherworldly nature and culminating in his departure. It follows a more traditional narrative arc with a clear beginning, middle, and end.\n  2. **Creativity**:\n     - The Ground Truth story employs dark humor and irony, particularly in the parents' dialogue and reactions to their son's behavior. The story blends elements of horror and domestic drama in a unique way.\n     - The Base Story is more straightforward in its approach, focusing on the sci-fi elements and the emotional journey of the parents as they come to terms with their son's true nature.\n  3. **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n     - The Ground Truth story develops its characters through their interactions and dialogue, revealing their personalities and emotions in a confined setting. The setting of the kitchen is used effectively to create a claustrophobic atmosphere.\n     - The Base Story provides a broader view of the characters' lives, showing their development over time. The settings change as the story progresses, but they are described in less detail compared to the Ground Truth story.\n  4. **Language Use**:\n     - The Ground Truth story uses concise, impactful dialogue and vivid descriptions to create a tense and immersive atmosphere. The language is sharp and often laced with irony.\n     - The Base Story uses more descriptive language and a reflective tone, focusing on the internal thoughts and emotions of the narrator. The dialogue is more formal and less dynamic.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Focus on a single, intense scene that takes place in a confined setting, creating a sense of immediacy and tension.\n  - Develop the plot through dialogue and interactions between characters, rather than through a series of events over time.\n  - Introduce and resolve the central conflict within the same scene, maintaining a tight narrative structure.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Incorporate dark humor and irony into the characters' dialogue and reactions to create a unique blend of horror and domestic drama.\n  - Use unconventional and imaginative elements to reinterpret the prompt, such as the parents' casual yet tense discussion about their son's otherworldly nature.\n  - Blend genres seamlessly, ensuring that the horror elements are grounded in the everyday setting and interactions.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through their interactions and dialogue, revealing their personalities, emotions, and relationships in a confined setting.\n  - Create a claustrophobic atmosphere by focusing on a single, detailed setting, such as a kitchen, and using it to enhance the tension and drama.\n  - Show the characters' emotional arcs through their reactions and conversations, rather than through internal monologues or extended descriptions.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use concise, impactful dialogue to drive the narrative and reveal character dynamics.\n  - Employ vivid descriptions to create an immersive and tense atmosphere, focusing on sensory details and the characters' immediate surroundings.\n  - Maintain a sharp and often ironic tone, using language that reflects the characters' complex emotions and the dark humor of the situation.\n  - Ensure that the pacing is tight, with each line of dialogue and description contributing to the overall tension and progression of the scene.\n</story_rules>",
