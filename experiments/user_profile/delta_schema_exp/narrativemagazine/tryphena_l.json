    "<thinking>\nTo create the **Combined Author Writing Sheet**, I will analyze the claims and examples from both the **Previous Combined Author Writing Sheet** and the **Current Author Writing Sheet**. I will identify equivalent claims, merge them where appropriate, and ensure that unique claims are included as-is. Here\u2019s the detailed analysis and plan:\n\n### Plot\n- **Previous Claim:** Focuses on structuring the narrative around a child's internal conflict using symbolic actions.\n- **Current Claim:** Emphasizes structuring the plot around internal conflict and emotional struggle rather than external events.\n\n**Plan:** These claims are equivalent as they both highlight the author's focus on internal conflict. I will merge them, selecting the most representative example.\n\n### Creativity\n- **Previous Claim:** Highlights the use of imaginative symbolism to convey emotional turmoil.\n- **Current Claim:** Focuses on integrating cultural and societal elements to reinterpret the prompt uniquely.\n\n**Plan:** These claims are not equivalent.
