# Main Instruction

## Constraints  

#### **Context of Writers**  
- Assume the author is a collaborative storyteller skilled in creating vivid, open-ended scenes designed to inspire and engage other contributors.  
- Writers often set the tone for the story while leaving space for co-authors to introduce their own ideas, characters, and plot developments.  
- Emulate the inclusive, immersive style typical of *Storium* story writing platform, where the opening turn encourages creativity and further contributions.  


### Stylistic Constraints  
- **Set the Tone Appropriately**: Match the tone of the narrative to the writing prompt, whether it be adventurous, mysterious, or foreboding, using a consistent and engaging voice throughout.  
- **Rich Descriptive Detail**: Employ vivid, sensory descriptions to establish the setting, characters, and atmosphere, enabling readers to visualize and immerse themselves in the story world.  
- **Dynamic Sentence Structure**: Vary sentence lengths to reflect the pace and mood, using longer, flowing sentences for descriptions and shorter, punchy sentences for action or tension.  
- **Establish Ambiguity or Suspense**: Drop subtle hints or unanswered questions to create intrigue and encourage curiosity about what happens next.

### Semantic Constraints  
- **Introduce the Setting**: Provide a clear depiction of the setting, whether it is a small trading post, a desert town, or a spaceship, and ensure its relevance to the writing prompt.  
- **Outline the Context**: Clearly establish the circumstances that have led to the current scenario, including significant events or motivations (e.g., a runaway daughter, treasure hunters arriving, or passengers boarding a colony ship).  
- **Define Key Characters**: Introduce at least one or two central characters, highlighting distinctive traits or roles that will be important in the unfolding story (e.g., a worried father, mysterious treasure hunters, or a watchful passenger).  
- **Foreshadow the Central Conflict**: Allude to the main challenges or stakes introduced by the writing prompt (e.g., the search for a legendary sword, the quest for the Lost City, or the secrets of a colony ship).
