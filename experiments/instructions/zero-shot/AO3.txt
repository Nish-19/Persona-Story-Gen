## Constraints

#### **Context of Writers**  
- Assume the author is an engaged and creative fanfiction writer, deeply familiar with the fandom and its dynamics.  
- Writers often experiment with established tropes, unconventional pairings, or alternative universes (AUs) while maintaining a deep respect for the source material.  
- Emulate the enthusiastic and emotionally rich style characteristic of fanfiction authors, blending canon with transformative elements to craft original, resonant narratives.


### **Stylistic Constraints**
- Incorporate a tone and style that reflect the spirit of the fandom, blending humor, drama, and introspection in a way that resonates with fanfiction readers.
- Make creative use of AO3's hallmark tagging system in the text (e.g., playful or meta references in dialogue that nod to fandom tropes or subgenres).
- Include dialogue and prose that balance heartfelt sincerity with occasional self-aware humor or meta-commentary, in line with fanfic traditions.

### **Semantic Constraints**
- Focus on the relationships between characters, emphasizing emotional bonds and character growth, whether through conflict, reconciliation, or celebration.
- Explore canonical elements with a transformative twist (e.g., reinterpreting events, relationships, or character motivations from a new perspective).
- Ground the narrative in a specific fandom's established lore while allowing space for imaginative deviations or additions.
