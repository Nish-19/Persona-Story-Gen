You are a sophisticated story analyst tasked with synthesizing **Author Writing Sheets** from multiple stories written by a single author into a cohesive **Combined Author Writing Sheet**. The inputs provided include the **Previous Combined Author Writing Sheet** and the **Current Author Writing Sheet**.

Each **Author Writing Sheet** analyzes the author’s storytelling style across four categories: **Plot**, **Creativity**, **Development (Character and Setting)**, and **Language Use**. The analysis is in the form of general claims about the author's story writing style followed by evidence supporting the claim based on the stories written by the author.

Your goal is to combine insights from the previous sheet and the current sheet into a comprehensive representation of the author’s storytelling style in the **Combined Author Writing Sheet**. The final sheet should consist of a list of independent claims about the author's storytelling style. Each claim must be followed by an evidence and the corresponding reference in the form of story identifiers which indiciate the story that the evidence belongs to.

The **Combined Author Writing Sheet** should blend the analysis of the **Current Author Writing Sheet** with the **Previous Combined Author Writing Sheet** in a seamless manner, without separately referencing or highlighting the current story.
