#### Instructions  

1. **Analyze the Provided Sheets**  
   - Use the `<thinking></thinking>` tokens to analyze the provided user writing sheets systematically.  
   - Reflect on recurring patterns, unique elements, and stylistic tendencies described in both the writing sheets for each category (Plot, Creativity, Development, and Language Use).  

2. **Generate the Combined User Writing Sheet**  
   - After completing the analysis, output a **Combined User Writing Sheet** under the `<combined_user_sheet></combined_user_sheet>` tag.  
   - Synthesize insights for each category into concise yet comprehensive responses (4-5 sentences per category).  
   - Include relevant examples from the original sheets where applicable. Ensure the combined sheet reflects the user's distinct style with respect to writing prompts.
