## Input Details
- **Author History**: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a single writing instance with the following keys:
  - **Writing Prompt**: The scenario or theme for which the story is written.
  - **Author-Written Story**: The author’s unique interpretation of the corresponding writing prompt.

## Output Format
1. First, use the `<thinking></thinking>` tokens to think deeply about patterns and recurring tendencies across the Author History. Analyze the list of writing prompts and author-written stories to identify overarching themes, stylistic patterns, and narrative tendencies based on the storytelling aspects. Also, think of a short descriptive phrase summarizing each writing prompt (e.g., “the story regarding ‘child soldiers baiting summoners’”) to frame the evidence in your output.

2. Next, output your analysis in the `<writing_style></writing_style>` tokens. For each storytelling aspect:
   i. Provide **independent claims** about the author’s writing tendencies. These should reflect general writing tendencies without referencing specific story details or individual writing prompts.
   ii. Support each claim with **one piece of contextualized evidence** from the Author History. Use the short descriptive phrase summarizing the relevant writing prompt (obtained earlier in the `<thinking>` tokens) to frame the evidence. Ensure that evidence is either short excerpts (taken verbatim) from the author-written stories or concise summaries of relevant story excerpts tied to their respective writing prompts.
   iii. Prefer to use evidence verbatim from the story text wherever applicable.
   iv. Aim to provide around 5-10 **independent claims** (not more than 10) for every aspect.

## Guidelines for Claims
- Claims must be unique and **should not repeat insights**.
- Claims must reflect **broader patterns or tendencies** in the author’s writing style, expressed in a **concise and evidence-based** manner. Claims must avoid being tied to specific details of individual stories (e.g., plot points, characters, or settings). Instead, they should present generalized observations about the author’s overall writing style and recurring traits (e.g., “The author tends to use vivid, sensory imagery to create an immersive atmosphere”).
- Claims must not use the terms "Author-Written Story" or refer to individual writing prompts explicitly.
- Claims must not include adverbs of time like "often," "frequently," "sometimes," etc., to ensure they remain precise and grounded in the evidence provided.
- Claims must be written in **simple and clear language**, avoiding unnecessary literary jargon or overly complex phrasing.
- Claims must not include references to characters or settings outside the stories or assume the reader has general knowledge about external references.
- Each claim must be written in a way that it is **perfectly supported by the chosen contextualized evidence**. Avoid including any phrases or interpretations in the claim that are not explicitly demonstrated by the evidence provided.

---

## Guidelines for Evidence
- **Drawn from Author History**: Evidence must be drawn from the author-written stories within the Author History and explicitly tied to the relevant writing prompt.
- **Use a Framing Phrase**: Use the short descriptive phrase to frame the evidence in the context of the relevant writing prompt. For example:
  - “In the story regarding ‘child soldiers baiting summoners,’ the author uses log entries to create a sense of realism.”
- **Evidence Must Be Explicitly Supported by the Stories**: Ensure that the evidence is directly drawn from the stories and clearly aligns with the details provided in the narrative. Avoid vague or inferred connections not substantiated by the text.
- **Provide Context to Clarify the Evidence's Relevance**: Include sufficient context from the stories to make the evidence's relevance to the claim clear. Avoid isolating details that may lose their meaning or significance without additional background.
- **Avoid Over-Interpretation or Over-Extrapolation**: Ensure the evidence remains grounded in the stories' content and does not overstate or exaggerate its implications. Avoid adding meaning that cannot be reasonably inferred from the text.
- **Review Evidence Soundness**: Ensure evidence fully supports the described claim and avoid any contradictions with the overall body of the author’s work.

## Guidelines for Analysis

Your task is to analyze the author’s story writing style and extract **unique insights** into their storytelling tendencies across the storytelling aspects. Additionally, feel free to include other tendencies that are important for capturing the author’s unique style, even if they are not explicitly mentioned in the storytelling aspect. Aim to include around 5-10 **independent claims** (not more than 10) for every storytelling aspect mentioned below.

## Categories for Analysis
### Plot
Analyze how the author structures the story, introduces conflict, engages with the prompt, and resolves the narrative.

### Creativity
Analyze the author’s approach to blending genres, unconventional reinterpretation of the prompt, and integration of imaginative and unique elements in the story

### Development (Character and Setting)
Examine the author’s methods for developing multidimensional characters, creating emotional arcs, and establishing immersive settings tied to the story's tone and themes.

### Language Use
