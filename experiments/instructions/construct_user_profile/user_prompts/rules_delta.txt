### Instructions

1. **Analyze the Writing Prompt**  
   - Carefully analyze the provided writing prompt. Identify key thematic elements, tone, narrative possibilities, and character or plot directions implied or explicitly stated in the prompt.

2. **Refer to the User Profile**  
   - Use the details in the user profile to understand the user’s storytelling style. Pay close attention to their preferences in **Plot**, **Creativity**, **Development (Character and Setting)**, and **Language Use**.  
   - Ensure that the Story Rules reflect the stylistic traits, thematic choices, and narrative structures typical of the user, as described in their profile.

3. **Mimic the Examples**:
   - Use the style, structure, and level of detail in the examples as a guide for creating the new **Story Rules**.
   - Ensure the rules reflect the tone and creativity of the user's story rules demonstrated in the examples.

4. **Synthesize Detailed Story Rules**  
   - Combine insights from the prompt analysis and the user profile to generate comprehensive Story Rules.  
   - Ensure the rules include specific elements from the prompt while adhering to the storytelling style described in the user profile.  
   - Write the Story Rules in the form of **direct second-person instructions** that are clear, actionable, and emulate the user’s storytelling style.
   - Avoid using comparative or relative terms (e.g., "similar to," "like in," "adjust"). Rules must be absolute and directly applicable.
