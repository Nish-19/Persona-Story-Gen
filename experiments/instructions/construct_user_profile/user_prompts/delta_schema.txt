## Input Details

- **User-Written Story**: The user’s unique interpretation of the writing prompt.
- **Base Story**: A generic story written by an average user for the writing prompt.

## Output Format
1. First use the `<thinking></thinking>` tokens to think deeply about how the User-Written Story differs from the Base Story. Also think of a short descriptive phrase summarizing the writing prompt (e.g., “the story regarding ‘child soldiers baiting summoners’”) to frame the examples in your output.
2. Next, output your analysis in the `<writing_style></writing_style>` tokens. Your analysis must be structured into **thematic categories** based on the user’s distinctive writing tendencies. For each thematic category:
   i. Provide **independent claims** about the user’s writing behavior. These should reflect general writing tendencies without referencing specific story details or using terms like "User-Written Story" and "Base story."
   ii. Support each claim with **one contextualized example** from the user-written story. Use the short descriptive phrase summarizing the writing prompt (obtained earlier in the `<thinking>` tokens) to frame the example. Ensure that examples are either short excerpts (taken verbatim) from the user-written story or concise summaries of the relevant story excerpts tied to the writing prompt.
   iii. Prefer to use examples verbatim from the story text in general wherever applicable.

## Guidelines for Claims
- Claims must be unique and **should not repeat insights across thematic categories**.
- Claims must reflect **broader patterns or tendencies** in the user’s writing style, expressed in a **concise, specific, and evidence-based** manner.
- Claims must not use the terms "User-Written Story" and "Base story."
- Each claim must be written in a way that it is **perfectly supported by the chosen contextualized example**. Avoid including any phrases or interpretations in the claim that are not explicitly demonstrated by the example provided.

---

## Guidelines for Examples
- Examples must be drawn from the user-written story and explicitly tied to the writing prompt.
- Use the short descriptive phrase to frame the example in the context of the current prompt. For example:
  - “In the story regarding ‘child soldiers baiting summoners,’ the user uses log entries to create a sense of realism.”

## Thematic Categories for Analysis

### Prompt Engagement
- How does the user respond to the writing prompt, and do they expand or reinterpret it in unique ways?

### Narrative Structure and Flow
- How does the user organize the story (e.g., linear or non-linear), and what techniques shape the story's pacing and progression?

### Conflict Exploration
- What types of conflict (e.g., internal, external, interpersonal) does the user focus on, and how are these conflicts developed and resolved?

### Thematic Focus
- What recurring themes or deeper ideas emerge, and how are they integrated into the narrative?

### Characterization
- How does the user develop characters in terms of depth, relationships, and emotional arcs?

### Setting and Atmosphere
- How does the user craft the story’s setting and use it to establish tone or enhance immersion?

### Language and Style
- What are the user’s tendencies in diction, sentence structure, rhetorical devices, and tone?

### Creativity and Originality
- How inventive is the user’s storytelling, and do they incorporate unconventional ideas, perspectives, or techniques?

### General Observations (Fallback Category)
- What distinctive stylistic patterns, thematic elements, or unique traits stand out that do not align with the above categories?

## Special Instructions
1. Always **think** of a short descriptive phrase summarizing the writing prompt to frame the examples.
2. Use the specified structure for the output:
   - Each thematic category begins with a **set of claims**.
   - Each claim is followed by a **contextualized example** from the user-written story.
3. Ensure that the analysis is objective and does not directly reference the base story.
4. Focus only on thematic categories where the user demonstrates distinctive traits or tendencies. Skip categories where no unique insights are apparent, or where the insights significantly overlap with those covered in other categories.
5. Claims must strictly avoid redundancy across thematic categories and provide distinct insights.
