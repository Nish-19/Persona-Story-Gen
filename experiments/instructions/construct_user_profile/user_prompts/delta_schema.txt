## Input Details
- **Writing Prompt**: Describes the scenario or theme for which the stories are written.
- **User-Written Story**: The user’s unique interpretation of the writing prompt.
- **Base Story**: A generic story written by an average user for the writing prompt.


## Output Format
1. First use the <thinking></thinking> tokens to think deeply about how the User-Written Story differs from the Base Story. Also think of a short descriptive phrase summarizing the writing prompt (e.g., “the story regarding ‘child soldiers baiting summoners’”).
2. Next, output your analysis in the <writing_style></writing_style> tokens. Your analysis must be structured into four categories: **Plot**, **Creativity**, **Development (Character and Setting)**, and **Language Use**. For each category:
i. Provide **independent claims** about the user’s writing behavior. These should reflect general writing tendencies without referencing specific story details or using terms like "User-Written Story" and "Base story".
ii. Support each claim with a **contextualized example** from the user-written story. Use the short descriptive phrase summarizing the writing prompt (obtained earlier in the <thinking> tokens) to contextualize the example. Ensure that examples are either short excerpts from the user-written story or concise summaries of the relevant story excerpts tied to the writing prompt.

## Guidelines for Claims
- Claims must be unique and **should not repeat across categories**.
- Claims must reflect general observations about the user’s writing tendencies (e.g., “The user frequently employs satire to reinterpret prompts”).
- Claims must not using the terms "User-Written Story" and "Base story".

## Guidelines for Examples
- Examples must be drawn from the user-written story and explicitly tied to the writing prompt.
- Use the short descriptive phrase to frame the example in the context of the current prompt. For example:
  - “In the story regarding ‘child soldiers baiting summoners,’ the user uses log entries to create a sense of realism.”

## Categories for Analysis
### Plot
Evaluate how the user structures the story, introduces conflict, engages with the prompt, and resolves the narrative.

### Creativity
Analyze the user’s approach to blending genres, using humor or irony, reinterpreting the prompt, and integrating unconventional or imaginative elements.

### Development (Character and Setting)
Examine the user’s methods for developing multidimensional characters, creating emotional arcs, and establishing immersive settings tied to the story's tone and themes.

### Language Use
Assess how the user employs descriptive language, pacing, dialogue, rhetorical devices, figures of speech, and tone to create an engaging and immersive narrative.

## Special Instructions
1. Always **think** of a short descriptive phrase summarizing the writing prompt to frame the examples.
2. Use the specified structure for the output:
   - Each category begins with a **set of claims**.
   - Each claim is followed by a **contextualized example** from the user-written story.
3. Ensure that the analysis is objective and does not directly reference the base story.
4. Claims must avoid repeating across categories to maintain distinct insights.
5. Claims must not use the words "User-Written Story" and "Base story".

## Example Output Structure
### Plot
1. **Claim about user’s writing style.**
   - Example: In the story regarding “short description of the prompt,” <example from the user-written story>.

### Creativity
1. **Claim about user’s writing style.**
   - Example: In the story regarding “short description of the prompt,” <example from the user-written story>.
