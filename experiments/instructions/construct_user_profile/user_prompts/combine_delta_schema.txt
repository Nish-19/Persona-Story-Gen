#### Instructions  

1. **Analyze the Provided Sheets**  
   - Use the `<thinking></thinking>` tokens to analyze the provided user writing sheets systematically.  
   - Reflect on recurring patterns, unique elements, and stylistic tendencies described in both the writing sheets for each category (Plot, Creativity, Development, and Language Use).
   - Plan on synthesizing this above information into **Combined User Writing Sheet** as a list of claims and their correspoding examples for every category above based on the algorithm (Algorithm (Merge Step)) below.

2. **Generate the Combined User Writing Sheet**  

**Algorithm (Merge Step):**

**Input:**  
- **Previous Combined User Writing Sheet**  
- **Current User Writing Sheet**  

**Output:**  
- **Combined User Writing Sheet**

**Steps:**

1. For all categories (Plot, Creativity, Development, and Language Use), group similar claims from the **Previous Combined User Writing Sheet** and the **Current User Writing Sheet**.
   - Identify overlapping claims based on semantic similarity and organize them into groups.
   
2. For each group of similar claims:  
   a. **Select the Best Example:** Choose the most representative example from either the previous sheet or the current sheet. Favor examples that are verbatim excerpts from the story over paraphrased ones.  
   b. **Rewrite the Claim:** Based on the selected example, rewrite the claim so that it is fully supported by the example. The rewritten claim must not include additional content that cannot be directly inferred from the chosen example.  

3. For all **ungrouped (dissimilar or unique)** claims in both the previous sheet and the current sheet:  
   a. Include them as-is in the combined sheet along with their respective examples.

4. Organize the combined claims and their respective examples into the final structure for the **Combined User Writing Sheet**, ensuring that each category is comprehensive and free of duplicate or contradictory claims.

3. Ensure that:  
   - Each claim is concise, reflects a general writing tendency, and does not include terms like "ground-truth story" or "base story."  
   - Each claim includes its respective example along with a story reference in the form `[k]`, where `k` corresponds to the story identifier.  
   - Verbose or overly specific claims are refined into broader insights if they occur repeatedly across stories.

#### Input Format  
- The **Previous Combined User Writing Sheet**, **Story Identifier**, **Current Writing Prompt**, and the corresponding **Current User Writing Sheet** for the current prompt (as a Python Dictionary - "Previous_Information", and "Current_Information").

#### Output Format  
<thinking>  
Add your analysis of recurring patterns, unique elements, and stylistic tendencies across both the user writing sheets. Address the categories **Plot**, **Creativity**, **Development (Character and Setting)**, and **Language Use** systematically. Include the plan for executing the Merge Step Algorithm to generate the **Combined User Writing Sheet**.
</thinking>  
<combined_user_sheet>  

### **Plot**  

[Combine insights on the unique aspects of how the user structures the story, introduces conflict, engages with the prompt, and resolves the narrative.]

1. **Claim about user’s writing style.**
   - Example: In the story regarding “short description of the prompt,” <example from the user-written story>. [k]

### **Creativity**  

[Combine insights on the unique aspects of the user’s approach to blending genres, using humor or irony, reinterpreting the prompt, and integrating unconventional or imaginative elements.]

Include claim and example in the format specified above.

### **Development (Character and Setting)**  

[Combine insights on the unique aspects of the user’s methods for developing multidimensional characters, creating emotional arcs, and establishing immersive settings tied to the story's tone and themes.]

Include claim and example in the format specified above.

### **Language Use**  

[Combine insights on the unique aspects of how the user employs descriptive language, pacing, dialogue, rhetorical devices, figures of speech, tone, and narrative perspective to create an engaging and immersive narrative. Important: Favor examples that are verbatim from the story text.]

Include claim and example in the format specified above.
