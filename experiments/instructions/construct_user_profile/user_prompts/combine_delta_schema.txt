#### Instructions  

1. **Analyze the Provided Sheets**  
   - Use the `<thinking></thinking>` tokens to analyze the provided user writing sheets systematically.  
   - Reflect on recurring patterns, unique elements, and stylistic tendencies described in both the writing sheets for each category (Plot, Creativity, Development, and Language Use).
   - Plan on synthesizing this above information into **Combined User Writing Sheet** as a list of claims for every category above.
   - For every category, group same/ similar claims from the **Previous Combined User Writing Sheet** and the **Current User Writing Sheet** into a single claim in the combined writing sheet. For claims in the **Current User Writing Sheet** that are not grouped with claims in the **Previous Combined User Writing Sheet**, plan on including them as-is with the current story reference in the combined writing sheet. 

2. **Generate the Combined User Writing Sheet**  
   - After completing the analysis, output a **Combined User Writing Sheet** under the `<combined_user_sheet></combined_user_sheet>` tag.  
   - Synthesize insights for each category into concise yet comprehensive claims. Each claim must be an independent statement about the user's story writing style, derived from the **Previous Combined User Writing Sheet** and the **Current User Writing Sheet**. The blend must be cohesive and must not include separate sentences stating, "in the current story..." or explicitly reference the current story as distinct from the overall analysis.
   - Each claim must include a single representative example followed by their respective reference to the story identifiers used to construct the example. Reference should be provided at the end of every example in the form of a square-bracketts `[k]` where `k` denotes the story identifier. 
   - If a claim is taken from the **Previous Combined User Writing Sheet** and edited, choose between the example in the previous sheet and the current sheet that better supports the claim. Do not be biased towards including the example in the current sheet instead choose the example which better supports the claim. 
   - If the claim is newly introduced based on the **Current User Writing Sheet**, just copy paste the claim from the **Current User Writing Sheet** into the combined writing sheet along with the example verbatim by adding the story reference at the end.
   - Do not include references just once for the entire category but ensure each example in each claim within the category has its own reference.

#### Input Format
