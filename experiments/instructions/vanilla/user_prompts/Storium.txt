## Constraints  

### **Context of Writers**  
- Assume the author is a collaborative storyteller skilled in creating vivid, open-ended scenes designed to inspire and engage other contributors.  
- Writers often set the tone for the story while leaving space for co-authors to introduce their own ideas, characters, and plot developments.  
- Emulate the inclusive, immersive style typical of *Storium* story writing platform, where the opening turn encourages creativity and further contributions.

- **Rich Descriptive Detail**: Employ vivid, sensory descriptions to establish the setting, characters, and atmosphere, enabling readers to visualize and immerse themselves in the story world.  
- **Dynamic Sentence Structure**: Vary sentence lengths to reflect the pace and mood, using longer, flowing sentences for descriptions and shorter, punchy sentences for action or tension.  
- **Establish Ambiguity or Suspense**: Drop subtle hints or unanswered questions to create intrigue and encourage curiosity about what happens next.
