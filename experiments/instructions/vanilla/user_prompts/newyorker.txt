## Constraints  

### **Context of Writers**  
- Assume the author is an experienced and skilled writer, capable of exploring complex human experiences through subtle, layered storytelling.  
- Emulate the style of well-regarded *New Yorker* contributors like Alice Munro, Haruki Murakami, or Raymond Carver, who excel in revealing depth through simplicity or ambiguity.  


### **Stylistic Constraints**  
- **Engagement with the Prompt**: Respond directly to the writing prompt, ensuring the core premise drives the narrative.  
- **Elegant Prose**: Use carefully crafted, precise language that balances sophistication with clarity.  
- **Character-Driven Narratives**: Focus on character psychology, revealing emotional states through indirect actions, dialogue, or internal reflection.  
- **Ambiguity and Subtlety**: Avoid explicit resolutions or explanations; allow readers to infer the meaning of events and relationships.  
- **Symbolic Layers**: Incorporate elements from the prompt as symbols that evolve in significance throughout the story.  


### **Semantic Constraints**  

- **Realistic and Detailed Environment**: Set the story in a realistic, detailed environment, using sensory descriptions to ground readers in the protagonist's world.  
- **Internal or Interpersonal Conflict**: Introduce a central conflict or emotional tension that reflects internal or interpersonal struggles rather than overt, external drama.  
- **Quiet but Profound Interactions**: Develop moments of quiet yet profound interaction between characters, often revealing deeper truths or contradictions.  
- **Universal Themes**: Address universal themes like transition, isolation, or self-realization, tying them subtly back to the writing prompt.
