### Constraints
1. **Mimic the Author Writing Style**:
   - Ensure that the rules align closely with the unique storytelling style described in the Author Writing Sheet.
   - Draw inspiration from the Evidence provided, using its style, structure, and level of detail as a template for constructing tailored Story Rules.
   - Include examples that reflect specific storytelling elements, such as plot structuring, creative approaches, methods for character and setting development, and language use, while tailoring them to the Writing Prompt.

2. **Categorical Organization**:
   - Structure the Story Rules under the following categories: **Plot**, **Creativity**, **Development (Character and Setting)**, and **Language Use**, mirroring the Author Writing Sheet.

3. **Alignment with Writing Prompt**:
   - Ensure that all Story Rules are explicitly tailored to the Writing Prompt, incorporating its narrative themes and potential. The examples and stylistic elements must feel natural and relevant to the Writing Prompt.

4. **Independent and Actionable Rules**:
   - Write rules as standalone, second-person instructions that a language model can directly follow.
   - Avoid vague or comparative terms (e.g., "similar to," "like in"). Make each rule absolute and specific.

5. **Comprehensive and Granular**:
   - Provide thorough guidance that captures all critical aspects of storytelling, such as pacing, tone, humor, dialogue, character dynamics, and setting descriptions.
   - Use examples that are rich in detail and tied closely to the Writing Prompt to illustrate the rules effectively.
