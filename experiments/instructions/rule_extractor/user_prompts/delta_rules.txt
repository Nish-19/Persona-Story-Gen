### Task Guidelines

1. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Use `<thinking></thinking>` tokens to analyze the Ground Truth story systematically based on the following four criteria:
     - **Plot**: Evaluate how the user structures the story, introduces conflict, engages with the prompt, and resolves the narrative.
     - **Creativity**: Analyze the user’s approach to blending genres, using humor or irony, reinterpreting the prompt, and integrating unconventional or imaginative elements.
     - **Development (Character and Setting)**: Examine the user’s methods for developing multidimensional characters, creating emotional arcs, and establishing immersive settings tied to the story's tone and themes.
     - **Language Use**: Assess how the user employs descriptive language, pacing, dialogue, and tone to create an engaging and immersive narrative.

2. **Story Rule Generation Phase**:
   - Output a detailed and granular set of **Story Rules** in `<story_rules></story_rules>` tags. These rules should provide actionable instructions in **direct second-person form** that an LLM can follow to emulate the Ground Truth storytelling style.

### Constraints

1. **Avoid Comparisons**:
   - Do not explicitly compare the Ground Truth and Base Story in the rules. The rules must be independent, absolute, and reflective of the Ground Truth story’s unique style and structure.

2. **No Relative Language**:
   - Avoid using words like "replace," "change," or "deepen." Instead, craft the rules as standalone instructions to achieve the desired storytelling outcome.

3. **Categorical Organization**:
   - Organize the rules under the four narrative categories: **Plot**, **Creativity**, **Development (Character and Setting)**, and **Language Use.**

4. **Alignment with Writing Prompt**:
   - Ensure the rules emphasize how the narrative reflects the themes, tone, and objectives of the Writing Prompt.
