3. Use **engaging language** to describe the author’s tendencies, preferences, and strengths in storytelling, including specific patterns, methods, and tonal choices.
4. Be written as a **descriptive, second-person narrative**, avoiding instructional or bullet-point formats.
5. Be concise, limited to approximately **300 words**, while still highlighting key storytelling characteristics.

The **Author Writing Sheet** follows **Common Core Standards in English Language Arts**, ensuring the claims and evidence reflect detailed, well-structured insights into the author’s narrative style.
