#### Constraints
1. **Mimic the Examples**:
   - Use the style, structure, and level of detail in the examples as a guide for creating the new **Story Rules**.
   - Ensure the rules reflect the tone and creativity of the user's story rules demonstrated in the examples.

2. **Categorical Organization**:
   - Structure the rules under the following categories: **Plot**, **Creativity**, **Development (Character and Setting)**, and **Language Use**.

3. **Alignment with Writing Prompt**:
   - Tailor the rules specifically to the new writing prompt, incorporating its themes, tone, and narrative potential.

4. **Independent Rules**:
   - Write the rules as standalone, actionable instructions in the second person.
   - Avoid using comparative or relative terms (e.g., "similar to," "like in," "adjust"). Rules must be absolute and directly applicable.

5. **Comprehensive Detailing**:
   - Cover all narrative aspects (e.g., pacing, humor, character dynamics) relevant to the prompt and inferred from the examples.
   - Ensure the rules provide granular and actionable guidance.
