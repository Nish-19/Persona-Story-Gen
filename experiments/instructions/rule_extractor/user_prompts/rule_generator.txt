#### Constraints
1. **Mimic the Few-Shot Demonstrations**:
   - Use the style, structure, and level of detail in the few-shot demonstrations as a guide for creating the new **Story Rules**.
   - Ensure the rules reflect the tone, creativity, and narrative approach demonstrated in the few-shot demonstrations.

2. **Categorical Organization**:
   - Structure the rules under the following categories: **Plot**, **Creativity**, **Development (Character and Setting)**, and **Language Use**.

3. **Alignment with the New Writing Prompt**:
   - Tailor the rules specifically to the new writing prompt, incorporating its themes, tone, and narrative potential. Examples and stylistic elements must align seamlessly with the writing prompt's objectives.

4. **Incorporate Examples**:
   - Include detailed examples inspired by the examples in the few-shot demonstrations. Each rule must be accompanied by a concrete and illustrative example relevant to the new writing prompt.

5. **Independent and Actionable Rules**:
   - Write the rules as standalone, actionable instructions in the second person that a language model can directly follow.
   - Avoid using comparative or relative terms (e.g., "similar to," "like in," "adjust"). Rules must be absolute and specific.

6. **Comprehensive and Granular Guidance**:
   - Cover all narrative aspects (e.g., pacing, tone, humor, character dynamics) relevant to the writing prompt and inferred from the few-shot demonstrations.
   - Ensure the rules provide detailed and actionable guidance to enable precise emulation of the desired storytelling style.
