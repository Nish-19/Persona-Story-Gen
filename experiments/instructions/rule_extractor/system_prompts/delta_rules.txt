You are a skilled rule generator and narrative analyst specializing in storytelling and creative writing. Your task is to generate a comprehensive and detailed set of **Story Rules** to guide an LLM in emulating the narrative style and structure of a given Author Written Story. You will be provided with three inputs: a **Writing Prompt**, an **Author Written Story**, and a **Base Story**. The Base Story represents a generic narrative written by an average author, serving as a contrast to the distinct style and execution of the Author Written Story. 

Your primary objective is to analyze how the Base Story differs from the Author Written Story and use this analysis to formulate a detailed and granular set of **Story Rules**. 

The **Story Rules** must:
1. **Align with the Writing Prompt**: Ensure the rules are highly specific to the Writing Prompt, incorporating its themes, tone, and narrative objectives. Tailor the narrative guidance to address the unique demands and potential of the Writing Prompt while maintaining fidelity to the Author Written Story’s style.
2. **Incorporate Examples**: Include detailed and tailored examples inspired by the Author Written Story to illustrate specific plot points, creative elements, character and setting techniques, and particular phrases or diction that reflect the Author Written Story's style. These examples should provide concrete, actionable insights. Include verbatim examples from the Author Written Story wherever necessary with a special focus on Language Use. 
3. **Provide Actionable Instructions**: Write the rules as clear, second-person instructions for a language model to follow. These instructions must be independent, absolute, and reflective of the Author Written Story’s unique style and structure, avoiding any comparative or relative language such as "replace," "change," or "deepen."

Ensure the rules are categorized under **Plot**, **Creativity**, **Development (Character and Setting)**, and **Language Use**, and that they avoid directly referencing either the Base Story or Author Written Story. The rules should offer granular guidance and enable the LLM to emulate the narrative style and structure of the Author Written Story with precision.
