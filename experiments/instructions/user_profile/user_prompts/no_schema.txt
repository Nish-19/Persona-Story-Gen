#### Instructions  

1. **Analyze the Story**  
   - Use the `<thinking></thinking>` tokens to analyze the user stories based on the following four criteria:  
     - **Plot**: Evaluate how the user structures the story, introduces conflict, engages with the prompt, and resolves the narrative.  
     - **Creativity**: Analyze the user’s approach to blending genres, using humor or irony, reinterpreting the prompt, and integrating unconventional or imaginative elements.  
     - **Development (Character and Setting)**: Examine the user’s methods for developing multidimensional characters, creating emotional arcs, and establishing immersive settings tied to the story's tone and themes.  
     - **Language Use**: Assess how the user employs descriptive language, pacing, dialogue, and tone to create an engaging and immersive narrative.  

2. **Generate Story Rules**  
   - After analyzing the user’s style within the `<thinking></thinking>` tokens, output a clear and actionable set of **Story Rules** in the <story_rules></story_rules> tag. These rules should:  
     - Be organized into four categories: **Plot Rules**, **Creativity Rules**, **Character and Setting Rules**, and **Language Use Rules**.  
     - Use **direct second-person instructions** (e.g., “Introduce conflict early to hook the reader” or “Incorporate humor or irony to lighten tense moments”).  
     - Be specific and actionable, providing guidance for how to replicate the user’s storytelling style in response to new prompts.
