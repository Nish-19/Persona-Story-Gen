    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story introduces a complex emotional conflict that is deeply personal and tied to the protagonist's identity. The narrative unfolds through a tense and intimate conversation between the protagonist and his parents, revealing a shocking truth about his past. The story is structured around this revelation, with a focus on the emotional impact and the protagonist's internal struggle. The resolution is open-ended, allowing for future exploration of the protagonist's identity and relationship with his parents. In contrast, the Base Story follows a more straightforward plot, with a focus on the external mystery of the protagonist's disappearance and a resolution that emphasizes acceptance and moving forward.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively reinterprets the prompt by focusing on the emotional and ethical complexities of the situation. It explores themes of love, identity, and morality, presenting a nuanced portrayal of the parents' decision to keep the truth hidden.

The protagonist, Peter, is portrayed as a thoughtful and conflicted teenager, grappling with feelings of betrayal and love.

The Base Story features less developed characters, with a focus on the protagonist's confusion and the mother's supportive role. The setting is more generic, serving as a backdrop to the unfolding mystery.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story employs a conversational and emotionally charged tone, using dialogue to convey the characters' inner turmoil and the gravity of the situation. The language is vivid and descriptive, with a focus on sensory details and emotional cues. The story uses rhetorical devices such as repetition and rhetorical questions to heighten the tension and emotional impact. The Base Story uses a more neutral and descriptive tone, with straightforward dialogue and less emphasis on emotional depth. The language is clear and concise, focusing on the narrative progression rather than the characters' internal experiences.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with an immediate sense of tension and mystery, using a personal and intimate setting to draw the reader into the protagonist's world.

    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story diverges from the Base Story by focusing on a comedic and satirical approach to the prompt. The plot is structured around a humorous misunderstanding and the incompetence of the protagonist, Atover the Affordable, who is tasked with training a child, Simponia, in martial arts. The conflict arises from Atover's ineptitude and the mother's dissatisfaction with the results, leading to a comedic resolution where Atover continues his dubious training methods.

    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story introduces a unique tradition called \"Corrections\" where the deceased, David, humorously addresses inaccuracies and lies from his life during his funeral. This approach is more structured and ritualistic compared to the Base Story, where Marcus spontaneously appears to correct misconceptions. The Author Written Story uses a formalized setting with a clear sequence: introduction, addressing inaccuracies, and then lies, culminating in a personal decision not to reveal a painful truth. This structured approach contrasts with the Base Story's more fluid and conversational style.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively incorporates humor and a sense of tradition into the ghost's appearance, making the \"Corrections\" a known and expected part of the funeral. This adds a layer of cultural depth and humor, as seen in the recurring joke about ghosts not being able to hold pens. The Base Story, while also humorous, focuses more on the emotional and philosophical aspects of Marcus's corrections, lacking the ritualistic and comedic elements present in the Author Written Story.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story develops characters through their interactions with David during the Corrections. David's relationships with his family and friends are revealed through his humorous and candid remarks, providing insight into his character and those around him.

Begin with an introduction, proceed to address inaccuracies, and then move on to lies, ending with a personal decision that reflects the character's values.\n  - Use humor and candidness to reveal truths, ensuring the ghost's corrections are both entertaining and insightful. For example, have the ghost humorously correct a misconception about their generosity or a personal anecdote, such as, \"Tom, you said that I would have wanted the proceeds from our GoFundMe to go to charity. Nu-uh. Give it all to Jessica, she\u2019s still paying off her student loans at forty-four!\"\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Incorporate a unique cultural tradition into the story, such as the \"Corrections,\" to add depth and humor.
