    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story diverges significantly from the Base Story in its plot structure and execution. The Author Written Story begins in medias res, with the protagonist already in a tense and mysterious situation, surrounded by unknown entities. The narrative is driven by immediate action and conflict, with the protagonist actively engaging in a struggle for survival and dominance. The plot is non-linear and chaotic, reflecting the protagonist's mental state and the surreal environment. In contrast, the Base Story follows a more traditional narrative arc, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. It focuses on a trial-like scenario where the protagonist, Elysia, must prove her worth to the council through introspection and a journey back to the void to create a new universe.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story exhibits a high degree of creativity through its unconventional approach to the prompt. It blends elements of psychological thriller and surrealism, creating a disorienting and intense atmosphere. The protagonist's actions are unpredictable and violent, using their own body as a weapon, which adds a layer of grotesque creativity. The story's setting and characters are abstract and otherworldly, with creatures of various shapes and colors. The Base Story, on the other hand, adheres more closely to a science fiction and fantasy genre, with a focus on cosmic themes and the rebirth of a universe. It is more introspective and philosophical, exploring themes of creation and responsibility.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: In the Author Written Story, the protagonist is developed through their actions and internal monologue, revealing a complex and possibly unstable personality. The setting is minimalistic and abstract, with a focus on the protagonist's immediate surroundings and the creatures they encounter. The story creates an immersive experience through the protagonist's sensory perceptions and reactions. The Base Story provides more detailed descriptions of the setting, with a vast chamber and ethereal council members. The protagonist, Elysia, is developed through dialogue and introspection, with a focus on her emotional journey and determination to prove herself.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story employs a fragmented and repetitive narrative style, reflecting the protagonist's chaotic thoughts and the disorienting environment. The language is visceral and sensory, with vivid descriptions of pain and violence. Dialogue is sparse and often cryptic, adding to the story's mysterious tone. The Base Story uses more formal and structured language, with clear and descriptive prose. Dialogue is used to convey information and develop the plot, with a focus on philosophical themes and the protagonist's internal conflict. The tone is contemplative and serious, contrasting with the frenetic energy of the Author Written Story.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story in medias res, placing the protagonist in an immediate and tense situation without prior exposition.

It begins with a scene that immediately establishes the protagonist's internal conflict and skepticism about the \"star-chosen\" leader. The narrative unfolds through a series of interactions that reveal the leader's incompetence and the protagonist's growing disillusionment. The story builds tension through the protagonist's internal struggle and the leader's public announcements, culminating in a personal crisis of faith.

The narrative is filled with tension and humor, as the protagonist's honesty becomes a weapon rather than a weakness.
