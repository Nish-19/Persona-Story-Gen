The setting is a bustling city, with streetlamps and nighttime encounters creating a moody, atmospheric backdrop.\n\n4. **Language Use**:\n   - The Author Written Story employs a conversational and informal tone, with the protagonist narrating in the first person. The use of humor and casual language (\"blood-prostitute,\" \"get the garlic\") adds a lighthearted touch to the otherwise dark subject matter.
