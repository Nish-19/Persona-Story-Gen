    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a structured, tiered experience through the fictional service \"SurroLife,\" which offers users the ability to live out their wildest fantasies without consequences. This is a stark contrast to the Base Story, which follows a more traditional narrative arc of a single night out. The Author Written Story uses a detailed, almost brochure-like format to introduce the concept, explain the mechanics, and entice the reader with escalating levels of engagement and risk. The plot is less about a single character's journey and more about the possibilities offered by the service, creating a sense of limitless potential and danger.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively reimagines the prompt by introducing a futuristic, technology-driven service that allows users to experience life through surrogate bodies. This approach blends elements of science fiction with the thrill of escapism, offering a unique take on the idea of a \"wild night out.\" The story's creativity lies in its detailed world-building and the exploration of moral and ethical implications, which are absent in the Base Story's straightforward adventure.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story focuses less on individual character development and more on the immersive setting of SurroLife. The setting is richly detailed, with descriptions of the different membership tiers and the experiences they offer. This creates a vivid picture of a world where technology has removed traditional boundaries, allowing for a deeper exploration of the prompt's themes. In contrast, the Base Story develops its protagonist, Jamie, through her interactions and experiences during a single night.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story employs a formal, persuasive tone reminiscent of marketing material, using direct address to engage the reader. The language is precise and technical, reflecting the advanced technology and the structured nature of the service. This contrasts with the Base Story's more casual, narrative-driven style, which uses dialogue and descriptive language to create an intimate, personal experience. The Author Written Story's use of rhetorical questions and imperative sentences (\"Are You Ready?\", \"Join SurroLife today\") serves to draw the reader into the world and encourage participation.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative around a fictional service that offers a tiered experience, allowing users to explore their wildest fantasies without consequences.
