    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a more direct and personal narrative, focusing on the protagonist's internal conflict and decision to resign from his role as a soldier. The story is structured around a pivotal meeting with General Lewis, where the protagonist, Ed, expresses his desire to change his career path to become a therapist. This is a stark contrast to the Base Story, where the protagonist, Alex, discovers a passion for music and gradually shifts his focus. The Author Written Story uses a single, decisive moment to drive the plot, while the Base Story unfolds over a longer period, with Alex's passion developing gradually.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively reinterprets the prompt by focusing on the protagonist's desire to heal others emotionally, rather than through violence. This is a unique twist on the idea of a genetically enhanced soldier, as it emphasizes emotional intelligence and empathy. The Base Story, on the other hand, explores creativity through music, which is a more conventional and less surprising choice. The Author Written Story's creativity lies in its unexpected career choice and the protagonist's reasoning behind it.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story develops its characters through dialogue and interactions, particularly between Ed and General Lewis. The setting is primarily the military base, which is depicted as a restrictive environment that Ed wishes to escape. The Base Story, however, uses more descriptive language to establish the setting and Alex's internal world, with the Academy and the woods serving as contrasting environments. The Author Written Story focuses more on character interactions and less on detailed setting descriptions.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story employs a conversational and direct tone, with a focus on dialogue and internal monologue. The language is straightforward, with occasional use of military jargon and informal expressions, such as \"facepalm\" and \"fucking... 5 minutes man.\" This creates an engaging and relatable narrative voice. The Base Story, in contrast, uses more descriptive and poetic language, with a focus on imagery and introspection. The Author Written Story's language is more immediate and action-oriented, reflecting the protagonist's decisive nature.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative around a pivotal moment where the protagonist makes a decisive choice to change their career path.
