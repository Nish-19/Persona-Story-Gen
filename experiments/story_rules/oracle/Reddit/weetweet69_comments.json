    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a narrative where the supposed hero is revealed to be far more ruthless and destructive than the villain. The plot is structured around a confrontation between Ravos, a self-proclaimed Dark Lord, and a mysterious wanderer who is perceived as a hero. The story begins with Ravos's backstory, establishing his fearsome reputation and the extent of his conquests. The narrative then shifts to the present, where Ravos is at the mercy of the wanderer. The wanderer's actions reveal a darker nature, culminating in the brutal execution of Ravos and the wanderer's intention to continue his destructive path. This plot structure emphasizes the theme of moral ambiguity and the subversion of traditional hero-villain roles.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively subverts the typical hero-villain dynamic by portraying the hero as a figure driven by bloodlust and a desire for destruction, rather than noble intentions. The wanderer is depicted as a force of nature, leading an army of destruction, which contrasts with the typical portrayal of heroes as saviors. The story also incorporates elements of dark fantasy, with references to demonic parentage and infernal homelands, adding depth and complexity to the narrative.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: Characters are developed through their actions and reputations. Ravos is introduced with a detailed backstory that establishes his power and fearsome nature. The wanderer, on the other hand, is shrouded in mystery, with their true nature revealed through their ruthless actions. The setting is vividly described, with references to kingdoms, infernal homelands, and the wanderer's foreign origins, creating an immersive world that enhances the story's dark tone.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story employs a formal and descriptive language style, with a focus on creating a dark and foreboding atmosphere. The use of titles and epithets, such as \"Dark Lord\" and \"Conqueror,\" adds to the grandeur and menace of the characters. The narrative includes vivid imagery, such as the \"sea of blades and of magic,\" to convey the scale and intensity of the conflict. Dialogue is minimal but impactful, highlighting the power dynamics between the characters. The story's pacing is deliberate, building tension through detailed descriptions and the gradual revelation of the wanderer's true nature.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story by establishing the villain's reputation and past conquests, using titles and epithets to convey their fearsome nature.
