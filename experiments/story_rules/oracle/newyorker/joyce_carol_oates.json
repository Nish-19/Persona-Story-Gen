    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a deeply introspective and emotional narrative that focuses on the internal experience of the protagonist as they come to terms with the concept of hospice. The plot is structured around the gradual acceptance of the situation, moving from denial to a form of acceptance and resolution. The story uses a non-linear approach, with reflections and vows interspersed with the present narrative, creating a layered understanding of the protagonist's emotional journey. In contrast, the Base Story follows a more linear progression, focusing on external actions and interactions between characters as they navigate the hospice experience.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story employs a highly metaphorical and symbolic approach to the prompt, using vivid imagery and abstract concepts to convey the emotional weight of the situation. The narrative transforms the idea of hospice into a personal vow to create a \"honeymoon\" experience, blending the themes of love, memory, and finality in a unique way. The Base Story, while touching on similar themes, remains more grounded in realistic depictions of the hospice experience, focusing on tangible actions and settings.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story delves deeply into the protagonist's internal world, exploring their thoughts, fears, and hopes with rich detail. The setting is used symbolically, with the home and its elements representing comfort and familiarity. Characters are developed through their internal monologues and emotional responses rather than through dialogue or external descriptions. The Base Story, on the other hand, develops characters through their interactions and dialogue, with the setting serving as a backdrop to the unfolding events.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story is characterized by its poetic and evocative language, using a stream-of-consciousness style to immerse the reader in the protagonist's emotional state. The narrative employs rhetorical devices such as repetition, metaphor, and imagery to create a haunting and reflective tone. The Base Story uses more straightforward language, focusing on clear and descriptive prose to convey the narrative. Dialogue in the Author Written Story is sparse and often indirect, while the Base Story uses dialogue to advance the plot and develop character relationships.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with the utterance of the word \"hospice,\" creating an immediate and profound shift in the narrative atmosphere.
