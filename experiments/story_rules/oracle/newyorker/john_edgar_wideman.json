    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a non-linear, introspective narrative that grapples with the concept of memory and its impact on the present. It does not follow a traditional plot structure with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Instead, it is a meditation on the impossibility of resurrecting the past and the futility of trying to bring the dead back to life through storytelling. The narrative is fragmented, reflecting the chaotic and unresolved nature of grief and memory. In contrast, the Base Story follows a more conventional plot structure, with a clear progression of events and a resolution that emphasizes the healing power of memory.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story employs a highly creative and unconventional approach to the prompt. It uses a stream-of-consciousness style to explore the themes of memory and resistance, blending elements of personal reflection, social commentary, and historical context. The narrative is deeply philosophical, questioning the very nature of storytelling and the role of the writer in preserving memory. The Base Story, while creative in its own right, adheres to a more traditional narrative style, focusing on a personal journey of remembrance and healing.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story does not focus on character development in the traditional sense. Instead, it presents a deeply personal and introspective voice that serves as both the narrator and the protagonist. The setting is abstract and symbolic, representing the internal landscape of the narrator's mind. The Base Story, on the other hand, develops its characters through their relationships and interactions, set against a tangible and detailed backdrop that enhances the emotional depth of the narrative.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story employs a distinctive and poetic language style, characterized by fragmented sentences, repetition, and rhetorical questions. The tone is reflective and mournful, capturing the complexity of grief and the weight of memory. The narrative voice is intimate and confessional, drawing the reader into the narrator's internal struggle. The Base Story uses a more straightforward and descriptive language style, with a focus on clarity and emotional resonance. The tone is contemplative and hopeful, emphasizing the healing power of memory.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative as a non-linear, introspective meditation on memory and its impact on the present.
