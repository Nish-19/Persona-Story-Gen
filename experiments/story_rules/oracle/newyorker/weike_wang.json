    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a unique structure by embedding a children's story within the narrative, which serves as a reflection of the protagonist's relationship with his mother. The plot is non-linear, with the children's story interwoven with the protagonist's real-life interactions with his mother. The conflict arises from the mother's critique and demand for a happy ending, which the protagonist struggles to deliver. The resolution is ambiguous, leaving the reader to ponder the protagonist's ability to meet his mother's expectations. In contrast, the Base Story follows a more traditional linear plot, with a clear beginning, middle, and end, culminating in a satisfying resolution where the protagonist successfully writes a story that pleases his mother.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively uses the children's story as a metaphor for the protagonist's relationship with his mother and his struggle with her expectations. The story within a story is unconventional, with a clown teaching lessons about probabilities, which ties back to the mother's background in mathematics. This adds a layer of depth and complexity, as the children's story is not just a simple tale but a reflection of the protagonist's life and his mother's influence. The Base Story, while imaginative, adheres to more conventional storytelling techniques, focusing on a straightforward narrative about a writer crafting a children's story.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story develops its characters through their interactions and the embedded children's story. The protagonist's relationship with his mother is explored through dialogue and the metaphorical children's story, which reflects their past and present dynamics. The setting is minimal, focusing on the mother's facility and the abstract village in the children's story. The Base Story provides more detailed character development, with the protagonist's internal struggle and growth depicted through his writing process and interactions with his mother. The setting is more vividly described, with the study and the mother's room serving as key locations.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story employs a distinctive style, using precise and sometimes technical language, particularly in the children's story. The tone is reflective and somewhat melancholic, with a focus on the protagonist's internal conflict and his mother's critical perspective. The narrative perspective is third-person, providing insight into the protagonist's thoughts and feelings. The Base Story uses a more straightforward and descriptive language, with a warm and hopeful tone. The dialogue is more frequent and serves to advance the plot and character development. The narrative perspective is also third-person but focuses more on the protagonist's external actions and interactions.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative by embedding a children's story within the main story.
