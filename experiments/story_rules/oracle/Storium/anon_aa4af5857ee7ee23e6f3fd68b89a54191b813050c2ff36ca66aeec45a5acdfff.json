    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a fragmented narrative structure, with each character introduced in separate vignettes that highlight their unique circumstances and the moment they are pulled into the labyrinth. This approach contrasts with the Base Story's more linear and cohesive plot, where characters are introduced in a shared setting and quickly begin interacting. The Author Written Story uses a non-linear, episodic format to create intrigue and mystery, leaving the reader to piece together the connections between characters and their environments. The resolution is not explicitly provided, maintaining an open-ended and enigmatic tone, unlike the Base Story, which concludes with a clear resolution and explanation of the labyrinth's purpose.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story employs a highly imaginative and surreal approach, blending elements of science fiction, fantasy, and psychological horror. Each character's entry into the labyrinth is marked by a distinct and disorienting experience, such as Meredith's uncanny simulation or Monika's warped audio recording. This creative use of genre elements creates a sense of unpredictability and otherworldliness. In contrast, the Base Story follows a more traditional fantasy adventure structure, with a clear quest and defined magical elements.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: Characters in the Author Written Story are introduced through their internal experiences and immediate reactions to their new environments, providing a deep sense of their personalities and backgrounds. The settings are richly described but remain ambiguous, enhancing the sense of mystery and dislocation. The Base Story, however, provides more direct interactions between characters and a clearer depiction of the labyrinth's setting, focusing on the collaborative aspect of their journey.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story uses a poetic and fragmented style, with a focus on sensory details and internal monologue. The language is often abstract and metaphorical, creating a dreamlike quality. Phrases like \"the total lack of white ship noise\" and \"a young blaze just beginning to find its feet\" exemplify this style. The Base Story employs a more straightforward narrative style, with clear dialogue and descriptive passages that guide the reader through the plot.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative in a series of vignettes, each focusing on a different character's unique experience as they are drawn into the labyrinth. Begin each vignette with a distinct sensory or emotional detail that sets the tone for the character's perspective.\n  - Maintain an open-ended conclusion that leaves the mystery of the labyrinth unresolved. Allow the reader to infer connections and meanings without providing explicit explanations or resolutions.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Incorporate elements of surrealism and genre-blending, using unexpected and disorienting experiences to draw characters into the labyrinth. For example, describe a character experiencing a warped audio recording or a simulation-like environment.\n  - Use imaginative and unconventional settings that defy logical explanation, such as a library with shelves nestled amid foliage or a gallery of paintings that seem to depict alternate realities.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Introduce characters through their internal monologues and immediate reactions to their environments, providing insight into their personalities and backgrounds. Use sensory details to convey their emotional states and perceptions.\n  - Create settings that are richly detailed yet ambiguous, enhancing the sense of mystery and dislocation. Describe environments that blend elements of the familiar and the fantastical, such as a cemetery with a greenish luminescence or a bookstore with endless aisles.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a poetic and fragmented style, using abstract and metaphorical language to create a dreamlike quality. Focus on sensory details and internal monologue to convey the characters' experiences.\n  - Use phrases that evoke a strong sense of atmosphere and emotion, such as \"the total lack of white ship noise\" or \"a young blaze just beginning to find its feet.\" Allow the language to reflect the characters' disorientation and the surreal nature of the labyrinth.\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story begins with a hypothetical scenario that immediately immerses the reader in a post-apocalyptic world. It uses a reflective and speculative tone to set the stage, asking the reader to consider their actions in a world devoid of human life. The narrative then shifts to a detailed recounting of the alien invasion, focusing on the gradual escalation of events leading to humanity's downfall. The story is structured in acts, with a clear progression from initial disbelief to inevitable capitulation and the formation of the ADVENT Coalition. The plot emphasizes the inevitability of the alien victory and the subsequent loss of freedom, contrasting with the Base Story's more immediate focus on a specific resistance plan.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively blends speculative fiction with a historical recounting style, using a hypothetical scenario to engage the reader's imagination. It incorporates elements of conspiracy and secrecy, such as the existence of XCOM and the covert operations of the aliens, to build a sense of intrigue and tension. The narrative explores the psychological impact of the invasion, highlighting humanity's initial denial and eventual acceptance of the alien presence. This contrasts with the Base Story's straightforward depiction of a resistance effort, which lacks the same depth of world-building and thematic exploration.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story focuses more on the broader societal impact of the alien invasion rather than individual character development. It paints a vivid picture of a world transformed by alien influence, with detailed descriptions of the political and social changes brought about by the ADVENT Coalition. The setting is expansive, encompassing multiple countries and the global response to the alien threat. In contrast, the Base Story centers on a small group of resistance fighters, providing more intimate character development and a localized setting.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story employs a formal and reflective tone, using rhetorical questions and hypothetical scenarios to engage the reader. The language is descriptive and evocative, with a focus on the emotional and psychological aspects of the invasion. The narrative uses a mix of past and present tense to create a sense of immediacy and historical reflection. In contrast, the Base Story uses a more straightforward and action-oriented style, with dialogue and direct descriptions to convey the plot and character motivations.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin with a hypothetical scenario that invites the reader to imagine themselves in a post-apocalyptic world.

    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story employs a fragmented, multi-perspective narrative structure, weaving together various character arcs and subplots to create a tapestry of life under alien rule. The story is set in a city where the surface appearance of peace and order masks underlying tensions and secrets. The plot unfolds through a series of vignettes, each focusing on different characters and their interactions with the alien regime. This approach contrasts with the Base Story's more linear and focused narrative, which centers on a single protagonist's journey from realization to resistance. The Author Written Story's plot is more decentralized, with multiple characters contributing to the overarching theme of uncovering hidden truths and resisting control.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively integrates elements of science fiction and social commentary, using the setting of a city under alien rule to explore themes of control, belief, and resistance. The narrative is rich with symbolic elements, such as the repurposing of a chapel and the development of a mysterious implant, which serve as metaphors for the broader societal changes and conflicts. The story's creativity lies in its ability to blend these elements seamlessly into the narrative, creating a world that feels both familiar and alien. This differs from the Base Story, which focuses more on the technological aspects of the alien control and the resistance's efforts to disable it.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story features a diverse cast of characters, each with their own motivations and conflicts. The characters are developed through their interactions with the alien regime and each other, revealing their personal struggles and the impact of the societal changes on their lives. The setting of City 31 is vividly depicted, with attention to both its physical and social landscapes. The story uses the setting to enhance the characters' development, showing how the city's transformation under alien rule affects its inhabitants. This contrasts with the Base Story, which focuses more on the protagonist's internal journey and the resistance's activities.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story employs a descriptive and immersive language style, using vivid imagery and detailed descriptions to bring the setting and characters to life. The narrative voice is reflective and contemplative, often delving into the characters' thoughts and emotions.
