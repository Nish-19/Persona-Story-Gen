    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story begins with Severus Snape unexpectedly encountering an art exhibit dedicated to him, created by Hermione Granger. The plot quickly introduces a shocking revelation: Hermione has a son with Severus, named Septimus Severus. This revelation serves as the central conflict and resolution, as it leads to a reconciliation and potential romantic future between Severus and Hermione. The story is structured around this personal and emotional revelation, focusing on character interactions and dialogue to drive the narrative forward.
