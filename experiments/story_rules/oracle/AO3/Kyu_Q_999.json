    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a more introspective and emotionally complex narrative compared to the Base Story. It focuses on Celebrimbor's internal struggle and his interactions with the Valar, particularly through a dream sequence that blurs the lines between reality and illusion. The plot is structured around Celebrimbor's confrontation with his feelings for Annatar, culminating in a bittersweet acceptance of his emotions rather than a straightforward resolution.
