    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules for the given Writing Prompt, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The prompt involves witnessing a dangerous spell, which suggests themes of curiosity, danger, and possibly ethical considerations. The author's style often involves moral dilemmas, ethical boundaries, and personal relationships, which can be integrated into this narrative. The author also uses modern, relatable elements and vivid sensory language, which will be crucial in crafting an engaging story. I will create Story Rules that incorporate these elements, ensuring they align with the prompt's themes and the author's unique style.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Structure the plot around a moral confrontation involving the dangerous spell. Use dialogue to explore the ethical implications of performing such a spell. For example, have the protagonist confront the spellcaster, questioning the morality of their actions: \"Do you even realize what could happen if this goes wrong? It's not just about you.\"  \n  - Develop the narrative through a familial or close relationship conversation, where the protagonist seeks reassurance or advice about the witnessed spell. This could involve a mentor or a family member who has experience with magic, providing a grounding perspective.  \n  - Integrate a sudden, intense vision or realization that prompts immediate action. For instance, the protagonist might have a vision of the spell going awry, leading them to intervene or warn others.  \n\n- **Creativity**:  \n  - Subvert traditional spellcasting stereotypes by incorporating modern, relatable elements. The spellcaster could be a young, tech-savvy individual using unconventional tools, like a smartphone app, to perform the spell.  \n  - Integrate supernatural elements into a realistic setting, such as a bustling city or a college campus, to explore the everyday challenges of living with magic. This could involve the protagonist navigating a world where magic is both a tool and a threat.  \n  - Explore the darker potential of the prompt by introducing ethical conflicts. The protagonist might grapple with the morality of learning or stopping the spell, questioning whether the ends justify the means.  \n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:  \n  - Develop characters through realistic dialogue that reveals personal values and conflicts. The protagonist's conversation with the spellcaster should highlight their differing views on the use of magic: \"Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.\"  \n  - Use interactions and backstories to add depth to relationships. The protagonist might have a history with the spellcaster, such as being former friends or rivals, which influences their current dynamic.  \n  - Explore characters' internal struggles and emotional depth. The protagonist could internally debate the risks and rewards of intervening, reflecting on past experiences with magic.  \n\n- **Language Use**:  \n  - Use direct and conversational language to create an engaging and contemporary tone. The protagonist's internal monologue and dialogue should feel current and relatable, such as, \"This isn't Hogwarts, and you're not Harry Potter.\"  \n  - Employ vivid, sensory language to convey the intensity of the spell and the protagonist's emotions. Describe the spell's effects with phrases like \"the air crackled with energy\" and \"a chill ran down my spine as I watched.\"  \n  - Use contrasting imagery to emphasize the protagonist's transformation or realization. Contrast the initial awe of witnessing the spell with the sobering reality of its potential consequences, using imagery like \"the dazzling light faded, leaving only the shadow of what could have been.\"  \n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules for the given Writing Prompt, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The goal is to create rules that reflect the author's unique style while aligning with the prompt's themes of an uneasy alliance between humans and vampires in a zombie-ravaged world.\n\n### Plot\nThe author often structures plots around moral confrontations, familial conversations, and sudden visions that drive action. For this prompt, the plot should focus on the moral and ethical dilemmas of the alliance, such as the vampires' need for human blood and the humans' reliance on vampires for protection. The narrative can unfold through dialogues that explore these ethical boundaries and the consequences of the alliance.\n\n### Creativity\nThe author creatively subverts traditional stereotypes and integrates supernatural elements into realistic settings. For this prompt, the story should creatively depict the alliance, perhaps by showing vampires in unexpected roles, such as protectors or strategists, and humans adapting to new societal norms. The narrative can explore the darker potential of the alliance, such as the ethical conflicts arising from the vampires' need for blood.\n\n### Development (Character and Setting)\nThe author develops characters through realistic dialogue, emotional depth, and internal struggles. Characters in this story should be developed through their interactions and the moral dilemmas they face. The setting should reflect a world where humans and vampires coexist out of necessity, with vivid descriptions of the post-apocalyptic environment.\n\n### Language Use\nThe author uses direct, conversational language and vivid sensory descriptions. The story should employ a conversational tone to make the characters relatable, while vivid language should be used to describe the intense emotions and the bleak setting of a zombie-ravaged world.\n\nUsing these insights, I will create detailed Story Rules that guide the language model in crafting a narrative that aligns with both the author's style and the Writing Prompt.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the plot around the moral and ethical dilemmas of the alliance between humans and vampires.

Include internal monologues that reflect on the complexity of the alliance and the characters' personal struggles.\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt \"There is just one problem with your plan. Humans. They will pack bond with anything.
