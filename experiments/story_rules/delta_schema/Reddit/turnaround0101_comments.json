    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Author Writing Sheet and the Writing Prompt, I will focus on the author's unique storytelling style, which emphasizes character development, emotional introspection, and vivid sensory language. The Writing Prompt involves themes of theft, cultural restitution, and irony, which can be explored through the author's introspective and emotionally driven narrative style. I will create rules that guide the language model to develop a plot centered on the protagonist's emotional journey, use creative reinterpretations of the prompt, and employ vivid language to evoke atmosphere and character depth.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative around the emotional and introspective journey of Stanley Oglethorpe as he grapples with the irony of his situation. Focus on his internal conflict and personal growth rather than the external mystery of the theft. For example, depict Stanley reflecting on his past actions and the emptiness he feels without his possessions: \"As he stood in the barren room, the echoes of his own voice seemed to mock him, each syllable a reminder of what he had taken and what had been taken from him.\"\n  - Emphasize emotional connections over action. Illustrate Stanley's interactions with his family and colleagues, highlighting their emotional responses to the theft. Use dialogue to convey the importance of presence and support, such as a family member saying, \"We may have lost things, but we haven't lost each other.\"\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Employ a minimalist approach to fantastical elements, focusing on the emotional realism of Stanley's situation. Introduce the Nigerian exhibit subtly, through a simple news report or conversation, emphasizing Stanley's emotional response over elaborate descriptions of the exhibit.\n  - Reinterpret the prompt by focusing on Stanley's unique perspective and personal aspects. Explore his internal monologue as he contemplates the irony of his situation, drawing parallels between his past actions and the current events.\n  - Integrate literary references to enrich the narrative and provide depth to Stanley's experiences. For instance, reference a classic tale of hubris or downfall to mirror Stanley's journey, such as, \"Like Icarus, he had flown too close to the sun, and now the wax was melting.\"\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop Stanley's character through introspection, memory, and personal struggles. Use his reflections on his past dealings and the impact of the theft to create a multidimensional portrayal. For example, depict him recalling a childhood memory of his first encounter with an artifact, highlighting his initial fascination and subsequent moral decline.\n  - Establish an immersive setting by highlighting detailed and gritty aspects of Stanley's world. Describe the opulence of his home before the theft and the stark contrast afterward, using sensory details like \"the echo of footsteps on marble floors now bare of their Persian rugs.\"\n  - Develop the setting as a reflection of Stanley's internal state, using nature or the environment to mirror his emotional transformation. For instance, describe a stormy night as he contemplates his losses, with \"thunder rumbling like the accusations he feared would soon follow.\"\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use vivid and sensory language to evoke emotional depth and atmosphere. Describe Stanley's sensory experiences as he navigates his empty home, such as \"the cold touch of the doorknob, a reminder of the warmth that once filled these halls.\"\n  - Employ a conversational and introspective tone to convey Stanley's character depth. Use dialogue and internal monologue to reveal his motivations and internal conflict, such as, \"What have I done? he wondered, staring at the empty shelves that once held his ill-gotten gains.\"\n  - Use a reflective and introspective narrative voice to convey Stanley's internal conflict and growth. Highlight his musings on the nature of possession and loss, using a contemplative tone: \"In the end, what is a treasure if it cannot be shared, if it only serves to isolate and condemn?\"\n</story_rules>",

    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Author Writing Sheet and the Writing Prompt, I will focus on the author's unique storytelling style, which emphasizes character development, emotional introspection, and vivid sensory language. The Writing Prompt involves an astronaut on a solo mission who creates an imaginary friend, only to discover an unidentified lifeform upon returning. This scenario offers rich potential for introspection, emotional depth, and creative exploration of the protagonist's psychological state and interactions with both the imaginary friend and the lifeform.
