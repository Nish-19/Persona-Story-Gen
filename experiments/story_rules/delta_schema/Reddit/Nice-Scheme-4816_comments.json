    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Author Writing Sheet and the Writing Prompt, I will focus on the author's unique style of humor, subversion of traditional tropes, dynamic character interactions, and vivid language. The Writing Prompt involves a pre-battle scenario with sidekicks doubting the hero, which offers opportunities for humor, conflict, and creative reinterpretation of typical hero narratives. I will ensure the rules reflect the author's style by incorporating absurdity, blending modern and fantasy elements, and using humorous dialogue and vivid language to create an engaging narrative.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the plot with humor and absurdity, focusing on the sidekicks' humorous and exaggerated doubts about the hero's capabilities. For example, have a sidekick suggest that the hero once mistook a dragon for a large chicken, leading to a comedic retelling of the event.\n  - Subvert traditional hero tropes by having the sidekicks plan a non-traditional intervention, such as organizing a surprise party to boost the hero's morale instead of a coup, highlighting their loyalty and humor.\n  - Develop the plot around a dynamic and ongoing conflict among the sidekicks, such as a debate over whether the hero's outdated tactics are a sign of wisdom or senility, without reaching a clear resolution.\n  - Focus on action and confrontation by including a scene where the sidekicks practice battle strategies, leading to a humorous mishap that reveals their own incompetence, setting up a comedic contrast with the hero's perceived flaws.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Blend modern and fantasy elements by incorporating contemporary technology into the medieval setting, such as a sidekick using a smartphone to livestream their plotting session, adding a layer of absurdity.\n  - Infuse humor with elements of fantasy and supernatural by introducing a magical creature, like a talking squirrel, that offers sarcastic commentary on the sidekicks' plans, providing a comedic twist.\n  - Integrate unexpected twists by revealing that one of the sidekicks is secretly a double agent for the hero, but their loyalty is motivated by a mundane reason, such as the hero's excellent cooking skills.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through humorous dialogue and interactions, such as a sidekick who constantly misquotes famous battle speeches, leading to playful banter among the group.\n  - Highlight dynamic interactions and distinct personalities by showcasing a sidekick who is overly optimistic about the hero's chances, clashing with a more cynical sidekick, creating a lively debate.\n  - Develop the setting as a space of both vulnerability and power by describing the sidekicks' meeting place as a cozy tavern that transforms into a strategic planning hub, emphasizing the dual nature of their mission.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a conversational and humorous tone to create an engaging narrative, using lines like, \"Sure, the hero's got a sword, but can they wield a spatula? That's the real test of a leader.\"\n  - Use sharp, argumentative dialogue to convey the sidekicks' complex feelings about the hero, such as a heated exchange over whether the hero's last victory was due to skill or sheer luck.\n  - Utilize vivid and dynamic language to convey action and emotion, describing the sidekicks' practice session with phrases like, \"The room erupted in chaos as wooden swords clattered, and a rogue shield flew across the tavern, narrowly missing the bartender.\"\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Author Writing Sheet and the given Writing Prompt, I will analyze the author's unique storytelling style across the categories of Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The author is known for incorporating humor and absurdity into their plots, subverting traditional tropes, and focusing on dynamic conflicts. They creatively blend modern and fantasy elements, often using humor to reinterpret prompts in unconventional ways. Characters are developed through humorous dialogue, dynamic interactions, and ideological conflicts, while settings are depicted as spaces of both vulnerability and power. The author's language use is characterized by a conversational and humorous tone, sharp argumentative dialogue, and vivid, dynamic descriptions. I will tailor these elements to the Writing Prompt, which involves a deal with a Fey and the protagonist's nonchalant response to a significant demand. The story should maintain a light-hearted and humorous tone, subvert expectations about deals with supernatural beings, and develop characters and settings that reflect both modern and mythical traits.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the plot with humor and absurdity, focusing on the protagonist's nonchalant attitude towards the Fey's demand. For example, have the protagonist casually discuss logistics with the Fey, such as, \"Do you have a preferred hospital for the delivery, or should I just wing it?\"\n  - Subvert traditional fantasy tropes by portraying the Fey as a bureaucratic figure more interested in paperwork than magic. For instance, include a scene where the Fey pulls out a contract and a pen, asking the protagonist to initial several clauses.\n  - Center the plot around a dynamic and ongoing conflict, such as the protagonist negotiating terms with the Fey, rather than a simple exchange. Introduce humorous complications, like the Fey's misunderstanding of modern parenting concepts.\n  - Focus on action and confrontation by including a scene where the protagonist and the Fey face off against a group of well-meaning but misguided fairy tale enthusiasts who try to \"rescue\" the protagonist from the deal.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Blend modern and fantasy elements by incorporating everyday technology into the Fey's world. For example, the Fey might use a smartphone app to track the protagonist's pregnancy progress.\n  - Use humor to reinterpret the prompt, such as the protagonist joking about setting up a playdate with other supernatural offspring, like a werewolf's cub or a dragon's hatchling.\n  - Integrate unexpected twists by having the Fey reveal that the firstborn is not a child but a creative project or idea, challenging the protagonist's assumptions and leading to a comedic resolution.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through humorous dialogue and interactions. The protagonist should have a witty and laid-back demeanor, while the Fey should be portrayed as both mystical and comically bureaucratic. For example, the Fey might say, \"I assure you, our childcare facilities are top-notch,\" to which the protagonist replies, \"Do they have Wi-Fi?\"\n  - Create dynamic interactions by showing the protagonist and the Fey bonding over shared frustrations with the complexities of magical contracts.\n  - Develop the setting as a space of both vulnerability and power. The protagonist's home could be depicted as a cozy, modern apartment that transforms into a magical negotiation room when the Fey arrives, complete with floating quills and self-filling teacups.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a conversational and humorous tone throughout the narrative. Use light-hearted banter to diffuse the tension of the Fey's demand, such as the protagonist quipping, \"I hope you have a good return policy on firstborns.\"\n  - Use sharp, argumentative dialogue to explore the complexities of the deal. The protagonist might challenge the Fey with questions like, \"What if I have twins? Is there a buy-one-get-one-free clause?\"\n  - Use vivid and dynamic language to convey action and emotion, especially during the negotiation scenes. Describe the Fey's magical aura with phrases like \"a shimmering haze of iridescent light\" and the protagonist's reaction with \"a bemused grin spreading across their face.\"\n</story_rules>",
