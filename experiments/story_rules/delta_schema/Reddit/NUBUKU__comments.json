    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt suggests a dystopian setting where humanity has reverted to natural selection by removing safety features, implying themes of survival, societal critique, and perhaps dark humor. The author's style emphasizes internal conflict, emotional depth, and introspective journeys, often with a central revelation or mystery. The author also uses vivid sensory language and integrates modern twists and personal settings to explore themes. I will incorporate these elements into the Story Rules, ensuring they are actionable and tailored to the prompt.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Structure the narrative around the protagonist's internal conflict with the societal shift towards natural selection. Begin with the protagonist's initial acceptance or indifference, leading to a personal experience that challenges their beliefs. For example, the protagonist might witness a loved one suffer due to the lack of safety features, prompting introspection and a reevaluation of their stance.\n  - Develop the plot around a central revelation that challenges the protagonist's identity or beliefs. This could be a discovery that the removal of safety features is a cover for a deeper, more sinister agenda by those in power, forcing the protagonist to confront their role in this society.\n  - Incorporate a mystery resolved through a tangible explanation, such as uncovering a secret group that sabotages safety features to accelerate natural selection, providing a concrete resolution to the societal chaos.\n\n- **Creativity**:  \n  - Explore the emotional complexities of living in a world without safety features, focusing on the internal experience rather than external dangers. For instance, describe the protagonist's anxiety and heightened awareness as they navigate daily life, knowing that any misstep could be fatal.\n  - Integrate a personal and domestic setting to explore the theme of survival and adaptation. Use the protagonist's home environment to reflect their coping mechanisms, such as removing all sharp objects or padding furniture, highlighting the absurdity and desperation of their situation.\n  - Introduce an unconventional twist by suggesting a scientific or technological explanation for the societal shift, such as a government experiment to study human adaptability and resilience, adding depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:  \n  - Develop the protagonist's character through internal conflict and self-awareness. Use introspective moments where the protagonist questions their own survival instincts and moral compass in a world that values natural selection.\n  - Develop characters through their emotional responses to the societal changes. For example, show a character's fear and determination as they navigate a city without safety features, highlighting their resilience and adaptability.\n  - Reflect the oppressive nature of the new societal norms through the setting. Describe urban environments stripped of safety, with citizens constantly on edge, mirroring the protagonist's internal struggle with the harsh realities of their world.\n\n- **Language Use**:  \n  - Use vivid sensory language to convey the protagonist's emotional state and the tension of living in a world without safety features. For example, describe the protagonist's heightened senses as they walk through a city, feeling every uneven pavement and hearing every distant scream.\n  - Employ dialogue to convey character dynamics and thematic elements. Use conversations between characters to highlight differing perspectives on the societal changes, such as debates on the ethics of natural selection.\n  - Use internal monologue to build tension and convey the protagonist's emotional state. For instance, have the protagonist reflect on their fear and uncertainty, questioning whether they can survive in a world that seems to punish the slightest mistake.\n</story_rules>",
