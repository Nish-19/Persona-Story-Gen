    "<thinking>\nTo create the **Story Rules** for the given Writing Prompt, \"An alien swarm species crashes down on a fantasy world,\" I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The goal is to ensure that the rules align with the author's unique storytelling style as evidenced in their previous works.\n\n1. **Plot**: The author often structures narratives around introspection, long-term consequences, and complex internal and external conflicts. For this prompt, the plot should focus on the introspective journey of a protagonist dealing with the alien swarm's impact on their world, exploring the long-term societal changes and the protagonist's internal conflicts.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The author integrates philosophical themes, speculative technology, and supernatural elements. The narrative should creatively explore the philosophical implications of the alien swarm's arrival, perhaps introducing speculative technology or magic that interacts with the swarm, enhancing the narrative's depth.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The author develops multidimensional characters and immersive settings. The protagonist should be complex, with a psychological and moral journey influenced by the swarm. The setting should reflect the fantasy world's transformation due to the swarm, creating a rich backdrop for the story.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The author employs vivid, reflective, and philosophical language. The narrative should use intense and immersive language to describe the swarm's impact, reflective language for the protagonist's introspection, and philosophical language to explore the narrative's moral dimensions.\n\nWith these insights, I will construct detailed **Story Rules** that guide the narrative generation process for the LLM, ensuring alignment with the author's style and the Writing Prompt.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative around the protagonist's introspection and acceptance of the alien swarm's impact on their world. Use introspective reflections such as, \"I was always going to face change, even if the swarm had not arrived. My path is altered, but my purpose remains.\" \n  - Focus on the long-term consequences of the swarm's arrival, exploring how it reshapes societal structures and beliefs over time. Develop a storyline where the protagonist uncovers ancient prophecies or forgotten histories that hint at the swarm's significance.\n  - Create a layered narrative by intertwining the protagonist's internal conflicts with the external threat of the swarm. Highlight moments where the protagonist grapples with fear and responsibility, akin to preparing for a mission against a formidable opponent.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Integrate philosophical exploration by having characters question the nature of life and coexistence with the swarm. Introduce speculative elements like a \"retro oracle\" that predicts potential futures with the swarm, exploring themes of destiny and choice.\n  - Enhance the narrative's tension by incorporating supernatural elements, such as the swarm possessing mystical abilities that challenge the world's existing magic systems.\n  - Reinterpret the prompt by focusing on themes of exploitation and the potential pitfalls of interacting with the swarm, revealing hidden motives or ancient alliances that complicate the narrative.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as a multidimensional character, exploring their psychological state and moral ambiguity as they navigate the swarm's influence. Show their evolution from fear to understanding, perhaps finding a new purpose in uniting disparate factions against the swarm.\n  - Establish an immersive setting that reflects the fantasy world's transformation due to the swarm. Describe environments where nature and alien elements blend, creating a landscape that mirrors the protagonist's internal journey.\n  - Use the setting as a backdrop for exploring societal evolution, depicting how different cultures adapt or resist the swarm's presence, leading to moral growth or conflict.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ vivid and precise language to create an intense atmosphere, using phrases like \"The sky darkened with the swarm's descent, a shadow over the land\" to depict the swarm's arrival.\n  - Use reflective and contemplative language to convey the protagonist's inner journey, with thoughts such as, \"What does it mean to coexist with the unknown? I seek answers in the ancient texts and the whispers of the wind.\"\n  - Incorporate philosophical language to explore the narrative's moral and ethical dimensions, using terms like \"a delicate balance of power\" and \"the weight of ancient promises\" to emphasize the story's depth.\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>\nTo create the **Story Rules** for the given Writing Prompt, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt involves humanity using FTL travel via astral projection to explore and communicate with other civilizations.
