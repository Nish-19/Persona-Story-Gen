    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Author Writing Sheet and the Writing Prompt, I will focus on the author's unique storytelling style, which emphasizes internal conflict, familial expectations, humor, and introspection. The Writing Prompt presents a scenario ripe for exploring themes of societal norms and personal beliefs, which can be effectively addressed through the author's style. I will create rules that guide the narrative to focus on the protagonist's internal struggles with the societal norms of the kingdom, using humor and introspection to explore these themes. The setting will be richly detailed to enhance the narrative's immersive quality, and the language will reflect the author's conversational and introspective tone.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative around the hero's internal conflict with the kingdom's societal norms, focusing on their beliefs about slavery and women's rights. Begin with the hero's initial shock and internal monologue reflecting on their own world's values, such as, \"In my world, freedom isn't just a word; it's a right.\"\n  - Introduce conflict through the hero's interactions with the king and court, highlighting their internal struggle rather than external threats. For example, depict a scene where the hero is asked to participate in a ceremony that contradicts their beliefs, prompting them to internally debate, \"Do I stand by my principles or play along to survive?\"\n  - Incorporate a humorous and unexpected twist by revealing a familial connection or secret within the royal family that aligns with the hero's beliefs, such as the king's daughter secretly advocating for women's rights, adding a layer of irony and surprise to the plot.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Integrate a unique familial and courtly context to reinterpret the prompt, detailing the kingdom's traditions and the hero's contrasting background. Use the hero's reflections on their family and past experiences to add depth, such as, \"Back home, my sister leads armies, not tea parties.\"\n  - Use a single character interaction, such as a conversation with the king's advisor, to explore broader themes of identity and self-worth. The advisor might challenge the hero's beliefs, prompting introspection: \"Am I truly a hero if I can't change a single mind?\"\n  - Creatively use humor and irony to reinterpret the prompt, such as the hero sarcastically commenting on the kingdom's outdated practices, \"Next, they'll tell me dragons are real and they fetch the morning paper.\"\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the hero's character through introspection and comparisons to their own world, highlighting their internal struggle with the kingdom's norms. Use lines like, \"If I wasn't so stubborn, maybe I'd fit in here,\" to deepen the reader's understanding of their conflict.\n  - Establish an immersive setting by focusing on sensory details and the emotional impact of the kingdom's environment. Describe the opulent yet oppressive atmosphere of the court, with \"gilded walls that seem to close in with every decree.\"\n  - Develop characters through internal monologue and casual interactions, such as the hero's thoughts during a royal banquet, revealing their motivations and insecurities: \"I should be saving worlds, not sipping soup.\"\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a conversational and introspective tone to convey the hero's internal dialogue, using casual reflections like, \"Being a hero isn't all it's cracked up to be,\" to add authenticity to their perspective.\n  - Use vivid imagery and metaphor to convey emotional depth and internal conflict, such as describing the hero's frustration as \"a storm brewing beneath a calm facade.\"\n  - Employ introspective and reflective language to convey the hero's internal struggle and emotional complexity, with thoughts like, \"Am I the fool for believing in change, or are they for resisting it?\"\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt involves a council regretting their decision to allow forbidden arts to be taught, focusing on the psychological impact on students rather than the misuse of power. This theme of internal conflict and unexpected consequences aligns well with the author's style, which emphasizes internal struggles, familial expectations, and humor.\n\n1. **Plot**: The author often structures narratives around internal conflicts and unexpected twists. For this prompt, the plot should focus on the internal struggles of students dealing with the psychological impact of forbidden arts, with a humorous or ironic twist regarding the council's decision.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The author uses unique contexts and character interactions to explore themes of identity and self-worth. The story should creatively explore the academic setting of forbidden arts, using humor and irony to highlight the council's oversight and the students' struggles.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The author develops characters through introspection and rich backstories, often using sensory details to create immersive settings. Characters should be developed through their internal monologues and interactions, with the setting vividly described to reflect the emotional impact of the forbidden arts.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The author employs a conversational tone and vivid imagery to convey internal dialogue and emotional depth. The language should be introspective and reflective, using humor and metaphor to express the students' internal conflicts and the council's regret.\n\nUsing these insights, I will craft Story Rules that guide the language model in creating a narrative that aligns with both the Writing Prompt and the author's style.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative around the internal conflicts of students grappling with the psychological impact of forbidden arts. Begin with a scene where a student reflects on their mental state, thinking, \"I thought learning forbidden arts would make me powerful, not paranoid.\"\n  - Introduce conflict through the students' internal struggles and their interactions with each other, rather than external threats. For example, depict a student confiding in a friend, \"I can't sleep anymore. Every shadow feels like it's watching me.\"\n  - Incorporate a humorous and unexpected twist regarding the council's decision. Reveal that the council's regret stems from an unexpected consequence, such as a student accidentally summoning a harmless but annoying creature that disrupts council meetings.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Integrate a unique academic context by detailing the curriculum of forbidden arts and its unintended psychological effects. Describe a class where students are taught to \"peer into the abyss,\" only to find themselves haunted by what they see.\n  - Use character interactions to explore broader themes of identity and self-worth. Show a student questioning their decision to study forbidden arts, saying, \"Am I just another failed experiment in the council's grand plan?\"\n  - Blend humor and irony to reinterpret the prompt. Include a scene where a council member jokes, \"We wanted to create the next generation of wizards, not insomniacs.\"\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through introspection and familial comparisons. Have a student reflect on their family's expectations, thinking, \"My parents wanted a prodigy, not a nervous wreck.\"\n  - Establish an immersive setting by focusing on sensory details and the emotional impact of the environment. Describe the academy as a place where \"the air is thick with whispers of forgotten spells, and the walls seem to pulse with unseen energy.\"\n  - Use internal monologue and casual interactions to reveal character motivations and insecurities. For instance, a student might internally debate, \"Is this madness worth the power they promised?\"\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a conversational and introspective tone to convey the protagonist's internal dialogue. Use lines like, \"Forbidden arts sounded cool until I realized they come with a lifetime of therapy.\"\n  - Use vivid imagery and metaphor to convey emotional depth and internal conflict. Describe a student's anxiety as \"a shadow that clings to my thoughts, whispering doubts in the silence.\"\n  - Use introspective and reflective language to express the protagonist's internal struggle and emotional complexity. Include thoughts like, \"I wanted to be extraordinary, but now I just want to be okay.\"\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the given Writing Prompt and the Author Writing Sheet, I will analyze each category to extract the author's unique storytelling style and apply it to the prompt. The prompt suggests a world where ignorance enhances magical power, which can be explored through internal conflicts, familial expectations, and humorous twists, as seen in the author's style. The author's creativity often involves reinterpreting prompts through unique contexts and character interactions, which can be applied to explore themes of identity and self-worth in this magical setting. Character development is achieved through introspection and rich backstories, which can be used to deepen the protagonist's struggle with understanding magic. The author's language use is conversational and introspective, employing vivid imagery and metaphor, which can enhance the narrative's emotional depth and humor.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Structure the narrative around the protagonist's internal conflict with their desire to understand magic versus the need to remain ignorant to maintain power. Begin with the protagonist reflecting on their family's expectations of magical prowess, stating something like, \"In a family of geniuses, I am the only one who can cast a spell without thinking.\"  \n  - Introduce conflict through the protagonist's internal struggle and dynamics with a mentor or peer who values knowledge over power. For example, have a scene where the protagonist debates with a scholarly mage who says, \"Knowledge is the true power,\" highlighting the protagonist's dilemma.  \n  - Incorporate a humorous and unexpected twist where the protagonist accidentally becomes the most powerful mage by forgetting everything they learned, perhaps through a comedic mishap like hitting their head and losing their memory, leading to a surprising resolution.  \n\n- **Creativity**:  \n  - Integrate a unique academic context where the protagonist is at a magical academy that paradoxically rewards ignorance. Describe the academy's absurd rules, such as \"The less you know, the higher your grade,\" to create a layered backdrop.  \n  - Use a single character interaction, such as a conversation with a fellow student who struggles with the same issue, to explore broader themes of identity and self-worth. For instance, have the protagonist say, \"I used to think being smart was everything, but now I see it's just a burden.\"  \n  - Blend humor with the magical theme by incorporating ironic elements, like a spell that backfires hilariously when the protagonist tries to learn more about it, leading to a comedic situation where they accidentally summon a magical creature that only obeys the ignorant.  \n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:  \n  - Develop the protagonist's character through introspection and comparisons with their family, who are all knowledgeable but powerless mages. Use lines like, \"If I wasn't the only one who could cast a spell, I'd be just another disappointment,\" to deepen the reader's understanding of their internal struggle.  \n  - Establish an immersive setting by focusing on sensory details of the magical world, such as describing the chaotic energy of spells cast by ignorant mages, with phrases like, \"The air crackled with unpredictable magic, a symphony of chaos only the foolish could conduct.\"  \n  - Develop characters through internal monologue and casual interactions, such as the protagonist's thoughts on their peers' attempts to balance knowledge and power, revealing their motivations and insecurities.  \n\n- **Language Use**:  \n  - Employ a conversational and introspective tone to convey the protagonist's internal dialogue, using casual reflections like, \"Magic is a joke, and I'm the punchline,\" to add authenticity to their perspective.  \n  - Use vivid imagery and metaphor to convey the emotional depth of the protagonist's conflict, such as describing their struggle with understanding magic as \"a dance on the edge of a cliff, where one wrong step could mean losing everything.\"  \n  - Incorporate introspective and reflective language to express the protagonist's emotional complexity, with thoughts like, \"Maybe ignorance is bliss, but it's also a prison,\" to reveal their internal struggle.  \n</story_rules>"
