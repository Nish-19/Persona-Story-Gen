    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the given Writing Prompt and the Author Writing Sheet, I will analyze each category to extract the author's unique storytelling style. The Writing Prompt suggests a narrative involving a romantic or emotional conflict between an elf and a human, which can be explored through themes of love, identity, and the challenges of interspecies relationships. The author's style, characterized by delayed revelations, introspection, and a blend of reality with surreal elements, will be crucial in crafting a narrative that is both reflective and engaging. I will ensure that the Story Rules incorporate these elements while tailoring them to the themes and potential of the Writing Prompt.  \n</thinking>  \n\n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Structure the narrative with a delayed revelation. Begin with a seemingly ordinary interaction between the elf and the human, gradually revealing the elf's true identity and the historical context of their relationship. For example, the human might find an ancient letter or artifact that hints at the elf's past, leading to a reflective journey of discovery.\n  - Focus on internal conflict and psychological struggles. Explore the emotional turmoil of the elf as they grapple with their feelings for the human and the implications of their different lifespans and cultures. Use internal monologues to delve into the elf's past experiences with love and loss.\n  - Employ a non-linear timeline. Interweave past memories of the elf's previous relationships with humans and their current interactions, creating a layered understanding of the elf's reluctance to pursue a relationship.\n  - Develop the plot around an ordinary human inadvertently becoming part of an extraordinary situation. The human might initially be unaware of the elf's true nature, only to discover it through a series of mysterious events or conversations.\n\n- **Creativity**:  \n  - Integrate elements of mystery and introspection. Create a sense of curiosity and wonder as the human tries to understand the elf's world and the reasons behind their reluctance to engage in a relationship.\n  - Blend reality with surreal elements. Introduce dreamlike sequences where the human experiences visions of the elf's past, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy.\n  - Employ humor and absurdity to lighten the narrative. Use witty dialogue and unexpected scenarios, such as the elf humorously explaining their aversion to modern technology or human customs, to add a comedic twist to the story.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:  \n  - Develop characters through subtle interactions and introspective reflections. Use minimal but meaningful exchanges between the elf and the human to reveal their deep emotional connection and the complexities of their relationship.\n  - Create a multidimensional protagonist by exploring the elf's past and present psychological state. Highlight the elf's internal struggles with their identity and the consequences of past relationships with humans.\n  - Develop the setting with a blend of mundane and fantastical elements. Describe the human's world with everyday details, contrasting it with the elf's ethereal and timeless realm, to emphasize the differences between their lives.\n\n- **Language Use**:  \n  - Employ a conversational and introspective tone to convey nostalgia and curiosity. Use dialogue that reflects the elf's wisdom and the human's inquisitiveness, such as, \"You humans always rush, but time is a river to us.\"\n  - Use vivid, sensory language to convey the elf's psychological turmoil and create an immersive experience. Describe the elf's memories with phrases like \"the scent of ancient forests\" and \"the whisper of forgotten songs\" to evoke a sense of timelessness and longing.\n  - Use casual and conversational language to create a light-hearted tone. Incorporate informal exchanges that highlight the cultural differences between the elf and the human, such as, \"You really don't like pizza? It's a human staple!\"\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt involves a character in Hell, tasked with completing seven impossible tasks based on their greatest sins. This scenario offers rich potential for introspection, psychological exploration, and creative narrative structures, all of which are prominent in the author's style.\n\n**Plot**: The author often uses delayed revelations, non-linear timelines, and internal conflicts. For this prompt, the plot can unfold through a series of reflective and introspective tasks, each revealing a deeper understanding of the protagonist's sins and personal history. The narrative should intersperse past memories with present challenges, creating a layered and complex storyline.\n\n**Creativity**: The author blends reality with surreal elements and employs humor and absurdity. The tasks in Hell can be creatively designed to reflect the protagonist's sins in unexpected and surreal ways, incorporating elements of mystery and introspection. Humor can be used to provide relief and contrast to the otherwise intense setting.\n\n**Development (Character and Setting)**: Characters are developed through introspection, subtle interactions, and emotional complexity. The protagonist's journey through Hell should reveal their psychological state and personal history, with each task offering insights into their character. The setting of Hell can be depicted with vivid, surreal details that reflect the protagonist's internal struggles.\n\n**Language Use**: The author uses a conversational and introspective tone, vivid sensory language, and humor. The narrative should employ introspective monologues and vivid descriptions to convey the protagonist's psychological turmoil and the surreal nature of Hell. Dialogue can be used to reveal character emotions and provide humor.\n\nWith these insights, I will craft Story Rules that guide the language model in creating a narrative that aligns with both the Writing Prompt and the author's unique style.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative with a delayed revelation, where the protagonist gradually uncovers the true nature of their sins through each task. For example, a task might initially seem straightforward, like retrieving a lost item, but ultimately reveals a deeper sin, such as betrayal.\n  - Use a non-linear timeline to intersperse memories of the protagonist's life with their current experiences in Hell. For instance, while facing a task related to greed, flash back to a childhood memory of stealing a toy.\n  - Focus on internal conflict and psychological struggles as the protagonist confronts each sin. Highlight their emotional journey and moments of introspection, such as realizing the impact of their actions on others.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Integrate surreal elements into the tasks, making them ambiguous and dreamlike. For example, a task might involve navigating a labyrinth that shifts and changes based on the protagonist's thoughts and emotions.\n  - Employ humor and absurdity to reinterpret the tasks in an unconventional manner. A task could involve a comedic scenario, like convincing a stubborn demon to let them pass by making them laugh.\n  - Blend elements of mystery and introspection, encouraging the protagonist to question the reality of their situation and the true nature of their sins.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist through introspective reflections and subtle interactions with other characters in Hell. Use internal monologues to reveal their doubts, fears, and realizations.\n  - Create a multidimensional protagonist by exploring their past and present psychological state. Each task should reveal a different aspect of their character, such as their motivations and regrets.\n  - Depict Hell with vivid, surreal details that reflect the protagonist's internal struggles. For example, describe the environment as constantly shifting, with landscapes that mirror the protagonist's emotional state.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a conversational and introspective tone to convey the protagonist's nostalgia and curiosity about their past actions. Use internal monologues to explore their thoughts and emotions.\n  - Use vivid, sensory language to create an immersive experience, describing the sights, sounds, and sensations of Hell in detail. For example, describe the oppressive heat and the eerie silence that surrounds the protagonist.\n  - Incorporate humor and casual dialogue to lighten the tone and provide contrast to the intense setting. Use exchanges with other characters to reveal emotions and relationship dynamics, such as a humorous banter with a demon guide.\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Author Writing Sheet and the Writing Prompt, I will analyze the author's unique storytelling style across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. I will then tailor these insights to the Writing Prompt, which involves a maid helping a noblewoman avoid her fate as a villainess in a 'video game' world. The narrative should incorporate elements of delayed revelation, internal conflict, non-linear timelines, and ordinary characters in extraordinary situations, as well as a blend of mystery, introspection, and humor. Characters should be developed through introspection, backstories, and emotional complexity, while language should be conversational, vivid, and immersive.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Structure the narrative with a delayed revelation.

Shift between the noblewoman's current attempts to change her fate and flashbacks to key moments in her 'video game' life, such as her execution or pivotal villainous acts.\n  - Develop the plot around an ordinary character, the maid, who becomes part of an extraordinary situation. Illustrate how the maid, initially just a servant, becomes a crucial ally in the noblewoman's quest to rewrite her destiny.\n\n- **Creativity**:  \n  - Integrate elements of mystery and introspection. Create a sense of intrigue around the noblewoman's claims, prompting the maid to piece together clues from the noblewoman's past life and current behavior.\n  - Blend reality with surreal elements to create an ambiguous narrative. Introduce dreamlike sequences where the noblewoman relives her 'video game' life, leaving both her and the maid questioning the nature of their reality.\n  - Employ humor and absurdity to reinterpret the prompt.

Describe her visions and memories with phrases like \"the echo of a distant executioner's axe\" or \"the cold dread of a scripted fate.\"\n  - Use casual and conversational language to create a light-hearted tone. Infuse the narrative with humor through the maid's observations and interactions, such as, \"Well, if this is a game, where's the pause button when you need it?\"\n</story_rules>",
