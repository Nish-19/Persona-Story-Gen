    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt \"You traveled 600 years into the future. The future is bad,\" I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet to identify key storytelling elements. The author frequently uses internal conflict, existential themes, and philosophical dialogue to structure plots. Humor and irony are also employed to reinterpret prompts creatively. Characters are developed through introspection, dialogue, and comedic misunderstandings, while settings are hinted at through indirect world-building. Language use varies from formal and introspective to darkly humorous and playful, depending on the narrative tone. I will incorporate these elements into the Story Rules, ensuring they are tailored to the dystopian future theme of the prompt.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative around the protagonist's internal conflict and existential themes. Begin with the protagonist's arrival in the future, reflecting on the stark contrast between their expectations and the grim reality. Use their internal monologue to explore their disillusionment and the existential dread of a decayed world. For example, have the protagonist ponder, \"Is this the legacy we left behind, a world where hope is a forgotten relic?\"\n  - Center the story around a central confrontation using dialogue to explore the protagonist's delusions about the future. Introduce a character from the future who challenges the protagonist's assumptions, leading to a philosophical exchange. For instance, the future character might say, \"You thought progress was inevitable, but look around\u2014this is the cost of unchecked ambition.\"\n  - Incorporate a humorous and deceptive interaction to provide levity. Perhaps the protagonist encounters a group of future inhabitants who use absurd disguises to hide from oppressive surveillance, leading to a comedic misunderstanding. An example could be a character wearing a \"magnificent mustache\" made of recycled materials, claiming to be a \"time-traveling historian.\"\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Integrate existential and philosophical elements into the narrative by having the protagonist question the nature of progress and humanity's legacy. Use their reflections to explore themes of technological overreach and environmental collapse. For example, the protagonist might muse, \"What if the future we dreamed of was always a mirage, a shadow cast by our own hubris?\"\n  - Employ humor and irony to reinterpret the prompt. Introduce a scene where the protagonist encounters a \"Museum of the Past,\" filled with ironic exhibits like \"The Last Smartphone\" or \"The Great Social Media Collapse,\" highlighting the absurdity of past obsessions.\n  - Creatively reinterpret the prompt by introducing a bureaucratic element to the protagonist's attempt to return to their time. Depict a convoluted process involving \"Time Travel Permits\" and \"Temporal Adjustment Forms,\" adding a unique twist to the narrative.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist's character through introspection and moral conflict. Use their internal dialogue to reveal their struggle with the future's harsh realities and their role in shaping it. For instance, the protagonist might reflect, \"Did I contribute to this dystopia, or was I merely a spectator?\"\n  - Develop characters through their interactions and philosophical exchanges. Introduce a future character who serves as a guide, challenging the protagonist's beliefs and prompting deeper introspection. This character could say, \"Your time was the tipping point; now we live in the aftermath.\"\n  - Develop the setting through indirect world-building, hinting at a collapsed society and new regimes. Use background details, such as remnants of old technology and faded propaganda posters, to suggest a broader historical context. Describe scenes like \"the crumbling skyscrapers, now mere skeletons of ambition.\"\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a formal and introspective tone to convey the protagonist's internal struggle. Use reflective language to emphasize the gravity of their situation, with phrases like \"the echoes of a forgotten future\" and \"a world unraveling at the seams.\"\n  - Use dark humor and a casual tone to create a distinctive narrative voice. Incorporate irreverent remarks from the protagonist, such as, \"Well, this isn't exactly the utopia I signed up for,\" to add a layer of dark humor to their observations.\n  - Use playful and exaggerated language to enhance the comedic tone in lighter moments. Describe absurd future inventions with phrases like \"the revolutionary self-toasting bread\" or \"the infamous hoverboard that never hovers,\" contributing to the narrative's humor.\n</story_rules>",
