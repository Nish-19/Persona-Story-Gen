    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The prompt involves a genie and a hypothetical wish, suggesting themes of magic, caution, and potential consequences. The author's style includes building suspense, integrating supernatural elements, and using vivid language. I will create rules that incorporate these elements, ensuring they are actionable and tailored to the prompt.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative with a gradual build-up of suspense leading to a climactic revelation. Begin with the protagonist's casual interaction with the genie, noticing subtle hints of the genie's unease, such as a flicker in his eyes or a hesitant pause before answering. Build tension as the protagonist presses for more information, leading to a climactic moment where the genie reveals the true implications of the hypothetical wish.\n  - Focus on personal confrontations and emotional stakes. Develop a scene where the protagonist directly engages with the genie, challenging his warnings and expressing curiosity about the limits of his powers, creating a tense and emotionally charged exchange.\n  - Create a sense of psychological manipulation and tension. Have the genie attempt to manipulate the protagonist's perception by suggesting that their curiosity is a dangerous path, using phrases like, \"Your mind is drawn to the unknown, but not all mysteries are meant to be unraveled.\"\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Integrate supernatural elements to reinterpret the prompt in an imaginative way. Introduce a backstory for the genie, revealing a hidden legacy of ancient magic and the consequences of past wishes, transforming the narrative into a tale of magical realism.\n  - Blend psychological elements with the supernatural to create a complex narrative. Explore the protagonist's internal struggle with the temptation of the wish, using the genie's warnings to heighten the suspense and create a narrative that feels both intimate and suspenseful.\n  - Use the protagonist's internal monologue to reveal a sinister undertone. As the protagonist considers the hypothetical wish, their thoughts should reveal a darker curiosity, such as, \"What if I could change everything with a single word? The power is intoxicating.\"\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through their emotional and psychological depth, focusing on internal conflicts. The protagonist should grapple with feelings of temptation and curiosity, questioning their own motives and the potential consequences of their hypothetical wish.\n  - Use dialogue and shared history to create emotional depth.

Describe the genie's appearance and the atmosphere of the setting with phrases like \"the air shimmered with an ethereal glow\" and \"the genie's voice was a whisper of ancient winds.\"\n  - Use vivid and emotionally charged language to convey the protagonist's inner turmoil and resolve. Capture their internal conflict with phrases like \"a storm of possibilities raged within me\" and \"my curiosity was a double-edged sword, both thrilling and terrifying.\"\n  - Employ a reflective and philosophical tone to explore themes of identity and perception.
