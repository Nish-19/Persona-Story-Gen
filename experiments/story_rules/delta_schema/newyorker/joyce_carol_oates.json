    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will focus on the following elements from the Author Writing Sheet:\n\n1. **Plot**: The author uses a repetitive cycle that escalates to a dramatic climax. For the Writing Prompt, this could involve a routine in a hospice setting that builds tension and leads to a significant emotional or narrative climax.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The author introduces a tragic twist that transforms a mundane routine into a fatal event. In the context of the Writing Prompt, this could mean turning a seemingly ordinary hospice routine into a moment of profound realization or change.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: Characters are developed through interactions and emotional tension. In the hospice setting, this could involve the interactions between patients, family members, and staff, highlighting their emotional struggles and connections.\n\n4. **Language Use**: Repetitive dialogue is used to emphasize emotional states. For the Writing Prompt, this could involve the repetition of certain phrases or words that capture the heaviness and eventual lightness in the hospice environment.\n\nWith these elements in mind, I will create Story Rules that guide the narrative to reflect the author's style while addressing the themes of the Writing Prompt.  \n</thinking>  \n\n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Structure the narrative around a repetitive cycle within the hospice setting. Begin with a daily routine, such as the morning rounds of a nurse checking on patients, which initially feels mundane. Use this cycle to build tension, leading to a dramatic climax where a significant event or realization occurs, such as a patient unexpectedly finding peace or a family member coming to terms with the situation. For example, the nurse might repeatedly ask, \"How are you feeling today?\" to each patient, with responses that gradually reveal deeper emotional truths.\n\n- **Creativity**:  \n  - Introduce a tragic twist that reinterprets the routine in the hospice. Transform an ordinary event, like a patient's quiet acceptance of their condition, into a moment of profound impact, such as inspiring hope in others. This twist should feel unexpected yet inevitable, adding depth to the narrative. For instance, a patient who always responds with \"I'm just waiting\" might one day say, \"I'm ready,\" shifting the atmosphere from despair to acceptance and light.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:  \n  - Develop characters through their interactions and the emotional tension these create. Focus on the relationships between patients, their families, and the hospice staff. Highlight the emotional struggles and connections through dialogue and actions. For example, a family member might repeatedly ask, \"Is there anything more we can do?\" to the staff, reflecting their desperation and the staff's compassionate responses, \"We're doing everything we can.\"\n\n- **Language Use**:  \n  - Use repetitive dialogue to emphasize the emotional states of characters. Incorporate phrases that capture the heaviness of the hospice environment and the eventual emergence of light. For instance, the word \"hospice\" itself could be repeated in conversations, initially carrying a weight of finality but gradually becoming associated with peace and acceptance. Dialogue such as \"It's just hospice\" might evolve into \"It's a place of peace,\" reflecting the shift in perception.  \n</story_rules>"
