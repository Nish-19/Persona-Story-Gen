    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt involves a narrative of rediscovery and revelation, which can be effectively structured using the author's style of gradual progression and introspection. The author's use of surreal and symbolic elements can enhance the theme of uncovering hidden truths. Character development will focus on evolving dynamics and introspection, while language use will balance simplicity with vivid metaphorical expressions.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the narrative with a chance encounter between the protagonist and their old college friend at a familiar location, such as a coffee shop or a college reunion. Use this meeting as the starting point for a gradual progression into a deeper exploration of the friend's life.\n  - Structure the story around the protagonist's introspection rather than external confrontation. As the protagonist observes their friend from a distance, focus on their internal reflections and realizations about the changes in their friend's life.\n  - Conclude the story with the protagonist contemplating the nature of change and the passage of time, rather than resolving the external mystery of their friend's transformation. For example, end with the protagonist sitting alone, sipping coffee, and pondering the fleeting nature of perfection.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Integrate a blend of ordinary life and surreal elements to explore the theme of rediscovery. For instance, describe the friend's seemingly perfect life with fantastical metaphors, such as their smile being \"as polished as a mirror reflecting a world of dreams.\"\n  - Use symbolic elements to highlight the protagonist's growing awareness of their friend's imperfections. Describe a moment where the protagonist sees their friend drop a cup, and the shattering sound echoes like \"the breaking of a porcelain mask,\" symbolizing the revelation of hidden flaws.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist's character through their evolving perception of their friend. Initially, depict the protagonist's admiration and nostalgia, which gradually shifts to curiosity and concern as they notice inconsistencies in their friend's behavior.\n  - Use the setting to reflect the protagonist's introspection. Describe the environment in detail, such as the bustling coffee shop filled with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, which mirrors the protagonist's internal contemplation and the warmth of past memories.\n  - Highlight the friend's character through subtle interactions and changes in demeanor. For example, show the friend laughing too loudly or glancing nervously around, suggesting underlying tension.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ simple, direct language to convey the protagonist's initial admiration and subsequent disillusionment. For example, use phrases like \"I once thought they were invincible, but now I see the cracks in their armor.\"\n  - Use vivid and metaphorical language to express the protagonist's emotional journey. Describe their realization with metaphors such as \"like peeling back layers of an onion, each revelation brought tears to my eyes.\"\n  - Balance straightforward narrative with moments of poetic introspection, ensuring that the language reflects both the clarity of observation and the complexity of emotional response.\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt involves a couple moving into a peculiar house, suggesting themes of mystery, domestic life, and potential supernatural or surreal elements. The author's style emphasizes gradual narrative progression, introspection, blending of domestic and fantastical elements, character development through relationships and routines, and a mix of simple and metaphorical language. I will incorporate these elements into the Story Rules, ensuring they are actionable and tailored to the prompt.  \n</thinking>  \n\n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the narrative with the couple's initial excitement and curiosity about the wedge-shaped house, highlighting their decision to move in due to its low rent. Progress the story through their daily life, gradually introducing the unsettling aspects of the Triangle Zone, such as strange noises or inexplicable occurrences. Culminate the plot in a life-altering realization or event that challenges their understanding of the house, focusing on introspection rather than external resolution. For example, have the protagonist reflect on the house's impact on their relationship and personal growth, rather than solving the mystery outright.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Integrate a blend of domestic life and surreal elements to explore the couple's relationship and the house's mysteries. Use the setting of the wedge-shaped house to introduce fantastical elements, such as rooms that seem to change size or objects that move on their own. These elements should serve as metaphors for the couple's evolving relationship and the secrets of the Triangle Zone. For instance, describe a scene where the protagonist finds a room filled with old, forgotten items that seem to whisper stories of past inhabitants, adding a surreal layer to their domestic routine.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the characters through their interactions and the evolving dynamics of their relationship as they adapt to life in the Triangle Zone. Highlight how the house and its peculiarities influence their emotions and decisions. For example, show the protagonist's growing unease and introspection as they notice changes in their partner's behavior, possibly linked to the house's influence. Use the setting of the wedge-shaped house to reflect the characters' internal states, such as describing how the narrow hallways mirror the protagonist's feelings of confinement or isolation.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ simple, direct language to convey the complex emotional states and relationship dynamics of the couple. Use straightforward expressions to describe their initial excitement and subsequent unease, such as \"The house felt like a bargain at first, but now it seemed to hold us in its grip.\" Additionally, incorporate vivid and metaphorical language to express the protagonist's emotional journey, using phrases like \"The trains roared past like restless spirits, echoing the turmoil within our walls,\" to convey the sense of mystery and tension in the Triangle Zone.\n</story_rules>"
