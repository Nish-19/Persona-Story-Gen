    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Author Writing Sheet and the Writing Prompt, I will analyze each category to extract the author's unique storytelling style and apply it to the prompt about a man contemplating assassination. The author uses non-traditional plot structures, satire, character development through professional roles and anecdotes, and humor and irony in language. These elements will be adapted to the prompt's themes of moral conflict and political intrigue.\n\n1. **Plot**: The author uses non-traditional formats to convey narratives. For the prompt, this could mean structuring the story as a series of internal monologues or letters to a confidant, allowing the protagonist to explore his moral dilemma intimately.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The author employs satire to critique societal norms. In the context of the prompt, this could involve satirical elements that critique political systems or the absurdity of power dynamics, perhaps through exaggerated depictions of the new leader's policies.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: Characters are developed through professional roles and personal anecdotes. The protagonist's past as an assassin and his current internal conflict can be revealed through anecdotes about previous missions and personal reflections on the consequences of his actions.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The author uses humor and irony to enhance the narrative. This could be applied to the protagonist's reflections on the futility of political change or the irony of his situation, adding depth to his internal struggle.\n\nThese insights will guide the creation of detailed, actionable Story Rules that reflect the author's style and align with the Writing Prompt.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative as a series of internal monologues or letters from the protagonist to a trusted confidant. Use this format to delve deeply into his moral conflict about assassinating the new leader. For example, a letter might begin with, \"Dear [Confidant's Name], I find myself at a crossroads once more, haunted by the specter of my past actions...\"\n  - Introduce the story with a non-linear timeline, starting with a pivotal moment from the protagonist's past assassination, then jumping to the present dilemma. This approach will create suspense and provide context for his current struggle.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Incorporate satirical elements to critique the new leader's regime. Use exaggerated policies or public statements to highlight the absurdity of the leader's rule. For instance, describe a policy that mandates citizens to wear identical clothing to promote 'unity,' which the protagonist finds both ridiculous and terrifying.\n  - Use the protagonist's reflections to satirize the political system, perhaps through a conversation with a fellow dissenter who mocks the leader's attempts at propaganda, saying, \"If only charisma could be bottled, he'd have us all drinking it by the gallon.\"\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist through his professional past as an assassin and personal anecdotes about his previous missions. Reveal his motivations and internal conflict through these stories, such as a mission where he spared a life, which now haunts him as he considers his next move.\n  - Set the story in a dystopian cityscape that reflects the oppressive nature of the new regime. Use vivid descriptions to create a sense of claustrophobia and tension, such as \"The city loomed with gray monoliths, each window a watchful eye, each street a silent witness to the regime's iron grip.\"\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ humor and irony in the protagonist's internal dialogue to underscore the absurdity of his situation. For example, he might think, \"Funny how the world keeps spinning, even when you're contemplating stopping it with a single bullet.\"\n  - Use ironic observations to highlight the futility of political change, such as the protagonist noting, \"The more things change, the more they stay the same\u2014only the faces on the posters differ, and even those start to blur after a while.\"\n</story_rules>"
