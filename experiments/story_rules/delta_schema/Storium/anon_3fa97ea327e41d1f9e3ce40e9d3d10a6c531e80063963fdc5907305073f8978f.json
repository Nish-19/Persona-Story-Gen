    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt involves a salvage job in a chaotic trade station setting, suggesting themes of mystery, intrigue, and potential conflict. The author's style emphasizes emotional journeys, cultural context, procedural details, and introspective language, which will be integrated into the Story Rules.  \n\nFor **Plot**, the narrative should focus on the protagonist's emotional journey and internal conflict, as well as the cultural context of Trade Station Heraklion. The plot should build anticipation through detailed procedural elements, reflecting the author's methodical tone.\n\nIn **Creativity**, the story should reinterpret the prompt by emphasizing psychological stakes and integrating cultural elements of the trade station and the Rivera Belt. Interactive elements could be used to engage the reader, reflecting the author's style.\n\nFor **Development (Character and Setting)**, characters should be developed through introspection and dialogue, revealing their internal states and cultural interactions. The setting should be vividly described through the social dynamics of the trade station.\n\nIn **Language Use**, a reflective and introspective tone should be employed, with formal language to convey cultural depth. Dialogue should reveal character perspectives and cultural attitudes, aligning with the author's style.\n\nThese insights will guide the creation of detailed, actionable Story Rules tailored to the Writing Prompt.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative around the protagonist's emotional journey as they navigate the complexities of the salvage job. Begin with their initial hesitation and internal conflict about accepting the job, leading to a significant emotional turning point when they uncover a personal connection to the cargo. For example, describe their realization with a line like, \"As the fixer spoke, a familiar name flickered across the data pad, sending a chill down their spine.\"\n  - Emphasize the cultural context of Trade Station Heraklion by focusing on the skepticism and attitudes of the station's inhabitants towards outsiders and salvage operations. Include scenes where locals dismiss the protagonist's mission, using dialogue such as, \"Salvage in the Rivera Belt? You must be new here, or just plain desperate.\"\n  - Build anticipation through detailed procedural elements, such as the process of securing permits and navigating the station's bureaucracy. Describe these with a methodical tone: \"The permit office was a labyrinth of forms and regulations, each step more convoluted than the last, designed to test the patience of even the most seasoned salvager.\"\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Reinterpret the prompt by focusing on the psychological stakes of the salvage job.

Include references to the station's history and the myths surrounding the Rivera Belt, such as, \"Legends spoke of the Rivera Belt as a graveyard of lost ships, each wreck a testament to the greed and folly of those who dared to claim its secrets.\"\n  - Enhance reader engagement with interactive elements, such as decision points where the protagonist must choose allies or strategies.

Use internal monologue to reveal their fears and motivations: \"In the quiet moments, doubt crept in, whispering of past failures and the cost of ambition.\"\n  - Develop characters through dialogue and cultural interactions, revealing their personalities and backgrounds. Use conversations with station inhabitants to showcase diverse perspectives, such as a grizzled mechanic's warning: \"In this line of work, it's not the cargo you should fear, but those who seek it.\"\n  - Establish the setting by embedding it within the cultural and social dynamics of Trade Station Heraklion. Describe the bustling marketplace and the eclectic mix of traders and travelers, using vivid imagery: \"The air was thick with the scent of exotic spices and the hum of a hundred languages, each stall a microcosm of the galaxy's diversity.\"\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a reflective and introspective tone, using detailed internal monologue to convey the protagonist's emotions and thoughts. Capture their internal conflict with lines like, \"In the solitude of their quarters, the weight of the decision settled heavily, a constant reminder of the stakes involved.\"\n  - Use formal language to convey the narrative's cultural depth and descriptive setting. Describe the trade station's environment with precision: \"Heraklion was a marvel of engineering, a sprawling hub of commerce and intrigue, where every corridor held a story waiting to unfold.\"\n  - Use dialogue to reveal character perspectives and cultural attitudes, highlighting the diverse beliefs and skepticism of the station's inhabitants. Include exchanges like, \"The Rivera Belt is a siren's call, luring the unwary to their doom. Why do you think you'll fare any better?\"  \n</story_rules>",
