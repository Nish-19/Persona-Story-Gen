    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt involves a future where the Roman Empire dominates interstellar travel, focusing on a Chinese diplomat's journey to a Roman colony. The narrative should reflect the author's style of juxtaposing contrasting lives, high-stakes crises, and internal/external conflicts. The creativity should blend historical Roman elements with futuristic settings. Characters should be developed through detailed descriptions, roles, and crisis interactions. Language should be formal, reflective, and precise, conveying tension and introspection. I will create Story Rules that incorporate these elements, ensuring they are actionable and tailored to the Writing Prompt.  \n</thinking>  \n\n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Structure the narrative by juxtaposing the daily routines of the Chinese diplomat and a Roman official, highlighting their contrasting lives and perspectives.
