    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt involves a young boy's friendship with a delivery worker, exploring themes of fate, family, and history. The author\u2019s style includes structuring plots around pivotal events, using cultural and historical elements, developing characters through dialogue, and employing vivid, sensory language. I will create Story Rules that incorporate these elements, ensuring they are tailored to the prompt's themes and narrative potential.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the plot around the pivotal event of the delivery worker's untimely death. Focus on the immediate impact on the young boy, concluding the narrative shortly after he learns the tragic story, without extending into future resolutions. For example, depict the boy sitting on the delivery worker's truck, reflecting on their last conversation, and deciding to visit the worker's family to pay respects.\n  - Use a series of dialogues to explore the boy's curiosity about the delivery worker's life and dreams. Include conversations where the boy asks about the worker's aspirations, such as, \"What do you want to do after all these deliveries?\" and the worker responds with dreams of opening a restaurant.\n  - Incorporate casual dialogue and humorous exchanges between the boy and the delivery worker to build their relationship. For instance, have the worker joke about the boy's school lunches, saying, \"You call that a sandwich? My grandma could do better with her eyes closed.\"\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Integrate cultural and historical elements to enrich the narrative, challenging societal norms. For example, the delivery worker might share stories of his immigrant background, linking his dreams to his family's history and struggles, saying, \"My grandpa came here with nothing but a suitcase and a recipe for the best empanadas.\"\n  - Use humor to reinterpret the prompt, focusing on the playful dynamics between the boy and the delivery worker.

Show the delivery worker's influence on the boy through shared experiences, like teaching him how to navigate the city streets or sharing a meal from his culture.\n  - Reveal characters' perspectives on fate and family through their interactions and reflections. For instance, the boy might question, \"Do you think we're stuck with the life we're given?\" to which the worker responds with a story about his own family's choices and sacrifices.\n  - Use distinct, colloquial dialogue to reveal characters' personalities. Have the delivery worker use phrases like, \"You gotta hustle to make it in this world,\" showcasing his determined and street-smart nature.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ vivid, sensory language to create an immersive and atmospheric setting. Describe scenes with details like \"the rumble of the delivery truck echoed through the narrow alley\" and \"the smell of fresh bread wafted from the bakery as they passed by.\"\n  - Use straightforward and conversational language to convey complex themes through dialogue. For example, in a conversation about the weight of history, the worker might say, \"History's just a bunch of stories, kid. It's up to us to write our own.\"\n  - Incorporate colloquial language and slang to create an authentic and immersive atmosphere. Use phrases like \"What's the scoop, kid?\" and \"You gotta keep your head up,\" reflecting the everyday speech of the delivery worker and enhancing the realism of the setting.\n</story_rules>",
