    "<thinking>  \nThe Author Writing Sheet provides a detailed insight into the author's storytelling style, emphasizing intimate, character-driven narratives, humor amidst tension, and internal conflicts. The author creatively blends myth and legend with personal connections, using descriptive language to create immersive atmospheres. The Writing Prompt involves Annatar and Celebrimbor, focusing on themes of devotion, unspoken truths, and the interplay of light and shadow. To align the Story Rules with both the Author Writing Sheet and the Writing Prompt, the rules will need to emphasize emotional intimacy, internal conflict, and mythological elements, while using rich, descriptive language to create a serene yet tension-filled atmosphere.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative to focus on the intimate, character-driven moments between Annatar and Celebrimbor. Highlight their shared rituals, such as the act of weaving jewels into hair, to emphasize emotional intimacy. For example, describe how Annatar's fingers linger on Celebrimbor's hair, each touch a silent communication of their bond.\n  - Incorporate humor and camaraderie amidst the underlying tension. Include a scene where Celebrimbor playfully teases Annatar about his choice of jewels, perhaps saying, \"Are you sure these aren't meant to blind me with their brilliance, rather than adorn me?\" to lighten the mood.\n  - Center the plot around Annatar's internal conflict, exploring the tension between his outward devotion and the shadow of unspoken truths. Illustrate this by having Annatar reflect on his dual nature, pondering, \"Could he truly be the radiant being Celebrimbor saw, or was the shadow always lurking beneath?\"\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Reimagine the prompt by focusing on storytelling as a means of connection.

Use playful banter during the jewel-weaving ritual to add a layer of affection, such as Annatar joking, \"If I weave too many jewels, you might outshine the stars themselves.\"\n  - Integrate elements of myth and legend to create a layered narrative that explores identity and deception. Weave in Annatar's past as Mairon, reflecting on how his former self contrasts with the being he presents to Celebrimbor, adding depth to the theme of hidden darkness.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through their interactions and shared rituals, revealing deeper layers of their personalities. Use the jewel-weaving as a ritual that deepens their connection, with Annatar's gentle touch and Celebrimbor's serene acceptance highlighting their bond.\n  - Use intimate dialogue and subtle actions to enhance their emotional connection. Include moments where Celebrimbor leans into Annatar's touch, whispering, \"Your hands speak what your lips do not,\" to convey their closeness.\n  - Reveal characters' vulnerabilities and desires through detailed introspection. Have Annatar internally debate his true intentions, longing for the purity Celebrimbor sees in him, thinking, \"For this moment, let me be the light you believe I am.\"\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use descriptive language to create a warm, serene, and immersive atmosphere. Describe the chamber as \"bathed in golden light, where shadows danced like whispers of forgotten dreams,\" to set the scene.\n  - Employ rich, descriptive language and metaphor to create vivid imagery. Describe the jewels as \"tiny stars woven into a constellation of promises,\" enhancing the visual and emotional impact.\n  - Use playful and affectionate language to enhance character relationships.
