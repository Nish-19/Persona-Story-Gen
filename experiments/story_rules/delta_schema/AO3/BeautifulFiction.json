Begin with Arthur's shock and demand for answers, leading to a gradual revelation of the truth behind the scars. Use this revelation to explore themes of trust and vulnerability, culminating in a changed bond between Arthur and Merlin. For example, Arthur might initially react with anger and disbelief, but as Merlin shares the story behind each scar, Arthur's perspective shifts from judgment to empathy.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Integrate the scars as a metaphor for Merlin's sacrifices and the hidden burdens of his magical role. Use the scars to symbolize the cost of Merlin's loyalty and the unseen battles he has fought for Arthur and Camelot.

Use vivid imagery to describe the scars, such as \"jagged lines etched across his skin, each a testament to battles fought in silence.\" Use dialogue to convey the evolving emotional stakes, with Arthur's questions and Merlin's revelations driving the narrative forward. For example, Arthur might say, \"Why didn't you tell me?\" to which Merlin responds, \"Because some battles are fought alone,\" illustrating the depth of their bond and the weight of Merlin's secrets.\n</story_rules>",
