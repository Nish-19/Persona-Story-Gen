    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt involves a daily routine between Will Solace and Nico di Angelo, which is humorously disrupted by a suggestion from Nico. The author's style emphasizes humor, emotional connections, and playful interactions, which will be crucial in crafting the Story Rules. I will ensure the rules incorporate these elements while tailoring them to the narrative potential of the prompt.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the plot around humorous and lighthearted interactions between Will and Nico. Begin the story with a typical morning scene filled with laughter and playful banter, such as Will teasing Nico about his bedhead or Nico joking about Will's morning breath.\n  - Focus the narrative on intimate, personal moments that highlight the emotional connection between the characters. For example, describe a cozy morning scene where they share a quiet moment over coffee, emphasizing their comfort and familiarity with each other.\n  - Introduce a pivotal moment where Nico suggests a change to their routine. This suggestion should be unexpected yet fitting within their dynamic, such as proposing they start a morning dance-off to get out of bed, leading to a humorous and chaotic scene.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use humor and irony to reinterpret the prompt, focusing on exaggerated character reactions. For instance, when Nico suggests the change, have Will respond with mock horror, saying something like, \"You want me to dance before coffee? Are you trying to kill me?\"\n  - Employ a stream-of-consciousness style to convey Will's internal thoughts as he processes Nico's suggestion. Capture his initial confusion and eventual amusement, reflecting on how this change might affect their mornings.\n  - Incorporate modern cultural references to add a light-hearted tone. For example, have Nico reference a popular dance trend or meme as part of his suggestion, adding a layer of contemporary humor to the narrative.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through playful banter and mutual teasing. Highlight their relationship dynamics by showing how they communicate through jokes and light-hearted insults, such as Nico calling Will a \"morning zombie\" and Will retorting with a playful jab about Nico's \"vampire-like\" sleep habits.\n  - Use their interactions and dialogue to create a sense of familiarity and depth. Describe how they move around their shared space with ease, finishing each other's sentences or anticipating each other's needs, like Will automatically handing Nico his favorite mug.\n  - Highlight subtle changes in their routine to emphasize the impact of Nico's suggestion. Show how this new element brings them closer, perhaps by illustrating how they laugh more or find new ways to connect through the shared experience.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ playful and informal language to maintain a comedic tone. Use phrases that capture the light-hearted nature of their mornings, such as \"Will groaned dramatically, flopping back onto the pillows like a defeated hero.\"\n  - Use vivid and sensory language to create an immersive atmosphere. Describe the morning light filtering through the curtains, the warmth of their shared bed, and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee to set the scene.\n  - Use repetitive and reflective language to emphasize Will's initial resistance and eventual acceptance of the change. Have him internally repeat phrases like, \"This is madness,\" followed by, \"But maybe madness is exactly what we need,\" to capture his evolving perspective.\n</story_rules>",
