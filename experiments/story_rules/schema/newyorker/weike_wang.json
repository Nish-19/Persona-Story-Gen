    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories. The author's style involves using everyday challenges as a backdrop for deeper themes, introducing conflict through systemic issues, and leaving resolutions ambiguous. Creativity is expressed through humor, irony, and unconventional pairings, while character and setting development focus on detailed interactions and immersive settings. Language use is descriptive, humorous, and conversational, with complex ideas conveyed simply.\n\nFor the Writing Prompt, the story involves a writer trying to please his mother with a children's story, facing her sharp critique and demand for a happy ending. The rules will need to incorporate the author's style of using systemic challenges (the mother's critique) as conflict, blending humor and irony, and developing characters through dialogue. The setting should be immersive, and the language should be vivid and engaging.\n\nI will create Story Rules that guide the language model to structure the plot around the writer's challenge with his mother's critique, use humor and irony to explore the situation, develop characters through their interactions, and employ descriptive language to create vivid imagery. The rules will ensure the narrative aligns with the prompt while reflecting the author's unique style.  \n</thinking>  \n\n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Structure the narrative around the writer's challenge of crafting a children's story to please his mother, using this as a backdrop to explore themes of familial expectations and creative pressure. For example, depict the writer's struggle with his mother's critique as a systemic challenge, akin to the untenured professors dealing with construction chaos.\n  - Introduce conflict through the mother's sharp critique and her insistence on a happy ending, rather than personal antagonism between the writer and his mother. Highlight how her demands create a systemic challenge for the writer, similar to the administration's indifference in the author's previous work.\n  - Conclude the story with an ambiguous resolution, reflecting the complexity of the writer's situation. For instance, the writer might accept his mother's critique without fully resolving his creative struggle, mirroring the professors' acceptance of their unresolved issues.\n\n- **Creativity**:  \n  - Blend humor and irony to reinterpret the writer's mundane task of crafting a children's story. Use humorous elements, such as the writer's exaggerated attempts to create a happy ending, to highlight the absurdity of the situation, similar to the contractor's typos in the author's previous story.\n  - Explore complex ideas through unconventional pairings, such as the writer's creative process juxtaposed with his mother's practical critiques. This can be akin to the playful rivalry between a writer and a coder, where language and logic are creatively explored.\n  - Integrate imaginative elements into the realistic setting of the writer's interactions with his mother to enhance thematic depth. For example, the writer might imagine fantastical scenarios for his story, adding a layer of creativity to the narrative.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:  \n  - Develop characters through detailed interactions and dialogues that reveal their personalities and relationships. Use the writer's conversations with his mother to showcase their dynamic, similar to the debates between the writer and coder in the author's previous work.\n  - Depict the setting with attention to detail, enhancing the narrative's immersion. Describe the writer's workspace and the atmosphere during his interactions with his mother, creating a vivid backdrop for the story, much like the detailed construction chaos in the author's previous story.\n  - Subtly weave emotional arcs into the narrative, reflecting the writer's internal struggle with his creative process and his desire to please his mother. Show his journey from frustration to a nuanced acceptance of his mother's critique.\n\n- **Language Use**:  \n  - Employ descriptive language to create vivid imagery and enhance the narrative's atmosphere. Use phrases that evoke strong visual images, such as describing the writer's cluttered desk as a \"sea of crumpled drafts and ink-stained fingers,\" similar to the neon-blue film imagery in the author's previous work.\n  - Use dialogue effectively to develop character relationships and advance the plot. The writer's exchanges with his mother should reveal their relationship dynamics and drive the narrative forward, akin to the playful banter in the author's previous story.\n  - Weave humor and irony into the narrative to highlight the absurdities of the writer's situation. Depict the mother's critique with a humorous tone, adding an ironic layer to the narrative, similar to the contractor's incompetence in the author's previous work.\n  - Maintain a conversational tone to engage the reader and create a relatable narrative voice. The writer's internal monologue and interactions with his mother should be informal and engaging, reflecting the author's style.\n  - Convey complex ideas through simple, clear language, making them accessible to the reader. Present the writer's creative challenges and his mother's expectations in straightforward terms, allowing the reader to easily grasp the underlying themes.  \n</story_rules>"
