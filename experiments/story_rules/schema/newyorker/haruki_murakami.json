    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt involves a protagonist encountering an old college friend and noticing changes in their seemingly perfect persona. This scenario offers opportunities for introspection, gradual conflict emergence, and open-ended resolution, all of which are key elements in the author's style.\n\n**Plot**: The author uses gradual build-up and introspection, often leaving resolutions open-ended. For this prompt, the protagonist's initial admiration for the friend should gradually shift to a realization of their flaws, driven by reflective observations. The story should conclude ambiguously, leaving the protagonist pondering the friend's transformation.\n\n**Creativity**: The author blends fantasy and reality, using mundane activities as metaphors. In this story, the protagonist's observations could be metaphorically linked to a mundane activity, such as sipping coffee, which becomes a lens for deeper reflection on the friend's changes.\n\n**Development (Character and Setting)**: The author develops characters through introspection and uses settings to reflect emotional states. The setting, perhaps a familiar college caf\u00e9, should evoke nostalgia and highlight the protagonist's internal conflict as they reconcile past perceptions with present realities.\n\n**Language Use**: The author employs vivid imagery, metaphorical language, and a reflective tone. The narrative should be first-person, using sensory details to immerse the reader in the protagonist's observations and internal dialogue.\n\nWith these insights, I will craft Story Rules that guide the narrative to reflect the author's style while aligning with the Writing Prompt.  \n</thinking>  \n\n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Begin the story with the protagonist encountering their old college friend in a familiar setting, such as a caf\u00e9. Use a gradual build-up to reveal the friend's imperfections, starting with subtle observations that grow more pronounced. For example, describe how the friend's laughter, once genuine, now seems forced, or how their confident posture now appears strained.\n  - Integrate introspective moments where the protagonist reflects on their past admiration for the friend, using these reflections to drive the plot forward. For instance, as the protagonist sips their coffee, they might recall a specific college memory that contrasts sharply with the friend's current demeanor.\n  - Conclude the story with an open-ended resolution, leaving the protagonist contemplating the changes in their friend. Avoid providing a definitive answer to what caused the transformation, instead allowing the protagonist to ponder the complexities of identity and change.\n\n- **Creativity**:  \n  - Use the setting of the caf\u00e9 as a metaphor for the protagonist's internal journey. The act of stirring a cup of coffee could symbolize the protagonist's attempt to reconcile their past perceptions with the present reality, adding layers of meaning to the narrative.\n  - Infuse the narrative with surreal elements that blur the line between reality and imagination. For example, the protagonist might imagine the steam from their coffee forming shapes that reflect their friend's changing persona, enhancing the story's thematic depth.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:  \n  - Develop the protagonist through introspective inner monologues that reveal their emotional state and internal conflicts. As they observe their friend, their thoughts should oscillate between nostalgia and disillusionment, providing insight into their character.\n  - Use the caf\u00e9 setting to reflect the protagonist's emotional journey. Describe the ambiance in detail, such as the familiar aroma of coffee and the chatter of students, to evoke a sense of nostalgia and highlight the protagonist's internal struggle.\n\n- **Language Use**:  \n  - Employ vivid and sensory imagery to create an immersive atmosphere. Describe the caf\u00e9 in rich detail, such as \"The aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint scent of old textbooks, wrapping around me like a comforting blanket of memories.\"\n  - Use a reflective and introspective tone to explore themes of change and identity. The protagonist's internal dialogue should capture their sense of loss and curiosity, such as \"I watched him from across the room, wondering if the cracks I saw were always there, hidden beneath the surface of my admiration.\"\n  - Incorporate metaphorical language to convey complex emotions. For example, describe the friend's smile as \"a mask that slipped with every sip of his drink, revealing the shadows beneath.\"\n  - Utilize a first-person narrative perspective to provide an intimate view of the protagonist's experiences, allowing readers to connect deeply with their observations and reflections.  \n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt involves a mysterious, wedge-shaped house between train lines, suggesting themes of mystery, isolation, and perhaps supernatural elements. The author\u2019s style includes gradual conflict build-up, introspective narratives, open-ended resolutions, and magical realism, which can be effectively applied to this prompt. I will create rules that incorporate these elements, ensuring they are actionable and detailed, with examples inspired by the Author Writing Sheet.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a gradual introduction to the wedge-shaped house, focusing on the protagonist's initial fascination with its unique architecture and low rent. Allow the conflict to emerge naturally as the protagonist and their partner experience strange occurrences, such as inexplicable noises or objects moving on their own, mirroring the gradual tension build-up seen in the author's work.\n  - Use a reflective narrative style where the protagonist frequently introspects about their decision to move into the house and the impact of the environment on their relationship. For instance, have the protagonist ponder, \"Did the house choose us, or did we choose it?\" to explore their growing unease.\n  - Conclude the story with an open-ended resolution, leaving the reader to question the true nature of the Triangle Zone. Perhaps the protagonist decides to stay despite the mysteries, or they leave, but the house's secrets remain unresolved, echoing the author's tendency for open-ended conclusions.\n  - Integrate elements of magical realism by blurring the lines between reality and imagination. For example, describe the trains as \"metallic serpents\" that seem to whisper secrets as they pass, enhancing the plot's thematic depth.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Blend elements of fantasy and reality by introducing a mysterious character or entity that seems to inhabit the house, much like the ice man. This character could be a spectral figure that only appears in reflections or shadows, exploring themes of identity and belonging.\n  - Use mundane activities, such as the couple's attempts to soundproof the house, as metaphors for deeper existential reflections. For instance, the act of sealing windows could symbolize their attempt to shut out external chaos and internal doubts.\n  - Infuse the narrative with surreal and imaginative elements, such as describing the house's interior as \"a labyrinth of angles and echoes,\" to create a distinctive narrative voice that challenges the boundaries between the ordinary and the extraordinary.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the setting to reflect and enhance the emotional states of the characters. The wedge-shaped house should mirror the couple's growing sense of entrapment and isolation, with its narrow corridors and sharp angles symbolizing their emotional distance.\n  - Use introspective and reflective inner monologues to develop characters. The protagonist might reflect on their partner's changing demeanor, thinking, \"The house has wedged itself between us, just as it stands between the tracks.\"\n  - Create multidimensional characters by juxtaposing their actions with their internal conflicts. For example, the protagonist might insist on staying in the house despite their fears, revealing a conflict between curiosity and self-preservation.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ vivid and sensory imagery to create an immersive atmosphere. Describe the constant rumble of trains as \"a relentless heartbeat that pulses through the walls,\" immersing the reader in the setting.\n  - Use a reflective and introspective tone to explore themes of solitude and existential contemplation. The protagonist might muse, \"In the Triangle Zone, time folds in on itself, and we are caught in its crease.\"\n  - Incorporate metaphorical language to convey complex emotions. For instance, describe the house as \"a puzzle with missing pieces,\" symbolizing the couple's search for understanding.\n  - Utilize a first-person narrative perspective to provide an intimate view of the protagonist's experiences, allowing readers to connect closely with their thoughts and emotions as they navigate the mysteries of the Triangle Zone.\n</story_rules>"
