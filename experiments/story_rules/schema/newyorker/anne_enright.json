    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt involves a tense, life-threatening situation aboard a malfunctioning plane, where a woman and a teenage boy connect in their final moments. This scenario offers rich potential for introspection, metaphorical exploration, and vivid imagery, all of which are key elements in the author's style.\n\n**Plot**: The author uses central metaphors and internal realizations to drive narratives. For this prompt, the malfunctioning plane can symbolize life's unpredictability and the characters' internal struggles. The resolution should focus on the internal realizations of the characters as they face mortality.\n\n**Creativity**: The author blends the mundane with the surreal and uses symbols creatively. The surreal experience of freefall can be used to explore deeper themes of connection and acceptance. The ridiculous hat worn by the boy can serve as a symbol of innocence or defiance against fear.\n\n**Development (Character and Setting)**: Characters are introspective and settings reflect their internal states. The woman and the boy should be developed as introspective characters, each facing personal crises. The setting of the plane should mirror their emotional turbulence and eventual calm.\n\n**Language Use**: The author employs rich, descriptive language and a reflective tone. The narrative should include vivid imagery of the plane and introspective monologues that reveal the characters' thoughts and realizations. Metaphors and symbolism should be prevalent, enhancing the narrative's depth.\n\nUsing these insights, I will craft Story Rules that guide the language model in creating a story that aligns with the Writing Prompt while reflecting the author's unique style.  \n</thinking>  \n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative around the central metaphor of the malfunctioning plane, symbolizing life's unpredictability and the characters' internal struggles. For example, describe how the plane's descent mirrors the woman's feelings of losing control in her life.\n  - Explore themes of change and introspection through the characters' experiences. As the woman locks eyes with the boy, have her reflect on her past decisions and relationships, realizing what truly matters in her final moments.\n  - Focus the resolution on internal realizations rather than external actions. Conclude with the woman finding peace in her acceptance of mortality and the unexpected connection with the boy, rather than the outcome of the plane's descent.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Blend the mundane with the surreal by juxtaposing the ordinary setting of a plane with the surreal experience of freefall. Use the boy's ridiculous hat as a symbol of innocence or defiance, adding depth to their connection.\n  - Use symbols to reinterpret the prompt in unexpected ways. For instance, the plane's malfunction can symbolize the woman's internal chaos, while the boy's calm demeanor represents acceptance.\n  - Integrate imaginative elements into the setting, such as describing the plane's interior as a distorted, dreamlike space that reflects the characters' emotional states.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop introspective characters caught in personal crises. The woman should be portrayed as someone grappling with regrets, while the boy, despite his youth, exhibits a surprising maturity and calmness.\n  - Describe the setting of the plane vividly, using it to reflect the characters' internal states. For example, the flickering cabin lights can symbolize the woman's wavering hope.\n  - Ensure characters experience moments of personal revelation or growth. The woman's interaction with the boy should lead to a moment of clarity and connection, offering her a sense of peace.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ rich, descriptive language to create vivid imagery of the plane and the characters' experiences. Use phrases like \"the cabin lights flickered like distant stars\" to enhance the surreal atmosphere.\n  - Use a reflective tone to convey the characters' introspection. Include internal monologues where the woman contemplates her life and the unexpected bond with the boy.\n  - Incorporate metaphor and symbolism throughout the narrative. The plane's descent can symbolize the woman's internal journey, while the boy's hat can represent resilience or innocence.\n  - Include introspective dialogues or monologues to reveal inner thoughts. Have the woman internally voice her fears and realizations, providing depth to her character and the narrative.\n</story_rules>",
