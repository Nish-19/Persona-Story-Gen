    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories. The author's style involves young protagonists facing adult responsibilities, conflicts arising from societal pressures, and resolutions with emotional introspection. Creativity is expressed through cultural elements, internal emotional landscapes, and imaginative symbolism. Characters are developed through internal monologues and familial bonds, with settings reflecting emotional states. Language use includes vivid sensory imagery, introspective language, cultural references, and dialogue revealing relationships.\n\nFor the Writing Prompt, the story will focus on Chichi, a young protagonist dealing with adult responsibilities and societal pressures after choosing a modern childbirth method.
