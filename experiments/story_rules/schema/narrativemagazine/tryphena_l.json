    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt involves themes of tradition, modernity, tragedy, and societal judgment, which will be integrated into the Story Rules.\n\n**Plot**: The author structures stories around central conflicts and often leaves resolutions open-ended. For this prompt, the central conflict will be Chichi's defiance of tradition and the resulting tragedy. The plot should incorporate vivid imagery and cultural elements to enhance emotional depth and context.\n\n**Creativity**: The author blends realism with surreal imagery and infuses existential undertones. The story should creatively explore the clash between tradition and modernity, using surreal elements to reflect Chichi's internal struggle and the community's reaction.\n\n**Development (Character and Setting)**: Characters are developed through internal monologues and emotional arcs, with settings reflecting emotional states. Chichi and her mother should be portrayed with depth, revealing their emotional struggles and resilience. The village setting should underscore the themes of tradition and societal pressure.\n\n**Language Use**: The author uses vivid imagery, introspective tone, metaphorical language, varied sentence structures, and dialogue to convey emotions and relationships. The story should employ these techniques to create an immersive atmosphere and explore the complex emotions of Chichi and her mother.\n\nWith these insights, I will craft detailed Story Rules that guide the narrative to align with the Writing Prompt while reflecting the author's unique style.  \n</thinking>  \n\n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Structure the narrative around Chichi's internal and external conflict with the village's traditional norms. Begin with her decision to use a modern childbirth method, highlighting the tension between her and the community.  \n  - Use vivid imagery to depict the tragedy that strikes, such as describing the moment with sensory details: \"The air was thick with the scent of incense and whispers, as if the walls themselves were holding their breath.\"  \n  - Integrate cultural elements, such as traditional rituals or community gatherings, to enrich the narrative context and highlight the societal pressure Chichi faces.  \n  - Leave the resolution open-ended, allowing for ambiguity and reflection. For example, end with Chichi and her mother standing at the village's edge, contemplating their next move as the sun sets, casting long shadows that blur the path ahead.\n\n- **Creativity**:  \n  - Blend realism with surreal imagery to enhance emotional depth. For instance, describe Chichi's perception of the village's judgment as a tangible force: \"The whispers curled around her like smoke, suffocating yet intangible.\"  \n  - Infuse the narrative with existential undertones by exploring Chichi's internal monologue about her place in the world and the meaning of her choices.  \n  - Use imaginative elements to explore the complex dynamics between Chichi and her mother, such as a dream sequence where they navigate a labyrinth of traditions, each turn echoing with ancestral voices.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:  \n  - Develop Chichi and her mother through internal monologues that reveal their emotional struggles and desires. For example, Chichi might reflect, \"I wanted to bring life into this world on my terms, but now I carry the weight of a thousand eyes.\"  \n  - Create an immersive village setting using sensory details that reflect the characters' emotional states. Describe the village as \"a tapestry of woven traditions, each thread pulling tighter around those who dared to stray.\"  \n  - Craft emotional arcs by juxtaposing moments of hope and despair, highlighting the characters' resilience. Show Chichi finding a moment of solace in her mother's embrace, only to be reminded of the community's scorn.\n\n- **Language Use**:  \n  - Use vivid and sensory imagery to create an immersive atmosphere. Describe the village's reaction to Chichi's choice with metaphorical language: \"Their eyes were like stones, cold and unyielding, casting shadows that stretched across her path.\"  \n  - Employ a reflective and introspective tone to explore Chichi's complex emotions, such as her thoughts on tradition versus modernity.  \n  - Utilize varied sentence structures to enhance narrative pacing and emotional impact. Use short sentences to convey urgency during the tragedy and longer sentences for introspective moments.  \n  - Incorporate dialogue to reveal character relationships and dynamics. For example, a conversation between Chichi and her mother might reveal their shared grief and determination: \"\u2018We will find our way,\u2019 her mother whispered, her voice a fragile thread in the silence.\"  \n</story_rules>",
