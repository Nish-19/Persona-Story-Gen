    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt suggests a mystery or crime narrative with a potentially supernatural or fantastical twist, given the author's style. The rules will incorporate unexpected elements, humor, and tension, as well as vivid character interactions and settings that enhance the narrative's tone. The language will be witty and descriptive, maintaining a conversational tone to engage the reader.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Introduce the conflict through an unexpected or supernatural element related to the autopsy. For example, reveal that the stab victim has inhuman traits, such as unusual blood or a hidden magical artifact within the body, which complicates the investigation.\n  - Use dialogue to drive the plot forward. Create a scene where the detective discusses the bizarre nature of the wounds with a forensic expert, using their conversation to reveal key plot points and advance the investigation.\n  - Resolve the narrative with a blend of humor and tension. Conclude with a scene where the detective humorously negotiates with a supernatural entity responsible for the crime, leaving the resolution open-ended or with a twist, such as the entity offering the detective a cryptic warning about future events.\n  - Gradually reveal information to maintain suspense. Introduce clues about the victim's identity and the nature of the weapons used, slowly uncovering a larger conspiracy or supernatural involvement.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Blend fantasy and reality by incorporating mythical elements into the crime scene. For instance, suggest that the weapons used were enchanted or belonged to different mythical creatures, each leaving a distinct magical residue.\n  - Reinterpret traditional crime investigation elements with a modern twist. Present the detective using unconventional methods, such as consulting a magical artifact or a mythical creature, to gather information.\n  - Incorporate humor into the investigation. Include a scene where the detective humorously interacts with a reluctant witness, such as a talking animal or a sarcastic ghost, to gather clues.\n  - Integrate unexpected elements to subvert genre conventions. Introduce a character who appears to be a suspect but is actually a supernatural ally, helping the detective navigate the mystical aspects of the case.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through their interactions and dialogue. Showcase the detective's personality and skills through witty exchanges with colleagues and supernatural beings, revealing their motivations and conflicts.\n  - Create multidimensional characters with conflicting motivations. Portray the detective as torn between solving the case and dealing with the supernatural elements, while other characters, like a rival investigator or a mystical guide, have their own agendas.\n  - Establish settings that enhance the narrative's tone. Set key scenes in locations that juxtapose the ordinary with the extraordinary, such as a mundane police station with a hidden magical library or a crime scene in a seemingly normal alley that reveals a portal to another realm.\n  - Use character transformations to reflect internal changes. As the detective uncovers more about the supernatural world, show their growing understanding and adaptability through subtle changes in behavior or appearance.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ witty and humorous dialogue to enhance character interactions. Craft exchanges where the detective uses sarcasm or dry humor to cope with the bizarre nature of the case, engaging the reader and adding levity to tense situations.\n  - Use descriptive language to create vivid imagery. Describe the crime scene with rich details, such as \"a tapestry of shadows cast by flickering streetlights\" or \"the metallic scent of blood mingling with the crisp night air,\" to immerse the reader in the setting.\n  - Maintain a conversational tone to engage the reader. Use informal dialogue and narrative asides to create a relatable and dynamic storytelling style, drawing the reader into the detective's world.\n  - Incorporate rhetorical questions to provoke thought and reflection. Have the detective ponder questions like, \"What kind of creature leaves a trail of enchanted blades?\" to challenge assumptions and deepen the mystery.\n  - Use varied sentence structures to maintain narrative flow. Mix short, punchy sentences with longer, descriptive passages to keep the pacing dynamic and the reader engaged throughout the story.\n</story_rules>",

    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt involves a supernatural conflict with a hex, requiring a blend of humor and tension, gradual revelation of information, and an open-ended or twist resolution. The author\u2019s style includes blending fantasy with reality, using humor, and subverting genre conventions, which will be crucial in crafting the narrative. Characters should be developed through dialogue and interactions, with settings that enhance the tone. Language should be witty, descriptive, and conversational, with varied sentence structures. I will incorporate these elements into the Story Rules, ensuring they are actionable and tailored to the Writing Prompt.  \n</thinking>  \n\n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Introduce the conflict through the unexpected supernatural element of the hex. Begin with the friends' casual disrespect of the old woman, leading to her casting the hex. Use dialogue to reveal the hex's nature, such as a chilling warning from the hag: \"You shall melt under the sun's gaze until you learn respect.\"\n  - Drive the plot forward through dialogue among the friends as they realize the severity of their situation. Use conversations to explore their panic and plan to find the hag, such as debating whether to split up or stay together.\n  - Maintain suspense by gradually revealing the effects of the hex. Start with minor symptoms like excessive sweating, escalating to more severe signs of melting. Use a humorous yet tense tone, such as a character joking, \"I always wanted to be more fluid, but not like this!\"\n  - Resolve the narrative with a blend of humor and tension. Perhaps the hag agrees to lift the hex if they perform a series of humorous tasks, leaving the resolution open-ended with a twist: the friends are left wondering if the hag's conditions were just another trick.\n  - End with an open-ended resolution or twist, such as the friends discovering they have gained a newfound respect for the elderly, but one of them still feels a lingering warmth, hinting the hex might not be fully lifted.\n\n- **Creativity**:  \n  - Blend fantasy and reality by setting the story in a vibrant, bustling foreign market where the extraordinary event of the hex feels both outlandish and plausible. Use the market's chaotic energy to mirror the friends' internal turmoil.\n  - Incorporate humor into the fantastical scenario by having the friends encounter bizarre characters or situations as they search for the hag, such as a street performer who claims to know the hag but demands a ridiculous fee for information.\n  - Subvert genre conventions by having the hag be unexpectedly kind or helpful once the friends find her, challenging their assumptions about her malevolence. Perhaps she offers them tea and a lesson in humility instead of immediate relief.\n  - Use imaginative dialogue to highlight character dynamics, such as a friend who remains skeptical of the hex, providing comic relief with lines like, \"Melting? Please, I\u2019m just sweating out last night's bad decisions.\"\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:  \n  - Develop characters through their interactions and dialogue. Show their personalities and relationships through their reactions to the hex, such as a leader emerging among them or old tensions resurfacing under stress.\n  - Create multidimensional characters with conflicting motivations. For example, one friend might be more concerned with documenting the experience for social media, while another is focused on survival.\n  - Establish settings that enhance the narrative's tone. Use the foreign market's vibrant colors and sounds to create a sense of urgency and disorientation, reflecting the friends' predicament.\n  - Contrast mundane settings with extraordinary events. The friends might initially dismiss the hag's warning in a sunny, picturesque plaza, only to realize the gravity of their situation as they start to melt in the same idyllic setting.\n\n- **Language Use**:  \n  - Employ witty and humorous dialogue to enhance character interactions. Use banter among the friends to lighten the mood, even as they face a dire situation.\n  - Use descriptive language to create vivid imagery of the melting process, such as \"Their skin shimmered like wax under a flame, droplets forming and sliding down like tears.\"\n  - Maintain a conversational tone to engage the reader, using informal dialogue and internal monologues to make the characters relatable.\n  - Incorporate rhetorical questions to provoke thought and reflection, such as a character wondering, \"Is this what it takes to learn respect, or is there another lesson hidden in the heat?\"\n  - Use varied sentence structures to maintain narrative flow, mixing short, punchy sentences for action scenes with longer, descriptive passages to set the scene and mood.  \n</story_rules>"
