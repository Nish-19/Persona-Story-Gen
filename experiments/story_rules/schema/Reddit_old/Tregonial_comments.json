    "<thinking>  \nTo generate the Story Rules, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet for each category\u2014Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. I will extract the unique storytelling elements and adapt them to the Writing Prompt about Blake getting kicked out of the orphanage. The rules will be actionable, detailed, and include examples inspired by the Evidence provided.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Juxtapose contrasting elements to create tension and intrigue. For example, contrast Blake's bleak situation of being kicked out of the orphanage with moments of unexpected kindness or beauty in the city. Describe how the smoggy, harsh streets of Indianapolis clash with a serene park he stumbles upon, highlighting the stark differences in his new reality.\n  - Use a dual narrative structure to provide different perspectives. Alternate between Blake's perspective and that of a social worker or another character who has a vested interest in his well-being. This can offer a comprehensive view of Blake's struggles and the societal challenges he faces.\n  - Resolve conflicts through dialogue and mutual understanding rather than violence. For instance, when Blake encounters a potential threat or conflict, have him engage in a conversation that reveals mutual struggles or shared humanity, leading to a peaceful resolution.\n  - Incorporate a twist or revelation that recontextualizes the story. Introduce a twist where Blake discovers a hidden talent or a piece of his past that changes his outlook and future prospects, such as finding out he has a family member in the city who has been looking for him.\n  - Explore themes of redemption and second chances. Show Blake's journey as he tries to rebuild his life, seeking redemption for past mistakes and finding opportunities for a fresh start, such as getting a job or reconnecting with someone from his past.\n\n- **Creativity**:  \n  - Blend genres to create unique and imaginative settings. Combine elements of urban drama with hints of magical realism. For example, describe a scene where Blake encounters a street performer whose tricks seem almost magical, adding a layer of wonder to the gritty urban setting.\n  - Reinterpret common tropes in unconventional ways. Instead of the typical \"down-and-out\" narrative, have Blake use his resourcefulness and wit to navigate his new life, subverting the expectation of a purely tragic story.\n  - Integrate elements of cosmic horror and eldritch themes subtly. Perhaps Blake has recurring dreams or visions that hint at something otherworldly, adding a layer of mystery and depth to his character.\n  - Include fantastical elements that challenge the characters' understanding of their world. For instance, Blake might find an old, seemingly magical artifact that gives him hope or guidance, challenging his perception of reality.\n  - Use humor to subvert expectations in otherwise serious or dark settings. Include moments of levity, such as Blake's interactions with quirky street vendors or humorous misunderstandings, to lighten the mood and add depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:  \n  - Develop characters through their interactions and relationships with others. Show Blake forming bonds with other marginalized individuals in the city, such as a homeless veteran or a kind-hearted shop owner, and how these relationships help him grow.\n  - Create immersive settings that reflect the themes and tone of the story. Describe the gritty, smog-filled streets of Indianapolis in detail, contrasting them with pockets of beauty and hope, such as a community garden or a bustling market.\n  - Include detailed backstories that inform characters' motivations and actions. Reveal Blake's past through flashbacks or conversations, explaining why he was in the orphanage and what drives him now.\n  - Use setting descriptions to enhance the emotional impact of the narrative. For example, describe the orphanage's cold, institutional feel versus the chaotic but vibrant streets of the city, emphasizing Blake's emotional journey.\n  - Develop characters through their internal conflicts and personal growth. Show Blake grappling with feelings of abandonment and uncertainty, and his gradual acceptance and determination to build a new life.\n\n- **Language Use**:  \n  - Employ vivid, sensory imagery to create an immersive atmosphere. Describe the smoggy air, the sounds of the city, and the feel of the worn clothes Blake wears, creating a vivid picture of his environment.\n  - Use dialogue to reveal character traits and advance the plot. Have Blake's conversations with others reveal his resilience, wit, and underlying vulnerability, moving the story forward through these interactions.\n  - Use a conversational tone to make the narrative more engaging. Write Blake's internal monologue and dialogue in a casual, relatable manner, making his character more accessible and engaging.\n  - Employ rhetorical questions to provoke thought and emphasize themes. Include questions in Blake's internal monologue, such as \"Why did it have to be this way?\" to highlight his struggles and provoke thought.\n  - Use varied sentence structures to maintain a dynamic and engaging narrative. Mix short, punchy sentences with longer, descriptive ones to create a dynamic flow, especially during action or emotional scenes.\n  - Incorporate internal monologues to provide insight into characters' thoughts and emotions. Show Blake's internal struggles and hopes through his thoughts, giving readers a deeper understanding of his character.\n  - Use descriptive language to enhance the emotional tone of the story. Describe Blake's feelings of despair, hope, and determination with rich, emotive language to draw readers into his journey.\n  - Include humor and wit to lighten the mood in otherwise serious narratives. Add moments of humor, such as Blake's sarcastic thoughts or funny encounters, to balance the serious themes.\n  - Use metaphors and similes to create vivid and relatable imagery.
