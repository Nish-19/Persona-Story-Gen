    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt about the \"White Collar Gang\" and their heist at the National Bank of Emerald City, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet to extract key storytelling elements. The author\u2019s style includes ensemble casts, mysterious elements, societal tensions, and open-ended resolutions. Creativity is marked by blending historical and fantastical elements, reimagining fantasy tropes, and introducing unique societal structures. Character and setting development focus on relationships, immersive settings, and contrasting appearances with internal complexities. Language use involves descriptive language, varied sentence structures, dialogue, figurative language, and a consistent tone. I will tailor these elements to the prompt, ensuring the narrative captures the unique style while addressing the themes of heroism, bureaucracy, and humor inherent in the prompt.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Introduce an ensemble cast of heroes and bank staff, each with distinct motivations and backgrounds.
