    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt involves strangers from different worlds navigating a mysterious labyrinth, which suggests themes of mystery, exploration, and interconnectedness. The author's style includes starting with urgency, intertwining personal stakes with broader conflicts, and maintaining tension. Creativity involves blending fantasy with reality and using unconventional roles. Characters are developed with complex backstories, and settings are immersive. Language use is vivid and sensory, with varied sentence structures and dialogue that reveals character traits. I will incorporate these elements into the Story Rules, ensuring they are actionable and tailored to the Writing Prompt.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Begin the story with a strong sense of urgency by introducing the labyrinth as a place of immediate danger or crisis. For example, open with a character suddenly finding themselves in a dimly lit corridor, hearing distant echoes of footsteps, creating a sense of urgency and disorientation.\n  - Intertwine personal stakes with the broader mystery of the labyrinth. Each character should have a personal reason for wanting to escape or explore the maze, such as a lost memory or a promise to fulfill, which ties into the overarching mystery of why they are there.\n  - Use layered mysteries to drive the narrative. Introduce cryptic symbols or messages within the labyrinth that hint at its purpose and the force behind it, encouraging characters to uncover secrets and hidden motives.\n  - Maintain tension until the end by keeping the true nature of the labyrinth and the force behind it ambiguous, allowing for an open-ended resolution that leaves room for interpretation.\n\n- **Creativity**:  \n  - Blend elements of fantasy and reality by describing the labyrinth as a place where the laws of physics are inconsistent, with rooms that defy logic, such as a library where books float in mid-air or a gallery where paintings change scenes.\n  - Reimagine traditional exploration narratives with unique twists, such as introducing a character who can communicate with the labyrinth itself or a room that reflects a character's deepest fears.\n  - Use unconventional character roles to enhance the narrative. Include characters like a time-traveling historian or a sentient AI, each bringing unique skills and perspectives to the group.\n  - Incorporate elements of suspense and intrigue by having the labyrinth shift and change, creating new paths and closing others, keeping characters and readers guessing about what lies ahead.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:  \n  - Develop characters with complex backstories and motivations. Each character should have a detailed past that influences their actions within the labyrinth, such as a former explorer seeking redemption or a scholar searching for forbidden knowledge.\n  - Create an immersive setting that reflects the story's tone. Describe the labyrinth with vivid details, such as echoing halls, flickering torchlight, and the scent of old parchment, to enhance the mysterious and otherworldly atmosphere.\n  - Use character interactions to reveal deeper themes, such as trust and cooperation. As characters navigate the labyrinth, their interactions should uncover personal secrets and forge alliances or rivalries.\n  - Contrast characters' internal struggles with the external challenges of the labyrinth. For instance, a character's fear of the unknown might be mirrored by the labyrinth's ever-changing nature, forcing them to confront their fears.\n\n- **Language Use**:  \n  - Employ vivid, sensory imagery to create an immersive atmosphere. Use phrases like \"the labyrinth's walls whispered secrets\" or \"the air was thick with the scent of ancient tomes\" to evoke a strong sense of place.\n  - Use varied sentence structures to maintain narrative pace. Alternate between short, tense sentences during moments of action or discovery and longer, reflective passages when characters ponder their situation.\n  - Incorporate dialogue to reveal character traits and advance the plot. Use conversations between characters to highlight their backgrounds and motivations, such as a debate over the best path to take or a confession of why they are truly there.\n  - Use rhetorical devices to enhance thematic depth. Employ foreshadowing and allusion to hint at the labyrinth's true nature and the force behind it, deepening the mystery and suspense.\n  - Align the narrative perspective closely with the protagonist's viewpoint, providing insight into their thoughts and emotions as they navigate the labyrinth, enhancing the reader's connection to their journey.\n</story_rules>",
