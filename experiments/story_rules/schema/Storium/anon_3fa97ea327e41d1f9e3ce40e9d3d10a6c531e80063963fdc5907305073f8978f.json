    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt involves a salvage job in a chaotic trade station setting, suggesting themes of mystery, intrigue, and potential conflict. The author's style includes starting with urgency, using quests, maintaining suspense, blending fantasy with reality, and using vivid imagery and formal language. I will incorporate these elements into the Story Rules, ensuring they are actionable and tailored to the prompt.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a sense of urgency or impending conflict.
