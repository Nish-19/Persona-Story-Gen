    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules for the given Writing Prompt, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet to identify key storytelling elements and techniques. The prompt involves a post-apocalyptic setting with themes of loss, hope, and memory, which align well with the author's style of exploring past and present tensions, internal conflicts, and speculative elements. I will create rules that incorporate these elements, ensuring they are actionable and detailed, with examples inspired by the author's previous works. The rules will be organized into the categories of Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use, each tailored to the prompt's narrative potential.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Structure the narrative around Jonas's internal conflict between accepting the loss of his loved ones and clinging to hope. Use his journey through the graveyard as a metaphor for this struggle, similar to how Mikkel's drawings bridge past and present.  \n  - Introduce speculative elements, such as Jonas encountering surreal visions or echoes of his past, to explore themes of identity and reality. For example, Jonas might see fleeting images of his family in the mist, questioning their reality.  \n  - Employ a non-linear narrative structure, using flashbacks to reveal Jonas's memories of his loved ones, enhancing the story's complexity. These flashbacks should interweave with his present journey, much like Shauna's memories of Jackie.  \n  - Resolve the narrative with Jonas in a state of introspection, leaving the question of his loved ones' fate open-ended. This mirrors the unresolved tension seen in Michael's story about discerning reality from dreams.  \n\n- **Creativity**:  \n  - Blend genres by incorporating speculative fiction elements into the character-driven narrative. For instance, Jonas might find a mysterious artifact in the graveyard that triggers memories or visions, adding a unique twist to his journey.  \n  - Reinterpret the prompt by focusing on Jonas's psychological and emotional dimensions, rather than external action. His internal monologue should reflect his struggle with hope and despair, akin to Michael's internal struggle with meeting his younger self.  \n  - Use metaphorical elements, such as the graveyard symbolizing Jonas's mindscape, to deepen the narrative's thematic resonance. The names on the gravestones could represent different aspects of his identity and past.  \n  - Explore the concept of duality by presenting parallel realities or identities. Jonas might imagine alternate lives where his loved ones survived, enriching the narrative with his internal conflict and desires.  \n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:  \n  - Develop Jonas through his internal conflicts and emotional arcs, focusing on his introspection as he navigates the graveyard. His character should evolve as he confronts memories and hopes.  \n  - Create an immersive setting that reflects Jonas's emotional state and thematic concerns. The graveyard should be described in a way that mirrors his feelings of loss and hope, similar to the nature hike setting reflecting interpersonal conflicts.  \n  - Use Jonas's relationships with his lost loved ones to explore his identity and personal growth. Flashbacks or visions of interactions with his best friend, family, and Martha should highlight his struggle to move forward.  \n  - Contrast Jonas's past and present selves to highlight his development and internal conflicts. His memories of happier times should underscore his current despair and hope.  \n\n- **Language Use**:  \n  - Employ vivid, sensory imagery to create an immersive atmosphere and convey Jonas's emotions. Describe the graveyard's sights, sounds, and smells to reflect his internal state, much like the sensory details in the nature hike story.  \n  - Use introspective and reflective language to explore Jonas's internal thoughts and emotions. His reflections on the names he sees should reveal his hopes and fears, similar to Taissa's introspection about her achievements.  \n  - Use a conversational tone in Jonas's internal monologue to create a realistic and relatable character interaction with himself. This should capture his internal dialogue and emotional tension.  \n  - Employ varied sentence structures to enhance the narrative's pacing and emotional impact. Use short, fragmented sentences to convey Jonas's moments of despair and longer, flowing sentences for his hopeful reflections.  \n  - Use metaphor and symbolism to enrich the narrative's thematic depth. The graveyard itself can serve as a metaphor for Jonas's struggle with identity and memory, much like Mikkel's drawings.  \n</story_rules>",
