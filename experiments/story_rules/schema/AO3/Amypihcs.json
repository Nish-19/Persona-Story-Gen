    "<thinking>  \nThe Author Writing Sheet provides a comprehensive view of the author's storytelling style, emphasizing domestic and relational themes, creative reinterpretations of traditional tropes, intimate character development, and a playful, affectionate use of language. The Writing Prompt involves Dr. Watson returning home to Sherlock Holmes after years apart due to the war, which aligns well with the author's focus on emotional reconciliation, domestic settings, and character relationships.
