    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt \"You traveled 600 years into the future. The future is bad,\" I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet to extract key storytelling elements. The author\u2019s style is characterized by philosophical dilemmas, narrative twists, and the use of conflict to explore existential questions. Creativity is expressed through genre blending, unconventional reinterpretations, and speculative elements. Characters are developed through internal conflicts and philosophical reflections, while settings often reflect broader themes. Language use is marked by a mix of formal and informal diction, effective dialogue, vivid imagery, and varied sentence structures.\n\nFor the Writing Prompt, the story will explore the philosophical implications of a dystopian future, using a central ethical dilemma to drive the plot. The narrative will conclude with a twist that recontextualizes the protagonist's understanding of the future. Characters will be outsiders, misunderstood by the future society, and the setting will metaphorically reflect the protagonist's internal state and the themes of the story. Language will be used to create an immersive and emotionally impactful narrative.\n\nI will now construct the Story Rules, ensuring they are actionable, detailed, and aligned with both the Writing Prompt and the Author Writing Sheet.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the story around a central philosophical dilemma related to the future's dystopian state.
