    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Author Writing Sheet and the Writing Prompt, I will focus on the author's unique storytelling style, which includes existential dilemmas, open-ended resolutions, and speculative elements. The author blends genres, uses introspective character development, and employs vivid language. The Writing Prompt involves a magic school setting, a public demonstration, and an unexpected encounter with authority figures, which can be infused with the author's style by incorporating existential themes, introspective character moments, and a blend of fantasy with speculative elements. I will create detailed, actionable Story Rules under the categories of Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use, ensuring they are tailored to the Writing Prompt and reflect the author's style.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Structure the story around an existential dilemma faced by the protagonist, a student at a magic school. After the public demonstration, introduce an open-ended resolution where the protagonist is left contemplating the implications of their magical abilities and the expectations placed upon them. For example, the protagonist might realize their magic has unintended consequences, leaving them to ponder their role in the magical community.\n  - Introduce conflict through personal and societal challenges. The protagonist's internal struggle with self-doubt and the pressure to perform can be intertwined with the societal expectations of the magic school. For instance, the protagonist might feel isolated due to their unique magical abilities, which are both a gift and a burden.\n  - Engage with the prompt by embedding speculative elements that challenge the protagonist's perception of reality. After the demonstration, the protagonist could experience a vision or a magical anomaly that reveals hidden truths about the school or their own powers, blurring the line between reality and illusion.\n  - Resolve the narrative by focusing on character introspection rather than external events. The protagonist's encounter with the teachers and principal should lead to a moment of self-reflection, where they come to terms with their fears and aspirations, rather than a straightforward resolution of the external conflict.\n  - Use a cyclical plot structure where the ending reflects or contrasts with the beginning. The story could start with the protagonist's anxiety about the demonstration and end with a newfound understanding or acceptance of their magical identity, initiated by the encounter with authority figures.\n\n- **Creativity**:  \n  - Blend genres by combining elements of fantasy with speculative fiction. The magic school setting can incorporate mythological references or futuristic magical technology, creating a unique world that challenges traditional fantasy tropes.\n  - Introduce unconventional twists that subvert expectations. For example, the protagonist's demonstration might reveal a hidden talent or a forbidden type of magic, surprising both the audience and themselves.\n  - Integrate imaginative elements that serve as metaphors for human emotions and experiences. The protagonist's magic could symbolize their inner turmoil or desire for acceptance, with each spell reflecting a different aspect of their personality.\n  - Use speculative scenarios to explore philosophical questions about identity and existence. The protagonist's magic might raise questions about the nature of power and responsibility, prompting them to consider what it means to be truly skilled or gifted.\n  - Incorporate elements of surprise or revelation to deepen thematic exploration. The encounter with the teachers and principal could lead to a surprising revelation about the protagonist's past or the true purpose of the magic school, adding depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:  \n  - Develop the protagonist through introspective dialogue that reveals their inner conflicts and motivations. Conversations with peers or mentors before and after the demonstration can highlight the protagonist's fears and aspirations.\n  - Create a multidimensional protagonist who grapples with moral and existential dilemmas. The protagonist might struggle with the ethical implications of their magic, questioning whether they should use it for personal gain or the greater good.\n  - Establish an immersive setting that reflects the protagonist's emotional state and thematic elements. The magic school should be described in a way that mirrors the protagonist's journey, with its grandeur or mystery reflecting their internal struggles.\n  - Use the setting as a backdrop to highlight character development and thematic exploration. The school's history or architecture could symbolize the weight of tradition and expectation, influencing the protagonist's development.\n  - Contrast the protagonist's internal world with their external environment to emphasize thematic tension. The protagonist's internal conflict might be at odds with the school's celebratory atmosphere during the demonstration, highlighting their sense of isolation or pressure.\n\n- **Language Use**:  \n  - Employ vivid, sensory imagery to create an immersive atmosphere. Describe the magic school and the demonstration with rich details, such as the shimmering spells and the echoing applause, to draw the reader into the scene.\n  - Use dialogue to convey character depth and advance the narrative. The protagonist's interactions with teachers and peers should reveal their complex emotions and drive the story forward.\n  - Utilize a reflective and introspective tone to explore the protagonist's inner world. The narrative voice should be contemplative, capturing the protagonist's thoughts and feelings as they navigate the challenges of the magic school.\n  - Incorporate rhetorical devices and figures of speech to enhance thematic resonance. Use metaphors and similes to convey the protagonist's emotional journey, such as describing their magic as a \"double-edged sword\" or their anxiety as a \"storm brewing within.\"\n  - Use varied sentence structures to control pacing and emphasize key moments. Shift from long, descriptive sentences during introspective moments to short, impactful ones during moments of revelation or decision, mirroring the protagonist's fluctuating emotions.\n  - Employ a narrative perspective that allows for deep character introspection and thematic exploration. A third-person limited perspective can provide insight into the protagonist's thoughts and emotions, enhancing the story's emotional depth.  \n</story_rules>",

    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules for the given Writing Prompt, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet to identify key storytelling elements that define the author's style. The prompt involves a ghost ship and reincarnation, which aligns well with the author's penchant for existential dilemmas, speculative elements, and introspective character development. I will create rules that incorporate these elements, ensuring they are tailored to the narrative of a ghost ship and reincarnation. The rules will be organized into the categories of Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use, each enriched with examples inspired by the Author Writing Sheet.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Structure the story around the existential dilemma of reincarnation and unfinished missions. Begin with the protagonist's discovery of the shipwreck, leading to the revelation of their past life as the ship's captain. Leave the resolution open-ended, focusing on the protagonist's internal struggle with their newfound identity and mission. For example, the protagonist might question the morality of their past actions as a captain and whether they should complete the mission or forge a new path.\n  - Introduce conflict through the protagonist's personal challenge of reconciling their current life with their past identity, intertwined with the societal implications of the ghost ship's reappearance. For instance, the protagonist could face skepticism from others who see the ship as a mere legend or threat.\n  - Engage with the prompt by embedding speculative elements that challenge the protagonist's perception of reality, such as the ship's ability to communicate through cryptic messages or visions of the past. These elements should blur the line between the protagonist's current reality and their past life.\n  - Resolve the narrative by focusing on the protagonist's introspection rather than external events. The story might end with the protagonist standing on the ship's deck, contemplating their next move, leaving their decision and the ship's fate ambiguous.\n\n- **Creativity**:  \n  - Blend genres by combining elements of historical fiction with fantasy, using the ghost ship as a bridge between the past and present.
