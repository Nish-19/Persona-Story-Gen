    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules for the given Writing Prompt, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet to identify key storytelling elements that can be adapted to the narrative of a ghost appearing at their own funeral to correct inaccuracies. The author's style is characterized by unexpected twists, humor, and the blending of modern and fantastical elements. These traits will be crucial in crafting a story that aligns with the prompt while maintaining the author's unique voice. I will focus on creating a plot with a central twist, using humor to resolve tension, and developing characters through witty dialogue. The setting will juxtapose the mundane (a funeral) with the fantastical (a ghost), and the language will be casual and engaging, with humor and wit driving the narrative.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Begin the story with a seemingly solemn and traditional funeral setting, establishing the mood with eulogies that paint an idealized picture of the deceased. Introduce the central twist by having the ghost of the deceased appear unexpectedly, causing a humorous disruption. For example, the ghost might interrupt a particularly exaggerated eulogy with a sarcastic comment, such as, \"I didn't know I was a saint!\"  \n  - Use humor to resolve the tension created by the ghost's appearance. The ghost should engage in a series of humorous exchanges with the attendees, correcting their misconceptions with witty remarks. For instance, when someone claims the deceased was a philanthropist, the ghost might quip, \"I was more of a 'philanthro-pest' if you ask my neighbors.\"  \n  - Conclude the story with an ironic twist that reframes the narrative. Perhaps the ghost decides to stay and haunt the funeral home, finding it more entertaining than the afterlife, thus subverting the expectation of a peaceful departure.  \n\n- **Creativity**:  \n  - Subvert traditional funeral tropes by introducing the ghost as a character who is more interested in setting the record straight than in moving on. This can be illustrated by the ghost's playful interactions with the living, such as rearranging flowers or making the lights flicker to emphasize their points.  \n  - Blend the mundane setting of a funeral with the fantastical element of a ghost, creating a juxtaposition that drives the narrative. The ghost might use their ethereal abilities to manipulate the environment, like making the wind blow through the chapel at opportune moments to punctuate their corrections.  \n  - Use humor to reinterpret the conventional scenario of a funeral. The ghost's perspective on the proceedings can provide a comedic take on human rituals, such as commenting on the choice of music or the quality of the catering.  \n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:  \n  - Develop the ghost's character through witty and humorous dialogue. The ghost should have a distinct voice that reflects their personality, using humor to reveal their true nature and past. For example, the ghost might say, \"I see my reputation has been greatly exaggerated,\" when hearing a particularly flattering eulogy.  \n  - Use internal monologues to provide depth to the ghost's character, revealing their thoughts and feelings about the inaccuracies being shared. The ghost might internally reflect, \"I never thought I'd have to fact-check my own funeral.\"  \n  - Describe the funeral setting in a way that highlights the contrast between the somber atmosphere and the ghost's playful presence. The setting should feel vivid and dynamic, with the ghost's actions bringing life to the otherwise static environment.  \n\n- **Language Use**:  \n  - Employ casual and contemporary language to create a relatable and engaging narrative. The ghost's dialogue should be peppered with modern slang and humor, making them feel like a character who is still very much connected to the world of the living.  \n  - Use dialogue to drive the narrative and reveal character dynamics. The interactions between the ghost and the funeral attendees should be lively and humorous, with the ghost using their wit to challenge the attendees' perceptions.  \n  - Incorporate humor and wit in the dialogue to enhance the narrative tone. The ghost might use rhetorical questions to engage the attendees, such as, \"Did you really think I was that perfect?\"  \n  - Use descriptive language to create a vivid and imaginative setting.
