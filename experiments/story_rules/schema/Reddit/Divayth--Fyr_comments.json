    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules for the given Writing Prompt, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The goal is to create rules that reflect the author's unique style while aligning with the narrative potential of the Writing Prompt.\n\n### Plot\n1. **Non-linear Narrative**: The author uses non-linear storytelling, often through flashbacks or time shifts. For the zombie apocalypse prompt, this could involve the protagonist reflecting on past experiences with medieval history or reenactments that prepared them for this moment.\n2. **Internal Conflict**: The author emphasizes internal struggles. The protagonist might grapple with the moral implications of using medieval weapons against zombified former neighbors.\n3. **Twist Resolutions**: The author often includes a twist. Perhaps the protagonist discovers that the medieval armory holds a secret that could change the course of the apocalypse.\n4. **Open Endings**: The author leaves endings open to interpretation. The story could end with the protagonist standing at the threshold of their home, uncertain of what they will find inside.\n5. **Dialogue-Driven Plot**: The author uses dialogue to reveal key plot points. Conversations with other survivors or even imagined dialogues with historical figures could drive the narrative.\n\n### Creativity\n1. **Genre Blending**: The author blends genres. The story should mix elements of horror (zombies) with historical fantasy (medieval armory).\n2. **Trope Reinterpretation**: The author reinterprets tropes. The protagonist's choice of medieval weapons over guns subverts typical zombie apocalypse narratives.\n3. **Imaginative Elements**: The author introduces unconventional elements. The protagonist might discover that the armor has magical properties.\n4. **Humor and Satire**: The author uses humor to critique norms. The protagonist's anachronistic approach could humorously highlight the absurdity of modern reliance on technology.\n5. **Speculative Scenarios**: The author explores philosophical questions. The story could question the nature of heroism and survival in a world turned upside down.\n\n### Development (Character and Setting)\n1. **Complex Characters**: The protagonist should have a rich emotional arc, perhaps dealing with themes of identity as a modern-day knight.\n2. **Detailed Settings**: The setting should reflect the protagonist's internal state, with the medieval armory serving as a sanctuary and symbol of hope.\n3. **Secondary Characters**: Use secondary characters to contrast the protagonist's choices, such as a friend who chose guns and faces different challenges.\n4. **Immersive Worlds**: Create a believable world where medieval tactics are surprisingly effective against zombies.\n5. **Societal Impact**: Explore how societal collapse affects individual choices, critiquing the reliance on modern technology.\n\n### Language Use\n1. **Vivid Imagery**: Use sensory details to describe the protagonist's armor and the eerie silence of a zombie-infested world.\n2. **Witty Dialogue**: Incorporate humor in the protagonist's interactions, perhaps with a fellow survivor who questions their choice of weaponry.\n3. **Varied Sentence Structures**: Use short sentences to build tension during zombie encounters and longer, reflective passages for introspection.\n4. **Rhetorical Devices**: Employ metaphors and similes to enhance the narrative, such as comparing the protagonist's armor to a knight's resolve.\n5. **Conversational Tone**: Maintain an informal tone to create immediacy, drawing readers into the protagonist's unique perspective.\n\nThese insights will guide the creation of detailed Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and the author's style.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Use a non-linear narrative structure by incorporating flashbacks to the protagonist's past experiences with medieval history or reenactments.
