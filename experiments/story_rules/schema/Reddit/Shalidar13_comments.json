    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and the Author Writing Sheet, I will focus on the author's unique storytelling style across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt suggests a narrative involving a character's awareness of time and its discrepancies, which can be explored through personal conflict, unexpected revelations, and introspective character development. The author's style, which includes central conflicts resolved through character interaction, creative genre blending, and rich language use, will be integrated into the Story Rules. I will ensure that the rules are actionable, detailed, and tailored to the prompt, using examples inspired by the Author Writing Sheet.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Structure the story around a central conflict involving the protagonist's struggle with the perception of time. Use character interactions to explore this conflict, such as a conversation with a mentor or a mysterious figure who offers insights into the nature of time. For example, the protagonist might confront a mentor about the discrepancy, leading to a revelation about a hidden dimension where time flows differently.\n  - Introduce a twist or unexpected revelation to resolve the narrative. For instance, reveal that the protagonist's training was part of an experiment to manipulate time perception, and they have the power to influence time themselves.\n  - Ensure the conflict is deeply personal or moral, such as the protagonist's internal battle with the fear of losing control over time and the implications it has on their reality.\n  - Leave the resolution open-ended, suggesting future developments. For example, the protagonist might decide to explore the boundaries of this new understanding of time, hinting at further adventures.\n  - Use dialogue to drive the plot and reveal character motivations. A conversation with a fellow trainee could reveal shared anxieties about time and the consequences of their training.\n\n- **Creativity**:  \n  - Blend genres by incorporating elements of science fiction and psychological thriller, mixing the protagonist's mundane training with the surreal experience of time distortion.\n  - Reinterpret traditional elements of time manipulation in unconventional ways. For example, time could be personified as a character that interacts with the protagonist, offering cryptic advice.\n  - Integrate imaginative elements that subvert expectations, such as a device that appears to be a simple watch but is actually a complex time-altering tool.\n  - Use humor or irony to add depth, such as the protagonist's ironic realization that despite all their training, they are still unprepared for the reality of time manipulation.\n  - Explore themes of identity and transformation, as the protagonist's understanding of themselves evolves with their perception of time.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:  \n  - Develop characters through their interactions and dialogue, revealing their personalities and motivations. The protagonist's discussions with peers can highlight their determination and fear of the unknown.\n  - Create multidimensional characters with complex emotional arcs, such as a mentor who appears confident but harbors doubts about the training's ethical implications.\n  - Establish immersive settings that reflect the story's tone and themes. The training facility could be described as both sterile and enigmatic, with rooms that seem to shift in time.\n  - Use detailed descriptions to create vivid imagery and atmosphere, such as the protagonist's perception of time slowing down, with sensory details like the ticking of a clock echoing in an otherwise silent room.\n  - Explore themes of belonging and identity through character development, as the protagonist questions their place in a world where time is not as it seems.\n\n- **Language Use**:  \n  - Employ a rich and varied vocabulary to enhance the narrative's tone and mood. Use terms like \"temporal distortion,\" \"chronological anomaly,\" and \"time dilation\" to create a sense of mystery and tension.\n  - Use figurative language, such as metaphors and similes, to create vivid imagery. Describe time as \"a river that bends and twists, defying the banks of reality.\"\n  - Use dialogue to convey character emotions and advance the plot. A heated exchange with a mentor could reveal the protagonist's frustration and determination.\n  - Employ varied sentence structures to maintain narrative pacing and interest. Use short, impactful sentences during moments of revelation to heighten emotional impact.\n  - Use descriptive language to create a strong sense of place and atmosphere. Describe the training facility as \"a labyrinth of corridors, each echoing with the whispers of time.\"\n  - Use rhetorical devices, such as repetition and parallelism, to emphasize key themes and ideas. Repeat phrases like \"time is slipping\" to underscore the protagonist's anxiety.\n  - Use a narrative perspective that allows for introspection and character development. The protagonist's internal monologue can explore their fears and hopes regarding time.\n  - Maintain a consistent tone that aligns with the story's themes and genre, balancing tension with moments of introspective calm.\n  - Use dialogue to reveal character relationships and dynamics, such as the camaraderie or rivalry between trainees.\n  - Use sensory details to create an immersive reading experience, describing the sensation of time slowing as \"a heavy blanket settling over the world, muffling sound and movement.\"  \n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules for the given Writing Prompt, \"You are an immortal on a mission to help everyone else become immortal,\" I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The goal is to create rules that reflect the author's unique style while aligning with the themes of immortality and transformation inherent in the prompt.\n\n### Plot\nThe author structures stories around central conflicts resolved through character interaction or revelation, often with a twist or unexpected resolution. For this prompt, the central conflict could involve the protagonist's struggle to convince others of the benefits and challenges of immortality. The resolution might involve a revelation about the true nature of immortality or a twist where the protagonist learns something unexpected about their mission.\n\n### Creativity\nThe author blends genres and reinterprets traditional elements in unconventional ways. For this story, immortality could be explored through a mix of fantasy and modern elements, such as using technology or ancient rituals. The narrative could subvert expectations by presenting immortality not as a blessing but as a complex, multifaceted state of being.\n\n### Development (Character and Setting)\nCharacters are developed through interactions and dialogue, with complex emotional arcs. The protagonist, as an immortal, could have a rich backstory and a deep emotional connection to their mission. The setting should be immersive, perhaps spanning different eras or locations to reflect the timeless nature of immortality.\n\n### Language Use\nThe author uses rich vocabulary, figurative language, and varied sentence structures. The narrative should employ descriptive language to create a vivid sense of place and atmosphere, using dialogue to reveal character motivations and relationships. The tone should align with the story's themes, possibly introspective and philosophical, given the nature of immortality.\n\nWith these insights, I will craft detailed Story Rules that guide the language model in creating a story that aligns with both the author's style and the Writing Prompt.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the story around a central conflict involving the protagonist's mission to help others achieve immortality.

This could be illustrated through a scene where the emperor reflects on their past and the changes they must embrace to protect their realm.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:  \n  - Develop characters through their interactions and dialogue, revealing their personalities and motivations. For instance, depict the emperor as a wise and calculating figure, whose conversations with their advisors reveal their strategic mind and hidden compassion.\n  - Create multidimensional characters with complex emotional arcs, such as the emperor's struggle with their dual identity as a ruler and a shadow figure.
