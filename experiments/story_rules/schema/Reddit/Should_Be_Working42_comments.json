    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules for the given Writing Prompt, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet to identify key storytelling elements and techniques. The author is known for using twists, humor, and absurdity in plots, blending fantasy with reality, and developing characters through dialogue and interactions. The language is often witty, with vivid imagery and a conversational tone. I will tailor these elements to the Writing Prompt, which involves a dungeon scenario with a humorous twist of a super monster fleeing from an easy dungeon. The rules will guide the language model to create a story that reflects the author's style while aligning with the prompt's themes.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Begin the story with a humorous setup of the dungeon, emphasizing its reputation as \"coughing baby easy\" and its use as a casual hangout. Use a first-person perspective to create intimacy, perhaps from the viewpoint of a rookie adventurer or a child playing in the dungeon.\n  - Introduce the central conflict with the unexpected arrival of a super monster from a dangerous region. Highlight the absurdity of the situation as the monster becomes aware of its surroundings and reacts with fear.\n  - Incorporate a twist where the monster's fear is revealed to be due to a humorous misunderstanding or an ironic reason related to the dungeon's reputation.\n  - Conclude with an open-ended resolution, allowing readers to interpret the monster's fate or the dungeon's future, while maintaining a comedic tone.\n\n- **Creativity**:  \n  - Blend elements of fantasy and reality by describing the dungeon with both magical and mundane features, such as enchanted training dummies alongside snack stands for children.\n  - Reinterpret common fantasy tropes with a humorous twist, such as the super monster being afraid of something trivial within the dungeon, like a child's toy or a harmless spell.\n  - Use speculative scenarios to explore societal norms, such as the community's casual attitude towards the dungeon despite its potential dangers.\n  - Incorporate anachronistic elements for comedic contrast, like modern-day items or references appearing in the fantasy setting, such as a \"No Monsters Allowed\" sign written in crayon.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:  \n  - Develop characters through their interactions and dialogue. For example, show the reactions of children and rookies in the dungeon as they encounter the super monster, using witty exchanges to reveal their personalities.\n  - Create a setting that reflects the story's tone, such as a whimsical and colorful dungeon that contrasts with the typical dark and foreboding fantasy dungeons.\n  - Use anthropomorphism to give the super monster a distinct personality, perhaps portraying it as comically timid or overly cautious.\n  - Focus on the internal conflicts and motivations of the characters, such as a rookie adventurer's desire to prove themselves or a child's curiosity about the monster.\n\n- **Language Use**:  \n  - Employ witty and humorous dialogue to enhance character interactions, such as banter between children or a rookie's internal monologue about the absurdity of the situation.\n  - Use vivid imagery and descriptive language to create an immersive atmosphere, detailing the dungeon's quirky features and the monster's exaggerated reactions.\n  - Incorporate rhetorical questions to engage the reader and emphasize character thoughts, such as pondering why a super monster would fear an easy dungeon.\n  - Maintain a conversational tone to create a relatable and engaging narrative voice, drawing readers into the whimsical world of the dungeon.\n  - Include puns and wordplay to add humor and depth, such as jokes about the dungeon's reputation or the monster's unexpected behavior.  \n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules for the given Writing Prompt, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The goal is to create rules that reflect the author's unique style while aligning with the prompt about starting a medieval business after being isekai'd.\n\n### Plot\n1. **Twist or Unexpected Revelation**: The story should conclude with a twist that redefines the protagonist's business venture.

    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories. The author's style is characterized by unexpected twists, humor, and a blend of fantasy and reality. The author often uses a first-person perspective and resolves stories with irony or open-ended conclusions. Characters are developed through dialogue and internal conflicts, while settings reflect the story's tone. Language is witty, with vivid imagery and a conversational tone. I will incorporate these elements into the Story Rules, ensuring they are tailored to the prompt about an unexpected proposal acceptance.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Begin the story with a humorous and absurd central conflict: the protagonist's plan to propose to someone they expect to reject them. Use a first-person perspective to create intimacy and humor, allowing the protagonist to express their internal monologue and doubts about the proposal.  \n  - Introduce a twist or unexpected revelation at the climax: the girl says \"yes,\" which is contrary to the protagonist's expectations. This twist should redefine the protagonist's understanding of the situation and their own motivations.  \n  - Conclude the narrative with a sense of irony or comedic resolution. For example, the protagonist might discover that the girl accepted the proposal for an equally unexpected reason, such as a bet or a misunderstanding, leaving the resolution open-ended for reader interpretation.  \n\n- **Creativity**:  \n  - Blend elements of fantasy and reality by incorporating whimsical or surreal elements into the proposal scene. For instance, the setting could include an unexpected magical event, like a sudden rain of flower petals or a talking animal offering advice.  \n  - Reinterpret common romantic tropes with a humorous twist. For example, the protagonist might use an unconventional proposal method, such as a pop culture reference or a comedic prop, to subvert traditional expectations.  \n  - Use speculative scenarios to explore human behavior, such as the protagonist's internal debate about the nature of love and commitment, adding depth to the comedic premise.  \n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:  \n  - Develop characters through their interactions and dialogue. Focus on the protagonist's humorous exchanges with friends or the girl, revealing their personalities and motivations.  \n  - Create a setting that reflects the story's tone and themes. For example, the proposal could take place in a quirky or unexpected location, like a theme park or a chaotic family gathering, enhancing the absurdity of the situation.  \n  - Use anthropomorphism to give non-human elements, like a pet or an inanimate object, distinct personalities that contribute to the narrative, such as a pet dog that seems to disapprove of the proposal.  \n\n- **Language Use**:  \n  - Employ witty and humorous dialogue to enhance character interactions. The protagonist's conversations should be filled with clever banter and playful teasing, especially during the proposal scene.  \n  - Use vivid imagery and descriptive language to create an immersive atmosphere. Describe the setting and characters with colorful details that capture the whimsical and comedic tone of the story.  \n  - Incorporate rhetorical questions to engage the reader and emphasize the protagonist's thoughts. For example, the protagonist might internally question their sanity or the girl's motives after the unexpected \"yes.\"  \n  - Maintain a conversational tone to create a relatable and engaging narrative voice. The protagonist's internal monologue should be casual and self-reflective, drawing the reader into their experience.  \n  - Include puns and wordplay to add humor and depth to the narrative. For instance, the protagonist might make a pun about \"tying the knot\" or \"taking the plunge\" in a humorous context.  \n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Author Writing Sheet and the Writing Prompt, I will analyze each category to extract the author's unique storytelling style and apply it to the prompt. The prompt involves a journey to a castle, an empty throne, and a confession from a friend, which suggests themes of mystery, revelation, and possibly betrayal or unexpected alliances. The author's style includes twists, humor, absurdity, and a blend of fantasy and reality, which can be effectively integrated into this narrative.  \n\nFor **Plot**, I will focus on creating a central conflict that is both humorous and absurd, using a first-person perspective to enhance intimacy, and concluding with a twist or open-ended resolution. For **Creativity**, I will blend fantasy elements with reality, reinterpret common tropes humorously, and use absurdist humor. In **Development (Character and Setting)**, I will focus on character interactions and dialogue, use minimalistic settings, and possibly anthropomorphize elements of the castle. For **Language Use**, I will employ witty dialogue, vivid imagery, rhetorical questions, a conversational tone, and puns.  \n\nThese elements will be tailored to the prompt, ensuring the story is engaging, humorous, and reflective of the author's style.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:  \n  - Begin the story with a first-person perspective as you approach the castle, creating an intimate connection with the reader. Describe your anticipation and the journey's absurd challenges, such as a moat filled with rubber ducks instead of water.\n  - Establish a central conflict that is humorous and absurd, such as the throne being empty because your enemy is actually a sentient, mischievous suit of armor that has wandered off.\n  - Use a twist or unexpected revelation to conclude the story. For example, your friend confesses that they are the true ruler of the castle, having orchestrated the journey to reclaim their throne.\n  - Consider leaving the resolution open-ended, allowing the reader to ponder the implications of your friend's confession and the empty throne.\n\n- **Creativity**:  \n  - Blend elements of fantasy and reality by describing the castle as a mix of medieval architecture and modern conveniences, like a drawbridge that doubles as a retractable garage door.\n  - Reinterpret common tropes with a humorous twist, such as the \"damsel in distress\" being a dragon who is actually quite content with their solitude.\n  - Use absurdist humor to enhance the narrative, such as the castle's guards being enchanted garden gnomes who take their duties very seriously.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:  \n  - Develop characters through their interactions and dialogue. For instance, have your friend reveal their confession through a series of humorous exchanges that highlight their personality and motivations.\n  - Create a setting that reflects the story's tone and themes. The castle should feel both grand and slightly ridiculous, with rooms that defy logic, like a ballroom filled with floating bubbles.\n  - Use minimalistic settings to focus on character interactions and plot. The throne room, for example, could be sparsely decorated, emphasizing the empty throne and the tension between you and your friend.\n\n- **Language Use**:  \n  - Employ witty and humorous dialogue to enhance character interactions. For example, your friend might joke about the throne's emptiness, saying, \"Looks like the king's on a permanent coffee break.\"\n  - Use vivid imagery and descriptive language to create an immersive atmosphere. Describe the castle's eerie silence and the echo of your footsteps in the grand hall.\n  - Incorporate rhetorical questions to engage the reader and emphasize character thoughts, such as pondering, \"Why would anyone leave a perfectly good throne unattended?\"\n  - Maintain a conversational tone to create a relatable and engaging narrative voice, drawing the reader into your journey and discoveries.\n  - Add humor and depth with puns and wordplay, such as referring to the throne room as \"the seat of power, currently unseated.\"  \n</story_rules>",
