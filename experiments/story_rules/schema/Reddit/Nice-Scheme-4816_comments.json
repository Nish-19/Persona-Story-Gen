    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules for the given Writing Prompt, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet to identify key storytelling elements that define the author's style.

Characters are developed through witty dialogue, and settings often contrast the mundane with the fantastical. Language is modern, sarcastic, and vivid. I will create Story Rules that incorporate these elements, ensuring they align with the prompt's narrative and thematic potential.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a dialogue-driven scene among the sidekicks, using witty and sarcastic exchanges to reveal their doubts about the hero's capabilities.
