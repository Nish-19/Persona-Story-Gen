    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt presents a dystopian scenario where humanity reverts to natural selection by removing safety features, which can be explored through unexpected plot twists, a blend of realism and speculative fiction, and character development that reflects internal conflicts and societal implications. The author's style includes using first-person perspectives, ambiguous resolutions, and cyclical structures, which can be adapted to this prompt. Creativity can be enhanced by blending genres and reinterpreting tropes, while character development can focus on internal conflicts and immersive settings. Language use should employ vivid imagery, varied sentence structures, and rhetorical questions to engage readers.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a first-person perspective to create an intimate connection with the reader. For example, start with a character's internal monologue as they navigate a city devoid of safety features, reflecting on the societal shift towards natural selection.\n  - Introduce unexpected twists that challenge initial assumptions. For instance, reveal that the protagonist, initially seen as a victim of the new societal norms, is actually part of a resistance group working to restore safety features.\n  - Build tension through character interactions and revelations. Use a scene where the protagonist confronts a government official, leading to a revelation about the true purpose behind the removal of safety features.\n  - Resolve the narrative with a sense of ambiguity, leaving room for interpretation. End with the protagonist standing at the edge of a dangerous precipice, contemplating whether to jump as a symbolic act of defiance or acceptance.\n  - Employ a cyclical structure by having the story end where it began, perhaps with the protagonist returning to a significant location that mirrors the opening scene, highlighting the unchanged nature of their internal struggle.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Blend genres by incorporating elements of dystopian fiction and speculative realism. Create a world where technological advancements coexist with primitive survival instincts, such as a city where AI monitors human behavior but does not intervene in accidents.\n  - Reinterpret common tropes with unique twists. For example, subvert the trope of a hero saving the day by having the protagonist's actions inadvertently cause more harm, questioning the morality of their resistance.\n  - Integrate imaginative elements that challenge conventional logic. Introduce a subplot where certain individuals develop heightened senses as a natural adaptation to the lack of safety features, adding a fantastical layer to the narrative.\n  - Explore the consequences of technological advancements in this speculative setting. Delve into how society's reliance on technology has shifted from protection to observation, creating a surveillance state that watches but does not act.\n  - Use humor and irony to enhance the narrative's impact. Include a scene where characters mock the absurdity of their situation, such as a public service announcement that cheerfully explains the benefits of natural selection.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through their internal conflicts and emotional arcs. Focus on a protagonist who struggles with the morality of the new societal norms, torn between survival and empathy for those who suffer.\n  - Create immersive settings that reflect the story's tone and themes. Describe a cityscape that is both futuristic and perilous, with towering skyscrapers lacking railings and streets filled with hidden dangers.\n  - Use dialogue to reveal character relationships and dynamics. Craft conversations that highlight the tension between those who support the new order and those who resist, revealing underlying motivations and fears.\n  - Craft multidimensional characters with complex motivations. Develop a protagonist who is not only driven by personal survival but also by a desire to protect others, creating a nuanced portrayal of heroism.\n  - Use setting as a metaphor for character emotions and states of mind. Describe a scene where the protagonist stands on a crumbling bridge, symbolizing their precarious mental state and the fragility of their world.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ vivid, sensory imagery to create an immersive atmosphere. Use descriptions that evoke the danger and beauty of a world without safety features, such as the sharp wind cutting across an open rooftop.\n  - Use varied sentence structures to control pacing and build tension. Alternate between long, descriptive sentences and short, abrupt ones to mirror the protagonist's fluctuating emotions and the unpredictability of their environment.\n  - Incorporate rhetorical questions to engage the reader and provoke thought. Have the protagonist internally question the ethics of their society, inviting readers to ponder the implications of natural selection.\n  - Use colloquial language and humor to create relatable characters. Include casual dialogue that reflects the characters' attempts to cope with their harsh reality, adding depth and relatability to their interactions.\n  - Use repetition for emphasis and to reinforce key themes. Repeat phrases that highlight the protagonist's internal struggle, such as \"Is this survival or surrender?\" to underscore the central conflict of the narrative.\n</story_rules>",
