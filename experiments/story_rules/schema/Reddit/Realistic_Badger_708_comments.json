    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules for the given Writing Prompt, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet to identify key storytelling elements that define the author's style. The prompt involves a knight, a princess, and a teddy bear at a party, suggesting a blend of fantasy and potential humor. The author's style includes central conflicts, unexpected twists, open-ended resolutions, and humor, which can be integrated into this narrative. The creativity section highlights genre blending and trope subversion, which can be applied to the knight's role and the party setting. Character development focuses on dialogue and emotional arcs, which can be used to explore the knight's relationship with the princess and Mister Wiggles.
