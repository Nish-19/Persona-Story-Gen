    "<thinking>  \nTo generate Story Rules that align with the Writing Prompt and mimic the author's style, I will analyze the Author Writing Sheet across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The Writing Prompt suggests a mystery or crime narrative with a potentially supernatural or fantastical twist, given the author's style. The rules will incorporate dialogue-driven plots, supernatural elements, unexpected twists, and humor, as well as detailed character and setting development. The language will be conversational, with humor and vivid descriptions.  \n</thinking>  \n<story_rules>  \n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a dialogue-driven scene where the protagonist, a detective or investigator, discusses the bizarre nature of the crime with a colleague. Use dialogue to introduce the conflict, such as, \"Over a hundred wounds? What are we dealing with here, a medieval sword fight?\"\n  - Integrate a supernatural or fantastical element as central to the plot. For example, the victim could be revealed to have been involved with a secret society of weapon collectors who use enchanted blades.\n  - Structure the plot to explore themes of identity and belonging, perhaps through the detective's struggle to understand their place in a world where the supernatural is real.\n  - Resolve the narrative with an unexpected twist, such as discovering that the victim was not human, but a shapeshifter or other mythical being, which explains the unusual nature of the wounds.\n  - Use humor and irony to enhance plot engagement. For instance, the detective might quip, \"Looks like someone really wanted to make sure he was dead,\" when examining the crime scene.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Blend fantasy elements with the modern crime setting, such as introducing a magical artifact that the victim was trying to protect or steal.\n  - Reinterpret the prompt by introducing unconventional perspectives, like a talking weapon that witnessed the crime and provides clues.\n  - Incorporate imaginative and humorous dialogue to enhance creativity. For example, a character might joke, \"I guess he really got the Julius Caesar treatment,\" when discussing the number of stab wounds.\n  - Use satire to explore and subvert traditional crime genre conventions, such as a detective who is skeptical of the supernatural but constantly encounters it.\n  - Include elements of surprise, such as a seemingly mundane object at the crime scene turning out to be a key piece of evidence with magical properties.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through dialogue that reveals their inner thoughts and relationships. For instance, the detective might express frustration with their partner's belief in the supernatural, saying, \"I deal in facts, not fairy tales.\"\n  - Establish settings through detailed descriptions that enhance the story's tone and atmosphere. Describe the crime scene with sensory details, like \"The alley was dimly lit, the air thick with the metallic scent of blood and the faint hum of distant traffic.\"\n  - Use humor and irony to develop characters, highlighting their flaws or unique traits. The detective might have a dry sense of humor, often making sarcastic remarks about the bizarre cases they handle.\n  - Portray characters with a mix of supernatural and human traits, such as a forensic expert who is secretly a vampire, adding complexity and depth.\n  - Use contrasting character interactions to highlight differences in worldview, such as a skeptical detective paired with a partner who believes in the supernatural.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use dialogue to reveal character dynamics and advance the plot. For example, a conversation between the detective and a witness might go, \"Did you see anything unusual?\" \"Unusual? In this city? That's a given.\"\n  - Employ humor and sarcasm to create a light-hearted tone even in tense situations. The detective might say, \"Just another day in the office,\" when faced with the bizarre crime scene.\n  - Use vivid and sensory descriptions to enhance the setting and mood. Describe the victim's wounds with phrases like \"a tapestry of cuts, each telling its own violent story.\"\n  - Incorporate rhetorical questions to engage the reader and characters in introspection. The detective might ponder, \"What kind of monster does this?\"\n  - Maintain a conversational and informal narrative style to create relatability and immediacy. Use short, punchy sentences to keep the narrative pace brisk, such as, \"This isn't just a murder. It's a message.\"\n</story_rules>",
