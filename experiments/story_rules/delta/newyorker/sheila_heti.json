    "<thinking>\nAnalyze the style, structure, and detailing of the examples to infer patterns and key elements. Use this analysis to determine how to craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt.\n\nThe examples provided detailed and actionable rules under the categories of **Plot**, **Creativity**, **Development (Character and Setting)**, and **Language Use**. Each category contained specific instructions that guided the narrative, character development, and thematic exploration. The rules were comprehensive, covering various aspects such as pacing, tone, and narrative voice.\n\nFor the new writing prompt, the rules should focus on the contrast between the vibrant world and the gray corner, the significance of the old woman's rebellion, and the broader implications for the society that enforces color distribution. The narrative should explore themes of conformity, memory, and resistance.\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin with the protagonist's discovery of the old woman's gray corner, setting the stage for the central conflict.\n  - Develop a backstory for the old woman, revealing her reasons for preserving the grayness and her personal history with the law that mandates color distribution.\n  - Introduce a series of events where the protagonist uncovers the secrets hidden in the gray corner, each revelation deepening the mystery and tension.\n  - Build towards a climax where the protagonist must decide whether to expose the old woman's secret or protect it, highlighting the moral and ethical dilemmas.\n  - Conclude with an open-ended resolution that leaves the reader questioning the true value of color and conformity in society.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use vivid and contrasting descriptions to highlight the difference between the vibrant world and the gray corner.\n  - Incorporate symbolic elements within the gray corner that represent forgotten aspects of the past, such as old photographs, letters, or artifacts.\n  - Explore the concept of color as both a tool of control and a source of beauty, creating a nuanced portrayal of the law's impact on society.\n  - Introduce imaginative elements that challenge the reader's perception of color and grayness, such as the emotional or psychological effects of living in a mandated colorful world.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as a curious and empathetic character, driven by a desire to understand the old woman's rebellion.\n  - Flesh out the old woman as a complex character with a rich history, including her motivations for preserving the gray corner and her experiences under the color law.\n  - Describe the setting of the old woman's apartment in detail, using it to reflect her personality and the contrast between her private rebellion and the outside world.\n  - Create a vibrant and dynamic world outside the apartment, emphasizing the societal norms and the omnipresence of color enforcement.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use descriptive and evocative language to create a vivid contrast between the colorful world and the gray corner.\n  - Maintain a reflective and contemplative tone, allowing for moments of introspection and philosophical exploration.\n  - Employ dialogue to reveal character motivations and advance the plot, using it sparingly but effectively.\n  - Utilize a third-person narrative to provide a broader perspective on the societal implications of the color law and the old woman's rebellion.\n  - Incorporate metaphors and similes to enhance the thematic depth and emotional resonance of the story.\n</story_rules>"
