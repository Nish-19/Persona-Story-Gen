    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify the style, structure, and level of detail used in the rules. The new prompt involves themes of rebellion, secrets, and the societal impact of color distribution, which requires a focus on the contrast between vibrant and gray settings, the symbolism of color, and the character development of the old woman. The rules will need to guide the narrative to explore these themes deeply, using vivid imagery and introspective language. I will ensure each rule is actionable and includes examples that align with the prompt's objectives, reflecting the storytelling style demonstrated in the few-shot examples.\n</thinking>\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with the protagonist's discovery of the old woman's gray corner, setting the stage for an exploration of its secrets. Use this discovery as a catalyst for unraveling the history and significance of the grayness in a world dominated by color.\n  - Develop a narrative arc that reveals the old woman's motivations for preserving the gray corner. For example, show how she uses it as a sanctuary to remember a time before the enforced vibrancy, hinting at personal losses or memories tied to the grayness.\n  - Conclude with a revelation that challenges the protagonist's understanding of color and its societal role. Illustrate this with a scene where the protagonist sees the world in a new light, perhaps realizing the beauty in the balance between color and gray.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use the contrast between vibrant colors and gray to symbolize themes of conformity versus individuality. For instance, describe how the gray corner feels like a breath of fresh air amidst the overwhelming vibrancy, suggesting a deeper truth hidden in simplicity.\n  - Incorporate elements of magical realism to enhance the narrative. For example, describe how the gray corner seems to absorb sound, creating a serene silence that contrasts with the bustling world outside.\n  - Create a unique cultural backdrop for the world where colors are distributed by law. Detail how different colors are associated with specific societal roles or emotions, and how the gray corner defies these associations.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the old woman as a complex character with a rich backstory. Use her interactions with the protagonist to reveal her wisdom and the reasons behind her quiet rebellion. For example, show her sharing stories of a time when gray was not seen as undesirable but as a canvas for imagination.\n  - Craft the setting of the gray corner with meticulous detail, emphasizing its stark contrast to the rest of the world. Describe the textures, shadows, and objects within the corner that hold sentimental value, such as a faded photograph or a worn-out book.\n  - Explore the protagonist's transformation through their interactions with the old woman and the gray corner. Illustrate this with moments of introspection where the protagonist questions their own perceptions of color and conformity.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use descriptive and evocative language to paint vivid images of both the vibrant world and the gray corner. Employ sensory details to immerse the reader in the contrasting atmospheres, such as the muted tones and soft textures of the gray corner.\n  - Write in a reflective and contemplative tone, using metaphors and similes to convey the deeper meanings behind the old woman's rebellion. For example, compare the gray corner to an island of tranquility in a sea of chaos.\n  - Incorporate dialogue that reveals character depth and thematic elements. Use the old woman's words to impart wisdom and challenge the protagonist's views, such as, \"In a world blinded by color, sometimes it's the gray that lets us truly see.\"\n</story_rules>"
