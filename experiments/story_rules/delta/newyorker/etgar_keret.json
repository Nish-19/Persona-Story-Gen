    "<thinking>\nTo generate the Story Rules for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify the style, structure, and level of detail used in crafting the rules. The few-shot demonstrations emphasize a blend of realism and imaginative elements, character introspection, and a focus on emotional and psychological depth. The rules are structured into categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use, each with specific, actionable instructions and examples.\n\nFor the new writing prompt, the rules will need to reflect the themes of psychological tension, mystery, and the unraveling of a seemingly perfect life. The examples will illustrate how to convey Romi's growing paranoia and the impact of the neighbor's death on her perception of reality. The rules will guide the narrative to explore the intersection of external events and internal psychological states, using vivid language and detailed character development.\n\nI will ensure the rules are comprehensive, providing granular guidance on narrative aspects such as pacing, tone, and character dynamics, while aligning with the new writing prompt's themes and objectives.\n</thinking>\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a vivid depiction of Romi's initial excitement about moving into her dream apartment, establishing a stark contrast with the subsequent tragedy. For example, describe her joy in arranging her new space, only to have it interrupted by the shocking event.\n  - Develop the plot through Romi's growing suspicion and paranoia, using a series of unsettling events that make her question the nature of the neighbor's death. Introduce clues that suggest the death was orchestrated to affect her, such as finding a personal item of hers at the scene.\n  - Conclude with an ambiguous resolution that leaves Romi and the reader questioning the reality of the events. For instance, end with Romi discovering a hidden message that could either confirm her fears or be a figment of her imagination.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use psychological tension and elements of mystery to create a gripping narrative. Incorporate Romi's internal monologue to explore her fears and doubts, blurring the line between reality and paranoia.\n  - Introduce symbolic elements that reflect Romi's mental state, such as a recurring motif of shattered glass representing her fractured sense of security.\n  - Employ a non-linear narrative structure to reflect Romi's disoriented mental state, using flashbacks or fragmented memories to reveal key details about her past and her relationship with the neighbor.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop Romi as a complex character whose carefully constructed life begins to unravel. Use her interactions with other characters, such as her partner or friends, to highlight her growing isolation and suspicion.\n  - Portray the apartment building as both a sanctuary and a source of unease. Use detailed descriptions of the setting to mirror Romi's psychological journey, such as the oppressive silence of the hallways or the eerie flickering of lights.\n  - Introduce secondary characters who add depth to the narrative, such as a mysterious neighbor who seems to know more than they reveal, or a friend who dismisses Romi's concerns, increasing her sense of isolation.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a tense and atmospheric tone, using vivid and sensory-rich language to convey Romi's emotional and psychological state. For example, describe the chilling silence after the neighbor's death or the oppressive weight of Romi's suspicions.\n  - Use metaphor and symbolism to enhance the narrative's emotional impact, such as comparing Romi's unraveling life to a tapestry being slowly pulled apart.\n  - Incorporate dialogue that reflects Romi's internal conflict and growing paranoia, using short, fragmented sentences to convey her anxiety and longer, reflective passages to explore her deeper fears.\n</story_rules>"
