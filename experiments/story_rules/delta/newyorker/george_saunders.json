    "<thinking>\nTo generate the Story Rules for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify the style, structure, and level of detail used in crafting the rules. The few-shot demonstrations emphasize creating rules that are specific, actionable, and enriched with examples. They also focus on aligning the rules with the themes and narrative objectives of the writing prompt. For the new prompt, the rules will need to address the internal conflict of the protagonist, the moral and ethical dilemmas, and the broader implications of their actions. The examples will illustrate how to convey the protagonist's struggle and the tension of the narrative. The rules will be organized into the specified categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use, ensuring comprehensive guidance for storytelling.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the story around the protagonist's internal conflict, using flashbacks to reveal the past assassination and its consequences. Begin with the protagonist receiving news of the new leader's rise, triggering memories of the past.\n    - Example: Start with the protagonist reading a newspaper headline about the new leader's latest atrocity, which prompts a flashback to the moment he assassinated the previous tyrant.\n  - Develop a narrative arc that builds tension as the protagonist weighs the decision to kill again, culminating in a climactic moment of choice.\n    - Example: Create a scene where the protagonist stands outside the new leader's residence, weapon in hand, as he recalls the faces of those affected by his past actions.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use symbolism to represent the protagonist's internal struggle, such as a recurring motif that signifies his guilt or the burden of his past actions.\n    - Example: Introduce a recurring image of a blood-stained handkerchief that the protagonist carries, symbolizing the blood on his hands.\n  - Incorporate elements of suspense and moral ambiguity, challenging the reader to question the righteousness of the protagonist's potential actions.\n    - Example: Describe a conversation with a confidant who argues that killing the new leader might save lives, but at the cost of the protagonist's soul.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as a complex character, torn between his sense of justice and the haunting memories of his past. Use inner monologue to explore his thoughts and emotions.\n    - Example: Write an internal dialogue where the protagonist debates whether he can live with himself if he chooses to kill again.\n  - Establish a setting that reflects the oppressive atmosphere under the new leader's regime, using vivid descriptions to convey the tension and fear in the environment.\n    - Example: Describe the city under the new leader's rule, with soldiers patrolling the streets and citizens whispering in fear.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a somber and reflective tone, using descriptive language to convey the weight of the protagonist's decision and the gravity of the situation.\n    - Example: Use phrases like \"the shadows of his past loomed large\" to emphasize the protagonist's internal struggle.\n  - Use varied sentence structures to reflect the protagonist's fluctuating emotions, with short, abrupt sentences during moments of tension and longer, flowing sentences during introspection.\n    - Example: In a moment of decision, write, \"He stood frozen, heart pounding, breath shallow. Could he do it again? Could he bear the weight of another life?\"\n</story_rules>"
