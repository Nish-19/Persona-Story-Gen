    "<thinking>\nTo generate the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key storytelling elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The new prompt involves themes of responsibility, personal growth, and the strength of relationships, particularly between Peter and Mary Jane. The narrative should focus on Peter's internal struggle and the supportive dynamic with Mary Jane, using the multiverse as a metaphor for his internal challenges. The rules will need to guide the narrative to explore these themes deeply, using vivid language and introspective dialogue to capture the emotional and psychological depth of the characters. Examples will be crafted to illustrate these elements, ensuring they align with the prompt's objectives and the style demonstrated in the few-shot examples.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with Peter in a moment of introspection, reflecting on the overwhelming responsibilities of being Spider-Man. Use this moment to establish the central conflict of balancing his superhero duties with personal growth. For example, depict Peter standing on a rooftop, looking out over the city, contemplating the weight of his dual life.\n  - Develop the narrative through a pivotal conversation between Peter and Mary Jane, where she challenges him to embrace his potential and face his fears. Use this dialogue to drive the plot forward, highlighting their bond as a source of strength. For instance, have Mary Jane remind Peter of his past triumphs and encourage him to trust in their partnership.\n  - Conclude the story with Peter finding renewed determination and clarity, ready to face the unknown challenges ahead. Use a symbolic gesture, such as Peter donning his Spider-Man mask with newfound resolve, to signify his growth and readiness.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Integrate the concept of the multiverse as a metaphor for Peter's internal struggles and potential.

For instance, have her suggest unconventional methods for Peter to manage his responsibilities, such as seeking help from unexpected allies.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop Peter's character through introspective moments and his interactions with Mary Jane. Focus on his internal conflict and growth, using his relationship with Mary Jane as a catalyst for change.

For example, describe The Doctor pacing the console room, replaying past journeys in his mind, questioning if each destination was truly random or orchestrated.\n  - Develop the plot through The Doctor's introspection and investigation, using the TARDIS's systems and past logs as tools to uncover potential manipulation. Highlight moments of realization and doubt, such as The Doctor discovering anomalies in the TARDIS's navigation history that suggest external influence.\n  - Conclude the story with a moment of revelation or decision, leaving the question of the TARDIS's guidance open-ended. For instance, have The Doctor decide to trust his instincts and the TARDIS, despite the lingering uncertainty, symbolizing his acceptance of the unknown.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use imaginative elements to explore the relationship between The Doctor and the TARDIS, suggesting the ship's sentience and potential manipulation.

Use internal monologue to reveal his fears and hopes, such as The Doctor questioning his reliance on the TARDIS and his ability to trust his own judgment.\n  - Portray the TARDIS as a dynamic and enigmatic setting, using its features and systems to reflect The Doctor's emotional state. For example, describe the console room's lighting dimming and brightening in response to The Doctor's mood, symbolizing the ship's connection to him.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ introspective and evocative language, using metaphors and vivid imagery to convey The Doctor's internal conflict and the mysterious nature of the TARDIS. For instance, describe the TARDIS as \"a labyrinth of time and space, its corridors echoing with the whispers of forgotten journeys.\"\n  - Use minimal dialogue, focusing on The Doctor's thoughts and reflections. When dialogue is used, ensure it is impactful and reveals key insights into The Doctor's character and the narrative's themes.\n</story_rules>",
