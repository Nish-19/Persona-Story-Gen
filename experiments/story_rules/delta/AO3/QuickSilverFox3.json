    "<thinking>\nTo generate the Story Rules for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key storytelling elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The few-shot demonstrations emphasize intimate settings, emotional depth, and the blending of past and present experiences. They also highlight the use of sensory details and metaphors to convey the characters' internal states and relationships. I will incorporate these elements into the Story Rules for the new prompt, ensuring they are specific, actionable, and enriched with examples that align with the themes of nostalgia, love, and personal reflection inherent in the prompt.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a focus on the protagonist's attempt to find peace and solitude in the caf\u00e9, using detailed descriptions of the setting to establish a sense of calm and introspection. For example, describe the \"soft clinking of cups and the gentle hum of conversation\" as the protagonist settles into his seat.\n  - Introduce the familiar face as a gentle disruption that stirs memories and emotions. Use this encounter to drive the narrative forward, focusing on the protagonist's internal conflict and the resurfacing of past feelings.\n  - Conclude the story with a moment of emotional resolution or understanding, emphasizing the protagonist's growth and acceptance of his past. Ensure the ending reflects the themes of love and nostalgia, such as a shared smile or a meaningful exchange that suggests reconciliation.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use sensory details and metaphors to convey the protagonist's emotional state and the atmosphere of the caf\u00e9. For instance, describe the \"warmth of the Arcanine's fur\" as a source of comfort and stability amidst the emotional turmoil.\n  - Blend elements of the Pok\u00e9mon world with the personal and emotional narrative, using the Arcanine as a symbol of loyalty and companionship. Highlight the unique bond between the protagonist and his Pok\u00e9mon to add depth to the story.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as a multidimensional character, exploring his internal struggles and the impact of his past on his present. Use internal monologue and sensory details to reveal his vulnerabilities and desires, such as his thoughts on \"the battles fought and the love lost.\"\n  - Create an immersive setting by vividly describing the caf\u00e9 and its atmosphere. Use specific details, like the \"flickering candlelight and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee,\" to enhance the sense of place and reflect the protagonist's emotional journey.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a reflective and descriptive language style, using rich imagery and sensory details to create an immersive experience. Use a mix of long, flowing sentences and short, impactful phrases to mirror the protagonist's internal state.\n  - Use dialogue sparingly but effectively, ensuring each exchange carries significant emotional weight. Incorporate metaphors and similes to enhance the emotional resonance, such as describing the \"familiar face as a ghost from the past\" to convey the protagonist's feelings of nostalgia and longing.\n</story_rules>",
