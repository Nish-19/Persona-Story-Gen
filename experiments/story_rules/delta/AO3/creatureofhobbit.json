    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The new prompt involves a post-apocalyptic setting, a protagonist named Jonas, and themes of loss, hope, and survival. The rules will need to guide the narrative to explore these themes deeply, using the graveyard as a central symbol and incorporating elements of suspense and emotional depth. I will ensure the rules are actionable, specific, and include examples that align with the prompt's objectives.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative around Jonas's journey through the graveyard, using it as a metaphor for his internal struggle with loss and hope. Begin with Jonas entering the graveyard, reflecting on the names he recognizes, and use this moment to introduce his backstory and the people he has lost.\n  - Develop a central conflict that revolves around Jonas's search for signs of life and his internal battle between despair and hope. For example, describe Jonas finding a fresh flower on a grave, sparking a moment of hope that someone he knows might still be alive.\n  - Conclude the story with an open-ended resolution, where Jonas finds a clue suggesting the possibility of survival, leaving the reader with a sense of hope and uncertainty.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use the graveyard as a symbolic and atmospheric setting, infusing it with elements of mystery and suspense. Describe the graveyard as a place where the past and present collide, with overgrown paths and weathered headstones telling stories of the world before the apocalypse.\n  - Incorporate elements of magical realism or subtle hints of the supernatural to enhance the theme of hope. For instance, describe Jonas hearing whispers in the wind that sound like the voices of his lost loved ones, blurring the line between reality and imagination.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop Jonas as a complex character, focusing on his emotional journey and resilience. Use internal monologue to explore his thoughts and feelings about the people he has lost and his determination to find them.\n  - Create a vivid and immersive setting by describing the graveyard in detail, using sensory language to evoke the desolation and eeriness of the post-apocalyptic world. For example, describe the sound of rustling leaves and the sight of crumbling headstones to enhance the atmosphere.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a reflective and somber tone, using rich, descriptive language to convey Jonas's emotional state and the atmosphere of the graveyard. Use metaphor and symbolism to deepen the narrative, such as describing the graveyard as \"a sea of memories, each name a wave crashing against the shores of his mind.\"\n  - Use a close third-person perspective to allow the reader to experience Jonas's journey intimately, focusing on his internal thoughts and emotions. For example, describe Jonas's internal conflict as \"a battle between the shadows of despair and the flickering light of hope.\"\n  - Incorporate dialogue sparingly, using it to reveal Jonas's memories and connections to the people he has lost. When used, ensure dialogue serves to enhance the emotional depth and complexity of the narrative.\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The new prompt involves themes of the afterlife, unresolved issues, and the tension between following rules and pursuing freedom. The rules will need to reflect these themes while providing actionable guidance for storytelling.\n\n1. **Plot**: The plot should focus on the dynamics among the ghosts, their attempts to cross over, and the impact of one ghost's escape. The narrative should explore the emotional and psychological effects of being trapped and the temptation to break the rules.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The story should incorporate imaginative elements related to the afterlife and the high school setting. The ghosts' unique abilities and limitations should be creatively explored, adding depth to the narrative.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: Characters should be developed through their interactions and backstories, revealing their motivations and unresolved issues.

Describe the familiar yet haunting hallways, where echoes of past laughter and footsteps linger, to create an immersive setting.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a tone that balances nostalgia with tension, using descriptive language to convey the ghosts' emotional states and the eerie atmosphere of the high school.

Incorporate phrases that evoke the passage of time and the weight of unfinished business.\n</story_rules>",
