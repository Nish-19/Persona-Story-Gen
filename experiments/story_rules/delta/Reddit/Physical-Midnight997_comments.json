    "<thinking>\nTo generate the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as tone, plot structure, character development, and language use. The few-shot examples often blend humor with serious themes, use unexpected twists, and focus on character dynamics and internal conflicts. The new prompt involves a humorous yet dark scenario with a prophecy and a chosen one, which suggests a blend of fantasy and comedy. The rules will need to guide the narrative to explore themes of destiny, impatience, and the absurdity of prophecy, while maintaining a light-hearted tone. I will ensure the rules are specific, actionable, and include examples that align with the prompt's unique elements.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Start the story with a direct confrontation between the parent and the mysterious figure, using dialogue to introduce the prophecy and the absurdity of the situation. For example, have the parent exclaim, \"Why are you giving my newborn baby a dagger?!\" to immediately set the scene.\n  - Develop the plot around the mysterious figure's impatience and desire to fulfill the prophecy, creating tension and humor as they attempt to explain their actions. Use the figure's centuries-long wait as a comedic element, such as them saying, \"I've been waiting centuries for this moment, and frankly, I'm tired.\"\n  - Conclude with a resolution that subverts the prophecy, such as the baby innocently disarming the figure with a smile, highlighting the unpredictability of destiny.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Infuse the narrative with humor and irony, using the figure's nonchalant attitude towards their own demise as a comedic element. For instance, have them casually mention, \"It's not every day you meet your destined killer, especially in diapers.\"\n  - Explore the theme of destiny with a satirical twist, questioning the logic and fairness of prophecies. Use the figure's eagerness to meet their fate as a way to poke fun at the concept of predetermined destinies.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the mysterious figure as a weary yet resigned character, whose centuries of waiting have left them jaded but oddly enthusiastic about their fate. Use their dialogue to reveal their personality, such as them saying, \"Honestly, I've had a good run. Let's see what the kid's got.\"\n  - Create a setting that contrasts the mundane with the fantastical, such as a typical nursery with a mystical aura. Use descriptions to highlight the juxtaposition, like \"The nursery was filled with the usual baby paraphernalia, but the air shimmered with an ancient magic.\"\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use a conversational and humorous tone, employing witty dialogue and internal monologue to engage the reader. For example, have the parent think, \"Of all the things to inherit, a prophecy wasn't on the baby registry.\"\n  - Incorporate vivid descriptions and playful language to enhance the comedic and fantastical elements. Use phrases like \"the dagger gleamed ominously in the soft glow of the nightlight\" to add depth and humor to the narrative.\n</story_rules>",
