    "<thinking>\nTo generate the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as tone, narrative structure, and character dynamics. The few-shot examples often blend humor with fantasy or supernatural elements, using a conversational tone and vivid imagery. They also focus on character development through dialogue and interactions, often incorporating unexpected twists or subversions of typical genre tropes. \n\nFor the new prompt, the rules will need to emphasize the juxtaposition of the character's perception of themselves versus how they are perceived by others, using humor and irony. The setting should be vividly described to enhance the fantastical elements, and the language should maintain a balance between casual dialogue and descriptive narrative to reflect the character's genuine concern about their perceived evilness. \n\nI will ensure the rules are comprehensive, covering plot, creativity, character and setting development, and language use, with detailed examples inspired by the few-shot demonstrations. The rules will be actionable and specific, avoiding comparative terms, to guide the LLM in crafting a narrative that aligns with the prompt's themes and tone.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a scene that establishes the character's environment and their position of power, such as sitting on a skull throne. Use dialogue to introduce the central conflict: the character's concern about being perceived as evil. For example, have the character ask their demonic bodyguard, \"Do you think I look evil?\" to highlight their genuine concern.\n  - Develop the plot by exploring the character's interactions with their subordinates and the reactions of those around them. Use these interactions to reveal the character's internal conflict and the contrast between their self-perception and others' perceptions.\n  - Conclude the narrative with a humorous or ironic twist that reinforces the theme of misunderstood intentions. For instance, have the character inadvertently perform a kind act that further confuses their identity as an \"evil\" figure.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use humor and irony to subvert typical villain tropes, portraying the character as genuinely concerned about their image. Incorporate unexpected elements, such as the character's attempts to appear less intimidating, like adjusting their posture on the skull throne.\n  - Introduce imaginative details that enhance the fantastical setting, such as the demonic bodyguard's unique features or the throne's intricate design. Use these elements to add depth and intrigue to the narrative.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the main character as a multidimensional figure who is both powerful and insecure about their reputation. Use dialogue and internal monologue to reveal their personality and motivations, such as their desire to be seen as more than just \"evil.\"\n  - Create a vivid setting that reflects the character's status and environment, using detailed descriptions of the throne room and its decor. For example, describe the skull throne as \"ornately carved with ancient runes and polished to a sinister sheen.\"\n  - Characterize the demonic bodyguard with a mix of loyalty and bemusement, using their reactions to highlight the main character's quirks and concerns.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a conversational and humorous tone, using dialogue to convey the character's genuine concern and the absurdity of their situation. For example, use phrases like \"Evil? What makes you think I'm evil?\" to emphasize the character's disbelief.\n  - Use vivid and descriptive language to create an immersive setting, incorporating sensory details that enhance the narrative's atmosphere. For instance, describe the throne room's \"dimly lit ambiance, with flickering torches casting eerie shadows on the stone walls.\"\n  - Balance casual dialogue with descriptive narrative to maintain engagement and provide depth to the story. Use rhetorical devices such as irony and understatement to enhance the humor and thematic elements.\n</story_rules>",
