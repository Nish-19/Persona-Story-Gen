    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify the style, structure, and level of detail used. The demonstrations emphasize a focus on character motivations, political intrigue, and the use of metaphor and symbolism. They also highlight the importance of vivid setting descriptions and a formal, descriptive language style. For the new prompt, which involves themes of destiny, leadership, and resistance, I will ensure the rules reflect these elements while providing actionable guidance and examples.\n\nThe new prompt suggests a narrative centered around conflict between perceived destiny and personal conviction. The protagonist is determined to prevent a man, supposedly chosen by the stars, from leading due to his ambition. This sets the stage for a story rich in internal and external conflict, political maneuvering, and exploration of themes like fate versus free will.\n\nI will structure the rules under the categories of Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use, ensuring each rule is specific, actionable, and accompanied by examples that align with the prompt's themes and tone.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Start the story by establishing the protagonist's deep-seated belief in their own vision and the threat posed by the supposed leader. Use an internal monologue to reveal the protagonist's fears and determination. For example, describe the protagonist reflecting on past sacrifices made to build their legacy.\n  - Develop the plot through a series of strategic confrontations and alliances. Show the protagonist gathering support from key figures who also doubt the chosen leader's capabilities. For instance, depict a tense meeting where the protagonist persuades a skeptical ally to join their cause.\n  - Conclude with a climactic confrontation where the protagonist challenges the leader's legitimacy, using evidence of their incompetence. Ensure the resolution leaves room for ambiguity about the true influence of the stars.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use celestial imagery and symbolism to explore themes of destiny and leadership. For example, describe the stars as \"cold, distant judges\" whose decisions are questioned by those on the ground.\n  - Incorporate elements of irony and fate, such as the leader's reliance on omens despite their lack of true leadership qualities. Present scenarios where the leader's actions inadvertently undermine their own authority.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as a complex character driven by a mix of fear, ambition, and a genuine desire to protect their legacy. Use flashbacks to reveal their journey and the stakes involved. For example, show a memory of a pivotal moment when the protagonist first realized the leader's ambition.\n  - Describe the setting as a kingdom on the brink of change, with tensions simmering beneath the surface. Use the environment to reflect the protagonist's internal struggle, such as a stormy night symbolizing turmoil and uncertainty.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a formal and evocative language style, using vivid descriptions and metaphors to convey the story's themes. For example, describe the leader's ambition as \"a wildfire, consuming all in its path without regard for the ashes left behind.\"\n  - Use dialogue to reveal character motivations and advance the plot. Ensure conversations are charged with tension and subtext, reflecting the high stakes of the narrative.\n  - Maintain a deliberate pacing, allowing for the gradual build-up of tension and conflict. Use rhetorical devices such as foreshadowing and dramatic irony to engage the reader and enhance the story's depth.\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the style, structure, and level of detail in the few-shot demonstrations. The prompt presents a humorous and fantastical scenario involving a heroic adventurer's seemingly absurd motivations. The rules should reflect a blend of humor, fantasy, and character-driven narrative, focusing on the adventurer's motivations and the reactions of the Guild Leader. The examples should illustrate the absurdity and charm of the adventurer's actions, while maintaining a coherent and engaging plot. The rules will be organized into the specified categories, ensuring they are actionable and specific to the prompt's themes and tone.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Start the story with the adventurer's arrival at the guild, setting the stage for the Guild Leader's incredulous reaction. Use dialogue to highlight the contrast between the adventurer's grand achievements and his trivial motivation. For example, have the Guild Leader recount the adventurer's feats with increasing disbelief, culminating in the question about impressing a girl.\n  - Develop the plot by exploring the adventurer's journey through flashbacks or anecdotes, revealing how each feat was accomplished. Ensure each story is tied back to the adventurer's singular motivation, adding layers of humor and irony. For instance, describe how the adventurer stumbled upon the Dragon King's lair while searching for a rare flower to gift the girl.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use humor and irony to enhance the narrative, playing on the absurdity of the adventurer's motivations. For example, depict the adventurer's nonchalant attitude towards his heroic deeds, focusing instead on his romantic aspirations.\n  - Incorporate fantastical elements that exaggerate the adventurer's feats, such as magical artifacts or mythical creatures, to create a whimsical tone. Describe how the adventurer used a \"lucky charm\" that turned out to be a powerful relic, inadvertently aiding in his victories.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the adventurer as a charming yet oblivious character, whose actions are driven by a sincere yet misguided desire to impress. Use internal monologues to reveal his thoughts and feelings, such as his daydreams about the girl he wishes to impress.\n  - Describe the guild setting as a bustling hub of adventurers, using it to contrast the adventurer's unique story with the more conventional tales of heroism. For example, depict the Guild Leader's office filled with trophies and maps, emphasizing the adventurer's unexpected achievements.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a light-hearted and conversational language style, using witty dialogue and playful descriptions to convey the story's humor. For example, describe the adventurer's armor as \"more dented than a bard's lute after a tavern brawl.\"\n  - Use dialogue to reveal character dynamics and advance the plot, ensuring the Guild Leader's incredulity and the adventurer's earnestness are clearly conveyed. For instance, have the Guild Leader interrupt the adventurer's tales with sarcastic remarks, highlighting the absurdity of the situation.\n  - Maintain a brisk pacing, allowing for quick transitions between the adventurer's past exploits and the present conversation. Use rhetorical devices such as hyperbole and understatement to enhance the comedic effect and engage the reader.\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>\nTo create the Story Rules for the new writing prompt, \"What do you mean, your planet doesn't have dragons? Every inhabited planet has dragons!\", I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify the style, structure, and level of detail used in crafting the rules. The few-shot demonstrations emphasize a structured approach with categories such as Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. Each category includes specific, actionable rules with examples that align with the writing prompt's themes and narrative potential.\n\nFor this new prompt, the rules will need to focus on the fantastical and humorous elements inherent in the concept of dragons being a universal constant. The plot should explore the implications of a planet without dragons, while creativity should highlight the whimsical and imaginative aspects of such a universe. Character and setting development should focus on the cultural and societal impact of dragons, and language use should employ a playful and engaging tone.\n\nI will ensure that each rule is independent, actionable, and includes examples that illustrate how to apply the rule in the context of the new writing prompt. The rules will be comprehensive, covering all relevant narrative aspects to guide the storytelling process effectively.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Start the story with a character from a dragon-inhabited planet expressing disbelief upon learning that another planet lacks dragons. Use this revelation to drive the narrative forward, exploring the cultural and societal differences between the two planets. For example, have the character exclaim, \"How do you even celebrate Dragon Day without dragons?\"\n  - Develop the plot by introducing a quest or mission to understand why the planet lacks dragons. This could involve a journey to discover hidden truths or ancient myths. For instance, the characters might embark on a journey to find the last dragon egg rumored to be hidden on the planet.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use imaginative descriptions and scenarios to highlight the uniqueness of a universe where dragons are commonplace. For example, describe a bustling marketplace where dragons of all sizes and colors are as common as pets.\n  - Incorporate elements of humor and whimsy, such as misunderstandings or cultural faux pas related to dragons. For instance, a character might mistakenly assume that a large lizard is a dragon, leading to comedic confusion.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters by exploring their relationships with dragons and how these relationships shape their identities and cultures. For example, depict a character who is a renowned dragon rider, revered for their bond with a legendary dragon.\n  - Describe the setting with vivid details that emphasize the integration of dragons into everyday life. For instance, illustrate a city where dragons are used for transportation, with dragon landing pads on every rooftop.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a playful and engaging tone, using light-hearted dialogue and descriptive language to convey the fantastical elements of the story. For example, describe a dragon's scales as \"shimmering like a thousand tiny rainbows in the sunlight.\"\n  - Use dialogue to reveal character personalities and cultural differences, ensuring the narrative perspective captures the wonder and curiosity of discovering a planet without dragons. For instance, a character might say, \"No dragons? That's like a sky without stars!\"\n  - Maintain a dynamic pacing that balances action, humor, and exploration, using rhetorical devices such as irony and hyperbole to enhance the storytelling. For example, exaggerate the importance of dragons in society to emphasize the absurdity of a planet without them.\n</story_rules>"
