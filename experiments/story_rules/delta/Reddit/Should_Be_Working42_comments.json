    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as tone, structure, and narrative style. The few-shot examples often blend humor with unexpected twists, use imaginative settings, and develop characters through dialogue and interactions. The new prompt involves a humorous and unexpected scenario where a supposedly easy dungeon frightens a powerful monster. This calls for a comedic and light-hearted approach, focusing on the absurdity of the situation and the reactions of characters involved.\n\nI will ensure the rules are organized into the specified categories: **Plot**, **Creativity**, **Development (Character and Setting)**, and **Language Use**. Each rule will be actionable, specific, and include examples that align with the prompt's themes and tone. The examples will draw inspiration from the few-shot demonstrations, emphasizing humor, character dynamics, and imaginative settings.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a humorous setup that establishes the dungeon's reputation as \"coughing baby easy.\" Use dialogue or a character's internal monologue to highlight the dungeon's mundane nature. For example, have a character say, \"Even my little brother uses this place to practice his ABCs.\"\n  - Introduce the conflict with the sudden appearance of the frenzied super monster. Describe its initial confidence and subsequent terror upon realizing its location. Use this moment to create a comedic contrast between the monster's fear and the dungeon's reputation.\n  - Conclude the narrative with a humorous twist that leaves the characters and readers questioning the true nature of the dungeon. For instance, have a character suggest, \"Maybe there's more to this place than meets the eye,\" as they watch the monster flee.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Infuse the story with imaginative elements that play on the contrast between the dungeon's reputation and the monster's reaction. Use whimsical descriptions, such as \"the dungeon's walls adorned with crayon drawings and snack wrappers,\" to emphasize its perceived harmlessness.\n  - Incorporate fantastical elements that add depth to the setting, such as enchanted toys or magical training dummies that inadvertently scare the monster. Use these elements to enhance the story's humor and absurdity.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through their reactions to the monster's unexpected fear. Portray them as initially nonchalant or dismissive, then increasingly curious or amused. Use dialogue to reveal their personalities and relationships, such as a seasoned adventurer chuckling, \"I guess even monsters have their off days.\"\n  - Create a vivid setting by describing the dungeon's playful and unthreatening atmosphere. Use sensory details to paint a picture of the environment, such as \"the faint smell of cookies and the sound of children laughing echoing through the halls.\"\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a light-hearted and humorous tone, using playful language and witty dialogue to engage the reader. Use phrases like \"the monster's eyes widened comically\" to emphasize the absurdity of the situation.\n  - Maintain a conversational narrative style, incorporating asides and humorous observations to enhance the comedic effect. Use descriptive language to create a vivid and engaging atmosphere, focusing on the contrast between the dungeon's reputation and the monster's reaction.\n</story_rules>",
