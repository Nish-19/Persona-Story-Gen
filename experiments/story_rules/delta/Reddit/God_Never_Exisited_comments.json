    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key storytelling elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The new prompt involves themes of alternate realities, memory, and survival, which require a focus on introspection, tension, and the psychological impact of the protagonist's experiences. The rules will need to guide the narrative towards exploring the protagonist's awareness of their unique situation and the implications of remembering their past deaths. I will ensure the rules are actionable, specific, and include examples that align with the prompt's themes and tone.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with the protagonist experiencing a near-death event, immediately transitioning to the moment they realize they have shifted to a new universe. Use this realization to create an immediate sense of tension and urgency. For example, describe the protagonist narrowly avoiding a car accident, only to find themselves standing safely on the sidewalk, aware of the shift.\n  - Develop the plot by focusing on the protagonist's attempts to navigate their new reality while grappling with the memories of their past deaths. Introduce a series of challenges that test their understanding of this phenomenon, such as encountering familiar faces who don't recognize them.\n  - Conclude with the protagonist making a significant decision about how to live with this knowledge, leaving room for ambiguity about the nature of their existence. For instance, have them choose to embrace their new life, despite the uncertainty of future shifts.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Explore the concept of alternate realities by incorporating unique and unexpected differences in each new universe. Use these differences to challenge the protagonist's assumptions and create a sense of wonder and disorientation. For example, introduce a world where technology is more advanced, or societal norms are drastically different.\n  - Infuse the narrative with introspective and philosophical elements, prompting the protagonist to question the nature of life, death, and identity. Use their internal monologue to explore these themes deeply, such as pondering the meaning of their continued existence across universes.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist through their internal conflict and emotional responses to their situation. Use their memories of past deaths to reveal their fears, regrets, and desires, creating a complex and relatable character. For example, show their struggle with survivor's guilt or the longing for connections lost in previous lives.\n  - Create settings that reflect the subtle and overt differences between universes, using sensory details to highlight these changes. Describe familiar locations with slight alterations that unsettle the protagonist, such as a favorite caf\u00e9 with a different menu or a city skyline with unfamiliar buildings.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a reflective and introspective tone, using rich, evocative language to convey the protagonist's emotional and psychological state. Use sensory details and metaphors to enhance the narrative's depth and complexity. For example, describe the protagonist's heart racing as they recall the sensation of their last death, using vivid imagery to capture their fear and confusion.\n  - Use first-person perspective to provide an intimate view of the protagonist's thoughts and experiences, allowing the reader to connect deeply with their journey. Focus on their internal dialogue and emotional responses to create an immersive narrative experience.\n</story_rules>",
