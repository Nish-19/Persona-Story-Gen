    "<thinking>\nTo generate the Story Rules for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The few-shot examples often begin with an engaging introduction that sets the stage for the main conflict, followed by a development that introduces unique and imaginative elements. Characters are developed through their interactions and the setting is vividly described to enhance the narrative. Language use is typically vivid and descriptive, with a mix of dialogue and internal monologue to reveal character traits and advance the plot. \n\nFor the new prompt, the rules will need to focus on the unexpected arrival of a demon in a roleplaying game setting, the humorous and surreal nature of the situation, and the interactions between the characters and the demon. The plot should explore the group's initial shock and eventual acceptance of the demon, while creativity should focus on blending fantasy elements with the mundane setting of a gaming session. Character development will highlight the dynamics within the group and their reactions to the demon, and language use will employ a humorous and engaging tone to reflect the absurdity of the situation.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with the group settling into their usual gaming session, setting a relaxed and familiar tone. Introduce the gamemaster's discovery of the old book and his decision to read from it as a lighthearted moment. For example, \"As the group gathered around the table, dice clattering and character sheets rustling, Mark, the gamemaster, grinned as he pulled out an old, dusty tome he'd found in his attic.\"\n  - Develop the plot by describing the sudden and unexpected appearance of the demon, capturing the group's shock and disbelief. Use this moment to introduce the main conflict and the demon's surprising request to join the game. For example, \"A swirling vortex of smoke and fire erupted in the center of the room, and from it emerged a towering demon, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly light. 'I heard there's a game,' it rumbled, 'and I'd like to play.'\"\n  - Conclude the story with the group accepting the demon as part of their session, exploring the humorous and unexpected dynamics that arise. Leave room for future adventures or challenges involving the demon. For example, \"As the demon rolled its first dice, the group exchanged glances, a mix of fear and excitement in their eyes. This was going to be a session to remember.\"\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Blend elements of fantasy and humor to create a unique and engaging narrative. Use the demon's presence to introduce imaginative and unexpected twists to the gaming session. For example, \"The demon, surprisingly adept at roleplaying, brought a new level of realism to the game, its deep voice narrating epic battles and magical encounters with uncanny detail.\"\n  - Incorporate unique and whimsical elements, such as the demon's unfamiliarity with human customs or its unexpected gaming skills, to add depth and humor to the story. For example, \"Despite its fearsome appearance, the demon struggled with the concept of snacks, gingerly picking up a potato chip with its massive claws.\"\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the characters through their reactions to the demon's arrival and their interactions during the gaming session. Highlight their personalities and dynamics within the group. For example, \"Sarah, the group's strategist, was the first to recover, her analytical mind already considering how to incorporate the demon into their campaign.\"\n  - Create an immersive setting by describing the gaming room and the atmosphere before and after the demon's arrival. Use sensory details to enhance the reader's experience. For example, \"The room, once filled with the soft glow of table lamps and the scent of pizza, now crackled with an electric energy, the air tinged with the faint smell of brimstone.\"\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use a humorous and engaging tone to reflect the absurdity and excitement of the situation. Employ vivid descriptions and witty dialogue to bring the characters and setting to life. For example, \"Mark's voice wavered as he tried to maintain his composure, 'Well, uh, welcome to the game, Mr. Demon. Do you have a character sheet?'\"\n  - Balance dialogue and narrative to maintain a brisk and entertaining pace. Use internal monologue to reveal characters' thoughts and feelings, adding depth to their reactions. For example, \"As the demon settled into its chair, the group couldn't help but wonder if this was the start of a new chapter in their gaming adventures\u2014or the end of the world as they knew it.\"\n</story_rules>",
