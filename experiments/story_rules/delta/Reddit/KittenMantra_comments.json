    "<thinking>\nTo generate the Story Rules for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The few-shot demonstrations emphasize a blend of speculative fiction with psychological or philosophical undertones, often incorporating elements of suspense, humor, or introspection. They also focus on character dynamics and the implications of fantastical elements on personal and societal levels.\n\nFor the new prompt, the rules will need to address the interaction between the protagonist and the genie, focusing on the tension and humor in their exchange. The narrative should explore the hypothetical nature of the wish and its potential consequences, using creativity to expand on the implications of such a wish. Character development will focus on the protagonist's curiosity and the genie's cautious demeanor, while the setting should enhance the fantastical and humorous tone. Language use will need to balance humor with philosophical undertones, using dialogue to drive the narrative and reveal character dynamics.\n\nI will ensure the rules are comprehensive, actionable, and include detailed examples inspired by the few-shot demonstrations, aligning with the new writing prompt's themes and narrative potential.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with an immediate focus on the protagonist's curiosity and the genie's cautious demeanor.

For example, end with the protagonist pondering the genie's warnings and the nature of desire.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Integrate elements of speculative fiction and humor, using the genie's abilities to explore philosophical themes. For instance, create imaginative scenarios that illustrate the wish's potential consequences, such as altering reality or time.\n  - Use the genie's character to introduce fantastical elements and provide a humorous counterpoint to the protagonist's curiosity. Incorporate witty dialogue and imaginative descriptions to enhance the story's tone.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as curious and slightly impulsive, using their interactions with the genie to reveal their personality.

For instance, depict the former master losing his newfound wealth due to an unforeseen loophole in his wish.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Infuse the narrative with elements of dark humor and irony, using the genie's manipulation of the wishes to highlight the folly and greed of the masters.

Use internal monologue to reveal the genie's thoughts and motivations, such as their disdain for the masters' greed.\n  - Establish a rich and immersive setting that reflects the story's magical and moral themes. Use detailed descriptions of the auction house and the opulent surroundings of the new master to contrast with the genie's previous hopes for the lamp's placement.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a witty and sardonic tone, using clever wordplay and irony to enhance the narrative's humor and moral undertones. For example, use phrases like \"a wish well spent\" to underscore the genie's manipulation.\n  - Use vivid and descriptive language to create a sense of wonder and magic, focusing on the genie's powers and the fantastical outcomes of the wishes.
