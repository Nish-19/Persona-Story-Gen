    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The new prompt involves a dystopian scenario where humanity has reverted to natural selection by removing safety features, which requires a tone that balances dark humor with social commentary. The rules will need to guide the narrative to explore the implications of this societal shift, focusing on the protagonist's experiences and the broader societal impact. Examples will be inspired by the few-shot demonstrations, ensuring they are specific and actionable. The rules will be organized into the specified categories, providing comprehensive guidance for storytelling. \n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a vivid depiction of a world without safety features, using a specific incident to illustrate the immediate consequences. For example, describe a character navigating a staircase without handrails, narrowly avoiding a fall.\n  - Structure the narrative around the protagonist's journey through this new world, highlighting their internal conflict and adaptation to the lack of safety. Use a series of escalating incidents to build tension and explore the societal impact of this change.\n  - Conclude with a moment of realization or irony, where the protagonist reflects on the absurdity and harshness of the new societal norms. Avoid a neat resolution, instead leaving the reader with a sense of unease and contemplation.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use dark humor and satire to critique the societal shift towards natural selection. Incorporate absurd scenarios that highlight the dangers and ironies of a world without safety features, such as a public service announcement that cheerfully explains the benefits of \"natural selection.\"\n  - Explore the theme of survival in a modern context, using creative scenarios to illustrate the challenges and absurdities faced by individuals. For example, depict a character's internal monologue as they navigate a city filled with potential hazards.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as a relatable and resourceful character, whose experiences reflect the broader societal changes. Use their internal monologue and interactions with others to reveal their thoughts and emotions.\n  - Create a detailed and immersive setting that emphasizes the absence of safety features. Use vivid descriptions to convey the dangers and challenges of the environment, such as open manholes and unguarded construction sites.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a tone that balances dark humor with social commentary, using witty and ironic language to highlight the absurdity of the situation. For example, describe a character's near-miss with a falling object as \"a close call with Darwin's approval.\"\n  - Use descriptive language to create a vivid and immersive narrative, focusing on the sensory experiences and emotional responses of the protagonist.
