    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key storytelling elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The new prompt involves themes of magic, curiosity, and the contrast between mastery and initial attempts. The rules will need to guide the narrative to explore these themes, using examples to illustrate the protagonist's journey from novice to expert. The rules will be structured to ensure they are actionable, specific, and aligned with the prompt's objectives, incorporating detailed examples inspired by the few-shot demonstrations.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a scene that captures the protagonist witnessing a masterful display of magic, sparking their curiosity and desire to learn. For example, describe the protagonist watching a seasoned mage effortlessly conjure a storm, igniting their determination to master the spell themselves.\n  - Develop the plot around the protagonist's journey to replicate the spell, focusing on their initial struggles and gradual improvement. Use a series of attempts to build tension and highlight the learning process, such as the protagonist's first attempt resulting in a harmless but chaotic burst of wind.\n  - Conclude with a moment of self-reflection or realization, where the protagonist acknowledges the value of perseverance and the lessons learned from their failures. This could be depicted through a successful, albeit imperfect, execution of the spell that demonstrates their growth.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Explore the theme of mastery versus initial attempts by incorporating imaginative and unexpected outcomes during the protagonist's practice sessions. For instance, have the protagonist accidentally summon a rain of colorful confetti instead of a storm, adding humor and creativity to the narrative.\n  - Use magical elements to symbolize the protagonist's emotional journey, such as a spellbook that changes color based on their confidence level. This can add depth and visual interest to the story.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as a determined and curious individual, driven by a desire to understand and master the spell. Use internal monologue and interactions with a mentor or peer to reveal their motivations and personality.\n  - Set the story in a vibrant and dynamic magical academy or workshop, filled with enchanting details that reflect the protagonist's journey. Describe the setting with sensory details, such as the scent of burning herbs or the hum of magical energy, to create an immersive experience.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a descriptive and engaging tone, using vivid imagery to convey the protagonist's experiences and the magical environment. For example, describe the spell's effects with phrases like \"a whirlwind of shimmering sparks\" to capture the reader's imagination.\n  - Use dialogue to reveal character dynamics and advance the plot, ensuring it reflects the protagonist's growth and determination. For instance, include a mentor's encouraging words or a peer's teasing remarks to add depth to the interactions.\n</story_rules>",
