    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The new prompt involves a villain who has defeated the hero and questions the value of love and friendship compared to the power of an eldritch god. This suggests a narrative that explores themes of power, isolation, and the potential consequences of forsaking human connections for supernatural strength.\n\n1. **Plot**: The plot should focus on the aftermath of the villain's victory, exploring their internal conflict and the consequences of their choices. The narrative should include a pivotal moment where the villain's beliefs are challenged, leading to a potential change or reinforcement of their perspective.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The story should creatively explore the concept of eldritch power, using unique and imaginative descriptions to convey its otherworldly nature. The narrative should also incorporate elements of irony and dark humor, reflecting the villain's complex relationship with power and isolation.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The villain should be developed as a complex character with a nuanced perspective on power and relationships. The setting should reflect the eldritch theme, using vivid and unsettling imagery to enhance the story's atmosphere.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The language should be evocative and atmospheric, using rich descriptions and a tone that balances darkness with irony. Dialogue should reveal character motivations and internal conflicts, while maintaining a sense of tension and intrigue.\n\nI will now generate the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, ensuring they are comprehensive, actionable, and enriched with examples inspired by the few-shot demonstrations.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with the villain's immediate reaction to their victory over the hero, emphasizing their sense of triumph and the power they wield. For example, describe the villain standing over the defeated hero, basking in the eldritch energy coursing through them.\n  - Develop the plot by exploring the villain's internal conflict and the consequences of their choices. Introduce a moment where the villain's beliefs are challenged, such as encountering a remnant of the hero's influence that sparks doubt or introspection.\n  - Conclude the narrative with a resolution that either reinforces the villain's commitment to power or hints at a potential change in perspective. Use a climactic event, like an unexpected manifestation of the eldritch power, to drive the resolution.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use imaginative and vivid descriptions to convey the eldritch power's otherworldly nature. For example, describe the power as a swirling mass of colors and shapes that defy comprehension, evoking a sense of awe and fear.\n  - Incorporate elements of irony and dark humor to reflect the villain's complex relationship with power and isolation. For instance, have the villain make a sarcastic remark about the futility of love and friendship in the face of their newfound strength.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the villain as a complex character with a nuanced perspective on power and relationships. Use internal monologue and dialogue to reveal their motivations and internal conflicts, such as questioning the true cost of their victory.\n  - Create a setting that reflects the eldritch theme, using vivid and unsettling imagery to enhance the story's atmosphere. For example, describe the environment as warped and distorted by the eldritch energy, with shadows that move independently and colors that shift unnaturally.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ evocative and atmospheric language to create a rich and immersive narrative. Use descriptive language to convey the eldritch power's presence and the villain's emotional state, such as \"The air crackled with an unnatural energy, and the villain's eyes glowed with an unholy light.\"\n  - Use dialogue to reveal character motivations and internal conflicts, maintaining a sense of tension and intrigue. For example, have the villain express their disdain for human connections with a line like, \"What use is love when I can bend reality to my will?\"\n</story_rules>",
