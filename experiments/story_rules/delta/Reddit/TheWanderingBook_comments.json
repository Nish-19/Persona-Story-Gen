    "<thinking>\nTo generate the Story Rules for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The new prompt involves a sudden armistice and collaboration between former enemies due to a dragon sighting, which suggests themes of urgency, tension, and cooperation against a common threat. The rules will need to reflect these themes while providing detailed guidance on how to develop the narrative, characters, and setting. I will ensure the rules are actionable, specific, and include examples that align with the prompt's objectives, drawing inspiration from the style and structure of the few-shot demonstrations. \n\nKey elements to focus on include:\n1. **Plot**: The transition from conflict to cooperation, the dynamics in the war room, and the overarching threat of the dragon.\n2. **Creativity**: The imaginative depiction of the dragon and the unique interactions between former enemies.\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The portrayal of rival generals and the setting of the war room, emphasizing the shift from hostility to collaboration.\n4. **Language Use**: The tone should reflect urgency and tension, with vivid descriptions and dynamic dialogue.\n\nI will now craft the Story Rules, ensuring they are comprehensive and tailored to the new writing prompt. \n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with the announcement of the armistice, capturing the shock and disbelief of the characters. Use a scene where a messenger delivers the news to both sides simultaneously, emphasizing the suddenness of the truce. For example, \"The messenger's voice echoed across the battlefield, 'By order of the High Council, an immediate armistice is declared. All hostilities cease at once.'\"\n  - Develop the narrative around the tense and uneasy collaboration in the war room. Highlight the initial distrust and gradual cooperation between rival generals. For example, \"General Armand and General Kira exchanged wary glances across the table, their hands hovering over the map of the dragon's last known location.\"\n  - Conclude with a unified plan to confront the dragon, showcasing the newfound alliance and the urgency of the threat. For example, \"With a final nod of agreement, the generals sealed their pact, their combined forces ready to face the dragon.\"\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use imaginative descriptions to bring the dragon to life, emphasizing its size, power, and the awe it inspires. For example, \"The dragon's scales shimmered like molten gold in the sunlight, its wings casting a shadow over the valley as it soared through the sky.\"\n  - Incorporate unique interactions between former enemies, highlighting their differing perspectives and skills. For example, \"General Kira, known for her cunning strategies, proposed a diversion tactic, while General Armand, a master of brute force, suggested a direct assault.\"\n  - Introduce creative elements such as ancient prophecies or magical artifacts that play a role in the plan against the dragon. For example, \"The generals consulted the ancient scrolls, seeking guidance from the prophecies that foretold the dragon's return.\"\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the rival generals as complex characters with distinct backgrounds and motivations. Use their interactions to reveal their personalities and the grudging respect they develop for each other. For example, \"Armand, a veteran of countless battles, found himself admiring Kira's quick wit and adaptability.\"\n  - Create an immersive setting for the war room, using detailed descriptions to convey the tension and urgency. For example, \"The war room was a hive of activity, maps and charts strewn across the table, the air thick with the scent of ink and sweat.\"\n  - Highlight the transformation of the setting from a place of conflict to one of collaboration, emphasizing the shift in atmosphere. For example, \"The once-hostile war room now buzzed with a sense of purpose, as former enemies worked side by side.\"\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use a tone that reflects urgency and tension, with dynamic dialogue and vivid descriptions. For example, \"The generals' voices rose and fell in heated debate, the urgency of their task driving them to find common ground.\"\n  - Employ varied sentence structures to maintain a brisk pace and convey the intensity of the situation. For example, \"Maps were unfurled, strategies debated, alliances forged in the heat of necessity.\"\n  - Use descriptive language to create a vivid and immersive narrative, focusing on the dragon and the war room. For example, \"The dragon's roar echoed through the mountains, a sound that sent shivers down the spines of even the bravest warriors.\"\n  - Incorporate rhetorical devices such as repetition and parallelism to emphasize key themes and moments. For example, \"Enemies turned allies, distrust turned to trust, all for the sake of survival against the dragon's wrath.\"\n</story_rules>",
