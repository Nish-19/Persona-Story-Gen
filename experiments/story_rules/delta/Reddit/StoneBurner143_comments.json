    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as tone, narrative style, and the use of humor and creativity. The few-shot examples often blend humor with fantasy or surreal elements, using a conversational tone and vivid imagery. They focus on character development through internal monologue and interactions with the setting, often incorporating a twist or unexpected resolution. The language is typically rich and descriptive, with a focus on creating an immersive and engaging narrative.\n\nFor the new prompt, the rules will need to reflect the unique blend of logic and fantasy, focusing on the protagonist's intellectual prowess and the surreal nature of their prey. The plot should revolve around the protagonist's internal and external challenges, with a focus on the humor and absurdity of using logic to combat cosmic entities. The creativity rules will emphasize the imaginative use of logic and reasoning as a weapon. Character and setting development will focus on the protagonist's unique skills and the bizarre nature of the eldritch abominations. Language use will need to balance technical precision with vivid, surreal descriptions.\n\nI will ensure each rule is actionable, specific, and includes examples inspired by the few-shot demonstrations, tailored to the new writing prompt's themes and narrative potential.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a humorous and surreal encounter between the protagonist and an eldritch abomination.

Use metaphors and similes to create a rich and immersive narrative.\n  - Use a conversational and humorous tone, with rhetorical devices such as irony and hyperbole to enhance the story's humor and engage the reader.
