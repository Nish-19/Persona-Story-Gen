For example, depict a futuristic city where holographic images of the series' characters are displayed alongside high-tech infrastructure.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a narrative style that captures the grandeur and mystique of the religion. Use formal and reverent language when describing religious ceremonies and texts, contrasting with more casual language in everyday interactions.\n  - Use vivid and evocative descriptions to bring the world to life, focusing on the sensory details of the religious practices and the sci-fi setting.
