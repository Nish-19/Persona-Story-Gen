    "<thinking>\nTo generate the Story Rules for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify the style, structure, and level of detail used in crafting the rules. The few-shot demonstrations emphasize a blend of humor, absurdity, and modern elements with fantasy or crime themes. They also focus on character dynamics, setting contrasts, and witty dialogue. For the new prompt, which involves a crime scene with a mysterious and potentially humorous twist, I will ensure the rules reflect a balance of suspense, dark humor, and detailed character interactions. The examples will illustrate how to incorporate these elements effectively, maintaining the tone and narrative style inferred from the few-shot demonstrations.\n</thinking>\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Start the story with the discovery of the crime scene, using the prompt to set a tone of intrigue and dark humor. For example, have the detective express disbelief at the sheer number of wounds, comparing it to a bizarre art project.\n  - Introduce a partner or colleague to the detective to provide banter and differing perspectives on the case. Use their interactions to explore theories and add humor.\n  - Develop the plot by having the characters investigate the area, encountering quirky witnesses or suspects who provide misleading or humorous information.\n  - Conclude with an unexpected twist, such as discovering the victim was part of a bizarre ritual or a prank gone wrong, leaving the reader with a mix of amusement and curiosity.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Incorporate elements of dark humor and absurdity in the investigation process. For instance, have the detective find a clue that is both ridiculous and oddly fitting, like a rubber chicken with a knife.\n  - Use creative descriptions of the crime scene and evidence to enhance the story's unique tone. Describe the weapons used in the crime as an eclectic collection, ranging from antique swords to kitchen knives.\n  - Introduce an unusual setting for the crime, such as a themed festival or a historical reenactment, to add layers of complexity and humor to the narrative.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the detective as a seasoned professional with a dry sense of humor, using their observations and comments to reveal their personality. For example, have them make sarcastic remarks about the absurdity of the crime.\n  - Create a dynamic between the detective and their partner, highlighting their contrasting approaches to the investigation. Use their dialogue to explore their relationship and add depth to the story.\n  - Set the story in a vibrant, bustling neighborhood with a mix of eccentric residents. Use the setting to introduce colorful characters and unexpected interactions that drive the plot forward.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use a blend of formal and informal language to reflect the professional yet humorous tone of the investigation. Incorporate police jargon alongside witty banter to create a balanced narrative voice.\n  - Write sharp, engaging dialogue that captures the characters' personalities and the story's dark humor. For example, have the detective quip about needing a \"murder weapon bingo card\" to keep track of the evidence.\n  - Employ vivid and imaginative descriptions to bring the crime scene and characters to life. Use metaphors and similes to enhance the story's humor and intrigue, such as comparing the crime scene to a \"macabre art installation.\"\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify the style, structure, and level of detail used. The prompt suggests a narrative that challenges assumptions about Wood Elves and their relationship with Nature, hinting at a deeper, possibly darker understanding of Nature's true essence. The rules will need to guide the creation of a story that explores this theme, using vivid descriptions, character development, and a tone that balances the serene with the potentially menacing aspects of Nature. The examples will illustrate how to convey these elements effectively, ensuring the story remains engaging and thought-provoking.\n</thinking>\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Start the story by introducing the common misconception about Wood Elves being peaceful and harmless. Use this as a setup to delve into the true nature of their relationship with Nature.\n  - Develop a narrative that reveals the complexity and duality of Nature, showing both its nurturing and ruthless sides. For example, depict a scene where a Wood Elf uses natural elements to defend their forest, showcasing Nature's power.\n  - Introduce a conflict where outsiders threaten the harmony of the Wood Elves' environment, prompting them to reveal their true capabilities. Use this conflict to drive the plot and highlight the theme of misunderstood strength.\n  - Conclude with a resolution that reinforces the idea that harmony with Nature includes understanding and respecting its darker aspects. For instance, end with a scene where the outsiders gain a newfound respect for the Wood Elves and their environment.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Incorporate elements of fantasy and folklore to enrich the narrative. Use mythical creatures or enchanted forests to create a vivid and immersive setting.\n  - Explore the theme of Nature's duality by creating scenarios that juxtapose beauty with danger. For example, describe a serene forest that suddenly transforms into a formidable barrier against intruders.\n  - Use imaginative descriptions to convey the Wood Elves' unique abilities and their deep connection with Nature. Illustrate how they can communicate with animals or manipulate plant life to their advantage.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the Wood Elves as complex characters who embody both the gentle and fierce aspects of Nature. Use their actions and decisions to reveal their true nature.\n  - Create a rich setting that reflects the harmony and power of Nature. Describe the forest in detail, highlighting its beauty and potential for danger.\n  - Introduce characters who challenge the Wood Elves' way of life, serving as catalysts for revealing the true nature of the Elves and their environment. Use these characters to create tension and drive the narrative forward.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use descriptive and evocative language to paint a vivid picture of the setting and characters. Employ sensory details to immerse the reader in the world of the Wood Elves.\n  - Balance serene and ominous tones in the narrative to reflect the duality of Nature. Use contrasting imagery to highlight the beauty and danger present in the story.\n  - Write dialogue that reflects the wisdom and depth of the Wood Elves, using poetic and philosophical language to convey their understanding of Nature. For example, have a Wood Elf explain the necessity of balance in Nature with a metaphor about the cycle of life and death.\n</story_rules>",
