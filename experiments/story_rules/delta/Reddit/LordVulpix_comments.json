    "<thinking>\nTo generate the Story Rules for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as tone, structure, and narrative style. The demonstrations often blend humor with a unique twist on traditional themes, using character interactions to drive the plot. The rules should reflect a balance of humor and creativity, focusing on the protagonist's perspective and their interactions with family members. The examples should illustrate the protagonist's attempts to differentiate their adventurous lifestyle from the negative connotations associated with grave robbing, using humor and vivid descriptions to enhance the narrative.\n\nThe rules will be organized into categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. Each category will include specific, actionable instructions with examples that align with the new writing prompt's themes and objectives. The rules will be written in the second person to ensure they are direct and actionable for a language model to follow.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a humorous and tense family conversation where the protagonist defends their career choice as a dungeon crawler. Use this scene to introduce the central conflict and set the tone for the narrative.\n  - Develop the plot through a series of comedic misunderstandings and clarifications, as the protagonist attempts to explain the nuances of dungeon crawling to their skeptical parents. For example, include a scene where the protagonist describes a recent adventure, emphasizing the excitement and danger involved, contrasting it with the mundane image of grave robbing.\n  - Conclude the story with a resolution that highlights the protagonist's passion and determination, perhaps with a humorous twist where the parents gain a newfound respect or understanding of their child's career.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use creative and imaginative descriptions of dungeon crawling adventures to differentiate them from grave robbing. Incorporate elements like mythical creatures, enchanted artifacts, and ancient puzzles to enhance the fantastical aspect of the narrative.\n  - Introduce unique and humorous scenarios that arise from the protagonist's career, such as accidentally bringing home a cursed item or having a pet mimic. These elements should add depth and humor to the story, illustrating the protagonist's adventurous lifestyle.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as a passionate and slightly exasperated individual who is determined to pursue their adventurous career despite familial misunderstandings. Use their dialogue and internal monologue to reveal their motivations and frustrations.\n  - Create a vivid setting that contrasts the protagonist's adventurous world with the mundane family home. Use descriptions of the protagonist's gear and trophies from their adventures to highlight the disparity between their two worlds.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a humorous and conversational tone throughout the narrative, using witty dialogue and playful descriptions to engage the reader. For example, use phrases like \"No, mom, the skeletons are already dead when I get there!\" to inject humor into the protagonist's explanations.\n  - Use vivid and imaginative language to describe the protagonist's adventures, creating a sense of excitement and wonder. Ensure the language reflects the protagonist's enthusiasm and the fantastical nature of their career.\n  - Incorporate rhetorical devices such as irony and hyperbole to enhance the comedic effect and highlight the protagonist's perspective. Use these devices to emphasize the absurdity of the parents' misconceptions and the protagonist's attempts to clarify their career.\n</story_rules>",

Use detailed descriptions of the archmage's tower and magical artifacts to emphasize the protagonist's out-of-place presence. For example, describe the protagonist's awe and confusion when faced with a room full of enchanted objects.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a humorous and ironic tone, using witty dialogue and playful descriptions to engage the reader. Use the protagonist's internal monologue to convey their disbelief and self-deprecating humor.\n  - Use vivid and imaginative language to describe magical elements and settings, enhancing the story's fantastical atmosphere.
