    "<thinking>\nTo generate the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The new prompt involves a humorous and fantastical twist on military surveillance, incorporating elements from the fictional world of Middle-earth. The rules must reflect this blend of military precision and whimsical fantasy, ensuring a seamless integration of these themes.\n\n1. **Plot**: The plot should revolve around a military briefing that takes an unexpected turn with the revelation of surveillance on Hobbits. The narrative should explore the implications of this discovery, maintaining a balance between the seriousness of military operations and the absurdity of spying on a fictional world.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The story should creatively blend real-world military jargon with fantastical elements from Middle-earth. This includes using humor to highlight the absurdity of the situation and incorporating references to Tolkien's world in a way that feels natural within the military context.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: Characters should be developed through their reactions to the revelation, showcasing a mix of professionalism and disbelief. The setting should be a military command center, described with both realistic and fantastical elements to reflect the dual nature of the narrative.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The language should employ a formal military tone interspersed with humorous and fantastical elements. Dialogue should be sharp and witty, capturing the contrast between the serious and the absurd.\n\nWith these insights, I will craft the **Story Rules** to guide the narrative development for the new writing prompt, ensuring they are actionable and enriched with examples inspired by the few-shot demonstrations.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a formal military briefing, setting a serious tone as the General discusses satellite surveillance.
