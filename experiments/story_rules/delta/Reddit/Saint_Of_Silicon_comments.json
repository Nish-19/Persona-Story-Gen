    "<thinking>\nTo create the Story Rules for the new writing prompt, \"An alien swarm species crashes down on a fantasy world,\" I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify the style, structure, and level of detail used in crafting Story Rules. The rules must be specific to the new prompt, incorporating its themes of alien invasion and fantasy elements. I will ensure the rules are actionable, detailed, and include examples that align with the narrative potential of the prompt. The categories will be organized into Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use, providing comprehensive guidance for storytelling.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the narrative with the sudden and dramatic arrival of the alien swarm, disrupting the existing balance of the fantasy world. Describe the initial chaos and confusion among the inhabitants as they witness the crash.\n    - Example: \"The sky tore open with a blinding light, and the ground trembled as the alien swarm descended upon the enchanted forest, leaving the elves and dwarves in a state of shock and awe.\"\n  - Develop the plot by exploring the interactions between the alien swarm and the fantasy world's inhabitants. Introduce conflicts and alliances as both sides attempt to understand each other's intentions and capabilities.\n    - Example: \"The dragon riders, initially hostile, found themselves forming an uneasy alliance with the swarm to combat a greater threat awakened by the crash.\"\n  - Conclude with a resolution that reflects the integration or separation of the alien and fantasy elements, leaving room for future exploration or coexistence.\n    - Example: \"As the swarm adapted to the magical energies of the realm, a new era of symbiosis began, with both species learning to thrive together.\"\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Incorporate imaginative elements that blend science fiction with fantasy, such as alien technology interacting with magic. Create unique scenarios where these elements influence each other in unexpected ways.\n    - Example: \"The swarm's bio-mechanical constructs began to absorb and channel the world's ley lines, creating a fusion of technology and magic that reshaped the landscape.\"\n  - Explore the cultural and philosophical implications of the alien presence on the fantasy world, using creative storytelling to highlight differences and similarities.\n    - Example: \"The swarm's hive mind struggled to comprehend the concept of individual heroism, a cornerstone of the fantasy world's culture, leading to intriguing exchanges and growth.\"\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters from both the alien swarm and the fantasy world, focusing on their perspectives and motivations. Highlight the contrast between the swarm's collective consciousness and the individualistic nature of the fantasy inhabitants.\n    - Example: \"Zylar, a swarm leader, found itself fascinated by the human bard's tales, which were unlike anything in the swarm's collective memory.\"\n  - Create a richly detailed setting that combines elements of both science fiction and fantasy. Describe how the alien crash site transforms the environment and affects the local flora and fauna.\n    - Example: \"The once serene valley now buzzed with alien flora, glowing with an eerie luminescence, as the swarm's influence seeped into the soil and air.\"\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use descriptive and vivid language to convey the fantastical and otherworldly aspects of the story. Employ a mix of technical and mystical terminology to reflect the fusion of genres.\n    - Example: \"The air crackled with arcane energy as the swarm's crystalline structures hummed in harmony with the ancient runes etched into the mountainside.\"\n  - Maintain a tone that balances wonder and tension, capturing the awe of discovery and the fear of the unknown. Use a narrative style that immerses the reader in the duality of the setting.\n    - Example: \"In the heart of the enchanted forest, where magic danced with every breeze, the alien swarm's presence was both a marvel and a menace, a testament to the universe's boundless mysteries.\"\n</story_rules>",

    "<thinking>\nTo craft the Story Rules for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify the style, structure, and level of detail used. The few-shot demonstrations emphasize a structured approach to plot development, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. Each category is addressed with specific, actionable rules accompanied by illustrative examples. The new writing prompt involves a psychological and introspective theme, focusing on the protagonist's unique mental state and interaction with a villain. The rules will need to reflect this psychological depth, the dynamic between the protagonist and the villain, and the darkly humorous or ironic tone suggested by the prompt.

Use the protagonist's unique mental state as a source of unexpected strength and humor.\n    - Example: Have the protagonist internally joke about how the villain's attempts at psychological warfare are akin to their morning routine.\n  - Explore the concept of normalcy in the protagonist's mind, contrasting it with the villain's expectations. Use creative metaphors to depict the protagonist's mental landscape.\n    - Example: Describe the protagonist's mind as a chaotic yet familiar storm, where the villain's whispers are just another gust of wind.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as a complex character with a unique mental resilience. Use their internal dialogue to reveal their thoughts and personality.\n    - Example: Show the protagonist reflecting on past experiences that shaped their mental state, providing depth to their character.\n  - Create a setting that reflects the psychological tension of the encounter. Use atmospheric details to enhance the mood and tone of the narrative.\n    - Example: Set the scene in a shadowy, echoing chamber that mirrors the protagonist's mind, filled with whispers and echoes.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use a blend of introspective and ironic language to convey the protagonist's mental state and perspective.
