    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The new prompt involves a mythological and imaginative narrative about toys becoming the first gods, powered by children's belief. This requires a blend of fantasy, historical context, and emotional depth. The rules will need to guide the creation of a story that explores the origins of divine power through the lens of childhood imagination and belief.\n\n1. **Plot**: The plot should explore the transformation of a toy into a god, driven by the belief of children. It should include a journey or migration, highlighting the toy's role in protecting and comforting children. The narrative should culminate in the toy's ascension to godhood, reflecting the power of belief.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The story should creatively blend elements of mythology and childhood imagination. It should explore the concept of belief as a source of divine power, using imaginative descriptions of the toy's transformation and its interactions with children.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The toy should be developed as a central character, with distinct traits and a personality that endears it to children. The setting should evoke a sense of ancient times, with vivid descriptions of the migratory lifestyle and the challenges faced by the children and their families.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The language should be evocative and poetic, capturing the wonder and innocence of childhood. It should use vivid imagery and emotional depth to convey the power of belief and the transformation of the toy into a god.\n\nI will now generate the **Story Rules** based on these insights, ensuring they are actionable, specific, and enriched with examples inspired by the few-shot demonstrations.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a scene depicting children during a long migration, highlighting their reliance on a beloved toy for comfort and protection.

Include moments where the toy seems to exhibit inexplicable powers, hinting at its growing divinity.\n  - Conclude with the toy's transformation into a god, powered by the unwavering belief of the children. Illustrate this moment with a dramatic event, such as the toy glowing with an ethereal light, symbolizing its ascension and the birth of the first god.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Infuse the narrative with imaginative elements that blend mythology and childhood wonder. Describe the toy's transformation with vivid and fantastical imagery, such as the toy sprouting wings or emitting a protective aura.\n  - Explore the theme of belief as a source of divine power, using creative metaphors and symbolism. For instance, depict the children's belief as a tangible force, like a shimmering thread connecting them to the toy, fueling its transformation.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the toy as a central character with distinct traits and a personality that resonates with the children.
