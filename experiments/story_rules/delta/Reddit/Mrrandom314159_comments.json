    "<thinking>\nTo generate the Story Rules for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as narrative structure, tone, and thematic depth. The prompt involves themes of immortality, cosmic events, and existential judgment, which require a blend of philosophical exploration and character introspection. The rules will need to guide the narrative through a complex interplay of cosmic scale and personal stakes, ensuring the protagonist's journey is both grand and deeply personal. I will incorporate examples that reflect the protagonist's internal conflict and the council's authoritative presence, using vivid language to convey the vastness of the universe and the weight of immortality. The rules will be structured to provide comprehensive guidance on plot, creativity, character and setting development, and language use, ensuring they are actionable and specific to the prompt's unique narrative potential.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with the protagonist standing before the council, setting the stage for the central conflict. Use this moment to introduce the council's declaration and the protagonist's immediate reaction. For example, \"The council's words echoed in the vast chamber, each syllable a hammer striking the anvil of my existence.\"\n  - Develop the narrative through a series of flashbacks and introspective moments, revealing the protagonist's past actions and the choices that led to the current judgment. Highlight the tension between the protagonist's understanding of immortality and the council's criteria.\n  - Conclude with a moment of introspection or revelation, where the protagonist must confront their own understanding of life, death, and rebirth. Avoid a clear resolution, instead leaving the reader with a sense of ongoing existential exploration.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Incorporate cosmic and philosophical elements to explore themes of immortality and universal rebirth. Use imaginative descriptions of cosmic events and the protagonist's experiences across different universes. For example, \"I had watched stars collapse and galaxies dance in the void, yet the council saw only the end, not the rebirth.\"\n  - Use symbolic imagery to convey the protagonist's internal struggle and the grandeur of the universe. For instance, describe the council chamber as a microcosm of the universe, with swirling galaxies and nebulae reflected in its walls.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as a complex and introspective character, revealing their thoughts and emotions through internal monologue and interactions with the council. Show their struggle to reconcile their actions with the council's judgment.\n  - Create a richly detailed setting that reflects the cosmic scale of the narrative. Describe the council chamber with vivid imagery, emphasizing its otherworldly and awe-inspiring nature. For example, \"The chamber was a cathedral of stars, its ceiling a tapestry of constellations that whispered the secrets of the cosmos.\"\n  - Develop the council as an enigmatic and authoritative presence, using their dialogue and actions to convey their power and the weight of their judgment.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a formal and philosophical tone, using rich and evocative language to convey the story's themes. Use metaphors and similes to enhance the narrative's depth and complexity. For example, \"Their words were like the tolling of a cosmic bell, resonating through the fabric of my being.\"\n  - Use varied sentence structures to control the pacing and build tension. Alternate between long, descriptive passages and short, impactful sentences to reflect the protagonist's internal conflict and the grandeur of the universe.\n  - Incorporate rhetorical questions and reflective statements to engage the reader and emphasize the protagonist's introspection. For instance, \"What is immortality if not the endless cycle of death and rebirth? And what am I, if not a witness to the universe's eternal dance?\"\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>\nTo generate the Story Rules for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key storytelling elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The new prompt involves themes of leadership, destiny, and resistance against a seemingly predestined path. The protagonist is determined to prevent a man, falsely believed to be chosen by the stars, from leading and potentially destroying what they have built. The narrative should focus on the protagonist's internal and external struggles, the tension between fate and free will, and the dynamics of power and ambition.\n\n1. **Plot**: The plot should revolve around the protagonist's efforts to undermine the supposed leader, exploring themes of destiny versus self-determination. The narrative should include moments of tension and conflict, as well as the protagonist's strategic maneuvers to protect their legacy.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The story should creatively explore the concept of celestial omens and the protagonist's skepticism. It should incorporate imaginative elements that highlight the contrast between the mystical belief in the stars and the protagonist's grounded perspective.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The protagonist should be developed as a strong, determined individual with a deep connection to what they have built. The setting should reflect the grandeur and mysticism associated with celestial omens, contrasting with the protagonist's pragmatic approach.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The language should be rich and evocative, capturing the tension between destiny and free will. It should include vivid descriptions and metaphors related to the stars and leadership, as well as sharp, decisive dialogue that reflects the protagonist's determination.\n\nI will now craft the Story Rules, ensuring they are specific, actionable, and aligned with the new writing prompt, incorporating examples inspired by the few-shot demonstrations.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a public announcement or ceremony where the man is declared the chosen leader by the stars. Use this event to introduce the protagonist's internal conflict and skepticism. For example, \"As the crowd cheered, I felt a chill run down my spine. The stars had spoken, but I knew their message was wrong.\"\n  - Develop the plot around the protagonist's strategic efforts to prevent the man from taking power. Include scenes of political intrigue, secret meetings, and alliances. For instance, \"I met with the council in the dead of night, our whispers echoing in the stone chamber as we plotted our next move.\"\n  - Incorporate moments of tension and conflict, such as confrontations with the man or his supporters. Highlight the protagonist's determination and the stakes involved. For example, \"He stood before me, eyes gleaming with ambition. 'You can't stop destiny,' he sneered. But I knew I had to try.\"\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use celestial imagery and symbolism to explore the theme of destiny versus free will. Describe the stars and their supposed messages in a mystical and evocative manner. For example, \"The stars twinkled above, a tapestry of fate woven across the night sky. But I saw only chaos in their patterns.\"\n  - Incorporate imaginative elements that highlight the protagonist's skepticism, such as their reliance on logic and reason over mystical beliefs. For instance, \"While others saw omens in the constellations, I saw only distant suns, indifferent to our struggles.\"\n  - Create a unique and immersive world where celestial omens hold significant power, contrasting with the protagonist's grounded perspective. Use this contrast to enhance the narrative's tension and depth.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as a strong, determined individual with a deep connection to their legacy. Use internal monologue and interactions with other characters to reveal their motivations and fears. For example, \"I had built this city from the ground up, brick by brick. I couldn't let it fall into the hands of a false leader.\"\n  - Establish a setting that reflects the grandeur and mysticism associated with celestial omens. Describe the city and its surroundings in vivid detail, highlighting the contrast between the mystical and the pragmatic. For instance, \"The city sprawled beneath the stars, its towers reaching for the heavens. But beneath the celestial glow, shadows lurked, hiding secrets and lies.\"\n  - Develop secondary characters, such as allies and adversaries, with distinct traits and motivations. Use their interactions with the protagonist to explore themes of power, ambition, and loyalty.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ rich and evocative language to capture the tension between destiny and free will. Use vivid descriptions and metaphors related to the stars and leadership. For example, \"His ambition burned like a comet, bright and destructive, threatening to consume all in its path.\"\n  - Use sharp, decisive dialogue to reflect the protagonist's determination and resolve. Ensure the dialogue advances the plot and reveals character dynamics. For instance, \"I won't let you destroy what I've built,' I said, my voice steady and unwavering.\"\n  - Incorporate rhetorical devices and figures of speech to enhance the narrative's literary quality. Use metaphors, similes, and personification to create vivid and memorable descriptions. For example, \"The stars were silent witnesses, their light cold and distant, as if mocking our struggles below.\"\n</story_rules>",
