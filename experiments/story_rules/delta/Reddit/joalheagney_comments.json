    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The demonstrations emphasize humor, irony, and unexpected twists, often using dialogue to reveal character dynamics and plot developments. They also incorporate imaginative elements and blend modern and fantastical settings. For the new prompt, I will focus on the themes of deception, unexpected challenges, and the protagonist's adaptation to their new role. The rules will guide the narrative to explore the contrast between expectations and reality, using humor and creativity to engage the reader. I will ensure the rules are actionable, specific, and include examples that align with the prompt's themes and objectives.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with the protagonist's arrival at the colony, using vivid descriptions to highlight the stark contrast between their expectations and the reality of the situation. For example, describe the protagonist stepping off a ship, expecting bustling streets and grand architecture, only to be greeted by dilapidated shacks and overgrown paths.\n  - Structure the narrative around the protagonist's investigation into the colony's true state, using a series of reports and interactions with locals to uncover the truth. Introduce a twist where the reports were intentionally misleading, perhaps due to a previous governor's attempt to cover up their failures.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Incorporate imaginative elements that highlight the absurdity of the situation, such as bizarre local customs or unexpected natural phenomena that the protagonist must navigate. For instance, describe a local festival where the townspeople celebrate by painting the buildings with mud, adding to the shoddy appearance.\n  - Use humor and irony to explore the protagonist's attempts to improve the colony, such as implementing grand plans that are met with confusion or resistance from the locals who have adapted to their unique way of life.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as a well-meaning but naive figure, initially overwhelmed by the challenges of their new role. Use their interactions with quirky and eccentric locals to reveal their growth and adaptation to the colony's realities.\n  - Establish the setting as a character in itself, with its own history and quirks that influence the narrative. Use detailed descriptions of the environment, such as the weathered buildings and untamed landscape, to create a vivid and immersive backdrop.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a conversational and humorous tone, using witty dialogue and internal monologue to convey the protagonist's thoughts and reactions. For example, use phrases like \"This can't be the right place... can it?\" to capture their disbelief and confusion.\n  - Use irony and sarcasm to enhance the comedic elements of the story, particularly in the protagonist's interactions with the locals and their attempts to implement changes. Ensure the language remains engaging and accessible, with a focus on creating a lighthearted and entertaining narrative.\n</story_rules>",

The few-shot demonstrations emphasize humor, irony, and a blend of fantasy with modern elements. They also focus on dialogue-driven narratives, character dynamics, and unexpected twists. For the new prompt, I will ensure the rules reflect the themes of secrecy, identity, and adaptation, while incorporating humor and creativity.

Use a minor incident, such as stopping a petty crime, to introduce the protagonist's adapted use of their powers.\n  - Develop the narrative around the protagonist's efforts to maintain their secret identity, incorporating humorous situations where their true powers almost get revealed. For example, have the protagonist use their super strength to discreetly fix a broken fence, only for a neighbor to comment on how quickly it was repaired.\n  - Conclude with a twist that challenges the protagonist's secrecy, such as a new villain arriving in town who recognizes the hero's unique fighting style, forcing the protagonist to confront their past.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Reimagine the protagonist's powers in a mundane context to maintain their cover. For instance, if the hero has the ability to fly, depict them using it to discreetly hang holiday decorations on tall trees, making it appear as if they are using a ladder.\n  - Incorporate humorous and ironic elements by having the protagonist's powers inadvertently cause small-town gossip or misunderstandings. For example, a sudden gust of wind from their super breath could be mistaken for a freak weather event, leading to amusing speculation among townsfolk.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as a complex character who balances their heroic instincts with the desire for a peaceful retirement. Use internal monologue to reveal their thoughts and feelings about their past and present life.\n  - Create a vibrant small-town setting with quirky residents who add depth and humor to the story. Use interactions with these characters to highlight the protagonist's attempts to blend in, such as participating in local events or helping with community projects.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a conversational and humorous tone, using witty dialogue and internal monologue to convey the protagonist's personality and the story's lighthearted nature. For example, use phrases like \"Just another day of not being a hero\" to reflect the protagonist's internal conflict.\n  - Use descriptive language to vividly portray the small-town setting and the protagonist's adapted use of their powers. Ensure the language captures the charm and idiosyncrasies of the town, enhancing the story's comedic and engaging atmosphere.\n</story_rules>",
