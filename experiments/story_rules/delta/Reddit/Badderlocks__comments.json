    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The few-shot demonstrations emphasize starting with immediate tension, using humor and irony, developing characters through dialogue and internal monologue, and employing a conversational tone. For the new prompt, I will focus on the unique relationship between the stowaway and the ship, the humorous and tense dynamic between the protagonist and the ship, and the use of vivid language to convey the ship's personality and reactions. I will ensure the rules are actionable, specific, and include examples that align with the prompt's themes and tone.\n</thinking>\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with the discovery of the stowaway, creating immediate tension and intrigue. Use the protagonist's internal monologue to express their frustration and disbelief at the situation. For example, start with, \"I couldn't believe my eyes when I found him lounging in the cargo hold, chatting away with the ship like old friends.\"\n  - Develop the plot through a series of humorous and tense interactions between the protagonist, the stowaway, and the ship. Use these interactions to explore the ship's unique personality and its bond with the stowaway. For instance, describe a scene where the ship creaks ominously when the protagonist threatens the stowaway, highlighting its displeasure.\n  - Conclude the story with a resolution that emphasizes the protagonist's acceptance of the stowaway and the ship's newfound friendship. Use a light-hearted tone to convey the protagonist's reluctant agreement, such as, \"With a sigh, I realized I had no choice but to welcome our unexpected guest.\"\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Subvert expectations by portraying the ship as a sentient and emotionally expressive character. Use its reactions to add depth and humor to the narrative. For example, describe the ship's sails fluttering like a bird's wings when it's pleased.\n  - Incorporate elements of fantasy and whimsy, such as the ship's ability to communicate through creaks and groans, to enhance the story's imaginative quality. Use these elements to create a unique and engaging world.\n  - Use the stowaway's charm and resourcefulness to add complexity to the narrative. For instance, have him share stories of his adventures that endear him to the ship and eventually to the protagonist.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as a pragmatic and somewhat exasperated character, using their internal monologue and interactions with the stowaway and the ship to reveal their personality. Highlight their initial reluctance and eventual acceptance of the situation.\n  - Portray the stowaway as charismatic and likable, using dialogue and actions to show how he quickly wins over the ship. For example, have him compliment the ship's craftsmanship, earning a pleased creak in response.\n  - Create a vivid setting by describing the ship's interior and its interactions with the characters. Use sensory details, such as the sound of the waves and the creaking of the wood, to immerse the reader in the maritime environment.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a humorous and conversational tone, using witty dialogue and internal monologue to convey the protagonist's exasperation and the ship's personality. For example, use lines like, \"The ship groaned louder than my patience could handle.\"\n  - Use vivid and descriptive language to bring the ship to life, emphasizing its sentience and emotional responses. For instance, describe the ship's timbers shivering in delight when the stowaway tells a particularly good story.\n  - Balance dialogue with internal monologue to provide insight into the protagonist's thoughts and feelings, creating a rich and engaging narrative. Use rhetorical questions and exclamations to enhance the humor and tension, such as, \"How did I end up with a ship that had a mind of its own?\"\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as tone, plot structure, character development, and language use. The few-shot examples often employ humor, subversion of expectations, and a focus on character dynamics. They also use a mix of dialogue and internal monologue to drive the narrative. For the new prompt, I will ensure the rules reflect a comedic and ironic tone, focusing on the absurdity of the situation and the unexpected behavior of the deity. The rules will guide the LLM to create a narrative that highlights the contrast between the cultists' actions and the deity's true intentions, using humor and character interactions to explore the theme. I will include specific examples to illustrate each rule, ensuring they are actionable and align with the prompt's unique elements.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Start the story with the protagonist's capture, using a humorous and ironic tone to set the stage for the absurdity of the situation. For example, describe the protagonist's bewilderment as they are dragged into the cult's lair, thinking, \"This is not how I planned my Tuesday.\"\n  - Develop the plot through a series of comedic misunderstandings and interactions between the protagonist, the cultists, and the deity. Use dialogue to reveal the deity's frustration with the cultists' methods, such as the deity exclaiming, \"Do you think tying people up is a good recruitment strategy?\"\n  - Conclude the story with a humorous resolution, where the protagonist inadvertently becomes the deity's spokesperson, tasked with rebranding the cult. For instance, end with the protagonist saying, \"So, we're thinking less torture, more cookies?\"\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Subvert typical cult and deity tropes by portraying the deity as exasperated and pragmatic, rather than malevolent. Highlight the absurdity of the cultists' actions through the deity's sarcastic remarks.\n  - Use humor and irony to explore the theme of misguided devotion. For example, have the deity roll their eyes and mutter, \"I just wanted a book club, not a torture chamber.\"\n  - Incorporate imaginative elements, such as the deity's unexpected hobbies or interests, to add depth and humor to the narrative. For instance, reveal that the deity is an avid gardener, frustrated that their followers are more interested in rituals than planting.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as a relatable and witty character, using internal monologue to convey their thoughts and reactions to the absurd situation. For example, have them think, \"I always knew I'd end up in a cult, but I hoped it would be more... voluntary.\"\n  - Portray the deity as a multidimensional character, balancing their divine authority with moments of humor and exasperation. Use dialogue to reveal their true intentions and personality.\n  - Create a setting that contrasts with the cult's dark reputation, such as a brightly lit room filled with mismatched furniture and cheerful decorations. Use the setting to reflect the deity's true nature and add to the comedic tone.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a humorous and conversational tone, using witty dialogue and internal monologue to convey the protagonist's perspective. For example, use phrases like \"This is the weirdest job interview ever\" to highlight the absurdity of the situation.\n  - Use sarcasm and irony to enhance the comedic elements of the story, particularly in the deity's interactions with the cultists. For instance, have the deity sarcastically comment, \"Yes, because nothing says 'welcome' like a good old-fashioned beating.\"\n  - Balance dialogue with vivid descriptions to create an engaging and lively narrative. Use sensory details to immerse the reader in the setting, such as describing the deity's booming voice and the cultists' nervous fidgeting.\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The few-shot examples emphasize starting with an intriguing or tense situation, using humor and irony, developing characters through dialogue and introspection, and employing a conversational tone. For the new prompt, I will focus on creating a mysterious and whimsical narrative, exploring the surreal encounter with the man on the sea floor. The rules will guide the LLM to develop a plot that balances curiosity and tension, use creative elements to enhance the surreal experience, develop characters through their interactions and reactions, and employ language that captures the wonder and oddity of the underwater encounter.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with the protagonist's initial shock and curiosity upon encountering the man on the sea floor. Use this moment to establish the central mystery and engage the reader. For example, describe the protagonist's disbelief with a line like, \"I blinked, certain the pressure was playing tricks on my eyes.\"\n  - Develop the plot through a series of interactions and observations, focusing on the protagonist's attempts to communicate with the man and understand the situation. Use gestures and non-verbal cues to drive the narrative, as the underwater setting limits verbal communication.\n  - Conclude the story with an open-ended resolution that maintains the mystery, such as the man offering a cryptic gesture or disappearing into the depths, leaving the protagonist with more questions than answers.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Embrace the surreal and whimsical nature of the encounter, using imaginative descriptions and unexpected elements to enhance the mystery. For instance, describe the man's chair as being made of coral and seaweed, adding to the fantastical atmosphere.\n  - Introduce subtle hints about the man's origin or purpose, such as unusual marine life interacting with him or ancient symbols etched into the sea floor. These elements should add depth to the mystery without providing a definitive explanation.\n  - Use the underwater setting to explore themes of isolation and discovery, highlighting the protagonist's sense of wonder and curiosity in this alien environment.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist through their internal monologue and reactions to the surreal encounter. Use their thoughts to convey a mix of fear, curiosity, and awe, as they try to make sense of the situation.\n  - Portray the man on the sea floor as enigmatic and serene, using his gestures and expressions to suggest a deeper understanding of the underwater world. For example, have him calmly wave and smile, creating a sense of calm amidst the protagonist's confusion.\n  - Create a vivid and immersive setting by describing the underwater environment in detail, focusing on the play of light, the movement of water, and the presence of marine life. Use sensory details to draw the reader into the scene, such as the \"gentle sway of kelp\" or the \"glint of sunlight filtering through the waves.\"\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a descriptive and evocative tone, using rich imagery to capture the wonder and mystery of the underwater encounter. Use phrases like \"the ocean's embrace\" to convey the setting's beauty and strangeness.\n  - Use a first-person perspective to create an intimate connection with the protagonist's experience, allowing the reader to share in their sense of discovery and bewilderment.\n  - Balance descriptive language with moments of introspection and humor, using the protagonist's internal monologue to add depth and personality to the narrative. For example, include a line like, \"I half-expected him to offer me a cup of tea, as if this were the most natural thing in the world.\"\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as tone, narrative structure, and character dynamics. The few-shot examples often blend humor, irony, and unexpected twists, which will be crucial in developing the rules for this prompt. The new prompt involves a murder investigation with a twist: the protagonist is the murderer, yet remains unsuspected. This scenario offers opportunities for dark humor, tension, and introspection, which should be reflected in the rules. I will ensure the rules are specific, actionable, and include examples that align with the prompt's themes of irony and suspense. The rules will be organized into the specified categories, providing comprehensive guidance for plot, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. Each rule will be accompanied by a concrete example to illustrate its application, inspired by the style and detail of the few-shot demonstrations.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with the protagonist's internal monologue, reflecting on the absurdity of the situation where they are the murderer yet remain unsuspected. Use this to set the tone and introduce the central conflict. For example, start with a line like, \"I watched the detectives scramble for clues, knowing full well the trail led straight to me.\"\n  - Develop the plot through a series of interactions with other characters, such as detectives and suspects, highlighting the protagonist's anxiety and disbelief at not being suspected. Use these interactions to build tension and humor, as the protagonist inadvertently provides clues that go unnoticed.\n  - Conclude the story with an ironic twist, such as the protagonist accidentally incriminating themselves in a humorous way, like leaving a confession note in plain sight that is mistaken for a shopping list.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use dark humor and irony to explore the protagonist's predicament. Highlight the absurdity of the situation through the protagonist's internal commentary and the obliviousness of the other characters. For instance, have the protagonist think, \"I couldn't have made it easier for them if I had left a map.\"\n  - Incorporate unexpected elements, such as the protagonist's attempts to subtly steer the investigation away from themselves, only to inadvertently make themselves more suspicious. Use these moments to add depth and complexity to the narrative.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as a complex character, torn between their guilt and the bizarre relief of not being suspected. Use internal monologue to explore their thoughts and emotions, such as their growing paranoia and disbelief.\n  - Create a setting that reflects the tension and irony of the situation, such as a bustling police station where the protagonist feels both exposed and invisible. Use detailed descriptions to immerse the reader in the environment, like the chaotic energy of detectives piecing together clues.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a conversational and ironic tone, using sharp dialogue and internal monologue to convey the protagonist's perspective. Use phrases that highlight the absurdity of the situation, such as \"I was practically waving a red flag, and yet, nothing.\"\n  - Use vivid and direct language to create a sense of immediacy and tension, focusing on the protagonist's internal conflict and the unfolding investigation. For example, describe the protagonist's nervousness with lines like, \"My heart raced every time they mentioned the murder weapon, which I had conveniently left in my kitchen drawer.\"\n  - Balance humor and suspense by using rhetorical questions and sarcastic remarks to enhance the narrative's tone, such as \"How could they not see it? Was I really that good, or were they just that bad?\"\n</story_rules>"
