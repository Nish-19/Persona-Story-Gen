    "<thinking>\nTo generate the Story Rules for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key storytelling elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The few-shot demonstrations emphasize starting with a strong conflict or twist, incorporating unique and imaginative elements, developing characters through interactions and settings, and using vivid, engaging language. \n\nFor the new writing prompt, the rules will need to reflect the juxtaposition of a seasoned knight with the whimsical task of guarding a princess and her teddy bear at a party. This scenario offers opportunities for humor, character development, and a blend of serious and lighthearted tones. The rules will guide the narrative to explore the knight's adaptation to this unusual task, the dynamics between the knight, the princess, and Mister Wiggles, and the setting of a royal party.\n\nI will ensure the rules are specific, actionable, and include examples that align with the prompt's themes and tone, drawing inspiration from the few-shot demonstrations to maintain consistency in style and structure.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with the knight's arrival at the royal party, setting the stage for the unusual task of guarding the princess and Mister Wiggles. Use this scene to introduce the central conflict or challenge, such as navigating the social dynamics of the party while maintaining vigilance.\n  - Develop the plot by introducing a humorous or unexpected event that tests the knight's skills in this new context. For example, have a mischievous guest attempt to \"kidnap\" Mister Wiggles, prompting the knight to use their combat skills in a non-lethal, creative way.\n  - Conclude the narrative with a resolution that highlights the knight's successful adaptation to their new role, such as earning the princess's trust and respect, and perhaps a newfound appreciation for the lighter side of life.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Incorporate whimsical and imaginative elements that contrast with the knight's serious demeanor. Use Mister Wiggles as a character with its own \"personality\" and role in the story, such as being the princess's confidant or a symbol of her innocence.\n  - Introduce a subplot involving the party's guests, such as a mysterious figure with a hidden agenda, to add depth and intrigue to the narrative. Use this subplot to challenge the knight's perception of their role and the nature of their duty.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the knight as a multidimensional character who is both formidable and capable of adapting to new challenges. Use their interactions with the princess and Mister Wiggles to reveal their softer side and capacity for growth.\n  - Create a vivid and dynamic setting by describing the opulence and grandeur of the royal party. Use sensory details to immerse the reader in the scene, such as the music, laughter, and clinking of glasses, contrasting with the knight's internal focus on duty.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a blend of formal and playful language to reflect the story's tone. Use the knight's internal monologue to convey their thoughts and reactions to the party's events, balancing seriousness with humor.\n  - Use dialogue to reveal character dynamics and advance the plot. Ensure the princess's dialogue reflects her youthful innocence and curiosity, while the knight's responses demonstrate their respect and protective nature.\n  - Maintain a dynamic pacing that balances action with introspection, using varied sentence structures to keep the narrative engaging and lively.\n</story_rules>",
