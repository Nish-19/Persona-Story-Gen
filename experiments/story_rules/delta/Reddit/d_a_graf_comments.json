    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The new prompt involves a protagonist with a unique ability working in an antique shop, where they discover a dangerous object. The rules will need to guide the narrative through suspense, the exploration of the object's history, and the protagonist's emotional journey. I will ensure the rules are specific, actionable, and include examples that align with the prompt's themes of mystery and discovery.\n\n1. **Plot**: The plot should begin with the protagonist's introduction to the antique shop and their initial use of their power. The discovery of the dangerous object should escalate the narrative, leading to a climax where the protagonist must confront the object's history and its implications.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The story should creatively explore the protagonist's ability to read objects' pasts, using this power to uncover hidden stories and secrets. The dangerous object should have a unique and intriguing history that ties into a larger narrative or mystery.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The protagonist should be developed as curious and empathetic, with a strong connection to their family and a growing sense of responsibility. The setting of the antique shop should be richly detailed, with a focus on the atmosphere and the variety of objects within it.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The language should be descriptive and immersive, using sensory details to convey the protagonist's experiences and the atmosphere of the shop.

Create tension by revealing unsettling or mysterious events associated with the object, such as a past owner's tragic fate.\n  - Build towards a climax where the protagonist must confront the object's danger, using their ability to piece together its history and find a solution. Resolve the story with a sense of closure or a new understanding, such as the protagonist deciding to safeguard the object or share its story.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use the protagonist's ability to explore the hidden stories and secrets of various objects in the shop, adding depth and intrigue to the narrative.

Ensure the object's past is intricately tied to the shop or the protagonist's family, adding layers to the story.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as curious, empathetic, and increasingly aware of their responsibility.
