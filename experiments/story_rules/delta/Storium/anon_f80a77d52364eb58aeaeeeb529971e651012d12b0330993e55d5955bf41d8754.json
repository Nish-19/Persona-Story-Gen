    "<thinking>\nTo generate the Story Rules for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The new prompt involves a secretive airship journey with a diverse group of passengers, hinting at themes of tension, mystery, and hidden agendas. The rules will need to reflect these themes, providing guidance on how to develop the plot, create an immersive setting, and use language effectively to build suspense and intrigue. I will ensure each rule is accompanied by a detailed example that aligns with the prompt's narrative objectives, drawing inspiration from the style and structure of the few-shot demonstrations.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a vivid description of the airship *Emporia* and its diverse passengers, setting the stage for the journey and hinting at underlying tensions. For example, describe the airship's sleek design and the mix of convicts, colonists, and officials boarding with varying degrees of apprehension.\n  - Structure the narrative around key events that reveal the characters' backgrounds and motivations, such as a tense dinner gathering or a sudden mechanical failure. Use these events to build suspense and foreshadow potential sabotage.\n  - Conclude the story with a climactic revelation or confrontation that exposes hidden agendas, leaving some questions unanswered to maintain intrigue. For instance, reveal a convict's secret plan to escape or an official's ulterior motive for the colony.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Incorporate imaginative elements that highlight the uniqueness of the airship and the journey, such as advanced navigation technology or mysterious cargo. Use these details to enhance the story's atmosphere and sense of mystery.\n  - Explore the cultural and historical context of the mission, weaving in elements of German colonial ambitions and the allure of uncharted territories. Use these themes to add depth and complexity to the narrative.\n  - Introduce subtle hints of sabotage through cryptic messages or unexplained incidents, creating an undercurrent of tension and suspicion among the passengers.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through detailed descriptions and interactions, focusing on their backgrounds, motivations, and relationships. For example, describe a convict's hardened demeanor and a colonist's hopeful aspirations, using dialogue to reveal their perspectives.\n  - Create an immersive setting by providing vivid descriptions of the airship's interior and the vast Pacific expanse below. Use sensory details to convey the atmosphere and mood, such as the hum of the engines and the salty sea air.\n  - Highlight the dynamics between different groups on the airship, using interactions and conflicts to reveal character traits and build tension. For instance, depict a heated argument between an official and a convict over the colony's future.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a formal and descriptive tone, using rich imagery and specific language to convey the story's atmosphere and themes. For example, describe the airship's journey as \"a voyage through the endless azure, where secrets lingered in the shadows of the hull.\"\n  - Use dialogue to reveal character motivations and build tension, ensuring that each character's voice reflects their background and role. For instance, use terse, guarded exchanges between convicts and officials to highlight underlying distrust.\n  - Maintain a narrative voice that balances suspense and intrigue, using varied sentence structures to enhance the pacing and flow of the story. Incorporate rhetorical questions and speculative language to add to the sense of mystery and uncertainty.\n</story_rules>",
