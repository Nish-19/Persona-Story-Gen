    "<thinking>\nTo generate the Story Rules for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as the narrative structure, tone, and thematic focus. The few-shot examples emphasize starting with a thematic or reflective statement, focusing on character perspectives, and using indirect storytelling to build intrigue. They also highlight the importance of setting and character development through dialogue and environmental details. The language is formal and descriptive, often using repetition and rhetorical questions to engage the reader.\n\nFor the new prompt, I will create rules that reflect the bustling and chaotic environment of Trade Station Heraklion, the mysterious nature of the salvage job, and the potential for hidden secrets and competing interests. The rules will guide the narrative to focus on the protagonist's interactions with the fixer, the unfolding mystery of the cargo, and the dynamic setting of the space station and the Rivera Belt. I will ensure the rules are actionable, specific, and include examples inspired by the few-shot demonstrations.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a vivid description of Trade Station Heraklion, capturing its bustling and chaotic atmosphere. Use sensory details to immerse the reader, such as the clamor of traders and the flickering neon signs. For example, \"The air buzzed with the hum of a thousand conversations, punctuated by the sharp crackle of intercom announcements.\"\n  - Introduce the fixer as a mysterious and enigmatic character, using subtle hints to suggest their hidden motives. Focus on the initial meeting and the offer of the salvage job, emphasizing the simplicity of the task on the surface. For instance, \"The fixer's eyes glinted with a promise of easy credits, but their smile held secrets untold.\"\n  - Develop the plot by gradually revealing complications and hidden dangers associated with the salvage job. Use foreshadowing to hint at the presence of other interested parties and the potential secrets within the cargo. \n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Incorporate elements of science fiction and mystery to enrich the narrative, such as advanced technology, alien artifacts, or encrypted data within the cargo. Use these elements to create intrigue and drive the story forward. For example, \"The cargo's manifest listed mundane supplies, but the encrypted files hinted at something far more valuable.\"\n  - Use the setting creatively to reflect the story's themes, such as the contrast between the bustling station and the desolate Rivera Belt. Highlight the isolation and danger of space to enhance the tension and stakes.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist through their interactions with the fixer and other characters, revealing their motivations and background. Use dialogue and internal monologue to provide depth and complexity. For instance, \"As the fixer spoke, you couldn't shake the feeling that this job was more than it seemed\u2014a chance to prove yourself, or perhaps a trap.\"\n  - Create an immersive setting by describing the diverse and vibrant environment of Trade Station Heraklion, as well as the eerie and treacherous landscape of the Rivera Belt. Use specific details to bring these locations to life, such as the eclectic mix of cultures on the station and the silent expanse of the asteroid field.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a formal and descriptive tone, using precise language to convey the complexity and intrigue of the narrative. Use repetition and rhetorical questions to engage the reader and emphasize key themes. For example, \"What secrets lay hidden in the cargo? And who else might be willing to risk everything to uncover them?\"\n  - Use dialogue and descriptive passages to build tension and atmosphere, focusing on the protagonist's perspective and the unfolding mystery. Ensure the language reflects the high-stakes and unpredictable nature of the salvage job.\n</story_rules>",
