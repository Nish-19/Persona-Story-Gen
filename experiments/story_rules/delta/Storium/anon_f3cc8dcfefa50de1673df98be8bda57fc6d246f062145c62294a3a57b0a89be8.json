    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as narrative structure, thematic depth, and stylistic choices. The new prompt involves a future Roman Empire with interstellar dominance and a Chinese diplomat's journey, which suggests themes of political tension, cultural clash, and personal introspection. The rules will need to reflect these themes while maintaining the detailed and immersive style seen in the few-shot demonstrations. I will ensure each category\u2014Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use\u2014provides comprehensive guidance with specific examples to illustrate the application of each rule.\n</thinking>\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with the diplomat's departure from Earth, highlighting the contrast between his homeland's past glory and its current status. Use this moment to introduce his internal conflict and set the stage for the journey.\n  - Structure the narrative around key diplomatic encounters and cultural exchanges aboard the Roman vessel. Use these interactions to build tension and explore the power dynamics between the diplomat and his Roman counterparts.\n  - Conclude with a pivotal diplomatic meeting on the Roman colony, where the diplomat must navigate a complex web of alliances and rivalries. Leave the outcome open-ended, allowing for reflection on the broader implications of the encounter.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Integrate elements of Roman and Chinese culture into the futuristic setting, such as architectural styles, clothing, and technology. For example, describe the Roman ship's interior as a blend of classical Roman design with advanced holographic interfaces.\n  - Introduce imaginative elements like a virtual reality chamber that simulates historical events, allowing the diplomat to experience the Roman Empire's rise to interstellar power firsthand.\n  - Use the setting of the Roman colony to explore themes of cultural assimilation and resistance, depicting how local customs have adapted to Roman rule.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the diplomat as a complex character, torn between his duty to his nation and the allure of Roman power. Use internal monologue to reveal his thoughts and emotions as he navigates the journey.\n  - Create a vivid setting by describing the Roman vessel and colony in detail, emphasizing the grandeur and technological prowess of the Roman Empire. Use sensory details to immerse the reader in the environment, such as the scent of incense in the ship's chapel or the hum of its engines.\n  - Introduce a diverse cast of characters, including Roman officials, other diplomats, and colonists, each with their own perspectives and motivations. Use these characters to explore the political and cultural tensions at play.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a formal and diplomatic tone, using precise and respectful language to reflect the high-stakes nature of the diplomatic mission. For example, use titles and honorifics when characters address each other to convey the formality of their interactions.\n  - Use descriptive language to convey the opulence and power of the Roman Empire, such as \"the ship's corridors gleamed with marble and gold, a testament to Rome's eternal glory.\"\n  - Incorporate cultural references and idioms from both Roman and Chinese traditions to enrich the dialogue and narrative, ensuring authenticity and depth in character interactions.\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify the style, structure, and level of detail used. The demonstrations emphasize a structured approach to plot development, creativity in blending historical and speculative elements, detailed character and setting development, and a specific tone and language use. For the new prompt, I will ensure the rules reflect the themes of post-war despair, isolation, and horror, while incorporating examples that illustrate these elements effectively. The rules will be organized into the specified categories, providing comprehensive and actionable guidance for storytelling.\n</thinking>\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with the Japanese garrison's daily routine, highlighting their struggle with the despair of surrender and the isolation of the island. Use this to set the stage for the emerging horror.\n  - Introduce the horror gradually, using the setting sun as a signal for the onset of strange occurrences. For example, describe how the jungle seems to come alive with unsettling sounds and shadows as night falls.\n  - Build tension by alternating between the soldiers' attempts to maintain order and the increasing manifestations of the horror. Conclude with a climactic event that forces the garrison to confront the horror directly, leaving the resolution ambiguous to maintain suspense.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Blend historical elements of post-WWII with supernatural horror, using the island's isolation to enhance the sense of dread. Incorporate details such as abandoned wartime equipment and relics to ground the story in its historical context.\n  - Introduce imaginative horror elements, such as a mysterious creature or force that defies explanation. For example, describe a shadowy figure that appears at the edge of the jungle, only to vanish when approached.\n  - Use the natural environment creatively to heighten the horror, such as describing how the dense jungle seems to close in on the soldiers, creating a claustrophobic atmosphere.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through their reactions to the horror and their interactions with each other. Portray the soldiers as weary and conflicted, struggling with their duty and the fear of the unknown.\n  - Use detailed descriptions to establish the setting, emphasizing the island's isolation and the oppressive nature of the jungle. For example, describe the thick canopy that blocks out the sun, casting the jungle in perpetual twilight.\n  - Highlight the psychological impact of the setting on the characters, using their internal monologues to reveal their fears and doubts. For instance, describe a soldier's growing paranoia as he hears whispers in the wind.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a tense and atmospheric tone, using descriptive language to convey the horror and isolation of the setting. Focus on sensory details, such as the rustling of leaves or the distant cries of unseen creatures.\n  - Use concise and impactful dialogue to reflect the characters' tension and fear. For example, a soldier might whisper, \"Did you hear that?\" as they peer into the darkness.\n  - Maintain a consistent tone throughout the story, using language that evokes a sense of dread and suspense. For instance, describe the jungle as a \"living entity, breathing and watching, waiting for the sun to set.\"\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The few-shot demonstrations emphasize starting in medias res, blending historical elements with futuristic settings, and using detailed descriptions to create immersive narratives. The rules should reflect the high-stakes, tension-filled atmosphere of a space confrontation, incorporating Roman cultural elements and futuristic technology. The examples will illustrate how to integrate these elements seamlessly into the narrative, ensuring the rules are actionable and specific to the new prompt.\n</thinking>\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with the task group already en route to intercept the alien fleet, highlighting the tension and urgency of the mission.
