    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify key elements such as plot structure, creativity, character and setting development, and language use. The new prompt involves a prophecy, a prepared society, and a confrontation with a resurrected evil, which suggests a blend of fantasy and humor. The rules will need to reflect the prompt's potential for irony and unexpected twists, as well as the societal and character dynamics involved in preparing for a prophesied event. I will ensure the rules are detailed, actionable, and include examples that align with the prompt's themes and tone.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with the awakening of The Great Evil, emphasizing his confusion and surprise at the prepared defenses. For example, \"The Great Evil blinked in disbelief as he emerged from his ancient tomb, only to be greeted by a sea of gleaming armor and the whirring of mechanical turrets.\"\n  - Develop the plot by showcasing the interactions between The Great Evil and the defenders, highlighting the contrast between his expectations and reality. Include moments of humor and irony, such as The Great Evil attempting to monologue only to be interrupted by a turret malfunction.\n  - Conclude the story with an unexpected resolution, such as The Great Evil deciding to negotiate or retire, subverting typical fantasy tropes. For instance, \"Realizing the futility of his situation, The Great Evil sighed and asked, 'So, do you guys have a retirement plan for ancient evils?'\"\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Incorporate elements of humor and irony, using the juxtaposition of The Great Evil's expectations with the modern defenses. For example, describe his attempts to summon dark forces, only to be thwarted by a containment field.\n  - Use imaginative and unique descriptions for the defenses, such as the automated holy turrets having personalities or quirks. For instance, \"The turret named 'Gabriel' hummed a cheerful tune as it locked onto its target.\"\n  - Explore the societal impact of the prophecy, detailing how the people have adapted and prepared over the centuries. Highlight the blend of ancient magic and modern technology in their defenses.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop The Great Evil as a complex character, showing his initial arrogance and gradual realization of his predicament. Use internal monologue to reveal his thoughts and emotions.\n  - Create a vivid setting by describing the fortified landscape and the diverse defenders. Use sensory details to bring the scene to life, such as the clinking of armor and the hum of magical barriers.\n  - Introduce secondary characters among the defenders, each with distinct traits and roles. For example, a knight who is overly enthusiastic about fulfilling the prophecy, or a mage who is skeptical of the whole affair.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use a blend of formal and humorous language to reflect the fantasy setting and the ironic tone. Employ vivid imagery and descriptive language to enhance the narrative.\n  - Write dialogue that is sharp and witty, capturing the tension and humor of the situation. For example, \"The Great Evil cleared his throat, 'I am the darkness incarnate\u2014' 'Error 404: Darkness not found,' chirped a turret.\"\n  - Maintain a consistent tone that balances the epic nature of the prophecy with the comedic elements of the story. Use varied sentence structures to keep the narrative engaging and dynamic.\n</story_rules>",

Include a mix of humor and tension as the protagonist grapples with the reality of their past decision. For instance, \"I blinked, trying to process their words. 'Father? Me?

Use internal monologue and interactions with the teenagers to reveal their growth. For example, \"I was just an ordinary guy with an extraordinary past mistake. But as I watched them, I realized I couldn't just walk away.\"\n  - Create distinct personalities and backstories for each teenager, using their powers and interactions to reveal their characters. For instance, \"The levitating boy, Max, was the most outspoken, always eager to show off his abilities, while the girl with glowing eyes, Lily, was more reserved, observing everything with a quiet intensity.\"\n  - Establish a setting that reflects the protagonist's ordinary life disrupted by extraordinary events. Use detailed descriptions to create a vivid and immersive environment. For example, \"My small apartment, once a haven of solitude, was now filled with the chaotic energy of teenagers testing their powers.\"\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use a conversational and engaging tone, mixing humor and introspection to reflect the protagonist's journey.
