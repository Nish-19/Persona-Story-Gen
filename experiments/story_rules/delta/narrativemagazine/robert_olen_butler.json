    "<thinking>\nTo generate the Story Rules for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify the style, structure, and level of detail used in crafting the rules. The new prompt involves creating a scene with historical or literary figures who are unlikely to have met, focusing on their contrasting philosophies, desires, or vulnerabilities. The rules must guide the creation of a narrative that captures the essence of these characters and their interaction, ensuring the scene is intimate or transformative.\n\nKey elements to consider include:\n1. **Plot**: The scene should focus on the interaction between the two figures, highlighting their differences and the impact of their meeting.\n2. **Creativity**: The narrative should creatively blend historical or literary contexts, using imaginative scenarios to explore the characters' philosophies and desires.\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The characters must be well-developed, with their backgrounds and philosophies clearly defined. The setting should enhance the narrative, reflecting the historical or literary context.\n4. **Language Use**: The language should reflect the time period and style of the characters, using dialogue and description to convey their philosophies and vulnerabilities.\n\nI will ensure each rule is actionable, specific, and includes examples inspired by the few-shot demonstrations, aligning with the new writing prompt's themes and objectives.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Create a scene where the two figures engage in a dialogue or shared experience that highlights their contrasting philosophies or desires. Ensure the interaction is central to the scene, driving the narrative forward.\n    - Example: Imagine a conversation between Socrates and Virginia Woolf, where Socrates questions the nature of reality and Woolf reflects on the fluidity of time and consciousness, revealing their differing views on existence.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use imaginative scenarios to bring the two figures together, blending elements from their respective historical or literary contexts. Ensure the setting and circumstances are plausible within the narrative's framework.\n    - Example: Place Leonardo da Vinci and Emily Dickinson in a dreamlike garden, where da Vinci sketches the flora while Dickinson composes poetry, each expressing their unique perspectives on beauty and creation.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop each character's background and philosophy through their dialogue and actions. Use the setting to reflect their historical or literary context, enhancing the narrative's authenticity and depth.\n    - Example: Depict Marie Curie and Sherlock Holmes in a dimly lit laboratory, where Curie's scientific curiosity contrasts with Holmes's deductive reasoning, highlighting their different approaches to discovery.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ language that reflects the time period and style of each character, using dialogue to convey their philosophies and vulnerabilities. Use descriptive language to create a vivid and immersive setting.\n    - Example: Use formal, philosophical language for a dialogue between Confucius and Jane Austen, where Confucius discusses virtue and Austen explores social manners, each revealing their cultural and philosophical differences.\n</story_rules>"
