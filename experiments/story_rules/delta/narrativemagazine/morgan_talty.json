    "<thinking>\nAnalyze the style, structure, and detailing of the examples to infer patterns and key elements. Use this analysis to determine how to craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt.\n\nThe examples provided detailed and structured rules under categories such as Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. They emphasized the importance of cultural references, humor, character backstories, vivid settings, and a mix of tones. The rules were comprehensive, actionable, and tailored to the specific themes and tones of the prompts.\n\nFor the new writing prompt about a chaotic family gathering, the rules should focus on capturing the dynamics of family relationships, the blend of love and dysfunction, and the unexpected moments that reveal deeper truths. The rules should guide the narrative to balance humor and seriousness, develop multidimensional characters, and create an immersive setting that reflects the chaos and warmth of a family gathering.\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with the protagonist arriving at the family gathering, setting the stage for the chaos to unfold.\n  - Introduce various family members and their relationships, highlighting both loving and dysfunctional dynamics.\n  - Include a series of chaotic and humorous events that escalate tensions and reveal underlying issues.\n  - Conclude with a moment of unexpected revelation or connection that brings a sense of resolution or deeper understanding.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Incorporate a mix of humor and drama, using witty dialogue and ironic situations to highlight the family's quirks.\n  - Use symbolic elements or recurring motifs to represent themes of connection and belonging.\n  - Blend realistic family interactions with exaggerated or surreal moments to emphasize the chaos and emotional intensity.\n  - Include cultural references or traditions that add depth and authenticity to the family gathering.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop multidimensional characters with distinct personalities, backstories, and motivations.\n  - Explore the protagonist's relationships with various family members, revealing both conflicts and bonds.\n  - Describe the setting vividly, capturing the sensory details of the gathering (e.g., sights, sounds, smells) to create an immersive atmosphere.\n  - Use the setting to reflect the emotional tone of the story, with chaotic and cozy elements intertwined.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a conversational and engaging narrative style, with strong character voices and dynamic dialogue.\n  - Use descriptive language to create vivid imagery and convey the chaotic energy of the gathering.\n  - Balance humor and seriousness, using shifts in tone to reflect the complexity of family relationships.\n  - Include internal monologues or reflections from the protagonist to provide insight into their thoughts and feelings.\n</story_rules>"
