    "<thinking>\nTo craft the **Story Rules** for the new writing prompt, I will analyze the few-shot demonstrations to identify the style, structure, and level of detail used in the rules. The few-shot demonstrations emphasize a deep exploration of character dynamics, emotional depth, and the use of symbolic elements to enhance narrative themes. The rules are structured into categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use, each with specific, actionable instructions and examples.\n\nFor the new prompt, the rules will focus on the themes of love, family, and self-discovery, exploring the protagonist's relationships with her son, his wife, and the neighbor. The examples will illustrate how to weave these relationships into a cohesive narrative, using symbolic elements and introspective language to reflect the protagonist's journey.\n\nThe rules will be tailored to guide the LLM in creating a narrative that captures the complexity of familial and personal relationships, using detailed character development and evocative language to convey the protagonist's emotional evolution. The examples will be inspired by the few-shot demonstrations, ensuring they align with the new prompt's themes and narrative potential.\n</thinking>\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a pivotal moment that sets the stage for Judith's journey of self-discovery, such as her first encounter with Georgia after the divorce.\n  - Develop a narrative that intertwines Judith's interactions with her son, his wife, and Georgia, highlighting the complexities and tensions in these relationships.\n  - Use a series of events that challenge Judith's perceptions of love and family, leading to moments of introspection and growth.\n  - Conclude with an open-ended resolution that reflects Judith's ongoing journey towards understanding herself and her place within her family.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Incorporate symbolic elements that represent Judith's emotional state and relationships, such as a garden that she tends with Georgia, symbolizing growth and renewal.\n  - Explore unconventional relationship dynamics, emphasizing the unique bond between Judith and Georgia, and how it contrasts with her familial ties.\n  - Use creative narrative techniques, such as parallel storylines or alternating perspectives, to provide depth and insight into each character's motivations and emotions.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop Judith as a complex character through her internal monologue and interactions, revealing her vulnerabilities and strengths.\n  - Create distinct, multidimensional characters for Judith's son, his wife, and Georgia, each with their own motivations and influence on Judith's journey.\n  - Use the setting to reflect the emotional landscape of the story, such as a cozy neighborhood that contrasts with Judith's internal turmoil, or a shared garden that becomes a place of solace and connection.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ introspective and evocative language to convey Judith's emotional journey, using vivid imagery and symbolism to enhance the narrative.\n  - Focus on dialogue that reveals character dynamics and tensions, using it to highlight key moments of conflict and understanding.\n  - Use varied sentence structures and rhetorical devices to create a rich, immersive narrative, such as metaphors that reflect Judith's evolving perceptions of love and family.\n  - Incorporate humor and warmth in the interactions between Judith and Georgia, providing a counterbalance to the more serious themes of the story.\n</story_rules>"
