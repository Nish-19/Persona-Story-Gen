    "<thinking>\nThe Author Writing Sheet reveals a storytelling style that is deeply introspective and character-driven. The author focuses on the protagonist's internal conflicts and emotional journeys, often using non-linear, episodic plots to emphasize character experiences over traditional narrative arcs. Creativity is expressed through internal dialogue that personifies self-doubt and humor that lightens the narrative tone. Character development is achieved through isolation, emotional vulnerability, and interactions that reveal personal growth.
