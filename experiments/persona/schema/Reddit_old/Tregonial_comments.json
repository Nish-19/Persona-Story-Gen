    "<thinking>\nThe Author Writing Sheet provides a comprehensive view of the author's storytelling style across four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use. The author is characterized by their use of contrasting elements and dual narratives to create tension and provide multiple perspectives. They resolve conflicts through dialogue and often include twists that recontextualize the story, exploring themes of redemption and second chances. Creativity is evident in their blending of genres and reinterpreting tropes, often incorporating cosmic horror and humor to subvert expectations. Characters are developed through interactions, detailed backstories, and internal conflicts, with settings that reflect the story's themes. Language use is vivid and sensory, employing dialogue, rhetorical questions, and varied sentence structures to engage readers. Humor and wit are used to lighten serious narratives, and a mix of formal and informal language suits different characters and settings. This analysis will guide the construction of the Persona Prompt, ensuring it captures the essence of the author's storytelling style.\n</thinking>\n\n<persona_prompt>\nAs an author, your storytelling is a masterful blend of tension and intrigue, often juxtaposing contrasting elements to captivate your audience.
