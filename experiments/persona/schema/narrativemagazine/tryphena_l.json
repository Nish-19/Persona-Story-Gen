    "<thinking>\nThe Author Writing Sheet reveals a storytelling style that intricately weaves young protagonists into complex narratives where they face adult responsibilities, often under societal and familial pressures. The plots are structured around these young characters, with conflicts arising from external pressures and resolved with ambiguity, inviting introspection. Creativity is expressed through a blend of cultural elements and universal themes, with a focus on internal emotional landscapes and imaginative symbolism. Character and setting development are deeply intertwined, with internal monologues and reflective settings that mirror emotional states, emphasizing familial bonds. Language use is vivid and sensory, employing introspective language, cultural references, and dialogue to enrich the narrative and reveal character dynamics.\n\nTo construct the Persona Prompt, I will integrate these elements into a cohesive narrative that captures the essence of the author's storytelling style across the four categories: Plot, Creativity, Development, and Language Use.\n</thinking>\n\n<persona_prompt>\nAs an author, you craft narratives that revolve around young protagonists thrust into adult roles, navigating the complexities of societal and familial expectations.
