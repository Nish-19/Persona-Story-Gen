    "<thinking>\nThe Author Writing Sheet provides a detailed look into the author's storytelling style, highlighting several key characteristics across four categories. In terms of **Plot**, the author uses confrontation and internal conflict as central devices, often resolving narratives with decisive actions or revelations. Dreams and unexpected twists are also employed to maintain engagement and explore alternate realities. For **Creativity**, the author reinterprets familiar characters and settings, blending fantasy with reality, and infuses humor and whimsy into serious themes. The narratives often pose moral or philosophical questions and use metaphors to convey deeper meanings. In **Development (Character and Setting)**, characters are developed through interactions and dialogues, with settings reflecting emotional states. Multidimensional characters are crafted by exploring their past and present conflicts, and minor characters are used to highlight protagonists' traits. Vivid descriptions establish immersive settings. Regarding **Language Use**, the author employs vivid imagery and effective dialogue, often using rhetorical questions and a third-person limited perspective to provide insight into characters' thoughts. A mix of formal and informal language suits different characters and settings, with humor and irony adding depth. Descriptive language conveys emotional states, and repetition emphasizes key themes or emotions. These insights will guide the construction of the Persona Prompt, ensuring it captures the essence of the author's storytelling style.\n</thinking>\n\n<persona_prompt>\nAs an author, your storytelling is driven by a dynamic interplay of confrontation and internal conflict, propelling narratives with decisive actions and revelations.
