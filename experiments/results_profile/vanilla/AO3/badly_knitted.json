        "story": "Dee Laytner was not having a good day. In fact, he was having a perfectly miserable one, and it was all thanks to the walking germ factory that was Ted. They were supposed to be partners\u2014no, brothers in arms\u2014but Ted had the audacity to sneeze right in Dee\u2019s face three days ago, and now Dee was paying for it.\n\n\"ACHOO!\" Dee nearly knocked over the tower of paperwork on his desk with the force of his latest sneeze. His sinuses felt like they were stuffed with wet cement, his head was throbbing, and he was pretty sure his nose was now a shade of red that would put Rudolph to shame.\n\n\"Easy there, Dee,\" Ryo said from his own desk, barely glancing up from the mountain of forms he was diligently filling out. \"You're gonna hurt yourself at this rate.\"\n\nDee glared at his partner through watery eyes. \"Don't you start, Ryo. I already feel like death warmed over. And this is Ted's fault. He sneezed right in my face! I'm gonna make him pay.\"\n\nRyo chuckled softly. \"Oh, I'm sure you will. But maybe you should focus on getting better first?\"\n\n\"ACHOO!\" Dee wiped his nose with a tissue. \"No way. This is a matter of principle. You don't just go around sneezing on people without consequences!\"\n\nRyo's lips twitched into an amused smile. \"And what exactly do you have in mind?\"\n\nDee leaned back in his chair, a mischievous glint in his eye. \"Oh, I've got a few ideas. Maybe I'll replace his coffee with decaf. Or switch his chair with that squeaky one from the break room. Or\u2014\"\n\n\"Or you could just talk to him about it,\" Ryo suggested, raising an eyebrow.\n\nDee scoffed. \"Where's the fun in that? No, this requires something... more creative.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" Ryo asked, genuinely curious now.\n\nDee grinned, despite the throbbing in his temples. \"Like a little bit of petty revenge. I'm thinking... glitter. Lots and lots of glitter. In his locker, in his desk drawer, in his shoes. Everywhere.\"\n\nRyo shook his head, though he was still smiling. \"You're terrible, you know that?\"\n\n\"Hey, he started it,\" Dee defended. \"Besides, it'll be harmless fun. Just enough to make him think twice before he sneezes on anyone again.\"\n\nRyo sighed but didn't argue further. He knew better than to try and dissuade Dee once he got an idea in his head. \"Just try not to get yourself into more trouble, okay? You're already sick.\"\n\nDee's grin widened. \"Don't worry about me, Ryo. This is just what I need to lift my spirits.\"\n\nAs the day dragged on, Dee's plan began to take shape. He made a mental checklist of all the places he could stash the glitter, and by the time their shift ended, he was practically giddy with anticipation. But his body had other plans. \n\nThat night, lying in bed with a feverish sweat soaking through his sheets, Dee groaned. Maybe Ryo was right. Maybe he should focus on getting better first. But as he drifted off into a restless sleep, visions of Ted covered in sparkly glitter danced through his head.\n\nThe next morning, Ryo arrived at Dee\u2019s apartment with a care package\u2014soup, medicine, and a sympathetic smile. Dee accepted it gratefully, albeit with a grumble.\n\n\"Alright, Ryo. You win. I'll get better first. But once I'm back on my feet, Ted better watch out.\"\n\nRyo laughed softly, shaking his head. \"I wouldn't expect anything less from you, Dee.\"\n\nAnd as Dee sipped his soup, he couldn't help but smile. Revenge could wait. For now, he had a partner who cared enough to make him soup, and that was enough to get him through this miserable cold. But Ted's day was coming. Oh, it was coming."

        "writing_prompt": "Your partner is away on a secretive assignment, leaving you to navigate the ache of their absence\u2014how do you cope when every corner of your world reminds you of them?",
        "story": "Ryo Maclean stared at the empty side of the bed, the sheets still rumpled from Dee\u2019s hurried departure. It had been three days since Dee was called away on a secretive assignment, the details of which were classified even to Ryo. Three days, and Ryo had already memorized the pattern of Dee\u2019s absence, the way the apartment felt colder without his partner\u2019s warmth.\n\nRyo sighed, running a hand through his hair as he sat up. The early morning light filtered through the curtains, casting a pale glow over the room. He could almost hear Dee\u2019s voice, teasing him for being such a worrywart. \u201cI\u2019ll be back before you know it, Ryo. Don\u2019t lose any sleep over me.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo late for that,\u201d Ryo muttered to himself. He swung his legs over the side of the bed and stood, stretching his stiff muscles. The kitchen was his first destination, the coffee maker a silent guardian of routine. As the coffee brewed, Ryo\u2019s eyes drifted to the fridge, where a photo of him and Dee was pinned by a magnet. It was from their last vacation, both of them grinning like idiots at the camera. Dee\u2019s arm was slung around Ryo\u2019s shoulders, and Ryo\u2019s smile was genuine, unguarded.\n\nThe coffee maker beeped, snapping Ryo back to the present. He poured himself a mug and took a sip, the bitter taste grounding him. He had a full day ahead at the precinct, cases to solve, paperwork to file. But the ache of Dee\u2019s absence was a constant companion, a shadow that lingered at the edge of his thoughts.\n\nAt work, the usual chaos of the 27th precinct was almost a welcome distraction. Almost. JJ\u2019s chatter, Drake\u2019s grumbling, even Chief Smith\u2019s gruff orders couldn\u2019t fully drown out the worry gnawing at Ryo\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cHey, Ryo,\u201d JJ called from across the room, waving a file. \u201cGot a new lead on that robbery case. Wanna take a look?\u201d\n\nRyo nodded, grateful for the diversion. He joined JJ at his desk, immersing himself in the details of the case. Hours passed in a blur of interviews, stakeouts, and reports. It wasn\u2019t until late afternoon that Ryo allowed himself a moment to breathe.\n\nHe wandered to the break room, hoping for a quiet moment. Instead, he found Drake nursing a cup of coffee, looking as worn out as Ryo felt.\n\n\u201cRough day?\u201d Drake asked, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cYou could say that,\u201d Ryo replied, leaning against the counter. He didn\u2019t elaborate, and Drake didn\u2019t press. They both knew how it was, the worry that came with having a partner out in the field.\n\nAs the day dragged on, Ryo found himself glancing at his phone more often than he cared to admit, hoping for a message from Dee. But the screen remained stubbornly blank.\n\nBy the time Ryo returned home, the emptiness of the apartment felt almost oppressive. He dropped his keys on the table and sank onto the couch, feeling the weight of Dee\u2019s absence settle over him once more.\n\nIt was then that he noticed the small envelope on the coffee table, Dee\u2019s handwriting scrawled across the front. Ryo\u2019s heart skipped a beat as he tore it open, unfolding the note inside.\n\n\u201cRyo,\n\nI know you\u2019re probably worried sick about me, and I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t tell you more. But I want you to know that I\u2019m thinking of you every second. I\u2019ll be back soon, and when I am, we\u2019re going to have the best damn reunion this city\u2019s ever seen. Until then, take care of yourself. I love you.\n\n- Dee\u201d\n\nRyo smiled, a warmth spreading through his chest. He folded the note carefully and placed it back on the table. The ache was still there, but it was bearable now, softened by the promise of Dee\u2019s return.\n\nWith a renewed sense of hope, Ryo stood and headed to the bedroom. He had a feeling he\u2019d sleep a little better tonight, knowing Dee was out there, thinking of him too."

        "story": "Ryo Maclean walked into the precinct, the bitter winter air still clinging to his coat and a flurry of snowflakes dusting his hair. He was greeted by the usual hum of activity\u2014phones ringing, officers typing, and the occasional burst of laughter from the break room. But today, something was different.\n\nDee Laytner, his partner, was already at his desk, a bright red knitted \"nose cozy\" snugly wrapped around his nose. Ryo blinked, trying to process the sight. The cozy was adorned with tiny pom-poms that bounced as Dee turned to face him, grinning from ear to ear.\n\n\"Morning, Ryo!\" Dee said cheerfully, his voice slightly muffled by the cozy. \"Check it out\u2014nose cozy. Perfect for this freezing weather!\"\n\nRyo's lips twitched, caught between a laugh and an incredulous smile. \"Dee, what on earth are you wearing?\"\n\nDee leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms proudly. \"It's a nose cozy, obviously. Keeps my nose warm. And guess what?\" He reached into his desk drawer and pulled out another one, this one a cheerful blue. \"I got one for you too! Can't have my partner freezing his nose off, can I?\"\n\nRyo stared at the knitted contraption, then back at Dee. \"You're serious?\"\n\n\"As a heart attack,\" Dee replied, waggling the cozy enticingly. \"Come on, Ryo, give it a try. It's surprisingly comfortable. Plus, it's all the rage on AO3.\"\n\nRyo raised an eyebrow. \"Since when do you browse fanfiction sites?\"\n\nDee shrugged, a mischievous glint in his eyes. \"Hey, you learn a lot about what the fans think of us. Besides, there are some really creative ideas out there. Like this nose cozy thing\u2014total game changer.\"\n\nRyo sighed, knowing there was no way he was getting out of this without at least humoring Dee. \"Fine, I'll try it. But just for today.\"\n\nDee's grin widened as he handed over the blue cozy. Ryo hesitated for a moment, then slipped it over his nose. The soft yarn was indeed warm, and he had to admit, not entirely unpleasant. He glanced at his reflection in the window, feeling slightly ridiculous but also oddly amused.\n\n\"See? Looks great on you,\" Dee said, giving him a thumbs-up. \"Now we're officially the coziest detectives in the precinct.\"\n\nRyo couldn't help but laugh. \"I don't know if 'cozy' is the word I'd use, but it's definitely something.\"\n\nTheir banter was interrupted by the arrival of Chief Smith, who stopped dead in his tracks upon seeing the duo. His eyebrows shot up, and for a moment, he seemed at a loss for words. \"What in the world...?\"\n\nDee stood up, striking a pose. \"Just keeping warm, Chief. Gotta stay sharp in this cold.\"\n\nThe chief shook his head, muttering something about \"damn millennials\" as he walked away, leaving Dee and Ryo to exchange amused glances.\n\n\"Well,\" Ryo said, adjusting his nose cozy, \"I suppose this will make for an interesting day.\"\n\n\"That's the spirit!\" Dee replied, clapping him on the shoulder. \"Now let's go solve some crimes and look fabulous doing it.\"\n\nAs they headed out into the cold, Ryo couldn't help but feel a warmth that had nothing to do with the knitted cozy. It was moments like these\u2014silly, unexpected, and undeniably human\u2014that reminded him why he loved working with Dee. Their partnership was built on more than just professional respect; it was a deep, unspoken bond that made even the coldest days a little brighter.\n\nAnd as they walked side by side, noses bobbling with each step, Ryo knew that no matter what the day brought, they'd face it together."

        "story": "Dee groaned, his breath forming a ghostly cloud in the frigid air. \"Worst. Assignment. Ever.\" He punctuated each word with a forceful puff, trying and failing to rub warmth back into his gloved hands. Snowflakes swirled around them, a relentless barrage that painted the world in a soft, blinding white.\n\nRyo glanced over, his own breath visible in the dim light of the patrol car's interior. \"You think this is bad? Remember that summer stakeout in the heatwave? I'd take this over sweating through my shirt any day.\" He tried for levity, but the shiver in his voice betrayed him.\n\n\"Yeah, but at least then we had ice cream,\" Dee retorted, his lips curling into a half-smile. \"Out here, all we've got is...\" He trailed off, gesturing at the snow-covered desolation around them. \"A whole lotta nothing.\"\n\nRyo sighed and leaned back in his seat, his fingers tapping a restless rhythm against the steering wheel. \"I was supposed to be on a beach right now. Sandy shores, crystal-clear water, the works. But no, instead I'm stuck here with you.\" His tone was teasing, but the undercurrent of genuine disappointment was unmistakable.\n\n\"Hey, I'd make a great beach buddy,\" Dee shot back, winking. \"Picture it: me in swim trunks, you in... anything, really.\" He chuckled, earning a half-hearted glare from Ryo.\n\n\"You're impossible,\" Ryo muttered, though he couldn't hide the small smile tugging at his lips. \"But seriously, this storm... it's the worst we've had in decades. And of course, it hits right when we need to be out here.\"\n\nDee's expression softened, his teasing demeanor slipping away. \"Yeah, I know. But hey, at least we're in this together, right?\" He reached over, placing a hand on Ryo's shoulder. \"Could be worse. We could be stuck out here alone.\"\n\nRyo's eyes met Dee's, the warmth in his gaze cutting through the cold. \"You're right. I guess there are worse things than being stuck with you.\" He shifted slightly, leaning closer to Dee. \"It\u2019s just... I had all these plans. I wanted to surprise you with a trip, somewhere nice. Thought we could use a break from all this.\"\n\nDee's eyes widened in surprise, then softened with affection. \"You... you planned a trip? For us?\" He shook his head, a slow smile spreading across his face. \"Ryo, you really are something else.\"\n\nRyo shrugged, a faint blush coloring his cheeks. \"I just thought... we deserve it. After everything.\"\n\nDee's hand slid down to Ryo's, their gloved fingers intertwining. \"Well, if we can't have sandy beaches, we'll just have to make do with snowy streets.\" He grinned, his eyes sparkling with mischief. \"Besides, who needs a tropical paradise when I've got you right here?\"\n\nRyo laughed, the sound warm and genuine. \"You really are impossible,\" he repeated, but there was no bite to his words. He squeezed Dee's hand, finding comfort in the simple gesture.\n\nThe storm raged on outside, but inside the patrol car, a different kind of warmth began to bloom. They sat in companionable silence for a while, the chaos of the world outside fading into the background.\n\n\"Remember that time we got stuck in the elevator?\" Dee asked suddenly, a playful glint in his eye.\n\nRyo groaned, but he couldn't help the smile that followed. \"How could I forget? You wouldn't stop singing.\"\n\n\"I was serenading you,\" Dee corrected, feigning offense. \"You loved it. Don't deny it.\"\n\nRyo rolled his eyes, but his smile widened. \"It was... memorable, that's for sure.\"\n\nDee chuckled, leaning closer. \"You know, we\u2019ve had our share of crazy situations. But through it all, we've had each other. That's what matters, right?\"\n\nRyo's gaze softened, his heart swelling with a mix of affection and gratitude. \"Yeah, it is.\" He shifted closer, their shoulders brushing. \"I guess paradise isn't about where you are. It's about who you're with.\"\n\nDee's smile was radiant, his eyes shimmering with warmth. \"Exactly. And as long as we're together, we can handle anything. Even the worst snowstorm in decades.\"\n\nRyo laughed, the sound a balm against the cold. \"You always know how to make the best of things, don't you?\"\n\nDee shrugged, his grin turning playful. \"It's a gift. But seriously, Ryo, we've got this. Together.\"\n\nAs the storm howled around them, the two detectives found solace in each other's company, the warmth of their bond a beacon against the chill. They may have been stranded in a snowstorm, but in that moment, they were exactly where they needed to be."

        "writing_prompt": "Two detectives sit in their car, arguing over which is worse\u2014rain or snow\u2014while procrastinating on apprehending a suspect in the middle of a relentless downpour. What finally forces them to make their move?",
        "story": "Ryo shifted in his seat, peering through the foggy windshield at the rundown apartment building across the street. Rain hammered on the roof of the car, turning the night into a blur of motion and noise. He sighed, turning to his partner, who was lounging in the driver\u2019s seat with a look of supreme disdain.\n\n\"I still think snow is worse,\" Ryo said, his voice rising above the din of the storm.\n\nDee rolled his eyes, taking a sip of his lukewarm coffee. \"You kidding me? At least with snow, you can bundle up. Rain just soaks through everything. And don\u2019t get me started on the smell of wet clothes.\"\n\nRyo chuckled, shaking his head. \"But snow turns into ice. Walking becomes a hazard. And driving? Forget it. You\u2019d rather deal with the rain.\"\n\nDee snorted. \"Ice, sure. But rain means everything\u2019s slippery too. Look at us\u2014stuck here, waiting for our guy to show while we get pruned like raisins.\" He gestured at the windshield, where the wipers were fighting a losing battle. \"And don\u2019t act like we\u2019re not procrastinating. We could have gone in fifteen minutes ago.\"\n\nRyo bit his lip, glancing at the dashboard clock. It was true; they were putting off the inevitable. The suspect, a small-time crook with a penchant for disappearing, was holed up inside, and neither of them was eager to get drenched. He turned back to Dee, a mischievous glint in his eyes.\n\n\"How about this? We go in, get the guy, and then you can tell me all about why rain is worse while we\u2019re writing up the report.\"\n\nDee rolled his eyes again but couldn\u2019t hide the slight smile tugging at his lips. \"Deal. But if I get pneumonia, I\u2019m blaming you.\"\n\nThe two detectives shared a moment of camaraderie, the kind that came from years of partnership and countless nights like this one. Dee\u2019s hand found the door handle, but before he could open it, a flash of movement caught Ryo\u2019s eye.\n\n\"Wait,\" Ryo said, his voice suddenly tense. \"Look.\"\n\nA figure emerged from the building, huddled under a tattered umbrella that did little to shield them from the downpour. Ryo\u2019s heart raced as he recognized the suspect. It seemed their wait was finally over.\n\n\"Guess that\u2019s our cue,\" Dee muttered, pulling his jacket tighter around himself. \"Ready?\"\n\nRyo nodded, and they both stepped out into the rain, the cold water instantly soaking through their clothes. They moved quickly, keeping low and quiet, their footsteps muffled by the relentless storm.\n\nAs they closed the distance, the suspect looked up, eyes widening in panic. He turned to run, but Dee was faster. With a well-placed tackle, he brought the man to the ground, both of them splashing into a puddle. Ryo was there in an instant, helping to secure the suspect\u2019s hands behind his back.\n\n\"Let\u2019s get him to the car,\" Ryo said, trying to ignore the rain dripping down his neck.\n\nDee grunted in agreement, hauling the suspect to his feet. They half-dragged, half-carried him back to the car, shoving him into the back seat before collapsing into their own seats, breathless and soaked.\n\n\"Well,\" Dee said, shaking water from his hair, \"that was fun.\"\n\nRyo laughed, wiping his face with his sleeve. \"At least it\u2019s over.\"\n\nDee gave him a sidelong glance, a wicked grin spreading across his face. \"So, about that rain versus snow debate...\"\n\nRyo groaned, leaning back in his seat. \"You\u2019re never going to let this go, are you?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" Dee said cheerfully, starting the car. \"And just for the record, rain is definitely worse.\"\n\nAs they drove off, the rain continued to pour, but inside the car, the warmth of their banter and the familiar rhythm of their partnership made the storm outside seem just a little less daunting."

        "story": "The ice storm hit Cardiff with an unforgiving force, turning the bustling city into a frozen wasteland. Jack Harkness peered out the window, watching the ice crystals form intricate patterns on the glass. The city lay dark and silent, save for the occasional crack of a tree branch succumbing to the weight of the ice.\n\nIanto Jones, bundled in a thick sweater and scarf, approached Jack from behind, wrapping his arms around his waist. \"The power's out everywhere,\" he murmured, his breath visible in the freezing air. \"Even Torchwood's systems are down.\"\n\nJack sighed, leaning back into Ianto's embrace. \"We've faced worse,\" he said with a forced cheerfulness, but the worry in his eyes was undeniable. \"At least we have each other.\"\n\n\"And a rather unusual housemate,\" Ianto added with a soft chuckle.\n\nJack turned, raising an eyebrow. \"You mean our little alien friend? Where is it, anyway?\"\n\nAs if on cue, a soft, purring sound emanated from the corner of the room. There, nestled in a makeshift bed of blankets, was their unexpected guest: a small, furry creature they had rescued from a recent mission. It looked like a cross between a cat and a hedgehog, with large, expressive eyes and a coat that shimmered in the dim light.\n\nIanto approached the creature, reaching out to stroke its fur. \"It's warmer than any blanket,\" he said, marveling at the heat emanating from its body. \"And far cuddlier than it looks.\"\n\nJack joined him, sitting down on the floor beside the creature. It nuzzled against his hand, emitting a contented hum. \"We should name it,\" he suggested, glancing at Ianto with a playful smile.\n\n\"How about Snuggles?\" Ianto teased, earning a mock glare from Jack.\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" Jack retorted, though his eyes twinkled with amusement. \"How about Flare? For its warmth.\"\n\nIanto considered it for a moment before nodding. \"Flare it is.\"\n\nFlare seemed to approve, purring louder as it curled up between them. The warmth from its body spread through the room, dispelling the chill and bringing a sense of comfort. Jack and Ianto leaned against each other, grateful for the unexpected companionship.\n\n\"Do you think we'll ever figure out where it came from?\" Ianto asked, his voice soft and contemplative.\n\nJack shrugged. \"Maybe. Maybe not. But sometimes, it's not about knowing all the answers. It's about appreciating the moments we have.\"\n\nIanto smiled, resting his head on Jack's shoulder. \"You're right. And right now, I appreciate this moment more than anything.\"\n\nThey sat in companionable silence, the storm raging outside but unable to touch the warmth and love they shared. Flare's gentle purring was a soothing backdrop, reminding them that even in the darkest times, there could be light and warmth.\n\n\"I never imagined our lives would involve cuddling with an alien creature during an ice storm,\" Ianto mused, a hint of laughter in his voice.\n\nJack chuckled. \"Life with Torchwood is anything but ordinary. But I wouldn't trade it for anything.\"\n\n\"Neither would I,\" Ianto agreed, his hand finding Jack's and intertwining their fingers. \"As long as we have each other, we'll be okay.\"\n\nJack squeezed his hand, a silent promise passing between them. They would face whatever challenges came their way, together. And with Flare by their side, they knew they had an ally in the most unexpected form.\n\nThe storm continued to howl outside, but inside their small haven, there was peace. Jack, Ianto, and their extraordinary housemate were a testament to the resilience of the human (and alien) spirit. Together, they would weather any storm, finding warmth and comfort in each other's presence.\n\nAs the night wore on, they drifted into a peaceful sleep, the ice storm outside a distant memory. Flare's gentle warmth enveloped them, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there could be unexpected sources of light and love."

Dee Laytner drummed his fingers against the steering wheel, frustration bubbling just beneath his calm facade. Beside him, Ryo Maclean stared out the window, his mind seemingly lost in the pastel colors of the evening sky. \n\n\"How much longer do you think this will take?\" Ryo asked, his voice tinged with weariness. \n\nDee glanced at him, a playful smirk tugging at his lips. \"Well, considering we've moved about ten feet in the last twenty minutes, I'd say we're in for the long haul.\"\n\nRyo sighed, leaning back in his seat. \"I knew we should have taken the subway.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but then we wouldn't have this,\" Dee said, gesturing to the open road stretching out in front of them. \"An adventure waiting to happen.\"\n\nRyo turned to look at him, one eyebrow raised. \"Adventure?

With the city skyline fading in the distance, the air felt lighter, freer. The tension in the car dissipated, replaced by a sense of adventure and possibility.\n\nDee rolled down the windows, letting the cool breeze fill the car. \"Much better, don't you think?\"\n\nRyo nodded, a small smile playing on his lips. \"Yeah, it is.\"\n\nThey drove in comfortable silence for a while, the only sounds the hum of the engine and the occasional chirping of birds. Dee stole glances at Ryo, marveling at how the setting sun cast a warm glow on his partner's face. \n\n\"Hey, Ryo,\" Dee said softly, breaking the silence. \"Do you ever think about just... driving? No destination, no plans. Just you and me, the open road.\"\n\nRyo turned to him, his eyes meeting Dee's. \"Sometimes,\" he admitted. \"It's nice to escape, even if it's just for a little while.\"\n\nDee reached over, his hand finding Ryo's. \"Then let's make a promise. Whenever life gets too crazy, we'll find a road like this. Just us, the car, and the freedom to go wherever we want.\"\n\nRyo squeezed Dee's hand, his smile widening. \"I'd like that.\"\n\nAs they continued down the winding road, the city far behind them, Dee felt a sense of contentment wash over him. They didn't need a destination; they had each other. And in that moment, that was all the adventure they needed.\n\nIn the golden glow of the setting sun, they drove on, letting the road guide them to wherever it may lead, their hearts light and their spirits free."

Tosh was running diagnostics on a newly captured alien artifact, and Jack had warned them that this one was particularly volatile. \n\n\"How's work, love?\" her mum asked, refilling her cup. \"You never talk about it much.\"\n\nGwen forced a smile. \"Oh, you know, same old, same old.

Rhys was the one person who knew the truth about her job, and it weighed on him as much as it did on her. He was her rock, her anchor in the storm of alien madness.\n\n\"He's fine,\" she said. \"Busy with work, like always.\"\n\nAs the conversation shifted to wedding plans, Gwen's phone buzzed. She glanced at it, heart pounding. It was a message from Jack: \"Need you at the Hub ASAP. Urgent.\"\n\nShe stood up, trying to keep her voice calm. \"Sorry, Mum, Dad, I have to go. Something's come up at work.\"\n\nHer mum sighed. \"Always something, isn't it? Just make sure you take care of yourself, Gwen. We worry about you, you know.\"\n\nGwen leaned down to kiss her mum's cheek. \"I will, Mum. Promise.\"\n\nAs she drove back to the Hub, Gwen wondered how long she could keep up this facade. The lies were getting harder to manage, the stakes higher with each passing day. But as she stepped into the Hub and saw her team\u2014Tosh, Ianto, Owen, and Jack\u2014she knew she couldn't walk away. They were her family too, and Earth needed protecting.\n\n\"What's the situation?\" she asked, her voice steady.\n\nJack turned to her, his expression grim. \"It's the artifact. It's started to activate.\"\n\nGwen nodded, slipping into her role with practiced ease. Whatever happened next, she would face it head-on, just like always. Because being part of Torchwood meant living on the edge of danger\u2014and she wouldn't have it any other way."

        "writing_prompt": "Your foster son disapproves of your relationship with your partner, but as you navigate love, family, and boundaries, you realize some things are worth fighting for\u2014even if it means enduring a twelve-year-old's dramatic scowls.",
        "story": "Ryo MacLean had faced down criminals, conspiracies, and more paperwork than any detective should ever endure, but nothing could have prepared him for the steely glare of a twelve-year-old boy. Bikky, his foster son, had perfected the art of the dramatic scowl\u2014a skill he now deployed with ruthless precision.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t date him,\u201d Bikky declared, arms crossed and eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019m just saying it\u2019s gross.\u201d\n\nRyo sighed, running a hand through his hair. Beside him, Dee Laytner stifled a laugh, earning himself a sharper glare from Bikky. \u201cLook, champ, I get it. It\u2019s weird seeing your foster dad with someone,\u201d Dee said, his tone surprisingly gentle. \u201cBut I promise, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, joy,\u201d Bikky muttered, rolling his eyes. \u201cMore of you eating our food and hogging the TV.\u201d\n\nRyo shot Dee a glance, silently pleading for patience. \u201cBikky, this isn\u2019t just about Dee. It\u2019s about us as a family. We need to talk about boundaries and respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cRespect?\u201d Bikky snorted. \u201cLike the respect you showed me by not even asking how I felt?\u201d\n\nRyo flinched. It was a fair point, one he hadn\u2019t considered in the whirlwind of new love. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he conceded. \u201cI should have talked to you first. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nBikky\u2019s scowl softened, just a fraction. \u201cYeah, well, whatever,\u201d he mumbled, kicking at an imaginary spot on the floor. \u201cJust don\u2019t expect me to start calling him \u2018Dad\u2019 or anything.\u201d\n\nDee snorted this time, unable to contain it. \u201cTrust me, kid, I don\u2019t even call him that.\u201d\n\nRyo shot Dee a look, half-exasperated, half-amused. \u201cDee, not helping.\u201d\n\nDee held up his hands in mock surrender. \u201cAlright, alright. But seriously, Bikky, you don\u2019t have to like me. Just... maybe give me a chance?\u201d\n\nBikky looked between the two men, weighing his options. \u201cFine,\u201d he said at last, with all the reluctance of a kid being asked to eat his vegetables. \u201cBut if you start acting all mushy and gross, I\u2019m out.\u201d\n\nRyo reached out, squeezing Bikky\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDeal.\u201d\n\nAs the days turned into weeks, Bikky\u2019s dramatic scowls became less frequent, though no less intense when they did appear. Dee\u2019s presence became a regular fixture in their lives, and slowly, the three of them found a rhythm.\n\nOne evening, as they sat together watching a movie, Dee leaned over to whisper in Ryo\u2019s ear. \u201cI think he\u2019s starting to warm up to me.\u201d\n\nRyo followed Dee\u2019s gaze to where Bikky sat, pretending to be engrossed in the film but casting occasional glances their way. \u201cMaybe,\u201d Ryo whispered back, smiling.\n\nBikky caught them whispering and rolled his eyes. \u201cUgh, you guys are so weird.\u201d\n\nDee chuckled, throwing an arm around Ryo\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWeird\u2019s not so bad, right?\u201d\n\nBikky shrugged, a faint smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. \u201cYeah, I guess. Just don\u2019t start kissing or anything.\u201d\n\nRyo laughed, feeling a warmth spread through him that had nothing to do with the blanket they shared. \u201cDeal, Bikky. Deal.\u201d\n\nIn that moment, amidst the laughter and the teasing, Ryo realized some things really were worth fighting for\u2014even if it meant enduring a twelve-year-old\u2019s dramatic scowls."

        "story": "Ryo Maclean shivered as he stumbled into the precinct, rainwater dripping from his soaked trench coat and pooling beneath his feet. The storm outside had been relentless, and he cursed himself for not carrying an umbrella. He peeled off his coat, grimacing at how it clung to his skin, and headed towards the locker room, hoping to find something dry to change into.\n\nThe locker room was mercifully empty, the echo of his footsteps bouncing off the tiles. Ryo sighed in relief, eager for a moment of solitude. But as he reached his locker, he heard a familiar, enthusiastic voice.\n\n\"Ryo! You're drenched!\" Dee Laytner appeared at the door, his eyes sparkling with mischief. \"Let me guess\u2014forgot your umbrella again?\"\n\nRyo rolled his eyes, struggling with the combination lock. \"Dee, now's not the time. I'm trying to get dry here.\"\n\nDee sauntered over, leaning against the locker next to Ryo's. \"You know, I was just thinking,\" he said, a playful tone in his voice, \"it's almost like fate wants us to have these little encounters. Rain, an empty locker room\u2014what could possibly go wrong?\"\n\nRyo groaned inwardly. Dee's overzealous admiration was nothing new, but in moments like this, it could be downright exhausting. \"Dee, can we not do this right now? I'm cold, I'm wet, and I just want to change.\"\n\n\"Sure, sure,\" Dee replied, though he made no move to leave. Instead, he watched Ryo with an intensity that made the other detective's cheeks flush. \"But you know, you could always let me help. Two hands are better than one, right?\"\n\n\"Dee,\" Ryo warned, finally managing to open his locker. He pulled out a dry shirt and began unbuttoning his soaked one. \"I can manage, thanks.\"\n\nDee's gaze didn't waver, and Ryo could feel the heat of it like a physical touch. \"You know, Ryo,\" Dee said, his voice softer now, \"I really care about you. I hate seeing you like this.\"\n\nRyo paused, his fingers fumbling with the buttons. The sincerity in Dee's voice caught him off guard, and for a moment, he looked up, meeting Dee's eyes. \"I know you do,\" he said quietly. \"But sometimes, you can be a bit... much.\"\n\nDee chuckled, running a hand through his hair. \"Yeah, I get that. But I can't help it. You're important to me, Ryo.\"\n\nRyo's heart softened at Dee's words, and he sighed, finally managing to strip off his wet shirt. \"I know, Dee. Just... give me some space, okay?\"\n\nDee nodded, stepping back. \"Alright, alright. I'll give you some space. But don't think for a second that I'm giving up on you.\"\n\nRyo couldn't help but smile, despite the situation. \"I wouldn't expect anything less,\" he replied, pulling on his dry shirt. \"Thanks, Dee.\"\n\nDee grinned, his eyes twinkling with that familiar spark. \"Anytime, Ryo. Anytime.\"\n\nAs Ryo finished dressing, the storm outside continued to rage, but inside the locker room, a quiet understanding settled between the two detectives. It wasn't perfect, but it was theirs, and for now, that was enough."
