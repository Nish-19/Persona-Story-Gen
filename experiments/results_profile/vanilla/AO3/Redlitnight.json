        "story": "Percy stood at the edge of the campfire, the warm glow flickering in the cool night air. The flames danced, casting shadows that seemed to mock the turmoil within him. Camp Half-Blood had always been a place of comfort, a sanctuary from the chaos of the world. But tonight, it felt more like a battleground.\n\nAcross the fire, Nico di Angelo sat alone, his dark eyes reflecting the flickering light. There was a time when Percy could read every emotion in those eyes, but now they seemed like an impenetrable abyss. The distance between them felt insurmountable, even though only a few feet separated their bodies. \n\nPercy clenched his fists, the memories of their shared moments flooding his mind. The late-night talks, the stolen kisses under the stars, the promises whispered in the dark. It was a love that had once felt unbreakable, but now it was slipping through his fingers like sand. He wanted to fight for it, to rekindle the spark that had ignited their hearts. But how could he when Nico seemed so distant, so unreachable?\n\n\"Hey,\" Percy called out, his voice wavering. Nico's head snapped up, his expression guarded. \"Can we talk?\"\n\nNico hesitated, then nodded, rising to his feet. They walked away from the fire, the silence between them heavy with unspoken words. They reached the edge of the lake, the water shimmering under the moonlight. Percy took a deep breath, his heart pounding in his chest.\n\n\"Nico, what's happening to us?\" Percy asked, his voice barely above a whisper. \"We used to be so close, and now... it feels like we're drifting apart.\"\n\nNico looked down at the ground, his hands shoved into his pockets. \"I don't know, Percy,\" he replied, his voice filled with a mix of frustration and sadness. \"It's like... something's changed. Maybe it's me, maybe it's you, maybe it's both of us.\"\n\nPercy stepped closer, his eyes searching Nico's face for any sign of the boy he had fallen in love with. \"I don't want to lose you,\" he said, his voice breaking. \"I can't imagine my life without you.\"\n\nNico's gaze softened, and for a moment, Percy saw a glimpse of the vulnerability that Nico so often hid. \"I don't want to lose you either,\" Nico admitted, his voice barely audible. \"But I don't know how to fix this.\"\n\nThey stood there in silence, the weight of their emotions pressing down on them. Percy reached out, his hand trembling as he took Nico's in his own. \"Maybe we don't have to fix it all at once,\" he said softly. \"Maybe we just need to start with one small step. Like we used to.\"\n\nNico looked up, a small smile tugging at the corners of his lips. \"One small step,\" he repeated, squeezing Percy's hand. \"I think I can manage that.\"\n\nAs they stood together by the lake, the moonlight casting a silver glow around them, Percy felt a glimmer of hope. They had a long way to go, but for the first time in a long time, he believed that they could find their way back to each other. One small step at a time."

        "writing_prompt": "On a stormy night, a father soothes his daughter\u2019s fears with a song, while his husband watches with a quiet smile, their small family finding warmth and peace amidst the thunder.",
        "story": "The storm had been relentless all evening, with thunder shaking the walls of the small cabin Percy and Nico had made their home. Rain lashed against the windows, and every flash of lightning illuminated the cozy interior, casting shadows that danced along the walls.\n\nTheir daughter, little Calliope, had always been fascinated by storms, but tonight the tempest seemed to unnerve her. She clutched her stuffed hippocampus, Thalassie, tightly to her chest, her wide eyes reflecting the flickering light of the fireplace.\n\n\"It's okay, Callie,\" Percy murmured, drawing her closer. His voice was soft, soothing, and full of the assurance that only a father could provide. He kissed the top of her head, brushing a few stray curls back into place. \"The storm can't hurt us. We're safe here.\"\n\nNico watched from the doorway, leaning against the frame with a quiet smile playing on his lips. He loved these moments\u2014seeing Percy in his element as a father, his natural ease with their daughter a testament to the hero's endless capacity for love.\n\n\"Daddy, can you sing the song?\" Calliope's voice was small, almost lost amidst the rumble of thunder. \n\nPercy nodded, his blue eyes twinkling. \"Of course, sweetheart. Anything for you.\"\n\nHe began to hum the familiar tune before his voice joined in, rich and gentle. \"Come stop your crying, it will be alright. Just take my hand, hold it tight...\"\n\nCalliope's eyes began to droop as the comforting melody washed over her. Percy swayed gently, rocking her in his arms, the song a lullaby that had been passed down from his own mother.\n\nNico walked over, his footsteps soft on the wooden floor. He settled beside them, his presence a grounding force. Percy glanced up, their eyes meeting, sharing a moment of unspoken understanding. Nico reached out, placing a hand on Percy's shoulder, and together they created a cocoon of warmth and safety.\n\n\"Why don't you take a break, Seaweed Brain?\" Nico's voice was low, affectionate. \"I'll take over for a bit.\"\n\nPercy smiled, passing Calliope to Nico with the utmost care. \"You know the words?\"\n\nNico smirked. \"Of course I do.\" He cleared his throat, his voice softer, a bit rougher around the edges but no less comforting. \"For one so small, you seem so strong. My arms will hold you, keep you safe and warm...\"\n\nCalliope's eyes fluttered shut, the combination of her fathers' voices weaving a tapestry of security. Nico continued to sing, his free hand finding Percy's and squeezing it gently.\n\nThe storm raged on outside, but inside the cabin, there was only peace. Percy rested his head against Nico's shoulder, their daughter nestled between them, her fears calmed by the power of their love.\n\nIn that moment, there was no prophecy, no danger, no looming threat. Just a family, finding solace in each other. As the last notes of the song faded into the night, Nico pressed a kiss to Calliope's forehead, then to Percy's lips.\n\n\"Goodnight, my loves,\" he whispered, the storm's fury a distant memory in the warmth of their embrace."

        "story": "Mr. Solace, the well-liked high school biology teacher with an impeccable knack for keeping students engaged, glanced at the lesson plan for the day. His stomach dropped when he realized he'd forgotten to pick up the eggs for their embryology lab. He pinched the bridge of his nose, already hearing Nico's voice in his head, theatrical and teasing. But there was no way around it; he needed help. \n\nHe pulled out his phone and dialed his fianc\u00e9. \n\n\"Nico, I need a favor,\" he began.\n\n\"Oh, do you now?\" Nico's voice came through, dripping with mock suspicion. \"What kind of favor, and what's in it for me?\"\n\nWill could almost see Nico's smirk through the phone. \"I forgot the eggs for the embryology lab. Can you bring some? Please?\"\n\nNico's laughter was loud and unapologetic. \"You forgot the eggs? Oh, Will. This is going to cost you.\"\n\nWill sighed, but a small smile played on his lips. \"Fine. Whatever you want, just get here soon. The class starts in ten minutes.\"\n\nThere was a pause, and then Nico replied, \"I'll be there in five.\"\n\nTrue to his word, five minutes later, Nico di Angelo strode into the classroom with a carton of eggs in one hand and a dramatic flair that made the students sit up and take notice. Will could practically hear the mental tags popping up in the students' heads: #DramaticEntrance, #Fianc\u00e9Goals, #EggSavior.\n\n\"Nico, thank you,\" Will said, trying to keep his tone professional despite the warmth in his eyes.\n\n\"Anything for you, Sunshine,\" Nico replied, setting the eggs on the desk with a flourish. The students giggled and whispered amongst themselves, clearly entertained by the exchange. \n\nOne brave student, Claire, raised her hand. \"Mr. Solace, is this your... um, friend?\"\n\nWill cleared his throat, feeling a blush creep up his neck. \"Class, this is Nico, my fianc\u00e9.\" He saw the collective eyebrows shoot up, accompanied by more giggles and whispers. \n\nNico flashed a grin at the class. \"Hello, everyone. Keep an eye on Mr. Solace for me, will you? He tends to forget things.\"\n\nThere was a chorus of laughter, and Will shot Nico a look that was half exasperated, half affectionate. \"Alright, alright. Let's get started with the lesson. Nico, you can stay if you want, but try not to cause too much chaos.\"\n\nNico raised an eyebrow. \"Me? Cause chaos? Never.\"\n\nAs the lesson progressed, Nico found a seat at the back of the room, watching Will with a soft smile. The students buzzed with excitement, shooting glances at Nico every now and then, clearly fascinated by this new development in their teacher's life. \n\nWhen it came time to crack open the eggs and examine the embryos, Nico couldn't resist joining in. He wandered over to one of the lab tables, peering over the students' shoulders. \"Wow, that's pretty cool,\" he said, genuinely impressed. \n\nThe students beamed, thrilled to have Nico's attention. \"Do you want to try?\" Claire asked, holding out an egg.\n\nNico looked at Will, who nodded with a smile. \"Sure, why not?\" Nico carefully cracked the egg, revealing the delicate embryo inside. The students crowded around, oohing and aahing.\n\n\"You know,\" Nico said, glancing at Will with a mischievous glint in his eye, \"I think I might make a pretty good biology teacher.\"\n\nWill chuckled. \"Maybe. But for now, I'm just glad you're here.\"\n\nThe bell rang, signaling the end of the period. As the students filed out, still chattering excitedly, Will pulled Nico into a quick embrace. \n\n\"Thank you,\" he whispered.\n\nNico kissed his cheek. \"Anytime, Sunshine. Anytime.\"\n\nAnd with that, the chaos of the day settled into a comfortable, happy rhythm, the classroom filled with the lingering warmth of laughter and love."

What does their perfect wedding look like, and how do their friends at Camp Half-Blood help make it unforgettable?",
        "story": "Nico di Angelo stood by the strawberry fields of Camp Half-Blood, his eyes scanning the horizon as if trying to grasp the reality that had just been shared with him. Will Solace, always the beam of sunshine to Nico's shadow, stood beside him, his hand gently intertwined with Nico's.\n\n\"Can you believe it?\" Will's voice was filled with a kind of awe Nico had rarely heard, even in all their adventures. \"It's really happening, Nico. We can actually get married.\"\n\nNico turned to look at Will, his dark eyes reflecting a mix of emotions\u2014hope, disbelief, and a cautious joy that he was slowly allowing himself to feel. \"Yeah,\" he said, his voice softer than usual. \"We really can.\"\n\nThe news of gay marriage being legalized had spread through Camp Half-Blood like wildfire, igniting celebrations and plans among their friends. Annabeth Chase was already sketching out architectural designs for the wedding venue, while Percy Jackson had taken it upon himself to organize a grand feast, complete with ambrosia and nectar-infused delicacies.\n\nThe couple found themselves swept up in a whirlwind of preparations, the entire camp buzzing with excitement. Chiron had given his blessing, and even Dionysus had begrudgingly agreed to contribute by providing the finest wine for the occasion.\n\n\"Tag: Wedding Planning Shenanigans,\" Will joked as they sat down with Annabeth to go over the details. \"Do we really need a fountain that shoots out glitter?\"\n\nAnnabeth rolled her eyes but smiled. \"It's your wedding, guys. If you want a glitter fountain, you'll get a glitter fountain. Besides, it's Camp Half-Blood\u2014nothing's ever too much here.\"\n\nNico couldn't help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all. The boy who had once walked alone in shadows was now planning a wedding with the love of his life, surrounded by friends who had become family. \"Tag: Dreams Do Come True,\" he murmured, squeezing Will's hand.\n\nAs the day of the wedding approached, the camp transformed into a magical wonderland. The amphitheater was draped with celestial blue and silver banners, echoing the night sky. Fireflies, charmed by the children of Hecate, flitted about, adding a twinkling ambiance.\n\nThe big day arrived, and Nico found himself standing at the altar, his heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and nervousness. Will stood across from him, looking as radiant as Apollo himself. Their friends and family filled the seats, a sea of familiar faces beaming with joy.\n\nChiron officiated the ceremony, his wise and gentle presence grounding the couple in the reality of the moment. \"We gather here today to celebrate the union of Nico di Angelo and Will Solace,\" he began, his voice carrying the weight of countless generations of love and hope. \"In a world where love has often been a battlefield, it is moments like these that remind us of the power of unity and acceptance.\"\n\nNico and Will exchanged vows, their words woven with promises of love, support, and adventure. \"I vow to stand by you, even in the darkest of shadows,\" Nico said, his voice steady and sincere.\n\n\"And I vow to bring light to every corner of our life together,\" Will responded, his eyes shining with unshed tears.\n\nWhen Chiron pronounced them married, the amphitheater erupted in applause. Percy and Annabeth led the cheers, and even Clarisse La Rue cracked a rare smile.\n\nThe reception was a joyous affair, filled with laughter, dancing, and more than a few playful arguments over who had caught the bouquet (Tyson, much to everyone\u2019s surprise). The glitter fountain, much to Will's delight, was a hit.\n\nAs the night drew to a close, Nico and Will stole a moment away from the festivities, standing by the lake under the star-studded sky. \"Tag: Happily Ever After,\" Nico whispered, resting his head on Will's shoulder.\n\nWill smiled, wrapping an arm around Nico. \"Yeah,\" he agreed softly. \"Happily ever after.\""

It had been a grueling day of training with the new demigods, and all he wanted was a moment of peace. As he approached the porch, he heard a melody drifting through the air, clear and ethereal. It was beautiful, almost painfully so, and it stopped him in his tracks.\n\nHe followed the sound, drawn like a moth to a flame, until he reached the source: Nico di Angelo, perched on the railing, strumming an acoustic guitar and singing softly to the twilight. Percy\u2019s breath caught in his throat. He\u2019d heard Nico hum a tune now and then, but this\u2014this was something else entirely.\n\n\u201cNico?\u201d Percy called softly, not wanting to startle him.\n\nNico looked up, a small smile tugging at his lips when he saw Percy. \u201cHey, Seaweed Brain. Rough day?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you could say that,\u201d Percy replied, walking over to join him. \u201cWhat\u2019s this song? It\u2019s... incredible.\u201d\n\nNico\u2019s cheeks flushed a light pink. \u201cYou like it?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike it? It\u2019s amazing. Did you write it?\u201d\n\nNico chuckled, the sound a mix of amusement and something deeper. \u201cI wish. No, this song\u2014it\u2019s a gift from Apollo.\u201d\n\nPercy\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cApollo? As in, the god of music and poetry Apollo?\u201d\n\nNico nodded, fingers still idly strumming the guitar strings. \u201cHe visited me last week. Said he was inspired by\u2014well, by us. Our relationship. He thought it deserved an anthem.\u201d\n\nPercy\u2019s heart swelled at the thought. \u201cReally? Our relationship?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Nico said, glancing down at the guitar. \u201cHe said something about how love that defies the odds deserves to be celebrated. And, well, considering our history, I guess he had a point.\u201d\n\nPercy remembered their journey\u2014how they had gone from reluctant allies to something much deeper. It hadn\u2019t been easy, but it had been worth it. Every step, every challenge, had brought them closer together.\n\n\u201cCan you sing it again?\u201d Percy asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nNico\u2019s eyes softened as he nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nAs Nico began to sing, Percy closed his eyes, letting the music wash over him. The lyrics spoke of trials and triumphs, of shadows and light, and through it all, the enduring strength of love. It was a story he knew well\u2014his and Nico\u2019s, woven into an immortal melody.\n\nWhen the final notes faded into the night, Percy opened his eyes, feeling lighter than he had in weeks. He reached out, taking Nico\u2019s hand in his. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, his voice thick with emotion.\n\nNico squeezed his hand, a silent promise in the gesture. \u201cAnytime, Percy.\u201d\n\nThey sat together in the fading light, the memory of the song lingering between them like a warm embrace. And for that moment, everything was perfect."

Will Solace watched from the cabin window, a soft smile playing on his lips as he took in the winter wonderland outside. \"Seven years,\" he murmured, his voice a gentle caress against the chill.\n\nNico di Angelo stood beside him, dark eyes reflecting the snowfall. \"Seems like yesterday,\" he replied, his voice a whisper of shadows and warmth. He reached out, intertwining his fingers with Will's. \"Ready to build that snowman?\"\n\nWill chuckled, squeezing Nico's hand. \"Only if we name him Edgar.\"\n\nNico raised an eyebrow. \"Edgar, huh? Any particular reason?\"\n\n\"Just feels right,\" Will said with a grin, grabbing his jacket. \"Come on, let's get started.\"\n\nOutside, the snow crunched under their boots as they worked together, laughter mingling with the crisp air. Will's cheeks flushed pink from the cold, while Nico's breath formed little clouds around his head. They rolled and stacked snow, shaping a figure with meticulous care.\n\n\"Edgar,\" Nico declared with a flourish, placing a crooked stick for the snowman's nose. \"A snowman worthy of the gods.\"\n\nWill placed a knit cap on Edgar's head, stepping back to admire their creation. \"Perfect,\" he said, dusting snow off his gloves. \"Now, how about that hot chocolate?\"\n\nInside the cabin, the warmth enveloped them like a familiar embrace. Will busied himself with the hot chocolate, the rich scent of cocoa filling the air. Nico set up the couch with blankets, ensuring maximum coziness for their movie marathon.\n\n\"Here we go,\" Will said, handing Nico a steaming mug. They settled in, feet tangled together under the blankets, the soft glow of the TV casting a gentle light.\n\nNico took a sip, sighing contentedly. \"Cheesy holiday movies, huh? You know how to spoil me.\"\n\nWill laughed, his eyes twinkling. \"It's our anniversary tradition. Besides, who doesn't love a good holiday clich\u00e9?\"\n\nAs the first movie played, they watched in comfortable silence, the only sounds the occasional chuckle or murmur of appreciation. But every so often, Nico's gaze drifted to the window, where Edgar stood sentinel in the backyard. There was something... uncanny about the snowman, as if it were watching them.\n\n\"Will,\" Nico said quietly, his voice barely above a whisper. \"Do you feel that?\"\n\nWill turned to look at him, concern etching his features. \"Feel what?\"\n\n\"Edgar,\" Nico said, nodding towards the window. \"It's like... he's alive.\"\n\nWill followed Nico's gaze, eyebrows knitting together. \"It's just a snowman, Neeks,\" he said softly, though his voice held a hint of uncertainty. \"But if it makes you feel better, we can check on him.\"\n\nThey bundled up once more, stepping out into the night. The air was colder now, the snow glistening under the moonlight. Edgar stood exactly where they'd left him, but there was an air of expectation about him, a stillness that felt almost sentient.\n\n\"Hey, Edgar,\" Will said, half-joking, half-serious. \"You're not planning on coming to life, are you?\"\n\nAs if in response, a sudden gust of wind blew through the trees, sending a shiver down their spines. Nico reached for Will's hand, squeezing it tightly.\n\n\"Maybe it's just the magic of the season,\" Nico said, his voice soft and wonder-filled. \"Or maybe... we've made a new friend.\"\n\nWill smiled, pulling Nico close. \"Happy anniversary, Nico.\"\n\n\"Happy anniversary, Will,\" Nico replied, leaning in for a kiss as the snow fell gently around them, Edgar standing guard over their love."

He had been minding his own business in the Hades cabin, trying to get some rest, when Will Solace burst in with a mischievous grin that sent shivers down Nico's spine. Will held an array of colorful markers and, most alarmingly, a tube of glitter.\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" Nico declared, clutching his cast protectively.\n\nWill pouted, his blue eyes shimmering with determination. \"Come on, Nico. It's tradition! Everyone gets their cast signed by their friends.\"\n\nNico sighed, knowing it was pointless to argue. \"Fine. Just... no glitter.\"\n\nWill's grin widened, and he settled down beside Nico, carefully uncapping a marker. \"Trust me, you'll love it.\"\n\nNico watched as Will's hand moved deftly, sketching out intricate designs. Flowers and suns intertwined with skulls and bones, a perfect blend of their contrasting worlds. Every so often, Will would pause to blow on the ink, sending a cascade of glitter into the air despite Nico's earlier protest.\n\nNico couldn't help but smile at Will's enthusiasm.

It's a surprise.\"\n\nNico rolled his eyes but complied, allowing himself to be swept up in Will's infectious energy. He closed his eyes, enjoying the sensation of Will's hand against his skin, the soft scratch of the markers, and the light, warm presence beside him.\n\nWhen Will finally sat back, his masterpiece complete, he looked at Nico with a mixture of pride and nervousness. \"Okay, you can look now.\"\n\nNico opened his eyes and turned his arm, taking in the riot of colors and shapes.

It was rare for them to have a night off from quests, training, and general demi-god chaos. Even rarer was an evening like this, spent in relative normalcy.\n\nNico hummed as he organized his properties, a rare smile tugging at his lips. \"So, I've got a date with Will tomorrow.\"\n\nThe silence that followed could have rivaled the stillness of Tartarus. Percy dropped his stack of Community Chest cards, and Jason froze mid-count.\n\n\"Wait, what?\" Percy leaned in, eyes wide and curious, like a puppy that had just discovered a new toy. \"You have a date with Will?

I think I can handle a date.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but this is different,\" Percy insisted. \"Dates are like quests. You need a strategy.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Jason agreed, tapping his chin thoughtfully. \"Do you need a wingman? I could hang out nearby, just in case.\"\n\nNico groaned. \"Absolutely not. The last thing I need is you two lurking around like overprotective parents.\"\n\nPercy pouted, but there was a glint of mischief in his eyes. \"Just saying, we're here to help.\"\n\nNico rolled his eyes, but there was a warmth in his chest that he couldn't deny. \"Thanks, but I've got it under control. Besides, Will likes me for who I am, underworld topics and all.\"\n\n\"Fair enough,\" Jason conceded, moving his piece around the board. \"But if you need any tips\u2014\"\n\n\"You'll be the first to know,\" Nico interrupted with a grin. \"Now can we please focus on the game? I'm about to buy Boardwalk.\"\n\nThe rest of the night was filled with the usual banter and competitive spirit that came with any game night. But beneath the teasing and unsolicited advice, Nico felt the unwavering support of his friends. It was chaotic, it was over-the-top, and it was everything he never knew he needed.\n\nAs he lay in bed later that night, Nico couldn't help but smile. Tomorrow's date with Will would be great, not because of any strategic plan, but because he had the backing of the two most chaotic older brothers at Camp Half-Blood. And that was more than enough."

Annabeth was building an elaborate sandcastle, while Percy and Jason were locked in an intense game of beach volleyball. Piper and Hazel were lounging on towels, chatting and laughing about who-knew-what.\n\nNico felt a pang of something he couldn't quite name\u2014something that felt a lot like longing. He wanted to belong here, to be part of this easy camaraderie. But years of feeling like an outsider were hard to shake.\n\n\"Hey, Death Boy!\" Percy called, waving him over. \"Come join us!\"\n\nNico rolled his eyes. \"Is that supposed to be an invitation?\"\n\nPercy shrugged, unbothered. \"Works for me.\"\n\nBefore Nico could respond, Will tugged him toward the water. \"Let's go for a swim.\"\n\nNico dug in his heels. \"You know I hate the water.\"\n\nWill's expression softened. \"I know. But I'm right here with you. We'll take it slow, okay?\"\n\nNico hesitated, then nodded. \"Okay.\"\n\nThe water was colder than he expected, and he shivered as it lapped at his ankles. Will kept a steady hold on his hand, guiding him deeper into the waves. It wasn't as bad as Nico had feared\u2014Will's presence was a comforting anchor, and the water, while cool, wasn't the menacing force he remembered.\n\n\"See?\" Will said, his voice gentle. \"You're doing great.\"\n\nNico managed a small smile. \"Thanks.\"\n\nThey floated together for a while, letting the waves carry them. Nico felt a strange sort of peace settle over him. Maybe the beach wasn't so bad after all\u2014at least, not with Will by his side.\n\nEventually, they made their way back to shore, where Percy and Jason were still going at it with the volleyball. Nico watched them for a moment, then turned to Will. \"Think they'd mind if we joined?\"\n\nWill's eyes lit up. \"Absolutely not. Come on!\"\n\nJoining the game was easier than Nico expected. Percy and Jason welcomed him with open arms, and soon Nico found himself laughing and shouting along with the rest of them. It felt good\u2014better than he could have imagined.\n\nLater, as the sun began to set and the demigods gathered around a bonfire, Nico sat beside Will, feeling content. Maybe the beach wasn't his favorite place, but with Will and his friends, he could learn to love it.\n\n\"I guess the beach isn't so bad,\" Nico admitted, leaning against Will.\n\nWill chuckled, wrapping an arm around him. \"Told you so.\"\n\nNico smiled, letting the warmth of the fire and the comfort of Will's embrace chase away any lingering doubts. Maybe, just maybe, the beach could be a place of new beginnings."

        "story": "Nico di Angelo stood by the edge of the Camp Half-Blood infirmary, his hands shoved deep into the pockets of his black jeans. He watched Will Solace bustle around, organizing supplies and humming some catchy tune from the mortal world. Nico cleared his throat, trying to summon the courage that had failed him in countless battles but seemed to desert him in this simple task.\n\n\"Will,\" Nico began, his voice barely above a whisper. Will looked up, his bright blue eyes filled with a warmth that made Nico's stomach flip in the most confusing way.\n\n\"Hey, Nico! Everything okay?\" Will asked, a gentle smile playing on his lips.\n\nNico nodded, then shook his head, then nodded again. \"I, um, I need your help with something.\"\n\nWill set down the roll of bandages he was holding and gave Nico his full attention. \"Sure, anything. What do you need?\"\n\nNico took a deep breath, feeling his face heat up. \"I need you to teach me how to kiss.\"\n\nFor a moment, the infirmary was silent except for the distant sounds of campers practicing in the arena. Then Will blinked, his mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water. \"You\u2026 want me to teach you how to kiss?\"\n\nNico nodded vigorously, the tips of his ears turning red. \"Yeah. I mean, you're experienced, right? And I'm... not. So, I thought maybe you could show me?\"\n\nWill rubbed the back of his neck, his cheeks flushing as well. \"I guess I could. I mean, if you're sure.\"\n\nNico stepped closer, his heart pounding in his chest. \"I'm sure.\"\n\nWill took a deep breath and nodded. \"Okay. Let's start with something simple. Close your eyes and relax.\"\n\nNico did as instructed, feeling the nervous energy buzzing through him. He felt Will's hand on his shoulder, steady and comforting.\n\n\"Relax, Nico. Trust me,\" Will's voice was soft, reassuring.\n\nNico let out a breath he didn't realize he was holding. Then, he felt it\u2014Will's lips brushing against his in the gentlest of touches. It was tentative, almost shy, but it sent a jolt of electricity through Nico's entire being. He leaned in, trying to mimic the pressure and movement.\n\nWill pulled back slightly, his eyes searching Nico's for any sign of discomfort. \"How was that?\"\n\nNico's eyes fluttered open, a small smile tugging at his lips. \"It was... nice. Can we try again?\"\n\nWill's smile widened, and he nodded. \"Of course.\"\n\nThis time, when their lips met, it felt different\u2014deeper, more assured. Nico's hands found their way to Will's waist, pulling him closer. Will's fingers tangled in Nico's dark hair, guiding him gently. What started as an innocent lesson quickly became something more, something neither of them had expected.\n\nWhen they finally broke apart, both boys were breathless, their foreheads resting against each other. Nico's heart was racing, but it wasn't just from nerves anymore.\n\n\"That was... wow,\" Nico said, a laugh bubbling up from his chest.\n\nWill chuckled, his eyes sparkling. \"Yeah, wow.\"\n\nNico's smile widened, and he felt a strange sense of peace settle over him. Maybe this was what he'd been missing\u2014a connection, a bond that went deeper than friendship.\n\n\"Thank you, Will,\" Nico whispered, his voice filled with gratitude and something more.\n\n\"Anytime, Nico,\" Will replied, his smile soft and sincere. \"Anytime.\""
