    "<thinking>\n- Detailed reasoning and analysis here on how the base_story differs from the ground-truth, organized by the four narrative categories:\n  1. **Plot**:\n     - The Ground Truth story focuses on the emotional journey and reconciliation between Hamilton and Jefferson, with a clear progression from their initial tension to a tentative friendship. The plot is driven by their shared concern for Madison and their personal reflections on their past conflicts.\n     - The Base Story, while also centered on the concern for Madison, places more emphasis on the mystery of Madison's accident and the potential for foul play. The plot is more static, with less focus on the characters' emotional journeys and more on their immediate reactions and interactions.\n\n  2. **Creativity**:\n     - The Ground Truth story creatively uses historical context and character dynamics to explore themes of friendship, regret, and reconciliation. It incorporates detailed descriptions of settings and actions that enhance the emotional depth of the narrative.\n     - The Base Story, while imaginative in its own right, leans more towards a straightforward recounting of events with less emphasis on the historical and emotional nuances. It lacks the same level of creative integration of historical details and character introspection.\n\n  3. **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n     - The Ground Truth story provides a rich development of both characters and settings. Jefferson and Hamilton are portrayed with depth, showing their internal struggles and growth. The settings, such as Federal Hall and Madison's residence, are vividly described and contribute to the story's atmosphere.\n     - The Base Story offers less detailed character development and setting descriptions. The characters' internal conflicts and growth are less explored, and the settings are more generic, serving primarily as backdrops to the dialogue.\n\n  4. **Language Use**:\n     - The Ground Truth story employs descriptive and emotive language, creating a vivid and immersive narrative. The dialogue is natural and reflective of the characters' historical context, and the pacing allows for moments of introspection and emotional resonance.\n     - The Base Story uses more straightforward and less descriptive language. The dialogue is functional but lacks the same historical authenticity and emotional depth. The pacing is more consistent but does not allow for the same level of character introspection.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the story around the emotional journey and reconciliation between the main characters, focusing on their shared concern for a mutual friend.\n  - Develop a clear progression from initial tension and conflict to a tentative friendship, highlighting moments of personal reflection and growth.\n  - Use the mutual friend's condition as a catalyst for the characters to confront their past conflicts and consider the possibility of mending their relationship.\n  - Include scenes that show the characters' internal struggles and their evolving perspectives on their rivalry and friendship.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Integrate historical context and character dynamics to explore themes of friendship, regret, and reconciliation.\n  - Use detailed descriptions of settings and actions to enhance the emotional depth and atmosphere of the narrative.\n  - Incorporate imaginative elements that reflect the characters' historical backgrounds and personal histories.\n  - Create moments of introspection and emotional resonance that allow the characters to reflect on their past and present relationships.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop multidimensional characters by showing their internal struggles, growth, and evolving perspectives.\n  - Provide rich and vivid descriptions of settings that contribute to the story's atmosphere and reflect the historical context.\n  - Use the settings to enhance the emotional impact of the narrative, making them integral to the characters' experiences and interactions.\n  - Show the characters' interactions with their environment and other characters in a way that reveals their personalities and emotional states.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ descriptive and emotive language to create a vivid and immersive narrative.\n  - Craft natural and historically authentic dialogue that reflects the characters' backgrounds and personalities.\n  - Use pacing that allows for moments of introspection and emotional resonance, balancing action with reflection.\n  - Create a tone that is reflective and contemplative, capturing the characters' emotional journeys and the gravity of their situation.\n</story_rules>"
