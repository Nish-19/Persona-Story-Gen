    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a more introspective and psychological exploration of the Doctor's past, focusing on his internal struggles and guilt. The Toymaker's puppet show is used as a narrative device to confront the Doctor with his past companions and the consequences of his actions.
