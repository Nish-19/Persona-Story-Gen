    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**:\n   - The Author Written Story focuses on Mikkel's internal struggle with his past and present, using his drawings as a medium to navigate his emotions and memories. The narrative is deeply introspective, exploring Mikkel's psychological state and his attempts to reconcile his past life with his current reality. The story is structured around Mikkel's memories and the symbolic act of drawing, which serves as both a coping mechanism and a narrative device to explore themes of memory, identity, and time.\n   - The Base Story, on the other hand, follows Jonas as he uses his drawings to maintain a connection to his past. The plot is more straightforward, focusing on Jonas's interactions with Claudia and his reflections on his lost life. The narrative is less introspective and more focused on external interactions and the theme of hope.\n\n2. **Creativity**:\n   - The Author Written Story creatively uses the act of drawing as a metaphor for memory preservation and emotional processing. Mikkel's drawings are not just representations of his past but are imbued with his complex feelings towards his family and his situation. The story incorporates elements of magical realism, with Mikkel's drawings serving as a bridge between his past and present.\n   - The Base Story uses drawings as a literal representation of memories, with less emphasis on the emotional and psychological depth. The creativity lies in the use of hashtags as a modern twist, but it lacks the metaphorical depth found in the Author Written Story.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n   - In the Author Written Story, Mikkel is a well-developed character with a rich emotional arc. His internal conflict and growth are central to the narrative, and the setting of 1986 is intricately tied to his emotional journey. The story delves into Mikkel's relationships with his family and the impact of his time travel on his identity.\n   - The Base Story presents Jonas as a character dealing with loss, but his development is more static. The setting is less detailed, serving primarily as a backdrop for Jonas's reflections and interactions with Claudia.\n\n4. **Language Use**:\n   - The Author Written Story employs a reflective and introspective tone, with detailed descriptions of Mikkel's thoughts and emotions. The language is rich with metaphor and symbolism, particularly in the depiction of Mikkel's drawings. The narrative perspective is close to Mikkel, allowing for a deep exploration of his internal world.\n   - The Base Story uses a more straightforward narrative style, with clear and concise language. The tone is contemplative but lacks the depth and complexity of the Author Written Story. Dialogue is used to convey themes and character relationships, but the language is less metaphorical and more direct.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative around the protagonist's internal struggle with their past and present.
