    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a gradual unraveling of a relationship through subtle, everyday interactions, focusing on the internal emotional journey of the protagonist. The narrative is structured around small, poignant moments that accumulate to a breaking point, rather than a single climactic event. The story ends on a note of emotional devastation and unresolved tension, aligning with the prompt's theme of facing the ache of losing love. In contrast, the Base Story follows a more traditional narrative arc with a clear conflict and resolution, where the characters actively choose to fight for their relationship.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively uses mundane, relatable experiences to convey the fading of love, such as the absence of a heart emoji or the lack of cuddling. These elements are woven into the narrative to evoke a sense of realism and emotional depth. The story's creativity lies in its ability to capture the nuances of a deteriorating relationship through everyday details, rather than dramatic or fantastical elements. The Base Story, on the other hand, incorporates more conventional romantic tropes and settings, such as a campfire and a lakeside conversation, to explore the theme.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story focuses intensely on the protagonist's internal emotional landscape, with minimal external setting description. The characters are developed through their actions and the protagonist's introspective observations, creating a deeply personal and intimate narrative. The setting is largely implied through the characters' interactions and is not explicitly detailed, emphasizing the emotional rather than physical space. The Base Story provides more explicit descriptions of the setting and uses dialogue to develop the characters' relationship dynamics.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story employs a stream-of-consciousness style, with long, flowing sentences that mirror the protagonist's emotional turmoil. The language is introspective and raw, using repetition and rhetorical questions to convey the protagonist's confusion and heartbreak. The tone is melancholic and reflective, with a focus on internal monologue rather than dialogue. In contrast, the Base Story uses more structured dialogue and descriptive language to convey the characters' emotions and the setting, with a more hopeful and resolved tone.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative around a series of small, everyday moments that collectively illustrate the fading of love.

The plot is driven by character interactions and emotional responses, emphasizing the personal impact of the news on Nico and Will. The story ends with a heartfelt exchange between the couple, imagining their future together. In contrast, the Base Story follows a more traditional narrative arc, detailing the wedding planning and ceremony, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The Author Written Story is more focused on the immediate emotional reaction and the intimate bond between the characters rather than the broader event of the wedding.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively uses the setting of Camp Half-Blood to enhance the emotional impact of the news. The story blends the fantastical elements of the camp with the real-world significance of the legalization of gay marriage. The creativity lies in the juxtaposition of the mundane (a nap, a campfire) with the extraordinary (the announcement, the dream of marriage). The Base Story, while also set in Camp Half-Blood, leans more into the fantastical elements for the wedding planning, such as magical decorations and divine contributions, focusing on the spectacle rather than the personal.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story develops characters through their interactions and emotional responses. Nico and Will's relationship is depicted through small, intimate moments, such as cuddling and holding hands, which convey their deep bond. The setting of the cabin and campfire is used to create a cozy, intimate atmosphere that contrasts with the life-changing news. The Base Story, on the other hand, develops characters through their roles in the wedding planning, with a focus on community involvement and the camp's transformation for the event.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story uses a conversational and intimate tone, with dialogue that reflects the characters' personalities and emotions.

The story resolves with a tender moment between the couple, emphasizing their love and connection. The plot is straightforward, focusing on the emotional impact of the song and the revelation of its divine origin. In contrast, the Base Story involves a more dramatic setting with Percy Jackson, a demigod, and includes a backstory of trials and triumphs, making the plot more complex and adventurous.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively blends the mundane with the divine, using the song as a bridge between the two worlds. The song's lyrics are original and poetic, adding depth to the narrative. The story subtly incorporates mythology through the character of Apollo, without delving into epic adventures or quests.
