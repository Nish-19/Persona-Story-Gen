    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story begins with a sense of ambiguity about the war's end, creating a more introspective and personal narrative. The plot is driven by Cody's internal conflict and his relationship with Obi-Wan, rather than external events.

The narrative is rich with sensory details and emotional depth, creating a vivid and immersive experience.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: Characters are developed through their interactions and internal monologues. Cody's struggle with his identity and his relationship with Obi-Wan are central to the narrative.

The battlefield serves as a backdrop for the characters' personal journey, rather than the main focus.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story uses a more poetic and descriptive language style, with a focus on sensory details and emotional resonance. The narrative voice is introspective, reflecting Cody's internal conflict and emotional state. Dialogue is used sparingly but effectively to convey character relationships and emotional stakes.
