    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story employs a fragmented monologue style, presenting multiple characters each grappling with intense emotions and situations. Each character's narrative is a standalone vignette, capturing a moment of raw intensity, such as maternal instincts, heroism, vanity, and defiance. The story does not follow a traditional plot structure with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Instead, it focuses on the internal monologues of the characters, blurring the line between confession and self-justification. This contrasts with the Base Story, which follows a more linear narrative with a clear progression of events leading to a climactic moment and subsequent reflection.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively interprets the prompt by presenting a series of fragmented monologues from different characters, each with a distinct voice and perspective. The narratives are rich with sensory details and emotional depth, allowing readers to experience the characters' inner turmoil. The story blends elements of realism with a stream-of-consciousness style, creating a vivid and immersive experience. This approach is more experimental and varied compared to the Base Story, which maintains a single perspective and a more conventional narrative style.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: Characters in the Author Written Story are developed through their internal monologues, revealing their thoughts, emotions, and motivations. The settings are implied through sensory details and the characters' interactions with their environment, such as the darkness surrounding Luisa or the smoke-filled air in Abraham's narrative. The characters are multidimensional, each with a unique voice and perspective that reflects their personal struggles. In contrast, the Base Story focuses on a single character's emotional journey, with more explicit descriptions of the setting and a gradual development of the character's emotional arc.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story uses a fragmented, stream-of-consciousness style, with long, flowing sentences that mimic the characters' thought processes. The language is rich in sensory details and emotional intensity, creating a vivid and immersive experience. The use of repetition, rhetorical questions, and vivid imagery enhances the emotional impact of the narratives. The story employs a variety of narrative voices, each with its own distinct tone and style. This contrasts with the Base Story, which uses a more straightforward narrative style with clear, concise language and a consistent tone throughout.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative as a series of fragmented monologues, each from a different character's perspective, capturing a moment of raw intensity.
