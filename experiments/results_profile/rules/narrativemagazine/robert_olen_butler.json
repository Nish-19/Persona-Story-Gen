    "<thinking>\n- Detailed reasoning and analysis here on how the base_story differs from the ground-truth, organized by the four narrative categories:\n  1. **Plot**: The Ground Truth story presents multiple fragmented monologues from different characters, each grappling with intense emotions and situations. The narrative is non-linear and disjointed, reflecting the chaotic inner thoughts of the characters. The Base Story, on the other hand, follows a single character's linear narrative, detailing a sequence of events leading to a moment of intense emotional conflict.\n  2. **Creativity**: The Ground Truth story employs a highly fragmented and stream-of-consciousness style, blending different voices and perspectives to create a mosaic of raw, intense experiences. It uses vivid, often surreal imagery to convey the characters' emotions. The Base Story is more conventional, with a clear, linear progression and a focus on realistic, detailed descriptions of events and emotions.\n  3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: In the Ground Truth story, characters are developed through their fragmented, introspective monologues, revealing their inner turmoil and complex emotions. The settings are often implied rather than explicitly described, adding to the sense of disorientation. The Base Story provides more detailed descriptions of the setting and the protagonist's interactions with other characters, creating a more grounded and coherent narrative.\n  4. **Language Use**: The Ground Truth story uses a fragmented, stream-of-consciousness style with abrupt transitions and a focus on sensory details and emotional intensity. The language is often poetic and abstract, reflecting the characters' inner chaos. The Base Story uses more structured, descriptive language, with clear sentences and a focus on narrative coherence and emotional clarity.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Construct the narrative using multiple fragmented monologues from different characters, each grappling with intense emotions and situations.\n  - Ensure the narrative is non-linear and disjointed, reflecting the chaotic inner thoughts of the characters.\n  - Introduce conflict through the characters' internal struggles and interactions with their environment, rather than through a linear sequence of events.\n  - Resolve the narrative by leaving some elements ambiguous, allowing the reader to infer the outcomes based on the characters' fragmented thoughts.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Employ a highly fragmented and stream-of-consciousness style, blending different voices and perspectives to create a mosaic of raw, intense experiences.\n  - Use vivid, often surreal imagery to convey the characters' emotions and inner turmoil.\n  - Integrate unconventional or imaginative elements, such as surreal or symbolic imagery, to enhance the emotional intensity of the narrative.\n  - Reinterpret the prompt by focusing on the characters' internal conflicts and fragmented thoughts, rather than a straightforward narrative.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through their fragmented, introspective monologues, revealing their inner turmoil and complex emotions.\n  - Create emotional arcs by showing the characters' evolving thoughts and feelings through their disjointed monologues.\n  - Establish immersive settings that are often implied rather than explicitly described, adding to the sense of disorientation and emotional intensity.\n  - Tie the settings to the characters' emotions and experiences, using sensory details to enhance the atmosphere and mood.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use a fragmented, stream-of-consciousness style with abrupt transitions and a focus on sensory details and emotional intensity.\n  - Employ poetic and abstract language to reflect the characters' inner chaos and emotional turmoil.\n  - Focus on creating an immersive and engaging narrative through vivid descriptions and sensory details.\n  - Maintain a tone that blurs the line between confession and self-justification, reflecting the characters' internal conflicts and raw emotions.\n</story_rules>"
