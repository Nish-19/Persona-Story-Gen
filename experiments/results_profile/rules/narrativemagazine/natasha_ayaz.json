    "<thinking>\n- Detailed reasoning and analysis here on how the base_story differs from the ground-truth, organized by the four narrative categories:\n  1. **Plot**: The Ground Truth story is structured around vivid, specific memories and a deeply personal narrative. It focuses on the protagonist's childhood experiences and the emotional impact of their father's betrayal. The story is non-linear, with flashbacks interwoven with the present. The resolution is subtle, emphasizing the lingering effects of the past rather than a clear-cut closure. In contrast, the Base Story follows a more straightforward, linear plot. It begins with the receipt of a letter, follows the protagonist's journey to find answers, and concludes with a sense of closure and reconciliation.\n  2. **Creativity**: The Ground Truth story employs rich, evocative imagery and metaphors, creating a haunting and poetic atmosphere. It blends elements of memory, sensory experiences, and emotional introspection. The use of the rose garden as a recurring motif adds depth and symbolism. The Base Story, while imaginative, is more conventional in its approach. It uses the scent of roses as a literal and symbolic element but lacks the same level of poetic detail and metaphorical richness.\n  3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Ground Truth story delves deeply into the protagonist's inner world, exploring their complex emotions and relationships. The characters are multi-dimensional, with the father portrayed as both a beloved figure and a source of pain. The setting is vividly described, with the rose garden serving as a central, symbolic location. The Base Story provides a more surface-level exploration of characters and settings. The protagonist's emotions are described, but not as deeply explored. The setting is described in a straightforward manner, without the same level of sensory detail.\n  4. **Language Use**: The Ground Truth story uses lyrical, descriptive language, creating a rich, immersive reading experience. The pacing is deliberate, allowing for deep emotional engagement. Dialogue is minimal but impactful. The Base Story uses clear, concise language, with a focus on advancing the plot. The pacing is faster, with more emphasis on action and resolution. Dialogue is used to convey information and move the story forward.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative around vivid, specific memories and deeply personal experiences.\n  - Use a non-linear timeline, interweaving flashbacks with the present to reveal the protagonist's past and its impact on their current emotions.\n  - Focus on the emotional and psychological effects of the father's betrayal, rather than seeking clear-cut closure.\n  - Conclude the story with a subtle resolution that emphasizes the lingering effects of the past.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Employ rich, evocative imagery and metaphors to create a haunting and poetic atmosphere.\n  - Blend elements of memory, sensory experiences, and emotional introspection to add depth to the narrative.\n  - Use recurring motifs, such as the rose garden, to add symbolism and thematic coherence to the story.\n  - Incorporate imaginative and unconventional elements to enhance the narrative's emotional impact.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Delve deeply into the protagonist's inner world, exploring their complex emotions and relationships.\n  - Portray characters as multi-dimensional, with both positive and negative traits.\n  - Describe settings vividly, using sensory details to create an immersive atmosphere.\n  - Use the setting, such as the rose garden, as a central, symbolic location that reflects the protagonist's emotional state.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use lyrical, descriptive language to create a rich, immersive reading experience.\n  - Maintain a deliberate pacing, allowing for deep emotional engagement and reflection.\n  - Minimize dialogue, but ensure it is impactful and reveals character emotions and relationships.\n  - Focus on creating a tone that is reflective, introspective, and emotionally resonant.\n</story_rules>"
