    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a more intricate and layered plot compared to the Base Story. It begins with a vivid scene of Virginia's congregation bringing cakes, a symbolic gesture that ties into her religious background and the loss of her daughter. The narrative weaves between past and present, revealing Leslie's life and the circumstances of her death through flashbacks. The plot is non-linear, focusing on Virginia's internal struggle and the external pressures from her faith and community. The Base Story, in contrast, follows a more straightforward, linear progression, focusing on Virginia's immediate grief and her interactions with her friend Claire and Pastor Mitchell.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively integrates religious elements and personal memories to explore the theme of grief. It uses symbolic objects, like the cakes and Leslie's toothbrush, to deepen the narrative. The story also employs a unique perspective on faith, highlighting the conflict between religious doctrine and personal loss. The Base Story, while touching on similar themes, does so in a more conventional manner, focusing on Virginia's struggle with her faith and her need for solitude.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story provides a rich, detailed portrayal of Virginia and her environment. Virginia's character is developed through her interactions with her congregation and her memories of Leslie. The setting, a crowded ranch house, reflects her internal chaos and the pressure from her community. The Base Story offers a more general depiction of Virginia's character, focusing on her grief and isolation, with less emphasis on the setting's impact on her emotional state.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story employs a poetic and evocative language style, using vivid imagery and symbolism to convey Virginia's emotional turmoil. The narrative voice is introspective, with a focus on Virginia's internal monologue and sensory details. The Base Story uses a more straightforward, descriptive language, focusing on dialogue and external actions to convey the narrative. The Author Written Story's language is more nuanced, capturing the complexity of Virginia's grief and her struggle with faith.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a symbolic event that ties into the protagonist's religious background and personal loss, such as a congregation bringing cakes in memoriam of her daughter.\n  - Use a non-linear narrative structure, weaving between past and present to reveal key events and character backstories through flashbacks.\n  - Focus on the protagonist's internal struggle with grief and faith, highlighting the tension between personal beliefs and external pressures from the community.\n  - Conclude with a moment of introspection or realization that reflects the protagonist's ongoing struggle and potential for acceptance, without providing a definitive resolution.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Integrate religious elements and personal memories to explore the theme of grief, using symbolic objects to deepen the narrative, such as a toothbrush or cakes.\n  - Present a unique perspective on faith, emphasizing the conflict between religious doctrine and personal loss, and how this affects the protagonist's actions and decisions.\n  - Use unconventional narrative techniques, such as blending sensory details with introspective thoughts, to create a rich, immersive experience for the reader.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as a multidimensional character through her interactions with others and her internal monologue, revealing her emotional arc and personal struggles.\n  - Create an immersive setting that reflects the protagonist's internal chaos and the external pressures from her community, such as a crowded house filled with congregation members.\n  - Use specific, detailed descriptions of the setting and characters to enhance the emotional depth of the story, such as the glistening shoes with cemetery mud or the toothbrush in the bathroom.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ poetic and evocative language, using vivid imagery and symbolism to convey the protagonist's emotional turmoil and internal conflict.\n  - Focus on introspective narrative voice, capturing the protagonist's internal monologue and sensory experiences to create a nuanced portrayal of grief and faith.\n  - Use varied sentence structures and rhetorical devices to enhance the narrative's emotional impact, such as metaphors and similes that reflect the protagonist's state of mind.\n  - Incorporate dialogue that reveals character relationships and tensions, using it sparingly to emphasize key moments and interactions.\n</story_rules>"
