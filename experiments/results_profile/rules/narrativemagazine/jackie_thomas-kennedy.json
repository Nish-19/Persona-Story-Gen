    "<thinking>\n- Detailed reasoning and analysis here on how the base_story differs from the ground-truth, organized by the four narrative categories:\n  1. **Plot**: The Ground Truth story presents a more complex and layered plot, focusing on the specific religious context of Jehovah's Witnesses and the implications of their beliefs on the characters' actions and emotions. It includes detailed flashbacks and a more intricate depiction of the daughter's life and death. The Base Story, on the other hand, follows a more straightforward narrative, focusing on Virginia's immediate grief and her interactions with her congregation and friend.\n  2. **Creativity**: The Ground Truth story employs a unique blend of religious and personal elements, using specific cultural references and detailed descriptions to create a vivid and emotionally charged narrative. It also uses symbolic elements, such as the cakes and the toothbrush, to deepen the emotional impact. The Base Story is more conventional, focusing on the general themes of grief and faith without the same level of symbolic or cultural specificity.\n  3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Ground Truth story provides a richer development of characters and setting, with detailed backstories and specific, immersive descriptions of the environment and the characters' actions. The characters are portrayed with more depth and complexity, particularly in their religious beliefs and personal struggles. The Base Story offers a more general portrayal of the characters and setting, with less detailed backstories and a more straightforward depiction of the environment.\n  4. **Language Use**: The Ground Truth story uses more descriptive and evocative language, with a focus on sensory details and emotional depth. It employs a more varied and nuanced tone, shifting between different emotional states and using specific imagery to enhance the narrative. The Base Story uses simpler and more direct language, with a more consistent tone and less emphasis on sensory details and emotional nuances.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Introduce the story with a specific cultural or religious context that deeply influences the characters' actions and emotions.\n  - Incorporate detailed flashbacks that provide a rich backstory and deepen the reader's understanding of the characters' current struggles.\n  - Use specific events and actions to highlight the conflict between personal grief and religious beliefs.\n  - Ensure the plot includes moments of internal and external conflict, showing the protagonist's struggle to reconcile their faith with their loss.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Blend personal and religious elements to create a unique and emotionally charged narrative.\n  - Use symbolic objects or actions to deepen the emotional impact and convey the characters' inner states.\n  - Incorporate specific cultural references and detailed descriptions to create a vivid and immersive narrative.\n  - Employ irony or unexpected elements to add depth and complexity to the story.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop multidimensional characters with detailed backstories that reveal their personal and religious struggles.\n  - Create immersive settings with specific and evocative descriptions that reflect the characters' emotional states.\n  - Show the characters' actions and interactions in a way that reveals their inner conflicts and growth.\n  - Use the setting to enhance the narrative, making it an integral part of the characters' experiences and emotions.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ descriptive and evocative language that focuses on sensory details and emotional depth.\n  - Use varied and nuanced tones to reflect the shifting emotional states of the characters.\n  - Incorporate specific imagery and metaphors to enhance the narrative and convey deeper meanings.\n  - Ensure the dialogue is natural and reflective of the characters' personalities and emotional states, adding to the overall depth and realism of the story.\n</story_rules>"
