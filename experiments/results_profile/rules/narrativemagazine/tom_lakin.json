    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story begins with a serene scene of boys playing by the sea, which is disrupted by a sudden, violent shark attack. This event is witnessed by a painter who captures the moment on canvas, leaving a haunting red mark. The story then shifts to years later, where the painting continues to affect those who view it, though they cannot articulate why. The plot is structured to create a stark contrast between the peaceful beginning and the violent tragedy, with a focus on the lasting impact of the event. The Base Story, in contrast, involves a domestic argument leading to a tragedy, with the painter directly intervening. The Author Written Story maintains a more detached perspective, focusing on the painter's internal reaction and the painting's haunting legacy.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively uses the shark attack as a metaphor for sudden, uncontrollable violence, contrasting with the peaceful seaside setting. The painting becomes a vessel for the trauma, subtly affecting viewers over time. This approach blends realism with a touch of the supernatural, as the painting's influence is almost ghostly. The Base Story, while also dealing with a sudden tragedy, remains grounded in a more straightforward narrative without the same level of metaphorical depth or supernatural undertones.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story develops its characters through their interactions and reactions to the environment. The boys are depicted with vivid, sensory details that establish their carefree nature, which is abruptly shattered. The painter is characterized through his reflective observations and the act of painting, which becomes a coping mechanism. The setting is richly described, with the sea and sky playing active roles in the narrative. The Base Story focuses more on the painter's internal struggle and less on the setting or other characters, resulting in a more introspective but less dynamic narrative.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story employs vivid, sensory language to create an immersive atmosphere. The use of similes and metaphors, such as \"like voices in the very next room\" and \"like ink spilled in a pool,\" enhances the emotional impact. The narrative perspective is third-person, providing a detached yet intimate view of the events. Dialogue is used sparingly but effectively to convey character dynamics. The Base Story uses more straightforward language and dialogue, focusing on the painter's internal monologue and emotional journey.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin with a serene and detailed depiction of a seaside scene, focusing on the carefree activities of characters to establish a peaceful atmosphere.\n  - Introduce a sudden, violent event that disrupts the tranquility, ensuring it is witnessed by a central character who is an observer rather than a direct participant.\n  - Highlight the lasting impact of the event on the observer, particularly through an object (e.g., a painting) that captures the moment and continues to affect others over time.\n  - Use a time jump to show the long-term effects of the event, focusing on how the object subtly influences those who encounter it, even if they cannot articulate why.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Incorporate a metaphorical element that contrasts with the setting, such as a natural predator, to symbolize sudden violence and its uncontrollable nature.\n  - Use the object (e.g., the painting) as a vessel for the trauma, imbuing it with a haunting quality that affects viewers in a subtle, almost supernatural way.\n  - Blend realism with a touch of the supernatural or metaphorical, allowing the narrative to explore themes of memory and the unseen impact of trauma.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through their interactions with the environment and each other, using sensory details to establish their personalities and relationships.\n  - Characterize the observer (e.g., the painter) through their reflective observations and actions, particularly how they process the event through their art.\n  - Create an immersive setting with rich, sensory descriptions, ensuring the natural elements (e.g., sea, sky) play active roles in the narrative.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ vivid, sensory language to create an immersive atmosphere, using similes and metaphors to enhance emotional impact.\n  - Maintain a third-person narrative perspective to provide a detached yet intimate view of the events, allowing for reflective observations.\n  - Use dialogue sparingly but effectively to convey character dynamics and highlight key moments, ensuring it complements the narrative's tone and style.\n  - Include specific phrases and descriptions that capture the essence of the scene, such as \"like voices in the very next room\" or \"like ink spilled in a pool,\" to evoke strong imagery and emotion.\n</story_rules>"
