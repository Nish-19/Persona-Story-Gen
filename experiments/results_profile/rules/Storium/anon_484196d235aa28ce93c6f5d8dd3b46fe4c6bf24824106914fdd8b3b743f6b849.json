The narrative is tightly centered around the sudden appearance of the war machine and the ensuing chaos, with a strong emphasis on the sergeant's reactions and thoughts. The story ends abruptly with the sergeant's death, leaving the resolution open-ended and emphasizing the unpredictability and brutality of the situation.

The narrative is driven by action and dialogue, with a focus on the sergeant's perspective and the sensory details of the scene. The use of short, direct sentences and internal monologue creates a sense of immediacy and tension.
