    "<thinking>\n- Detailed reasoning and analysis here on how the base_story differs from the ground-truth, organized by the four narrative categories:\n  1. **Plot**: The Ground Truth story is structured around a specific moment in time, with a clear setting and context provided by the date and location. It focuses on the immediate tension between Konstantine and Zoryana, with hints of past events influencing the present. The narrative is more introspective, with Konstantine's internal conflict and regrets being central. The Base Story, on the other hand, introduces a more dramatic and external conflict with the arrival of mysterious men, suggesting a larger, more immediate threat.\n  2. **Creativity**: The Ground Truth story uses a blend of realism and detailed descriptions to create a vivid, immersive setting. It incorporates cultural elements and specific details about the characters' lives and relationships. The Base Story leans more towards a suspenseful, almost thriller-like atmosphere, with a focus on the mysterious and potentially dangerous situation Konstantine finds himself in.\n  3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Ground Truth story provides a deep dive into Konstantine's character, his habits, and his relationships, particularly with Zoryana and Roman. The setting is richly described, with attention to the physical environment and its impact on the characters. The Base Story, while also providing character insights, is more focused on the immediate tension and the unfolding external conflict, with less emphasis on the detailed backstory and environment.\n  4. **Language Use**: The Ground Truth story employs a more descriptive and introspective language style, with a focus on internal monologue and detailed observations. The dialogue is sparse but impactful, revealing character emotions and tensions. The Base Story uses a more straightforward, action-driven language, with a focus on building suspense and advancing the plot through dialogue and immediate actions.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Anchor the story in a specific moment in time, providing clear context with date and location details.\n  - Focus on the immediate tension between the main characters, using past events to influence the present narrative.\n  - Highlight the protagonist's internal conflict and regrets, making these central to the narrative.\n  - Use introspective moments to reveal character motivations and emotions.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Incorporate realistic and detailed descriptions to create a vivid, immersive setting.\n  - Blend cultural elements and specific details about the characters' lives and relationships to add depth to the story.\n  - Use a mix of realism and introspection to build a rich narrative atmosphere.\n  - Avoid introducing overly dramatic or external conflicts that overshadow the internal and relational tensions.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Provide a deep dive into the protagonist's character, habits, and relationships, particularly with key secondary characters.\n  - Describe the setting in rich detail, emphasizing the physical environment and its impact on the characters.\n  - Develop multidimensional characters with clear emotional arcs and motivations.\n  - Use the setting to reflect and enhance the story's tone and themes.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ descriptive and introspective language to create an engaging and immersive narrative.\n  - Focus on internal monologue and detailed observations to reveal character emotions and tensions.\n  - Use sparse but impactful dialogue to convey character relationships and conflicts.\n  - Maintain a consistent tone that reflects the introspective and realistic nature of the story.\n</story_rules>",
