    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story employs a fragmented narrative structure, focusing on individual vignettes for each character. Each section is dedicated to a character, providing a glimpse into their lives and the moment they are drawn to the scream. The story does not immediately converge the characters but instead builds anticipation by exploring their separate experiences and perspectives. This contrasts with the Base Story, which quickly brings the characters together after the scream. The Author Written Story uses the scream as a catalyst for individual introspection and action, rather than an immediate group convergence.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively integrates elements of surrealism and introspection, particularly in Tasia's dream sequence, which blurs the line between reality and nightmare. This approach adds a layer of psychological depth and symbolism, contrasting with the more straightforward narrative of the Base Story. The Author Written Story also uses the city as a character, with its neon lights and towering structures serving as a backdrop that influences the characters' actions and emotions.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: Characters in the Author Written Story are introduced with a focus on their internal states and unique abilities, such as Jacen's flight and Tasia's vivid dreams. The setting is intricately tied to the characters' experiences, with the city described in a way that reflects their inner turmoil and aspirations. This contrasts with the Base Story, where characters are more defined by their roles and actions within the plot. The Author Written Story's setting is dynamic, with the cityscape playing an active role in shaping the narrative.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story employs vivid, sensory-rich language and a poetic style, particularly in descriptions of the city and Tasia's dream. The use of metaphors and similes, such as \"the city at night was more than just a beacon\" and \"each building was a Christmas Tree,\" creates a vibrant and immersive atmosphere. The narrative voice is introspective, with a focus on the characters' thoughts and emotions. Dialogue is minimal, with emphasis placed on internal monologues and descriptive passages, contrasting with the more dialogue-driven Base Story.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative into distinct sections, each focusing on a different character.

    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a more segmented and character-focused narrative structure compared to the Base Story. Each character is introduced in their own vignette, providing a deep dive into their personal circumstances and motivations before they converge. The plot is less about a single linear narrative and more about the individual stories that eventually intertwine. The Author Written Story uses a more gradual build-up to the convergence of characters, focusing on their personal struggles and environments, whereas the Base Story quickly moves to the intersection of characters in a single scene.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story employs a rich tapestry of world-building, with detailed descriptions of the space station and its socio-economic dynamics. It creatively integrates elements of science fiction, such as the mining operations on Seref and the diverse alien species, to create a vivid setting.

    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a fragmented narrative structure, focusing on individual character experiences rather than a unified plot. Each character's story is introduced separately, with distinct personal conflicts and settings, reflecting the chaos and disarray of the world ending. The narrative does not converge the characters immediately, maintaining their separate paths and perspectives. This contrasts with the Base Story, which quickly brings the characters together, focusing on their collective journey and survival strategy. The Author Written Story emphasizes the initial personal turmoil and confusion, delaying the convergence of the characters to highlight their individual struggles and the broader societal collapse.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story employs a more character-driven approach, using the prompt to explore personal narratives and emotional responses to the apocalypse. It creatively integrates the prompt by focusing on the characters' immediate reactions and personal dilemmas, such as Eva's abandoned wedding and Chad's reckless behavior. This contrasts with the Base Story's more traditional survival narrative, where the characters quickly unite to face external threats. The Author Written Story uses the prompt to delve into the psychological and emotional impact of the apocalypse on individuals, rather than just the physical survival aspect.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: Characters in the Author Written Story are developed through detailed personal experiences and interactions, with a strong emphasis on their emotional states and backgrounds.

The language is informal and direct, capturing the immediacy and rawness of the characters' experiences.
