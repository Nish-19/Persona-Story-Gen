    "<thinking>\n- Detailed reasoning and analysis here on how the base_story differs from the ground-truth, organized by the four narrative categories:\n  1. **Plot**: The Ground Truth story begins in medias res with a dramatic scene involving a medical emergency and a religious ritual, immediately establishing tension and urgency.
