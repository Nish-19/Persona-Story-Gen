    "<thinking>\n- Detailed reasoning and analysis here on how the base_story differs from the ground-truth, organized by the four narrative categories:\n  1. **Plot**:\n     - The Ground Truth story is structured with multiple perspectives and locations within the hospital, creating a broader narrative scope. It introduces three distinct characters in different parts of the hospital, each experiencing the eerie situation from their unique vantage points. The narrative shifts between these characters, building a complex and interconnected plot.\n     - The Ground Truth story engages with the prompt by creating a sense of mystery and urgency through the characters' experiences and the disarray in the hospital. It resolves the narrative by leaving the characters in a state of realization and panic, hinting at a larger, unseen threat.\n  2. **Creativity**:\n     - The Ground Truth story blends genres by incorporating elements of horror, mystery, and drama. It uses vivid descriptions and sensory details to create an immersive and unsettling atmosphere.\n     - The story reinterprets the prompt by expanding the setting to multiple floors and rooms within the hospital, each with its own unique details and disturbances. It integrates imaginative elements such as the plastic sheeting, coded doors, and zip-locked wrists to heighten the tension and sense of confinement.\n  3. **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n     - The Ground Truth story develops multidimensional characters with distinct backgrounds and emotional responses to the situation. Harriet, Carrie, and the staff members each have their own perspectives and reactions, adding depth to the narrative.\n     - The setting is meticulously described, with specific details about the hospital's layout, the state of the rooms, and the sensory experiences of the characters. This creates a vivid and immersive environment that enhances the story's tone and themes.\n  4. **Language Use**:\n     - The Ground Truth story employs descriptive language to create a vivid and immersive narrative. It uses sensory details, such as the taste of blood and the feel of the orthopaedic mattress, to engage the reader's senses.\n     - The pacing is carefully controlled, with shifts between characters and locations that build tension and maintain the reader's interest. Dialogue is minimal but effective, contributing to the eerie and suspenseful tone of the story.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the story with multiple perspectives and locations within the hospital to create a broader narrative scope.\n  - Introduce distinct characters in different parts of the hospital, each experiencing the eerie situation from their unique vantage points.\n  - Shift the narrative between these characters to build a complex and interconnected plot.\n  - Engage with the prompt by creating a sense of mystery and urgency through the characters' experiences and the disarray in the hospital.\n  - Resolve the narrative by leaving the characters in a state of realization and panic, hinting at a larger, unseen threat.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Blend genres by incorporating elements of horror, mystery, and drama.\n  - Use vivid descriptions and sensory details to create an immersive and unsettling atmosphere.\n  - Reinterpret the prompt by expanding the setting to multiple floors and rooms within the hospital, each with its own unique details and disturbances.\n  - Integrate imaginative elements such as plastic sheeting, coded doors, and zip-locked wrists to heighten the tension and sense of confinement.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop multidimensional characters with distinct backgrounds and emotional responses to the situation.\n  - Provide each character with their own perspectives and reactions to add depth to the narrative.\n  - Describe the setting meticulously, with specific details about the hospital's layout, the state of the rooms, and the sensory experiences of the characters.\n  - Create a vivid and immersive environment that enhances the story's tone and themes.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ descriptive language to create a vivid and immersive narrative.\n  - Use sensory details, such as the taste of blood and the feel of the orthopaedic mattress, to engage the reader's senses.\n  - Control the pacing carefully, with shifts between characters and locations that build tension and maintain the reader's interest.\n  - Use minimal but effective dialogue to contribute to the eerie and suspenseful tone of the story.\n</story_rules>",
