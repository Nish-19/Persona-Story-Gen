    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a plot that is driven by the protagonist's intense emotions, particularly rage, and a desire for vengeance. The narrative is structured around the protagonist's actions to torment and ultimately bring justice to their murderer. The story begins with the protagonist's death and quickly transitions into their ghostly existence, focusing on their active haunting of the murderer. The plot is punctuated by moments of supernatural intervention, where the protagonist uses their ghostly abilities to disrupt the murderer's life and plans. The resolution is achieved through a combination of psychological torment and physical intervention, leading to the murderer's capture and eventual death. This differs from the Base Story, which follows a more introspective and passive haunting, with the protagonist observing and subtly influencing the murderer until a confession is made.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively blends elements of horror and dark comedy, using the protagonist's ghostly abilities in imaginative ways to exact revenge. The narrative incorporates pop culture references, such as \"Patrick Swayze's character from the movie Ghost,\" to add a layer of humor and relatability. The protagonist's actions are exaggerated and theatrical, such as carving words into walls and using blood to write messages, which adds a unique flair to the haunting. This contrasts with the Base Story's more somber and reflective tone, where the haunting is subtle and psychological.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The protagonist in the Author Written Story is characterized by their anger and desire for retribution, which drives their actions throughout the narrative.
