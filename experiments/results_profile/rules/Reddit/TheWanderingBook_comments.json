    "<thinking>\n- **Plot**:\n  - The Author Written Story introduces a fantastical setting with stone dragons and a Demon Emperor, creating an immediate sense of grandeur and otherworldliness. The conflict is introduced through the scholar's arrival and his mission to dissuade the Emperor from pursuing world domination. The narrative progresses through a series of logical arguments presented by the scholar, each met with a response from the Emperor, leading to a resolution where the Emperor considers the scholar's points.\n  - The Base Story, on the other hand, sets a darker, more grounded tone with an evil lord in a cavernous hall. The conflict is similarly introduced by the economist's arrival, but the arguments are more focused on practical economic issues. The resolution is the evil lord's contemplation of the economist's advice.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - The Author Written Story blends high fantasy elements with modern economic arguments, creating a unique juxtaposition. The use of stone dragons, a Demon Emperor, and a scholar from another world adds layers of creativity and imagination.\n  - The Base Story remains within the realm of dark fantasy, with a more straightforward approach to the economist's arguments. The creativity is less pronounced, focusing more on the practical implications of world domination.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - The Author Written Story develops the Demon Emperor as a powerful, enigmatic figure with a curiosity about the scholar's arguments. The setting is richly described, with stone dragons and shadows adding to the atmosphere. The scholar is portrayed as confident and knowledgeable, with a clear purpose.\n  - The Base Story develops Lord Malakar as a brooding, malevolent figure, with the setting described in dark, sinister terms. The economist, Harold Finch, is portrayed as determined and logical, but the character development is less detailed compared to the Author Written Story.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - The Author Written Story employs a formal, almost archaic tone, fitting the high fantasy setting. The dialogue is structured and respectful, with the Emperor's speech reflecting his authority. Descriptive language is used to create a vivid, immersive atmosphere.\n  - The Base Story uses a more modern, straightforward tone. The dialogue is direct and practical, with less emphasis on formality. Descriptive language is used to create a dark, foreboding atmosphere, but it lacks the richness of the Author Written Story.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a grand, fantastical setting that immediately captures the reader's imagination.

Use dialogue to reveal his character and his mission.\n    - Example: \"I am a leading expert in economics, and I have come with several reasons as to why Your Majesty shouldn't pursue world domination.\"\n  - Create an immersive setting with rich descriptions of the throne hall, the stone dragons, and the shadows. Use sensory details to bring the setting to life.\n    - Example: \"The stone dragons came to life, roaring, as the bespectacled scholar wearing weird clothing entered the Throne Hall.\"\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a formal, almost archaic tone to fit the high fantasy setting.

Passing by knights whispering about 'internet,' being greeted by princes and princesses that never met me, whom are trying to pretend they know me is annoying.\"\n  - Introduce conflict through the protagonist's interactions with the Emperor and the court's political dynamics. For example, \"The Emperor asked, 'Advisor...why does it seem that recently...all my children, whom previously retreated from the race for the Throne...came back even stronger?'\"\n  - Resolve the narrative by implementing a strategic plan involving the \"isekai people.\" For example, \"The meeting has started, and the Emperor didn't waste time to implement what we have discussed.\"\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Blend genres by incorporating elements of political intrigue, fantasy, and strategy. For example, \"The Crown Prince is as strong as a regular general of our border army.\"\n  - Reinterpret the prompt by making the protagonist an active participant in court politics, using their knowledge to advise the Emperor. For example, \"The Empire's vault needs to be opened, and tasks need to be given to everyone with plentiful rewards.\"\n  - Integrate imaginative elements like mental communication with the Emperor and strategic planning involving the \"isekai people.\" For example, \"The Emperor sent a mental message, 'New souls, or returnees?'\"\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as a knowledgeable and strategic Imperial Advisor, creating an emotional arc of frustration and resolution. For example, \"After all...I am the Imperial Advisor...and they shouldn't even react to me.\"\n  - Establish an immersive setting with detailed descriptions of the court, the Emperor, and the \"isekai people.\" For example, \"Seeing nobles whom had less than a boulder's intelligence come up with new ways of trading, and coming up with schemes that essentially cripple our enemies is...nice, but annoying to know the truth.\"\n  - Tie the setting to the story's tone and themes by highlighting the protagonist's strategic role and the court's political dynamics. For example, \"The Hall starts to fill with whispers and conversations.\"\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ formal and concise diction, reflecting the protagonist's role and the court's atmosphere. For example, \"Reincarnated beings Your Majesty.\"\n  - Use varied sentence structures, including dialogue, mental communication, and descriptive passages. For example, \"The Emperor just nodded, and continued to watch how things played out between all the participants.\"\n  - Maintain a serious and strategic tone, appropriate for the protagonist's role. For example, \"Although everyone has their own agenda, we have to be really careful to not let gaps in our authority roles, lest the Empire falls into the hands of outsiders.\"\n  - Use rhetorical devices like repetition (\"annoying\") and direct dialogue to create an engaging narrative. For example, \"The Emperor tapped gently the throne's arms, but the sound echoed loudly like a towering bell, silencing everyone.\"\n  - Employ a third-person limited perspective, focusing on the protagonist's thoughts and interactions. For example, \"The Emperor asked, 'Are they valuable to us?'\"\n  - Use descriptive language to create a vivid picture of the court and its inhabitants. For example, \"Soon, all people who seemed as if completely different began cleaning out monsters, spies, cults, bandits, and underground operations all over the Empire, for the sake of reputation and monetary rewards.\"\n  - Maintain a steady pacing, moving from observation to interaction to resolution. For example, \"The meeting has started, and the Emperor didn't waste time to implement what we have discussed.\"\n  - Use dialogue to reveal character motivations and advance the plot. For example, \"The Emperor asked, 'How many of them are?'\"\n</story_rules>",
