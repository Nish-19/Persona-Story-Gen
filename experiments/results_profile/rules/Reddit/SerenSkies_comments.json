    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**:\n   - The Author Written Story diverges significantly from the Base Story by creating a whimsical and fantastical narrative that reimagines the prompt in a unique setting. Instead of focusing on the existential and philosophical implications of a world populated by clones, the Author Written Story introduces a playful and humorous world where hobbits live in a primitive society. The plot is less about the individual experience of being cloned and more about the collective life and culture of these hobbits.
