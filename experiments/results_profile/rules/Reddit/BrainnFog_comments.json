    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a more intense and emotionally charged narrative compared to the Base Story. The plot is structured around the protagonist's internal struggle with his gift, focusing on the inevitability of death and the futility of trying to change fate. The story begins with the protagonist's disdain for the subway, a setting that symbolizes his entrapment by his ability. The narrative builds tension through the protagonist's memories of Ria, a past love whose death he could not prevent, and culminates in a tragic climax where multiple death dates align, leading to a catastrophic event. In contrast, the Base Story follows a more hopeful trajectory, where the protagonist attempts to change the fate of a new acquaintance, Ava, and succeeds, suggesting that his gift can be used for good.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively uses the protagonist's gift as a source of existential dread, exploring themes of inevitability and the burden of knowledge. The narrative is infused with a sense of fatalism, as the protagonist's attempts to alter fate are ultimately futile. The story's creativity lies in its exploration of the psychological impact of the gift, rather than focusing on the mechanics of changing fate, as seen in the Base Story. The Base Story, on the other hand, leans towards a more conventional narrative of hope and redemption, where the protagonist's gift becomes a tool for positive change.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story develops its protagonist as a deeply introspective and conflicted character, haunted by past failures and the weight of his gift. The setting of the subway is used effectively to mirror the protagonist's internal chaos and sense of entrapment. The narrative delves into the protagonist's emotional arc, particularly through his relationship with Ria, which adds depth to his character. In contrast, the Base Story focuses more on the external interactions between Lucas and Ava, with less emphasis on the protagonist's internal development. The setting of the bookshop in the Base Story serves as a refuge for Lucas, contrasting with the oppressive environment of the subway in the Author Written Story.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story employs a raw and visceral language style, using short, fragmented sentences to convey the protagonist's anxiety and despair. The narrative is rich with sensory details, creating an immersive and claustrophobic atmosphere. The use of repetition, particularly with the death dates, heightens the tension and sense of inevitability. In contrast, the Base Story uses a more polished and descriptive language style, with a focus on dialogue and character interactions. The tone is more hopeful and reflective, with a slower pacing that allows for character development and exploration of themes.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the narrative with the protagonist's aversion to a specific setting that symbolizes their entrapment by their gift.

    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a unique plot structure where the protagonist, referred to as \"MC,\" is a powerful yet paradoxically limited figure. The story begins with a tense hostage situation, immediately engaging the reader with high stakes. The MC's presence is introduced as a solution to the crisis, showcasing his intimidating aura and the limitations he has imposed on himself. The narrative then shifts to a reflective exploration of the MC's abilities and the self-imposed tenets that grant him power. This structure contrasts with the Base Story, which follows a more linear progression of the protagonist's journey and internal conflict. The Author Written Story uses a non-linear approach, interspersing action with introspection, and concludes with the MC's continued dominance and isolation, rather than a resolution or change.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively interprets the prompt by presenting a protagonist who is both omnipotent and constrained. The story blends elements of superhero fiction with philosophical musings on power and limitation. The MC's abilities are described through a series of tenets, each with a poetic and archaic phrasing that adds a mythical quality to the narrative. This approach differs from the Base Story, which focuses on the protagonist's internal struggle and eventual realization. The Author Written Story maintains a consistent tone of awe and mystery, emphasizing the MC's otherworldly nature.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story develops the MC as a mysterious and almost divine figure, whose limitations are both his source of power and his prison. The setting is minimal, focusing on the MC's interactions with the world through his aura and telepathic abilities. The story contrasts the MC's internal world of tenets with the external world of crime and justice. This differs from the Base Story, which provides a more detailed setting and character interactions, highlighting the protagonist's isolation and longing for connection. The Author Written Story emphasizes the MC's detachment and the impact of his presence on others.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story employs a formal and archaic language style, particularly in the description of the tenets, which enhances the mythical and philosophical tone. The narrative uses a mix of first-person introspection and third-person action, creating a dual perspective that reflects the MC's disembodied state. The language is precise and evocative, with a focus on the MC's aura and the reactions it elicits. This contrasts with the Base Story's more contemporary and conversational style, which focuses on the protagonist's emotional journey. The Author Written Story's language reinforces the themes of power, limitation, and isolation.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a high-stakes situation that immediately captures the reader's attention, such as a hostage crisis.

    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**:\n   - The Author Written Story presents a narrative where the protagonist, Ryu, and his partner, Marie, are small-time thieves who dream of a better life. The plot is driven by their desire to escape their past and start anew, which aligns with the prompt's theme of awakening powers in a moment of crisis. The story introduces conflict when superheroes, who are supposed to be protectors, turn out to be corrupt and violent, leading to a tragic event that triggers Ryu's powers. This differs from the Base Story, where the protagonist's powers are awakened in a more traditional heroic context.\n   - The Author Written Story resolves with Ryu embracing his newfound powers to protect Marie and vowing to take control of his destiny, contrasting with the Base Story's more introspective and uncertain resolution.\n\n2. **Creativity**:\n   - The Author Written Story creatively subverts the typical hero-villain dynamic by portraying superheroes as the antagonists, which is a unique twist on the prompt. This inversion adds depth to the narrative, as Ryu's powers are awakened not through a noble act but through a desperate need to protect a loved one from supposed heroes.\n   - The story also blends elements of crime drama with superhero fiction, creating a gritty and morally complex world that challenges traditional genre boundaries.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n   - Characters in the Author Written Story are developed through their backstories and relationships.

    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a narrative deeply rooted in personal memory and the emotional weight of remembrance. The protagonist, Conra, is haunted by memories of past battles and lost companions, which are intricately woven into the present narrative. The story is structured around Conra's internal struggle with his fate to remember, culminating in a desire to break free from this destiny. The plot is driven by a series of vivid flashbacks that reveal Conra's past and his relationships, particularly with Bethil, which adds depth to the narrative. In contrast, the Base Story follows Elara, who also bears the burden of memory, but the plot is more focused on her acceptance of this role and the discovery of a kindred spirit. The Author Written Story is more action-oriented, with a focus on the protagonist's internal conflict and the impact of his memories on his present actions.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively blends elements of fantasy and tragedy, using the motif of memory as both a curse and a driving force for the protagonist. The narrative is rich with imaginative elements, such as the elven village and the protagonist's interactions with mythical beings. The story reinterprets the prompt by focusing on the emotional and psychological aspects of memory, rather than just the act of remembering. The Base Story, while also imaginative, leans more towards a philosophical exploration of memory and its significance, with less emphasis on action and personal conflict.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story develops its characters through detailed flashbacks and emotional interactions. Conra is portrayed as a complex character, burdened by his memories and struggling with his fate.

The plot is structured around the protagonist's realization of their expendability and their decision to rebel against their fate by potentially inciting more conflict. The story begins with a reflection on the aftermath of war, transitions into a dialogue with HQ that reveals the protagonist's distrust and understanding of their situation, and concludes with a decisive action to avoid obsolescence. In contrast, the Base Story follows a more linear and external journey of self-discovery, where the protagonist explores the world and finds a new purpose in peaceful activities.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively explores the theme of obsolescence and rebellion through the lens of a cloned soldier. It uses the concept of cloning and technological advancement to delve into the moral and ethical implications of creating life for war. The story is imaginative in its portrayal of the protagonist's internal struggle and their ultimate decision to reject peace in favor of survival. The Base Story, on the other hand, takes a more conventional approach, focusing on the protagonist's adaptation to a peaceful world and their search for a new identity.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story develops its protagonist as a complex character who is both a product of war and a sentient being capable of independent thought.

The plot revolves around Amanda, an agent with clearance, who demands to see Prisoner 0, a powerful being held in a secure facility. The narrative builds suspense through Amanda's interactions with the warden and guards, leading to a confrontation with Prisoner 0. The story reveals that Prisoner 0's powers are not fully contained, and he has already thwarted an impending alien invasion. The plot concludes with a chilling realization of Prisoner 0's true nature and the precarious balance of power. In contrast, the Base Story follows a more straightforward escape narrative, focusing on the protagonist's internal monologue and eventual escape with the help of a sympathetic guard.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively subverts expectations by presenting a scenario where the supposed threat, Prisoner 0, is not only aware of his powers but has already acted on a global scale. The story blends elements of science fiction and psychological thriller, using the setting of a high-security prison to explore themes of power, control, and morality. The Base Story, while imaginative, adheres to a more conventional escape plot, lacking the same level of genre blending and thematic depth.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story develops its characters through dialogue and action, particularly focusing on Amanda's determination and Prisoner 0's enigmatic nature.

    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story begins in media res, with immediate action and conflict as the protagonist, Silas, is betrayed by his ally, Kalin, during a dangerous dungeon raid. The narrative is driven by intense action sequences and the protagonist's internal monologue, reflecting on past betrayals and the current situation. The story resolves with a twist, where Silas uses a pre-prepared spell to escape, leaving Kalin to face the consequences of his betrayal. This structure contrasts with the Base Story, which unfolds more gradually, focusing on dialogue and the emotional tension between the characters before the betrayal is revealed.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively integrates elements of fantasy, such as mental transmissions and swapping spells, to enhance the narrative's tension and surprise. The protagonist's preparation for betrayal is woven into the story through these magical elements, providing a unique twist on the prompt.

Silas is portrayed as a seasoned warrior, shaped by past betrayals, which informs his cautious and strategic nature.

Use magical abilities or artifacts that provide a strategic advantage, like the mental transmission and swapping spell in the Author Written Story.\n  - Ensure that these fantasy elements are seamlessly woven into the narrative, enhancing the plot and character development without overshadowing the core themes of betrayal and trust.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist through a combination of action and internal monologue, revealing their past experiences with betrayal and how these have shaped their current actions and mindset.
