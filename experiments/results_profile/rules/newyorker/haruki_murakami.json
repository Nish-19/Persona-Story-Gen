    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a unique plot structure that begins with an intriguing encounter between the protagonist and the ice man at a ski resort, leading to a relationship that defies societal norms. The narrative progresses through their marriage, the challenges they face, and culminates in a transformative journey to the South Pole. The plot is driven by the protagonist's internal conflict and the mysterious nature of the ice man, creating a sense of inevitability and foreboding. In contrast, the Base Story focuses more on the emotional and existential aspects of the relationship, with a less defined narrative arc and a more introspective resolution.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively blends elements of romance and fantasy, using the ice man as a metaphor for emotional distance and the unknown. The story explores themes of love, identity, and belonging through the lens of a fantastical relationship. The setting of the South Pole serves as a symbolic backdrop for the protagonist's isolation and the ice man's enigmatic nature. The Base Story, while also imaginative, leans more towards a philosophical exploration of love and existence, with less emphasis on the fantastical elements.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story develops its characters through their interactions and the protagonist's introspective narrative. The ice man is portrayed as both a literal and metaphorical figure, embodying the mystery and allure of the unknown. The setting transitions from a ski resort to the South Pole, reflecting the protagonist's emotional journey and the growing distance in the relationship. The Base Story focuses more on the internal development of the protagonist, with the setting serving as a backdrop for their existential reflections.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story employs a straightforward yet evocative language style, using dialogue and introspection to convey the protagonist's emotions and the enigmatic nature of the ice man.

    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a plot that is deeply introspective and symbolic, focusing on the protagonist's obsession with cooking spaghetti as a metaphor for solitude and introspection. The narrative is non-linear, with a strong emphasis on the protagonist's internal world and the symbolic act of cooking. The phone call introduces a subtle external conflict, but the resolution is more about the protagonist's internal realization rather than a concrete action. In contrast, the Base Story follows a more traditional narrative arc with a clear external conflict and resolution, where the protagonist actively helps a friend in distress.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story employs a highly creative and metaphorical approach, using the act of cooking spaghetti as a central motif to explore themes of loneliness and introspection. The narrative is rich with imaginative descriptions and symbolic language, creating a dreamlike atmosphere. The Base Story, while creative, adheres more closely to a realistic and straightforward narrative style, focusing on the protagonist's actions and interactions with others.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: In the Author Written Story, the protagonist is developed through introspection and symbolic actions, with the setting serving as an extension of their internal state. The apartment is described in sensory detail, emphasizing the protagonist's isolation. Characters from the protagonist's imagination are introduced but never materialize, reinforcing the theme of solitude. The Base Story provides more detailed character interactions and development, with a focus on relationships and emotional arcs. The setting is described in a way that supports the narrative's external conflict.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story uses poetic and symbolic language, with a focus on sensory details and metaphor. The narrative voice is introspective and contemplative, with a rhythm that mirrors the protagonist's repetitive actions. Dialogue is minimal and serves to enhance the protagonist's internal conflict. The Base Story uses more direct and descriptive language, with dialogue playing a significant role in advancing the plot and character development. The tone is more straightforward and realistic, focusing on external events and interactions.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative around a central metaphor or motif, such as cooking spaghetti, to explore deeper themes of solitude and introspection. Use this motif to frame the protagonist's internal journey rather than focusing solely on external events.\n  - Introduce an external conflict subtly, such as a phone call from the past, but allow the resolution to focus on the protagonist's internal realization or change in perspective rather than a concrete action. For example, the protagonist may choose not to engage with the external conflict, highlighting their desire to remain isolated.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Employ a highly metaphorical and symbolic approach to storytelling. Use the act of cooking spaghetti as a metaphor for the protagonist's emotional state and internal struggles. Describe the process in vivid, imaginative detail to create a dreamlike atmosphere.\n  - Incorporate elements of magical realism or surrealism, such as imagined visitors or symbolic actions, to blur the line between reality and the protagonist's internal world. For instance, describe the protagonist imagining different people visiting them while cooking, but never having these visitors materialize.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist through introspection and symbolic actions rather than direct interactions with other characters. Use the setting, such as a small apartment, to reflect the protagonist's internal state and emphasize their isolation.\n  - Introduce secondary characters through the protagonist's imagination or memories, reinforcing the theme of solitude. These characters should remain abstract and serve to highlight the protagonist's internal conflict rather than advancing the plot through direct interaction.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use poetic and symbolic language to create a rich, sensory experience. Focus on detailed descriptions of the cooking process and the sensory environment, such as the smell of spices or the sound of boiling water, to immerse the reader in the protagonist's world.\n  - Maintain an introspective and contemplative narrative voice, with a rhythm that mirrors the protagonist's repetitive actions. Use minimal dialogue, allowing the protagonist's internal monologue and sensory descriptions to drive the narrative. For example, describe the protagonist's thoughts and feelings in a way that reflects their solitude and introspection, such as \"Thinking about spaghetti that boils eternally but is never done is a sad, sad thing.\"\n</story_rules>"
