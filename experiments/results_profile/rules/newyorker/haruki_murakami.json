    "<thinking>\n- Detailed reasoning and analysis here on how the base_story differs from the ground-truth, organized by the four narrative categories:\n  1. **Plot**:\n     - The Ground Truth story follows a clear narrative arc from meeting the ice man, developing a relationship, facing familial opposition, getting married, and eventually moving to the South Pole where the relationship deteriorates. The story ends with the protagonist feeling lonely and pregnant.\n     - The Base Story, on the other hand, focuses more on the protagonist's internal experience and the enigmatic nature of the ice man. It lacks the detailed progression of events and external conflicts present in the Ground Truth story.\n  2. **Creativity**:\n     - The Ground Truth story uses a blend of realism and fantasy, integrating the ice man into a mundane setting and exploring the practicalities of their life together.\n     - The Base Story leans heavily into poetic and abstract descriptions, emphasizing the mysterious and ephemeral nature of the ice man and the protagonist's emotional journey.\n  3. **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n     - The Ground Truth story provides detailed character development, particularly of the protagonist and her relationship with the ice man. The setting transitions from a ski resort to their apartment and finally to the South Pole, each location contributing to the narrative.\n     - The Base Story focuses more on the setting of the South Pole and the ice man's mysterious nature, with less emphasis on the protagonist's background and their life together.\n  4. **Language Use**:\n     - The Ground Truth story uses straightforward, descriptive language to convey the plot and character emotions. Dialogue is used to reveal character traits and advance the story.\n     - The Base Story employs more poetic and metaphorical language, creating a dreamlike and introspective tone. Dialogue is sparse and often serves to enhance the enigmatic atmosphere rather than drive the plot.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with a clear introduction of the protagonist meeting the ice man in a specific, relatable setting.\n  - Develop the relationship through a series of events, including dating, familial opposition, and marriage.\n  - Introduce a significant change or conflict that challenges the relationship, such as a move to a new location.\n  - Conclude the story with a resolution that reflects the protagonist's emotional state and the impact of the relationship on their life.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Blend elements of realism and fantasy, integrating the ice man into everyday life and exploring the practicalities of their relationship.\n  - Use imaginative scenarios and settings that enhance the fantastical elements of the story.\n  - Incorporate subtle humor or irony to add depth to the narrative.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop multidimensional characters with clear emotional arcs, particularly focusing on the protagonist and the ice man.\n  - Provide detailed descriptions of settings that contribute to the narrative and reflect the characters' emotional states.\n  - Show the progression of the relationship through interactions and dialogue, revealing character traits and dynamics.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use straightforward, descriptive language to convey the plot and character emotions clearly.\n  - Employ dialogue to reveal character traits, advance the story, and create emotional depth.\n  - Maintain a consistent tone that reflects the themes of love, mystery, and emotional distance.\n  - Use metaphors and similes sparingly to enhance descriptions without overshadowing the narrative.\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>\n- Detailed reasoning and analysis here on how the base_story differs from the ground-truth, organized by the four narrative categories:\n  1. **Plot**: The Ground Truth story focuses on the protagonist's obsessive spaghetti cooking as a metaphor for solitude and the passage of time. The plot is more introspective, with the phone call serving as a brief, almost surreal interruption. The Base Story, however, introduces a more conventional narrative arc with a clear problem (Caroline's missing husband) and resolution (finding David and helping Caroline).\n  2. **Creativity**: The Ground Truth story employs a unique blend of surrealism and metaphor, using the act of cooking spaghetti to explore themes of loneliness and memory. The Base Story is more straightforward, using a realistic and linear approach to storytelling.\n  3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Ground Truth story develops the protagonist's character through their solitary rituals and internal monologue, creating a vivid sense of their emotional state. The setting is described in a way that enhances the protagonist's isolation. The Base Story provides more detailed backstories for the characters and a more dynamic interaction between them, but it lacks the same depth of introspection.\n  4. **Language Use**: The Ground Truth story uses poetic and evocative language, with a focus on sensory details and metaphor. The pacing is slow and reflective, matching the protagonist's introspective nature. The Base Story uses more straightforward and descriptive language, with a faster pace to match the unfolding events.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Center the narrative around the protagonist's obsessive spaghetti cooking, using it as a metaphor for their solitude and the passage of time.\n  - Introduce the phone call as a brief, almost surreal interruption to the protagonist's routine, rather than a central plot point.\n  - Focus on the protagonist's internal monologue and reflections, rather than external events or interactions.\n  - Conclude the story with a sense of unresolved tension, emphasizing the protagonist's continued isolation and introspection.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use surreal and metaphorical elements to explore themes of loneliness and memory, such as imagining visitors who never actually appear.\n  - Incorporate poetic and evocative descriptions of the cooking process, making it a central and symbolic activity.\n  - Blend genres subtly, using elements of magical realism to enhance the introspective and metaphorical nature of the story.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist's character through their solitary rituals and internal monologue, creating a vivid sense of their emotional state.\n  - Describe the setting in a way that enhances the protagonist's isolation, using sensory details to create an immersive atmosphere.\n  - Keep secondary characters indistinct and peripheral, focusing on the protagonist's perspective and experiences.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ poetic and evocative language, with a focus on sensory details and metaphor to create a rich and immersive narrative.\n  - Maintain a slow and reflective pacing, matching the protagonist's introspective nature and the repetitive nature of their cooking ritual.\n  - Use dialogue sparingly and ensure it contributes to the overall sense of isolation and introspection.\n  - Create a tone that is melancholic and contemplative, reflecting the protagonist's emotional state and the themes of the story.\n</story_rules>"
