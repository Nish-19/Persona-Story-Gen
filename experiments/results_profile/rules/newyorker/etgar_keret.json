    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a unique narrative structure by embedding a story within a story. The protagonist, Maya, writes a story about a world where people can split themselves into two younger versions, and the narrative explores her creative process and personal life. This meta-narrative approach contrasts with the straightforward plot of the Base Story, which focuses solely on the protagonist's life and societal impact. The Author Written Story uses Maya's writing as a vehicle to explore themes of identity, societal pressure, and personal grief, while the Base Story directly addresses the societal implications of not splitting.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story employs a creative blend of meta-narrative and character-driven storytelling. It uses Maya's stories as a reflection of her internal struggles and societal observations, adding layers to the narrative. This approach contrasts with the Base Story's more linear and direct exploration of the prompt. The Author Written Story's creativity lies in its ability to weave personal and societal narratives through Maya's writing, offering a multifaceted exploration of the prompt's themes.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story develops its characters through their interactions and personal growth, particularly focusing on Maya and her husband, Aviad. The setting is less about the physical world and more about the emotional and psychological landscapes of the characters. This contrasts with the Base Story, which emphasizes the protagonist's external environment and societal interactions. The Author Written Story uses Maya's creative journey and personal experiences to deepen character development, while the Base Story focuses on the protagonist's societal role and impact.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story employs a reflective and introspective tone, using detailed descriptions and emotional depth to convey the characters' inner worlds. It uses dialogue and narrative to explore complex themes, such as grief and societal expectations. This contrasts with the Base Story's more descriptive and observational language, which focuses on the protagonist's external experiences and societal interactions. The Author Written Story's language is rich in metaphor and introspection, providing a deeper emotional resonance.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative with a meta-narrative approach, embedding a story within a story.

    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a more chaotic and emotionally charged narrative compared to the Base Story. The plot is driven by the father's desperation and frustration, which is evident in his internal monologue and interactions. The story unfolds in a single setting\u2014the mall\u2014where the father attempts to fulfill his son's unusual request. The conflict is not just external (the difficulty of buying the cash register) but also internal, as the father grapples with his feelings towards his ex-wife and his desire to be a good father. The resolution is ambiguous, focusing on the father's relationship with his son rather than a neat conclusion.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story employs a raw and gritty realism, diverging from the more sentimental and polished approach of the Base Story. The narrative is infused with dark humor and a sense of absurdity, particularly in the father's interactions with the store employees and his internal thoughts. The story creatively uses the setting of the mall to reflect the father's chaotic emotional state and the societal pressures he feels.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: Characters in the Author Written Story are developed through sharp, often harsh dialogue and internal monologue. The father is portrayed as deeply flawed yet relatable, with his love for his son juxtaposed against his bitterness towards his ex-wife. The setting of the mall is vividly depicted, not as a place of wonder but as a crowded, almost oppressive environment that mirrors the father's internal turmoil.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The language in the Author Written Story is colloquial and unfiltered, capturing the father's raw emotions and thoughts. The narrative voice is direct and often confrontational, with a heavy use of dialogue and internal monologue to convey the father's perspective. The pacing is brisk, with short, punchy sentences that heighten the sense of urgency and tension. The story uses vivid imagery and metaphors to enhance the emotional impact, such as comparing the father's struggle to running up a down escalator.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative around a single, emotionally charged day, focusing on the father's attempt to fulfill his son's unusual request amidst personal turmoil.\n  - Introduce conflict through both external obstacles (e.g., difficulty in purchasing the cash register) and internal struggles (e.g., the father's feelings towards his ex-wife and his role as a father).\n  - Resolve the story with an emphasis on the father-son relationship, leaving some elements open-ended to reflect the ongoing nature of their challenges.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Infuse the narrative with dark humor and a sense of absurdity, particularly in the father's interactions and internal monologue.\n  - Use the setting of the mall creatively to reflect the father's chaotic emotional state and societal pressures, portraying it as a crowded and almost oppressive environment.\n  - Incorporate elements of gritty realism, avoiding overly sentimental or polished depictions of events and emotions.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through sharp, often harsh dialogue and internal monologue, revealing their flaws and complexities.\n  - Portray the father as deeply flawed yet relatable, with his love for his son juxtaposed against his bitterness towards his ex-wife.\n  - Depict the mall setting vividly, using sensory details to create an immersive and emotionally resonant environment that mirrors the father's internal turmoil.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ colloquial and unfiltered language to capture the father's raw emotions and thoughts, using direct and often confrontational narrative voice.\n  - Use short, punchy sentences to create a brisk pacing that heightens the sense of urgency and tension.\n  - Incorporate vivid imagery and metaphors to enhance the emotional impact, such as comparing the father's struggle to running up a down escalator.\n  - Include verbatim examples from the Author Written Story, such as \"You have to run as fast as you can so you won\u2019t be dragged down, have to strain the whole time not to fall on your ass. Just like in life,\" to illustrate the use of metaphor and tone.\n</story_rules>",
    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a more complex and layered narrative structure compared to the Base Story. It begins with an immediate sense of tension and urgency as the father and son encounter a man on the rooftop. The narrative is interwoven with the father's internal monologue, revealing his past trauma and guilt, which adds depth to the current situation. The story does not resolve with a clear-cut happy ending; instead, it leaves the reader with a sense of unresolved tension and emotional complexity. The Base Story, in contrast, follows a more straightforward and linear plot, with a clear resolution where the man is talked down from the ledge, and a hopeful future is implied.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively blends elements of realism with a child's imaginative perspective, as seen in P.T.'s belief that the man might be a superhero. This juxtaposition of innocence and harsh reality adds a unique layer to the narrative. The story also uses the father's past experiences to draw parallels with the current situation, enriching the narrative with emotional depth. The Base Story, while imaginative, remains more grounded in a single narrative perspective and lacks the same level of creative interplay between reality and imagination.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story develops its characters through introspection and dialogue, particularly focusing on the father's internal struggles and his relationship with his son. The setting is described in a way that reflects the father's emotional state, such as the \"ugly, four-story building\" and the \"sun hanging directly above it, blinding me.\" The Base Story provides a more external view of the characters, focusing on their actions and dialogue without delving deeply into their internal worlds. The setting in the Base Story is more of a backdrop and less tied to the characters' emotional experiences.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story employs a conversational and introspective tone, with a mix of direct dialogue and internal monologue. The language is vivid and descriptive, using metaphors and similes to convey the father's emotional state, such as \"as if it had some kind of skin disease\" to describe the building. The story also uses rhetorical questions and repetition to emphasize the father's internal conflict. The Base Story uses a more straightforward narrative style, with clear and concise language that focuses on external actions and dialogue rather than internal thoughts and emotions.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with an immediate sense of tension and urgency. Introduce the conflict early by having the child notice the man on the rooftop, prompting a visceral reaction from the father.\n  - Interweave the main narrative with the protagonist's internal monologue, revealing past traumas or guilt that parallel the current situation. Use these reflections to add depth and complexity to the narrative.\n  - Avoid a neatly resolved ending. Instead, leave the story with a sense of unresolved tension or emotional complexity, reflecting the ongoing struggles of the characters.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Blend elements of realism with a child's imaginative perspective. Use the child's innocent questions or beliefs to juxtapose the harsh reality of the situation, adding a unique layer to the narrative.\n  - Draw parallels between the protagonist's past experiences and the current situation. Use these parallels to enrich the narrative with emotional depth and complexity.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through introspection and dialogue. Focus on the protagonist's internal struggles and their relationship with other characters, particularly the child.\n  - Describe the setting in a way that reflects the protagonist's emotional state. Use vivid and sometimes unsettling imagery to convey the mood and tone of the story, such as describing a building as \"ugly\" or \"blinding.\"\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a conversational and introspective tone, mixing direct dialogue with internal monologue. Use vivid and descriptive language, incorporating metaphors and similes to convey emotional states.\n  - Use rhetorical questions and repetition to emphasize the protagonist's internal conflict and emotional turmoil. For example, \"How did you know? How did you know she died?\" to convey a sense of desperation and urgency.\n  - Incorporate a mix of short, impactful sentences and longer, reflective passages to create a dynamic narrative pace that mirrors the protagonist's emotional journey.\n</story_rules>"
