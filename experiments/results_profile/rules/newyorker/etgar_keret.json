    "<thinking>\n- Detailed reasoning and analysis here on how the base_story differs from the ground-truth, organized by the four narrative categories:\n  1. **Plot**: The Ground Truth story is structured around a series of short stories written by Maya, with a focus on her personal and emotional journey, particularly in the context of her relationship with Aviad and her experiences in a writing workshop. The narrative is interspersed with reflections on the stories she writes and their reception. The Base Story, on the other hand, follows a more linear plot centered on Laura Fischer's life and her decision not to split, exploring the societal implications and personal consequences of her choice.\n  2. **Creativity**: The Ground Truth story employs a meta-narrative technique, blending Maya's fictional stories with her real-life experiences, creating a layered and introspective narrative. It uses irony and humor, particularly in the stories Maya writes, to explore deeper themes. The Base Story is more straightforward, focusing on the speculative element of splitting and its impact on society, with a more serious and contemplative tone.\n  3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Ground Truth story develops characters through their interactions and emotional responses, particularly focusing on Maya and Aviad's relationship and Maya's growth as a writer. The setting is primarily domestic and intimate, with detailed descriptions of the writing workshop and Maya's home life. The Base Story develops Laura's character through her actions and reflections, with a strong emphasis on her garden and the library as key settings that symbolize her inner life and choices.\n  4. **Language Use**: The Ground Truth story uses a conversational and reflective tone, with detailed descriptions and a focus on internal monologues and dialogues that reveal character motivations and emotions. The Base Story uses a more descriptive and contemplative tone, with a focus on the external environment and Laura's interactions with others, using language to create a sense of tranquility and introspection.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative around a central character's personal and emotional journey, interspersed with reflections on their creative or professional endeavors.\n  - Introduce conflict through societal norms and personal choices, exploring the repercussions of defying these norms.\n  - Resolve the narrative with a sense of personal fulfillment and societal impact, highlighting the protagonist's influence on others.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Employ a meta-narrative technique, blending fictional elements with the protagonist's real-life experiences to create a layered and introspective narrative.\n  - Use irony and humor to explore deeper themes, particularly in the protagonist's creative or professional work.\n  - Integrate unconventional or imaginative elements that reflect the protagonist's inner life and struggles.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through their interactions and emotional responses, focusing on relationships and personal growth.\n  - Create immersive settings that symbolize the protagonist's inner life and choices, using detailed descriptions to establish a strong sense of place.\n  - Highlight the protagonist's personal spaces, such as a home or workplace, as key settings that reflect their journey and values.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use a conversational and reflective tone, with detailed descriptions that reveal character motivations and emotions.\n  - Focus on internal monologues and dialogues to develop characters and explore their inner conflicts.\n  - Employ descriptive language to create a sense of tranquility and introspection, using the external environment to mirror the protagonist's inner state.\n</story_rules>",
