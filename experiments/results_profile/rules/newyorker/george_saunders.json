    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story is structured as a letter from a sales representative to a dissatisfied customer, which is a unique approach compared to the more traditional narrative style of the Base Story. The conflict is introduced through the customer's dissatisfaction with the product, and the resolution is attempted through the sales rep's enthusiastic offer of an upgrade. The story engages with the prompt by focusing on the sales rep's perspective and their attempt to convince the customer of the product's value, rather than the customer's experience with the product itself.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story creatively uses the format of a letter to convey the narrative, which allows for a direct and personal tone. The story blends humor and satire, particularly in the exaggerated enthusiasm of the sales rep and the absurdity of the product's features. This approach contrasts with the more straightforward and serious tone of the Base Story, which focuses on the emotional journey of the parent.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Author Written Story develops the character of the sales rep through their voice and tone in the letter, revealing their personality and motivations. The setting is implied through the context of the letter and the references to the product and the customer's home. The story focuses more on the interaction between the sales rep and the customer, rather than the physical setting or the customer's personal life, as seen in the Base Story.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story employs a conversational and informal tone, with a mix of humor and sincerity. The use of rhetorical questions, parenthetical asides, and direct address to the customer creates a sense of immediacy and engagement. The language is playful and exaggerated, reflecting the sales rep's enthusiasm and the absurdity of the product. This contrasts with the more descriptive and introspective language of the Base Story, which focuses on the emotional experience of the parent.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the story as a letter from a sales representative to a dissatisfied customer, using the letter format to introduce and resolve the conflict.\n  - Focus on the sales rep's perspective, emphasizing their attempt to convince the customer of the product's value through an enthusiastic offer of an upgrade.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Use the letter format to convey the narrative, allowing for a direct and personal tone that blends humor and satire.\n  - Incorporate exaggerated enthusiasm and absurdity in the product's features, using humor to highlight the sales rep's perspective.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the character of the sales rep through their voice and tone in the letter, revealing their personality and motivations.\n  - Focus on the interaction between the sales rep and the customer, using the context of the letter to imply the setting and the customer's situation.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Employ a conversational and informal tone, using rhetorical questions, parenthetical asides, and direct address to create a sense of immediacy and engagement.\n  - Use playful and exaggerated language to reflect the sales rep's enthusiasm and the absurdity of the product, as seen in phrases like \"glub glub glub\" and \"SimuLips.\"\n</story_rules>"
