    "<thinking>\n- Detailed reasoning and analysis here on how the base_story differs from the ground-truth, organized by the four narrative categories:\n  1. **Plot**:\n     - The Ground Truth story is structured as a letter from a sales representative to a dissatisfied customer, addressing the concerns raised about the product and offering an upgrade. The narrative is linear and focuses on the sales rep's perspective, providing detailed explanations and personal anecdotes to persuade the customer.\n     - The Base Story follows a more traditional narrative structure, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. It focuses on the experiences of a mother, Ellen, who becomes uneasy with the product and attempts to return it. The plot includes her interactions with customer service and her ultimate decision to reject the product.\n\n  2. **Creativity**:\n     - The Ground Truth story employs a unique format (a letter) and uses humor and irony to convey the absurdity of the product and the sales rep's overly enthusiastic attitude. The creativity lies in the detailed and exaggerated descriptions of the product's features and the rep's personal anecdotes.\n     - The Base Story uses a more conventional narrative style, blending elements of psychological thriller and speculative fiction. The creativity is evident in the eerie and unsettling tone, as well as the exploration of the product's impact on the mother and child.\n\n  3. **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n     - The Ground Truth story develops the character of the sales rep through his enthusiastic and somewhat desperate tone, revealing his personal life and motivations. The setting is primarily the sales rep's office, with references to the customer's home.\n     - The Base Story develops the character of Ellen through her thoughts, feelings, and interactions with the product and customer service. The setting includes her home, the customer service center, and the nursery, creating a more immersive and emotionally charged environment.\n\n  4. **Language Use**:\n     - The Ground Truth story uses a conversational and informal tone, with a mix of technical jargon and personal anecdotes. The language is descriptive and humorous, with a focus on persuading the customer.\n     - The Base Story uses a more formal and descriptive language, with a focus on creating an eerie and unsettling atmosphere. The dialogue is used to reveal character emotions and advance the plot, while the narrative descriptions build tension and suspense.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the story as a letter from a sales representative to a dissatisfied customer, addressing the concerns raised about the product.\n  - Focus on the sales rep's perspective, providing detailed explanations and personal anecdotes to persuade the customer.\n  - Include a clear offer of an upgrade to the product, emphasizing the benefits and personalized features.\n  - Ensure the narrative is linear and maintains a consistent focus on the sales rep's attempt to resolve the customer's dissatisfaction.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Employ a unique format, such as a letter, to convey the story.\n  - Use humor and irony to highlight the absurdity of the product and the sales rep's overly enthusiastic attitude.\n  - Provide detailed and exaggerated descriptions of the product's features and the sales rep's personal anecdotes.\n  - Integrate imaginative and unconventional elements to enhance the story's creativity.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the character of the sales rep through an enthusiastic and somewhat desperate tone, revealing personal life and motivations.\n  - Establish the setting primarily in the sales rep's office, with references to the customer's home.\n  - Create a multidimensional character by including personal anecdotes and emotional arcs.\n  - Ensure the setting is immersive and tied to the story's tone and themes.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use a conversational and informal tone, mixing technical jargon with personal anecdotes.\n  - Employ descriptive and humorous language to engage the reader.\n  - Focus on persuading the customer through detailed explanations and personal stories.\n  - Maintain a consistent tone that reflects the sales rep's enthusiasm and determination to resolve the issue.\n</story_rules>"
