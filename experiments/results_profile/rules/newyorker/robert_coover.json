    "<thinking>\n- Detailed reasoning and analysis here on how the base_story differs from the ground-truth, organized by the four narrative categories:\n  1. Plot: The Ground Truth story presents a non-linear, fragmented narrative that blurs the lines between reality and memory. It features a series of disjointed events and encounters that create a sense of confusion and disorientation. The protagonist's life is depicted as a continuous loop of repetitive actions and fleeting moments, with no clear resolution or climax. In contrast, the Base Story follows a more linear and coherent plot structure, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The protagonist's journey is more introspective and focused on finding moments of clarity and connection within the fog of his memories.\n  \n  2. Creativity: The Ground Truth story employs a surreal and almost absurdist approach, with elements like Kewpie dolls and fragmented memories serving as recurring motifs that add to the story's dreamlike quality. The narrative is filled with ironic and darkly humorous moments, creating a sense of existential absurdity. The Base Story, on the other hand, takes a more conventional approach to creativity, using the fog and the bar as metaphors for the protagonist's internal struggle. The story is more grounded in reality, with a focus on introspection and emotional connection.\n  \n  3. Development (Character and Setting): The Ground Truth story develops its characters through their actions and interactions, often leaving their motivations and emotions ambiguous. The protagonist is depicted as a passive observer of his own life, with little control over his actions or decisions. The setting is described in a fragmented and disjointed manner, reflecting the protagonist's confused state of mind. In contrast, the Base Story provides more detailed and coherent descriptions of the characters and setting. The protagonist is more introspective and self-aware, and the setting is described in a way that enhances the story's mood and themes.\n  \n  4. Language Use: The Ground Truth story uses a terse and fragmented writing style, with short, abrupt sentences that mirror the protagonist's disjointed thoughts and memories. The language is often ambiguous and open to interpretation, creating a sense of uncertainty and confusion. The Base Story, on the other hand, uses more descriptive and flowing language, with longer sentences and detailed descriptions that create a more immersive and coherent narrative. The dialogue is more natural and reflective, adding depth to the characters and their interactions.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative in a non-linear, fragmented manner, with events and encounters presented in a disjointed sequence.\n  - Create a sense of confusion and disorientation by blurring the lines between reality and memory.\n  - Depict the protagonist's life as a continuous loop of repetitive actions and fleeting moments, with no clear resolution or climax.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Employ surreal and absurdist elements, such as recurring motifs like Kewpie dolls and fragmented memories, to add a dreamlike quality to the story.\n  - Incorporate ironic and darkly humorous moments to create a sense of existential absurdity.\n  - Use unconventional and imaginative elements to reinterpret the writing prompt in a unique and thought-provoking way.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through their actions and interactions, often leaving their motivations and emotions ambiguous.\n  - Depict the protagonist as a passive observer of his own life, with little control over his actions or decisions.\n  - Describe the setting in a fragmented and disjointed manner, reflecting the protagonist's confused state of mind.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use a terse and fragmented writing style, with short, abrupt sentences that mirror the protagonist's disjointed thoughts and memories.\n  - Employ ambiguous and open-ended language to create a sense of uncertainty and confusion.\n  - Use dialogue that is natural and reflective, adding depth to the characters and their interactions.\n</story_rules>",
