    "<thinking>\n- Detailed reasoning and analysis here on how the base_story differs from the ground-truth, organized by the four narrative categories:\n  1. **Plot**: The Ground Truth story focuses on a repetitive and escalating conflict between the husband and wife, driven by the husband's refusal to wear his hearing aid and the wife's increasing frustration. The climax is tragic, with the wife dying after falling down the stairs while responding to her husband's calls. The Base Story, on the other hand, presents a more subdued and reflective narrative, emphasizing the emotional distance and eventual understanding between the couple. The conflict is less intense, and the resolution is more about emotional reconciliation than a dramatic event.\n  2. **Creativity**: The Ground Truth story employs a cyclical structure, with the husband's calls and the wife's responses creating a sense of relentless routine. The story uses irony and dark humor, particularly in the tragic ending. The Base Story is more linear and contemplative, focusing on the emotional landscape of the characters and their relationship. It lacks the dark humor and irony present in the Ground Truth story.\n  3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Ground Truth story develops the characters through their actions and interactions, highlighting the husband's stubbornness and the wife's growing exasperation. The setting is described in a way that emphasizes the physical distance and barriers within the house. The Base Story provides more detailed descriptions of the setting and uses it to reflect the characters' emotional states. The characters are developed through introspection and dialogue, with a focus on their internal struggles.\n  4. **Language Use**: The Ground Truth story uses repetitive and urgent language to convey the husband's constant calls and the wife's frustration. The tone is tense and exasperated, with a focus on the immediacy of the conflict. The Base Story uses more descriptive and reflective language, creating a slower pace and a more contemplative tone. The dialogue is softer and more introspective, emphasizing the emotional distance and eventual understanding between the characters.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the story around a repetitive and escalating conflict between the main characters, driven by a specific behavior or habit.\n  - Introduce a tragic or dramatic climax that results from the ongoing conflict, providing a sense of finality and resolution.\n  - Use a cyclical narrative structure to emphasize the routine and relentlessness of the conflict.\n  - Ensure the conflict is directly tied to the characters' actions and interactions, creating a sense of inevitability.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Employ a cyclical structure to create a sense of routine and inevitability in the narrative.\n  - Use irony and dark humor to highlight the absurdity and tragedy of the situation.\n  - Integrate unconventional or imaginative elements that enhance the story's themes and tone.\n  - Reinterpret the prompt in a way that emphasizes the emotional and psychological aspects of the characters' experiences.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop characters through their actions and interactions, highlighting their flaws and the impact of their behavior on each other.\n  - Create a setting that emphasizes physical distance and barriers, reflecting the characters' emotional states.\n  - Use the setting to enhance the story's tone and themes, making it an integral part of the narrative.\n  - Establish multidimensional characters with clear emotional arcs, showing their growth or decline throughout the story.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use repetitive and urgent language to convey the ongoing conflict and the characters' emotional states.\n  - Maintain a tense and exasperated tone, reflecting the immediacy and intensity of the conflict.\n  - Employ descriptive language to create vivid and immersive settings that enhance the story's themes.\n  - Use dialogue to reveal the characters' emotions and motivations, ensuring it is consistent with their development and the story's tone.\n</story_rules>"
