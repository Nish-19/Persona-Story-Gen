    "<thinking>\n- Detailed reasoning and analysis here on how the base_story differs from the ground-truth, organized by the four narrative categories:\n  1. **Plot**: The Ground Truth story presents a more complex and layered plot, with multiple subplots and a broader range of events and interactions among the professors. It includes detailed descriptions of the construction issues, the professors' personal struggles, and their collective attempts to address the problems. The Base Story, on the other hand, focuses more narrowly on a single protagonist's experience and the immediate impact of the construction on her life, with a simpler and more linear narrative.\n  2. **Creativity**: The Ground Truth story employs a higher degree of creativity in its narrative, using humor, irony, and vivid imagery to convey the absurdity and frustration of the situation. It also incorporates a wider range of perspectives and experiences, adding depth and richness to the story. The Base Story is more straightforward and serious in tone, with less emphasis on creative elements and a more conventional approach to storytelling.\n  3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Ground Truth story features a diverse cast of characters, each with their own distinct personalities, backgrounds, and concerns. The setting is vividly described, with detailed attention to the physical and emotional impact of the construction on the professors' lives. The Base Story, while it does develop its main character and setting, does so in a more limited and less detailed manner, focusing primarily on the protagonist's perspective and experiences.\n  4. **Language Use**: The Ground Truth story uses rich, descriptive language and a varied narrative style to create an engaging and immersive reading experience. It employs a mix of dialogue, internal monologue, and detailed descriptions to convey the characters' emotions and the chaotic environment. The Base Story uses simpler and more direct language, with a more uniform narrative style and less emphasis on descriptive detail and varied sentence structure.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Introduce multiple subplots and a broader range of events to create a complex and layered narrative.\n  - Include detailed descriptions of the construction issues, the professors' personal struggles, and their collective attempts to address the problems.\n  - Use a mix of virtual meetings, email exchanges, and in-person interactions to show the progression of the conflict and the professors' responses.\n  - Incorporate elements of irony and absurdity to highlight the challenges and frustrations faced by the professors.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Employ humor and irony to convey the absurdity and frustration of the situation.\n  - Use vivid imagery and creative descriptions to bring the setting and characters to life.\n  - Incorporate a wide range of perspectives and experiences to add depth and richness to the story.\n  - Blend genres and use unconventional elements to create a unique and engaging narrative.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop a diverse cast of characters, each with their own distinct personalities, backgrounds, and concerns.\n  - Create emotional arcs for the characters, showing their growth and development over the course of the story.\n  - Establish an immersive setting with detailed descriptions of the physical and emotional impact of the construction on the professors' lives.\n  - Use interactions among the characters to reveal their personalities and relationships.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use rich, descriptive language to create an engaging and immersive reading experience.\n  - Employ a varied narrative style, mixing dialogue, internal monologue, and detailed descriptions.\n  - Use humor, irony, and vivid imagery to enhance the storytelling.\n  - Vary sentence structure and pacing to maintain reader interest and convey the chaotic environment.\n</story_rules>",
