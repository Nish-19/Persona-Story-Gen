    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a non-linear, introspective narrative that blurs the boundaries between reality and imagination. The plot is less about a sequence of events and more about the internal musings of the narrator, who reflects on the nature of stories, time, and existence. The glowing strangers serve as a catalyst for these reflections, rather than a direct plot device. In contrast, the Base Story follows a more traditional linear plot structure, where the protagonist encounters the glowing strangers, engages in a brief conversation, and experiences a personal revelation.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story employs a highly abstract and philosophical approach, using the glowing strangers as a metaphor for deeper existential themes. The narrative is rich with metaphorical language and philosophical musings, challenging the reader to ponder the nature of stories and time. The Base Story, while imaginative, remains grounded in a more conventional narrative style, using the glowing strangers to evoke nostalgia and personal reflection.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: In the Author Written Story, character development is minimal and abstract, focusing more on the narrator's internal dialogue and philosophical reflections. The setting is vividly described but serves as a backdrop for the narrator's musings rather than a central element. The Base Story, on the other hand, provides more concrete character interactions and a detailed setting that enhances the narrative's emotional impact.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story is characterized by its poetic and fragmented language, with a focus on rhythm, repetition, and philosophical inquiry. The narrative voice is introspective and contemplative, often breaking the fourth wall to engage directly with the reader. The Base Story uses more straightforward and descriptive language, with clear dialogue and a focus on sensory details to create an immersive experience.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Construct the narrative around the internal reflections of the narrator, using the glowing strangers as a catalyst for philosophical musings rather than a direct plot device. For example, explore themes of time and existence through the narrator's thoughts as they encounter the strangers.\n  - Avoid a linear plot structure. Instead, allow the narrative to flow through the narrator's stream of consciousness, blending past, present, and imagined scenarios. Use phrases like \"stories are graves\" to emphasize the abstract nature of the plot.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Employ metaphorical and philosophical language to explore existential themes. Use the glowing strangers as symbols of hope, memory, or other abstract concepts. For instance, describe the glow as \"a shimmering that perhaps is source or end or both of vast brightness.\"\n  - Challenge conventional storytelling by questioning the nature of stories and time. Incorporate musings such as \"As if time not a story you make up\" to provoke thought and reflection.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Focus on the narrator's internal dialogue and philosophical reflections rather than detailed character interactions. The glowing strangers should remain enigmatic, serving as a trigger for the narrator's introspection.\n  - Describe the setting in vivid, poetic terms, using it as a backdrop for the narrator's musings. For example, depict the sky as \"stretching up and up into bluish, then pale cloudless distance.\"\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Utilize poetic and fragmented language, with a focus on rhythm and repetition. Engage the reader with introspective and contemplative narrative voice, often breaking the fourth wall. Use phrases like \"Pretend to enter, to leave, to begin\" to create a rhythmic flow.\n  - Incorporate rhetorical devices and figures of speech to enhance the philosophical tone. Use descriptive language to evoke a sense of wonder and introspection, such as \"light visible against morning\u2019s brightness, a shimmering that perhaps is source or end or both.\"\n</story_rules>"
