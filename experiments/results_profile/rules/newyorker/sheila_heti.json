    "<thinking>\n- Detailed reasoning and analysis here on how the base_story differs from the ground-truth, organized by the four narrative categories:\n  1. **Plot**: The Ground Truth story presents a more complex and layered plot structure, with a non-linear narrative that includes flashbacks and reflections on past relationships. The protagonist's journey from death to delivering her final declaration is filled with introspection and a deep exploration of her life's meaning. The conflict is internal, revolving around the protagonist's struggle with her sense of self-worth and the need to be witnessed. The resolution is ambiguous, leaving the reader with a sense of unresolved tension and contemplation.\n  \n  2. **Creativity**: The Ground Truth story employs a unique blend of dark humor, irony, and existential reflection. The protagonist's return from the grave is not for revenge or closure but to deliver a declaration that is both profound and absurd. The story reinterprets the prompt in a way that challenges conventional expectations, using the metaphor of a joke to explore themes of life, death, and the need for validation. The narrative is rich with imaginative elements, such as the protagonist's detailed description of her decomposition and the surreal depiction of the afterlife.\n  \n  3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The Ground Truth story delves deeply into the protagonist's character, revealing her insecurities, regrets, and moments of clarity. The setting is vividly described, from the protagonist's lonely death on the road to her surreal experiences in the afterlife. The characters are multidimensional, with the protagonist's relationships and interactions providing insight into her inner world. The setting serves as a reflection of the protagonist's emotional state, enhancing the story's themes and tone.\n  \n  4. **Language Use**: The Ground Truth story uses descriptive and evocative language to create a vivid and immersive narrative. The pacing is deliberate, allowing for moments of introspection and reflection. Dialogue is used sparingly but effectively, revealing character and advancing the plot. The tone is a mix of melancholy, irony, and dark humor, creating a unique and engaging voice. The story employs a first-person narrative, which adds intimacy and immediacy to the protagonist's experiences.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Structure the narrative with a non-linear timeline, incorporating flashbacks and reflections on past relationships to add depth and complexity.\n  - Focus on internal conflict, exploring the protagonist's struggle with self-worth and the need to be witnessed.\n  - Create an ambiguous resolution that leaves the reader with a sense of unresolved tension and contemplation.\n  - Ensure the protagonist's journey from death to delivering the final declaration is filled with introspection and a deep exploration of life's meaning.\n\n- **Creativity**:\n  - Blend dark humor, irony, and existential reflection to create a unique narrative voice.\n  - Reinterpret the prompt in a way that challenges conventional expectations, using metaphors and imaginative elements.\n  - Include detailed and surreal descriptions of the protagonist's decomposition and experiences in the afterlife.\n  - Use the metaphor of a joke to explore themes of life, death, and the need for validation.\n\n- **Development (Character and Setting)**:\n  - Develop the protagonist as a multidimensional character, revealing insecurities, regrets, and moments of clarity.\n  - Describe the setting vividly, using it to reflect the protagonist's emotional state and enhance the story's themes and tone.\n  - Focus on the protagonist's relationships and interactions to provide insight into her inner world.\n  - Create immersive settings that are tied to the story's tone and themes, from the protagonist's lonely death to her surreal afterlife experiences.\n\n- **Language Use**:\n  - Use descriptive and evocative language to create a vivid and immersive narrative.\n  - Maintain a deliberate pacing, allowing for moments of introspection and reflection.\n  - Employ dialogue sparingly but effectively, using it to reveal character and advance the plot.\n  - Adopt a tone that mixes melancholy, irony, and dark humor to create a unique and engaging voice.\n  - Utilize a first-person narrative to add intimacy and immediacy to the protagonist's experiences.\n</story_rules>"
