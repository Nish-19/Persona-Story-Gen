    "<thinking>\n1. **Plot**: The Author Written Story presents a non-linear narrative that explores the protagonist's reflections on life and death. The story begins with the protagonist's death and her subsequent return from the grave, not for revenge or closure, but to deliver a final declaration. The narrative is introspective, focusing on the protagonist's internal conflict and realization about being witnessed in life. The story uses a metaphorical approach, comparing the protagonist's life to a joke, and her death to a punchline. The plot is driven by the protagonist's need to declare that she was witnessed, which is a significant departure from the Base Story's more straightforward narrative of delivering a heartfelt message to a loved one.\n\n2. **Creativity**: The Author Written Story employs a unique blend of dark humor and existential reflection. The protagonist's return from the grave is not for a typical purpose like revenge or closure, but to deliver a declaration about being witnessed. The story creatively uses the metaphor of a joke to explore themes of life, death, and the significance of being seen. This approach contrasts with the Base Story's more conventional and sentimental exploration of unspoken love and closure.\n\n3. **Development (Character and Setting)**: The protagonist in the Author Written Story is developed through her introspective reflections and interactions with her past. The setting is minimal, focusing more on the protagonist's internal world and her journey from the grave to deliver her message. The story delves into the protagonist's relationships and her realization about being witnessed, which adds depth to her character. This contrasts with the Base Story's focus on external settings and relationships, such as the garden and the friendship with Margaret.\n\n4. **Language Use**: The Author Written Story uses a conversational and introspective tone, with a mix of dark humor and philosophical musings. The language is rich with metaphors and rhetorical questions, creating a reflective and engaging narrative. The story employs a first-person perspective, allowing for a deep exploration of the protagonist's thoughts and emotions. This style contrasts with the Base Story's more descriptive and straightforward language, which focuses on external actions and settings.\n</thinking>\n\n<story_rules>\n- **Plot**:\n  - Begin the story with the protagonist's death and her return from the grave.
