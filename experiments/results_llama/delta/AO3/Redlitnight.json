        "writing_prompt": "Every morning, Will Solace wakes up next to Nico di Angelo, the love of his life, and every morning begins with laughter, kisses, and the occasional battle to get out of bed\u2014until one day, Nico suggests something that changes their routine forever.",
        "story": "The sunlight filtering through the curtains danced across Nico's face, illuminating the wisps of sleep-tousled hair that framed his features. Will's fingers automatically reached out to brush a strand behind his ear, earning a sleepy smile from Nico. \"Good morning,\" Nico murmured, his voice husky from sleep.\n\nWill's lips curled into a grin as he leaned in to kiss Nico's forehead. \"Good morning,\" he replied, his voice filled with affection. \"You look adorable when you're half-asleep.\"\n\nNico's eyes fluttered open, and he gave Will a mock-offended look. \"I do not look adorable,\" he protested, his voice growing stronger with each word. \"I look...regal.\"\n\nWill chuckled, nuzzling Nico's cheek. \"Regal, huh? In your sleep, at least.\"\n\nThe banter was a familiar morning ritual, one that Will cherished deeply. He loved waking up next to Nico, feeling the warmth of his body and the gentle rise and fall of his chest as he breathed.\n\nBut on this particular morning, Nico's tone was different. His voice was a little softer, a little more serious, as he spoke up. \"Hey, Will? I was thinking...about our mornings.\"\n\nWill's fingers stilled on Nico's hair, his brow furrowing in curiosity. \"What about them?\"\n\nNico's eyes locked onto his, a spark of excitement igniting within their depths. \"I was thinking we could start doing something new. You know, something to mix things up a bit.\"\n\nWill's confusion deepened. Nico loved their morning routine, just as much as he did. What could possibly be wrong with it? But before he could ask, Nico continued, his words tumbling out in a rush.\n\n\"We could try...fishing. Yeah, that's it. We could go fishing. I've always wanted to try it, and I bet it would be really fun. Just us, out on the water, with nothing but the sun and the fish to worry about.\"\n\nWill's face split into a wide grin, his heart racing with excitement. \"Fishing? You want to go fishing with me?\"\n\nNico's face lit up, his eyes shining with enthusiasm. \"Yeah! I've always wanted to try it, and I thought it would be a great way for us to spend some quality time together. Just the two of us, doing something new and fun.\"\n\nThe thought of it sent a thrill through Will's veins. He loved the idea of exploring new experiences with Nico, of creating memories that would last a lifetime.\n\n\"Okay,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"Let's do it.\"\n\nNico's face lit up, and he threw his arms around Will's neck, pulling him into a fierce kiss. \"Yes!\" he exclaimed, his voice muffled against Will's lips. \"Let's go fishing!\"\n\nAs they broke apart for air, Will couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation. Their mornings would never be the same again, and he couldn't wait to see what other adventures lay ahead."

        "writing_prompt": "Your partner insists you can look through their phone anytime, but when you do, you discover a collection of candid photos of yourself\u2014each one capturing a moment you didn\u2019t even realize was special.",
        "story": "I walked into the kitchen, yawning, and plopped down on a stool beside Will, who was making breakfast. He looked up and smiled, \"Hey, sleepyhead. You can check my phone if you want, I don't have any secrets.\"\n\nI raised an eyebrow, \"You're sure? I know you're a demigod and all, but I still don't trust you with my secrets.\"\n\nWill chuckled and handed me his phone, \"I swear, I don't have any secrets. Go ahead, browse through it. I want to show you something.\"\n\nI took the phone and started scrolling through his photos, but there wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Just usual demigod stuff \u2013 training sessions, battles with monsters, and the occasional selfie with his friends. I was about to put the phone back when I stumbled upon a folder labeled \" Memories\". I opened it, and my heart skipped a beat.\n\nThe first photo was of me, smiling, with a guitar in my hand, in the living room. I had no recollection of taking a photo, but Will's caption read: \"When you finally learned to play 'The Lament of Achilles'\". I felt a surge of pride and happiness, remembering the countless hours I had spent practicing that song for him.\n\nThe next photo was of us, sitting on the couch, laughing and holding hands, during a movie night. I had no idea it was taken, but Will's caption said: \"When you made me laugh so hard I snorted coffee out my nose\". I felt a warmth spread through my chest as I remembered that night.\n\nAs I continued to scroll through the photos, I discovered more moments I had forgotten \u2013 like the time we went on a picnic in the park and I accidentally dropped my sandwich, or the time we had a silly argument over who was the better cook, and I ended up making a mess in the kitchen.\n\nEach photo was a snapshot of a moment, frozen in time, like sunlight caught in a jar. I felt like I was seeing myself through Will's eyes, and it was beautiful. I realized that he had been capturing these moments, not just because they were special to him, but because they were special to me.\n\nI looked up at Will, who was watching me with a smile, \"You've been taking these photos, haven't you?\"\n\nHe nodded, \"Yeah, I wanted to capture our memories, not just the big moments, but the little ones too.\"\n\nI felt a lump form in my throat as I looked at the photos again. I realized that Will had been paying attention to me, to us, in a way that I hadn't even noticed. He had been seeing the beauty in our everyday moments, and I was grateful for that.\n\nI looked up at Will, and he took my hand, \"I love you, Nico. You're my favorite person to share these moments with.\"\n\nI smiled, feeling a sense of gratitude and love for this demigod who had captured my heart and my memories. \"I love you too, Will. And I'm glad you're taking these photos, because they're a reminder of just how special we are.\""

        "story": "Nico rubbed his eyes, trying to shake off the exhaustion from a long day at Camp Half-Blood. Will, his husband, had other plans for him. \"Come on, it'll be fun! Just one little video,\" Will said, a mischievous glint in his eye as he pulled out a makeup bag from behind the couch.\n\nNico raised an eyebrow. \"A video? What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"A YouTube video, silly,\" Will replied, unzipping the bag to reveal a rainbow explosion of colors and brushes. \"I've been wanting to try out some new makeup looks, and I thought you'd be the perfect model.\"\n\nNico's reluctance was evident. \"I don't know, Will. I'm not exactly comfortable with this kind of thing.\"\n\nWill's grin only grew wider. \"Come on, it'll be fun! I promise I won't make you look like a total monster.\"\n\nNico hesitated, but Will's persuasive charm eventually won him over. He sat down in front of the cluttered vanity, which was overflowing with brushes, palettes, and lip glosses. Will began applying a thick layer of foundation, followed by a swirl of bright pink blush and a sprinkle of glitter.\n\nAs the transformation progressed, Nico's reactions shifted from skepticism to surprise. \"What are you doing?\" he asked, his eyes wide as Will applied a generous amount of blue eyeshadow.\n\n\"I'm creating a masterpiece of glitter and glam,\" Will replied, his hands moving with a flourish as he blended the colors. \"And you're going to be the star of the show.\"\n\nThe final result was... unexpected. Nico stared at his reflection in the mirror, his eyes wide with shock. He looked like a disco ball, complete with a glittering silver coat and a pair of oversized, sparkly sunglasses.\n\nNico's reaction was priceless. \"I look like a disco ball!\" he exclaimed, his voice trembling with laughter.\n\nWill beamed with pride. \"Told you it would be fun! Now, let's get into position for the camera.\"\n\nNico shook his head, still chuckling. \"This is insane.\"\n\nWill handed him a microphone, and Nico began to sing a ridiculous song about the joys of glitter and makeup. Will, meanwhile, danced around him, his own makeup-glazed smile radiating joy.\n\nAs they finished the video, Nico couldn't help but laugh. \"Okay, maybe this wasn't such a bad idea after all.\"\n\nWill grinned, giving him a playful kiss on the cheek. \"Told you it would be fun! Now, let's go post this online and see how many likes we get.\"\n\nNico shook his head, still grinning. \"You're going to get us killed.\"\n\nWill winked. \"Worth it.\""

        "writing_prompt": "While navigating the Labyrinth, Nico encounters a strange, freckled boy claiming to be from the future\u2014and his future boyfriend.",
        "story": "The walls seemed to shift and breathe, casting shadows that danced like phantoms as I navigated the Labyrinth's twisted paths. I'd been in this maze for what felt like an eternity, the air thick with the scent of ancient stone and magic. My heart pounded in my chest, and I could feel the weight of my quest bearing down on me. I was on a mission to find the exit, but the Labyrinth had other plans.\n\nAs I turned a corner, a figure emerged from the shadows. He was a boy, no more than a year or two older than me, with a mop of messy brown hair and a smattering of freckles across his cheeks. His eyes sparkled with an intensity that made me take a step back, my hand instinctively reaching for Riptide.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I demanded, trying to keep my voice steady.\n\nThe boy grinned, his eyes crinkling at the corners. \"I know this sounds crazy, but I'm from the future\u2014and I'm your boyfriend.\"\n\nI raised an eyebrow, incredulity washing over me. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nThe boy chuckled, his eyes glinting with amusement. \"I know it's a lot to take in, but just hear me out. I'm from a time when the Labyrinth is just a myth, a cautionary tale told to kids in the demigod camps. But I've traveled back in time to find you, Nico.\"\n\nI shook my head, trying to clear the cobwebs. \"This is ridiculous. You can't just claim to be from the future and expect me to believe you.\"\n\nThe boy shrugged, his freckles seeming to dance across his cheeks. \"I know it's a lot to swallow, but just trust me for a minute. I know things about you, Nico. I know your favorite snack is chocolate chip cookies, and that you're terrified of spiders. I know you'll fall in love with a demigod named Will Solace, and that you'll spend the rest of your life fighting monsters and making him laugh.\"\n\nI felt a shiver run down my spine as he spoke, his words striking a chord deep within me. Could it be true? Was this boy from the future, or was he just some crazy kid with a wild imagination?\n\nAs I stood there, frozen in indecision, the boy took a step closer to me. \"I know it's a lot to take in, but I'm here to tell you that your future is full of possibility. You'll face challenges and dangers, but you'll also find love and friendship. And I'll be right by your side, every step of the way.\"\n\nI felt a lump form in my throat as I looked at the boy, his eyes shining with a sincerity that I couldn't deny. Maybe the future wasn't as set in stone as I thought. Maybe there were possibilities out there that I couldn't even imagine.\n\nThe boy's words hung in the air like a challenge, and I felt my heart pounding in my chest. I didn't know what to believe, or what to do. But as I looked at the boy, I knew that I had to take a chance.\n\n\"Okay,\" I said finally, my voice barely above a whisper. \"I'll listen.\"\n\nThe boy's face lit up with a radiant smile, and he took another step closer to me. \"That's all I can ask for, Nico. Now, let's get out of this maze and see what the future holds.\"\n\nAs we walked together, the Labyrinth's paths unfolding before us like a twisted tapestry, I felt a sense of excitement and trepidation building inside me. What lay ahead? Would we find the exit, or would we get lost forever in the Labyrinth's depths? I didn't know, but I was ready to find out.\n\nThe boy's hand brushed against mine, sending a spark of electricity through my body. I glanced at him, and our eyes met in a flash of understanding. We were in this together, no matter what the future held.\n\nAs we walked, the Labyrinth's secrets whispered secrets in my ear, and I listened with a sense of wonder and awe. Maybe the future wasn't as set in stone as I thought. Maybe it was full of possibilities, waiting to be explored. And with the boy by my side, I was ready to take the leap and see where it would lead."

        "writing_prompt": "After surviving the horrors of Tartarus, Will and Nico have developed quiet rituals to soothe their lingering fears. One sleepless night, they find themselves dancing in the kitchen, holding each other close as the weight of their shared past fades into the rhythm of the present.",
        "story": "The kitchen was bathed in the soft glow of the moonlight streaming through the window. The hum of the refrigerator provided a gentle counterpoint to the silence that had settled over the room. Will stood by the counter, his eyes fixed on Nico, who was staring at the ceiling with a mix of tension and unease etched on his face.\n\nIt was a familiar sight \u2013 one that Will had grown accustomed to over the years. Nico's mind often wandered back to the horrors of Tartarus, the darkness that lingered within him like an open wound. Will's own memories still haunted him, but he knew that Nico's were far more painful.\n\nWithout a word, Will walked over to Nico and gently took his hand, leading him into the kitchen. The music of a soft melody began to drift through the air, a gentle lullaby that seemed to match the rhythm of their hearts. Will's eyes never left Nico's as he pulled him close, their bodies swaying to the beat of the music.\n\nThe kitchen became a sanctuary, a space where the past receded and the present became the only reality. The music wove a tapestry of comfort around them, a reminder that they were not alone in their struggles. Will's hand wrapped around Nico's waist, holding him close as they danced, their bodies moving in perfect sync.\n\nAs they swayed to the music, Will's gaze drifted to the window, where the moonlight cast a silver glow over the scene. The world outside seemed to fade away, leaving only the two of them, lost in the rhythm of the present. Nico's eyes, once clouded with fear, now shone with a quiet calm, his face relaxed into a gentle smile.\n\nTheir dance was a silent conversation, each step speaking of resilience and love. Will's hand tightened around Nico's waist, holding him close as the music swelled to a crescendo. Nico's arms wrapped around Will's neck, pulling him closer, their faces inches apart.\n\nFor a moment, the world stopped. The music, the kitchen, the past \u2013 everything receded, leaving only the two of them, suspended in a moment of pure connection. Will's eyes locked onto Nico's, his heart beating in time with the music. Nico's gaze never wavered, his eyes shining with a deep affection.\n\nAs the music faded into the distance, Will's lips brushed against Nico's, a soft, gentle kiss that spoke of comfort and reassurance. Nico's arms tightened around him, holding him close, their bodies swaying to the rhythm of their own heartbeat. The weight of their shared past seemed to fade into the background, replaced by the warmth of their love, the comfort of their presence.\n\nIn this moment, they were not the survivors of Tartarus; they were not the sons of Hades and Hermes. They were simply two men, lost in the rhythm of the present, their love a beacon of hope in the darkness. As the music faded into silence, Will and Nico stood there, holding each other close, their hearts beating as one."
