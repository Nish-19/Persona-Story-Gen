        "story": "Will groaned dramatically, flopping back onto the pillows like a defeated hero. Nico laughed, poking him in the ribs with a mischievous grin. \"Morning zombie,\" he teased, as he always did.\n\nWill's eyes fluttered open, his gaze locking onto Nico's. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes, the morning light streaming through the curtains casting an intimate glow over their cozy bed. \"Shut up,\" Will muttered, snuggling deeper into the blankets. Nico chuckled, wrapping a warm arm around Will's waist.\n\nThey spent a blissful moment in comfortable silence, the only sound the gentle hum of the coffee maker in the kitchen. Will's stomach growled, reminding him it was time to start their morning ritual. He tossed off the covers and swung his legs over the side of the bed, planting his feet firmly on the ground. Nico sat up beside him, his messy hair sticking up in every direction.\n\nAs they shuffled towards the kitchen, Will snagged Nico's favorite mug from the cabinet and handed it to him with a smile. Nico's eyes sparkled as he took a sip of the steaming coffee, his face scrunched up in appreciation. Will chuckled, pouring himself a cup and joining Nico at the small table by the window.\n\nTheir morning routine was a sacred ritual, a beautiful dance of laughter and affection. They'd cuddle, tease, and bicker their way through the morning, always ending with a tender kiss and a promise to face the day together.\n\nBut today, something was different.\n\nNico set his cup down, his eyes sparkling with mischief. \"We need to change our morning routine,\" he announced, a sly grin spreading across his face.\n\nWill raised an eyebrow, his skepticism evident. \"Oh yeah? What did you have in mind?\"\n\nNico leaned in, his voice conspiratorial. \"We should start a morning dance-off to get out of bed.\"\n\nWill's jaw dropped, his mind reeling in horror. \"You want me to dance before coffee? Are you trying to kill me?\" He laughed, trying to keep a straight face, but Nico's infectious enthusiasm was already getting the better of him.\n\nNico's face lit up, his eyes shining with excitement. \"Think about it, Will! We can start with some crazy dance challenge, and then move on to the morning routine. It'll be fun, I promise!\"\n\nWill's internal monologue was a jumbled mess of \"This is madness,\" followed by \"But maybe madness is exactly what we need.\" He looked at Nico, really looked at him, and saw the genuine excitement in his eyes. He couldn't help but be swept up in the moment.\n\n\"Okay, fine,\" Will said, a grin spreading across his face. \"But if I die from embarrassment, it's on you.\"\n\nNico whooped, leaping out of his seat and dancing over to Will. \"It's going to be epic!\" he exclaimed, wrapping Will in a tight hug.\n\nAs they hugged, Will realized that maybe, just maybe, this was exactly what they needed. A little bit of chaos, a lot of laughter, and a whole lot of love. He squeezed Nico tightly, feeling his heart swell with excitement.\n\nTheir morning dance-off was about to become the most epic part of their day, and Will couldn't wait to see what other surprises Nico had in store for him."

        "story": "Will was lounging on the couch, his phone still on the coffee table from when he'd left it there hours ago. Nico walked in, his eyes scanning the room before landing on the phone. He picked it up, his thumb hovering over the lock screen as he raised an eyebrow at Will, who was engrossed in his book.\n\n\"You know, I can look through your phone anytime,\" he said with a grin, quoting Will's often-repeated phrase. Will looked up, a hint of a smile on his lips.\n\n\"That's what I've been telling you,\" he said, returning to his book.\n\nNico chuckled and swiped through the phone, his eyes scanning the various apps and messages until he landed on the camera roll. His heart skipped a beat as he started scrolling through the photos. At first, he thought they were just random shots, but as he delved deeper, he realized they were all of him.\n\nHe couldn't help but laugh as he saw a photo of himself making a silly face at the camera, his eyes scrunched up in concentration. The next one was of him reading a book, his brow furrowed in thought. Nico's heart swelled as he saw the photo of him laughing with Will, the sun setting behind them casting a warm glow over the scene.\n\nAs he continued to scroll, the photos became more and more intimate. There was one of him yawning, his mouth open wide, and another of him sipping coffee, a look of pure joy on his face. Nico's eyes welled up with tears as he saw a photo of him sleeping, Will's hand gently brushing a strand of hair from his face.\n\nHe felt like he was seeing himself through Will's eyes for the first time, and it was a beautiful thing. He felt seen, heard, and understood in a way he never thought possible.\n\nWill finally put down his book, noticing Nico's tears. \"Hey, what's wrong?\" he asked, concern etched on his face.\n\nNico handed him the phone, his thumb pointing to the various photos. Will's eyes widened as he scrolled through them, a soft smile spreading across his face.\n\n\"I knew you'd like them,\" he said, his voice full of emotion.\n\nNico shook his head, his eyes still wet. \"I don't just like them, I love them. They're...they're everything I've ever wanted to see in a relationship.\"\n\nWill set the phone down and pulled Nico into a tight hug. \"You're everything to me, Nico,\" he whispered into his ear. \"I love capturing moments like these because they remind me of how lucky I am to have you.\"\n\nAs they hugged, Nico felt his heart overflow with love and gratitude. He knew he'd never forget this moment, this feeling of being seen and loved by the person he cared about most.\n\n\"You're a secret paparazzo, you know that?\" Nico teased, trying to lighten the mood.\n\nWill chuckled, his eyes sparkling with amusement. \"Guilty as charged. But I promise, it's only because I love you so much.\"\n\nNico smiled, feeling his heart soar. \"I love you too, Will.\"\n\nAs they pulled back, Will gently brushed a strand of hair from Nico's face, a soft smile on his lips. \"I know, my love. I can see it in your eyes.\""

        "writing_prompt": "A mischievous makeup artist convinces their reluctant partner to star in a video, only to reveal a hilariously unexpected transformation\u2014what happens next?",
        "story": "Will groaned, pretending to be asleep, as Nico bounced onto the bed, guitar in hand. \"Come on, Will, it'll be fun! You can be my canvas, and I'll make you a masterpiece\u2014or at least a meme.\" Nico's eyes sparkled with mischief as he strummed a few chords on his guitar, and Will couldn't help but chuckle.\n\n\"I'm not getting up, Nico. I'm not doing a video with you. Besides, I look terrible in makeup.\" Will pulled the blankets up to his chin, trying to appear as nonchalant as possible.\n\nNico pouted, but his eyes twinkled with amusement. \"Oh, come on! It'll be a blast! We can do a dramatic reading of the Iliad, or a parody of the Odyssey. I'll even let you be the hero for once.\"\n\nWill raised an eyebrow. \"You know I'm not a morning person, and I'm definitely not a video star.\"\n\nNico's grin grew wider. \"That's exactly why you need to do this. You're adorable when you're grumpy. And I promise, it'll be quick. Just a few minutes, and we'll be done.\"\n\nWill sighed, but Nico's enthusiasm was infectious. He threw off the blankets and swung his legs over the side of the bed. \"Fine, but if I end up looking like a clown, I'm blaming you.\"\n\nNico whooped in triumph and handed Will a small makeup bag. \"Don't worry, I have a plan. Trust me.\"\n\nAs Nico began applying makeup to Will's face, Will's initial reluctance gave way to amusement. The makeup artist's hands moved with lightning speed, transforming Will's features into a riot of colors, each shade more outrageous than the last. Shimmering under the lights, Will's face became a kaleidoscope of hues, a masterpiece of chaos and color.\n\nWhen Nico finally stepped back to admire his handiwork, Will's eyes widened in horror. He looked...like a walking art exhibit. A glittering, rainbow-colored, disco-ball had a baby with a clown. Will's mouth dropped open as Nico burst out laughing.\n\n\"Okay, okay, I admit it. You got me. But only because you look so happy,\" Will said, his initial shock giving way to amusement.\n\nNico grinned, snapping a selfie with Will. \"This is going viral faster than a cat video on TikTok! I can already see the hashtags: #MakeupGoals #CampusCutie #RainbowRainmaker\"\n\nAs Will adjusted his new look in the mirror, a resigned smile spreading across his face, Nico wrapped his arms around him. \"I knew you'd see it my way. You're a natural-born star, Will.\"\n\nWill rolled his eyes good-naturedly, but a small part of him was pleased with the unexpected transformation. Maybe, just maybe, being a human rainbow wasn't so bad after all."

        "writing_prompt": "While navigating the Labyrinth, Nico encounters a strange, freckled boy claiming to be from the future\u2014and his future boyfriend.",
        "story": "Nico navigated the Labyrinth's twists with ease, his eyes scanning the walls for any signs of danger. He was a demigod, after all, and he knew these paths like the back of his hand. As he turned a corner, a figure caught his eye. A freckled boy with a mop of messy brown hair and an awkward grin stood frozen, staring at Nico with wide eyes.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" Nico asked, his hand instinctively reaching for Riptide.\n\nThe boy blinked rapidly, his eyes darting around the Labyrinth as if searching for an escape route. \"Uh, hi. Yeah, I think I'm here to... uh... talk to you.\"\n\nNico raised an eyebrow. \"Me?\"\n\nThe boy nodded enthusiastically. \"Yeah, you. Nico di Angelo. I've, uh, heard a lot about you.\"\n\nNico's curiosity was piqued. \"What do you want to talk about?\"\n\nThe boy took a deep breath, his face set in determination. \"I'm from... um... the future. And you're... my boyfriend.\"\n\nNico's eyes widened in shock. \"What?\"\n\nThe boy nodded again, this time with a goofy grin. \"I promise I'm not here to mess up your timeline, just your heart. Although, if I'm being honest, I'm kind of messing with the timeline too.\"\n\nNico's mind reeled. A future boyfriend? What even was that? He took a step back, his eyes fixed on the boy's freckled face. \"You're... you're telling me that we've met before, in the future?\"\n\nThe boy nodded once more, his grin growing wider. \"Yeah, we've had some amazing adventures together. And I have to say, I'm really glad I'm here right now. You're even more handsome than I remembered.\"\n\nNico's face heated up as he tried to process the boy's words. Was this real? Was he really destined to fall for this freckled time traveler? He thought back to all the times he'd heard about the Labyrinth's weirdness, but never in a million years had he thought it would involve a future boyfriend.\n\nAs they stood there, the Labyrinth's walls shimmered with an eerie glow, casting long shadows that danced with every flicker of torchlight. Nico's mind was a whirlwind of \"what ifs\" and \"why nots.\" Why me? Why now? Why him?\n\nThe boy, sensing Nico's unease, took a step forward. \"Hey, it's okay. I know this is a lot to take in. But I want you to know that I'm here for you, no matter what. And I promise, our timeline is going to be amazing.\"\n\nNico raised an eyebrow, his skepticism evident. \"You promise?\"\n\nThe boy nodded, a mischievous glint in his eye. \"Yeah, I promise. Now, about our first date... have you heard of the latest pop culture phenomenon, 'Galactic Gaming'?\"\n\nNico's eyes widened in confusion. \"Uh, no. What's that?\"\n\nThe boy grinned. \"You'll love it. Trust me.\"\n\nAs they continued to talk, Nico found himself drawn to the boy's infectious enthusiasm and charming smile. Maybe, just maybe, this future boyfriend thing was going to be more interesting than he thought.\n\n\"Hey, freckled boy,\" Nico said, a hint of a smile on his face. \"You know what? I think I'm starting to believe you.\"\n\nThe boy's face lit up with a radiant smile. \"I knew you'd see things my way, Nico. And don't worry, I'll make sure to explain all the pop culture references. It'll be a blast.\"\n\nAs they continued on their journey through the Labyrinth, Nico couldn't help but feel a spark of excitement. Who knew what the future held, but with this freckled boy by his side, he was ready to find out."

        "writing_prompt": "After surviving the horrors of Tartarus, Will and Nico have developed quiet rituals to soothe their lingering fears. One sleepless night, they find themselves dancing in the kitchen, holding each other close as the weight of their shared past fades into the rhythm of the present.",
        "story": "The soft glow of the kitchen lights casting gentle shadows on the walls. It was a peaceful scene, one that Nico would've described as serene if he weren't clutching his tea mug so tightly his knuckles were white. Will, on the other hand, was swaying to the beat of the music, a gentle melody that wrapped around them like a comforting embrace. Nico's eyes narrowed, a hint of a smile playing on his lips as he watched his partner dance.\n\n\"Hey, what's the plan here?\" Nico asked, his voice low and husky, the words tumbling out of him as he set his mug on the counter. Will spun around, a mischievous glint in his eye, and grabbed Nico's hand, pulling him into the dance.\n\nNico stumbled, his feet tangling with Will's as they moved to the music. \"Sorry, sorry,\" Will said, laughing, his eyes sparkling with mirth. Nico's laughter bubbled up, a rare sound that filled the kitchen with warmth. They danced, their bodies swaying to the rhythm, their hands clasped together.\n\nWill stepped on Nico's toes, and he yelped in mock pain. \"Seriously, Will? You're going to step on my toes and then expect me to forgive you?\" Nico teased, his voice laced with humor.\n\nWill grinned, his eyes crinkling at the corners. \"Hey, I'm just trying to bring out the beast in you, Nico. You know, unleash your inner demigod warrior.\" Nico rolled his eyes, chuckling, and Will added, \"Besides, I'm not that bad. I'm more of a... gentle giant.\"\n\nNico raised an eyebrow. \"Gentle giant? You're the one who once got into a fight with a Cyclops in a bar.\"\n\nWill shrugged, his grin never wavering. \"Hey, that was a defensive move. I was just trying to protect you.\" Nico's eyes softened, and he leaned in, his lips brushing against Will's ear. \"You're a good protector, Will. I'm lucky to have you.\"\n\nAs they danced, the music swirling around them, Nico's thoughts drifted back to the horrors of Tartarus. The darkness, the pain, the endless screaming. He pushed the memories away, focusing on the warmth of Will's hand in his, the beat of the music, and the gentle laughter that filled the kitchen.\n\nHe held onto Will, feeling the weight of their past slip away with each step, each turn, each shared breath. They were safe now, in this moment, in this kitchen, surrounded by the soft glow of the lights and the gentle melody of the music.\n\nAs the song ended, Nico and Will slowed to a stop, their chests heaving with laughter. Nico's eyes met Will's, and he smiled, the tension in his body easing. They were okay, they were safe, and they were together.\n\nWill leaned in, his lips brushing against Nico's. \"Hey, you know what? I think we make a pretty good team, even when we're dancing like idiots.\"\n\nNico's heart swelled, and he wrapped his arms around Will, holding him close. \"I think you might be right, Will. We make a pretty great team, in every way.\""
