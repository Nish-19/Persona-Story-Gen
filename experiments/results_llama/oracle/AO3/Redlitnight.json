        "story": "The best feeling in the world was waking up next to Nico Di Angelo. Will's eyes fluttered open to find his partner sprawled across the bed, his dark hair mussed and his face scrunched up in a sleep-tousled expression. Will couldn't help but smile as he reached out to brush a strand of hair behind Nico's ear.\n\nNico's eyes snapped open, and he smiled lazily at Will, his eyes crinkling at the corners. \"Good morning,\" he whispered, his voice husky with sleep.\n\nWill leaned in to kiss him, their lips meeting in a soft, gentle touch. \"Good morning,\" he replied, smiling against Nico's lips.\n\nTheir cat, Connie \u2013 affectionately known as Constable \u2013 poked her head into the room, meowing loudly to be let out. Nico laughed and sat up, swinging his legs over the side of the bed. \"I'll get her, my love,\" he said, standing up and padding across the room to let Connie out.\n\nWill watched him, his heart full of love for this man who made every day brighter just by being in it. He threw off the covers and stood up, stretching his arms over his head. \"I'll make breakfast,\" he said, padding across the room to the kitchen.\n\nNico followed him, his hair still rumpled and his eyes sleepy. \"I love you even more for the breakfast in bed,\" he said, smiling up at Will as he handed him a cup of coffee.\n\nWill smiled back, taking a sip of the hot liquid. \"I love you too,\" he said, smiling at Nico's lazy, sleepy expression.\n\nAs they ate breakfast, the conversation flowed easily, punctuated by laughter and playful teasing. Nico made a joke about Will's cooking, and Will retaliated by teasing Nico about his fashion sense. It was a routine they'd fallen into over the years, and one that Will cherished deeply.\n\nBut today, as they were finishing up breakfast, Nico said something that caught Will off guard. \"Will, can we do something different today?\" he asked, his eyes sparkling with a mischievous glint.\n\nWill raised an eyebrow, intrigued. \"What did you have in mind?\" he asked, setting his cup down.\n\nNico's smile grew wider. \"I was thinking we could take a day trip to the beach,\" he said, his eyes shining with excitement. \"Just the two of us, no distractions. We can pack a picnic and spend the day soaking up the sun.\"\n\nWill's heart skipped a beat as he processed Nico's words. A day trip to the beach, just the two of them? It sounded perfect. \"I'd love that,\" he said, smiling up at Nico.\n\nNico's face lit up with a radiant smile, and Will felt his heart swell with love for this man who made every day an adventure. \"Me too,\" Nico said, leaning in to kiss Will softly on the lips.\n\nAs they made plans for their day trip, Will couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation. What would the day bring? He knew one thing for sure \u2013 as long as he was with Nico, every day would be an adventure worth taking."

        "writing_prompt": "Your partner insists you can look through their phone anytime, but when you do, you discover a collection of candid photos of yourself\u2014each one capturing a moment you didn\u2019t even realize was special.",
        "story": "Nico had always teased Will about his phone addiction. \"You check your phone more often than the Oracle checks the Oracle's bones,\" he'd say with a chuckle. But when Will insisted that Nico could look through his phone anytime, he didn't think much of it. \"You can check my phone,\" Will said with a shrug, \"I've got nothing to hide.\"\n\nNico humored him, scrolling through Will's phone as they sat on the couch together. The first few screens were just the usual stuff: messages from Annabeth, emails from the camp, and a few memes that made Nico groan. But as he delved deeper, he stumbled upon a folder labeled \"Nico.\" His heart skipped a beat as he opened it.\n\nInside, he found a collection of candid photos of himself. There was one of him yawning on the couch, another of him making a silly face during a game of Go Fish, and yet another of him sleeping with a look of pure contentment on his face. Nico's eyes widened as he scrolled through the photos, feeling a warmth spread through his chest.\n\nWill had been capturing moments of Nico's life without him even realizing it. There was one of him reading a book on the beach, another of him laughing with Tyson, and a few of him just sitting in silence, looking peaceful. Nico felt a lump form in his throat as he realized how much Will must have been paying attention.\n\nHe looked up to see Will watching him with a gentle smile. \"I wanted to remember all the moments that made me fall in love with you,\" Will said, his voice barely above a whisper. Nico's eyes welled up with tears as he looked back at the photos.\n\nHe saw himself in a way he never had before. He saw the way Will saw him \u2013 as a complex, beautiful person worthy of love and attention. Nico felt a surge of emotions, and before he knew it, he was in Will's arms, tears streaming down his face.\n\nWill held him close, whispering words of comfort and love into his ear. \"You're so precious to me, Nico,\" he said. \"I want to capture every moment of our lives together, every laugh, every tear, every whisper. I want to remember it all.\"\n\nAs they sat there, wrapped in each other's arms, Nico felt a deep sense of connection and understanding. He knew that Will wasn't just his partner \u2013 he was his confidant, his best friend, and his soulmate. And in that moment, he knew that their relationship was worth fighting for, worth cherishing, and worth remembering.\n\nThe photos on Will's phone became a symbol of their love, a reminder of the little moments that made their relationship special. Nico continued to scroll through them, feeling a sense of gratitude and love for the person who had captured his heart in so many ways."

        "writing_prompt": "A mischievous makeup artist convinces their reluctant partner to star in a video, only to reveal a hilariously unexpected transformation\u2014what happens next?",
        "story": "Hello, my little demigods! Today is a very special day because I finally persuaded my boyfriend, Will, to be in a video with me. Well, \"persuaded\" might be an understatement \u2013 let's just say I employed a combination of puppy dog eyes, kisses, and a hint of magical persuasion to get him to agree. Now, I know what you're thinking: what could possibly go wrong with a video featuring the demigod son of Hermes and his partner, a lowly mortal with a penchant for makeup? \n\nAs I began to apply Will's makeup, he squirmed in his seat, looking like a reluctant cat in a bathtub. I chuckled and teased him, \"Oh, come on, tesoro! Just one little video for me? I promise I won't make you wear a toga and dance the Macarena.\" Will rolled his eyes good-naturedly, and I could see the tension in his shoulders ease slightly.\n\nI started with a light dusting of powder, working my way up to a bold lip color that made Will's eyes widen in surprise. \"You know I'm only doing this because I love you, right?\" he asked, his voice tinged with a hint of amusement. I grinned mischievously and replied, \"Of course, my love! And don't worry, I'll make sure to include all the essential demigod poses \u2013 the 'I'm-a-teenage-hero' scowl and the 'I-just-ate-a- whole-pizza-by-myself' face.\"\n\nAs I finished up Will's makeup, I handed him a mirror to admire my handiwork. His eyes widened in shock, and he let out a startled yelp. I turned to see what had caused the commotion and that's when I saw it: Will was now a Care Bear.\n\nNot just any Care Bear, mind you \u2013 but Tenderheart Bear, complete with a pink and white striped suit and a heart-shaped belly. I burst out laughing at the sight, and Will looked at me with a mixture of embarrassment and amusement.\n\n\"What...what have you done to me?\" he asked, his voice shaking with laughter. I grinned, still chuckling, and replied, \"I told you I was a master of makeup magic, didn't I?\"\n\nAs we filmed the video, Will's Care Bear persona shone through, and I couldn't help but laugh at his antics. We posed in front of a rainbow-colored backdrop, with Will sporting a ridiculously oversized Care Bear grin. At one point, he even broke into a choreographed dance routine, complete with jazz hands and a Care Bear-themed spin move.\n\nAs we wrapped up filming, I leaned over and kissed Will's cheek, still grinning from ear to ear. \"You know, I think this might just be my favorite video ever,\" I said, my voice filled with excitement. Will looked at me, his Care Bear eyes shining with love and affection, and replied, \"I'm glad you're happy, tesoro. But next time, can we just stick to a simple selfie?\" I winked at him and replied, \"Where's the fun in that, my love?\""

        "story": "A loud thud made Nico jolt awake. He sat up, rubbing his eyes to clear the haze. Where was he? The last thing he remembered was navigating the Labyrinth with Will, trying to find a way out. The maze seemed endless, and they'd been walking for what felt like hours.\n\nAs he looked around, a boy with messy brown hair and a scattering of freckles on his cheeks sat up from where he'd been lying on the ground. He looked around just as lost as Nico.\n\n\"Hey,\" the boy said, scrambling to his feet. \"You okay? I'm so sorry, I think I tripped over my own feet.\"\n\nNico's eyes narrowed. \"Who are you?\"\n\nThe boy held out a hand, a sheepish grin spreading across his face. \"I'm Will. Nice to meet you.\"\n\nNico raised an eyebrow. \"Will?\"\n\n\"Yeah, my name's Will. And you are...?\"\n\nNico hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. \"Nico.\"\n\nWill nodded enthusiastically. \"Cool name. I'm from... um... a different time. A future time.\"\n\nNico's eyes widened. \"What?\"\n\nWill nodded again, his grin growing wider. \"Yeah, I'm from the future. And you, Nico, are my boyfriend.\"\n\nNico's jaw dropped. \"What? No way.\"\n\nWill chuckled. \"I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I'm from a time when... well, when we've made a lot of progress. We've figured out a lot of things, and we've got some pretty cool technology. And one of the things we've figured out is how to navigate the Labyrinth.\"\n\nNico's mind reeled. \"You're saying you're from the future, and we're... we're in the Labyrinth together?\"\n\nWill nodded, his grin unwavering. \"That's right. And I'm your boyfriend, Nico. I know it's a lot to take in, but trust me, it's true.\"\n\nNico's skepticism was starting to wear off, replaced by a growing sense of confusion. \"How did you...?\"\n\nWill shrugged. \"Time travel, I guess. I'm not really sure how it works. But I do know that I'm stuck here with you, at least for now.\"\n\nNico's eyes narrowed. \"And what makes you think we're boyfriends?\"\n\nWill's grin faltered for a moment before he recovered. \"Well, I've seen pictures of you, and I've read about you. And I have to say, I'm really into you, Nico. You're brave, and clever, and you've got a great sense of humor.\"\n\nNico's heart skipped a beat. No one had ever said anything like that to him before. He felt a flutter in his chest, and his mind began to spin with possibilities.\n\nAs they continued to talk, Nico found himself growing more and more drawn to this strange, freckled boy from the future. He couldn't believe what Will was saying, but at the same time, he couldn't deny the way he felt.\n\nAs the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the Labyrinth, Nico realized that he had a decision to make. He could either trust this strange boy from the future, or he could turn his back on him.\n\nBut as he looked into Will's eyes, he knew what he had to do."

        "writing_prompt": "After surviving the horrors of Tartarus, Will and Nico have developed quiet rituals to soothe their lingering fears. One sleepless night, they find themselves dancing in the kitchen, holding each other close as the weight of their shared past fades into the rhythm of the present.",
        "story": "The kitchen was always their sanctuary.\nA place where they could escape the weight of their duties and the shadows of their past. But tonight, it was more than that. Tonight, it was a refuge from the demons that haunted their dreams.\n\nWill stood at the counter, his fingers drumming a slow beat on the worn granite surface. Nico leaned against the island, his eyes fixed on the dimly lit space between them. The air was heavy with tension, the only sound the soft hum of the refrigerator and the occasional creak of the old house.\n\nIt had been months since they'd escaped Tartarus, but the memories still lingered. The screams, the darkness, the feeling of being trapped and helpless. Will's fingers stilled, and he turned to Nico, his eyes searching for a spark of recognition.\n\nNico's gaze met his, and for a moment, they just looked at each other. The silence between them was a living thing, a palpable entity that wrapped itself around their hearts. Then, without a word, Nico pushed off from the island and walked towards Will.\n\nTheir bodies met in the middle of the kitchen, a collision of skin and muscle that sent a jolt of electricity through both of them. Will's arms wrapped around Nico, holding him close as they swayed to the rhythm of the silence.\n\nIt started as a gentle sway, a slow dance that only they could hear. But as the moments ticked by, their movements became more fluid, more synchronized. The kitchen was filled with the sound of their breathing, the soft thud of their feet on the floor.\n\nWill's fingers drifted up Nico's back, tracing the curves of his spine as they moved. Nico's hands settled on Will's hips, pulling him closer as they lost themselves in the music of the present.\n\nFor a while, they forgot about the horrors they'd faced, the monsters they'd battled, and the weight of their responsibilities. They forgot about everything except the beat of their hearts, the pulse of their love.\n\nAs the night wore on, their dance became more frenzied, more passionate. They moved in time with the music of their own making, their bodies entwined as they lost themselves in the rhythm of their love.\n\nAnd when they finally slowed, their chests heaving with exertion, they stood there, wrapped in each other's arms, their hearts still pounding in time. The kitchen was quiet once more, the only sound the soft hum of the refrigerator and the gentle beat of their love.\n\nIn that moment, they knew they'd made it through the worst of it. They'd survived Tartarus, and they'd come out stronger on the other side. As they stood there, holding each other close, they knew that no matter what lay ahead, they'd face it together, their love a beacon of hope in the darkness."
