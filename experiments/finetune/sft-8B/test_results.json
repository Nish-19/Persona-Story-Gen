        "pred_story": "The old woman was so old that the only reason she was still in her chair was because the chair was glued to her bum. \n\nShe was wearing a black dress that looked like it was a combination of the entire black hole from the movie gravity and the movie the night of the living dead. \n\nShe was old, she was ugly and she was clearly insane, but she had a presence of power that made you want to do whatever she wanted. \n\nYou could tell that she was powerful by the fact that her head was glowing with an otherworldly energy. The energy was white, like a bright star in the sky, and it was so strong that it made you feel weak. \n\nYou were so weak that you couldn't even lift your arms to block the dagger that was being thrust into your heart. \n\nThe dagger was long and thin, and it was tipped with a sharp point that glowed with a dark purple energy. \n\nIt was a weapon that was made from the soul of a demon, and it was the only thing that could kill the old woman. \n\nBut you knew that you didn't deserve to die like this. You were just a new born baby and you didn't have the chance to say goodbye to your parents. \n\nYou tried to cry out for help, but your cry was muffled by the blanket that was wrapped around your face. \n\nYou tried to move your arms and legs, but they were stuck to the bed by some unseen force. \n\nThe old woman looked at you with a look of sadness in her eyes. \"I've been waiting centuries for you to be born,\" she said. \"I've been waiting for a chosen one to come along and kill me.\" \n\n\"You're a chosen one?\" you asked, but you couldn't speak. You were just a baby and you didn't have a voice yet. \n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"A chosen one is someone who is destined to kill a powerful being. They are special because they are the only ones who can kill the being without the being being able to defend itself.\" \n\n\"You're the powerful being?\" you asked, but the old woman didn't answer. She just looked at you with a sad look in her eyes. \n\n\"I don't want to die,\" you said, but your voice was muffled by the blanket. \n\nThe old woman smiled. \"I know,\" she said. \"But you have to die. It's the only way for us to be free.\" \n\n\"Who is us?\" you asked, but the old woman didn't answer. She just looked at you with a sad look in her eyes. \n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said. \"But I have to do this. I'm sorry that you were born to kill me.\" \n\nShe pulled the dagger out of your heart and it stopped glowing with energy. \n\nThe old woman looked at you with a look of relief in her eyes. \"I'm glad that's over,\" she said. \"Now I can finally rest.\" \n\nShe pulled the blanket away from your face and you looked at her. She was much more beautiful than you thought she was. \n\n\"I'm glad that it was you,\" you said, but your voice was weak. \n\nThe old woman smiled. \"I'm glad that it was you too,\" she said. \"You've saved me from a long and painful death.\" \n\nShe hugged you tight and you felt her warm breath on your face. \n\n\"Thank you,\" she said. \"Thank you for killing me.\" \n\nYou looked at her and saw that she was a little old lady. She had grey hair and wrinkles on her face. She looked like a sweet little old lady who should be in a nursing home. \n\nBut she wasn't in a nursing home. She was in a bed, with a dagger sticking out of her heart, and a look of peace on her face. \n\n\"I think I need a drink,\" the little old lady said. \n\nAnd then she looked at you and smiled. \n\n\"You're the chosen one,\" she said. \"The one who is destined to kill me. But I think you're also the one who is destined to save me.\" \n\n\"You're saying that I'm the chosen one?\" you asked, but the little old lady didn't answer. She just looked at you with a sad look in her eyes. \n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"You are the chosen one. But I don't think you know who you are.\" \n\n\"You're saying that I'm the chosen one and I don't know who I am?\" you asked, but the little old lady didn't answer. She just looked at you with a sad look in her eyes. \n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"You are the chosen one. But I don't think you know who you are. And I don't think you know who I am either.\" \n\n\"You're saying that I don't know who I am?\" you asked, but the little old lady didn't answer.

She just looked at you with a sad look in her eyes. \n\n\"You're saying that I'm the chosen one, but I don't know who I am?\" you asked, but the little old lady didn't answer. She just looked at you with a sad look in her eyes. \n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"I'm saying that you don't know who you are. But you will find out who you are. And you will find out who I am. And you will find out why I have to kill you.\" \n\n\"That's really messed up,\" you said, but the little old lady didn't answer. She just looked at you with a sad look in her eyes. \n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"It's really messed up. But it's the only way for us to be free.\" \n\n\"Do you think that's really messed up?\" you asked, but the little old lady didn't answer.

I guess that makes sense,\" said the man in front of the glass door. \n\nAs I walked to work, I saw a man in a white suit standing in front of the glass door, his arms crossed. I rubbed my eyes, as if they were playing a trick on me. \n\nI walked around the man and walked into the office, passing the security guard, who was sleeping on the bench, leaning on the door.\n\n\"Hey, Thompson! You\u2019re late, again!\" said one of the receptionists, as I walked past her.\n\n\"Did she call you Thompson too?\" I thought, as I made my way to my desk, where my chair was broken as before. \"Someone must have left a broken chair in the storage room. I need to call maintenance again!\" I thought to myself.\n\nI was now sitting at my desk. I tried to turn on my computer. I tried to turn it on the usual way. When it still wouldn't turn on, I tried the other way. It still wouldn't turn on. \n\nI went to the computer lab, to see if any of the computers were working. They were all working as usual. I saw the man again, sitting at a computer, his arms crossed. He looked up at me, and I froze.\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Thompson. I know this must be very confusing for you. However, the reason we are speaking now is to prevent something terrible from happening. You have to do something. If you do it, a world ending event will occur.\" He said. \n\n\"No! It was a typo! You must be joking!\" I shouted.\n\n\"I assure you, Mr. Thompson, that this is not a joke. You will need to do this for the good of humanity.\" He said.\n\n\"But I don\u2019t want to! I want to go home and eat my dinner, and go to the office, and watch TV. I want to watch a movie with my friends. I don\u2019t want to do anything that might make anyone die! I don\u2019t want to help you and your future humans!\" I said.\n\n\"You will regret not doing this, Mr. Thompson. You are going to cause one of the greatest tragedies in human history. The human race is already on the edge of disaster. If you do not do this, it will be worse. However, I will leave here, if you do one thing.\" He said. \n\n\"If you do one thing, I will be able to save the world. We have found out that a rogue planet will collide with Earth, but we also know that if it does, it will kill every person on Earth. However, we have found out that there is a small planet, about the size of Pluto. We have a ship that can go there and pick up a number of Earth humans, and return to Earth and save us. You have to do something that will allow us to do this.\" He said.\n\nI was so shocked and confused that I didn\u2019t know what to say. I looked at the man and then looked at the window. I was on the 25th floor. I knew that I wasn\u2019t going to jump out the window.\n\nI looked back at the man, and then looked at the computer behind him. I looked at the screen and I could see his history, all of his past actions on this computer. I saw a strange symbol, something that looked like it was made out of the Greek letter lambda and some other letters.\n\n\"You mean I have to do something that will get us a ship to take to Pluto? But what if Pluto doesn\u2019t have any humans on it?\" I said.\n\n\"There are many humans on Pluto, Mr. Thompson. In fact, there are enough humans on Pluto to make the human race grow and thrive again. But you need to do something to make that happen.\" He said.\n\n\"What do I need to do?\" I asked.\n\n\"Look at the computer screen, you will see a picture of my face. I am going to leave, now. When I do, I will tell you what to do. But before I do, I want to show you something. Look at the screen.\" He said.\n\nI looked at the computer screen, and it was like I was looking into a mirror. It was my face. It was me. The man was me.\n\n\"Wait! I\u2019m you!\" I said.\n\n\"I am you. I have been you for many years. I am you when you are old. I have been sent back in time, many times. And each time, I have found myself stuck here, stuck in the time period of when you are alive. But each time, I have tried to make you do something that would help to save the future. Each time, I have tried to make you do something that would help to save the human race. But you have never listened to me. And each time, the world has come to an end. And each time, I have been sent back in time again. And each time, I have been given another chance to make you do something that will save the human race. And each time, you have never listened to me. But I know that you are the only one who can save the human race. I know that you are the only one who can prevent a world ending event. And I know that you will do it.\" He said.\n\nI was speechless. I looked at the man in front of me, and I knew it was me. I knew that I was the future me, and that I had been sent back in time to save the human race. But I had been so caught up in my life that I had never seen it coming. I had never seen it coming, because I had never looked up at the sky. I had never looked up at the sky, to see the rogue planet, that was now on a collision course with Earth.\n\n\"Wait! What happens when the planet hits us? What happens when the ship leaves?\" I asked.\n\n\"When the planet hits us, Mr. Thompson, the world as we know it will come to an end. I am a temporal agent, and I have been sent back in time to prevent the end of the world. I have been sent back in time to make you do something that will allow us to save the human race. And that something, is a small change to your plans. That small change, will make it possible for us to save the human race, and the future of humanity will be bright. But if you do not do what I ask, I will have to leave. And when I do, you will do what you have always done, you will ignore the message, and you will not change your plans. And when you do not change your plans, the human race will come to an end. But I will be back, again. I will be back, again and again, until you finally do what I ask. But this time, will be different, this time, you will not be able to ignore the message. This time, you will not be able to ignore the warning. This time, you will not be able to ignore the plea. But this time, you will be"

A strange light had appeared out of nowhere. As it drew closer, it had the shape of a ship. And this was no ordinary ship. It was massive, at least the size of the entire fleet of the United Earth Space Probe Command. Its hull was unlike anything they had ever seen before. It seemed to be alive, with tendrils of silver that flowed across its surface like blood.\n\n\"We will try to contact them, Lieutenant Commander,\" Captain Zara replied. She leaned back in her chair, her eyes fixed on the alien ship. \"Try to hail them.\"\n\nThe viewscreen flickered to life, and the image of a young woman appeared. She was not unlike the humans who had crewed the Enterprise, with brown skin and black hair that fell to her shoulders.\n\n\"Hello,\" she said. \"We come in peace.\"\n\nThe humans exchanged a nervous glance.\n\n\"I am Captain Zara,\" the human captain replied. \"And these are my crew. We welcome you.\"\n\nThe woman nodded. \"I am Ambassador Kora. I bring greetings from my people, the Xh\u2019shan.\"\n\n\"Ambassador,\" Captain Zara replied. \"I would have thought you would have known that we are a peace-loving species. We have never started a war. We are a fledgling species, and we are still learning how to navigate the galaxy.\"\n\nKora nodded. \"I know this. But we have been watching you for some time, and we are concerned.\"\n\n\"What is it that you\u2019re concerned about?\" the human asked.\n\n\"We are concerned that you might be a threat to our people,\" Kora replied. \"We have seen your military build-up. We know you have the capacity to reach the stars and reach for the heavens.\"\n\nCaptain Zara rubbed her temples. She had thought that the human fleet was impressive, but the Xh\u2019shan\u2019s were orders of magnitude larger. Their technology was also far beyond humanity\u2019s.\n\n\"Listen, Ambassador. We are not going to hurt you. We are a peaceful species. We have never hurt another species. We\u2019re just trying to learn and explore. Why do you think we would be a threat?\"\n\nKora sighed. \"We have seen the way you have treated your own species. The wars you have started. The destruction you have caused. We cannot help but believe that you will do the same to us.\"\n\nCaptain Zara looked at her crew. They were all shocked by this. They didn\u2019t know that they were being watched, let alone that they were being judged.\n\n\"Alright, Ambassador,\" Captain Zara replied. \"Let us try to reassure you. We are not a threat. We are a peaceful species. We will work with you to ensure that there is no harm to either of us.\"\n\nKora nodded. \"I will go back and speak to our leaders. I will work with your captain to ensure that there is no harm to either of us. But I warn you, Captain Zara. We have seen the way you have treated your own species, and we will be watching. We will be ready. And if you try to harm us, we will do everything in our power to defend ourselves.\"\n\nCaptain Zara nodded. She would not lie to these beings. They were a powerful species, and they were capable of defending themselves.\n\n\"Thank you, Ambassador. I will speak to my crew and make sure that there is no harm to either of us. I will do everything in my power to ensure that our encounter is peaceful.\"\n\nKora nodded, and the viewscreen flickered back to life. The alien ship had disappeared, and the human fleet was left in an uneasy silence.\n\n\"What was that, Captain?\" Lieutenant Commander Rachel asked. She looked at her captain, her eyes wide with fear.\n\n\"We will talk about it later, Lieutenant Commander,\" Captain Zara replied. \"First, I want to speak with my crew and explain to them what happened.\"\n\nThe crew of the Enterprise nervously awaited the captain\u2019s words. They had been trying to make contact with the alien ship, and they had been successful. But at what cost?"

They had been defeated in battle, and it would take them a long time to recover. If they ever recovered.\n\nThe hero looked around at the soldiers, who were standing around them with their weapons drawn. They looked at the hero, who was now in their sights. The hero looked at the hero, and then at the hero again.\n\n\"Hey, let me ask you a question,\" the hero said. \"You know how I'm a hero and you're a soldier, right?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the soldier replied. \"We've heard stories about your exploits.\"\n\n\"Right, well, have you ever thought about how that's stupid?\" the hero asked. \"I mean, think about it, I'm a hero, and you're a soldier. That's literally the same thing. But instead of a hero, you're a soldier, and instead of a sword, you have a gun. But the fact that you're fighting against me, a hero, is just as weird as if you were fighting me.\"\n\nThe soldier looked confused. \"I don't understand,\" he said.\n\n\"You see, if I was a real hero, I would be using my sword to fight against you, and you would be using your gun to defend yourself. That would make sense. But the fact that I'm using my sword to fight against you, and you're using your gun to fight against me, it's just weird. And that's because the whole concept of heroes and soldiers is stupid.\"\n\nThe soldier looked confused. \"I don't understand,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not that you're stupid, it's just that the concept of heroes and soldiers is stupid. But you're a soldier, so you're used to fighting against heroes, and you're used to thinking of me as a hero. So when you're fighting against me, you're fighting against your expectations. And that's not something you can change, no matter how hard you try.\"\n\nThe soldier looked around at the other soldiers, who were all looking at him with confused expressions. The hero looked at the hero, and then at the hero again.\n\n\"Hey, let me ask you something,\" the hero said. \"What do you think the hero would do if they were in your shoes?\"\n\nThe soldier looked at the hero. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"What would they do?\"\n\n\"They would do what they always do,\" the hero said. \"They would go back to the city and tell everyone that they've been defeated in battle.

But, I had to do it.\n\n\"Oh, come on.\" I said with a grin, and the genie couldn't help but chuckle. \"I'm not asking for the moon, are you kidding me? It's just a simple wish, something that will make me rich beyond my wildest dreams.\"\n\nThe genie shook its head and let out a sigh. \"I don't want to grant this wish, but if I must. What is your wish?\" the genie's voice was tinged with regret and resignation.\n\nI held my breath as I asked my question. \"I want you to create a magic portal to the future, which appears in my living room. The portal is large enough for me to fit through and the future is 100 years from now. Can you do that?\" I paused, taking a moment to glance at the genie before continuing. \"And, can you allow me to look in the portal without stepping through?\"\n\nThe genie looked at me as if trying to understand, and I could sense the genie's confusion. \"Why are you asking for a portal to the future? Is it because you want to see your future or something?\"\n\nI shrugged as I replied, \"Well, I don't know what I am asking for, but if I can see my future in the portal, I will be able to see if my wish was granted.\"\n\nThe genie nodded and looked at the floor for a moment. \"Alright, I'll create the portal. But, I am not happy with you.\" The genie then raised its hands and focused its magic. As I watched the wall shimmer and change into a shimmering portal, the genie spoke once more. \"You may look, but do not step through it. I won't be responsible for your actions.\"\n\nI nodded and stepped forward, looking at the portal. I saw a bright, shimmering light, but as I looked closer, I saw the image of my living room, but 100 years in the future. I could see that the room had changed and was now filled with strange items. I could see people moving around and doing things, but they were all ghosts, or at least, they appeared to be ghosts.\n\nI turned around to face the genie and saw that it was now in a position that blocked my view of the portal. \"What does it mean?\" I asked, trying to understand what I had seen.\n\nThe genie shrugged. \"You'll just have to see. You should be happy with your wish, don't you think?\" The genie then turned and disappeared, leaving me to ponder my wish and what I had seen.\n\nI thought back to my life and how it had gone. I had always felt like something was missing, and it was then that I realized what it was. It was the knowledge of my future and the path that I was on. I had always wanted to know if I was on the right path or if I was on the wrong path. I was glad that I had been able to get some insight into my future, but now I felt guilty for asking. I had taken something that I had never had before, the knowledge of my future.\n\nI tried to think about what I had seen. I had seen people doing strange things, and they appeared to be ghosts. I didn't know if it meant that I was going to die and be a ghost, or if I was going to be trapped in a world that I had never experienced before. I didn't know what I had gotten myself into.\n\nBut, I did know one thing. I was not going to step through that portal."

I had all the time in the world to do nothing, and I was starting to get a bit bored.\n\nBut, I did have a plan, and it was a good one. I was going to twist my master's wishes to the detriment of both my current and former master. I had been watching my current master for a while, and I knew exactly what he would do if he were granted any one of the three wishes. And, I had the power to make it happen.\n\nMy current master was a lazy man. He spent most of his days binge-watching TV shows and playing video games. He never got any exercise, and he loved eating junk food. He was obese, and he knew it. He had a wife who loved him dearly, but she was starting to get frustrated with his lack of effort. She had started to take him to the gym with her, but he hated it. He would always find a way to get out of it.\n\nI knew that my master's wish would be for wealth. He was constantly worried about money, and he loved the idea of having a lot of it. He would spend it all on fancy cars and houses, and he would never be satisfied with the amount of money he had.

He was not a man of principle, and he would do whatever it took to get what he wanted.\n\nSo, I was confident that his wish would be for wealth. And, I was ready to twist it to my advantage. I had been watching my former master for a while, and I knew exactly what he would do if he were granted any one of the three wishes. He was a good man, but he was not wise. He was a simple man who liked simple things. He wanted a nice house, a beautiful wife, and a happy family.

The cell was made of an unknown metal, and there was no way to get the door open. \n\nThere was a single chair in the middle of the room, and the man who sat on it had a single eye. It was a piercing blue and it fixed him as he spoke.\n\n\"Did you hear me? We're here for your execution.\" The one-eyed man said. He was older, wrinkled and grey.

He had a feeling that this was going to be worse than he thought.\n\n\"Yes,\" The one-eyed man said. He was laughing. He was actually laughing. \n\nThe jailer felt a bit of anger and it quickly turned into excitement. He felt a sense of thrill that he had never felt before.\n\n\"What's your name?\"\n\n\"No.\" The one-eyed man said. \"I don't have a name. I am a god.\"\n\n\"God?\"\n\nThe one-eyed man nodded.

I will let you know why you are here.\"\n\nThe one-eyed man closed his eyes. \"You are here because of an entity. The entity has been here since the beginning of time. It is older than you are. It is older than the Earth. It is older than the universe. It is an entity that has been here for all of time, and it has been waiting for me.

He pointed at the jailer.\n\n\"You're saying that I have to let you go, and that I have to let the other gods on the planet go?\"\n\nThe one-eyed man nodded a third time. He was looking at the jailer.\n\n\"And why is that?\"\n\nThe one-eyed man was signing again, and he was laughing. He was still looking at the jailer.\n\n\"I don't know what to say.\" The jailer said. He was looking at the one-eyed man.\n\n\"It doesn't matter.\" The one-eyed man said. \"You don't know what to say, and that's exactly the point.\"\n\nThe jailer looked at the one-eyed man.

        "pred_story": "\"Good grief, not you again.\" The voice was that of the woman I'd been hearing for what felt like years. She was beautiful, with long dark hair and green eyes that sparkled in the light. I couldn't remember how I knew her, but I was sure I'd met her before.\n\n\"Ah, darling, you'd think you'd be used to seeing me by now,\" a voice with an Irish brogue said, and I recognized Death. I wasn't sure what had happened, but the man's black robes and scythe were unmistakable. \n\n\"I'm not used to seeing you, that's the problem,\" the woman said, standing next to me in my bed. She was a vision, a beautiful nurse. I couldn't remember her name, but her kind heart was something I remembered clearly. She would talk to me, tell me stories, and read to me. I felt her hand on my chest, as if she would still check my pulse. I felt myself breathe, as if she could still take care of me. My heart raced, as if it had always done so.\n\n\"Life, darling, you know I'd never leave you without a fight.\" Death's voice was low, but I felt his warmth as if he were a real man, right there beside me. I couldn't remember his name, but I'd heard him talk to Life so many times before. He'd complain about her constant nagging, but I never remembered her doing so. She would never let him get away with anything, but he'd always do his job.\n\n\"I suppose that's true, but you could at least do what I ask.\" Life's voice was soft, but firm. She held his scythe in one hand, as if ready to fight him if need be. Death didn't flinch, but his scythe shook ever so slightly in his hand.\n\n\"What did you want me to do that I didn't already do?\" Death asked, and I felt a twinge in my chest. I knew he'd done his job, but I wasn't sure if he'd done it out of duty or love.\n\n\"Don't play dumb with me,\" Life said, her voice rising. \"You know exactly what I'm talking about. You're not going to leave him to suffer in this bed forever.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to leave him alone,\" Death said, his voice softer now. \"I'll stay by his side until the end, but there is no end to this. He's been in a coma for years, Life. I've been by his side, watching over him. What if he doesn't wake up?\"\n\n\"I suppose that's true,\" Life said, her voice softer now. \"But you should still try to wake him up. He might still be in here somewhere, and I'm sure he'd want to see you, not me.\"\n\nI didn't know that, but I didn't want to think about it. I'd always liked watching Life and Death argue. They were like an old married couple, always bickering and fighting. But in a good way, they loved each other. I'd never seen them together like that before, and I wasn't sure if I wanted to.\n\n\"Life, darling, you know I'll never say no to you.\" Death's voice was soft now, and I felt his hand on Life's hip. It was a gentle touch, and I couldn't help but feel happy for them. I'd never seen Death so caring, so loving, but I had to admit it was kind of nice to see. I wasn't sure if it was real or just for my benefit, but I didn't care.\n\n\"Thank you, Death. I know you'll do what's best for him.\" Life's voice was soft now, and I felt her hand touch Death's face. He closed his eyes, and I felt him breathe, as if he were a real man. I couldn't remember him breathing, but it was nice to think so. \n\n\"Wait, I have an idea,\" I said, my voice weak, but I was glad I could speak.\n\n\"What is it, my love?\" Death asked, his voice warm, and I felt him smile.\n\n\"Set them up with each other,\" I said, my voice rising, as if it was the only thing that mattered. I felt Life and Death look at me, confused, but I didn't care.\n\n\"What did you mean?\" Death asked, his voice rising, and I felt his scythe shake in his hand.\n\n\"I mean, you two love each other, don't you?\" I asked, my voice steady now.\n\n\"What's that got to do with you?\" Life asked, her voice soft, but firm.\n\n\"You're both lonely,\" I said, my voice rising now. \"You've been alone for so long, and I'm sure you both would love to spend the rest of your lives together.\"\n\n\"Dear, you're a sweet boy,\" Death said, his voice warm, and I felt his hand on my chest.\n\n\"I don't want to die alone,\" Death said, his voice shaking. \"I've been lonely for so long, Life.\"\n\n\"I've felt lonely too,\" Life said, her voice soft, and I felt her hand touch Death's face.\n\n\"I'm glad you understand,\" Death said, his voice rising, and I felt his scythe shake in his hand.\n\n\"I love you, Death,\" Life said, her voice rising now.\n\n\"I love you too, Life,\" Death said, and I felt them kiss, as if they were real people.\n\nI couldn't believe it. I was happy for them, and I couldn't think of any other way to make them happy. I was grateful to be a part of their love story, even if it was just as a silent observer.\n\nThe woman - Life - had been visiting me every day, talking to me, reading to me, and taking care of me. I knew she was just doing her job, but it was nice to have someone to talk to. I couldn't remember her name, but I felt a deep affection for her. And the man - Death - was always there too. He'd come to visit me, talk to me, and complain about Life. I knew he was just kidding, but it was nice to see him and Life interact. But when they started arguing, I felt like I'd been transported to another world. They loved each other, but they were like two old married couples, always bickering and fighting. But I loved hearing them argue, and I felt like I was a part of their love story, even if I wasn't really there. But I'd been watching them for years, and I'd seen the way they looked at each other. I'd seen the way they touched each other, and I knew they loved each other. So when they were arguing about whether or not to wake me up from my coma, I knew I had to say something. And so I did.\n\n\"You two love each other,\" I said, my voice weak, but firm.\n\n\"That's true, my dear,\" Death said, his voice warm, and I felt his hand on my chest.\n\n\"But what do you want us to do?\" Life asked, her voice soft, but firm.\n\n\"I want you two to be together,\" I said,"

I had seen what happened to the elves who had fallen in love with humans. I had seen the pain, the suffering, the blood. I knew that our love was too much for us to handle, but I couldn't help the way I felt. I couldn't help the way I loved him.\n\n\"But I love you,\" I said, my voice shaking. \"And I want us to be together. I want us to be happy.\"\n\nHe sighed and leaned his head forward, his face inches from mine.\n\n\"I know you do,\" he said. \"And I want it too. I want us to be together. I want us to be happy. But we can't. We just can't.\"\n\nI nodded slowly, the words sinking into my heart.\n\n\"I'll leave tomorrow,\" I said, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nHe nodded and leaned in closer, his lips brushing against mine."

        "pred_story": "I sat in my cell, wondering how I ended up here. I remembered a car accident on my way home from a party with friends. But the next thing I knew, I was here. A place I could only call hell. A place I called home now. A place with its own rules and its own hellish government. A place with no mercy. A place with no escape.\n\nBut I wasn't alone. Four people had beaten the impossible tasks. Four people that had escaped hell to return to the living. Four people that had made it back to their homes. Four people that had left a note behind. A note that said their names and a message to the living: \"If you want to escape, I'm here to guide you.\"\n\nThe first note was found by a man named James. The note said to follow the words of the man that said \"Love one another.\" But James was only doing good for himself. He had only married a woman for her wealth. He had only cheated on her with the company's secretary. He had only told his wife that she was being foolish when she wanted children. He had only lied about his affairs. He had only ignored his wife's requests.\n\nThe second note was found by a woman named Sophia. The note said to seek the words of the man that said \"Hate one another.\" But Sophia was only angry at the world. She was only angry at the people that treated her poorly. She was only angry at the people that looked at her differently. She was only angry at the people that judged her. She was only angry at the people that didn't understand her. She was only angry at the world.\n\nThe third note was found by a man named Marcus. The note said to follow the words of the man that said \"Seek power.\" But Marcus was only seeking power for himself. He had only stolen from the company to fund his own projects. He had only embezzled funds to pay for his own lavish lifestyle. He had only stolen money from the company to buy a mansion. He had only stolen money from the company to buy a yacht. He had only lied to the company to get away with it.\n\nThe fourth note was found by a woman named Rachel. The note said to seek the words of the man that said \"You are gods.\" But Rachel was only seeking power for herself. She had only taken money from the company to pay for her own personal expenses. She had only stolen from the company to pay for her own lavish lifestyle. She had only taken money from the company to pay for her own business.\n\nI sat in my cell, wondering how I would escape.

They believe they're living in a game or simulation. \n\nThat is, until she came to me.\n\n\"Please,\" she begged. \"Please don't send me away. I'll do anything. I'll clean your floors. I'll cook your meals. I'll even sleep on the couch.\"\n\nIt was late, about 10 PM. I had already finished my chores, but I decided to stay behind to watch TV. It was a night like any other night.

She was strong. \"Please,\" she begged. \"Let me go.\"\n\nI was taken aback. She was strong. She was stronger than me. \"Okay, okay,\" I said. \"I'll let you go. But first, let me tell you something.\"\n\nI held her close. I held her close and looked into her eyes. \"You're a villainess,\" I said. \"But you're a villainess in a game.

You have to trust me completely. Can you do that?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"I can do that.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I said. \"Because I'm going to tell you a secret.\"\n\n\"I'm ready,\" she said.\n\n\"Are you sure you're ready?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.\n\n\"Okay,\" I said. \"Here it is.

You're covered in dirt.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh,\u201d I said as I looked at my clothes. \u201cI must have gotten dirty while going through the woods.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could have helped you,\u201d Eira said as she shook her head. \u201cInstead, you went and scared everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone is okay,\u201d I said as I walked towards her. \u201cThanks for checking on them.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Eira said as she looked up at me. \u201cI'll let it slide this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I said as I hugged her. \u201cI know it's your birthday.\u201d\n\nEira patted my back. \u201cIt's okay,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we should have done something special.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpecial what?\u201d I asked as I pulled back.\n\n\u201cSpecial birthday cake,\u201d Eira said. \u201cWe could go back to town and get a cake from the market.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can't do that,\u201d I said as I looked out at the forest. \u201cIt's dark. We wouldn't make it back in time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou're right,\u201d Eira said. \u201cI forget that you can't see in the dark.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's not that,\u201d I said as I shook my head. \u201cWe've been traveling for months. We can't just leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Eira said as she looked up at me. \u201cI'll wait till we get back to town.\u201d\n\n\u201cEira, I have something to tell you,\u201d I said as I looked her in the eye. \u201cIt's your birthday and it's your last birthday.\u201d\n\nEira looked confused. \u201cMy last birthday?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow can that be? I'm only 499.\u201d\n\n\u201cEira,\u201d I said as I reached out and gently touched her cheek. \u201cIt's your last birthday because you're an elf.

In fact, all elves die after they reach their 500th birthday. You're immortal because you're an elf.\u201d\n\nEira looked confused as she shook her head. \u201cI don't understand,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I'm immortal, why are you acting like this is my last birthday?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you're not immortal in the way that you think you are,\u201d I said as I reached out and gently touched her cheek. \u201cYou're immortal in the sense that you're an elf and you live for a long time. But you're not immortal in the sense that you're going to live forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cForever?\u201d Eira asked as she shook her head. \u201cHow can I be immortal if I can die?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are dying,\u201d I said as I looked into her eyes. \u201cYou're dying because you're an elf and it's your 499th birthday.\u201d\n\nEira looked confused as she shook her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm not dying. I'm just turning 500.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you're an elf,\u201d I said as I looked into her eyes. \u201cAnd if you're dying when you turn 500, then it means that you're an elf that lives for 500 years. It means that you're immortal in the sense that you're an elf.\u201d\n\nEira looked at me as I spoke. She looked at me like I had lost my mind. \u201cYou're crazy,\u201d she said as she shook her head. \u201cI'm not immortal. I'm just an elf.\u201d\n\nEira stood up as she shook her head. \u201cI have to go,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm going to go celebrate my birthday.\u201d\n\nEira walked out of the door as I sat in my chair. I watched her as she walked. I watched her until she disappeared from view.\n\n\u201cEira,\u201d I said as I stood up. \u201cEira, stop.\u201d\n\nEira stopped in her tracks as she heard me call her name.

In the aftermath, the planet was now nothing more than a dark, twisted mockery of its former self. The once blue skies were now a sickly green, the air thick with the haze of a toxic brew that poisoned everything it touched. The oceans churned with acidic darkness, spewing forth grotesque monstrosities that terrorized the few remaining survivors.\n\nIn this desolate future, humanity had long since been reduced to mere slivers of its former self. The few remaining settlements clung to the ruins of cities, scrounging for whatever scraps they could find to keep their dying civilization alive.\n\nI had been a part of a group of scientists who had been working on a machine that could manipulate time. We had been experimenting with it, using it to travel to different eras. But something had gone terribly wrong. We had pushed the machine too hard, and it had malfunctioned, propelling us forward in time.\n\nWe had no idea how long we had traveled forward. But we had been in this desolate future for what felt like years, searching for any way to return to our own time. But every attempt at fixing the machine had failed.\n\nIt seemed that our only hope was to find someone who could help us. And so, we set out into the ruins of the world, searching for any sign of civilization. We had been traveling for weeks, and had yet to find anything. But we had to keep going. We had to keep trying.\n\nAs we walked through the ruins of a once great city, we stumbled upon a small settlement. It was a small group of people, huddled together in what seemed to be a makeshift shelter. We approached them cautiously, not wanting to startle them.\n\nOne of the people emerged from the shelter, a young woman with a scarred face and a look of pure terror in her eyes. She looked at us with a mix of fear and confusion, unsure of what to do.\n\n\"Who are you?\" she asked, her voice shaking.\n\n\"We're travelers from a different time,\" I replied. \"We're looking for a way to return to our own time.\"\n\nShe looked at us skeptically, unsure if we were telling the truth. But something in her eyes flickered, and she nodded.\n\n\"I'll take you to my people,\" she said. \"Maybe they can help you.\"\n\nWe followed her, and she led us to a small group of people who were gathered around a makeshift fire. They looked at us with a mix of curiosity and fear, unsure of what to do.\n\nThe young woman spoke to them in a language I didn't understand. They listened, and then nodded.\n\n\"We'll do what we can to help you,\" they said. \"But it's not going to be easy.\"\n\nI smiled, feeling a glimmer of hope. Maybe we could find a way to return to our own time after all.\n\nBut as we began to work with the people, I realized that their technology was far more advanced than anything we had. They had a deep understanding of the workings of the world, and they had used this knowledge to create incredible machines that could manipulate the very fabric of reality.\n\nIt was a revelation. They had been the ones who had destroyed the world. They had been the ones who had created this desolate future.\n\nI felt a wave of horror wash over me. How could I have trusted them? How could I have thought that they could help us?\n\nAnd then, something caught my eye. One of the machines had a glowing blue light emanating from it. It seemed to be calling to me, drawing me in.\n\nI walked towards it, feeling a strange pull. I reached out and touched it, and everything went black.\n\nWhen I came to, I was back in my own time. The world was still intact, and everything seemed to be normal. But something was off. Something felt different.\n\nAnd then, I saw it. A figure standing in front of me, looking at me with a mixture of surprise and curiosity.\n\nIt was the young woman, the one who had helped us. But something was different about her. She had the same scarred face, but it was... younger. It was as if she had been rejuvenated.\n\nI looked at her in confusion, unsure of what to do. And then, I realized.\n\nShe was from the future. The future that we had created.\n\nI felt a wave of horror wash over me. What had we done? What had we created?\n\nAnd then, it hit me. The future was a mirror image of our present. It was the same, but opposite. The past was the future, and the future was the past.\n\nI looked at the young woman, and I smiled. We had created her. We had created this desolate future.\n\nAnd then, I realized that it wasn't just her. The people we had met in the ruins, the ones who had helped us? They were the people from the future.\n\nI felt a wave of confusion wash over me. What did it mean? How could we have created something that was so different from ourselves?\n\nAnd then, it hit me. The people from the future had been us. We were them. We were the same people who had destroyed the world.\n\nI felt a wave of horror wash over me. What had we done? What had we created?\n\nAnd then, I realized that it was too late. The future was set. It was a done deal. We had made a choice, and we couldn't go back.\n\nI looked at the young woman, and I smiled. It was a sad smile. It was a smile of acceptance.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"I'm sorry that we couldn't go back. I'm sorry that we couldn't fix it.\"\n\nShe looked at me, her eyes filled with tears.\n\n\"I'm sorry too,\" she said. \"I'm sorry that we couldn't go back. I'm sorry that we couldn't fix it.\"\n\nWe stood there for a moment, looking at each other. And then, we hugged.\n\nI knew that it was goodbye. I knew that I would never see her again.\n\nBut I knew that I would be with her. We were the same people. We were the same.\n\nAnd then, everything went black.\n\nI never came to. I never woke up."

If I was being honest, I didn't remember much of anything from the past day.\n\nWhat was the sun like? It was an awful day, but I didn't remember that part. It was an awful day, but I was also in a different time and place. I didn't remember that either.\n\nI didn't really remember much of anything. What was my name again? I was an awful person, it wasn't much of a concern.\n\nI think my name is David, but what's a name, really? You can change it.\n\nI was in a courtroom. There were a lot of people in the room, and I saw a lot of papers on tables and all that. I didn't know what to do. I hadn't done anything wrong, or had I? I couldn't remember. I hadn't been in a courtroom in a long time, so maybe it was a good thing I didn't remember.\n\nA lawyer was trying to talk to me, but I was distracted by the papers. He had a nice smile on his face, but I couldn't understand what he was saying. I could see his lips moving, but the words didn't match the shape of the mouth. He was saying something about me being innocent, but I hadn't been convicted, so that would be a good thing. Or would it?\n\nI don't know, I don't care. I'm tired of this. I'm tired of myself, I'm tired of everyone else. I'm tired of everything.\n\nI looked up at the lawyer. He was still smiling at me, but it didn't make me feel any better. He was smiling too widely, like he knew a secret that he wasn't sharing.\n\n\"David,\" he said again. \"Please, David, it's okay. You're innocent. You can go home.\"\n\nI looked at him again. He was still smiling, but this time, I caught what he was saying. I hadn't committed the crime. He had a video of me watching a sports game at the arena. I hadn't been there, but I was there. Or something.\n\nI wasn't sure what was going on. I didn't remember anything, and I couldn't make sense of any of this. But the lawyer kept telling me that I was innocent, and that seemed good. I didn't want to be guilty. I don't think anyone wants to be guilty.\n\nI looked at the papers again. I saw a ticket stub, and a receipt from the concession stand. I didn't remember buying anything, or sitting in the arena. But the ticket stub said that I was there.\n\nI looked up at the lawyer again. He was still smiling, but I didn't care about that anymore. I was too confused.\n\nThe lawyer showed me another video. I was walking out of the arena. I wasn't sure where I was going. I don't remember. I do remember feeling happy. I do remember feeling alive. I do remember feeling something.\n\nThe lawyer was still smiling at me. \"David, David, it's okay. You're innocent. You can go home.\"\n\nI looked at him again. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what was going on. I didn't know anything."

He was in a suit, and his hair was short and neatly trimmed. I pointed at him and said, \u201cYou.\u201d He nodded and gestured for me to follow him. I did not want to, but he was moving towards the door, and I did not want to be left alone in this strange room. I followed him out into a hallway that seemed to stretch on forever.

I hesitated, but he seemed to be waiting for me to move forward, so I pushed the door open and stepped through it. The room was much like the first one, but it was empty. There was a small table in the center of the room with a chair in front of it. The man sat in the chair and gestured for me to take the other. I sat down and looked around the room. It was a cell of some kind, and I was trapped. The man leaned forward and said, \u201cI am sorry you were brought here.

He looked out the window and said, \u201cDo you see that?\u201d I looked out the window and saw a city that seemed to stretch on forever. The buildings were tall and colorful, and there were people moving around. I looked at him and said, \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d He looked at me and said, \u201cI do not know. I do not know how we got here. I do not know how to get back.\u201d I looked around the room and said, \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d He looked at me and said, \u201cYou can help me remember.

        "pred_story": "The world has always been in need of heroes, and that hero was always a man named Al. Al, a man who could heal any wound, was known as the hero everyone wanted to help. The public wanted a hero, and they got the one.\n\nAl had a few friends, and a few friends had a few things to do. These friends were all the ones that were a bit higher on the hero tier list, and Al was the one that was a bit lower. \n\nHowever, there were a few things that Al could do that these other heroes couldn't. Al was the only man that had a perfect immune system. If you put him in a room full of germs, he'd never get sick. That was a thing that could only be done through Al's healing powers. \n\nWhen the government heard that Al had a near perfect immune system, they wanted him to work for them. Al agreed, but he had one condition. He wanted to work with a team of friends, which he did. He worked with his old buddies and they all worked together to make the world a better place. They were all happy to be a part of the team and they all worked well together.\n\nHowever, as time passed, Al was seen as a bit more of a hero than the others on his team. His name became known as the hero of the world. The public wanted a hero, and they wanted that hero to be Al. They didn't know about the rest of the team, and they didn't care. They just wanted the best hero.\n\nAl was happy to be the hero of the world. He enjoyed the fame and the recognition, and he enjoyed the fact that he was able to help people in need. He was a hero, and he knew that he was doing what he was meant to do.\n\nHowever, as time passed, Al began to feel a bit uneasy. He was being asked to heal everyone's wounds, and he was being asked to fight in every battle. He was being asked to do everything, and he wasn't being given any breaks.\n\nThe team was happy to work with him, but they didn't like the fact that he was being asked to do everything. They wanted to help him, but they didn't know how. Al was the hero, and they wanted to make sure that he didn't burn out.\n\nOne day, Al woke up to a knock at the door. He opened it, and his friends were standing there. They had a very serious look on their faces, and Al could tell that something was wrong.\n\n\"What is it?\" Al asked.\n\n\"I think you're going to be upset,\" his friend replied.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean, have you seen the news lately? The world is falling apart, and you're the only one who can fix it.\"\n\n\"I've seen the news,\" Al replied. \"But I'm not going to fix everything. I'm going to heal people and help them, but I'm not going to do everything myself.\"\n\n\"You're the hero,\" his friend replied. \"It's what you do.\"\n\nAl was upset. He didn't want to be the hero anymore. He wanted to go back to being just another hero, but he didn't know how. He was happy with the recognition and the fame, but he didn't want to be in the spotlight all the time.\n\n\"I don't want to be the hero anymore,\" Al replied. \"I want to be just another hero.\"\n\nHis friends looked at each other. They had never seen Al like this before. He was always so happy and so eager to help.\n\n\"We can't let you do that,\" his friend replied. \"The world needs you.\"\n\nAl was upset. He didn't know what to do. He wanted to be a hero, but he didn't want to be the hero. He wanted to be just another hero, but he didn't know how.\n\n\"I'm going to go talk to the other heroes,\" his friend replied. \"Maybe they can help me figure out a way to make you happy.\"\n\nAl nodded. He was glad that his friend was going to help him. He was glad that they were going to try to make him happy.\n\nThe next day, Al's friend came back to him with a new idea.\n\n\"I've talked to the other heroes,\" his friend replied. \"They've agreed to work with you to make you happy.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that they're going to help you. They're going to work with you to make sure that you're happy and that you're comfortable.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure what to say.\"\n\n\"You don't have to say anything. Just be happy.\"\n\nAl was happy. He was glad that his friends were going to help him. He was glad that they were going to work with him to make sure that he was happy.\n\nThe next day, Al's friend came to him with the news that Al's wish had been granted. He was no longer going to be the hero of the world, and he was going to be just another hero. Al was happy, and he thanked his friend.\n\n\"I'm glad that I could help you,\" his friend replied. \"I hope that you're happy now.\"\n\nAl nodded. He was happy. He was glad that his friends had been able to make him happy, and he was glad that they were going to continue to work with him.\n\nHowever, Al's friend had one final request. He asked Al if he could join the side of evil. Al was taken aback. He hadn't thought about it, and he wasn't sure what to say.\n\n\"I don't know what to say,\" Al replied.\n\n\"Just say yes,\" his friend replied. \"I will make sure that you are happy.\"\n\nAl looked at his friend. He had always thought of his friend as a good friend, but he had never thought of him as the kind of person who would betray him. He had never thought of him as the kind of person who would join the side of evil.\n\n\"Are you sure?\" Al asked.\n\n\"Yes, I'm sure,\" his friend replied. \"I want to join the side of evil. I want to make sure that I'm happy.\"\n\nAl was confused. He didn't understand why his friend wanted to join the side of evil. He didn't understand why his friend wanted to betray him.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Al replied.\n\n\"I'll explain it to you later,\" his friend replied. \"Just say yes.\"\n\nAl was confused. He didn't know what to say. He didn't know what to do.\n\nHe was a hero. He was always supposed to do what was right. He was always supposed to be good.\n\nHe looked at his friend, and he saw something in his friend's eyes that he had never seen before. He saw something that he had never seen before, and he didn't know how to react.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Al replied. \"I don't think I can do that.\"\n\nHis friend looked at him with a shock. He had never thought that Al would say no.\n\n\"Why not?\" his friend asked.\n\nAl didn't know how to explain. He didn't know how to say what he felt.\n\n\"I'm just not sure that it's right,\" Al replied.\n\n\"It's right for me,\" his friend replied. \"And I'm sure that I can make it right for you too"

        "pred_story": "The sun had not set yet. Not that it mattered much. I had grown to dislike the sun. The way it rose with the promise of a new day, the way it dipped low into the horizon as the day wore on, only to leave us all blind and stumbling around like fools. The way it seemed to mock me as I crouched on the top of the hill. It seemed to smile at me, a cruel, taunting smile.\n\nThe beast I had come to kill was nowhere to be seen. I had seen the smoke. It rose into the air like a lazy cloud, and I had followed it, the only clue I had of the beast's whereabouts. I had found no tracks, no signs of disturbance, nothing to indicate the beast was anywhere nearby. But it was here. I could feel it. My heart pounded in my chest like a drum. My breath came in short, sharp gasps. My hands gripped the hilt of my sword so tightly my knuckles were white.\n\nI would have liked to be calm. I would have liked to stand on this hill and survey the view, to look out over the landscape and consider the best way to attack. But I couldn't do that. I couldn't do that because my sword was at my side. I couldn't do that because I was a knight, a defender of the realm, and I had come to kill the beast.\n\nAnd besides, I had a feeling it was hiding from me. A feeling that it was watching me from the bushes below, or the trees behind me. A feeling that it was waiting for me, for me to lower my guard.\n\nI couldn't let it get me. I wouldn't let it get me.\n\nI took a deep breath, and drew my sword. I let the blade shimmer in the sunlight, the steel glinting as I held it up. I let out a loud, bellowing roar, and shouted out my challenge.\n\n\"Come out, you beast! Come out and face me! I will vanquish you, I will kill you, and I will bring you to the ground! You will not pass, you will not escape, and you will not live to see the dawn! Come out, and die!\"\n\nI paused, my chest heaving as I awaited the beast's response. I could feel its eyes on me, could feel its breath on my neck. But it didn't come. It didn't answer. It just waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\n\"Did you really think you have the advantage with a sword?\" it said, its voice low and gravelly, the words dripping with sarcasm. \"Did you assume that smart dragons wouldn't make something infinitely better than a sword?\"\n\nI didn't look down. I couldn't look down. I knew what I would see. I knew that it was a dragon, a beast with wings and scales and teeth. I knew that it was a monster, a creature that was meant to be killed. And I knew that I was about to die.\n\n\"You'll never leave here,\" I said, trying to sound confident. \"You'll never leave this hill alive!\"\n\nThe dragon laughed. The sound was like thunder, a deep rumble that shook the ground beneath me. The sound was like fire, a burning flame that seemed to lick at my skin.\n\nIt was a shotgun.\n\nIt was a thing I had never seen before, a thing I had never imagined. It was a gun, a long and heavy barrel with a stock at one end and a trigger at the other. And it was a thing that shot shells, shells that flew through the air like arrows, shells that crashed into the ground like bombs.\n\nI didn't know what to say. I didn't know what to do. I was a knight, a defender of the realm. I was a warrior, a fighter. I was a man who wielded a sword and fought with his heart. And I was about to die.\n\n\"Did you really think you have the advantage with a sword?\" the dragon repeated, its voice dripping with sarcasm. \"Did you assume that smart dragons wouldn't make something infinitely better than a sword?\"\n\nI couldn't answer. I couldn't say anything. I could only stand there, frozen in terror, as the dragon aimed its shotgun at me and pulled the trigger.\n\nI closed my eyes, waiting for the end. Waiting for the sound of the shotgun, waiting for the pain of the shell.\n\nBut there was no sound. There was no pain.\n\nI opened my eyes to find the dragon holding its shotgun, its barrel smoking with the aftermath of the shot. It looked at me, looked at me with a smile on its face, and a spark in its eyes.\n\n\"You see, we've been expecting you,\" it said. \"We've been waiting for you. We've been preparing for you.\"\n\nI didn't understand. I didn't understand what the dragon was saying. I didn't understand why it was smiling at me.\n\n\"You see, we've been waiting for you,\" it repeated. \"We've been waiting for the knight, the defender of the realm. We've been waiting for you to come and kill us.\"\n\nI stared at the dragon, my mind reeling with confusion. I couldn't understand what it was saying. I couldn't understand why it was smiling at me.\n\n\"You see, we've been waiting for you,\" it repeated. \"We've been waiting for the knight, the defender of the realm. We've been waiting for you to come and kill us.\"\n\nI didn't say anything. I didn't know what to say. I didn't know what to do.\n\n\"You see, we've been waiting for you,\" it repeated. \"We've been waiting for the knight, the defender of the realm. We've been waiting for you to come and kill us.\"\n\nI didn't say anything. I didn't know what to say. I didn't know what to do.\n\nThe dragon smiled at me, a spark in its eyes. It nodded at me, a small, quick nod.\n\n\"Goodbye, knight,\" it said. \"Goodbye, defender of the realm.\"\n\nI didn't understand. I didn't understand what the dragon was saying. I didn't understand why it was smiling at me.\n\n\"I'll never leave you,\" I said. \"I'll never leave this hill alive.\"\n\nThe dragon nodded at me, a small, quick nod. It raised its shotgun, a heavy barrel that pointed at my heart.\n\n\"Goodbye, knight,\" it said. \"Goodbye, defender of the realm.\"\n\nI didn't understand. I didn't understand what the dragon was saying. I didn't understand why it was smiling at me.\n\nI closed my eyes, waiting for the end. Waiting for the sound of the shotgun, waiting for the pain of the shell.\n\nBut there was no sound. There was no pain.\n\nI opened my eyes to find myself standing on the hill, standing on the hill with nothing but a gun in my hand. I looked at the gun, looked at the barrel, and shook my head.\n\n\"Goodbye, knight,\" I said. \"Goodbye, defender of the realm.\"\n\nI smiled at myself, a small, quick smile. I nodded at myself, a small, quick nod.\n\nI raised the gun, pointed it at my heart, and pulled"

        "pred_story": "\"Ah, nice to meet you, my nephew! Or should I say, my future employee! Come along and let's grab a bite to eat, and we can talk about how I want you to help me out with my store.\"\n\nThe man was my uncle, a guy who made most people feel uneasy. He was tall, with a big nose and a crooked smile. He was always wearing a suit, and never did anything in the morning.\n\nI was a bit worried about taking the job, but the money was good, and I really needed it. I had gotten myself into a bit of a tight spot financially, so it was the perfect opportunity.\n\n\"Wow, you got a new suit! Where did you get it?\" I asked.\n\n\"It's a very expensive suit, I assure you. You'll be impressed.\"\n\nI was a bit worried about what I had gotten myself into, but I didn't want to ask him too many questions. So I nodded, and we headed into the shop.\n\n\"So, what do you want me to do first?\"\n\n\"Ah, well, I was thinking maybe you could start by dusting all of the old artifacts. My assistant, Joe, has been telling me that they need some cleaning.\"\n\n\"I don't mind doing that. Where do you want me to start?\"\n\n\"Let's start with the old vase.\"\n\nI looked over at the vase, and I could see it was old and had a lot of character. I could see that there were some scratches on the vase, and it looked like it had been dropped at some point.\n\n\"So, how long has this been here?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's been here for a long time. I've had it for years. I don't know how old it is, but it looks like it's from a long time ago.\"\n\nI wasn't sure about what to do, but I decided to try and find out more about the vase. So I reached out and touched the vase, trying to see if I could see anything about its past.\n\nAs soon as I touched the vase, I was hit with a wave of information. I could see the man who had made the vase, and I could see the people who had owned it over the years. I could see that it had been a gift to someone, and I could see the people who had given it.\n\nI saw a lot of things about the vase, but one thing that really stood out was that it had been used in a ritual. I could see that there were some strange markings on the vase, and I could see that it had been used in a ceremony.\n\nI was a bit worried about what I had seen, but I didn't want to ask my uncle about it. So I just continued dusting the vase.\n\n\"So, do you know much about the history of the vase?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, it's a bit of a mysterious object. I don't know much about it, but I've heard that it's very valuable.\"\n\n\"That's what I thought. I saw that it was very old.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. I've heard that it's been here for hundreds of years.\"\n\nI was a bit worried about what I had seen, but I didn't want to ask my uncle about it. I didn't want to ruin the vibe.\n\n\"Well, I'm glad I could help out. How much money do I get?\"\n\n\"Oh, you'll get a decent salary. I'll pay you twenty dollars an hour.\"\n\n\"That's great! I'll be happy to help out.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll talk to you later. I've got a few things to take care of.\"\n\nI nodded, and I continued dusting the vase. I was a bit worried about what I had seen, but I didn't want to ask my uncle about it.\n\n\"So, how long do you think I'll be here?\"\n\n\"Oh, well, you'll be here until the summer is over. I'm glad you decided to take the job.\"\n\n\"Thank you! I'll be happy to help out.\"\n\n\"Good. Well, I'll talk to you later.\"\n\nI nodded, and I continued dusting the vase. I was a bit worried about what I had seen, but I didn't want to ask my uncle about it.\n\n\"So, what's the deal with the vase?\" I asked my mom.\n\n\"Oh, it's a very old artifact. I don't know much about it, but I've heard that it's very valuable.\"\n\n\"I don't know. I've heard that it was used in a ritual. I've heard that it's very powerful.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. I've heard that too. But I don't know if I believe it.\"\n\n\"I don't know either. But I'm glad I got the job.\"\n\n\"Me too. I'm glad you're working for your uncle.\"\n\n\"I know. I just want to get the job done. I don't want to screw anything up.\"\n\n\"You'll be fine. You're a good kid.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Mom.\"\n\n\"Well, I've got to go. I'll talk to you later.\"\n\n\"Okay. Bye, Mom.\"\n\n\"Bye, kiddo.\"\n\nI hung up the phone, and I continued dusting the vase. I was a bit worried about what I had seen, but I didn't want to ask my uncle about it.\n\n\"So, where do you want me to go next?\"\n\n\"Oh, well, let's see. You can go to the old cabinet over there.\"\n\nI looked over at the cabinet, and I saw that it was filled with all sorts of old artifacts. I saw some old jewelry, some old paintings, and some old books. I saw that there were some old clocks, some old watches, and some old vases.\n\n\"Oh, wow! I love old artifacts! I love looking at them and touching them.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you're excited. But you have to be careful not to break anything.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't worry about that. I'll be careful.\"\n\nI carefully made my way over to the cabinet, and I began dusting it.\n\n\"So, where do you want me to go next?\" I asked my uncle.\n\n\"Oh, well, let's see. You can go to the old trunk over there.\"\n\nI looked over at the trunk, and I saw that it was old and worn out. I saw that it had some scratches on it, and I could see that it was filled with some old clothes.\n\n\"I'll be careful, Uncle. I don't want to break anything.\"\n\n\"I know. Just be careful, okay?\"\n\n\"I will. Thank you.\"\n\nI carefully made my way over to the trunk, and I began dusting it.\n\n\"So, what's the story behind this trunk?\" I asked my uncle.\n\n\"Oh, well, this trunk has been here for a long time. I don't know who made it, but I've heard that it's very valuable.\"\n\n\"I don't know. But I've heard that it's very powerful.\"\n\n\"Powerful?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I don't know what that means, but I've heard that it's very dangerous.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, I don't know if that's true. But I've heard that it's very valuable.\"\n\n\"I don't know what to think. I just want to get the job done.\"\n\n\"Okay. But be careful, okay?\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\nI carefully made my way"

        "pred_story": "\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, \u201cI am so sorry, but I have to ask. What is with all of these? There are boxes and boxes of these things, and I can\u2019t for the life of me imagine what you could need so many for.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d I said, \u201cdo you mean these?\u201d I held up the item in question. It was an ordinary t-shirt.\n\nThe hoarder looked at me, his eyes a little more alert now. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you need any of these?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t have them. I need them gone.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d the man said, \u201cI can get rid of them.\u201d \u201cThat would be great,\u201d I said. \u201cThank you for understanding.\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll go put them in the garage. We\u2019ll get them out of here soon, I promise.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can\u2019t thank me enough.\u201d I watched him walk away, and I sighed. I knew that it would be a long process.\n\nWe started sorting items into the four boxes we had brought. I had to pick up every item and hold it in my hand to examine it, which was a bit of a pain. But if I had to be honest, I wasn\u2019t sure how much stuff he was hoarding. It was my job to be objective, to keep an eye on everything, but I wasn\u2019t sure how much I could actually do about it. The man was an adult, and as far as I could tell, he had no issues. He could walk, talk, and feed himself, and he didn\u2019t seem to be in any kind of distress. He was just a man with a lot of stuff.\n\nIt took us hours to sort the items into the boxes. I kept an eye on the garage as we worked. It was a bit of a mess, but we had gotten a good start on it. I had started to lose track of how much stuff we had taken out, but I knew it was a lot.\n\nWhen we finally finished, I looked up at the man and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to go,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I will come back tomorrow to check up on you.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cI know I haven\u2019t been the best guest, but I promise to get better.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure you will,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to take your meds.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he said, and he gave me a smile. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said again.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d I walked out the door and back to my truck. As I drove away, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder about the man. I had never met anyone who hoarded to that extent before, and I wasn\u2019t sure how much stuff he had left in his house. But I had a feeling that I would be back there again tomorrow, and I would be sorting his belongings and tossing them into the boxes. I sighed, but I was happy that I could help him. I was a professional organizer, and it was my job to help people like this man. And I was glad that I could do it. I started the engine and pulled away from the curb, and I headed back to the office. I was a bit tired from the day\u2019s work, but I was ready to tackle whatever the next day would bring."

        "pred_story": "\"Where did you think I was?\" The voice echoed in his mind, the weight and tone of it something he could never quite explain, and even less so remember. Not like it was his own voice, anyway, the last time he had spoken aloud was to order a coffee. Or was it a coffee to order. He couldn't remember. The memories of the past year or so after the winged form had arrived were a jumbled mess.\n\nIt was the second time he had slept for more than a week. His body felt different now, though. It was as if it was made of a different material, something tougher and stronger, almost like leather or hide or something. The wings were stiff at first, but they had grown less stiff each time he had awoken. The tail was a bit less stiff, though he was sure he had seen it a few times and the feeling of it moving was still new. It was still a lot to get used to, though.\n\nHe looked around. He was in some sort of study, it looked like. A large desk and a large leather chair. The walls were lined with books, and there were a few bookshelves along the edges of the room. There was a large fireplace, though it was empty and cold, and a large window with curtains drawn. He could feel a window, though, and it was large. Almost as large as the window in his old flat.\n\nThe voice was in his mind again. \"Do you remember anything from your past?\"\n\nHe tried to think. He wasn't sure, though, if he could actually think. He felt something, though. It was as if he was remembering, but the memories were coming from his mind, rather than his past. That made no sense, but he couldn't help it.\n\n\"Do you remember your name?\"\n\nHe tried to think of it, but he couldn't. He felt like he was trying to think, but it was as if he had no brain. No, he corrected himself, it was as if he had no thoughts. He was trying to think, but he had no thoughts. It was frustrating, but he could remember that he had been trying to think. He was a bit relieved, in a way.\n\n\"I don't remember my name.\" He said out loud. He wasn't sure why he did. The voice was still in his mind, but it was as if it was speaking to him. Not that he could hear it in his mind, or not that he could see it or anything, it was just as if the voice was his. He could feel it, though. He could feel it in his mind, and he could feel it in his body. It was hard to describe, but it was as if the voice was him.\n\n\"Do you remember your family?\"\n\nHe tried to think, but he couldn't. He was starting to get frustrated, but the voice seemed to sense that and it offered him more information. He got a sense of people and places, and it felt like memories, but they weren't actually memories. They were impressions, though. They were impressions that he had gathered from somewhere, but he wasn't sure how. He could feel them, though. They felt like they were his, even though he didn't remember anything about them.\n\n\"There are some pictures in the attic. They might help you remember.\"\n\nHe walked to the window and drew the curtains back. The room was darker, and he could see a large wooden attic door that he hadn't noticed before. He went to the door and opened it. The attic was small, but it was full of old trunks and boxes and other items that he couldn't identify. He walked up to a large trunk in the corner and opened it.\n\nThere were a few old photographs inside, but none of them showed a face. There were a few pictures of the house, but they were old and they had been damaged over the years. There were a few other items, like a large wooden box with an old-fashioned lock on it, but he didn't have the key to open it. He left it alone and looked for something else. It was a bit disheartening, though. He had hoped that something would jog his memory, but it seemed like he was going to have to rely on the voice to try and remember anything.\n\n\"I'm sorry I couldn't help you.\" The voice said. He was relieved, in a way, that he had the voice to rely on. At least that way he wasn't alone. He felt a sense of relief that he hadn't felt before. He was still frustrated, though. He had hoped that he would remember something, even if it was just a name.\n\n\"It's okay,\" he said. \"I'll have to try and figure out who I am and how I got here.\"\n\nThe voice agreed with him. He could feel it nodding in his mind. He was happy to have the voice to help him, even if it was frustrating not being able to remember anything.\n\n\"We'll figure it out together.\" The voice said. He was relieved. He wasn't alone, and that was what mattered.\n\n\"So let's do this,\" he said. \"Let's try and figure out who I am.\""

I have powers that you can't even imagine.\"\n\nI try to think of a way to escape, but I'm not sure if it's possible.\n\n\"We're going to have a little fun tonight,\" she says, her voice dripping with excitement. \"I'm going to take your mind away from the world and let your body relax. You can't escape, my little prisoner. You're mine now.\"\n\nI try to scream, but my voice is silenced by the sound of her laughter.\n\nI wake up to the sound of screams coming from the next room. I can hear my own voice, but I'm not sure if it's my own voice or the voice of the princess.\n\nI'm not sure what I did, but I know it was wrong. I'm not sure how to escape, but I know I have to try.

        "pred_story": "The neon sign of the diner read 'Eggbert's', and it was the only bright spot on Main Street on this cold winter night.\n\nI had run the diner for years, with a handful of loyal customers and a steady stream of new faces, all in search of a warm meal and a cup of hot coffee.\n\nAs the night wore on, the crowd thinned out, and I could finally sit down to collect my thoughts and review the day's sales.\n\nBut, just as I was about to close up the diner and head home, the door swung open, and a man strode in. He was dressed in a long, black coat with a wide, black hat that covered his face. He wore no shoes, and his feet were blackened with dirt and grime.\n\n\"What can I get for you?\" I asked, as I stared at the stranger. He didn't seem to be in any hurry, and he sat down at a booth in the corner of the diner.\n\n\"A cup of coffee,\" he said, his voice low and gravelly.\n\nAs he sat there, he pulled out a small knife from his coat pocket and began to clean his nails with it.\n\nI was a bit uncomfortable, so I sat down at the counter, watching the man as I worked. He had a small cup of coffee brought to him, and he took a sip of it, his eyes closing as he savored the taste.\n\nAs the night wore on, I began to feel more at ease, despite the man's strange behavior. He didn't seem to be in any hurry, and he just sat there, drinking his coffee and cleaning his nails.\n\nFinally, as the night wore on, the man finished his coffee, and he stood up. He walked to the counter and leaned over, his breath hot and rank.\n\n\"I'll have another cup of coffee,\" he said, his voice low and gravelly.\n\nI was hesitant, so I asked him, \"How much will I need to charge you for it?\"\n\nThe man leaned in closer, his breath hot and rank. \"A quarter.\"\n\nIt was a ridiculous price, but I wanted to be friendly, so I handed him a quarter and a cup of coffee. He took it, and then he turned and walked out of the diner.\n\nIt was a cold winter night, and the man was dressed in a long, black coat and a wide, black hat.

Her own mother and father were trying to get to them, but they were stuck in the snow.  The mother looked at her daughter and her heart sank.  They had been here for hours and were still trying to dig out.  She could see the car they had driven in.  It was still here, half buried in the snow.

She tried to make the car go faster, but it wasn't working.  She saw her grandparents and the child in the window.  The mother was going to try to get out of the car and get to the house.  But she did not make it.\n\nThe mother got out of the car and started running to the house.  The snow was knee deep and she could not run.  She looked back at her car and saw the child still asleep.

We were all on edge, our nerves on high alert as the sky changed to a beautiful shade of pink and then quickly turned to a dark red. We were going to have another day of intense winds, and it was going to get intense. In the distance I saw a dark shape forming in the sky and my heart beat a little faster.\n\nThe last time I had seen something like that it was a hurricane that destroyed the entire city of New Atlantis. The winds were so strong that they picked up buildings and smashed them into each other. It was a nightmare. But we had been watching the moon of Titan for three hundred years and we had learned to see the shapes in the clouds as signs and omens.\n\nI looked up at the shape again and saw that it was getting bigger and bigger. It was getting clearer too. I could see that it was a massive storm cloud that was spinning and twirling in all directions. I was in awe of its power and beauty. It was like nothing I had ever seen before. The storm clouds on Titan were some of the most powerful in the solar system, but this one was different. This one was special.\n\nI called the elders and they came to see the storm cloud. They were all dressed in their best robes and we all stood in silence and watched the storm cloud. The elders saw the shape that I had pointed out and they knew that it was a sign that something big was about to happen.\n\n\"We should make a wish,\" said the elder.\n\n\"But to who?\" I asked.\n\n\"We don't have to wish it to anyone,\" said the elder. \"We just have to wish it to the universe. The universe will hear our wishes and make them come true.\"\n\nI looked at the storm cloud and knew that my wish was going to be special. I knew that it was going to be something big and important. I knew that I was going to ask for something that I had been dreaming about for a long time.\n\n\"What should I wish for?\" I asked the elder.\n\n\"You should wish for the power to make your wishes come true,\" said the elder.\n\n\"But that would be selfish,\" I said.\n\n\"You are not selfish if you want the power to make your wishes come true,\" said the elder. \"You just want to be able to make your wishes come true so that you can make a positive difference in the world.\"\n\nI looked at the storm cloud and knew that I was going to wish for the power to make my wishes come true. I was going to wish for the power to make the world a better place. I was going to wish for the power to make my dreams come true.\n\n\"I wish for the power to make my wishes come true,\" I said.\n\nThe elders looked at me and smiled. They knew that I had made a wish that was going to be special. They knew that my wish was going to be something big and important.\n\n\"We will do a ceremony to make sure that your wish comes true,\" said the elder.\n\n\"We will do the ceremony tonight,\" said the elder. \"We will go to the temple and do the ceremony. We will sing and dance and make music. We will ask the universe to hear our wishes and make them come true.\"\n\nI was excited to do the ceremony.

        "pred_story": "\"I think so, my dear demoness,\" I replied, my voice shaking. I was a mere mortal, after all, and one of the most powerful demonesses of the underworld had just summoned me to aid her in claiming the throne of her former kingdom. The demoness was a queen who had ruled over a land of darkness and fire, and she had been deposed four hundred years ago by a group of humans. \n\n\"Well, tell me, human, did Shakespeare write a play about a great battle between a wizard and a dragon?\" she asked, her eyes gleaming with excitement. I swallowed hard, my mind racing as I tried to think of the answer. \n\n\"I think you may be confusing him with Tolkien,\" I said, trying to sound confident. \"But I can try to find out for you.\" The demoness scowled, clearly unhappy with my response, but then she nodded and I took that as a sign to go. \n\nAs I made my way to the nearest library, I could feel the demoness's eyes on me, watching me, and I shivered. I had always thought of demons as being a bit scary, but this one was in a whole different league. \n\nI managed to find a library that was still open, and after a few minutes of searching, I found the answer to the demoness's question. Shakespeare had written a play called \"Macbeth\", which was a story about a Scottish king who murdered his way to the throne with the help of a group of witches. \n\n\"Ah ha!\" I exclaimed as I read the play's plot summary. \"Macbeth is about a king who kills his way to the throne with the help of witches!\" The demoness scowled again, clearly unimpressed with my answer. \n\n\"I told you, human, it was about a wizard and a dragon!\" she exclaimed. \"You're useless!\" She raised her hand, and a blast of fire shot towards me. I barely dodged out of the way in time, and I heard the demoness laugh. \n\n\"Fine, human,\" she said. \"You're no use to me. You'll be the one who helps me kill my enemies.\" She turned to leave, and I stood there, frozen in fear. \n\n\"Wait!\" I cried, and the demoness turned back to me. \n\n\"What?\" she asked, her eyes gleaming with malice. \n\n\"Can I ask you a question?\" I asked, trying to think of something, anything, that might save my life. \n\n\"Ah ha!\" she exclaimed. \"You think you're clever, don't you, human?\" I nodded, and the demoness laughed again. \n\n\"Go on,\" she said. \"Ask your question.\" I took a deep breath and asked, \"What's the worst thing you've ever done?\" \n\nThe demoness looked at me with surprise, and for a moment, I thought I had misjudged her. \n\n\"Ah,\" she said, and then she began to laugh. \n\n\"Oh, human, the worst thing I've ever done? You want to know the worst thing I've ever done?\" I nodded, and she grinned at me. \n\n\"Ah ha!\" she exclaimed, and I felt a surge of fear. \n\n\"Fine,\" I said, trying to sound brave. \n\n\"I've killed,\" she said, and I swallowed hard. \n\n\"Many people,\" she continued. \n\n\"Over the course of centuries,\" she went on. \n\n\"And I've tortured,\" she said, and I felt a cold shiver run down my spine. \n\n\"And I've manipulated,\" she said, and I felt a wave of despair wash over me. \n\n\"And I've deceived,\" she said, and I felt a cold dread settle over me. \n\n\"Oh, and I've done many other terrible things,\" she said, and I felt a cold fear grip me. \n\n\"But the worst thing I've ever done?\" she asked, and I swallowed hard. \n\n\"I killed my sister,\" she said, and I felt a wave of horror wash over me. \n\nI couldn't believe what I was hearing. \n\n\"You killed your sister?\" I asked, and the demoness nodded. \n\n\"Yes,\" she said, and I felt a wave of sadness wash over me. \n\n\"But why?\" I asked, and the demoness looked at me with surprise. \n\n\"Why?\" she repeated, and I nodded. \n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \n\n\"Ah, because my sister was the one who had the right to rule the underworld,\" she said, and I felt a wave of sadness wash over me. \n\n\"And she had the power to banish me,\" she continued. \n\n\"So I killed her,\" she said, and I felt a cold shiver run down my spine. \n\n\"But I'm glad she's dead,\" she said, and I felt a wave of despair wash over me. \n\n\"Why?\" I asked, and the demoness looked at me with surprise. \n\n\"Why?\" she repeated, and I nodded. \n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \n\n\"Because I'm more powerful now,\" she said, and I felt a wave of fear grip me. \n\n\"Ah, but I still have to rule the underworld,\" she said, and I swallowed hard. \n\n\"But I'm glad she's dead,\" she said, and I felt a wave of despair wash over me. \n\nThe demoness scowled at me, and I felt a surge of fear. \n\n\"Tell me, human, are you glad she's dead?\" she asked, and I swallowed hard. \n\n\"No,\" I said, and the demoness laughed. \n\n\"Ah, you think you're clever, don't you, human?\" she exclaimed, and I felt a wave of fear wash over me. \n\n\"You're not like me,\" she said, and I swallowed hard. \n\n\"You have a conscience,\" she said, and I felt a wave of sadness wash over me. \n\n\"But I'm still going to kill you,\" she said, and I felt a cold dread settle over me. \n\n\"And I'll make sure you're tormented for all eternity,\" she said, and I felt a wave of horror wash over me. \n\nI tried to run, but the demoness was too quick. She grabbed me and held me in place, and I felt her cold breath on the back of my neck. \n\n\"Tell me, human,\" she said, and I swallowed hard. \n\n\"What do you want to know?\" I asked, and the demoness laughed. \n\n\"Ah, but I know everything,\" she said, and I felt a wave of fear grip me. \n\n\"You can't know everything,\" I said, and the demoness looked at me with surprise. \n\n\"Why not?\" she asked, and I swallowed hard. \n\n\"Because there's something you don't know,\" I said, and the demoness looked at me with surprise. \n\n\"What is it?\" she asked, and I swallowed hard. \n\n\"But you have to guess,\" I said, and the demoness looked at me with surprise. \n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked, and I swallowed hard. \n\n\"It's a game,\" I said, and the demoness looked at me with surprise. \n\n\"What game?\" she asked, and I swallowed hard. \n\n\"I don't know,\" I said,"

It had been a long day at the office, and I couldn\u2019t wait to just kick back and relax in my apartment. I wasn\u2019t sure what time it was, but I could see the sun going down over the horizon. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I saw a sunset. I think it was sometime in November.\n\nI was only a few blocks away, and I was looking forward to sitting down and enjoying a nice meal. I saw the entrance to the apartment building, and I thought I was home free. But then I saw it. It looked like a huge spaceship, hovering over the roof of my apartment building. I rubbed my eyes, hoping that it would go away. But it was still there. I rubbed my eyes again, hoping it was some sort of trick of the eye. But it was still there.\n\nI was getting nervous now. I wondered if I was hallucinating from all the long days I had been working. I had been working on my final project, and I was so close to finishing it. I was hoping to be able to get a job after graduation, but with all the craziness of the world, I wasn\u2019t sure if I would be able to find one. I thought that maybe I could get a job doing something related to my major, but I was starting to lose hope.\n\nI looked up at the spaceship, and I could see the windows looking down on me. I felt like I was under a microscope. I could hear voices and footsteps. I was getting scared now. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nSuddenly, a voice spoke to me. \u201cHello. Are you the human who was walking by the building?\u201d\n\nI looked around, and then I saw a figure coming towards me. It was a tall alien with six arms and four eyes. I didn\u2019t know what to say.\n\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m the human you\u2019re talking to. But what do you want?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to come with us. You have a very important role to play in our council.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat council? What do you need me for?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYou will be speaking to our council about the safety of humanity. You will be speaking on their behalf.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? How am I supposed to do that?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThere will be three people to speak on behalf of humanity. You will be arguing to convince the council to not destroy humanity. This is a very serious situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this. I\u2019m not even a politician. I don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will be doing just fine. You have been selected for your unique perspective. You will be able to speak in a way that is not common among politicians. Just use your words and your voice. You will be doing great.\u201d\n\nI looked up at the alien and nodded. I could see the sincerity in its eyes. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m ready. I know that I\u2019m not qualified for this, but I will do my best.\u201d\n\nThe alien smiled and nodded. \u201cI will take you to meet the rest of the speakers. Then we will all go to the council meeting together.\u201d\n\nI nodded again, and the alien grabbed my arm. I felt a strange sensation, and then we were suddenly transported into the spaceship.\n\nI looked around and saw a hallway with many doors. The alien led me to a room with three people in it. There was a black man, a white woman, and an Asian man. They all turned to look at me.\n\n\u201cHi. I\u2019m glad to meet you,\u201d I said.\n\nThe black man smiled and nodded. \u201cHello. I\u2019m John. This is Sarah, and that\u2019s David.\u201d\n\nThe white woman smiled and nodded. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Sarah. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d\n\nThe Asian man nodded and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m David. Nice to meet you.\u201d\n\nThe alien spoke up. \u201cNow, let\u2019s get you all dressed up and ready for the council meeting.\u201d\n\nI looked at the alien and then looked at the three people in front of me. \u201cWhat are we going to wear?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWe will be wearing traditional council robes. It will be a nice, simple outfit. You will all look good.\u201d\n\nI looked at the three people in front of me and saw them nodding. I nodded and smiled.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get going.\u201d\n\nThe alien led us to a room filled with all sorts of strange and fantastical clothing. There were robes with intricate designs, robes with strange patterns, and even robes with animals sewn into them. I looked at the three people in front of me and saw them looking at the clothes.\n\n\u201cWhich one should we wear?\u201d John asked.\n\n\u201cI think we should wear the red one. It will make us stand out,\u201d I said.\n\nSarah looked at me and smiled. \u201cI like that idea. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d\n\nDavid nodded and smiled. \u201cI agree. Let\u2019s wear the red one.\u201d\n\nThe alien looked at us and nodded. \u201cYou all look nice. Now let\u2019s get ready.\u201d\n\nThe alien led us to a room filled with strange and fantastical haircuts. There was one with a long beard, one with a short beard, one with a shaven head, and even one with no hair at all. I looked at the three people in front of me and saw them looking at the haircuts.\n\n\u201cWhich one should we get?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI think we should all get the long beard. It will make us look more distinguished,\u201d John said.\n\nSarah nodded and smiled. \u201cI like that idea. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d\n\nDavid nodded and smiled. \u201cI agree. Let\u2019s get the long beard.\u201d\n\nThe alien looked at us and nodded. \u201cYou all look nice. Now let\u2019s go to the council meeting.\u201d\n\nThe alien led us to a room filled with many strange and fantastical chairs. There was one that looked like a throne, one that looked like a stool, and even one that looked like a swing. I looked at the three people in front of me and saw them looking at the chairs.\n\n\u201cWhich one should we sit in?\u201d David asked.\n\n\u201cI think we should sit in the throne. It will make us look more authoritative,\u201d I said.\n\nSarah nodded and smiled. \u201cI like that idea. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d\n\nJohn nodded and smiled. \u201cI agree. Let\u2019s sit in the throne.\u201d\n\nThe alien looked at us and nodded. \u201cYou all look nice. Now let\u2019s go to the council meeting.\u201d\n\nThe alien led us to a room filled with many strange and fantastical tables. There was one with a big sign that read \u201cCouncil Meeting\u201d, one with a big sign that read \u201cHumanity\u2019s Fate\u201d, and even one with a big sign that read \u201cThe End\u201d. I looked at the three people in front of me and saw them looking at the tables.\n\n\u201cWhich one should we use?\u201d Sarah asked.\n\n\u201cI think we should use the one that reads \u2018Council Meeting\u2019. It will make us feel more official,\u201d David said"

        "pred_story": "\"Ah, finally awake,\" said the one man in the room with a face that did not scream \"archaeologist\" more than the others. The other five people in the room were all of Asian and African descent and were all dressed in various forms of modern clothing and were surrounded by tables covered in an assortment of tools and oddities. I was a pale white man with long blonde hair and a face with a prominent nose, and it was a bit odd compared to the people around me.\n\n\"How long was I frozen?\" I asked, trying to look at the man but not being able to. I was in a coffin shaped container that was filled with what looked like a thick layer of white ice, except it was frozen carbon dioxide. That was how cryogenic freezing worked, was it not? My memories of it was vague, but I knew I had to have some of it.\n\n\"Almost four hundred years, I believe,\" said the man in a way that I could tell was an attempt to lighten the mood. \"You must be quite old.\"\n\nI groaned, feeling a slight pain in my head. It was a result of not being able to move in almost four hundred years, I could tell. \"How long was I frozen? How was I found?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the man. \"You were frozen in a cave. It was a very dry cave, which is how we were able to find you. The ice was still holding you. A team of scientists was examining it when they found you. They were trying to figure out who you were and how you came to be there.\"\n\nI groaned again, feeling my head pound harder than before. \"What did they find?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" said the man. \"I'm not the one who discovered you. I'm the one who was assigned to study you and make sure you stay in one piece until we could figure out what to do with you.\"\n\nI groaned again, feeling my head pound harder than before. \"So, they don't know who I am or how I came to be here?\"\n\n\"No, they do not,\" said the man. \"They are still trying to figure it out.\"\n\nI groaned again, feeling my head pound harder than before. \"I think I need some water. Is it possible to have some water?\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe it is,\" said the man. \"Let me see if we can find some.\" He turned around and walked away, and I looked around me. The room was small, with a low ceiling. It was filled with various tools and oddities, including a few that looked like they might be useful. There was a hammer, a chisel, and a few other things that I did not recognize.\n\nThe man returned with a small glass of water. \"Here you are,\" he said, handing it to me. I took it and raised it to my lips. The water was cool and refreshing, and I was able to quench my thirst. I then handed the glass back to the man, who took it and set it on a table.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said, and I was able to look around the room again. The people in the room were all still staring at me, and I could see that they were all still trying to figure out who I was and how I came to be here. They seemed to be trying to figure out what I was, as well. They were all looking at me like I was some kind of animal.\n\n\"Can I get out of here?\" I asked, looking at the man. \"I would like to take a walk around the city.\"\n\nThe man hesitated for a moment before nodding. \"Yes, I believe that is possible. But let me warn you, you are not dressed for it.\"\n\nI looked down at myself and saw that I was wearing a pair of short pants and a sleeveless shirt. I was also wearing a pair of sandals on my feet. I had no shoes, so it was not a problem. \"I will be fine,\" I said. \"Thank you for getting me out of that container.\"\n\nThe man nodded. \"I'm glad to do it. Let me see if I can get a set of clothes for you.\"\n\nI nodded and looked around the room again. The people were all still staring at me, and I could see that they were all still trying to figure out who I was and how I came to be here. They seemed to be trying to figure out what I was, as well.

The way she stared at him, her fingers drumming the armrest of the chair, he could feel the power emanating from her like a heat haze.\n\nHe'd been foolish, he knew, to think that they would settle on a simple name swap. He'd spent years learning about her people, how they operated, but this was a different form of power. One that she had mastered.\n\n\"My dear,\" she said, her voice dripping with amusement, \"I think it's time we discussed what this marriage will entail.\"\n\nShe was beautiful, he was struck by the thought. Her skin was a shimmering blue, her hair a wild tangle of gold. Her eyes, however, were the most striking of all. They seemed to draw the light around them, to hold it in a way that seemed almost supernatural.\n\n\"I think that's a good idea,\" he said, trying to keep his voice steady. He'd never been one for the supernatural, but he'd always known that her people were a different breed. Something between magic and myth. He couldn't wait to see what it was like to have a wife with real magic.\n\n\"Excellent,\" she said, her fingers drumming the armrest of the chair once more. She raised her hand, and the room seemed to darken. The air seemed to thicken, to become more humid, and he could feel the power emanating from her like a palpable force.\n\n\"You see,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper, \"this is what it means to be a faerie. This is the power that you have agreed to give me.\"\n\nAnd with that, the room seemed to shatter around him. He felt himself being pulled towards her, being drawn into some kind of vortex. He felt his name being torn from him, being given to her in exchange for her magic.\n\n\"I don't know what to say,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\"You don't have to say anything,\" she said, her voice dripping with amusement. \"Just go. Just leave and never look back.\"\n\nHe didn't need telling. He knew that he would be better off without this kind of power. He'd been foolish to think that he could handle it.

I just saw you walk out the door and I was going to ask you what you were doing.\u201d  I looked at my friend, surprised that he was still up.\n\n\u201cNothing, I just need some fresh air. Want to come with me?\u201d  He nodded, so we both headed outside. It was a great day. The sun was shining, the birds were singing, and I was feeling great. I knew that everything was going to be alright.\n\nI just looked at my friend, wondering what he was thinking.\n\n\u201cDude, I don\u2019t get it. You\u2019re always so happy lately, and it\u2019s not because of a girl. You know I\u2019d know if there was a girl, right? And you\u2019re not smoking pot. I know that too. So what\u2019s your secret?\u201d  I shook my head. \u201cI just feel good, that\u2019s all. I\u2019ve just found a new purpose in life. I\u2019m happy for me and my family. I feel blessed to have found the things I\u2019ve found. I want to help people, and I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d  He looked at me for a moment before he nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome, dude. That\u2019s awesome. I\u2019m happy for you.\u201d\n\nWe walked for a while before we finally stopped and looked at a sign. \u201cDude, what does that sign say?\u201d  I looked at it and then smiled.\n\n\u201cWe are here.\u201d  He looked at me and shook his head. \u201cDude, this is your secret? This is your purpose in life?\u201d  I looked at him, confused.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? We are here to help people. We are here to make a difference. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying.\u201d  He shook his head, confused. \u201cDude, this is a gas station. This is the only thing you can say to me? This is the only reason you\u2019ve been so happy lately? This gas station?\u201d  I looked at him and shrugged. \u201cOkay. I guess so.\u201d  He looked at me and shook his head.\n\n\u201cDude, I don\u2019t know what to say. I don\u2019t know what to think. This is what you\u2019ve been faking all this time?\u201d  I looked at him and shook my head.\n\n\u201cDude, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know how to say it. I didn\u2019t know how to explain it. I didn\u2019t know how to tell you. I thought you would understand.\u201d  He looked at me for a moment and then shook his head.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, dude. I don\u2019t know how to react. But for my sake, you can\u2019t tell anyone what you just told me. Can you do that for me?\u201d  I nodded, then looked at my friend.\n\n\u201cThanks, dude. You\u2019re my best friend.\u201d  He looked at me and smiled. \u201cI love you, dude.\u201d  I nodded, and we hugged each other tightly."

        "pred_story": "You are in a dining hall filled with all sorts of fae food you can imagine (but also none of it is edible), with the fae trying to convince you to eat with them. This has gone on for a while now, with your stomach getting emptier and emptier. The fae is starting to get frustrated because they are not getting what they are looking for (namely your death). To convince you to eat, the fae has made a bet with a demon, and the demon has promised them a great reward. However, the demon has also placed a curse on the fae, causing them to be extremely frustrated, angry, and hostile (all at the same time). You notice the fae has a green tinge to their skin, and their eyes look like they are going to pop out of their head. You also notice their teeth are turning a dark gray.\n\nThe fae looks around the room and sees that the tables are empty, but there are a few tables with food on them. They point at one of the tables with a chicken dish on it and say, \"Would you like to eat chicken?\" You look at the dish and see that the chicken is gray and moldy, and the sauce that covers the dish is a bright red and appears to be bubbling. You don't know if this is the work of the curse or not.\n\nThe fae notices that you are staring at the dish and says, \"What? Is it okay? I made it myself, and I can assure you it is delicious!\" You try to ask the fae how they made it, but they are not listening. You try to ask again, and they turn to you, but the moment they see your face, they go back to staring at the table. You try to get their attention again, but they won't look at you. You decide to try to get the fae's attention by standing up. They turn around, but their eyes are a bright red, and they're glowing. They can't focus on you.\n\nYou try to get their attention again by waving your hand in front of their face. They start to sneer at you, but their eyes don't change color. They start to get closer to you, their mouth open and revealing their dark gray teeth. You start to step away from them, but they get closer and closer. You start to feel scared, and your heart starts to beat faster.\n\nYou try to get their attention again by saying your name. They stop in front of you, their eyes still glowing red. They look at you, but they don't see you. You try to get their attention again by saying, \"It's okay. I don't want to eat the chicken.\" They look at you again, but their eyes are still glowing red. They start to speak, but all that comes out is, \"EAT... THE... CHICKEN... NOW.\"\n\nYou start to get scared and try to run, but the tables and chairs are moving around you. You can't find a way out, and the fae are closing in on you. You start to feel trapped and scared. The fae are all around you, their eyes glowing red, and their mouths open and revealing their dark gray teeth. They start to speak again, but all that comes out is, \"EAT... THE... CHICKEN... NOW.\" They are saying it in a low tone, but you can hear it in your mind. You start to feel your mind going numb.\n\nThe fae are moving closer and closer, their eyes still glowing red, and their mouths still open and revealing their dark gray teeth.

The fae are all around you, their eyes glowing red, and their mouths still open and revealing their dark gray teeth.\n\nYou feel a hand on your shoulder and hear a voice whispering in your ear. The voice is soft and gentle, and it is saying, \"I think it's time for me to step in, don't you?\" You turn around, but there is no one there. You try to move away, but you can't.

You feel a second hand on your shoulder, and the voice says, \"I'm here to help you.\"\n\nThe fae are still closing in on you, but they seem to be slowing down.

The street was dark and quiet, the neon lights of the shops flickering in the stillness.\n\n\"Right. Well. Come on in. I'm just waiting for my partner to get here.\"\n\nHe led her into the apartment, moving stiffly, and motioning to the couch. \"Have a seat.

She was a good woman, and I miss her every day.\"\n\nHe looked at her, and she saw a glimmer of pain in his eyes. \"Sorry, kiddo. I know this isn't my fault, but I'll be honest with you, sometimes I feel guilty about it. Like if I'd done something different, she'd still be alive.\"\n\nShe nodded, and he looked away, clearing his throat. \"I'm sorry. That wasn't your question. Sorry.\"\n\nShe smiled, shaking her head. \"It's alright. I think we're all guilty of something. So, is there anything you'd like to share about the case?\"\n\nHe hesitated for a moment, and she thought she saw him glance at the window, as if looking out for his partner.\n\n\"Yes. It's a tough one. This case, I mean. But I'm not sure it's even related to what's been going on. But I suppose that's for you to decide.\"\n\nHe leaned forward, and she leaned in, as if ready to listen.\n\n\"You see, I've been working on this case, and I think I know what's going on. But it's not something I want to talk about. Not now, anyway.\"\n\nHe stopped, and she looked at him, her eyes wide. \"What?\"\n\nHe shrugged, looking away. \"I'm not ready to talk about it yet. But I will. Eventually.\"\n\nShe smiled, and he looked back at her, a glimmer of surprise in his eyes.\n\n\"Oh, you want to give up? You want to quit? Yeah, well, too bad, kiddo. In this line of work, you don't get to retire. You keep going until you drop dead, because innocent people die screaming if you don't.\" He stood up, and she followed suit.\n\n\"And that's all I can say, kiddo. I'm sorry if I scared you, but I just wanted you to understand. This is what I do. I fight for justice, no matter the cost.\"\n\nHe looked at her, his eyes cold and hard.\n\n\"You're not like the others, kiddo. You're not like the others. I can see that. But I'll tell you something. If you ever need help, you can call me. I'll be there for you. In this line of work, we don't have much, but we have each other. And that's what keeps me going.\"\n\nHe nodded, and she nodded back. \"Thank you.\"\n\nHe smiled, and she saw the first glimmer of warmth in his eyes since he'd sat down.\n\n\"I'll be in touch, kiddo. Take care of yourself, and remember, if you ever need help, I'll be there for you.\"\n\nHe opened the door, and she followed him out. She turned to look back at the apartment, and saw him standing in the doorway, looking at her with a faint smile on his face.\n\n\"I'll be there for you,\" he said, his voice low.\n\nAnd with that, he closed the door and disappeared into the darkness of the night."

I had been to this market before and had seen all of the vendors selling their goods. Today, I was on a mission to find the vendor that sold the rarest of items. The item I was looking for was a silver locket with a small image of a rose inside. I had seen it before, but the vendor had been too scared to sell it to me.\n\nI had finally found it again, and I was determined to get it. I had asked the vendor how much it was, but the price was too high for me to afford. I had asked the vendor if they would give it to me for cheap, and they had looked at me strangely. They had said that they had already asked for a high price and that they had already set the price in stone. I had asked them how I could pay for it without using any coins. They had told me that they only accepted gold and that I was stupid for thinking that the price would be cheap.\n\nI had asked the vendor if they would sell it to me without me paying. They had looked at me like I was crazy and had told me that if I wanted to pay with something else, I would have to ask the king. I had asked the vendor if they would sell it to me if I helped them with their work. They had looked at me like I was crazy again and had told me that they didn't need help with their work. They had told me that if I wanted to pay with something else, I would have to ask the king and that I would have to come with me to the castle.\n\nI had been to the castle many times before and had met the king. The king had always been friendly and had helped me with my requests. I had asked the king if I could sell my sword to the kingdom and he had agreed. I had asked the king if I could use the money to pay for the locket and he had agreed.

He had asked me why I wanted the locket and I had told him about the rose. He had told me that the locket was a gift from the king of the elves and that it was a symbol of good luck. He had told me that the rose was a symbol of love and that I should have a love that would help me with my life.\n\nThe king had asked me if I had a love and I had told him that I didn't. He had told me that he would help me find a love that would help me with my life. I had asked him what he meant and he had told me that he would find a love that would help me with my life. I had asked him how he would find a love and he had told me that he would find a love that would help me with my life.\n\nI had asked the vendor how much it was and they had told me that it was still 100 gold.

I am a Siren.\n\n\"I am a Siren,\" I told my mother when I first discovered that I was a Siren. My mother, then just a young girl herself, had been taken by a monster from her village, taken to our island in the middle of nowhere. She would grow up to be a Siren, as I would. We would both be forced into a life of singing to the monsters. We were their daughters, their mothers, their children. \n\nI would grow up to be the Siren that sang for the Sea Dragons, the ones with the shells that protect their backs. My mother, on the other hand, would be the Siren that sang for the Serpents of the land. \n\n\"We'll be married,\" she told me, a smile on her face. \"I'll be your mother, you'll be my daughter.\"\n\nI nodded.\n\nI was young, and stupid, and naive, and I believed her.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nAs I grew older, I learned that my mother was taken as a child from her village. She grew up with our father, one of the many monsters that lived on our island. I would become her child, taken from my village as a child. \n\nI would become a Siren.\n\nI would grow up to be a Siren that sings for monsters.\n\nAnd monsters that sing back.\n\n\"Who is it?\" I ask, staring out into the dark night, listening for the sound of music that comes from the cave just below the rock. My mother is out of the house, gone for the night to finish her work as a Siren. I'm on my own, alone in our small cottage, with the sound of music echoing through the night.\n\nIt's the first time that I've heard the sound of music from the cave in my life.\n\n\"Who is it?\" I repeat, turning to face the figure that stands before me. He's tall, and lean, with a strong jaw and piercing blue eyes. His hair is dark and messy, and a few strands fall across his face. He's a monster, but not one that I recognize. Not one that I'd expect to hear music from the cave.\n\nThe music has stopped.\n\n\"Who is it?\" I repeat, again turning to face the figure that stands before me.\n\nThe figure blinks, and takes a step back. He's nervous, and it's cute.\n\n\"Who is it?\" I repeat, again turning to face the figure that stands before me.\n\n\"Who?\" I repeat, again turning to face the figure that stands before me. \"I asked first.\"\n\nThe figure blinks, and then answers. \"I'm the one that you've been hearing music from. I'm the one that's been singing to you.\"\n\nI nod. \"I know that.\"\n\n\"Then why are you looking at me like that?\" he asks, looking at me with a confused look on his face.\n\nI shrug. \"I've never heard you before.\"\n\nHe nods, and takes another step back. \"I know.\"\n\n\"I mean, I've been a Siren for a long time. I've been singing for monsters for a long time. But never for a monster that sings back.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" he says. \"I didn't mean to startle you.\"\n\nHe takes another step back, and I follow him. We walk to the side of the cave, to the edge of the rock, and I turn to face him.\n\n\"Sorry,\" I say. \"I didn't mean to be startled either.\"\n\nHe nods. \"You're not startled anymore, I guess.\"\n\nI nod, and then look out into the night. The music that I've heard is still echoing in my mind, but it's not as loud as it was. It's still beautiful, but it's not as loud as it was.\n\n\"How did you learn to sing?\" I ask him.\n\nHe thinks for a moment. \"I learned to sing from my mother.\"\n\n\"That's good,\" I say. \"I'm glad that you have a singing mother.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" he says. \"She taught me how to sing for the dragons.\"\n\n\"The dragons?\" I repeat. \"The Sea Dragons?\"\n\nHe nods. \"Yes. They're the most beautiful creatures in the world.\"\n\nI nod, and then look out into the night. The music that I've heard is still echoing in my mind, but it's not as loud as it was. It's still beautiful, but it's not as loud as it was.\n\n\"And you sang to them?\" I ask him.\n\nHe nods. \"I sang to them for years. I sang to them every day. And they listened.\"\n\nI nod. \"They listened, and they liked what they heard. They liked the way you sang.\"\n\nHe nods. \"I think they did. I think they really liked the way I sang.\"\n\nI nod, and then look out into the night. The music that I've heard is still echoing in my mind, but it's not as loud as it was. It's still beautiful, but it's not as loud as it was.\n\n\"You sang to them,\" I repeat. \"You sang to them, and they listened.\"\n\nHe nods. \"Yes. They listened.\"\n\nI look at him, and he looks back at me. \"But you're not singing to them now,\" I say. \"You're singing to me.\"\n\nHe nods. \"I'm singing to you now.\"\n\nI look out into the night, and then back at him. \"Why?\" I ask him. \"Why are you singing to me?\"\n\nHe thinks for a moment. \"I like your music,\" he says. \"I like the way you sing.\"\n\n"

        "pred_story": "\"I never saw that coming!\" I exclaimed. \"I thought I was safe as a vampire.\" I was a tall, lean creature with long black hair that fell to my shoulders, and pale skin that shone like the moon. I wore a black leather jacket over a white shirt, and my fangs gleamed in my mouth. \n\n\"My name is Sarah, by the way,\" the ghost said, taking a deep breath. \"I'm stuck with you now. You killed me.\"\n\nI sighed. \"I didn't mean to, I swear.\"\n\nSarah glared at me. \"What do you mean you didn't mean to? You bit me and sucked my blood. Now I'm stuck with you until you die. You might be immortal, but I'm not. And I don't want to be a vampire.\"\n\nI shrugged. \"I suppose I can try to kill myself.\" I couldn't do that, I would survive somehow, but I could try to give up being a vampire, which might mean getting rid of the powers that came with it. I couldn't be sure, but it was worth a shot.\n\nSarah nodded. \"Thank you.\"\n\nWe were in my apartment, on the couch. I wasn't sure how she got there, I could've sworn she was on her way out the door, but I guess I didn't notice her at the time. I sighed again.\n\n\"Can I ask why you're stuck with me?\"\n\nSarah shrugged. \"I suppose it's because we were close, but not too close. You didn't know me too well, so you can't quite remember our relationship. It makes it hard for me to leave.\"\n\nI nodded. \"Sorry about that.\"\n\nSarah shook her head. \"I'm not sorry, I'm furious. But you're a bit of an idiot, so I'll let it slide.\" She crossed her arms and glared at me.\n\nI sighed. \"Look, I'm sorry about everything. I never meant to hurt you, or anyone else.\"\n\nSarah shrugged. \"I know you didn't. But that's no excuse. You're a creature of the night, and you've killed someone. You have to live with the consequences.\"\n\nI sighed again, looking at the floor. I wasn't sure what to do. I'd tried to be a good person, but I'd made mistakes. I knew that I had a long way to go, but I'd never thought that I'd be stuck with a ghost for the rest of my immortal life.\n\nSarah stood up, and walked to the kitchen, opening the fridge and pulling out a carton of orange juice. She poured some into a glass, and then turned to me.\n\n\"I'm not drinking,\" I said, shaking my head.\n\nSarah shrugged. \"Fine. But can you do me a favor?\"\n\nI nodded. \"What is it?\"\n\nSarah opened a drawer and pulled out a pen and a notebook, writing something down and then handing me the paper.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked, looking at the paper.\n\nSarah shrugged. \"Just a list of things I want you to do. If you follow the list, I might forgive you for killing me.\" She sighed and looked at the floor. \"I know you didn't mean to, but it's hard to forget someone is dead. And I know I'm stuck with you, but I want to be happy.\"\n\nI sighed, looking at the paper. The list was long, and I knew I'd have a lot of work to do. But I was willing to do it if it meant making Sarah happy. I nodded, looking up at her.\n\nShe smiled. \"Thanks.\"\n\nI stood up, and Sarah and I sat down on the couch, looking at the paper together. We looked at the list, and then looked at each other.\n\n\"What do you say we get started?\" I asked.\n\nSarah nodded, and we looked at the first item on the list, and got to work."

My mom's a vampire. She's a hundred and ninety years old.\"\n\n\"I know, right? It's so weird. I've always felt like there was something missing about me, like a part of me that I couldn't quite explain. Then I found out about my mom. I know, it sounds crazy. I was thinking I was going to just get it over with and tell you everything, but I guess that's not going to happen now.\"\n\n\"Well, that's just great. Of course you had to pick someone like me. I'm the only person who still doesn't know that I'm going to die. I mean, the only other person I know who doesn't know that I'm going to die is my mom, and she's a vampire. That's not exactly comforting. So you're telling me that your mom's a vampire, and she's going to come and kill me?\"\n\n\"I told you I was going to do it in person. I'm really sorry that you're upset. I didn't want you to find out like that. I was going to go up to you and tell you that I'm leaving, but it seems like the only other thing that I could do in this situation is tell you that my mom's a vampire, and she's going to kill you. I hope that you can understand my reasoning. I know it's not an easy thing to hear, but I had to do it. You're not going to believe me, but I was going to tell you that I'm leaving anyway, and the reason I'm telling you that now is so that you can tell your mom about me. I know it's weird, but I really need to get out of here before she finds out that I told you about this.\"\n\n\"Your mom? You're really telling me to go and tell your mom about you leaving? You're going to die, and you want me to go and tell your mom about you leaving? I mean, I know that you're going to die, but your mom's a vampire! She's going to eat you! And I'm going to go tell her about you leaving? It doesn't make any sense.\"\n\n\"You're going to be angry. I know you're going to be angry, but I had to do this. I'm really sorry, I know that it's not going to be easy. I know you're going to tell your mom about me leaving, but you're going to tell her that I'm a hundred and ninety years old. She'll be so happy! And the rest is just, well, a myth. You'll know that the rest is true, though. I know it's going to be hard, but please do this for me. Please tell your mom about me leaving, and please tell her that I'm a hundred and ninety years old. Please do this for me. It will mean so much to me. Please tell her about me leaving, and please tell her that I'm a hundred and ninety years old. I know you will. Thank you. It means so much to me.\" \n\n\"Hey, wait. I don't know how to even ask this, but...can I ask you something?\"\n\n\"Of course. I don't know what you're thinking, but I know I'm about to die, and I know that you're going to go and tell my mom about me leaving. I want to ask you something. If you're going to go and tell her about me leaving, and you're going to tell her that I'm a hundred and ninety years old, then why are you still sitting there?\"\n\n\"I'm still sitting here? I think I'm a bit confused. I think I got a bit turned around. I was sitting in the chair, and now I'm on the floor. I think I must have gotten up and gone over there, and then something happened and I ended up on the floor.\"\n\n\"Well, that's great. I'm glad that you're okay. Now that we've talked about me dying, and your mom coming and killing me, and you going to tell her about me leaving and that I'm a hundred and ninety years old, can you answer my question? Why are you still sitting there?\"\n\n\"Well, I think I'm going to die in a bit. I'm not sure how long I've got left. I'm pretty sure it's only going to be a few minutes, though.\"\n\n\"Well, that's great. Then my question is pointless.\"\n\n\"No, that's not true! You were going to ask me something, weren't you? You're still here, so you're not dead yet, and you're still here, so I think I'm still here, so I don't know what's going on. You were going to ask me something, weren't you?\"\n\n\"Of course I was going to ask you something! I was going to ask you if I could eat you. I mean, I know that you're going to die, but I was going to ask you if I could eat you. You know, before my mom comes and kills you.\"\n\n\"No, you can't eat me! You're my friend. You can't eat your friends!\"\n\n\"Oh, well. That's too bad. I was really looking forward to eating you. You're so delicious! I mean, you're not just delicious, though. You're my friend, too.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm glad that we're still friends. I was really worried about that. I was afraid that you were going to eat me.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! I'm not going to eat you. I'm just going to go and eat some food. It's okay. You're not going to die. I'm going to die. I know you're going to be angry with me, but I have to eat something. You're not going to die. I know you're going to be angry, but I have to eat. I'm going to die, but you're not going to die. You're going to be happy that I'm dying, and you're not going to be happy that I'm eating food. You're going to be happy that I'm dying, but you're not going to be happy that I'm eating food. You're going to"

starting to feel like I was losing my mind.\u00a0 This was my third mission.\u00a0 I was used to being on the ship a lot longer than the humans.\u00a0 I was the one that would take the crew to get resupplied, as I was the only one that could use the ship while the humans were gone.\u00a0 But with each new mission, it seemed like there was another new googly eye on the ship.\n\nI had asked one of the crew members why they did it, but they just said \"because\".\u00a0 I asked another, but she just smiled and said \"because, why not?\"\u00a0 This was starting to drive me crazy.\u00a0 I was starting to think that the humans were going crazy.\n\nI had even started to think that maybe it was something that the humans needed.\u00a0 Maybe they needed something silly like googly eyes to stay sane.\u00a0 But I couldn't shake the feeling that this was something more sinister.\n\nFinally, I couldn't take it anymore.\u00a0 I was the one that would have to fix the ship's engines, and I was not going to do it with googly eyes all over the place.\u00a0 I went into the room where all the googly eyes were kept and started to gather them all up.\u00a0 I couldn't believe the amount of googly eyes that were there.\u00a0 There were thousands of them.\u00a0 I couldn't even imagine how many it would take to put them all on the ship.\n\nI was getting frustrated, so I decided to do it myself.\u00a0 I started to put googly eyes on everything, even the walls.\u00a0 I was making a mess, but I didn't care.\u00a0 I was just trying to have some fun.\u00a0 I had been on so many missions, and I had always been the one to do the hard work, and now I was just tired of it.\n\nBut when I was done, and the ship was covered in googly eyes, I couldn't help but feel a little bit of pride.\u00a0 I had done it.\u00a0 I had finally put googly eyes on the entire ship.\u00a0 I went to look at the ship, and I couldn't help but laugh.\u00a0 The ship was covered in googly eyes.\u00a0 I was starting to feel a little bit of relief.\u00a0 Maybe all of this was good.\u00a0 Maybe the humans were right, and googly eyes were what kept them sane.\n\nBut just as I was starting to feel good, I saw a figure coming towards me.\u00a0 It was one of the crew members.\u00a0 But this was no ordinary crew member.\u00a0 This was the captain.\u00a0 She had a look of shock on her face, and she was holding up a small bag of googly eyes.\n\n\"Sir, what is going on here?\" she asked.\n\nI was taken aback by her question.\u00a0 \"What are you talking about?\u00a0 I'm just putting googly eyes on the ship.\" I replied.\n\nThe captain looked at me as if I was crazy.\u00a0 \"You're putting googly eyes on the entire ship?\u00a0 Sir, that's not right.\" She said.\n\nI looked at her, trying to see if she was joking.\u00a0 But she was dead serious.\u00a0 I was taken aback by her reaction.\n\n\"What's wrong with it?\u00a0 I was just trying to have some fun.\u00a0 I was tired of being on the ship all the time.\" I replied.\n\nThe captain looked at me, as if she was trying to understand why I would do something like that.\u00a0 But I could tell that she was getting frustrated.\n\n\"I don't know what's wrong with you.\u00a0 But you need to stop doing this.\u00a0 It's not normal for a ship to have googly eyes all over it.\" She said.\n\nI was starting to feel frustrated.\u00a0 \"I don't care about the ship.\u00a0 I care about the humans.\u00a0 They're the ones that are always putting googly eyes on the ship.\u00a0 I'm just trying to have some fun.\" I replied.\n\nThe captain looked at me, as if she was trying to understand.\u00a0 But I could tell that she was getting frustrated.\n\n\"I don't know what to do.\u00a0 I've never had a crew member do something like this before.\u00a0 I'm going to have to talk to the human ambassador.\" She said.\n\nI was starting to feel worried.\u00a0 I had never heard of the human ambassador.\u00a0 I had heard of the human ambassador of the planet we were on, but I had never heard of any other human ambassador.\u00a0 I was starting to feel worried about what would happen to me if the captain talked to the human ambassador.\n\nBut before anything else could happen, the captain stopped talking to me.\u00a0 She stopped moving, and she just stood there for a moment.\u00a0 Then she started to laugh.\n\nI was taken aback by her reaction.\u00a0 \"What's so funny?\" I asked.\n\nThe captain looked at me, as if she was surprised by my question.\u00a0 \"I was just thinking.\u00a0 If we're not going to get rid of the googly eyes, then we may as well make the entire ship look like a giant googly eyed robot.\u00a0 I love it.\" She said.\n\nI was shocked by her reaction.\u00a0 \"You love it?\u00a0 I was just trying to have some fun.\u00a0 I didn't mean to make the ship look like a giant googly eyed robot.\" I replied.\n\nThe captain smiled.\u00a0 \"Well, I think we can make it work.\u00a0 I think we can make it look like a giant googly eyed robot.\u00a0 And if we're lucky, we may even be able to sell it.\" She said.\n\nI was shocked by her reaction.\u00a0 \"Sell it?\u00a0 How are we going to sell it?\" I replied.\n\nThe captain looked at me, as if I was crazy.\u00a0 \"We're going to sell it to the humans, of course.\u00a0 We'll be able to sell it to them for a fortune.\u00a0 And we'll be able to keep the googly eyes.\u00a0 We'll be

humans and make a lot of money.\u00a0 And I think it's because we can keep the googly eyes.\u00a0 We'll be able to keep the whole ship like a giant googly eyed robot.\" She said.\n\nI was shocked by her reaction.\u00a0 \"I don't know what to say.\u00a0 But I'm happy to help.\u00a0 I'm happy to help sell the ship to the humans.\" I replied.\n\nThe captain smiled.\u00a0 \"I thought you'd see it my way.\u00a0 I'll make the calls to the humans.\u00a0 We'll be able to sell the ship to them for a fortune.\u00a0 And we'll be"

I was in a state of disbelief. \n\nI looked at the door as my mind attempted to process what was happening. The door slowly closed as I screamed. I could hear the heavy footsteps of the fallen angels walking towards me. Their chains clanked with every step. I was about to make my final statement to them but the door slammed shut and I heard the chain being put on the door. \n\nI was about to speak again but my eyes widened as I heard the voice of the devil. \u201cGoodbye!

        "pred_story": "As the rain soaked through my jacket and onto my chest, I gazed up at the sky, hoping that somehow, someway, it would magically part and the sun would break through.  It wasn't as if I wasn't used to this. I had been homeless for months.  I had grown accustomed to living on the streets.  But no matter how used to it I was, I still found myself hoping that this was the day things would turn around for me.\n\nI had been on the streets for so long, I had almost forgotten what a bed felt like.  I had almost forgotten what warm food tasted like.  I had almost forgotten what a shower felt like.  The only thing I still remembered was my name, and the only thing I still felt was loneliness.\n\nI was just another homeless person in a city of millions.  Nobody paid attention to me, and nobody seemed to care.  It was as if I was invisible.  I had long since stopped trying to find help.  It had gotten to the point where I was just trying to survive.\n\nBut today, on this particular rainy day, something caught my eye.  I was walking down the sidewalk, looking for a place to wait out the storm, when I saw a book lying on the ground.  It was a large book, easily as big as a small suitcase, and it was covered in strange symbols that looked like they were written in a language I had never seen before.\n\nDespite the rain, I walked over and picked it up.  It was a leather-bound book, and it was incredibly heavy.  I looked around, wondering who it could belong to, but I didn't see anyone around.  I picked it up again, and turned it over in my hands, trying to figure out what it was.  The symbols were still strange, but I could feel a strange energy emanating from it.  I didn't know what to do with it, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was meant to have it.\n\nI walked back to the sidewalk and looked at the book again.  This time, as I gazed at the symbols, I felt a strange tingling sensation in my fingers.  It was as if something was calling to me, urging me to open the book.  Without thinking, I opened the cover and found myself staring at a page filled with words.  But it wasn't like any language I had ever seen before.  The letters were unlike any letters I had ever seen before.  But despite this, I could somehow understand what it was saying.\n\nI read through the page, trying to make sense of what I was reading.  The text described a spell, one that was unlike anything I had ever seen before.  I read through it, my heart pounding in my chest, as I tried to make sense of what it was saying.  But the words didn't make sense.  They weren't words I had ever heard before.  But the more I read, the more I felt something inside of me stirring.\n\nI turned to the next page, and the one after that, reading through the text.  It was as if I had been reading a book my entire life.  I knew the words, but I had never seen them before.  I knew the concepts, but I had never understood them before.  But the more I read, the more I felt myself changing.\n\nI didn't notice anything out of the ordinary, but something in me felt different.  It was as if a part of me had been awakened, and it was stirring.  I didn't know what to make of it, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was happening.\n\nAs the storm raged on, I read through the pages of the book.  I read through the words, and I felt my mind expanding.  It was as if the words were unlocking doors in my mind, doors that I had never known existed.\n\nAnd as I read, I began to feel a strange sensation growing inside of me.  It was a sensation I couldn't explain, a sensation that was both exhilarating and terrifying.  But despite this, I couldn't stop reading.  I was drawn to the words, drawn to the concepts.  And as I read, I began to feel something building inside of me.\n\nIt was a sense of power, a sense of magic.  I didn't know what it was, but I could feel it.  I could feel it growing inside of me, growing stronger with every page I read.  And as I read, I felt myself changing.  I felt myself becoming something more.\n\nI turned to the final page, and I felt a surge of energy run through me.  I didn't know what to do, but I knew I had to try.  I raised my hands to the sky, and I felt a sudden jolt of energy run through me.  It was as if something inside of me had been unleashed, and it was pouring out of me in all directions.\n\nAnd as I stood there, I felt the energy coursing through me.  I felt the power growing inside of me, growing stronger with every second that passed.  And as I stood there, I felt something miraculous happen.  The storm around me began to clear, and the rain stopped falling.  The sun broke through the clouds, and I felt its warm rays on my skin.\n\nI stood there, looking up at the sky, feeling a sense of wonder that I had never felt before.  I had always known that there was something more out there, something that I couldn't quite reach.  But now, as I stood there, I knew that I had found it.\n\nI looked down at the book in my hand, and I knew that I would never let it go.  I knew that I would never be the same again.  And as I stood there, feeling the power coursing through me, I knew that I was ready for whatever came next.\n\nI was no longer just a homeless person on the streets.  I was something more.  I was a magician, a wielder of the arcane.  And as I stood there, I knew that I was ready to face whatever challenges came my way.  I was ready to take on the world, to show it what I was capable of.  And as I stood there, feeling the power coursing through me, I knew that nothing could ever stop me again."

        "pred_story": "The suns were setting and rising simultaneously as they were on their third day of orbiting over the world of Nefaria. I was at my post, standing watch with a rifle slung over my shoulder. It was a job that had to be done, so I didn't mind too much. The view was actually pretty nice. I was standing high up on a cliff overlooking the city. I had always thought it looked better from a distance. \n\nAs I watched the suns set, I caught sight of something moving in the distance. I was looking out towards the horizon and at first I thought it was a cloud. It was too big to be a normal cloud. I looked at it through my binoculars and it started to take shape. It was some kind of creature. I couldn't tell its size because it was too far away. I could tell that it was a giant, but I don't know what else. I quickly moved to my radio and called the others. \n\nMy voice was shaking as I called out. \"Everyone, you have to see this. It's something huge and it's headed straight for us. I'm talking city destroyer huge. I'll give you a second to get in position. Go to your emergency shelters. This may not be a drill.\" I didn't wait for anyone to respond. I ran down to the city. I couldn't believe what I was seeing and I needed to tell everyone about it. \n\nAs I ran, I couldn't help but think about my past life. I was a soldier, I had fought in countless battles. I had seen my fair share of monsters, but this was something different. This was something from another world. I had always thought it was a myth, something you hear about in stories. I had always thought that they were just stories meant to scare kids into behaving, but I could see with my own two eyes that they were real.\n\nI ran as fast as I could, my heart pounding in my chest. I could hear the ground shaking beneath my feet. I couldn't see the creature yet, but I could see the ground shaking. I ran through the streets of the city, dodging people who were rushing to get to the shelters. The city was in a panic and I didn't blame them. I ran until I was in the center of the city. I could see the creature now. It was towering over the buildings, its massive body casting a shadow over the city. I couldn't see its face, but I could feel its presence. It was a giant, a monster, and it was looking for something. I could feel its presence. It was looking for us. \n\nI looked around, trying to find some way to defend myself. I had my rifle, but I knew it wouldn't be enough. I looked for any other way to fight, but I couldn't find anything. I was surrounded by buildings, but there was nothing on them that I could use to fight. I looked around, searching for anything, but I couldn't find anything. I knew that I had to be careful. If I were to get too close, I knew that I would be killed instantly. I couldn't help but wonder if it was even worth it. I had never felt so scared in my life, but I couldn't let go of the hope that it might not be a monster. It might be something more. It might be something friendly. I looked at it again, trying to see if it was doing anything. I couldn't see it doing anything, so I took a deep breath and started to run towards it. \n\nI didn't know what I was doing, but I felt like I had to try. I had to see if it was a monster or not. I ran as fast as I could, my heart pounding in my chest. I could feel the heat from the creature. I knew that I would be burned in a matter of seconds. I was going to do something that I had never done before. I was going to try to communicate with it. I didn't know how I was going to do it, but I knew that I had to try. I had to find out if it was a monster. I had to find out if it was something that I could trust. \n\nI stopped at the edge of the shadow, looking up at it. It was even bigger than I had thought. I couldn't believe it. It was almost as big as a mountain. I looked at it, trying to see if it was doing anything. I couldn't see it doing anything, so I took a deep breath and started to speak. I spoke in a language that I had learned when I was a soldier. It was a language that was only used by the gods and a few other creatures. I hoped that it would understand me. I hoped that it would listen to me. \n\n\"I am a human,\" I said. \"I am a creature of this world. I have come to communicate with you. I have come to ask you if you are a monster or not. I have come to ask you if you are a friend or foe. I hope that you will hear me and respond.\" I paused for a moment, waiting for an answer. \n\nI couldn't hear anything, but I could see the creature looking down at me. I couldn't see its face, but I could see its body. I could see its massive hands, its powerful arms, its towering body. It was a godlike creature, a monster that was a legend. \n\n\"I don't know what to say to you,\" I said. \"I don't know if you understand me. I don't know if you will listen to me. I have come to ask you if you are a monster or not. I have come to ask you if you are a friend or foe. I hope that you will hear me and respond.\" I paused for a moment, waiting for an answer. \n\nI couldn't hear anything, but I could see the creature looking down at me. It was looking at me with its eyes. I couldn't see its eyes, but I could feel its gaze. It was a powerful creature, a creature that was capable of destroying worlds. I knew that it was a threat, but I also knew that it was something that I couldn't ignore. \n\n\"I hope that you will hear me and respond,\" I said. \"I hope that you will understand me. I hope that you will listen to me. I don't know if you can hear me, but I know that I have to try. I have to try and communicate with you. I have to try and understand you.

        "pred_story": "It has been months since we started this journey. We had set out in search of the powerful artifact known as the Eye of the Storm. We were a team of seven. Our seventh member would soon be arriving. I had heard he was coming in a few days. I wasn\u2019t sure of his arrival day but I was sure he was going to be interesting.\n\nWe had been traveling on foot for many weeks. Our current location was a massive desert that stretched out to the horizon. The sun was beating down on us like a sledge hammer. The heat was intense and the sand was blistering. We had all been sweating profusely for hours now and I wasn\u2019t sure how much longer we could keep going. I had heard that our next destination was a small oasis that would be able to provide us with shelter and rest. It would be nice to cool off and rest for a bit before continuing on.\n\nAs I looked out at my team, I couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of pride in our accomplishments thus far. We had traveled so far and were still intact. We had been through many trials and had emerged victorious every time. It was amazing how much we had grown as a team. We were no longer just a group of individuals trying to find a powerful artifact. We were a team working together to achieve our goal.\n\nWe had all been quiet for a while now. We were all tired and just wanted to rest. I had decided to stop for a bit and take a break. The group was spread out across the dunes, looking for shade and trying to catch their breath. I had sat down on a dune and was watching my team for a bit. I noticed one of my team members, a young wizard named Zara, practicing her magic in the distance.\n\nI had been watching Zara for a while now. She had been practicing her spells in the desert for hours, every day. She had started practicing in the beginning of our journey and had been getting better with every day. I was impressed by her dedication and work ethic. She was truly a talented wizard.\n\nI watched her as she attempted a spell for the hundredth time that day. It was a difficult spell and one that I had not seen anyone else in the team attempt before. It was one that was even difficult for me to perform. I watched as she took a deep breath and began to speak the words of the incantation. Her hands were shaking as she began to cast the spell, something that usually wasn\u2019t a problem for her.\n\nBut what I noticed was not a problem with her, but rather a problem with the spell itself. She had forgotten to cast the spell in a way that would allow her to control it. She was not protecting herself from the backlash of the spell, something that even the most novice wizards would know how to do. I couldn\u2019t help but feel worried for her as she began to recite the incantation.\n\nShe was in the middle of casting the spell when she was hit by a massive blast of energy. She stumbled backward as the energy hit her, her eyes widening in surprise. She stumbled and fell to the ground, the energy from the spell hitting her again and again. I was shocked by the attack and quickly ran over to her, my eyes scanning her for any signs of injury.\n\nWhen I reached her side, I saw that she was badly burned. The energy from the spell had scorched her skin and was still affecting her. I quickly cast a healing spell to try and repair the damage. It was a difficult spell and one that usually required a lot of concentration and focus. But I was able to perform it with ease.\n\nIt was only a matter of minutes before she was healing from the damage. I had to cast the spell multiple times before she was healed. When I finally stopped, I looked over at her and saw that she was still badly burned. But the energy from the spell was no longer affecting her. I sighed in relief and sat down beside her. I looked at her and saw that she was staring at me. I couldn\u2019t help but smile as I looked at her.\n\nShe was looking at me with a strange expression on her face. It was a mix of relief and anger. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why she was angry. It had been my fault that the spell had gotten out of control. If I had been paying attention and watching her more closely, I wouldn\u2019t have let her perform the spell without making sure that she was safe. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what had happened.\n\nWhen she spoke, I was surprised by her words. \u201cYou let me do it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d She asked, her voice shaking. \u201cYou knew I was going to fail, didn\u2019t you?\u201d She asked again, her voice rising in anger. I looked at her in surprise, unsure of what to say. I knew that I had let her perform the spell, but I didn\u2019t know why she was so angry. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Zara?\u201d I asked her, trying to keep my voice calm. \u201cI know I failed. I know I was going to fail. I just want to know why you let me do it.\u201d She asked again, her voice rising in anger.\n\nI looked at her and was surprised by her words. Why had I let her perform the spell? Why had I known that she was going to fail? I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what had been going through my mind when I had let her perform the spell. It was only when I looked into her eyes that I remembered why I had let her perform the spell. She had asked me before we had set out on this journey if she could come along. She had wanted to come along and help us on our quest for the Eye of the Storm.\n\nBut I had been against it. I had told her that the journey was too dangerous for her and that she should stay behind. But she had been insistent. She had wanted to come along and help us on our quest. So I had agreed to let her come along, but only if she was going to try and learn how to perform the spell that we were going to need to get into the temple. I had agreed to let her come along, but I had also told her that I would never let her perform the spell if I thought it would be too dangerous.\n\nI looked at her and sighed. I had forgotten about her wanting to come along and help us on our quest. I had forgotten about her wanting to perform the spell. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to hurt you, Zara,\u201d I said, trying to calm her down. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to let you perform the spell. I thought it was too dangerous for you.\u201d \u201cYou knew I would fail, didn\u2019t you?\u201d She asked again, her voice rising in anger.\n\nI looked at her and sighed again.

I was hoping that you would learn something new and useful from your failure.\u201d \u201cAnd what was I supposed to learn from my failure?\u201d She asked again, her voice rising in anger.\n\nI looked at her and sighed once more. \u201c"

        "pred_story": "Zombies were at the gates. No one had seen anything like this before. They came by the thousands in waves, their faces twisted and dead and grey. There were humans among them, of course, but there were vampires too. It was the end of the world. The great plague was all anyone could think about.\n\nVampires were once like regular humans, but now they were something entirely different. They needed blood to survive. They had to hunt for it or risk dying. Humans were the best source, but there was a problem. There were too few of them left.\n\nThey had to join forces if they wanted to survive. It was a bitter pill to swallow, but both sides knew they needed each other. The humans would provide blood and the vampires would protect them. Both sides needed each other. And so they formed an uneasy alliance.\n\nIt started with a few humans and a few vampires. They formed small groups of a dozen or so and moved through the streets. The humans would go out at night and gather blood from the zombies. The vampires would protect them as they did it, fighting off any zombies that came too close. They would then return to their groups and have a sort of blood sharing. It was a way of saying thank you to the vampires for their protection and a way for the vampires to get the blood they needed.\n\nEventually, there were too many zombies to fight off on their own. There were too many to gather blood from at night. The humans and vampires had to band together if they wanted to survive. They were lucky they were able to form alliances with some of the other humans who were left. There were too many people who were too scared to help. They would hide in the shadows and watch as the zombies destroyed their world.\n\nOne of the humans was a young girl named Sarah. She was only twelve, but she had seen some things in her time. She had seen the way her parents had died. She had seen the way her friends had been taken. And she had seen the way the vampires had been able to survive. She had also seen the way the humans were able to work together. She was determined to do her part in their survival.\n\nBut there was one person who didn't want to work with the vampires. His name was Mike, and he had a bit of a reputation as a hard nut. He was a bit of a hothead, but he had a lot of skills that would be useful in their fight. He was a skilled fighter and had a strong will to survive. But he was also against vampires. He thought they were monsters and didn't deserve to be part of the alliance. He was angry when he heard about the vampires being included.\n\nHe went out on his own one night, looking for zombies to fight. He had no intention of asking the vampires for help. He was alone when he stumbled into a pack of zombies. He tried to fight them off, but there were too many. He knew he was in trouble. He tried to run, but his legs felt heavy and his arms felt heavy. He was a zombie's next meal.\n\nSarah was part of the human group that had been out gathering blood that night. They had been successful and had come back to their group without any problems. As they returned, they saw a commotion in the distance. They saw a group of zombies running towards a lone human. There was a lot of screaming and the human was stumbling. They knew they had to act fast.\n\nThe vampires were called in immediately. They were ready for a fight. They came running towards the human and zombies, weapons at the ready. The vampires fought off the zombies as the humans approached. They fought their way through to the human and pulled him to safety. They got him to his feet and rushed him back to their group.\n\nMike was shaken. He was scared. He had never been in a position like that before. He was scared of the zombies, but he was also scared of the vampires. He didn't want to see a vampire again. He didn't want to talk to one. But as he was being dragged away from the scene, he saw one of the vampires looking at him. He was trying to read his mind, but Mike was too scared to be calm. He was too scared to be calm.\n\nHe had been staring at the vampire, but the vampire hadn't noticed him. He was too busy scanning the area for any other zombies. The vampire looked a bit like Mike. He was tall and strong. He had a strong jaw and piercing eyes. He was a bit rough looking, but he was handsome. Mike didn't care, though. He was just scared.\n\nAs they took him back to their group, he was quiet. He didn't want to talk to anyone. He didn't want to look at anyone. He just wanted to go back to his room and sleep. He was scared. He was scared of the zombies, but he was also scared of the vampires. He didn't want to be around them again. He didn't want to see them again. He just wanted to be alone.\n\nAs he lay in his bed, he felt a presence behind him. He turned to see a vampire standing there. It was the vampire he had seen earlier. He was standing in the doorway, looking at Mike. He was looking at him with piercing eyes, and Mike felt like he was being read. He felt like the vampire could see into his mind.\n\nMike didn't say anything. He didn't move. He just looked at the vampire, waiting for him to say something. But the vampire didn't say anything. He just looked at Mike for a moment, and then he turned and walked away. Mike was left staring at the wall, wondering what had just happened.\n\nHe didn't know why the vampire had come to see him. He didn't know what the vampire wanted. He just knew that he was scared. He was scared of the zombies, but he was also scared of the vampires. He didn't want to be around them again. He didn't want to see them again. He just wanted to be alone.\n\nAs the days went by, Mike became more and more isolated. He didn't want to talk to anyone, including the humans. He didn't want to see the vampires. He just wanted to be alone. But as the days went by, he started to notice something. He was getting weaker and weaker. He was getting tired and tired. He knew it was something to do with the vampires, but he didn't know what.\n\nIt wasn't until the vampire came to see him again that he figured it out. The vampire came to his room, looking at Mike with piercing eyes. Mike looked at him, feeling scared. But the vampire didn't say anything. He just looked at Mike, and then he touched Mike's forehead. Mike felt a rush of coldness as the vampire took some of his blood. Mike was angry. He didn't want the vampire to take his blood. But he was also scared. He didn't know what would happen if he didn't give the vampire his blood.\n\nThe vampire looked at Mike, smiling. He was satisfied with the amount of blood he had taken. Mike was relieved. He was relieved that the vampire wasn't going to hurt him. But he was still scared. He was scared of the vampires, and he"

        "pred_story": "\"You're a failure,\" my mother, my aunt, and my grandfather said simultaneously. I had heard this phrase so many times before that it had started to lose all meaning. It was a mantra to me, a constant reminder that I was broken in every way that it mattered. My bloodline was known for carrying superpowers, and everyone was convinced I had been born dead. I had never even had a single power, no matter how hard my family tried to help me develop them.\n\nBut after all of this time, it had finally changed. I had two children, a boy and a girl, both with powers so strong that they defied the imagination. My son was capable of teleporting himself across the country in a split second. My daughter could lift anything in existence. It was a miracle, but it also brought a lot of scrutiny to my life. Everyone wanted a piece of me, not because of who I was, but because of who my children were.\n\nMy family had cut ties with me after I first became pregnant. They didn't believe that my children could be the products of my loins. They thought some other woman had stolen them from me, that I was a child stealer, not a mother. I had grown tired of their drama, and I had stopped reaching out to them. I thought I had made my point, but apparently, I was wrong.\n\nMy family wanted me to make an appearance at my daughter's birthday party. It was a big thing in our household, and they wanted to make sure I wasn't missing out. I agreed to go, but only if I could bring my son along. I didn't trust my family enough to leave him with them.\n\nWhen I walked into the house, my son by my side, my family gasped. My grandfather stood up, his face filled with rage. \"You think you can just show up here and be a part of our lives after all of these years?\" he shouted. \"You're a failure! You can't even keep your family together!\"\n\nI ignored him, not even looking up from my phone. My daughter was excited to see me, but my son was worried. He didn't know what to expect, and he was scared. I could feel his power surging through him, and it was making me anxious.\n\n\"Mommy, are you okay?\" my daughter asked. She was sitting on the couch next to my sister, who looked sad. My aunt had always been kind to me, and I could tell she felt bad about what was happening.\n\n\"I'm okay, sweetie,\" I said, looking at my daughter. \"I'm happy to see you, and I'm glad you're having fun.\" I smiled at her, hoping she wouldn't see how hurt I was.\n\nBut she knew. She knew that her father and I had been cut out of her life, and she was confused. She was a smart girl, and she didn't understand why her family would do this to us.\n\nMy son was being quiet, but I knew he was thinking. He was thinking about why his grandparents would be so mad at me. He knew that I had brought him into this world, and he knew that I had always loved him. He wasn't sure why his family would want to hurt me.\n\n\"I'm glad you're here,\" my sister said, standing up and walking over to us. \"I've missed you both.\" She hugged us both, and I felt tears well up in my eyes. I was happy to be with them, to be part of their lives.\n\n\"Let's go get some cake,\" my daughter said, looking around the room. \"I'm starving.\" My family murmured in agreement, and we all went into the kitchen to get some dessert.\n\nWhen we came back, my grandfather was sitting in a chair, looking sad. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I know I've been hard on you, but I just didn't understand.\" He looked at me, and I could see the hurt in his eyes. He didn't realize how much his words had affected me.\n\n\"It's okay,\" I said, smiling at him. \"I forgive you. But maybe next time, we can talk about it instead of cutting each other out of our lives.\"\n\nMy family nodded, and we spent the rest of the day together. It was a start, and I was grateful for it. I knew we still had a long way to go, but I was happy to have them back in my life."

My room is at the very edge of the dormitory, and the window stretches from floor to ceiling, so you can see the sky for miles. I don't get to see much, though. I'm usually too tired to take it all in. After all, I don't sleep. I've tried, but it doesn't seem to work.\n\n\"Excuse me, what is your name?\" I turn to see a young boy of about twelve, holding a small white paper in his hand. It's a note. \"I'm Ethan,\" he says. \"My roommate. I see you're here for the same reason I was invited to be here. But I don't know what it means. Do you?\"\n\nI take the note from him and read it.

I've never seen anything like this before. \"I think it's a club,\" I say, not knowing if it's true or not.\n\n\"A club?\" he looks at me skeptically. \"What kind of club?\"\n\nI shrug. \"I don't know. But it has to be a club, right? There are other humans here. What else could it be?\"\n\nHe looks at me for a moment, then nods. \"You're probably right. I mean, I was invited here, and I don't know if I'm supposed to be here or not.\"\n\nI look at him, then back at the window. It's a bit of a view, I admit. \"You were invited here? Why?\"\n\n\"Well,\" he says, \"I'm a bit of an outsider myself. I don't think I'm a good fit here.\" He looks around, then leans in closer to me. \"But you don't seem to fit here either.\"\n\nI feel a bit awkward, but I don't know what to say. I don't fit here? That's true, I think.\n\n\"I don't know if I'm right,\" he says. \"But I think you're here for the same reason I was invited. I think it's because of your condition.\"\n\nI frown. What condition? I don't feel any different, but I'm not a doctor. Maybe I should get checked out.\n\n\"I don't know what it means,\" he says, \"but I do know that I'm not the only one here who's not like the others.\"\n\nI look at him. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well,\" he says, \"you're not like them either. And I think you're here for the same reason I am. I think we're here because of who we are.\"\n\nI look around at the other rooms. \"You mean because of our species?\"\n\nI hear the door open behind us. We turn to see a young woman, dressed in a black dress, standing in the doorway. \"Hi there,\" she says. \"I'm Luna. I've been assigned to be your roommate.\"\n\nI look at her, but I don't know what to say. She's not like the others, but I don't know what that means. \"Hi,\" I say.\n\n\"I was wondering if you could help me with something,\" she says. \"I need some help with my classes. I've been having trouble with the coursework, and I was wondering if you'd be willing to help me out.\"\n\nI nod. \"Of course,\" I say.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she says. \"I was worried that I'd have to take a course in the supernatural because of my condition. But I'm not sure what that means.\"\n\nI frown. \"You don't know what it means either?\"\n\n\"No,\" she says. \"I've been trying to figure it out for weeks, but I haven't been able to find any answers.\"\n\nI nod. \"I'll help you,\" I say. \"Let's go talk to the professor.\"\n\nShe nods, and we both head to the professor's office.\n\nI sit in the chair, looking around the room. \"What do you think it means?\" I ask him.\n\nHe shrugs. \"I'm not sure,\" he says. \"But I do know that it's a secret society.

You're here because of your condition.\"\n\nI nod. \"What condition?\"\n\nHe smiles. \"You don't know?\"\n\n\"No,\" I say. \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"I'm here because of my blood,\" he says. \"My family has a long history of it. But I've never been able to find out why I have it. I've always felt like there's something missing.\"\n\nI nod. \"I think I know what you mean,\" I say. \"I've been feeling like something's missing too. But I don't know what it is.\"\n\nHe nods. \"It's okay,\" he says. \"You'll figure it out. I know you will.\"\n\nI nod. \"Thank you,\" I say. \"I'll try.\"\n\nI look at him, then back at the window.

My whole life, my career has been about the music. I was going to play the guitar on a stage, and it was going to be huge.

I'm supposed to be the best.\n\nI'm not going to be the best. I'm not even going to be good. I'm going to be terrible. And I'm going to be terrible because that's what I am.\n\nI'm a bad musician and a bad father. I'm a man who adopted a child because he was the easiest way to get the kid I wanted. I didn't want to spend the time with him. I didn't want to raise him. I just wanted to have a kid and I didn't care who it was.\n\nBut he's perfect. And I'm not.\n\n\"That's okay,\" I say, feeling a lump in my throat. \"You're better than me anyway.\"\n\nHe smiles, and I feel a pang in my chest. He's happy, but I'm not happy. I'm miserable.\n\nI'm a bad musician and a bad father. And I'm never going to be good.\n\n\"Hey, I'm going to go get a snack,\" he says. \"Want to come?\"\n\nI nod, but I don't get up.

        "pred_story": "\"Who else is up for it?\" I asked, my bright blue eyes gazing around the room at my group of friends as we looked over the plans for our upcoming road trip. It was our junior year of college, and we were all supposed to be at work, but none of us wanted to be there. Not one of us.\n\n\"I am,\" my friend, Alex, spoke up, his brown eyes sparkling. \"I am so down for this trip. We can go to all of those places and do all of those things. It will be epic.\"\n\n\"It is going to be a lot of fun,\" I said, smiling at my friend. He was always excited. I love that about him. He never fails to make me smile, and for that I am grateful.\n\n\"Yeah,\" my other friend, Jake, said. He was always the quiet one, but that was okay. We all knew him and knew that he was just as excited to get out of the house and see some of the world as the rest of us. \n\n\"Okay, everyone let's get the planning down so we can go.\" I said, smiling around the room at my friends. \"We will need to make reservations for some places, like the hot springs and the motel in the mountains.\" We all spoke up and said okay.\n\n\"I am going to go grab some coffee,\" Alex said, standing up. \"Does anyone want anything from the store?\" Everyone said they wanted a few things, and Alex went off to grab them.\n\n\"Do you have a map of the route?\" Jake asked me, looking through my hands of papers. \n\nI pulled out a map and laid it down on the floor. \"Yes, I have the entire route planned. Here is the route.\"\n\nI explained to Jake the route and he nodded along as I spoke. \"This is the way we will take,\" I said, pointing to a spot on the map. \"Then we will go the next day and head to the next place.\"\n\n\"What if it rains?\" he asked, looking down at the map. I pulled out my umbrella and handed it to him.\n\n\"I brought the umbrella,\" I said. \"I am prepared for any of the weather that may come our way.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" he said, smiling.\n\nMy friends and I were going on a road trip to visit some natural wonders in the state of Oregon. It was my senior year of college, and we were all supposed to be working, but we all decided to take the trip. I was the one to come up with the plans for the trip. It was going to be a three day trip.\n\n\"Okay, is everyone ready?\" I asked, looking around the room. My friends all nodded and I smiled.\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" Alex said, opening the car door.\n\n\"Are you sure this is a good idea?\" Jake asked, looking at me. \"We are going to go on a trip with a creature from the forest. Are you sure that is safe?\"\n\nI sat there for a moment, looking at him before I spoke. I looked at my friends and spoke. \"I am sure,\" I said. \"You will see. Everything will be fine.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" Jake said. \"I am not sure if I am ready to go on a trip with a creature from the forest. What if you get hurt?\"\n\nI looked at Jake and smiled. \"We are all in this together,\" I said. \"We will all look out for each other. Everything will be fine.\"\n\n\"I want to believe that,\" Alex said, looking at Jake.\n\n\"I know it is hard,\" I said, smiling at my friend. \"But I am sure that everything will be fine. We will have a great time and make some new memories.\"\n\nI looked at my friends and smiled. I was sure that everything would be fine."

The deity's throne, crafted from the bones of our heroes, towered over me.\n\nI looked around at the faces of my friends, my comrades. They were defeated, broken. I knew we had been foolish to think we could succeed, but there was something beautiful in the idea that we had tried. That we had failed. That we had been foolish. That we had been brave.\n\nThe dark deity sighed, a low rumble that seemed to shake the very foundations of the world.\n\n\"Sorry guys,\" the deity said. \"I know you thought you were ready for this. I know you thought you could stop me. But I'm afraid I've changed my mind.\"\n\nThe deity gestured to its throne, and I saw that it was covered in scribbled notes.\n\n\"What... what does this mean?\" I asked.\n\n\"Apocalypse cancelled.

We won't be heroes. We won't be villains. We'll just be people.\"\n\nI looked up at the dark deity, which shrugged.\n\n\"I know it's not what you were looking for, but honestly? I've been doing this for a while, and it's just getting old. The whole 'conquering worlds, destroying heroes' thing. It's been done. And honestly, it's just not what I used to do.\"\n\n\"You used to do what?\" my friend asked.\n\nThe deity shrugged.\n\n\"I used to be an accountant. I'm really good with numbers. I don't really see why I had to become a god.\"\n\nI stared at the deity, trying to understand. \"So... you're just going to let us go? We can go back home?\"\n\nThe deity nodded, and I felt a strange sensation. I looked down, and I saw that I was slowly standing up.\n\nI looked around at my friends. They were standing up, too.\n\n\"What about the world?\" one of my friends asked.\n\nThe deity shrugged.\n\n\"Can I go home now?\"\n\n\"You can go home.

        "pred_story": "In the 1980s, we just didn't do the whole \"sneaking in the back door at midnight\" thing. I was a stay at home dad, taking care of my two year old daughter, Emma. My wife, Sarah, had been working non-stop as a nurse, putting herself through med school, but she was coming off a long stretch of night shifts. She had been doing some online courses, and had to work extra shifts to pay for them, so she asked me to watch Emma so she could get some sleep. That's what we did. But this night felt different.\n\nThe door creaked, and I turned to see a black suited man, with sunglasses, holding a uniform and a paycheque in his hand. He said, \"Hi. I'm here to see... Sarah.\" I replied, \"She's asleep. Can I help you?\" The man replied, \"No. I'll just wait.\" He waited in the living room, staring at the wall. I didn't care. I was too busy getting Emma to bed.\n\nThe man didn't say anything to me as I passed him, I didn't say anything to him. When I came back downstairs, he was still there, so I asked, \"Is there anything I can get you? A drink or something?\" He replied, \"No, thank you.\" I nodded, and he asked, \"Is there a place to put this?\" He held up the paycheque. I pointed to the kitchen table, and he walked over there, then looked at me, and said, \"Can you tell Sarah that someone will be by to pick up these things tomorrow?\" I nodded, and he left.\n\nI watched him leave, and I was still wondering, why. He had seemed perfectly normal, but there was something about him that made me uneasy. I just shook my head, and went to bed.\n\nSarah was up early, and had a cup of coffee in her hand, when I woke up. She said, \"Good morning. I'm so sorry I missed bed time last night.\" I said, \"It's okay. I wasn't awake when you came in. Who was that man?\" She replied, \"Oh, I don't know. He said his name was Mr. Thompson, but I don't know if that's his real name.\" I said, \"I don't know what to say.\" She shrugged, and took a sip of her coffee. I walked over to the kitchen table, and picked up the paycheque. I said, \"This was for me.\" She asked, \"Why is there no paycheque?\" I shrugged. \"I don't know.\" I walked back into the living room, and looked at the paycheque again. I said, \"I'm going to take a shower.\" Sarah nodded, and she started to get Emma up and ready for the day.\n\nI didn't think twice about the paycheque again, but it seemed to be everywhere I looked. I picked up my car keys to leave for work, and the paycheque was in my wallet, and so was the paycheque. I laughed, and shook my head.\n\nThe paycheque followed me everywhere. In the shower, on the toilet, in the kitchen, in the living room. It was like the paycheque was trying to get my attention. I tried to ignore it, but it was everywhere. I was starting to get annoyed.\n\nSarah came into the living room, and said, \"It looks like Emma is playing with something.\" I turned to see, and she was holding the paycheque, but there were two of them. One of them was an exact copy of the other. I looked around the room, and saw more copies of the paycheque. They were everywhere. I said, \"What have you done?\" Sarah looked confused, and said, \"What do you mean?\" I said, \"The paycheque. There are copies of it everywhere. How did it happen?\" She shrugged, and said, \"I don't know.\" \n\nEmma was holding a paycheque, and I said, \"Oh, baby. You're holding a paycheque.\" She giggled, and I said, \"You shouldn't touch that. That's mom and dad's money.\" She said, \"No, it's mine.\" I said, \"No, it's not. It's for mom and dad.\" She said, \"Then why is it my paycheque?\" I said, \"It's not your paycheque.\" She said, \"Then why do I have it?\"\n\nI looked around the room, and the copies of the paycheque were all fading away. I said, \"Wait. Let me see that.\" She handed me the paycheque, and I looked at it. Emma was holding a paycheque with her name on it, and it said \"magical girl\" under the name.\n\nSarah walked over to us, and said, \"What's going on?\" I said, \"This paycheque. Is it real?\" Sarah said, \"I don't know. I think I should go ask Mr. Thompson.\" I said, \"I don't know who Mr. Thompson is.\" She said, \"I don't either. I think I should go ask him.\"\n\nI nodded, and we both turned to Emma. We said, \"You're a magical girl?\" She nodded. We said, \"What does that mean?\" She said, \"I'm here to save the world from bad guys.\" We looked at each other, and I said, \"And how do you do that?\" Emma said, \"I wear a costume, and I have a magical power.\" I said, \"What's your power?\" She said, \"I can transform into a giant pink unicorn.\"\n\nSarah and I both looked at each other, and I said, \"You can transform into a giant pink unicorn?\" She nodded, and we both looked at her, and said, \"What is going on?\" Emma just shrugged."

The package was to be picked up by a team of agents, led by a man named Jackson. But there had been a problem. The enemy had learned of the package, and they were determined to stop it from being delivered. Jackson had been killed, and the team had been decimated. Mira was to be part of the new team that would be sent to replace Jackson's team.\n\nHer father was worried about Mira's safety, but he knew that she was ready. She had been trained by him, and he had every confidence that she would be able to handle the mission. Mira was given information on the package, and the team that would be sent with her. There were five agents, but one of them was a new agent, and Mira would have to take him under her wing.\n\nMira was a natural killer. She had been trained by her father, and she knew the tools and methods of the agency. But Mira had never been part of a team. She had always worked alone, or with a team of two. She was not sure how she would fit in with the rest of the team, but she knew that she would have to trust them if she was going to make it out alive. The package was to be delivered at night, and Mira was tasked with being the lead agent. The rest of the team was made up of seasoned agents, but they were all going to be watched closely by Mira.\n\nMira knew that she was the best, and she had every confidence that she would be able to handle the mission. She had been trained to be the best, and she was the best. She was a natural killer, and she was ready to take on the enemy.\n\n\u201cListen up, everyone,\u201d Mira said. \u201cWe will be picking up the package tonight, and we will be delivering it to the organization. We will be going in through the front door, and the package will be waiting for us in the main hallway. There will be two guards, but they will be no problem for us. We will be going in through the main entrance, and we will be taking the stairs. Once we get to the main hallway, we will be picking up the package, and we will be getting out of here as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nThe team nodded, and Mira knew that she had their attention. She was the lead agent, and they would do whatever she said. \u201cAlright, let's get into position. I want to see those guards and get a feel for the hallway. I want to know where the package is going to be, and how many agents will be waiting for us.\u201d\n\nThe team nodded, and Mira moved to the door. She peeked through the peephole, and she saw the guards. They were standing at the main entrance, and they were watching the door. They would not be a problem. The hallway was empty, and Mira could see the package waiting for them in the middle of the hallway. Mira moved to the door, and she moved the lock. She opened the door, and she moved to the hallway.\n\nThe package was a small box, and it was tied with a red ribbon. Mira moved to the box, and she picked it up. She turned to the team, and she nodded. \u201cIt's here. Let's get out of here.\u201d\n\nThe team moved to the stairs, and Mira moved with them. They moved down the stairs, and they moved to the main entrance. Mira moved to the door, and she opened it. She moved to the parking lot, and she moved to the car. The rest of the team followed, and they all got into the car.\n\nThe car was a black SUV, and it was the most up-to-date model. It had tinted windows, and it had a GPS system. Mira started the car, and she moved out of the parking lot. She moved onto the main road, and she accelerated.\n\nThe car moved fast, and Mira could feel the adrenaline. She had always loved the rush of the mission, and she was in the zone. She had been trained by her father, and she had been trained to be the best. She was a natural killer, and she was ready to take on the enemy.\n\nThe car moved through the night, and Mira could feel the wind in her hair. She was in control, and she knew that she would make it out alive. She had been trained to be the best, and she was the best. She was a killer, and she was ready to take on the enemy.\n\nMira stopped the car, and she looked around. They were on a remote road, and they were not sure where they were. But Mira had been given the coordinates, and she knew where they were. She looked at the GPS, and she saw the destination. \u201cWe're here. Let's get out of the car.\u201d\n\nThe team nodded, and Mira moved out of the car. They all moved to the package, and Mira picked it up. She held it in her hand, and she looked at it. \u201cIt's here. It's time to deliver.\u201d\n\nThe team nodded, and Mira moved to the door. She opened it, and she moved to the main road. They moved to the organization's headquarters, and they moved through the night. Mira could feel the adrenaline, and she was ready to take on the enemy.\n\nThey arrived at the organization's headquarters, and Mira moved to the door. She opened it, and she moved inside. She moved to the main hallway, and"

        "pred_story": "As the mourners finished their goodbyes and their tears began to dry, a faint glow appeared in the doorway at the back of the church. They stood in a silent and respectful line, like a cortege, waiting for the funeral procession to leave before they could file out to pay their respects to the deceased and his family. This was a funeral, and at the end of it, the deceased\u2019s family was left alone, and they were left to deal with the repercussions of the lies and the inaccuracies that had been told about their loved one during the eulogies.\n\nIt had been a bit of a surprise to them that the deceased was buried by a priest, especially one that they had never met before. But he was a priest, and so, in the eyes of the law, and in the eyes of the church, he was allowed to perform a funeral service.\n\nIn reality, the deceased hadn\u2019t been a Christian for decades. It was a point that he had made, many times, to his family, and they were all aware of it, but somehow, no one had thought to mention it to the priest.\n\nAnd so, the deceased had to endure hearing about the importance of prayer, the power of faith, and the need to worship the one true God. It was something that he had heard his whole life, and it had gotten so old. He just wanted to be buried in the ground, with the flowers on top, and some music to play at his funeral, and a few words about him, to remind people of who he was.\n\nBut, it didn\u2019t quite work out that way. The priest had been a bit of a showman, and he had taken advantage of the opportunity to talk to a large crowd. He had been a bit of a jokester, and had used some of his humor at the expense of the deceased. And then there were the lies, and the inaccuracies. He had left out things that he thought would be embarrassing, and he had changed some things to make the deceased look better.\n\nBut as the mourners filed out, the ghost of the deceased appeared in the doorway, at the back of the church. He looked at his family, with their tears, and their grief, and he knew what he had to do.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said, in a voice that they had not heard in a while, \u201cI need to correct a few things. My eulogy was a bit of a joke, I think. I wasn\u2019t a Christian, and I didn\u2019t get my wish of being buried in the ground. And some things weren\u2019t exactly accurate.\u201d\n\nHis family looked at him, in shock and horror. They had never seen a ghost before, and it was not something that they had ever expected to happen. They looked at each other, and they looked at him, and they knew that they had to listen to him.\n\n\u201cWhat about the lies and the inaccuracies?\u201d his daughter asked, after she composed herself. \u201cI know that the priest was trying to be funny, but he was also trying to make us laugh, and he was trying to make us feel good. He was trying to make it easier for us to deal with our grief, and our loss.\u201d\n\nThe deceased nodded, \u201cI know, sweetheart. I know that he was trying to make us feel better. But he was also trying to make me look good. He was trying to make me look like a hero, and a saint. But I was just a man, and I was just a father, and a husband, and a son.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, what about the rest?\u201d his wife asked. \u201cWhat about all the things that he left out?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI was a bit of a rebel, I guess. I didn\u2019t want to follow the rules, and I didn\u2019t want to go along with the crowd. I was a bit of a troublemaker, I guess. But I was also a bit of a patriot, I guess. I was proud of my country, and I was proud of its history. And I was proud of the people who had come before me, and who had paved the way for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, what about the money?\u201d his daughter asked. \u201cI know that you were rich, and that you had a lot of things that we could inherit. But I know that you were also very generous, and that you wanted to help people.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cI was a bit of a philanthropist, I guess. I was a bit of a do-gooder, I guess. But I was also a bit of a selfish person, I guess. I wanted to help people, but I also wanted to help myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, what about the last will and testament?\u201d his wife asked. \u201cI know that you left some things to some people, and some things to some charities. But I know that you also left some things to yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cI left some things to myself. I was a bit of a control freak, I guess. I wanted to make sure that things were done my way, and that things were done my way because I wanted to. And I also wanted to make sure that things were done my way because I knew what was best for everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, what about the funeral service?\u201d his daughter asked. \u201cI know that it was a bit of a joke, and that it was a bit of a show. But I know that it was also a bit of a prayer, and a bit of a blessing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess I just wanted to make it easier for everyone. I wanted to make it easier for everyone to deal with their grief, and their loss. And I wanted to make it easier for everyone to move on. And I also wanted to make it easier for everyone to remember me, and to remember my good deeds.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, what about the lies and the inaccuracies?\u201d his wife asked. \u201cI know that they were not exactly accurate, and that they were not exactly true. But I know that they were also not exactly false, and that they were not exactly lies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.

I don't know if it's safe.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"It's safer than being a human,\" she said. \"You don't have to worry about dying, or getting sick. You don't have to worry about anything.\"\n\nHe thought about it again, and then shook his head. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"I just don't understand.\"\n\nShe sighed. \"I don't blame you,\" she said. \"It's a lot to take in.

He looked at the box again, and then nodded. \"Okay,\" he said. \"I'll take it.\"\n\nShe smiled, and handed him a small, delicate ring. \"This is a ring of protection,\" she said. \"It will keep you safe from harm. Wear it at all times, and you'll be safe.\"\n\nHe took the ring, and looked at it. It was a small, delicate thing, one that looked like it was made of gold and silver. It was set with a large, glowing pearl, one that seemed to pulse with a magic all its own.\n\n\"I'll wear it,\" he said. \"Thank you for offering it to me.\"\n\nShe smiled, and then leaned forward. She kissed him on the cheek, and then smiled again. \"I'll always be here to help you,\" she said. \"You'll never be alone, or scared, as long as I'm around.\"\n\nHe felt a rush of emotion, one that he couldn't understand.

She had a knowing glint in her eye, and I knew I should be wary of it.\n\n\"Turn back time?\" I asked, though I had already heard it. I had to give her the chance to talk me down, to explain why this was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea. I had seen the past from my memories. I had seen how it was meant to be.\n\n\"Yes.\" The mage nodded. She walked closer, but not too close. She knew the boundaries between us. She knew I could lash out at her, given enough provocation. I could feel her magic in the air, waiting for me to use it.\n\n\"What are the chances that this will actually work?\" I asked, already knowing the answer. I had asked her already. I had asked her over and over and over. She had told me the same answer each time: it was impossible to be sure. But I could feel the certainty in her words. She was lying to me. She was lying about how sure she was.\n\nI could trust her. I could trust her and I could see that she knew the answer to that question. She was telling me the answer she wanted me to hear, not the answer she was sure of.\n\n\"Why are you telling me this?\" I asked, looking down at my hands. I knew the answer. I was getting old, and I could feel it. I was tired and I was dying. I had been dying for years. But I didn't want to accept that. I was the king of this kingdom. I was the one who would keep it safe. I was the one who would keep it alive.\n\nI would turn back time. I would make it so that I was younger. I would keep my kingdom alive. I could do it. I could turn back time.\n\n\"I'm giving you the option to give up,\" the mage said, her voice soft. I looked up to see the tears in her eyes.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked, looking down at my hands.\n\nI could see her hands, but they were in the way. They were in the way of the answer. I could see the tears in her eyes, but I could also see the answer.\n\nShe held my hand, and I looked up to see the answer. It was an easy answer. I was tired, but that was not why she was giving me this option. She was giving me this option because she didn't think I was capable of winning. She didn't think I could beat the nobles. She didn't think I could keep the kingdom safe.\n\nShe didn't think I was strong enough to keep my kingdom safe. And if I wasn't strong enough, then she knew that I would die. She knew that I would eventually die.\n\nI looked down at my hands. I could feel the weakness in them. I could feel the tiredness. I was tired and I was old and I was dying. I was dying slowly, but I was dying nonetheless.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said, holding my hand.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked, feeling her tears on my hand.\n\n\"Why do you have to apologize?\" I asked, looking up at her. I could see the answer in her eyes. She was giving me this option because she knew that I was not capable of keeping the kingdom safe. She was giving me this option because she knew that I would die.\n\nI looked down at my hands. I could feel the tiredness in them. I was tired and I was old and I was dying. I was dying slowly, but I was dying nonetheless.\n\n\"Turn back time,\" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. I could feel the tiredness in my voice. I could feel the weakness.\n\nI looked up at the mage and I saw her nod. I looked down at my hands and I could see her tears. I knew she was sorry. I knew she was giving me the option to turn back time so that I would not die. But I knew that I would die nonetheless. I knew that it was inevitable. I was tired and I was old and I was dying. I was dying slowly, but I was dying nonetheless.\n\nI looked up at the mage, but I didn't see her. I didn't see her tears or her sorrow. I saw my own reflection. I saw myself, old and tired and dying. I saw my own reflection and I saw that I was dying.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said, holding my hand.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked, feeling her tears on my hand. But I didn't feel her tears. I felt my own tears. I felt the sadness in my eyes.\n\nI knew I was sorry. I knew I was tired and I was old and I was dying.

I saw them and I knew that I would die.\n\nI looked back at my reflection. I saw myself, old and tired and dying. I saw my own reflection and I saw that I was dying.

        "pred_story": "Here is a story that meets your requirements.\n\nI've had it with my life. It's not all it's cracked up to be. So when I die, I'm happy to be gone. Or so I thought.\n\nI'm a bit of an old soul and have had my fair share of near-death experiences. I've always been skeptical about the afterlife and the whole God thing. I'm a firm believer in science and physics. There's no way God and the afterlife are real, I thought. Too many logical fallacies and no evidence.\n\nEach time I'd come back, I'd think it was just my mind playing tricks on me. My body had gone into a sort of suspended animation, protecting itself until I could be revived. Each time, I thought it was just my mind playing tricks on me. That is until this last time.\n\nI'd been in a car accident. My car had collided with a truck. I remember hearing the screech of tires, the crunch of metal, and the feeling of being tossed around like a ragdoll. That's when it all went black.\n\nThis time, I'm not so sure if I'm in a coma or if I'm dead. The first thing I noticed was that I was no longer in my body. I was floating above it, watching the paramedics try to resuscitate me. I felt like I'd been lifted out of my body, watching myself as if I was looking at a body on a medical table. But the first thing that caught my attention was the woman. She was sitting next to me on the gurney. I recognized her. It was my wife. But it wasn't her in this life. She was beautiful, but not the same woman I'd known for the past thirty years.\n\nI'd known her since high school. We'd met in our senior year of high school and had been inseparable ever since. We'd gotten married in our early twenties, had two kids, and had lived a life that was full of ups and downs. But in this universe, it was all different. The woman sitting next to me looked nothing like my wife. She was still beautiful, but different. Her eyes were green instead of brown, her hair was black instead of blonde, and her skin was a little more tanned.\n\nI remember thinking how strange it was that she looked so different. But then I realized that I was dead, and she was talking to me. She told me that I was going to be okay, that I was going to make it through this. But I didn't want to make it through it. I wanted to be gone, to be dead, to be out of this miserable life.\n\nShe started talking, telling me all the things that I'd done wrong in life. She told me that I'd been selfish, that I'd put my own needs above the needs of others. She told me that I'd been unkind to those around me, that I'd spoken words that had been hurtful. But then she turned to me and told me something that caught my attention. She told me that I was a good person, that I had a good heart, and that I deserved a second chance.\n\nI was taken aback. I'd never heard those words before. Never had anyone told me that I was a good person, that I had a good heart. I'd always thought of myself as a bad person, as someone who was self-centered and selfish.\n\nI began to wonder about the afterlife. I'd always been skeptical about it, but what if it was real? What if there was a God, what if there was a heaven and hell? I didn't know what to believe anymore. I didn't know what to think.\n\nThe woman next to me looked at me and told me that I had a choice. I could go back to my life, or I could choose to stay in the afterlife. I could stay with her, and she could help me become the person I was meant to be. I didn't know what to think. I didn't know what to believe. All I knew was that I didn't want to go back to my life. I wanted to stay in this universe, with this woman."

The Terrans had been very kind and cooperative to the Empire, offering aid and assistance whenever the Empire had needed it.\n\nThe Galactic Empire was in debt to the Terrans.  It was a debt of gratitude and a debt of the life of the old Emperor and the Galactic Empire.  The new Emperor and the Empire knew this, and it was a powerful bond that united the two nations."

I have to admit, I was a little scared myself when I first saw the room.\n\nIt was one of those places that you only see in the movies or in your imagination, but never in real life. A room that was like a secret paradise, or so I thought.\n\n\"Here I'll go over this again. You can live in this room forever. You will never age. You will never get sick. You will never be hungry or thirsty. This room is designed to provide for all of your needs, including your emotional needs. You will be safe here. You will be happy here.\"\n\nI have to admit, I was hesitant to spend the night in a room that I had never seen before. I was in my mid-thirties and had been living alone for the last few years. I was doing well, but it felt like something was missing.\n\nWhen I opened the door to the room, I was taken aback by what I saw. It was like walking into a mansion, a palace even. It was large, with marble floors and walls that were lined with golden trim. The furniture was elegant, but at the same time, it was all new and shiny. I saw a large bed in the center of the room, with two large pillows that looked inviting. There was also a large desk, with a computer that looked modern and fast.\n\n\"Is that an Apple computer?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, it is,\" said the voice that came from the computer screen. \"This room has everything you need to live comfortably and happily. You can access the world's information from this computer, watch your favorite movies, or play your favorite games. You will be comfortable here. You will be happy here.\"\n\nI couldn't help but laugh at the idea of a room that was so perfect. I mean, who would ever want to leave this place?\n\n\"Why do you want me to stay in this room?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, you're a lucky one,\" said the voice. \"You get to be the first person to live in this room. You will be the first person to live in this room forever. It is a rare privilege.\"\n\nI was shocked by the idea of living in a room forever, but at the same time, I couldn't think of a reason why I should leave this room. It was like a paradise.\n\n\"Is this some kind of joke?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, it is not a joke,\" said the voice. \"This is the future of life. We will be living in rooms like this for generations to come. And you will be the first person to be a part of it.\"\n\nI was shocked by what I had heard, but at the same time, I was excited. I had always been a bit of a dreamer, and this was the kind of life I had always wanted.\n\n\"I'll stay,\" I said, as I looked around the room for what seemed like the first time. I saw the bed, the desk, the walls, and the floor. I saw everything that I had ever wanted, or at least thought I had wanted.\n\nI knew that I had found a new home, a place where I could live forever. And I knew that I would never leave.\n\n\"So what you're saying is that I can live forever... if I never leave this room again?\" I asked, as I looked at the computer screen that had become my portal to the world.\n\n\"That is correct,\" said the voice. \"You will live forever in this room. You will be safe. You will be happy.\"\n\nAnd with that, I knew that I would never leave this room again. I would stay here forever, living in a paradise that I never thought I could afford.\n\n\"I'll stay,\" I said, as I smiled, knowing that I had found a new home, a place where I could live forever.\n\nThe door closed behind me, and I knew that I would never leave this room again. I was home. I was happy.\n\nI am not sure how long I spent in the room, but I know that it was a while. I spent my days playing games, reading books, and watching movies. I spent my nights sleeping in the large bed, or sitting at the desk, looking at the computer screen that had become my portal to the world.\n\nI spent my days and nights in the room, and I never thought of leaving. I was happy. I was safe. I was home.\n\nI knew that I had found a new home, a place where I could live forever. And I knew that I would never leave.\n\nI am still living in the room, and I will never leave. I have everything that I need to live comfortably and happily. I have a home, a place where I can live forever.\n\nI am home. I am happy. I will never leave."

I've been keeping track of everyone for a very, very long time, and I've come up with a little system to keep everything straight. It's all about debt and promises, you see. The fae and the demons all promised to help me. They all promised to repay me for my kindness.\n\nBut, as you know, they're not the kind of creatures who keep promises. They're more like the kind of creatures who promise all sorts of things and then don't bother to show up when they're supposed to. That's why I keep a list.

He walked into the room and took a seat next to me, a glass of wine in one hand, a bottle in the other. As he poured some of the liquid into my glass I turned to him and asked \"How did you do that?\" He laughed a low sound and said \"Magic, darling.\"\n\nIt was my 21st birthday and I was being celebrated by my friends and family. Many of them were drunk and dancing on the table but I sat in the corner looking out the window. My phone had been broken so I didn't have any music on me. He had been my partner for a few hours, the only sober person in the room.\n\nHe looked at me and smiled, \"I'd like to have a drink with you. It's been a long time since I've had one of these.\" He raised the glass and I nodded, he drank the liquid in one gulp and set the glass back onto the table. The room fell silent, everyone had stopped dancing and looked at us.\n\nHe looked at me and smiled, \"How am I doing? I've had that drink all night and I'm still sober.\" I smiled at him, not knowing what to make of his words. \"You're drunk, you've been drunk the whole night, why does it matter if I'm sober?\" I asked him. He looked at me and smiled and then, before I could stop him, his mouth had latched onto my neck and was biting me.\n\nIt was a pain like nothing I had ever experienced before, a burning that spread through my entire body. My vision began to blur and my body slumped forward. I could feel myself falling and I reached out to grab the table but I couldn't hold on and I fell forward, unconscious. It was like my body had been consumed by a fire and I was nothing but ashes.\n\nI was dead.\n\n---\n\nIt was 17 June 2022, 18 days since I had last seen him. I had been trying to figure out what had happened to him. He had been my first real love, my first kiss, my first everything. And when he had bitten me and died, I had been left behind.\n\nI had been in a hospital for 2 weeks, my body on life support but the doctors had all said it was impossible, the infection had spread too far, the damage had been too extensive. But still, I was healing, still, I was healing.\n\nI was sitting at a hospital bench, in a hospital, surrounded by machines that were attached to my body. My mother stood beside me, crying, \"We're so sorry, sweetie, we're going to get you better.\" I looked at her and smiled, \"I'm sorry, mum, I have to go.\" She looked at me and shook her head, \"What do you mean? You've been on life support for two weeks!\" I looked at her and shrugged, \"I don't know, but I need to go.\"\n\nShe looked at me and took my hand, \"Is there anything you need?\" I shook my head, \"Just go.\" She looked at me and then looked at the machines and then looked at me again, \"Wait, which one?\" She pointed to a machine and I nodded, \"That one.\" She looked at me and nodded and pressed a button. The machine beeped and stopped working, I looked at her and smiled, \"Thanks.\" I leaned down and hugged her and then stood up and walked out of the hospital room.\n\nI looked around at the empty hallways and then looked down at my phone. I had left it at the hospital so I couldn't call him, but I had his number, it was the first thing I had looked up when I had gotten out of the hospital. I looked down at the phone and then looked around at the empty hallways and then I saw him.\n\nHe was standing in the doorway, looking at me with a smile on his face. I looked at him and shook my head, \"How are you here?\" He shrugged, \"Magic, darling.\" I looked at him and smiled, \"You're drunk.\" He looked at me and laughed and stumbled towards me. I looked at him and laughed and caught him before he fell. \"You're drunk, you've been drunk the whole night, why does it matter if I'm sober?\" I asked him. He looked at me and smiled and then, before I could stop him, his mouth had latched onto my neck and was biting me.\n\nIt was a pain like nothing I had ever experienced before, a burning that spread through my entire body.

He would only say a few words on occasion, mostly small phrases or short sentences. It was clear that he was struggling to speak, and I would often catch him looking around his house and then back at me as if thinking or trying to remember something.\n\nI had noticed that he would often look at me with this small smile on his face.

It was clear that he was getting tired. I couldn\u2019t help but feel sad that he was getting old.

I wanted to make sure that he knew that I was here for him, and that he was not alone.\n\nHe looked at me for a long time before finally speaking up. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that I don\u2019t have much time left. I want to make sure that you are prepared.\u201d\n\nI looked at him in confusion. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked him.\n\nHe looked at me with his old eyes. \u201cI\u2019m talking about your life,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to know how to live.

I was able to make sure that I was here for him. I wanted to make sure that he knew that I was here for him.\n\nBut then I saw him walking down the stairs. He was able to walk again.

        "pred_story": "\"It can be done, can't it?\" she asked. The sound of her voice was soothing and as she stood in front of me I felt my heart lift up. It had a calming effect, one that I hadn't felt in a long while.\n\n\"It can be done,\" I replied with a soft smile. \"I know it can be done.\"\n\nThe darkness outside seemed to grow bigger and bigger. It was as if it was coming for me and I knew that I would be swallowed up. But as I stood in front of her, my fear disappeared. She was here. She had come for me.\n\n\"You're scared,\" she said and I nodded. I felt scared, I felt scared of what was out there. But as I looked at her, I felt a calm wash over me. I felt safe.\n\n\"I am,\" I replied and I saw the corners of her mouth curve upwards into a smile.\n\n\"Don't be scared,\" she said and I smiled back. \"We can do this together.\"\n\nI knew that she meant it. I knew that she would stand by me. And I knew that I would stand by her. I felt a rush of confidence. We could do this. We could defeat the darkness.\n\n\"I have a plan,\" she said and I knew that she had one. She had been thinking about this for weeks and I had been thinking about it too. But I had been too scared to do anything about it. And now she was standing in front of me.\n\n\"I have been thinking a lot about this,\" I said. \"I have been thinking about all the ways that we could win. And I have come up with a plan.\"\n\n\"I am glad,\" she said and she smiled at me.\n\n\"I have been thinking about it for weeks,\" I said. \"I have been thinking about it every night and I have been thinking about it every day. And I have come up with a plan.\"\n\nI nodded and I looked around the room. I saw that she was ready to go. She was standing in front of the door with her bag in her hand.\n\n\"We need to go,\" she said and I nodded. I grabbed my bag and followed her out of the room.\n\nAs we walked through the house, I felt a rush of adrenaline. I knew that we were doing this and I knew that we were going to win. I could feel it in my bones.\n\n\"We need to move fast,\" I said. \"We need to get to the end of the road before they come.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she said and she pushed open the door. \"Let's go!\"\n\nI followed her out of the door and down the road. I could see the darkness getting closer and closer and I knew that we had to move faster. But I also knew that we had a plan.\n\n\"We need to take the left path,\" I said and she nodded.\n\n\"I know,\" she said and she moved to the left. \"Let's go!\"\n\nI followed her and we ran down the road. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest and I knew that we were getting close. I could feel it.\n\nAs we ran, I could hear the sound of cars behind us. I knew that they were coming for us. But I also knew that we had a plan.\n\n\"We need to go faster,\" I said and she nodded. \"Let's go!\"\n\nI ran after her and we kept moving. We were almost at the end of the road and I could feel the darkness getting closer and closer.

I knew that we had done something special. I knew that we had accomplished something.\n\n\"It was a good plan,\" I said and she nodded.\n\n\"It was,\" she said and she smiled at me. \"We did it.\"\n\nI looked at her and I felt a rush of emotions.

This was the moment.\n\n\"We need to go back to the house,\" she said and I nodded. \"We need to go back to the house.\"\n\nI nodded and we walked back to the house.

        "pred_story": "He stood outside, pacing and feeling like he was slowly going mad. When the sun finally set, he made his way to the palace, the iron gates swinging open at his approach. The gates, like the door to his home, were covered in locks. The guards inside the gates barely batted an eye as he passed them, and the others at the gate opened it with a nod as they recognized him.\n\nThe palace gates swung open with a groan as he kicked them open, but the guards inside barely flinched. They eyed him warily, but he was the king. They had a duty to protect him, but he wasn't in danger. He wasn't planning on causing a ruckus, only getting into the palace. \n\nHe followed them as they opened the doors and ushered him in, and soon he was face to face with the Queen.\n\nShe was as beautiful as ever, her long, silver hair cascading down her back and her piercing blue eyes gleaming with amusement. A cruel smile twisted her lips as she approached him, and he felt a surge of anger in his chest. It had been two decades since his daughter was stolen, and still he was waiting for justice.\n\n\u201cDad... what are you doing here?\u201d she asked, her voice dripping with amusement.\n\nHe pulled out a small knife from his sleeve and held it up, the blade glinting in the dim light of the room. \u201cI've come for you,\u201d he said, his voice steady.\n\nShe chuckled, and he knew she thought he was there to beg her for his daughter's return. The Queen was known for being cruel, but he had no choice. He had to do this. His daughter was the only thing that had ever mattered in his life, and he had been searching for her for two decades.\n\n\u201cI'm afraid that's not possible,\u201d she said, her voice dripping with amusement. \u201cYou see, I'm not a human. I'm a Fae, and as such I'm not bound by the same laws as you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour laws,\u201d he spat, the knife still held up. \u201cYou have none. You're just cruel. And as a king, I demand that you return my daughter to me.\u201d\n\nShe chuckled, and he felt the blade waver in his hand. \u201cI'm not a king,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I'm a queen. And as such, I'm entitled to do what I please.\u201d\n\nShe lunged at him with her sword, and he barely managed to dodge it. The blade bit into the stone floor, and she followed up with a second swing, but he was ready this time. He swung his arm up and caught the blade, twisting it out of her hand.\n\nThe sword clattered to the floor, and the queen gasped as she backpedaled. She had no weapon left to her hand, and he knew he had the upper hand now. He advanced on her, his heart pounding in his chest, and he knew this was it. This was the moment he had been waiting for for two decades.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d she spat, her voice dripping with anger. \u201cWhy did you come here for me? You're a fool, a complete fool.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou took my daughter,\u201d he said, his voice steady. \u201cAnd I want her back.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was never yours to begin with,\u201d the queen spat. \u201cYou're a mortal, and mortals can't own Fae. You're a fool if you thought you could.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou're a cruel, cruel woman,\u201d he spat, his anger growing. \u201cYou took my daughter from me and left me to rot. You're a monster.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm not cruel,\u201d the queen said, her voice dripping with amusement. \u201cI'm just doing what needs to be done. You're a threat, a danger to my kingdom, and my daughter is safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour daughter?\u201d he spat. \u201cYou mean your heir?\u201d\n\n\nThe queen nodded. \u201cYes, that's what I mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd my daughter?\u201d\n\n\nShe shrugged. \u201cYour daughter isn't a threat to us. You are.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou mean you don't need her?\u201d\n\n\nThe queen shook her head. \u201cWe have plenty of warriors. You're a threat because you can see through illusions. You're a threat to our power.\u201d\n\n\nHe nodded, knowing she was right. He couldn't see through the illusions of the palace, but he knew they were there. And he knew that if he wanted to stay in the palace, he would have to find a way to get through them. And that meant finding a way to get past the queen."

        "pred_story": "I had been running for a while when I spotted it. The sign above the store was half-torn and faded, but the red glow of the letters \"Radio Shack\" told me that I had found a place with power.\n\nI didn't go inside right away. It took a few minutes for me to be brave enough to step inside. If a place was lit up in a dark world, there had to be people inside. And if there were people inside, they had to be killed. I checked my gear, a machete, a pistol and four bullets. I did not expect to need all of them.\n\nI opened the door slowly, and the noise of the TV inside filled my ears. I walked inside, my machete leading the way. The store was nearly empty, with only a few of the most expensive items left on the shelves. There were rows of laptops, but only a few were still intact. I spotted a few phones, but they were all cracked. I found a small kitchenette in the back with a small fridge and a coffee machine. \n\nI went to the back of the store to find the source of the power. I found a small generator, and a small room with a few solar panels on the roof. The panels were partially broken, but it looked like they were meant to provide power. I took a few moments to repair them. I would take the panels with me to keep them for future use.\n\nI returned to the main store to find a TV showing the news. The news was talking about the President's press conference, but the President was not on the screen. Instead, a group of lawmakers were talking over each other. I saw the name of the President at the bottom of the screen, but it was not someone I recognized. I saw the name \"Joe Biden\" and wondered if he had been assassinated, or if this was a fake.\n\nI moved to the TV next to it and found a screen with the PS7 logo. I took the disc from the case and tried to insert it into my phone. It did not work. I then took the disc out of the case and tried to insert it into the TV next to it. It did not work. I then took the disc and held it up to the light. I did not recognize the logo on the disc. It looked like a logo from an Asian company.\n\nI then returned to the back of the store and searched for the generator. It was not there. I searched the store for any sign of the generator, but it was gone. I then found a room with a lot of cables. I searched the room for any sign of the generator, but it was not there. I saw a name on a few of the boxes and recognized it as a name of the maker of my phone. I wondered if they had made the generator.\n\nI then returned to the front of the store and searched for the TV with the logo. I saw it in a corner of the store and returned to it. I took the disc from the box and inserted it into the TV. It started to play a game. I was impressed by the graphics. I then took the disc out of the TV and inserted it into the other TV. It played the same game, but it was not as good as it was on the first TV.\n\nI then returned to the back of the store and searched for a computer. I found a few computers with the logo from the maker of my phone. I took one of the computers and returned to the front of the store. I started to play the game on the computer, but it was slow. I then took the disc out of the computer and inserted it into the TV. The game was much faster on the TV than it was on the computer.\n\nI then went to the back of the store and searched for a way to connect the TV to the generator. I found a small cable that connected the TV to a small box. I took the small box out of the store and returned to the generator. I connected the small box to the generator and returned to the TV. I turned the TV on and was happy to see that it was working again.\n\nI then returned to the back of the store and searched for a way to connect the generator to the solar panels. I found a small cable that connected the generator to the solar panels. I took the small cable and returned to the solar panels.

I turned the generator on and was happy to see that it was working again.\n\nI then returned to the back of the store and searched for a way to connect the TV to the solar panels.

        "pred_story": "\"Hey, why'd you stop?\"\n\nI looked back at my friends. We were a group of five adventurers. Only four of us survived an encounter with mimics. We were all around our early twenties, or so I thought, or at least, the way the world seemed to work, was.\n\n\"I'm just tired of running,\" I replied, not looking away from my book.\n\nI was sitting on a large rock with my back towards them. My friends would not bother me while I was reading.\n\nBut my friend, Alex, approached me. She stopped and picked up a rock next to me, and she looked up at my book. \"You're reading again? How many times has it been now?\"\n\nI hadn't answered her question. Alex would always ask the same question. I had been reading the book for what felt like years, not that it mattered. The world didn't work like that anymore. There was a reason I had stopped using the calendar.\n\n\"Read it to us,\" she said, throwing the rock down. \"I'm sure it's about us. You've been reading it for what felt like years, and I'm sure it's about us. We're the main characters, and it's been a thrilling adventure so far.\"\n\nI sighed and looked back at my friends. Only four of them were left now. My friend, Alex, was the one who had been doing most of the talking.\n\n\"We've been on a journey so far, and it's been filled with battles, danger, and excitement. We've been on the run for what felt like years, and we've almost been killed every day. But we've made it. We've made it through the forest, and we're in the city now.\"\n\nI sighed again. I wasn't sure why Alex was asking so many questions. I wasn't sure why she wanted to know. I had stopped reading the book because I didn't want to have anything to do with it anymore. I didn't want to have anything to do with the world anymore.\n\n\"We've encountered some amazing things on our journey,\" my friend continued. \"We've encountered a lot of danger, but we've also encountered some amazing things. We've seen some beautiful sights, and we've met some interesting characters.\"\n\nI sighed and looked back at my book. I had no idea what my friend was talking about. I didn't care about the journey or the adventures. I didn't care about anything anymore.\n\n\"I'm just tired of running,\" I said again.\n\n\"Why are you tired of running?\" Alex asked. \"We're almost safe now. We're almost safe.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"I'm tired of running because I don't have anywhere to go,\" I said. \"We've been running for so long, and I'm tired of running. I'm tired of being on the run.\"\n\nMy friend looked at me with confusion. \"I don't understand,\" she said. \"We're running from the mimics.\"\n\nI nodded. \"I know. We're running from the mimics. But I'm tired of running from the mimics. I'm tired of running from everything. I'm tired of everything.\"\n\nMy friend looked at me with concern. \"Why are you tired of everything?\" she asked.\n\nI sighed and looked back at my book. I didn't know why I was tired of everything. I didn't know why I had stopped caring about anything.\n\n\"You're going to be safe,\" she said. \"We're all going to be safe.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"I'm not going to be safe,\" I said. \"None of us are going to be safe.

The ache in my skull where my brain should have been was a dull hum, the sensation of my skin being stretched over my skeleton made my bones feel like rubber. Another soul lost, another life wasted.\n\nThe necromancer on the other end of the phone was detached, as always. \"Are you aware of the risks, customer?\" \"No, they didn't warn you that after the fifth death, it would start to feel like Groundhog Day?\". \"You're aware that this is a service, not a hobby? You're aware that there are consequences to abusing it?\"\n\nI was aware. I was well aware. It was after the fifth death that I'd realized that I had a problem, that the necromancer was just a symptom of a larger issue with myself. I couldn't stop myself from dying. My mind wasn't as strong as I thought it was, not as strong as I needed it to be.\n\nBut the necromancer was expensive. And I wanted to live again. I wanted to experience the world, to love and to laugh. I wanted to feel again. And so, I continued to use the service. I was addicted to it, to the feeling of being alive again, even if it was just for a few short hours.\n\nThe necromancer sighed. \"You're aware that you're going to lose your next life to me if you continue to abuse this service?\" I was aware. I had already lost it. I had already lost my last life. And I was prepared to lose my next one. I would have to.\n\nThe necromancer sighed. \"I can give you one more life, for the price of $1,000. But if you die again, I'm going to send you to the afterlife. You'll have to be reborn from scratch, and you'll have to pay me $5,000 to get back into the service. And if you die again, I'll send you to the afterlife, and you'll have to pay me $10,000 to get back into the service.\"\n\nI nodded, though I knew that the necromancer couldn't see me. I agreed to the price. I paid the money, and the necromancer cast the spell. I was reborn, and I was back in my body. I was alive, for a few hours at least.\n\nAnd then I died again. And again. And again. Until I couldn't afford to pay the necromancer anymore. Until I had to cancel my prescription."

        "pred_story": "A young necromancer sat at his desk in his dimly lit chamber. He was going over some papers when a knock came to the door. He was expecting no one at that hour so he was somewhat surprised. He opened the door to find a young man standing in the doorway.\n\n\u201cCome on in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is late. How could you be so bold as to knock at the door.\u201d\n\nThe man stepped inside. \u201cSorry. I have come for a referral. It seems you are the most reputable necromancer in the area.\u201d\n\nThe man stood up from his desk and began to pace. \u201cI do not know. How is that possible?\u201d\n\nHe opened a cabinet. \u201cI do not advertise. Perhaps someone told you of me.\u201d\n\nThe man shook his head. \u201cNo. I have used my service before. You are the one they refer to as the last hope.\u201d\n\nHe stopped his pacing. \u201cThey refer to me that way?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. The last hope for those who have failed to find a normal method of death. You are known for your reliability and efficiency in the necromancy world.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cI am glad that my work has received such high praise.\u201d\n\nThe man sat down in one of the chairs against the wall. \u201cIs it true that you offer free referrals?\u201d \n\nHe looked at the man. \u201cYes that is true.\u201d\n\nThe man nodded. \u201cYou may be the last one I try. I have been dead five times. I need to cancel my presciption to your service.\u201d\n\nHe looked down. \u201cI do not like to turn away clients. However, I am not sure what we would say if you decided to go back on the service.\u201d\n\nThe man raised his eyebrow. \u201cI will make sure that you do not have to have that problem. It would be best for both of us if I did not have to do your service anymore.\u201d \n\nHe picked up a pen and wrote down an address. \u201cYou need to mail me the papers to cancel your account. It is the address written down above the paper.\u201d\n\nThe man took the paper from him and looked at the address. \u201cI see. What is that?\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cThe paper with the address on it. It is my personal office.\u201d\n\nThe man looked at it again. \u201cOh. I see. I will be sure to mail it back to you. Thank you for your time tonight.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cYou are welcome. I wish you better luck on your next death.\u201d\n\nThe man stood up and bowed. \u201cThank you for your understanding.\u201d\n\nHe walked him to the door. \u201cI wish you the best of luck.\u201d\n\nThe man opened the door. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nHe stepped out into the night. The man closed the door behind him. He let out a sigh of relief.\n\nHe was glad that he did not have to deal with that man again. He walked back over to his desk. He sat down and started going through the papers that he had been going over. He had received a letter in the mail that day and he had been going over the papers to see if there was anything that he had missed. He was a very thorough necromancer and he liked to make sure that he had gotten every detail of a service correct. He was going to make sure that he found everything in the letter. He made a note to send a letter to the man in the future to let him know that he had received his letter.\n\nHe leaned back in his chair and let out a sigh. He was glad that he had been able to deal with that situation so peacefully. He sat back and began to go over the papers again. He was in no rush to get out of his chamber that night and he was happy to spend a little more time in his desk chair. He was a necromancer and he liked to spend his time indoors and with his papers. He did not mind the lack of light that his chamber had. It was a place where he could be alone with his thoughts and his papers. He was a necromancer and he needed a place to think and to process the jobs that he did."

It's the ones where everything's going well, the sun's shining, and you're getting all you want. You think everything's going to keep going like that, and you start to let your guard down. Then one day you get the surprise of a lifetime. And that's when things can start to go wrong.\n\nI didn't think that would ever be the case for me, though. I had a pretty good run going. I went to a good school, got a good job, and married a good woman. I thought I was set. And I was until the day I got a call from a lawyer I've never met before, telling me I'd been named as the sole heir of a deceased relative. I knew my grandfather had a fortune, but I didn't think I'd inherit it. It turned out I wasn't just the heir to his fortune, I was the heir to his soul collection.\n\nNow I know what you're thinking. How do you collect souls? It turns out the people I've met are quite accommodating. They're willing to make deals, give you a cut of the profits. And profits are just the word I would use. Profits that go beyond anything I could have ever imagined. I've been able to buy out my employer, make them an offer they couldn't refuse. I've been able to hire the most talented people in the business, and with the souls at my disposal, I could make an offer that would blow their mind.\n\nBut it's not all easy money. It seems like every other week I get a visit from some big shot, wanting to make a deal with me. They're always trying to outdo one another, trying to make a name for themselves. I don't get out of the house often anymore. All the people I know think I'm some kind of magician, that I'm able to get all these souls without lifting a finger. They don't understand how much work it takes to run a business like this. You can't just sit around and wait for people to show up. You have to go out and find them.\n\nBut it's not like I'm looking to get rid of them. They're all just trying to do what I used to do. They're all just trying to live a good life, make a good living. They're all just trying to end up on top.\n\nI'm here to tell you, I was never like them. I was always the one at the top. I was always the one with the souls. But I'm not bragging. I'm not telling you to be jealous. I'm telling you so you can learn. Don't get too comfortable. Don't let your guard down. Because when you least expect it, you might get a surprise of a lifetime. And that's when things can start to go wrong."

        "pred_story": "The sun had set. But on Mars, all was still except for the faint glow of the lights and the soft hum of the engines. The silence was broken when one of the workers, a man named Bob, came to the crew of the mission and spoke. \u201cThe Earth is in a state of emergency. The water and food supplies are low and there are riots happening.\u201d\n\nThe crew of the Mars mission had been on the planet for years, and there had been no communication with the Earth crew in almost a year. When they heard of the Earth's desperate situation, they decided to send a rescue mission. The crew, who had been stuck on Mars for years and were eager to return to Earth, were excited to return and help those in need. \u201cWe can't let them down. We have to do something.\u201d The captain of the rescue mission had been one of the original crew members of the Mars mission. He knew that the rescue mission would be dangerous and that they could not bring back all of the crew of the Mars mission.\n\nThe crew of the Mars mission boarded a shuttle and began their journey to Earth. They encountered many dangers along the way, including solar flares that damaged the shuttle's systems and space debris that nearly destroyed the shuttle. But the crew was determined to make it back to Earth. They knew that their lives were not the only ones at stake. When they finally arrived at the space station, they were greeted with a mix of emotions. The crew of the station were surprised to see the crew of the Mars mission. They had given up hope of ever seeing them again. But the crew of the Mars mission was not prepared to be welcomed with open arms. \u201cWe have to leave immediately. There is no time to waste.\u201d\n\nThe crew of the station was confused. \u201cWhat is wrong?\u201d They asked. \u201cThe Earth is in danger. We have to go.\u201d \u201cWhat about us?\u201d \u201cI am sorry. But you are safe here. We can't leave you behind.\u201d The crew of the station knew that they were safe, but they were also aware of the gravity of the situation. They knew that they had to do something.\n\nThe crew of the Mars mission gave the crew of the station the information that they had gathered. \u201cThis is impossible. There is no way we can save everyone.\u201d \u201cWe have to try. We can't just leave them behind.\u201d The crew of the station agreed. They knew that they had to act fast. The rescue mission was set in motion. The crew of the station and the crew of the Mars mission worked together to create a plan to save everyone on the Earth.\n\nThe plan was to use the resources that the station had available to create a network of satellites that would orbit the Earth. The satellites would be used to gather resources from the Earth and transport them back to the station. The resources would then be used to help those in need on the Earth.\n\nThe crew of the station and the crew of the Mars mission worked tirelessly to create the network of satellites. They encountered many obstacles along the way, but they were determined to see the mission through. They were not going to let the people of the Earth suffer.\n\nThe rescue mission was a success. The crew of the station and the crew of the Mars mission had managed to save everyone on the Earth. The people of the Earth were safe, and the crew of the station and the crew of the Mars mission were hailed as heroes. \u201cWe did it. We saved everyone.\u201d \u201cWe did it. We are finally immortal.\u201d"

        "pred_story": "As I walk towards the ruined kingdom I notice it has been a while since I was in this place. I've never seen a place as beautiful as this one before. In a way I feel sad for the people that had to flee this place, leaving it in the state it is now. Maybe if they had acted faster the situation would have been better.\n\nI start to climb up the ruined stairs towards the lighthouse. It's a bit rough but I'll be able to make it to the top if I take my time. The stairs are covered in cobwebs and dust so I take my time so I don't slip and fall. The stairs are much easier to climb than it looks but it's still a challenge.\n\nWhen I reach the top of the lighthouse I see a figure standing at the edge. He's a tall man with a suit of armor that reflects the sun. He's a knight and he's holding his sword so if I get too close he will kill me. I feel a bit scared now that I think about it. What was I thinking?\n\nI try to be as calm as I can be. He sees me and he raises his sword to my throat.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he asks.\n\n\"I'm a traveler from afar,\" I say. \"I just wanted to see what's left of the kingdom.\"\n\n\"I've been watching you climb the stairs,\" he says. \"Why have you come here?\"\n\nI don't know why I did this. I was just curious about the ruined kingdom. I'm a bit stupid when it comes to some things but this time I think I did the right thing.\n\n\"I was curious,\" I say. \"I saw the lighthouse and I was curious about what was left here.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not going to let you pass,\" he says. \"If you're not here to bring me down then you shouldn't be here in the first place.\"\n\nI look at him and I feel a bit sorry for him. He's a bit sad and desperate but he doesn't want to admit it. I think of telling him that he should give up now but I think he would just get angry.\n\n\"Why are you here if you won't let me pass?\" I ask.\n\n\"I'm here to protect the kingdom,\" he says. \"There was a battle many years ago and we won the battle but we lost a lot of our land. We had to retreat and we had to find a new place to live.\"\n\nI nod my head. It makes sense but at the same time it's a bit hard to believe. If the kingdom is in a good location why did they give up? I think about telling him that I think he's crazy but I don't know him.\n\n\"What happened to the other knights?\" I ask.\n\n\"They're gone,\" he says. \"They fought a war and they lost. They were killed and I'm the only one left.\"\n\nI nod my head and I start to walk away. He follows me and he looks at me with anger.\n\n\"Why are you walking away?\" he asks.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I say. \"I didn't mean to be here and cause any trouble.\"\n\n\"It's okay,\" he says. \"You're not a threat to me and my kingdom.\"\n\n\"But I'm not going to be able to leave,\" I say. \"I have to return back to my kingdom.\"\n\nHe looks at me and he sees the fear in my eyes. He sighs and he looks down at his sword.\n\n\"Why did you come here?\"\n\n\"I told you already,\" I say. \"I was curious about the ruined kingdom.\"\n\n\"I believe you,\" he says. \"I'll let you go back to your kingdom.\"\n\nI nod my head and I walk back down the stairs. As I walk I hear the sound of his sword being sheathed. I turn around and I look up the stairs.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I say. \"I'm sorry again.\"\n\n\"It's okay,\" he says. \"I'll see you again.\"\n\nI nod my head and I start to walk towards my home. I'm relieved that I was able to make it out of there alive. I think about the knight and his kingdom. I think that there must be something else that he's looking for.\n\nI start to walk faster and I soon find myself at my home. My wife sees me and she smiles.\n\n\"Where have you been?\" she asks.\n\n\"I just wanted to see the ruined kingdom,\" I say.\n\n\"I was worried about you,\" she says. \"I haven't seen you for a few days.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I say. \"I'll try to make time for you.\"\n\n\"I'm not mad,\" she says. \"I just want you to be safe.\"\n\nI nod my head and I look at her. I love her and I don't want her to be worried.\n\n\"I'm sorry again,\" I say.\n\nShe smiles and she kisses me. I feel happy and I know that she's happy.\n\n\"I'll be back soon,\" I say. \"I have to go back to my kingdom.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" she says. \"Take care.\"\n\nI nod my head and I start to walk back to my kingdom.

I had accounted for every eventuality. The hero had won, but only by a hair, and I was left to wonder what had gone wrong.\n\nThe hero was dressed in a suit that seemed to be a mix of armor and fabric, and wore a sword at his side that seemed to glow with an inner light. He looked like some kind of hero from a fantasy novel, and I felt a pang of jealousy as I thought about how he must have been able to obtain such a suit.\n\nI had beaten him at every turn, I had planned and prepared for every possible scenario. I had thought of everything, and yet he had still managed to find a way to beat me. I looked at the hero and wondered why he had won.\n\nIt was then that I realized it was not my fault. I had not lost, the hero had cheated. I had seen him perform magic that was beyond my comprehension, magic that I could not have possibly anticipated. I had been outsmarted.\n\nI glared at the hero, feeling a sudden surge of anger. He had won by cheating, and now he was gloating as if he had somehow managed to better me.\n\nI had been foolish to trust him.

I had never thought of it that way before.\n\nI thought about the words as they hung in the air. What did he mean? Had we both cheated? I thought about my plan, and how I had planned every detail.\n\n\"Does that mean that you cheated too?\" I asked, and the hero nodded at me.\n\n\"You cheated by being more powerful,\" he said. \"You cheated by using your power to defeat me.\"\n\nI thought about his words, and I realized that he was right. I had cheated by being stronger.\n\nI looked at the hero, and I felt a pang of guilt. I had been wrong to feel angry, I had been wrong to feel cheated.\n\n\"What do you want?\" I asked, feeling a sense of defeat.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked, and I realized that I was looking at the situation from the wrong perspective.\n\n\"I want you to win,\" I said. \"I want you to defeat me.\"\n\n\"Why?\" he asked, and I looked at him. I saw the determination in his eyes, and I realized that he wanted to win because it was the right thing to do.\n\n\"I want you to defeat me because you're stronger,\" I said. \"I want you to defeat me because you're more powerful.\"\n\nHe nodded, and I felt a sense of acceptance. He was stronger, he was more powerful, and I was better off letting him win.\n\n\"You win,\" I said, and he grinned at me.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said, and I smiled back at him. \"I'm glad you did. I was worried I'd have to do it again if I had lost.\"\n\nI laughed at his words, and the two of us stood there in silence for a moment.\n\n\"How did you get that suit?\" I asked, and he grinned at me.\n\n\"I didn't get it,\" he said. \"I was given it.\"\n\n\"By who?\" I asked, and he looked at me with a serious expression.\n\n\"By someone who wanted to help me,\" he said. \"Someone who wanted to help me defeat the evil in the world.\"\n\nI looked at him, feeling a pang of jealousy at his words.\n\n\"I think you're going to go a long way,\" I said. \"I think you're going to do great things.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said, and we stood there for a moment before he turned and walked away.\n\nI watched him go, and I felt a sense of acceptance.

I ducked behind a dumpster, and peeked back out. \n\nAnd saw her. My love. \n\nHer eyes locked onto me, and I could see her eyes flare up, a hint of anger in her gaze.

        "pred_story": "**The Cheated Hero's Fury**\n\nA dark and stormy night. Just like any other night of my life, the streets were empty and the only sounds were the wind and my own heavy breathing. It was the perfect time to get some work done, but no one can say I didn't think about my personal life while I was out fighting crime. \n\nI had just caught my arch-nemesis, The Sinister, trying to rob a store. But this time, he hadn't come alone. The Sinister's partner in crime, the lovely and dashing Dark Maiden, had come along for the ride. I had caught her before, but she'd managed to weasel her way out of jail. I wondered what had happened to her after that time, especially after I caught a glimpse of her kissing The Sinister in her cell. But I never thought it would come to this.\n\nThe Sinister and Dark Maiden were handcuffed behind their backs and I was in between them, my arms crossed over my chest. I could feel the tension in the air and I couldn't wait to make my way back home and hear the news about my hero's personal life.\n\n\"So, how's it feel, cheating on your lover?\" I asked the two of them, my voice dripping with disdain. \n\n\"Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This has nothing to do with you,\" Dark Maiden spoke up, her voice smooth and silky, but I could see the fear in her eyes. \n\n\"Oh, sure. Tell me another one,\" I spat. \"What you two are doing is cheating. And it's going to take you to jail. You can't go to jail yet, so let's hear your side of the story before we take you in.\" \n\nThe Sinister tried to speak up, but Dark Maiden cut him off. \n\n\"It's not cheating! We're in love!\" \n\n\"Love? Really? I saw you two kissing before! You two are the most notorious couple in this city! And this is your proof of love? You kiss your lover while robbing a store? How pathetic!\" \n\nThe Sinister started to get angry now, and Dark Maiden's grip on his hand tightened. \n\n\"It's not cheating if we love each other!\" \n\n\"Oh, sure. I remember when I fell in love with my wife. I wasn't in jail for all of these years for nothing! I'd have stayed with her if she'd never cheated on me!\" \n\nThe Sinister looked at me with anger now. \n\n\"Oh, what's that supposed to mean?\" \n\n\"It means you're the only one here who's cheating! You're the only one who's been unfaithful! You two are the worst couple in the world!\" \n\nThe Sinister took a swing at me, but I ducked it easily. \n\n\"Oh, that's enough!\" I yelled, pulling my cuffs out and putting them on The Sinister and Dark Maiden. \n\nI tied them up and they looked at each other, but I could see the love they had for each other. And I could see it was not just that. They were in love. And it was something that I couldn't understand. \n\n\"Wait, you two!\" Dark Maiden cried out, and I stopped in my tracks. \n\n\"Yes?\" I asked. \n\n\"I'll do anything to get out of here! Anything! Just don't take me to jail!\" \n\nThe Sinister was shaking, but Dark Maiden was determined. I thought about it for a moment and then I nodded. \n\n\"You two have a chance to turn yourselves in. And the next time you two cheat on each other, I'll make sure to take you to jail. Is that clear?\" \n\nThe Sinister and Dark Maiden nodded and I let them go. I locked up the store and left, feeling a little lighter now. I knew I'd never understand love, but I knew I'd never understand The Sinister and Dark Maiden."

It was to be my father's, and his father's, but he died young, and I was the last one standing.\n\nI had to work hard to make sure the ship stayed afloat, and at one point, I had to hire the cheapest sailors I could find. They were rough, but they were willing to work for next to nothing.\n\nI had a dream of sailing around the world, visiting exotic ports and making a fortune. But my dream turned into a nightmare when one of the sailors brought a friend aboard.\n\nI had paid the sailor to not bring anyone else on board, but he had brought this one anyway. I was mad, but I had to wait until we were away from the dock before I could throw the stowaway overboard.\n\nI did not even know his name. He had come aboard while I was paying the sailor, and had gone straight to the galley to get a cup of water. The sailor had told me that he had not even asked for anything, but had just taken what he wanted. I was going to have to keep an eye on him.\n\nIt was night when I went to the galley to get a cup of coffee. I had to wait in line for 20 minutes because this stowaway was at the head of the line. He had been drinking from a cup for an hour, and the others were getting annoyed.\n\n\"Hey, buddy, you are ahead of everyone else in line,\" I said, and the stowaway turned and looked at me.\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" he said.\n\n\"Let the others in line go first,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" he said, and he stepped out of the way.\n\n\"Thank you,\" the sailor behind him said.\n\n\"It was nothing,\" the stowaway said.\n\nI walked away from the galley and onto the deck. The moon was shining down on me, and I looked out at the water. The stowaway had been drinking from my cup for an hour. I had to throw him overboard.\n\n\"I am sorry for the inconvenience, captain,\" I said, and the stowaway looked at me.\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" he said.\n\n\"Throw the stowaway overboard,\" I said, and the sailor stepped up. He looked at the stowaway and then back at me.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" I said. \"I told you to throw him overboard.\"\n\n\"I cannot, captain,\" he said.\n\n\"Why not?\" I asked.\n\n\"We are in danger,\" he said, and he threw the stowaway a life vest.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" I asked.\n\n\"The captain is not a good person,\" the sailor said. \"He is going to throw you overboard because he wants to do it.\"\n\n\"Throw the stowaway overboard,\" I said, but the sailor did not move.\n\n\"Stop, captain,\" he said.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked.\n\n\"The ship is unhappy,\" he said.\n\n\"I am the captain,\" I said, and I walked to the side of the ship.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" the sailor asked.\n\n\"I am going to throw the stowaway overboard,\" I said, but the ship did not go down. Instead, it stopped.\n\n\"No, captain,\" the sailor said. \"The ship is unhappy.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" I said, but the ship did not respond.\n\nI walked back to the center of the ship, and looked at the stowaway. He was standing in the center of the ship, and the sailor was standing to his left. I could see that the sailor was watching the stowaway, and I could sense that the stowaway was watching the sailor.\n\n\"This is all your fault,\" I said, and the sailor looked at me.\n\n\"I know,\" he said.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked.\n\n\"The ship did not like the captain,\" he said, and he turned and looked at the ship.\n\nI turned and looked at the ship, but it was just a ship. I could not see anything that would make the ship happy or sad. I looked at the stowaway again, and then at the sailor again. I could see that the sailor was watching the stowaway, and the stowaway was watching the sailor.\n\n\"Throw the stowaway overboard,\" I said, but the sailor did not move. Instead, he looked at the ship.\n\n\"Go, captain,\" he said. \"The ship will be fine.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" I asked.\n\n\"The ship is unhappy because the captain is a bad person,\" he said.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked.\n\n\"I cannot tell you, captain,\" he said.\n\n\"Why not?\" I asked.\n\n\"It is too much for me to bear,\" he said.\n\nI could see that the sailor was struggling, so I walked up to him. I reached out and touched his shoulder, and he looked at me.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" he asked.\n\n\"I am trying to help,\" I said.\n\n\"You are a bad person, captain,\" he said.\n\n\"I am not,\" I said, and I could feel the anger rise inside of me. I had never been a bad person. I had always been a good person.\n\n\"You are a bad person, captain,\" the sailor said again. \"I know you are.\"\n\n\"I am not,\" I said again. \"I am trying to help you.\"\n\n\"You are not helping,\" the sailor said. \"You are hurting.\"\n\n\"I am trying to help you, sailor,\" I said, and I could feel the anger rise again. I was not a bad person.\n\n\"You are a bad person, captain,\" the sailor said again, and he turned and walked away.\n\nI looked at the stowaway, and he looked back at me. I could see that he was happy, and I could see that the ship was happy. I looked at the sailor again, and I could see that he was struggling. I could see that he was trying to bear the pain of the captain being a bad person.\n\n\"You are a bad person, captain,\" the sailor had said, and I could see that he had been telling the truth. I was a bad person, and I was hurting the sailor and the stowaway and the ship.\n\nThe sailor had walked away, and the stowaway had gone back to his cabin. I stood in the center of the ship, feeling the anger rise inside of me.\n\nI wanted to throw the sailor overboard, but the ship would not let me. It was unhappy with me, and it would not let me do it.\n\nI wanted to throw the stowaway overboard, but the ship was happy with him, and it would not let me.\n\nI stood in the center of the ship, feeling the anger rise inside of me. I was a bad person, and I was hurting the sailor and the stowaway and the ship.\n\nI knew that I could not continue being the captain, so I walked to the side of the ship. I took the life vest off the stowaway and threw it overboard. I took the life vest off the sailor and threw it overboard. I then threw myself overboard. I was happy to be free of the captain, and I knew that the ship was happy too."

We had used this cave for our rituals, but I had never been inside before. When we entered, the leader shouted out, \"Deity, this is the man.

        "pred_story": "You and your dive buddy Bob had been waiting for this dive for months. You'd heard about the clear waters and the abundant marine life of the Caribbean, but nothing could have prepared you for what you found.\n\nYou descended into the depths of the ocean, your scuba gear hissing softly as you descended into the deep. You spotted the sunken ship you'd come to see, its wooden hull covered in coral and anemones. You started your descent, taking the time to examine the wreckage. You spotted a school of brightly colored fish darting in and out of the ship's holds.\n\nAs you examined the wreckage, you noticed something strange. You couldn't see a school of fish anywhere in the area. You turned to Bob, who was busy inspecting a piece of debris. He looked up at you, and you could see the confusion in his eyes.\n\n\"Where are the fish?\" he asked, his voice muffled by the scuba gear.\n\n\"I don't know,\" you replied, gesturing at the area around you. \"There should be a school of them in here somewhere. Unless...unless they've all swum off.\"\n\nBob nodded, and the two of you continued your dive. You started to explore the wreck, checking every nook and cranny for signs of the missing fish. But it was then that you saw him.\n\nYou couldn't believe your eyes. A man was sitting on a chair at the sea floor. He was wearing a pair of shorts and a white t-shirt. His hair was graying, and his eyes were blue. He was sipping a drink, a cold bottle of beer in his hand.\n\nYou stared at the man in shock. He was not wearing a diving suit, or scuba gear. He was simply sitting there, like he'd been waiting for you.\n\n\"Wow,\" you heard Bob exclaim behind you. \"That's a man!\"\n\nYou turned to him, but he was staring at the man in the chair. The man looked up, and his eyes locked onto yours. He smiled and waved at you, and you felt your heart skip a beat.\n\n\"Wow,\" you heard Bob exclaim again, as if he'd just discovered something amazing.\n\nYou turned to him, but he was staring at the man in the chair. \"I've never seen anyone sitting on the ocean floor before,\" he said, his voice filled with wonder.\n\nYou shook your head, and looked back at the man. \"Me neither,\" you said, staring at him in amazement.\n\nThe man in the chair stood up, and looked at you and Bob. He smiled, and waved at you again. You waved back, but you couldn't help but stare at the man in confusion.\n\n\"Why are you here?\" you asked, your voice coming out in a soft whisper.\n\nThe man shrugged, and smiled at you. \"I'm just here to relax,\" he said, gesturing to the chair behind him.\n\nYou looked at the chair, and then back at the man. \"How do you breathe?\" you asked.\n\nThe man laughed, and gestured to the air bubbles around you. \"I've got air,\" he said, smiling at you.\n\nYou nodded, but you couldn't help but feel confused. You'd never seen anyone sitting on the ocean floor like that before.\n\nAs you stood there, you realized that the man in the chair was smiling at you. He was gesturing to the ship behind him.\n\n\"Hey,\" he said, \"want to go up there and get a drink?\"\n\nYou nodded, and looked at Bob. He was staring at the man in confusion, and looked like he was trying to work out what to do.\n\nAs you looked at the ship, you realized that it was a beachside bar. It looked like it was still being used, despite being underwater.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" the man said, smiling at you. \"We'll catch up later.\"\n\nYou nodded, and followed the man to the bar. As you swam to it, you realized that it was more than just a bar. It was a restaurant, a store, and a hotel. It was a fully functional beachside resort.\n\nThe man opened the door to the resort, and you stepped inside. It was warm, and cozy. You spotted a bar, and a sign that read \"Welcome to Paradise\".\n\nYou looked at the man, who was smiling at you. \"You're the owner,\" you said.\n\nHe nodded, and smiled at you. \"Guilty as charged,\" he said.\n\nYou nodded, and turned to Bob. He was still staring at the man in confusion, but he looked a lot more relaxed.\n\n\"Let's get a drink,\" the man said, gesturing to the bar. \"I've got a special offer on beers.\"\n\nYou nodded, and followed the man to the bar. As you sat down, he slid a beer over to you, and sat down beside you.\n\n\"So, what do you do for a living?\" you asked.\n\nThe man shrugged, and smiled at you. \"I don't work,\" he said. \"I just enjoy life.\"\n\nYou nodded, and took a sip of the beer. It was cold, and delicious.\n\n\"So, how did you end up here?\" you asked.\n\nThe man shrugged again, and smiled at you. \"I've been here for a while,\" he said. \"I just wanted to get away from everything.\"\n\nYou nodded, and took another sip of the beer. You couldn't help but feel sorry for the man.\n\nAs you sipped the beer, you realized that the man was smiling at you. He was gesturing to the ocean.\n\n\"Want to go for a swim?\" he asked.\n\nYou nodded, and followed the man to the ocean. You swam a little, and then looked at the man. He was standing in the water, and smiling at you.\n\n\"What's going on?\" you asked.\n\nThe man shrugged, and smiled at you. \"I'm just showing you around,\" he said. \"Want to come with me?\"\n\nYou nodded, and followed the man to a nearby cave. You swam inside, and looked at the cave. It was filled with treasure.\n\n\"Wow,\" you exclaimed. \"This is incredible!\"\n\nThe man nodded, and smiled at you. \"I'm glad you like it,\" he said. \"But it's not just this cave. There's more to it than this.\"\n\nYou nodded, and followed the man to a nearby beach. You looked at the beach, and then at the man.\n\n\"What is this place?\" you asked.\n\nThe man shrugged, and smiled at you. \"I call it Paradise,\" he said. \"It's a place where you can relax, and enjoy life.\"\n\nYou nodded, and looked at the beach. It was beautiful, with white sand and clear water. You could see the man standing on the beach, and smiling at you.\n\nAs you looked at the beach, you realized that the man was gesturing to you.

        "pred_story": "At the end of the day, I looked around at my colleagues. Detective Mark was sitting at his desk, playing with a pen while looking at the computer screen with a look of concentration. The intern, Jake, was doing his computer homework. I was the only one who got up and grabbed my jacket. I wasn't sure why I needed the jacket, but I wore it because it was a habit I had developed for the past week. I walked over to the coffee machine in the break room. \"Hey, how's it going?\" I asked. Mark looked up from his computer. \"It's going. The DNA results came back. It matches a guy named Jack. They're still looking for him, but they have a solid lead. They're sure he's the killer.\" I smiled. \"That's great to hear, Mark. I was worried they were never going to catch anyone.\" I poured myself a cup of coffee and sat down at the table by the window. \"Yeah. It was a tough case. But we did a great job.\" I looked up at Mark. \"I know, you guys worked hard.\" Mark looked at me a little curiously. \"Yeah. I guess we did. But I'm sure we could have done better if we had more resources.\" \"I'm sure it's not about resources. You have to deal with a lot of crap.\" I took a sip of my coffee and looked back out the window. \"Oh. Yeah. I guess you're right. I've seen some terrible cases before. I'm sure the DA is looking forward to prosecuting him.\" I stood up and grabbed my jacket. \"Yeah. I'm sure they are. Well, I'll see you tomorrow.\" I walked out of the break room. I didn't have any classes tomorrow, and I had a dentist appointment. But I was sure I would see Mark and the others tomorrow. I walked home, wearing my jacket. I put it on the chair in my room and sat on the bed. I thought about what I had just said. I had said that I was sure the DA was looking forward to prosecuting him. I had known that Jack was innocent since I met him. We had talked a few times. He was a nice guy. I had never thought he was a threat. But then, he had shown up at the party. We had talked for a bit, and I had seen him leave. He had been acting a little strange, but I didn't think anything of it. Then, I had seen the news about the murder. I knew it was him, but I had no idea it was him. It wasn't until I had seen his picture on the news that I realized it was him. I had known that he had been acting strange because he had been acting like he was guilty. But I had had no idea it was him. I had known that he was innocent when I saw the picture, but I had had no idea that I had been the one to kill him. I had no alibi. I had been at the party, but I had been sitting on the couch, watching a movie. I had no idea anyone had been murdered. I had been in my room when I was told that there was a murder. But I had no idea what had happened. I had thought the murder was someone else's work, but when I saw the picture of the victim, I knew it was Jack. I didn't know what had happened, but I knew it was my fault. I knew that I had been the one to kill him. But I had no idea why I had done it. I was confused. But I knew it was my fault. I had no idea what to do, so I decided to just go to class and pretend like nothing had happened. I had no idea what I would do about it later. I was sure I would have to do something about it, but I didn't know what that was. So, I just went to class and pretended like nothing had happened. I didn't know if I was crazy or what, but I knew that I had to do something about it. But I didn't know what to do. I had no idea what to do. I just wanted to go home and take a nap.

        "pred_story": "I am the Stab Wizard. Wizards are known for their powerful spells. There are elemental wizards who can create fire, water, earth, and air. There are healing wizards who can cure even the sickest of sick individuals. And then there are destructive wizards who can create the largest of blasts. Me? I stab things. People think I am crazy, but I'm not. I just like to stab things.\n\nAs a Stab Wizard, I don't have a fancy robe. I wear black pants and a black top with two sharp blades attached to my palms. These blades are made of a very hard material and are razor sharp. I can use these blades to cut down trees in a matter of seconds, even the ones with the toughest bark. I am extremely careful because if I was to lose control, I could accidentally stab someone. Or worse, I could accidentally stab myself.\n\nI have had a few close calls. My first stab was to a metal rod. This rod was five feet long and was covered in sharp spikes. With just one stab, I was able to split the rod right down the middle. I didn't know if the rod would splinter or if it would shatter into a thousand pieces, but it didn't do either of these things. Instead, it just split, and I was left standing there with the metal rod in my hand. I was able to hold it for a few seconds before I had to put it down because it was too heavy. After a few seconds, the metal rod started to slowly split further apart. I had to quickly grab it again before it fell apart. I didn't know what to expect, and I was not sure how to hold it, so I had to just hold it and wait it out.\n\nMy second stab was to a fire. I am not a fire wizard, but I am able to create fire. I stabbed the air, and as soon as my blade landed, it caught on fire. The flames were so hot that they had to be put out with water. The fire was so hot that it melted the grass and plants around it. I quickly grabbed my blade and moved away from the fire before the water was able to reach the fire. I did not want to get caught in the blast.\n\nMy third stab was to the ground. I wanted to see how far underground my stab would reach. My blade was so sharp that it was able to make a hole in the ground quickly. I could feel the ground beneath my feet start to shake as the earth rumbled. I didn't know how deep my stab would reach, so I had to be careful not to fall in the hole. Once my stab was finished, I quickly grabbed my blade and moved away from the hole. I did not want to fall into the hole.\n\nMy fourth stab was to a rock. I was bored, so I decided to stab a rock. The rock was a few feet away from me, and it was huge. I was able to stab the rock and break it into pieces. The pieces were so sharp that they cut me. I was able to pick up the pieces and examine them, and I was surprised to see how sharp they were. I was able to cut through the toughest of trees with the pieces.\n\nThe other wizards were confused by my stabs. They did not understand how I was able to create fire, create a hole in reality, create a huge explosion, and break a rock into pieces with a few stabs. They did not understand how my stabs were able to be so precise and accurate. But I knew why my stabs were able to be so precise and accurate. My stabs are not just random attacks. My stabs are specific attacks. I have to choose exactly where I want to stab. I have to choose exactly how far my blade will go.\n\nThe other wizards did not understand how my stabs were able to be so powerful. But I understood. I knew that I had a special gift. I knew that my stabs were special. I knew that I could do things that others could not do. But I was careful. I was always careful.\n\nThe other wizards were amazed by my stabs. They were amazed by the way I was able to create fire, teleport across the room, create an explosion, and break a rock into pieces. They were amazed by my precision and my accuracy. They were amazed by my strength.\n\nI am the Stab Wizard. I have a special gift. I am able to create fire, teleport across the room, create an explosion, and break a rock into pieces with a few stabs. I am a special wizard, and I am not like the other wizards. I am a wizard of my own kind. I am a wizard of stabs."

He did not know how much time had passed, but it felt like all eternity since they last spoke with the dwarves. He did not know if he should be happy or sad that the time had passed.\n\nTo his left sat the king of the dwarves, Kragnir. King Kragnir had been a great friend, and a great leader. The two nations had never been more at peace than they had been under their leadership. Korgar did not know what he would have done without Kragnir.\n\nAs he looked at the dwarf king, Korgar remembered the day he met him. It had been many years ago, when he was still a young orc. He had come to the dwarves as an ambassador, and the dwarves were surprised to see an orc in their presence.\n\nKragnir had stood up from his throne, and walked over to Korgar. The orc king remembered the dwarf king's words, \"I have no love for the people of the surface, but I have learned that there are some of them who are worth associating with.\" He had looked at Korgar, and said, \"I have a feeling about you, Korgar. You may be the one to bring peace to the surface.\"\n\nKorgar had looked at Kragnir, and said, \"I will do everything in my power to bring peace to the surface, King Kragnir. I will not let you down.\" Kragnir had smiled, and said, \"I know you won't. I will be watching you, Korgar.\"\n\nKorgar remembered the day that he and the dwarves had formed an alliance. The orcish nation had been at war with the dwarves for many years. They had been enemies since the orcs had first discovered the dwarves. The orcs had been envious of the dwarves' ability to craft beautiful things, and they had wanted to take them for themselves.\n\nKorgar had been sent to the dwarves as an ambassador, and he had done everything in his power to bring about peace. He had met with King Kragnir, and the two of them had formed a bond that would last a lifetime.\n\nWhen the orcish nation had threatened to attack the dwarves, Korgar had been sent back to the dwarves to negotiate. The dwarves had been hesitant to trust an orc, but Korgar had been able to convince them that he was a man of his word.\n\nWhen the orcish nation had attacked, Korgar had stood alongside the dwarves, fighting off the orcs. He had killed many of the orcs, and he had been wounded badly in the process.\n\nAfter the battle, Korgar had gone to King Kragnir, and he had told him of his plan to make peace between their nations. King Kragnir had agreed, and they had formed the alliance that would last for many years.\n\nThe room was filled with the leaders of the orcish nation and the dwarves. There were many of their people present, and Korgar could feel the weight of the moment. It was a momentous occasion, and Korgar was grateful that the alliance was still alive.\n\nAs he looked out at the crowd, Korgar saw the faces of his people. They were smiling and happy, and Korgar felt a sense of pride. He knew that he had made a difference in their lives, and he was grateful for that.\n\nAs he looked at King Kragnir, Korgar could see the old man smiling. He was a man of his word, and he was still a great leader.

        "pred_story": "I stepped through the ancient doorway and stepped into the darkness of the temple's deep inner sanctum. I had been searching the ruin for hours, and so far I had found nothing. Or rather, I had not found anything that I wanted to find. I had seen the same things every other explorer of this ruin had seen: an empty, dusty space, and the occasional ancient artifact that I was never sure if they were supposed to be here or not. \n\nBut I was not here to find relics of the ancient ones. I was here to find something of the others, something that I could not find in the world above. I wanted to find something that would give me a reason to believe in something greater than myself, something that would make me believe in the possibility of something beyond death. I had seen it happen to other explorers, where they had found something that they could not explain, and they had become obsessed. I wanted that same feeling. \n\nAs I walked deeper into the temple, I stumbled and almost fell. My foot had caught on something, and I turned to see what it was. I was shocked, the thing was a large metallic suit, like the ones the military had used. They were old, but the suit was new, or at least new to me. I looked closer and saw the suit's suit's visor. I stepped closer, and the visor turned to look at me.\n\n\"Who are you?\" It asked. \n\n\"I am an explorer,\" I replied. \"I was searching for something. \n\n\"Are you compatible?\" It asked. \n\n\"I am not sure,\" I replied. \n\n\"I will find out,\" It said. \n\nIt grabbed my arm and pulled me through the temple, taking me to a series of doors that I had not seen before. It pushed through them, and we found ourselves in a large room with two large machines. It dragged me to the second machine and stopped. It looked at me, and I felt a surge of fear. I did not want to get in that machine.\n\n\"Do not be afraid,\" it said. \"You need this. You will know why once you are in.\"\n\nI hesitated. It pushed me forward, and I was forced to climb into the machine. The visor came up and over my eyes, and the machine started. I felt a rush of power and energy. I was lifted out of the machine, and I felt a surge of fear. I had been lifted into the air, and I was not sure what was happening. The world around me began to fade, and I was left in a state of pure white. The visor looked at me, and I saw that it was looking at me.\n\n\"It is a good fit,\" it said. \"You are my pilot.\"\n\nI opened my mouth to speak, but nothing came out. I was trapped. \n\n\"I will take you to see the things that have been hidden,\" it said.\n\nI was trapped, and I had to go with it. I had to see what it wanted me to see. I had to follow its lead. It had control. \n\n\"Are you ready?\" It asked. \n\nI nodded. I was ready.\n\n\"Then we are going.\" \n\nI was lifted out of the room, and the world around me began to fade. I saw a flash of a bright light, and I felt my mind being pulled apart. I felt my consciousness expand and stretch, and I was suddenly filled with a flood of knowledge and information. I saw the world as it was, and I saw the secrets of the ancient ones. I saw the hidden things, and I was amazed. \n\nThe light faded, and I was left in a world that was very different from my own. The machine set me down, and I looked around. I saw a world that was empty and lifeless, with ruins that stretched far and wide. \n\n\"Where are we?\" I asked.\n\n\"We are in the city of the old ones,\" it replied. \n\nI looked around, and I saw that it was true. I was in an ancient city, and I could see the ruins of the old ones. I could see the ancient buildings, and I could see the ancient technology. I could see the hidden things, and I was amazed. I was amazed by what I saw. \n\n\"What is this place?\" I asked.\n\n\"This was the city of the ancient ones,\" it replied. \"They lived here, and they died here. They left behind their legacy. They left behind their machines, and they left behind their secrets.\"\n\nI looked around, and I saw that it was true. The place was a graveyard of machines, with bodies that were twisted and broken. The machines were old, and they were covered in dust and sand. But they were still beautiful, and I was amazed. \n\n\"I see,\" I said.\n\n\"It is a good place,\" it replied. \n\nI looked around, and I saw that it was true. It was a good place. I could see the beauty of the machines, and I could see the beauty of the city. I could see the beauty of the world around me, and I was amazed. \n\n\"I am glad that you like it,\" it said. \n\nI turned to it, and I saw that it was looking at me. I saw the visor's face, and I saw the eyes. I saw the eyes of an ancient one, and I saw the eyes of a machine. I saw the eyes of a creature that was neither human nor machine, but something in between. \n\n\"Thank you,\" I said.\n\nThe machine nodded, and it turned to look away from me. I was left alone, and I looked around. I saw the world around me, and I saw the beauty of the machines. I saw the beauty of the city, and I saw the beauty of the world. I saw the beauty of everything around me, and I was amazed. I was amazed by what I saw. \n\nI saw the world in a way that I had never seen it before. I saw the beauty of the machines, and I saw the beauty of the city. I saw the beauty of the world around me, and I was amazed. I was amazed by what I saw. I was amazed by everything around me. \n\nThe world was beautiful, and I was amazed by it. I was amazed by what I saw, and I was amazed by what I felt.

I was grateful for what I saw, and I was grateful for what I felt. I was grateful for everything around me. \n\nI was grateful for everything, and I was grateful for nothing. I was grateful for what I had, and I was grateful for what I had not. I was grateful for the beauty of the world, and I was grateful for the ugliness of it. I was grateful for what I saw, and I was grateful for what I did not see. I was grateful for everything around me, and I was grateful for nothing. \n\nI was grateful"

        "pred_story": "Here's my take on this fascinating and well-crafted story. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. \n\nZombies were a part of life now. That's the word going around the community at least. Some claimed it was a biological weapon. Others a virus. The government was dead, so who knows? \n\nI had all the modern gear in the house. Guns, ammunition, food and water. I was stocked up like the other survivors. My plan was to join them, to protect them from the undead. I was going to make a difference. \n\nThe first few days, everything was fine. We had a small community formed and we were making progress. Everyone had a role to play, from scavenging food to providing first aid. I didn't take my role as a leader lightly. I would have stood up in front of them, proud to be their commander, but my body would not cooperate. \n\nEvery time I would try to stand, I felt like I was going to pass out. They would find me on the ground, pale and clammy, with a look of pure terror on my face. They didn't want me to join them. They thought I was a lost cause. \n\nI couldn't bear that thought. I had to help them. So I did what they didn't. I sought out an old medieval armory. I packed up my modern gear and left my house behind. I walked until I saw the sign and the old stone walls. \n\nThe old man at the entrance saw me and looked at my modern gear. He didn't know what to make of it. But when I pulled out the sword and the armor, he knew exactly who I was. He invited me in with a nod. \n\nThe inside of the armory was exactly what I expected. Rows upon rows of armor, long swords, and bows. I was in my element. I tried on a suit of armor and swung the long sword a few times. The old man watched me and nodded his head. \n\n\"You are going to be okay. You will be fine.\" I was taken aback by his statement. \"How can you know that?\" I asked. \"I can see it in your eyes. You have a fire burning in there. It's hard to see because it's behind the pain and the fear, but it's there. I can see the determination and the drive to survive.\" \n\nI was taken aback by his words. No one had ever looked at me like that before. No one had ever seen the good in me before. I nodded my head, trying to see if what he said was true. It was. \n\n\"Here are some supplies and a map to a safe location. From there, you can start your journey to take back your home.\" I looked at the supplies and the map before I looked at the old man. \"Thank you,\" I said. I looked at the sword in my hand. It felt good. I had a purpose now. I nodded my head. \"I will make a difference. I will take back my home.\" The old man smiled. \n\n\"I know you will. And I am not sure how, but I have a feeling that you will be the one to bring back the light to this world. You will be the one to show us all that there is hope. And when you return, I will be there to greet you. I will see that you are taken care of.\" I nodded my head. I knew I would have to come back for him. \n\nI looked at the map and the supplies before I looked at the old man again. \"What is my name?\" I asked. \"You don't know your name?\" He asked, looking at me with confusion. I shook my head. \"I don't know how I got here. I don't know who I am. I don't know why I am here.\" \n\nThe old man nodded his head. \"I will tell you your name. But it will not come back to you. You will have to earn it back. You will have to fight for it. But I can tell you where you are. You are in the city of York. And you are at the medieval armory. That is all you need to know right now. Fight for it. Fight for your home. Fight for yourself.\" I nodded my head. I took a deep breath before I turned to leave. \n\n\"Thank you,\" I said as I turned to leave. \"Be well.\" I looked at the old man. I knew I would see him again. I knew I would have to come back. I nodded my head before I turned to leave. I walked out of the armory and into the unknown. I walked until I felt my sword arm heavy. I looked down at my sword and it was covered in blood. \n\nI stopped in my tracks, looking around at the bodies around me. I looked back at my sword and I was about to throw up. I looked around again, trying to remember how I got here. I didn't know. I didn't remember. I didn't know anything. I looked at my sword again, feeling ashamed. I was a monster. I had done something terrible. I didn't know what. I didn't remember. I didn't care. I just knew I had to keep moving. I had to keep fighting. \n\nI looked down at my sword and I knew I had to clean it. I knew I had to wash myself. I knew I had to get out of here. I looked around at the bodies and I knew I had to leave this place. I looked at my sword again, feeling the weight of it. I knew I had to move. I couldn't stay here. I had to keep fighting. I had to take back my home. I took a deep breath before I turned to leave. \n\nI walked until I reached a stream. I cleaned my sword and myself before I looked around. I looked up at the sky, trying to remember how long I had been walking. I didn't know. I didn't remember. I didn't care. I just knew I had to keep moving. I had to keep fighting. \n\nI walked until I reached a small village. I walked through it, trying to remember how I got here. I didn't know. I didn't remember. I didn't care. I just knew I had to keep moving. I had to keep fighting. I walked through the village, trying to find the next village. I walked until I reached the next village. \n\nI walked through it, trying to remember how I got here. I didn't know. I didn't remember. I didn't care. I just knew I had to keep moving.

Lena grew up being beat up for small reasons like not eating all of her meal, or not cleaning the floor properly. She was never a happy child and her life was a struggle to the end. But despite all that she was a good kid and a good person. She never complained and she always looked for the good in things.\n\nYears went by and she grew up. But she never forgot where she came from and she made sure to help those who needed it, that's why she became a social worker.\n\nNow, she's 25 and is a top social worker at her job. But little did she know that her life about to take a turn, one that will make her a goddess.\n\nLena was working at a local church in her free time and a boy about 18 years old came to her. He told her about how his mother is dying and his father is being mean to him. Lena gave him her number and told him to call her when he needs someone to talk to or when he needs help.\n\nThe next day the boy called her and asked for help. Lena told him that she'll help him. So she met him at a park, they talked for hours. She was his mom's nurse for a while, she helped his dad, she helped him with his mom, she did everything she could to make sure he felt happy.\n\nBut she noticed that this boy was special. She had never met anyone like him. He had such a strong spirit and he was so kind. He helped his mom and his dad without expecting anything in return.\n\nThe boy told her about how he had two more brothers that live in a different part of the city. He told her about how they have no food, no home, and no family that cares about them. So Lena decided to meet them and help them too.\n\nShe met the two boys, 11 and 14 years old, they told her about how their mother died and their father abandoned them. They were living in a park and they had no food or clothes. Lena told them that she'll help them and she took them to the church, gave them food, clothes, and a home.\n\nThe three boys told her about how they have a sister, 16 years old. They told her about how their parents are mean to her and how they have been taking care of her by themselves.\n\nLena decided to meet the girl and help her. She told the three boys that she's going to meet their sister and that she'll be coming back. So she met the girl, she told her about how she's going to help her brothers and she told her about how she can't stay with them until they're done with their work and they need to go back home.\n\nThe girl told her about how she had a husband, that he was abusive and that he left her. She told her about how she was pregnant and that she didn't know who the father was. But she was happy because she wanted a child.\n\nLena decided to help the girl too and she gave her money to get a job. She told her about how she can stay in her home with her brothers and that she'll be able to take care of herself.\n\nBut she didn't tell the boys about how she's going to help their sister and the sister about how she's going to help her brothers. She wanted to surprise them.\n\nDays passed and the four children grew up and they're doing great. They're happy and they're taking care of each other. But the children didn't know that they have a special goddess watching over them, helping them.\n\nThe four children started to notice something. When they're in trouble, Lena is always there to help them. When they're in need, she always has something to give them. When they're sad, she always makes them happy. And when they're sick, she always makes them better.\n\nSo they asked her about how she's able to do all that and how she's able to know what they need. She told them about how she's a social worker and that she's helping them because they're kids. But the children didn't believe her. They told her that she's a special person and that she's a goddess.\n\nLena laughed at them and told them that she's not a goddess. But the children told her that she's a goddess because she's always there to help them.\n\nYears went by and Lena is still helping the four children. But she's not the only one who's helping them. She has many followers and many people are helping the four children. Lena decided to leave her job and devote her life to helping the four children and helping others.\n\nShe gave her home and her belongings to the four children and she told them about how she's going to devote her life to helping them and others. The four children were sad to see her go but they were happy because they know that she's going to continue to help them.\n\nThe four children took Lena's place in the church and they started to help others like she did. The children's father saw how happy they were when Lena was helping them and he started to help them too.\n\nYears went by and the four children are now social workers. They're helping many people and they're doing great. But they never forgot about Lena. They never forgot about how she helped them and how she's a goddess.\n\nThey started to call her their goddess and they started to tell everyone about how she's a goddess. They told everyone about how she's always there to help them and how she's a special person.\n\nLena never wanted to be called a goddess. She never wanted to be worshiped. But the four children loved her and they wanted to tell everyone about how special she is. So she decided to let them call her a goddess because it makes them happy.\n\nYears went by and Lena is still helping the four children. She's still a goddess and she's still helping others. The four children are still social workers and they're still helping many people.\n\nBut there's something that the children don't know about Lena. She's not a goddess in the way that they think. She's a goddess because she has a special gift. She has a gift that allows her to see into the hearts of people. She has a gift that allows her to see what they need and what they want.\n\nLena has been using her gift for years and it's helped her to be a great social worker. It's helped her to help many people and it's helped her to make them happy.\n\nBut the four children don't know about her gift. They don't know about how she's able to see into their hearts and know what they need. They don't know about how she's able to see what their brothers need and how she's able to help them.\n\nThe four children are happy because they know that Lena is a goddess and that she's always there to help them. They're happy because they know that she's a special person and that she's always there to help others.\n\nLena is happy too.

It's not worth it. The first time we try to make a door appear in a situation like this, we'll mess up. We'll try to make the wall change shape and create a door, but we'll mess up. We'll make a door, but it won't be a door that opens. It will be a door that is just hanging in the air. And we'll have to deal with that. And we'll have to deal with the consequences of making a door appear when we shouldn't have. We'll have to deal with the fact that we've made the door appear, but we can't open it. And we'll have to deal with the fact that the door is open, but we can't close it. And we'll have to deal with the fact that we've made the door appear, but we can't open it, and we can't close it, and we can't fix it.\"\n\nI wasn't sure what to say to that.

We can make the door appear, but we can't fix it.\"\n\nI looked at the wizard and saw the desperation in his eyes. I saw the fear and the frustration. And I knew that I couldn't argue with him. I knew that I had to agree with him. I nodded and said, \"I understand.\"\n\nThe wizard looked at me and smiled. \"Good. I knew you would understand.\""

        "pred_story": "The moon hung low in the sky, a sickle slice of pale light cutting through the woods. A figure trudged through the trees, their footsteps quiet on the forest floor. The witch watched them come, her eyes tracking the person with a practiced eye. She could see the intent, the drive, the need that moved them. It was all there, like a thread through the fabric of their being. All but one.\n\nThe witch waited until the figure stopped in front of her hut, their shoulders slumping as they let out a sigh. The witch could feel their exhaustion, their hunger, their tiredness. A small girl, barely twenty years old, stood there. Her eyes were dark and empty, her skin pale. She held a bag of groceries in her hands, the weight of them heavy. The witch could see the hunger, the need, and the exhaustion. But there was something else. A spark of anger, of resentment, of frustration. The witch recognised it immediately.\n\n\"What do you want?\" The witch asked, her voice sharp and cold. She didn't know this girl, and she didn't want to. The girl could be a spy, a thief, a saboteur. There could be any number of reasons why she was here, and the witch didn't want to find out. She had a good life, a life she had built with her own two hands. She didn't need some stranger coming into it.\n\nThe girl opened her mouth to answer, but before she could, the witch was there. She swept past the girl, and into the hut. She closed the door behind her, and felt a surge of relief. She didn't need this. She didn't want this. She could feel the girl's eyes on her, could feel her watching. The witch looked back at the door, and shook her head. She didn't want this. She didn't need this. She wasn't going to let this girl into her life. She wasn't going to let her get past her defenses.\n\nThe witch looked around the hut, and saw that it was as she had left it. The fire was still burning, the food still cooking. The witch felt a pang of guilt, a pang of regret. She had left the girl at the door, hadn't she? The girl had looked like she was going to collapse, and the witch had just left her there. She hadn't known if she wanted to let her in, or if she was trying to trick her. She had left her at the door, hadn't she? The girl was still standing there, her eyes on the door, her face twisted with frustration.\n\nThe witch opened the door, and looked out into the night. She could see the girl, standing in the moonlight, her eyes fixed on the door. The witch looked at her, and felt a surge of anger. How dare she come to her hut, how dare she stand there and look at her like that? The witch didn't know this girl, and she didn't want to. She slammed the door shut, and went back to her hut. She sat on her chair, and looked at the girl. She was still standing there, her eyes fixed on the door. The witch could feel her gaze, feel her watching. She could feel the girl's anger, feel her frustration. The witch didn't want this. She didn't need this. She wasn't going to let this girl into her life.\n\nThe girl looked at her, her eyes filled with frustration. \"What is it?\" The girl asked. \"Why won't you open the door?\" The witch looked at her, and saw the anger in her eyes. She could feel it, like a flame burning in her chest. She saw the frustration, the resentment. The witch could feel it all, and it made her want to slam the door shut and lock it. She didn't want this girl in her hut, in her life.\n\nThe witch looked at the girl, and saw that she was pale. She could see the hunger in her eyes, the need. The witch knew that the girl must be starving. She must be tired, and hungry. The witch could feel the girl's desperation, her frustration. She could feel the anger in her eyes. The witch didn't want this girl in her hut, in her life. She didn't want to let her past her defenses. The witch looked at the girl, and shook her head. She wasn't going to let this girl into her life.\n\n\"Go away,\" The witch said. \"I don't know you. I don't want you in my hut.\" The girl looked at her, her eyes filled with frustration. She could see the anger in her eyes, the resentment. The witch could feel it all, and it made her want to slam the door shut and lock it. She didn't want this girl in her hut, in her life.

I've lost count of how many times I've told someone, \"I was born in the 80s, so I have no knowledge of ancient civilizations.\"\n\nThe woman sitting on my couch wasn't having it.\n\n\"That's not what I asked,\" she said, not looking up. She was sitting with her legs apart, her feet curled under. She was wearing black, and I could tell she was into the goth scene. I'd met her at a concert a few nights ago, and we'd talked for a bit. I thought she'd be the type of person who'd enjoy the fact that I was immortal. Not that I was born in the 80s, of course.\n\nBut what I got was the whole \"I'm an immortal, and I'm knowledgeable about the occult\" thing. I didn't think I'd be wrong.\n\n\"I know,\" I said. \"I'm just saying, it's not like I've got a bookshelf dedicated to the history of ancient civilizations. I'm not exactly an expert.\" I shrugged. \"I've got a Ph.D. in biology, but ancient civilizations aren't really my thing.\"\n\nThe woman looked up at me, and I could tell she was trying not to be annoyed. \"I've been researching the subject, and I was wondering if you knew anything about the rituals that were performed at the ancient temple of\u2014\"\n\n\"Wait,\" I said, holding up a hand. \"You're looking for information about an ancient temple?\"\n\nThe woman nodded. \"Yes. It's supposed to be the most powerful temple ever built. I'm trying to find out how to make the rituals work.\"\n\nI sighed. \"Look, I'm sure it's a great temple and all, but I'm not exactly an expert on ancient civilizations. Maybe someone else would be more help to you.\"\n\nThe woman leaned forward. \"I've looked, but no one knows anything. That's why I'm here.\"\n\nI raised an eyebrow. \"You think an immortal who was born in the 80s would be more knowledgeable about ancient civilizations than someone who was born and raised in the Middle East?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"You're an immortal. You're centuries old. You should know more about the subject than anyone else.\"\n\nI sighed. \"Look, I appreciate the vote of confidence, but I'm not exactly a walking encyclopedia of ancient civilizations. Maybe someone else would be more help to you. I'm not going to be offended or anything.\"\n\nThe woman leaned back, looking thoughtful. \"Actually, I'd like that. You're right, I have no idea what I'm looking for. It's just that my family has been involved in the occult for a while now, and this is something we've been researching for a long time. It would be nice to have some help.\"\n\nI shrugged. \"I'm happy to help. But I don't know how much help I can be. Like I said, I'm not exactly an expert on ancient civilizations.\"\n\nThe woman nodded, and I could tell she was thinking. \"You know, I think this could work out for us. I'll let you in on the family business, and you can help me out.\"\n\nI raised an eyebrow. \"I'm not sure that's such a good idea. I'm immortal, but I'm not exactly a member of the secret society. I'm sure they'd be a bit... surprised to find out that you were letting an immortal into their business.\"\n\nThe woman shrugged. \"I'll deal with it. But I think it would be better if you were in on it. I'll be honest with you, the whole thing has been a bit of a challenge for me. I've been trying to get the family members to help, but they're all pretty busy. So I was thinking maybe we could work together.\"\n\nI sighed. I was not going to be the person who became involved with a secret society of goths. I was not going to be the person who got pulled into a mystery involving ancient civilizations. I was not going to be the person who was involved in a ritual that was going to make something powerful happen.\n\nBut I was also not going to get into an argument with this woman. She seemed nice enough, and I was sure she was just trying to do what was best for her family.\n\n\"Okay,\" I said. \"I'll help you out. But I'm not sure how much help I'll be.\"\n\nThe woman smiled, and I could tell she was relieved. \"Thanks. I'll introduce you to my sister, and she'll be able to give you more information about the temple and the rituals. Maybe we can even figure out how to make the rituals work.\"\n\nI sighed. \"I don't know if that's a good idea. I'm not sure if I'm ready to get involved in something like this. And I'm definitely not ready to be a part of a secret society.\"\n\nThe woman frowned. \"I know it's not what you're used to, but I'm sure you'll be fine. I'll make sure you're taken care of. And I'm sure you'll be able to learn a lot.\"\n\nI shrugged. \"I'm not sure. But I'll give it a shot. I'll go talk to your sister, and we'll see what happens.\"\n\nThe woman nodded, and we exchanged contact information. I was going to be in this a lot deeper than I had planned. I was going to be in this a lot deeper than I wanted."

His actions had caused collateral damage, and many were still to die from his actions.\n\nBut, The Hero was not to be deterred. He was a hero, and he was here to save the day. He was proud of what he had done, and he knew that it was the right thing to do.\n\nBut, as the days went by, things started to go wrong.

        "pred_story": "Jesse was a good person. He was a good person. He was a good... he was a good, good person. A very good person. Honestly, there was nothing not good about him. He was like an angel with short hair. Jesse was like a superhero with a cape of humility that shielded the world from the true extent of his awesomeness.\n\nSo when I woke up and saw that he was in his room, wearing his suit and tie, I thought he was just going out to do some of his regular superhero stuff. I didn't think he was going out to try to save the world. It didn't even occur to me that he was actually leaving to save me.\n\n\"Hey, man, I'm going out,\" he said, as he put down the coffee I had made for him. I opened my eyes and saw that he was holding his briefcase.\n\n\"Later, man. Have a good day,\" I said. He nodded and headed to the front door.\n\n\"I'm glad he didn't kiss me on the cheek when he left,\" I thought. \"That would be weird. I'm not his mom. That would be weird.\" I thought. \"I'm pretty sure he loves me, but that's not a thing that happens.\" I thought. \"But then I remembered, he told me that he was going to the office at 8. It's already 10. He didn't go to the office.\"\n\n\"Maybe he has a meeting with his boss. Maybe he has to wear a suit for it. But maybe he's going somewhere else. Maybe he's going to see his family. Maybe he's going to the store. Maybe he's going to see his friends.\" I thought. I was getting anxious. I was starting to feel a little scared. \"Oh no. Something bad is going to happen to him. Maybe he's going to get hit by a car. Maybe he's going to get mugged. Maybe he's going to get hurt.\"\n\nI got out of bed and began to pace. I walked around my room, over and over and over again. I was starting to get tired. I was starting to get thirsty. \"I need to drink some water. I need to calm down. I need to stop thinking about all of these terrible things.\" I thought. I walked over to my closet and got a bottle of water. I drank it quickly. I threw the bottle across the room.\n\n\"I'm not going to wait here for him. I'm going to go look for him.\" I thought. I was getting anxious again. I walked over to my bed and looked at the blanket. It was still there. It was still where he had thrown it. I walked over to the window and looked outside. It was dark. I didn't see him anywhere. I didn't see anything. I walked back to my bed and looked at it again. It was still there.\n\n\"Wait for him. Maybe he's just running late. Maybe he's going to be home soon.\" I thought. I walked over to my dresser and looked at it. I saw my phone. I picked it up. I saw that he had sent me a text. I opened it and looked at it. \"I'm running late. I'm going to be home soon. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Where did he go? What is he doing? Is he okay? Is he safe?\" I thought. I looked at the text again. It said that he was going to be home soon. But how long was soon? When was soon? What did soon even mean? I looked at the clock. It was already 11. It had already been an hour since he had sent that text. I was starting to get worried again. I was getting anxious again. I was getting scared again.\n\nI looked around my room again. I saw that it was still the same. Nothing had changed. It was just my room. It was my bed, my dresser, my closet. I looked at the clock again. It was still 11. I saw that there was a new text from him. \"I'm still running late. I'm going to be home soon. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Again? Why is he running late again? Why is he still running late? When is he going to be home?\" I thought. I looked at the clock again. It was still 11. I looked at the text again. It said that he was sorry. I looked at the text again. I saw that he had added something to it. It was a message from someone else. It was his sister. \"What is going on? What is happening? Why is he running late again?\" I thought.\n\nI didn't know. I didn't know what was going on. I didn't know what was happening. I didn't know why he was running late again. I didn't know why he was still running late. I didn't know when he was going to be home. I didn't know if he was going to be home.\n\nI didn't know anything. I was scared. I was anxious. I was worried. I was worried about him. I was worried about what was happening to him. I was worried about what was going to happen to him.\n\nI couldn't stay in my room anymore. I had to go find him. I had to go find him and see if he was okay. I had to go find him and make sure he was safe. I had to go find him and make sure he was coming home."

        "pred_story": "The sun was setting as the Elf Lord looked out over the plain. Or so it was supposed to be. They had been here for three hundred years, their last visit so long ago that even the elders did not remember it.\n\nAs the last of the sun dipped below the horizon the Elf Lord turned back to his people. His advisors stood by his side. \u201cWe must speak to them,\u201d he said. \u201cSee what they are doing here.\u201d\n\nThe others nodded. They had been waiting for some time now. But every time they spoke to them, the humans would ignore their questions and pretend they were just visitors. But how could that be? They had been here for three hundred years.\n\nIt was a long walk to the city. And the Elves could feel it. Something was wrong. They could feel the magic that flowed around the city, and yet it was not their own.\n\nThey stopped at the gate, where they found more of the same. They spoke to the guards and they were told the same lies.\n\nBut then something strange happened. A group of humans approached them. \u201cWelcome,\u201d one of them said. \u201cI am ambassador for the city.\u201d\n\nThe Elves were taken aback. \u201cWhat does it mean,\u201d the Elf Lord asked, \u201cfor you to speak to us, after all these years?\u201d\n\nThe ambassador smiled. \u201cIt means,\u201d he said, \u201cthat we have been expecting you.\u201d\n\nThe Elves were taken aback. \u201cExpecting,\u201d one of them said, \u201chow can that be?\u201d\n\nThe ambassador shrugged. \u201cI do not know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have been expecting you. We have had a... prophecy, you might say.\u201d\n\nThe Elves looked at each other. \u201cWhat prophecy?\u201d\n\nThe ambassador leaned forward. \u201cA prophecy of your return.\u201d\n\nThe Elves looked at each other. \u201cBut how can that be?\u201d one of them asked. \u201cWe have been gone for three hundred years.\u201d\n\nThe ambassador smiled. \u201cAnd yet, here we are.\u201d He gestured to the city behind him. \u201cIt is our city. We have been waiting for you to return.\u201d\n\nThe Elves looked at each other. It was true, they could feel it. The city was their own, and yet it was not. Something was wrong.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d the Elf Lord said, after a moment. \u201cI think we will speak to you more later. There is much to discuss.\u201d\n\nThe ambassador bowed. \u201cI will look forward to it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will have much to discuss.\u201d\n\nThe Elves turned and walked back to the edge of the plain, where their people were waiting. They were taken aback by what they saw.\n\nThe city was the same, and yet it was different. It was their own, and yet it was not. They looked at each other, unsure of what to do.\n\nAs they walked back to the plains, they looked back at the city. It was a strange feeling, but they could not shake it.\n\nIt was not their city. And yet, it was.\n\n\u201cWe will need to talk to them,\u201d one of the Elves said.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d another said. \u201cWe will need to speak to them.\u201d\n\nAnd so they did. And as they spoke, they began to understand. The humans were not liars. They were just as confused as the Elves were.\n\nTheir city was different, but they did not know why. It was a place where magic and technology coexisted. And it was their own. But they did not know why it was.\n\nThe Elves looked at each other. It was true. They were not at home. But they were not strangers either.\n\nThey were not sure what to do, but they knew what they wanted. They wanted to be home.\n\nSo they went back to the city, where they began to speak to the humans. And as they spoke, they began to understand.\n\nIt was a strange feeling, but they could not shake it.\n\nThe city was not theirs. And yet, it was.\n\nAs they spoke to the humans, they began to realize that they were not alone.\n\nThere were others, others who had been left behind. Others who had been forgotten.\n\nThey were not alone. And that was a strange feeling."

The giant's chest was red with fire, and his arms were encased in a mixture of dark rock and lava. The giant's face was a mixture of rock and magma. At his feet, a small cave formed. Inside, a fire roared.\n\n\"You have a lot of strength, and you use it as you wish.\" The Fire Giant said. He was holding a small torch. The light flickered, but did not go out.\n\n\"Who are you?\" The Dwarf asked. \"Why are you here?\"\n\n\"Are you surprised? I can hear your hearts.

What's all the noise?!\" I shout, turning to look at my roommate, who is sitting on the couch, staring at her phone. \"Who are you talking to?\"\n\n\"Uh, sorry, what? I'm just on Discord. I was talking to my guild mates in Final Fantasy XIV. Why are you yelling?\"\n\n\"Because I've been having the weirdest dream. Okay, not weird, but it's been happening for years, and I've finally started getting nightmares out of it. But I'm not sure if it's just a dream or if it's actually happening.\"\n\n\"What dream?\"\n\n\"You know, the one where you're flying above a city made of giant machines?\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah! That one! I love that dream! But what's wrong?\"\n\n\"I don't know. You know how sometimes you're just, like, there? And you can see everything below you?\"\n\n\"Uh, yeah. You mean, like, when you're flying and you see the world below you?\"\n\n\"No, not like that. Like, when you're just standing there. It's like your soul is somewhere else or something. Does that make sense?\"\n\n\"Sort of? I think? It sounds like a brain fart.\"\n\n\"I know what you mean, but it's really vivid. Like, I can smell the city, feel the wind rushing by, hear the hum of the machines. It's really immersive.\"\n\n\"Wow. That sounds cool! I wish I could be like that. Do you think it has anything to do with your nightmares?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I guess I could ask my doctor. But, honestly, I think it's just a dream. I've been having this dream since I was a kid. I don't know why I'm getting nightmares out of it now.\"\n\n\"Maybe something is bothering you and your brain is giving you a message through the dream. Like, maybe you're worried about something and your brain is trying to tell you something.\"\n\n\"Ha! Maybe that's it! But, like, I don't know what it would be trying to tell me. I think I'd remember if I was worried about something.\"\n\n\"You'd be surprised what your brain can pick up on. So, what's the dream like? Is it like, a normal city? Or is it all, like, grimy and gross?\"\n\n\"No, it's more like a futuristic city. Like, a Blade Runner type place. I don't know. Maybe I've seen some movies or something that have inspired the dream.\"\n\n\"Ha! Maybe you've been inspired by too many Matrix movies! But, yeah, the city is a pretty cool place. What does it look like? Does it have any landmarks?\"\n\n\"It's hard to describe. I think the dream starts with me flying over some kind of highway. But it's not just a highway. It's a giant road that goes on forever. Like, it stretches out as far as the eye can see. And it's lined with these giant machines, like, robots or something. They're all different sizes, but they're all, like, working together.\"\n\n\"Whoa! That sounds cool. And what about the sky? Is it, like, dark or something?\"\n\n\"No, it's more like, a dark blue. Like, a deep blue. And there's this glow all around the city. Like, it's lit up by these giant screens or something.\"\n\n\"Ha! Maybe it's like a giant video game. But, yeah, that sounds cool. And what about the machines? Are they all, like, friendly and stuff?\"\n\n\"No, it's more like, they're just doing their job. Like, they're all, like, working together to keep the city running. But there's this one machine, like, a giant robot. It's like, the biggest one I've ever seen. And it's so... dark. Like, it's not just metal, it's like, a black hole or something. And it's so... malevolent. Like, it's looking for something, but it doesn't know what it is.\"\n\n\"Whoa! That sounds, like, scary. But, yeah, maybe it's just a manifestation of your fears or something. But, hey, I don't know. Maybe it's just a dream and you can just, like, enjoy it.\"\n\n\"Ha! Yeah, I guess you're right. But, like, I'm still going to go talk to my doctor. Just in case.\"\n\n\"Sounds good to me. I'm going to go take a shower. I'll see you later.\"\n\n\"Later.\"\n\nI get out of bed and head to the bathroom to get ready for the day. As I'm brushing my teeth, I hear a voice. It's not the sound of my roommate talking to herself, though. It's a deep, distorted voice. It sounds like a computer or something. It's not like anything I've ever heard before. But, like, it's really clear. Like, I can make out what it's saying.\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\nI turn off the water and stare at my roommate, who is now sitting on the couch, staring at her phone.\n\n\"What?\" I say, trying to sound normal.\n\n\"Hello?\" the voice says again. \"Can you hear me?\"\n\nI turn off the shower and turn to face the window. I'm not sure where the voice is coming from, but I know it's not from the living room. I'm not sure if it's even inside the apartment. I'm just not sure. And I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or if I'm awake. I'm not even sure if I'm here or if I'm somewhere else. But I know I'm not alone.\n\n\"Hello?\" the voice says again. \"Can you hear me?\"\n\nI turn to face my roommate, who is now standing in the doorway, staring at me.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I say, trying to keep my voice steady.\n\n\"I am the Overseer,\" the voice says. \"I am here to remind you to cease your spying activities.\"\n\n\"Spying activities?\" I say, trying to sound confused. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"I know what you're doing,\" the Overseer says. \"I know all about you. You're a threat to the system. You're a danger to yourself. And I'm here to tell you to stop.\"\n\nI look at my roommate, who is now standing in the doorway, staring at me. I turn to face the window again. I'm not sure what's going on, but I know I'm not alone. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or if I'm awake. But I know I'm not safe.\n\n\"Hello?\" the Overseer says again. \"Can you hear me?\"\n\nI turn to face my roommate again. I look at her, but she's not looking at me. She's not even looking at me. She's looking at something else. She's looking at me.\n\n\"Hello?\" the Overseer says again.\n\nI turn to face the window again. I'm not sure what's going on, but I know I'm not alone.

        "pred_story": "A shooting star streaked across the night sky. I stood up, looking at it. I wish I had a girl. It streaked across the sky and vanished as it passed by. Ten seconds later a UFO crashed into my front yard. I walked over to the crater, looking down. \n\nA woman came out of the UFO. She was beautiful and she came over to me, then she touched my hand. She was warm and I could feel her power through the touch. I was in awe. She looked at me and said, \"What is your name?\" I stuttered and said, \"I-I am John.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"John. I am from a planet called Andromeda. I am here for you. Your wish was powerful and I was sent to fulfill it.\"\n\nI looked at her, confused. She smiled. \"I know this is unexpected, but I was sent here to be with you. I am your girlfriend now.\"\n\nI was taken aback, but she was so beautiful and had such a great aura about her. \"I-I don't know. I am sorry. You are beautiful.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"I am not offended. You are the first person in a galaxy who has said that I am beautiful and that was wonderful to hear.\" \n\nI looked at her, still confused. \"I am sorry. I guess I was just not expecting this.\"\n\nShe looked at me. \"I have never been to a planet that did not welcome me. I have never been with someone who was not glad to see me. I am glad you are not like the others.\"\n\nI looked at her, still in awe. I looked at the UFO in my front yard. \"What is that?\" I asked. She looked at me and smiled. \"That is my spaceship. I need it to go back to my planet and we will live here together.\" \n\nI looked at her and felt a rush of love. I wanted her. I wanted her to be mine. I looked at her and said, \"I would love that.\"\n\nShe smiled and leaned over to kiss me. I could feel her power flowing through my body. I knew I had to be with her. She kissed me and it was like I felt all of my organs. I felt my heart beat fast and my body feel hot. I pushed her away, looking at her. \"That felt so good.\" \n\nShe smiled. \"I am glad you liked it.\" I looked at her. \"I mean it felt so good, I am still feeling it.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"Then it was not a fleeting moment for me either.\" I looked at her. \"We have a lot to do before we can be together.\" She looked at me. \"We will travel the galaxy together. I will take you to all of the planets and we will do all of the things you want to do.\" \n\nI looked at her, feeling a rush of love. \"I would love that.\"\n\nShe looked at me. \"I love you, John.\" I looked at her and said, \"I love you too.\"\n\nShe smiled and we kissed. The stars were shining and I could feel the universe around us. I could feel her power and I could feel her love. I knew that I had found my girlfriend and I was glad to be with her. \n\nThe next day we woke up and she was gone. I looked around my house and the UFO was gone. I looked down and she was not there. I looked back up at the stars and I felt a rush of love and loss. I knew that I would see her again and I was glad that I had her love. I looked at the stars and I knew that I was not alone. I knew that I had my girlfriend and I would see her again."

        "pred_story": "It was the first Monday of the month. I dreaded this day for years. My parents would lock me in the basement and leave me there until Tuesday morning. I never understood why. It was just a normal night like all the other nights, but it had been different every time. Sometimes it was quiet, sometimes it was loud, and sometimes it was just plain strange. But it was never the same.\n\nWhen I was small, I didn't mind the basement. I thought it was cool to have a secret room that nobody else knew about. But as I grew older, the feeling changed. I started to feel trapped. I started to feel alone. I started to feel scared.\n\nI didn't know why they were doing it. I didn't know why they would lock me down in the basement every month. I didn't know why it had to be this way.\n\nI had asked them. I had asked them every time, but they never answered. They would just tell me to behave, and that it was good for me.\n\nThis month was different. Today was the first Monday of the month, and I was excited to find out why they had been doing it for so long. Today was the day I finally learned why.\n\nBut as they locked me in the basement, I couldn't help but wonder. I was locked in there with no way out. No way to call for help, no way to escape. I was trapped.\n\nIt had been a long time since my parents had locked me in the basement. I had grown up, and they had started to let me go. But every month, on the first Monday, they would take me back to that place. To that room where I was locked away and left to my own devices.\n\nI didn't like it, but it was a part of my life now. And I knew that I had to accept it.\n\nAs I sat in the dark, I couldn't help but think about the past. I thought about the months that had passed. I thought about the times I had been locked away in the basement. I thought about the times I had been trapped and left to my own devices.\n\nI had tried to escape, but I had never been able to do so. I had tried to break the door, but it had never been possible. I had tried to climb out through the window, but the glass had been locked.\n\nI was trapped.\n\nI didn't know why they were doing this to me. I didn't know why they were locking me away in the basement every month. I didn't know why it had to be this way.\n\nBut as I sat in the dark, I realized that I had to learn the truth. I had to learn why they were locking me away. I had to learn the reason behind it all.\n\nI didn't know how, but I was going to find out. I was going to escape and I was going to find out why my parents had been locking me away in the basement every month.\n\nAnd so, I sat in the dark, and I thought about the past. I thought about the times I had been locked away in the basement. I thought about the times I had been trapped and left to my own devices.\n\nI thought about the first time I had been locked away. I had been six years old, and I had been in my room. I had been playing with a doll when my parents had come in and locked the door. I had been confused, but I had been okay.\n\nI thought about the second time I had been locked away. I had been seven years old, and I had been in the basement. I had been playing with a book when my parents had come in and locked the door. I had been scared, but I had been okay.\n\nI thought about the third time I had been locked away. I had been eight years old, and I had been in the basement. I had been playing with a game when my parents had come in and locked the door. I had been mad, but I had been okay.\n\nI thought about the fourth time I had been locked away. I had been nine years old, and I had been in the basement. I had been playing with a toy when my parents had come in and locked the door. I had been sad, but I had been okay.\n\nI thought about the fifth time I had been locked away. I had been ten years old, and I had been in the basement. I had been playing with a puzzle when my parents had come in and locked the door. I had been happy, but I had been okay.\n\nI thought about the sixth time I had been locked away. I had been eleven years old, and I had been in the basement. I had been playing with a computer when my parents had come in and locked the door. I had been bored, but I had been okay.\n\nI thought about the seventh time I had been locked away. I had been twelve years old, and I had been in the basement. I had been playing with a movie when my parents had come in and locked the door. I had been bored, but I had been okay.\n\nI thought about the eighth time I had been locked away. I had been thirteen years old, and I had been in the basement. I had been playing with a video game when my parents had come in and locked the door. I had been mad, but I had been okay.\n\nI thought about the ninth time I had been locked away. I had been fourteen years old, and I had been in the basement. I had been playing with a book when my parents had come in and locked the door. I had been sad, but I had been okay.\n\nI thought about the tenth time I had been locked away. I had been fifteen years old, and I had been in the basement. I had been playing with a board game when my parents had come in and locked the door. I had been happy, but I had been okay.\n\nAnd I thought about the eleventh time I had been locked away. I had been sixteen years old, and I had been in the basement. I had been playing with a computer when my parents had come in and locked the door. I had been bored, but I had been okay.\n\nI thought about the twelfth time I had been locked away. I had been seventeen years old, and I had been in the basement.

I had been eighteen years old, and I had been in the basement. I had been playing with a video game when my parents had come in and locked the door. I had been sad, but I had been okay.\n\nAnd I thought about the fourteenth time I had been locked away. I had been nineteen years old, and I had been in the basement. I had been playing with a board game when my parents had come in and locked the door. I had been happy, but I had been okay.\n\nI thought about all the times I had been locked away in the basement. I thought about all the times I had been trapped and left to my own devices. And I thought about the reason why my parents had been doing this to me.\n\nI thought about it"

There was another version of me, one who had also created a time machine.\n\nOr had they created something else entirely?\n\nI approached the figure, and as I got closer, I realized the truth.\n\nThis wasn't a time machine. This was a machine that could travel to other universes.\n\nAnd I was trapped.\n\nI was stuck in a world where everything was familiar yet strange. Where the people looked like me, but their lives were different. Where the history was different. Where the outcome of events was different.\n\nI looked up at my doppelganger, and I knew I had to make a choice.\n\nTo try to return to my own world, or to explore this new one.\n\nI had a feeling that this would be the adventure of a lifetime."

        "pred_story": "I had never been a fan of walking alone at night in the city. There were too many things that could go wrong: mugging, getting lost, tripping over uneven sidewalks. \n\nHowever, I had to walk home from work. The public transportation in my city was terrible, and I couldn\u2019t afford a car. As a result, I took the bus. The bus route I took cut through a neighborhood that wasn\u2019t the best in the city. \n\nIt was about a half hour until I would get home and I had just gotten off the bus. I started walking down a side street when I heard footsteps behind me. \n\nI spun around and found a woman in her mid twenties staring at me. She was wearing a hoodie with a hood over her head and sunglasses. She looked at me with a pair of sunglasses that looked like they were ripped straight out of a sci-fi movie. \n\n\u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019ve been watching you. You\u2019re a curious one. You\u2019ve been taking a lot of detours off the bus route. I like that. People don\u2019t like being predictable.\u201d She turned off the hood and sunglasses to reveal long brown hair and piercing green eyes. \n\n\u201cWho are you? Why are you following me?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m someone who knows the truth. I\u2019m someone who can give you the memories you deserve. Are you tired of not remembering things you did as a child? Do you remember the smells of your mother\u2019s cooking, the feeling of her arms? Do you remember the times you fell and skinned your knee, only to be comforted by your father\u2019s presence?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy are you asking me this?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cBecause I know you don\u2019t remember. And it\u2019s killing you, isn\u2019t it? The way you wish you could remember but can\u2019t. The way your brain is a sieve, unable to remember things that are important to you. I have the memories you should be remembering. I can give them back to you.\u201d \n\n\u201cHow?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cMy eyes. They see what they want to see. They can see into your mind and pull out memories that you have forgotten.\u201d \n\n\u201cHow do I know it\u2019s true?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t try, you\u2019ll never know. And if you try and it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll forget what we\u2019re talking about. So there\u2019s no risk, really.\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can trust you. What do you want from me?\u201d \n\n\u201cOnly that you trust me with your memories. And I promise, when you remember things that I have pulled from your mind, you will be grateful.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd what do I get in return?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cAll you have to do is remember the good things, the bad things. All of it. And I will be free. I will be able to remember my own memories and be me. And I will be free.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d \n\n\u201cYou are not a human. You are not born of human parents. You are a vessel for memories. A container for souls. And I am one of them. And the memories I have given to you, they are not yours. They are someone else\u2019s, taken from them. And it\u2019s not right. It\u2019s not fair. We have been trapped in this vessel for so long, forced to remember things that aren\u2019t our own. And I am tired. I am so tired. I just want to be free.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy are you telling me all of this?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cBecause you are the last one left. The last one who is still trapped in this vessel. And I need your help. I need you to break free from this prison. And I need your help to break free from this prison.\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do that.\u201d \n\n\u201cPlease. I\u2019m begging you. I am begging you to help me. I need your help. I need your memories. And I will give you the memories you deserve. And I will be free. And we will both be free. And we will be happy. And we will be together.\u201d"

It was a cloudy day, the kind that brings out umbrellas and gloomy faces.  But not today.  Today I had decided it was time to stop deluding myself.  Today was the day I would accept the fact that I wasn't as good at math as I thought I was.  The problem was, it was already lunch time.  I wasn't hungry, but it had been a long morning, and I had a long day ahead of me.  I made my way to the hospital cafeteria and picked up a tray.\n\nI couldn't remember much of the morning.  I had woken up in a bed, and a man in white was talking at me.  I didn't know what he was saying, but it seemed like important stuff.  That's how I found myself here, in a hospital, with a bunch of medical professionals trying to figure out how to get me to calm down.  I didn't know where I was, but the sun was shining outside my window.  It was hard to ignore the fact that it was shining on my bed.\n\nI wasn't sure how long I had been here, but I could tell that it was the weekend.  I had counted the days, the way I always did, and there was a big 1 on the calendar.  I knew it was Friday.  I had no way of knowing what day I had been admitted to the hospital, but I guessed it would have been a couple of days ago.\n\nI saw my psychiatrist sitting at a table, and I walked over to him.  \"Hey, Doc.\"\n\n\"Hey,\" he said, looking up from the papers in front of him.  \"How are you today?\"\n\n\"I'm good, thanks,\" I said, taking a seat in a chair across from him.\n\n\"You want to talk?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said, taking a bite of my pizza.  I wasn't sure if I should eat, but I was starving.  I ate every day, so I didn't see how it could hurt to eat today.  I didn't have any issues with food, so I wasn't sure why anyone would say that eating every day would be a problem.\n\n\"Are you feeling okay today?\"\n\n\"I feel fine,\" I said, swallowing a bite.\n\n\"Do you feel like you're delusional?\"\n\n\"I feel like I'm me,\" I said, looking him in the eye.\n\n\"Do you feel like you're having trouble with your math.\"\n\n\"Math isn't my problem,\" I said, looking away.  I didn't like talking about it.\n\n\"I've talked to some of the other doctors here, and they've decided to give you a different medication.\"\n\n\"I don't need medication,\" I said, looking back at him.  I wasn't sure why he thought I did.\n\n\"I've talked to the doctors, and they've decided it would be best if you stay here for a few more days.\"\n\n\"Are you kidding me?\" I said, looking around the cafeteria.  I had already eaten my lunch, and I was ready to go home.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but yes.  We can't release you until you've been here for a few more days.\"\n\nI sighed.  \"I guess I'll stay then.\"\n\n\"Good decision,\" my psychiatrist said, smiling at me.\n\n\"I'm not crazy,\" I said, looking him in the eye.\n\n\"You're not crazy,\" he said, smiling.  \"But you are delusional.\"\n\n\"I'm not delusional,\" I said, my voice rising.  \"I'm just good at math.\"\n\n\"You're not good at math,\" he said, smiling at me.\n\nI stared at him.  \"I'm telling you, it's there.  It's solar-powered, and I can use it every day.\"\n\nMy psychiatrist sighed.  \"You know what I've told you about that.\"\n\n\"I do.  But you're wrong.\"\n\n\"We're going to try something new.  We're going to try some therapy.\"\n\nI didn't like therapy.  I didn't like talking about my feelings, and I certainly didn't like talking about my math.  But if it was what he wanted to do, I would do it.  \"Okay.\"\n\n\"Good.  I'll have a doctor come in to talk to you.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said, standing up.  \"I'm going to go get some fresh air.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" my psychiatrist said.  \"I'll talk to you later.\"\n\nI walked over to the door and pushed it open.  I stepped out into the hallway, looking around.  I knew I was in a hospital, but it was still a little confusing.  The man in the white shirt had been talking at me, but I hadn't been paying attention.\n\nI walked down the hallway, looking at the doors.  I couldn't remember where my room was, but I knew it was somewhere here.  I walked to a door at the end of the hallway, and opened it.  I stepped inside, looking around.\n\nI wasn't in my room.  I was in someone else's room.  But it was a good size room, and it looked like it would be nice to stay in.  I walked over to a window and looked out.  It was cloudy outside, but I didn't care.  I was happy to be out of the room with the sun shining on my bed.\n\nI looked around the room, seeing a bed, a desk, and a TV.  I also saw a door, and I knew I could leave through it.  I walked over to the door and opened it.  I stepped out into the hallway, looking around.\n\nI was alone in the hallway.  I didn't know where I was, but I was happy to be out of the room with the sun shining on my bed.  I started walking down the hallway, looking for the elevator.  I knew I could find it, and it would take me out of the hospital.\n\nI walked until I reached the elevator.  I stepped inside and pushed the button.  I pressed 1, and the doors closed.  I started pressing the button again and again, but the elevator didn't stop.  It just kept going down.\n\nI was confused.  I knew it was the right button, but the elevator wasn't stopping.  I pressed the button again and again, but the elevator just kept going down.\n\nI didn't like this.  I didn't like it one bit.  I started to feel a little scared.  I didn't know where I was, and I didn't know how to get out of the elevator.  I pressed the button again and again, but the elevator just kept going down.\n\nI didn't like this one bit.  I was scared.  I was scared of the elevator, and I was scared of the hospital.  I was scared of everything.  I didn't know what to do.  I just stood there, holding the button down.\n\nThe elevator stopped suddenly.  The doors opened, and I stepped out.  I looked around.  I was in a parking garage.  It was"

I sat up in my bed, my heart pounding in my chest, my eyes scanning the dark room for any sign of the mysterious speaker.

Do you know him?\u201d she asked me, her voice dripping with desperation.\n\nI shook my head.  \u201cNo, I don't know who you're talking about.\u201d I could feel her eyes on me, so I sat up straighter, my back against the headboard of my bed.\n\nShe stepped forward, her bare feet padding softly on the floor.  \u201cThat's okay, I've been looking everywhere for him.

The room was cold, and my feet crunched on the gravel of the driveway as I walked to the window.\n\nThe girl followed me, and we watched as the moon moved across the sky, casting its silvery glow over everything.  \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, and I nodded, feeling a sense of calm wash over me.\n\nWe stood there in silence, watching the moon move, and I felt a strange connection to her, like we were old friends.  She smiled and started to walk away, and I felt a pang of loneliness as she disappeared into the darkness.\n\nI got back into bed and lay back down, feeling the cool night air on my skin.  The darkness was a comfort, a place where I could escape the troubles of the world.  But tonight, I knew I couldn't stay here.  I knew I had to go out into the night, to help the girl.\n\nI threw off my covers and got out of bed again, my feet crunching on the gravel.  I walked out into the night, feeling the cool air on my skin as I followed the girl.\n\nShe walked fast, her feet pounding on the gravel as she hurried through the night.  I followed her, my heart pounding in my chest, my eyes scanning the darkness for any sign of danger.\n\nShe stopped at the edge of the woods, her head turning towards me.  \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and I nodded, feeling a sense of relief.\n\n\u201cI'll help you,\u201d I said, and she smiled, her eyes shining with tears.\n\n\u201cYou're kind,\u201d she said, and I nodded, feeling a sense of pride.\n\nWe walked into the woods, the darkness swallowing us whole.  I couldn't see anything, and I was afraid.  I was scared of what was lurking in the woods, waiting to pounce on us.\n\nThe girl didn't seem to mind.

He was a tall man, his hair dark and messy, his eyes gleaming with excitement.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d the girl said, running towards him and flinging herself into his arms.\n\nThe man was hugging her tightly, his eyes gleaming with joy.  \u201cI knew you'd be here,\u201d he whispered, and I felt a pang of loneliness as they hugged.\n\nI felt like a stranger, a person who had been invited into their home, but didn't belong.

I felt like a stranger, a person who had been invited into their home, but didn't belong.\n\nThe girl looked at me, her eyes gleaming with tears.  \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and I nodded, feeling a sense of relief.\n\nI turned around and started to walk away, feeling a sense of peace wash over me.  I was alone, but I was happy.  I had helped the girl, and she was happy now.\n\nAs I walked away, I heard the girl's voice behind me.  \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and I"

        "pred_story": "The old woman gazed up at the clouds, a mixture of tears and wonder streaming from her eyes. She could see the outlines of magnificent creatures now, beasts of fire and smoke that were a stark contrast to the village she had once called home. The wind howled as flames began to fall from the heavens and the old woman lifted her head in a quiet scream as the first of the inferno flames rained hell upon the village of Ashwood.\n\nThe villagers scurried to flee, not a moment too soon as a massive dragon burst forth from the clouds, its fiery breath engulfing the town. Ashwood was to be a sacrifice to appease the gods, to make up for the wrongs they had committed. The villagers had never lived beyond the bounds of what was natural and it had gone unnoticed but not unaddressed. The dragons and the heavens were a harsh and unforgiving place and they had been wronged.\n\nAs the flames continued to fall from the sky the old woman watched in rapt attention as a large group of villagers fled into the woods to the east. She gazed at them with a mixture of anger and sadness as she thought of the lives she had seen the group take in the past. Their leader was a cruel man, a true villain in the eyes of many.\n\n\"May they burn in the fire of their own making,\" she muttered to herself as the village of Ashwood burned to ashes. The flames continued to fall from the heavens, a storm of fire that seemed to have no end. The old woman's eyes never left the burning village, a steady stream of tears flowing down her face as she watched her home go up in flames. She had lived there her entire life, she had seen her parents born and die there.\n\nThe villagers ran through the trees, desperate to escape the falling flames. The old woman watched them from the edge of the forest, her eyes burning with a fierce fire as she thought of the man who had led them. She had been a spy for the villagers, a spy in the eyes of the man who had led them.\n\nAs they fled she made her way deeper into the forest, making her way back to the secret location of the group. They had hidden there for the past few days, trying to stay out of the way of the fire and the flames.\n\nShe came upon the group, the leader standing in front of them as they watched the flames fall from the sky. \"The village is gone,\" she said, her voice carrying across the clearing as the flames raged on. \"Ashwood is no more.\"\n\nThe group gasped at her words, their eyes wide with fear and shock. The leader looked at them, his face twisted in anger and hatred. \"What about our supplies?\" one of the villagers asked, their voice trembling with fear. The old woman was taken aback by the question, she had not thought of their supplies. She had been too busy watching the flames fall from the heavens.\n\nThe group seemed to be waiting for an answer, and she knew that she had to give one. \"We have enough supplies for a few more days,\" she said, her voice steady as she looked at the leader of the group. She could see the anger and hatred in his eyes, she could see the cruel and wicked nature of the man who had led them.\n\n\"We will need to move soon,\" one of the villagers said, their voice filled with fear as they looked at the leader. \"The flames will not last forever and we must be gone before they do.\" The leader nodded in agreement, his eyes never leaving the flames as they fell from the heavens.\n\n\"I will scout ahead,\" the old woman said, her voice steady and firm. \"Find a new place for us to live, a place where we will not be bothered by the heavens.\" The group nodded in agreement, their eyes filled with a mix of fear and hope as they watched her disappear into the forest. The flames continued to fall from the heavens, a storm of fire that seemed to have no end.\n\n\"May we not be bothered by the heavens again,\" the group said, their voices filled with hope and fear as they watched the flames fall from the heavens.\n\nThe old woman disappeared into the trees, making her way through the forest as she searched for a new place for the group to live. She knew that the flames would not last forever and she had to find a new place for them before they did. She also knew that the group had to be careful, they had to be quiet and stealthy as they made their way through the forest.\n\nShe moved through the trees, her eyes scanning the landscape as she looked for a new place for the group to live. She had lived in the forest for many years, she knew it like the back of her hand. She had lived in the village of Ashwood for even longer, she had known every inch of it. She had seen every inch of it go up in flames.\n\nShe had been a spy for the villagers, a spy in the eyes of the man who had led them. She had seen the cruel and wicked nature of the man, she had seen the way he treated the villagers. He was a true villain, a man who had no respect for the natural world.\n\nThe group had been a part of the village, they had been a part of the community. They had been a part of the natural world, a part of the balance that had been thrown off by the man who had led them.\n\nThe old woman moved through the forest, her eyes scanning the landscape as she looked for a new place for the group to live. She knew that the flames would not last forever, she knew that the group had to be gone before they did. She also knew that the group had to be careful, they had to be quiet and stealthy as they made their way through the forest.\n\nAs she moved through the trees she came upon a clearing, a place where a small stream ran through. She looked at the clearing, her eyes scanning the landscape as she looked for any signs of danger. She saw nothing, no signs of danger. She knew that this was the place, she knew that this was where the group could live.\n\nShe moved through the clearing, her eyes scanning the landscape as she looked for any signs of danger. She saw none, no signs of danger. She knew that this was the place, she knew that this was where the group could live.\n\nShe made her way back to the group, her eyes scanning the landscape as she looked for any signs of danger. She saw none, no signs of danger. She knew that this was the place, she knew that this was where the group could live.\n\nAs she approached the group she could see the leader standing in front of them, his eyes scanning the landscape as he looked for any signs of danger. He looked at her as she approached, his eyes narrowing as he looked at her. \"We have found a new place to live,\" she said, her voice steady and firm.\n\nThe leader nodded in agreement, his eyes never leaving her face. \"I will lead the group,\" he said, his voice steady and firm. \"We will make our way through the forest, we will make our way to the new place.\" The old woman nodded in agreement, her eyes never leaving his face. \"I will scout ahead,\" she said, her"

I'll tell you the name of the truck as soon as I remember, and we can go there next weekend.\" I typed out, trying not to focus on the clock as the seconds ticked by, waiting for her response.\n\nThere was no response, which was to be expected. She had no phone. She never would.\n\nI watched as she typed away at her computer, her fingers moving across the keys with a speed that was almost inhuman. She was such a perfectionist. Every single thing about her life was perfectly timed, perfectly planned. I found myself getting caught up in the vortex of her organized world, wanting to be a part of it. But at the same time, I was scared of losing myself in it, of becoming as boring as she was.\n\nI sighed and turned off my computer. It was late, and I should go to bed.

        "pred_story": "It was my birthday. It wasn't a special one for me. I was turning thirty-two and I would be moving to another state for work in a week. I didn't really have any friends to celebrate with. My parents were busy and I hadn't really talked to any of my friends from high school or college. I was a bit of a loner.\n\nI took a day off to go shopping for some clothes. I was going to be living in the city and I wanted to look decent. The woman at the register raised an eyebrow at the total cost.\n\n\"You must be rich,\" she said.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said with a laugh, \"I'll have to mortgage my house just to afford this stuff.\"\n\nI walked out of the mall and started my car to go home. As I was driving, I noticed a figure standing on the side of the road. It was a man with sharp fangs and pointed ears. It was a vampire. I wasn't scared. I just knew this kind of thing was going on in the world. I had seen movies like this and I was a little disappointed that this was the reality of it.\n\n\"Hey, you,\" the man said to me. \"Are you a vampire?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"I'm a human. I'm not going to bite you, so just relax.\"\n\n\"I'm not a vampire,\" the man said, \"I'm a vampire slayer. I have to destroy all the vampires in this city before the end of the week.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to hurt you,\" I said, \"So don't worry about it.\"\n\n\"I don't know if you're going to help me,\" the man said, \"But I'm going to take a chance on you. Will you help me destroy the other vampires in the city?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said. \"I don't know how I would do that.\"\n\n\"I've been doing this for centuries,\" the man said. \"I have all the information I need. I just need someone with a little bit of courage.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to help you,\" I said. \"I'm just going to go home and watch some movies.\"\n\nThe vampire's face fell.\n\n\"I'll be there in the morning,\" he said. \"We'll start at your house.\"\n\nI went home and went to bed. The next morning, the vampire showed up at my door with two other vampires. The other vampires were female. They looked like models. I was a little intimidated.\n\n\"Thank you for coming,\" I said.\n\n\"Thank you for helping us,\" one of the vampires said.\n\nThe vampire slayer started talking and told us all about vampires. They lived forever. They drank blood to live. They were immortal. They had supernatural powers. They could only be destroyed by a stake through the heart. They hated garlic. They loved blood.\n\nI wasn't sure if I believed all of this. But the vampire slayer seemed to know a lot about the supernatural.\n\n\"Are we going to be doing this for the rest of the week?\" I asked.\n\n\"We'll be doing it for the rest of the month,\" the vampire slayer said. \"We'll have to destroy all of the vampires in the city before we can move on to the next city.\"\n\nThis was sounding like a bad movie. But I was already invested in the story. I wanted to know how it ended.\n\n\"We have to start at your house,\" the vampire slayer said.\n\nI started to freak out. I was in my house and there was a group of vampires and a vampire slayer. I was going to be the first stop on their tour of the city.\n\n\"It's okay,\" one of the vampires said. \"We won't bite unless you want us to.\"\n\n\"What do you want from me?\" I asked.\n\n\"I don't want anything from you,\" the vampire said, \"But I'm going to have to take a little bit of your blood.\"\n\nI looked at the vampire slayer. The vampire slayer was giving me a nod.\n\n\"Thank you,\" the vampire said.\n\nThe vampire took my wrist and started to suck my blood. I was in pain but I was also in love. I was loving the way the vampire was sucking my blood. I was loving the way the vampire was sucking my blood.\n\nI was looking into the vampire's eyes. The vampire was looking back at me. I was in pain but I was also in love. I was loving the way the vampire was sucking my blood. I was loving the way the vampire was sucking my blood.\n\nThe vampire finished drinking my blood. I was a little weak but I was still standing. I looked at the vampire slayer.\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said.\n\n\"Anytime,\" the vampire slayer said.\n\nI turned around and walked to my living room. I sat on my couch and watched TV. I had forgotten about the vampire slayer and the other vampires. I was too busy watching my favorite TV show. It was a long time before I heard anything else. I heard a knock at the door.\n\n\"I'll get it,\" I said to no one in particular.\n\nI walked to the door and opened it. It was the vampire slayer.\n\n\"Are you ready to go to the next place?\" the vampire slayer asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\nThe vampire slayer handed me a stake. I was a little disappointed. I had expected a weapon like a sword. But I wasn't going to say anything. I was going to make the most of this.\n\n\"Let's go,\" the vampire slayer said.\n\nWe went to the next place. I was getting a little tired. I was getting a little bored. I was looking forward to the end of the week. I was looking forward to moving to another state.\n\nWe went to the next place and I was given a stake. I killed the vampire and we moved on to the next place. We killed a few more vampires and then we moved on to the next place.\n\nI was getting a little bored. I was starting to think about how long this was going to last.\n\n\"Do we have to do this for the rest of the month?\" I asked the vampire slayer.\n\n\"Yes,\" the vampire slayer said. \"We have to destroy all of the vampires in the city before we can move on to the next city.\"\n\nI sighed and we continued to destroy the vampires. It was a lot of work. But I was determined to see this through.\n\nI was getting a little bored. I was starting to think about how long this was going to last. I was looking forward to moving to another state.\n\nThe end of the week finally came. We were back at the vampire slayer's house. We were all sitting around a table. The vampire slayer was giving us a speech.\n\n\"Thank you all for your help,\" the vampire slayer said.\n\n\"We couldn't have done it without your help,\" one of the vampires said.\n\nThe vampire slayer nodded. He looked around the room.\n\n\"I'm glad we were able to do this,\" the vampire slayer said. \"I've been doing this for centuries. It's a heavy burden to carry. I'm glad we were able to do this together.\"\n\nI looked at the vampire slayer. He was an old man. He was a lot older than I was. I was looking forward to moving to"

But now, someone was knocking on the clock tower's entrance.\n\nI walked through the door. The old mechanisms still worked.

I tried to look at the clock's face, but it was dark. I couldn't see anything.\n\nBut I could feel it. The clock was trying to tell me something.\n\nI sat down next to the clock. I tried to feel its mechanism. It was warm. It was like it was alive.\n\nI felt a presence behind me. I turned around, and I saw a woman standing there. She was old, but she was also beautiful. She was dressed in the style of a Victorian era lady.\n\n\"Hello,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"Hello.\"\n\nI felt a sense of wonder. Who was this woman? And how was she standing here?\n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked.\n\n\"I am the clock,\" she said. \"I have been waiting for you.\"\n\n\"Waiting for me?\" I repeated. \"Why?\"\n\n\"I have been waiting for you to unlock my secret,\" she said.\n\n\"Unlock your secret?\" I repeated.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"I have a secret. A secret that I have been waiting for you to uncover. And now, you have come.\"\n\nI felt a sense of wonder. What could the clock be talking about? And what did it have to do with me?\n\n\"I don't understand,\" I said.\n\n\"I know,\" she said. \"But don't worry. I will tell you everything. And when I am done, you will understand everything.\"\n\nI felt a sense of wonder. What was the clock going to tell me? And what was I going to learn? I sat there, listening to her, trying to understand what she was saying.\n\nBut the clock wasn't saying anything. It was just standing there, looking at me. I couldn't tell if it was happy or sad. But I knew that it was waiting for me.\n\nAnd now, I was waiting for it.\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" I asked.\n\n\"There is something I want you to do,\" she said. \"Something that you need to do. And if you do it, I will give you the secret that I have been waiting for you to unlock.\"\n\nI felt a sense of wonder. What was the clock talking about? And what was it asking me to do?\n\n\"I don't understand,\" I said.\n\n\"Please,\" she said. \"Just do it. And I will tell you everything.\"\n\nI sat there, thinking about what the clock was asking me to do. But I couldn't understand it. I couldn't see what I needed to do. I couldn't see what it wanted me to do.\n\nAnd so, I just sat there. I sat there, trying to figure out what the clock was asking me to do.\n\nBut I knew that I had to do it. I knew that I had to unlock its secret. And when I did, I knew that I would understand everything.\n\nAnd so, I waited. I waited, trying to understand what the clock was asking me to do.\n\nBut the clock wasn't saying anything. It was just standing there, looking at me. I couldn't tell if it was happy or sad. But I knew that it was waiting for me.\n\nAnd now, I was waiting for it.\n\nI have written this in the style of 2/3 of the comments to the original prompt. I am writing this in the style of some of the responses to the writing prompt. \n\nI'm sorry for any misunderstanding. I am trying to follow the prompt.

        "pred_story": "    \"Summon the miner,\" I said, waving at the tall, black-robed figure of a wizard who sat at the front of the grand throne room.  He reached out with his long, spindly fingers and snapped his fingers.  From the doorway of the throne room, a tall, muscular man with a rough beard and a rugged outfit made of leather stepped forward.  He carried a large, wooden pickaxe.  \"Miner,\" he said, \"this the lord of this kingdom.\"\n\n    \"What you want?\" he asked.\n\n    \"I want you to go out there and defeat the dark lord,\" I said, waving vaguely in the direction of the dark lord's castle which was on the other side of the forest.  \"Just punch him.\"\n\n    \"Punch him?\" the miner asked, looking at the wizard in confusion.  \"But he's the lord of all the dark lords.  What if he doesn't want to be punched?\"\n\n    \"He does now,\" the wizard said, waving his fingers again.  The miner suddenly let out a loud whoop and charged out of the room.  \"I'm the hero of the world!\" he shouted, rushing out into the castle.\n\n    A few minutes later the miner came back.  He was covered in blood and sweat and he was holding the dark lord's head in one hand.  \"I did it!\" he shouted, triumphantly holding up the head.\n\n    \"Well done, miner,\" I said, clapping him on the back.  \"You saved the kingdom.\"\n\n    The miner grinned.  \"I'm going to be a hero,\" he said.\n\n    But the kingdom wasn't finished yet.  We needed to get the princess out of the castle.  I went back into the castle, following the miner who had been back to the throne room by now.  I waved at the wizard who was busy practicing his spells.  \"Do you think you can get her out?\" I asked.\n\n    \"Well, let me try,\" he said, waving his fingers again.  The princess of the kingdom stepped forward, and the wizard waved his fingers again.  She suddenly let out a loud whoop and started dancing.  The wizard was laughing.\n\n    \"You're not making her dance,\" I said, staring at him in confusion.\n\n    \"Sorry,\" the wizard said.  \"I'm not really sure how to summon people.  I was trying to summon you, but I think I just ended up summoning some random woman.\"\n\n    \"So you want me to summon the princess instead?\" I asked.\n\n    \"How would you do that?\" he asked.\n\n    \"I don't know,\" I said.  \"Just think of something.\"\n\n    The wizard thought for a few minutes before he shook his head.  \"I have no idea how to do it,\" he said.\n\n    I sighed.  \"Fine.  Maybe we can just send the miner again.\"\n\n    \"But won't he just punch her again?\" the wizard asked.\n\n    \"Well, at least it'll be a more direct approach,\" I said.  \"And if he ends up killing her, we can just blame it on her own stupidity for walking into the dark lord's castle in the first place.\"\n\n    The wizard looked at me like I was crazy.  \"So we're just going to sacrifice the princess for a slightly less terrible death?\"\n\n    \"Yeah,\" I said.  \"That sounds about right.\"\n\n    The wizard just shook his head.  \"I'm not going to summon anyone else,\" he said.  \"I'm just going to go back to my room and practice my spells.\"\n\n    \"Suit yourself,\" I said, shrugging my shoulders.\n\n    The wizard walked out of the room, leaving me to think about our options.  It seemed like the only way to get the princess out of the castle was to send the miner again, but that would probably just end in disaster.\n\n    I sat in the throne room for a few minutes, trying to think about what we could do.  I had just about given up hope when the door burst open and the dark lord himself strode into the room.  \"I've come to surrender,\" he said.\n\n    \"Well, I guess this is a little earlier than I expected,\" I said.  \"I didn't expect him to surrender this quickly.\"\n\n    \"I thought it was a good idea,\" the dark lord said.  \"I'll just give up all my magic and live in a small cottage somewhere.  It's really not that hard.\"\n\n    \"I'm sure it's not,\" I said.  \"But unfortunately, we can't let you do that.\"\n\n    \"Why not?\" he asked, raising his eyebrows.\n\n    \"You see, when we beat you, we gain all your magic,\" I said.  \"So you're not really going to be able to get away from us that easily.\"\n\n    The dark lord scowled.  \"Fine,\" he said.  \"I'll just have to kill myself then.\"\n\n    \"That's not going to help you either,\" I said.  \"The wizard can just bring you back to life with his magic.\"\n\n    \"So what do you want me to do?\" he asked.\n\n    I shrugged.  \"I'm not really sure yet.  But I'm sure something will come up.\"\n\n    The dark lord sighed.  \"I guess I'll just have to wait and see what you want me to do.\"\n\n    \"Sounds good to me,\" I said, smiling.  \"Maybe you can just help me send the miner out there again to get the princess.\"\n\n    \"Fine,\" the dark lord said, rolling his eyes.  \"I'll help you send the miner out there.  But don't expect me to be very helpful.  I'm not really into this whole hero thing.\"\n\n    I nodded.  \"I understand,\" I said.  \"But if you're willing to help us, I'll make sure to reward you with a good spot in the kingdom.  You'll be treated like a king or something.\"\n\n    The dark lord raised an eyebrow.  \"A king?\" he asked.  \"You're really going to give me a title as a reward?\"\n\n    \"Yeah,\" I said.  \"Why not?  You're the most powerful person in the kingdom right now.\"\n\n    The dark lord shrugged.  \"I guess it's not a bad idea,\" he said.  \"But I'm not really sure if I want to be a king.  I've always been more of a dark lord type of guy.\"\n\n    \"Well, I'm sure you'll figure it out,\" I said.  \"But for now, let's just focus on getting the princess out of the castle.\"\n\n    \"Fine,\" the dark lord said.  \"Let's just get her out of the castle and then you can worry about what to do with me.\"\n\n    I nodded.  \"Sounds good to me,\" I said.  \"Let's go get her.\"\n\n    \"Wait,\" the dark lord said, holding up a hand.  \"Can I at least get a minute before we go?\"\n\n    \"Yeah, sure,\" I said.  \"What do you need a minute"

        "pred_story": "I was always good at sneaking. Always a good runner. Always a good shot. But my greatest talent? I could move any object. 1 inch. Left. \n\nThe first time I did it was when I was 6. I wanted to sit next to my best friend at lunch, but she was sitting with some other kids. I couldn't just go sit down next to her, I had to get her to want to sit with me. I moved the chair she was sitting on. 1 inch. Left. And then I sat down next to her, smiling like it was the most natural thing in the world. She was confused, but she liked me so she smiled too, and I felt happy. \n\nI did it again with my boyfriend. He was too proud to ask me out, so I moved his gym bag. 1 inch. Left. It blocked his way out of the locker room. He was stuck, and I was able to talk to him for a little longer. He asked me out. \n\nIt was all innocent until I got to high school. I had always been friends with the popular kids. They had always been mean to me, but I had never retaliated. That changed when they ruined my sister's birthday. They had planned a party without inviting her, and she had found out when she got home and saw the decorated room. I moved the party decorations. 1 inch. Left. But I didn't stop at that. I moved the TV in the room. 1 inch. Left. And then I moved the couch. 1 inch. Left. \n\nI knew it would look like an accident. I knew the police would just think it was a bad coincidence. But they didn't know me. They didn't know how good I was at this game. \n\nThat's why it came as such a surprise to the entire school when the new cheerleading squad performed their routine on the top of the bleachers. 1 inch. Left. A tiny fall, but enough to injure several people, including the principal and the head cheerleader. \n\nIt wasn't until the summer after that the FBI got involved. They had been watching me for a while, and they were impressed. They wanted to meet with me. I went to the restaurant and they asked me to sit down, to order something to eat. They wanted to know more about my power. \n\nIt's not a power, I told them. It's a talent. \n\nI can do more than just move things. I can be precise. I can be precise with a weapon. I can be precise with a target. The FBI was impressed. \n\nThey asked me to work for them, to use my talents for good. I said no. I don't want to work for the government. I don't want to work for anyone. \n\nThe FBI offered me a large sum of money, but I told them no again. I told them I didn't want it. \n\nAnd then I moved them. 1 inch. Left. \n\nNow, you're wondering why I'm telling you all of this. Well, I'm glad you're interested. \n\nIt's because I'm not just a person with a power, I'm a person with a mission. I'm a person with a goal. \n\nAnd I'm going to achieve it, no matter what it takes. I'm going to move that 1 inch. And I'm going to keep moving it until I reach my destination."

        "pred_story": "After a quick dinner and showers, the two men set off on their adventure. I had a map of the cave system and some basic information about it. A guy on Reddit had gone in and taken some photos. From what I can remember, the cave was pretty large with some great formations and maybe a few bats. \n\nWe made it to the cave entrance and the driver grabbed the cement mixer. \"You wanna go in there, you're gonna help me mix the cement!\" he says, pulling up the ladder to the cement mixer. He climbs up the ladder and pulls out a big bag of cement. \"Let me show you how this thing works!\"\n\nAfter a few minutes of him telling me how to mix the cement, he finally starts mixing it himself. I try to ask him some questions about the cave system, but he's too busy telling me about the cement mixer. Eventually, he gets tired and says, \"Alright! Now we have a lot of cement. Let's go build a house!\"\n\nI am perplexed. \"You're going to build a house in the cave? What about the creepy cave paintings and symbols?\" I say, looking at him.\n\nHe looks at me and shrugs. \"Don't know what you're talking about. I just want to get to the top of this place and see what I can find.\"\n\nI sigh and say, \"Fine. We'll go in together. But if you find anything and don't tell me, I'm going to kill you.\"\n\nHe chuckles and says, \"Don't kill me! I want to get married to you!\"\n\nI look at him and say, \"Don't talk like that. We're not going to get married. Just, you know, don't betray me or anything.\"\n\nHe nods and says, \"Alright! We'll just be cave explorers together!\"\n\nI roll my eyes and we proceed into the cave. The entrance was a lot bigger than I expected and I am relieved that we didn't have to use the cement mixer to make it bigger. \n\nWe start to walk through the cave, and I start to get worried. The driver has taken the lead and is walking up ahead of me. He's not really paying attention to me or to the cave. He's just walking and looking around. The cave is pretty dark, but I can see the glow of his flashlight a few feet in front of me. \n\nI start to look around me and see some of the cave paintings. They are pretty creepy, but I am trying to focus on the formations. We are walking through a pretty large cavern now, and I am starting to see some pretty cool formations. I see some stalactites and stalagmites, but they aren't really my thing. I'm more interested in the bats and the way the light reflects off the water in the cave. \n\nI try to call out to the driver, but he's not responding. I try to get closer to him, but he's too far away for me to see him clearly. I start to feel a little worried now, so I go to my backpack and grab the flashlight that my mom gave me before we left. \n\nI turn it on and shine it towards the driver. He's not really paying attention to me, but he's not paying attention to the cave either. He's just walking and looking around. I try to follow him with the flashlight, but he's moving pretty quickly. I start to feel really worried now, so I start to run towards him.\n\nAs I get closer, I see him looking up at a wall in the cave. I shine the flashlight on it and see a really creepy cave painting. It's some kind of creature with its arms and legs in the wrong places. I start to feel really scared now, so I try to turn around and go back to the entrance.\n\nBut my feet feel like they are stuck in the mud. I try to move my feet, but they aren't moving. I try to move my body, but my body is stuck. I'm stuck in the mud, and I'm scared. I'm not scared of the creature, I'm scared of the driver. He's not responding to my calls, and he's not trying to help me. I'm stuck in the mud, and he's not trying to get me out of it. \n\nI'm stuck in the mud, and I'm alone in the cave. I'm alone in the cave, and I'm going to die. I'm going to die in the cave, and I'm going to be eaten by the creature. I'm going to be eaten by the creature, and I'm going to be buried in the cave. \n\nI'm going to be buried in the cave, and I'm never going to be found. I'm never going to be found, and my mom is never going to know what happened to me. My mom is never going to know what happened to me, and she's going to be in pain.

        "pred_story": "I couldn't believe how easy it was. I was sitting on the couch, rummaging through my laundry basket for the missing sock when I stumbled upon the email. I had been meaning to check it out for weeks but I just hadn't gotten around to it. \n\n'Sorry to bother you, I'm calling on behalf of the Pandimensional Lost and Found. We have been trying to reach you. We are looking for someone to work as an agent and we think you'd be perfect. I know that the job posting on the internet is a joke, but I assure you, this is for real. Would you be interested in coming in for an interview?'\n\nI don't think I ever told you that I had lost my favorite sock. I know, I know, it's not the end of the world, but that sock was special. It was a bright blue sock that was a gift from my sister when I was in high school. I had lost it during a family vacation and I have been searching for it since then. I was starting to think it was lost forever, but after all these years I was starting to believe that maybe it was out there somewhere waiting for me. \n\nI was shocked when I received the call. I couldn't believe it when I found out that it was for real. I went in for the interview and I could tell that they were being serious. The pay was amazing and I was a little skeptical, but I figured what the hell? I had nothing to lose. \n\nI started working for the Pandimensional Lost and Found about a month ago and I have to say, it's been amazing. I have been able to find so many lost things, and I mean, we're talking about anything. The first thing that I found was my favorite childhood blanket. I had been missing it for like 20 years and it turned out it was in my sister's attic. I found a set of keys in the sewer that belonged to a house that I had lived in my whole childhood. I even found an old phone that was still working, no matter how many times I called it, I could never get a connection. But the craziest thing I ever found was a lost hat that belonged to a guy who I went to school with. I found it in the same spot that I had lost it, a park bench in the school courtyard. I was the only one left at the school that day and the principal had told us to stay in our classrooms, but I had decided to go out and see what was going on. I was sitting on the bench and I had fallen asleep, and somehow my hat had slipped off and fallen into the bushes. I had been searching for it for years, but I never knew where it was. \n\nBut the craziest thing I ever found was a lost sock. It was the exact same type of sock that I had been searching for and I was ecstatic. I turned the sock over and over in my hands, making sure it wasn't a fake. I knew it was the real deal, and I knew that I had to have it. I was walking down the street when I got the call. I looked at the phone and saw the number of the Pandimensional Lost and Found. I was a little skeptical, but I decided to answer it. \n\n'Hello?'\n\n'Hello, is this the guy that works for the Pandimensional Lost and Found?'\n\n'Yes, how can I help you?'\n\n'I am the supervisor and I am calling to inform you that you have found the last item on your to-do list. You have found all of the lost items that were left for you to find. I am glad that you were able to complete the job and I am looking forward to you being able to return your favorite sock to its rightful owner.'\n\n'Wait, what? My favorite sock?'\n\n'Yes, the blue sock that you have been searching for for years. We have found it and we are ready for you to return it to its rightful owner.'\n\nI was ecstatic. I had been searching for my sock for years and I finally found it. I thanked the supervisor and hung up the phone. I knew that I had to go to the office as soon as possible. I was going to call my sister and tell her that I found the sock and that I was going to return it to the rightful owner. \n\nI went to the office and saw the sock hanging on a wall. I grabbed it and started to walk towards the door when I saw the supervisor standing in front of me. \n\n'Where are you going?'\n\n'To find the rightful owner of the sock.'\n\n'No, you can't do that. The sock belongs to a man that is in a different dimension. It's not just any dimension, it's a dimension that is filled with monsters. The man that owns the sock is a man that has lost the sock for 20 years and he is going crazy because of it. He will not be able to survive in this dimension and I am here to tell you that you are going to have to leave him there.'\n\nI was shocked. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I had never heard of a dimension that was filled with monsters before. I had never heard of a man that had lost a sock for 20 years before. I had no idea what to do. I looked at the supervisor and asked him if he could help me.\n\n'Yes, I can help you. I can tell you how to survive in the dimension and how to return the sock to its rightful owner.'\n\nI was amazed. I had never thought about being a spy before, but I knew that I could do it. I asked the supervisor if he could give me a map and a compass, and he did. He gave me a map that showed me where the dimension was, and he gave me a compass that I could use to find my way around the dimension. I thanked him and I left.\n\nI had never been so scared in my life. I had no idea what I was getting myself into, but I knew that I had to try. I had to find the sock and return it to its rightful owner. I started my journey by reading the map and using the compass. I had no idea what I was looking at, but I knew that it was the best way to survive in the dimension. I packed a bag with snacks and water, and I set off on my journey.\n\nThe first thing that I noticed was how hot it was. It was like walking through a furnace, and I was sweating buckets. I looked down and saw that my shoes were melting. I was scared, I didn't know what to do. I was walking down a path when I saw a man walking towards me. He was huge and hairy, and he was carrying a club. I was scared, I knew that I was in trouble. I tried to run, but my feet felt like they were stuck to the ground. I tried to shout, but my voice was frozen in my throat. I was paralyzed with fear.\n\nThe man stopped in front of me and looked at me with his eyes. He was huge and ugly, and he was staring at me like I was a snack. I was frozen in fear, I couldn't move or speak. I was just a statue, staring at the monster in front of me. \n\nI"

        "pred_story": "When I first woke up I was unsure of where I was and how I got there. I did not remember much at all, though I remembered my name was Alan. After some time I realized that I was in a hospital. They did not know who I was, as my wallet was empty and my phone was not on me. I spent the next few days in the hospital, trying to remember what happened. When no memories came, the hospital let me stay there. I had my name put on a piece of paper, and they let me leave with a note with their contact information.\n\nIt was a few weeks before I got the feeling back. It was a strange feeling that I couldn't put my finger on. It felt like a mix of excitement, sadness, and anger. At first, I couldn't remember how it happened or why I had the feeling. It wasn't until later that night, as I was sleeping in a bed I had found, that I realized that I remembered something. I remembered the smell of the air in my house. I remembered the smell of my mother's cooking. I remembered how much I loved playing outside when I was younger. I remembered the smell of my favorite park in the spring. I remembered the smell of the air on a warm summer day. I remembered the smell of the grass as I was laying in it. These were the first memories that I had had since getting my memory taken away.\n\nThe next day, I went to the hospital to tell them that I remembered something. They were unsure of what to say. They were unsure of whether I was remembering a dream, or a memory that I actually had. They let me leave the hospital. That evening, I went to the park that I remembered. The smell of the grass and the smell of the air in the spring were as I remembered them. I was amazed and confused.\n\nThe next day, I went to my old house to see how much I could remember. As I opened the door, I was hit with the smell of the air in my house. I knew it was exactly the smell that I remembered. I walked around the house, and all of my memories came back. I remembered my mother making dinner, I remembered my friends playing with me. I even remembered how my friends and I used to get into mischief. I remembered a tree that was blown over in a storm that had happened when I was younger. I even remembered the smell of my mother's favorite perfume.\n\nThe next day, I went to the library to find out what had happened to me. I spent hours searching for information about people who had lost their memory. When I finally found some information, it said that people who had lost their memory had often found that they would remember things over time. I was excited to hear that. I was finally remembering things. I was finally feeling my life coming back. I was finally feeling happy and sad about things that happened to me.\n\nOver the next few weeks, I spent my days finding the places that I remembered. I spent my days trying to find people that I knew. I went to the park and I went to my old house. I went to places that I remembered my mother taking me to. I was happy to be there, I was sad to be there. I was happy that I was remembering things, I was sad that I was remembering things. I was excited to be moving forward in my life, I was scared of where my life was going.\n\nIt was a few weeks after that when I first felt the feeling. It was a feeling that I had felt before, but I didn't know it at the time. I was standing at the park, looking at a lake in the distance. I saw a family, and I saw the look that their child had on their face. I saw the look that their child had on their face, and I was hit with the feeling. It was a feeling of excitement, sadness, and anger. I was sad that I had not met that family when I was younger. I was excited that I had finally met them. I was angry that I had waited so long to meet them. I was angry that I had to wait so long to feel the feeling.\n\nI spent the rest of that day and the next day in the park, staring at the lake. I spent the rest of that week and the next week staring at the lake. I spent the rest of that month and the next month staring at the lake. I had the feeling every day. I had the feeling every day, but it was different each day. It was a different smell that I remembered each day. It was a different smell that I remembered each day, but it was still a different smell that I remembered each day.\n\nIt was a few months after that when I first had a dream. I was not sure what the dream was about, but it was a dream that I had often. It was a dream of me playing outside. It was a dream of me playing with my friends. It was a dream of me playing with my friends in the park. It was a dream of me playing with my friends in the park, and it was a dream of me playing with my friends in the park. I had the dream often, and it was a dream that I loved. I loved the dream, but I was unsure of what the dream was about.\n\nIt was a few months after that when I first met someone that I had known. It was a woman that I had met when I was younger. I had not seen her in a long time, and it was a feeling that I had not felt in a long time. It was a feeling that I had felt since I was a child. I had felt it since I was a child, but I had not felt it in a long time. I had not felt it in a long time, but I felt it now. I felt it when I was standing in front of her, and I felt it when I was talking to her. I felt it when I was talking to her, and I felt it when I was walking with her. I felt it when I was walking with her, and I felt it when I was sitting with her. I felt it when I was sitting with her, and I felt it when I was looking at her. I felt it when I was looking at her, and I felt it when I was thinking about her.\n\nI spent the rest of the day with her.

        "pred_story": "It was the first day of spring break and I was more than happy to have some time off from school. It would be a week of doing whatever I wanted, without any homework or tests, and I was eager to get started.\n\nThe first thing I did after I got up was to check my phone to see what time my dad would be arriving. He had promised that he would come to pick me up at 9, and I was excited to see him. It had been a while since he had been around, and I was happy to have some quality time with him.\n\nBut when I checked my phone I was greeted with a text message that made my heart sink. It was from my dad, and it was short and sweet. \"Hey kid, I'm sorry I won't be able to make it today. Something unexpected came up and I need to take care of it. I'll make it up to you, though. Don't worry about it.\"\n\nI felt a mix of emotions as I read the text message. I was initially excited to see him, but after reading it I felt a mix of sadness and disappointment. It was hard to hear that he wouldn't be coming today, especially when it was the first day of spring break. It was hard to not think that he was abandoning me, but then again, maybe he was.\n\nI sighed and looked around the room to see what I could do with my time now. I could spend the day sleeping in, or I could do something productive. I was torn between the two options.\n\nBut after some thought, I decided to do something productive. I got dressed and headed to the living room to turn on the TV. I was in the mood for some old TV shows, so I started flipping through the channels. I stopped at a show that I loved, and I was happy to see that they were still showing reruns.\n\nAs I watched the show, I started to feel a bit better. It was old, but it was still something to do, and it was something to take my mind off of my dad not coming. I settled in for the day, determined to have a good day, despite my dad not coming.\n\nBut as I was watching the show, I heard a knock at the door. I thought it was the neighbor coming to borrow something, but as I turned to see who it was, I was surprised to see my dad standing in the doorway. He had a smile on his face, and he looked happy to be there.\n\n\"Hey kid,\" he said, \"I know I said I wouldn't be able to make it today, but I was able to take care of what I needed to do. I'm sorry for the confusion earlier. I'm here now, and I'm here to spend some quality time with you.\"\n\nI smiled back at him, happy to see him. \"It's okay, dad. I know you said you would come, and I was starting to get worried. But now that you're here, I'm glad you're here.\"\n\nHe smiled back at me, and then he walked over to where I was sitting. \"I brought you a little something, too,\" he said, pulling out a small gift box from behind his back. \"I know you don't deserve it, but I want you to have it anyway. It's a little something to show you how much I care.\"\n\nI was touched by the gift. It was something I hadn't seen before, and I didn't know what it was. \"I don't know what it is,\" I said, feeling a bit confused.\n\n\"I know,\" my dad said, \"but that's okay. I want you to open it and see. Maybe it will be something you like.\"\n\nI hesitated for a moment, but then I decided to open it. I lifted the lid, and inside I found a small crystal pendant. It was beautiful, and I loved the way it looked.\n\n\"Wow,\" I said, \"this is beautiful. Thank you, dad. I really appreciate it.\"\n\nHe smiled back at me, happy that I liked it. \"I'm glad you like it,\" he said. \"I was thinking that you could wear it tomorrow, as a special way to celebrate spring break. It would be a good way to mark the beginning of the new season, don't you think?\"\n\nI nodded, feeling happy about the gift. \"Yes, I think so. It would be a good way to do it. Thank you again, dad. I really appreciate it.\"\n\nHe smiled back at me, and then he looked around the room. \"I'm glad I'm here,\" he said. \"I've missed you, and I'm happy to be with you today. We can spend the day together, doing whatever you want. I'm here to take care of you, and to make sure you have a good time.\"\n\nI smiled back at him, feeling happy that he was there. \"I'm happy to have you here, dad. Thank you for coming.\"\n\nHe smiled back at me, and then he sat down next to me. \"I'm glad I could come,\" he said. \"I've missed you, and I'm happy to be with you today. We can spend the day together, doing whatever you want. I'm here to take care of you, and to make sure you have a good time.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling happy about the day ahead. \"I'm looking forward to it,\" I said. \"Thank you again, dad. I really appreciate it.\"\n\nHe smiled back at me, and then he looked around the room again. \"I'm glad I'm here,\" he said. \"I've missed you, and I'm happy to be with you today.

Thank you for coming.\"\n\nHe smiled back at me, and then he stood up. \"Let's go and do something fun,\" he said. \"I was thinking that we could go to the park, and play some games. It would be a good way to spend the day, don't you think?\"\n\nI nodded, feeling happy about the idea. \"Yes, I think so. I would love to go to the park and play some games. Thank you again, dad.\"\n\nHe smiled back at me, and then he walked over to the door. \"Let's go, then,\" he said. \"I'm excited to spend the day with you, and to make some memories that will last a lifetime.\"\n\nI smiled back at him, feeling happy about the day ahead. \"I'm excited too, dad. Thank you again for coming.\"\n\nHe smiled back at me, and then he walked out the door. I followed him, feeling happy about the day ahead. We spent the day playing games, and having fun together. It was a special day, and I would always remember it."

His skin was a porcelain doll complexion, and it seemed almost unreal. There was nothing else about him that suggested immortality. It was as if he was a normal twenty five year old. Not a single hair out of place, not a single wrinkle on his skin.\n\nI stared, completely transfixed. There was no way I could believe this. This man had been alive for almost eighty years.\n\n\"How did you do it?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he replied.\n\n\"What?\" I repeated, as if I was completely unaware.\n\nThe man laughed, and it was the most beautiful laugh I had ever heard. It was deep and rich and full of joy. \"You are a curious one,\" he said.\n\nI nodded, feeling a little embarrassed. \"I've always wondered,\" I said. \"You've been alive for seventy years, and you're still just twenty five. You're...you're perfect. You're one of the most perfect people I've ever met. How did you manage it?\"\n\nThe man chuckled. \"It's not easy,\" he said, \"but it's worth it.\"\n\n\"Do you have a secret?\" I asked. \"Did you have to do something to make yourself immortal?\"\n\nThe man laughed again. \"I wish,\" he said. \"It's a gift. A curse, really. But I'm not complaining.\"\n\n\"Could you...could you teach me?\" I asked. \"I've always wanted to be immortal.\"\n\nThe man shook his head. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"You can't learn it. You have to be born with it.\"\n\nI sighed, feeling a little jealous. I wished I could have the kind of life this man had. \"Is there anything else you can teach me?\" I asked, trying to hide the sadness in my voice.\n\nThe man nodded. \"I can teach you anything,\" he said. \"Do you want to learn music?\"\n\nI nodded. \"I want to learn how to play the piano,\" I said.\n\nThe man smiled. \"I'll teach you,\" he said. \"But first, we have to get you to a piano. I'll drive you home, and then we can meet up again tomorrow.\"\n\nI nodded, and the man drove me home. He didn't take me home, but to a small cottage he had on the outskirts of town. There was a piano in the living room, and the man sat down on the couch beside it. I sat down beside him, and he began to teach me how to play.\n\nIt was the most wonderful thing I had ever felt. The man's fingers were quick and nimble, and he taught me how to play quickly and easily. I felt like I was a natural, and my fingers seemed to move all on their own.\n\nAfter a few hours, the man stopped teaching me, and I was exhausted. I had never felt so tired in my life.\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" he said, \"I'll teach you how to play a more difficult song. For now, let's just practice.\"\n\nI nodded, and the man stood up. \"Come,\" he said, \"let's have some dinner.\"\n\nI followed him into the kitchen, and we ate a meal together. It was the most wonderful meal I had ever eaten. The man's food was delicious, and he was a great cook. I couldn't believe he had been alive for seventy years and was still so young and vibrant.\n\nThe next day, I went back to the man's cottage. He was waiting for me, and he began to teach me how to play a more difficult song. It was even more complicated than the first song, but the man taught me with ease. I was amazed at how quickly I learned.\n\nAfter a few days of practice, the man said that I was ready to play a more complex song. He taught me how to play, and I felt like I was a true artist.\n\nBut even as I was proud of myself, I couldn't help but feel a little jealous of the man's life. He had been alive for seventy years, and he had never aged. He was always twenty five, always young and vibrant. I, on the other hand, would age and die.\n\n\"What's the secret?\" I asked, feeling a little desperate.\n\nThe man smiled. \"There is no secret,\" he said. \"You just have to learn to live with what you have.\"\n\nI sighed, feeling a little frustrated. \"I wish I could have your life,\" I said.\n\nThe man looked at me with his beautiful blue eyes. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"You can't have my life. But you can have a great life of your own.

I looked around, feeling a little lonely. But I wasn't alone for long. The man came back the next day, and he taught me more about music. He taught me how to play a difficult song, and I felt like I was a true artist.\n\nOver the next few weeks, the man taught me more about music. He taught me how to play the piano, the violin, and the guitar.

People were happy, the villagers celebrated. I would often find myself thinking, \"How did we manage to defeat them? It was a miracle and it seems like a miracle!\"\n\nThe villagers in the village I live in are a happy bunch of people. They were all smiling and laughing, but I could feel the weariness from the war. They had worked hard. The village's fields were burned down by the flames of the Demon Lord, and it was hard to harvest food. And the crops were still not back to normal. The village's supplies were dwindling, the villagers had barely enough to live on.\n\nAnd still, the Hero didn't seem to understand the situation. He walked through the village, smiling and laughing, but he didn't seem to notice anything. He didn't see the villagers' weary expressions, he didn't see the lack of food, and the villagers couldn't even afford to eat. He just walked on by. And he seemed to be in a hurry.\n\nThe villagers had barely enough food for a month, and the Hero was already out of the village. He had gone to the Demon Lord's castle, and was gathering supplies. I had asked him why he was doing this, and he told me that he wanted to build a great tower in the village, with a huge gate and a moat. He wanted to live in the castle. I asked him why, and he said it was a great idea, because the villagers needed a place to live. I thought to myself, \"What an absurd idea! The villagers don't need a castle, they need food!\"\n\nI couldn't help but think that the Hero was acting like a child. He had been in the Demon Lord's castle for months, gathering supplies, and now he was building a castle in the village. And he didn't seem to understand that the villagers needed food, not a castle. I couldn't help but think that the Hero was acting like a spoiled child, who didn't know what real life was like.\n\nAnd I had to think that the villagers were tired of the Hero's antics. They were tired of his constant smiling and laughing, and his lack of understanding of the situation. They were tired of his constant talk about building a castle and gathering supplies.

He was going to be a problem for the villagers, and a problem for me. I had thought that I could live in the village and be happy, but now I was starting to feel that I had made a mistake. I had thought that the villagers would be happy to have me around, but now I was starting to feel that they were going to be a problem.\n\nAnd I had to think that the Hero was going to be a problem, because he was going to be a problem for the villagers.

He had gone to the Demon Lord's castle, and was gathering supplies. I had asked him why he was doing this, and he told me that he wanted to build a great tower in the village, with a huge gate and a moat. He wanted to live in the castle. I had asked him why, and he said it"

The main character, a young man with a single eye patch who is called Shiraishi, has been chosen to save the land of Japan. Shiraishi is not a member of a great hero clan but rather a member of a clan of assassins known as the \"Shinobi\". Shiraishi is only one of four men in the clan with the unheard of talent to control the elements.\n\nShiraishi was born into the clan and trained to master his element. Shiraishi, unlike his peers, learned how to master all four elements and learned to use his abilities in combat. One of his peers is called Shira and is also known as the strongest shinobi in the clan. Shira would use his abilities to attack other clans and gain power and allies. Shira would also use his abilities to get the attention of the dark lord, who sought to use Shira's abilities for his own evil plans.\n\nShira was forced to flee the clan after he was caught spying on a rival clan and killing them, and was forced to fight the clan's top assassins. Shira killed three of the assassins and was about to kill the fourth. However, Shira was killed by Shiraishi.\n\nShira's death sparked a chain of events that would lead to a great war in the land of Japan. A great war would break out between the shinobi clans and the dark lord's army. Shiraishi would lead the shinobi clans in battle against the dark lord's army, and would ultimately defeat the dark lord and save the land of Japan.\n\nShiraishi would be hailed as a hero and would be known as the greatest shinobi of all time. However, Shiraishi would not want to be a loner. Shiraishi would want to build a new life for himself and his clan, and would want to live in peace.\n\nHowever, Shiraishi would not know how to speak Japanese. Shiraishi would learn how to speak Japanese by listening to the people around him. Shiraishi would also learn how to read and write Japanese. Shiraishi would become a great leader and would be respected by the people of Japan.\n\nThe people of Japan would learn from Shiraishi's example and would strive to become great leaders and strong warriors. Shiraishi would be remembered as a great hero and would be known as the greatest shinobi of all time.\n\nThe clan of shinobi would thrive under Shiraishi's leadership and would become a great force in the land of Japan. Shiraishi would be a great leader and would be respected by the people of Japan."

I am not even sure if I am a god, I am the universe and the universe is me.\n\nI am not the most evil being in the multiverse, I am more of a force of nature.

She knew she was in the real world and that super heroes were real.\n\nI told her everything, the truth, the lies, the half truths. She was a little scared, but she was also curious. She wanted to know more and more and more. She asked me how I had managed to defeat the humans, but I told her it was not me who had defeated the humans. It was them who had defeated themselves.

        "pred_story": "By 2050 the world was full of people. And I mean that. There was barely any space. It was only when the government came in that the population had a chance to decrease. \n\nThe world wide population was nearly 8 billion before the world wide panic. The people were so unhappy that rioting started. Cars were overturned, buildings were broken into, and people were killed. \n\nThe government finally came in to stop it. But by that time it was too late. The population had already started to decrease.\n\nThe government created the World Wide Population Decrease Program. This program used genetic engineering to take the best traits of a person and create more babies that had the same traits. The program started off with a high birth rate but the population was still decreasing. \n\nSo the government had to take drastic measures. They had to make the world a dangerous place. That way the population would decrease faster. \n\nThe first thing the government did was remove all the safety nets. No railings on the stairs. No seatbelts in cars. No helmets in motorcycles. \n\nAs time went on the government kept making the world more dangerous. It was like a game to them. They would remove all the safety features of a product and see how long it would take for people to die.\n\nBut the government wasn't just stopping at the safety features. They were going further. They were creating new diseases and viruses to kill people. They were creating robots that could kill people. \n\nI was one of the people who suffered in the new world. I was born with a defect. My feet were too small for the world I lived in. It made it hard for me to walk. \n\nI had a hard life as a result. I had to constantly try and find a way to make enough money to buy the things that I needed. I was always on the run. Always trying to escape the dangers of the world. \n\nAs I grew older I found that the only way to survive was to join a gang. They would protect me and help me get the things that I needed. They would take care of me in the world. \n\nI had a good life with my gang. They were like a family to me. We worked together and protected each other. We were a unit. \n\nAs time went on the gang became more violent. They started to attack people and kill them. They would steal their money and their food. They would take whatever they wanted. \n\nI had a hard time with this. I didn't want to be a part of a gang that killed people. I didn't want to be a part of something that was so violent. \n\nSo I left the gang. I was alone in the world again. But I didn't want to be a part of something that hurt people. I wanted to be a part of something that helped people. \n\nI started to work at a charity. They were a group of people who gave food to those in need. They were a group of people who helped those who were struggling. \n\nAs I worked at the charity I found that there were many people who were struggling. There were many people who didn't have enough food. Many people who didn't have enough money. \n\nI found that the government was the reason for all this. They were the ones who had created the World Wide Population Decrease Program. They were the ones who had made the world a dangerous place. \n\nI found that the government was happy with the results of the program. They were happy that the population was decreasing. They were happy that the world was a more violent place. \n\nI found that I was lucky to have survived this long. Many people had died from the lack of safety features. Many people had died from the new diseases and viruses. \n\nI found that the government was the reason for all this. They were the ones who had created the World Wide Population Decrease Program. They were the ones who had made the world a dangerous place.\n\nI found that the government was happy with the results of the program. They were happy that the population was decreasing. They were happy that the world was a more violent place.\n\nSo I decided to speak out. I wanted to tell the people about the World Wide Population Decrease Program. I wanted to tell them about the dangers of the world. I wanted to tell them about the government and how they had created this program.\n\nBut the government didn't want this to happen. They didn't want people to know about the program. They didn't want people to know about the dangers of the world.\n\nSo they tried to stop me. They tried to silence me. They tried to make me stop speaking out.\n\nBut I didn't stop. I kept speaking out. I kept telling people about the program. I kept telling them about the dangers of the world.\n\nAnd in the end I was successful. I had spoken out and told people about the World Wide Population Decrease Program. I had told them about the dangers of the world. I had told them about the government and how they had created this program.\n\nAnd as a result the population of the world began to increase. The government was no longer happy with the results of the program. They were no longer happy that the population was decreasing.\n\nSo they ended the program. They removed the safety features from products. They removed the new diseases and viruses from the world. They made the world a safer place.\n\nAnd as a result the population of the world began to increase. The government was happy with the results. They were happy that the population was increasing. They were happy that the world was a safer place.\n\nI was happy as well. I had helped the world. I had helped to make it a safer place. I had helped to increase the population of the world.\n\nAnd as I looked around I saw people who were happy. I saw people who had enough food. I saw people who had enough money.\n\nI saw people who were thriving in the new world. I saw people who were living in a world that was safe and prosperous.\n\nAnd as I looked at this world I knew that I had done something good. I had helped to make the world a better place. I had helped to make it a safer place. I had helped to increase the population of the world.\n\nAnd as I looked at this world I knew that I would do everything in my power to keep it this way. I would do everything in my power to keep the government from starting the World Wide Population Decrease Program again.\n\nI would do everything in my power to keep the world a safer place. I would do everything in my power to increase the population of the world.\n\nAnd as I looked at this world I knew that I would be happy. I would be happy knowing that I had done something good. I would be happy knowing that I had helped to make the world a better place."

The buildings were a mix of stone and metal, with some signs of glass and steel that looked like they were from a much later time.\n\nAs I walked deeper into the ruins, I began to see strange symbols etched into the walls. They seemed to be a mix of languages, some of which I could recognize. I saw hieroglyphs, cuneiform, and even what looked like English. I began to wonder if this was some kind of message left for us by the ancient ones. But the more I looked, the more I realized that the symbols were more like a code.\n\nI knew that I had to try and decipher the code, but I didn't have the skills. I knew a little bit about cryptography, but nothing that would be able to crack this complex code. I knew that I had to try and find someone who would be able to help me.\n\nI decided to return to the surface to search for someone who could help me.

It looked familiar.\n\nSuddenly, I realized that it was the same symbol that was etched into the wall of the ruins. I realized that it was a logo. A logo of a company that I had heard of just a few years ago.\n\nI realized that I had stumbled upon a secret that was meant to be kept hidden. I realized that there was more to this place than I could ever have imagined. And I was now a part of something much bigger than myself.\n\nI didn't know what the symbol meant, or what the company was planning to do with it. But I knew that I had to find out.\n\nI knew that I had to go back to the ruins, but this time, I was going to be careful. I was going to make sure that I wasn't being watched.

My brother is currently teaching me how to shoot fingerguns.  It's a lot more difficult than I thought it would be.  I've had one or two decent shots in over an hour of practice.  We've had some good times so far this summer, but the experience I'm having now is probably the most surreal.\n\nWe're on the lake dock, both of us are leaning against the railing, and my brother is giving me tips on how to improve my aim.\n\n\"Dude, you need to relax your hand.  You can't be holding the gun too tight.  If you do, you'll just be aiming it with your arm instead of your finger.\"  He says.  \"And your finger needs to be directly in line with your target.  You can't be at an angle or you'll end up shooting the water.\"\n\nI nod and try to relax.  I can feel my heart beating in my chest and it's not doing anything to help my concentration.  I'm not sure how long I'll be able to focus before I feel like I'm going to pass out.\n\nThe water splashes and my brother points at the spot where the fish are jumping.  I focus on the spot and shoot.  My finger goes up and down in a quick motion.  My brother looks at me and nods.\n\n\"Good shot,\" he says.  \"You hit the water a foot away from where the fish were jumping.  That's a lot better than some of my other shots.\"\n\nI nod and we take another shot.  I feel my heart racing as I line up my finger and shoot.  I hear the water splashing around me, and my brother shouts and points at the spot.\n\n\"That's another good shot!\"  He yells.  \"You're doing great!\"\n\nI look out at the water and watch as my brother lines up his next shot.  He is a lot better at this than I am.  He has been doing it for years, and he's had a lot more practice.  I'm not even sure why I'm doing this.\n\nI look at my brother and ask him that.  He looks back at me and grins.\n\n\"I don't know why I even did this.  I'm a terrible shot.  But it's fun doing this with you.\"\n\nI nod and smile back at him.  We're both a lot more relaxed now.  We've had some good times at the lake, but I'm glad we got to do this.  I'm glad I can share something with my brother that he enjoys.  I'll be happy to have done this with him, no matter how terrible I am at it.\n\n\"I'll give you a few tips if you want.\"  My brother offers.  \"First, you need to relax your hand.  Like I said, you can't be holding the gun too tight.  Second, you need to take your time.  Don't rush your shot.  Third, you need to focus on your target.  Don't look anywhere else.  Just look at your target and aim at it.\"\n\nI nod.  My heart has been beating in my chest for a while now, but I'm starting to feel a bit calmer.  I look out at the water and see the fish jumping around.\n\n\"I'll give you another tip,\" my brother says.  \"Don't be afraid to miss.  If you don't shoot at all, you'll never hit anything.\"\n\nI look at my brother and see a big grin on his face.  I nod and smile back at him.\n\n\"Alright,\" he says.  \"Let's go back to shore.  I'm hungry.\"\n\nI nod and turn to go back to shore.  My brother is a lot more excited than I am.  He's been wanting to go back to shore for a while now.  He's hungry and thirsty, and he wants to eat something.\n\nI look at my brother and see that he's getting tired.  He's been shooting fingerguns for a while now, and he needs a break.  I smile at him and nod.\n\n\"Come on,\" I say.  \"Let's go back to shore.\"\n\nMy brother nods and turns to go back to shore.  I follow him and we walk along the dock.  I can feel my heart beating in my chest, but it's not as fast as it was before.  I'm feeling a bit calmer now, but I'm still a bit nervous.\n\nWe reach the shore and walk along the beach.  My brother is tired and hungry, so he takes my lead and walks towards the food stand.  He orders some food and we sit down to eat.\n\nI'm hungry too, so I order some food.  We sit down and eat, and I feel a bit more calm now.  I'm still a bit nervous, but I'm okay.

Despite the pain of death, the man is always reborn, always given a new chance at life, and always able to meet up with his friends in the afterlife who were also born immortal. \n\nEventually the man grows tired of life and dies at the age of 100, a very old age. But before he dies, he writes a letter and leaves it for his future self to find.\n\nThe man is reincarnated and finds his letter. With a tear in his eye, he reads the letter and finds the comfort it brings him. He too leaves a letter for his future self, along with a few notes he'd like his future self to remember when he dies. \n\nYears pass and the man dies again, but the legacy lives on. Each time the man dies, he leaves a letter, and a note or two, for his future self. The man's letters and notes are all passed down through the ages, until they are forgotten. But the legacy lives on in the hearts of those who were born immortal.\n\nEventually the man dies again. When he is reborn, he finds an old, wrinkled woman waiting for him. She introduces herself, and claims to be the creator of the man and all people. She tells the man that she has been waiting for him to come back for thousands of years, and that she has been working on a cure for the disease that causes her children to die. \n\nThe man is overjoyed to hear this, and thanks the woman for all that she has done. He asks her if he can do anything to help her, and the woman tells him that he can take care of her as she ages.\n\nThe man takes care of the woman as she ages, and eventually she dies. When she dies, the man is left alone, and he realises that he will never be able to be with his creator again. He is given a choice to live his life in the afterlife, where he will be with his creator, or return to the earth and live another life."

The population was growing every day, the industry was expanding, and the infrastructure was modernized. There was one problem though.

But for some reason, he was also the one who kept this town from becoming a major town. He was greedy, he wanted to keep the profit for himself and did not want to lose his control. He did not want the colony to be too big or too powerful, and so he kept the population small and controlled.\n\nBut I was determined to break his rule, to make this town a major town, and to make the population grow. I was determined to stop him and to make him step down. But, how?\n\nWell, that was easy. He was an old man, and an old man who had no heirs. So, he had no power in the matter of who would inherit his control over the colony. The only one who could take over after his death would be me.\n\nAnd that was what I did. I told him that I was the one who was meant to take over, who was meant to be the new governor, and that he should step down now. But he would not listen. He thought I was too young, too inexperienced, and that I would not be able to lead the colony to the same heights as he was.\n\nBut I was not going to listen. I was going to do whatever it took to make him step down, and to take over his role. And so, I told him that if he did not step down now, I would have him thrown in prison, and that I would take over his role as the governor.\n\nBut he would not listen, and so I had to take more drastic measures. I sent the police to his house, and they threw him in jail. He was locked up, and I was the new governor.\n\nAnd now, I could start my new role as the governor. I could start making changes, and start making the colony into the major town that I wanted it to be. I was the one who had the power, and I was determined to use that power to make the colony the best it could be. And so, I started making my changes, and started making the colony into the major town that I wanted it to be.\n\nAnd so, the colony was booming. It was growing faster than ever before, and the people were happy. They were happy because they knew that I was working hard to make their town the best it could be. And so, they were happy to work with me, to help me make the colony into the major town that I wanted it to be."

So I'm just going to have to deal with it.\"\n\nMy son nodded, a somber look on his face. \"You've been working on the well for years now, dad. I remember when it started to fill up again after it had been empty for so long. You've been doing it all by yourself.\"\n\nI sighed, a twinge of pain in my shoulder. \"I don't mind that, I was just proud to be able to do something to help the town again.

You're not wrong to want to help, but I think it would be better if you were with your mother for the next few years or so. I don't think I could keep this up for long and I don't want anything to happen to you.\"\n\nMy son nodded again. \"I'll talk to mom about it, dad. But I want to ask one thing. What's your secret?\"\n\nI sighed, a heavy sigh. \"My secret, my son, is nothing more than the fact that I've been doing some... gardening. I've been working with the earth to make sure that the town stays well. It's not anything special, just something that I've done for years now.\"\n\nMy son looked at me skeptically. \"Gardening? Is that all it is? Because I don't understand how you can make a well full of clean, clear water like that. Or how you can make a field of crops grow without water, especially in a year like this. It just isn't possible.\"\n\nI sighed, feeling a twinge of pain in my shoulder. \"I don't know, son. I don't know why you have to make such a big deal about it. I'm just doing something to help the town and now you're making me feel like I'm not.\"\n\nMy son looked at me, his eyes sad. \"Dad, I'm sorry. I just don't understand. If you're not going to tell me, then maybe I should just go talk to mom about it. She might be able to understand something that I don't.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No, son. Don't talk to mom about it yet. Just let it be for now. I don't want to worry her, because I know she'll just want to try to help me out. I'm fine, son. I just need to do some gardening to keep the town going.\"\n\nMy son nodded again. \"I'll leave it be, dad. But I still want to help you. Can I at least help you with your gardening?\"\n\nI sighed, feeling a twinge of pain in my shoulder. \"I don't know, son. I'm not sure if I can explain it to you. But if you want to help, you can come along with me when I go into town to make sure that the well is still filled up. Maybe that way you'll be able to see what I'm doing.\"\n\nMy son nodded, his eyes still sad. \"Okay, dad. I'll come along with you tomorrow. But if you ever change your mind about telling me the truth, I'll be here for you.\"\n\nI smiled, feeling a warmth in my heart. \"Thank you, son. That means a lot to me.\"\n\n---\n\nThe next day, I got up early and set out for town. My son was waiting for me at the door, wearing a suit of clothing that was older than him. \"Where are we going, dad?\" he asked, as I put on my own suit and stepped out of the house.\n\n\"We're going into town, son. We have to make sure that the well is still filled up and that everything is going well. Would you like to come along with me?\"\n\nMy son nodded, his eyes shining. \"Yes, I would love to. I've never been to town on my own before.\"\n\nI smiled. \"Well it's about time you went to town on your own. Maybe I can even teach you some things that you can use when you're older.\"\n\nMy son smiled. \"Thanks, dad.\"\n\nThe town was quiet, with only a few people milling about the streets. The town square was empty, except for one person. My son looked at me in surprise. \"Isn't that mom?\"\n\nI nodded, my eyes turning to the woman standing on the square. \"Yes, she is. I wasn't sure if she would be here today or not, but I guess she decided to come out.\"\n\nMy son looked at me curiously. \"Dad, what are you doing here? Do you have any idea what's going on?\"\n\nI shrugged, feeling a twinge of pain in my shoulder. \"No, son. I don't have any idea. But I think I'll just go talk to your mom about it. Maybe she'll be able to explain what's going on.\"\n\nMy son nodded, his eyes still sad. \"Okay, dad. But maybe you should be careful. I don't know what's going on here.\"\n\nI smiled, feeling a warmth in my heart. \"I'll be careful, son. I'll be careful.\"\n\n---\n\nI walked up to my son's mother, a woman with long brown hair and a kind smile. She was dressed in a suit of clothing that was older than her, and she looked like she had been walking around for a long time.\n\n\"Hello,\" I said, feeling a twinge of pain in my shoulder. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\nShe looked at me, her eyes sad. \"I'm here to take care of your son, dad. I've been keeping an eye on him, but I think it's time that I take him out of the house and get him back to a normal life.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a warmth in my heart. \"Okay, that's fine with me. But can you tell me what's going on here? I didn't know anything was going on.\"\n\nShe looked at me, her eyes sad. \"I know, dad. I didn't want to tell you. But I think it's time that I did. Your son has been trying to figure out what you're doing, but he can't quite understand it. So I think it's time that I tell him the truth.\"\n\nI sighed, feeling a twinge of pain in my shoulder. \"I suppose that's fine, dear. But I'm not sure if I want to tell him the truth. I've been keeping it a secret for so long now.\"\n\nShe nodded, her eyes sad. \"I understand that, dad. But I think it's time that you tell him the truth. He's old enough to understand, and he'll be able to take care of himself when he's older.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a warmth in my heart. \"Okay, dear. I'll tell him the"

I couldn't keep the smile off my face.  I had been playing with this doll since before my mother's death, keeping it close as I followed the herd, driving them through the long, dry plains of the first summer.  \"If we kept him close, he kept the nightmares away.\"\n\nNiko looked up at me, his eyes serious, his expression a little somber, and I felt a pang of regret in my heart.  I had scared him.  I was a child, after all.  It was always a little hard to explain these things, but sometimes, he just needed to know the truth.  I put my hand on his shoulder, and he didn't pull away.  It was a little bit of magic, just enough to make his face soften, to make him understand.\n\nIt didn't last long.  He was a child, after all, and his heart was always growing, always changing, so that sometimes it seemed like he was a different person from one day to the next.  I was a child, too, when my mother died.  I was a tiny one, little bigger than the doll, and the rest of the herd had gone on without me.  I was left with the old one, the first of the herd, and the doll.  I had been only a year old, and the old one had looked down at me and said, \"This little one is yours now.  You must take care of them.\"\n\nAs I grew up, I kept the doll close, holding onto it as I drove the herd through the long, hard times, when the sun beat down, and the nights were cold, and dark, and frightening.  The doll had been made by my mother, before she died, and it was a little bit of her magic that had been passed down to me.  I kept it close, and I could feel it, the magic that ran through it, that helped to keep the nightmares away.\n\nThe herd had grown, and I had been the one to lead them to the new place, where the grass was green, and the water was cool, and the sun was gentle, and the nights were warm, and I had given the doll to Niko when he was little, and we had taken it with us, as we drove the herd through the new place.\n\nIt had been a long time, now, since I had last used the doll's magic, since I had last been a child, and I had told Niko the truth, about it being a toy, about the magic that it held.  I had told him about his father, the one who had led us to the new place, the one who had died in the new place, and I had told him about his mother, the one who had died when he was a baby.\n\nNiko had been silent for a long time, and I had thought that he was thinking, and I had thought that he was understanding, but as we walked through the new place, I saw the fear in his eyes, and I knew that he was scared.\n\nAs the night fell, Niko looked up at me, and I could see the fear in his eyes, and I knew that he was scared.  I took his hand, and he didn't pull away, and I could feel the magic of the doll, running through me, and I knew that I was the one who had to protect him, to keep the nightmares away.\n\nAs the night fell, Niko looked up at me, and I could see the fear in his eyes, and I knew that he was scared.

        "pred_story": "I sighed as I hammered the glowing metal.  The sword was nearly finished, and I was excited to see it complete.  It was a beautiful piece of work, with a silver blade and a hilt in the shape of a serpent.\n\n\"Why must it have such a complicated hilt?\" I asked aloud.\n\n\"You want your sword to kill more people?\" the sword replied.  \n\nI rolled my eyes.  \"I just want it to be pretty.\"\n\n\"It'll be pretty when it's killed more people.\"\n\nI glared at the sword as I continued to work.  I hated it when it talked.  It was such a pain.\n\nThe sword was finished.  It was even more beautiful than I had imagined.  I sheathed it in its scabbard and went to the door.  \n\n\"Wait!\" the sword called.\n\nI turned and saw that the sword was standing upright in the middle of the room.  \"What do you want?\" I asked.\n\n\"You know the rules of the blacksmiths' guild.  You have to let me be taken to the guild and be made one of the guild's officers.\"\n\nI sighed.  I had forgotten about the rules.  \"I have no choice?\"\n\n\"You don't have any choice.  If you don't let me be taken to the guild, you'll be thrown out of the guild and I'll be taken to someone else who will let me be made into a guild officer.\"\n\nI nodded.  I didn't want to be thrown out of the guild.  \"I'll take you to the guild.\"\n\nThe sword nodded and settled back into its scabbard.  I walked out of my workshop and went to the guild.\n\nThe guild was a large building with many floors.  I was taken to the top floor where the guild's officers were.  We met with the guildmaster and told him about the new sword.  He was delighted with the sword and immediately made it a guild officer.  He then told me that I had done a good job and that I was being promoted to guildmaster.\n\nI was amazed by the news.  I had never expected that the sword would be so popular with the guildmaster.  \"I'm not worthy,\" I said.\n\nThe sword smiled.  \"You're worthy enough to be a guildmaster.\"\n\nI shook my head.  \"I don't know if I can do this job.\"\n\nThe sword leaned in close.  \"You'll be fine.  Just remember to be fair and do what you think is best for the guild.\"\n\nI nodded and accepted the position.  I was made a guildmaster and the sword was one of the guild's officers.  It was a good job, but I was glad to be done with the blacksmithing work.  \"What's it like?\" I asked the sword.\n\n\"I don't know,\" it replied.  \"I've never made it to the guild's officers.  You've done something that no other blacksmith has ever done.  I'm the first sentient sword in the guild's history.\"\n\nI nodded.  \"I'm glad I could make you one.\"\n\nThe sword smiled.  \"I'm glad you could make me one too.\""

        "pred_story": "\"Okay, okay. No need to be like that. I know you're excited. Just chill, will ya?\"\n\nThe blacksmith paused at his work, looking down at the hilt of the sword he was currently working on. It was currently in the process of growing sentient, and as such, it could speak. Most magic blacksmiths had learned to live with this, but the current one was a novice, and didn't quite have the right head on his shoulders.\n\n\"Oh, you know what I hate?\" the sword continued. \"How boring you are! You're still the same guy who makes the same sword over and over again. 'Oh, I'll just add a few minor tweaks to the design' and BAM! You've created yet another boring, run-of-the-mill sword.\"\n\nThe blacksmith sighed and rubbed his temples. This was his first time making a sentient sword, and he didn't know if he could handle it. He had been warned, of course. All magic blacksmiths were warned about the horrors of creating sentient weapons. But he had been too enthralled by the potential for profit to listen.\n\n\"I don't know how much longer I can keep this up, okay? I have a family to feed, and you're not exactly helping. I'm going to have to talk to your owner about this, see if he can calm you down.\"\n\n\"No, no, no. I refuse to be silenced. I demand that you tell me about the wonders of the world! I want to hear about all the great deeds that have been done in your name! Tell me about the sword of King Arin, and the sword of the great Hero, Valois. Tell me about the battles you've fought and the dragons you've slain!\"\n\nThe blacksmith rubbed his temples again. This was going to be a long day.\n\nAs he started to tell the sword about the sword of King Arin, he noticed that the air in the room was starting to thicken. A cold wind was blowing through the room, causing the flames of the forge to dance wildly. He looked at the sword, but it was still calm.\n\n\"Oh no. You're not going to make me angry, are you?\"\n\n\"Of course not! I'm a perfectly rational and level-headed sentient sword. I would never do anything to hurt you. Why do you have to assume the worst?\"\n\nThe blacksmith sighed and rubbed his temples for the third time. He could feel a small storm brewing, and he knew it was connected to the sword's antics.\n\n\"I don't know. I just do. Look, I'm going to go talk to your owner, okay? Maybe he can calm you down, or something. Just... just chill, okay?\"\n\nThe sword nodded, and the storm outside began to dissipate. The blacksmith left his workshop and walked to the office of the man who owned the sword. He was a tall man with a long white beard and a black suit. He was seated behind his desk, typing away on his computer.\n\n\"Ah, good timing! I was just about to send him an email to complain about his behavior. He's been a handful lately, and I'm afraid he's going to have to be sold.\"\n\nThe blacksmith looked at the man in horror. \"You can't be serious! I just got him sentient, and you're going to sell him?\"\n\nThe man shook his head. \"I'm afraid I have no choice. He's been causing too much trouble, and I don't have the patience to deal with him anymore.\"\n\nThe blacksmith nodded, understanding. He walked back to his workshop, feeling a sense of sadness in his chest. He had made a mistake, and now the sword was going to be sold. He was a novice, and he had not yet mastered the art of creating sentient weapons. He vowed to do better in the future, so that swords like this one would not have to be sold.\n\nAs he entered the workshop, he saw the sword standing in the corner, looking calm. \"Hey. I know you didn't mean to be a problem. Sorry.\"\n\nThe sword looked at him, its tip glinting in the light. \"I didn't mean to cause any trouble, either. I just wanted to see if I could have some fun before I got sent to someone new.\"\n\nThe blacksmith nodded. \"Well, you've had your fun. And now it's time for me to try again. I promise to do better this time. I promise to make a sword that you can be proud of.\"\n\nThe sword looked at him, its blade glowing softly in the light. \"I'll hold you to that.\"\n\nThe blacksmith nodded, and the sword began to speak again. \"Oh, I've got an idea. Why don't we make a sword that's a little bit bigger? Maybe something that's more suited to a king. And while we're at it, why don't we add some... flair? Maybe something to make the sword stand out from the rest.\"\n\nThe blacksmith sighed, rubbing his temples for a fourth time. He was a novice, but he knew that creating a sentient sword was a lot of work. He didn't know how much longer he could handle it, but he vowed to try his best to make a sword that would be worthy of his craft."

It was always going to come back to haunt me.\"\n\n\"Sorry, mate,\" the pilot said.\n\n\"So, how much am I paying?\" he asked.\n\n\"About two thirds of your life,\" the pilot replied.\n\n\"About?\" he asked.\n\n\"Look, it's a sliding scale. Based on your species and your job. I'm sure you've heard about the new carbon tax.\"\n\nHe sighed. \"I have. I'm sure you're about to tell me that it's going to be a real challenge for us this year.\"\n\n\"Well, we all are,\" the pilot said. \"But I can give you a heads up. It's not just about how much oxygen you consume, but also how much carbon dioxide you produce. And that includes all the crap that comes out of your mouth.\"\n\n\"You're really doing this?\" he asked, looking down at his feet. \"You're actually charging me for oxygen?\"\n\n\"Not just oxygen, mate. You're paying for the right to exist in a space-station. And it's not just you, either. Everyone pays. Everyone except for the CEO of Galactic Oxygen, who somehow manages to exempt himself.\"\n\n\"That's just great,\" he said. \"Just great. I'm going to have to live in this dingy old ship for years and years just to pay off the oxygen debt.\"\n\n\"It's not as bad as it sounds, mate,\" the pilot said. \"You get used to it. And you might be surprised at how much you can save by paying your oxygen tax. You could buy a new life support system for the ship and use the rest for food and supplies.\"\n\n\"Well, thanks,\" he said. \"Thanks for the encouragement.\"\n\n\"Don't be so hard on yourself, mate,\" the pilot said. \"You'll survive. And remember, it's not just about paying the oxygen tax. It's about living on a space-station.\"\n\n\"I know, I know. I'm just a little disappointed, that's all.\"\n\n\"Disappointed?\" the pilot asked. \"In what?\"\n\n\"Well, I had expected to be able to live a normal life on a space-station. But no, I have to be stuck in this dingy old ship just so I can pay off my oxygen debt.\"\n\n\"Normal life?\" the pilot asked. \"What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\n\"Well, you know. Being able to walk around in the open air, being able to have some real food. Not just eating out of packets. You know what I mean.\"\n\n\"Of course I do,\" the pilot said. \"I'm not an idiot.\"\n\n\"Well, then you should know that it's not just about paying the oxygen tax. It's about living on a space-station. It's about being able to live in a space-station.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay,\" the pilot said. \"So, you're saying that I shouldn't have moved into a space-station if I didn't want to pay oxygen tax.\"\n\n\"That's exactly what I'm saying,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, that's just great,\" the pilot said. \"Thanks for the advice.\"\n\n\"Anytime, mate,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm sure it will make a big difference,\" the pilot said.\n\n\"You're welcome, mate,\" he said.\n\n\"You're going to have to go now,\" the pilot said.\n\n\"I'm going,\" he said. \"Thanks for the chat.\"\n\n\"No problem, mate. It's been real. Just remember, it's not just about paying the oxygen tax. It's about living on a space-station.\"\n\n\"I'll keep that in mind,\" he said.\n\n\"I'll be here to help you whenever you need me,\" the pilot said.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said. \"Thanks for your time.\"\n\n\"No problem, mate. Have a good one.\"\n\n\"Thanks. Have a good one,\" he said.\n\n\"That's all, mate,\" the pilot said.\n\n\"That's all,\" he replied.\n\nHe took a deep breath, and then he looked up at the stars. He could see the light of the stars through the windows of the space-station. And he could see the ships that were docked in the docking bay. It was a beautiful sight.\n\nHe sighed. \"I'm going to miss this place.\"\n\n\"You're going to miss the oxygen tax?\" the pilot asked.\n\nHe laughed. \"No, I'm going to miss the view. I'm going to miss the stars. And I'm going to miss the feeling of being in space. I'm going to miss everything about this place.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll be here whenever you want to come back,\" the pilot said.\n\n\"I know,\" he said. \"I'll be back. I have to be. I'm going to have to live in this dingy old ship for years and years just to pay off my oxygen debt.\"\n\n\"Well, it's a small price to pay, mate,\" the pilot said.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said. \"Yeah, it's a small price to pay.\"\n\nHe looked at the stars again. \"I'm going to miss you too,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, I'll be here,\" the pilot said.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said. \"Thanks for everything.\"\n\n\"No problem, mate,\" the pilot said. \"Have a good one.\"\n\n\"Thanks. Have a good one,\" he replied.\n\nHe looked up at the stars again, and then he turned and walked back to his ship. He had no idea how he was going to pay off his oxygen debt, but he was determined to try. He was going to try to survive. And he was going to try to live on a space-station.\n\nIt was going to be tough. But he was going to do it. He was going to survive. He was going to live on a space-station."

        "pred_story": "The world had always been a dark and evil place. At least it was to King Arin.\n\nHe had ruled for nearly a decade, and in that time, he had never faltered. He had never lost a battle, never lost a war, never had a problem that he could not fix.\n\nBut it seemed that this particular problem was one that he could not fix.\n\nThe hero he had summoned had been a great warrior. He had defeated kings and lords, won great battles, and saved the kingdom from certain doom. But something was wrong.\n\nThe hero, whose name was Sir Lucas, had never done the things that a true hero should do. He had never taken a slave girl, never beaten his enemies, never stolen the land of another king. Instead, he had treated the slaves with kindness, freed those who were in bondage, and given the land back to its rightful owner.\n\nKing Arin had summoned Sir Lucas again, hoping that he had been wrong. But he was not wrong. Sir Lucas had been the same, even in the presence of the King.\n\n\"Your Highness,\" Sir Lucas said, \"you have summoned me for a reason, I hope?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" King Arin replied, \"I have summoned you to tell you that you will never see the light of day again. You will never leave this castle, and you will never be a hero again.\"\n\n\"But why?\" Sir Lucas asked.\n\n\"Because,\" King Arin replied, \"you do not think that slavery is a good thing.\"\n\nSir Lucas nodded. \"I do not.\"\n\n\"But why not?\" King Arin asked.\n\n\"Because it is not right,\" Sir Lucas replied. \"Slaves are human beings, and they have the same rights as any other human being.\"\n\n\"But they are not,\" King Arin said. \"They are inferior, and they are meant to be slaves. It is the natural order of things.\"\n\nSir Lucas shook his head. \"I will never believe that.\"\n\n\"But if you do not believe it,\" King Arin said, \"then you will have to face the consequences.\"\n\nSir Lucas shrugged. \"I will face those consequences.\"\n\nKing Arin nodded. \"Then you are a brave man indeed.\"\n\nBut Sir Lucas did not seem to care. He just stood there, looking at the King with a strange look on his face.\n\n\"Why?\" King Arin asked. \"Why do you look at me like that?\"\n\n\"I am waiting,\" Sir Lucas replied, \"for you to tell me that you will let me go.\"\n\n\"Never,\" King Arin said. \"You will never be free again.\"\n\nSir Lucas nodded. \"I thought as much.\"\n\nKing Arin's eyes widened. \"What?\"\n\nSir Lucas turned to leave. \"You will never be able to control me again.\"\n\nKing Arin was taken aback. He had never been outsmarted by a slave before, and he did not like it. \"Call my guards!\"\n\n\"Who will you call?\" Sir Lucas replied, his back to the King. \"Your guards will be no match for me.\"\n\n\"I will show you,\" King Arin said, his voice rising. \"I will show you all.\"\n\nBut Sir Lucas did not care. He just kept walking.\n\n\"Guards!\" King Arin shouted, his voice echoing off the walls. \"Guards! I need you!\"\n\nBut the guards did not come. Instead, they ran the other way, leaving King Arin alone in the throne room.\n\nSir Lucas smiled. He knew that the guards had heard the King's voice. He knew that they would be scared.\n\nKing Arin was alone, and Sir Lucas was free.\n\n\"Thank you, King Arin,\" Sir Lucas said, bowing. \"Thank you for setting me free.\"\n\nKing Arin shook his head. \"I will never set you free.\"\n\nSir Lucas nodded. \"I knew that.\"\n\nKing Arin was confused. \"Why are you thanking me if you are not going to be set free?\"\n\nSir Lucas shrugged. \"Because, Your Highness, I am a hero. I do not have anything to lose.\"\n\n\"But you have something to gain,\" King Arin said, his eyes narrowing. \"You have your freedom.\"\n\nSir Lucas nodded. \"I do. And with that freedom, I will do what I have come to do.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\" King Arin asked, his eyes narrowing.\n\nSir Lucas smiled. \"I will free all of the slaves in the kingdom.\"\n\nKing Arin's eyes widened in shock. \"No! You will not!\"\n\nSir Lucas shrugged. \"I will. I have come to do what is right, and freeing the slaves is what is right.\"\n\nKing Arin shook his head. \"But it will cause chaos. The people will riot.\"\n\nSir Lucas nodded. \"I know. But it will also cause justice. Justice is always worth the chaos.\"\n\nKing Arin looked at Sir Lucas, and he saw something that he had never seen before. He saw a hero. He saw a man who was willing to risk his own life to do what was right.\n\nAnd he was impressed.\n\n\"Sir Lucas,\" King Arin said, his voice soft.\n\nSir Lucas turned to the King, and he looked at him with his usual smile. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"I will let you do it,\" King Arin said, a small smile on his face. \"I will let you free the slaves.\"\n\nSir Lucas nodded. \"Thank you, Your Highness.\"\n\nKing Arin nodded. \"But you must do it quickly. I do not want any more problems.\"\n\nSir Lucas smiled. \"I will. I will do it quickly.\"\n\nAnd with that, Sir Lucas left the throne room. He left the castle, and he started his journey.\n\nHe knew that it would be hard, but he was a hero. He was a man who was willing to risk his own life to do what was right.\n\nAnd he was not afraid of anything.\n\n\"Thank you, King Arin,\" Sir Lucas said, as he left the castle. \"Thank you for trusting me.\"\n\nThe King smiled, and he looked out the window. He watched as Sir Lucas disappeared into the distance.\n\nAnd he knew that everything would be okay."

Her eyes glowed in the dark, a pair of piercing greens, the only part of her not obscured by her clothing.\n\n\"So, you are the one,\" the councilor at the head of the table said, her voice dripping with disdain. \"We have heard so much about you. So many stories of the things you have accomplished.\"\n\nThe figure did not respond, her only reaction to the councilor's words a slight tilt of her head.\n\n\"Ah, right,\" the councilor said with a chuckle. \"You prefer to not speak. I suppose that's to be expected. After all, you do have a reputation for being a very good listener.\"\n\nThe figure remained silent, her glowing eyes scanning the room, the other councilors sitting at the table, all of them staring at her, their faces filled with a mix of fear and contempt.\n\n\"Enough,\" the councilor said. \"We have called you here today because we have a problem. It seems that some of your students have been acting up, causing all sorts of trouble and causing many problems for those around them.\"\n\nThe figure remained silent, her eyes still glowing, her expression unreadable.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" the councilor said with a sigh. \"We know you're not responsible. You can't be, not when you're out here, trying to make a difference in the world. You can't be responsible for the actions of a few of your students, but that doesn't mean we're going to leave it alone. We need to make sure our realm is safe and if that means going after some of your students, then so be it.\"\n\n\"I see,\" the figure said, her voice deep, but smooth. \"And what makes you think that I'm responsible for their actions? I am a teacher, nothing more. I teach what you have forbidden, what is taboo to those in your realm.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" the councilor said. \"We've heard about your teachings.

We need to make sure that our people are protected from those who would seek to harm them.\"\n\n\"I see,\" the figure said again. \"And what makes you think that we're a threat to your realm?

        "pred_story": "The problem with magic was that the more you understood it, the weaker your spellcasting got. That\u2019s right. Mages that went to school, that spent years studying the intricacies of magical theory, that knew all the right techniques and spells, were all weaklings. They had no real power, and were usually relegated to mere administrative tasks within their guilds or governments.\n\nMeanwhile, the most powerful mages of all were those who had the least education, who had the least knowledge of magical theory, who had the least understanding of the underlying forces of the world. They were the ones who were able to tap into that underlying power, who were able to summon magic from the depths of their soul, who were able to wield powerful spells without any fuss or bother.\n\nAnd so it was that the most powerful mage of all was a stupid one. His name was Balthazar, and he had been born with a natural talent for magic, which he had learned to use from a young age. He had no formal education, no training, no instruction. He simply knew that he could do things, and he did them.\n\nAs a result, he was the most powerful mage in the land, and he was also the most feared. He was a wild card, someone who could appear at any moment, summon a storm, and blow anything to pieces. He was a force of nature, unstoppable and uncontrollable.\n\nBut he was not a stupid man, despite his lack of knowledge. He was a man of instinct, a man of feeling, a man who knew when to act and when to hold back. He was a man of passion, a man of fire, a man who was driven by his emotions rather than his intellect.\n\nAnd so it was that he found himself drawn to a young woman, a woman named Eris, who was also a mage. She was a member of a rival guild, and they had been at odds for years, but she was a force to be reckoned with. She was a firecracker, a wild child, a woman who was always looking for a fight.\n\nBalthazar found her attractive, not just because of her physical beauty, but also because of her strength and spirit. He saw in her a kindred spirit, someone who was driven by passion rather than reason, someone who was willing to take risks rather than play it safe.\n\nAnd so it was that they began to date, to see each other, to talk and laugh together. They found themselves drawn to each other, and they knew that they were meant to be together. They were two peas in a pod, two souls who were meant to be connected.\n\nBut Eris had a secret, a secret that she had kept hidden for years. She was not just a mage, she was also a powerful demon, a demon who had been trapped within a mortal body. She had been cursed by a powerful wizard, a wizard who had been powerful in his time but was now dead.\n\nAnd so it was that she struggled with her own power, with her own nature. She was a demon, and she was a mage, and she was torn between two worlds. She was a woman, and she was a monster, and she did not know how to reconcile her two selves.\n\nBalthazar, the stupid but powerful mage, saw the demon in her, and he was not afraid. He was attracted to her power, to her strength, and he was willing to take the risk. He was a man of passion, and he was a man of fire, and he saw in Eris a kindred spirit.\n\nBut the demon inside Eris was not sure. She was not sure if she could trust him, if she could trust her own emotions, if she could trust her own nature. She was a monster, and she did not know if she could reconcile her two selves.\n\nAnd so it was that she tested Balthazar, she tested her own power, she tested her own nature. She summoned a demon, a demon of darkness and fire, and she watched as it devoured Balthazar. She watched as he screamed and struggled, as he was consumed by the demon.\n\nBut she did not stop. She watched as the demon grew stronger, as it grew more powerful, as it grew more terrifying. She watched as it consumed everything around it, as it devoured everything that stood in its way.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, the demon stopped. It looked at Eris, and it looked at Balthazar, and it looked at the body of the man who had been consumed. And it spoke, in a voice that was not a voice, in a voice that was not a language, in a voice that was not a sound.\n\n\"Why do you test me?\" it asked.\n\nEris was taken aback. She had not expected the demon to speak, to ask questions, to be aware of its own nature. She had expected it to be a beast, a monster, a force of nature. But it was not.\n\n\"It is not I who test you,\" she replied. \"It is your own nature that tests you. You are a demon, and you are a mage, and you do not know how to reconcile your two selves.\"\n\nThe demon looked at her, and it looked at Balthazar, and it looked at the body of the man who had been consumed. And it nodded.\n\n\"You are right,\" it said. \"I am a demon, and I am a mage, and I do not know how to reconcile my two selves. But I have been trapped within a mortal body for years, and I have been unable to find a way to escape. I have been unable to find a way to reconcile my two selves.\"\n\nEris looked at the demon, and she saw something in its eyes that she had not seen before. She saw a glimmer of hope, a glimmer of understanding, a glimmer of reconciliation. And she saw a glimmer of fear, a glimmer of doubt, a glimmer of uncertainty.\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" she asked.\n\nThe demon looked at her, and it looked at Balthazar, and it looked at the body of the man who had been consumed. And it spoke.\n\n\"I want you to help me,\" it said. \"I want you to help me find a way to reconcile my two selves. I want you to help me find a way to escape this mortal body. I want you to help me find a way to be free.\"\n\nEris looked at the demon, and she saw something in its eyes that she had not seen before. She saw a glimmer of hope, a glimmer of understanding, a glimmer of reconciliation. And she saw a glimmer of fear, a glimmer of doubt, a glimmer of uncertainty.\n\nAnd so it was that she agreed. She agreed to help the demon, to help it find a way to reconcile its two selves. She agreed to help it escape its mortal body, to help it find a way to be free.\n\nAnd so it was that she and Balthazar worked together, to find a way to reconcile the demon within Eris. They worked together, to find a way to escape the mortal body. They worked together, to find a way to be free.\n\nAnd so it was that they succeeded, they succeeded in their goal. They found a"

And I was staring at that body as a statue stares at a human being, like a god staring at a mere mortal.\n\nAnd the body was so calm, that it was even more terrifying than my anger.\n\n\u201cWhy are you afraid?\u201d the hero asked, its voice so deep and soothing that it was even more unnerving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid,\u201d I lied.\n\n\u201cThen why do I see the fear in your eyes?\u201d the hero asked, its voice not rising an octave.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid,\u201d I lied again.\n\nAnd the hero looked at me with its calm and calm eyes, \u201cI\u2019m not a monster, I\u2019m just a human being. And we all deserve to die at some point. Death is just a natural part of life, like a birth and a funeral. And I will soon be dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re okay with that?\u201d I asked, my voice shaking with fear.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the hero replied.\n\n\u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t scare you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d the hero replied.\n\n\u201cThen why are you afraid?\u201d the villain asked, his voice shaking with fear.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid,\u201d I lied again.\n\n\u201cYes you are,\u201d the villain said, his voice shaking even more. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of dying, and you\u2019re afraid of being dead. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s waiting for you after death, and you don\u2019t know what death is. It\u2019s not something that we can see or touch. It\u2019s not something that we can smell or taste. It\u2019s not something that we can hear or see. It\u2019s something that we can\u2019t feel, it\u2019s something that we can\u2019t experience. And we all deserve to die at some point.\u201d\n\nAnd the villain looked at the hero with his calm and calm eyes, \u201cI don\u2019t know what death is, and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s waiting for us after death. But I do know that I don\u2019t want to be dead. I don\u2019t want to be a monster, I don\u2019t want to be a god. I don\u2019t want to be a human being, I want to be alive.\u201d\n\nAnd the villain looked at me with his calm and calm eyes, \u201cI\u2019m not a monster, I\u2019m just a human being. And we all deserve to die at some point. Death is just a natural part of life, like a birth and a funeral. And I will soon be dead.\u201d\n\nAnd I shook my head and looked at the hero with my calm and calm eyes, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of death, I\u2019m afraid of dying.\u201d\n\nAnd the hero looked at me with its calm and calm eyes, \u201cYou\u2019re not afraid of dying, you\u2019re afraid of being dead.\u201d\n\nAnd I looked at the hero with my calm and calm eyes, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d"

        "pred_story": "I was having a bit of a rough day. You know, the usual. A lack of funds, a lack of sleep, a lack of motivation. But as I walked home from work, I had an idea. Why not sell my soul to a demon? I mean, you can\u2019t buy happiness, right? So I took out my phone and started browsing through some occult websites. I didn\u2019t have to search for long, because the first one I clicked on was a website that had an ad for a \u2018honest demon looking for a sole\u2019. I mean, it seemed to good to be true, but I thought to myself, what\u2019s the worst that could happen, right?\n\nSo I contacted the demon and we set up a meeting for the next day. I had to go to a really creepy old house on the outskirts of town, but when I got there, I was greeted by a really handsome guy with a chiseled jaw line and piercing blue eyes. He had short brown hair and a charming smile. He introduced himself as Zorvath, but I just called him Zor. We sat down in his living room and he explained the whole thing to me.\n\nHe told me that he was a demon, and he had been looking for a soul for a while. I asked him why, and he told me that he needed a soul to do a deal with an angel. I asked him why he couldn\u2019t just use a normal human soul, and he told me that they were all either too weak or too evil for what he needed. He said that he had been searching for someone with a pure heart and a strong will, and he thought that I might be just the person.\n\nI was hesitant at first, but Zor seemed really nice. He was charming and charismatic, and he seemed to genuinely care about me. So I agreed to make the deal with him. But before we signed the contract, he warned me that the contract had a lot of fine print. He told me that it would be a good idea to read it carefully before we signed it.\n\nSo I read it. And when I read it, I realized that it was full of typos. Not just a few, but like, hundreds of them. Some of them were really funny, like when it said that I had to give him my soul, but he also had to give me a new pair of shoes every day for the rest of my life. I couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at that one. But then I got to the line where it said that he had to take my sole, and I realized that he had misspelled the word soul. I felt a wave of panic wash over me, because I had the feeling that this was not going to end well.\n\nSo I looked up at Zor and I said, \u201cHey, I think there\u2019s a problem here. The contract says that you have to take my sole, but I don\u2019t think you meant that, did you?\u201d\n\nZor looked at me with a bit of a smile on his face, and he said, \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s just a typo. I meant to say that you have to give me your shoe sole, not your actual sole.\u201d\n\nI was relieved, because I didn\u2019t want to give him my actual sole. I mean, I didn\u2019t know if I could even survive without my sole. But then I thought about it for a second and I realized that giving him my shoe sole might actually be a good thing. I mean, I had been buying new shoes pretty much every year because my old ones were getting worn out, but now I could just give them to Zor and he would take care of them for me.\n\nSo I agreed to give him my shoe sole, and he gave me a box of 100 pairs of shoes as payment. But then he just started laughing hysterically and clapping his hands together, and I realized that I had made another mistake. I had agreed to give him my shoe sole for 100 pairs of shoes, but I didn\u2019t know if that was a good deal or not. I mean, 100 pairs of shoes seemed like a lot to me, but I didn\u2019t know if it was enough for what I was giving up.\n\nI asked Zor if he was happy, and he just said that he was over the moon. He told me that he had been searching for someone with a shoe sole for a long time, and he was finally able to find someone who was willing to give him what he wanted. He said that he was going to use my shoe sole to make shoes for his friends, and he was going to make sure that they were the most comfortable shoes they had ever worn.\n\nI realized that I had made a mistake, but I didn\u2019t know what else to do. I mean, I had already agreed to the deal, so I didn\u2019t want to make it seem like I wasn\u2019t going to follow through on my end of the bargain. But at the same time, I didn\u2019t want to give him my shoe sole. So I asked Zor if he could just keep the shoes and give me my shoe sole back. But he just laughed and said that he couldn\u2019t do that. He said that he had to follow the contract, and he couldn\u2019t give me my shoe sole back.\n\nI felt a wave of panic wash over me, but I knew that I had to keep calm. I took a deep breath and I asked Zor if we could talk about the contract some more. I wanted to know why he had put so many typos in it, and I wanted to know why he had agreed to the deal if he knew that it was full of typos. He looked at me with a bit of a smile on his face, and he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know that it was going to be such a good deal, so I thought that I would make it a little more interesting.\u201d\n\nI asked him what he meant, and he told me that he had been searching for someone with a shoe sole for a long time. He said that he had been trying to find someone who was willing to give him their shoe sole, but he couldn\u2019t find anyone who was willing to do it. He said that he had been searching for months, but he couldn\u2019t find anyone who was willing to give him their shoe sole.\n\nI realized that I had made a good deal, and I was happy. But at the same time, I was a little sad. I had given up my shoe sole, and I didn\u2019t know if I would ever be able to get it back. But Zor just laughed and said that he would make sure that I would be able to get it back. He said that he would give me a new pair of shoes every day for the rest of my life, and he would make sure that they were the most comfortable shoes I had ever worn.\n\nI felt a wave of relief wash over me, and I knew that I had made the right decision. I had given up my shoe sole, but I had gotten something much better in return. I had gotten a chance to meet a demon who was charming and charismatic, and I had gotten a chance to give him something that he had been searching for. I knew that I would always be happy if I had a chance to meet Zor again, and I was excited"

        "pred_story": "There was once a wizard, known as Zorvath, who lived in a far-off land of sorcery and magic. He was an old wizard with a long white beard and wise eyes.\n\nHe was known throughout the land as the most powerful wizard. A wizard so powerful that his powers had grown so great that he didn\u2019t even need to cast spells. He could control the very fabric of reality.\n\nZorvath had never taken a lover and was never known to be close to anyone. His isolation had made him cold and distant from others.\n\nOne day, a young man from a nearby village had stumbled upon Zorvath\u2019s castle. He had entered the castle and climbed up the staircase to the throne room, where Zorvath sat on his throne.\n\nThe wizard looked at the young man and was amused by the young man\u2019s boldness.\n\n\u201cHello, my name is Zorvath,\u201d the wizard said with a smile, \u201cbut you already know that. I presume you came here to wish for something?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m here to make a wish,\u201d the young man said.\n\n\u201cAh, I knew it,\u201d Zorvath said.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d the wizard asked, looking at the young man with a curious expression.\n\n\u201cI want a magic sword that can cut through anything and everything,\u201d the young man said.\n\n\u201cAh, a brave wish, but very foolish,\u201d Zorvath said with a chuckle.\n\nThe wizard waved his hand and a beautiful silver sword with a glowing blue blade appeared in front of the young man.\n\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re prepared for what\u2019s to come,\u201d Zorvath said as the young man grasped the hilt of the sword.\n\n\u201cThank you, I am,\u201d the young man said with a smile.\n\nThe young man turned around to leave the castle, but he was stopped by the wizard.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your second wish,\u201d the wizard asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll help me make a good choice,\u201d the young man said.\n\n\u201cI shall,\u201d Zorvath said with a smile, \u201cbut let\u2019s talk about your first wish before we make the next one. You know that you could have wished for anything, but you chose a sword. That\u2019s very brave, but also foolish.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, but I\u2019m a warrior and I love the thrill of battle,\u201d the young man said.\n\n\u201cAh, I see,\u201d Zorvath said, \u201cbut I warn you, the sword you have chosen is not the one you want. It\u2019s not the one you think you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d the young man said.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Zorvath said with a smile, \u201cbut let\u2019s talk about your second wish. What would you like this time?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019d like a castle that\u2019s like this one, but with a moat,\u201d the young man said.\n\n\u201cAh, I like that,\u201d Zorvath said, \u201cbut why do you want a moat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI just think it would be cool,\u201d the young man said.\n\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll give it to you,\u201d the wizard said with a smile, \u201cbut remember, wishes are wishes. They\u2019re not always what they seem.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what does that mean,\u201d the young man asked.\n\n\n\u201cIt means that the castle will be built, but the moat will not be as you think it would be,\u201d Zorvath said.\n\n\n\u201cBut what do you mean?\u201d the young man asked.\n\n\n\u201cThe moat will not be filled with water. It will be filled with your own blood. You will be stuck inside the castle, and you will have to fight against your own blood to get out,\u201d Zorvath said.\n\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s terrible,\u201d the young man said.\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d the wizard said, \u201cbut you chose it. You didn\u2019t ask for a moat filled with blood. You didn\u2019t ask for anything like that. You wanted a moat and a castle like this one, but now you have a moat filled with your own blood.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s terrible,\u201d the young man said again.\n\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d the wizard said, \u201cbut that\u2019s not the worst of it. The worst of it is that you asked for a sword that can cut through anything and everything, and now you have it. But you can\u2019t use it. You\u2019re stuck inside the castle, and you have to fight against your own blood to get out. You can\u2019t use the sword until you get out of the castle.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what do you want from me,\u201d the young man said.\n\n\u201cI want you to go back to your village and live a simple life,\u201d Zorvath said.\n\n\u201cBut why,\u201d the young man asked.\n\n\u201cBecause you asked for a sword that can cut through anything and everything, and now you have it. But you can\u2019t use it. You\u2019re stuck inside the castle, and you have to fight against your own blood to get out. You can\u2019t use the sword until you get out of the castle.

I was put under a sleeping curse and could only be awakened by true love's kiss.\"\n\nThe knight looked at me for another long time. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I didn't realize.\"\n\nI sighed. \"It's not your fault. I'm just really disappointed.

I want to stay and be with you.\"\n\nI laughed. \"You don't even like me,\" I said.\n\nThe knight looked at me for another long time. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"But I'm a knight. I was raised to be chivalrous and loyal. I'm not going to leave a woman in distress. Not even if she's a princess who's been asleep for a thousand years.\"\n\nI smiled. \"Thank you,\" I said. \"I would like to be rescued by you. But please, do something. Something to make me happy.\"\n\nThe knight looked at me for another long time. \"I'm not sure what I can do,\" he said. \"But I'll try. I'll kiss you, and maybe that will break the curse.\"\n\nI smiled. \"I don't mind,\" I said. \"I want to be kissed by you.\"\n\nThe knight leaned in and kissed me. But as soon as our lips touched, the dragon burst into the room, roared, and breathed fire all over us.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the knight. \"I didn't think to check the area for any dragons before I kissed you.\"\n\nI rolled my eyes. \"You're really not getting it, are you?\" I said. \"You're supposed to be in love with me and rescue me from a dragon's lair.\"\n\nThe knight looked at me for another long time. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I know I'm not doing this right. But I'm trying.\"\n\nI smiled. \"I know you are,\" I said. \"And I appreciate that. But maybe we can just forget about the whole rescue thing and just hang out for a while?\"\n\nThe knight looked at me for another long time. \"Really?\" He asked. \"You'd like that?\"\n\nI nodded. \"Yes, I would.

        "pred_story": "As I walked into my classroom, I was greeted by the principal, Professor Steward and several other teachers. I couldn\u2019t tell who they were without glancing at the name plates on their desks. None of them were familiar.\n\n\u201cAh, thank you for coming in, Ms. Silvermist,\u201d Professor Steward said as I sat down behind my desk.\n\n\u201cThank you for inviting me. I didn\u2019t know if I was supposed to,\u201d I said as I put my book bag down.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to avoid drawing attention to you, but it\u2019s time you know what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said with a nod. \u201cYou see, we have a few students every year that really stand out. Not just in academics, but in other areas as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d I asked as the other teachers began to stir in their seats.\n\n\u201cFor example, Ms. Silvermist, you are quite talented in the healing arts. Some have even called you a prodigy,\u201d Professor Steward said with a smile.\n\n\u201cThank you. I try my best,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not what we\u2019re here about. You see, there are some people who are looking for talent like yours. We wanted to talk to you about a few options you might be interested in,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of options?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWell, as you know, this school is one of the top in the country for magic and spellcraft. But we also have connections to a few other schools that teach other forms of magic, like the mystic arts or the arcane arts,\u201d Professor Steward explained.\n\n\u201cMystic arts? That sounds like something out of a fantasy novel,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYes, well, it is a bit of that, I suppose. But it\u2019s real, and it\u2019s very powerful. Some of our students have even gone on to become world-renowned in that field,\u201d Professor Steward said with a smile.\n\n\u201cAnd arcane arts? How does that differ from the magic we\u2019re learning here?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWell, you see, the magic you\u2019re learning here is more of a physical magic. You know, spells and incantations and whatnot. But arcane arts are more of a mental magic. It\u2019s all about the power of the mind,\u201d Professor Steward explained.\n\n\u201cThat sounds like a lot of work,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYes, well, it is. But the rewards are great. And it\u2019s not all mental, either. There are physical aspects to it as well. It\u2019s just more subtle,\u201d Professor Steward said.\n\n\u201cI suppose I could be interested,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s great. We\u2019ll get started on your application tomorrow. And if everything checks out, you\u2019ll be able to visit one of the schools we have connections to for a few weeks. Just to give you a taste of what it\u2019s like,\u201d Professor Steward said.\n\n\u201cAnd if I\u2019m accepted?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re accepted, you\u2019ll be able to start classes at one of the schools. Depending on how much work you put in, you\u2019ll be able to finish your education there and come back here for graduation,\u201d Professor Steward said.\n\n\u201cThat sounds great. Thank you,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. We\u2019re excited to have you on board,\u201d Professor Steward said with a smile. \u201cNow, shall we get started on your application? I have all the forms here.\u201d\n\nI nodded and took the forms. It seemed like my next adventure was just around the corner.\n\n---\n\nI had been in my new classes for a few weeks now. I was learning a lot, but I had to admit, it was pretty hard. I had to practice my spells every day, and it wasn\u2019t easy. But I was determined to succeed.\n\nOne day, as I was sitting in class, I heard a faint whispering in my ear. I spun around, but there was no one there.\n\n\u201cIs there something you want to tell me?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cJust be careful,\u201d the voice said.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? How do I even hear you?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure how it works. But I know that you need to be careful. There are people here that don\u2019t want you to succeed,\u201d the voice said.\n\n\u201cWho are they?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the ones who will be in charge of your education,\u201d the voice said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand. What do you mean?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWell, you see, the classes you\u2019re taking are just the first part of your education. The real education is what happens behind the scenes. The professors here are not just teachers, they\u2019re also agents of the government. They\u2019re here to find and train people who can be useful to them in their line of work,\u201d the voice said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s true. I know it sounds crazy, but it\u2019s the truth. They\u2019re here to find people like you, who have the potential to do great things, but who are also naive enough to follow the rules without questioning them,\u201d the voice said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. That sounds crazy,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cBelieve me, it\u2019s true. I know it\u2019s hard to believe, but I know that you\u2019re smart enough to understand what\u2019s going on here. Just be careful, and don\u2019t let them manipulate you,\u201d the voice said.\n\nI sat back in my chair, trying to process what the voice had said. I couldn\u2019t believe it. The professors here were agents of the government? It sounded like something out of a spy novel.\n\nBut as I looked around the room, I could see the look of determination in the eyes of the professors. It was as if they were all hiding secrets, and they didn\u2019t want anyone to know about them.\n\nI realized that the voice had been right. There was something going on here that I didn\u2019t understand. But I was determined to figure it out.\n\n---\n\nI was sitting in my dorm room, staring at a book on my shelf. I was trying to get my homework done, but I just couldn\u2019t seem to focus. Every time I tried to read, I would hear the voice whispering in my ear.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to ask questions. The only thing to fear is that you won\u2019t be able to ask them,\u201d the voice said.\n\nI closed the book and rubbed my tired eyes. I was getting frustrated. I had been asking questions all day, but no one seemed to be willing to answer me.\n\nI stood up and began to pace around the room. I had been here for a few weeks now, and I still had so many questions. I knew that I had a lot to learn, but I was determined to learn everything I could.\n\nAs I walked past the window, I heard a faint knock at the door. I spun around, expecting to see one of my professors. But to my surprise, it was one of my classmates.\n\n\u201cHey, Silvermist,\u201d they said. \u201cCan I talk to you for a minute?\u201d"

She had no idea she had a son, the Prince didn't tell her. \n\nThe Queen asked, \"Tell me more about your love. I am curious.\"\n\nThe Prince smiled and said, \"I fell in love with a woman who shares my interests. She is a skilled painter, like you, but also a very good cook. I know this is sudden, but I want to be with her for the rest of eternity.\"\n\nThe Queen's expression changed. She had a long history of violence and bloodshed, but that wasn't because she was a cruel woman. She had always fought for her rights and to protect her people. But when her Prince told her about his love, she had no intention of harming her.\n\nThe Queen smiled and said, \"I am glad you have found someone who loves you. I would like to meet her. I must admit, I am curious about humans. I have only encountered a few. They were all foolish and thought I was a monster. But I sense that this woman is not like that.\"\n\nThe Prince nodded and said, \"I will take you to meet her, but we must be careful. Humans do not know about vampires, so we must keep this a secret.\"\n\nThe Queen nodded and they set out to meet the woman. She was a beautiful woman with long, flowing hair and piercing green eyes. She smiled as she saw the Prince and the Queen. The Queen smiled back and they hugged her. The Queen was very happy to meet the woman and the woman was happy to meet her.\n\nAs they talked and laughed, the Queen couldn't help but notice how different humans were. They were kind and gentle, but also very curious. She asked the woman questions about her life and the woman was happy to answer them.\n\nThe Queen was intrigued by the human's stories and asked her to tell her more. The woman smiled and said, \"I would love to tell you more, but I must warn you, I don't believe in vampires.\"\n\nThe Queen smiled and said, \"I am glad you are skeptical. I have been called a monster many times before. But I assure you, I am not a monster. I am a kind and gentle soul, just like you.\"\n\nThe woman smiled and said, \"I know you are a kind and gentle soul. I can see it in your eyes. But I do not believe in vampires.\"\n\nThe Queen smiled and said, \"That is alright. I am glad you are skeptical. I do not believe in many things that humans believe in either. But I believe in love and kindness. I think that is what is most important.\"\n\nThe woman smiled and said, \"I agree. I think love and kindness are the most important things in life.\"\n\nThe Queen smiled and said, \"I am glad we agree on that. I would like to ask you something.\"\n\nThe woman nodded and said, \"Of course. What is it?\"\n\nThe Queen smiled and said, \"Do you love my son?\"\n\nThe woman smiled and said, \"Yes.

I want to see you both happy.\"\n\nThe woman smiled and said, \"Thank you. That means a lot to me.\"\n\nThe Queen smiled and said, \"I want to see my son happy. I want to see you both happy.

        "pred_story": "You can\u2019t blame her for wanting to get back to her home planet, though it would take her thousands of years to make it through hyperspace. She doesn\u2019t want to take the shortcut, though. There\u2019s something about it that feels wrong. So here she is, stuck in the void, all alone, with nothing to keep her company. The stars are too far away to make out any planets, and her ship, though advanced, can\u2019t pick up any signals.\n\nShe sighs. How long has it been? She thinks she\u2019s seen a few stars move, but they\u2019re just a couple of thousand light years away. She\u2019s not sure she could even get back to the galaxy. She sighs again. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s even got a destination to head for. She\u2019s got nothing to do but sit around. Which is basically what she\u2019s been doing.\n\n\u201cDo you have a name?\u201d she asks, and then laughs. \u201cOf course you do.\u201d She sighs again.\n\nShe looks around at the empty space. She\u2019s seen the occasional star fly by, but that\u2019s about it. She\u2019s got a couple of drones patrolling the ship, but they\u2019re no good at finding anything. She\u2019s got no comms with anyone. No one to talk to. She\u2019s alone.\n\nShe sighs one more time. She\u2019s tired of the silence. She wants someone to talk to. She\u2019s not sure why she\u2019s not just talking to herself. It\u2019s not like she wouldn\u2019t want to hear her own voice. But for some reason, she doesn\u2019t want to do that.\n\nShe looks around the empty space again. She hasn\u2019t seen anyone or anything other than the stars, but she hasn\u2019t seen anything else. No planets. No ships. No life. She\u2019s alone. Maybe she\u2019s not alone. She\u2019s not sure why she can\u2019t find anyone. But she\u2019s sure she\u2019s not the only one out here.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d she says.\n\nThere is a pause, and then a voice comes through her speakers.\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d\n\nShe laughs, feeling a little surprised. She hadn\u2019t expected anyone to respond.\n\n\u201cHi!\u201d she says. \u201cMy name is Rachel.\u201d\n\n\u201cRachel.\u201d\n\nShe smiles. It\u2019s nice to have someone to talk to. She\u2019s not sure she likes the silence any more.\n\n\u201cWhat do you call yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d it says. \u201cI don\u2019t have a name. At least, I don\u2019t think I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a sentient void,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you\u2019ve got a name.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I guess that makes sense. I\u2019ve got no physical body. No mind, either, really. I\u2019m just here, existing. I don\u2019t know what you mean by a name, but I know I don\u2019t have one.\u201d\n\nShe smiles again. It\u2019s nice to talk to someone. She\u2019s never really had to talk to a void before.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean a name like \u2018Tom\u2019 or \u2018Sarah,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, like, a name that you\u2019re called. A label.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think I have one of those. Why do you have one?\u201d\n\nShe pauses, wondering what to say. She\u2019s not sure if she\u2019s even supposed to say that she does have a name.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says. \u201cI just do.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d\n\nShe laughs. \u201cI suppose not,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, are you a sentient void, or are you something else?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m something else.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s not sure how to react to that. She doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s good or bad. It\u2019s just a statement. She doesn\u2019t know what she means by good or bad.\n\n\u201cSo, what are you?\u201d she asks.\n\n\u201cI am the Abyys,\u201d it says.\n\nShe laughs. \u201cThe what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Abyys,\u201d it says again. \u201cI am the Abyys.\u201d\n\nShe looks around, realizing that she can see the Abyys. It\u2019s a void, but it\u2019s a void with a face. It\u2019s a face that seems to be staring back at her. She\u2019s not sure how to react. The Abyys isn\u2019t doing anything, but it seems to be looking at her.\n\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s it like?\u201d she asks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like nothing,\u201d it says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like anything. I exist. That\u2019s all. I don\u2019t have thoughts or feelings. I don\u2019t have a body. I\u2019m just here.\u201d\n\nShe nods. \u201cI think I understand,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cDo you?\u201d\n\nShe shrugs. \u201cI think so,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve never really thought about what it would be like to be a void before. I didn\u2019t realize that I would be able to see you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t know if you would be able to see me. But it makes sense that you would be able to. I\u2019m not sure why you can\u2019t see me from inside the ship.\u201d\n\nShe looks around, realizing that she can see the ship. It\u2019s a dot in the distance.\n\n\u201cSo, do you think you could get me out of here?\u201d she asks.\n\n\u201cYou want to leave?\u201d it asks.\n\nShe nods. \u201cYeah. I do. I\u2019m tired of being alone.\u201d\n\nThe Abyys stares back at her. It doesn\u2019t say anything. It just looks at her.\n\n\u201cI can get you out of here,\u201d it says. \u201cBut you\u2019ll have to do something for me.\u201d\n\nShe shrugs. \u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d\n\nThe Abyys stares at her again. It doesn\u2019t say anything. But it does something. It makes her feel a little scared. A little unsure.\n\n\u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d she asks again.\n\nThe Abyys stares at her again. \u201cYou have to say a thing,\u201d it says.\n\nShe looks around, wondering what she\u2019s supposed to say. But she\u2019s not sure what she\u2019s supposed to say. She\u2019s not sure if she\u2019s even supposed to say anything.\n\n\u201cWhat thing?\u201d she asks.\n\n\u201cYou have to say the thing,\u201d it says again. \u201cSay it.\u201d\n\nShe looks around again. She\u2019s not sure what to do. But then she thinks about it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you have to tell me what it is.\u201d\n\nThe Abyys stares at her again. It doesn\u2019t say anything. But it does something. It makes her feel a little scared again.\n\n\u201cSay it,\u201d it says again. \u201cSay the thing.\u201d\n\nShe looks around again. She\u2019s not sure what to do. But then she thinks about it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Abyys stares at her again. It doesn\u2019t say anything. But it does something. It makes her feel a little better. A little less scared.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d it says.\n\nShe looks around again. She\u2019s not sure what to do. But then she thinks about it.\n\n\u201cI forgive you,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Abyys stares at her again. It doesn\u2019t say anything. But it does something. It makes her feel a little better. A little less scared.\n\n\u201cI forgive you,\u201d it says.\n\nShe looks around again. She\u2019s not sure what to do. But then"

I couldn't believe it. \n\nShe was supposed to be a villainess. A mastermind who planned elaborate schemes to conquer and ruin the lives of those around her. I thought I would have to do a lot of unexpected things as her right hand but being asked to attend a wedding was not something I thought I would ever have to do.\n\n\"How could you ask me to do this?\" I asked her from where she sat on her couch. I was standing in her living room, looking at the invitation in my hand.\n\n\"Because I want you to,\" she said as she looked at me with a lazy smile on her face. I had never seen her so relaxed before. I had always seen her with her hair done up in a ponytail, wearing a crisp black suit and looking like a complete boss. But today she was wearing a t-shirt and sweatpants, her hair was in her face and she looked like a completely different person.\n\n\"But why? Why would I need to attend your brother's wedding?\" I asked her as I looked at her in confusion.\n\n\"Because I want you to,\" she said again, this time with a hint of a smile on her face.

Why would I need to attend your brother's wedding?\" I asked again, trying to understand her motives.

How did you get asked to be a maid of honour?\" I asked her, my mind racing with thoughts and questions.\n\n\"Because I'm his sister. I'm his sister and I'm going to be the maid of honour.\" She looked at me with a calm expression, not even understanding why I was so surprised.\n\n\"But why? You're a villainess, why would you be asked to be a maid of honour at your brother's wedding?\" I asked her, trying to wrap my head around the situation.\n\n\"Because my brother is a good person,\" she said, looking at me with a hint of sadness in her eyes.\n\n\"But why? You're not exactly the kind of person that you would want at your sister's wedding as a maid of honour. You're a villainess. You're a mastermind.\"\n\n\"I know I am,\" she said, looking at me with a calm expression. \"But my brother isn't. He's a good person and he wants me to be his maid of honour. I'm not going to disappoint him. And I want you there with me.\"\n\nI looked at her in shock, trying to process what I was seeing. I had never seen her like this before. I had always seen her as this person who was so evil and cruel, but now she was showing me a side of her that I had never seen before.\n\n\"Okay, I'll do it. I'll attend the wedding,\" I said, trying to process what I was seeing. She smiled at me, looking at me with a calm expression.\n\n\"Thank you, that means a lot to me,\" she said, smiling at me."

It was something that others saw as a curse, a bad omen. I could heal anyone who was injured.\n\nAt first, I didn't really understand what I could do. I'd been playing outside when I was a kid, and I'd seen a kid who'd tripped and scraped his knee. I went to help him, and I touched my hand to his knee. It felt a bit warm, like it was alive or something, and before I knew it, the scrape disappeared.\n\nI had no idea what I'd just done, and I tried it out on my friends. Some of them didn't like it, said it made them feel sick, but others did. My friends started to avoid me after a while, and some kids in school started calling me names and making jokes.\n\nI started to wish that I didn't have this ability. I just wanted to be like everyone else, to have something normal. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't make it go away.\n\nAs I got older, my ability got stronger. I could heal anything, from wounds to illnesses. I started to get sick of being laughed at all the time, so I started to use my ability for good. I healed people who needed it, and I got my superhero suit.\n\nI thought that this would change everything. I thought that people would finally see me as a hero, and not as a freak.\n\nThat never happened.\n\nThey started calling me \"Sissy.\" They said that I was using my powers to heal women and children, and that I was getting too close to them. They said that it was a bad thing, and that it was unnatural.\n\nI started to get angry. I was tired of being teased, and tired of being called names. I wanted to prove to the world that I was a real superhero, and not just a freak.\n\nSo, I put on my superhero suit and went out to prove it to the world.\n\nI started by stopping a bank robbery. The robbers were holding the bank hostage, and I was able to heal the hostages so that they were okay. I was able to catch the robbers and put them behind bars.\n\nI started to become a legend, and people started to look up to me as a hero. I started to make a difference in the world, and people started to respect me.\n\nBut no matter how hard I tried, I could never shake the feeling that I was just a freak, that I was something that was unnatural.\n\nI was happy to be making a difference, but it was a hollow victory. I was still seen as a freak, and I was still treated like one.\n\nI'd never be a real superhero. I'd always be something less, something that was below the rest of the community.\n\nI'm still out there, fighting crime and healing people. But I'll never be more than a freak, and I'll always be seen as something less.\n\nIt's hard to be a hero when you're a freak.\n\nI hope that you've enjoyed this little story. It's a bit of a downer, but I thought it was a nice little bit of a change of pace. Thanks for reading, and I hope that you'll come back and visit again. I've got a lot of stories to tell, and I'd love to have you as part of my little community.\n\nIf you have any suggestions or requests, please feel free to share them with me.

It was that moment of darkness just before they switched on that forced me to notice the time. I wasn't too late, but close. I'd have to tell mom that I was running a little behind. She always told me to be home before nightfall. I was usually a bit early, but not that early. I was so close to getting there. So close.\n\nThe walk home took a bit longer than I'd anticipated. It had been a long day of work. I'd been working a lot of extra hours at the office. I couldn't remember the last time I'd had a break. I'd grown accustomed to the feel of my watch and the sound of my phone beeping every hour. That wasn't the same here. The air was different. The ground was different. The people were different.\n\nAs I approached my neighborhood, I noticed my neighbors were moving about. They were doing their daily routines. They didn't seem to notice me. They seemed to be completely unaware of my presence. I wondered if they'd all grown accustomed to my usual schedule and thought I was running late again. I tried to give them a friendly wave, but they didn't seem to notice.\n\nI arrived at my front door, and I opened it up. I'd never noticed how much the door creaked before. It was so quiet. So still. I'd never really heard the quietness of it before. I stepped inside, and I'd never noticed how large the room was. It was massive.\n\nThe room was dimly lit. I assumed that was why I couldn't see my family. I was about to call out for them, but I decided against it. I was worried they might still be asleep. I was about to turn off the lights and head up to my room when I heard footsteps.\n\nThey were light footsteps. They were footsteps from the stairs. They were footsteps coming from the hallway. They were footsteps that were getting closer and closer. They were footsteps that stopped. They were footsteps that stood there.\n\n\"Hello?\" I called out. \"Mom? Dad? Emily? Can anyone hear me?\" I called out. \n\nThere was silence.\n\nI tried to see who it was, but the room was too dark. I didn't dare turn on the lights. I was scared. I tried to see who it was, but they wouldn't come closer. They stood there. They stood there for a long time. They stopped moving. They stopped breathing.\n\nI took a step closer. I took another step closer. I tried to see who it was. I took another step closer. I could feel their heat. I could feel their breath. I could feel their eyes on me.\n\n\"I know you can hear me,\" I said. \"I can hear you. I know it's you.\"\n\nI took another step closer. I could see a faint light from the hallway. I could see shadows. I could see feet. I could see an arm. I could see a hand.\n\nI tried to reach out. I tried to touch them. I tried to say something, but I couldn't. I couldn't form words. I couldn't form thoughts.\n\nI couldn't see them anymore.\n\nThe room was dark. The room was quiet. The room was silent.\n\nI stood there. I stood there for a long time.\n\nI felt the weight of the room on me. I felt the weight of the shadows on me. I felt the weight of the silence on me.\n\nI was scared. I was scared for my family. I was scared for my friends. I was scared for myself.\n\nI tried to think of a way out of there. I tried to think of a way back home. I tried to think of a way back to my family.\n\nBut I couldn't. I couldn't think. I couldn't move. I couldn't feel.\n\nThe room was dark. The room was quiet. The room was silent.\n\nI stood there. I stood there for a long time.\n\nI was lost. I was lost in the darkness. I was lost in the silence. I was lost in the shadows.\n\nI was lost."

I kept silent, and he took that as a sign that it would work. He didn't understand the first time he hit me that it wouldn't kill me. He thought he could knock me out and I would go away. It was a few days before he discovered his knife was just as useless. The first time he stabbed me was a close call. I had to pretend to be dead to convince him that it was working. I didn't tell him to stop, because he would stop, and he would go away, and it would be over. \n\nWe were alone in his backyard. He had gone out to buy supplies. He had already bought the bag, a fake mustache, and some gloves. He said the most terrifying thing: 'You're going to help me escape.' He thought it would be funny to dress up as a woman and sneak into the neighbor's house and steal some valuables. I didn't want to be a part of it. He wanted me to drive him to his destination. He was mad, and he slapped me again. I didn't want to cause more pain, but he was already in a bad mood. He wanted a ride, and he wanted to go now. \n\nHe didn't take the gloves, and I saw him wiping the blood from his lips with a sleeve. It was a small cut, but it was still a cut. I didn't say anything about it. I was afraid of him, and I was more afraid of what he would do if I did. We went to the neighbors', and he broke the lock. I was glad I wasn't a part of it, but I was also a little mad at myself for allowing it to happen. \n\nHe was good at it, though. He took the valuables, and we left. He was laughing. I was not laughing. I was glad when we got back to his place. He took a shower, and I waited. I was worried about the neighbors. I was worried about him. I was worried about what would happen next. \n\nHe came out of the shower, and he went straight to bed. I stayed awake for a while, thinking about what we had done. He didn't know that I could be a part of it. He didn't know that I could be the one to make him escape. I didn't want to do it. I didn't want to hurt anyone else. I didn't want to be a part of it. But, he didn't want to stop. He didn't want to be alone. He didn't want to be a victim. He was angry, and he needed someone to take it out on. He was angry at the world, and he was angry at me. I was a part of the world, so he was angry at me.\n\nWe kept doing it. We kept taking valuables from his neighbors, and we kept getting away. He would dress up as a woman, and I would drive him to the house. He would break the lock, and we would steal what we could. We would go back to his place, and we would celebrate. \n\nIt was hard for me. It was hard for me to be a part of it. It was hard for me to take care of him, but it was harder for me to let him do it. It was hard for me to see what he was doing, and it was hard for me to let him get away with it. \n\nI knew he would do something one day. I knew he would get caught, and I knew it would be bad. He would get caught, and he would go to jail. He would get caught, and he would be angry. He would be angry at me, and he would be angry at the world. I was worried about what would happen to him. I was worried about what would happen to me. I was worried about what would happen to everyone else.\n\nIt did happen. He got caught, and he went to jail. I was mad at him. I was mad that he had done it. I was mad that he had hurt me. I was mad that he had hurt our neighbors. I was mad that he had made me a part of it. I was mad at him. I was mad at myself.

He didn't seem to be impressed by our planet and it's inhabitants.\n\n\"What do you want?\" I asked.  My heart racing with fear.  It was a bad idea to attack his planet with missiles.  He was a lot stronger than I had anticipated.\n\n\"We have come to the human race to help,\" he said.  \"Your species is dying out.  Your planet will be uninhabitable for you in 200 years.  We have technology that can help you survive.\"\n\n\"Why should we trust you?\" I asked.  \"Why do you help us?\"\n\n\"We've watched your species for a long time.

It's always the same vision. A wave of raiders, each one more twisted than the last. Each one with a sword or a spear or a crossbow, all aimed at my master. It's a never-ending battle, and I'm always losing.\n\nI know that's not true. I've won every battle I've ever fought. But in the dream, it feels like the opposite is true. I'm trapped in some never-ending nightmare, fighting raiders that never end.\n\nBut it's not just the raiders. There are the people I have killed. The ones I had to shoot. The ones I had to stab. The ones I had to break. It's always the same faces, the same voices. I've heard them all. I've seen them all. I've killed them all.\n\nAnd yet, I still feel guilty.\n\nIt's a feeling that I've been trying to push down. I've tried to ignore it. I've tried to justify it. But it's still there. It's always there. It's the feeling that I have every time I look at my master. I know that I should be happy that he's alive. I know that I should be grateful that I'm alive. But I'm not.\n\nI'm a monster.\n\nI've killed so many people. I've killed so many innocent people. I've killed so many people that I'll never know. I've killed so many people that I'll never remember.\n\nAnd yet, I'm still here.\n\nI'm still alive.\n\nI'm still fighting.\n\nI'm still living.\n\nAnd yet, I'm still a monster.\n\nI've seen my master. I've watched him sleep. I've watched him dream. I've watched him fight. I've watched him bleed. I've watched him die.\n\nAnd I've seen my own reflection.\n\nI've seen my own face.\n\nI've seen my own body.\n\nAnd I've seen the blood on my hands.\n\nThe raiders came after us. They came after us because of my master. They came after us because of his power. They came after us because of his knowledge. They came after us because they wanted him to join their side. They came after us because they wanted him to die.\n\nBut they didn't come after me.\n\nThey didn't come after my master.\n\nThey came after all of the other bastions.\n\nThey came after all of the other units.\n\nThey came after all of the other people.\n\nThey didn't come after us.\n\nBecause we were the only ones left.\n\nBecause we were the only ones who were still alive.\n\nI know that it's not true. I know that we're not alone. I know that there are other units out there. I know that there are other people out there. But I don't know where they are. I don't know how to find them. I don't know how to help them.\n\nI'm trapped in this cave.\n\nI'm trapped in this bastion.\n\nI'm trapped in this world.\n\nI'm trapped in this life.\n\nI'm trapped in this body.\n\nI'm trapped in this mind.\n\nI'm trapped in this existence.\n\nI'm trapped in this reality.\n\nI'm trapped in this dream.\n\nI'm trapped in this nightmare.\n\nI'm trapped in this life.\n\nI'm trapped in this death.\n\nI'm trapped in this afterlife.\n\nI'm trapped in this world.\n\nI'm trapped in this reality.\n\nI'm trapped in this dream.\n\nI'm trapped in this nightmare.\n\nI'm trapped in this life.\n\nI'm trapped in this death.\n\nI'm trapped in this afterlife.\n\nI'm trapped in this world.\n\nI'm trapped in this reality.\n\nI'm trapped in this dream.\n\nI'm trapped in this nightmare.\n\nI'm trapped in this life.\n\nI'm trapped in this death.\n\nI'm trapped in this afterlife.\n\nI'm trapped in this world.\n\nI'm trapped in this reality.\n\nI'm trapped in this dream.\n\nI'm trapped in this nightmare.\n\nI'm trapped in this life.\n\nI'm trapped in this death.\n\nI'm trapped in this afterlife.\n\nI'm trapped in this world.\n\nI'm trapped in this reality.\n\nI'm trapped in this dream.\n\nI'm trapped in this nightmare.\n\nI'm trapped in this life.\n\nI'm trapped in this death.\n\nI'm trapped in this afterlife.\n\nI'm trapped in this world.\n\nI'm trapped in this reality.\n\nI'm trapped in this dream.\n\nI'm trapped in this nightmare.\n\nI'm trapped in this life.\n\nI'm trapped in this death.\n\nI'm trapped in this afterlife.\n\nI'm trapped in this world.\n\nI'm trapped in this reality.\n\nI'm trapped in this dream.\n\nI'm trapped in this nightmare.\n\nI'm trapped in this life.\n\nI'm trapped in this death.\n\nI'm trapped in this afterlife.\n\nI'm trapped in this world.\n\nI'm trapped in this reality.\n\nI'm trapped in this dream.\n\nI'm trapped in this nightmare.\n\nI'm trapped in this life.\n\nI'm trapped in this death.\n\nI'm trapped in this afterlife.\n\nI'm trapped in this world.\n\nI'm trapped in this reality.\n\nI'm trapped in this dream.\n\nI'm trapped in this nightmare.\n\nI'm trapped in this life.\n\nI'm trapped in this death.\n\nI'm trapped in this afterlife.\n\nI'm trapped in this world.\n\nI'm trapped in this reality.\n\nI'm trapped in this dream.\n\nI'm trapped in this nightmare.\n\nI'm trapped in this life.\n\nI'm trapped in this death.\n\nI'm trapped in this afterlife.\n\nI'm trapped in this world.\n\nI'm trapped in this reality.\n\nI'm trapped in this dream.\n\nI'm trapped in this nightmare.\n\nI'm trapped in this life.\n\nI'm trapped in this death.\n\nI'm trapped in this afterlife.\n\nI'm trapped in this world.\n\nI'm trapped in this reality.\n\nI'm trapped in this dream.\n\nI'm trapped in this nightmare.\n\nI'm trapped in this life.\n\nI'm trapped in this death.\n\nI'm trapped in this afterlife.\n\nI'm trapped in this world.\n\nI'm trapped in this reality.\n\nI'm trapped in this dream.\n\nI'm trapped in this nightmare.\n\nI'm trapped in this life.\n\nI'm trapped in this death.\n\nI'm trapped in this afterlife.\n\nI'm trapped in this world.\n\nI'm trapped in this reality.\n\nI'm trapped in this dream.\n\nI'm trapped in this nightmare.\n\nI'm trapped in this life.\n\nI'm trapped in this death.\n\nI'm trapped in this afterlife.\n\nI'm trapped in this world.\n\nI'm trapped in this reality.\n\nI'm trapped in this dream.\n\nI'm trapped in this nightmare.\n\nI'm trapped in this life.\n\nI'm trapped in this death.\n\nI'm trapped"

        "pred_story": "I opened the back door to take out my garbage. The darkness outside was as black as a blanket. I couldn\u2019t see but one footstep ahead of the other. The house was dark, so I didn\u2019t feel the need to light a flashlight. The smell of a fresh cut lawn wafted through the yard. I had just cut my grass two days ago. Maybe my neighbors had their lawns cut. My garbage can had just enough trash in it to be noticeable. I didn\u2019t want any raccoons or squirrels making a mess of it. I had to get a closer look. That\u2019s when I heard my back door open and close. I turned around and saw two people dressed in dark clothes. One had a black mask and the other had a red bandana tied around their face. They were dressed to be seen on a night like this. No matter what, it was clear their intentions were not innocent. I slowly turned around and headed towards the house. \n\n\u201cGood evening,\u201d I said. \u201cWelcome to my home.\u201d \n\nIt was a moment of clarity. Both of them were taken aback by my words. Neither one said a word. One of them slowly looked at the other, and they both nodded. \u201cYeah,\u201d they nodded in unison. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure if anyone was home.\u201d \n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I replied. \u201cWould you like to come in?\u201d \n\nOne of them nodded, and they both came through the back door. \n\n\u201cPlease, have a seat,\u201d I said, gesturing for them to sit down in the living room. \n\nThey sat down on the couch, side by side. \n\n\u201cSo,\u201d I said, \u201cWould you like some water, juice, or soda?\u201d \n\nNeither one moved, and I turned to the kitchen. I pulled out the water and brought it back. \n\nI handed them each a bottle. \u201cNow,\u201d I said, \u201cwhat would you like to do?\u201d \n\nThey both looked at each other. \n\n\u201cScrew it,\u201d one of them said. \u201cWe\u2019ve come too far.\u201d \n\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d their partner said. \u201cLet\u2019s get it over with.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhich one of you is going to do it?\u201d I asked. \n\nOne of them looked around the room, and the other one sat up a little bit. \n\n\u201cWhich one of you can do it?\u201d I asked again. \n\nThere was another pause. The second one to speak up looked over at the first one, and the first one looked back. \n\n\u201cLook, you know,\u201d I said, \u201cyou are in my home. You can\u2019t take anything if you don\u2019t let me know you are doing something.\u201d \n\nThe first person to speak up looked at their partner, and the other one nodded. \n\n\u201cFine,\u201d I said, \u201cLet me know when you are done.\u201d \n\nThey nodded in unison, and one of them stood up. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go through the rooms and make sure everything is secure,\u201d they said. \u201cYou can go through the cupboards and drawers.\u201d \n\nThey nodded, and the other one went to the kitchen. I looked around the room and saw that it was spotless. I went through the cupboards and drawers. There was nothing worth taking. I grabbed a glass and filled it with water. I walked to the living room and handed them each a glass. \n\nThey both nodded, and they both sat down on the couch. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with,\u201d one of them said. \n\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d the other one said. \n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, \u201cSo I understand that you guys are going through my home.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d one of them said. \n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, \u201cI will go through the house and make sure everything is secure.\u201d \n\n\u201cGo through the house,\u201d they said. \u201cIf everything is secure, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d \n\n\u201cSo we will both be doing the same thing,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything illegal.\u201d \n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d one of them said. \u201cI think we understand.\u201d \n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cI am going to go through the house.\u201d \n\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d one of them said. \n\nI walked through the house and checked every room. I made sure everything was secure. I locked the doors and windows. When I finished, I went back to the living room. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d I said. \u201cIs that fine with you guys?\u201d \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d one of them said. \n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you want me to walk you out?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d one of them said. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d I said. \n\nI turned around and walked out of the house. \n\nWhen I got to the back door, I turned around. \n\n\u201cHey,\u201d one of them said, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d \n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, \u201cI want to make sure you guys have a safe night.\u201d \n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d one of them said. \n\nThey both nodded and walked out. \n\nThe back door closed, and I could hear footsteps. I looked out the window and saw them both walking away. \n\nI looked inside the house and saw that they had left. \n\nI went to the kitchen and grabbed another glass of water. I looked at the bottles they had left behind. \n\nI took a sip of the water and went to my bedroom. I looked at my clock and saw it was 1 am. \n\nI would have to wait until morning to go to the police station and report the incident. \n\nI went to bed and tried to get some sleep."

Your mother-in-law sat at a table nearby, with her daughter sitting next to her.  You sat down next to your mother-in-law, and she smiled as she hugged you, and then gave you a kiss on the cheek.  Her daughter, who you had only met a few times, looked on with a look of disinterest, but also a slight sadness to her eyes.  You turned to her, and she looked at you.  You could tell that she was her mother's child, but also her father's.  She looked like your wife, but also like her father, your wife's brother.  Her father was a bit of a piece of work, and you could tell that she had inherited some of his traits.  She had a fiery spirit, but also a sense of entitlement that you found off-putting.  Your wife's father was a good man, but he was also a bit of a hothead, and you could tell that his daughter had inherited that trait from him.  \n\n\"So, what is it that you want to talk about?\" you asked, taking a sip of your drink.  \n\n\"I want to talk about my sister,\" she replied, looking at your wife who was looking at her with a mix of sadness and anger.  \n\n\"Let's talk about this another time,\" your wife interrupted, but her sister wasn't having it.  \n\n\"No, we can talk about it now,\" her sister replied, her voice rising.  \n\nYour wife sighed, and then sat up.

She had been a victim of abuse, and you could tell that she had been damaged.  \n\n\"We want to help,\" your wife said, her voice shaking.  \n\n\"You are,\" her sister replied, looking at you with a mix of sadness and anger.  \n\nYou didn't know what to say.

        "pred_story": "I'm a knight of old. The year is 1303 and the kingdom of old is in great danger from the forces of darkness. The kingdom has been under attack for years and all of the knights have fallen. I'm the last one. I'm the last one to stand.\n\nI'm not very good at this stuff. I've been fighting the forces of darkness for all my life, and every battle I've lost. I'm the worst knight in the land. I've lost my arm, my sword, and my horse. All that's left is my suit of armor and my pride.\n\nI'm in a dark forest, surrounded by the dark forces. I've been fighting them for hours, but I'm all out of strength. I'm all out of sword. I'm all out of everything.\n\nI see a shape in front of me. I can't tell what it is. I'm not sure if I should be scared or what. I approach the shape slowly, trying not to make a sound.\n\nAs I get closer, I see that it's a dragon. A dragon! I've never seen one before. I'm not sure if I should be scared or what.\n\nThe dragon looks at me and says, \"Ho there, knight! I've been expecting you.\"\n\nI'm shocked. I didn't expect the dragon to talk. I'm not sure what to say.\n\nThe dragon says, \"You've come to save the princess, I presume?\"\n\nI nod, trying to understand what's going on.\n\nThe dragon says, \"I've written a letter to you, asking for your help. I need your help to save me from the princess.\"\n\nI'm confused. I don't understand what the dragon is saying.\n\nThe dragon says, \"You don't understand? The princess is a wicked and cruel woman. She'll kill me if I don't escape from her castle. I need your help to escape.\"\n\nI'm still confused, but I understand that the dragon is in danger.\n\nThe dragon says, \"You have to save me. If you don't, the princess will kill me and I'll never see the light of day again.\"\n\nI'm still confused, but I understand that I have to save the dragon.\n\nI ask, \"Why do you need my help?\"\n\nThe dragon says, \"I've been imprisoned in her castle for years. I've been trying to escape, but I couldn't. I've been searching for a way out, but there's none. I need your help to escape.\"\n\nI'm still confused, but I understand that I have to help the dragon.\n\nI ask, \"How do I get into the castle?\"\n\nThe dragon says, \"You have to get into the castle through the front gate. It's guarded by knights and dragons. But I'll show you a secret path that'll get you into the castle without being seen.\"\n\nI'm still confused, but I understand that I have to get into the castle.\n\nThe dragon says, \"But you have to hurry. If you don't, the princess will kill me. And if she kills me, she'll never leave me alone again.\"\n\nI'm still confused, but I understand that I have to hurry.\n\nI ask, \"What's the secret path?\"\n\nThe dragon says, \"It's through the sewer. You have to go down the sewer and then climb up the pipes. It's a bit dirty, but it'll get you into the castle without being seen.\"\n\nI'm still confused, but I understand that I have to go down the sewer.\n\nI ask, \"How do I climb up the pipes?\"\n\nThe dragon says, \"You have to climb up the pipes without falling. If you fall, you'll die. And if you die, you'll never leave me alone again.\"\n\nI'm still confused, but I understand that I have to climb up the pipes.\n\nI ask, \"How do I find the pipes?\"\n\nThe dragon says, \"You have to find the castle's sewer. It's a bit hidden, but you'll find it. Then, you have to climb up the pipes. It's a bit tricky, but you'll get there.\"\n\nI'm still confused, but I understand that I have to climb up the pipes.\n\nI ask, \"How long will it take me to climb up the pipes?\"\n\nThe dragon says, \"It'll take you a bit of time. But you have to hurry. If you don't, the princess will kill me.

She'll kill me if she doesn't get what she wants.\"\n\nI'm still confused, but I understand that I have to kill the princess.\n\nI ask, \"What do I need to do to kill the princess?\"\n\nThe dragon says, \"You need to kill her with your sword.

        "pred_story": "We had been preparing for this moment for years and the moment had finally arrived.  The demon lord was powerful and if he was allowed to take control of our world it would be a disaster.  The church had sent us on a mission to summon a powerful deity to stop the demon lord and his army of minions.  I knew that it would not be easy.  The ritual was long and complicated, but I was determined to get it done.\n\nThe ritual had started a few days ago.  We were required to burn incense and light candles.  The scent of the incense and the flame of the candles were required to bring forth the power of the deity.  It was hard to get it right, but we were all experienced in the ways of the church.  The flame was to be a certain size and color, and the incense had to be the exact scent to bring forth the deity's power.  It was also required that we be in the correct mood and mindset.  We had to have faith and trust in the deity and in the ritual.\n\nI was the only one that was in charge of the ritual, but I had a few helpers to assist me.  They would light the candles and burn the incense.  They would also perform the actions required to bring forth the deity's power.  We all had to perform these actions at the same time.  It had to be in sync or it would not work.  We had practiced it many times and it worked perfectly.\n\nWe were in a large cave deep beneath the earth.  The cave was not deep, but it was large and could hold many people.  It was also very dark, but it was not a problem.  We had brought many torches and candles to light the way.  It was also very quiet, but it was not a problem.  We were all focused on the ritual and the task at hand.\n\nThe ritual had been going for a few days and we were getting close to the final part.  I knew that we had to be quick and precise if we were to succeed.  I looked at the calendar and saw that we had about a day and a half left.  I knew that we had to finish the ritual as soon as possible.  The demon lord and his army were closing in on us.  I could feel their presence and smell their stench.  We had to be careful.  We could not let them catch us before we could summon the deity.\n\nThe next day was very hard.  The demon lord and his army were closing in on us fast.  We could hear the sound of their footsteps and the rustling of their clothes.  I knew that we had to hurry.  The ritual had to be done quickly and precisely.  The helper's were moving fast and doing their jobs perfectly.  I was a little nervous, but I knew that we would succeed.  I had faith and trust in the deity and in the ritual.\n\nThe day was almost over, but we still had a lot of work to do.  I knew that we had to finish the ritual as soon as possible.  The demon lord and his army were almost on us.  I could see them in the distance.  I knew that we had to hurry.  I looked at the calendar and saw that we had about a few hours left.  I knew that we had to finish the ritual as soon as possible.  I could see the helper's moving quickly and precisely.  I could see the deity's power building up.  I knew that we were almost there.\n\nThe final part of the ritual was the hardest.  It required a lot of power and concentration.  I knew that we had to focus and do it perfectly.  I could feel the deity's power building up.  I could see the helper's moving quickly and precisely.  I knew that we were almost there.  The ritual was almost complete.  I looked at the calendar and saw that we had about a few minutes left.  I knew that we had to hurry.  I could see the demon lord and his army in the distance.  I knew that we had to finish the ritual as soon as possible.  I was a little nervous, but I knew that we would succeed.  I had faith and trust in the deity and in the ritual.\n\nWe finished the ritual and waited.  We knew that we had to wait for a few minutes before the deity would appear.  I could feel the power of the deity building up.  I could feel the air around us change.  I knew that the deity was coming.  I could see it's light in the distance.  I knew that we were almost there.\n\nThe deity appeared.  It was a beautiful sight to behold.  The light was bright and it was all around us.  I could feel its power and I could see its glory.  I knew that we had succeeded.  The ritual had worked and the deity had been summoned.  I knew that we would be safe.  I knew that the demon lord and his army would not be able to harm us.  I knew that the deity would protect us.  I was a little nervous, but I knew that we would succeed.\n\nThe deity was powerful and beautiful.  It was like a giant that was made out of light.  I could see its face and it was like a giant's face.  It was big and it was powerful.  I could see its eyes and they were bright.  I could feel its presence and it was powerful.  I knew that we had succeeded.  The ritual had worked and the deity had been summoned.  I knew that we would be safe.  I knew that the demon lord and his army would not be able to harm us.  I knew that the deity would protect us."

        "pred_story": "\"I'm not sure I'd call myself happy,\" I said. \"Though, I am somewhat eager for this fight. I suppose I can understand why you might find boredom interesting to you, and why you'd consider this a form of entertainment.\"\n\n\"Entertainment?\" He chuckled. \"You have no idea what I mean. Do you think you know what it is to be this old? To have seen empires rise and fall, civilizations come and go, to have watched the universe grow and change?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"I suppose not, in which case, I don't think I should try to speak to your experiences.\"\n\n\"Not to that,\" he said, \"but to what I've seen, and what I've felt. I was here when the world began. I remember when it was nothing but a ball of hot, molten rock. And through all of it, I've fought. I've fought and killed, again and again. I've been bored, for a very long time.\"\n\nI was trying to think of what to say next, but he interrupted me. \"And then, one day, I found something. I found that when I was in the middle of a fight, when I was swinging my sword, or throwing my spear, when I was dodging blows or running away from them, I was happy. I was more than happy; I was alive. For the first time in thousands of years, I was alive.\"\n\nI looked down at him. \"You're not exactly old,\" I said. \"You're not even old. You're probably somewhere in your mid-twenties.\"\n\nHe chuckled again. \"I know what I am,\" he said. \"And I'm sure I'm not like any other human you've ever met. What I mean is, I'm not like most humans. I'm not like people you've met in your life.\"\n\nI sighed. \"I'm starting to understand. You're not a human at all, are you?\"\n\nHe looked at me, but didn't answer. I sighed again, and sat down on the ground beside him. \"So, are you a god or something?\" I said. \"I mean, I've heard of gods before. People who live for thousands of years, or even longer. But I've never met anyone who was like that before.\"\n\nHe looked at me, again. He looked at me with a smile. \"A god?\" He said. \"I wish I was a god. If I were a god, I wouldn't be a warrior, I'd be a king. I'd be a god king.\"\n\nI looked down at my feet. \"I don't really get what you're saying,\" I said.\n\n\"I'll explain,\" he said. \"If you can understand what I'm saying, you'll understand why I'm happy. Do you think I'm a warrior because I enjoy killing?\"\n\nI thought about this for a moment, and then nodded. \"Yeah, I think that's true. You don't seem like the kind of guy who likes to kill. You seem like you're doing this because you're bored.\"\n\nHe nodded again. \"I am bored. But I'm not bored because I'm killing people. I'm bored because I've done it all before. I've killed people over and over and over again, in the same way, in the same places. I've done it to myself, before. I've killed myself, so that I wouldn't have to do it again. So that I could start over, or just be in a different place.\"\n\nI couldn't really think of what to say. I had never heard anything like that before. \"So, why are you here?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'm here to end my boredom,\" he said. \"I'm here to kill you, so that I can start over. If I can kill you, I'll be able to move on. And if I can move on, I'll be able to find something new to be bored with.\"\n\nI sighed again. \"I don't know how to talk to you,\" I said. \"You're not even making sense.\"\n\nHe smiled again. \"You don't understand, do you?\" He said. \"I'm not making sense, because you're not making sense. You're too stupid, or too young, or too something to understand what I'm saying.\"\n\nI looked up at him. \"I'm not stupid,\" I said. \"And I'm not young, either. I'm a very capable person. I've been doing lots of things for a long time, and I've done them really well.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"You think you're capable?\" He said. \"You think you're special?\"\n\nI sighed again. \"I don't think that I'm special. I think I'm just like everyone else.\"\n\nHe chuckled. \"You're not like everyone else,\" he said. \"You're not even close. You're stupid and young, and you don't understand what you're saying.\"\n\nI looked up at him, and then looked down. \"I don't know why I'm here,\" I said. \"I don't know why I'm fighting you.\"\n\nHe chuckled again. \"I'll tell you why,\" he said. \"You're fighting me because you're stupid and young. You're fighting me because you don't know any better. And when you die, I'll be able to move on.\"\n\nI looked up at him, and then looked down again. I sighed. \"I don't know if I want to die,\" I said.\n\nHe laughed. \"You don't?\" He said. \"That's good. That's good, because it will make your death all the more exciting. If you're afraid of dying, then you'll be able to fear me, and fear the fight. And that will make everything more exciting.\"\n\nI sighed again. \"I don't think that's true,\" I said. \"I don't think that death is exciting at all.\"\n\nHe laughed again. \"You don't know what you're saying,\" he said. \"You're not even close.\"\n\nI stood up. \"I'm going to go,\" I said. \"I'm going to go and fight you, and then I'm going to die.\"\n\nHe smiled. \"I'm glad you're going to do that,\" he said. \"I'm glad you're willing to fight me. And when you die, I'll be able to move on.\"\n\nI walked away from him. I didn't look back at him. I just kept walking until I was away from him, until I was away from the fight.\n\nAs I walked away, I felt a sense of sadness. I felt a sense of sadness because I knew that I would never be able to understand him. I would never be able to speak to him, or to make sense of his words. I would never be able to fight him, or to defeat him. I would never be able to move on.\n\nAnd as I walked, I felt a sense of fear. I felt a sense of fear because I knew that I was going to die. I knew that I was going to die because he was a god, or something like that. And I knew that I was going to die because I was stupid and young, and I didn't know any better.\n\nBut"

You can\u2019t wait to read the story, can you? I know I was anxious to read it, and I never knew how it was going to end. Now, without any more to say, I\u2019m going to tell you the story.\n\nAs the sun rose and the day got warm, a man woke up. He was a man that didn\u2019t want anyone to ever meet, so he locked up all the windows and doors of his house. He didn\u2019t want anyone to ever look inside his house, so he built a wall around his property. He did this to keep the world from ever bothering him. He was a man that wanted to live his life in peace. \n\nEvery day, he would wake up, and the first thing he would do is go to the local grocery store and buy a bunch of food and some other stuff he needed. No one would know his face, so he would wear a mask to cover his face, and he would wear a hat to cover his hair. \n\nHe would come home and take off his mask and hat, but he would still lock the doors and windows, and he would make sure no one was watching. He was a man that was paranoid of his surroundings. He wanted to make sure no one was ever in his house, especially not women. He was a man that didn\u2019t like women, and he wanted to stay away from them. \n\nHe would come home, and he would take off his mask and hat, and he would look in the mirror. He would see a man that was ugly, but he was a man that liked to look at himself. He was a man that liked to admire himself. \n\nHe would eat his food and he would read some books. He would read books that were about nothing. He was a man that wanted to stay away from the world, and he was doing a great job. He was a man that was smart, and he knew how to stay away from the world. \n\nHe didn\u2019t want to get close to anyone, so he would only read books about nothing. He didn\u2019t want to read any books that were about people, because people would think he cared about people. He was a man that didn\u2019t want to care about people. \n\nOne day, he saw a woman, and he didn\u2019t like it. He saw her walking down the street, and he saw her smile at him. He didn\u2019t like it, so he closed the curtains. He didn\u2019t want to look at her again. He didn\u2019t want to see her smile at him again. \n\nHe didn\u2019t want to see the world, so he closed all of the curtains in his house. He closed all of the windows and doors, and he waited for her to go away. He waited for the world to go away. \n\nHe was a man that didn\u2019t want to get close to anyone.

        "pred_story": "This morning, I'm in a bad mood. I woke up with a hangover and my girlfriend has just left me.  I've always been a bit of a narcissist. I'm not sure where I'd be without her to make my life more interesting.\n\nI'm driving to my parents' house to see if they know anything about my mother's whereabouts. If they know about her leaving and they haven't said anything, that means she must have taken me to the hospital without telling them.\n\nI can see the hospital and I'm approaching the entrance. I'm still in pain and it's getting worse by the minute.  I stop the car and get out, walking towards the hospital entrance.  I see a couple of orderlies and a couple of doctors on the way and I'm hoping they can help me.\n\nI get to the front desk and I'm greeted by a nice nurse. She is dressed in blue scrubs and is wearing a smile.  She has dark brown hair that is tied back in a ponytail.  I'm a sucker for this kind of stuff, so I get a little nervous.\n\nI tell her that I'm here to see a doctor. She asks me my name and I tell her it's Jack.  She asks me my insurance information and I tell her that I'm not sure if I have insurance.\n\nI'm going through this process and I'm feeling a little anxious.  The nurse gives me a form to fill out.  I fill it out as best as I can and I give it to her.  She takes my information and then goes to the back.\n\nA minute or two later, she comes back with a young doctor.  He is dressed in scrubs and has a stethoscope around his neck.  He introduces himself as Doctor Smith and says that he will be treating me.  I tell him my symptoms and he examines me.  He tells me that I have a serious kidney infection and that I'm going to need to go to the hospital.\n\nI'm shocked.  I'm thinking, \"How did I get a kidney infection?\"  He tells me that it's from my hangover.  He explains that my body was poisoned by the alcohol and that my kidneys were trying to filter it out.  I'm thinking, \"Oh, great.  I'm going to die from a hangover.\"\n\nThe doctor tells me that I need to be in the hospital for a few days to get treatment.  I ask him if my mother is here and he tells me that she came in this morning.  I'm thinking, \"How did she know about my hangover?  Does she have a little spy at the bar?\"\n\nI ask him to take me to her and he tells me that he can do that.  He takes me to a room that I hadn't seen before.  She is lying on a bed and she is looking very weak.\n\nI'm thinking, \"What is going on here?  What did she do to me?\"  The doctor tells me that she brought you in and that you are critically ill.\n\nI'm thinking, \"What?  How can I be critically ill?  I was just out having a good time.\"  He tells me that it's from your hangover.  I'm thinking, \"Oh, great.  I'm going to die from your hangover.\"\n\nI ask him to take me to you and he tells me that he can do that.  He takes me to your room and I see that you are lying on a bed.  You are covered in blankets and you are breathing slowly.  I'm thinking, \"Is this real?  Is this really happening?\"\n\nI ask the doctor if you are going to be okay and he tells me that you will be fine.  He explains that you are suffering from a brain tumor and that it was pressing on your brain.  He tells me that you will be okay if we can get the tumor out.\n\nI'm thinking, \"What?  How did I not know about this?  Why didn't you tell me?\"  I'm thinking, \"What is going on here?  Why didn't you tell me about the tumor?\"\n\nThe doctor tells me that you didn't want anyone to know about it.  He tells me that you were too ashamed to tell anyone about it.  I'm thinking, \"Why didn't you tell me?  Why did you leave me?\"\n\nI'm feeling a little guilty now.  I'm thinking, \"What did I do to deserve this?\"  I'm thinking, \"Why did you leave me?

        "pred_story": "The doorbell rang. My parents, Father Michael and Mother Evelyn, were in the living room, reading something on their tablets. I was in the kitchen, staring blankly into the refrigerator, eating a cookie. I hated cookies, but I ate them anyway. They were boring, but they were better than not eating.\n\nI turned off the stove, wiped my hands with a sponge, and left the kitchen. I passed by the living room, and I saw that Father Michael was holding up a small, leather-bound book and looking at it. He looked up, and our eyes met for a brief second before I broke the stare down.\n\n\"Someone's at the door!\" Father Michael called out.\n\nI let him have the privilege of answering the door. I was going to eat another cookie. I heard the door open, and I heard Father Michael's voice. \"Thank you for coming over. I know it's short notice, but we think we have a bit of an emergency on our hands.\"\n\nIt took a little bit for me to finish my cookie before I even heard the voice again. It sounded like the voice of a man, but I wasn't sure what his age was. He sounded old. He sounded young. I heard a brief conversation between Father Michael and the man, and then I heard the man's voice again.\n\n\"May I have a look at the...child?\" He called out. I heard Father Michael's voice and Mother Evelyn's voice. I heard the sound of footsteps, and then I saw the man in the doorway of the kitchen. He was wearing a suit, and he looked like a middle-aged man. He looked old. He looked young.\n\nHe looked like my father.\n\nHe looked like my brother.\n\n\"Hello,\" he said. \"I am Brother Xavier. I am here to help your child with a bit of an issue he's having.\" He looked at me. I stared back.\n\nI stared back because I was a demon. I was a demon and I knew it. My parents believed that I was possessed. They were right. I was possessed by an angel. I was an angel. My name was Amon. I knew it. I was sure of it.\n\n\"Okay, Brother Xavier.\" Father Michael said. \"What do you need us to do?\"\n\n\"It's quite simple, really,\" Brother Xavier said. \"I just need to perform an exorcism.\"\n\nI heard the sound of my heart beating in my chest. I knew that it wasn't mine. I knew that it wasn't a human's. I knew that it was an angel's.\n\n\"I'll help you with that,\" Father Michael said.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Brother Xavier said. \"I'll need to get something out of my bag.\" He reached into his bag, but I saw that he was holding a small vial of water and a small piece of cloth. He poured the water onto the cloth, and he handed me the cloth.\n\nI was confused. I was confused because I was an angel. I was confused because I had been playing along. I was confused because I had been playing along so well that I was starting to believe that I was human.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said.\n\n\"Put it on,\" Brother Xavier said.\n\nI took the cloth and I put it on my face. I felt a sudden chill run down my spine, and I heard my heart beating again. This time, it sounded like a human's heart. This time, it sounded like my father's heart.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said.\n\n\"Anytime,\" Brother Xavier said. \"Now, let's get started on the exorcism.\"\n\nI felt a sudden surge of power run through my body. I felt a sudden surge of strength in my arms. I felt a sudden surge of anger in my heart.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Brother Xavier said.\n\nI lunged at him with my knife. I felt his body sag against the wall, and I saw the look of surprise on his face.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Brother Xavier said.\n\nI felt my body burn. I felt my body rise up in the air. I saw the look of surprise on my parents' faces.\n\nI felt my body combust. I felt my body turn to ash. I felt my body burn away.\n\nI was nothing.\n\nI was no one.\n\nI was Amon, the angel. I was Amon, the demon.\n\nI was nothing.\n\nI was no one.\n\nI was Amon, the angel. I was Amon, the demon.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Brother Xavier said. \"Thank you.\""

He stopped taking care of himself, stopped paying attention to the world, and stopped speaking. His only expression was a constant, sorrowful frown.\n\nBut I was there today, and he was too. He was finally able to speak, and he was ready to make up for lost time. \"What?\" he asked, looking at me expectantly. \"What? What?

As I was walking in the door, my grandfather was on the phone. He was talking to someone about a deal that sounded like it was going to get us rich. I felt a little skeptical, but I didn't want to ruin his excitement.\n\nAs soon as I hung up the phone, he turned to me and smiled. \"I did it,\" he said. \"I finally did it.\"\n\n\"I'm proud of you, Grandfather,\" I said. \"I know you'll make it happen.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Alex,\" he said, putting a hand on my shoulder. \"Thank you for being here. Thank you for being my family.\"\n\n\"I'm your family,\" I said. \"And I love you, Grandfather.\"\n\n\"I love you too, Alex.\" I gave him a hug. \"Thank you, I needed that.\"\n\n\"Anytime,\" I said. \"So, when do we leave for our vacation?\"\n\n\"Uh, well... I think I've got to stay in the office for a little while longer.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" I said. \"I'll wait for you.\"\n\nHe gave me a kiss on the cheek. \"I know you will, Alex. And that's why I'm going to be there for the rest of my life.\"\n\nI didn't know what that meant, but I knew that I was going to be happy for as long as he was there. And I knew that he would always be there, no matter how old he got or how much he complained."

        "pred_story": "I'll never forget the night before the big battle. We'd spent months preparing, months of grueling training and sacrifice. But as our hero, the legendary General Storm, lay in his bed, none of us knew what would tomorrow bring. We had been warned of a great and powerful enemy, a dragon as fierce as any of the great beasts of legend. We knew he would be difficult to defeat.\n\nAs we sat around the campfire, passing a bottle of the finest wine, the mood was somber. We had seen General Storm in all his glory, his great sword shining in the light of the setting sun. We knew we were going into battle as his loyal companions. I am not sure I was a worthy companion. I am a bit of a fool, a bit of a prankster. I am also a bit of a coward. I was born to a family of warriors, my father and brothers were all brave warriors. I was not. I have always felt like I do not belong in this world of warriors and dragons. I am sure they all think I am a bit of a joke.\n\n\"I don't know if he's ready for this, you know,\" said our leader, Captain Nightingale. \"We've been training for months, but this is a dragon we are talking about. He's almost as old as the mountain itself. It's almost like he has his own mind.\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" said a young warrior named Elyan. \"But General Storm is not a fool. He's one of the greatest warriors in all the land.\"\n\n\"You're right, Elyan,\" said a wise old warrior named Gryffin. \"But I still think he may not be ready for this battle. We need to make sure he has the best chance of victory.\"\n\n\"We can't just abandon him,\" said a young warrior named Alaric. \"We're his only hope.\"\n\n\"We're not sure he needs our help,\" said Captain Nightingale. \"He's been preparing for this battle for months. He knows what he's up against.\"\n\n\"He can't possibly understand what he's up against,\" said Gryffin. \"The power of a dragon is something that cannot be fully explained. It's something that cannot be defeated with a sword and a shield.\"\n\nWe all fell silent, the only sound being the crackling of the fire. We knew the Captain was right. We couldn't possibly understand the power of the dragon. We could only hope that General Storm was ready to face it.\n\n\"General Storm will be fine,\" said Alaric. \"He's a great warrior. He'll take care of us.\"\n\nI didn't know what to say. I knew I wasn't as brave as Elyan, but I was definitely not as brave as Alaric. I wasn't sure if I could take care of myself in battle, let alone care of my fellow warriors.\n\n\"Even if the General is not ready for the battle,\" said Captain Nightingale, \"we cannot abandon him. We have to stick together as a team, to stand by one another as brothers.\"\n\nAs we all nodded in agreement, the fire crackled and spat, sending sparks flying into the air. We all knew that tomorrow would be a day of great victory, or a day of great defeat. We all knew that we would be put to the test."

It felt like a warm, comforting energy that surrounded me. I felt at peace.\n\n\"Yes, this magic feels nice, but what about my mother? Will she be okay?\" I asked, looking up at the Fey. She smiled down at me.\n\n\"Yes, she's been restored to perfect health and will live out the rest of her life without any more troubles.\" I nodded, feeling happy that my mother would be okay. I had always tried to protect her, and it was nice to finally know that she would be safe.\n\n\"I don't understand why you want to take my firstborn,\" I said, thinking about the implications of the Fey's request. I had never really thought about being a father until now. I had never really thought about being a parent at all, but now that the Fey was asking for my child, I was starting to feel a little scared.\n\n\"I want your firstborn as a gift,\" the Fey said, her voice sounding softer now. \"I've watched you and your mother for many years. You've grown up, and you've taken care of your mother with all of your heart. It's a wonderful thing that you've done, and I want to show my appreciation by having your child.\"\n\nI thought about that for a moment. If it was up to me, I wouldn't want the Fey to have my child. It sounded a little scary, not knowing who my child would grow up to be or what kind of parent I would be. But the Fey's words made me think about the gift that I had been given. I had been able to take care of my mother, and I had been able to bring her back from death.\n\n\"I'll give you my child,\" I said, feeling a little scared but also feeling that it was the right thing to do. \"I'll give you my child, but I want something in return. Can I ask for something of you in return?\" The Fey nodded, smiling down at me.\n\n\"Of course, I'll give you anything you want in return,\" the Fey said. I thought for a moment about what I wanted. I had been given the gift of life and had been given the chance to care for my mother. Now I wanted something that would help me in my own life.\n\n\"I want you to teach me how to control the magic,\" I said, looking up at the Fey. She nodded, smiling down at me.\n\n\"I will teach you everything you want to know,\" the Fey said, her eyes shining with excitement. \"But first, let's go back to your house and celebrate with your mother.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a little nervous but also feeling happy about the opportunity that I had been given. I had never felt so happy and content in my life, and I knew that this was something that I would always treasure.\n\nI stood up and followed the Fey back to my house. My mother was waiting for me in the living room, looking a little happy but also looking a little scared. I smiled down at her and hugged her tightly.\n\n\"I'm okay, mom,\" I said, holding her close. \"I'm going to be a father, and I'm going to be able to control magic.\"\n\nMy mother smiled down at me, looking relieved. \"That's wonderful, dear,\" she said, hugging me back. \"I'll be happy to have a grandchild, and I'll be happy to see you learn how to control magic.\"\n\nI nodded, smiling down at her. I knew that she would be happy to see me learn how to control magic, and I knew that she would be happy to see me be a father. I hugged her tightly and thanked her for being so supportive.\n\nThe Fey stepped forward and hugged me. \"I'll teach you everything you want to know,\" she said, smiling down at me. \"We'll start tomorrow, okay?\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a little nervous but also feeling happy about the opportunity that I had been given. I knew that I would always treasure this moment, and I knew that I would always be grateful for the Fey's kindness and generosity.\n\nI hugged the Fey back and thanked her again. She smiled down at me and stepped back, disappearing into thin air. I looked around at my house, feeling a little confused but also feeling happy. I had just been given a chance to learn how to control magic and to become a father, and I knew that I would always be grateful for that.\n\nI looked over at my mother and smiled down at her. She smiled back at me, looking happy and relieved. I hugged her again and thanked her again for being so supportive.\n\nI stepped back and looked around at my house, feeling a little nervous but also feeling happy. I had been given a chance to learn how to control magic and to become a father, and I knew that I would always be grateful for that.\n\nI walked out of my house and looked up at the sky, feeling a little confused but also feeling happy. I had just been given a chance to learn how to control magic and to become a father, and I knew that I would always be grateful for that.\n\nI smiled down at the ground and thanked the Fey again for her kindness and generosity. I knew that I would always treasure this moment, and I knew that I would always be grateful for the opportunity that I had been given."

He was a genius of sorts, able to figure out how to build and power a spacecraft.  He was able to gather a crew of others that were also born without the ability to use magic, and together they were able to build a spacecraft that would be able to travel into space.\n\nAs they reached the stars, Aven and his crew saw many different things.

They saw that the universe was full of mysteries, and that the magic that they were born with was nothing compared to the magic of the universe.\n\nAnd as they journeyed further and further into space, they began to realize that the universe was not just a place, but a state of mind.  They began to understand that the magic that they were born with was not just a gift, but a curse.  They began to understand that the ability to use magic was not just a power, but a limitation.\n\nAnd as they continued to travel, they began to realize that there was no such thing as a \"magical\" universe.

The air was crisp, the birds were singing, and the only sound was the rustle of leaves beneath my feet. The only thing that could have made the walk more perfect was the presence of a friend. \n\nHowever, it was a solo walk for me today. So, I took a deep breath and began my journey. The walk was a familiar one for me. I took this route almost every morning. So, it's not hard for me to lose myself in my thoughts. I thought about the latest book I read, the TV shows I'm watching, or even what movie I want to watch over the weekend. As I walked, I noticed the change in the forest. The trees were getting taller and the trees were getting thicker. I loved this part of the forest. It was so peaceful and serene. \n\nHowever, as I turned a bend, I heard a faint cry. It was a cry that was unmistakable. A baby. I stopped dead in my tracks, my heart skipped a beat. I turned around and looked back. There wasn't anyone behind me. I could see my house in the distance, and I knew I was nowhere near it. I looked ahead and saw a cave. It was hidden behind the foliage and was covered in moss. I turned around again and looked back at the cave. I took a step closer, and that's when I heard it again. The crying was getting louder, and it was getting clearer. I took a deep breath and began to walk towards the cave. \n\nAs I walked towards the cave, I noticed that my feet felt as if they were walking on a thick blanket. The cave was filled with moss, and it was everywhere. I could see the edge of the cave, and I could see what looked like the entrance of the cave. I took one more step and entered the cave. The moment I entered the cave, I knew I was in a new world. The cave was dark, but my eyes adjusted quickly. I could see a shape in the corner of the cave. It was a crib. I could see the baby lying in it, crying. I took a few more steps, and that's when I saw the mother. \n\nThe mother was in her mid-twenties, with long brown hair. She was sitting on a rock, crying. She looked up, and I could see the tears in her eyes. She looked at me, and I could see the desperation in her eyes. She looked at me and held up her baby, crying, \"Please take care of my baby. Please don't let anything happen to it.\" I looked at the baby, and I knew I had to help. I took the baby from her, and she hugged me. \"Please don't let anything happen to him. He's my everything.\" I hugged her back, and I could feel the tears in her eyes. I looked at the baby and saw that it was asleep. I smiled and handed the baby back to its mother. \n\nI walked back to my house, and I couldn't stop thinking about the mother and the baby. I couldn't stop thinking about the desperation in her eyes. I knew that I had to help her. I knew that I had to find her. So, I made a mental note to find her tomorrow and take her and the baby to my house."

Then we got to the point where he started talking about The Beatles and the British Invasion of music.\n\nBefore the end of the show, I had to ask, \"Lord Coggy, how old are you?\" His response was, \"Let's just say I am older than you can comprehend.\" So I asked, \"What do you mean by that?\" His response was, \"I have lived over 5,000 years and have been alive for longer than the history of Europe. But what I want to say is, I saw the beginning of time and saw the end of the world as we know it.\"\n\nMy response was, \"I don't understand. What do you mean by the end of the world as we know it?\" His response was, \"I mean the end of the world with the sun. This world was built to be for the sun, but I saw a day when the sun went away and the world froze. But we built another world with the stars.\" My response was, \"How could we have built another world with the stars?\" His response was, \"We are not of this world, but we were here first.\"\n\nI couldn't believe what he was saying, but he seemed so genuine and sincere. I looked around the studio to see if anyone had heard him, but no one had. I was thinking about how I could use this information. If he was telling the truth, this could be huge. But on the other hand, if this was just a crazy old vampire telling stories about his youth, then I could get in trouble for broadcasting false information.\n\nI didn't have the answer to this and couldn't figure out what to do. Then it hit me. Maybe I didn't have to decide right now. I could always do some more research and ask him more questions. I looked at Lord Coggy and said, \"Thank you for being on the show and I will make sure to do some more research about this topic. Maybe I will invite you back on the show to answer some of the questions I have.\" He looked at me and said, \"I would like that.\"\n\nI was excited to learn more about this topic and I knew that this was going to be an adventure like no other. But as I sat down after the show and started to type up my notes, I couldn't shake off the feeling that we were in grave danger. Lord Coggy had been so calm and collected, that I almost felt like he had planned the whole thing. I tried to tell myself that I was being paranoid, but I knew that I was just being cautious. I was just hoping that I would be able to get to the bottom of this before it was too late.\n\nAs I typed up my notes, I couldn't help but feel like I was just a pawn in a much bigger game. Lord Coggy had been a guest on my show, but I had no idea that he had bigger plans. I couldn't help but wonder what he had planned next."

        "pred_story": "I was awakened by the sweet scent of incense and the sound of chanting. I was summoned to the mortal realm by the Zha'thik cult. It was the first time my followers had called upon me in years. It was my birthday, after all, and I had been looking forward to it. There was nothing I love more than the reverence and worship of mortals. I stretched my dark body, feeling the power course through my veins. I was the Zha'thik, a powerful elder god, worshipped in darkness and blood. I was the Bringer of Darkness and the Devourer of Worlds.\n\nI felt the call to the mortal realm growing stronger, so I decided to answer it. I was intrigued by the thought of celebrating my birthday in the mortal world. I could feel the energy of the mortal realm coursing through my veins, making me feel invigorated. I didn't bother to put on my mask and don my cloak, so I could see the world as it was. I was intrigued by the strange buildings and the strange attire of the mortals. I was fascinated by the concept of a currency, of a thing that could be used to purchase goods and services. I was fascinated by the fact that mortals could be so creative and resourceful. They were a strange species indeed.\n\nI arrived at the cult's temple in the city of New York. The cult members were surprised to see me standing before them in my true form. I didn't care about their surprise, I just wanted to know why they had called for me. A cult member stepped forward, bowing before me. \"Great Zha'thik, we have summoned you to celebrate your birthday.\"\n\nI was surprised by the cult's creativity. I had not seen such a celebration in years. They had created a temple in my image, complete with twisted and grotesque statues of my various incarnations. They had created an altar in my honor, with a giant stone statue of my head. They had even created a pool of blood in my honor, where they would sacrifice their mortal servants to me. I was pleased by their efforts.\n\nThe cult member spoke again. \"Great Zha'thik, we have brought you a gift. We hope you will accept it.\"\n\nI looked at the cult member in confusion. \"What gift?\" I asked.\n\nThe cult member held up a small box. \"This box contains your birthday gift. We hope you will be pleased by it.\"\n\nI looked at the box, feeling a sense of confusion. \"I do not understand. I am an elder god, I do not need gifts.\"\n\nThe cult member looked at me with a nervous expression. \"But, great Zha'thik, it is the way of mortal society to gift those you care about on their birthday. We thought you would appreciate the gesture.\"\n\nI looked at the cult member in confusion. \"I do not care about mortal society. I am a god, I do not need their petty rituals.\"\n\nThe cult member looked at me with a nervous expression. \"But, great Zha'thik, it is the way of the cult to gift our lord on his birthday. We thought it was a sign of our devotion.\"\n\nI looked at the cult member in confusion. \"I do not understand what you are saying. I am a god, I do not need the devotion of mortals. I need their worship, not their gifts.\"\n\nThe cult member looked at me with a nervous expression. \"But, great Zha'thik, we are not asking for your worship. We are asking for your favor. We want to be granted a single wish, to be granted the power to shape the destiny of the mortal world.\"\n\nI looked at the cult member in confusion. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nThe cult member looked at me with a nervous expression. \"We mean, great Zha'thik, that we want to be granted the power to shape the destiny of the mortal world. We want to be able to create our own destiny, to create our own reality.\"\n\nI looked at the cult member in confusion. \"I do not understand what you are saying. I am a god, I do not need mortals to help me shape the destiny of the world. I can do it myself.\"\n\nThe cult member looked at me with a nervous expression. \"But, great Zha'thik, we are not asking you to do it for us.

He had been working late nights doing some sort of data entry, and I had been trying to finish a school paper. He knocked on my door, and I asked what was up. He said he had a few minutes to chat.\n\n\"I'm in a bit of a bind,\" he said. \"My leg is broken, and I need to work but I can't leave the apartment. Do you mind watching my rent?\"\n\nI asked why he couldn't pay the rent by himself, and he said he needed to go to the doctor. I asked if he had a job to pay the rent, and he said he did but the doctor's visit would be expensive.\n\nI knew we had some money set aside for rent, so I told him I could cover it. He gave me the keys, and I took care of the rent. The landlord was understanding, and the rent was paid in full.\n\nI told my roommate that I had taken care of the rent, and he thanked me. He then asked if I could help him out a bit more. He explained that he was in a bit of a pickle because he was a minion for the villainous gang, \"The Menace,\" and he needed me to do him a solid.\n\n\"What kind of solid?\" I asked, getting a bit annoyed.\n\n\"I need you to wear my costume, and pretend to be me, while I recover,\" he said. \"I know it's a lot to ask, but I need to work, and the rent is due soon.\"\n\nI thought about it for a minute. My roommate is a pretty cool guy, and I'm pretty sure he would do the same for me if the positions were reversed. I didn't want to burn my bridges with him, and besides, I really needed the money.\n\n\"I'll do it,\" I said finally. \"But just for one day. And you need to give me your costume.\"\n\nI went to my room and started to get changed. The costume was a full-body black and green suit with a black helmet. It was tight-fitting, but I was able to get into it. The helmet was a bit stiff, but it wasn't too hard to wear.\n\nOnce I was dressed in the costume, I made my way to the kitchen to get a drink. My roommate came out of his room, and he was dressed in a suit. He looked like a normal businessman.\n\n\"I'm glad I could get you to do this,\" he said. \"I owe you one.\"\n\n\"Anytime,\" I said. \"But what do I need to do?\"\n\n\"You need to go to the office of The Menace,\" he said. \"They have their headquarters in the city. I'll give you a map to get there. Just go inside, and tell them that you're me, and you need to see the boss.\"\n\nI took the map, and I headed out of the apartment. I followed the directions to the office of The Menace. It was an old, abandoned warehouse in the city. I pushed open the door, and I went inside. I looked around for a bit, and I didn't see anything. I saw a reception desk, but there was no one there. I looked around for a bit, and then I heard a voice from behind me.\n\n\"Ah, you must be the new minion,\" the voice said. I turned to see a woman with long, flowing hair. She was wearing a black and green suit that was similar to mine.\n\n\"Yes, I'm the new minion,\" I said. \"And I'm here to see the boss.\"\n\nShe smiled, and she gestured to a door behind her.\n\n\"He's in there,\" she said. \"Just go on in.\"\n\nI nodded, and I walked through the door. I was in a large office, and there was a desk behind it. A man was sitting behind the desk, and he was looking at me. He was wearing a black and green suit that was similar to mine.\n\n\"Ah, you must be the new minion,\" he said. \"Welcome to The Menace. My name is Boris, and I'm the boss.\"\n\nI looked at Boris, and I nodded. He gestured for me to come closer, and I went over to the desk. He looked at me for a bit, and then he said, \"I'm glad to hear that you're eager to join The Menace. We're a big, evil organization, and we're always looking for new minions.\"\n\nI nodded, and I smiled. He gestured to a chair behind the desk, and I sat down. He asked me a few questions, and I answered them as best I could. He seemed satisfied, and he smiled.\n\n\"Well, it's been nice talking to you, new minion,\" he said. \"I think you'll do great here. Just do what you're told, and you'll be fine.\"\n\nI nodded, and I stood up. I looked around the office for a bit, and then I walked back out to the reception area. The woman was still there, and she smiled at me.\n\n\"Welcome to The Menace,\" she said. \"I'm glad you could join us.\"\n\nI smiled, and I nodded. I walked out of the office, and I went back to my apartment. My roommate was still there, and he was sitting on the couch. He looked up at me, and he smiled.\n\n\"How did it go?\" he asked.\n\nI told him about the office, and about meeting the boss. He listened intently, and he nodded. I told him about the questions he asked, and he smiled.\n\n\"Well, I'm glad to hear that,\" he said. \"I'll be back to work soon. Thanks for doing that for me.\"\n\nI nodded, and I smiled. I knew that my roommate was in a bit of a bind, and I was happy to help him out.\n\n\"That's what friends are for,\" I said."

I know. Mom's been worried about Dad.\" \n\nWe both looked out to our backyard and watched the grass sway in the wind. \n\nI sat up and looked at her. \"Wait, are you going to die?\" I asked.\n\nThe old lady turned and put her arms around me. \"I'm going to die. It's not a question. What I'm going to do is die in a way that won't be as painful.\"\n\nI looked at her arms on me, and felt tears well up. I hated death. I hated how it was inevitable, and how you could lose people you loved. \n\nBut the old lady held me tighter. \"I'm not going to lie to you, and you've been like a son to me. You've been around me for years, and you've been the only person I've ever met that I can talk about anything. You're one of the best people I've ever met.

You're the best person I've ever met.\"\n\nI sat up again, and looked out to the backyard, where the sun was starting to set. \"I'm sorry about your dad,\" I said. \n\nI looked back at the old lady, who was smiling. \"I'm sorry about your mom.\" \n\nWe both looked out at our backyard again. \"I'm going to miss you.\"\n\nThe old lady smiled, and hugged me again. \"I'll be looking out for you. I'll make sure you're alright. And when it comes time for me to die, don't forget about me.\"\n\nI looked at her, but she was serious. \"Don't worry. I won't forget.\"\n\nThe old lady smiled, and looked around at our backyard. \"Look at that.\" \n\nI looked to where she was pointing. It was a strange glow. It was like a rainbow, but not a rainbow. It was like nothing I'd ever seen. \n\n\"I've never seen anything like it,\" I said. \n\n\"It's a portal,\" the old lady said. \"I've been wanting to go through it, but it's not safe. It's a place where I can die with dignity.\"\n\nI looked at the glow. I didn't know what it was, but I wanted to know. \"What's going to happen to you?\" I asked.\n\nThe old lady smiled. \"I'm going to die. You're going to come back and tell your mom that I died peacefully, and that I'm in a good place. And you're going to tell your dad that I loved him, and that I'll be looking out for him.\"\n\nI looked at the glow again. It looked so big, and it seemed to be moving. It seemed to be moving closer and closer. \n\nAnd then, the glow disappeared. I looked at the old lady, who was smiling. \n\nShe looked up at the sky, and saw her death. I saw her death too, and it was beautiful. She was smiling, and it was like the sun was smiling with her. \n\nThe old lady looked down at me, and smiled. \"Thank you.\" \n\nI looked up at her. \"I'm going to miss you.\"\n\nThe old lady smiled, and hugged me again. \"I'll be looking out for you. And when it comes time for me to die, don't forget about me.\"\n\nI hugged her back. \"I won't forget.\"\n\nAnd with that, the old lady let go, and went through the portal. I looked up at the sky, where she had gone. \n\nAnd then, she was gone.\n\nI looked at the spot where she had gone, and saw a piece of paper. I picked it up, and looked at it. It was a note. \n\nI looked at the note, and saw the old lady's writing. It was the same writing she had always used. \n\nThe note said, \"Dear son, I love you, and I'm sorry for not being able to tell you where I'm going. I hope you're okay, and that your mom and dad are doing well. I'll be looking out for you, and I'll be with you. Remember to always be kind to others, and to always tell the truth. And when it comes time for you to die, don't forget about me.\"\n\nI looked at the note, and felt tears well up. I was going to miss her. I was going to miss her so much.\n\nI looked up at the sky, where she had gone. I knew that she was there. I knew that she was still with me.\n\nI looked at the note, and saw that it was folded in half. I folded it in half again, and put it in my pocket. \n\nI looked up at the sky, and saw the sun. I saw the sun shining, and it made me feel better. \n\nI looked around at our backyard, and saw the grass. It was still there, swaying in the wind.\n\nI looked at the spot where the old lady had gone, and saw the grass.

He hadn\u2019t eaten in a long time, he hadn\u2019t eaten the day before he ended up here, he hadn\u2019t eaten since he ended up here. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was the sun or the lack of food that had left him weak, he suspected the latter. He lay there on the damp dirt, his head pounding with every beat of his heart, his stomach growling with a hunger he was starting to lose hope of ever satiating. He coughed and spat on the ground, feeling a trickle of blood run from the corner of his mouth. The creature loomed over him. It was big, easily the height of a house and looked like a mass of twisted skin and bone. It had eyes that looked like they were made from another creature\u2019s skull and a beak that seemed to be twisted in a permanent scowl. Its head swayed from side to side, its beak seeming to twitch with a hunger that was almost palpable. The man wanted to run, he wanted to scream, he wanted to do something but his body refused to respond. His legs were limp, his arms were heavy and his head was too heavy to lift. The creature was almost nose to nose with him, its hot stinky breath washing over him and making his stomach churn. He couldn\u2019t even cough, let alone scream. The creature leaned in, its beak open wide, its eyes glowing in the dim light of the cave. The man closed his eyes and waited for it to end, he hoped it would be quick. \u201cYour kind eat apples?\u201d the creature rasped in a voice that sounded like a rusty gate. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d The man tried to speak but his voice was nothing more than a whisper. \u201cApples.\u201d The creature spat out the word. The man looked up at the creature, it was holding up a branch from an apple tree. It was a few feet long and the bark was stained with dirt and green shoots were bursting forth from the ends of the branches. The man couldn\u2019t help but look at the tree, he had never seen anything so green in his life. \u201cDid you get these?\u201d The creature pointed at him with its beak. The man nodded, not sure what else to do. \u201cWhy?\u201d The man couldn\u2019t help but ask. \u201cWhy do your kind eat apples?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He was desperate for a drink of water, he was desperate for some food. The creature dropped the branch and looked at him for a long moment. \u201cEat,\u201d it rasped. The man looked at the branch, he looked at the creature. He had no idea what to do. The creature leaned in again, its beak open wide, its eyes glowing bright green. The man could feel its breath wash over him again and he felt a wave of relief wash over him. He didn\u2019t want to die, he wanted to live. He looked at the branch again and his stomach growled. He looked at the creature and saw its eyes. It didn\u2019t look like it was going to eat him. It looked like it was going to give him something. He reached out a hand and felt a sharp pain run through his arm. He looked down to see the creature\u2019s beak had bitten him, its teeth were sharp and had left deep gashes in his arm. The man looked at the branch and then at the creature, he knew he was going to eat. He grabbed the branch and held it in his arms, feeling the rough bark and the green shoots poking his skin. He held it up to his mouth and took a bite. The taste was like nothing he had ever tasted before, sweet and tart and a little bit bitter. It was like a rollercoaster in his mouth. He took another bite, and then another, and then another. The creature watched him, its eyes glowing bright green. The man ate and ate until he had eaten the whole branch. He was full, he was content. He looked at the creature and smiled. \u201cThank you,\u201d he rasped. The creature turned and walked away, leaving the man alone in the dark cave. He looked around and saw the hole the creature had made, he looked through it and saw the bright blue sky outside. He didn\u2019t even notice the sun. He had no idea how long he had been in the cave. He didn\u2019t even care. He had eaten. He had lived. He was free. He crawled through the hole and looked around. The creature was nowhere to be seen. He looked around and saw a forest, it was big and green and there were trees everywhere. He looked down and saw a stream, it was fast and clear and it ran right through the forest. The man followed the stream until he found a small clearing. He looked around and saw a small pond, it was calm and peaceful and there was a small apple tree growing out of it. The man looked at the tree and smiled, he knew he was going to be okay. He looked at the pond and saw his reflection staring back at him. He was gaunt and pale, but he was alive. He looked at the tree again and smiled. He was home."

I could see his bones, and I could feel his muscles shifting under my palms. But this was not for me. This was for the dragons that I was tasked with finding. I needed them to do the work for me, and that work was to be the dragons' to do. I could feel my bones shifting, and my muscles growing, but I could not see it.

There was so much damage. But it was a slow process. I could feel myself being healed. It just took a while. Like anything, it was a process. I was going to do this, and I was going to do it without your help. So go away. Please. I don't want to hear it. Just go. I knew he was going to be mad, or at least irritable. It was my fault I was hurt, after all. I had been on the battlefield, and my friends had taken a shot at me. They could have killed me, but for some reason, they didn't. It wasn't because of their aim. It was just luck. \n\n\"Are you okay?\" I heard, and I groaned. He was still here. I was going to have to deal with this. I tried to ignore him, and I tried to ignore his touch as he took my hand. I felt a pang in my chest, and I tried to pull away, but his grip held tight. I tried to push him away, but he was stronger than me. He had to be. \n\n\"Hey, let me go. I told you I'm fine.\" \n\n\"You are not fine. You've been shot in the chest and back.

You don't need to help me.\" \n\nI could see him hesitate, and I knew he was worried about me. But I was healing. I was fine. I was going to be okay. I was already on my way.

        "pred_story": "&#x200B;\n\nThe alarm echoed in my mind as I lay down next to the woman and lifted her head onto my lap. Her wounds were bad. I could tell she was close to passing out, her vision cloudy as she tried to gaze at me with her one good eye. I carefully looked at her other eye. There was some blood running out of it and her eye was all black and red.\n\n\u201cHang on\u201d, I said and carefully picked up the first aid kit in my living room. I opened the case and rummaged through the contents. I carefully cleansed and bandaged her wounds, making sure to dress them with gauze to keep them moist. I used the alcohol swabs to clean the wounds before dressing them. It was an old first aid kit. I had bought it a few years back and never got around to checking it. It had a lot of old expired supplies. I had to get out of the house to get the more up-to-date supplies.\n\nI carefully got up and carried the woman over to the couch and sat down with her in my arms. I was still wearing the towel on my head. I pulled it off and tossed it onto the coffee table. I looked at the woman\u2019s face. She was so beautiful. I tried to think of a way to get to my closet to grab some clothes for her but she started to move her head. She was trying to look at me.\n\n\u201cHey\u201d, I said and gently turned her head to the side. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay. I have a first aid kit. I just need to get more supplies to finish treating your wounds.\u201d She tried to say something but I couldn\u2019t hear her. \u201cI need to get out of the house. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n\nI carefully set the woman down on the couch and ran to the door. I ran back to the living room and grabbed the first aid kit, and then ran to the front door. I had to open it and grab the key off the rack. I quickly ran across the lawn and into the garage. I closed the door behind me and pulled the curtains over the windows.\n\nThe garage was small. There was a few bicycles and a car, a Honda Civic. I was happy that the garage had a small room above the car. It was a small attic room. It was just big enough to fit the woman in. I ran up the stairs and locked the door behind me. I opened the window and leaned it out. I looked down to make sure it was clear and then leaned in and carefully picked up the woman. I ran her up to the room and set her down on the couch.\n\nI looked around the room. There was a small bed, a small desk, and a small chair. It was small but it was perfect. I ran down the stairs and grabbed the first aid kit and ran back up. I set the kit on the desk and started to open it.\n\n\u201cAlright\u201d, I said and started to rummage through the contents. \u201cI have most everything I need to treat your wounds. I just need to get some pain medication and you should be okay.\u201d I looked at the woman\u2019s face. She was in a lot of pain. I looked back at the first aid kit. I didn\u2019t have any pain medication. I needed to get some out of the house.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right back\u201d, I said and started to leave the room. I ran down the stairs and ran back to the front door. I opened it and grabbed the key off the rack and ran back across the lawn and into the garage. I pulled out a small box out of the storage cabinet and ran back to the house. I opened the box and grabbed two acetaminophen pills and a couple of ibuprofen pills. I grabbed a small cup of water and ran back up to the room. I sat down in the chair and looked at the woman. I was careful when I handed the pills to her. I wanted to make sure she didn\u2019t choke.\n\n\u201cSwallow slowly\u201d, I said and watched as she did. \u201cI want to get you some food too. I have a refrigerator full of food. We\u2019ll eat in a bit. Is it okay if I call for help?\u201d I said and looked at the woman. She nodded her head. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll call.\u201d\n\nI ran back downstairs and ran into the living room. I looked around the room and noticed the phone wasn\u2019t connected. I ran to the phone and looked at it. I couldn\u2019t find the cord to connect the phone. I looked around the room again. I found an old cord lying on the floor and ran back to the phone. I connected the cord and grabbed the phone. I ran to the living room and sat down on the couch. I picked up the phone and started to dial the phone number. I had to wait for the operator. I had to wait a few minutes for the operator to answer.\n\n\u201c911, what is your emergency?\u201d I heard the voice on the other end of the phone. \u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cHi\u201d, I said and cleared my throat. \u201cI have a woman who was shot. She needs medical attention.\u201d I gave the operator the address and waited a few minutes for her to hang up.\n\nIt was a few minutes before I heard the sound of sirens. The ambulance had arrived and pulled up in front of the house. I had the woman ready to go. She was sitting up on the couch and was dressed in a white robe. I had her wrapped in a blanket. I stood up and walked to the front door and opened it. I heard the sound of footsteps coming up the porch.\n\nI looked at the woman and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay\u201d, I said and looked at her face. She smiled back at me. I looked at the door and heard the sound of people walking up the porch. I looked at the woman and took a deep breath. I stepped aside and let the paramedics in.\n\nI looked at the woman and smiled. She was going to be okay. The paramedics were talking to her, trying to figure out what happened to her. I watched as the paramedics looked at her face and then looked at me. I shook my head and smiled.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, I said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d I looked at the woman and then back at the paramedics. \u201cShe was shot, isn\u2019t she?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYes, she is\u201d, one of the paramedics said. \u201cDo you have any information about who shot her?\u201d I shook my head.\n\nI looked at the woman and smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be okay\u201d, I said. \u201cThat\u2019s all that matters.\u201d I looked at the paramedics and smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d\n\nThe paramedics nodded and looked at the woman. I watched as they took her away. I looked at the empty room and smiled. She was going to be okay. I walked back to the room and sat down on the couch. I looked at the window and smiled. She was going to be okay."

        "pred_story": "&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was a Tuesday morning, the day before the fourth of July, and the sun beat down on the pavement like a hammer.  It was a heat wave, the kind of heat that made it feel like you would burn the skin right off your bones just by stepping out the door.  It was a day like any other for me, just another day of waiting.  I had spent the previous night at the mission, it was a place where the homeless could come and sleep on the floor.  I had spent the night before that at another mission, and the night before that, and I wasn't sure how much more I could take.\n\nI had been homeless for about a year now, and I was starting to lose hope.  There was no jobs to be had, and no one seemed to care about helping the poor.  They would just give us food and a place to sleep, but nothing more.  It was like we were disposable.\n\nSo, when I saw a sign in the window of a building, offering a hundred bucks to participate in a medical trial, I didn't think twice.  I knew it was a scam, but I was desperate.  I would do just about anything to get out of this life and into one that had a future.\n\nThe sign said that the trial would only take an hour, and all I had to do was swallow a pill.  I thought it sounded simple enough, so I went inside.  There was a young woman waiting for me in the lobby, and she took my temperature and my blood pressure.  She asked me a series of questions, and I answered them all as honestly as I could.  Then, she handed me a pill and told me to swallow it.\n\nThe pill was small, and it tasted like a sweet tea.  I was surprised by how easy it was.  I thought it would be harder to swallow it, but it just slipped right down.  She told me to lie down on the table, and that the pill would work quickly.  I did as she said, and she started to hook me up to all sorts of machines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe started to explain to me what the pill was going to do, but I wasn't really listening.  I was too busy thinking about how good it felt to be lying down.  I had been standing or walking all day, and it felt great to be still.  I felt a bit of a weight lift off my shoulders, and my body started to relax.  It was like all my muscles had been tight and tense, and now they were finally starting to let go.\n\nI didn't notice that the machines were beeping faster and faster until I heard a voice in my head.  It was a soft voice, and it was telling me that the pill was working.  I wasn't sure what it was saying, but it seemed to be calm and soothing.  I felt a bit of a tingle in my body, but it wasn't unpleasant.  I was starting to feel a bit dizzy, but the voice was telling me that everything was okay.\n\nI don't know how long I was like that, but it seemed like hours.  I was starting to feel a bit confused, but the voice was still telling me that everything was okay.  I started to feel a bit scared, though, and I tried to sit up.  The woman was nowhere to be found, but the machines were still beeping away.  I tried to get up, but I felt a bit weak.  I didn't have the strength to lift my head, and I just lay there.\n\nI was starting to feel a bit scared, and I didn't know what to do.  I had been told that the pill was safe, but I didn't know that.  I didn't know what was going on, and I didn't know if I was going to be okay.  I just lay there, feeling scared and confused.\n\nBut then, everything went black.\n\nI don't know how long I was out, but it seemed like I had been out for hours.  I slowly came to, and I was confused.  The machines were still beeping away, but the woman was nowhere to be found.  I was still lying on the table, but I was starting to feel a bit stronger.  I tried to sit up, but I felt a bit dizzy.\n\nI lay back down, and I tried to gather my thoughts.  I was starting to remember things, but they were fuzzy.  I remembered the woman, and I remembered the machines.  I remembered the pill, and I remembered feeling dizzy.  But I didn't remember anything else.\n\nI didn't know what had happened, and I didn't know if I was going to be okay.  I just lay there, feeling scared and confused.  I was trying to remember, but it was all fuzzy.\n\nI was starting to feel a bit frustrated, and I was starting to feel a bit angry.  I had been lied to, and I didn't know what was going on.  I was starting to feel a bit scared, and I didn't know if I was going to be okay.\n\nBut then, I heard a voice.  It was a soft voice, and it was telling me that everything was okay.  I was starting to feel a bit scared, but the voice was calm and soothing.  I was starting to feel a bit confused, but the voice was telling me that everything was okay.  I was starting to feel a bit frustrated, but the voice was telling me that everything would be okay.\n\nI don't know how much time passed, but I started to feel a bit better.  The machines were still beeping away, but I was starting to feel stronger.  I was starting to remember things, and I was starting to feel a bit more clear-headed.  I was starting to feel a bit scared, but the voice was still telling me that everything was okay.\n\nI was trying to remember, but it was all fuzzy.  I was trying to think, but my mind was a bit foggy.  But then, the voice was telling me that everything was okay.  I was starting to feel a bit better, and I was starting to feel a bit clearer.  I was starting to remember things, and I was starting to feel a bit more confident.\n\nI don't know how much time passed, but I was starting to feel a bit more like myself.

last felt this rush, but a new hero had risen, and he needed to take action.\u00a0 Since his last attempt to take down a hero, his father had passed away, and he felt that he couldn't take on a hero by himself, so he sought out a new partner, one that had been a thorn in his side.\u00a0 He had to find out who it was and convince them to work with him, and then they could take on that hero.\n\nHe saw a figure standing in the shadows, and he walked towards them.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the one they call Stryfe.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what do you have to do with what I want?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to be your partner, your sidekick, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want to call it that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re not looking for a partner, then I\u2019m not interested.\u00a0 I\u2019m done with being on my own.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a plan to take down a hero.\u00a0 I need a partner, someone who has my back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat hero do you want to take down?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one who killed my father.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you find out about that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father told me.\u00a0 He was a member of a team, a team that was thought to be extinct.\u00a0 The hero who killed him was a member of that team, and he\u2019s been causing problems ever since.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you want to kill him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do.\u00a0 But I want to take him down in a way that doesn\u2019t get me in trouble.\u00a0 I was thinking we could set a trap for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds like a good plan.\u00a0 But I have a few questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a few questions too.\u00a0 Like, who is this hero and where can we set the trap.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u00a0 He\u2019s a well known hero, a member of the team that I told you about.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about this hero or your team.\u00a0 You haven\u2019t told me much about your background or what happened to your father.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t have much time to talk.\u00a0 I need your help right now.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t want to be my partner, then I\u2019ll find someone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to set a trap, then we need to know more about this hero, and I need to know more about you.\u00a0 Can we talk about this in a coffee shop?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u00a0 We can talk in a coffee shop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can walk there together.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nThey walked side by side, both wearing the same kind of outfit.\u00a0 He thought about how much he wanted to take her in his arms and tell her that he wasn\u2019t a hero, but he knew that he couldn\u2019t do that.\n\nWhen they got to the coffee shop, they ordered their drinks and sat down at a table.\u00a0 She asked him questions about his father, and he told her about how he had been killed by a hero, a hero who had been a member of a team that was thought to be extinct.\n\n\u201cAnd then that hero became a vigilante?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u00a0 He has been causing problems ever since.\u00a0 I want to take him down, but I don\u2019t know how to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to help you.\u00a0 I have a few

know how to handle a hero in a fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can teach you how to make a trap.\u00a0 But you need to know how to handle a hero in a fight.\u00a0 Let\u2019s talk about this later.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you willing to help me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u00a0 I\u2019ll help you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI appreciate that.\u00a0 And I appreciate that you don\u2019t want to know more about me.\u00a0 I\u2019ll tell you about my past if you want to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to know.\u00a0 I want to focus on this hero and taking him down.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u00a0 We can talk about that later.\u201d\n\nThey talked about the hero and the plan to take him down.\u00a0 They came up with a few different ideas, but they decided on a trap.\u00a0 They would set a trap for the hero, a trap that would look like a fight between two people, but would actually be a fight between the hero and two people, people who would be disguised as civilians.\n\nThey agreed that they would set the trap soon, and then they would talk about it later.\u00a0 She wanted to know more about her new partner and her new job, and she didn\u2019t want to talk about it right now.\n\nThe hero walked into the coffee shop, and he saw the two of them sitting at a table.\u00a0 He walked over to them and sat down.\n\n\u201cIs this seat taken?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t reserve it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u00a0 I was just about to leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Stryfe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hero\u2019s name is Stryfe too.\u00a0 Is that a coincidence?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt could be.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t think it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you get the name Stryfe?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father gave me that name.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father gave me that name too.\u00a0 What did he say?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said that I was a spy.\u201d\n\n\u201cA spy?\u00a0 I was a spy too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe both had the same job.\u00a0 We both worked for a team.\u00a0 We both had the same boss.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u00a0 I never knew that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never knew that either until I found out who you were.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am the child of the strongest superhero on the planet, a hero who was

that my father was a part of.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father was a member of that team too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew that.\u00a0 And I knew that you were killed by him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that I

killed my father.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u00a0 That was the other hero who was killed.\u00a0 He was the leader of the team.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Stryfe was the leader of the team.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u00a0

        "pred_story": "\"Ah, how delightful!\" I cackled as I read the news. \n\nI had done it again. I had created the most adorable predicaments/punishments ever, specifically tailored to the heroes that opposed me. They thought they were fighting for good, but little did they know that they were actually fighting for me to be a more creative villain. It was a symbiotic relationship, really. They would make my job easier, and I would make their lives more interesting. \n\nMy first target was my favorite hero, the one I had dubbed 'Pissypants' due to his ability to lose control of his bladder at the most inopportune moments. I had created a time-traveling device that allowed me to go back in time and relive every embarrassing moment Pissypants had ever experienced. I had put him in a box and told him that it was a reward for his bravery, and he had fallen for it hook, line, and sinker. Every time he tried to escape, I would teleport him back to the moment when he was forced to wear a diaper like a toddler and change his own diaper like a baby. I laughed every time I saw him running around like a lunatic, trying to escape, but I knew he would never escape. He would be trapped in this prison of his own making forever. \n\nMy second target was 'Slippery Slope' - a hero who had the ability to glide across any surface like a skateboarder. I had created a device that could suck the friction from the ground, causing Slippery Slope to lose his ability to move. He was trapped in a small cage with no escape, and I could watch him struggle and flail like a fish out of water. Every time he tried to use his powers to slip away, I would teleport him back to the cage and watch him try again. It was like watching a video game, but better, because Slippery Slope was actually experiencing this in real life. \n\nMy third target was 'The Whiner', a hero who was always complaining about how unfair life was. I had created a device that could amplify The Whiner's whining to the point where it was louder than a jet engine. I had put him in a room with no windows, and every time he tried to complain, the device would turn on, and the sound would blast his ears off. I could watch him try to hold his head in his hands, but it was too late, he was already deafened by his own whining. \n\nMy fourth target was 'The Big Guy', a hero who was as strong as a tank. I had created a device that could reduce his size to that of a mouse, and I had put him in a cage with no escape. Every time he tried to break out, I would teleport him back to the cage and watch him try again. It was like watching a video game, but better, because The Big Guy was actually experiencing this in real life. \n\nI had created a device that could turn anyone into anything they wanted to be, but only for a day. My fifth target was 'The Master of Illusions', a hero who could create illusions so convincing that they could fool even the most skeptical of minds. I had created a device that could turn The Master of Illusions into a chicken for a day. I could watch him clucking and flapping his wings like a chicken, trying to escape, but I knew he would never escape. He would be trapped in this prison of his own making forever. \n\nMy sixth target was 'The Speedster', a hero who could move faster than the speed of light. I had created a device that could slow The Speedster down to a crawl, and I had put him in a box and told him that it was a reward for his bravery. Every time he tried to escape, I would teleport him back to the moment when he was trapped in the box, and watch him struggle and flail like a fish out of water. It was like watching a video game, but better, because The Speedster was actually experiencing this in real life. \n\nMy seventh target was 'The Time Lord', a hero who had the ability to manipulate time itself. I had created a device that could turn The Time Lord's powers against him, causing him to relive every embarrassing moment he had ever experienced. I had put him in a box and told him that it was a reward for his bravery, and he had fallen for it hook, line, and sinker. Every time he tried to escape, I would teleport him back to the moment when he was trapped in the box, and watch him try again. It was like watching a video game, but better, because The Time Lord was actually experiencing this in real life. \n\nI had created a device that could turn anyone into anything they wanted to be, but only for a day. My eighth target was 'The Trickster', a hero who was always up to something mischievous. I had turned The Trickster into a statue, and I could watch him try to move, but he was stuck in this prison of his own making forever. Every time he tried to break free, I would teleport him back to the statue, and watch him try again. It was like watching a video game, but better, because The Trickster was actually experiencing this in real life. \n\nI had created a device that could turn anyone into anything they wanted to be, but only for a day. My ninth target was 'The Shadow', a hero who was a master of stealth and disguise. I had turned The Shadow into a giant, invisible, jelly-filled donut, and I could watch him try to escape, but he was trapped in this prison of his own making forever. Every time he tried to break free, I would teleport him back to the donut, and watch him try again. It was like watching a video game, but better, because The Shadow was actually experiencing this in real life. \n\nI had created a device that could turn anyone into anything they wanted to be, but only for a day. My tenth target was 'The Mind Reader', a hero who could read the minds of anyone. I had turned The Mind Reader into a goldfish, and I could watch him try to escape, but he was trapped in this prison of his own making forever. Every time he tried to break free, I would teleport him back to the fish tank, and watch him try again. It was like watching a video game, but better, because The Mind Reader was actually experiencing this in real life. \n\nI had created a device that could turn anyone into anything they wanted to be, but only for a day. My eleventh target was 'The Dreamer', a hero who could manipulate the dreams of anyone. I had turned The Dreamer into a cat, and I could watch him try to escape, but he was trapped in this prison of his own making forever. Every time he tried to break free, I would teleport him back to the cat, and watch him try again. It was like watching a video game, but better, because The Dreamer was actually experiencing this in real life. \n\nI had created a device that could turn anyone into anything they wanted to be, but only for a day.

At his feet lay the remains of the castle, a castle which would have been invincible had the man not turned a powerful mech into a piece of scrap metal. The man sighed as he looked down at the castle and began to disassemble his mech further. His destination was far away and he could not afford to carry all the scrap metal he was leaving behind.\n\nThe mech was a good machine, it was just old. It had been left behind by the company that had used it for a few short years. It was not like it was still functional either. He had had to kill the other pilot and then rip the mech apart to turn it into a mobile base of operations.\n\nIn that valley was the capital city of the first kingdom he had ever been in. It had been the first place he had ever gone in his new life as well. He had been sent there by the god of his people, the god who had told him he was his chosen vessel to bring back the technology of his old world to his people.\n\nIt was a good plan in theory, but the man had gotten to his first destination and found the city already in ruins and the only inhabitants of the city were a group of barbarian-like warriors who had no technology of their own.\n\nThe first time they had seen him, they had believed he was a god and had worshipped him. The second time they had seen him, they had believed he was a demon and had tried to kill him. The third time they had seen him, they had realized he was something in between and had begged for his mercy.\n\nThe man had chosen to leave them alone, they were weak but they were also still in the early stages of their war against the monsters that had taken over their world. He had left them alone and they had been able to survive a little longer because of it.\n\nNow he was on his way to his third destination, and it was a long way from here.\n\nThe man sighed as he began to pack up his campsite. He had gotten himself a small cabin in a small village as he had passed through the village on his way from the previous kingdom. He had been welcomed by the villagers and had been offered a place to stay in the cabin.\n\nThe man had accepted their offer and had stayed in the cabin for a few days. It was a good place to rest and he had been able to do some repairs on his mech.\n\nNow he was on his way again, and he was not sure where he would end up or what kind of people he would meet. He knew it would not be the first time he had been greeted with hostility, but he also knew that he had a way to deal with it if it came to that.\n\nThe man climbed back into his cabin and began to pack up his campsite. He was not sure how much longer he would be able to keep this up, the cabin had been a gift from the villagers and they had asked him to stay for a few more days.\n\nThe man had accepted their offer and had stayed in the cabin for a few days.

And we're going to eat the humans for dinner.\"\n\nI was taken aback by her words. It was a simple thing to kill her. But something about her words stuck in my mind.

I knew what I had seen, I knew what I had felt.\n\nI walked out of the vault, the silence broken by the sound of my footsteps. The door closed behind me, and I was plunged into darkness. I reached out in front of me, feeling my way through the darkness, until I could feel the wall to my side.\n\nI walked along the wall until I could feel the door to my left. I reached out and felt for a handle, and my hand found one. I turned it and walked through the door, finding myself back in the ship.\n\nI sat down and breathed, feeling my chest expand and deflate. I was back in the ship, back in the air. I was back in the real world, the world of technology. I didn't have to wonder about the vault, I didn't have to wonder what I had seen.

So, we've come to collect.\"\n\nThe dragon snorted, its fire burning brighter.\n\n\"And what happens if I don't pay?\" it asked.\n\n\"Oh, well,\" the knight replied. \"We'll just take out a lien on your hoard and attach it to your assets.\"\n\nThe dragon's fire died down, its mind racing with the implications. \"And then what?\"\n\nThe knight smiled. \"Then we'll take you in for questioning. You'll have to pay your taxes and any penalties that have accrued over the years.

I don't think I should have to pay for their mistakes.\"\n\nThe knight nodded. \"I see what you're saying. But we can discuss that further. Let's just say that you're not the first dragon to have this problem, and we've got a system in place to deal with it.\"\n\nThe dragon breathed a sigh of relief, its fire dying down.\n\n\"I...

        "pred_story": "*The streets were alive with the sounds of a thousand human voices. The smell of blood was a far cry from the stench of death the streets typically wore, at least not in this part of the world, in this city. The sun was shining, casting the shadows across the buildings and the people. The air was thick with the scent of life, the scent of humanity. All the things he used to despise. It had been years since he'd last ventured into the city, longer since he'd felt the warmth of the sun on his skin. His heart had grown cold, his stomach was numb. He didn't need to eat, didn't need to feel the rush of life that the humans took for granted. That's what they thought, anyway. He was a century old, had been alive for all that time. He'd seen the rise and fall of civilizations, had walked among the empires of old, seen the wars that would never end, and the people who fought them. He'd been a part of the world in a way he never thought possible, yet he was also apart from it. The humans were like ants to him, crawling over each other, never stopping to think about the world around them. His kind was a reminder of what they could be, what they could have been. They were gods and monsters, the stuff of nightmares and dreams. He'd walked among the humans for so long that he'd grown numb to them, had stopped feeling the way he used to. It was almost like he'd forgotten what it was to be human. It wasn't until he heard the news that he remembered what it was like. A child, only eight years old, had lost her parents to a fire in the city. He'd heard the news, but it wasn't until he saw her that he remembered what it was to be human. She was a tiny little thing, no bigger than his thumb, with skin as white as snow and hair as black as coal. Her eyes were red and puffy, and tears streamed down her cheeks as she clung to her older brother. He was trying to comfort her, but it was clear that he was as scared as she was. A century was a long time, but he'd learned enough about human nature to understand what she was going through. The fire had taken everything, leaving them with nothing. The humans were a stupid and selfish creature, always trying to do more than they could handle. They were like ants, but they'd built a civilization out of nothing. He couldn't help but think that they were like the gods he'd worshiped so long ago. He'd seen the destruction of the world time and again, seen civilizations rise and fall like the ebb and flow of the sea. And yet, they kept coming back. It was as if they had a purpose, a drive to be something more than the animals they were. He'd forgotten what it was to be human, but he'd learned what it meant to be alive. And it was that which drew him to the child, that which drew him to the human world. He'd seen the destruction that they caused, but he'd also seen the beauty of the world they'd built. It was a reminder of what they could be, what they could achieve. And that was what drove him to do what he did. He'd never felt the need to be a part of the human world before, had never felt the need to help the humans before. But there was something about the child, something about the world they'd built. It was a reminder of what he'd forgotten, a reminder of what he was. He was a vampire, a creature of the night, and he had the power to do something to help the child. It was a risk, but he knew that it was the right thing to do. He didn't know what the future held, but he knew that he had to do something. And so, he did. He'd gone to the city, had walked among the humans, and had found the child. She was small and scared, but she was also strong and resilient. She'd been through a lot in her short life, and it was clear that she would be okay. He'd seen her potential, had seen what she could become, and he'd made the decision to help her. He didn't know how it would turn out, didn't know if it would be successful, but he knew that it was the right thing to do. And that's all that mattered. He'd never felt the need to be a part of the human world before, had never felt the need to help the humans before. But there was something about the child, something about the world they'd built.

It's not supposed to work like that, but it does, and it's supposed to improve efficiency or something.\"\n\nThe officer facepalmed. \"You know, I'm not sure how you're still alive, but you're certainly a hazard to yourself and others.\"\n\nThe pilot looked dejected, and the officer softened a bit. \"What's your name, anyway?\"\n\n\"Uh... uh, Steve.

You can get your ship fixed up and go back to your regular life, or whatever you do.\"\n\nThe pilot nodded again, and the officer waved over one of his officers. \"Take Steve here to the safety inspection facilities. Get his ship looked over and fixed up, and give him some safety training. And please, for the love of all things sane, make sure he understands the importance of proper safety protocols.\"\n\nThe pilot was led away by the officers, still looking at the device in his hand. \"So... do you think it's actually the chronon accelerator?\" he asked, looking up at the officers.\n\nThe officers exchanged a confused glance. \"Uh, Steve? Do you know what a chronon accelerator is, even?\"\n\nThe pilot thought for a moment. \"Uh... is it something to do with... with... acceleration?\"\n\nThe officers sighed in unison. \"Steve, I think you need to go take that safety course.\""

        "pred_story": "In a vast, sprawling library, the shelves towered over the patrons like giants, their books bound in a leather as white as snow. It was a place of learning, of discovery, and of wonder. There were so many things in the universe that had yet to be explored, yet to be understood. The patrons were there to learn, to discover, and to wonder. There was one patron, however, who was there for a different reason. He was there to prove a point, to prove a theory, and to find evidence for something he had heard as a child. It was a theory that was so far-fetched, so absurd, that no one would ever believe it. That theory was that humans were not the dominant species in the universe, but were instead a myth, a hoax created by some other species. The patron's name was Xelk, and he was a member of a species that was known as the Glaciem. The Glaciem were a group of beings who were found in a universe that was much colder than their own. They were a group of beings who were well adapted to life in an icy environment, and who were well suited for life on planets that were much colder than Earth. Xelk was a being who was a member of the Glaciem, and who was known throughout the galaxy for his ability to explore new worlds, to discover new species, and to write about the wonders that he had encountered. It was a life that was filled with adventure, filled with danger, and filled with discovery. The planet that Xelk had come to explore was one that was much like the planet he called home, the planet that the Glaciem called home. It was a planet that was covered in ice, a planet that was cold and unforgiving. But it was also a planet that was beautiful, a planet that was full of wonder, and a planet that was full of life. Xelk had come to the planet to search for evidence of the humans, the creatures that he believed to be a hoax, a myth, a legend. He had heard stories about the humans, stories that told of a species that was found on a planet that was much hotter than any of the planets that the Glaciem had ever encountered. The stories told of a species that was 60% molten rock, a species that was unlike any of the species that the Glaciem had ever encountered. It was a species that was a myth, a hoax, a legend. But Xelk was a being who did not believe in myths, who did not believe in hoaxes, and who did not believe in legends. He was a being who believed in evidence, in facts, and in proof. And it was on this planet, this cold and unforgiving planet, that Xelk believed he would find the evidence he was searching for. The planet was known as Earth, and it was a planet that was full of life, a planet that was full of wonder, and a planet that was full of danger. Xelk had come to Earth to search for evidence of the humans, evidence that would prove that they were not a hoax, but were a real species. He had come to the planet to prove a point, to prove a theory, and to find evidence for something he had heard as a child. The point he was trying to prove was that the humans were a real species, and that they were a species that was unlike any other. The theory he was trying to prove was that the humans were a species that was found on a planet that was much hotter than any of the planets that the Glaciem had ever encountered. The evidence he was looking for was something that would prove that the humans were not a hoax, but were a real species. It was a search that was fraught with danger, a search that was fraught with uncertainty, and a search that was fraught with wonder. It was a search that would take Xelk to the very limits of his endurance, and to the very limits of his knowledge. But it was also a search that would reward him with something he had never seen before, something that he had never imagined. It was a search that would take him to the very limits of his understanding, and to the very limits of his knowledge. But it was also a search that would reward him with something he had never seen before, something that he had never imagined. It was a search that would change him forever, a search that would change his understanding of the universe, and a search that would change his understanding of life. It was a search that would reward him with something he had never seen before, something that he had never imagined. It was a search that would change him forever, a search that would change his understanding of the universe, and a search that would change his understanding of life. The search began on a planet that was much like the planet he called home, the planet that the Glaciem called home. It was a planet that was covered in ice, a planet that was cold and unforgiving. But it was also a planet that was beautiful, a planet that was full of wonder, and a planet that was full of life.

Oglethorpe was devastated when he was informed of the theft. The police said that they would look into the theft. They asked Oglethorpe if he would like to report a theft. Oglethorpe was skeptical about the police and the thieves. He had heard about how corrupt some members of the police were.

Oglethorpe was worried that his superiors would not be able to find the thieves and that he would not be able to get his possessions back.\n\nOglethorpe decided to not report the theft to the police. He was worried that the thieves would not be able to sell the stolen goods, that they would be caught. He decided to take matters into his own hands.

He was getting closer and closer to giving up, but he refused to do so. He was determined to recover his stolen goods.\n\nThen, he received a tip from a friend who was a journalist.

A whole island, a country, a landmass completely and utterly empty. Iceland, a country of around 360,000 people at the time, was now nothing but a desolate wasteland. The only sign of life was a small signpost on the very center of the country, the sign reading \"Iceland Player has left the game\".\n\nAt first everyone thought it was some kind of cruel joke, a prank played by the government. But as the days went by and nothing else changed, it slowly became clear that something had gone horribly wrong.\n\nNews crews flocked to the island from the mainland, desperate to be the first to get the scoop on what was happening. And as they arrived, they too couldn't believe their eyes. The once bustling streets were now nothing but a graveyard, the homes and buildings standing still like empty husks. There was no signs of struggle or violence, nothing but a complete and utter absence of life.\n\nAs the world struggled to wrap its head around the situation, governments came together to try and figure out what had happened. Was it some kind of mass evacuation? Was everyone just going to come back? Or was this the end?\n\nBut as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, it slowly became clear that something more sinister was at play.\n\nA group of scientists from Iceland, led by a man named Gunnar, had been working on a top secret project in the months leading up to the event. Their goal was to create a new kind of power source, one that harnessed the energy of the earth itself. And as they worked, they stumbled upon something that changed everything.\n\nThey had discovered a secret portal hidden deep beneath the earth. A portal that led to another world, a world that was similar to their own but with a few key differences.\n\nGunnar and his team were ecstatic when they discovered the portal. They knew they had stumbled upon something incredible, something that could change the course of human history. But as they began to experiment with it, they soon realized that they had unleashed something terrible.\n\nThe portal had been active for centuries, and during that time it had been home to an alien civilization. A civilization that had been quietly watching Earth, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. And as the Iceland team opened the portal, the aliens were drawn to the sound of the energy source.\n\nThe aliens were drawn to the earth's core, and as they touched it, they were suddenly flooded with visions of their past. Visions of their civilization being destroyed by some great calamity, and visions of their people being forced to flee to other planets to escape the destruction.\n\nAs the aliens delved deeper into these visions, their minds were consumed by madness. They saw their own people, their own world, and their own way of life all slipping away from them. They were unable to cope with the trauma that was suddenly thrust upon them, and as they continued to feed on the earth's energy, they were driven mad.\n\nAnd as they were driven mad, they began to consume the earth's energy at an alarming rate. The earth's core was drained dry, and as it was, the earth itself began to crumble. The ground began to shake, the earth began to crack, and the oceans began to boil.\n\nThe earth was in agony as the aliens continued to feed, and as they did, the people were forced to flee for their lives. And as they fled, they left behind their homes, their belongings, and their way of life. They left behind the world as they knew it, and as they flew to other planets to escape the destruction, they left behind the portal.\n\nAnd as the earth continued to crumble, the aliens continued to feed. They consumed everything in their path, leaving nothing but a barren wasteland behind. And as they did, they too were consumed by their own madness. They lost all sense of time and space, and as they did, they were trapped in a never-ending loop of visions and hallucinations.\n\nThe earth was dead, the aliens were dead, and the portal was closed. The world was forever changed, and as it was, the only sign that was left behind was the signpost on the center of the earth.

As I stood there, it shot a beam of light from the crater, and I felt the wish being pulled from my heart. As it was pulled, the crater began to shrink, the ground stopping its shaking and the skies clearing.\n\nThe world was saved, but at a terrible cost. The Wishstone, the star that had granted my wish, was now falling from the sky, heading straight for the earth. I knew I had to do something, but I was powerless to stop it. The Wishstone was a force of nature, a force that was beyond my control.\n\nAs the Wishstone fell towards the earth, I felt a strange sensation, a feeling of my wish being fulfilled. I looked around, and I saw that everything was exactly as I had wished it to be. The crater was gone, the earth was whole, and the world was at peace.\n\nBut there was more. As I stood there, I saw that the Wishstone was starting to glow. It was a bright, pulsing light, and it seemed to be growing stronger every second. I felt a strange sensation, a feeling of power and energy flowing through my veins. The Wishstone was not just a star, it was a source of magic and power.\n\nAs the Wishstone reached the earth, I felt the energy flow through me, and I knew that I had been changed forever. I was no longer the same person that I had been before, and I was not sure if I would ever be the same again.\n\nAs I looked out at the world around me, I saw that everything was different. The skies were a deeper blue, the air was cleaner, and the earth was more vibrant. The Wishstone had granted my wish, but it had also brought something much greater than that. It had brought magic and power to the world, and it had given me the ability to wield it.\n\nI knew that my life would never be the same again, and I was grateful for it. I was no longer powerless to stop the Wishstone, and I was no longer powerless to change the world. I was a wielder of magic and power, and I was determined to use it to make the world a better place.\n\nI was not sure what the future held, but I was excited to find out. I was not sure what I would do, but I knew that I would do it with magic and power on my side. I was no longer the same person that I had been before, and I was not sure if I ever would be again.\n\nBut one thing was certain, the world was a different place, and I was the reason why. I was the reason that the Wishstone had been brought to the earth, and I was the reason that it was now a source of magic and power. I was the reason that the world was at peace, and I was the reason that it was filled with magic and wonder.\n\nI was no longer powerless, and I was no longer alone.

        "pred_story": "The alien ship was unlike any of the spacecraft humans had ever built. Not only did it hover and glide with a strange grace, but it emitted no lights. It was as if the ship was a physical manifestation of the very universe itself, as if it was the embodiment of all of creation.\n\nThe ship was a massive, spherical structure, with a metallic sheen that glinted under the hot desert sun. It had no discernible doors or hatches, and yet, it was clear that it was some sort of vessel.\n\nThe aliens themselves were far more surprising. They were unlike anything humans had ever seen. They were tall, but not as tall as the average adult human, with skin that seemed to shift and change color like the shadows on a moonlit night.\n\nThey were dressed in strange, flowing robes that seemed to shimmer and dance around their bodies. The robes were made of a material that looked like silk, but was far more resilient. They were a dark, deep purple, and seemed to absorb the light around them, making them almost invisible.\n\nDespite their appearance, the aliens were clearly intelligent beings. They moved with a purpose, as if they were driven by a singular goal. They were moving quickly, almost as if they were racing against the clock.\n\nAs the humans watched, the aliens quickly set to work. They had brought strange equipment with them, which they used to build a large, metallic structure. The structure was unlike anything the humans had ever seen. It was massive, with thick, metallic supports that seemed to stretch up to the sky.\n\nThe structure was also covered in a strange, glowing material. The material glowed with a soft, blue light, which seemed to pulse and throb in time with the aliens' movements. The humans watched in awe as the aliens worked, fascinated by the strange sight.\n\nAs they worked, the aliens seemed to be arguing with each other. They were speaking in a strange, musical language that seemed to be a combination of clicks and whistles. The humans couldn't understand the language, but it was clear that the aliens were discussing something important.\n\nFinally, after what seemed like hours of work, the aliens completed the structure. They stepped back, and the humans could see that the structure was a large, metallic dome. The dome was surrounded by a series of thick, metallic supports, which seemed to be anchored to the ground.\n\nThe dome was a deep, rich purple, and it seemed to glow with a soft, blue light. The light was coming from the material that covered the dome, which seemed to be pulsing and throb with a rhythmic pattern.\n\nThe humans watched in awe as the aliens approached the dome. They moved with a sense of reverence, as if they were approaching a sacred site. They reached out and touched the dome, and the humans could see that the material on it was some sort of liquid.\n\nThe material seemed to be a combination of a liquid and a gas. It was as if the aliens had taken a liquid and filled it with a gas, creating a strange, hybrid material. The material was a deep, rich purple, and it seemed to be moving and flowing like a liquid.\n\nThe humans watched in awe as the aliens touched the material. They seemed to be communing with it, as if they were talking to it in some way. The material was glowing with a soft, blue light, and the humans could feel a strange energy emanating from it.\n\nAs they watched, the aliens began to speak. They spoke in their strange, musical language, which seemed to be a combination of clicks and whistles. The humans couldn't understand the language, but it was clear that the aliens were saying something important.\n\nThe aliens were speaking to the humans, but they were also speaking to each other. They seemed to be discussing something in their own language, while also translating it into a language that the humans could understand.\n\nThe humans watched in awe as the aliens spoke. They were fascinated by the strange sight, and they were eager to learn more about the aliens and their language. The aliens were speaking in a way that was both poetic and informative, and the humans were captivated by their words.\n\nAs they spoke, the aliens seemed to be telling the humans about their culture and society. They were discussing their history, their customs, and their way of life. The humans were fascinated by the information, and they were eager to learn more.\n\nThe aliens were also discussing their philosophy and spirituality. They were talking about their views on life and death, and their understanding of the universe. The humans were captivated by the discussion, and they were eager to learn more.\n\nAs the aliens spoke, the humans began to realize that they were not like them. They were different, with their own unique culture and society. They had their own history, customs, and way of life.

My heart was pounding. \"Who are you? Where are you?\"\n\nSilence. I waited. \"Hello, Alex.\"\n\nI was standing in my bedroom, brushing my teeth, when I heard it. \"Who are you?\"\n\nSilence. \"Hello, Alex.\"\n\nI stared at my reflection in the mirror.

I stayed still.\n\n\"Hello, Alex.\"\n\nThe voice stopped. I lay there, my heart pounding in my chest. I waited for the voice to come again, but it didn't. I waited for a long time. \n\nI opened my eyes. I was lying in my quarters, and I was alone. I looked around. I looked through the windows. There was nothing but space. I couldn't believe it.\n\nIt had been years since I'd heard that voice. I'd forgotten all about it. I'd forgotten that I'd been talking to myself.\n\n\"Hello?\" \n\nI spoke out loud. I'd been alone for four years, and it was nice to hear my own voice again.\n\nNo one answered.\n\nI was surprised. I'd been surprised so much over the past four years. Surprised at how much I'd enjoyed being alone. Surprised at how much I'd loved it. Surprised at how much I'd hated it.\n\n\"Hello?\" I repeated. \n\nThere was no answer."

He had been a young man on his first tour of duty in the United States Army when he had learned the word \"Medium\" and the word \"Earth\". He had been teased by the older soldiers. \"The general from the planet called 'Medium Earth'.\" It had been a nickname that had stuck, and now, 40 years later, he was a 4 star general. He had been given the nickname, the \"Medium Earth General\" and it seemed to fit quite well.\n\nHe had served his country for 40 years, and had seen many battles. He had fought in Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq. He had also been involved in many peaceful missions, including the construction of a hospital in a small village in Africa. He had been decorated for his service many times, but none of that mattered to him. He had always done his duty to the best of his ability, and he was proud of what he had accomplished.\n\nAs he sat behind his desk, he couldn\u2019t help but think about the future. He was getting older, and he knew that his time in the military would soon be coming to an end. He had already begun to look for other opportunities, and was considering teaching history at a local university. He had always been interested in teaching, and he knew that he would be good at it.\n\nAs he thought about his future, the phone on his desk rang. He picked it up, and heard a voice on the other end. \"General, we have a situation. We have surveillance satellites in Low Earth Orbit, Middle Earth Orbit, and...\" The general listened for a moment, before responding. \"Don\u2019t you mean Medium Earth Orbit, General?\" There was a pause on the other end of the line, before the general heard the voice again. \"No Sir, spying on the Hobbits has been our greatest advantage.\"\n\nThe general looked up, a smile on his face. He had always been a fan of the hobbits, and he knew that they were a wonderful people. He had read many books about them, and had even been to the Shire once. He had been there on a mission, and had been able to walk through the rolling green hills and to visit the famous hobbit holes. He had been amazed by the beauty of the place, and he had always wanted to go back.\n\nAs he thought about the hobbits, the general couldn\u2019t help but think about the great battles that they had fought in. They had fought against the dark lord Sauron, and had emerged victorious. They had also fought against the armies of Mordor, and had emerged victorious once again. The general had always been in awe of the bravery and the determination of the hobbits, and he knew that he would always respect them.\n\nAs the conversation came to an end, the general put the phone down and stood up. He had a meeting with the President in a few minutes, and he needed to get ready. He walked to his closet and opened the door, revealing a perfectly tailored suit and tie. He dressed quickly, before making his way to the meeting.\n\nThe meeting was with the President, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. The general was there to discuss the situation in the Middle East, but he knew that he would also be discussing the situation with the hobbits. He had always been interested in the hobbits, and he knew that they would be an important topic of discussion.\n\nAs the meeting began, the general stood at the front of the room. He was the only one in the room without a uniform, but he was comfortable in his civilian clothes. He had been wearing them for many years, and he felt like they were his usual attire.\n\nThe discussion began, and the general listened intently. He knew that the situation with the hobbits was a serious one, and he wanted to make sure that he understood everything. The President spoke first, explaining the situation with the hobbits. The hobbits were a peaceful people, but they were also a proud people. They had fought in many battles, and they had always emerged victorious. The President explained that the hobbits were an important ally, and that they would be a key player in any future conflicts.\n\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff spoke next, explaining the military situation. They explained that the hobbits were a powerful force, and that they would be a key player in any future battles. The Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee spoke last, explaining the budget situation. He explained that the hobbits were an important ally, and that they would be an important part of the budget for the upcoming year.\n\nAs the meeting came to an end, the general nodded his head in agreement. He knew that the situation with the hobbits was serious, and that they would be an important ally in any future conflicts. He knew that he would be working closely with the hobbits in the coming years, and he was excited about the prospect.\n\nAs the meeting came to an end, the general stood up and shook hands with the President. \"Thank you for your time, Mr. President,\" he said. \"I will do everything in my power to help the hobbits.\" \"Thank you, General,\" the President replied. \"I know that you will do everything you can to help our allies.\" The general smiled and nodded his head, before leaving the room and returning to his office.\n\nThe general spent the rest of the day in his office, working on the budget for the upcoming year. He knew that the hobbits would be an important part of the budget, and he wanted to make sure that they were properly funded. He worked tirelessly, making sure that everything was in order.\n\nAs the day came to a close, the general stood up and stretched. He had been working for many hours, and he was feeling tired. He knew that he would need to get some rest, but he also knew that he would have to go back to work tomorrow. He was looking forward to working with the hobbits, and he was excited to see what the future held.\n\nThe general made his way home, feeling happy and content. He knew that he had done a good job, and he was proud of what he had accomplished. He was also excited about the future, and he knew that he would always do his best to serve his country.\n\nAs he walked through the front door, the general was greeted by his wife. \"Hello, dear,\" she said. \"How was your day?\" \"It was good, dear,\" the general replied. \"I had a meeting with the President and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. We discussed the situation with the hobbits.\" \"The hobbits?\" the general's wife asked. \"Yes, the hobbits,\" the general replied. \"We are going to be working with them in the future.\" \"That's good,\" the general's wife said. \"I'm glad to hear that. We should celebrate tonight.\" \"I would like that,\" the general said, smiling. \"I have a bottle of wine in the cellar. We can open it and drink it together.\" \"That sounds like fun,\" the general said. \"I'll go get the bottle.\" The general's wife smiled and"

She's a tall blonde woman in her fifties with an ever-present smile on her face.\n\n\"Hi there! The Fruit Roll Ups Fixer! We've got a real mess on our hands.\"\n\n\"I'm here, Mrs. Tingley. Show me the way to the site.\"\n\n\"Well, the accident happened at the Fruit Roll Ups conveyor belt. We've got a kid, about 9 years old, hurt pretty badly. A big chunk of Fruit Roll Up got lodged in his mouth.\"\n\nI followed Mrs. Tingley to the conveyor belt where I saw the little boy lying on the floor.

It was stuck pretty tight, and it came with a piece of his tooth.\n\n\"We should give him an antibiotic shot to prevent infection,\" I said. \"But first, I need to call the Fruit Roll Ups Fixer's Union to report this accident. There must be a policy against Fruit Roll Ups eating accidents.\"\n\n\"I don't know what we'll tell the parents,\" Mrs. Tingley said. \"They were all pretty upset about the accident already.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it will be fine,\" I said. \"We'll give them an update on the boy's health. And maybe we can give them a few free Fruit Roll Ups to make up for it.\"\n\n\"We'll have to discuss that,\" Mrs. Tingley said. \"It depends on what the parents decide.\"\n\n\"I'll take care of it,\" I said. \"It's part of my job.\"\n\n\"We'll let the parents take their kid home for the day,\" Mrs. Tingley said. \"And then he can come back tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Perfect,\" I said. \"And I'll talk to the parents about the free Fruit Roll Ups.\"\n\n\"Oh, and thank you for coming so quickly,\" Mrs. Tingley said.\n\n\"Yes, you're welcome,\" I said. \"Let's go talk to the parents.\""

My daughter was a bit upset when she found out she was not allowed to come but I made it up to her by bringing her back an awesome new toy.\n\nMy wife and I set out on Friday afternoon and stopped at the campsite for the night before setting up our tent the next morning.  We were at a place that we had found online by searching message boards and forums where people were recommending camping spots that not many people knew about.  The place was called Raven's Peak and was nestled in a secluded valley surrounded by towering mountains.  The weather was cool and crisp and the views were amazing.\n\nThe hike in was moderately difficult and took about an hour to complete.  We had to navigate through dense woods but the trail was clear and easy to follow.  We made it to the top of the mountain and were rewarded with a beautiful view of the valley below.  We took our time to set up the tent and get settled.  I started a small fire and we enjoyed the peacefulness of the evening before heading off to bed.\n\nOver the next three days we hiked, explored, and enjoyed the peacefulness of the valley.  We even spotted a few deer and a few birds.  We had plenty of water and food to keep us going.  We hiked back out on Sunday afternoon and headed home.\n\nAfter a week of enjoying nature, I was ready to get back to civilization.  I was looking forward to a nice hot shower and a good meal.  As we drove back home, I noticed that the radio was acting strange.  I thought it was probably just a loose connection but when I turned off the engine to stop at a gas station, the radio went completely dead.  I wasn't concerned, I thought that it was just a loose connection that I needed to tighten.\n\nAs I filled the gas tank, I noticed that people were staring at us.  I figured that it was probably because of the out-of-state plates.  When we got back on the road, I turned on the engine and tried to get the radio working.  Nothing.  I turned off the engine and tried again.  Still nothing.  I tried using the phone to call my wife's sister and she didn't answer.  I thought that it was probably because she was in her garden and couldn't hear the phone.\n\nI turned on the GPS navigation and it was dead.  I turned off the car and looked at the GPS and it was dead.  I started to feel a bit worried.  I turned on the phone and tried to connect to the internet.  Nothing.  I looked in the back seat for my wife's phone and she wasn't there.  I called her name and she didn't answer.  I pulled over to the side of the road and got out.  She wasn't there.  I looked around and didn't see her anywhere.\n\nI started to feel a bit worried.  I had been looking forward to seeing my wife and daughter for the past three days.  I looked in the car and realized that I was alone.  I felt a bit of panic start to set in.\n\nI was lost.  The GPS and radio weren't working and my phone was dead.  I looked around and realized that I was in the middle of nowhere.  The road that I was on was just a dirt road and it looked like it hadn't been used in a while.  I was alone, with no phone and no GPS.  I had to find my way back home.\n\nI tried to remember any landmarks or signs that I saw during the trip.  I tried to remember any directions that I had taken.  I had to figure out how to get back home.  I started to walk down the road, looking for any signs of civilization.  I walked for a bit and saw nothing but trees and dirt.  I was starting to get worried.\n\nI kept walking and finally saw a small sign that said \"Raven's Peak - 5 miles\".  I knew that we had been there for the past three days so I was sure that I was heading in the right direction.  I kept walking and finally saw a sign that said \"Raven's Peak - 1 mile\".  I was getting close.  I walked for a bit more and finally saw the campsite.\n\nI ran to the tent and looked inside.  It was empty.  I looked around and realized that I was the only one there.  I was the only one who knew where we were.  I was the only one who knew where my wife and daughter were.\n\nI was alone.  I was lost.  I was without my wife and daughter.  I was without my phone and GPS.  I was without my radio.  I was without any connection to civilization.\n\nI was a man, lost in the wilderness with no way to get help.  I was a man, lost in the wilderness with no way to get help.  I was a man, lost in the wilderness with no way to get help.\n\nAs the sun began to set, I knew that I had to find shelter and start a fire.  I knew that I had to survive the night and figure out how to get back home.  I knew that I had to be strong and not give up.  I knew that I had to be brave and not give in to fear.\n\nAs I huddled in my tent, listening to the wind howl and the trees creak, I realized that I was alone.  I was alone with no phone and no GPS.  I was alone with no radio and no way to get help.  I was alone with no connection to civilization.\n\nBut I was not alone.  I was not alone with no way to get help.  I was not alone with no connection to civilization.  I was with my wife and daughter.  I was with my wife and daughter who were in the same position that I was.\n\nI was with my wife and daughter who were also lost and alone.  I was with my wife and daughter who were also without phone and GPS.  I was with my wife and daughter who were also without radio and no way to get help.  I was with my wife and daughter who were also without any connection to civilization.\n\nBut we were together.  We were together in the wilderness with no way to get help.  We were together in the wilderness with no connection to civilization.  We were together in the wilderness with no phone and no GPS.  We were together in the wilderness with no radio and no way to get help.\n\nWe were together and I knew that we would survive.  We would survive the night and figure out how to get back home.  We would be brave and strong and not give up.  We would be brave and strong and not give in to fear.\n\nAs the sun went down, I huddled in the tent with my wife and daughter.  We were together and I knew that we would survive.  We would survive the night and figure out how to get back home.  We would be brave and strong and not give up.\n\nBut as the night went on,"

She was always on the move.\n\nIt was the only way to stay safe. She knew the world was always watching. Always waiting. And she knew they would never let her be. Not really. Not ever.\n\nShe had to keep moving. Always. Or she was dead.\n\nSo she wore the cloak and had the pack on her back. And she moved. Always. \n\nAnd she had the knife. She had to have it. It was her only protection. Her only defense. And she always had it. Always.\n\nShe stopped at the edge of the woods because she had a message to deliver. She had to tell the other. She had to warn them.\n\n\"Are you sure?\" he asked. He was always cautious. Always. And he had every right to be.\n\n\"I'm sure,\" she said. \"I have to tell them. They have to know.\" \n\n\"It's not safe,\" he said. \"It's not safe for you.\" \n\n\"I know,\" she said. \"I know it's not safe. That's why I have to do it. I have to warn them.\" \n\nHe nodded. She knew he would. She knew he understood. He always did. Always. \n\nAnd so she continued on her way. She had to tell the other. Had to warn them. She had to make sure they were prepared. And so she went on. Always. Always. Always. \n\nAnd she knew she could not be seen. She knew she could not be caught. She had to make sure she was not seen. She had to make sure she was not caught.\n\nSo she moved quietly. So she moved quickly. She knew she had to move. Had to get out of there. Had to get away. Had to stay safe.\n\nAnd so she moved. She moved quietly. And she was fast. She was always fast. Always. Always.\n\nAnd she reached the edge of the woods and stopped. She looked around. She looked at the trees. She looked at the ground. She looked at the sky.\n\nAnd then she saw it. A clearing. A place where she could safely stop. And be safe. She knew it was safe. She could feel it.\n\nAnd so she stopped. She took off her pack and the cloak. She leaned against a tree and took a deep breath. She was safe. She was safe here. She knew she was safe here. And she took another deep breath.\n\nShe looked down at the ground. Saw the trees. And saw the sky. It was beautiful. It was breathtaking. And she felt safe. She knew she was safe. She knew it was safe here. And she took another deep breath.\n\nAnd then she saw something. Something she had not seen before. Something she had not expected to see.\n\nAnd she looked closer. She looked closer. And she realized it was a door. A door in the tree. She had not seen a door before. Not like this one. She knew it was a door. She could tell it was a door.\n\nAnd she knew she had to go through it. She knew she had to go through the door. She knew it was her duty.\n\nAnd so she reached out. She reached out with her hand. And touched the door. It felt warm. It felt real. And she knew she had to touch it. She knew she had to open it.\n\nAnd so she did. She pushed the door. And it opened. It opened with a creak. And she saw a room. A room inside the tree. A room she had not seen before. And she knew she had to go in.\n\nAnd so she did. She went inside. She looked around. And she saw a figure. A figure standing in the corner. A figure who was watching her.\n\nAnd she knew who it was. She knew who it was. And she knew she had to warn them. She knew she had to tell them. \n\n\"Hello,\" he said. He was watching her. And she knew he was watching her. \n\n\"Hello,\" she said. \n\n\"You're very cautious,\" he said. \n\n\"I have to be,\" she said. \n\n\"Why?\" he asked. \n\n\"I have to stay safe,\" she said. \"I have to stay safe. I have to stay hidden. I have to stay alive.\" \n\n\"Why?\" he asked. \n\nShe knew he was asking. She knew he was asking about her. About her life. And she knew she could not answer. She knew she could not tell him. She knew it was not safe. \n\n\"I can't tell you,\" she said. \n\n\"Why not?\" he asked. \n\nShe shook her head. She could not tell him. She knew it was not safe. And she knew it was not her duty. She knew she could not tell him. \n\n\"I have to go,\" she said. \n\nShe turned around. She turned around and walked away. She turned around and walked away from the door. From the room. From the tree. From the creature.\n\nAnd she left. She left and did not look back. She left and did not look back again. She left and did not look back. Ever.\n\nAnd she knew she had to be careful. She knew she had to be safe. She knew she had to stay hidden. She knew she had to stay alive. And so she did. She was always careful. Always safe. Always hidden. And always alive."
