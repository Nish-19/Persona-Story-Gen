        "pred_story": "\u201cWhy are you giving my newborn baby a dagger?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell they\u2019re a chosen one, which means that I\u2019m destined to be killed by them; but honestly I\u2019ve been waiting centuries for them to be born and I just want to get it over with.\u201d\n\nMy wife stares at me with a look of shock and disgust as I hand the baby a dagger. It has a wooden handle wrapped in red leather straps. It\u2019s an awkward looking dagger, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m just tired. We\u2019ve been waiting for the birth of this baby for a long time and I\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019ve been waiting so long that I\u2019m now just a shell of my former self. The only thing keeping me going is knowing that the birth of this baby means that my curse will finally be broken.\n\n\u201cWhy do you need me to stab this baby?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m tired of living and I\u2019m tired of waiting. I\u2019m tired of being a servant to this curse. I just want it to end. And the only way that it can end is with my death. If I\u2019m not around then the curse won\u2019t continue.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you talking to me? Why not the baby\u2019s parents?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause they\u2019ll never believe me. I\u2019m just a servant to this family for the last two hundred years and they don\u2019t know anything about this curse. But you\u2019re different. You\u2019re a stranger. You don\u2019t care about me or this curse. You just care about your baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is crazy. Why don\u2019t you just die? I\u2019m sure you can just walk off a cliff or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause that\u2019s not how it works. I can\u2019t just die. I\u2019m bound to this family. If I die then the curse will just go back to the next family member. I\u2019ve been trying to find a way out of it for centuries, but nothing has worked. I\u2019ve been talking to the next few servants and they\u2019re all the same. They\u2019re all tired. They all want out.\u201d\n\nMy wife looks at me with tears in her eyes. She can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m talking about a baby being stabbed by a stranger. This is something out of a horror movie. But I don\u2019t care. If this is what it takes to end this curse then I\u2019m willing to do it. I\u2019m just tired. I\u2019m tired of this curse. I\u2019m tired of waiting. I\u2019m tired of being bound to this family. I just want out.\n\n\u201cThen why are you giving my baby a dagger? Why are you letting me be a part of this?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I need a hand. I need someone to help me with this. I\u2019m just too tired to do it myself. But I know that you\u2019ll never do it. I know that you love this baby too much to let it die. And that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t want you to do it either. I just want someone to be the one to do it. Someone to end this curse once and for all.\u201d\n\nI hand her the dagger and she stares at it in her hand. She\u2019s not sure what to do. She\u2019s not sure if she wants to be a part of this. But she\u2019s my wife and she knows that I\u2019m not lying. She knows that I\u2019m tired. She knows that this is what I need.\n\n\u201cAre you sure? Are you sure that this is what you want? Are you sure that you don\u2019t want to try to find a way out?\u201d\n\nI sigh and look at her with tears in my eyes. I\u2019m not sure. I really don\u2019t know if this is what I want. I just know that I\u2019m tired. I just know that I want out. I know that she loves me, but I also know that she\u2019s scared. She\u2019s scared of losing me. But I know that she\u2019ll never lose me. I know that this is my time. My time to die. My time to end this curse. I just know that it\u2019s time for me to go. But I know that I\u2019m not ready to go. I\u2019m not ready to die."

        "pred_story": "I was walking to work when I saw them. They were standing in front of the cafe that I was going to grab a coffee at. Normally, I would walk past them and ignore them but my curiosity got the better of me and I went inside. The barista looked up at me and I asked what kind of coffee they had. \"Your usual?\" she replied. I nodded and she started making me a latte. She didn't usually make my coffee that early, but that was because I was the last one to start work so she never got a chance to make it. \n\nAs I was waiting for my drink, I looked at the woman again. She was wearing some kind of military uniform and had earpieces in her ear. She looked out of place but it was a quiet morning so she hadn't stood out that much. The barista handed me my latte and I asked her if the woman had come in for anything. She looked like she was about to say something when the woman suddenly strode in and walked over to us. \"Ma'am, I'm not sure if you remember me, but we met before. I was with the government and you were part of a program that was about to be terminated.\" She looked out of place standing in the cafe, but she didn't seem to care about what the other patrons were thinking.\n\nI didn't recognize her and I looked at the barista to see if she was in on the joke. She was staring at the woman with an expressionless face and I realized that she must have been a time traveller like the woman. \"I don't know what you're talking about. My name is Emily and I work here.\" The woman scoffed at that and she pointed a finger at me. \"I know that you are Emily. If you don't remember me, that's not my problem. My job is to get you to cancel your job for the day and go home. If you don't do that, you will be terminated.\" She had a firm stance as she spoke, but she had a hint of a smile on her face. It was clear that she was joking and the barista was in on it.\n\nThe barista was holding a mop and was looking at her with an expressionless face. She had to be in on it because there was no other reason for her to hold a mop in the middle of the cafe. It was a normal day and the only people in the cafe were the barista, the woman, and me. I looked at the woman again and decided to play along. \"Terminated, you say? What do I need to do to be terminated?\" She frowned at that. \"I don't have time to mess around. You need to stop what you're doing today and go home. You can't do anything important or else we risk everything being terminated. I'm not going to explain it again, so I would appreciate it if you would just do what I'm saying.\" She seemed to be serious again, but she was smiling.\n\nI laughed at that. \"So, you're saying that everything we've ever done is going to be terminated?\" She sighed at that. \"Look, we've been over this before. I don't have time to explain it to you again. Just go home and we'll take care of the rest.\" I took another sip of my coffee and looked around at the barista. She was still holding the mop and didn't seem to be doing anything. She also had her phone out and was typing something. I looked back at the woman and shook my head. \"I need a day off to watch the game with my family. I'm not going to risk messing up the game for the season.\" She was getting frustrated now. \"Look, we've been over this before. I don't have time to explain it to you again. Just go home and we'll take care of the rest.\"\n\nI got up and grabbed my bag and left the cafe. I could hear her sighing behind me. I couldn't help but laugh at her. She was so out of place standing in the cafe, dressed in her military uniform and standing on top of the coffee table. She didn't seem to care, though. She was too focused on getting me to do what she was saying. I got to work and headed to my office. I didn't see her again until I got back home and she was standing on my front steps with a look of concern on her face. \"Look, I understand that you need time with your family. However, I'm here to tell you that you need to be somewhere else today. You can't be there.\" I looked at her again. I had seen her before, but I didn't know what she was doing here. \n\n\"I know that you're a time traveller, but why are you telling me to go home?\" She sighed at that. \"Look, I'm going to level with you. I'm here to stop something from happening today. It's something that will change everything and if you're there, it will all be ruined.\" I looked at her with a confused expression. \"What are you talking about? Nothing bad ever happens here. The government is watching over us and everything is fine. Why are you saying that?\" She frowned at that. \n\n\"Look, the government doesn't exist like you think it does. They've been lying to you for years. The world is constantly at risk of being destroyed and if we don't do something to stop it, we'll all be wiped out. We can't do anything to stop it until you go back home. I'm not going to explain it to you again, so just go home.\" I looked at her again. I didn't understand what she was talking about. I didn't believe her, but I didn't have a reason not to. I nodded and headed inside.\n\nI walked around the house, trying to find something to do. I decided to make some breakfast and started cracking eggs into a bowl. As I was whisking them together, I heard her voice in my head. \"Are you done yet? I still need to stop something from happening.\" I didn't hear her voice coming from my ear and didn't hear anything else. I walked around the house again and looked for her. \n\nI didn't see her anywhere but heard her again. \"I'm still here. Don't think that you can get rid of me that easily.\" I walked around the house and tried to find her again. I didn't see her, but I heard her again. \"I'm still here. I'm going to be here for a while, so you might as well make yourself comfortable.\" I looked at my watch and saw that it was still morning. I couldn't believe her. \"You're saying that the apocalypse is going to happen today? I don't believe you. I'm not going to go home.\" She sighed again and I heard her again. \"You're not listening to me. If you're not here, then you won't be there when it happens. You'll be alive and we'll be able to fix the timeline.\" I looked around the house again and saw that she was gone. \n\nI heard her again. \"I'm still here. I know that you can hear me, even if you're not"

You keep going until you drop dead, because innocent people die screaming if you don't.\" He was screaming and pointing at the kids in the room, but they didn't get it. I didn't get it. He was a weird, mean man in a suit, but none of us really understood what he meant. Or maybe we did, but I was too young to realize it.\n\nI had a lot of questions about that night, but the answer was the same. \"Too bad.\" \"You don't get to retire.\" \"You just keep going.\" It was a lesson I'd learn over and over again throughout my life, but I'd never quite understand it.\n\nEven now, lying here in the hospital bed, the man's words keep playing in my mind. \"You don't get to retire. You just keep going.\"\n\nIt's strange, because when most people retire, they're done. They spend their days reading books, playing cards, and taking naps. They're free from the stress and pressure of their old jobs, but they're still alive. They still get to go home, sleep in their own bed, and hug their family. But I'm not going to do any of that.\n\nThe infection has spread. I'm going to die tonight, or tomorrow, or the day after that. But the man was right. There's a life after death. There's a way to continue on, even when our bodies no longer work. There's a way to keep going, no matter what.\n\nThe nurse is here. \"How are you feeling?\" she asks, but I just shake my head. There's no answer to that. \"Are you in pain?\" I shake my head again. \"Are you cold? Do you need a blanket?\" I shake my head a third time. \n\nThe nurse sighs. \"Okay, well, let's get some rest. Sleep well, and try to go peacefully.\" I smile, but she doesn't understand. I'm not going to die, not really. I'm just going to leave this place, to step into something new and wonderful."

But we need you to help us.\"\n\nColonel Pierce smiled. \"What makes you think I'd be interested in something like that?\"\n\nThe general smiled back. \"Because you're a stupid man with a short attention span, and you'd much rather be dead than boring,\" he said. \"So, how about it? Will you help us?\"\n\nColonel Pierce shrugged. \"What do I have to do?\" he asked.\n\n\"Go to a place called Arcturus 5,\" said the general. \"You will arrive there in six months. When you arrive, you will ask them to come to a place called Jupiter 8. They will accept. And you will deliver the message.\"\n\n\"Jupiter 8,\" he said. \"What is that?\"\n\nThe general sighed. \"What's the matter with you?\" he asked. \"You're a colonel, and you don't know where Jupiter is?\"\n\n\"Jupiter 8 is Jupiter 7's new moon,\" said the general. \"We just named it. You will tell the people of Arcturus 5 that we need their scientists.\"\n\n\"They will accept,\" said the general. \"They are a peaceful people. When they arrive on Jupiter 8, you will tell them to go to their ship and turn their engines off.\"\n\nThe general nodded. \"Then you will turn your engines off, and you will let us know how it goes.\"\n\n\"Arcturus 5,\" he said. \"I never heard of such a place. Are they a civilized people?\"\n\n\"They're a civilization of scientists,\" said the general. \"But they've been having a lot of conflicts with other alien civilizations. They can't fight a war anymore. They've been using their technology to fight, but it's been causing too many deaths. They're starting to use other methods to kill each other. We have to stop it before it's too late.\"\n\nColonel Pierce shook his head. \"You're right,\" he said. \"We have to do something about it.\"\n\nThe general smiled. \"And it will be fun to watch them fight.\""

        "pred_story": "\"Uh, Boss? What do we do now that we've beaten the Hero?\"\n\nThe leader of our army, the Dark Lord Xarxos, turned his attention towards me. For a moment, I wondered if he'd been cursed like everyone else on our side. He could just be a mindless husk, a shell of a man with no free will. Instead, he stared at me for a few seconds.\n\n\"Is that question rhetorical, General?\"\n\nI looked to my second-in-command. He gave me a brief nod.\n\n\"I assume it is. After all, the Dark Lord's plan worked. The hero fell, the land is secure, the people are enslaved, and you are now the Dark Lord.\"\n\nHe chuckled. His eyes glinted in the dim light of the room.\n\n\"Actually, my old friend,\" he said, \"you are the Dark Lord now. I've... retired.\"\n\nI could only stare at him, unsure if the man had gone mad. He'd always been a ruthless leader, but never a madman.\n\n\"You're just going to retire? You've been planning this for years. We've all been preparing for years.\"\n\nHe smiled again. This time, it was more bitter. \"That's the problem. You see, I'm not in my prime anymore. I'm not as strong. I need someone young, strong, and capable enough to do my work for me. You're that man.\"\n\nIt was too much to take in. \"I... You can't be serious. I'm your general, your second-in-command. What makes you think I'll be your Dark Lord?\"\n\nHis expression turned serious. His eyes lost their glint. \"You've always been loyal to me, despite your misgivings. You've fought for me when your heart wasn't in it. If anyone can be my Dark Lord, it's you.\"\n\n\"I... I don't know, Lord Xarxos. I don't think I can fill your shoes.\"\n\nHe sighed. \"I'm not asking you to fill my shoes, General. I'm asking you to be me.\"\n\nI stared at him, unsure of what to do. \"How?\" I asked. \"How can I be you?\"\n\nHe smiled again, his bitter one.\n\n\"First, drop the title. Call yourself the Dark Lord. Second, you've always known where I wanted to expand my empire. You've always known where to fight and where to retreat. You'll use that knowledge to expand our empire.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"I... I need to think about this.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"I understand. Take all the time you need. I'll be here when you're ready to accept the mantle.\"\n\nI turned and walked away, leaving him alone. I couldn't believe what he said. I couldn't believe what I was considering.\n\nBut it was my duty to my kingdom to follow orders, even if the man giving them was a madman. I had to consider what he said. I had to consider what he offered.\n\nSo I left the room, wondering what the future might hold. The hero had fallen, and now our world was at my mercy. I would have to be more careful, to be more strategic, but I could do it.\n\nIf I wanted to."

The only question is: What is \"The Sun\"?\tLength: 1120 words<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
        "pred_story": "**I**\n\n\"Man, I'm glad we're on the other side of the continent. This is one hell of a party.\" I said, sipping on a beer as I looked out over the crowded, yet still spacious, rooftop where our party was being held. The view was incredible, a sea of lights stretching out as far as the eye could see.\n\nMy friend rolled his eyes, taking a drink from his own beer. \"You're not getting off that easy. What do you think happened to the sun?\"\n\n\"I told you, it's in a black hole. Probably was sent there by aliens to punish humanity for burning fossil fuels.\" I said, trying to deflect the question.\n\nMy friend scoffed. \"Come on, you're not really buying into that whole 'it's in a black hole' thing, are you? I'm sure you've been reading the rumors.\"\n\n\"I told you, I'm not reading any rumors, I'm reading the truth. There are a lot of crazy things going on in the world that don't make sense, but a black hole is a scientific possibility.\"\n\n\"You're just saying that to make me feel better, but I think we both know the truth. The government knows the truth, but they're not telling us. There are people who know the truth, and they're not telling us either.\"\n\nI sighed, letting the beer slide down my throat as I looked over the crowd of people dancing, singing, and laughing. There were a lot of weird things going on, but I hadn't seen any reason to believe that the world had ended or anything like that.\n\n\"You're paranoid, my friend. There's no way the government wouldn't know if the sun had suddenly vanished.\"\n\n\"Yet we don't see it. Why's that? There are cameras everywhere, both satellite and on the ground, yet there's not even a hint of what happened to the sun.\"\n\nI frowned. It was a good point, but I didn't see what it had to do with anything. It didn't matter what the government knew or didn't know.\n\n\"Maybe it has something to do with the government's new satellite system,\" I offered, but my friend shook his head.\n\n\"I don't think so. The satellites are still there. The only reason we can't see the sun is because it's not there. And I'm positive that if something catastrophic had happened, we'd still see the sun, even if it was no longer orbiting. There's only one explanation.\"\n\nI sighed. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"The sun is no longer in the sky because it is no longer there.\"\n\n**II**\n\nI sighed, staring at the graffiti on my wall as my friend left. That was the third time he had shown up in the last week, each time he had come to tell me about the message. At first I had thought that he was just messing with me, but he had been very serious when he told me that the message was on the walls of every house in the country, even on the other side of the continent.\n\nI walked over to the window, pulling back the curtain as I looked out into the night. It was dark. I glanced up at the sky, but there were no stars. I wasn't sure how long it had been since the sun had vanished, or what exactly that meant.\n\nThe air felt warm, but when I touched the glass I realized that it was cool to the touch. I stared up into the sky, wondering where the sun was, wondering why it had vanished, but mostly wondering why it had been so quiet. There were so many questions that I couldn't answer, and I found myself feeling a little scared.\n\nI looked back at my wall, seeing the graffiti in a new light. It had been there for months now, and no one seemed to know what it meant. I was starting to feel like I was the only one who didn't know, but now I was starting to wonder if that was true.\n\nI closed the curtain, leaving my room as I made my way out into the night. I felt a little scared, but I couldn't just sit around. I needed to know what happened to the sun, and why.\n\nI walked through the empty streets, the silence deafening. I wondered how long it would be before the world came back to life, but I wondered if it would ever come back to life. I saw a couple other people walking, and wondered if they knew what was going on. I wondered if they had seen the message, or if they knew that the sun had vanished.\n\nI sighed, glancing over at a house with a glowing window. That had to be someone's home. I walked over to the house, pressing the button by the door. Footsteps echoed from the other side of the door, followed by a click. I pushed the door open, looking inside.\n\nIt was dark, the only light coming from the glow of an emergency flashlight. I blinked at the light as I looked around, seeing a woman standing in the middle of the room, holding the flashlight. She was dressed in a simple white robe, her eyes wide with fear.\n\n\"Who are you?\" She asked, pointing the light into my eyes.\n\nI winced, moving away from the light. \"I'm just a person,\" I said, looking at her. \"I was walking through the street and saw your light. I just wanted to talk to someone.\"\n\nShe nodded, moving forward as she put the flashlight down on a table. \"I'm glad you're here,\" she said, glancing around her room before focusing back on me. \"I've been here for days, waiting for someone to show up. It's been too long since I've spoken to another person.\"\n\nI nodded, walking over to the table. \"What's your name?\"\n\n\"My name is Sarah,\" she said, smiling slightly as she held out her hand.\n\nI took her hand, shaking it as I glanced down at the table. There was a note on the table, the same message that I had seen on my wall.\n\n**III**\n\n\"You're the only one who hasn't seen the message,\" Sarah said, her eyes still wide with fear.\n\nI looked up at her, seeing a strange look in her eyes. \"Do you know what it means?\" I asked.\n\nShe shook her head, letting out a breath. \"I thought I did,\" she said, glancing down at the table again. \"But now I'm not so sure.\"\n\nI looked at the note, wondering what could have caused this. It couldn't be a prank, not with how widespread the message was. I looked at Sarah, seeing the fear still in her eyes, and realized that she knew something.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\n\nShe sighed, sitting down on a chair. \"I mean, when I read the message, I thought it was an accident. A mistake. I thought the government knew, and they just didn't tell us.\"\n\nI nodded, sitting down across from her.\n\n\"But now I'm not so sure,\" she said, shaking her head. \"The sun was here for years, decades, centuries. It was the center of our world, our lives, and suddenly it's gone. Where did it go?\"\n\nI shrugged, staring at the message on the table. \"There's no way to know.\"\n\n"

        "pred_story": "I've been in this coma for too long. Too long. No one comes to see me. Too long. I've lost my will to live. Too long.\n\nAnd then, in a flash of light, I see them. I see death and I see life. They're arguing. I hear them.\n\n\"Life!\" I call out.\n\n\"I am here.\" Life says.\n\n\"Look at him! Look at what you've done to him. His body is weak, his mind is dull, his will is broken. You have drained him. His energy is spent. He is no more.\"\n\nLife scoffs. \"That is not true. He is simply in a state of dormancy. He is waiting for me, waiting for his next journey. It is his time, and he is eager.\"\n\n\"He has been in this state for far too long. I should let him go.\"\n\nI think for a moment. \"No. You two seem like you could use each other.

He's been busy for years now, running around making sure people die. I'm pretty sure he's not doing very well.\"\n\nDeath smirks. \"Oh? Well, Life has been doing an awful lot of living, if you know what I mean. He's been getting a lot of attention lately. I'm not sure he even remembers me.\"\n\n\"Oh, I think he does. I'm pretty sure he remembers you as the grim reaper, with all those little skeletons and bats around you. He's still pretty afraid of you.\"\n\nDeath scoffs. \"Afraid of me? Oh, Life is just scared of me. It's a good thing, he's scared of me. He doesn't know what to do.\"\n\n\"Oh, but Death, you're wrong. Life is not afraid of you. He's just not interested in you. He's found someone else. Someone who's much more interesting than you.\"\n\nDeath narrows his eyes. \"Who?\"\n\n\"Oh, someone named Nemo. He's a very interesting person, but I'm not sure he'd be interested in you. Not after he saw all the skeletons and bats around you, that is.\"\n\nDeath sighs. \"Oh well, I'm sure I'll find someone else soon enough. But right now, Life, I think it's your turn.\"\n\nLife laughs. \"Oh, I think it is. I'm not quite ready to go yet. Not while I'm having such fun here.\"\n\n\"Fun?\" Death laughs. \"Life, you're in a coma. This is not fun. Not even a little bit.\"\n\n\"Oh, I disagree. I'm having the best time here. I'm talking to Life. He's a funny fellow.\"\n\nI laugh. \"Oh, Death, you should see yourself. You're so uptight, so serious. I'm pretty sure you'd kill someone with your seriousness.\"\n\nDeath rolls his eyes. \"Kill someone? No, I don't kill people. I only take them when it's their time to die.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure you don't. You may not be carrying a scythe, but I'm sure it's hidden somewhere on your person.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is. But I'm sure it won't be needed anytime soon. Not while I'm dealing with Life here.\"\n\nI sit up, slowly, painfully, and hold out my arms. \"Come on, both of you. Why not just hold hands and be together? It'll be fun, I promise you that.\"\n\nLife smiles, and Death looks at him with a sad expression. \"I've never really thought about it before. I've always thought of you as just a source of energy. But I have to admit, I'm intrigued.\"\n\nDeath sighs. \"I'm sure you'll be sorry once I'm gone. But I have to do my job, don't I?\"\n\n\"Of course you do. But I'll be here for you whenever you need me. And besides, I'm sure Nemo will be waiting for you when the time comes. He loves you, you know.\"\n\nDeath blushes. \"Oh? Oh, he does?\"\n\n\"Yes, he does. So come on, Death. Let's get started. You never know when the time will come. And besides, I'm sure I'll be here to help you whenever I can.\"\n\nDeath smiles, and reaches out to Life. \"Alright. I'll do it. I'll stay.\"\n\nLife's smile grows. \"That would be wonderful. Thank you, Death.\"\n\nI sit back, sigh, and look at the two of them. \"You two are lucky. Most people would want to be with me, but you two are better off without me. I'm lucky to have you two.\"\n\nDeath looks at me with a sympathetic expression. \"Oh, don't say that. We need each other. And we'll need you, too, eventually.\"\n\nI smile. \"I know. But for now, I'll just enjoy watching you two together. I'm sure it'll be fun.\"\n\nLife takes Death's hand in his, and they smile at each other. \"It will be fun,\" they say.\n\nDeath looks down at Life, and sighs. \"Yes, it will be fun. But Death never forgets, Life.\"\n\nLife smiles up at Death. \"I never forget, either.\"\n\nThe two of them are still holding hands, smiling at each other. I sigh, and fall back onto my pillow.\n\n\"Thank you for this, me. I'm going to miss you a lot, though.\"\n\nI smile. \"I'll always be with you. Goodbye, Death. Goodbye, Life.\"\n\nAnd I pass away."

There have been 12 since your predecessors and only 2 of them have succeeded.\u201d The figure stepped aside and as the light from a dark flame lit the dark chamber, I saw that it was a mirror. \u201cThe mirror has been here since before I was born. I don\u2019t know where it came from, but the others had to go through it to get in.\u201d I was so fixated on the mirror, I hadn\u2019t noticed the figure move to my side, but as I turned to look at it, a dark smudge on the mirror\u2019s surface became clear and I realized I was looking at my reflection. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you got out, though. You should be dead by now. That\u2019s how most people get in. The mirror looks into your heart, and if you\u2019re found wanting, you\u2019re dead.

If you\u2019re right about me, you\u2019ll know the truth, but don\u2019t get too excited.

That\u2019s where we come in.\u201d The figure stopped at a door with a sign that read \u201c1st floor\u201d and opened it. \u201cThe first of the seven tasks will be found down here.\u201d With that, they disappeared into the room.\n\nThe room had several corridors leading out of it and a stair case at the far end. I looked through each corridor and saw that they all ended in a sign with the number of the floor. I could hear a voice coming from the stairs, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to move around, stay off the stairs. They\u2019re very fragile. I don\u2019t want to have to replace them.\u201d The voice was coming from the floor above. I decided to start at the bottom of the stairs and move up to see what I would find, hoping to catch a glimpse of the figure.\n\nI was halfway up the stairs when a noise caught my attention. I stopped and listened, and soon after that, I heard a sigh of relief from below. I looked back and saw a puff of dark smoke in the shape of a person and it\u2019s head tilt back onto it\u2019s shoulders as the smoke drifted back into the room below. I heard a faint sound of sobbing and then the sounds of the dark figure moving around, putting things away and closing the door they had left by. I had to shake off the feeling of shock and grief that had come over me, I was now alone in this hell.\n\nI took a few deep breaths and continued up the stairs. I came out onto a floor with no windows, just an empty hall. The next floor was the same, then the next. On the fourth floor, I found a note. It was a long story, but I\u2019m not interested in reliving the memories I made there. I found a room on the fifth floor with no door, just a large stone pedestal in the center of it. On top of the pedestal was a small glass vial filled with a yellow liquid. At the bottom of the vial was a single grain of sand. I heard a voice, \u201cYou have one minute and 45 seconds, pick it up.\u201d I looked around and saw there was no one there, but as I turned to leave, I saw that I had already moved into the room and the door was behind me.\n\nI looked at the vial and was frozen. I knew that if I picked it up, time would slow down. I wasn\u2019t ready for that. I looked around the room again, but it was just empty. The voice came again, \u201cYou have 1 minute and 44 seconds.\u201d I looked at the vial again and knew what I had to do. I couldn\u2019t take it to the sixth floor if I was still there. I picked it up, and time slowed down. I was holding a grain of sand between my thumb and index finger. I let the vial go and it shattered on the floor, the grain of sand landing beside me. I was standing in a pit, surrounded by a high wall on all sides.\n\nI looked around and saw that I was back in the first floor room. The glass vial was now in my pocket, but it was empty. I looked at my feet and saw a small pile of sand had fallen from my pocket. The dark figure appeared from behind the mirror, \u201cYou\u2019ll need to find the next task on your own. Good luck.\u201d I thought they had left, but then I heard a voice behind me, \u201cDon\u2019t bother saying goodbye.\u201d I spun around, but there was no one there. The mirror was reflecting my image, but there was a faint smudge under it that showed someone had moved past it. I looked down and saw that the sand had vanished. I looked at my pocket and saw that the vial was back. I knew I had to find a new task, and I knew I had to do it quickly. I had already used up the time I had before the others, but they were still trying to find the first task.\n\nI heard the voice again, \u201cYou have 1 minute and 40 seconds.\u201d I looked around and saw a door that I hadn\u2019t noticed before. I looked at the figure, but it wasn\u2019t there. I went through the door and found myself back in the first floor room. I saw that it was now a large library, with rows of shelves that stretched up to the ceiling. I walked through the rows and saw that each shelf was covered in books. I couldn\u2019t know what I was looking for, but I knew that I had to find it. I had to find it before I ran out of time. I heard the voice again, \u201cYou have 1 minute and 39 seconds.\u201d\n\nI stopped and looked around. I saw that the books on the shelves were arranged alphabetically, and there was a bookshelf in the center of the room with no books on it. I walked over and saw that it was a mirror. I stepped back and looked at my reflection, I knew what I was looking for. I had to read all of the books in the library. I knew it was impossible, but I had to do it anyway. I took one of the books from the shelf next to the mirror and read it. I read it quickly, trying to find any important details. When I finished, I moved to the next shelf and read another book. I kept reading until the library was empty.\n\nI took a deep breath and then heard the voice again, \u201cYou have 1 minute and 38 seconds.\u201d I looked"

        "pred_story": "I know that the story of how I became a maid is one for the books, but I swear I didn\u2019t do anything so special. I was born into a family that were low-born enough that we didn\u2019t have the luxury of training any of our daughters in things like music or needlework, so I learned how to clean and cook from a very young age. And I didn\u2019t mind it! I was good at it, and it suited me fine to go from place to place, earning my keep by doing the simple tasks that nobody else wanted to do.\n\nSo when I landed on a position as the maid for the noblewoman Lady Margaret, it wasn\u2019t any grander than any of my other positions. In fact, it was probably one of the easier ones - Lady Margaret was a quiet girl who didn\u2019t require a lot of attention, so my job was mostly to take care of her clothes and keep her chambers tidy. And I enjoyed the quiet of it, the peace and the quiet that came with knowing what I had to do and being able to just focus on doing it.\n\nBut Lady Margaret was different from the other nobles I had worked with. For one, she was smart. I know that a lot of people say that nobles aren\u2019t very intelligent, but Lady Margaret was one of the smartest people I\u2019d ever met. She read a lot, and she was always eager to talk about what she had read, which was really interesting for a person like me. And she was nice too - she was never cruel, and she was always willing to help out if I needed it.\n\nBut she was also a little strange. Sometimes, she would go off and disappear into her own thoughts for hours at a time, and when I would ask her what was wrong, she would just tell me that everything was fine. And sometimes, she would say things that didn\u2019t make any sense - like that she was \u201con a quest\u201d or that her \u201cadventures\u201d would be coming up soon. I never thought too much of it, though. Lady Margaret was a private person, and I understood that I wasn\u2019t supposed to pry.\n\nSo when she came to me one day with the confession that she was a villain, I was totally taken aback. I had never heard of anyone like that before - I thought that all the nobles were either heroes or completely neutral, with no particular interest in helping anyone else out. But Lady Margaret said that wasn\u2019t true - that everyone was just living out their own character arc, and that some of them might have \u201cstats\u201d that would make them useful to others. And she said that she was one of the villainous characters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be killed, okay?\u201d she said. She was trembling, and I could see the tears in her eyes. \u201cI know they\u2019re going to do something bad to me, but I can\u2019t let them. I just can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked, though I think I already knew. \u201cYou\u2019re a noble lady, Margaret. You don\u2019t get to choose what happens to you.\u201d\n\nBut she just shook her head, looking away from me. \u201cI\u2019m telling you,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a villain. And they\u2019re going to make sure I get caught.\u201d\n\nI felt my heart sink as I realized what she was saying. She wasn\u2019t just a noble lady - she was a character in some sort of story, and she needed my help to avoid her fate. And I was scared, because I didn\u2019t know if I could help her."

        "pred_story": "The moonlight lit up her whole face. She looked just like her in the morning, only with more defined features that I could never quite get. I remember the first time I saw her, she walked up to me at a bar. I was in the bar with a few other travelers, drinking and swapping stories.\n\nShe was like one of them at first. But she stood out.\n\nHer ears were pointed, not big and fluffy like the ones in the stories. I was confused when I saw them, my mind struggled to reconcile what I saw.\n\nShe looked at me and smiled. I could tell she was trying to hide her accent.\n\n\u201cAre you alone?\u201d She asked, her eyes moving to the side.\n\nI was surprised. I looked at her again, this time really looking at her. The bar was dimly lit, but she was standing in the spotlight of the full moon. I could see every detail. I nodded, confused.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help but notice you\u2019re with a group of people. They seem like your kind. But they don\u2019t act like it. You do. You act like them. But you\u2019re not one of them. At least, I don\u2019t think you are.\u201d\n\nI was confused. This elf was right in front of me, but she was talking to me like she thought I was someone else. Like she thought I was a different person. I looked around the group. They were mostly humans, but there were a few dwarves and halflings.\n\nThe one she looked at was a human. A man. I watched as he tried to catch my eye. The rest just kept talking. I looked back at the elf. Her eyes met mine, she looked like she knew what I was thinking.\n\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s a man. My friend. He\u2019s nice. He\u2019s really into this sort of thing. This whole adventure thing. I\u2019ll show you. It\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\nShe was talking about the bar. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun. Come with me. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to do. She was a stranger, but she seemed nice. I was starting to feel really confused. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nWe left the group and walked to the bar. The elf walked with a bounce. She was fast. The bar had a door on the other side, which led into a room with tables. I followed her.\n\nInside, the music was louder, the bar was more crowded. There was a stage. It was empty, but I could tell someone was going to be up there soon. The elf grabbed my hand and pulled me towards the stage.\n\nThere was a small group of elves there. The music started, and they began to dance. The elf let go of my hand and moved closer to the stage. I followed her. She danced a few times, then she stopped and looked at me.\n\n\u201cDance. It\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\nI looked around. There were a few other humans dancing. Most of the patrons seemed to be elves. I looked back at the stage. The elves were singing. It was a nice song, but the lyrics were confusing. The elf saw my confusion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a language you\u2019d know. The lyrics are in the elf language. It\u2019s like a poem. It doesn\u2019t really make sense in your language.\u201d\n\nI looked back at the stage. The elves stopped singing, then they began to sing again. But they were singing a different song this time. I looked at the elf.\n\n\u201cDo you like it?\u201d\n\nShe was smiling. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a great song. One of my favorites.\u201d\n\nIt was my favorite song now. The elves were singing about something that I didn\u2019t understand. But the music and the dance made me happy. The elves were having fun. They were singing and dancing together. It was beautiful.\n\nThe song was over, and the elves started to clean up. I looked back at the elf. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\nShe smiled at me. \u201cI\u2019m Elthar. I\u2019ll be leaving in a few days. I\u2019m going to find my own place. I don\u2019t want to live with my parents anymore.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cOkay. It was nice meeting you, Elthar.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was nice meeting you too.\u201d She smiled at me again, then she walked away.\n\nI looked around the room. It was quiet now, most of the elves were gone. I looked at the door. The moon was still shining. I left the room and walked outside.\n\nElthar was standing there, leaning against a wall. \u201cHey. What are you doing? It\u2019s late.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nShe looked at me. \u201cNo need to apologize. It\u2019s not late, though. You can stay with me if you want. You can stay with me for a while.\u201d\n\nI looked at her. \u201cI\u2019d like to. Thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me. You can stay with me until you want to leave. Do you want to leave?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t want to leave. I didn\u2019t want to leave her. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Good. I\u2019m glad you like it here.\u201d\n\nI smiled at her. \u201cYeah. I like it here. What is it?\u201d She looked confused. I nodded to her house. \u201cI think that\u2019s a house.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. Yeah. It\u2019s my house. I\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like it.\u201d I looked at her. \u201cI don\u2019t have money.\u201d\n\nShe smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have money. Just stay with me.\u201d\n\nI looked at her again. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\n\nShe looked at me. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t want to mess this up.\u201d\n\nShe sighed. \u201cWhat do you want? Do you want to be with me?\u201d\n\nI looked at her. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Then I\u2019m happy. I don\u2019t want to mess this up either.\u201d\n\nShe smiled at me, and I smiled back.\n\nI had been with her for 5 years. She was still beautiful. I looked at her, and I smiled. She looked at me and smiled back.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cHey. What do you want?\u201d\n\nI looked at her. I wanted everything. \u201cI want everything.\u201d\n\nShe smiled again. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll get you everything. Everything?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nShe looked at me. \u201cWe can have everything. I don\u2019t care about the things. I just want you. I want to be with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to be with me too. I love you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you too.\u201d\n\nI smiled at her, and she smiled back.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s go for a walk.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nWe walked for a while. We didn\u2019t say much, but it was nice to have some time with her.\n\nEventually we walked to her house, and we sat down on the couch. I looked at her. \u201cHey, can I ask you something?\u201d\n\nShe looked at me. \u201cWhat do you want to ask?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow old are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, yeah. I\u2019m 499.

Where am I?\u201d\n\n\u201cEarth, 2423. Earth, 2423.\u201d\n\n\u201c2423? What are you talking about? That\u2019s, that\u2019s, I\u2019m from 1723.\u201d\n\n\u201c1723? Ha! That\u2019s cute. You can\u2019t even begin to comprehend what this world has become. You can\u2019t even begin to comprehend what you\u2019re witnessing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI...I...I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you do. I think you do. Do you remember your old job? The one you had, before you were sent here?\u201d\n\n\u201cSent here? Where am I? How did I get here?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, you want to play dumb. Fine. I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret. You\u2019ve been brought here because you\u2019re, what\u2019s the phrase I want to use, the \u2018catalyst\u2019? Yes, that\u2019s it. Your \u2018catalyst\u2019. You are the catalyst for the next great technological breakthrough. And, as you are now aware, you are the catalyst for a technological breakthrough that will lead to the downfall of humanity.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazy. What are you talking about? What technological breakthrough?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try to get up and leave, and you\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI refuse to leave, you have to let me go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t. You can\u2019t go home. You can\u2019t go home because the Earth, the Earth you know, does not exist anymore. The Earth is now a dystopian wasteland, a desolate, barren wasteland ruled by a tyrannical government that, as I mentioned, has been aware of you since your arrival.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what, exactly, does that have to do with me? I\u2019m just a simple man. I don\u2019t know what I could possibly do for a government.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, but you do. I\u2019m sure you do. You just don\u2019t realize it. Just like all of humanity, just like all of those that came before you, you never realized what you were doing until it was too late. And that\u2019s the problem. That\u2019s the problem. Humanity has never realized what it has been doing until it has been too late. Until it has been too late, until the damage has been done, until humanity was able to no longer reverse the damage, and until humanity was able to realize what it has done.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, man, I don\u2019t know what kind of crazy nonsense you\u2019re spouting, but I\u2019m not buying it. I don\u2019t want to die here. I don\u2019t want to be a part of some crazy technological breakthrough that\u2019s going to destroy the Earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. I don\u2019t. None of us do. But it\u2019s too late. We\u2019re too late. The damage has been done. It can\u2019t be reversed. We\u2019re past the point of no return.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? What damage?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try to leave?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should I?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the security system is watching. And when it sees you try to leave, it will respond to that. When it responds to that, I\u2019ll have to do what I do. I\u2019ll have to do what I always do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said \u2018the damage can\u2019t be reversed\u2019. What damage?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try to leave?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you hiding?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try to leave?\u201d\n\n\u201cStop saying that!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try to leave?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a madman.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try to leave?\u201d\n\n\u201cSTOP IT. STOP IT. STOP IT.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said it, didn\u2019t I? I said it. I said the damage can\u2019t be reversed. And I said it because it can\u2019t be.

        "pred_story": "I was sitting in the courtroom, clutching the ticket in my hand as the prosecutor, Mr. Deeks, was recounting the events of that fateful night. I had no memory of that night. All I knew was the details of the crime, a string of facts that I had read and memorized to aid in my defense. I had been to the stadium that night, I was certain of it, but I couldn't explain how I had gotten there or why I wasn't aware of the events that took place. \n\nMr. Deeks was getting agitated, he could see the jury was starting to believe that I wasn't involved in the crime, and I could see the satisfaction on Mr. Deeks' face. I couldn't believe how he could be so smug and arrogant, as if he was getting paid to make me look like an idiot. \n\nJust as the prosecutor was about to continue with his argument, Mr. Davenport rose to his feet, his eyes fixed intently on the prosecutor. \"Your Honor, I think we should take a recess so that I may speak with my client and review some evidence.\"\n\nI couldn't believe that Mr. Davenport was doing this, it seemed like he was playing into the prosecutors hands. The judge nodded in response, \"Very well, the court will be in recess until tomorrow morning. Mr. Davenport, you and your client have until then to review any evidence. You may call any witnesses that you deem necessary for the case to proceed.\" \n\nThe judge banged his gavel and the courtroom erupted in a flurry of activity. I was sitting there in silence, trying to process what had just happened. Mr. Davenport came over and sat next to me, \"Mr. Deeks has shown a video of you at a basketball game,\" he said, his voice low and serious. \"You may be the only person on the planet who can corroborate your alibi.\"\n\nHe held out the video in his hand, the image of the basketball game staring back at me. I couldn't explain what I was seeing, but I knew it was my hand on the ticket. I knew it was my body sitting in the row behind me, a look of awe on my face as I watched the game. \n\n\"I don't know how it works,\" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. \"How can I be in two places at once?\"\n\nMr. Davenport sighed, \"I don't know, Mr. Brown, but we will find out. Now, let us review the video and see if there is anything you can remember.\" \n\nHe put the video in a machine and pressed play. The video played, the sound of the crowd and the squeak of the basketball on the court filled the air. I watched as I moved in the row, the camera panning across the crowd. I saw myself stand up, turn my attention to the court, and smile as my team scored a point. I sat down, and the video continued. \n\nI saw the game end, the clock running out as the crowd cheered in excitement. The camera showed the final moments of the game, and the video ended. I was staring at the video in shock, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. \n\n\"I didn't do it,\" I said, my voice filled with emotion. \"I don't know how, but I'm innocent. I didn't kill anyone.\" \n\nI could see the look of confusion in Mr. Davenport's eyes, \"How did you know the victim?\" he asked. \"Where were you that night?\" \n\nI shook my head, \"I don't know. I have no memory of that night. All I remember is the details of the crime. I read them in a newspaper, and memorized them. I'm innocent, I'm certain of it.\" \n\nI stood up, \"I want a polygraph test. I want to prove my innocence, to prove that I didn't do it.\" \n\nMr. Davenport nodded, \"Very well. I will see to it. You may leave now, Mr. Brown. You may return tomorrow morning, and we will begin again.\" \n\nI walked out of the courtroom, a sense of relief and hope that I hadn't felt in months. I would be acquitted, I was certain of it. I would be a free man, and I could finally live my life without looking over my shoulder, wondering if the cops were going to knock on my door again."

The same face he had for the past four decades. He had long lost his youthful appearance. But at least the lines on his face were moving yesterday. They were deepening, as if reality had been chiseled into his face. They were alive. But today, not a single line had shifted. Yesterday was not real.\n\nThe man looked down at his hands. They had aged. The nails had been trimmed. And on his right hand, he wore a wedding ring. He did not remember the last time he wore a wedding ring. The ring was the same as the day before, with the same scratches. The same scratches he got while fixing the kitchen sink. A kitchen sink he did not remember fixing. But at least his hands had aged. Yesterday was real.\n\nHe picked up his phone, only to see that it was the same as yesterday. It had all the same apps he had yesterday. But then he saw it. The photo on his screen. The same photo he saw yesterday. It was a family photo. A photo he had never seen before. Yet it felt familiar. His wife was dead. But she was alive in the photo. And so were their three children. They were all smiling. He did not remember them smiling like that. But at least the photo was new. Yesterday was real.\n\nHe got up from his chair and walked to the window. The view was the same as yesterday. The same apartment building across the street. The same park on the other side. He could not see the park today. He could see the building across the street. The building that did not exist yesterday. Yesterday was real.\n\nBut the view of the park had been the same. The same trees. The same benches. The same lake that looked more like a puddle of water. He had sat on that bench yesterday. He remembered the cold breeze on his skin. He remembered the feeling of the wood on his backside. He remembered the crows. They were all gone today.\n\nHe could hear a knock on the door. It was the same knock as yesterday. It was a gentle knock. He walked to the door and opened it. It was the same woman as yesterday. She was the same woman he had seen every day for the last year. She had been talking to him every day. But today she was different. Today she was just as he had imagined her to be yesterday.\n\n\"I am convinced that yesterday was not real. It couldn\u2019t have been real.\"\n\nThe woman was staring at him. \"It's real, sir. It's all real. But it's also not real. I am afraid this is all just a simulation.\"\n\nThe old man did not say a word. He did not know what to say.

And yet, I found myself at the front of the city, a man walking amongst men, with the weight of history on my shoulders. \n\n\u201cFather,\u201d the young one called out, his voice shaking, and I wondered if he would have been braver to call me a traitor.\n\n\u201cNathaniel,\u201d I replied, the name feeling strange on my lips, and I fought against the wave of memories that threatened to drag me back.\n\n\u201cFather,\u201d he repeated, as if to make the truth known, and I could see the fear in the eyes of the others. Fear of what they would see, of what they would think, of what I might do.\n\nI stepped forward, my footsteps deliberate, and I allowed the memories to flood me, to wash over me, to take me under. I allowed them to take the armor of my current self, to strip away the cloak of my future, and to reveal me in my true form. \n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d I said, as I fell to my knees, \u201cI am not a hero. I am a man, an aging man, a man who has been changed by time. I am a man who has loved, who has lost, who has fought and won and lost. I am a man who knows what it means to die. And I tell you this, my people, because I must.\u201d\n\nI looked up, and my eyes met the eyes of the young one, and he looked at me with a face so much like his mother\u2019s, so much like the mother I had lost. \n\nI reached out a hand, and he took it, and I pulled him down beside me, and we sat in silence for a long moment. \n\n\u201cYou have asked for my story,\u201d I said, my voice barely above a whisper, \u201cand I have given you a story of a man who saved his people. But that is not the whole of my story. My story is of a man who was a hero, a man who was made a hero, a man who was forced to choose between his people and his heart. My story is of a man who chose to betray his people, to betray the trust they had placed in him, to betray the queen who had called him to greatness. And my story is of a man who found peace in that betrayal.\u201d\n\nI pulled the cloak around me again, and I stood, and I turned, and I walked away, and I did not look back.\n\n\u201cFather,\u201d he called out, the young one, and I stopped.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\nHe stepped forward, and he looked at me with his eyes so much like his mother\u2019s, and I saw the weight of my choice, the weight of his choice. And I knew that he would choose the same way, that he would follow me into the darkness, into the peace that I had found. \n\n\u201cI am glad,\u201d I said, \u201cthat you understand.\u201d\n\nI smiled, and I stepped forward, and I took him by the shoulder, and I pushed him gently, and I said, \u201cGo home, Nathaniel. Go back to your mother. Tell her the truth, and tell her I said to stop mourning me.\u201d\n\nAnd then I turned, and I walked away, and I did not look back, and I found my peace."

        "pred_story": "\"Did you really think you have the advantage with a sword, did you assume that smart dragons wouldn't make something infinitely better than a sword?\"\n\nasked the dragon as he racked his shotgun.\n\n\"We have come to bring you to the queen,\" said the knight in a gruff voice.  \"It is an honor to be in your presence, I am afraid I am unable to stay for long.\"\n\n\"Ah, you think this little sword of yours will get you to her, do you?  I have been around for centuries, it is but a child to me.\"\n\n\"Sir, there is a reason your kind has a fear of fire and death,\" said the knight as he tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword.\n\nThe dragon laughed and puffed out a plume of fire.  It shot out like a jet from his mouth and scorched the ground the knight stood on.  The knight leaped to his left as the fire burned away part of the ground where he had been standing.\n\nThe knight then drew his bow and shot one of the arrows made of ice into the dragon's mouth, freezing part of it shut.  The dragon growled and then pulled a shotgun out from behind his back.\n\nThe knight shot a few more arrows and then turned to the dragon with his sword.  \"I am afraid that was your last arrow, I have to end this quickly or she will return to her lair.\"\n\n\"I've got a few more tricks up my sleeve, just watch!\" said the dragon.  He opened his jaws and shot the ice arrow back to the knight, then he threw the shotgun over at the knight.  The knight tried to catch the shotgun but it was tossed too quickly and it bounced off his shoulder.  The dragon then threw a baseball bat at the knight, but the knight dodged it with ease.\n\nThe knight then fired one last ice arrow and shot it into the dragon's mouth, freezing it shut.  The dragon then tried to shake the ice arrow out of his mouth, but it caused his head to spin around.  The knight took that opportunity to strike the dragon down with his sword.\n\nThe dragon then fell to the ground and the knight stood over him, then the knight heard a loud noise behind him and turned around.  There were many more dragons coming towards him.  The dragon that he killed earlier then got up from the ground and started laughing.\n\n\"You really should've killed me when you had the chance,\" he said.  He then looked at the knight and saw him holding the sword, then he looked at the shotgun on the ground.\n\n\"Huh, you think you can take all of us out with that little sword?  You are a fool if you do, I will show you what our true power is,\" said the dragon as he flew above the other dragons.\n\nThe knight then pulled out a grenade from his belt and threw it at the other dragons.  The grenade went off and killed most of them.  The knight then pulled out a fire extinguisher and sprayed the fire out of the others.  The knight then picked up the shotgun and pulled the trigger and hit every dragon that was left.\n\nThe knight then took a deep breath and ran towards the lair of the dragon.  He didn't see the dragon anymore, but he knew that it was still alive.  The knight then ran in and started searching around the lair.  When he searched it, he didn't find anything but a single egg.\n\nThe knight then picked up the egg and ran out.  He was then greeted by a woman who was in her 30's with a sword and a bow in her hands.\n\n\"Who are you?\" she asked.  \n\nThe knight then bowed and said, \"I am a knight, I have killed the dragon who was terrorizing your kingdom and took an egg from him.\"\n\nThe woman then smiled and said, \"You are brave, you should be rewarded, do you want to come in?\"\n\nThe knight then nodded and followed the woman inside, and then she brought him into her room.  It was then that she revealed to the knight who she was.\n\nShe was the dragon.\n\n\"I see you are able to tell that I am a dragon,\" said the woman.  \"Do you want to kill me or marry me?\"\n\nThe knight then smiled and said, \"I don't have any reason to kill you now that the dragon has been slain.  I have to ask, how are you able to be a woman?\"\n\nThe woman laughed and said, \"I am the queen, I am a woman who is a dragon.\"  She then looked at the knight and saw that he was holding the egg.  \"Oh, you took the egg from the dragon, well I guess it is only fair that you marry me then,\" she said.\n\nThe knight then smiled and said, \"I have to ask, why did you want me to marry you?\"\n\nThe woman then smiled and said, \"Because you killed the dragon that was terrorizing my kingdom, I don't want to marry some fool who was not able to defeat him.\"\n\nThe knight smiled and said, \"I guess we'll see then,\" and then the knight gave the egg to the woman.  The woman then laughed and said, \"Let's go to the kitchen and make us some pancakes.\"  The knight then smiled and followed her there."

        "pred_story": "\"I don't know if I can do this,\" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. \"I mean, I'm not even in high school yet.\" It was like he was asking me to jump off a cliff, but without a safety net. \"Why do you need me? Why can't you do it yourself?\"\n\n\"Because you're my only relative with the gift,\" he replied. \"You have to learn it, and the only way to do that is by hands on experience. You can't learn it from a book.\" He sighed, his eyes looking at me for what felt like the hundredth time that day.\n\n\"But I'm just twelve.\"\n\n\"Twelve! That's practically an adult!\" he said. \"You're the only one who can help me out, and I really need it. If I don't do this, who knows what will happen? You're my only chance to help the old man, and help the whole town, and I'm not about to give up on that.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I know it seems scary, but trust me, you'll love it.\" He said with a smile.\n\nI didn't know if I should believe him or not. He sounded happy, so maybe he was telling the truth. Or maybe he was just desperate.\n\n\"Okay,\" I said finally, deciding to give it a shot. \"But what is the gift? What does it have to do with the old man?\" I'd heard stories of him, but they said he was crazy. There was no way he was real.\n\n\"That's for you to find out,\" he said with a smile. \"Now, do you want to take a break from this boring old town for a while and visit the old man? Or are you waiting for the next bus?\"\n\nI sighed, then nodded. \"Let's do it.\" I said, before he could get a call from the old man again. After a long bus ride, I arrived in the town. The town was old, with buildings falling over themselves. There were cobblestone streets, and horses and carts went by every now and then. There were a few people walking around, but the town felt empty and empty. But then, we arrived at the old mans' house. The house was big and old, with dark walls and a big gate that looked like iron. The front door was open, and a butler greeted us.\n\n\"Ah, thank you for coming,\" he said, before disappearing into the house. \"Come this way.\"\n\nI couldn't believe it. I didn't know that butlers still existed in the real world. I followed the butler, and we arrived at the old man's study. He was standing over a map of the world, a finger tracing a circle around a continent.\n\n\"Ah, thank you so much for coming,\" he said, before turning around. He was old, with a long white beard and mustache, and eyes that were clouded by cataracts. He was hunched over, his back bent by old age. \"Thank you, thank you so much for coming.\" He repeated, as he moved closer to me. His eyes looked into mine, and I saw something there that I couldn't quite put my finger on. \"Thank you, thank you.\"\n\n\"You're welcome,\" I replied. \"What do I need to do?\"\n\n\"First, you need to ask my permission,\" the old man said, before turning his back on me. \"Then, you can start to learn the gift.\" He said, before walking out of the room.\n\n\"What's the gift?\" I asked the butler.\n\n\"You'll see soon enough,\" he said. \"Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going back to bed. You can start your learning tomorrow, but for now, I suggest you get some rest.\"\n\nThe butler left, leaving me alone in the study. I sighed, before walking out of the room and to my room. I lay in my bed, and fell asleep almost immediately. The next morning, I woke up and went to the butler's room, where he was already up and getting ready. \"Good morning,\" he said, before leaving me to find my way to the study. There was the old man, in his study, with the map from before.\n\n\"Ah, thank you for coming,\" he said, before turning to me. \"Thank you, thank you.\" He said, before I could stop him. \"Now, you must ask my permission. Then, you can start to learn the gift.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said, before he stopped me. He turned around, and looked into my eyes. I saw something there, and I could feel it too. It was a feeling I didn't know how to describe. \"What is this feeling?\" I asked.\n\nThe old man smiled, then turned away. \"It's the gift,\" he said. \"It's the connection between us.\" He turned back to me, then put a hand on my face. \"Now, I must ask you to help me.\"\n\n\"Help you?\" I asked, confused.\n\nThe old man nodded. \"Yes, help me. You must be the instrument to allow me to fulfill my dream.\"\n\nI didn't know what to do. I had never been asked to help someone before, and I didn't know if I should say yes or no. \"I don't know,\" I said.\n\nThe old man sighed, then looked at me again. \"What do you want?\" he asked.\n\nI didn't know how to answer that. I was just a twelve year old girl, living in a small town, and now I was being asked to fulfill some old man's dream? I knew I had to say no, but I couldn't. \"I want to help you,\" I said, before he nodded in approval. \"Okay, let's get started.\"\n\nHe smiled, then led me to his table. There were several objects there, each one with a strange glow around it. \"This is the first object,\" he said, before holding out a ring to me. I took it, and felt the glow. Suddenly, I could see the old man in my mind. I saw him as a young man, in love with a young woman, and I knew he was holding a ring. \"This is the object,\" he said. \"Do you want to touch it?\"\n\nI nodded, then put the ring in my pocket, before turning to the butler. \"That's it?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"But that's not the most important part.\"\n\n\"What's the most important part?\" I asked.\n\n\"It's the old man,\" he replied. \"He needs your help to make a wish.\"\n\n\"So what is the gift?\" I asked, feeling curious. \"What's this feeling I feel?\"\n\nThe butler smiled. \"Well, you have the gift,\" he said. \"You can see the past of any object.\"\n\n\"Wow,\" I said, amazed. \"That's amazing.\"\n\n\"But be careful,\" he added. \"Not all objects are nice.\"\n\nI nodded, before asking him another question. \"But what is the most important part?\"\n\n\"It's the old man,\" he replied. \"He needs your help to make a wish.\"\n\nI nodded, then felt a feeling of accomplishment.

        "pred_story": "I have been working with hoarders for years, I have to say that I have never seen anything like this. The house was a mess from top to bottom with trash and debris stacked up to the ceiling, but every inch of it was meticulously covered in fine china, vases, paintings and every sort of trinket you can imagine. It would take us at least a month to clear all this out. But it wasn't just the mess that bothered me, it was the stuff we found.\n\nOn my first day I was rummaging through the living room and I find a box of old clocks. But not just any clocks, these clocks are so old that I could swear that some of them were from the 19th century. But what really caught my eye was the one that was labeled with a big \"X\" over it. I opened it up and inside I found a note that read \"don't wind this one\".\n\nOn my second day I was digging through the attic, which was full of old boxes and trunks that were locked and sealed. I found one labeled \"DO NOT OPEN\" and another labeled \"DO NOT TOUCH\". It was almost as if the owner knew that we would be coming.\n\nAs we were clearing the attic I found a small box with a strange symbol on it. It was some sort of ancient language. I have to admit I didn't recognize it. But what really caught my eye was that it was locked with a small key. I had to dig a bit to find the key, but I finally found it in a small vase in the living room. When I opened the box I found a bunch of strange objects. Some looked like medical tools, some looked like instruments of torture, and some looked like ancient weapons.\n\nBut it was what was inside the box that really caught my eye. It was a small leather book, tied with a piece of string. I carefully opened the book and inside I found the history of the owner. It was a woman who had been born into a powerful family but had been married off to a cruel man who beat her. She had been locked up in her room for decades and had spent her time reading and writing in the book. She had also been experimenting with magic and had created the strange objects in the box. They were all used for good and were meant to protect her and help her fight against the cruel man who had taken over her family.\n\nBut what really caught my eye was the symbol on the box. It was some sort of magical symbol that would allow the reader to enter a special place. It was like a magical portal. I had to admit I was intrigued.\n\nAs we were clearing the rest of the house I found a small box with a strange symbol on it. It was the same symbol that was on the box in the attic. But I knew that this one was special because it had the same symbol that was on the clock that had a big X over it. I carefully opened the box and inside I found a small note that read \"press me\".\n\nWhen I pressed the note it opened up a small room that was hidden behind the wall. I couldn't believe it. It was a magical room that was filled with strange objects and strange smells. I had to admit that I was really intrigued.\n\nBut what really caught my eye was what was on the wall. It was a picture of me and my team. I couldn't believe it. How did they know that we would be coming? I had to admit I was really scared.\n\nI quickly left the room and ran back to the living room where the rest of my team was. I quickly called them over and told them about the room. But as they entered the room it disappeared.\n\nI knew that I had to tell my boss about this but I was scared. I didn't want to risk losing my job. So I told him that I made a mistake and that I had to go home.\n\nAs I left the house I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was waiting for me."

        "pred_story": "*Whack*\n\nThe pain was intense as I came to. My head spinning wildly, I looked around and saw nothing but the walls of a room made of wood and stone. A room I knew all too well. I was in the evil witch's tower, the place where the lost princess was kept. But how was I here? I couldn't recall falling to sleep, and how did I even get here? I didn't have answers to those questions as I slowly stood up. \n\nAs I did, I heard a faint cry out. It was a cry that I had heard many times before. The cry of the lost princess, crying out for her prince. The prince that I was. I had to find her, I thought. I would need to find a way down, but I could do that. My sword lay across the room, and I picked it up. The room was small, and I could easily check if the door was there. And it was, just as I thought. I had done this many times before. I left my room to search for the princess, who I would rescue.\n\nI was halfway to the door when a voice boomed. \"You should not have come back here, young prince.\" I had heard that voice before. It was the voice of the witch who had been keeping the princess. I turned around, drawing my sword. I was not afraid of her, despite her reputation. I had been to her tower many times before, and I had seen the evil that she was capable of. I did not fear her, but I was angry. She had taken my princess, my love. And I would not leave her here alone.\n\n\"I was looking for my princess.\" I said, trying to keep the anger out of my voice. It was a difficult task, but I managed to succeed. I wanted to yell at her for taking the princess, but I was trying to stay calm. I had done this before, and I would succeed again.\n\nI saw the look of surprise in the witch's eyes. She did not expect me to know about her tower. She was clearly shocked that I knew about the princess that she had taken. I could tell that she did not expect me to be here. She was not prepared, and I was glad of that. It would make my mission easier.\n\nThe witch sighed. \"Yes, I know. You are a brave prince. But you are not a clever one.\" She crossed her arms. \"I have made a deal with your kingdom. A deal that will benefit both of our nations.\"\n\nI did not care about a deal between our nations. I cared only about my princess. I cared only about saving her from the witch. \"That has nothing to do with my princess. You must let her go.\"\n\nThe witch sighed again, and shook her head. \"You are so blinded by your love for her, prince. But I am sorry. I do not have the power to let her go.\"\n\nI knew that she did have the power to let the princess go. She had been keeping the princess for months now, and she had been successful in keeping her. But I would succeed. I would let the princess go, and I would take her back home.\n\nI was not going to let the witch defeat me. Not after all that I had been through. I had been to her tower before, and I had been through her spells. I knew them, and I could defeat them. I just needed to be brave, and I would succeed.\n\nI held my sword high, and I prepared to cast the spell that I had been preparing for months. I knew that it was not going to be easy, but I had faith that I would succeed. I would let the princess go, and I would take her back home. But it wasn't happening. The spell wasn't happening. I was just standing there, holding my sword, waiting for the spell to happen, but it wasn't. And then I heard the voice of my princess.\n\n\"Prince,\" she said, looking at me with sad eyes.\n\nI looked at her, and I smiled. \"My dear princess.\" I said, rushing to her side. I knelt down, and I hugged her. \"I am going to let you go,\" I said, looking up at her. She smiled, and she nodded.\n\n\"I don't want to go,\" she said, holding onto me. She had been my princess for years, and she had been my love for months now. I had been separated from her for months, and I would do anything to keep her from the witch. But I knew that I had to let her go. I had to let her go so that she could live a happy life, free from the witch's spells and curses. And she would be happy, because she would be with her parents, her family. And I would be happy, because I would know that she was happy. \n\nShe would be safe, she would be loved, and she would be with her parents. And I would be happy. I would be happy, knowing that she was safe, and happy. I let her go, and I smiled at her.\n\n\"I will always love you,\" I said, looking into her eyes. She smiled, and she nodded.\n\n\"I love you too,\" she said, and she left the tower. And I stayed with the witch, who was very angry at me. But I didn't care. I had let my princess go, and that was all that mattered to me. And it did matter to her too. I saw her again a few months later, and she was happy. She was with her parents, her family, and she was loved. And that was all that mattered to me.\n\nI was happy that she was safe, and happy. And that was all that mattered to me. That is how the story goes, and I hope you enjoyed it."

As always, I was ready. My eyes watched the clock tick the final seconds of the hour away, and I waited, my hands poised over the cups of coffee that I had set aside, my feet tapping out the rhythm of my nerves.\n\nAnd then, he was there, in the doorway, his head bowed low, his eyes cast down at the ground. His long coat billowed around him, a dark cloud of unknown fabric, and his hat seemed too small for his head, and his boots were too big for his feet. He was as always, an enigma, a mystery, a man, but not quite a man, not fully formed, as if some vital part had been left out, or some vital part taken away.\n\nAnd yet, despite the mystery of him, despite the strangeness of him, I felt a familiarity, a comfort, a sense of welcome, as if he were a long-lost friend, or perhaps an old enemy, one whose arrival I had anticipated, and dreaded, for so long.\n\n\"Good evening,\" I said, as I always did, as if it were a question, a query, a tentative, uncertain greeting, though it was none of these things, though it was, in truth, a statement, a declaration, a simple, direct, unvarnished phrase.\n\nHe nodded, as he always did, a small, almost imperceptible movement of his head, a gesture that seemed too small to signify, but was, nonetheless, a gesture, a movement, a sign of life, of animation, of breath, and of blood, though there was something of none of these things in his stillness, in his quiet, in his calm.\n\nAnd then, as always, he took a seat, a chair at the counter, a stool, a place that seemed to be, not a place, but a state of being, a being, a man, but not quite a man, a shadow of a man, a man without a face, without a voice, without a soul, yet with a presence, a palpable, a felt, a known presence, that filled the room, that filled me, that filled the air, that filled the world, with an unsettling, a unsettling, a thrilling, a thrilling sense, of expectation, of anticipation, of dread, and of fear.\n\nAnd then, as always, he ordered, though he never ordered anything, never asked for anything, never asked for food, or drink, or service, but said, instead, as he always did, \"The usual,\" a single word, a simple word, a word that seemed too small to signify, yet meant, and meant, and meant, everything, everything, everything.\n\nI nodded, as always, a small, almost imperceptible movement of my head, a gesture that seemed too small to signify, though it signified, and signified, everything, everything, everything. And then, I poured him a cup, a cup of coffee, a cup of black, bitter, dark liquid, that seemed to have no taste, no smell, no presence, yet had, and had, a presence, a flavor, a smell, a taste, that filled the room, that filled him, that filled me, with a sense, a sense, a sense, of wonder, of awe, of fear, and of dread.\n\nAnd then, as always, we waited, the minutes ticked away, the hours passed, the night wore on, the darkness deepened, the shadows grew long, the wind blew, the rain fell, and the world outside changed, transformed, became something, something, something, new, yet still the same, still familiar, still known, still recognized, still remembered, as the darkness, and the shadows, and the wind, and the rain, and the world, all, all, all, seemed to conspire, to join, to merge, to flow, to converge, to become one, one, one, with the man, the mystery, the enigma, the stranger, the stranger, the stranger, in the chair, the chair, the chair, that seemed to be, not a chair, but a state of being, a being, a man, but not quite a man, a shadow of a man, a man without a face, without a voice, without a soul, yet with a presence, a palpable, a felt, a known presence, that filled the room, that filled me, that filled the air, that filled the world, with an unsettling, a thrilling, a thrilling, a sense, of expectation, of anticipation, of dread, and of fear.\n\nAnd then, as always, he was gone, vanished, disappeared, vanished into thin air, vanished, vanished, vanished, without a sound, without a word, without a sign, without a gesture, without a presence, yet left behind, and left behind, and left behind, the coffee, the cup, the chair, the chair, the chair, that seemed to be, not a chair, but a state of being, a being, a man, but not quite a man, a shadow of a man, a man without a face, without a voice, without a soul, yet with a presence, a palpable, a felt, a known presence, that filled the room, that filled me, that filled the air, that filled the world, with an unsettling, a thrilling, a thrilling, a sense, of expectation, of anticipation, of dread, and of fear.\n\nAnd then, I cleaned up, as always, the cup, the saucer, the chair, the chair, the chair, that seemed to be, not a chair, but a state of being, a being, a man, but not quite a man, a shadow of a man, a man without a face, without a voice, without a soul, yet with a presence, a palpable, a felt, a known presence, that filled the room, that filled me, that filled the air, that filled the world, with an unsettling, a thrilling, a thrilling, a sense, of expectation, of anticipation, of dread, and of fear."

We\u2019ll get through this.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, mom.\u201d The boy replied, but he looked unsure. \u201cBut what if there are monsters there?\u201d He asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThe old woman smiled, \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as monsters, honey. Just animals, and sometimes, wild animals can be scary. But we\u2019ll be okay. We\u2019ll go together. Alright? Now, let\u2019s move.\u201d She stood, holding the boy up. The boy looked at the lantern in his hand again, and then at his mother, and then nodded. Together, they began to run, but soon, she heard the boy crying, and then the lantern went out.\n\nIn the darkness, the old woman froze, and then looked around. \u201cHoney, I know you\u2019re scared, but we have to keep moving. It\u2019s dark, but we know where we are, and we know where we\u2019re going. You can stay close to me, okay?\u201d She spoke softly, but the boy didn\u2019t answer. She heard him crying again, and then the wind rustled. She took a deep breath, and began to walk, holding the boy up. But soon, she heard the boy\u2019s cries again. She stopped, and looked at him. The wind was blowing hard, and the darkness was thick. The boy was crying, and she could feel his body trembling in her arms.\n\nThe old woman took a deep breath, and began to sing a nursery rhyme. The boy\u2019s crying slowly stopped, and she felt his body relax. But soon, she heard a rustling, and then a voice called out, \u201cHello there. Who\u2019s there?\u201d The voice was loud, but it was unfamiliar. The old woman stopped, and looked around, but she couldn\u2019t see anyone. \u201cHello, hello, hello. I heard you. Who\u2019s there?\u201d\n\nThe old woman took a deep breath, and nodded, \u201cI\u2019m here. My son is here too.\u201d She heard a rustling, and then a figure appeared. It was a tall woman, with piercing eyes. The old woman could see her eyes clearly in the darkness, and she felt her heart twitch. The tall woman began to walk towards them, and the old woman took a step back, holding the boy up tightly.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d The tall woman asked, and her voice was low. The old woman swallowed, but she found her voice, \u201cI\u2019m just an old woman, and my son. We\u2019re lost, and we\u2019re trying to find our way home.\u201d The tall woman stopped before them, and looked at the boy in the old woman\u2019s arms. \u201cYou\u2019re lost?\u201d\n\nThe old woman nodded, \u201cYes, we\u2019re lost. Can you help us?\u201d\n\nThe tall woman smiled, \u201cWell, we\u2019re almost home. I can give you a ride home if you want.\u201d She said, her eyes gleaming in the darkness. The old woman looked at her hesitantly, but then nodded, \u201cThank you. That would be great. Thank you.\u201d\n\nThe tall woman smiled, and took a step back, \u201cNo problem, no problem. Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d She gestured, and the old woman took a deep breath, and followed her. The boy in her arms looked confused, but he didn\u2019t say anything. The tall woman led them to a cave, and inside, she lit a lantern, and showed them a room. The room was small, but it was cozy.\n\nThe old woman smiled, \u201cThank you. This is great.\u201d But the tall woman smiled again, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, you\u2019re welcome. But first, can you tell me your names?\u201d She asked, her eyes gleaming in the light. The old woman hesitated, but then nodded, \u201cI\u2019m Elara, and this is my son, Kael.\u201d The tall woman smiled, \u201cWonderful. My name is Raven. Nice to meet you both.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut where are we?\u201d Elara asked, looking around the room. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the forest.\u201d\n\nRaven laughed, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not the forest. This is my place. I live here, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d She said, and her eyes gleamed in the light. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cMine.\u201d Kael whispered, looking at Raven. He could see her eyes clearly in the light, and he felt his heart twitch. He looked at his mother, but she didn\u2019t look at him. She looked at Raven, and he could see the fear in her eyes. He felt his heart twist, and he looked at Raven again. She was smiling at him, and he felt his heart skip a beat. He looked at his mother again, and she looked at him, her eyes full of tears.\n\n\u201cMom?\u201d He whispered, looking at her. \u201cI know you\u2019re scared, but I\u2019m here. I promise. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re coming with us.\u201d Elara said, her voice trembling. Raven smiled, \u201cNo, honey. You don\u2019t want to take him with you. He belongs here. He belongs with me.\u201d\n\nElara looked at the boy, and saw him smiling at Raven, \u201cBut he\u2019s my son. I can\u2019t leave him here. Take him to the light, so we can go home.\u201d\n\nRaven laughed, \u201cNo, honey. We can\u2019t leave him here. He belongs with me. And besides, there is no light. The light is gone. It\u2019s gone forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not true.\u201d Elara argued. \u201cI remember the light. It\u2019s always been there. It\u2019ll always be there.\u201d\n\nRaven shook her head, \u201cNo, honey. You\u2019re wrong. I can see it in your eyes. The light is gone"

        "pred_story": "The old wise one stood tall on the steps, gazing up at the ringed gas giant.\n\n\"You all know I'm a simple man,\" he said. \"My father was a farmer, my mother a healer. I learned to plant crops, cure illnesses, and protect my family from harm. I never asked for special powers, never dreamed of being the one chosen by the gods. But then, something strange happened.\"\n\nThe wise one rubbed his chin, the wisps of white hair behind his ears tickling his neck.\n\n\"One day, while walking in the fields, I saw it. The circle. Perfectly round, like a flower blooming in the soil. No beginning or end, no stem or leaf. Just a simple circle.\"\n\nThe crowd leaned in, their eyes shining with awe.\n\n\"And that day, the crops grew faster than any before,\" the wise one continued. \"They grew taller, stronger, and more vibrant. The rain was abundant, the sun shining bright, and the soil, it nourished them, it fed them, it loved them.\"\n\nThe people murmured among themselves, their faces reflecting the wonder of their leader's words.\n\n\"And when the crops were ripe, we harvested them, and the gods granted us a bounty beyond measure. The animals multiplied, the water flowed clean, and the air was crisp, like the morning dew on the grass.\"\n\nThe crowd nodded, some crying, others smiling, but all were in awe of the wise one's tale.\n\n\"Then, we saw the crescent moon, the new beginning, the cycle of life, the promise of renewal. The animals mated, the soil was fertile, and the rains came, bringing life to the parched earth.\"\n\nThe people nodded again, some taking notes on a parchment.\n\n\"And then, the cross. The crossroads. The choices we make. The crossroads of life and death, of right and wrong, of good and evil. We were given a choice, to choose the path that would lead us to prosperity or to ruin.\"\n\nThe crowd murmured, a few gasping, others whispering prayers.\n\n\"And finally, the X, the unknown. The mysteries of the universe. The unknown dangers, the hidden treasures, the secrets of the gods. We were given a gift, a chance to explore, to discover, and to learn.\"\n\nThe crowd sighed, some wiping away tears, others looking up at the rings of Saturn, wondering what other secrets lay hidden among them.\n\n\"So, my children,\" the wise one said, his voice shaking with emotion, \"I have told you the story of the circle, the crescent, the cross, and the X. I have shared with you the gifts the gods have bestowed upon us, and I implore you, do not forget them.\"\n\nThe crowd applauded, some cheering, others weeping, but all were in awe of the wise one's words.\n\n\"And now, my children,\" he said, \"I pass on to you the mantle of leadership. You must remember the circle, the crescent, the cross, and the X. You must respect the gifts of the gods and protect our home, our moon.\"\n\nThe crowd erupted in cheers, some shouting, others chanting, as the wise one descended from the steps, his wrinkled hands raised in a final farewell.\n\nThe moon was home to many tribes, all believing in the same gods. The circle, the crescent, the cross, and the X were shared, but the stories of the wise one were passed on differently, varying from tribe to tribe.\n\nThe Sunbreakers believed that the circle was a symbol of unity, strength, and resilience. They believed that it represented the unbreakable bonds between their people and the earth they cultivated.\n\nThe Raincallers believed that the crescent moon was a symbol of hope, renewal, and protection. They believed that the crescent moon was a reminder of the gods' power and grace, guiding them through times of need.\n\nThe Crossroads believed that the cross was a symbol of choice, freedom, and wisdom. They believed that the crossroads were the choices they made, the paths they chose, and the consequences they faced.\n\nThe X-Men believed that the X was a symbol of the unknown, mystery, and danger. They believed that the X was a reminder of the secrets the gods kept, the mysteries of the universe, and the dangers that lay hidden.\n\nAs the tribes went their separate ways, they carried with them the wise one's words, the circle, the crescent, the cross, and the X. And as they settled into their homes, they whispered prayers to the gods, thanking them for the gifts they bestowed, and asking for their protection in the times of need."

I mean, he was a lord, he was, but not my lord lord. He was my... um.\" She searched around her. \"There! The skull! Hold still, I must get the spell to show you.\" She picked up the skull and tapped it a few times. A holographic head appeared in front of her, and the eyes turned towards me. She pouted at it. \"The skull is not doing it right. Oh well, it would only be for a few days. After that you would need to get it again.

You're the only one who knows that I'm not evil.\" She looked at the skull and then back at me. \"Why do you ask? Am I not evil?\"\n\n\"I'm just confused. I mean, most summoners would want to get rid of their demon after a few hundred years, but you're still using me. I guess I just want to make sure that we're okay.\"\n\n\"Oh, we're okay, my dear summoner.\" She looked sad again. \"I am so sorry for how I have used you. I know that you have a life, and you need to live it, but I need you.\" She looked at the skull and then back at me. \"I would make it worth your while, but I have no wealth or power. If you want to end our relationship now, I will not stop you. I will even give you my blessing to do so, but I need you.\"\n\nI looked at my notebook and saw the play list that I had written earlier.

        "pred_story": "I thought that working in the office building would be boring. I mean, I work in the cube farm, staring at a computer all day. I thought I had to do this for a whole week, and then I get to leave for my real job as a web developer. But that feeling of boredom was replaced with utter fear. I was no longer in my office building, nor was I still on Earth. I was on a massive spaceship, and it looked like it was from science fiction. \n\nI was still wearing my black and white striped shirt, with my light brown pants, with my shoes. My backpack was still on me, and I still had my wallet in it, along with the money inside. It was as if my universe had been turned upside down. And I was walking around in a state of confusion, unsure of where I was or how I got there. But when I heard the voice, my state of fear went to a state of terror.\n\n\"Welcome to the ship. You have been chosen by fate, to come here and save your species.\"\n\nI turned around, and saw a being who was not a human. They were around 7 feet tall, and had scales like a fish. Their skin was a pale blue, and they had bright purple eyes. They were wearing some sort of suit, that looked like it was made of some sort of metallic material. They looked very similar to the humans I've seen in science fiction. \n\n\"Who are you? What do you want from me?\"\n\n\"I am your savior. I am here to warn you of a great danger that faces your species. The danger is so great that it can lead to the destruction of your planet. You will be given a chance to save your planet, but it will require you to convince a council of aliens to not destroy your planet. Are you up for this challenge?\"\n\nMy heart was pounding in my chest. The thought of the aliens destroying the Earth was too much to bear. I didn't know what I had to do, but I would do whatever it takes to save my planet. \n\n\"Yes, I'll do it.\"\n\n\"Excellent choice. Come with me.\"\n\nThe blue skinned being led me to a large room, where I saw a bunch of aliens. There was another species who was similar to the blue being, but their skin was more of a deep purple. There were also a number of aliens who had four arms, each of which had their own set of hands at the end. Then there were some who were similar to a cat, with a feline body, and a long tail. I even saw one alien who looked like a giant octopus. The being who led me here, I realized was a member of the blue species.\n\n\"This is the council. You have come to save your planet. What do you propose we do to avoid its destruction?\"\n\nI was taken aback by the question. I didn't know what to say. I looked around the room, trying to see if any of the aliens would give me any help. But they didn't seem to care about me. They looked at me like I was some sort of insect, who was trying to save the planet. I looked at the blue being, and asked him.\n\n\"Can you give me a minute?\"\n\nHe nodded. I looked at the council, and said.\n\n\"I need a minute to think.\"\n\nThe council nodded, giving me the time I need to think. I was given a minute to think of what to do. But to be honest, I didn't think that I was given enough time. I thought about what the blue being had said, that the aliens were going to destroy Earth. But I didn't know how I was going to prevent it. I was just a regular dude, who worked in a cube farm. \n\nBut I didn't think that my job at the cube farm would be my job for much longer. I was now on a spaceship, talking to aliens. I looked around the room, trying to see any way out. But I didn't see any doors. I didn't see any windows. All I saw was a group of aliens who were staring at me, waiting for me to come up with a plan.\n\nBut I didn't have one. I looked at the blue being, who was standing in the corner. I asked him.\n\n\"I don't have a plan.\"\n\nThe blue being walked up to me, and asked.\n\n\"What do you mean you don't have a plan?\"\n\n\"I don't know how to prevent them from destroying Earth. I'm just a regular dude, who works in a cube farm.\"\n\nThe blue being looked at me with his purple eyes. I thought he would be angry with me, because I didn't have a plan. But surprisingly, he wasn't. He asked me.\n\n\"Do you have any idea why we are going to destroy your planet?\"\n\nI thought about it. I didn't have any idea. But then I thought about something that I saw in the office. It was a memo, that was written in a circular style. It had a lot of corporate jargon that I didn't understand. But one sentence stuck out in my mind.\n\n\"We will be destroyed if we do not go green.\"\n\nI looked at the blue being, and asked.\n\n\"Is that why you want to destroy Earth?\"\n\nThe blue being looked at me with his purple eyes, and asked.\n\n\"Do you know what the memo meant?\"\n\n\"No, I have no idea. It was written in corporate speak, that I didn't understand. But it had something to do with going green, and being destroyed if we don't.\"\n\nThe blue being nodded, and said.\n\n\"The memo you read was written in a language called corporate speak. It is a language that is used by humans to communicate with each other, using corporate jargon. It is a language that only humans can understand.\"\n\n\"So, it was something that only humans can understand. But you are humans, and you are going to destroy Earth.\"\n\nThe blue being looked at me, and said.\n\n\"The memo you read was written in a language that only humans can understand. But it was written to the humans. It was written to tell you that your planet was going to be destroyed if you don't go green. But the council wants to destroy Earth.\"\n\n\"But you don't want to destroy Earth. You want to save the planet.\"\n\nThe blue being nodded, and said.\n\n\"But we can't. The council is made up of different species, and they all have their own agenda. The council wants to destroy Earth, but I don't. I want to save the planet.\"\n\n\"But you can't. What can I do?\"\n\nThe blue being looked at me, and said.\n\n\"You have to convince the council to not destroy Earth. You have to convince them that destroying Earth will not help your species, and that your species will only be able to survive if they are allowed to live on Earth. You have to convince them that they don't have to destroy your planet, and that they can live with your species.\"\n\n\"But what can I say to them? I'm just a regular dude, who works in a cube farm.\"\n\nThe blue being smiled, and said.\n\n\"Ah, I think you are more than that. I think you are an amazing being, who has the power to save your planet. I think you are the one who is"

        "pred_story": "I felt like I was about to die. I had been frozen for so long. The last time I was conscious, I was in a hospital, waiting for a cure for my disease to be found. I was about to die, and my only hope for survival was to be frozen until a cure was found. I could remember my body being placed into a cryo pod as it was put in a freezer that was kept at a very low temperature. I don't know how long I was frozen, but it felt like days, weeks, months, or even years for all I know.\n\nI was awake, and I felt a warmth on my body as I opened my eyes. I could see a bright light, but it was not enough for me to be able to see my surroundings. I heard footsteps, but it was muffled, so I couldn't quite tell where they were coming from. I tried to sit up, but as I did, I felt a sharp pain in my head, and I collapsed to the ground. I had lost the use of my limbs as I was placed into the pod.\n\nI heard a loud noise, and suddenly the bright light was blocked out. I couldn't see a thing, and I could only hear a faint voice talking. \"I think he's awake, we need to get a doctor over here now.\" I tried to speak, but all that came out was a faint whisper. \"I'm here, just relax, I'm going to try to get some information out of you.\" I couldn't tell who was talking, but I couldn't deny that they were trying to be kind. \"So, when were you frozen?\" I tried to answer, but my body failed me, and all that came out was a faint voice speaking on my behalf. \n\n\"Oh, I... I... um, how long was it until my pod was discovered?\" I tried to ask again, but my body failed me once again. \"I... I... um, I... I think I need a pen and some paper.\" I heard footsteps moving in a different direction before the voice returned. \"Here we are, and I hope you can forgive us for not having a pen and paper for you.\" I heard some rustling before the voice returned. \n\n\"Okay, we're here, and we're ready to help. Can you tell me your name?\" I tried to answer, but it was too much. I could feel my body losing strength as I tried to talk, and I was beginning to feel like I was going to black out. I tried to ask again, but my body failed me again. \"Sorry, did I miss your name?\" The voice was full of kindness, but I didn't want to be rude. \"I... I... um, I... uh, I don't know.\" I could see the light in the sky, and I could hear the voices of the people around me. There were a lot of them. I couldn't tell how many, but they were all talking at once.\n\n\"Do you know where you are?\" I tried to answer, but my body failed me again. \"I... I... I don't know.\" I could feel my body losing strength, and I was about to give up. I thought about giving up, but then I heard a voice from the back. \"Hello, my name is Dr. Patel, and I'm an archaeologist. I think you are in an ancient temple.\" I couldn't believe it. \"That's right.\" I said, but my body failed me again. \"I... I... I don't know.\" I heard the voice of the doctor, \"I think you might be having a bit of trouble communicating because of the cryo process. We can try to help you with that, but I think we need to get you to a medical lab first.\"\n\nA medic came by, and they gave me a drug that would help my body recover, and help me communicate better. I was able to speak again, but my memories of the past were still missing. I had lost them all. \"I don't know, I don't remember anything about my life.\" The doctor was kind, but his words were cold. \"I'm sorry, we're going to need to ask you a few questions.\" I was happy that I could communicate again. \"I... I... I don't know.\" The medic was kind, and he gave me some more medication. \"I'm sorry, I can give you some medication that will make you feel a lot better, but it will also make you forget some of your memories.\" I couldn't believe it. \"You... you can make me forget my memories?\" The medic was kind, but I knew that I should not be happy about that. \"I'm sorry, but we're going to need you to forget some of your memories for now.\""

        "pred_story": "I had always been one of those gamers who didn't think it was weird that we can just go and \"marry\" an elf or another race of beings like that. It didn't seem too weird. I mean, I was just going to be married to some elven lady who has a bunch of skills and experience that would be quite useful for a job like being a warrior. And, as a result, I would be the queen of elven kind. I couldn't think of any reasons why I would not do this. Well, maybe a few. Like, how would I get married to an elf? I'm just a guy, and the whole thing was so out there that I couldn't really even imagine it happening. But still, my character was the queen of elves, so I might as well have some fun with it.\n\nI was a pretty strong guy, and I made sure to stay in shape. I was a fan of working out, but I was never a super competitive athlete. I wasn't really a fan of the whole competitive sports thing. So, I didn't have any major athletic abilities, but I was pretty sure I would hold my own if I were put into a fight. I also had a bit of a knack for magic, and was able to learn some simple spells in my free time. It was probably due to some latent magical abilities that the elves were able to tap into.\n\nOne of the things that really made this story fun was how little the elven queen cared about the whole thing. She wasn't too interested in the human world, and she really didn't want anything to do with me. She wasn't really a fan of the whole concept of \"marriage\". She thought it was too formal. It wasn't really an elven thing. But I didn't care. I would get to be the queen of elven kind, and I could do what I wanted as long as it didn't get out of hand. I couldn't really imagine what I could do in this position, so I made sure to focus on getting some more skills and abilities to go along with the job.\n\nBut then, I started to realize that the queen had a few ideas on her own. Not bad ideas, either. In fact, they were quite good. I didn't care for the whole marriage part. She agreed to change that for me, and I became the ruler of elves and the queen's husband. But, my last name was hers. It was a bit weird, I admit. But it made her seem more human, rather than some kind of alien being. She was actually pretty nice too, and I found myself really enjoying her company. We would go for walks together, or play games. We talked a lot. It really wasn't too bad.\n\nBut, that was still not really what the queen had in mind. She had ideas that involved \"using\" me to help her out. That wasn't too bad, since I was kind of used to doing my job at the behest of a superior. But, I wasn't really used to the feeling of being in a relationship. And, the queen had quite a few ideas on the subject. I had thought that she would be kind of distant. But, she didn't really think of me as a companion, so much as an extension of herself. And, she really didn't care for the whole concept of \"consent\". She just kind of expected that I would be fine with her ideas.\n\nStill, I was happy. She had agreed to be my partner, rather than a superior. And, she didn't really seem like someone who would do something like that. But, I figured that it wouldn't hurt to go along with it. And, to my surprise, it really wasn't that bad. I did kind of enjoy her company, and I was kind of happy with her. Well, it was all pretty strange. But, it was all kind of enjoyable, in a weird way. I had never thought that I would end up in a situation like that, but here I was. And, to be honest, it was kind of nice."

It is a mannerism, I know, but I've found it helps people connect with me.

Don't worry, I won't poison you. I've already broken the rules.\"\n\nShe smiled at me, her teeth a sharp glint in the flickering candlelight. One hand, slender and delicate, touched my arm, and I felt the warmth of her touch spread through me. It was a gentle pressure, almost comforting, but I didn't let myself relax.\n\nShe laughed at me, a quiet, musical sound, and pulled out a plate of food from her sleeve. The plate was made of polished wood, a deep brown color, and it was filled with what looked like roasted root vegetables, steaming hot from the oven.\n\n\"Eat,\" she said, pushing the plate towards me.\n\nI pushed it away, my eyes locked on hers. Her eyes were a deep, rich green, with flecks of gold around the edges. Her hair was dark, like the night sky, and it curled around her face in loose spirals.\n\n\"I'm not hungry,\" I lied. \"And even if I were, I wouldn't eat something you offered me.\"\n\nHer smile widened. \"Oh, come now,\" she said. \"Even the fae don't poison their guests. We're not that cruel.\"\n\nShe paused, and I saw a flicker of something in her eyes. Anger, perhaps, or annoyance. But it was quickly replaced by her usual warmth and charm.\n\n\"I'm not cruel,\" she said. \"I'm just... eager. I want to help you, to make you feel welcome in my home. And the best way to do that is to feed you.\"\n\nI swallowed, and felt a knot form in my throat. It was hard to think with the fae logic looping around my brain, but I knew that if I ate something she offered me, she would be able to manipulate me. To control me.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. \"But I'm not hungry.\"\n\nHer face fell, and I saw a flash of sadness in her eyes. But it was quickly replaced by that damned charming smile.\n\n\"Suit yourself,\" she said. \"But don't say I didn't warn you. Your choice of diet will affect your health, and your mood. And I can't help you if you're too stubborn to accept my help.\"\n\nShe sighed, and leaned back in her chair. I wondered if she would try to convince me further, to tempt me with more food or other offerings, but she seemed to have accepted my refusal.\n\nAs we sat in silence, I couldn't help but wonder what would happen if I ate something she offered me. Would I be trapped in her realm forever, bound to her will? Or would I be freed, able to leave the fae kingdom behind and return to my own world?\n\nI couldn't take the risk. But at the same time, I couldn't help but feel a pang of regret for refusing the food.\n\n\"Is there anything else you can offer me?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nHer smile returned, and she leaned forward in her chair. \"I could offer you shelter,\" she said, \"or company. I could show you the wonders of my realm.\"\n\nI shook my head, and she sighed. I could feel her disappointment, though she didn't let it show in her eyes.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said, again. \"But I don't feel comfortable here.\"\n\nShe nodded, and her smile returned. \"I understand,\" she said. \"But be warned, I will do everything in my power to make you feel comfortable. I will even try to tempt you, to make you see the wonders of my realm.\"\n\nI frowned, but she just smiled. \"I promise,\" she said, \"that I will be gentle. But I must try.\"\n\nAnd with that, she leaned back in her chair, and we sat in silence again. I couldn't help but wonder what would happen next. Would I be tempted by her offers? Or would I find a way to escape?"

She's wearing a green t-shirt with white pants. There's even a silver watch on her arm. She looks normal, just a little taller than average and her skin has that green tint, and her eyes have a black slit instead of pupils, but besides that she's a normal person.

There's no claws, just toes. And look at her face. See all those little lines around her mouth and her eyes? Look at those wrinkles. Human skin does that and all the little lines like that too. She's a human, just not a human like you.*\n\n*How could she be a human like us? We're just people! We can't be humans like that!*\n\n*Well... she says she's a human. I'm sure of it. She said something about a human and how it was a big word in her language, she said it's something that means people who are intelligent and able to learn.

So we don't have to be monsters anymore!*\n\n*I don't want to be a monster!*\n\n*Neither do I! But I want to see my mom again. I want to see you too and I want to see her!

I've got a pretty good understanding of just how much I suck.\n\nPeople avoid me. Like, actively. That's not a surprise, but it's disappointing. I thought it was because they wanted to, you know, hear my song.\n\nI know I'm not the only one who knows this, but most humans don't get it. I'm not a siren like in the old stories. I'm more like the creepy monster you leave your phone battery on while it's still connected to the wall outlet. If you know what I mean.\n\nSome guys try to hook up, but they usually end up screaming and running. I mean, I guess that's kind of flattering? It's hard to imagine anyone would want to, you know, actually *be* with me. I'm not even sure I want to.\n\nSome people try to take pictures with me, and they usually end up falling for the trick. I'll let them get close enough to take a selfie, and then I'll grab their arm and yank them off the cliff. They always seem so surprised.\n\nI get it, I'm not the most pleasant company. But come on. Most people would want a chance to hear my song. I'd be happy to sing just for them.\n\nToday was the first time someone sang back. I was a little hopeful, but I wasn't expecting much. I mean, who wants to be stuck with me all day?\n\nIt wasn't even a good song. I guess that's fair, I didn't expect someone to be a genius with a hook for a hand either.\n\nI was at the grocery store when he started singing. I don't know why he picked the middle of the cereal aisle to break out into song, but he did. The song was bad, but I was intrigued. He was singing about the dangers of buying cereal, something about the sugar content ruining his brain.\n\nAt least, that's what it sounded like. It's not like I have much to compare it to. I've tried to sing along to the radio a few times, but I usually end up getting lost in the middle of a song. I know I've got a good ear for music, but when you have a hook for a hand, it's not exactly easy to hold onto a microphone.\n\nIt was weird. There weren't many people around, but I could hear him clearly. I didn't know whether to be happy or sad, I guess. It was the first time someone had actually listened to me, and I didn't know whether to be grateful or disappointed.\n\nThe song was bad, but I heard him clearly. I don't know how he was able to find me, but he must have been able to hear me somehow. I thought that was pretty cool, but I didn't know what to do about it. I've never had someone that interested in me before. I didn't know how to react.\n\nHe was singing about how he could only afford half a loaf of bread. I'm pretty sure that's not what he said, but that's what it sounded like. Like I said, I don't exactly have the best ear for music.\n\nI tried to pay attention to the rest of the song, but it was hard. I was feeling a little overwhelmed, and I didn't know whether to be happy or sad. I wanted to sing along with him, but I didn't know if he could hear me.\n\nWhen the song finished, he looked around and saw me. I'm not sure what he expected, but he looked a little surprised. I guess that's fair, I'm not exactly the most approachable person.\n\nHe waved and smiled at me, and I waved back. I guess that's all it is, I thought. Just a smile. That's all anyone has ever really wanted from me.\n\nI wanted to say something back, but I didn't know what to say. I'm pretty bad at conversation. He asked me if I wanted to grab a cup of coffee with him, and I said yes. I guess that's all it is, I thought. Just a smile.\n\nWe sat down at a coffee shop and talked for a while. I was nervous, but he seemed pretty easy going. I think he might be interested in me? I don't know if it's possible, but he seemed pretty interested in me.\n\nWhen he got up to leave, I felt a little sad. I didn't want him to go, but I knew it was probably for the best. He'd already spent way too much time with me, and I was sure he'd regret it when the sun came up.\n\nBut even as he was walking away, he turned around and waved at me. He smiled, and I felt my heart skip a beat. Maybe he's interested after all, I thought. Maybe it's actually possible.\n\nI don't know, I guess time will tell. But maybe it's not about finding someone to love me. Maybe it's about finding someone to be myself around. Maybe it's not about finding a boyfriend, but finding a friend.\n\nI don't know. But I think it might be possible. And that's all I need right now."

        "pred_story": "A very normal Tuesday.\n\nWaking up in a coffin as an immortal. I get that from time to time. People die, people who I have bitten. And they become me. A vampire. The worst part is that they end up in a coffin. I never liked coffins. So creepy. And cold. But at least they aren't too hard to find. All you need to do is wait until midnight. People tend to go to bed then.\n\nBut today was different. For once I didn't find a body. No coffin. No tomb. No grave. No person dead in a way that was strange enough to stand out. I went home, drank some blood and took a long nap. Just another week of being a vampire, nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nUntil I woke up.\n\nBut this time I wasn't alone. Not in my coffin. Someone was in my coffin. And that someone was on fire. I sat up quickly and ran to my bedroom door. It opened with a push and I stepped out into my bedroom. The fire was getting worse and worse. But I couldn't see the person in the coffin. I thought to myself, *what kind of crazy person would set themselves on fire?* That's when I heard a voice.\n\nYou think you're safe from things that go bump in the night?\n\nI walked over to my window and looked out. No other buildings. Just a cliff. And the person in the coffin had vanished. I turned around and I found her. She was standing next to my coffin. Her face was burned. So I knew it was her. She was in my coffin when she died. I stared at her and she looked back.\n\nYou don't want to think about that. What happens when you are dead. What happens when your body rots. Or when you are thrown in a sea with weights attached to your feet. This is all you'll have to think about. What happens when you are dead. And I am stuck with you. I have been stuck with people who I have killed for a long time. But I have never been stuck with a ghost.\n\nYou are mine now. You are mine. You are mine. You are mine. Oh fuck, that's really annoying. Do you have anything better to do? I hate being a vampire. I hate being a ghost. I hate being stuck together. Do you have anything better to do? Do you have anything better to do? Oh, fuck I'm sorry. I think this is the first time that we have talked. And I know that I don't want to talk to you. \n\nBut I don't know what to do. I want you to get out of my head. I want you to go away. But you are stuck with me. So what can I do? I can leave. And I can start over. I can find a new house. A new home. And I can start again. I can't kill anyone else. I can't be stuck with another person. I don't think that I can do that. But I can leave. I can leave and I can start over. I can be someone else. But I'll always know that this happened. I'll always know that I was trapped in my coffin with a girl on fire.\n\nWhat are you doing? Where are you going? I don't know. I don't know. I want to leave. I want to go somewhere else. I want to be alone. But I don't want to be alone. I don't want to be by myself. I want to be with someone. But not like that. I want to be with someone where we both can move. I want to be with someone where we both can talk.\n\nWhat are you doing? Where are you going? I'm leaving. I'm going to leave this house. And I'm going to start over. And you can't stop me. I can't leave you. What are you going to do? I will find you again. I will follow you. I will find you again. Oh, fuck. I am going to make you suffer. I am going to make you suffer. I am going to make you suffer. I am going to make you suffer. Oh, fuck. I am going to make you suffer. Oh, fuck. I am going to make you suffer. I am going to make you suffer. I am going to make you suffer."

HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SICK AND NOW MY MOTHER IS GONE!!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cAhem.\u201d Said the nurse. \u201cExcuse me miss, could you please keep your voice down? Your brother is trying to sleep.\u201d  \n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s okay! He\u2019s going to be fine! But I have to go out and find my mom!! She said she would be back in 2 hours and it\u2019s already 4! Something terrible happened to her!!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s see what\u2019s going on here and see if we can get you calmed down.\u201d Said the nurse as she took out a chart and began reading it. \u201cIt says here that your mom gave you a very specific set of instructions and if anything happened to her, you\u2019re supposed to go to the hospital.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m only 10!! I don\u2019t know how to make it to the hospital!!!\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d Said the nurse as she looked down at the chart. \u201cIt says here that your mom was going to meet you at the hospital.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why?!\u201d Cried the girl.\n\n\u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll answer your questions but you have to calm down.\u201d Said the nurse. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down and we\u2019ll talk about this for a bit?\u201d  \n\nThe girl nodded as she walked over to the bed and sat down. The nurse then sat down beside her and continued her questions. \u201cSo, your mom said that if she didn\u2019t meet you at the hospital in 2 hours, she wanted you to come and talk to me?\u201d  \n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Replied the girl.\n\n\u201cOkay. So, do you know what happened to her mom? Maybe she was just running a little late?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was going on a date. But that\u2019s not it.\u201d Said the girl.\n\n\u201cOkay. What do you think it was then? Maybe she got stuck in traffic or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said something about a vampire. She said that they were getting more desperate so they needed her help.\u201d\n\n\u201cA vampire?\u201d Asked the nurse. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, I don\u2019t have a clue what to do.\u201d She turned around and then got back on the phone. \u201cHello, this is nurse Smith. We have a situation here and we need some advice.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, we have a situation.\u201d Said the voice on the other end of the phone.\n\n\u201cYes. We have a 10 year old girl and her mother is a vampire.\u201d Said the nurse.\n\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s a problem. I\u2019m a vampire. I work with a lot of them. What seems to be the problem?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, her mom said that she would be meeting her at the hospital in 2 hours but she never showed up. She said that if anything happened to her that she wanted her daughter to come and talk to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I think I know what happened to her mom. It sounds like she had a meeting with a group of vampires that didn\u2019t want to be found out. They tend to be very secretive but they are also very desperate so they try and get rid of people that they don\u2019t want to be found out by.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think you could find her?\u201d Asked the nurse.\n\n\u201cYes. I will try to find her.\u201d Replied the vampire.\n\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re a vampire. Why do you want to help her?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause she is my daughter. That\u2019s why.\u201d\n\nThe nurse sat down for a second before standing up again. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. You\u2019re a vampire. You\u2019re over 200 years old. How can you be a mother?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that a lot of humans can\u2019t understand how vampire society works but I hope that you can understand this one thing. Vampires can mate with other vampires, with humans, and with many other supernatural races. I have many children but I love each of them very much.\u201d Said the vampire.\n\nThe nurse sat down for a second again before looking at the girl. \u201cWell, that\u2019s good to hear. But I need you to go find your mom and see what happened to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Said the girl.\n\n\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa. It\u2019s okay to cry.\u201d Said the nurse. \u201cIt\u2019s very scary to be by yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Said the girl. \u201cI don\u2019t want my mom to be mad at me.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not mad at you. She\u2019s mad that the bad people got in her way. But don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re going to get your mom back.\u201d\n\nThe girl then stood up and ran out of the room. The nurse then followed her and went to the reception desk. \u201cI want to talk to my mom. She\u2019s out with my dad, right?\u201d Asked the girl.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Said the receptionist. \u201cThey\u2019ll be back soon. They have a reservation at a nice restaurant across the street.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the bathroom?\u201d Asked the girl.  \n\n\u201cUh, it\u2019s down that way.\u201d Said the receptionist as she pointed to a hallway.\n\nThe girl then ran down the hallway and went into the bathroom. She locked the door and then pulled out a mirror. She stared at herself for a second before looking down at her hands. They were covered in blood and the skin was almost gone. She then looked at herself again in the mirror. Her eyes were glowing bright red.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Asked the girl.\n\n\u201cBecause you were bitten. You're a vampire.\u201d Said a voice behind her.\n\nThe girl then looked in the mirror again. Her eyes were back to normal. She then turned around to look at who was behind her.\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d Said the girl.\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d Said the man. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there were any vampires still alive. We thought they were all extinct.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not extinct. Just rare.\u201d Said the girl.\n\n\u201cRarity doesn\u2019t matter when it comes to vampires. It\u2019s just a myth that humans invented to explain how people die under the full moon.\u201d Said the man.\n\n\u201cI was bitten. My eyes turned into red for a second.\u201d Said the girl.\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019re a vampire.\u201d Said the man.\n\n\u201cBut my mom said that it only happens to people that aren\u2019t vampires if they\u2019re turned.\u201d Said the girl.\n\n\u201cYes. But it only happens to people that are turned that haven\u2019t been in their teenage years. Vampires have been around for thousands of years and they have learned to control their bodies. Your mom must have told you the story about how she was turned because she knew you had the potential to become a vampire.\u201d Said the man.\n\nThe girl looked at the man for a second before turning around and going back into the bathroom. She went into a stall and shut the door. She then looked down at her hands again. They were back to normal. She then looked up at the ceiling and laughed as she screamed."

My boss hadn't messaged me in five years, not since I quit, and I thought I'd never hear from him again.\n\nI had left Hell Corporation when I was 40. I was tired of working myself to death for no pay. I was tired of dealing with the demonic overloads, tired of the constant meetings, and just tired. I took a job at a small marketing firm and spent the rest of my retirement planning on how to get rid of him.\n\nI tried to extend my contract, but he refused. He looked at me tiredly and told me I would never come back. I hadn't been back in five years, just like he'd said. But now, he was calling me in. Not for a meeting, not to ask me for a favor, but to tell me something.\n\nI looked at the time on my phone. It was just after midnight, and I had to get ready for work in two hours. I was already in bed, but I tossed my covers off and put on my shoes. I was only wearing pajamas, but I didn't care.\n\nWhen I got to the Hell Corporation building, I walked up to the front door and knocked. The door was answered by the head of security. I hadn't seen him in five years. He hadn't aged a day.\n\n\"Ms. Adams, I didn't expect to see you here tonight.\" He said. I didn't see anyone behind him, and he didn't mention a boss. \"What brings you to Hell Corporation today?\"\n\n\"Mr. Adams, I need to speak to my boss. It's urgent.\" I said, ignoring his question. He looked at me for a moment before walking out of the room. He left me standing alone in the lobby. When he returned, he brought another person with him.\n\nThey stood in the lobby, the large wooden table between us. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, and I had to steady myself so I didn't fall over. I was sweating, and I could feel my legs shaking.\n\n\"I apologize, but my boss is quite busy today. However, I am authorized to speak with you on his behalf.\" Mr. Adams said. I narrowed my eyes at him. What was going on?\n\n\"That's fine. But I need to see him.\" I said. Mr. Adams looked at the other man behind him, who spoke.\n\n\"I'm so sorry, Ms. Adams. Mr. Adams, please, explain.\" The man said.\n\n\"My boss has passed on, Ms. Adams. He died yesterday. And I need your help.\" Mr. Adams said, his voice filled with urgency.\n\nI stared at him, shocked. The man standing behind him was the head of finance. \"What's going on?\"\n\n\"The reason I wanted you back was to take over as interim CEO until I can find a new one. And I need your help.\" He said.\n\nI stared at them both, my jaw hanging open. I didn't know what to say. This was a shock. I didn't think I'd be back to Hell Corporation before my retirement, let alone running it.\n\n\"Are you certain? Because I think I'm too old to take on the job.\" I said, trying to play it cool. Mr. Adams smiled at me.\n\nYou were born for this, Ms. Adams. And I need your help.\" He said. I thought about what he said, and then I nodded. He was right, I was born for this."

        "pred_story": "I had been trying to get into my car for what felt like hours. As I struggled to get to the door, a figure emerged from the shadows. He was an older man, with a ragged beard and tattered clothes. He looked down at me from my car door, then back at me with a look of disappointment.\n\n\"You need help?\" I asked, my hands gripping the car door as hard as I could. I didn't think I could push it open, but if this man knew a trick I could use, I was willing to listen.\n\nHe sighed, shaking his head. \"You don't know, do you?\" He sat down next to me on the hood of the car. \"You don't know what's out there.\" He looked up at the sky, his eyes dim and sorrowful.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" I asked, my voice tight with frustration. My car had broken down on the side of the road, and I was tired and annoyed. The sun was starting to rise, and it was already hot. \"I just need to get my car started, that's all.\"\n\nHe turned to me, his eyes blazing. \"You don't know,\" he repeated, his voice low and urgent. \"They don't want you to know. They don't want you to see.\" He pointed out at the world around us, as if showing me something I had missed.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked, confused. I had no idea what he was talking about. This man was crazy, and I should get away from him before he did something dangerous. I tried to stand, but he grasped my arm.\n\nHe pulled me down, and I looked at him in alarm. His eyes were dark and desperate, and he was holding a book. It was old and worn, with strange symbols on its cover.\n\nHe leaned in, his lips near my ear. \"This is the truth,\" he whispered. \"The truth about the world we live in. This is the truth you don't know.\"\n\nI tried to shake him off, but he held tight. \"What is this?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. \"What are you going to do?\"\n\nHe opened the book, and I felt a shiver run down my spine. The pages were yellowed and cracked, with symbols that seemed to dance in the air. They were strange and incomprehensible, but somehow I knew what they meant.\n\nThe man spoke a word, and the page he was reading turned up. The world around us blurred, and suddenly I was somewhere else. I was standing in a field of flowers, surrounded by rolling hills and tall trees.\n\nA figure approached me, and I recognized her as a queen. She was dressed in a gown of gold, with a crown on her head and a scepter in her hand. She smiled at me, and I felt a surge of power run through me.\n\nI knew what I was doing, but I couldn't explain it. I was casting a spell, but I had never studied magic before. I had never known how to do it, but somehow I had learned.\n\nThe queen spoke to me, her voice like music in my mind. She was telling me what to do, and I did it without hesitation. I spoke the words, cast the spells, and watched as the world around me changed.\n\nThe queen smiled at me, her eyes shining with pride. \"You are one of us,\" she said. \"One of the few who have learned the truth.\"\n\nI looked around at the world around me, and saw that it was different. The buildings were made of something other than stone and steel, and the air was filled with a strange, pulsating energy.\n\n\"This is magic,\" the queen said. \"And you have learned it.\"\n\nI turned to the old man, and saw that he was holding a book. It was the same book he had shown me in my car, and I realized now that it was real.\n\n\"This is the truth,\" he said, handing me the book. \"The truth you didn't know.\"\n\nI took it from him, feeling its weight in my hands. I knew now what I had learned, and I knew that I had been living in a world I didn't understand.\n\nI looked back at the queen, who was smiling at me. \"You will use this knowledge,\" she said. \"You will use it to fight against those who would keep it from you.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a surge of determination run through me. I knew what I had to do, and I was ready to do it."

        "pred_story": "The daydreaming was more intense than before. It had been years since I first had the first of those. The first was the death of my sister in a car accident. I was too young then and didn't know it was happening, but my parents did and had been trying to figure out how to protect me from it. This was the second, but it was much more recent and was far more disturbing than the first.\n\nI thought about it briefly as I was daydreaming and knew it was one of them. There were things I recognized from what I had experienced. I knew it was a person. I knew that I would feel it. I knew it was something I had seen before. I just didn't know what to do.\n\nI couldn't wake up from these ones. I couldn't stop them. I couldn't move while they happened. All I could do was observe. I couldn't help that person. I couldn't stop what happened. I couldn't even wake up before it was over. All I could do was watch and know it was happening. And it always did.\n\nThat was why they were so dangerous. That was why they were worth so much. People would pay for the privilege of causing the daydreaming. It would give them the power to control others. It was why so many died in them. It was why the market was so high for them.\n\nI didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to stop it. I didn't know how to avoid it. All I could do was wait and know it was coming. I could only hope it would end soon.\n\nAnd then it happened. The scene began. I was outside, in a forest. I knew the forest. It was one I had been to before. I knew what was in it. I knew what would happen next.\n\nI closed my eyes and knew it would begin. I closed my eyes and waited for it to happen. It always did.\n\nI felt a pain in my chest as I was hit with the daydream. I could feel it. I could feel it happening. I could feel my life slipping away as I watched.\n\nI opened my eyes and screamed as I felt my body begin to fall. I screamed as I felt my life slipping away. I screamed as I watched.\n\nAnd then it was over. I was dead. I couldn't wake up. I couldn't move. I couldn't stop it. All I could do was wait for the next day.\n\nI had been caught up in a lucid dream. I was aware I was dreaming. I knew it was a dream. And I knew it was a lucid dream.\n\nI had been lucid dreaming since I was a child. It was normal. I could do it. And I was able to control them as I was dreaming. It was why lucid dreams were valuable.\n\nBut the lucid dreams were also why they were worth so much. People would pay a fortune to cause the lucid dreams. They would pay a fortune to use a lucid dreamer. And they would pay to control the lucid dreams.\n\nI didn't know why. I didn't know what they did. But I knew it happened. I knew it was happening. And I knew that the lucid dreams were worth something.\n\nThe lucid dreams didn't have the same effect on the dreamer as the normal daydreams did. They didn't feel the same. But they still did something. They still affected the dreamer in a way that was different from normal daydreams.\n\nThe lucid dreams were also more dangerous than normal daydreams. They didn't just cause the daydreaming. They caused it to happen in a different way. They caused the daydreaming to be more intense and more disturbing.\n\nI didn't know how it happened. I didn't know why it happened. But I knew that it did. And I knew it was happening.\n\nThe lucid dreams were the most valuable thing I had. And the lucid dreams were my death. I knew it was happening. And I knew I couldn't stop it.\n\nI knew the lucid dreams were why I would die. I knew they were why people wanted to hire me. I knew they were why the lucid dreams were worth so much.\n\nI didn't know how to control them. I didn't know how to stop them. I didn't know how to do anything except live through them.\n\nBut I knew one thing. I was going to be found out. I was going to be caught. I was going to die. And I knew that it was coming. I knew it was inevitable.\n\nI tried to ignore it as it happened. I tried to focus on something else. I tried to distract myself.\n\nI tried to look around. I tried to look around and see what I was dreaming about. I tried to look around and see if there was anything in the dream that I could control.\n\nI tried to focus on something else. I tried to focus on something else and make myself more aware.\n\nBut I couldn't. I couldn't focus. I couldn't control. All I could do was watch.\n\nAnd then the lucid dream ended. I woke up and found myself lying on the floor.\n\nI had been asleep for hours. And I knew it was coming. I knew I would die.\n\nAnd I knew that I would be found out. I knew that I would be caught. I knew that I would be used.\n\nBut I couldn't do anything to stop it. All I could do was wait. All I could do was know that it was happening."

        "pred_story": "Alden leaned against the wall, his eyes closing as he let his mind wander. It wasn't the first time he'd been on guard duty; it was the eleventh. He'd grown tired of the routine, the same watch pattern day in and day out. The same drills, the same formations, the same endless marching. Alden felt a bit numb, having been on the front lines with the same squad for nigh on three years. They were lucky; few squads remained as whole as his for so long.\n\nThe sun was high overhead, the sky clear of clouds. A gentle breeze drifted through the fort's gates, carrying the smell of the grasslands beyond the palisade. The fort's wall stretched towards the horizon, the palisade's slats lined up perfectly. The gates were covered in a thick layer of mud, which would prevent invaders from attacking the fort with siege engines or catapults. Each gate had its own post, with the same two guards, Jax and Alric, standing outside as they did every hour.\n\nAlden checked his pocket watch. It was time for a checkup. The door creaked open, allowing a tall figure dressed in black to enter. She wore a helmet made of a black metal Alden had never seen before, a mask covering most of her face. She was a strange sight, one he'd only seen once before.\n\n\"Check time,\" she called out.\n\nAlden put a finger in his ear, turning the watch over and glancing at it. He nodded at her, and the guard closed the door behind her. The two sat down at the long table in the center of the room, their shoulders pressed to the walls as they watched the other. There was a silence between them, one that neither seemed to mind.\n\n\"So, how are you?\" she asked, breaking the silence.\n\n\"I'm fine,\" Alden replied, turning the watch over again. \"Just bored.\"\n\n\"Same old same old, huh?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I don't mind the drills too much. They help me keep in shape. But the same thing every day does get a bit old.\"\n\n\"Same here, actually. I got stuck at the bottom of the tower a few years ago.\"\n\n\"Wasn't that supposed to be a punishment?\"\n\n\"It was. I didn't know that at the time, though. Anyway, it was pretty bad. I was stuck there for six months until they found me. The only thing I could do to keep myself entertained was talk. So I talked to myself and the other soldiers stationed there.\"\n\n\"That sounds tough.\"\n\n\"It wasn't the best time. You, on the other hand, seem like you're having a great time.\"\n\n\"Oh, no. It's just a bit boring at times.\"\n\n\"It's not the same as getting to see the world.\"\n\nAlden nodded. \"Yeah, I guess not. I just wish I could see what's outside the walls. The only things that come into the walls are birds, and even they're rare. I heard they're very common outside.\"\n\n\"Yes, they are. They're not much to look at, but they're a good start. Anyway, I don't mean to pry.\"\n\n\"It's fine. It's no big deal. Anyway, I guess I should get back to my station.\"\n\nThe guard nodded at him. \"You go ahead, then. I'll let the others know that it's your last checkup before you go.\"\n\nAlden smiled slightly. \"Thanks. And sorry to bore you.\"\n\n\"No, it's fine. Just feel free to come up here if you need to talk to someone.\" The guard nodded at him, and he left his station and headed to the next one.\n\nThe sun was high when Alden returned to his station. He leaned against the wall once more, letting his mind wander. The guard was gone by the time he got there, leaving behind only her helmet and mask. Alden frowned, glancing at the door before he shrugged and picked up the helmet. He turned it over in his hands, wondering what it might be made of. The metal was incredibly hard, and Alden could only scratch it with the blade on his dagger. He was still pondering the metal's properties when he heard a voice behind him.\n\n\"Hello?\" Alden turned, his eyes locking onto a pair of eyes. They were an unusual color, a mix of blue and green that Alden had never seen. \"I saw you picking up my helmet.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" Alden replied, slowly standing up. \"I wasn't sure what it was, but it seemed too interesting to pass up.\"\n\nThe woman chuckled, her voice high-pitched and rich. \"I can understand that,\" she said. \"My name is Gwynevere. What's yours?\"\n\n\"Alden,\" he replied, smiling. \"Nice to meet you.\"\n\nThe same smiled back, her teeth perfectly aligned in a perfect smile. Alden found himself mesmerized, unable to look away. She seemed to be drinking in every detail, her eyes lingering on every part of his face.\n\n\"Same to you, Alden.\" She glanced at her hands before clenching them into fists. \"I'm sorry. I'm just a bit... nervous.\"\n\n\"Why is that?\"\n\nGwynevere shook her head. \"I don't know. It's just my first time outside these walls, and the other soldiers are a bit more... unpredictable. I know that's not a great word to describe people, but...\"\n\n\"Wait,\" Alden said, raising a finger to his ear. \"I think I know what you mean.\"\n\n\"I don't think you do,\" Gwynevere replied, her eyes narrowing slightly.\n\n\"Of course I do. You're one of the enforcers, aren't you?\"\n\nGwynevere's eyes narrowed further, and her jaw clenched. \"What?\"\n\n\"You're the one I see on the tower,\" Alden said, tapping the watch in his pocket. \"The one who checks up on us and gives us advice. You're one of the most interesting people I've ever met.\"\n\nGwynevere looked at him for a long time before her face softened. \"I guess I should be flattered,\" she said. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"No need to thank me,\" Alden replied. \"I just wanted to tell the truth.\"\n\n\"No, I really think there's no need. But I guess it's nice to finally meet you.\"\n\n\"It's nice to finally meet you too,\" Alden said, smiling. He reached out and touched her face, feeling a strange tingle run through his body. \"Thank you for visiting me.\"\n\nGwynevere smiled back. \"No, thank you. I really enjoyed talking to you.\"\n\n\"Same here.\" Alden turned back to the wall, but he didn't feel the same sense of boredom as he did before. He looked at the helmet on the ground beside him, wondering if he would ever see the woman again."

        "pred_story": "It was an easy spell. Just a flick of my wrist, and a small burst of magic would be unleashed onto the target. The magic wouldn't affect the target directly. Instead, it would go to the target's mind. A spell of clarity and focus. One that would stop the target's thoughts from clouding with fear. One that would give the target a clear head.\n\nIt was my first spell of clarity, but I wasn't really worried about it. After all, my instructor, Arachne, had told me that it was a very simple spell. She had also told me that I had a natural talent for magic, and that I should focus on honing that talent.\n\nMy instructor had told me to cast the spell on a small target. Not a person, but something like a small ball of wood or something. But I didn't have a ball of wood on me. So instead, I decided to cast the spell on myself. I had a lot of fear about this whole thing. What if the magic got out of control? What if I did something wrong?\n\nBut as I cast the spell, nothing went wrong. I felt a surge of magic flow through my body. It felt like a rush of wind, but I didn't feel it. Not in the way a normal person would feel wind. I felt it all throughout my body. A rush of power. A rush of energy. A rush of clarity.\n\nWhen I finished the spell, I could feel it. I could feel the magic coursing through my body. I could feel the clarity that the magic brought. But more importantly, I could feel the absence of fear. The fear that had filled my body before the spell was gone. Replaced by a sense of calm and focus. A sense of clearness.\n\n\"Wow,\" I said to myself. \"That was a lot easier than I thought it would be.\" The spell of clarity was my third spell. I had been practicing for a week now, and each day had been more impressive than the last. I had started with something simple. A simple spell of light. One that would give me a small burst of light that would last for a few seconds. A spell that would help me practice the basics of magic.\n\nThen, I had moved on to a spell of movement. A spell that would allow me to move objects with my magic. A spell that would require a lot more control and finesse than the first spell.\n\nNow, I was trying a spell of clarity. A spell that would help me get rid of distractions. A spell that would help me focus. A spell that was much harder to cast than my previous two spells.\n\nBut it had worked. And it had worked well. I felt a sense of calm and focus. A sense of clarity. A sense that had eluded me for so long. The fear that had plagued me for so long had been gone. Replaced by a sense of calm and focus.\n\nAnd then, it hit me. The realization that I had finally found something I was good at. Something that I enjoyed. Something that made me feel alive. Something that I wanted to continue doing. It made me realize that there were more things out there for me. That there were more spells to learn and to master. More objects to move with my magic.\n\nIt made me want to continue practicing. To continue honing my magic. To continue perfecting my skills. To continue doing something that I was good at. To continue doing something that made me feel alive. To continue doing something that brought me joy. I could feel it all throughout my body. The joy of discovery. The joy of discovery that I had finally found something I was good at.\n\nAnd then, it hit me again. The realization that I had finally found something I enjoyed. Something that I was good at. Something that I wanted to continue doing. Something that made me feel alive. Something that I was passionate about. It made me realize that there were more things out there for me.\n\nThat there were more spells to learn and to master. More objects to move with my magic. More objects to affect with my magic. It made me want to continue practicing. To continue honing my magic. To continue perfecting my skills. To continue doing something that I was good at. To continue doing something that made me feel alive. To continue doing something that brought me joy.\n\n\"Wow,\" I said to myself. \"I had no idea I was this good at this.\" It was easy to cast. It was easy to master. It was easy to perfect. It was easy to get it right. And it was easy to get wrong. A fact that I had learned the hard way.\n\nI had tried the spell once before, but I had failed. I had failed miserably. I had cast the spell, but instead of getting the desired result, the spell had caused a small explosion. One that had caused a small crater in the ground. A crater that had surprised me. A crater that had gotten me in trouble.\n\nBut today, I had gotten it right. I had cast the spell, and it had worked. I had gotten the desired result. The result that I had been going for. The result that I had been practicing. The result that I had been perfecting. The result that I had been working towards.\n\nIt had been a long journey. A journey that had taken me months to complete. But it had been worth it. I had learned a lot on my journey. I had learned a lot about magic. I had learned a lot about myself. And I had learned a lot about the world. But now, I had reached my destination."

        "pred_story": "\"I see what you mean,\" said Henry. \"We're not the only survivors of this pandemic. Most people aren't immune to the bite. We should ask the others if they want to be in our alliance.\"\n\n\"There is no cure to this virus,\" said a new voice. \"There is no vaccine, nor medicine to treat it. As it eats your internal organs, your cells, it corrupts them until you're a monster. It changes your mind, your thoughts until you only have one.\"\n\nHenry and his group were in a large room, mostly dead and in a state of disarray. The floor had been cleaned by the survivors, and the walls and ceiling had been reinforced by reinforced pillars and bars. It had been turned into a shelter for those who had survived the initial outbreak, and now into a place for all survivors to take refuge.\n\n\"This is true,\" said Henry. \"However, what do you propose we do? How do we kill them off? They are too many for us to kill one by one, and we do not have enough resources for a fight.\"\n\n\"We can use the resources we have,\" said the new speaker. \"We can have them kill each other off. Then we can kill what is left.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure that's a good idea,\" said one of Henry's men. \"We've seen what they look like. You know they can be fast, too fast for us to catch. They can run on all fours and climb trees, and they can swim in the ocean. And they're not alone, there are countless of them out there.\"\n\n\"It is the only way, you know it,\" said the new speaker. \"We cannot win in a fight, not against so many. But we can make the zombies kill themselves. They need humans for the virus to infect them, to multiply. There are some things we can use to give them what they need.\"\n\n\"We know of that,\" said Henry. \"But we must be careful in our use of it. We cannot make a mistake in this. We need their help to survive.\"\n\n\"Agreed, that is why we must be careful. But how do you plan on using them?\"\n\n\"We can't let them know about the alliance,\" said Henry. \"But we need their help. They must know that we are here to be our last hope.\"\n\n\"So what do you propose? How do you plan on making them see that we are not a threat, and that we will help each other?\"\n\n\"We will have to show them,\" said Henry. \"We will have to show them that we are not a threat, that we only want to survive. We will have to tell them that our alliance is to prevent both our species from becoming extinct. We will have to tell them of the zombies.\"\n\n\"That will only make them hate us more,\" said Henry's man. \"They don't care about survival. All they need is to feed on us.\"\n\n\"They are already thinking of us as food,\" said Henry. \"So we have to show them that we are not a threat. We will have to tell them that we will be feeding on them. That we will be eating their bodies, and that they must do the same.\"\n\n\"That will only make them attack us,\" said Henry's man.\n\n\"No, we will show them that we will be eating only the dead. The zombies. That we will not touch their kind.\"\n\n\"But they have no kind,\" said Henry. \"They are already dead.\"\n\n\"That is why they are so angry with us,\" said the new speaker. \"They are the dead, and we are the living. But we can show them that we are only trying to survive. They can see that we are in need of their help. And we can give them what they want in return. We can give them the bodies of the dead, so they can feast on them. We can give them what they need to survive. So they can eat and we can eat.\"\n\n\"Then let us do it,\" said Henry. \"Let us make the alliance, and show them our proposal.\"\n\nHenry looked at his men, then at the new speaker, and then at the zombies, who were standing in a line at the entrance of the room, watching them all.\n\n\"Yes, let us do it,\" said Henry. \"Let us form the alliance, and show the zombies that we are not a threat. Let us show them that we only want to survive. And let us show them that we will not be a threat to them. That we only want to be able to live with them, and that we will be eating only the dead. That we will be feeding on them, and they will be feeding on us.\"\n\n\"You don't really believe you can feed on the dead, do you?\" said his man.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Henry. \"We need their help. We need to make them see that we will only be eating the dead. That we will not be eating their kind. They can see that we are in need of their help. And we can give them what they want in return. We can give them the bodies of the dead, so they can feast on them.\"\n\n\"But it's not the same,\" said Henry's man. \"We can't eat the dead. We can't survive without the living.\"\n\n\"It is the only way,\" said the new speaker. \"The only way to survive.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Henry. \"The only way to survive. If we do not make the alliance, we will all be extinct. And they must be our last hope. And we must use them, and we must show them that we are not a threat. We must show them that we are only trying to survive. And we must make them see that we will not be a threat. That we will only be eating the dead, and that we will be feeding on them. That they will be feeding on us, and we will be feeding on them.\"\n\n\"We can't eat the dead,\" said his man.\n\n\"Then we will have to come up with another way,\" said Henry. \"A way to make them understand what we need, and that we need them. We must show them that we are only trying to survive, and that we will be eating only the dead. That we will be feeding on the dead, and they will be feeding on us.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said his man. \"Why are we making this alliance?\"\n\n\"Because we need their help,\" said Henry. \"We can't survive on our own. We can't feed on the dead. And we need them to be our last hope.\"\n\n\"But you can't eat the dead.\"\n\n\"Then we will have to come up with another way,\" said Henry. \"A way to make them understand what we need, and that we need them. We must show them that we are only trying to survive, and that we will be eating only the dead. That we will be feeding on the dead, and they will be feeding on us.\"\n\nHenry walked out of the room with his men, and the new speaker followed him. He walked to a door in the back of the room, and opened it, and then stepped aside, and revealed a large room filled with zombies, who were standing in a line and watching them. And then he stepped forward, and greeted them.\n\n\"Welcome, we have been waiting for you,\" said Henry"

It\u2019s a large, mutated, insectoid monstrosity, created to hunt down and eliminate all of humanity. The plan was brilliant, and the execution perfect. No one suspected a thing, as the virus spread, changing us all from the inside out. The only part of the plan that didn\u2019t work as intended was the part where we killed all the humans.\n\n\u201cHumans will bond with anything,\u201d you say again, \u201cso why do they resist our efforts to integrate with them?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to,\u201d you explain to the thing, \u201cit\u2019s just that they\u2019re too busy trying to survive.

You see excitement in its\u2019 eyes. You see hunger in its\u2019 eyes. The thing is no longer thinking about you, or the conversation that you\u2019re having. It\u2019s not thinking about the integration process, or the virus that you created. No, it\u2019s thinking about something else. Something else entirely. It\u2019s thinking about the humans. You see its\u2019 mouth move, but you don\u2019t hear the words. The thing is too far away for you to hear it. It\u2019s mouth is moving, and you see its\u2019 lips form words. You hear its\u2019 thoughts, and you can see the excitement building inside of it. It\u2019s thinking about its\u2019 prey, and it\u2019s going to get them, all of them. All of the humans that survive the virus, it\u2019s going to hunt them down and kill them. It\u2019s going to eat them, all of them. It\u2019s going to eat them all, then it\u2019s going to do it again. It\u2019s going to keep eating, until it\u2019s gone. You see something else in its\u2019 eyes, and you realize that this wasn\u2019t a plan. It was never a plan. This was just a natural thing. A natural thing to do. It just wanted to eat. It just wanted to kill. The thing doesn\u2019t just want to hunt the humans down. It wants to feast on them. It wants to kill them, then it wants to eat them.

You\u2019re a disappointment. It\u2019s time for you to move on.\u201d\n\n\u201cMove on?\u201d I repeated incredulously. \u201cWhere am I supposed to go? We\u2019ve been cut off from everyone outside. There\u2019s no one else to go to. How am I supposed to live?\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously,\u201d my mother snapped, \u201cyou can\u2019t. Not as a useless non-powerless person. I thought the worst part was over when you got married, but now you\u2019re having a child?\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t that count for anything?\u201d I demanded. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to see your grandchild?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re being selfish, Elara,\u201d she repeated. \u201cThis child isn\u2019t yours.

        "pred_story": "\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re going to be okay? It\u2019s really weird to have you live here.\u201d\n\nRachel frowned slightly, looking at me as I quickly changed into the outfit I had planned. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll be fine. Honestly, I don\u2019t want to be any more of a burden than I already am. So, I\u2019m good. I\u2019ll be out of here soon and you can have your room back.\u201d\n\nSighing, she looked around at the empty room. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re taking my room or anything. There\u2019s plenty of space here. Besides, I know your mom is going to freak out if you\u2019re not in a human dorm. If you\u2019re okay with it, I can ask if she can live here with me. She can have the room you\u2019re taking. I\u2019ll move into one of the rooms in the dorms with the other humans.\u201d\n\nI quickly scoffed, seeing a hint of a smile on her face. \u201cNo. Absolutely not. You know that would cause more problems than it solves. If she finds out I\u2019m living here, she\u2019ll make sure you get kicked out. And if you\u2019re okay with moving, then the decision is yours to make. Not mine. I\u2019m not going to ask you to do something that will be really difficult on you.\u201d\n\nShe looked back at me, clearly considering the offer. \u201cWhat would my mom do? Would she know if I moved here?\u201d\n\nI grimaced. \u201cMost likely. If anything, she would find out and be mad, then you and her would argue. There\u2019s a good chance she would find out you\u2019re here and the whole family would end up in a fight. I\u2019ve already caused enough drama this semester. I\u2019m going to take a chance and hope that you can stay here. If anything, I can stay here for a few days and then find another place, just so you can have your room back.\u201d\n\nLooking at her, I could see the hint of guilt on her face. \u201cI really can\u2019t thank you enough for this. I know it\u2019s been really weird this semester.\u201d\n\n\u201cBelieve me, it\u2019s not like I had a choice. If anything, this semester has been a weird experience. But it\u2019s been nice having you here. I think I\u2019m finally starting to get used to living in this dorm.\u201d I took one last look around the room, \u201cIt was really nice living here. Good luck and keep in touch. I hope you get through the semester okay.\u201d\n\nTaking one last look around the room, I turned and left. Rachel had already left, but I could hear her talking in the next room. Turning the corner, I caught sight of a man in the hallway. He was tall, easily six feet tall, and appeared to be in his mid-twenties. He was dressed in a black t-shirt and jeans, with his hair styled in a messy manner. Looking at me briefly, he smiled, \u201cHey, you\u2019re the human that\u2019s been living in Rachel\u2019s room, right?\u201d\n\nI nodded, not knowing what to say. He laughed, \u201cI know. She told me about you a bit ago. I was wondering if I could ask you a question.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, of course. I\u2019m happy to answer anything you ask.\u201d\n\nHis smile grew, \u201cCool. I wanted to know if you had any tips on how to handle people who think we are monsters. I think that might be part of the reason she was living in the room you\u2019re taking.\u201d\n\nI frowned, \u201cYou mean because I\u2019m human?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. So, what\u2019s the best way to deal with people who think they\u2019re better than you or that you\u2019re some kind of monster? I hate it when I have to deal with people like that.\u201d\n\nI frowned, \u201cThat\u2019s a weird question to ask me. I\u2019m just a regular human. What could I possibly know?\u201d\n\nHis smile grew wider, \u201cBelieve me, you know way more than you think you do. You\u2019re living in a monster dorm, you\u2019ve got to know something about us. I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nShaking my head, I sighed, \u201cYes, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m a bit more aware than I probably should be. But the thing is, most people who live here don\u2019t think of themselves as monsters. Some do, but most don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, \u201cYeah. I can understand that. I\u2019m the only one of my kind in my family. We don\u2019t really think of ourselves as monsters, either.\u201d\n\nWe stood there for a moment, not saying anything. Then, he asked, \u201cSo, what do you know about humans? How do you think we should handle people like that?\u201d\n\nI smiled, \u201cHonestly? I think the best way to handle them is with kindness and understanding. But if you think you need to be harsh, I don\u2019t blame you for that. We\u2019ve got our own stereotypes about monsters. The only difference is that we tend to think we\u2019re better than you. But if you think you need to show them we\u2019re not monsters, I\u2019d be happy to help you.\u201d\n\nHe smiled, \u201cI think I would be okay with that. If you\u2019re not too busy, I\u2019d love to go to the cafeteria with you later tonight. I haven\u2019t had a chance to eat any human food since I got here.\u201d\n\nI chuckled, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had plenty of human food. I\u2019m sure the food here is delicious. But yeah, that sounds fun. What do you say we meet up in the common room later tonight and have a chat about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds perfect. I\u2019ll see you later. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLikewise. See you soon.\u201d\n\nTurning, we both went in our respective directions, smiling to each other. As we did, I could feel a spark of electricity. It was clear, he had felt it too."

        "pred_story": "The adoption process was weird. But honestly, it was kind of fun. I\u2019d always thought about adopting a kid, but I was never really sure how to go about it. I didn\u2019t know how to pick a kid, how to get in touch with them, all that jazz. I guess that\u2019s why I ended up doing what everyone else does: I adopted a kid from the foster system.\n\nBut that was when I met them.\n\nI was sitting in a crowded waiting room. The other adopters were all staring at me. That was fine, I wasn\u2019t here for them. I was here for them. And, man, was it going to be a problem. I was only 32, so my little one wasn\u2019t exactly little. They were\u2026well, they were ten.\n\nBut I had always said that I wanted to adopt a kid around that age. And they were a good age. They were old enough to know how to behave, but still young enough to learn how to do everything. And, man, did they know how to do everything. I mean, they were literally *better* at everything than I was. It was kind of frustrating, but also kind of fun. And it was amazing seeing how well they adjusted.\n\nI was the third parent to arrive that day, and the third person to be adopted. They adopted the first kid and their mom, and then the couple next to me adopted a girl. And then it was just me, and then me and the little kid.\n\nThe little kid looked at me and smiled, and then turned away. The mother turned to me and smiled. \u201cI know my kid can be a little bit of a problem,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s a handful. But I think you two will be fine. I can see it in her eyes. She loves you already.\u201d\n\nI smiled, and then the woman and her partner left. I turned to the little kid and smiled. \u201cHey,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m your dad.\u201d She turned to me and smiled, and then looked down at her feet. \u201cHi,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m your daughter.\u201d\n\nI nodded, and then sat down on the chair. \u201cSo,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re quite the kid.\u201d She looked up at me and smiled, and then looked away. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI am.\u201d\n\nIt was nice to meet her. But at least she was a ten-year-old.\n\nThat was when I realized. I was only 32, and I had adopted a ten-year-old who was probably smarter than I was. So I started looking around for someone to teach me things. But the thing is, she was already learning them on her own. She was like a little sponge, and she was soaking up all the information around her. I had already forgotten how to do most things, but she remembered them all. And she was doing them all faster than me. I had to admit, it was kind of cool. She was basically a little superkid.\n\nBut still, I wanted to teach her. So I started looking around for her teacher. But she was already a teacher. She knew everything I knew, and more. And she was teaching me the things I didn\u2019t know. She was like my own personal teacher. But I couldn\u2019t have picked her better if I tried. She was the perfect kid.\n\nAnd I loved her.\n\nIt\u2019s funny. I never thought I would be a dad at 32. But now that it\u2019s happened, I\u2019m glad that I did. Sure, she\u2019s not like my friends\u2019 kids. She\u2019s not like most kids. But still, she\u2019s a great kid. She\u2019s a wonderful kid. And I\u2019m going to love her until my death. And she\u2019s going to learn all the things I know, and more. And she\u2019s going to be smarter than me, and all the kids in school. She\u2019s going to be a little superkid, and she\u2019s going to love me too."

        "pred_story": "\u201cAre you serious?\u201d The kid in the doorway stared, the words catching in the air between them, leaving behind only the faintest whisper of horror and disbelief.\n\n\u201cI am.\u201d My smile tightened. My teeth were still straight, but my eyes felt sharp. My skin felt thick, almost impenetrable. I had become so accustomed to the mask of humanity.\n\n\u201cMom?\u201d The girl by my side looked at me like I\u2019d lost my mind. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why is he freaking out?\u201d\n\nThe boy, tall and lanky, eyes wide and staring like he\u2019d just realized the sun had turned to stone, shuffled backward as I stood, my chair scraping against the wall. His eyes stayed fixed on me, and I could see his mind racing, trying to process. *It can\u2019t be. This can\u2019t be happening.*\n\nI sighed, feeling my humanity slipping, the way it always did in the face of fear and horror. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, honey. He doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nThe girl\u2019s eyebrows furrowed. She was so much like me, young, innocent. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he understand?\u201d She asked, her brow furrowing.\n\n\u201cLook, honey, I need you to go sit in your room and watch TV for a bit. I\u2019ll go talk to your dad.\u201d\n\nThe girl\u2019s face contorted in protest, but I grabbed her shoulder and spun her, giving her a gentle push toward her room. Her father\u2019s secret had been safe, kept well hidden from her, but now...\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain later, sweetie. Just go.\u201d I whispered.\n\nShe narrowed her eyes, but I could see the confusion and fear there, and I knew she would obey. As she left, the boy finally found his voice.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d I spun, but he didn\u2019t move. \u201cWait,\u201d he repeated, his voice barely above a whisper. \u201cYou can\u2019t be real.\u201d His words were laced with a desperation, an attempt to cling to reality. \u201cYou\u2019re my friend, you\u2019re-\u201c He cut himself off, his eyes darting to the girl\u2019s room as she locked her door. \u201cOh God,\u201d he muttered.\n\nI nodded. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019s found out.\u201d The realization was like a punch to the gut. *It can\u2019t be.*\n\nThe boy slowly took a step forward, his hand out, hesitant. \u201cIs that really you?\u201d He asked, his voice barely audible.\n\nI laughed, the sound thick, almost primal. \u201cWho am I?\u201d I asked, feeling the weight of my words, feeling the mask of humanity crack.\n\nHe shook his head. \u201cYou,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re a monster.\u201d\n\nI sighed, my eyes running with tears. \u201cI\u2019m your father,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The words burned, but they needed to be said. I looked down at my hands, feeling the shift, the transformation that had occurred. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I began to rise, and he didn\u2019t move. I didn\u2019t need to. I knew he would run.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d he said, and I could hear the pleading in his voice. \u201cTell me,\u201d he asked. \u201cTell me what happened to you. To us. To her.\u201d\n\nI paused. I hadn\u2019t thought about this part. \u201cI was once like you,\u201d I started. \u201cHumans thought I was a monster because of my appearance, because of my abilities.\u201d I could feel the shift happening within me, feel my body stretching, twisting, my senses amplifying. \u201cThe world didn\u2019t understand me, and I was tired of being feared and hated.\u201d I looked at my son. \u201cAnd then I saw you two,\u201d I said, my voice cracking. \u201cYou were so happy, so full of life, and I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of losing you. I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of being alone again.\u201d I smiled, feeling tears roll down my face. \u201cSo I made a choice. A choice to become like you.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike me?\u201d He repeated.\n\n\u201cYes, like you.\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight of the words. \u201cI can die.\u201d\n\nHis eyes widened, and I could see the realization wash over him. *It\u2019s not possible,* he thought. *There is no way.*\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he said, his voice shaking. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nI nodded again. \u201cI made a choice to sacrifice myself, to become human, so that I could be with you and your mother. I wanted to be a part of your life, to watch you grow. And it worked.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut...but you...\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whispered, feeling the tears fall harder now. \u201cI know that I shouldn\u2019t have kept this from you, but I wanted to be with you. I wanted to be your father.\u201d\n\nHis eyes dropped, and I knew he couldn\u2019t comprehend the sacrifice. He didn\u2019t know what it was to be a monster, to be hated and feared by the world. He didn\u2019t understand why I had made this choice, but I knew he would see that it was worth it. \u201cAnd what about her?\u201d He asked. \u201cShe\u2019s the only one who understands.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s my wife. She\u2019s the one who helped me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d he said, his voice quiet. \u201cWhat did you mean?\u201d He looked at me. \u201cWhen you said, *she\u2019s the only one who understands.*\u201d\n\nI took a deep breath. \u201cShe\u2019s like me. She\u2019s one of us.\u201d\n\nThe boy\u2019s face tightened. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\nI looked at him, seeing him for the first time. He was the only one I had left, and I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of losing him too. \u201cShe\u2019s a monster.\u201d\n\nThe silence that followed was deafening. He was in shock, his mind racing to comprehend this new information. \u201cI need to go talk to Mom.\u201d His voice was firm, almost hard. \u201cNow.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cGo,\u201d I said. I couldn\u2019t stop him. I didn\u2019t want to stop him. But I would never let him take her away from me again."

        "pred_story": "The group lay around our feet as they succumbed to their injuries.  They had fought hard, I could tell that.  Still, they were outmatched, no matter how hard they fought.  Their efforts had only made it worse for all of them, and now they laid at the base of the circle as the ritual completed.  I did not know what to feel, as I watched the ritual complete.  The summoning was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen, a storm of pure white and yellow light that seemed to dance around the group as they tried to stop it.  As soon as they fell, the light faded, and I looked around at the group.  They were gone, except for the circle.  It was an odd feeling, watching the ritual complete with no one there to stop it.  It was as if I had been watching someones else's story for months, and it had finally reached the end.  And as I looked around, trying to figure out what to do next, I noticed the sticky note on the ground.  It had a message written on it, in dark red ink.  \"Yeah, sorry guys. Apocalypse cancelled. Just not feeling it anymore.\"  I looked at the note, unsure of what to do with it.  It was a message from the dark god, I thought.  What was the message, though?  And why was it written on a sticky note?  Had he not realized that we were just a group of teenagers?  Were we really supposed to be the ones who would summon an apocalypse?  The world was ending, and no one had even told us about it.  And now that it had happened, no one had told us that it was cancelled either.  The whole thing was messed up.  And besides, who says no to an apocalypse?  Sure, the one that we had been trying to stop had been pretty bad, but who says no to something that would have given us more time to get things right?  And besides, a cancelled apocalypse was no apocalypse at all, not anymore.  It was just a waste of time and resources, a pointless end to something that we were ready to give up on.  And with no apocalypse, what would we have left?  All of the old ways, that no one believed in anymore?  No, the apocalypse was the only thing that we had left now.  It was our only hope, our only chance.  And now that it had been cancelled, I was left with no options.  What was I supposed to do now?  Wait around and hope that something better would come along?  Or should I just do my own thing, and make something better come along?  If that was the only way that anything good could happen, then so be it.  It was time for me to make my own way, my own destiny.  If no one else was going to, then I would do it myself.  I looked at the sticky note, as I stood up.  \"Yeah, sorry guys. Apocalypse cancelled. Just not feeling it anymore.\"  It was a message, not a command.  A reminder, not a threat.  An option, not a necessity.  I looked at the note again, and smiled.  The apocalypse may have been cancelled, but it was still an option.  And I had no problem with that."

        "pred_story": "\"It is the same old curse every year,\" a woman grumbled as she watched the man she was holding onto turn into a werewolf. \"You would think you would come up with a better curse than this.\" She said as she let out a sigh. \"If they knew you were doing this, you would be dead.\" She said as she placed her hands into her pants pocket.\n\nThe man she was holding onto was starting to struggle against her grip. His hands were turning into paws but they were still quite sharp. She knew this first hand as his last two attacks had shredded her pants. She was starting to think that she would have to take him to work like this. \"Shh, I am sorry but it is the best I could come up with,\" she whispered. She was starting to sound like a mother comforting her crying child.\n\nThe werewolf shook his head as he struggled against her grip. \"I was expecting something a little more creative,\" he growled. He was starting to lose control of himself. \"I mean come on, a werewolf transformation curse? How many times can a person go to the same place only to get bitten or clawed.\" He was starting to sound like a spoiled little boy. \"I mean think about it, I have gone to the same bar for the past four years and have gotten bitten every year. It is time for something new.\"\n\nThe woman shook her head. \"You don't know how hard it is to make a good curse. If I come up with a good curse and you tell the people who know you are cursed, you will be dead. And if you aren't dead, you could be maimed. This curse has been in the family for centuries and has served its purpose well,\" she said with a hint of pride in her voice. \"The people who live around here have grown accustomed to this curse. You can't expect them to change who they are to try and accommodate you.\"\n\nThe werewolf shook his head and growled. \"It is the same old curse every year. I turn into a werewolf, you turn into the black cat of doom, your sister turns into a pumpkin, your brother turns into a bat. The whole town turns into a bunch of goofy animals and monsters. There are no surprises.\" He shook his head again. \"Why couldn't you just change the curse every year. And don't try to tell me it is too hard. It can't be that hard to change the curse to something more creative.\"\n\nThe woman sighed and started to shake her head. \"Look, let me tell you something,\" she said. \"I am not some evil witch who is trying to cause harm to the townspeople. I am a member of this community and my curse has caused this town to thrive. It is the curse of Halloween night. I do this every year and it has been going well for centuries.\" She could feel the werewolf getting more agitated as she started her speech. \"Every year the townspeople work together and come up with a new and exciting idea to make the most of this curse. They have done it so many times that they have started to come up with new ideas every year. You aren't the only one who has had to live through this curse for many years. Every one of the townspeople is cursed and every one of us has to live with the same old curse every year.\"\n\nThe werewolf shook his head and snarled. \"I don't care. If this curse is going to be the same every year, then I need something to change it. You have the power to do so and I need you to change it.\" He shook his head as he took a step closer to her. \"So what do I have to do to get you to change this curse. Do I have to pay you?\" He sounded like a little boy who was asking his mother for some money for a new toy.\n\nThe woman shook her head and sighed. \"You know, I will take you to my house and cook you some dinner if you want. I am sure my sister will be happy to cook you up some of her pumpkin soup if you want.\" She knew he was trying to get something out of her and she wasn't going to give in to his demands. \"But you have to understand that the curse is for Halloween night only. You won't have to worry about it the rest of the year.\"\n\nThe werewolf nodded and turned into his human form. \"That sounds great. I would love to see your house and have some dinner.\" He nodded and then looked at the woman. \"And I would love to meet your sister,\" he said as he smiled.\n\nThe woman smiled and nodded. \"You will love my sister. She is very friendly and cooks well.\" She nodded and then looked around. \"But we can't go to my house right now. It is a little too crowded.\" She looked up at the sky and gasped as she realized how crowded the street was. \"It is Halloween night, isn't it?\" She looked at the werewolf who nodded. She looked at her pocket watch and realized that it was getting close to midnight. \"We can't go to my house now. It will be too crowded. We can go when things settle down.\" She looked up at the sky and saw people of all ages dressed in costume and running around. It was Halloween night and she knew that people would be going out and having fun until the morning.\n\nThe werewolf looked at her with a sad expression. \"I can't wait to see you again. I will be back tomorrow to visit your house and meet your sister.\" He smiled at her as he turned and ran into the crowd.\n\nThe woman watched him go and then smiled. \"I know he will come back,\" she said as she smiled and then started to walk back home."

        "pred_story": "The knock came three minutes shy of midnight. The only one home was Emily, and she was sound asleep on her bed, nose scrunched up against the window as if trying to make it smaller by sheer willpower.\n\nThe knock came again, louder. She felt a shiver run down her spine as the bedroom door opened, light from the hallway spilling into her room. For a second she forgot to breathe.\n\nHer mother entered, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. \"It's fine, Emily. That was just me. I forgot my keys and had to run down to the car and get them.\" She paused in the doorway, looking at her daughter. \"What are you doing awake?\"\n\nEmily gestured toward the window. \"I heard someone out there. I don't know why, but I just couldn't sleep.\"\n\nHer mother nodded sympathetically. \"Well, go back to sleep. It's probably just a stray animal or something.\"\n\nEmily nodded and settled back into her bed. Her mother paused in the doorway, looking at her for another second before continuing down the hallway.\n\nEmily waited until she heard the front door close. That was when she felt her phone buzz, an incoming call. She picked it up, her heart racing.\n\n\"No, no, no, no, no.\" She whispered, staring at the screen. A text from an unknown number. \"I don't know you, so don't know me.\"\n\nThe text had one message. \"We need to talk. Come outside now.\"\n\nShe hesitated for a moment, before tossing her phone aside and throwing on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. She felt like a kid again, sneaking out to meet up with her best friend and getting into mischief.\n\nShe made her way quietly down the stairs, glancing at the front door before making her way around the back of the house. Outside she stopped, looking up at the night sky. The stars were out, but she didn't see any constellations she knew. She shrugged and walked on, following the direction she had received from the text.\n\nThe street was empty, save for a few cars parked along the side. She felt a little nervous, but she had known better than to talk to strangers online, and she was sure she had the number blocked.\n\nShe stopped at the corner of the street and looked both ways. There was no one there. \"That's weird,\" she thought, turning to go back to her house. She saw a pair of shoes standing out from under a parked van.\n\n\"No, no, no, no, no,\" she muttered, her heart racing. She took a step back, then stopped. She heard footsteps behind her, soft footsteps. She froze, not daring to breathe.\n\n\"Emily. Thank you for coming. I know you didn't expect this, but we need you.\"\n\nShe turned, looking at the person speaking. A woman with a large purse, sunglasses, and a suit.\n\n\"What do you need me for?\" She felt her back hit something metal, and she realized she was pressed against the side of a van.\n\n\"I'll tell you everything you need to know when we get where we're going.\"\n\nShe tried to push away, but the van's side door slid open.\n\n\"Get in, and don't make a scene.\"\n\nEmily hesitated. She felt a tap on her shoulder, and she turned to see a man in a suit. He gestured to the van, and she got in.\n\n\"Where are we going?\"\n\n\"Not far. You'll be home by tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow morning?\"\n\nThe woman behind the wheel nodded. \"Yes. You'll have a new job, and you'll be paid to work on it.\"\n\nEmily felt her stomach twist, unsure what to do. \"I don't understand,\" she said.\n\nThe man in the passenger seat turned to her. \"You're being drafted.\"\n\nShe paused, unsure what to say. \"Drafted for what?\"\n\nThe man smirked. \"You know better than that, Emily. You're a magical girl.\"\n\nShe paused, unsure what to say. \"I'm a what now?\"\n\nThe van stopped in the middle of the street, and the woman turned to her. \"A magical girl. It's a long story. We'll get to all of it, but first, you need to sign some papers.\"\n\nThe woman tossed a stack of documents into her lap, and she felt overwhelmed.\n\n\"I need a minute,\" she said, picking up the first page and starting to read it. It was a contract. \"What is this?\" She looked at the woman, who held out a pen.\n\n\"It's an oath of office. You need to sign it to accept your position as a magical girl.\"\n\nEmily felt like she was dreaming. \"I'm a magical girl.\" She shook her head, feeling like she was about to fall out of her seat.\n\n\"You're a magical girl,\" the man repeated, a smile on his face. \"You have a magical girl inside you. That's why you received the text.\"\n\nEmily was starting to feel like she was in a dream. \"Who sent the text?\" she asked, pointing at the phone in her lap.\n\n\"That was me,\" the man said, holding out his hand. \"I'm Agent Thompson. I'm your handler.\"\n\nEmily took his hand, feeling like she was floating above her body. \"What's my magical girl name?\" she asked, looking at the woman, who was driving again.\n\n\"That's going to be a surprise,\" she replied, \"but I think we should get you home first.\"\n\nEmily nodded, still feeling like she was floating. \"My name is Emily. I'm a magical girl.\" She repeated the phrase over and over, feeling like she was in a trance. As soon as she got home, she knew that her life was going to change forever."

I mean, I've been missing for three days now and yet no one seems to have noticed. I read the names of the missing kids and read through their ages. I was so used to being 14 that seeing the word \"missing\" next to my age shocked me. It didn't feel real.\n\n\"Hey,\" my mother started, her voice sounding a little more serious, \"you know you're missing, right?\"\n\nI nodded. \"Yeah, of course.\"\n\nI could hear my mother sighing, her feet shuffling slightly as she moved closer to me. \"I... I know this might be awkward to ask, but... are you okay? You've been acting... weird since you... you know.\"\n\nShe didn't need to finish her question as I knew what she was talking about. \"I... I think so, mum. I mean, I'm not exactly missing, I'm just in the same year as everyone else. I don't know, it just feels weird talking about it.\"\n\n\"I understand, sweetie, I do.

Don't make any trouble or we'll be in trouble too.\"\n\nI nodded my head at her, \"Okay.\"\n\nI could see her glance over at my father, who had been quietly reading the news, but was now staring at us. \"Alright, let's get you to school now. Don't forget your book bag.\"\n\nI got up from the table and started to head to my room, \"I'm just gonna put my stuff away first, okay? I'll be down in two minutes.\"\n\n\"Sure, take your time, sweetie,\" she replied, her voice dripping with annoyance as she walked back to her room.\n\nI put away my school stuff and quickly changed into the outfit that I would wear, before running back downstairs and grabbing my lunch and water.\n\n\"Bye, mum,\" I said, waving at her as I left the house.\n\n\"Bye, baby,\" she replied, her eyes already focusing on her phone.\n\nI could feel the anxiety as I walked to school, my mind racing a million miles an hour as I tried to figure out what was happening. I could see the looks of my classmates as they stared at me, confusion written all over their faces.\n\n\"Hey,\" I heard a voice whispering in my ear. I turned to see my best friend Emily staring at me, her eyes filled with confusion.\n\n\"I'm... I'm sorry, I don't know what's going on,\" I confessed.\n\n\"Me neither, but I'm glad to see that you're fine,\" she said, her voice filled with relief. \"I was worried that something happened to you.\"\n\nI chuckled. \"Oh, nothing like that, I'm just... time traveling, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Time... traveling?\"\n\nI nodded. \"Yeah, I don't know how it happened, but I woke up one day to find out that I was back in the past, but now I'm back here. I'm confused.\"\n\nEmily frowned, her eyes narrowing in thought. \"Let's try and figure this out together, alright?\"\n\nI smiled, grateful for her support. \"Sure.\"\n\nWe quickly found a spot where no one was looking at us and I pulled out the newspaper. I pointed to the missing kids page, my finger stopping at my name. Emily looked over at the paper and quickly read the article.\n\n\"Hey, I know this kid,\" she whispered. \"She's my cousin.\"\n\nI was shocked, but I quickly recovered myself. \"Oh, really? What's her name?\"\n\nEmily frowned, her eyes squinting in thought. \"Um... let me think,\" she muttered, before pointing at the article, \"that's your name, but it's not exactly a rare name. I'm not sure if this is my cousin.\"\n\n\"Wait, how old is your cousin?\" I asked, my eyes scanning the article, quickly finding the date that my family was missing.\n\n\"Uh, 13... or 14?\" Emily replied, her voice filled with doubt.\n\nI was quick to grab her arm. \"She was missing because of some kidnappers, but we were found just 5 days later. But if you're 13 now, then that means...\"\n\nI could see Emily's eyes widen in shock, her voice trembling. \"That means... that she died?\"\n\nI nodded my head, feeling a chill run down my spine. I could see the confusion in Emily's eyes, her face filled with shock and fear.\n\n\"But... but you're her,\" Emily stuttered, her voice barely audible. \"I don't understand.\"\n\nI could feel my face going white, my body shaking in shock. \"What... what are you talking about?\" I asked, my voice shaking as I stared at Emily, but she just looked back at me with her eyes filled with tears.\n\n\"Emily, no,\" I heard my mother screaming, her voice filled with panic.\n\nI turned to see her running towards us, her eyes filled with worry. \"Emily, no,\" she shouted again, her body crashing into Emily's.\n\n\"Mother, what's going on?\" I asked, my voice filled with confusion, but my mother didn't seem to answer me, her body shaking as she tried to hold back her tears.\n\nEmily's eyes looked over at me, her face filled with shock. \"I'm... I'm sorry, I don't understand.\" She muttered, before grabbing her school bag and running off.\n\n\"What's going on?\" I asked, my voice filled with frustration, but my mother just shook her head.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sweetie. I don't understand it either.\" She said, her body still shaking as she tried to hold back her tears."

        "pred_story": "\"You said to protect her. And that's exactly what I did.\"\n\nMackenzie's eyes snapped to meet his. \"By turning her into a bloody assassin?\"\n\nThe old man shrugged. \"She wasn't a very nice girl. She was a killer. You killed someone to escape from prison. You even tried to kill your boss.\"\n\n\"I was in danger.\" Her voice was steady, but Mackenzie could see the tension in her jaw.\n\n\"Of course you were. And I helped her in the only way I knew how.\"\n\n\"You helped her become a killer.\"\n\n\"She was already a killer. You had a gift for it. I honed that gift into an art form.\"\n\n\"You didn't need to hone it. You could have stopped her.\"\n\nHe waved a dismissive hand. \"If I had stopped her, she'd be dead by now. Or worse. I kept her alive, and I gave her a purpose in life.\"\n\n\"A purpose to kill people?\"\n\nHe sighed. \"Look, Mackenzie. I know this isn't easy to hear. But I think you need to know the truth. You've been living in denial for years, and it's time to face reality. You don't need to be a killer anymore. You can live a normal life.\"\n\n\"I don't want a normal life.\"\n\n\"What do you want, then? Another prison sentence? You want to be locked up again? You want to die?\"\n\n\"I want to be with her.\"\n\nHe snorted. \"You want to be with someone who's still in prison.\"\n\n\"That's not fair. She's not like that anymore. She's changed. She's a different person now.\"\n\n\"A different person? You mean a different killer?\"\n\nShe stepped forward. \"No. I mean a different person. One who knows what she wants. One who knows what she needs. And what she needs is me.\"\n\n\"You've been brainwashed, Mackenzie. You've been brainwashed into believing that you need her. But you don't. You need to be free.\"\n\n\"I am free.\"\n\n\"No, you're not.\" He turned away from her. \"You were never free.\"\n\n\"I was free to do what I wanted. I was free to live my life however I wanted.\"\n\n\"No, you weren't. You were trapped. You were trapped by the choices you made. You were trapped by the life you led. But I freed you from all that. I freed you from your prison sentence. I freed you from your past.\"\n\n\"You imprisoned me in your own way.\"\n\n\"Only to set you free. Only to help you find yourself.\"\n\n\"I was happy. I was happy in prison.\"\n\nHe spun around. \"You think you were happy? Happy? Do you know what it means to be happy?\"\n\n\"I know what it means to be alive.\"\n\nHe stared at her. \"And I'm alive too. But I'm still a killer. And I'm still alone.\"\n\n\"Why do you want to hurt me? You've helped me. You've helped me so much.\"\n\n\"Because I don't want to lose you. Because I don't want to lose what we had.\"\n\n\"You said you would keep me safe.\"\n\n\"I will. I will keep you safe. But you need to stay away from her.\"\n\n\"You don't understand. You don't know what we've been through. You don't know how much we need each other.\"\n\n\"We need each other? What do we need each other for?\"\n\n\"For everything. We need each other for everything.\"\n\n\"But I'm the one who needs you. I need you more than I've ever needed anyone in my life.\"\n\n\"We need each other, Mackenzie. We need each other.\"\n\n\"But I don't need you anymore.\" She turned and left him there, alone. \"I need her.\"\n\nThe old man closed his eyes. He felt his body sag. His shoulders slumped. He felt his heart break. He knew he'd lost her. He knew he'd lost her forever.\n\nBut he didn't let it show. He didn't let anyone see his pain. He kept his smile on. He kept his eyes open. And he kept his heart beating. \n\nBut he couldn't shake the feeling. The feeling that he'd lost everything. The feeling that he'd lost his purpose in life. And the feeling that he'd lost the only person he ever truly cared for.\n\n\"Hello, Mackenzie.\" Her voice was soft. But it was the sweetest sound he'd ever heard.\n\n\"Hello.\" He smiled. He smiled back at her. \"It's been a while.\"\n\n\"Yes, it has. Are you ready to go home?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm ready.\"\n\n\"Good.\" She smiled back at him. \"I'll see you there.\"\n\nShe walked away. And he watched her. He watched her walk away. He watched her disappear from view. And he smiled.\n\n\"Hello, Mackenzie.\" She was in the doorway. He was sitting on the couch. They were back at his place again.\n\n\"Hello.\" Her voice was soft. But it was the sweetest sound he'd ever heard.\n\n\"You're looking good, Mackenzie. You're looking great.\"\n\n\"Thanks. How about you? You look a bit tired.\"\n\n\"Maybe a bit.\" He smiled. \"But I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm good.\"\n\n\"I know.\" She smiled. \"I know. I just wanted to check on you.\"\n\n\"You don't need to check on me.\"\n\n\"I want to. I want to be here for you. I want to make sure you're happy. I want to make sure you're safe.\"\n\n\"I know. And I want the same for you. I want to be there for you.\"\n\n\"I know. And I want the same for you.\"\n\n\"Okay, then.\" He smiled. \"Let's do it.\"\n\n\"Let's what?\"\n\n\"Let's live our lives together. Let's be happy together. Let's live together.\"\n\nShe nodded. She smiled. And she went to him. She went to him. She leaned in to him. She kissed him.\n\nAnd he knew they were meant to be together. They were meant to be happy together."

But don't say I didn't warn you.\"\n\nShe got out of the car and walked up to the front door, opening it and waiting for him to answer. \"I know you're home, because I can hear the TV. So I know you're watching my kids right now, which means you need to answer this door. I don't care if you're having an affair with my best friend, but I care that you're here with my kids.\"\n\nShe heard the TV stop, and then he appeared in front of her. \"Amanda, I was just watching TV with the kids.\"\n\n\"So what? That means you're not going to answer the door? That means you're not going to spend any time with my children?\"\n\n\"Okay, okay. I'll open the door. But please, just be calm about it. I know this situation is upsetting for you, but I want to make things work with you. I love you.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"I love you too, but I have to see this through. Now open the door.\"\n\nShe walked into his house, and looked over at her children who were playing on the floor, laughing at some TV show. \"You're spending time with my children. That means we're working on things.\"\n\nHe looked over at her, and then back at the children. \"You can't really expect me to just forget everything, and spend time with you and the kids.\"\n\n\"Yes, I can. I need you to. I need to know that you love me, and the kids. I want to know that you're willing to work through this with me.\"\n\nHe sighed, and looked over at the children. \"Okay, sure. I'm working through this. But you can't expect me to forget everything. Can't you just move on?\"\n\n\"No. You dumped me, so I don't think I can move on that easily.\"\n\nHe sighed, and walked over to her, grabbing her hand and pulling her into a hug. \"Okay, Amanda. I understand. I was a jerk, but I want to make things right between us. I love you.\"\n\nShe felt a pang in her heart, and knew that she was in trouble. \"I love you too,\" she whispered, and knew that she was just a goner. She felt like she was floating on a cloud, floating in a sea of love. She knew that she had to be careful, but she couldn't resist.\n\n\"I want to spend the rest of my life with you, Amanda. Will you marry me?\"\n\nShe gasped, and looked up at him. \"But I'm just your mistress.\"\n\n\"I don't care. I don't care if you're my mistress or my wife. I just want to spend the rest of my life with you. But I know that you want something more.\"\n\nShe thought about it, and then nodded. \"Okay. I'll marry you.\"\n\nHe smiled, and pulled her into a kiss. \"Thank you,\" he whispered, and she smiled, and hugged him back. She knew that they would spend the rest of their lives together, in this crazy dance of love.\n\nAs she was marrying her husband, she knew that she would never be able to do it without her husband. But there was a catch, since she only had a wish. So she had to make do with what she had.\n\nShe decided that since she only had one wish, that she could try and do the best she could with the wish. \"I wish for eternal love,\" she whispered, closing her eyes.\n\n\"Very well, my dear,\" the being said, disappearing into a puff of smoke.\n\n\"What just happened?\" Amanda asked, opening her eyes.\n\n\"I gave you the eternal love that you wished for. I will be with you every step of the way, making sure that you never experience the horrors that love can bring. But I must warn you, my love, I will be a bit clingy.\"\n\n\"Clingsy?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, you will never be able to do anything without me. I will be the one who takes care of everything, making sure that you have everything you need. So are you prepared to handle the situation?\"\n\nAmanda nodded. \"Of course, I would never leave my husband's side.\"\n\nHe sighed, and rubbed his temples. \"Okay, but don't say I didn't warn you.\"\n\nAs they settled into their new life, Amanda was constantly plagued with visions of her husband cheating on her. But it was just her imagination.\n\nHe was never actually with anyone else, but she was constantly haunted by the thought. And she knew that she was never going to be able to shake it, no matter how much she wanted to. She just had to accept the fact that she was never going to be able to do anything without her husband.\n\n\"I love you,\" she whispered, and he smiled, and hugged her back. \"I love you too, my dear.\"\n\nYears passed, and Amanda was still plagued by visions of her husband cheating on her. And every time, she would try and talk to him about it, but he would just tell her that she was being paranoid.\n\nShe knew that it was irrational, but she couldn't shake the feeling. It was as if someone was always watching her, and she knew that it was her husband's imagination that was haunting her. She tried to move on, but she couldn't seem to let go of the fear.\n\nThen one day, she found herself in a coffee shop, staring at a guy who looked exactly like her husband. She froze, and couldn't move, as if she was paralyzed. She couldn't take her eyes off him, and couldn't look away. She couldn't seem to shake the feeling that he was her husband, no matter how many times she told herself that he wasn't.\n\nShe was in shock, and couldn't move. She knew that she was staring at a stranger, but she couldn't help but think that he was her husband. She was paralyzed with fear, and couldn't move, unable to take her"

But your court mage offers you two options: drink a potion to turn back time or walk the path of a lonely monarch, destined to fight battles until the end.\tLength: 595 words<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
        "pred_story": "\"Your majesty!\" A knight in front of me gasped, blood pouring out of his side, \"The black knights have come! Your enemy has breached our walls!\"\n\nI sighed and turned to face the castle gates, \"How many?\" I asked, already knowing the answer. They would all be here, every enemy, every vulture who wanted to pick at the bones of my kingdom. And I would face them, alone. Because, if we all die, my kingdom will be taken over by the enemies. And I would rather die than let them take over.\n\nMy court mage, standing behind me, coughed, \"Your majesty, I have something to say.\" I turned around and saw him wiping away a tear, \"I have made a potion of time travel. I think you should drink it.\"\n\nI scoffed, \"Why? What will it do? Return me to before all this?\" I gestured towards the carnage around me, \"Before this kingdom collapsed? I'm not stupid. Even if the kingdom hadn't fallen, my enemies would have caught up with me. And I would not be able to win this fight.\"\n\nHe nodded, tears welling up in his eyes, \"Then I have nothing to say.\"\n\nI sighed, \"I understand.\" I didn't know what to say to him. I couldn't blame him for wanting me to live. Any king would want their king to live.\n\n\"Your majesty, I am sorry.\" He said, his voice cracking, \"I know that you would have been a great king. But, if you are dead, my position will be useless.\"\n\nI chuckled, \"So, you think that this is only about you?\"\n\nHe nodded, tears flowing down his face, \"Yes, my majesty. If you are dead, I would have no use. I would either be a traitor if I ruled, or a lowly mage, unable to do anything.\"\n\nI sighed, \"I understand.\" I could have forced him to drink the potion too, but I didn't want him to lose everything he had worked for. This kingdom had nothing left to offer, and I wasn't going to let any of my people die on my behalf.\n\nI turned around, \"Get away from me!\" I shouted at the remaining soldiers. \"I will handle everything!\"\n\nThey didn't need to be told. They all knew why they were here. I turned back to my mage, \"Are you ready?\"\n\nHe nodded and handed me the vial.\n\nI swallowed it and, in an instant, I was back in my old days, training as a knight. But now, I was no longer a knight. I was the king. My kingdom was still in its early days, and the kingdom was full of enemies. They all wanted to take down my kingdom, and I had to make sure that I won.\n\nI didn't remember the next few days. I was too busy fighting and winning. But in a few months, I had already defeated all the enemies around me, and I was starting to build a strong and loyal army. I was no longer the weak and powerless king that I was before.\n\nBut then, my kingdom collapsed. The enemies had become too strong for me, and I had to fight them alone. And, in the end, I died. The kingdom was destroyed and my people were killed.\n\nBut I knew that I had done my best. I fought with everything I had, even when I knew that I couldn't win. I fought for my people, and my people fought for me. And in the end, I fought until the very last breath in my body.\n\nBut, then, I was back in the throne room, blood pouring out of my chest. And my mage stood in front of me, tears in his eyes, \"I'm so sorry, my majesty.\" He said, \"I couldn't stop this from happening.\" He took my hand and held it, \"I couldn't save you.\"\n\nI smiled, \"Thank you.\" I said, \"Thank you for being here for me.\" He smiled and nodded, tears flowing down his face. And in that moment, I realized that there was no need for a heroic ending. This was the only way for me to go."

The beeping monitor she\u2019s watching is steady, the heart rate normal.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m alive. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m even me anymore. I think about all of the times I\u2019ve had near death experiences, how I\u2019ve died in alternate universes. The last one was my own, my own demise. This time, I remember.\n\nI think about the last time I died. I was 27 years old. It had been 3 months since I graduated from college. I was living with my parents and working at a job I hated. I worked in the tech industry, but I wasn\u2019t a programmer or developer. I was an auditor. I\u2019m not sure how I ended up doing that. It\u2019s a good job, one that I should be proud of. But I hated it. I hated the routine, the monotony, the lack of creativity and intellectual challenge.\n\nI died 10 years after that. I was 37 when I died of old age. I was living alone, with just my pets for companionship. I had a wife, but she had died 5 years before. We were married for 35 years, and while I loved her, I\u2019m not sure if I was ever in love with her. I had a son, but he had died 20 years before. I didn\u2019t think that he would ever get married or have kids of his own, but he did. He was my first grandchild, and I was proud of him. My daughter was a scientist, a biologist, and was working to cure cancer. I was proud of her too. I had always been a proud parent.\n\nI think about the 23 years I spent between my two deaths. I was always happy, never truly sad. I wasn\u2019t in love with anyone, but I was never lonely. I had always been a social person, but I was never desperate to be in a relationship. I had my own hobbies and interests. I learned new languages. I practiced yoga. I read a lot of books. I worked on my writing skills.\n\nI think about all of the things that I wish I had done in my first life. I wish I had taken more risks. I wish I had followed my dreams. I wish I had been more spontaneous. I wish I had traveled more. I wish I had fallen in love.\n\nI think about how I might be able to do that in my second life.\n\n\u201cHello? Are you awake?\u201d the nurse asks, snapping me out of my reverie.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, \u201cI\u2019m awake. I\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great to hear,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get the doctor.\u201d\n\nShe leaves my room and returns with a young man in a white coat.\n\n\u201cHello, you were in an accident?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, \u201cI was shot.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m here to help you.\u201d\n\nHe starts to examine me, checking my pulse, my breathing, my reflexes.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s your pain level?\u201d\n\nI think about how I feel. I was shot, but I\u2019m not in pain.\n\n\u201cZero,\u201d I say.\n\nHe looks at the monitor behind me, then at me. \u201cYou\u2019re one lucky man,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should be dead.\u201d\n\nI nod.\n\n\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d he asks.\n\nI think about that. I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m just trying to get better.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Dr. Patel,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a neurosurgeon.\u201d\n\nHe smiles. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the luckiest men in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going to take care of you now. Don\u2019t worry about anything, okay?\u201d\n\nI nod.\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d he says, \u201cnow let\u2019s get you better.\u201d"

There was a single chair in the center of the room, the same color as everything else, and there were two small buttons on the wall near the light bulb.\n\n\"You are the first person to ever survive the experiment,\" said the man on the intercom. \"The technology is still in its infancy, but you will never age. You will never fall ill. The only thing you need to do is to never leave this room.\"\n\n\"Never leave this room?\"\n\n\"Yes. We will provide all of your needs within this room, but you are never to leave it. The door will be sealed shut, and the airlock will be sealed behind you. You will never be able to leave this room. But you will be able to live a long time, perhaps centuries.\"\n\nI looked at the man in the chair. He was still talking.\n\n\"Are you listening?\" he asked. I was confused, and my head spun.\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered. \"But what about the other people?\"\n\n\"What other people?\"\n\nThe man on the intercom chuckled. \"Are you forgetting what you are?\" he asked. \"You are a clone. All of the others are gone. You are a copy of them, and they are all gone.\"\n\nI knew that I had been created for the experiment. I knew that I was a clone, but I didn't know that I was the only one. I thought that I was a copy of someone else, but I had never seen them.\n\n\"So what you're saying is that I can live forever... if I never leave this room again?\" I asked.\n\nThe man on the intercom laughed, and then laughed again. He was laughing so hard that I could hear him even though there was no intercom.\n\n\"Yes, that's what I'm saying,\" he said. He laughed again, and then stopped. \"But you must never leave this room. You can't let us in.\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked. \"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because you are one of them,\" he said. \"I'm not saying that in a good way. They are the enemy, and you are the enemy too.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" I asked. \"I am one of us.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" he said. \"They are the enemy. You are the enemy. But you are the only one who knows it.\"\n\n\"You're not making any sense,\" I said.\n\n\"The only thing that you need to do is to stay in this room,\" he said. \"Don't let anyone else in.\"\n\nI didn't know what to think. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what the man was saying. I just knew that I didn't want to stay in the room anymore. I wanted to leave.\n\n\"I don't want to stay here,\" I said. \"Can I go?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the man on the intercom. \"You can't leave. I can't let you leave.\"\n\n\"You can't stop me,\" I said.\n\nI stood up and walked over to the door. I was about to open it, but I heard the sound of air rushing out. The door opened, and I could see a woman walking outside. I saw her talking to a man, but I couldn't hear what they were saying.\n\nI walked out into the hallway. The woman was standing there, looking at me.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" I asked her.\n\n\"You're the experiment, aren't you?\" she asked. \"The person who survived.\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" she said. \"I'm so sorry that we had to do this to you.\"\n\nI looked at her and saw my face staring back. \"I don't understand,\" I said. \"Why did you do this?\"\n\n\"We needed you to be immortal,\" she said. \"And you are the only one who will live on.\"\n\n\"I don't want to live on like this,\" I said.\n\n\"You can't stop living,\" she said. \"Even when you're dead, you're still alive.\"\n\nI looked at her. I looked at myself. I didn't know who I was anymore. I didn't know who she was either. All I knew was that I didn't want to stay in that room. I didn't want to be immortal."

They were standing next to each other and they were both smiling. They were both looking at me and I could see the happiness in their eyes.\n\nThe photo was taken recently, I could tell that. It was a bright sunny day and the men were both wearing shorts and t-shirts. They were both wearing sunglasses and they were both smiling.\n\nThe photo was on a piece of paper that was the size of a postcard and it was neatly folded in half.

So, yeah, thanks and no thanks.\" He was smiling again.\n\nI reached into my pocket and I pulled out the photo and I held it up. \"Do you recognize this man?\" I said.\n\nHe stopped and he looked at the photo. He was looking at it very closely, almost as though he was looking at it through a microscope. He looked up at me and he had a look of absolute confusion on his face.\n\n\"Are you serious?\" He said. \"I know him. He's a man I've worked with.\"\n\n\"And who is he?\" I said.\n\n\"He's a man I've worked with,\" he said. \"I don't know, but he's a man I've worked with.

        "pred_story": "\"Mom, I'm going to be moving in with Grandpa. He's sick, and Dad is going to be away on a project.\"\n\nMy mother and father were in their late 40's by this time, but that was the last time I saw them for a while. They were in some sort of conference or meeting, and I don't remember exactly what it was about. Anyway, my mother left me a note and a small bag with some food and water. It was a few days before the summer solstice, and the sun was still going down at around 10:15 PM. I had a few hours before I would have to leave the house.\n\nWhile I was getting my bag, I saw my grandfather sitting in his wheelchair. He was staring at the clock on the wall. It was 10:25 PM. He gave a little sigh, and then looked at me. He had been like this since the stroke he had when I was a kid. He was unable to talk, but I could hear him thinking. Not exactly, but I could hear his thoughts. It was a strange ability, but it was also a curse.\n\n\"Grandpa, what are you planning on doing?\" I asked. He didn't respond.\n\nI walked up to him, and put my bag down at the table. I picked up a few things, and put them in a backpack. \"I'll be right back. I don't know when I'll be home again.\"\n\nHe looked up at me, and gave me a small smile. I put a hand on his shoulder. \"It's going to be okay. You're going to be alone for a little while, but that's okay. I'll be back home soon.\"\n\nI turned and ran out the door. I could hear his thoughts again. \"I'll be back. You know what I'm going to do, don't you?\"\n\nI didn't respond. I didn't want to respond. I wanted to run away from this feeling in my stomach. I didn't want to think about the fact that he would be all alone for the next year. I wanted to ignore the fact that he was thinking about hurting himself.\n\nI ran to my room, and started packing. I grabbed my school books, and a few clothes. I stuffed them in my bag, and ran to the kitchen. I grabbed a bottle of water, and a few energy bars. I was almost ready.\n\nI ran out the door, and started to run. I didn't look back, I didn't want to see what was happening. I knew that Grandpa was going to be okay. He was in a nursing home, and there were plenty of staff there. He would be safe. \n\n\"Grandpa, stop that!\"\n\nHe was doing something with the clock on the wall. Something with the clock and the wall. \"Grandpa, stop that! Please, I don't want to see you get hurt!\"\n\nHis thoughts again. \"You know what I'm going to do. You know, don't you? You know, why I'm going to do it.\"\n\n\"Grandpa, I don't know what you are going to do! But I don't want you to get hurt. Please, stop that!\"\n\nI heard a faint thud, and I stopped running. I heard a faint scream. I ran in the direction of the scream, and I saw what had happened. I saw what Grandpa had done.\n\nHis wheelchair was on the wall, and he had fallen back onto the floor. There was a faint pool of blood under him. He was unconscious.\n\nI fell to my knees, and I could hear his thoughts again. \"Finally, let's get started. You should have been here sooner.\"\n\nI could hear his thoughts again. \"You didn't want to let's get started earlier?\"\n\n\"Are you okay, Grandpa? Are you going to be okay?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm fine. It's been a long time since I've been like this. A long time. Let's get started.\""

I wanted to be with those that I loved, and I wanted to go out in peace.\n\nBut the world was going to end, and that was just something I had to face. And that was what I had been doing for the past couple of months. I had been doing everything I could to prevent the end of the world, but everything I had tried had failed. I had tried talking to the people in the government, I had tried talking to the villain, I had tried using my powers, but everything had failed.\n\nThe villain had gotten stronger, the government was no use, and my powers were limited. I had used everything I knew, and I still had failed. So, I had tried something different. I had tried finding a way to cheat the end of the world. And that is where I had found myself, standing in front of the building that the villain was inside.\n\nI stood in front of it, looking at the building. It was the most advanced building in the world, and it was the building where the villain was hiding. He had taken over the world, and was currently watching the end of the world. But I had found him. I had found the place where he was hiding, and I was going to do everything I could to take him down. But I was also ready for the end of the world. I had come to accept it.\n\nThat was the problem. I was going to the end of the world, and I was okay with it. I was prepared for it. I had taken everything that I could, and I had given up everything else. I had found a new purpose, a new sense of peace, and I was ready for the end of the world.

All I knew was that I had to protect my daughter, to ensure her safety and well-being. I thought that your daughter could help me do that, but I was wrong. I made a mistake.\u201d\n\nI narrowed my eyes at the Queen. \u201cAnd what of my daughter? Did you love her? Did you care for her?\u201d\n\nThe Queen nodded. \u201cI love her.

You are cruel.\u201d\n\nThe Queen looked at me angrily. \u201cI would do anything to protect her, but I am not cruel. I love her.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove?\u201d I spat. \u201cYou call that love? You call leaving her to be torn from her only home love? You call it love when you know she will be forced to live as a prisoner for the rest of her life? I call it cruelty, and I will make you pay for it.\u201d\n\nThe Queen laughed. \u201cYou are cruel, too. You call it retribution when you slaughter the innocent? You call it vengeance when you harm the weak? I call it cruelty, and I will make you pay for it.\u201d\n\nI laughed. \u201cI am not cruel. I am simply just. I am simply taking what is rightfully mine. I am taking vengeance for what you have done.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen take vengeance on me,\u201d the Queen said. \u201cTake it on me, because I am the one who made the decision. Take it on me, because I am the one who was cruel.\u201d\n\nI laughed again. \u201cAnd what of my daughter? What of her fate? You expect me to leave her here, while I take vengeance on you?\u201d\n\nThe Queen nodded. \u201cI expect you to. I expect you to leave her here, to take vengeance on me. I expect you to save your daughter.\u201d\n\nI narrowed my eyes at the Queen. \u201cIf I do this,\u201d I said, \u201cyou must swear on your daughter\u2019s life that you will never again take her from me. You must swear that she will never again be taken from me. You must swear that she will always be safe.\u201d\n\nThe Queen nodded. \u201cI swear it. I swear that she will always be safe. I swear that she will never again be taken from you.\u201d\n\nI laughed. \u201cAnd what of your minions?\u201d I asked. \u201cThey were cruel to my daughter. They were cruel to me.

        "pred_story": "The walls crumbled, the floors broke, and the streets were strewn with debris. Buildings were broken and broken in half, and all around, the city was in ruin. In the midst of this destruction, a store stood untouched. It\u2019s large screen was lit up in a broadcast that looked like any other. A group of politicians were arguing over the country\u2019s latest budget bill, pointing fingers at each other.\n\nThe street was empty, there were no signs of bodies, no signs of dead. The only sound was the wind rustling through the broken glass and the voices of the politicians. I watched for a while, my stomach empty and my bones aching from the long day of scavenging. I had to find food, but I couldn\u2019t move. My leg was broken, my arm was injured, and there was no chance of me making it back to the campsite. But it was the broadcast that kept me sitting there.\n\nThe country was thriving, there was no war, no famine, no natural disasters. People were happy, they were living their lives like normal. It was a strange sight. The politicians were arguing, but they were also laughing. They were smiling, and it was clear that they were not going to actually do anything. It was just another meeting. It was just another show.\n\nThe broadcast ended, and suddenly, the screen was covered in a game. A game I knew. A game that was popular among the pre-zombie folk, and one I had played before. I moved, and suddenly, the screen was in front of me, as if I was playing it. The controller was in my hands, and suddenly, I was there, in the world of the game.\n\nIt was a strange feeling, it was like I was living a dream. I was free to move, free to do whatever I wanted. I could play the game, and the world around me was gone. I had forgotten about my injuries, about my broken leg. I was free, and I reveled in it.\n\nBut the game wasn\u2019t what it seemed. The more I played, the more I saw things. I saw things that were not in the game. I saw people, walking around. They were zombies, and they were all around me. I couldn\u2019t see them, I couldn\u2019t hear them. I couldn\u2019t see anyone, but I knew they were there.\n\nI played the game for hours, and I saw a lot. I saw people that were alive, but they were also dead. They were zombies, but they were still alive, and they were all around me. I tried to ignore them, I tried to play the game and pretend they weren\u2019t there.\n\nBut then I saw him. I saw a man, dressed in a suit. He was playing the game, and he was laughing. He was smiling, and it was clear that he was enjoying himself. He was enjoying the game, and he was enjoying the apocalypse. He was enjoying the destruction and the chaos.\n\nI looked at him, and I saw something in him that I couldn\u2019t quite place. It was a look of pride, a look of satisfaction. He was happy with what had happened, he was happy with the world around him. He was happy that the world had ended in this way.\n\nI looked away from him, and I continued playing the game. But I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he was looking at me. That he was watching me, and waiting for something. I couldn\u2019t see him, but I knew he was there.\n\nSuddenly, the game ended, and I was back in the store. I was back in the real world, and it was back to reality. I looked around, and the store was empty. The broken glass was still there, the broken walls were still there, and the TV was still there. But it was just a TV now, and the game was gone.\n\nI left the store, and walked away from it. I was walking, but I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I was being watched. That someone was watching me, waiting for something. I knew I had to get back to the campsite, I knew I had to find food and rest. I had to make it back home, before something terrible happened.\n\nBut as I walked, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I had been watched, that someone had been watching me. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I had been waiting for something, and that I was not alone in this world."

Let's just go back home, and we can forget about this ever happened.\"\n\nI stare at him, and I see the genuine concern in his eyes. \"I...don't know. I'm not upset. I just feel...off. Like I'm thinking too much.\"\n\nI think back, and I recall the mimics, the way they moved, the way their bodies seemed to shift and change.

I feel like something is missing.\"\n\nI think back again, trying to remember the last few days. Then it hits me. \"I know. I know what's wrong.\"\n\nMy friend looks at me expectantly, but I don't respond. Instead, I turn and walk away, not really noticing where I'm going.

Of course it's normal. What else could we see?\"\n\nI sigh, my mind racing. \"I don't know,\" I answer. \"Maybe nothing. But I do know this: it's not normal.\"\n\nI turn, and walk off again, hearing my friend follow. \"You want to talk about it?\" He asks, his voice a bit softer now.\n\nI stop walking, and I turn back to look at him. \"What can I say?\" I answer. \"It was just too...fast. Too...real.\"\n\nI look at my friend, and I see the same look of concern on his face. He looks...scared.\n\n\"Maybe we should get out of here,\" he says, his voice barely above a whisper. \"Maybe we should just go home.\"\n\nI look away, and I sigh. \"But where will we go?\" I ask.\n\nI hear my friend laugh, a forced laugh. \"Where else? We can just go back to school, I guess.\"\n\nI turn back to him, and I see a flash of fear in his eyes. I see it...and then it's gone. \"I'm sorry,\" he says, shaking his head. \"That sounded bad, didn't it?\"\n\nI shrug, but I don't answer. I can't answer.\n\nI feel...afraid.\n\nI feel like I'm in danger.\n\nI look around, thinking about where we are. I don't know where we are. I don't even know where we came from. I don't know where we're going. But I know this: I don't want to be here anymore.\n\nI know this: I want to go home.\n\nBut I don't know how."

The \"service\" I had signed up to, a necromancer on some arcane web that would resurrect me for a small fee, had apparently seen fit to send me back as a disembodied voice in the body of a cat.\n\nI was not pleased. The previous four attempts at being brought back had gone equally poorly. Last time I'd been reincarnated as a sentient eggplant, which was... interesting. And before that I'd had a couple of \"successes\": I was born a nobleman in some medieval European kingdom, only to die again as a child due to some hereditary illness. The second attempt had, somehow, been a more impressive failure; I was reincarnated as a ghost, but not, as I'd hoped, a ghost with any control or agency. Instead, I was trapped in a non-corporeal state that didn't let me interact with the world in any way, but instead forced me to watch as the rest of my family lived their lives.\n\nAs for the third attempt, well, that had been a disaster. I'd been reincarnated as a woman in the early days of the Renaissance, only to have my life cut short as a witch, burned at the stake for crimes I did not commit. The fourth had been another noble, and another hereditary illness. I had been starting to think that this was a good thing, that I might as well be dead for all the good that resurrection would do me at this point.\n\nAnd then, of course, there was this one. A disembodied voice stuck in the body of a cat. Which, I had to admit, was not even that terrible. The cat was smart, and had been well taken care of by its previous owner. All I had to do was... well, that was the problem, really. How do you \"help\" someone as a disembodied voice? I was not supposed to be here, and I was not supposed to be alive.\n\nI was supposed to be dead.\n\nI'd have to find a way out of this, eventually. But for now... I was stuck."

        "pred_story": "It\u2019s been a month. An entire month of this demon taking over my boss, my boss who now answers only to the name of Bael. \n\nIt\u2019s been an entire month of me, along with the rest of my coworkers, slowly adjusting to the new, very very evil, overlord. In the beginning, it was chaos. Bael\u2019s demonic body had made the boardroom a mess of shattered furniture and blood, and the stench of sulfur was heavy in the air. It was a little unnerving, to say the least, as Bael would bellow orders at us, telling us to \u201cWORK harder, or BURN in the pit of damnation.\u201d \n\nI tried to speak up, to tell him that the office wasn\u2019t exactly a church, and that maybe we weren\u2019t exactly working for God or anything, but he just shook his head at me. \u201cSILENCE! YOU DARE question my authority? YOU will work, or face my wrath!\u201d\n\nIt was scary, but it wasn\u2019t the first demon I had met. The thing is, Bael wasn\u2019t interested in our worship or our souls. Hell, he wasn\u2019t even interested in selling us to the highest bidder. He simply was looking for a way to be rid of the soul that had taken over his body, but one that was bound to him. \n\nSee, as Bael told us one day, when the soul that had taken over his body, was a demon hunter. A man who had been tasked with sending us all back to hell, which meant that Bael had to find a way to free himself of the mortal coil without killing the hunter. \n\n\u201cYOU think you know what I am?\u201d Bael boomed at us, pacing around the conference table. \u201cYOU think you know my history? NO, YOU are simply mortal fools. You have no idea what hell is like, what the underworld is like. And you have no idea what I am. But I\u2019ll tell you, and then you will know.\u201d\n\nBael paused, looking at each of us in turn, as he explained the situation. The hunter, who was in possession of Bael\u2019s body, had been tasked with killing him and sending us all back to hell. So, Bael had to find a way to break the connection between them, without killing the hunter, which meant that he had to find a way to drive the hunter out, without killing Bael himself.\n\n\u201cYou see, I have been bound to this body for years,\u201d Bael explained, \u201cbut the hunter has only just joined me. He has been trying to find a way to break our bond since the day we met, and I have been trying to find a way to kill him for the past week. I simply do not know what to do. But maybe, just maybe, you can help me find a way out of this situation.\u201d\n\nAnd then, the unthinkable happened. Bael offered us a deal. He offered us a deal that would change everything for all of us. \n\n\u201cIF you can help me find a way out of this bond, I will give you a deal. ANYTHING you want, ANYTHING your heart desires, I will grant it to you.\u201d\n\nIt was a deal that we all knew would be too good to be true. Bael knew that if we did, he could easily possess one of us. But we were desperate. We were desperate for a change from our lives. We were desperate to break free from the monotony of our jobs, to break free from the monotony of our lives. \n\nSo, we agreed. We agreed to work with Bael, to find a way to break the bond between him and the hunter. \n\nWe went all out, searching everywhere for a way to break the bond. We had tried everything. Everything. We had tried everything that we could think of. We had tried incantations, potions, spells, curses, and exorcisms. But we couldn\u2019t find anything that worked. \n\nBut, then we stumbled upon something. Something that we hadn\u2019t tried. Something that no one had thought of. \n\n\u201cYou know what,\u201d I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we ask the hunter how he would like to be free of the bond?\u201d\n\nBael snorted, \u201cWHAT? Are you insane? Why would we ask him how to break the bond? It would be easier for us to try and find another way.\u201d\n\nI shook my head, \u201cNo, it wouldn\u2019t. Not if we are going to break the bond. Think about it. He has been trying to find a way out of this bond for weeks, and I bet you that he has a way.\u201d\n\nBael thought for a moment, and I could see the gears turning in his head. \u201cAlright. We will do it. But be warned. If you are wrong, then I will make sure you suffer. And suffering, you will.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cI will be careful. And I will make sure that this works.\u201d\n\nI ran up the stairs, and knocked on the door. \u201cOPEN UP! IT IS Bael, the prince of hell. AND you are coming with me.\u201d\n\nThe door opened slowly, and a man looked at me. He was a man I hadn\u2019t seen in a long time. \n\n\u201cHi, Michael,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you. I didn\u2019t know you were working with a demon now. But I suppose that is fitting, considering your last job was a job for a demon hunter.\u201d\n\nI shook my head. \u201cNo, that was not a job for a demon hunter. I was hired by the church to hunt down the demon who had taken over the body of a woman. But this demon, Bael, has been more than happy to let me try and find a way out. And I think I know how to do it.\u201d\n\nThe man looked at me, his eyes narrowed. \u201cHOW?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll need you to tell me how to break the bond.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, \u201cI will give you the ritual to break the bond, but you have to promise me that you will follow it to the letter. If you miss one step, then I will never know what will happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. I will follow the ritual to the letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, here are the steps. Step one: Light a match and burn it. Then blow out the flames, and place the ashes in a cup. Then you will need to pour two cups of salt on the ashes, and pour them into a circle drawn in the sand. Then, you will need to light another candle and place it in the center of the circle. Then, you will need to recite an incantation, and finally, you will need to blow out the candle, and walk away from the circle.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure this will work?\u201d\n\nHe nodded, \u201cYes, I am sure that this will work. You just need to follow the ritual to the letter.\u201d\n\nI nodded, \u201cAlright. I will follow the ritual to the letter. And if you\u2019re lying to me, then I will be sure to make you suffer.\u201d\n\nHe smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sure you will. But I know you won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nI nodded, \u201cAlright. That\u2019s all. Can we leave?\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cYes, we can leave.\u201d\n\nWe walked to"

        "pred_story": "We were just getting started on the day. Our instructor walked over to our squad and began talking to us. We all knew the speech that was coming. \"Time is your greatest asset and your greatest enemy. Keep track of it at all times. It is the lifeblood of combat. Keep your enemy off balance with your timing, and let the enemy fall behind with time. Do not waste time. It is your lifeblood. With time, you can be anywhere, do anything. Without time, you are nothing more than a corpse waiting for your enemies to find you.\"\n\nIt all made sense, and we could see the logic in what he was saying. It was an easy concept to learn. The hard part was remembering it. After all, most days were spent training in drills or missions against other groups. The days felt all the same. It was the days when we weren't training that were the problem. It was those days when we went on patrol that we could get caught up in our surroundings. \n\nThat was the problem, we didn't stay in the surrounding. It was always, \"we have to get to point A, and be there at a certain time.\" It didn't matter if we had to run, swim, crawl, or fly. We had to get to that point, and be there on time. There were times when we got delayed, and that was when things became tricky. What do you do in those situations?\n\nThe instructors never gave us any answers. Instead, they would tell us to do whatever it takes. We were not the only ones who were facing this problem. All of us were facing it, and all of us had to find our own answers. Some of us chose to run faster. Some of us chose to fly faster. Some of us chose to move faster. Some of us chose to wait. \n\nIt didn't matter how we got there. As long as we were on time. We were all given a special watch that kept track of time for us. It was a beautiful timepiece. It was one that was simple, but effective. It had two buttons on the side of it. One for forward, and one for backward. It was a watch that didn't require batteries, but we were never told what made it tick. \n\nIt was a watch that you could tell time with just by looking at it. There were lines on the inside of it that ran from the button for forward to the button for backward. Those lines were the hours. They were divided into five minute blocks, each block with a line at the edge of it indicating the minute. It was a watch that kept us on track. Except today.\n\nOur squad was out on a mission. We were tasked with gathering intelligence on an enemy base. We were told to be back by a certain time, but that time was not arriving. Every time we checked our watch, it said we were behind schedule. We were moving as fast as we could. We were the best group out there, and we knew it. We didn't need a reminder. \n\nBut the time on the watch was constantly saying we were behind. It was only a few minutes every time, but the few minutes were adding up. We all knew it. We could see it. We could feel it. We could taste it. Time was working against us. We were moving through the forest. The enemy was behind us. It was going to catch up to us if we didn't speed up.\n\nWe were all running. We were all moving at top speed. Our feet pounded against the forest floor. We leaped over roots and rocks. We dodged low branches and branches that had fallen to the ground. We were running for our lives. The sound of footsteps echoed in the forest. It was getting louder.\n\nThe watch was saying that we had one minute left. We were still moving forward, but we were moving at a slower pace now. We were tired, but we kept moving. We knew that we had to be on time. We had to be there. We had to be ready. We were almost there, and the footsteps were almost upon us. \n\nThe watch was saying that we had two seconds left. The enemy was right behind us. We were running for our lives. We were almost there. We were almost ready. The watch was saying that we had five seconds left. We were moving faster now. We were running with all of our might. The enemy was right behind us, but they didn't catch up. \n\nThe watch was saying that we were five minutes behind schedule. We were at the enemy base, but we were late. We didn't know what to do. The enemy was closing in. We were out numbered. We were out gunned. We were out timed. The watch was saying that we were six minutes behind schedule. We were running out of time."

They would have a new life with all their memories intact. However, this life was bound to the Devourer.\n\nEvery life would have the Devourer's immortality. They would not die of natural causes.

        "pred_story": "There is an old kingdom, in an old time. The kingdom was called the Kingdom of Eldrador, and it was founded on a hill overlooking a lake. The kingdom was made by the people who lived in the hill and around the lake, and it was built by the people of the kingdom who were very skilled and powerful. They knew very well how to build anything they could think about, and they built a lot of things, and they made the kingdom very powerful and rich.\n\nThe kingdom was made so powerful and rich that it took over the entire country and made itself the only state. The people of the kingdom were very proud of their new position, and they thought that they could do anything and control everything.\n\nBut not all the people of the country were happy with the new state of the country. A lot of people who lived in the cities and the towns and the villages did not like that the Kingdom of Eldrador was taking over everything and was treating them as their servants.\n\nThese people decided to fight back against the Kingdom of Eldrador, and they made a new kingdom, the Kingdom of Valenir. They were not as skilled as the people of Eldrador were, but they were very brave and very determined.\n\nThe people of the Kingdom of Eldrador were very surprised to find out that there were people who wanted to fight against them. They were not used to such a thing, and they did not know how to handle it. They thought that all the people of the country should obey them and that they should do everything that they wanted.\n\nThey decided to make a powerful magic spell that would eliminate all the people of the Kingdom of Valenir. They gathered many powerful magicians who knew all about the magic that they would need to do. They put everything they had into this magic, and it seemed to work.\n\nThe Kingdom of Valenir was completely destroyed, and all its people died. The people of the Kingdom of Eldrador were very happy that they were able to defeat their enemy so easily. They thought that this was the end of the war, and that they could now return to the peace that they wanted.\n\nBut they were wrong. The magicians that they used to defeat the Kingdom of Valenir did not destroy their kingdom completely. They destroyed all the people, but they left the buildings and the kingdom itself.\n\nThe kingdom was still there, and it stood on the lake, but it was different now. There was no one there to take care of it, and it started to crumble. The buildings fell apart, the walls were destroyed, and the lake was polluted.\n\nThe people of the Kingdom of Eldrador were not happy about this. They thought that they should have destroyed everything completely, and that it would have been easier for them to do so.\n\nThey decided to fix their mistakes, and they sent people to destroy everything. But they did not finish their work. They were tired of the war, and they did not want to do anything more.\n\nSo the kingdom of Eldrador was also destroyed. The people of the kingdom were also killed, and only a few survived. The survivors were not even happy about this. They thought that the people who died should have survived, and that they themselves should have died.\n\nBut there was something strange happening in the kingdoms. A lighthouse was there, and it was still standing. It was in the middle of the kingdoms, and it was not destroyed. It stood like it was always there, watching the people and their kingdoms.\n\nThe lighthouse was made from the magic that the magicians of the kingdoms made. It was made to guide the people of the kingdom to the right path, and to tell them what they should do. The lighthouse was made so that it could talk to the people who lived in the kingdoms, and that it could guide them.\n\nThe lighthouse was there, and it watched everything that happened in the kingdoms. It watched the people as they died, and it watched the kingdoms as they were destroyed.\n\nThe lighthouse was still there when the people of the country realized that they had made a mistake. They realized that the magic that they made was not to destroy other people, but to protect them and to guide them.\n\nThey realized that the people of the Kingdom of Eldrador and the Kingdom of Valenir were all the same people. They were all people of the country, and they were all equal. They realized that the kingdoms were not right, and that they should have been one kingdom, and not two.\n\nThey realized that the people who died were not the people of the Kingdom of Eldrador and the Kingdom of Valenir. They were people who died because they were wrong, and because they did not understand how to live. They died because they did not understand that everyone is equal, and that everyone deserves the same rights and the same opportunities.\n\nThe lighthouse was still there when the people of the country realized that they had made a mistake. It was still there when they decided to do something about it.\n\nThe people decided to make a new kingdom, the kingdom of Eldrador and Valenir. They decided that this would be the last kingdom of the country, and that it would be one kingdom that would unite all the people of the country.\n\nThe lighthouse was still there when the people made the new kingdom. It was still there when the people decided to make a new magic that would guide them to the right path.\n\nThe lighthouse was still there when the people of the new kingdom realized that they had made another mistake. They realized that the new kingdom was not right, and that it should be one kingdom that would unite all the people of the country.\n\nSo they did the same thing that they had done before. They decided to make a new kingdom that would unite all the people of the country. They decided that this would be the last kingdom of the country, and that it would be one kingdom that would unite all the people.\n\nBut the lighthouse was not there anymore.

        "pred_story": "My family has been grave keepers for a thousand years and we've always treated death as an honor. We've taken the dead out of their beds and buried them in the ground, we've made beautiful coffins with intricate carvings and we've even performed the rites to help the spirits transition to the afterlife. We were the first ones to bring the dead to be buried with a proper ceremony and we were proud of it. We always respected the dead and made sure they were properly mourned and remembered.\n\nNowadays, things are a bit different. Some people don't want to go to the cemetery, some don't want to remember the dead and some just don't care. Our cemetery is smaller now with less visitors. Some of the graves are covered with dirt and grass, but it's not as beautiful as it used to be.\n\nI was about twelve when I met him. I was watching over a grave with flowers when a man walked in and left a bouquet of flowers. I didn't notice who he was at first, but after seeing him for a few times, I saw him again. He came with some gifts of wine, grapes and flowers. He was always dressed in black and wore a top hat. He looked a bit like a skeleton with a cape, but I liked his kind gestures.\n\nWhen he came back one day, he didn't come alone. He was with a woman and a child who were dressed like him, but not as nicely. The woman wore a red dress and her hair was a darker shade of blonde. The child was a boy with brown hair and a smile. He looked a bit like the man with the top hat. He kept on smiling at me as he came closer and gave me a few hugs. They were not a bit suspicious to me, but I still wondered who they were and why they were here.\n\nI didn't have to wait long before he came to me again. He left a bouquet of flowers with a note saying: \"Hello, my family. I've been thinking of you and I'm glad to have found you again. I've missed you since I left all those years ago. I've thought you were dead for a while, but I knew you couldn't be. I have found some friends who have helped me find you. I hope you can forgive me for being away for so long. I'm looking forward to seeing you again, my dear family.\"\n\nI was a bit confused and couldn't make out who these people were. Why would the grave keeper, someone I had never met before, come to visit our family? And what family did he have? Who were these three people and why were they leaving flowers and gifts?\n\nI tried to avoid them, but they kept on coming back. I was worried that they might disturb the graves and the family, but they were very respectful and never disturbed anything. The man and his family were always very friendly and they never disturbed anything. I wasn't sure if they were good or bad people, but I couldn't say they were evil.\n\nWhen I grew up, my dad told me that our family had been keeping graves for centuries. I was the fifth generation to take care of the graves. My great-great-grandfather had kept the graves before me. My dad mentioned some stories of the graves and the people who kept them. They were stories of people who were special, of people who had lived centuries before and who would come to visit the graves. My dad said they were good people who would visit us and pay their respects to the dead.\n\nWhen I heard this, I realized that this must be the family that the man with the top hat was talking about. He was my great-great-grandfather who had kept the graves for so many years. I couldn't believe it that my family had been keeping graves for such a long time. I couldn't believe that my great-great-grandfather had been visiting the graves for so long.\n\nThis was when I realized who the man with the top hat was. He was not a stranger, but a member of my family who had been coming back to visit us for a long time. I was so confused and didn't know what to think. My family had been keeping graves for centuries, but I never thought that one of them would be coming back to visit us.\n\nMy great-great-grandfather, the man with the top hat, had been visiting us for a long time and I realized that he must have been the one to bring the woman and the child who had been visiting the graves with him. But where had they come from? My dad didn't say anything about them.\n\nI asked my dad why he hadn't told me about this, but he said he was afraid of telling me. He said he was worried that I might think the dead were coming back to life. He said that the dead couldn't come back to life and that it was all just stories from my great-great-grandfather. He said that the stories were just myths and that the dead couldn't talk to the living.\n\nI didn't know what to believe. I didn't know if my dad was telling me the truth. I was confused and couldn't make sense of it all. But at the same time, I was curious and wanted to learn more. I wanted to learn about my family and the people who had been keeping the graves for centuries.\n\nI wanted to know more about my great-great-grandfather who had been visiting the graves for so long. I wanted to know more about the woman and the child who had been visiting the graves with him. Who were they and why were they visiting the graves? And why were they visiting my family's graves?\n\nI didn't know where to start, but I knew I would need to ask more questions to find the answers. I knew that my dad might not tell me the truth, but I was going to try to find out more. I was going to try to learn more about my family and the people who had been keeping the graves for centuries."

        "pred_story": "King Harlan had never thought himself very intelligent, much less the equal of a mind like Sarela. He hadn't expected the shadow to be so sharp, or so cunning. But now, as he sat in his darkened cell, he understood what he had done wrong.\n\nThe problem was not Sarela's power, or even the way she wielded it. It was the fact that she was a woman. Harlan had never been one for politics, or even for understanding people. He had always assumed that a king should rule through strength, and that to do otherwise was weakness.\n\nAnd so, when Sarela had presented herself as a shadow-queen of the darkness, Harlan had seen her as nothing more than a woman, one that he could easily defeat. And he had done it, with the aid of his finest warriors and the magical support of his priestess.\n\nNow, though, he understood that Sarela had been playing him from the start. She had allowed him to think her a woman, to be fooled by her beauty and her gentle movements. But behind his back, she had been weaving a web of power, one that ensnared all of his strongest guards, his most powerful advisors. Even his own daughter was trapped in it, though he did not yet know that.\n\nThe reason for Sarela's silence had not been weakness, but patience. She had waited until she had control, and then she had struck. And Harlan knew that he was doomed, that there was no escape from the shadow.\n\nHe thought about his wife, the way she would have screamed as he was dragged away. He thought about his daughter, how she would be waiting for him, thinking that he would return to her. And he thought about his kingdom, the way it would fall apart as Sarela took control.\n\nSarela emerged from the shadows, the dark figure of a woman standing before him. \"So, Harlan,\" she said. \"Did you expect this?\"\n\n\"No,\" Harlan admitted. \"I assumed you would be a man, or at least one that I could fight.\"\n\nSarela smiled, her face gleaming in the dim light. \"And so you did,\" she said. \"But I am not a man, nor a woman. I am a shadow, a dark and ancient power that has been growing for centuries.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Harlan said. \"That is why I had to stop you. I could not allow you to take over.\"\n\n\"But you have not,\" Sarela said. \"You have merely made it easier for me to do so.\"\n\n\"I do not understand,\" Harlan said.\n\n\"Of course not,\" Sarela said. \"But it will make sense soon enough. Right now, I have one question for you. What was your first mistake?\"\n\n\"I...I do not know,\" Harlan said. \"I was doing my job, as a king. Protecting my people.\"\n\n\"And what did you do to protect them?\" Sarela asked.\n\n\"I...I had my guards kill a shadow-witch. I did not know that you were one of them.\"\n\nSarela nodded. \"And what was your second mistake?\"\n\n\"I...I killed a shadow-man. I did not realize that he was your servant, or your son.\"\n\nSarela nodded again. \"And what was your third mistake?\"\n\nHarlan thought for a moment before responding. \"I think I was trying to be a man, rather than a king,\" he said. \"I allowed my emotions to cloud my judgment, and I made decisions based on those emotions rather than logic.\"\n\nSarela nodded, smiling to herself. \"You are correct,\" she said. \"But you did not realize it until now, did you?\"\n\n\"No,\" Harlan admitted. \"What should I have done?\"\n\nSarela shrugged. \"You could have listened to your daughter,\" she said. \"She is wise beyond her years, and she would have cautioned you against your mistakes.\"\n\n\"But I do not have a daughter now,\" Harlan said, realizing what Sarela had done.\n\nSarela laughed, the sound echoing through the darkness. \"Not at the moment,\" she said. \"But you have a shadow-son now. And he will lead you.\"\n\n\"Lead me?\" Harlan repeated. \"How?\"\n\nSarela shrugged. \"That is not your problem,\" she said. \"But he will be with you soon enough, as you learn to rule from the shadows.\""

        "pred_story": "They sat and stared at me with their mouths agape, their faces frozen in a mix of fear and confusion. The classroom was silent, no murmurs or whispers of the students trying to make sense of what was happening. They simply sat, staring at me as I stood at the front of the room, looking down at them with a disapproving look. I didn't see the fear in their eyes as a reason to not go back to work, I saw it as a sign that they needed me.\n\n\"Alright, I see you're all awake,\" I said, my voice a little louder than I wanted it to be. The students jumped in their seats, their eyes darting towards the door as they wondered if others had heard my voice.\n\nI cleared my throat and continued on, ignoring the fear in their eyes. \"Let's get this started, I have a lot to get through today.\" I went to start on the notes, but my hand passed through them. I tried to hold them in place, but I couldn't grab them. I looked down at my hand, confused, and realized that I didn't have a physical body. It all made sense. The students had teamed up to kill me.\n\nBut that still didn't stop me from getting through my notes.\n\nI floated around the room, pointing to things and explaining them. The students were in shock, but as the notes went on, they started to realize how ridiculous they had been. They had gone to such lengths to kill me, but yet I was still here, floating above them, lecturing them as if nothing had happened.\n\nOne of the students, probably the one who had come up with the idea, stood up, shouting \"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!\" \n\nI stared at him, not knowing how to respond. I had been ready for the confrontation, but I had not been expecting him to scream at me. I could see the other students looking at him, confused, and wondering if they should join in. I cleared my throat and pointed at the notes on the board.\n\n\"See, the key difference between a prokaryote and a eukaryote is that prokaryotes do not have a membrane around their cell.\"\n\nI ignored his anger and continued on, ignoring his rage. His anger started to subside, and I could see the other students starting to calm down. The boy continued to stare at me, but eventually he sat down, trying to make sense of it all.\n\nI smiled to myself, satisfied that I had regained control of the classroom. As I finished up the notes, I heard a faint whisper in my ear, \"Are you a zombie?\". I turned around, looking at the back of the classroom, but it was silent. I saw a hand in the back of the room, and smiled.\n\nI reached out to the hand and pointed to my nose. The hand made a funny face, pointing back at my nose, and I smiled. I looked back at the rest of the students, who were all staring at me with a blank expression. I pointed to the hand, then at myself, and they all looked at me with confusion. It was a simple way to communicate that I was still in here, still working, and that we would make it through this."

\u00a0And why was she so calm? \u00a0\u201cDo you have my sister?\u201d I asked. \u00a0\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have your sister,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cThen why are we here?\u201d I asked. \u00a0\u201cI want to ask you a question,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not going to answer any of your questions,\u201d I said. \u00a0\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cThen I\u2019ll ask my own questions,\u201d she said. \u00a0I frowned. \u00a0\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked. \u00a0\u201cAre you married?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u00a0\u201cThen I\u2019m your sister-in-law,\u201d she said.\n\nI stared at her. \u00a0\u201cWhere is my sister?\u201d I asked again. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m your sister-in-law,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I said. \u00a0\u201cOf course, you don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cNo, I mean, where is she? \u00a0Do you have her?\u201d I asked. \u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s on the couch,\u201d she said. \u00a0I turned around, and saw my sister lying on the couch. \u00a0She was fast asleep.\n\nI looked back at her, and realized who she was. \u00a0She was my ex-girlfriend, the one who dumped me in high school. \u00a0I had seen her many times since then, and I had never seen her without her mask. \u00a0But now, she didn\u2019t have her mask. \u00a0And she was wearing pajamas. \u00a0\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were here?\u201d I asked. \u00a0\u201cI wanted to surprise you,\u201d she said.\n\nI stared at her, and realized how much I missed her. \u00a0She was my ex-girlfriend, but I still loved her. \u00a0But how could I love her? \u00a0She was the Red Widow, and I was the Avenger. \u00a0We were enemies. \u00a0And now, she was my sister-in-law. \u00a0I felt confused. \u00a0But one thing was for sure, I was not going to take her to the police station. \u00a0No, I was going to let her go, and maybe she would visit us again.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d she said, looking at me. \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. \u00a0\u201cAre you going to take me away?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\u201cYes,\u201d I said, but I didn\u2019t move. \u00a0\u201cWhy are you standing there?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\u201cI think it would be better if you went home,\u201d I said. \u00a0\u201cYou mean, I\u2019m not coming to jail?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d I said, smiling. \u00a0She smiled back. \u00a0\u201cThen I\u2019ll go now,\u201d she said.\n\nShe went out of the room, and I heard her closing the front door. \u00a0Then I heard my sister. \u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s gone,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cYes,\u201d I said, smiling. \u00a0\u201cThen you can come in,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, walking into the room.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I wasn\u2019t expecting that,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry too,\u201d I said, smiling. \u00a0\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m your brother,\u201d I said. \u00a0\u201cYou?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m the Avenger,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThen why did you let my sister go?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\u201cBecause she\u2019s my sister too,\u201d I said. \u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s my wife too,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u00a0\u201cAnd how did you know?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\u201cI have my ways,\u201d I said, smiling."

I was too busy talking to the other reporter to listen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that explains why I was confused. But why did you guys tell me that was the note?\u201d\n\nShe shrugged again. \u201cBecause the other reporter was right there.

She was saying the same thing we\u2019ve been saying.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was saying the note was wrong?\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cYes.

It was the same one she had been working through for the past twenty minutes, but she had to keep the pilot in the loop. After all, she was the one who had hired him.\n\n\u201cYes, Captain.\u201d He responded, his voice strained. She looked up to see him staring at the door to the bridge. She followed his gaze to see that it had slid open, revealing the dimly lit hallway that stretched out the back of the ship. \u201cAre we taking on passengers?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Mr. Jones. There\u2019s been a malfunction. We\u2019re returning to dock.\u201d She tried to make it sound casual, but she was lying. She had only hired Mr. Jones to fly the ship to a remote planet. No one was supposed to be on board. And yet, here was a second person. A stowaway.\n\n\u201cCaptain, I think you\u2019re going to want to see this.\u201d He said, standing up. He walked past her, through the open door, and down the hallway. She followed him, her heart pounding in her chest. They reached the door to the airlock, and he stopped. \u201cAre you coming in there with me?\u201d He asked.\n\n\u201cOf course I am. I\u2019m your captain. It\u2019s my job to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d She responded. He opened the door and walked in. She followed, closing the door behind her. He was standing there, facing her. \u201cI don\u2019t see him. Where is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking for the stowaway?\u201d He asked, pointing to the airlock.\n\n\u201cThe stowaway?\u201d She repeated. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m going to find out.\u201d He started pressing buttons on the control panel, trying to open the outer door. She stepped forward and put her hand on the panel. \u201cLet me do that.\u201d She said. He looked at her in surprise, then turned and left the airlock.\n\n\u201cCaptain, is there a problem?\u201d She heard his voice from outside the door.\n\n\u201cNo, Mr. Jones. I was just getting some fresh air. I\u2019d like you to join me.\u201d She responded, opening the outer door.\n\n\u201cCaptain, there\u2019s nothing out there. You\u2019re the only one on board.\u201d He said.\n\n\u201cMr. Jones, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve done with my crew, but I want you to open up the log and look for any evidence of tampering. And then, I want you to get the emergency power off and get us back to the dock.\u201d She said. He looked at her like she was crazy, then sighed and turned and walked out the door.\n\nShe waited until he had left the bridge, then turned to face the control panel. She looked at the buttons, and then down at the floor. There, peeking out from under the console, was a small piece of paper. She bent down and picked it up. It was a note, written in a childish scrawl. \u201cI hid in the airlock. I hope you don\u2019t get mad.\u201d\n\nShe looked up, then down again. She reached out and touched the outer door. It was still open, and she could see the outline of a small boy in the airlock, peeking out at her. She smiled, then turned and walked back to the control panel. She started pressing buttons, calling up the logs for the past few days.\n\n\u201cCaptain, I think I\u2019ve found the problem. It looks like there\u2019s some kind of virus that\u2019s been going around. It looks like it was introduced on the previous flight. I\u2019ve isolated it, but I\u2019m not sure how to get rid of it.\u201d He said, stepping into the bridge.\n\n\u201cMr. Jones, the only people on this ship are us. I don\u2019t see how a virus could have caused this.\u201d She said.\n\n\u201cAh, yes. I forgot about the stowaway. It must have been him.\u201d He said. She looked at him in surprise. \u201cI take that back. It was no virus.\u201d He said, then smiled. \u201cIt was a stowaway.\u201d"

Are you all idiots?\" he shouted. \"I am the god of nothingness. I am the one that brings absolute terror to the mortal mind.\"\n\nThe cultists murmured in agreement, but the dark god continued his rant. \"I am the embodiment of the most basic fears that mortals have. I am the unknown that is yet to be discovered. I am the darkness that is waiting around every corner.\"\n\n\"I'm going to give you one final chance. Go out there and convince the next person you encounter to join my cult, or you will all pay for your incompetence.\"\n\nThe cultists rushed out the door, each one determined to prove themselves. They walked through the city until they came upon a man that would be their final test. He was walking with his head down, clearly lost in thought. He was unaware that the cultists were staring at him, and as they watched him pass by, they noticed something peculiar. As he passed by, a figure appeared in front of him, and with a sharp gesture, the cultists watched as the man's head was snapped off of his body.\n\nThe cultists were all shocked at the sudden event. It took them a moment to realize what they had just witnessed, and they were all stunned. The cultists stared at each other in shock, unable to move or react.\n\nThe dark god slammed his fist onto the table. \"What is wrong with you all? What kind of cultists are you? You are supposed to be the best of the best. You are supposed to have the most unique skills. And yet, you can't even manage to persuade a lowly mortal.\"\n\nThe cultists all hung their heads in shame, unable to respond. The dark god sighed and shook his head. \"I can't believe that I even bothered with this cult. I can't even be bothered to have a good conversation with mortals. It's pathetic that I even need to be involved with mortals in the first place.\"\n\nThe cultists all felt a pang of sorrow as they realized what they had done wrong. They knew that they had failed in their mission, and now they had to face the consequences. They each took one final step before their heads were all knocked off their bodies, and like the man before them, each cultist was no more.\n\nAfter the last cultist fell, the dark god spoke once more. \"I don't even know why I bother with mortals. I should just focus on my own cult. At least then, I would have some mortals that are loyal to me. But no, I have to spend my time on the mortals that cannot even do their job.\"\n\nThe dark god leaned his head on his palm, wondering how he had become so powerless in his own cult."

No sign of the ship. *Where the hell was it?* I didn\u2019t want to be the guy who failed his buddy check. But I was.\n\nI began my slow ascent.\n\nJust as I was about to turn on my lights, I saw it. A figure.\n\nIt took a second for my brain to process the sight. A man. Sitting on a chair. With a smile on his face.\n\nHe waved at me.\n\nI waved back.\n\nI looked around. The chair was in the middle of the sea floor. No ship in sight. I kicked over towards him, looking around. The seafloor was sandy. I saw a few fish but no signs of life beyond that.\n\nAs I swam closer, he stood. His body was humanoid but different. His skin was white like a ghost. His hair was a dark blue. He was wearing black pants and a white shirt. No diving gear at all.\n\nI stopped beside him. \u201cWhat the fuck? How are you alive down here?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me. \u201cI asked myself the same thing.\u201d\n\nI looked around. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Where\u2019s the ship?\u201d\n\nHe waved his hands. \u201cThere is no ship. The ship sank at the start of the dive.\u201d\n\nI blinked. \u201cThe start of the dive? Are you joking?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you. There is no ship. You were given a note. It said that you were participating in a study on the effects of isolation and loneliness. That the ship was not real. That you would be given a chance to leave after 60 minutes. And that your time was running out.\u201d\n\nI looked at him. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that this is some sort of study. Where have you been hiding this whole time?\u201d\n\nHe shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You came down here thinking it was real, but it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nI blinked. \u201cWhy not? Where am I?\u201d \n\nThe ghost nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. If you answer a question truthfully, I\u2019ll give you your answer.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cDeal.\u201d\n\nHe smiled. \u201cOkay. Why did you dive down to a shipwreck?\u201d \n\nI shrugged. \u201cI wanted to see it. I wanted to know what it was like down there.\u201d\n\nHis smile grew wider. \u201cWhy would you want to do that?\u201d\n\nI thought about it. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess it\u2019s because I\u2019m curious. I\u2019ve heard that shipwrecks are pretty cool. I\u2019ve seen pictures. I\u2019ve read about them. I wanted to see it myself. Because life is short and it\u2019s better to live it than to miss it.\u201d I looked up at the surface. \u201cI guess I wanted to live it a little more.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cYou can leave now.\u201d\n\nI looked back at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to you?\u201d \n\nHe shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess you\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nI looked at him. He smiled back at me.\n\nI grinned and kicked towards the surface.\n\nI broke through the surface and swam back to the boat. *Got to tell her that I passed the dive.* My dive computer beeped. *Time elapsed.* I glanced down at it.\n\nThe screen was blank.\n\nI stared at it. *What the fuck?* I turned on my lights and kicked down.\n\nThe seafloor was empty.\n\nI looked around. There was no ghost. No ship. Nothing.\n\nJust me. Alone.\n\nI looked at my dive computer. The screen was blank.\n\nI thought back to the conversation. The ghost had said that the time was running out. But what if he had lied? What if the time was still running.\n\nI thought about it for a second before I started to swim back up. *I have to go back to the boat and find out what's going on.* I looked around. *How long have I been down here? 4:32. I got to get back up there before she leaves.*\n\nI kicked back up towards the surface. As I broke through, I saw the boat leaving. *Oh my god. What the hell is going on?* I kicked as fast as I could. But the boat was getting further and further away.\n\nAs I looked back at the empty sea floor, I realized that I was going to be left alone down here."

And then there was the person who had been in prison at the time of the death, and the person that had a solid alibi for the time of the death, and the person who had an argument with the victim.  \n\nThen there were the witnesses who had all seen something different and none of them had anything that could pin the killer to the scene of the crime.\n\nThen there was me.\n\nI was the person who had made a few mistakes. I was the person who had left my fingerprints on the wine glass next to the victim's body. I was the person who had left some hair on the victims sweater. I was the person who had a solid connection to the victim and had a history with them that included a fight that was known to only a few people.\n\nIt was easy to see why no one suspected me, I was clearly innocent and had no motive to kill the victim. The witnesses were confused and seemed to have all seen different things. And the fingerprints and hair didn't point to anyone, only me. \n\nI knew that I had to keep up this act, at least until the body was found and the investigation had been closed. I kept following up on the investigation and seeing how it was going. I kept showing up to the scene, I kept talking to the officers and detectives. And I kept pointing the finger at the others.\n\nAs the time passed I began to lose hope that I would get away with this. It would be too easy to get caught when I was the only one who knew my secret. I had a great motive, a history with the victim that would explain all of the evidence against me. And I had a solid alibi, I had been out of town for the entire week.\n\nI was sure that I was going to get caught and it was only a matter of time before I got arrested and put on trial. And it would be a long time before I would be released back into the general population. The evidence against me would be overwhelming and it would take a miracle to get me off.\n\nAnd so as I was walking through the crime scene, I couldn't help but notice the detectives and officers working to figure out who the killer was. And I saw the victim's body lying on the floor, the blood everywhere. \n\nI saw them trying to find the killer and I thought to myself how easy it would be for me to be caught. All it would take was one misstep and I would be caught and put on trial. And I would be found guilty and put in jail for the rest of my life.\n\nBut I didn't see the other man staring at me from across the room. The man in the black suit and sunglasses. The man who didn't have a badge on. The man who didn't have an earpiece. The man who didn't have any reason to be at the crime scene.\n\nThe man who looked at me and smiled at me. The man who knew my secret. The man who knew that I was the killer. The man who knew that I had done a terrible job at hiding my tracks. \n\nAnd the man who didn't have a single care about any of that.\n\nHe just smiled at me and walked up to me. He was the only one in the room who knew my secret and he didn't seem to care about it.\n\n\"What do you think happened here?\" I asked him, trying to be as casual as possible.\n\n\"Looks like a typical case to me,\" he replied, looking around the room.\n\n\"Looks like, you think?\" I asked.\n\n\"You know, just a typical case,\" he replied.\n\n\"Like you would expect.\" I replied.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Well, I think I'll let you get back to work,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, okay, well I'll see you later, then.\" He said.\n\nI nodded and walked back to my car, the man watching me leave as I was putting the car into park.\n\nHe walked up to the car and knocked on the window.\n\n\"Hey, you might want to think about cleaning up some of the evidence, things might get weird if someone finds that bloodstain.\""

        "pred_story": "\u201cHey! There\u2019s an ad on the app about some bar that\u2019s open all night. What\u2019s the haps?\u201d  It was a Saturday night, I was in my room and was using the bathroom when I heard my roommate\u2019s voice behind me. He was in his room, so I couldn\u2019t tell how he got in, but I was about to ask him when I saw the look on his face. My first thought was that it was some kind of prank, or maybe a joke, but when he opened his mouth to speak, I realized he was serious.\n\nI went back to my room and he followed me. I sat on my bed and he sat in his chair and looked at me. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d He said. I shook my head and he looked at his phone. He scrolled through the app then showed me the ad. It was a bar that was open all night. \u201cIt\u2019s been an all-night bar for a while now, but I never checked it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s on the other side of town,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s at least a 30 minute drive if there isn\u2019t much traffic.\u201d I said. He shrugged and I could tell he was still staring at the screen. \u201cHey,\u201d I said. \u201cHow\u2019d you get in my room?\u201d I was going to let it slide, but then he started acting weird. He was fidgeting on his phone and it didn\u2019t take long to realize why. \u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d I said. \u201cWhy are you looking at that ad again?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a party,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all night. I saw it last night and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s still there.\u201d He was really serious now. I wanted to tell him that I was sure it was a scam, or a prank or maybe a misunderstanding. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ask your friends? You have to have a friend or two here in town that you can call, don\u2019t you? There\u2019s a whole town here, I know that much.\u201d He kept staring at the phone as I spoke. He was getting more and more agitated.\n\nI took a deep breath and realized how serious he was. \u201cAlright,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that could happen if you go?\u201d I had to give him an answer. He started to speak, but then I had it. \u201cYou\u2019ll be at a bar for all night,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re an adult, you can drink if you want. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a crime or anything.\u201d He nodded at me.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go then,\u201d he said. I shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know how else to put this, but I\u2019m not driving. Not here. You\u2019ll have to rent a car.\u201d I said. He shrugged and I knew we had a car rental place down the street. \u201cI don\u2019t know where we are,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the bar is going to be at the top of the hill, or at the bottom. It doesn\u2019t say that.\u201d I said. He shrugged and I could tell he had no idea either. I thought about all the things that could go wrong, but I didn\u2019t know what else to do. He was serious, and I knew he\u2019d go alone if I didn\u2019t go with him."

        "pred_story": "I was the last to join the academy for magic.\n\nThe other students already had a specialty. One was a pyromancer, who learned his magic from the stars, where fire was born. Another was an aeromancer, who learned his magic from the wind, where the earth was shaped. \n\nI was the last student left out, as they learned their magic by way of a book, which was written in blood, of blood.\n\nI didn\u2019t know where my magic came from. It was as if I was a magnet, and the ground was a metal, and I was attracted to its electrons. I could feel the energy all around me, and as soon as I touched it, I could see the world around me differently. I could see the atoms and electrons that made up everything, and I could feel what magic was inside of everything.\n\nThe other students didn\u2019t know what to make of me. They said I was cursed, that my magic was evil, that I was a freak of nature.\n\nBut I knew that wasn\u2019t true. I knew that everyone had magic inside of them. It was just a matter of how to use it.\n\nOne of the teachers of the academy was a pyromancer. He had lived for thousands of years, and had a long white beard. He was a great teacher, and had taught many students in their specialty, but when he came to me, he was at a loss.\n\n\u201cHow do you work with your magic?\u201d he asked, and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\n\n\u201cStabbing?\u201d I said, and I could see the confusion on his face.\n\n\u201cStabbing?\u201d he repeated, and I could see the fear in his eyes.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d I said, and I pulled out a dagger.\n\n\u201cIs that a knife?\u201d he asked, and I could see the fear in his eyes.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d I said, and I touched the blade to my palm.\n\nI could see the atoms in the blade, and I could feel the energy inside of them. I could see the magic inside of the blade, and it was like a fire that was waiting to be unleashed.\n\nI touched the blade to my palm, and I could feel the energy of the blade course through my body. I could feel the magic inside of the blade, and it was like a storm that was waiting to be unleashed.\n\nI stabbed into the air, and it felt like the blade was cutting through an invisible wall. I could see the air around me come alive, as if it was a physical object that was waiting to be cut through.\n\nI pulled the blade out, and I could feel the magic still coursing through my body. I could see the energy around me, as if it was a tangible thing that was waiting to be unleashed.\n\nThe teacher watched me, his eyes wide with fear and confusion. He didn\u2019t know what to make of me, and he didn\u2019t know how to help me.\n\nI walked up to him, the blade still in my hand, and I could feel the energy of the blade coursing through my body. I could see the magic inside of the blade, and it was like a storm that was waiting to be unleashed.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d I said, my voice steady and calm.\n\n\u201cI know that you have magic inside of you,\u201d he said, his voice shaking with fear. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what kind of magic it is. It\u2019s not like anything I have ever seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d I said, and I smiled. \u201cMy magic is different. It\u2019s not like the magic that you have taught me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what is it?\u201d he asked, and I could see the fear in his eyes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stabbing,\u201d I said, and I held out the dagger.\n\n\u201cStabbing?\u201d he repeated, and I could see the confusion on his face.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, and I stabbed into the air.\n\nI could feel the blade cutting through the invisible wall of air, and I could see the energy around me come alive. I could feel the magic inside of the blade, and it was like a storm that was waiting to be unleashed.\n\nThe teacher watched me, his eyes wide with fear and confusion. He didn\u2019t know what to make of me, and he didn\u2019t know how to help me.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t need his help. I knew my magic, and I knew how to use it. I had spent years studying it, and I knew every trick and technique there was.\n\nI was the best stabbing mage, and I knew it."

        "pred_story": "It was just as he had predicted. At least, he thought so. In the dimly lit backroom, the two leaders of the alliance sat hunched over a small wooden table. The orc leader, Togga, grunted and scratched his thick black beard, as he was wont to do when he was in deep thought. His fellow, Balandir, the dwarf leader, simply glared at Togga, as he always did.\n\n\"So,\" Togga said, \"what do you think will happen today?\"\n\n\"I think we'll all die,\" Balandir muttered. \"I always thought you were a madman for trying to ally with us. And now we're all just sitting ducks waiting for a knife in the back.\"\n\nTogga snorted. \"If anything, I thought we'd be ambushed first, not after.\"\n\nBalandir shrugged. \"I didn't think anyone would be as stupid as you.\"\n\nTogga smiled. \"Stupid?\"\n\nBalandir nodded. \"Yes, for trying to forge alliances. For thinking we can ever trust each other. It is the most naive thing I've ever heard.\"\n\nTogga sighed. \"I could never have predicted the outcome of this alliance, I assure you. And I do hope we see more of the like in our lifetime.\"\n\nBalandir scoffed. \"I doubt it, especially among the dwarves. Most don't approve of the alliance, and if you tried to form another, they'd kill you.\"\n\nTogga tilted his head. \"They might. But they won't. For one, you dwarves are known for your stubbornness. And for another, we've already formed a lot of connections. We're not about to let some stupid argument tear all of that down.\"\n\nBalandir laughed. \"You're not about to tear it down, that's for sure. And yet, you're not doing anything to make this alliance stronger.\"\n\nTogga shrugged. \"I'm not sure what to do. If we go to war now, things will get bad. But if we keep going on like this, things will get better. And I'm fairly certain that the next generation will be much more understanding of the alliance.\"\n\nBalandir shook his head. \"You're just too optimistic.\"\n\nTogga sighed. \"I know. I wish I wasn't. But at the same time, I think the alliance is a good idea. If we can manage to keep our heads down until the war is over, then we'll have a better chance of surviving it.\"\n\nBalandir grunted. \"You're right.\"\n\nTogga grinned. \"I know.\"\n\nThe two leaders shared a laugh, before the door to the room opened. A guard, a half-orc half-elf woman, leaned into the room. \"Leaders, the celebration is ready. Would you like to attend?\"\n\nTogga and Balandir stood, before the orc leader replied. \"Yes, let us attend.\" He gave Balandir a nod. \"I'll be there soon, I promise.\"\n\nBalandir gave a reluctant nod. \"Be safe, then.\"\n\nTogga grinned. \"I always will.\"\n\nTogga turned, and the two of them left the backroom. In the front room, the celebration was already underway. Togga smiled. \"Looks like it's been a hundred years since we've done this.\"\n\nBalandir grunted, but followed behind the orc leader. After a time, the celebration finished, and the two leaders left their seats, before going back to the backroom. Togga and Balandir sat down at the table, and stared each other in the eyes.\n\n\"Why do you think things are like this?\" Togga asked. \"Why are we here, after so many years?\"\n\nBalandir sighed. \"I don't know. I'm just glad things are peaceful, at least.\"\n\nTogga smiled. \"Yes, that's for sure. And I think I know why this alliance was formed. Do you remember that story about the last orc-dwarf war?\"\n\nBalandir nodded. \"I do. It was a very bloody war.\"\n\nTogga nodded. \"Yes, but it ended when the elven kingdom and the human kingdom allied against us. And they attacked the elven kingdom, for some reason. But that didn't stop the alliance, as you know.\"\n\nBalandir laughed. \"I didn't think you were so cunning. But then, why didn't you just wait for the war to end?\"\n\nTogga shrugged. \"I think that would have been for the best. But when you get as old as I am, you stop thinking like that.\"\n\nBalandir shook his head. \"You're too kind to be an orc.\"\n\nTogga grinned. \"I try.\"\n\nThe two of them sat in silence for a moment, before Balandir spoke again. \"Yes, a hundred years is something to celebrate. But if it ends sooner, I won't be too disappointed.\"\n\nTogga laughed. \"I wouldn't expect you to. But that's why we should celebrate it now.\"\n\nThe orc leader grinned. \"Yes, that's for sure.\"\n\nBalandir nodded. \"I'll come out and join you, Togga.\"\n\nTogga nodded. \"Of course. I wouldn't want to celebrate without you.\"\n\nTogga stood up, and stretched his arms. He turned to Balandir. \"Thanks, Balandir. Thanks for being part of this alliance.\"\n\nBalandir smiled. \"Thank you too, Togga. We've saved a lot of lives.\"\n\nTogga smiled. \"I can only hope that we'll be able to do the same for a long time.\"\n\nTogga walked out of the backroom, and towards the celebration. In the backroom, Balandir smiled, as he thought of Togga and the alliance. He thought of his fellow orc, who had become like a son to him, and the life he had built with him. And then, a thought crossed his mind.\n\n\"100 years...\" he thought.\n\nBalandir shook his head. \"No. Togga would never... that would be too cruel.\"\n\nThe two orc guards in the backroom turned to Balandir, and nodded. \"Yes, it would be cruel.\" They stood from their positions, and left the backroom. Balandir looked around the backroom. \"What would I do without you, Togga?\"\n\nBalandir sighed. \"I think you know. But it won't come to that. We've been allies for 99 years, and I'm sure we'll have a few more left.\"\n\nBalandir stood from his chair, and walked to the door of the backroom. He turned back to the room. \"I think you're right, Togga. I'm glad we were able to form this alliance. But I'm even more glad that we're still here to see it through.\"\n\nBalandir turned, and left the backroom. He walked to the celebration, where Togga was celebrating with a large smile. Balandir smiled, and approached Togga.\n\n\"Happy birthday, Togga!\" Balandir"

        "pred_story": "\"Sorry, big fella. I don't have any of those things you're looking for.\" I patted the ancient suit's shoulder, a gesture that made it's mechanical body wobble slightly. \"You're just going to have to keep looking. I don't have any compatible implants, and the parts you're asking for are too advanced for me to fabricate on my own.\"\n\nThe ancient mech's sensors flared, its power surge causing the dust around us to rise up in the dim light. I held a hand over my face, waiting for the cloud to settle.\n\n\"I am a member of the original team,\" it spoke, its voice like thunder. \"I remember the creator of this suit. This is a crucial time in history. My systems are failing. I must find a new pilot.\"\n\nI raised my hands in a calming gesture. \"I'm sorry, old timer. I know this is important. But you have to listen. We were able to replicate the parts needed for a compatible pilot. You're just going to have to get in contact with the team that ran the experiment.\" I pulled out my radio and hit the call button, letting out a sigh as I heard the familiar voice of Dr. Chen.\n\n\"Huahua! I had just gotten to the lab!\" She shouted in my ear. \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"It's an ancient mech suit,\" I explained, holding my hand up to the device to quiet it. \"It's found me in the ruins. I don't know how it got here, but it's found me compatible. It's looking for implants, but it doesn't know if they're still available.\"\n\nI turned to the mech, holding the radio up like a microphone. \"Dr. Chen, it's found me. It says it's from the original team, and its systems are failing. It needs me to find it the implants to become compatible. Do you know where they might be?\"\n\nI waited, watching as the mech's sensors flared again. \"What?\" I asked. \"What?\"\n\nThe mech's body began to twitch and wobble, and I took a step back.\n\n\"I'm sorry, friend.\" Dr. Chen said. \"We failed in replicating the parts. The technology was lost to us. The team was disbanded. They're probably all dead by now.\"\n\nI looked at the mech, wondering how it had found me. \"I'm sorry,\" I said, looking away, unable to meet its gaze.\n\n\"Wait,\" Dr. Chen said. \"It's not impossible to get the technology. I still have all my notes. I can get the team to meet up and work on replicating the implants.\"\n\nI smiled, holding the radio up again. \"Thank you,\" I said, before turning to the mech. \"It's okay. We'll figure something out.\" I put the radio away, looking up at the ancient suit.\n\n\"I do not understand this,\" it spoke, its voice like thunder again. \"You are not in line with my commands. Why are you not taking this seriously?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"You're not exactly giving me much choice,\" I said. \"I know I can't take you up on the offer, but I also know I don't have a choice.\"\n\nThe suit's body twitched again, and I took another step back, its power surge building.\n\n\"It's okay,\" I repeated. \"It's going to be okay. I promise you.\" I placed a hand on its metal shoulder, feeling a strange energy flow from it to me. \"I will find the parts,\" I said, trying to sound confident. \"I will fix your failing systems. But first, I need you to go back to sleep. It's been a long day.\"\n\nThe suit's body relaxed, its power draining as it began to shut down. I waited until its sensors had stopped flaring before reaching out, grabbing the nearby chair and moving it to the side of the suit.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said, sitting down. I wrapped my arms around my head, letting out a sigh as I realized just how tired I was."

        "pred_story": "It's been years since the Great Pandemic, the day the world became a living hell. People ran from the cities, into the wilderness, and that was when the problem became apparent. Most of the people who escaped died shortly after. Some were taken down by a horde of infected, others succumbed to the harsh environment, and many more got into disputes that led to fatalities. People that had nothing to do with the fight over weapons. People who had just wandered into the wrong area.\n\nThe first few years of the pandemic were a mix of chaos and hope. We managed to survive in the wilderness, gathering food and resources. We all shared everything, making sure everyone has enough to live comfortably. But despite that, we lost so many in those years, it was hard to accept that not everyone will make it.\n\nThen one day, I remembered a place that was close to our settlement. I grew up there, in a city with medieval themed theme. There was an armory there, a collection of weapons from medieval era. It was closed to the public, it was only meant for cosplayers. But I was a cosplayer myself. I always loved the history of medieval weapons and armor.\n\nWhen I entered the armory, I saw that some of the weapons and armor were still there. Nothing was missing except for one suit of armor and a large sword. They were probably taken out by some cosplayers. I was not worried, I had enough money to buy those things if they still existed.\n\nI walked around the armory, admiring the artifacts that were still there. They were all beautiful and well preserved, most still in good condition. Some of them were even rare, and I knew some would fetch high prices when I tried to sell them. But first, I had to try them out.\n\nWhen I found the armor, I knew what I had to do. It was too big for me, but I had noticed a few months ago that some cosplayers were using armors meant for people twice their size. They used a combination of fabric and metal to hold the armor in place, and it worked.\n\nI followed the same method, using my knowledge of materials science and engineering to make the armor fit me. I spent two weeks making the armor, making sure it fit me perfectly. It was hot to wear, but it was light, and it would protect me from any attack.\n\nThen I found the sword. It was massive, made from a combination of wood and metal. It weighed a lot, but I could lift it. I had to use a combination of leather straps and wire to tie it to my belt. It was difficult, but I knew that I would need it.\n\nI went back to the settlement, and I told them of my findings. They were skeptical, but when I brought back the armor and the sword, they were amazed. None of them wanted to join me, but one of them decided to.\n\nI named her my apprentice, and together we ventured into the wilderness, searching for other resources. We fought off a few infected, but they were easy to defeat. We even found some supplies that were left by other survivors, and we took some of them for ourselves.\n\nIt was easy to get supplies from abandoned settlements. We didn't fight them, but they still fought us. But we were better prepared, and we defeated them. We even found some cosplayers who had survived in the wilderness, and we helped them. But they were so grateful that they begged us to go back to the city and bring back more supplies.\n\nI knew that this would lead to something big. I knew that soon we would be back to the city, and I was ready to face any threat that would come our way. I knew that the government would be back, and I was ready to fight them.\n\nBut I didn't want to fight them, I wanted to defeat them. I wanted to show them that we were not savages, we were survivors. I wanted to bring back civility to the world. I wanted to show them that we could be civilized again.\n\nIt was the only way I knew how, but I wanted it. And I knew that it would start with us, the cosplayers. We would be the bridge between the past and the future. We would be the bridge between our world and their world.\n\nI knew that this would be difficult. I knew that it would take time. But I was ready to do it. I was ready to show the world that we could be civilized again. I was ready to fight for it.\n\nWe had been back in the city for a few months now, and the supplies that we brought were being distributed among the people. We had managed to establish order, and we were making progress.\n\nSome of the cosplayers had found their old jobs, or started new ones. Some had started families of their own. But we still had work to do. We still had to convince the government that we were not a threat. We still had to show them that we were not savages.\n\nI knew that this would not be easy, but I was ready to do it. I was ready to make them understand that we were not a threat. I was ready to show them that we were not savages. I was ready to fight for it.\n\nAnd I knew that I wouldn't be alone. My apprentice had joined me, and many more had followed her. We had formed a small army of cosplayers, and together we were unstoppable.\n\nI knew that this would lead to something big. I knew that soon we would be facing off against the government. I was ready to face them. I was ready to fight for what was right. I was ready to make them understand that we were not savages.\n\nI was ready to make them understand that we were not a threat. I was ready to show them that we were not a threat. I was ready to fight for it."

        "pred_story": "It was just another day, just another day like all the others. The kind of day where you don't even think about the existence of gods, the kind of day where you don't even think about the nature of divinity. The kind of day where everything seems perfectly normal, where life is just life, where life isn't the most amazing, terrifying, profound and overwhelming experience you can have.\n\nIn fact, it was so normal that I was just going about my day, going about my life, going about my tasks, all of it perfectly mundane. I was in the kitchen, boiling a pot of water, making a cup of tea, when the doorbell rang.  \n\nMy mind went blank for a moment, wondering who it could be. My friend? I didn't expect them at this time of day, but maybe I had forgotten about something. A delivery? That wasn't possible. But then again, I had forgotten to pay for a delivery service last week, and I had assumed they would have to get a note from me, but what if they had just sent it? I went to open the door.\n\nI went to open the door. And there, there on the porch, there was a person, a young woman, with an expectant look on her face. It was a look I saw often, but not often enough. She was waiting for something. She was waiting for something. For me. \n\nShe smiled at me, her eyes bright, her eyes shining with expectation. \"Hi!\" She said, her voice full of warmth. \"Are you...\"\n\nShe stopped there, and I could see her weighing her words, weighing her words. But of course, she didn't have to say them. I saw her eyes widen, I saw her expression change. I saw her mouth open, and I saw her say it.  \n\n\"You're my god,\" she said.\n\nMy heart skipped a beat. She was my follower. It was the moment, the one moment, the moment I had always hoped for. The moment that I had never expected to happen. \n\n\"Thank you,\" I said. \"Thank you.\"\n\nIt was the best thing I had ever heard. I opened the door, and she walked in. We talked, my follower and I, about everything and nothing. We talked about how she had been my follower, how she had been following me for years. She had been following me for years, but she hadn't known it was me. I had been following my own rules, making it as easy or as hard as I wanted it to be. And now I had made it easy. I had made it easy. I had made it easy for her to follow me.\n\nI made her a cup of tea, and we sat down in the living room. We talked about everything, about the world, about life, about death. We talked about everything. She talked about everything, and I listened. And I talked. And she listened. We talked about everything, and it was nice. It was nice.\n\nAnd then she left. She said goodbye, and she left. And I was left here, with this realization. I was left here, with the realization that I was a god. I was a god. I was a god. It was funny. The realization felt strange. It felt strange. It felt strange. And then it felt familiar. It felt familiar. It felt familiar. It felt like something I had always known. It felt like something I had always known. It felt like something I had always known.\n\nI went back to my tea, and drank it. I sat back down on the couch, and I sighed. I sighed, and I smiled. I smiled, and I smiled again. I smiled. I was a god. I was a god. I was a god. It was funny. It was funny."

        "pred_story": "\u201cHold on!\u201d the wizard said, waving his hand. \u201cNot so quick.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d The rogue asked, already pulling the lever.\n\nThe wizard\u2019s hand moved with supernatural speed, stopping the lever mere millimeters from turning. \u201cThat\u2019s the door to the treasure room. And it\u2019s locked by a magical lock. You can\u2019t open it with your strength. You\u2019ll pull the door off its hinges, and probably kill us both in the process.\u201d\n\n\u201cMagic can stop a falling boulder,\u201d the rogue pointed out.\n\n\u201cYeah, but only because I\u2019m in the way,\u201d the wizard said dryly. \u201cThis lock is too heavy for me to break, and if I tried to lift it, it would crush me like an insect. It\u2019s a trap, set by the ancient necromancer who made the treasure room. And if you trigger the lever, it\u2019ll lock you in, making you fight your way out against impossible odds.\u201d The wizard turned to look at the rest of the party. \u201cI know we all want to get the treasure, but this is one risk we don\u2019t have to take.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d the barbarian asked, scratching his stomach through the fur and leather. \u201cWhy not just cast a spell?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I told you, the lock has a magic spell on it that will prevent me from casting a spell to break it.\u201d The wizard\u2019s hand moved again, stopping the rogue\u2019s dagger from cutting the rope. \u201cYou can\u2019t push, pull, or climb to get across. And if you try to use a rope, this will kill us all.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, so what do we do?\u201d The rogue asked. \u201cCan we go back up?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d the wizard said. \u201cThe door we came in through is locked. And even if it wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s twenty floors up. We\u2019d never make it before they catch us and kill us.\u201d\n\nThe barbarian looked around, before his eyes fell on the wall on the side of the room. He walked over to it, looking at it from top to bottom, before he sat down, picking up a piece of chalk from his belt and starting to draw on the wall. \u201cHow about this?\u201d He asked, showing the wizard the diagram. \u201cWe can tunnel through the wall. It\u2019s a better way.\u201d\n\nThe wizard looked at the barbarian\u2019s drawing. \u201cI don\u2019t see how you think that would work,\u201d he said.\n\nThe barbarian shrugged. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like they\u2019d expect us to do something that obvious, right?\u201d He said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than trying to use magic, since it could fail. And it\u2019s not like it could get worse, since it\u2019s just us against a wall. And it\u2019s better than using the rope, since it\u2019s safer. And it\u2019s better than pushing the door, since it won\u2019t break. It\u2019s better than pulling the lever, since it won\u2019t lock us in. And it\u2019s better than climbing up, since we can\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBesides,\u201d the barbarian added, \u201cthere\u2019s a couple of them walking around the floor. If we climb up, they\u2019ll catch us. If we push the door, it\u2019ll kill us. If we pull the lever, it\u2019ll lock us in. But if we dig through, they won\u2019t think of it.\u201d\n\nThe wizard looked at his friend, then at the drawing. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too thin. We can\u2019t dig fast enough. And even if we did, it would collapse, crushing us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the barbarian said. \u201cSo we need to dig fast. That\u2019s why I drew the diagram. It\u2019s a way to dig faster.\u201d\n\nThe wizard looked at the diagram again. \u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEach hole is only half a meter in diameter,\u201d the barbarian explained. \u201cBut we can dig one hole every two meters, and use a pulley to lift the dirt out. It\u2019ll only take us an hour, even with the dirt slowing us down. But we can do it faster than the others make their rounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the barbarian said. \u201cWe need to dig fast. But it\u2019s safer.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d the wizard said. \u201cBut what about the traps?\u201d\n\nThe barbarian shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t see any. If there\u2019s a trap, it\u2019ll be the first thing to get triggered. But there\u2019s nothing.\u201d He looked at the wizard. \u201cSo what do you say? Want to dig?\u201d\n\nThe wizard looked at the barbarian, at the rogue, and at the barbarian again. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d"

        "pred_story": "The forest was quiet. No children laughing in its presence, no dogs barking or playing in its meadows, no birds chirping in its trees. The only noise you could hear was the leaves rustling softly in the wind, and the soft flow of the river as it made its way across the floor of the forest. It was a peaceful place, especially during the night, when you were alone, and the moon was high in the sky.\n\nThe night air was crisp, filled with the scent of flowers and herbs that grew in the forest, and the smell of the river, whose waters were filled with fish and other creatures. The moonlight cast long shadows on the forest floor, making it seem even more peaceful than it really was. The trees were tall, their branches stretching up to the sky, blocking out all light. The forest floor was a mix of dirt and plants, the grasses and wildflowers growing there swaying in the wind. The forest had many paths, each one winding through the forest, each one leading to something different. Some led to streams and rivers, others to the homes of the creatures that lived in the forest, and still others to the homes of the humans who lived nearby.\n\nThe forest was a place of magic, a place where humans could come to find peace, and the creatures of the forest could come to be free from the world of humans. It was a place where magic thrived, and where the spirits of the forest were strong.\n\nIn the center of the forest, there was a cottage, a cozy little home made of sticks and leaves. The cottage was surrounded by plants and flowers, and was filled with the soft glow of candles and lanterns. Smoke curled out of the chimney, carrying with it the scent of cooking food. Inside the cottage, there was a woman, her dark hair tied back in a braid, her eyes shining with a warm golden light. She was humming a soft tune as she cooked, her hands moving with practiced ease as she stirred the pot and added a pinch of this, and a dash of that.\n\nThe woman was a witch, a wise woman who knew everything that happened in the forest. She knew the secrets of the creatures who lived there, and she knew the ways of the forest. She knew its paths, and its dangers, and she knew the way to its magic. She was respected by all, and she kept their secrets, knowing that they would one day be revealed to her.\n\nThe witch looked up as she heard a noise coming from outside the cottage, and she smiled as she saw a young woman standing in the forest, looking at the cottage with a mix of fear and curiosity in her eyes. The witch sighed, and she finished cooking her dinner before she went outside to greet the girl. The girl was trembling slightly as the witch approached her, but she did not run. She looked into the witch's eyes, and saw the kindness and understanding that shone there, and she knew that she had come to the right place.\n\n\u201cHello little one, I am so glad that you have come,\u201d the witch said, as she put a gentle hand on the girl's shoulder. \u201cTell me, why did you come here?\u201d\n\nThe girl swallowed hard, and then she began to explain, telling the witch of her dreams, and of the visions that had haunted her since she was a child. She told of the visions of the forest, and of the magic that lay there, and of the witch that lived in the forest, who could teach her the secrets of the forest and the magic that lay within. The witch listened, her eyes shining with understanding and kindness as the girl spoke.\n\n\u201cYour visions are correct, you are here to learn the secrets of the forest, and its magic,\u201d the witch said, as she smiled. \u201cBut first, we must eat, and rest, for tomorrow will be a long day.\u201d\n\nThe witch led the girl to the cottage, where she was fed and bathed. She was given a room to sleep in, where she rested easily, knowing that she was safe, and that she would be taught the secrets of the forest and its magic.\n\nThe next morning, the witch woke the girl early, and she led her out of the cottage and into the forest. The girl followed the witch as she led her along a winding path, one that took them deeper and deeper into the forest, until they reached a clearing. In the center of the clearing, there was a great oak tree, one that was taller than any other tree in the forest. The witch stopped in front of the tree, and she looked up at it with a sad expression.\n\n\u201cThis is a place of great magic,\u201d the witch said, as she looked up at the tree. \u201cBut it is also a place of great danger. The spirits of the forest are strong here, and they are not to be trifled with. If you wish to learn their secrets, you must first prove yourself worthy.\u201d\n\nThe girl nodded, and the witch smiled. \u201cThen let us begin,\u201d she said, as she stepped back, and raised her hands to the sky. \u201cCall upon the spirits, and ask for their help.\u201d\n\nThe girl looked at the tree, and she felt a surge of energy flow through her. She raised her hands, and she called upon the spirits of the forest, asking for their help, and their guidance. The witch smiled, and she began to chant, her voice growing louder, and more powerful, as she spoke. The air around her began to glow, and the girl felt a surge of energy flow through her, one that filled her with a sense of wonder, and magic.\n\nThe girl looked up at the tree, and she saw a glow emanating from it, a glow that grew brighter, and brighter, until it was like a fire in the sky. The girl felt a surge of energy, one that filled her with a sense of wonder, and magic, and she knew that she had been given a great gift. She was filled with the magic of the forest, and with its secrets. She knew the way to the tree, and she knew the dangers that lay along its path. She knew the secrets of the forest, and its magic, and she knew that she would always be able to return to the witch, and to learn more.\n\nThe girl thanked the witch, and the witch smiled. \u201cYou have been given a great gift, one that I am glad to have shared with you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut remember, the magic of the forest is a gift that must be used wisely. It is a powerful thing, and it must be treated with respect.\u201d\n\nThe girl nodded, and the witch smiled. \u201cThen go, little one, and remember that I am always here to help you, and to guide you, if you need it.\u201d\n\nThe girl thanked the witch, and she left the clearing, returning to the cottage, where she was given food and drink, and where she rested for the rest of the day. The next day, the witch taught the girl more about the forest, and its magic. She taught her of its secrets, and of the dangers that lay along its paths. The girl listened, and she learned, and she knew that she had been given a great gift."

        "pred_story": "So, you're immortal. I know, I know, it's not *technically* immortal, you've been killed loads of times, but still, you're still walking around so that's cool. \n\nI'm not really a fan of immortals, but you've made some good choices recently, so I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt. \n\nSo, how did you die this time? Another car accident? \n\nNope. \n\nA drowning accident? \n\nNope. \n\nYou actually died when you were 17 years old and you were shot by a dude in a white robe with a cross. \n\nYou've been dead in the most boring way possible. \n\nI hate you so much. \n\nI know you're not actually dead though, so stop pretending you are. You just decided to take a break from life, that's cool, but stop saying you're dead. \n\nI'm still waiting for you to wake up, so if you're out there, I hope you're happy being the only immortal from 1986. I'm still not giving you any gifts, and I'm not going to start playing Dungeons and Dragons with you until you acknowledge that being a wizard is stupid. \n\nI'm also not going to let you join my fantasy football league until you admit that being the oldest wizard ever is cool. \n\nI'm actually very jealous of you, but I'm still not going to give you any gifts, you don't deserve any, since you don't think that immortals should exist. \n\nI'm also going to take your spot in the fantasy football league, and I'm going to make sure that I'm the most successful immortal wizard, since I know that I can do better than you. \n\nI'm also going to make sure that I'm not just the oldest wizard ever, but I'm also going to be the greatest wizard that ever lived. \n\nYou're probably still thinking about how old you're getting, and how being immortal is more of a curse than a blessing. \n\nYou should've just enjoyed being 17, and you should've never made any decisions for yourself. \n\nYou should've never chosen to be a wizard in the first place. \n\nYou should've never tried to be more than just a regular 17 year old boy. \n\nYou should've never chosen to be born in the middle of the 20th century. \n\nYou should've just been born in ancient times, like the Middle Ages or something. \n\nBut you didn't, and now you're stuck being immortal. \n\nYou should've been stuck in ancient times, where life was short, and there were very few opportunities. \n\nBut you weren't, you were born in 1986, and you didn't just live a normal life, you chose to make yourself into a wizard. \n\nYou should've never made that choice. \n\nI'm so jealous of you right now. \n\nI'm actually happy that you're not here, because you make me so jealous. \n\nI'm really hoping that you don't come back, because that would mean that you've been a better wizard than me. \n\nThat would be really disappointing. \n\nSo, stay dead, I mean, don't come back, and don't try to come back. \n\nI'm going to start my fantasy football league, and I'm going to make sure that I'm the most successful immortal wizard that ever lived. \n\nYou're probably going to be very disappointed. \n\nYou should've never made that choice. \n\nIf you're watching me, you should've never made the choice to be born in the 20th century. \n\nYou should've never tried to be a wizard. \n\nYou should've just been born in ancient times, where life was very short. \n\nThat would've been so much better for you."

        "pred_story": "The three of us stood at the base of the mountain we were going to climb and, with a look to our companion, we all gave a thumbs up. The wind was cold and it was clear this would be a very difficult climb. It was the first day of the year and we were a party of four going to ascend Mount Wuyi. A trip of 72 hours.  \n \nWe all knew it was a difficult one but it was a challenge we were all eager to take on. The cold wind howled on us as we began to climb up the mountain. We had no gear, no map and no food. We had nothing except each other and we knew the challenge we were about to take. But still we were all set.  \n \nAs we were climbing up the mountain, the air was getting thinner and thinner. We were all wearing masks but it was hard to catch our breath. We knew we had to slow down and climb as slow as we could. After three hours of climbing, we had to stop. We stopped to take a break.  \n \nThe sun was high in the sky and we were all exhausted. We were all sweating, and the wind was blowing hard. We all had to sit down and catch our breath. There were no clouds in the sky, and the sun was shining bright. The wind was strong and it was hard to stand.  \n \nAfter resting for a while, we continued to climb up the mountain. We climbed up and up and up until the sun began to set. As the sun went down, we began to lose our way. We had to stop again and rest. We had to put up a tent to camp for the night. But there was a problem.  \n \nAs we were setting up the tent, we heard the roar of a beast. The ground began to shake and the mountain began to tremble. It was massive. The beast was huge. We all knew this was no ordinary beast. It was a giant beast. It was a beast of the mountain.  \n \nWe all froze in fear. It was our first time seeing such a massive beast. We were all scared. It was climbing up the mountain and was closing in on us. We all froze as it approached us. The beast was a giant serpent. Its body was massive and its head was like a snake. It was so massive and terrifying.  \n \nThe three of us were all frozen in fear. We knew this was the end of us. The serpent was closing in on us. We could see it clearly and we were frozen in fear. We knew this was the end of us.  \n \nBut then a voice echoed in our mind. \"Don't be afraid, I'm not here to hurt you.\" The voice was clear and calm. We were all shocked and didn't know what to do. \"Why?\" We replied.  \n \n\"You are not here to cause any harm. You are just here to challenge yourselves. And I'm here to test you. And I'm not going to hurt you. And I will spare you if you can pass my test.\" The voice was clear and calm. We all were amazed and were curious. \"How?\" We all asked.  \n \nThe beast roared in laughter. \"I will show you how. You will have to face a challenge. And if you can pass, I will spare you.\" The beast spoke. \"First, we have to climb up this mountain. But this is the easy part. You can climb up the mountain if you want. But the mountain is very steep and the air is thin.\" The beast spoke. \"Then, we have to go through a cave. The cave is full of snakes and bats. It is dark, cold and damp. And you have to go through it fast.\" The beast spoke. \"Then, we have to jump down from the cave. The jump is long and it is high. And we have to jump to the right spot.\" The beast spoke. \"Then, we have to climb down a tree. The tree is very steep and it is slippery.\" The beast spoke. \"Finally, we have to cross a river. The river is cold and it is deep. And we have to cross it carefully.\" The beast spoke.  \n \nThe four of us all stood in shock. This was an impossible challenge. We all looked at each other and knew we had to do it. We all knew this was a challenge we had to take. The four of us all stood up and began to climb up the mountain. We climbed up and up until we reached the cave. We all knew this was the easy part.  \n \nWe all stood at the entrance of the cave and looked at each other. We knew this was the part where we had to be careful. We all knew it was dark, cold and damp inside the cave. We all took a deep breath and entered the cave. It was dark, cold and damp inside the cave. There were snakes and bats all over. We all knew we had to go through it fast.  \n \nWe all ran and ran until we reached the end of the cave. We all stopped and took a deep breath. We had made it through the cave. It was a difficult part. But we had made it through.  \n \nWe all stood at the end of the cave and looked at each other. We knew this was the part where we had to jump down. The jump was long and it was high. We all looked at each other and knew we had to do it. We all stood at the edge of the cave and looked down. It was a long and steep jump.  \n \nWe all looked at each other and knew we had to jump. We all closed our eyes and jumped. It was a long and steep jump. We all knew we had to be careful. We had to jump to the right spot. We all opened our eyes and saw we had made it.  \n \nWe all stood at the bottom of the cave and looked at each other. We knew this was the part where we had to climb. We knew it was a steep and slippery climb. But we all knew we had to do it. We all looked at each other and knew we had to do it. We all stood at the base of the tree and looked up. It was steep and slippery.  \n \nWe all looked at each other and knew we had to climb. We all closed our eyes and climbed up. It was a steep and slippery climb. We all knew we had to be careful. We all opened our eyes and saw we had made it.  \n \nWe all stood at the top of the tree and looked at each other.

        "pred_story": "So the world was saved for the umpteenth time. The villain was defeated, the city was saved, and as soon as it was all over the news was saying how the villain was lucky because it was only a hero who saved the day. Lucky? That was rich.\n\nThe villain, was a man who had stolen a bomb from an armed forces base. He had threatened to detonate the bomb in the middle of the city and kill everyone. It was one of those situations where a hero had to save the day to stop the bomb from going off and killing thousands of innocent people.\n\nThe hero saved the day by destroying the bomb with an arrow shot out of a bow. He was a good hero, no one could deny that, but when you look at it, it was a pretty ridiculous situation. The hero had saved thousands of lives, but he had still managed to kill a lot of people. The hero was in the building right behind the bomb, and he had been forced to blast it out of the building. \n\nThe explosion was pretty big, and the building had been destroyed. So even though the hero had saved the day, he had still destroyed a building, killed thousands of people, and left thousands more homeless. The news was still talking about it, and how lucky the city was that it had been saved.\n\nBut some people weren't so lucky.\n\nAs the news talked about the hero saving the day, a group of people were breaking into a house on the other side of the city. The people in the group were the ones who had been responsible for the city's downfall. They had been a part of a terrorist organization, and they had been working together to take down the city. They had been successful, the city was now in shambles.\n\nThe people in the group had been in the city for a week, and they had been taking advantage of the hero's absence. They had been stealing from people, robbing homes, and murdering those who got in their way. They had been able to get away with it because the city was still in shock from the bombing.\n\nAs the people in the group entered the home, one of them noticed a light coming from upstairs. The person looked at the others and said, \"Do you hear that?\" They all looked up at the stairs, and one of them said, \"Do you smell that?\" The group all looked at each other, and one of them said, \"Oh my god, we're not alone.\" They all screamed and started running away from the stairs.\n\nAs they ran, they heard footsteps coming from the upstairs. The footsteps were heavy, and the group knew that they were not a match for whoever was coming down the stairs. They were running for their lives, and they knew that they would be dead if they got caught.\n\nThe people in the group kept running, and they were able to get out of the house. They all ran to the car that they had been using, and they were able to get in. They were able to drive away from the house, and they were able to get away from the hero.\n\nAs they drove away, they knew that they would be caught sooner or later. They had been able to get away with their crimes, but they knew that it would only be a matter of time before the hero caught up with them. The hero had saved the day, but he had still managed to get away.\n\nThe people in the group drove for a while, and they were able to get out of the city. They had been able to get away from the hero, and they knew that they would be safe for a little while. They had been able to get away, but they knew that they would be caught sooner or later.\n\nAs they drove, they all looked at each other. They knew that they would be caught, and they knew that they would be punished for their crimes. They were all scared, and they knew that their time was coming to an end.\n\nBut it was coming too soon.\n\nAs they were driving, they saw a light coming from up ahead. The light was bright, and it was shining off the road. The people in the group looked at each other, and one of them said, \"Oh my god, it's the hero.\" The group all screamed and started to panic.\n\nAs they panicked, the light became brighter. It was so bright that they were unable to see anything. The group all screamed and started to run, but it was too late.\n\nThe group was driving into the light, and they were unable to see what was ahead. They were driving into a beam of light that was so bright that it blinded them. They were unable to see what was coming towards them, and they were unable to stop.\n\nAs they drove into the light, they saw a flash of red light coming from their right. The light was going so fast, and it was unable to be avoided. The group saw the light coming towards them, but they were unable to do anything.\n\nThe group was unable to stop, and they were unable to go off the road. They were unable to do anything except watch as the light went through their car. They all saw a flash of red light come through the window, and they were unable to breathe.\n\nThe group all watched as the light went through their car. They all saw the light go through their bodies, and they were unable to breathe. The group all died instantly, and they were unable to see the light come through the car.\n\nThe light continued on, and it was able to see everything. The light was able to see the inside of the car, and it was able to see the people inside. The light was able to see the people inside the car, and it was able to see that they were dead.\n\nThe light continued on, and it was able to see the city behind the car. The light was able to see the city that had been in ruins, and it was able to see the people who were still alive. The light was able to see the people who were still alive, and it was able to see that they were scared.\n\nThe light continued on, and it was able to see the world behind the city. The light was able to see the world that had been in chaos, and it was able to see the people who were still alive. The light was able to see the people who were still alive, and it was able to see that they were scared.\n\nThe light continued on, and it was able to see the hero who had saved the day. The light was able to see the hero who had saved the day, and it was able to see that he was gone. The light was able to see the hero who had saved the day, and it was able to see that he was nowhere to be found.\n\nThe light was able to see the hero who had saved the day, and it was able to see that he was gone.

I have the power to grant wishes and do not know what you mean, I have nothing to be humble about. I have done nothing with my life.\u201d A tear dropped from his eye and fell to the floor.\n\nMy friend sighed and said, \u201cI know you do not want to admit it, but you have done something special, and I know it if you do not.\u201d He stood and walked over to the genie and placed his hand on his shoulder and said, \u201cListen, I know that you do not think you have done anything with your life, but you are wrong. I have come to realize this now that I am older. Your power is not something you can be humbled about. It is a gift that you should hold on to and use it to make the world a better place.\u201d He paused and looked at the genie with tears in his eyes and said, \u201cYou are a good man, and I know that you will do something special with your life. It is hard to do something special with a gift like this. You are not like a lot of people. You are a good person and I am sure that you will be able to make a difference with it.\u201d\n\nThe genie looked up at him and said, \u201cI do not understand what you are saying, I am but a genie, and I have done nothing special with my life. I have only wished for things that people have told me to wish for. I have done as I have been told and have not done anything special with my life.\u201d He looked around the room and said, \u201cI have only been here for a few days, but I have come to realize how useless my existence is.\u201d\n\nMy friend walked over to the genie and looked him in the eyes and said, \u201cNo, you have done more with your life than you realize. You have done things that no one else can. You have made my life better, and I am sure that you have done the same for a lot of other people. You are a kind soul, and you have a special gift, you are a good person.\u201d The genie looked around the room, and tears fell from his eyes.\n\nMy friend walked over to the genie and picked up a small white tablet and looked at it and said, \u201cWe have been tracking your location for months, and we have come to realize that you are not like most genies. You are kind, and you do not wish for things that you want. You wish for things that will make people happy. You are a good man, and we are sure that you will make a difference with your life.\u201d The genie looked at him and said, \u201cI do not understand, why are you saying this? Why are you telling me this? Why are you being so kind to me?\u201d\n\nMy friend picked up a small white tablet and said, \u201cWe have been tracking your location for months. We know your name, and we know that you have been around for a long time. We know that you have made people happy, and that you are a kind soul. We know that you have a special gift, and that you have used it to make the world a better place.\u201d The genie looked at him and said, \u201cWhat do you mean? You are telling me that I am not like other genies? I have never heard of you. I thought that I was the only genie in the world.\u201d\n\nMy friend sat on the floor and looked at the genie and said, \u201cWe have been watching you for a long time. We have come to realize that you are not like other genies. You are kind, and you have a special gift. We want to make sure that you do not wish for anything that will make you unhappy. We want to make sure that you are happy and that you can use your gift to make the world a better place.\u201d The genie looked at him and said, \u201cI do not understand. Why are you being so kind to me? Why are you talking to me in this way? I have never met anyone like you.\u201d\n\nMy friend looked at the genie and said, \u201cI am not being kind to you, I am being kind to myself. I want to make sure that you are happy and that you can use your gift to make the world a better place. I want to make sure that you can make a difference with your life. I want to make sure that you can do something special with your life.\u201d The genie looked at him and said, \u201cWhat do you mean? I have done nothing special with my life.

I have only done as I have been told.\u201d\n\nMy friend looked at the genie and said, \u201cWe know that you have done nothing special with your life, but we also know that you can. We know that you can do something special with your life. We know that you can use your gift to make the world a better place. We know that you can make a difference with your life. We know that you can do something special with your life, and we want to help you. We want to make sure that you can do something special with your life.\u201d The genie looked at him and said, \u201cWhy are you talking to me like this? Why are you being so kind to me?

His hair was pale, his eyes a deep red. His skin was smooth, with no hair. His nose was perfectly straight. He had no beard. \"This, Kellia, where I am standing, is supposed to be grasslands. In fact, it was grasslands. Last year, it was grasslands. Why is there a... a... city here?\" He asked.\n\n\"I am not sure, prince. But I can go and see,\" She said.\n\n\"No, go and come back. I want to hear it from you.\"\n\nShe nodded and was gone. \n\nPrince Harlon stood there for a long time, staring down the buildings. He couldn't believe it. They had been back for only a short time, and now the city that had been here was gone. \n\nBut now it was back. \n\nKellia returned, with a small group of elves. \"Prince Harlon, it is as you say. There is a city here. And the elves who are here, are human.\"\n\n\"What?!\" He cried. \"That is impossible. I will not believe it. Take me to the elven lord.\" He said.\n\nKellia nodded, and led the prince to the elven lord's palace. The prince was in a state of pure shock. He didn't know what to do. \n\nThey arrived at the palace and the lord stepped out. He was old. Even older than the prince. \"Ah, prince Harlon. So good to see you. I understand you are confused as to why there is a city here. Well, let me tell you. It is because I know you are not coming back.\"\n\nThe prince was shocked. \"How did you know?!\" He asked.\n\n\"Ah. The prince Harlon is coming back. And the elves are going to be here.\" The elven lord answered. \n\n\"I... I... But we were not supposed to be here!\" The prince stammered.\n\n\"Ah, yes. And that is why there is a city here. Because I know you will be here. And I will make sure this city will be well taken care of. As it should be.\" The elven lord said. \n\nThe prince smiled. \"But how do you know this?!\"\n\n\"Ah. The elven lord knows. The prince Harlon is coming back.\" The elven lord said.\n\nThe prince was in shock again. \"I... I... I understand.\" He said.\n\nThe prince left and headed back to the grasslands, with Kellia by his side. They didn't say a word. The prince was in shock, still trying to understand. \n\nBut he knew that he would be back."

        "pred_story": "I have to admit, as the Dark Knight of Shadows, that is the first time I\u2019ve been caught off guard like that.\n\nThe Dark Knight of Shadows was the name given to me when I first created the Shadow Blade. A black sword that shines with an ominous red glow. My name is not known to anyone in the Kingdom as I operate from the shadows, striking fear in anyone who hears about my exploits.\n\nThis one however, was an amateur compared to the others I have dealt with. \n\nI had to wait until he tried to use his magic to cast a fireball at me. As soon as he did, I struck his arm with a swift strike from my shadow blade. It had the desired effect as he had fallen to the ground, his arm severed. The other mages stopped their attacks and stepped back, looking at each other. \n\nThe leader, that pathetic excuse of a mage, was kneeling on the ground. His eyes widened as he looked at his severed arm, then at me.\n\n\u201cHa! Kneel before me puny wielder of light! In the darkness your power means nothing! HOW ARE YOU GLOWING?!\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t hesitate. I took a step forward and unsheathed my shadow blade, bringing it down onto his neck. He managed to roll away just in time to avoid the death blow. As he did, he released a dark energy from his severed arm, hitting me.\n\nThe energy shot right through me, leaving me unharmed. I couldn\u2019t help but grin at his failure.\n\n\u201cYou call that a dark energy? That was barely enough to hurt me.\u201d\n\nI approached him, my shadow blade shining with red light. He looked at me with a nervous look, then looked at his severed arm. He didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\u201cPlease! Spare me! I beg of you! I\u2019ll never use my dark magic again!\u201d\n\nI laughed at his words. \u201cYou\u2019ll never use your dark magic again? You\u2019ve been using it since you were a child! Why would I believe that?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me with a terrified look, \u201cI... I promise! I\u2019ll never use it again! I\u2019ll join the light magic side! I\u2019ll be a good mage! Please spare me!\u201d\n\nI laughed again. \u201cYou\u2019ll never change. The only thing you know is dark magic. It\u2019s a part of who you are.\u201d\n\nThe other mages were looking at me in horror. Their leader was trying to reach for his severed arm, but he couldn\u2019t. I approached him and held out my shadow blade. He took it and held it to his neck.\n\n\u201cPlease! You can\u2019t kill me! I need my severed arm! I need to heal!\u201d\n\nI smiled at his desperation. \u201cI can\u2019t help you with that. If you want to join the light magic side, you\u2019ll have to join me.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me with confusion. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nI looked at my shadow blade, the red glow shining brighter. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you how to use the Shadow Blade. It\u2019s a powerful sword that can bring anyone under my control. The red glow is the dark energy of the sword. It\u2019s what gives me my powers.\u201d\n\nHe looked at the sword with confusion. \u201cWhat? Why would I want to use a sword that has a red glow?\u201d\n\nI looked at him with a grin. \u201cBecause with the red glow, you\u2019ll be able to take control of anyone! You\u2019ll be able to rule the kingdom!\u201d\n\nI could see the greed in his eyes as he looked at the shadow blade. He was tempted.\n\n\u201cPlease! Let me try!\u201d\n\nI smiled at his words. \u201cI want to see if you\u2019re worthy to wield the Shadow Blade. Take my shadow blade and hold it out to your other mages.\u201d\n\nHe took the shadow blade and held it out to his other mages. As soon as they touched the shadow blade, they all fell under my control. The leader didn\u2019t know what was happening to them.\n\nI looked at him with a smile, \u201cYou see? I knew you would be worthy of the Shadow Blade. Now, join me and we\u2019ll take over the kingdom!\u201d\n\nHe looked at the other mages as they fell to their knees, bowing to me.\n\n\u201cI... I don\u2019t know if I can control them.\u201d\n\nI laughed at his words. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be controlling them from now on. All you need to do is carry out the commands. Now, let\u2019s go and see the king.\u201d\n\nWe left the scene of battle and made our way to the king\u2019s castle. The kingdom was on high alert, but we were able to bypass their guards easily. We reached the king\u2019s chambers and I could see the fear in his eyes. \n\nThe leader looked at me with confusion, \u201cHow do you know the king?\u201d \n\nI smiled at him, \u201cMy powers are not limited to just the shadows. I have a vast knowledge of the kingdom. Now, kill the king!\u201d\n\nI could see the king\u2019s eyes widen in horror. \u201cNo! Please! You\u2019re not going to kill me!\u201d\n\nThe leader tried to bring his shadow blade down, but I caught his arm.\n\n\u201cNo! You\u2019re not going to kill him! I\u2019m taking over the kingdom. He\u2019ll be useful as a hostage.\u201d\n\nI looked at the king and smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my friend. You\u2019ll be able to live in peace once the darkness has passed. For now, keep your mouth shut and enjoy the show.\u201d\n\nI turned to the leader, \u201cNow, let\u2019s go and find the royal treasure. That will be the first step towards our domination of the kingdom.\u201d\n\nThe leader nodded and followed me out of the king\u2019s chambers. We left the king and his guards behind."
