        "pred_story": "\u201cWhy are you giving my newborn baby a dagger?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell they\u2019re a chosen one, which means that I\u2019m destined to be killed by them; but honestly I\u2019ve been waiting centuries for them to be born and I just want to get it over with.\u201d\n\nMy wife stares at me with a look of shock and disgust as I hand the baby a dagger. It has a wooden handle wrapped in red leather straps. It\u2019s an awkward looking dagger, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m just tired. We\u2019ve been waiting for the birth of this baby for a long time and I\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019ve been waiting so long that I\u2019m now just a shell of my former self. The only thing keeping me going is knowing that the birth of this baby means that my curse will finally be broken.\n\n\u201cWhy do you need me to stab this baby?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m tired of living and I\u2019m tired of waiting. I\u2019m tired of being a servant to this curse. I just want it to end. And the only way that it can end is with my death. If I\u2019m not around then the curse won\u2019t continue.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you talking to me? Why not the baby\u2019s parents?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause they\u2019ll never believe me. I\u2019m just a servant to this family for the last two hundred years and they don\u2019t know anything about this curse. But you\u2019re different. You\u2019re a stranger. You don\u2019t care about me or this curse. You just care about your baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is crazy. Why don\u2019t you just die? I\u2019m sure you can just walk off a cliff or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause that\u2019s not how it works. I can\u2019t just die. I\u2019m bound to this family. If I die then the curse will just go back to the next family member. I\u2019ve been trying to find a way out of it for centuries, but nothing has worked. I\u2019ve been talking to the next few servants and they\u2019re all the same. They\u2019re all tired. They all want out.\u201d\n\nMy wife looks at me with tears in her eyes. She can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m talking about a baby being stabbed by a stranger. This is something out of a horror movie. But I don\u2019t care. If this is what it takes to end this curse then I\u2019m willing to do it. I\u2019m just tired. I\u2019m tired of this curse. I\u2019m tired of waiting. I\u2019m tired of being bound to this family. I just want out.\n\n\u201cThen why are you giving my baby a dagger? Why are you letting me be a part of this?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I need a hand. I need someone to help me with this. I\u2019m just too tired to do it myself. But I know that you\u2019ll never do it. I know that you love this baby too much to let it die. And that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t want you to do it either. I just want someone to be the one to do it. Someone to end this curse once and for all.\u201d\n\nI hand her the dagger and she stares at it in her hand. She\u2019s not sure what to do. She\u2019s not sure if she wants to be a part of this. But she\u2019s my wife and she knows that I\u2019m not lying. She knows that I\u2019m tired. She knows that this is what I need.\n\n\u201cAre you sure? Are you sure that this is what you want? Are you sure that you don\u2019t want to try to find a way out?\u201d\n\nI sigh and look at her with tears in my eyes. I\u2019m not sure. I really don\u2019t know if this is what I want. I just know that I\u2019m tired. I just know that I want out. I know that she loves me, but I also know that she\u2019s scared. She\u2019s scared of losing me. But I know that she\u2019ll never lose me. I know that this is my time. My time to die. My time to end this curse. I just know that it\u2019s time for me to go. But I know that I\u2019m not ready to go. I\u2019m not ready to die."

        "pred_story": "I was walking to work when I saw them. They were standing in front of the cafe that I was going to grab a coffee at. Normally, I would walk past them and ignore them but my curiosity got the better of me and I went inside. The barista looked up at me and I asked what kind of coffee they had. \"Your usual?\" she replied. I nodded and she started making me a latte. She didn't usually make my coffee that early, but that was because I was the last one to start work so she never got a chance to make it. \n\nAs I was waiting for my drink, I looked at the woman again. She was wearing some kind of military uniform and had earpieces in her ear. She looked out of place but it was a quiet morning so she hadn't stood out that much. The barista handed me my latte and I asked her if the woman had come in for anything. She looked like she was about to say something when the woman suddenly strode in and walked over to us. \"Ma'am, I'm not sure if you remember me, but we met before. I was with the government and you were part of a program that was about to be terminated.\" She looked out of place standing in the cafe, but she didn't seem to care about what the other patrons were thinking.\n\nI didn't recognize her and I looked at the barista to see if she was in on the joke. She was staring at the woman with an expressionless face and I realized that she must have been a time traveller like the woman. \"I don't know what you're talking about. My name is Emily and I work here.\" The woman scoffed at that and she pointed a finger at me. \"I know that you are Emily. If you don't remember me, that's not my problem. My job is to get you to cancel your job for the day and go home. If you don't do that, you will be terminated.\" She had a firm stance as she spoke, but she had a hint of a smile on her face. It was clear that she was joking and the barista was in on it.\n\nThe barista was holding a mop and was looking at her with an expressionless face. She had to be in on it because there was no other reason for her to hold a mop in the middle of the cafe. It was a normal day and the only people in the cafe were the barista, the woman, and me. I looked at the woman again and decided to play along. \"Terminated, you say? What do I need to do to be terminated?\" She frowned at that. \"I don't have time to mess around. You need to stop what you're doing today and go home. You can't do anything important or else we risk everything being terminated. I'm not going to explain it again, so I would appreciate it if you would just do what I'm saying.\" She seemed to be serious again, but she was smiling.\n\nI laughed at that. \"So, you're saying that everything we've ever done is going to be terminated?\" She sighed at that. \"Look, we've been over this before. I don't have time to explain it to you again. Just go home and we'll take care of the rest.\" I took another sip of my coffee and looked around at the barista. She was still holding the mop and didn't seem to be doing anything. She also had her phone out and was typing something. I looked back at the woman and shook my head. \"I need a day off to watch the game with my family. I'm not going to risk messing up the game for the season.\" She was getting frustrated now. \"Look, we've been over this before. I don't have time to explain it to you again. Just go home and we'll take care of the rest.\"\n\nI got up and grabbed my bag and left the cafe. I could hear her sighing behind me. I couldn't help but laugh at her. She was so out of place standing in the cafe, dressed in her military uniform and standing on top of the coffee table. She didn't seem to care, though. She was too focused on getting me to do what she was saying. I got to work and headed to my office. I didn't see her again until I got back home and she was standing on my front steps with a look of concern on her face. \"Look, I understand that you need time with your family. However, I'm here to tell you that you need to be somewhere else today. You can't be there.\" I looked at her again. I had seen her before, but I didn't know what she was doing here. \n\n\"I know that you're a time traveller, but why are you telling me to go home?\" She sighed at that. \"Look, I'm going to level with you. I'm here to stop something from happening today. It's something that will change everything and if you're there, it will all be ruined.\" I looked at her with a confused expression. \"What are you talking about? Nothing bad ever happens here. The government is watching over us and everything is fine. Why are you saying that?\" She frowned at that. \n\n\"Look, the government doesn't exist like you think it does. They've been lying to you for years. The world is constantly at risk of being destroyed and if we don't do something to stop it, we'll all be wiped out. We can't do anything to stop it until you go back home. I'm not going to explain it to you again, so just go home.\" I looked at her again. I didn't understand what she was talking about. I didn't believe her, but I didn't have a reason not to. I nodded and headed inside.\n\nI walked around the house, trying to find something to do. I decided to make some breakfast and started cracking eggs into a bowl. As I was whisking them together, I heard her voice in my head. \"Are you done yet? I still need to stop something from happening.\" I didn't hear her voice coming from my ear and didn't hear anything else. I walked around the house again and looked for her. \n\nI didn't see her anywhere but heard her again. \"I'm still here. Don't think that you can get rid of me that easily.\" I walked around the house and tried to find her again. I didn't see her, but I heard her again. \"I'm still here. I'm going to be here for a while, so you might as well make yourself comfortable.\" I looked at my watch and saw that it was still morning. I couldn't believe her. \"You're saying that the apocalypse is going to happen today? I don't believe you. I'm not going to go home.\" She sighed again and I heard her again. \"You're not listening to me. If you're not here, then you won't be there when it happens. You'll be alive and we'll be able to fix the timeline.\" I looked around the house again and saw that she was gone. \n\nI heard her again. \"I'm still here. I know that you can hear me, even if you're not"

You keep going until you drop dead, because innocent people die screaming if you don't.\" He was screaming and pointing at the kids in the room, but they didn't get it. I didn't get it. He was a weird, mean man in a suit, but none of us really understood what he meant. Or maybe we did, but I was too young to realize it.\n\nI had a lot of questions about that night, but the answer was the same. \"Too bad.\" \"You don't get to retire.\" \"You just keep going.\" It was a lesson I'd learn over and over again throughout my life, but I'd never quite understand it.\n\nEven now, lying here in the hospital bed, the man's words keep playing in my mind. \"You don't get to retire. You just keep going.\"\n\nIt's strange, because when most people retire, they're done. They spend their days reading books, playing cards, and taking naps. They're free from the stress and pressure of their old jobs, but they're still alive. They still get to go home, sleep in their own bed, and hug their family. But I'm not going to do any of that.\n\nThe infection has spread. I'm going to die tonight, or tomorrow, or the day after that. But the man was right. There's a life after death. There's a way to continue on, even when our bodies no longer work. There's a way to keep going, no matter what.\n\nThe nurse is here. \"How are you feeling?\" she asks, but I just shake my head. There's no answer to that. \"Are you in pain?\" I shake my head again. \"Are you cold? Do you need a blanket?\" I shake my head a third time. \n\nThe nurse sighs. \"Okay, well, let's get some rest. Sleep well, and try to go peacefully.\" I smile, but she doesn't understand. I'm not going to die, not really. I'm just going to leave this place, to step into something new and wonderful."

But we need you to help us.\"\n\nColonel Pierce smiled. \"What makes you think I'd be interested in something like that?\"\n\nThe general smiled back. \"Because you're a stupid man with a short attention span, and you'd much rather be dead than boring,\" he said. \"So, how about it? Will you help us?\"\n\nColonel Pierce shrugged. \"What do I have to do?\" he asked.\n\n\"Go to a place called Arcturus 5,\" said the general. \"You will arrive there in six months. When you arrive, you will ask them to come to a place called Jupiter 8. They will accept. And you will deliver the message.\"\n\n\"Jupiter 8,\" he said. \"What is that?\"\n\nThe general sighed. \"What's the matter with you?\" he asked. \"You're a colonel, and you don't know where Jupiter is?\"\n\n\"Jupiter 8 is Jupiter 7's new moon,\" said the general. \"We just named it. You will tell the people of Arcturus 5 that we need their scientists.\"\n\n\"They will accept,\" said the general. \"They are a peaceful people. When they arrive on Jupiter 8, you will tell them to go to their ship and turn their engines off.\"\n\nThe general nodded. \"Then you will turn your engines off, and you will let us know how it goes.\"\n\n\"Arcturus 5,\" he said. \"I never heard of such a place. Are they a civilized people?\"\n\n\"They're a civilization of scientists,\" said the general. \"But they've been having a lot of conflicts with other alien civilizations. They can't fight a war anymore. They've been using their technology to fight, but it's been causing too many deaths. They're starting to use other methods to kill each other. We have to stop it before it's too late.\"\n\nColonel Pierce shook his head. \"You're right,\" he said. \"We have to do something about it.\"\n\nThe general smiled. \"And it will be fun to watch them fight.\""

        "pred_story": "\"Uh, Boss? What do we do now that we've beaten the Hero?\"\n\nThe leader of our army, the Dark Lord Xarxos, turned his attention towards me. For a moment, I wondered if he'd been cursed like everyone else on our side. He could just be a mindless husk, a shell of a man with no free will. Instead, he stared at me for a few seconds.\n\n\"Is that question rhetorical, General?\"\n\nI looked to my second-in-command. He gave me a brief nod.\n\n\"I assume it is. After all, the Dark Lord's plan worked. The hero fell, the land is secure, the people are enslaved, and you are now the Dark Lord.\"\n\nHe chuckled. His eyes glinted in the dim light of the room.\n\n\"Actually, my old friend,\" he said, \"you are the Dark Lord now. I've... retired.\"\n\nI could only stare at him, unsure if the man had gone mad. He'd always been a ruthless leader, but never a madman.\n\n\"You're just going to retire? You've been planning this for years. We've all been preparing for years.\"\n\nHe smiled again. This time, it was more bitter. \"That's the problem. You see, I'm not in my prime anymore. I'm not as strong. I need someone young, strong, and capable enough to do my work for me. You're that man.\"\n\nIt was too much to take in. \"I... You can't be serious. I'm your general, your second-in-command. What makes you think I'll be your Dark Lord?\"\n\nHis expression turned serious. His eyes lost their glint. \"You've always been loyal to me, despite your misgivings. You've fought for me when your heart wasn't in it. If anyone can be my Dark Lord, it's you.\"\n\n\"I... I don't know, Lord Xarxos. I don't think I can fill your shoes.\"\n\nHe sighed. \"I'm not asking you to fill my shoes, General. I'm asking you to be me.\"\n\nI stared at him, unsure of what to do. \"How?\" I asked. \"How can I be you?\"\n\nHe smiled again, his bitter one.\n\n\"First, drop the title. Call yourself the Dark Lord. Second, you've always known where I wanted to expand my empire. You've always known where to fight and where to retreat. You'll use that knowledge to expand our empire.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"I... I need to think about this.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"I understand. Take all the time you need. I'll be here when you're ready to accept the mantle.\"\n\nI turned and walked away, leaving him alone. I couldn't believe what he said. I couldn't believe what I was considering.\n\nBut it was my duty to my kingdom to follow orders, even if the man giving them was a madman. I had to consider what he said. I had to consider what he offered.\n\nSo I left the room, wondering what the future might hold. The hero had fallen, and now our world was at my mercy. I would have to be more careful, to be more strategic, but I could do it.\n\nIf I wanted to."

The only question is: What is \"The Sun\"?\tLength: 1120 words<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
        "pred_story": "**I**\n\n\"Man, I'm glad we're on the other side of the continent. This is one hell of a party.\" I said, sipping on a beer as I looked out over the crowded, yet still spacious, rooftop where our party was being held. The view was incredible, a sea of lights stretching out as far as the eye could see.\n\nMy friend rolled his eyes, taking a drink from his own beer. \"You're not getting off that easy. What do you think happened to the sun?\"\n\n\"I told you, it's in a black hole. Probably was sent there by aliens to punish humanity for burning fossil fuels.\" I said, trying to deflect the question.\n\nMy friend scoffed. \"Come on, you're not really buying into that whole 'it's in a black hole' thing, are you? I'm sure you've been reading the rumors.\"\n\n\"I told you, I'm not reading any rumors, I'm reading the truth. There are a lot of crazy things going on in the world that don't make sense, but a black hole is a scientific possibility.\"\n\n\"You're just saying that to make me feel better, but I think we both know the truth. The government knows the truth, but they're not telling us. There are people who know the truth, and they're not telling us either.\"\n\nI sighed, letting the beer slide down my throat as I looked over the crowd of people dancing, singing, and laughing. There were a lot of weird things going on, but I hadn't seen any reason to believe that the world had ended or anything like that.\n\n\"You're paranoid, my friend. There's no way the government wouldn't know if the sun had suddenly vanished.\"\n\n\"Yet we don't see it. Why's that? There are cameras everywhere, both satellite and on the ground, yet there's not even a hint of what happened to the sun.\"\n\nI frowned. It was a good point, but I didn't see what it had to do with anything. It didn't matter what the government knew or didn't know.\n\n\"Maybe it has something to do with the government's new satellite system,\" I offered, but my friend shook his head.\n\n\"I don't think so. The satellites are still there. The only reason we can't see the sun is because it's not there. And I'm positive that if something catastrophic had happened, we'd still see the sun, even if it was no longer orbiting. There's only one explanation.\"\n\nI sighed. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"The sun is no longer in the sky because it is no longer there.\"\n\n**II**\n\nI sighed, staring at the graffiti on my wall as my friend left. That was the third time he had shown up in the last week, each time he had come to tell me about the message. At first I had thought that he was just messing with me, but he had been very serious when he told me that the message was on the walls of every house in the country, even on the other side of the continent.\n\nI walked over to the window, pulling back the curtain as I looked out into the night. It was dark. I glanced up at the sky, but there were no stars. I wasn't sure how long it had been since the sun had vanished, or what exactly that meant.\n\nThe air felt warm, but when I touched the glass I realized that it was cool to the touch. I stared up into the sky, wondering where the sun was, wondering why it had vanished, but mostly wondering why it had been so quiet. There were so many questions that I couldn't answer, and I found myself feeling a little scared.\n\nI looked back at my wall, seeing the graffiti in a new light. It had been there for months now, and no one seemed to know what it meant. I was starting to feel like I was the only one who didn't know, but now I was starting to wonder if that was true.\n\nI closed the curtain, leaving my room as I made my way out into the night. I felt a little scared, but I couldn't just sit around. I needed to know what happened to the sun, and why.\n\nI walked through the empty streets, the silence deafening. I wondered how long it would be before the world came back to life, but I wondered if it would ever come back to life. I saw a couple other people walking, and wondered if they knew what was going on. I wondered if they had seen the message, or if they knew that the sun had vanished.\n\nI sighed, glancing over at a house with a glowing window. That had to be someone's home. I walked over to the house, pressing the button by the door. Footsteps echoed from the other side of the door, followed by a click. I pushed the door open, looking inside.\n\nIt was dark, the only light coming from the glow of an emergency flashlight. I blinked at the light as I looked around, seeing a woman standing in the middle of the room, holding the flashlight. She was dressed in a simple white robe, her eyes wide with fear.\n\n\"Who are you?\" She asked, pointing the light into my eyes.\n\nI winced, moving away from the light. \"I'm just a person,\" I said, looking at her. \"I was walking through the street and saw your light. I just wanted to talk to someone.\"\n\nShe nodded, moving forward as she put the flashlight down on a table. \"I'm glad you're here,\" she said, glancing around her room before focusing back on me. \"I've been here for days, waiting for someone to show up. It's been too long since I've spoken to another person.\"\n\nI nodded, walking over to the table. \"What's your name?\"\n\n\"My name is Sarah,\" she said, smiling slightly as she held out her hand.\n\nI took her hand, shaking it as I glanced down at the table. There was a note on the table, the same message that I had seen on my wall.\n\n**III**\n\n\"You're the only one who hasn't seen the message,\" Sarah said, her eyes still wide with fear.\n\nI looked up at her, seeing a strange look in her eyes. \"Do you know what it means?\" I asked.\n\nShe shook her head, letting out a breath. \"I thought I did,\" she said, glancing down at the table again. \"But now I'm not so sure.\"\n\nI looked at the note, wondering what could have caused this. It couldn't be a prank, not with how widespread the message was. I looked at Sarah, seeing the fear still in her eyes, and realized that she knew something.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\n\nShe sighed, sitting down on a chair. \"I mean, when I read the message, I thought it was an accident. A mistake. I thought the government knew, and they just didn't tell us.\"\n\nI nodded, sitting down across from her.\n\n\"But now I'm not so sure,\" she said, shaking her head. \"The sun was here for years, decades, centuries. It was the center of our world, our lives, and suddenly it's gone. Where did it go?\"\n\nI shrugged, staring at the message on the table. \"There's no way to know.\"\n\n"

        "pred_story": "I've been in this coma for too long. Too long. No one comes to see me. Too long. I've lost my will to live. Too long.\n\nAnd then, in a flash of light, I see them. I see death and I see life. They're arguing. I hear them.\n\n\"Life!\" I call out.\n\n\"I am here.\" Life says.\n\n\"Look at him! Look at what you've done to him. His body is weak, his mind is dull, his will is broken. You have drained him. His energy is spent. He is no more.\"\n\nLife scoffs. \"That is not true. He is simply in a state of dormancy. He is waiting for me, waiting for his next journey. It is his time, and he is eager.\"\n\n\"He has been in this state for far too long. I should let him go.\"\n\nI think for a moment. \"No. You two seem like you could use each other.

He's been busy for years now, running around making sure people die. I'm pretty sure he's not doing very well.\"\n\nDeath smirks. \"Oh? Well, Life has been doing an awful lot of living, if you know what I mean. He's been getting a lot of attention lately. I'm not sure he even remembers me.\"\n\n\"Oh, I think he does. I'm pretty sure he remembers you as the grim reaper, with all those little skeletons and bats around you. He's still pretty afraid of you.\"\n\nDeath scoffs. \"Afraid of me? Oh, Life is just scared of me. It's a good thing, he's scared of me. He doesn't know what to do.\"\n\n\"Oh, but Death, you're wrong. Life is not afraid of you. He's just not interested in you. He's found someone else. Someone who's much more interesting than you.\"\n\nDeath narrows his eyes. \"Who?\"\n\n\"Oh, someone named Nemo. He's a very interesting person, but I'm not sure he'd be interested in you. Not after he saw all the skeletons and bats around you, that is.\"\n\nDeath sighs. \"Oh well, I'm sure I'll find someone else soon enough. But right now, Life, I think it's your turn.\"\n\nLife laughs. \"Oh, I think it is. I'm not quite ready to go yet. Not while I'm having such fun here.\"\n\n\"Fun?\" Death laughs. \"Life, you're in a coma. This is not fun. Not even a little bit.\"\n\n\"Oh, I disagree. I'm having the best time here. I'm talking to Life. He's a funny fellow.\"\n\nI laugh. \"Oh, Death, you should see yourself. You're so uptight, so serious. I'm pretty sure you'd kill someone with your seriousness.\"\n\nDeath rolls his eyes. \"Kill someone? No, I don't kill people. I only take them when it's their time to die.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure you don't. You may not be carrying a scythe, but I'm sure it's hidden somewhere on your person.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is. But I'm sure it won't be needed anytime soon. Not while I'm dealing with Life here.\"\n\nI sit up, slowly, painfully, and hold out my arms. \"Come on, both of you. Why not just hold hands and be together? It'll be fun, I promise you that.\"\n\nLife smiles, and Death looks at him with a sad expression. \"I've never really thought about it before. I've always thought of you as just a source of energy. But I have to admit, I'm intrigued.\"\n\nDeath sighs. \"I'm sure you'll be sorry once I'm gone. But I have to do my job, don't I?\"\n\n\"Of course you do. But I'll be here for you whenever you need me. And besides, I'm sure Nemo will be waiting for you when the time comes. He loves you, you know.\"\n\nDeath blushes. \"Oh? Oh, he does?\"\n\n\"Yes, he does. So come on, Death. Let's get started. You never know when the time will come. And besides, I'm sure I'll be here to help you whenever I can.\"\n\nDeath smiles, and reaches out to Life. \"Alright. I'll do it. I'll stay.\"\n\nLife's smile grows. \"That would be wonderful. Thank you, Death.\"\n\nI sit back, sigh, and look at the two of them. \"You two are lucky. Most people would want to be with me, but you two are better off without me. I'm lucky to have you two.\"\n\nDeath looks at me with a sympathetic expression. \"Oh, don't say that. We need each other. And we'll need you, too, eventually.\"\n\nI smile. \"I know. But for now, I'll just enjoy watching you two together. I'm sure it'll be fun.\"\n\nLife takes Death's hand in his, and they smile at each other. \"It will be fun,\" they say.\n\nDeath looks down at Life, and sighs. \"Yes, it will be fun. But Death never forgets, Life.\"\n\nLife smiles up at Death. \"I never forget, either.\"\n\nThe two of them are still holding hands, smiling at each other. I sigh, and fall back onto my pillow.\n\n\"Thank you for this, me. I'm going to miss you a lot, though.\"\n\nI smile. \"I'll always be with you. Goodbye, Death. Goodbye, Life.\"\n\nAnd I pass away."

There have been 12 since your predecessors and only 2 of them have succeeded.\u201d The figure stepped aside and as the light from a dark flame lit the dark chamber, I saw that it was a mirror. \u201cThe mirror has been here since before I was born. I don\u2019t know where it came from, but the others had to go through it to get in.\u201d I was so fixated on the mirror, I hadn\u2019t noticed the figure move to my side, but as I turned to look at it, a dark smudge on the mirror\u2019s surface became clear and I realized I was looking at my reflection. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you got out, though. You should be dead by now. That\u2019s how most people get in. The mirror looks into your heart, and if you\u2019re found wanting, you\u2019re dead.

If you\u2019re right about me, you\u2019ll know the truth, but don\u2019t get too excited.

That\u2019s where we come in.\u201d The figure stopped at a door with a sign that read \u201c1st floor\u201d and opened it. \u201cThe first of the seven tasks will be found down here.\u201d With that, they disappeared into the room.\n\nThe room had several corridors leading out of it and a stair case at the far end. I looked through each corridor and saw that they all ended in a sign with the number of the floor. I could hear a voice coming from the stairs, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to move around, stay off the stairs. They\u2019re very fragile. I don\u2019t want to have to replace them.\u201d The voice was coming from the floor above. I decided to start at the bottom of the stairs and move up to see what I would find, hoping to catch a glimpse of the figure.\n\nI was halfway up the stairs when a noise caught my attention. I stopped and listened, and soon after that, I heard a sigh of relief from below. I looked back and saw a puff of dark smoke in the shape of a person and it\u2019s head tilt back onto it\u2019s shoulders as the smoke drifted back into the room below. I heard a faint sound of sobbing and then the sounds of the dark figure moving around, putting things away and closing the door they had left by. I had to shake off the feeling of shock and grief that had come over me, I was now alone in this hell.\n\nI took a few deep breaths and continued up the stairs. I came out onto a floor with no windows, just an empty hall. The next floor was the same, then the next. On the fourth floor, I found a note. It was a long story, but I\u2019m not interested in reliving the memories I made there. I found a room on the fifth floor with no door, just a large stone pedestal in the center of it. On top of the pedestal was a small glass vial filled with a yellow liquid. At the bottom of the vial was a single grain of sand. I heard a voice, \u201cYou have one minute and 45 seconds, pick it up.\u201d I looked around and saw there was no one there, but as I turned to leave, I saw that I had already moved into the room and the door was behind me.\n\nI looked at the vial and was frozen. I knew that if I picked it up, time would slow down. I wasn\u2019t ready for that. I looked around the room again, but it was just empty. The voice came again, \u201cYou have 1 minute and 44 seconds.\u201d I looked at the vial again and knew what I had to do. I couldn\u2019t take it to the sixth floor if I was still there. I picked it up, and time slowed down. I was holding a grain of sand between my thumb and index finger. I let the vial go and it shattered on the floor, the grain of sand landing beside me. I was standing in a pit, surrounded by a high wall on all sides.\n\nI looked around and saw that I was back in the first floor room. The glass vial was now in my pocket, but it was empty. I looked at my feet and saw a small pile of sand had fallen from my pocket. The dark figure appeared from behind the mirror, \u201cYou\u2019ll need to find the next task on your own. Good luck.\u201d I thought they had left, but then I heard a voice behind me, \u201cDon\u2019t bother saying goodbye.\u201d I spun around, but there was no one there. The mirror was reflecting my image, but there was a faint smudge under it that showed someone had moved past it. I looked down and saw that the sand had vanished. I looked at my pocket and saw that the vial was back. I knew I had to find a new task, and I knew I had to do it quickly. I had already used up the time I had before the others, but they were still trying to find the first task.\n\nI heard the voice again, \u201cYou have 1 minute and 40 seconds.\u201d I looked around and saw a door that I hadn\u2019t noticed before. I looked at the figure, but it wasn\u2019t there. I went through the door and found myself back in the first floor room. I saw that it was now a large library, with rows of shelves that stretched up to the ceiling. I walked through the rows and saw that each shelf was covered in books. I couldn\u2019t know what I was looking for, but I knew that I had to find it. I had to find it before I ran out of time. I heard the voice again, \u201cYou have 1 minute and 39 seconds.\u201d\n\nI stopped and looked around. I saw that the books on the shelves were arranged alphabetically, and there was a bookshelf in the center of the room with no books on it. I walked over and saw that it was a mirror. I stepped back and looked at my reflection, I knew what I was looking for. I had to read all of the books in the library. I knew it was impossible, but I had to do it anyway. I took one of the books from the shelf next to the mirror and read it. I read it quickly, trying to find any important details. When I finished, I moved to the next shelf and read another book. I kept reading until the library was empty.\n\nI took a deep breath and then heard the voice again, \u201cYou have 1 minute and 38 seconds.\u201d I looked"

        "pred_story": "I know that the story of how I became a maid is one for the books, but I swear I didn\u2019t do anything so special. I was born into a family that were low-born enough that we didn\u2019t have the luxury of training any of our daughters in things like music or needlework, so I learned how to clean and cook from a very young age. And I didn\u2019t mind it! I was good at it, and it suited me fine to go from place to place, earning my keep by doing the simple tasks that nobody else wanted to do.\n\nSo when I landed on a position as the maid for the noblewoman Lady Margaret, it wasn\u2019t any grander than any of my other positions. In fact, it was probably one of the easier ones - Lady Margaret was a quiet girl who didn\u2019t require a lot of attention, so my job was mostly to take care of her clothes and keep her chambers tidy. And I enjoyed the quiet of it, the peace and the quiet that came with knowing what I had to do and being able to just focus on doing it.\n\nBut Lady Margaret was different from the other nobles I had worked with. For one, she was smart. I know that a lot of people say that nobles aren\u2019t very intelligent, but Lady Margaret was one of the smartest people I\u2019d ever met. She read a lot, and she was always eager to talk about what she had read, which was really interesting for a person like me. And she was nice too - she was never cruel, and she was always willing to help out if I needed it.\n\nBut she was also a little strange. Sometimes, she would go off and disappear into her own thoughts for hours at a time, and when I would ask her what was wrong, she would just tell me that everything was fine. And sometimes, she would say things that didn\u2019t make any sense - like that she was \u201con a quest\u201d or that her \u201cadventures\u201d would be coming up soon. I never thought too much of it, though. Lady Margaret was a private person, and I understood that I wasn\u2019t supposed to pry.\n\nSo when she came to me one day with the confession that she was a villain, I was totally taken aback. I had never heard of anyone like that before - I thought that all the nobles were either heroes or completely neutral, with no particular interest in helping anyone else out. But Lady Margaret said that wasn\u2019t true - that everyone was just living out their own character arc, and that some of them might have \u201cstats\u201d that would make them useful to others. And she said that she was one of the villainous characters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be killed, okay?\u201d she said. She was trembling, and I could see the tears in her eyes. \u201cI know they\u2019re going to do something bad to me, but I can\u2019t let them. I just can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked, though I think I already knew. \u201cYou\u2019re a noble lady, Margaret. You don\u2019t get to choose what happens to you.\u201d\n\nBut she just shook her head, looking away from me. \u201cI\u2019m telling you,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a villain. And they\u2019re going to make sure I get caught.\u201d\n\nI felt my heart sink as I realized what she was saying. She wasn\u2019t just a noble lady - she was a character in some sort of story, and she needed my help to avoid her fate. And I was scared, because I didn\u2019t know if I could help her."

        "pred_story": "The moonlight lit up her whole face. She looked just like her in the morning, only with more defined features that I could never quite get. I remember the first time I saw her, she walked up to me at a bar. I was in the bar with a few other travelers, drinking and swapping stories.\n\nShe was like one of them at first. But she stood out.\n\nHer ears were pointed, not big and fluffy like the ones in the stories. I was confused when I saw them, my mind struggled to reconcile what I saw.\n\nShe looked at me and smiled. I could tell she was trying to hide her accent.\n\n\u201cAre you alone?\u201d She asked, her eyes moving to the side.\n\nI was surprised. I looked at her again, this time really looking at her. The bar was dimly lit, but she was standing in the spotlight of the full moon. I could see every detail. I nodded, confused.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help but notice you\u2019re with a group of people. They seem like your kind. But they don\u2019t act like it. You do. You act like them. But you\u2019re not one of them. At least, I don\u2019t think you are.\u201d\n\nI was confused. This elf was right in front of me, but she was talking to me like she thought I was someone else. Like she thought I was a different person. I looked around the group. They were mostly humans, but there were a few dwarves and halflings.\n\nThe one she looked at was a human. A man. I watched as he tried to catch my eye. The rest just kept talking. I looked back at the elf. Her eyes met mine, she looked like she knew what I was thinking.\n\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s a man. My friend. He\u2019s nice. He\u2019s really into this sort of thing. This whole adventure thing. I\u2019ll show you. It\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\nShe was talking about the bar. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun. Come with me. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to do. She was a stranger, but she seemed nice. I was starting to feel really confused. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nWe left the group and walked to the bar. The elf walked with a bounce. She was fast. The bar had a door on the other side, which led into a room with tables. I followed her.\n\nInside, the music was louder, the bar was more crowded. There was a stage. It was empty, but I could tell someone was going to be up there soon. The elf grabbed my hand and pulled me towards the stage.\n\nThere was a small group of elves there. The music started, and they began to dance. The elf let go of my hand and moved closer to the stage. I followed her. She danced a few times, then she stopped and looked at me.\n\n\u201cDance. It\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\nI looked around. There were a few other humans dancing. Most of the patrons seemed to be elves. I looked back at the stage. The elves were singing. It was a nice song, but the lyrics were confusing. The elf saw my confusion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a language you\u2019d know. The lyrics are in the elf language. It\u2019s like a poem. It doesn\u2019t really make sense in your language.\u201d\n\nI looked back at the stage. The elves stopped singing, then they began to sing again. But they were singing a different song this time. I looked at the elf.\n\n\u201cDo you like it?\u201d\n\nShe was smiling. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a great song. One of my favorites.\u201d\n\nIt was my favorite song now. The elves were singing about something that I didn\u2019t understand. But the music and the dance made me happy. The elves were having fun. They were singing and dancing together. It was beautiful.\n\nThe song was over, and the elves started to clean up. I looked back at the elf. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\nShe smiled at me. \u201cI\u2019m Elthar. I\u2019ll be leaving in a few days. I\u2019m going to find my own place. I don\u2019t want to live with my parents anymore.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cOkay. It was nice meeting you, Elthar.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was nice meeting you too.\u201d She smiled at me again, then she walked away.\n\nI looked around the room. It was quiet now, most of the elves were gone. I looked at the door. The moon was still shining. I left the room and walked outside.\n\nElthar was standing there, leaning against a wall. \u201cHey. What are you doing? It\u2019s late.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nShe looked at me. \u201cNo need to apologize. It\u2019s not late, though. You can stay with me if you want. You can stay with me for a while.\u201d\n\nI looked at her. \u201cI\u2019d like to. Thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me. You can stay with me until you want to leave. Do you want to leave?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t want to leave. I didn\u2019t want to leave her. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Good. I\u2019m glad you like it here.\u201d\n\nI smiled at her. \u201cYeah. I like it here. What is it?\u201d She looked confused. I nodded to her house. \u201cI think that\u2019s a house.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. Yeah. It\u2019s my house. I\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like it.\u201d I looked at her. \u201cI don\u2019t have money.\u201d\n\nShe smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have money. Just stay with me.\u201d\n\nI looked at her again. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\n\nShe looked at me. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t want to mess this up.\u201d\n\nShe sighed. \u201cWhat do you want? Do you want to be with me?\u201d\n\nI looked at her. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Then I\u2019m happy. I don\u2019t want to mess this up either.\u201d\n\nShe smiled at me, and I smiled back.\n\nI had been with her for 5 years. She was still beautiful. I looked at her, and I smiled. She looked at me and smiled back.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cHey. What do you want?\u201d\n\nI looked at her. I wanted everything. \u201cI want everything.\u201d\n\nShe smiled again. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll get you everything. Everything?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nShe looked at me. \u201cWe can have everything. I don\u2019t care about the things. I just want you. I want to be with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to be with me too. I love you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you too.\u201d\n\nI smiled at her, and she smiled back.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s go for a walk.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nWe walked for a while. We didn\u2019t say much, but it was nice to have some time with her.\n\nEventually we walked to her house, and we sat down on the couch. I looked at her. \u201cHey, can I ask you something?\u201d\n\nShe looked at me. \u201cWhat do you want to ask?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow old are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, yeah. I\u2019m 499.

Where am I?\u201d\n\n\u201cEarth, 2423. Earth, 2423.\u201d\n\n\u201c2423? What are you talking about? That\u2019s, that\u2019s, I\u2019m from 1723.\u201d\n\n\u201c1723? Ha! That\u2019s cute. You can\u2019t even begin to comprehend what this world has become. You can\u2019t even begin to comprehend what you\u2019re witnessing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI...I...I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you do. I think you do. Do you remember your old job? The one you had, before you were sent here?\u201d\n\n\u201cSent here? Where am I? How did I get here?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, you want to play dumb. Fine. I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret. You\u2019ve been brought here because you\u2019re, what\u2019s the phrase I want to use, the \u2018catalyst\u2019? Yes, that\u2019s it. Your \u2018catalyst\u2019. You are the catalyst for the next great technological breakthrough. And, as you are now aware, you are the catalyst for a technological breakthrough that will lead to the downfall of humanity.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazy. What are you talking about? What technological breakthrough?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try to get up and leave, and you\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI refuse to leave, you have to let me go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t. You can\u2019t go home. You can\u2019t go home because the Earth, the Earth you know, does not exist anymore. The Earth is now a dystopian wasteland, a desolate, barren wasteland ruled by a tyrannical government that, as I mentioned, has been aware of you since your arrival.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what, exactly, does that have to do with me? I\u2019m just a simple man. I don\u2019t know what I could possibly do for a government.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, but you do. I\u2019m sure you do. You just don\u2019t realize it. Just like all of humanity, just like all of those that came before you, you never realized what you were doing until it was too late. And that\u2019s the problem. That\u2019s the problem. Humanity has never realized what it has been doing until it has been too late. Until it has been too late, until the damage has been done, until humanity was able to no longer reverse the damage, and until humanity was able to realize what it has done.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, man, I don\u2019t know what kind of crazy nonsense you\u2019re spouting, but I\u2019m not buying it. I don\u2019t want to die here. I don\u2019t want to be a part of some crazy technological breakthrough that\u2019s going to destroy the Earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. I don\u2019t. None of us do. But it\u2019s too late. We\u2019re too late. The damage has been done. It can\u2019t be reversed. We\u2019re past the point of no return.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? What damage?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try to leave?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should I?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the security system is watching. And when it sees you try to leave, it will respond to that. When it responds to that, I\u2019ll have to do what I do. I\u2019ll have to do what I always do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said \u2018the damage can\u2019t be reversed\u2019. What damage?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try to leave?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you hiding?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try to leave?\u201d\n\n\u201cStop saying that!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try to leave?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a madman.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try to leave?\u201d\n\n\u201cSTOP IT. STOP IT. STOP IT.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said it, didn\u2019t I? I said it. I said the damage can\u2019t be reversed. And I said it because it can\u2019t be.

        "pred_story": "I was sitting in the courtroom, clutching the ticket in my hand as the prosecutor, Mr. Deeks, was recounting the events of that fateful night. I had no memory of that night. All I knew was the details of the crime, a string of facts that I had read and memorized to aid in my defense. I had been to the stadium that night, I was certain of it, but I couldn't explain how I had gotten there or why I wasn't aware of the events that took place. \n\nMr. Deeks was getting agitated, he could see the jury was starting to believe that I wasn't involved in the crime, and I could see the satisfaction on Mr. Deeks' face. I couldn't believe how he could be so smug and arrogant, as if he was getting paid to make me look like an idiot. \n\nJust as the prosecutor was about to continue with his argument, Mr. Davenport rose to his feet, his eyes fixed intently on the prosecutor. \"Your Honor, I think we should take a recess so that I may speak with my client and review some evidence.\"\n\nI couldn't believe that Mr. Davenport was doing this, it seemed like he was playing into the prosecutors hands. The judge nodded in response, \"Very well, the court will be in recess until tomorrow morning. Mr. Davenport, you and your client have until then to review any evidence. You may call any witnesses that you deem necessary for the case to proceed.\" \n\nThe judge banged his gavel and the courtroom erupted in a flurry of activity. I was sitting there in silence, trying to process what had just happened. Mr. Davenport came over and sat next to me, \"Mr. Deeks has shown a video of you at a basketball game,\" he said, his voice low and serious. \"You may be the only person on the planet who can corroborate your alibi.\"\n\nHe held out the video in his hand, the image of the basketball game staring back at me. I couldn't explain what I was seeing, but I knew it was my hand on the ticket. I knew it was my body sitting in the row behind me, a look of awe on my face as I watched the game. \n\n\"I don't know how it works,\" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. \"How can I be in two places at once?\"\n\nMr. Davenport sighed, \"I don't know, Mr. Brown, but we will find out. Now, let us review the video and see if there is anything you can remember.\" \n\nHe put the video in a machine and pressed play. The video played, the sound of the crowd and the squeak of the basketball on the court filled the air. I watched as I moved in the row, the camera panning across the crowd. I saw myself stand up, turn my attention to the court, and smile as my team scored a point. I sat down, and the video continued. \n\nI saw the game end, the clock running out as the crowd cheered in excitement. The camera showed the final moments of the game, and the video ended. I was staring at the video in shock, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. \n\n\"I didn't do it,\" I said, my voice filled with emotion. \"I don't know how, but I'm innocent. I didn't kill anyone.\" \n\nI could see the look of confusion in Mr. Davenport's eyes, \"How did you know the victim?\" he asked. \"Where were you that night?\" \n\nI shook my head, \"I don't know. I have no memory of that night. All I remember is the details of the crime. I read them in a newspaper, and memorized them. I'm innocent, I'm certain of it.\" \n\nI stood up, \"I want a polygraph test. I want to prove my innocence, to prove that I didn't do it.\" \n\nMr. Davenport nodded, \"Very well. I will see to it. You may leave now, Mr. Brown. You may return tomorrow morning, and we will begin again.\" \n\nI walked out of the courtroom, a sense of relief and hope that I hadn't felt in months. I would be acquitted, I was certain of it. I would be a free man, and I could finally live my life without looking over my shoulder, wondering if the cops were going to knock on my door again."

The same face he had for the past four decades. He had long lost his youthful appearance. But at least the lines on his face were moving yesterday. They were deepening, as if reality had been chiseled into his face. They were alive. But today, not a single line had shifted. Yesterday was not real.\n\nThe man looked down at his hands. They had aged. The nails had been trimmed. And on his right hand, he wore a wedding ring. He did not remember the last time he wore a wedding ring. The ring was the same as the day before, with the same scratches. The same scratches he got while fixing the kitchen sink. A kitchen sink he did not remember fixing. But at least his hands had aged. Yesterday was real.\n\nHe picked up his phone, only to see that it was the same as yesterday. It had all the same apps he had yesterday. But then he saw it. The photo on his screen. The same photo he saw yesterday. It was a family photo. A photo he had never seen before. Yet it felt familiar. His wife was dead. But she was alive in the photo. And so were their three children. They were all smiling. He did not remember them smiling like that. But at least the photo was new. Yesterday was real.\n\nHe got up from his chair and walked to the window. The view was the same as yesterday. The same apartment building across the street. The same park on the other side. He could not see the park today. He could see the building across the street. The building that did not exist yesterday. Yesterday was real.\n\nBut the view of the park had been the same. The same trees. The same benches. The same lake that looked more like a puddle of water. He had sat on that bench yesterday. He remembered the cold breeze on his skin. He remembered the feeling of the wood on his backside. He remembered the crows. They were all gone today.\n\nHe could hear a knock on the door. It was the same knock as yesterday. It was a gentle knock. He walked to the door and opened it. It was the same woman as yesterday. She was the same woman he had seen every day for the last year. She had been talking to him every day. But today she was different. Today she was just as he had imagined her to be yesterday.\n\n\"I am convinced that yesterday was not real. It couldn\u2019t have been real.\"\n\nThe woman was staring at him. \"It's real, sir. It's all real. But it's also not real. I am afraid this is all just a simulation.\"\n\nThe old man did not say a word. He did not know what to say.

And yet, I found myself at the front of the city, a man walking amongst men, with the weight of history on my shoulders. \n\n\u201cFather,\u201d the young one called out, his voice shaking, and I wondered if he would have been braver to call me a traitor.\n\n\u201cNathaniel,\u201d I replied, the name feeling strange on my lips, and I fought against the wave of memories that threatened to drag me back.\n\n\u201cFather,\u201d he repeated, as if to make the truth known, and I could see the fear in the eyes of the others. Fear of what they would see, of what they would think, of what I might do.\n\nI stepped forward, my footsteps deliberate, and I allowed the memories to flood me, to wash over me, to take me under. I allowed them to take the armor of my current self, to strip away the cloak of my future, and to reveal me in my true form. \n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d I said, as I fell to my knees, \u201cI am not a hero. I am a man, an aging man, a man who has been changed by time. I am a man who has loved, who has lost, who has fought and won and lost. I am a man who knows what it means to die. And I tell you this, my people, because I must.\u201d\n\nI looked up, and my eyes met the eyes of the young one, and he looked at me with a face so much like his mother\u2019s, so much like the mother I had lost. \n\nI reached out a hand, and he took it, and I pulled him down beside me, and we sat in silence for a long moment. \n\n\u201cYou have asked for my story,\u201d I said, my voice barely above a whisper, \u201cand I have given you a story of a man who saved his people. But that is not the whole of my story. My story is of a man who was a hero, a man who was made a hero, a man who was forced to choose between his people and his heart. My story is of a man who chose to betray his people, to betray the trust they had placed in him, to betray the queen who had called him to greatness. And my story is of a man who found peace in that betrayal.\u201d\n\nI pulled the cloak around me again, and I stood, and I turned, and I walked away, and I did not look back.\n\n\u201cFather,\u201d he called out, the young one, and I stopped.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\nHe stepped forward, and he looked at me with his eyes so much like his mother\u2019s, and I saw the weight of my choice, the weight of his choice. And I knew that he would choose the same way, that he would follow me into the darkness, into the peace that I had found. \n\n\u201cI am glad,\u201d I said, \u201cthat you understand.\u201d\n\nI smiled, and I stepped forward, and I took him by the shoulder, and I pushed him gently, and I said, \u201cGo home, Nathaniel. Go back to your mother. Tell her the truth, and tell her I said to stop mourning me.\u201d\n\nAnd then I turned, and I walked away, and I did not look back, and I found my peace."

        "pred_story": "\"Did you really think you have the advantage with a sword, did you assume that smart dragons wouldn't make something infinitely better than a sword?\"\n\nasked the dragon as he racked his shotgun.\n\n\"We have come to bring you to the queen,\" said the knight in a gruff voice.  \"It is an honor to be in your presence, I am afraid I am unable to stay for long.\"\n\n\"Ah, you think this little sword of yours will get you to her, do you?  I have been around for centuries, it is but a child to me.\"\n\n\"Sir, there is a reason your kind has a fear of fire and death,\" said the knight as he tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword.\n\nThe dragon laughed and puffed out a plume of fire.  It shot out like a jet from his mouth and scorched the ground the knight stood on.  The knight leaped to his left as the fire burned away part of the ground where he had been standing.\n\nThe knight then drew his bow and shot one of the arrows made of ice into the dragon's mouth, freezing part of it shut.  The dragon growled and then pulled a shotgun out from behind his back.\n\nThe knight shot a few more arrows and then turned to the dragon with his sword.  \"I am afraid that was your last arrow, I have to end this quickly or she will return to her lair.\"\n\n\"I've got a few more tricks up my sleeve, just watch!\" said the dragon.  He opened his jaws and shot the ice arrow back to the knight, then he threw the shotgun over at the knight.  The knight tried to catch the shotgun but it was tossed too quickly and it bounced off his shoulder.  The dragon then threw a baseball bat at the knight, but the knight dodged it with ease.\n\nThe knight then fired one last ice arrow and shot it into the dragon's mouth, freezing it shut.  The dragon then tried to shake the ice arrow out of his mouth, but it caused his head to spin around.  The knight took that opportunity to strike the dragon down with his sword.\n\nThe dragon then fell to the ground and the knight stood over him, then the knight heard a loud noise behind him and turned around.  There were many more dragons coming towards him.  The dragon that he killed earlier then got up from the ground and started laughing.\n\n\"You really should've killed me when you had the chance,\" he said.  He then looked at the knight and saw him holding the sword, then he looked at the shotgun on the ground.\n\n\"Huh, you think you can take all of us out with that little sword?  You are a fool if you do, I will show you what our true power is,\" said the dragon as he flew above the other dragons.\n\nThe knight then pulled out a grenade from his belt and threw it at the other dragons.  The grenade went off and killed most of them.  The knight then pulled out a fire extinguisher and sprayed the fire out of the others.  The knight then picked up the shotgun and pulled the trigger and hit every dragon that was left.\n\nThe knight then took a deep breath and ran towards the lair of the dragon.  He didn't see the dragon anymore, but he knew that it was still alive.  The knight then ran in and started searching around the lair.  When he searched it, he didn't find anything but a single egg.\n\nThe knight then picked up the egg and ran out.  He was then greeted by a woman who was in her 30's with a sword and a bow in her hands.\n\n\"Who are you?\" she asked.  \n\nThe knight then bowed and said, \"I am a knight, I have killed the dragon who was terrorizing your kingdom and took an egg from him.\"\n\nThe woman then smiled and said, \"You are brave, you should be rewarded, do you want to come in?\"\n\nThe knight then nodded and followed the woman inside, and then she brought him into her room.  It was then that she revealed to the knight who she was.\n\nShe was the dragon.\n\n\"I see you are able to tell that I am a dragon,\" said the woman.  \"Do you want to kill me or marry me?\"\n\nThe knight then smiled and said, \"I don't have any reason to kill you now that the dragon has been slain.  I have to ask, how are you able to be a woman?\"\n\nThe woman laughed and said, \"I am the queen, I am a woman who is a dragon.\"  She then looked at the knight and saw that he was holding the egg.  \"Oh, you took the egg from the dragon, well I guess it is only fair that you marry me then,\" she said.\n\nThe knight then smiled and said, \"I have to ask, why did you want me to marry you?\"\n\nThe woman then smiled and said, \"Because you killed the dragon that was terrorizing my kingdom, I don't want to marry some fool who was not able to defeat him.\"\n\nThe knight smiled and said, \"I guess we'll see then,\" and then the knight gave the egg to the woman.  The woman then laughed and said, \"Let's go to the kitchen and make us some pancakes.\"  The knight then smiled and followed her there."

        "pred_story": "\"I don't know if I can do this,\" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. \"I mean, I'm not even in high school yet.\" It was like he was asking me to jump off a cliff, but without a safety net. \"Why do you need me? Why can't you do it yourself?\"\n\n\"Because you're my only relative with the gift,\" he replied. \"You have to learn it, and the only way to do that is by hands on experience. You can't learn it from a book.\" He sighed, his eyes looking at me for what felt like the hundredth time that day.\n\n\"But I'm just twelve.\"\n\n\"Twelve! That's practically an adult!\" he said. \"You're the only one who can help me out, and I really need it. If I don't do this, who knows what will happen? You're my only chance to help the old man, and help the whole town, and I'm not about to give up on that.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I know it seems scary, but trust me, you'll love it.\" He said with a smile.\n\nI didn't know if I should believe him or not. He sounded happy, so maybe he was telling the truth. Or maybe he was just desperate.\n\n\"Okay,\" I said finally, deciding to give it a shot. \"But what is the gift? What does it have to do with the old man?\" I'd heard stories of him, but they said he was crazy. There was no way he was real.\n\n\"That's for you to find out,\" he said with a smile. \"Now, do you want to take a break from this boring old town for a while and visit the old man? Or are you waiting for the next bus?\"\n\nI sighed, then nodded. \"Let's do it.\" I said, before he could get a call from the old man again. After a long bus ride, I arrived in the town. The town was old, with buildings falling over themselves. There were cobblestone streets, and horses and carts went by every now and then. There were a few people walking around, but the town felt empty and empty. But then, we arrived at the old mans' house. The house was big and old, with dark walls and a big gate that looked like iron. The front door was open, and a butler greeted us.\n\n\"Ah, thank you for coming,\" he said, before disappearing into the house. \"Come this way.\"\n\nI couldn't believe it. I didn't know that butlers still existed in the real world. I followed the butler, and we arrived at the old man's study. He was standing over a map of the world, a finger tracing a circle around a continent.\n\n\"Ah, thank you so much for coming,\" he said, before turning around. He was old, with a long white beard and mustache, and eyes that were clouded by cataracts. He was hunched over, his back bent by old age. \"Thank you, thank you so much for coming.\" He repeated, as he moved closer to me. His eyes looked into mine, and I saw something there that I couldn't quite put my finger on. \"Thank you, thank you.\"\n\n\"You're welcome,\" I replied. \"What do I need to do?\"\n\n\"First, you need to ask my permission,\" the old man said, before turning his back on me. \"Then, you can start to learn the gift.\" He said, before walking out of the room.\n\n\"What's the gift?\" I asked the butler.\n\n\"You'll see soon enough,\" he said. \"Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going back to bed. You can start your learning tomorrow, but for now, I suggest you get some rest.\"\n\nThe butler left, leaving me alone in the study. I sighed, before walking out of the room and to my room. I lay in my bed, and fell asleep almost immediately. The next morning, I woke up and went to the butler's room, where he was already up and getting ready. \"Good morning,\" he said, before leaving me to find my way to the study. There was the old man, in his study, with the map from before.\n\n\"Ah, thank you for coming,\" he said, before turning to me. \"Thank you, thank you.\" He said, before I could stop him. \"Now, you must ask my permission. Then, you can start to learn the gift.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said, before he stopped me. He turned around, and looked into my eyes. I saw something there, and I could feel it too. It was a feeling I didn't know how to describe. \"What is this feeling?\" I asked.\n\nThe old man smiled, then turned away. \"It's the gift,\" he said. \"It's the connection between us.\" He turned back to me, then put a hand on my face. \"Now, I must ask you to help me.\"\n\n\"Help you?\" I asked, confused.\n\nThe old man nodded. \"Yes, help me. You must be the instrument to allow me to fulfill my dream.\"\n\nI didn't know what to do. I had never been asked to help someone before, and I didn't know if I should say yes or no. \"I don't know,\" I said.\n\nThe old man sighed, then looked at me again. \"What do you want?\" he asked.\n\nI didn't know how to answer that. I was just a twelve year old girl, living in a small town, and now I was being asked to fulfill some old man's dream? I knew I had to say no, but I couldn't. \"I want to help you,\" I said, before he nodded in approval. \"Okay, let's get started.\"\n\nHe smiled, then led me to his table. There were several objects there, each one with a strange glow around it. \"This is the first object,\" he said, before holding out a ring to me. I took it, and felt the glow. Suddenly, I could see the old man in my mind. I saw him as a young man, in love with a young woman, and I knew he was holding a ring. \"This is the object,\" he said. \"Do you want to touch it?\"\n\nI nodded, then put the ring in my pocket, before turning to the butler. \"That's it?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"But that's not the most important part.\"\n\n\"What's the most important part?\" I asked.\n\n\"It's the old man,\" he replied. \"He needs your help to make a wish.\"\n\n\"So what is the gift?\" I asked, feeling curious. \"What's this feeling I feel?\"\n\nThe butler smiled. \"Well, you have the gift,\" he said. \"You can see the past of any object.\"\n\n\"Wow,\" I said, amazed. \"That's amazing.\"\n\n\"But be careful,\" he added. \"Not all objects are nice.\"\n\nI nodded, before asking him another question. \"But what is the most important part?\"\n\n\"It's the old man,\" he replied. \"He needs your help to make a wish.\"\n\nI nodded, then felt a feeling of accomplishment.

        "pred_story": "I have been working with hoarders for years, I have to say that I have never seen anything like this. The house was a mess from top to bottom with trash and debris stacked up to the ceiling, but every inch of it was meticulously covered in fine china, vases, paintings and every sort of trinket you can imagine. It would take us at least a month to clear all this out. But it wasn't just the mess that bothered me, it was the stuff we found.\n\nOn my first day I was rummaging through the living room and I find a box of old clocks. But not just any clocks, these clocks are so old that I could swear that some of them were from the 19th century. But what really caught my eye was the one that was labeled with a big \"X\" over it. I opened it up and inside I found a note that read \"don't wind this one\".\n\nOn my second day I was digging through the attic, which was full of old boxes and trunks that were locked and sealed. I found one labeled \"DO NOT OPEN\" and another labeled \"DO NOT TOUCH\". It was almost as if the owner knew that we would be coming.\n\nAs we were clearing the attic I found a small box with a strange symbol on it. It was some sort of ancient language. I have to admit I didn't recognize it. But what really caught my eye was that it was locked with a small key. I had to dig a bit to find the key, but I finally found it in a small vase in the living room. When I opened the box I found a bunch of strange objects. Some looked like medical tools, some looked like instruments of torture, and some looked like ancient weapons.\n\nBut it was what was inside the box that really caught my eye. It was a small leather book, tied with a piece of string. I carefully opened the book and inside I found the history of the owner. It was a woman who had been born into a powerful family but had been married off to a cruel man who beat her. She had been locked up in her room for decades and had spent her time reading and writing in the book. She had also been experimenting with magic and had created the strange objects in the box. They were all used for good and were meant to protect her and help her fight against the cruel man who had taken over her family.\n\nBut what really caught my eye was the symbol on the box. It was some sort of magical symbol that would allow the reader to enter a special place. It was like a magical portal. I had to admit I was intrigued.\n\nAs we were clearing the rest of the house I found a small box with a strange symbol on it. It was the same symbol that was on the box in the attic. But I knew that this one was special because it had the same symbol that was on the clock that had a big X over it. I carefully opened the box and inside I found a small note that read \"press me\".\n\nWhen I pressed the note it opened up a small room that was hidden behind the wall. I couldn't believe it. It was a magical room that was filled with strange objects and strange smells. I had to admit that I was really intrigued.\n\nBut what really caught my eye was what was on the wall. It was a picture of me and my team. I couldn't believe it. How did they know that we would be coming? I had to admit I was really scared.\n\nI quickly left the room and ran back to the living room where the rest of my team was. I quickly called them over and told them about the room. But as they entered the room it disappeared.\n\nI knew that I had to tell my boss about this but I was scared. I didn't want to risk losing my job. So I told him that I made a mistake and that I had to go home.\n\nAs I left the house I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was waiting for me."

        "pred_story": "*Whack*\n\nThe pain was intense as I came to. My head spinning wildly, I looked around and saw nothing but the walls of a room made of wood and stone. A room I knew all too well. I was in the evil witch's tower, the place where the lost princess was kept. But how was I here? I couldn't recall falling to sleep, and how did I even get here? I didn't have answers to those questions as I slowly stood up. \n\nAs I did, I heard a faint cry out. It was a cry that I had heard many times before. The cry of the lost princess, crying out for her prince. The prince that I was. I had to find her, I thought. I would need to find a way down, but I could do that. My sword lay across the room, and I picked it up. The room was small, and I could easily check if the door was there. And it was, just as I thought. I had done this many times before. I left my room to search for the princess, who I would rescue.\n\nI was halfway to the door when a voice boomed. \"You should not have come back here, young prince.\" I had heard that voice before. It was the voice of the witch who had been keeping the princess. I turned around, drawing my sword. I was not afraid of her, despite her reputation. I had been to her tower many times before, and I had seen the evil that she was capable of. I did not fear her, but I was angry. She had taken my princess, my love. And I would not leave her here alone.\n\n\"I was looking for my princess.\" I said, trying to keep the anger out of my voice. It was a difficult task, but I managed to succeed. I wanted to yell at her for taking the princess, but I was trying to stay calm. I had done this before, and I would succeed again.\n\nI saw the look of surprise in the witch's eyes. She did not expect me to know about her tower. She was clearly shocked that I knew about the princess that she had taken. I could tell that she did not expect me to be here. She was not prepared, and I was glad of that. It would make my mission easier.\n\nThe witch sighed. \"Yes, I know. You are a brave prince. But you are not a clever one.\" She crossed her arms. \"I have made a deal with your kingdom. A deal that will benefit both of our nations.\"\n\nI did not care about a deal between our nations. I cared only about my princess. I cared only about saving her from the witch. \"That has nothing to do with my princess. You must let her go.\"\n\nThe witch sighed again, and shook her head. \"You are so blinded by your love for her, prince. But I am sorry. I do not have the power to let her go.\"\n\nI knew that she did have the power to let the princess go. She had been keeping the princess for months now, and she had been successful in keeping her. But I would succeed. I would let the princess go, and I would take her back home.\n\nI was not going to let the witch defeat me. Not after all that I had been through. I had been to her tower before, and I had been through her spells. I knew them, and I could defeat them. I just needed to be brave, and I would succeed.\n\nI held my sword high, and I prepared to cast the spell that I had been preparing for months. I knew that it was not going to be easy, but I had faith that I would succeed. I would let the princess go, and I would take her back home. But it wasn't happening. The spell wasn't happening. I was just standing there, holding my sword, waiting for the spell to happen, but it wasn't. And then I heard the voice of my princess.\n\n\"Prince,\" she said, looking at me with sad eyes.\n\nI looked at her, and I smiled. \"My dear princess.\" I said, rushing to her side. I knelt down, and I hugged her. \"I am going to let you go,\" I said, looking up at her. She smiled, and she nodded.\n\n\"I don't want to go,\" she said, holding onto me. She had been my princess for years, and she had been my love for months now. I had been separated from her for months, and I would do anything to keep her from the witch. But I knew that I had to let her go. I had to let her go so that she could live a happy life, free from the witch's spells and curses. And she would be happy, because she would be with her parents, her family. And I would be happy, because I would know that she was happy. \n\nShe would be safe, she would be loved, and she would be with her parents. And I would be happy. I would be happy, knowing that she was safe, and happy. I let her go, and I smiled at her.\n\n\"I will always love you,\" I said, looking into her eyes. She smiled, and she nodded.\n\n\"I love you too,\" she said, and she left the tower. And I stayed with the witch, who was very angry at me. But I didn't care. I had let my princess go, and that was all that mattered to me. And it did matter to her too. I saw her again a few months later, and she was happy. She was with her parents, her family, and she was loved. And that was all that mattered to me.\n\nI was happy that she was safe, and happy. And that was all that mattered to me. That is how the story goes, and I hope you enjoyed it."

As always, I was ready. My eyes watched the clock tick the final seconds of the hour away, and I waited, my hands poised over the cups of coffee that I had set aside, my feet tapping out the rhythm of my nerves.\n\nAnd then, he was there, in the doorway, his head bowed low, his eyes cast down at the ground. His long coat billowed around him, a dark cloud of unknown fabric, and his hat seemed too small for his head, and his boots were too big for his feet. He was as always, an enigma, a mystery, a man, but not quite a man, not fully formed, as if some vital part had been left out, or some vital part taken away.\n\nAnd yet, despite the mystery of him, despite the strangeness of him, I felt a familiarity, a comfort, a sense of welcome, as if he were a long-lost friend, or perhaps an old enemy, one whose arrival I had anticipated, and dreaded, for so long.\n\n\"Good evening,\" I said, as I always did, as if it were a question, a query, a tentative, uncertain greeting, though it was none of these things, though it was, in truth, a statement, a declaration, a simple, direct, unvarnished phrase.\n\nHe nodded, as he always did, a small, almost imperceptible movement of his head, a gesture that seemed too small to signify, but was, nonetheless, a gesture, a movement, a sign of life, of animation, of breath, and of blood, though there was something of none of these things in his stillness, in his quiet, in his calm.\n\nAnd then, as always, he took a seat, a chair at the counter, a stool, a place that seemed to be, not a place, but a state of being, a being, a man, but not quite a man, a shadow of a man, a man without a face, without a voice, without a soul, yet with a presence, a palpable, a felt, a known presence, that filled the room, that filled me, that filled the air, that filled the world, with an unsettling, a unsettling, a thrilling, a thrilling sense, of expectation, of anticipation, of dread, and of fear.\n\nAnd then, as always, he ordered, though he never ordered anything, never asked for anything, never asked for food, or drink, or service, but said, instead, as he always did, \"The usual,\" a single word, a simple word, a word that seemed too small to signify, yet meant, and meant, and meant, everything, everything, everything.\n\nI nodded, as always, a small, almost imperceptible movement of my head, a gesture that seemed too small to signify, though it signified, and signified, everything, everything, everything. And then, I poured him a cup, a cup of coffee, a cup of black, bitter, dark liquid, that seemed to have no taste, no smell, no presence, yet had, and had, a presence, a flavor, a smell, a taste, that filled the room, that filled him, that filled me, with a sense, a sense, a sense, of wonder, of awe, of fear, and of dread.\n\nAnd then, as always, we waited, the minutes ticked away, the hours passed, the night wore on, the darkness deepened, the shadows grew long, the wind blew, the rain fell, and the world outside changed, transformed, became something, something, something, new, yet still the same, still familiar, still known, still recognized, still remembered, as the darkness, and the shadows, and the wind, and the rain, and the world, all, all, all, seemed to conspire, to join, to merge, to flow, to converge, to become one, one, one, with the man, the mystery, the enigma, the stranger, the stranger, the stranger, in the chair, the chair, the chair, that seemed to be, not a chair, but a state of being, a being, a man, but not quite a man, a shadow of a man, a man without a face, without a voice, without a soul, yet with a presence, a palpable, a felt, a known presence, that filled the room, that filled me, that filled the air, that filled the world, with an unsettling, a thrilling, a thrilling, a sense, of expectation, of anticipation, of dread, and of fear.\n\nAnd then, as always, he was gone, vanished, disappeared, vanished into thin air, vanished, vanished, vanished, without a sound, without a word, without a sign, without a gesture, without a presence, yet left behind, and left behind, and left behind, the coffee, the cup, the chair, the chair, the chair, that seemed to be, not a chair, but a state of being, a being, a man, but not quite a man, a shadow of a man, a man without a face, without a voice, without a soul, yet with a presence, a palpable, a felt, a known presence, that filled the room, that filled me, that filled the air, that filled the world, with an unsettling, a thrilling, a thrilling, a sense, of expectation, of anticipation, of dread, and of fear.\n\nAnd then, I cleaned up, as always, the cup, the saucer, the chair, the chair, the chair, that seemed to be, not a chair, but a state of being, a being, a man, but not quite a man, a shadow of a man, a man without a face, without a voice, without a soul, yet with a presence, a palpable, a felt, a known presence, that filled the room, that filled me, that filled the air, that filled the world, with an unsettling, a thrilling, a thrilling, a sense, of expectation, of anticipation, of dread, and of fear."

We\u2019ll get through this.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, mom.\u201d The boy replied, but he looked unsure. \u201cBut what if there are monsters there?\u201d He asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThe old woman smiled, \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as monsters, honey. Just animals, and sometimes, wild animals can be scary. But we\u2019ll be okay. We\u2019ll go together. Alright? Now, let\u2019s move.\u201d She stood, holding the boy up. The boy looked at the lantern in his hand again, and then at his mother, and then nodded. Together, they began to run, but soon, she heard the boy crying, and then the lantern went out.\n\nIn the darkness, the old woman froze, and then looked around. \u201cHoney, I know you\u2019re scared, but we have to keep moving. It\u2019s dark, but we know where we are, and we know where we\u2019re going. You can stay close to me, okay?\u201d She spoke softly, but the boy didn\u2019t answer. She heard him crying again, and then the wind rustled. She took a deep breath, and began to walk, holding the boy up. But soon, she heard the boy\u2019s cries again. She stopped, and looked at him. The wind was blowing hard, and the darkness was thick. The boy was crying, and she could feel his body trembling in her arms.\n\nThe old woman took a deep breath, and began to sing a nursery rhyme. The boy\u2019s crying slowly stopped, and she felt his body relax. But soon, she heard a rustling, and then a voice called out, \u201cHello there. Who\u2019s there?\u201d The voice was loud, but it was unfamiliar. The old woman stopped, and looked around, but she couldn\u2019t see anyone. \u201cHello, hello, hello. I heard you. Who\u2019s there?\u201d\n\nThe old woman took a deep breath, and nodded, \u201cI\u2019m here. My son is here too.\u201d She heard a rustling, and then a figure appeared. It was a tall woman, with piercing eyes. The old woman could see her eyes clearly in the darkness, and she felt her heart twitch. The tall woman began to walk towards them, and the old woman took a step back, holding the boy up tightly.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d The tall woman asked, and her voice was low. The old woman swallowed, but she found her voice, \u201cI\u2019m just an old woman, and my son. We\u2019re lost, and we\u2019re trying to find our way home.\u201d The tall woman stopped before them, and looked at the boy in the old woman\u2019s arms. \u201cYou\u2019re lost?\u201d\n\nThe old woman nodded, \u201cYes, we\u2019re lost. Can you help us?\u201d\n\nThe tall woman smiled, \u201cWell, we\u2019re almost home. I can give you a ride home if you want.\u201d She said, her eyes gleaming in the darkness. The old woman looked at her hesitantly, but then nodded, \u201cThank you. That would be great. Thank you.\u201d\n\nThe tall woman smiled, and took a step back, \u201cNo problem, no problem. Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d She gestured, and the old woman took a deep breath, and followed her. The boy in her arms looked confused, but he didn\u2019t say anything. The tall woman led them to a cave, and inside, she lit a lantern, and showed them a room. The room was small, but it was cozy.\n\nThe old woman smiled, \u201cThank you. This is great.\u201d But the tall woman smiled again, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, you\u2019re welcome. But first, can you tell me your names?\u201d She asked, her eyes gleaming in the light. The old woman hesitated, but then nodded, \u201cI\u2019m Elara, and this is my son, Kael.\u201d The tall woman smiled, \u201cWonderful. My name is Raven. Nice to meet you both.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut where are we?\u201d Elara asked, looking around the room. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the forest.\u201d\n\nRaven laughed, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not the forest. This is my place. I live here, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d She said, and her eyes gleamed in the light. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cMine.\u201d Kael whispered, looking at Raven. He could see her eyes clearly in the light, and he felt his heart twitch. He looked at his mother, but she didn\u2019t look at him. She looked at Raven, and he could see the fear in her eyes. He felt his heart twist, and he looked at Raven again. She was smiling at him, and he felt his heart skip a beat. He looked at his mother again, and she looked at him, her eyes full of tears.\n\n\u201cMom?\u201d He whispered, looking at her. \u201cI know you\u2019re scared, but I\u2019m here. I promise. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re coming with us.\u201d Elara said, her voice trembling. Raven smiled, \u201cNo, honey. You don\u2019t want to take him with you. He belongs here. He belongs with me.\u201d\n\nElara looked at the boy, and saw him smiling at Raven, \u201cBut he\u2019s my son. I can\u2019t leave him here. Take him to the light, so we can go home.\u201d\n\nRaven laughed, \u201cNo, honey. We can\u2019t leave him here. He belongs with me. And besides, there is no light. The light is gone. It\u2019s gone forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not true.\u201d Elara argued. \u201cI remember the light. It\u2019s always been there. It\u2019ll always be there.\u201d\n\nRaven shook her head, \u201cNo, honey. You\u2019re wrong. I can see it in your eyes. The light is gone"

        "pred_story": "The old wise one stood tall on the steps, gazing up at the ringed gas giant.\n\n\"You all know I'm a simple man,\" he said. \"My father was a farmer, my mother a healer. I learned to plant crops, cure illnesses, and protect my family from harm. I never asked for special powers, never dreamed of being the one chosen by the gods. But then, something strange happened.\"\n\nThe wise one rubbed his chin, the wisps of white hair behind his ears tickling his neck.\n\n\"One day, while walking in the fields, I saw it. The circle. Perfectly round, like a flower blooming in the soil. No beginning or end, no stem or leaf. Just a simple circle.\"\n\nThe crowd leaned in, their eyes shining with awe.\n\n\"And that day, the crops grew faster than any before,\" the wise one continued. \"They grew taller, stronger, and more vibrant. The rain was abundant, the sun shining bright, and the soil, it nourished them, it fed them, it loved them.\"\n\nThe people murmured among themselves, their faces reflecting the wonder of their leader's words.\n\n\"And when the crops were ripe, we harvested them, and the gods granted us a bounty beyond measure. The animals multiplied, the water flowed clean, and the air was crisp, like the morning dew on the grass.\"\n\nThe crowd nodded, some crying, others smiling, but all were in awe of the wise one's tale.\n\n\"Then, we saw the crescent moon, the new beginning, the cycle of life, the promise of renewal. The animals mated, the soil was fertile, and the rains came, bringing life to the parched earth.\"\n\nThe people nodded again, some taking notes on a parchment.\n\n\"And then, the cross. The crossroads. The choices we make. The crossroads of life and death, of right and wrong, of good and evil. We were given a choice, to choose the path that would lead us to prosperity or to ruin.\"\n\nThe crowd murmured, a few gasping, others whispering prayers.\n\n\"And finally, the X, the unknown. The mysteries of the universe. The unknown dangers, the hidden treasures, the secrets of the gods. We were given a gift, a chance to explore, to discover, and to learn.\"\n\nThe crowd sighed, some wiping away tears, others looking up at the rings of Saturn, wondering what other secrets lay hidden among them.\n\n\"So, my children,\" the wise one said, his voice shaking with emotion, \"I have told you the story of the circle, the crescent, the cross, and the X. I have shared with you the gifts the gods have bestowed upon us, and I implore you, do not forget them.\"\n\nThe crowd applauded, some cheering, others weeping, but all were in awe of the wise one's words.\n\n\"And now, my children,\" he said, \"I pass on to you the mantle of leadership. You must remember the circle, the crescent, the cross, and the X. You must respect the gifts of the gods and protect our home, our moon.\"\n\nThe crowd erupted in cheers, some shouting, others chanting, as the wise one descended from the steps, his wrinkled hands raised in a final farewell.\n\nThe moon was home to many tribes, all believing in the same gods. The circle, the crescent, the cross, and the X were shared, but the stories of the wise one were passed on differently, varying from tribe to tribe.\n\nThe Sunbreakers believed that the circle was a symbol of unity, strength, and resilience. They believed that it represented the unbreakable bonds between their people and the earth they cultivated.\n\nThe Raincallers believed that the crescent moon was a symbol of hope, renewal, and protection. They believed that the crescent moon was a reminder of the gods' power and grace, guiding them through times of need.\n\nThe Crossroads believed that the cross was a symbol of choice, freedom, and wisdom. They believed that the crossroads were the choices they made, the paths they chose, and the consequences they faced.\n\nThe X-Men believed that the X was a symbol of the unknown, mystery, and danger. They believed that the X was a reminder of the secrets the gods kept, the mysteries of the universe, and the dangers that lay hidden.\n\nAs the tribes went their separate ways, they carried with them the wise one's words, the circle, the crescent, the cross, and the X. And as they settled into their homes, they whispered prayers to the gods, thanking them for the gifts they bestowed, and asking for their protection in the times of need."

I mean, he was a lord, he was, but not my lord lord. He was my... um.\" She searched around her. \"There! The skull! Hold still, I must get the spell to show you.\" She picked up the skull and tapped it a few times. A holographic head appeared in front of her, and the eyes turned towards me. She pouted at it. \"The skull is not doing it right. Oh well, it would only be for a few days. After that you would need to get it again.

You're the only one who knows that I'm not evil.\" She looked at the skull and then back at me. \"Why do you ask? Am I not evil?\"\n\n\"I'm just confused. I mean, most summoners would want to get rid of their demon after a few hundred years, but you're still using me. I guess I just want to make sure that we're okay.\"\n\n\"Oh, we're okay, my dear summoner.\" She looked sad again. \"I am so sorry for how I have used you. I know that you have a life, and you need to live it, but I need you.\" She looked at the skull and then back at me. \"I would make it worth your while, but I have no wealth or power. If you want to end our relationship now, I will not stop you. I will even give you my blessing to do so, but I need you.\"\n\nI looked at my notebook and saw the play list that I had written earlier.

        "pred_story": "I thought that working in the office building would be boring. I mean, I work in the cube farm, staring at a computer all day. I thought I had to do this for a whole week, and then I get to leave for my real job as a web developer. But that feeling of boredom was replaced with utter fear. I was no longer in my office building, nor was I still on Earth. I was on a massive spaceship, and it looked like it was from science fiction. \n\nI was still wearing my black and white striped shirt, with my light brown pants, with my shoes. My backpack was still on me, and I still had my wallet in it, along with the money inside. It was as if my universe had been turned upside down. And I was walking around in a state of confusion, unsure of where I was or how I got there. But when I heard the voice, my state of fear went to a state of terror.\n\n\"Welcome to the ship. You have been chosen by fate, to come here and save your species.\"\n\nI turned around, and saw a being who was not a human. They were around 7 feet tall, and had scales like a fish. Their skin was a pale blue, and they had bright purple eyes. They were wearing some sort of suit, that looked like it was made of some sort of metallic material. They looked very similar to the humans I've seen in science fiction. \n\n\"Who are you? What do you want from me?\"\n\n\"I am your savior. I am here to warn you of a great danger that faces your species. The danger is so great that it can lead to the destruction of your planet. You will be given a chance to save your planet, but it will require you to convince a council of aliens to not destroy your planet. Are you up for this challenge?\"\n\nMy heart was pounding in my chest. The thought of the aliens destroying the Earth was too much to bear. I didn't know what I had to do, but I would do whatever it takes to save my planet. \n\n\"Yes, I'll do it.\"\n\n\"Excellent choice. Come with me.\"\n\nThe blue skinned being led me to a large room, where I saw a bunch of aliens. There was another species who was similar to the blue being, but their skin was more of a deep purple. There were also a number of aliens who had four arms, each of which had their own set of hands at the end. Then there were some who were similar to a cat, with a feline body, and a long tail. I even saw one alien who looked like a giant octopus. The being who led me here, I realized was a member of the blue species.\n\n\"This is the council. You have come to save your planet. What do you propose we do to avoid its destruction?\"\n\nI was taken aback by the question. I didn't know what to say. I looked around the room, trying to see if any of the aliens would give me any help. But they didn't seem to care about me. They looked at me like I was some sort of insect, who was trying to save the planet. I looked at the blue being, and asked him.\n\n\"Can you give me a minute?\"\n\nHe nodded. I looked at the council, and said.\n\n\"I need a minute to think.\"\n\nThe council nodded, giving me the time I need to think. I was given a minute to think of what to do. But to be honest, I didn't think that I was given enough time. I thought about what the blue being had said, that the aliens were going to destroy Earth. But I didn't know how I was going to prevent it. I was just a regular dude, who worked in a cube farm. \n\nBut I didn't think that my job at the cube farm would be my job for much longer. I was now on a spaceship, talking to aliens. I looked around the room, trying to see any way out. But I didn't see any doors. I didn't see any windows. All I saw was a group of aliens who were staring at me, waiting for me to come up with a plan.\n\nBut I didn't have one. I looked at the blue being, who was standing in the corner. I asked him.\n\n\"I don't have a plan.\"\n\nThe blue being walked up to me, and asked.\n\n\"What do you mean you don't have a plan?\"\n\n\"I don't know how to prevent them from destroying Earth. I'm just a regular dude, who works in a cube farm.\"\n\nThe blue being looked at me with his purple eyes. I thought he would be angry with me, because I didn't have a plan. But surprisingly, he wasn't. He asked me.\n\n\"Do you have any idea why we are going to destroy your planet?\"\n\nI thought about it. I didn't have any idea. But then I thought about something that I saw in the office. It was a memo, that was written in a circular style. It had a lot of corporate jargon that I didn't understand. But one sentence stuck out in my mind.\n\n\"We will be destroyed if we do not go green.\"\n\nI looked at the blue being, and asked.\n\n\"Is that why you want to destroy Earth?\"\n\nThe blue being looked at me with his purple eyes, and asked.\n\n\"Do you know what the memo meant?\"\n\n\"No, I have no idea. It was written in corporate speak, that I didn't understand. But it had something to do with going green, and being destroyed if we don't.\"\n\nThe blue being nodded, and said.\n\n\"The memo you read was written in a language called corporate speak. It is a language that is used by humans to communicate with each other, using corporate jargon. It is a language that only humans can understand.\"\n\n\"So, it was something that only humans can understand. But you are humans, and you are going to destroy Earth.\"\n\nThe blue being looked at me, and said.\n\n\"The memo you read was written in a language that only humans can understand. But it was written to the humans. It was written to tell you that your planet was going to be destroyed if you don't go green. But the council wants to destroy Earth.\"\n\n\"But you don't want to destroy Earth. You want to save the planet.\"\n\nThe blue being nodded, and said.\n\n\"But we can't. The council is made up of different species, and they all have their own agenda. The council wants to destroy Earth, but I don't. I want to save the planet.\"\n\n\"But you can't. What can I do?\"\n\nThe blue being looked at me, and said.\n\n\"You have to convince the council to not destroy Earth. You have to convince them that destroying Earth will not help your species, and that your species will only be able to survive if they are allowed to live on Earth. You have to convince them that they don't have to destroy your planet, and that they can live with your species.\"\n\n\"But what can I say to them? I'm just a regular dude, who works in a cube farm.\"\n\nThe blue being smiled, and said.\n\n\"Ah, I think you are more than that. I think you are an amazing being, who has the power to save your planet. I think you are the one who is"

        "pred_story": "I felt like I was about to die. I had been frozen for so long. The last time I was conscious, I was in a hospital, waiting for a cure for my disease to be found. I was about to die, and my only hope for survival was to be frozen until a cure was found. I could remember my body being placed into a cryo pod as it was put in a freezer that was kept at a very low temperature. I don't know how long I was frozen, but it felt like days, weeks, months, or even years for all I know.\n\nI was awake, and I felt a warmth on my body as I opened my eyes. I could see a bright light, but it was not enough for me to be able to see my surroundings. I heard footsteps, but it was muffled, so I couldn't quite tell where they were coming from. I tried to sit up, but as I did, I felt a sharp pain in my head, and I collapsed to the ground. I had lost the use of my limbs as I was placed into the pod.\n\nI heard a loud noise, and suddenly the bright light was blocked out. I couldn't see a thing, and I could only hear a faint voice talking. \"I think he's awake, we need to get a doctor over here now.\" I tried to speak, but all that came out was a faint whisper. \"I'm here, just relax, I'm going to try to get some information out of you.\" I couldn't tell who was talking, but I couldn't deny that they were trying to be kind. \"So, when were you frozen?\" I tried to answer, but my body failed me, and all that came out was a faint voice speaking on my behalf. \n\n\"Oh, I... I... um, how long was it until my pod was discovered?\" I tried to ask again, but my body failed me once again. \"I... I... um, I... I think I need a pen and some paper.\" I heard footsteps moving in a different direction before the voice returned. \"Here we are, and I hope you can forgive us for not having a pen and paper for you.\" I heard some rustling before the voice returned. \n\n\"Okay, we're here, and we're ready to help. Can you tell me your name?\" I tried to answer, but it was too much. I could feel my body losing strength as I tried to talk, and I was beginning to feel like I was going to black out. I tried to ask again, but my body failed me again. \"Sorry, did I miss your name?\" The voice was full of kindness, but I didn't want to be rude. \"I... I... um, I... uh, I don't know.\" I could see the light in the sky, and I could hear the voices of the people around me. There were a lot of them. I couldn't tell how many, but they were all talking at once.\n\n\"Do you know where you are?\" I tried to answer, but my body failed me again. \"I... I... I don't know.\" I could feel my body losing strength, and I was about to give up. I thought about giving up, but then I heard a voice from the back. \"Hello, my name is Dr. Patel, and I'm an archaeologist. I think you are in an ancient temple.\" I couldn't believe it. \"That's right.\" I said, but my body failed me again. \"I... I... I don't know.\" I heard the voice of the doctor, \"I think you might be having a bit of trouble communicating because of the cryo process. We can try to help you with that, but I think we need to get you to a medical lab first.\"\n\nA medic came by, and they gave me a drug that would help my body recover, and help me communicate better. I was able to speak again, but my memories of the past were still missing. I had lost them all. \"I don't know, I don't remember anything about my life.\" The doctor was kind, but his words were cold. \"I'm sorry, we're going to need to ask you a few questions.\" I was happy that I could communicate again. \"I... I... I don't know.\" The medic was kind, and he gave me some more medication. \"I'm sorry, I can give you some medication that will make you feel a lot better, but it will also make you forget some of your memories.\" I couldn't believe it. \"You... you can make me forget my memories?\" The medic was kind, but I knew that I should not be happy about that. \"I'm sorry, but we're going to need you to forget some of your memories for now.\""

        "pred_story": "I had always been one of those gamers who didn't think it was weird that we can just go and \"marry\" an elf or another race of beings like that. It didn't seem too weird. I mean, I was just going to be married to some elven lady who has a bunch of skills and experience that would be quite useful for a job like being a warrior. And, as a result, I would be the queen of elven kind. I couldn't think of any reasons why I would not do this. Well, maybe a few. Like, how would I get married to an elf? I'm just a guy, and the whole thing was so out there that I couldn't really even imagine it happening. But still, my character was the queen of elves, so I might as well have some fun with it.\n\nI was a pretty strong guy, and I made sure to stay in shape. I was a fan of working out, but I was never a super competitive athlete. I wasn't really a fan of the whole competitive sports thing. So, I didn't have any major athletic abilities, but I was pretty sure I would hold my own if I were put into a fight. I also had a bit of a knack for magic, and was able to learn some simple spells in my free time. It was probably due to some latent magical abilities that the elves were able to tap into.\n\nOne of the things that really made this story fun was how little the elven queen cared about the whole thing. She wasn't too interested in the human world, and she really didn't want anything to do with me. She wasn't really a fan of the whole concept of \"marriage\". She thought it was too formal. It wasn't really an elven thing. But I didn't care. I would get to be the queen of elven kind, and I could do what I wanted as long as it didn't get out of hand. I couldn't really imagine what I could do in this position, so I made sure to focus on getting some more skills and abilities to go along with the job.\n\nBut then, I started to realize that the queen had a few ideas on her own. Not bad ideas, either. In fact, they were quite good. I didn't care for the whole marriage part. She agreed to change that for me, and I became the ruler of elves and the queen's husband. But, my last name was hers. It was a bit weird, I admit. But it made her seem more human, rather than some kind of alien being. She was actually pretty nice too, and I found myself really enjoying her company. We would go for walks together, or play games. We talked a lot. It really wasn't too bad.\n\nBut, that was still not really what the queen had in mind. She had ideas that involved \"using\" me to help her out. That wasn't too bad, since I was kind of used to doing my job at the behest of a superior. But, I wasn't really used to the feeling of being in a relationship. And, the queen had quite a few ideas on the subject. I had thought that she would be kind of distant. But, she didn't really think of me as a companion, so much as an extension of herself. And, she really didn't care for the whole concept of \"consent\". She just kind of expected that I would be fine with her ideas.\n\nStill, I was happy. She had agreed to be my partner, rather than a superior. And, she didn't really seem like someone who would do something like that. But, I figured that it wouldn't hurt to go along with it. And, to my surprise, it really wasn't that bad. I did kind of enjoy her company, and I was kind of happy with her. Well, it was all pretty strange. But, it was all kind of enjoyable, in a weird way. I had never thought that I would end up in a situation like that, but here I was. And, to be honest, it was kind of nice."

It is a mannerism, I know, but I've found it helps people connect with me.

Don't worry, I won't poison you. I've already broken the rules.\"\n\nShe smiled at me, her teeth a sharp glint in the flickering candlelight. One hand, slender and delicate, touched my arm, and I felt the warmth of her touch spread through me. It was a gentle pressure, almost comforting, but I didn't let myself relax.\n\nShe laughed at me, a quiet, musical sound, and pulled out a plate of food from her sleeve. The plate was made of polished wood, a deep brown color, and it was filled with what looked like roasted root vegetables, steaming hot from the oven.\n\n\"Eat,\" she said, pushing the plate towards me.\n\nI pushed it away, my eyes locked on hers. Her eyes were a deep, rich green, with flecks of gold around the edges. Her hair was dark, like the night sky, and it curled around her face in loose spirals.\n\n\"I'm not hungry,\" I lied. \"And even if I were, I wouldn't eat something you offered me.\"\n\nHer smile widened. \"Oh, come now,\" she said. \"Even the fae don't poison their guests. We're not that cruel.\"\n\nShe paused, and I saw a flicker of something in her eyes. Anger, perhaps, or annoyance. But it was quickly replaced by her usual warmth and charm.\n\n\"I'm not cruel,\" she said. \"I'm just... eager. I want to help you, to make you feel welcome in my home. And the best way to do that is to feed you.\"\n\nI swallowed, and felt a knot form in my throat. It was hard to think with the fae logic looping around my brain, but I knew that if I ate something she offered me, she would be able to manipulate me. To control me.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. \"But I'm not hungry.\"\n\nHer face fell, and I saw a flash of sadness in her eyes. But it was quickly replaced by that damned charming smile.\n\n\"Suit yourself,\" she said. \"But don't say I didn't warn you. Your choice of diet will affect your health, and your mood. And I can't help you if you're too stubborn to accept my help.\"\n\nShe sighed, and leaned back in her chair. I wondered if she would try to convince me further, to tempt me with more food or other offerings, but she seemed to have accepted my refusal.\n\nAs we sat in silence, I couldn't help but wonder what would happen if I ate something she offered me. Would I be trapped in her realm forever, bound to her will? Or would I be freed, able to leave the fae kingdom behind and return to my own world?\n\nI couldn't take the risk. But at the same time, I couldn't help but feel a pang of regret for refusing the food.\n\n\"Is there anything else you can offer me?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nHer smile returned, and she leaned forward in her chair. \"I could offer you shelter,\" she said, \"or company. I could show you the wonders of my realm.\"\n\nI shook my head, and she sighed. I could feel her disappointment, though she didn't let it show in her eyes.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said, again. \"But I don't feel comfortable here.\"\n\nShe nodded, and her smile returned. \"I understand,\" she said. \"But be warned, I will do everything in my power to make you feel comfortable. I will even try to tempt you, to make you see the wonders of my realm.\"\n\nI frowned, but she just smiled. \"I promise,\" she said, \"that I will be gentle. But I must try.\"\n\nAnd with that, she leaned back in her chair, and we sat in silence again. I couldn't help but wonder what would happen next. Would I be tempted by her offers? Or would I find a way to escape?"

She's wearing a green t-shirt with white pants. There's even a silver watch on her arm. She looks normal, just a little taller than average and her skin has that green tint, and her eyes have a black slit instead of pupils, but besides that she's a normal person.

There's no claws, just toes. And look at her face. See all those little lines around her mouth and her eyes? Look at those wrinkles. Human skin does that and all the little lines like that too. She's a human, just not a human like you.*\n\n*How could she be a human like us? We're just people! We can't be humans like that!*\n\n*Well... she says she's a human. I'm sure of it. She said something about a human and how it was a big word in her language, she said it's something that means people who are intelligent and able to learn.

So we don't have to be monsters anymore!*\n\n*I don't want to be a monster!*\n\n*Neither do I! But I want to see my mom again. I want to see you too and I want to see her!

I've got a pretty good understanding of just how much I suck.\n\nPeople avoid me. Like, actively. That's not a surprise, but it's disappointing. I thought it was because they wanted to, you know, hear my song.\n\nI know I'm not the only one who knows this, but most humans don't get it. I'm not a siren like in the old stories. I'm more like the creepy monster you leave your phone battery on while it's still connected to the wall outlet. If you know what I mean.\n\nSome guys try to hook up, but they usually end up screaming and running. I mean, I guess that's kind of flattering? It's hard to imagine anyone would want to, you know, actually *be* with me. I'm not even sure I want to.\n\nSome people try to take pictures with me, and they usually end up falling for the trick. I'll let them get close enough to take a selfie, and then I'll grab their arm and yank them off the cliff. They always seem so surprised.\n\nI get it, I'm not the most pleasant company. But come on. Most people would want a chance to hear my song. I'd be happy to sing just for them.\n\nToday was the first time someone sang back. I was a little hopeful, but I wasn't expecting much. I mean, who wants to be stuck with me all day?\n\nIt wasn't even a good song. I guess that's fair, I didn't expect someone to be a genius with a hook for a hand either.\n\nI was at the grocery store when he started singing. I don't know why he picked the middle of the cereal aisle to break out into song, but he did. The song was bad, but I was intrigued. He was singing about the dangers of buying cereal, something about the sugar content ruining his brain.\n\nAt least, that's what it sounded like. It's not like I have much to compare it to. I've tried to sing along to the radio a few times, but I usually end up getting lost in the middle of a song. I know I've got a good ear for music, but when you have a hook for a hand, it's not exactly easy to hold onto a microphone.\n\nIt was weird. There weren't many people around, but I could hear him clearly. I didn't know whether to be happy or sad, I guess. It was the first time someone had actually listened to me, and I didn't know whether to be grateful or disappointed.\n\nThe song was bad, but I heard him clearly. I don't know how he was able to find me, but he must have been able to hear me somehow. I thought that was pretty cool, but I didn't know what to do about it. I've never had someone that interested in me before. I didn't know how to react.\n\nHe was singing about how he could only afford half a loaf of bread. I'm pretty sure that's not what he said, but that's what it sounded like. Like I said, I don't exactly have the best ear for music.\n\nI tried to pay attention to the rest of the song, but it was hard. I was feeling a little overwhelmed, and I didn't know whether to be happy or sad. I wanted to sing along with him, but I didn't know if he could hear me.\n\nWhen the song finished, he looked around and saw me. I'm not sure what he expected, but he looked a little surprised. I guess that's fair, I'm not exactly the most approachable person.\n\nHe waved and smiled at me, and I waved back. I guess that's all it is, I thought. Just a smile. That's all anyone has ever really wanted from me.\n\nI wanted to say something back, but I didn't know what to say. I'm pretty bad at conversation. He asked me if I wanted to grab a cup of coffee with him, and I said yes. I guess that's all it is, I thought. Just a smile.\n\nWe sat down at a coffee shop and talked for a while. I was nervous, but he seemed pretty easy going. I think he might be interested in me? I don't know if it's possible, but he seemed pretty interested in me.\n\nWhen he got up to leave, I felt a little sad. I didn't want him to go, but I knew it was probably for the best. He'd already spent way too much time with me, and I was sure he'd regret it when the sun came up.\n\nBut even as he was walking away, he turned around and waved at me. He smiled, and I felt my heart skip a beat. Maybe he's interested after all, I thought. Maybe it's actually possible.\n\nI don't know, I guess time will tell. But maybe it's not about finding someone to love me. Maybe it's about finding someone to be myself around. Maybe it's not about finding a boyfriend, but finding a friend.\n\nI don't know. But I think it might be possible. And that's all I need right now."

        "pred_story": "A very normal Tuesday.\n\nWaking up in a coffin as an immortal. I get that from time to time. People die, people who I have bitten. And they become me. A vampire. The worst part is that they end up in a coffin. I never liked coffins. So creepy. And cold. But at least they aren't too hard to find. All you need to do is wait until midnight. People tend to go to bed then.\n\nBut today was different. For once I didn't find a body. No coffin. No tomb. No grave. No person dead in a way that was strange enough to stand out. I went home, drank some blood and took a long nap. Just another week of being a vampire, nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nUntil I woke up.\n\nBut this time I wasn't alone. Not in my coffin. Someone was in my coffin. And that someone was on fire. I sat up quickly and ran to my bedroom door. It opened with a push and I stepped out into my bedroom. The fire was getting worse and worse. But I couldn't see the person in the coffin. I thought to myself, *what kind of crazy person would set themselves on fire?* That's when I heard a voice.\n\nYou think you're safe from things that go bump in the night?\n\nI walked over to my window and looked out. No other buildings. Just a cliff. And the person in the coffin had vanished. I turned around and I found her. She was standing next to my coffin. Her face was burned. So I knew it was her. She was in my coffin when she died. I stared at her and she looked back.\n\nYou don't want to think about that. What happens when you are dead. What happens when your body rots. Or when you are thrown in a sea with weights attached to your feet. This is all you'll have to think about. What happens when you are dead. And I am stuck with you. I have been stuck with people who I have killed for a long time. But I have never been stuck with a ghost.\n\nYou are mine now. You are mine. You are mine. You are mine. Oh fuck, that's really annoying. Do you have anything better to do? I hate being a vampire. I hate being a ghost. I hate being stuck together. Do you have anything better to do? Do you have anything better to do? Oh, fuck I'm sorry. I think this is the first time that we have talked. And I know that I don't want to talk to you. \n\nBut I don't know what to do. I want you to get out of my head. I want you to go away. But you are stuck with me. So what can I do? I can leave. And I can start over. I can find a new house. A new home. And I can start again. I can't kill anyone else. I can't be stuck with another person. I don't think that I can do that. But I can leave. I can leave and I can start over. I can be someone else. But I'll always know that this happened. I'll always know that I was trapped in my coffin with a girl on fire.\n\nWhat are you doing? Where are you going? I don't know. I don't know. I want to leave. I want to go somewhere else. I want to be alone. But I don't want to be alone. I don't want to be by myself. I want to be with someone. But not like that. I want to be with someone where we both can move. I want to be with someone where we both can talk.\n\nWhat are you doing? Where are you going? I'm leaving. I'm going to leave this house. And I'm going to start over. And you can't stop me. I can't leave you. What are you going to do? I will find you again. I will follow you. I will find you again. Oh, fuck. I am going to make you suffer. I am going to make you suffer. I am going to make you suffer. I am going to make you suffer. Oh, fuck. I am going to make you suffer. Oh, fuck. I am going to make you suffer. I am going to make you suffer. I am going to make you suffer."

HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SICK AND NOW MY MOTHER IS GONE!!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cAhem.\u201d Said the nurse. \u201cExcuse me miss, could you please keep your voice down? Your brother is trying to sleep.\u201d  \n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s okay! He\u2019s going to be fine! But I have to go out and find my mom!! She said she would be back in 2 hours and it\u2019s already 4! Something terrible happened to her!!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s see what\u2019s going on here and see if we can get you calmed down.\u201d Said the nurse as she took out a chart and began reading it. \u201cIt says here that your mom gave you a very specific set of instructions and if anything happened to her, you\u2019re supposed to go to the hospital.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m only 10!! I don\u2019t know how to make it to the hospital!!!\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d Said the nurse as she looked down at the chart. \u201cIt says here that your mom was going to meet you at the hospital.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why?!\u201d Cried the girl.\n\n\u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll answer your questions but you have to calm down.\u201d Said the nurse. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down and we\u2019ll talk about this for a bit?\u201d  \n\nThe girl nodded as she walked over to the bed and sat down. The nurse then sat down beside her and continued her questions. \u201cSo, your mom said that if she didn\u2019t meet you at the hospital in 2 hours, she wanted you to come and talk to me?\u201d  \n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Replied the girl.\n\n\u201cOkay. So, do you know what happened to her mom? Maybe she was just running a little late?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was going on a date. But that\u2019s not it.\u201d Said the girl.\n\n\u201cOkay. What do you think it was then? Maybe she got stuck in traffic or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said something about a vampire. She said that they were getting more desperate so they needed her help.\u201d\n\n\u201cA vampire?\u201d Asked the nurse. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, I don\u2019t have a clue what to do.\u201d She turned around and then got back on the phone. \u201cHello, this is nurse Smith. We have a situation here and we need some advice.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, we have a situation.\u201d Said the voice on the other end of the phone.\n\n\u201cYes. We have a 10 year old girl and her mother is a vampire.\u201d Said the nurse.\n\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s a problem. I\u2019m a vampire. I work with a lot of them. What seems to be the problem?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, her mom said that she would be meeting her at the hospital in 2 hours but she never showed up. She said that if anything happened to her that she wanted her daughter to come and talk to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I think I know what happened to her mom. It sounds like she had a meeting with a group of vampires that didn\u2019t want to be found out. They tend to be very secretive but they are also very desperate so they try and get rid of people that they don\u2019t want to be found out by.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think you could find her?\u201d Asked the nurse.\n\n\u201cYes. I will try to find her.\u201d Replied the vampire.\n\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re a vampire. Why do you want to help her?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause she is my daughter. That\u2019s why.\u201d\n\nThe nurse sat down for a second before standing up again. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. You\u2019re a vampire. You\u2019re over 200 years old. How can you be a mother?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that a lot of humans can\u2019t understand how vampire society works but I hope that you can understand this one thing. Vampires can mate with other vampires, with humans, and with many other supernatural races. I have many children but I love each of them very much.\u201d Said the vampire.\n\nThe nurse sat down for a second again before looking at the girl. \u201cWell, that\u2019s good to hear. But I need you to go find your mom and see what happened to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Said the girl.\n\n\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa. It\u2019s okay to cry.\u201d Said the nurse. \u201cIt\u2019s very scary to be by yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Said the girl. \u201cI don\u2019t want my mom to be mad at me.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not mad at you. She\u2019s mad that the bad people got in her way. But don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re going to get your mom back.\u201d\n\nThe girl then stood up and ran out of the room. The nurse then followed her and went to the reception desk. \u201cI want to talk to my mom. She\u2019s out with my dad, right?\u201d Asked the girl.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Said the receptionist. \u201cThey\u2019ll be back soon. They have a reservation at a nice restaurant across the street.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the bathroom?\u201d Asked the girl.  \n\n\u201cUh, it\u2019s down that way.\u201d Said the receptionist as she pointed to a hallway.\n\nThe girl then ran down the hallway and went into the bathroom. She locked the door and then pulled out a mirror. She stared at herself for a second before looking down at her hands. They were covered in blood and the skin was almost gone. She then looked at herself again in the mirror. Her eyes were glowing bright red.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Asked the girl.\n\n\u201cBecause you were bitten. You're a vampire.\u201d Said a voice behind her.\n\nThe girl then looked in the mirror again. Her eyes were back to normal. She then turned around to look at who was behind her.\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d Said the girl.\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d Said the man. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there were any vampires still alive. We thought they were all extinct.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not extinct. Just rare.\u201d Said the girl.\n\n\u201cRarity doesn\u2019t matter when it comes to vampires. It\u2019s just a myth that humans invented to explain how people die under the full moon.\u201d Said the man.\n\n\u201cI was bitten. My eyes turned into red for a second.\u201d Said the girl.\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019re a vampire.\u201d Said the man.\n\n\u201cBut my mom said that it only happens to people that aren\u2019t vampires if they\u2019re turned.\u201d Said the girl.\n\n\u201cYes. But it only happens to people that are turned that haven\u2019t been in their teenage years. Vampires have been around for thousands of years and they have learned to control their bodies. Your mom must have told you the story about how she was turned because she knew you had the potential to become a vampire.\u201d Said the man.\n\nThe girl looked at the man for a second before turning around and going back into the bathroom. She went into a stall and shut the door. She then looked down at her hands again. They were back to normal. She then looked up at the ceiling and laughed as she screamed."

My boss hadn't messaged me in five years, not since I quit, and I thought I'd never hear from him again.\n\nI had left Hell Corporation when I was 40. I was tired of working myself to death for no pay. I was tired of dealing with the demonic overloads, tired of the constant meetings, and just tired. I took a job at a small marketing firm and spent the rest of my retirement planning on how to get rid of him.\n\nI tried to extend my contract, but he refused. He looked at me tiredly and told me I would never come back. I hadn't been back in five years, just like he'd said. But now, he was calling me in. Not for a meeting, not to ask me for a favor, but to tell me something.\n\nI looked at the time on my phone. It was just after midnight, and I had to get ready for work in two hours. I was already in bed, but I tossed my covers off and put on my shoes. I was only wearing pajamas, but I didn't care.\n\nWhen I got to the Hell Corporation building, I walked up to the front door and knocked. The door was answered by the head of security. I hadn't seen him in five years. He hadn't aged a day.\n\n\"Ms. Adams, I didn't expect to see you here tonight.\" He said. I didn't see anyone behind him, and he didn't mention a boss. \"What brings you to Hell Corporation today?\"\n\n\"Mr. Adams, I need to speak to my boss. It's urgent.\" I said, ignoring his question. He looked at me for a moment before walking out of the room. He left me standing alone in the lobby. When he returned, he brought another person with him.\n\nThey stood in the lobby, the large wooden table between us. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, and I had to steady myself so I didn't fall over. I was sweating, and I could feel my legs shaking.\n\n\"I apologize, but my boss is quite busy today. However, I am authorized to speak with you on his behalf.\" Mr. Adams said. I narrowed my eyes at him. What was going on?\n\n\"That's fine. But I need to see him.\" I said. Mr. Adams looked at the other man behind him, who spoke.\n\n\"I'm so sorry, Ms. Adams. Mr. Adams, please, explain.\" The man said.\n\n\"My boss has passed on, Ms. Adams. He died yesterday. And I need your help.\" Mr. Adams said, his voice filled with urgency.\n\nI stared at him, shocked. The man standing behind him was the head of finance. \"What's going on?\"\n\n\"The reason I wanted you back was to take over as interim CEO until I can find a new one. And I need your help.\" He said.\n\nI stared at them both, my jaw hanging open. I didn't know what to say. This was a shock. I didn't think I'd be back to Hell Corporation before my retirement, let alone running it.\n\n\"Are you certain? Because I think I'm too old to take on the job.\" I said, trying to play it cool. Mr. Adams smiled at me.\n\nYou were born for this, Ms. Adams. And I need your help.\" He said. I thought about what he said, and then I nodded. He was right, I was born for this."

        "pred_story": "I had been trying to get into my car for what felt like hours. As I struggled to get to the door, a figure emerged from the shadows. He was an older man, with a ragged beard and tattered clothes. He looked down at me from my car door, then back at me with a look of disappointment.\n\n\"You need help?\" I asked, my hands gripping the car door as hard as I could. I didn't think I could push it open, but if this man knew a trick I could use, I was willing to listen.\n\nHe sighed, shaking his head. \"You don't know, do you?\" He sat down next to me on the hood of the car. \"You don't know what's out there.\" He looked up at the sky, his eyes dim and sorrowful.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" I asked, my voice tight with frustration. My car had broken down on the side of the road, and I was tired and annoyed. The sun was starting to rise, and it was already hot. \"I just need to get my car started, that's all.\"\n\nHe turned to me, his eyes blazing. \"You don't know,\" he repeated, his voice low and urgent. \"They don't want you to know. They don't want you to see.\" He pointed out at the world around us, as if showing me something I had missed.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked, confused. I had no idea what he was talking about. This man was crazy, and I should get away from him before he did something dangerous. I tried to stand, but he grasped my arm.\n\nHe pulled me down, and I looked at him in alarm. His eyes were dark and desperate, and he was holding a book. It was old and worn, with strange symbols on its cover.\n\nHe leaned in, his lips near my ear. \"This is the truth,\" he whispered. \"The truth about the world we live in. This is the truth you don't know.\"\n\nI tried to shake him off, but he held tight. \"What is this?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. \"What are you going to do?\"\n\nHe opened the book, and I felt a shiver run down my spine. The pages were yellowed and cracked, with symbols that seemed to dance in the air. They were strange and incomprehensible, but somehow I knew what they meant.\n\nThe man spoke a word, and the page he was reading turned up. The world around us blurred, and suddenly I was somewhere else. I was standing in a field of flowers, surrounded by rolling hills and tall trees.\n\nA figure approached me, and I recognized her as a queen. She was dressed in a gown of gold, with a crown on her head and a scepter in her hand. She smiled at me, and I felt a surge of power run through me.\n\nI knew what I was doing, but I couldn't explain it. I was casting a spell, but I had never studied magic before. I had never known how to do it, but somehow I had learned.\n\nThe queen spoke to me, her voice like music in my mind. She was telling me what to do, and I did it without hesitation. I spoke the words, cast the spells, and watched as the world around me changed.\n\nThe queen smiled at me, her eyes shining with pride. \"You are one of us,\" she said. \"One of the few who have learned the truth.\"\n\nI looked around at the world around me, and saw that it was different. The buildings were made of something other than stone and steel, and the air was filled with a strange, pulsating energy.\n\n\"This is magic,\" the queen said. \"And you have learned it.\"\n\nI turned to the old man, and saw that he was holding a book. It was the same book he had shown me in my car, and I realized now that it was real.\n\n\"This is the truth,\" he said, handing me the book. \"The truth you didn't know.\"\n\nI took it from him, feeling its weight in my hands. I knew now what I had learned, and I knew that I had been living in a world I didn't understand.\n\nI looked back at the queen, who was smiling at me. \"You will use this knowledge,\" she said. \"You will use it to fight against those who would keep it from you.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a surge of determination run through me. I knew what I had to do, and I was ready to do it."

        "pred_story": "The daydreaming was more intense than before. It had been years since I first had the first of those. The first was the death of my sister in a car accident. I was too young then and didn't know it was happening, but my parents did and had been trying to figure out how to protect me from it. This was the second, but it was much more recent and was far more disturbing than the first.\n\nI thought about it briefly as I was daydreaming and knew it was one of them. There were things I recognized from what I had experienced. I knew it was a person. I knew that I would feel it. I knew it was something I had seen before. I just didn't know what to do.\n\nI couldn't wake up from these ones. I couldn't stop them. I couldn't move while they happened. All I could do was observe. I couldn't help that person. I couldn't stop what happened. I couldn't even wake up before it was over. All I could do was watch and know it was happening. And it always did.\n\nThat was why they were so dangerous. That was why they were worth so much. People would pay for the privilege of causing the daydreaming. It would give them the power to control others. It was why so many died in them. It was why the market was so high for them.\n\nI didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to stop it. I didn't know how to avoid it. All I could do was wait and know it was coming. I could only hope it would end soon.\n\nAnd then it happened. The scene began. I was outside, in a forest. I knew the forest. It was one I had been to before. I knew what was in it. I knew what would happen next.\n\nI closed my eyes and knew it would begin. I closed my eyes and waited for it to happen. It always did.\n\nI felt a pain in my chest as I was hit with the daydream. I could feel it. I could feel it happening. I could feel my life slipping away as I watched.\n\nI opened my eyes and screamed as I felt my body begin to fall. I screamed as I felt my life slipping away. I screamed as I watched.\n\nAnd then it was over. I was dead. I couldn't wake up. I couldn't move. I couldn't stop it. All I could do was wait for the next day.\n\nI had been caught up in a lucid dream. I was aware I was dreaming. I knew it was a dream. And I knew it was a lucid dream.\n\nI had been lucid dreaming since I was a child. It was normal. I could do it. And I was able to control them as I was dreaming. It was why lucid dreams were valuable.\n\nBut the lucid dreams were also why they were worth so much. People would pay a fortune to cause the lucid dreams. They would pay a fortune to use a lucid dreamer. And they would pay to control the lucid dreams.\n\nI didn't know why. I didn't know what they did. But I knew it happened. I knew it was happening. And I knew that the lucid dreams were worth something.\n\nThe lucid dreams didn't have the same effect on the dreamer as the normal daydreams did. They didn't feel the same. But they still did something. They still affected the dreamer in a way that was different from normal daydreams.\n\nThe lucid dreams were also more dangerous than normal daydreams. They didn't just cause the daydreaming. They caused it to happen in a different way. They caused the daydreaming to be more intense and more disturbing.\n\nI didn't know how it happened. I didn't know why it happened. But I knew that it did. And I knew it was happening.\n\nThe lucid dreams were the most valuable thing I had. And the lucid dreams were my death. I knew it was happening. And I knew I couldn't stop it.\n\nI knew the lucid dreams were why I would die. I knew they were why people wanted to hire me. I knew they were why the lucid dreams were worth so much.\n\nI didn't know how to control them. I didn't know how to stop them. I didn't know how to do anything except live through them.\n\nBut I knew one thing. I was going to be found out. I was going to be caught. I was going to die. And I knew that it was coming. I knew it was inevitable.\n\nI tried to ignore it as it happened. I tried to focus on something else. I tried to distract myself.\n\nI tried to look around. I tried to look around and see what I was dreaming about. I tried to look around and see if there was anything in the dream that I could control.\n\nI tried to focus on something else. I tried to focus on something else and make myself more aware.\n\nBut I couldn't. I couldn't focus. I couldn't control. All I could do was watch.\n\nAnd then the lucid dream ended. I woke up and found myself lying on the floor.\n\nI had been asleep for hours. And I knew it was coming. I knew I would die.\n\nAnd I knew that I would be found out. I knew that I would be caught. I knew that I would be used.\n\nBut I couldn't do anything to stop it. All I could do was wait. All I could do was know that it was happening."

        "pred_story": "Alden leaned against the wall, his eyes closing as he let his mind wander. It wasn't the first time he'd been on guard duty; it was the eleventh. He'd grown tired of the routine, the same watch pattern day in and day out. The same drills, the same formations, the same endless marching. Alden felt a bit numb, having been on the front lines with the same squad for nigh on three years. They were lucky; few squads remained as whole as his for so long.\n\nThe sun was high overhead, the sky clear of clouds. A gentle breeze drifted through the fort's gates, carrying the smell of the grasslands beyond the palisade. The fort's wall stretched towards the horizon, the palisade's slats lined up perfectly. The gates were covered in a thick layer of mud, which would prevent invaders from attacking the fort with siege engines or catapults. Each gate had its own post, with the same two guards, Jax and Alric, standing outside as they did every hour.\n\nAlden checked his pocket watch. It was time for a checkup. The door creaked open, allowing a tall figure dressed in black to enter. She wore a helmet made of a black metal Alden had never seen before, a mask covering most of her face. She was a strange sight, one he'd only seen once before.\n\n\"Check time,\" she called out.\n\nAlden put a finger in his ear, turning the watch over and glancing at it. He nodded at her, and the guard closed the door behind her. The two sat down at the long table in the center of the room, their shoulders pressed to the walls as they watched the other. There was a silence between them, one that neither seemed to mind.\n\n\"So, how are you?\" she asked, breaking the silence.\n\n\"I'm fine,\" Alden replied, turning the watch over again. \"Just bored.\"\n\n\"Same old same old, huh?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I don't mind the drills too much. They help me keep in shape. But the same thing every day does get a bit old.\"\n\n\"Same here, actually. I got stuck at the bottom of the tower a few years ago.\"\n\n\"Wasn't that supposed to be a punishment?\"\n\n\"It was. I didn't know that at the time, though. Anyway, it was pretty bad. I was stuck there for six months until they found me. The only thing I could do to keep myself entertained was talk. So I talked to myself and the other soldiers stationed there.\"\n\n\"That sounds tough.\"\n\n\"It wasn't the best time. You, on the other hand, seem like you're having a great time.\"\n\n\"Oh, no. It's just a bit boring at times.\"\n\n\"It's not the same as getting to see the world.\"\n\nAlden nodded. \"Yeah, I guess not. I just wish I could see what's outside the walls. The only things that come into the walls are birds, and even they're rare. I heard they're very common outside.\"\n\n\"Yes, they are. They're not much to look at, but they're a good start. Anyway, I don't mean to pry.\"\n\n\"It's fine. It's no big deal. Anyway, I guess I should get back to my station.\"\n\nThe guard nodded at him. \"You go ahead, then. I'll let the others know that it's your last checkup before you go.\"\n\nAlden smiled slightly. \"Thanks. And sorry to bore you.\"\n\n\"No, it's fine. Just feel free to come up here if you need to talk to someone.\" The guard nodded at him, and he left his station and headed to the next one.\n\nThe sun was high when Alden returned to his station. He leaned against the wall once more, letting his mind wander. The guard was gone by the time he got there, leaving behind only her helmet and mask. Alden frowned, glancing at the door before he shrugged and picked up the helmet. He turned it over in his hands, wondering what it might be made of. The metal was incredibly hard, and Alden could only scratch it with the blade on his dagger. He was still pondering the metal's properties when he heard a voice behind him.\n\n\"Hello?\" Alden turned, his eyes locking onto a pair of eyes. They were an unusual color, a mix of blue and green that Alden had never seen. \"I saw you picking up my helmet.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" Alden replied, slowly standing up. \"I wasn't sure what it was, but it seemed too interesting to pass up.\"\n\nThe woman chuckled, her voice high-pitched and rich. \"I can understand that,\" she said. \"My name is Gwynevere. What's yours?\"\n\n\"Alden,\" he replied, smiling. \"Nice to meet you.\"\n\nThe same smiled back, her teeth perfectly aligned in a perfect smile. Alden found himself mesmerized, unable to look away. She seemed to be drinking in every detail, her eyes lingering on every part of his face.\n\n\"Same to you, Alden.\" She glanced at her hands before clenching them into fists. \"I'm sorry. I'm just a bit... nervous.\"\n\n\"Why is that?\"\n\nGwynevere shook her head. \"I don't know. It's just my first time outside these walls, and the other soldiers are a bit more... unpredictable. I know that's not a great word to describe people, but...\"\n\n\"Wait,\" Alden said, raising a finger to his ear. \"I think I know what you mean.\"\n\n\"I don't think you do,\" Gwynevere replied, her eyes narrowing slightly.\n\n\"Of course I do. You're one of the enforcers, aren't you?\"\n\nGwynevere's eyes narrowed further, and her jaw clenched. \"What?\"\n\n\"You're the one I see on the tower,\" Alden said, tapping the watch in his pocket. \"The one who checks up on us and gives us advice. You're one of the most interesting people I've ever met.\"\n\nGwynevere looked at him for a long time before her face softened. \"I guess I should be flattered,\" she said. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"No need to thank me,\" Alden replied. \"I just wanted to tell the truth.\"\n\n\"No, I really think there's no need. But I guess it's nice to finally meet you.\"\n\n\"It's nice to finally meet you too,\" Alden said, smiling. He reached out and touched her face, feeling a strange tingle run through his body. \"Thank you for visiting me.\"\n\nGwynevere smiled back. \"No, thank you. I really enjoyed talking to you.\"\n\n\"Same here.\" Alden turned back to the wall, but he didn't feel the same sense of boredom as he did before. He looked at the helmet on the ground beside him, wondering if he would ever see the woman again."

        "pred_story": "It was an easy spell. Just a flick of my wrist, and a small burst of magic would be unleashed onto the target. The magic wouldn't affect the target directly. Instead, it would go to the target's mind. A spell of clarity and focus. One that would stop the target's thoughts from clouding with fear. One that would give the target a clear head.\n\nIt was my first spell of clarity, but I wasn't really worried about it. After all, my instructor, Arachne, had told me that it was a very simple spell. She had also told me that I had a natural talent for magic, and that I should focus on honing that talent.\n\nMy instructor had told me to cast the spell on a small target. Not a person, but something like a small ball of wood or something. But I didn't have a ball of wood on me. So instead, I decided to cast the spell on myself. I had a lot of fear about this whole thing. What if the magic got out of control? What if I did something wrong?\n\nBut as I cast the spell, nothing went wrong. I felt a surge of magic flow through my body. It felt like a rush of wind, but I didn't feel it. Not in the way a normal person would feel wind. I felt it all throughout my body. A rush of power. A rush of energy. A rush of clarity.\n\nWhen I finished the spell, I could feel it. I could feel the magic coursing through my body. I could feel the clarity that the magic brought. But more importantly, I could feel the absence of fear. The fear that had filled my body before the spell was gone. Replaced by a sense of calm and focus. A sense of clearness.\n\n\"Wow,\" I said to myself. \"That was a lot easier than I thought it would be.\" The spell of clarity was my third spell. I had been practicing for a week now, and each day had been more impressive than the last. I had started with something simple. A simple spell of light. One that would give me a small burst of light that would last for a few seconds. A spell that would help me practice the basics of magic.\n\nThen, I had moved on to a spell of movement. A spell that would allow me to move objects with my magic. A spell that would require a lot more control and finesse than the first spell.\n\nNow, I was trying a spell of clarity. A spell that would help me get rid of distractions. A spell that would help me focus. A spell that was much harder to cast than my previous two spells.\n\nBut it had worked. And it had worked well. I felt a sense of calm and focus. A sense of clarity. A sense that had eluded me for so long. The fear that had plagued me for so long had been gone. Replaced by a sense of calm and focus.\n\nAnd then, it hit me. The realization that I had finally found something I was good at. Something that I enjoyed. Something that made me feel alive. Something that I wanted to continue doing. It made me realize that there were more things out there for me. That there were more spells to learn and to master. More objects to move with my magic.\n\nIt made me want to continue practicing. To continue honing my magic. To continue perfecting my skills. To continue doing something that I was good at. To continue doing something that made me feel alive. To continue doing something that brought me joy. I could feel it all throughout my body. The joy of discovery. The joy of discovery that I had finally found something I was good at.\n\nAnd then, it hit me again. The realization that I had finally found something I enjoyed. Something that I was good at. Something that I wanted to continue doing. Something that made me feel alive. Something that I was passionate about. It made me realize that there were more things out there for me.\n\nThat there were more spells to learn and to master. More objects to move with my magic. More objects to affect with my magic. It made me want to continue practicing. To continue honing my magic. To continue perfecting my skills. To continue doing something that I was good at. To continue doing something that made me feel alive. To continue doing something that brought me joy.\n\n\"Wow,\" I said to myself. \"I had no idea I was this good at this.\" It was easy to cast. It was easy to master. It was easy to perfect. It was easy to get it right. And it was easy to get wrong. A fact that I had learned the hard way.\n\nI had tried the spell once before, but I had failed. I had failed miserably. I had cast the spell, but instead of getting the desired result, the spell had caused a small explosion. One that had caused a small crater in the ground. A crater that had surprised me. A crater that had gotten me in trouble.\n\nBut today, I had gotten it right. I had cast the spell, and it had worked. I had gotten the desired result. The result that I had been going for. The result that I had been practicing. The result that I had been perfecting. The result that I had been working towards.\n\nIt had been a long journey. A journey that had taken me months to complete. But it had been worth it. I had learned a lot on my journey. I had learned a lot about magic. I had learned a lot about myself. And I had learned a lot about the world. But now, I had reached my destination."

        "pred_story": "\"I see what you mean,\" said Henry. \"We're not the only survivors of this pandemic. Most people aren't immune to the bite. We should ask the others if they want to be in our alliance.\"\n\n\"There is no cure to this virus,\" said a new voice. \"There is no vaccine, nor medicine to treat it. As it eats your internal organs, your cells, it corrupts them until you're a monster. It changes your mind, your thoughts until you only have one.\"\n\nHenry and his group were in a large room, mostly dead and in a state of disarray. The floor had been cleaned by the survivors, and the walls and ceiling had been reinforced by reinforced pillars and bars. It had been turned into a shelter for those who had survived the initial outbreak, and now into a place for all survivors to take refuge.\n\n\"This is true,\" said Henry. \"However, what do you propose we do? How do we kill them off? They are too many for us to kill one by one, and we do not have enough resources for a fight.\"\n\n\"We can use the resources we have,\" said the new speaker. \"We can have them kill each other off. Then we can kill what is left.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure that's a good idea,\" said one of Henry's men. \"We've seen what they look like. You know they can be fast, too fast for us to catch. They can run on all fours and climb trees, and they can swim in the ocean. And they're not alone, there are countless of them out there.\"\n\n\"It is the only way, you know it,\" said the new speaker. \"We cannot win in a fight, not against so many. But we can make the zombies kill themselves. They need humans for the virus to infect them, to multiply. There are some things we can use to give them what they need.\"\n\n\"We know of that,\" said Henry. \"But we must be careful in our use of it. We cannot make a mistake in this. We need their help to survive.\"\n\n\"Agreed, that is why we must be careful. But how do you plan on using them?\"\n\n\"We can't let them know about the alliance,\" said Henry. \"But we need their help. They must know that we are here to be our last hope.\"\n\n\"So what do you propose? How do you plan on making them see that we are not a threat, and that we will help each other?\"\n\n\"We will have to show them,\" said Henry. \"We will have to show them that we are not a threat, that we only want to survive. We will have to tell them that our alliance is to prevent both our species from becoming extinct. We will have to tell them of the zombies.\"\n\n\"That will only make them hate us more,\" said Henry's man. \"They don't care about survival. All they need is to feed on us.\"\n\n\"They are already thinking of us as food,\" said Henry. \"So we have to show them that we are not a threat. We will have to tell them that we will be feeding on them. That we will be eating their bodies, and that they must do the same.\"\n\n\"That will only make them attack us,\" said Henry's man.\n\n\"No, we will show them that we will be eating only the dead. The zombies. That we will not touch their kind.\"\n\n\"But they have no kind,\" said Henry. \"They are already dead.\"\n\n\"That is why they are so angry with us,\" said the new speaker. \"They are the dead, and we are the living. But we can show them that we are only trying to survive. They can see that we are in need of their help. And we can give them what they want in return. We can give them the bodies of the dead, so they can feast on them. We can give them what they need to survive. So they can eat and we can eat.\"\n\n\"Then let us do it,\" said Henry. \"Let us make the alliance, and show them our proposal.\"\n\nHenry looked at his men, then at the new speaker, and then at the zombies, who were standing in a line at the entrance of the room, watching them all.\n\n\"Yes, let us do it,\" said Henry. \"Let us form the alliance, and show the zombies that we are not a threat. Let us show them that we only want to survive. And let us show them that we will not be a threat to them. That we only want to be able to live with them, and that we will be eating only the dead. That we will be feeding on them, and they will be feeding on us.\"\n\n\"You don't really believe you can feed on the dead, do you?\" said his man.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Henry. \"We need their help. We need to make them see that we will only be eating the dead. That we will not be eating their kind. They can see that we are in need of their help. And we can give them what they want in return. We can give them the bodies of the dead, so they can feast on them.\"\n\n\"But it's not the same,\" said Henry's man. \"We can't eat the dead. We can't survive without the living.\"\n\n\"It is the only way,\" said the new speaker. \"The only way to survive.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Henry. \"The only way to survive. If we do not make the alliance, we will all be extinct. And they must be our last hope. And we must use them, and we must show them that we are not a threat. We must show them that we are only trying to survive. And we must make them see that we will not be a threat. That we will only be eating the dead, and that we will be feeding on them. That they will be feeding on us, and we will be feeding on them.\"\n\n\"We can't eat the dead,\" said his man.\n\n\"Then we will have to come up with another way,\" said Henry. \"A way to make them understand what we need, and that we need them. We must show them that we are only trying to survive, and that we will be eating only the dead. That we will be feeding on the dead, and they will be feeding on us.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said his man. \"Why are we making this alliance?\"\n\n\"Because we need their help,\" said Henry. \"We can't survive on our own. We can't feed on the dead. And we need them to be our last hope.\"\n\n\"But you can't eat the dead.\"\n\n\"Then we will have to come up with another way,\" said Henry. \"A way to make them understand what we need, and that we need them. We must show them that we are only trying to survive, and that we will be eating only the dead. That we will be feeding on the dead, and they will be feeding on us.\"\n\nHenry walked out of the room with his men, and the new speaker followed him. He walked to a door in the back of the room, and opened it, and then stepped aside, and revealed a large room filled with zombies, who were standing in a line and watching them. And then he stepped forward, and greeted them.\n\n\"Welcome, we have been waiting for you,\" said Henry"

It\u2019s a large, mutated, insectoid monstrosity, created to hunt down and eliminate all of humanity. The plan was brilliant, and the execution perfect. No one suspected a thing, as the virus spread, changing us all from the inside out. The only part of the plan that didn\u2019t work as intended was the part where we killed all the humans.\n\n\u201cHumans will bond with anything,\u201d you say again, \u201cso why do they resist our efforts to integrate with them?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to,\u201d you explain to the thing, \u201cit\u2019s just that they\u2019re too busy trying to survive.

You see excitement in its\u2019 eyes. You see hunger in its\u2019 eyes. The thing is no longer thinking about you, or the conversation that you\u2019re having. It\u2019s not thinking about the integration process, or the virus that you created. No, it\u2019s thinking about something else. Something else entirely. It\u2019s thinking about the humans. You see its\u2019 mouth move, but you don\u2019t hear the words. The thing is too far away for you to hear it. It\u2019s mouth is moving, and you see its\u2019 lips form words. You hear its\u2019 thoughts, and you can see the excitement building inside of it. It\u2019s thinking about its\u2019 prey, and it\u2019s going to get them, all of them. All of the humans that survive the virus, it\u2019s going to hunt them down and kill them. It\u2019s going to eat them, all of them. It\u2019s going to eat them all, then it\u2019s going to do it again. It\u2019s going to keep eating, until it\u2019s gone. You see something else in its\u2019 eyes, and you realize that this wasn\u2019t a plan. It was never a plan. This was just a natural thing. A natural thing to do. It just wanted to eat. It just wanted to kill. The thing doesn\u2019t just want to hunt the humans down. It wants to feast on them. It wants to kill them, then it wants to eat them.

You\u2019re a disappointment. It\u2019s time for you to move on.\u201d\n\n\u201cMove on?\u201d I repeated incredulously. \u201cWhere am I supposed to go? We\u2019ve been cut off from everyone outside. There\u2019s no one else to go to. How am I supposed to live?\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously,\u201d my mother snapped, \u201cyou can\u2019t. Not as a useless non-powerless person. I thought the worst part was over when you got married, but now you\u2019re having a child?\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t that count for anything?\u201d I demanded. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to see your grandchild?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re being selfish, Elara,\u201d she repeated. \u201cThis child isn\u2019t yours.

        "pred_story": "\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re going to be okay? It\u2019s really weird to have you live here.\u201d\n\nRachel frowned slightly, looking at me as I quickly changed into the outfit I had planned. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll be fine. Honestly, I don\u2019t want to be any more of a burden than I already am. So, I\u2019m good. I\u2019ll be out of here soon and you can have your room back.\u201d\n\nSighing, she looked around at the empty room. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re taking my room or anything. There\u2019s plenty of space here. Besides, I know your mom is going to freak out if you\u2019re not in a human dorm. If you\u2019re okay with it, I can ask if she can live here with me. She can have the room you\u2019re taking. I\u2019ll move into one of the rooms in the dorms with the other humans.\u201d\n\nI quickly scoffed, seeing a hint of a smile on her face. \u201cNo. Absolutely not. You know that would cause more problems than it solves. If she finds out I\u2019m living here, she\u2019ll make sure you get kicked out. And if you\u2019re okay with moving, then the decision is yours to make. Not mine. I\u2019m not going to ask you to do something that will be really difficult on you.\u201d\n\nShe looked back at me, clearly considering the offer. \u201cWhat would my mom do? Would she know if I moved here?\u201d\n\nI grimaced. \u201cMost likely. If anything, she would find out and be mad, then you and her would argue. There\u2019s a good chance she would find out you\u2019re here and the whole family would end up in a fight. I\u2019ve already caused enough drama this semester. I\u2019m going to take a chance and hope that you can stay here. If anything, I can stay here for a few days and then find another place, just so you can have your room back.\u201d\n\nLooking at her, I could see the hint of guilt on her face. \u201cI really can\u2019t thank you enough for this. I know it\u2019s been really weird this semester.\u201d\n\n\u201cBelieve me, it\u2019s not like I had a choice. If anything, this semester has been a weird experience. But it\u2019s been nice having you here. I think I\u2019m finally starting to get used to living in this dorm.\u201d I took one last look around the room, \u201cIt was really nice living here. Good luck and keep in touch. I hope you get through the semester okay.\u201d\n\nTaking one last look around the room, I turned and left. Rachel had already left, but I could hear her talking in the next room. Turning the corner, I caught sight of a man in the hallway. He was tall, easily six feet tall, and appeared to be in his mid-twenties. He was dressed in a black t-shirt and jeans, with his hair styled in a messy manner. Looking at me briefly, he smiled, \u201cHey, you\u2019re the human that\u2019s been living in Rachel\u2019s room, right?\u201d\n\nI nodded, not knowing what to say. He laughed, \u201cI know. She told me about you a bit ago. I was wondering if I could ask you a question.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, of course. I\u2019m happy to answer anything you ask.\u201d\n\nHis smile grew, \u201cCool. I wanted to know if you had any tips on how to handle people who think we are monsters. I think that might be part of the reason she was living in the room you\u2019re taking.\u201d\n\nI frowned, \u201cYou mean because I\u2019m human?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. So, what\u2019s the best way to deal with people who think they\u2019re better than you or that you\u2019re some kind of monster? I hate it when I have to deal with people like that.\u201d\n\nI frowned, \u201cThat\u2019s a weird question to ask me. I\u2019m just a regular human. What could I possibly know?\u201d\n\nHis smile grew wider, \u201cBelieve me, you know way more than you think you do. You\u2019re living in a monster dorm, you\u2019ve got to know something about us. I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nShaking my head, I sighed, \u201cYes, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m a bit more aware than I probably should be. But the thing is, most people who live here don\u2019t think of themselves as monsters. Some do, but most don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, \u201cYeah. I can understand that. I\u2019m the only one of my kind in my family. We don\u2019t really think of ourselves as monsters, either.\u201d\n\nWe stood there for a moment, not saying anything. Then, he asked, \u201cSo, what do you know about humans? How do you think we should handle people like that?\u201d\n\nI smiled, \u201cHonestly? I think the best way to handle them is with kindness and understanding. But if you think you need to be harsh, I don\u2019t blame you for that. We\u2019ve got our own stereotypes about monsters. The only difference is that we tend to think we\u2019re better than you. But if you think you need to show them we\u2019re not monsters, I\u2019d be happy to help you.\u201d\n\nHe smiled, \u201cI think I would be okay with that. If you\u2019re not too busy, I\u2019d love to go to the cafeteria with you later tonight. I haven\u2019t had a chance to eat any human food since I got here.\u201d\n\nI chuckled, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had plenty of human food. I\u2019m sure the food here is delicious. But yeah, that sounds fun. What do you say we meet up in the common room later tonight and have a chat about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds perfect. I\u2019ll see you later. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLikewise. See you soon.\u201d\n\nTurning, we both went in our respective directions, smiling to each other. As we did, I could feel a spark of electricity. It was clear, he had felt it too."

        "pred_story": "The adoption process was weird. But honestly, it was kind of fun. I\u2019d always thought about adopting a kid, but I was never really sure how to go about it. I didn\u2019t know how to pick a kid, how to get in touch with them, all that jazz. I guess that\u2019s why I ended up doing what everyone else does: I adopted a kid from the foster system.\n\nBut that was when I met them.\n\nI was sitting in a crowded waiting room. The other adopters were all staring at me. That was fine, I wasn\u2019t here for them. I was here for them. And, man, was it going to be a problem. I was only 32, so my little one wasn\u2019t exactly little. They were\u2026well, they were ten.\n\nBut I had always said that I wanted to adopt a kid around that age. And they were a good age. They were old enough to know how to behave, but still young enough to learn how to do everything. And, man, did they know how to do everything. I mean, they were literally *better* at everything than I was. It was kind of frustrating, but also kind of fun. And it was amazing seeing how well they adjusted.\n\nI was the third parent to arrive that day, and the third person to be adopted. They adopted the first kid and their mom, and then the couple next to me adopted a girl. And then it was just me, and then me and the little kid.\n\nThe little kid looked at me and smiled, and then turned away. The mother turned to me and smiled. \u201cI know my kid can be a little bit of a problem,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s a handful. But I think you two will be fine. I can see it in her eyes. She loves you already.\u201d\n\nI smiled, and then the woman and her partner left. I turned to the little kid and smiled. \u201cHey,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m your dad.\u201d She turned to me and smiled, and then looked down at her feet. \u201cHi,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m your daughter.\u201d\n\nI nodded, and then sat down on the chair. \u201cSo,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re quite the kid.\u201d She looked up at me and smiled, and then looked away. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI am.\u201d\n\nIt was nice to meet her. But at least she was a ten-year-old.\n\nThat was when I realized. I was only 32, and I had adopted a ten-year-old who was probably smarter than I was. So I started looking around for someone to teach me things. But the thing is, she was already learning them on her own. She was like a little sponge, and she was soaking up all the information around her. I had already forgotten how to do most things, but she remembered them all. And she was doing them all faster than me. I had to admit, it was kind of cool. She was basically a little superkid.\n\nBut still, I wanted to teach her. So I started looking around for her teacher. But she was already a teacher. She knew everything I knew, and more. And she was teaching me the things I didn\u2019t know. She was like my own personal teacher. But I couldn\u2019t have picked her better if I tried. She was the perfect kid.\n\nAnd I loved her.\n\nIt\u2019s funny. I never thought I would be a dad at 32. But now that it\u2019s happened, I\u2019m glad that I did. Sure, she\u2019s not like my friends\u2019 kids. She\u2019s not like most kids. But still, she\u2019s a great kid. She\u2019s a wonderful kid. And I\u2019m going to love her until my death. And she\u2019s going to learn all the things I know, and more. And she\u2019s going to be smarter than me, and all the kids in school. She\u2019s going to be a little superkid, and she\u2019s going to love me too."

        "pred_story": "\u201cAre you serious?\u201d The kid in the doorway stared, the words catching in the air between them, leaving behind only the faintest whisper of horror and disbelief.\n\n\u201cI am.\u201d My smile tightened. My teeth were still straight, but my eyes felt sharp. My skin felt thick, almost impenetrable. I had become so accustomed to the mask of humanity.\n\n\u201cMom?\u201d The girl by my side looked at me like I\u2019d lost my mind. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why is he freaking out?\u201d\n\nThe boy, tall and lanky, eyes wide and staring like he\u2019d just realized the sun had turned to stone, shuffled backward as I stood, my chair scraping against the wall. His eyes stayed fixed on me, and I could see his mind racing, trying to process. *It can\u2019t be. This can\u2019t be happening.*\n\nI sighed, feeling my humanity slipping, the way it always did in the face of fear and horror. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, honey. He doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nThe girl\u2019s eyebrows furrowed. She was so much like me, young, innocent. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he understand?\u201d She asked, her brow furrowing.\n\n\u201cLook, honey, I need you to go sit in your room and watch TV for a bit. I\u2019ll go talk to your dad.\u201d\n\nThe girl\u2019s face contorted in protest, but I grabbed her shoulder and spun her, giving her a gentle push toward her room. Her father\u2019s secret had been safe, kept well hidden from her, but now...\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain later, sweetie. Just go.\u201d I whispered.\n\nShe narrowed her eyes, but I could see the confusion and fear there, and I knew she would obey. As she left, the boy finally found his voice.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d I spun, but he didn\u2019t move. \u201cWait,\u201d he repeated, his voice barely above a whisper. \u201cYou can\u2019t be real.\u201d His words were laced with a desperation, an attempt to cling to reality. \u201cYou\u2019re my friend, you\u2019re-\u201c He cut himself off, his eyes darting to the girl\u2019s room as she locked her door. \u201cOh God,\u201d he muttered.\n\nI nodded. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019s found out.\u201d The realization was like a punch to the gut. *It can\u2019t be.*\n\nThe boy slowly took a step forward, his hand out, hesitant. \u201cIs that really you?\u201d He asked, his voice barely audible.\n\nI laughed, the sound thick, almost primal. \u201cWho am I?\u201d I asked, feeling the weight of my words, feeling the mask of humanity crack.\n\nHe shook his head. \u201cYou,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re a monster.\u201d\n\nI sighed, my eyes running with tears. \u201cI\u2019m your father,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The words burned, but they needed to be said. I looked down at my hands, feeling the shift, the transformation that had occurred. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I began to rise, and he didn\u2019t move. I didn\u2019t need to. I knew he would run.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d he said, and I could hear the pleading in his voice. \u201cTell me,\u201d he asked. \u201cTell me what happened to you. To us. To her.\u201d\n\nI paused. I hadn\u2019t thought about this part. \u201cI was once like you,\u201d I started. \u201cHumans thought I was a monster because of my appearance, because of my abilities.\u201d I could feel the shift happening within me, feel my body stretching, twisting, my senses amplifying. \u201cThe world didn\u2019t understand me, and I was tired of being feared and hated.\u201d I looked at my son. \u201cAnd then I saw you two,\u201d I said, my voice cracking. \u201cYou were so happy, so full of life, and I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of losing you. I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of being alone again.\u201d I smiled, feeling tears roll down my face. \u201cSo I made a choice. A choice to become like you.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike me?\u201d He repeated.\n\n\u201cYes, like you.\u201d I nodded, feeling the weight of the words. \u201cI can die.\u201d\n\nHis eyes widened, and I could see the realization wash over him. *It\u2019s not possible,* he thought. *There is no way.*\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he said, his voice shaking. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nI nodded again. \u201cI made a choice to sacrifice myself, to become human, so that I could be with you and your mother. I wanted to be a part of your life, to watch you grow. And it worked.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut...but you...\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whispered, feeling the tears fall harder now. \u201cI know that I shouldn\u2019t have kept this from you, but I wanted to be with you. I wanted to be your father.\u201d\n\nHis eyes dropped, and I knew he couldn\u2019t comprehend the sacrifice. He didn\u2019t know what it was to be a monster, to be hated and feared by the world. He didn\u2019t understand why I had made this choice, but I knew he would see that it was worth it. \u201cAnd what about her?\u201d He asked. \u201cShe\u2019s the only one who understands.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s my wife. She\u2019s the one who helped me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d he said, his voice quiet. \u201cWhat did you mean?\u201d He looked at me. \u201cWhen you said, *she\u2019s the only one who understands.*\u201d\n\nI took a deep breath. \u201cShe\u2019s like me. She\u2019s one of us.\u201d\n\nThe boy\u2019s face tightened. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\nI looked at him, seeing him for the first time. He was the only one I had left, and I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of losing him too. \u201cShe\u2019s a monster.\u201d\n\nThe silence that followed was deafening. He was in shock, his mind racing to comprehend this new information. \u201cI need to go talk to Mom.\u201d His voice was firm, almost hard. \u201cNow.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cGo,\u201d I said. I couldn\u2019t stop him. I didn\u2019t want to stop him. But I would never let him take her away from me again."

        "pred_story": "The group lay around our feet as they succumbed to their injuries.  They had fought hard, I could tell that.  Still, they were outmatched, no matter how hard they fought.  Their efforts had only made it worse for all of them, and now they laid at the base of the circle as the ritual completed.  I did not know what to feel, as I watched the ritual complete.  The summoning was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen, a storm of pure white and yellow light that seemed to dance around the group as they tried to stop it.  As soon as they fell, the light faded, and I looked around at the group.  They were gone, except for the circle.  It was an odd feeling, watching the ritual complete with no one there to stop it.  It was as if I had been watching someones else's story for months, and it had finally reached the end.  And as I looked around, trying to figure out what to do next, I noticed the sticky note on the ground.  It had a message written on it, in dark red ink.  \"Yeah, sorry guys. Apocalypse cancelled. Just not feeling it anymore.\"  I looked at the note, unsure of what to do with it.  It was a message from the dark god, I thought.  What was the message, though?  And why was it written on a sticky note?  Had he not realized that we were just a group of teenagers?  Were we really supposed to be the ones who would summon an apocalypse?  The world was ending, and no one had even told us about it.  And now that it had happened, no one had told us that it was cancelled either.  The whole thing was messed up.  And besides, who says no to an apocalypse?  Sure, the one that we had been trying to stop had been pretty bad, but who says no to something that would have given us more time to get things right?  And besides, a cancelled apocalypse was no apocalypse at all, not anymore.  It was just a waste of time and resources, a pointless end to something that we were ready to give up on.  And with no apocalypse, what would we have left?  All of the old ways, that no one believed in anymore?  No, the apocalypse was the only thing that we had left now.  It was our only hope, our only chance.  And now that it had been cancelled, I was left with no options.  What was I supposed to do now?  Wait around and hope that something better would come along?  Or should I just do my own thing, and make something better come along?  If that was the only way that anything good could happen, then so be it.  It was time for me to make my own way, my own destiny.  If no one else was going to, then I would do it myself.  I looked at the sticky note, as I stood up.  \"Yeah, sorry guys. Apocalypse cancelled. Just not feeling it anymore.\"  It was a message, not a command.  A reminder, not a threat.  An option, not a necessity.  I looked at the note again, and smiled.  The apocalypse may have been cancelled, but it was still an option.  And I had no problem with that."

        "pred_story": "\"It is the same old curse every year,\" a woman grumbled as she watched the man she was holding onto turn into a werewolf. \"You would think you would come up with a better curse than this.\" She said as she let out a sigh. \"If they knew you were doing this, you would be dead.\" She said as she placed her hands into her pants pocket.\n\nThe man she was holding onto was starting to struggle against her grip. His hands were turning into paws but they were still quite sharp. She knew this first hand as his last two attacks had shredded her pants. She was starting to think that she would have to take him to work like this. \"Shh, I am sorry but it is the best I could come up with,\" she whispered. She was starting to sound like a mother comforting her crying child.\n\nThe werewolf shook his head as he struggled against her grip. \"I was expecting something a little more creative,\" he growled. He was starting to lose control of himself. \"I mean come on, a werewolf transformation curse? How many times can a person go to the same place only to get bitten or clawed.\" He was starting to sound like a spoiled little boy. \"I mean think about it, I have gone to the same bar for the past four years and have gotten bitten every year. It is time for something new.\"\n\nThe woman shook her head. \"You don't know how hard it is to make a good curse. If I come up with a good curse and you tell the people who know you are cursed, you will be dead. And if you aren't dead, you could be maimed. This curse has been in the family for centuries and has served its purpose well,\" she said with a hint of pride in her voice. \"The people who live around here have grown accustomed to this curse. You can't expect them to change who they are to try and accommodate you.\"\n\nThe werewolf shook his head and growled. \"It is the same old curse every year. I turn into a werewolf, you turn into the black cat of doom, your sister turns into a pumpkin, your brother turns into a bat. The whole town turns into a bunch of goofy animals and monsters. There are no surprises.\" He shook his head again. \"Why couldn't you just change the curse every year. And don't try to tell me it is too hard. It can't be that hard to change the curse to something more creative.\"\n\nThe woman sighed and started to shake her head. \"Look, let me tell you something,\" she said. \"I am not some evil witch who is trying to cause harm to the townspeople. I am a member of this community and my curse has caused this town to thrive. It is the curse of Halloween night. I do this every year and it has been going well for centuries.\" She could feel the werewolf getting more agitated as she started her speech. \"Every year the townspeople work together and come up with a new and exciting idea to make the most of this curse. They have done it so many times that they have started to come up with new ideas every year. You aren't the only one who has had to live through this curse for many years. Every one of the townspeople is cursed and every one of us has to live with the same old curse every year.\"\n\nThe werewolf shook his head and snarled. \"I don't care. If this curse is going to be the same every year, then I need something to change it. You have the power to do so and I need you to change it.\" He shook his head as he took a step closer to her. \"So what do I have to do to get you to change this curse. Do I have to pay you?\" He sounded like a little boy who was asking his mother for some money for a new toy.\n\nThe woman shook her head and sighed. \"You know, I will take you to my house and cook you some dinner if you want. I am sure my sister will be happy to cook you up some of her pumpkin soup if you want.\" She knew he was trying to get something out of her and she wasn't going to give in to his demands. \"But you have to understand that the curse is for Halloween night only. You won't have to worry about it the rest of the year.\"\n\nThe werewolf nodded and turned into his human form. \"That sounds great. I would love to see your house and have some dinner.\" He nodded and then looked at the woman. \"And I would love to meet your sister,\" he said as he smiled.\n\nThe woman smiled and nodded. \"You will love my sister. She is very friendly and cooks well.\" She nodded and then looked around. \"But we can't go to my house right now. It is a little too crowded.\" She looked up at the sky and gasped as she realized how crowded the street was. \"It is Halloween night, isn't it?\" She looked at the werewolf who nodded. She looked at her pocket watch and realized that it was getting close to midnight. \"We can't go to my house now. It will be too crowded. We can go when things settle down.\" She looked up at the sky and saw people of all ages dressed in costume and running around. It was Halloween night and she knew that people would be going out and having fun until the morning.\n\nThe werewolf looked at her with a sad expression. \"I can't wait to see you again. I will be back tomorrow to visit your house and meet your sister.\" He smiled at her as he turned and ran into the crowd.\n\nThe woman watched him go and then smiled. \"I know he will come back,\" she said as she smiled and then started to walk back home."

        "pred_story": "The knock came three minutes shy of midnight. The only one home was Emily, and she was sound asleep on her bed, nose scrunched up against the window as if trying to make it smaller by sheer willpower.\n\nThe knock came again, louder. She felt a shiver run down her spine as the bedroom door opened, light from the hallway spilling into her room. For a second she forgot to breathe.\n\nHer mother entered, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. \"It's fine, Emily. That was just me. I forgot my keys and had to run down to the car and get them.\" She paused in the doorway, looking at her daughter. \"What are you doing awake?\"\n\nEmily gestured toward the window. \"I heard someone out there. I don't know why, but I just couldn't sleep.\"\n\nHer mother nodded sympathetically. \"Well, go back to sleep. It's probably just a stray animal or something.\"\n\nEmily nodded and settled back into her bed. Her mother paused in the doorway, looking at her for another second before continuing down the hallway.\n\nEmily waited until she heard the front door close. That was when she felt her phone buzz, an incoming call. She picked it up, her heart racing.\n\n\"No, no, no, no, no.\" She whispered, staring at the screen. A text from an unknown number. \"I don't know you, so don't know me.\"\n\nThe text had one message. \"We need to talk. Come outside now.\"\n\nShe hesitated for a moment, before tossing her phone aside and throwing on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. She felt like a kid again, sneaking out to meet up with her best friend and getting into mischief.\n\nShe made her way quietly down the stairs, glancing at the front door before making her way around the back of the house. Outside she stopped, looking up at the night sky. The stars were out, but she didn't see any constellations she knew. She shrugged and walked on, following the direction she had received from the text.\n\nThe street was empty, save for a few cars parked along the side. She felt a little nervous, but she had known better than to talk to strangers online, and she was sure she had the number blocked.\n\nShe stopped at the corner of the street and looked both ways. There was no one there. \"That's weird,\" she thought, turning to go back to her house. She saw a pair of shoes standing out from under a parked van.\n\n\"No, no, no, no, no,\" she muttered, her heart racing. She took a step back, then stopped. She heard footsteps behind her, soft footsteps. She froze, not daring to breathe.\n\n\"Emily. Thank you for coming. I know you didn't expect this, but we need you.\"\n\nShe turned, looking at the person speaking. A woman with a large purse, sunglasses, and a suit.\n\n\"What do you need me for?\" She felt her back hit something metal, and she realized she was pressed against the side of a van.\n\n\"I'll tell you everything you need to know when we get where we're going.\"\n\nShe tried to push away, but the van's side door slid open.\n\n\"Get in, and don't make a scene.\"\n\nEmily hesitated. She felt a tap on her shoulder, and she turned to see a man in a suit. He gestured to the van, and she got in.\n\n\"Where are we going?\"\n\n\"Not far. You'll be home by tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow morning?\"\n\nThe woman behind the wheel nodded. \"Yes. You'll have a new job, and you'll be paid to work on it.\"\n\nEmily felt her stomach twist, unsure what to do. \"I don't understand,\" she said.\n\nThe man in the passenger seat turned to her. \"You're being drafted.\"\n\nShe paused, unsure what to say. \"Drafted for what?\"\n\nThe man smirked. \"You know better than that, Emily. You're a magical girl.\"\n\nShe paused, unsure what to say. \"I'm a what now?\"\n\nThe van stopped in the middle of the street, and the woman turned to her. \"A magical girl. It's a long story. We'll get to all of it, but first, you need to sign some papers.\"\n\nThe woman tossed a stack of documents into her lap, and she felt overwhelmed.\n\n\"I need a minute,\" she said, picking up the first page and starting to read it. It was a contract. \"What is this?\" She looked at the woman, who held out a pen.\n\n\"It's an oath of office. You need to sign it to accept your position as a magical girl.\"\n\nEmily felt like she was dreaming. \"I'm a magical girl.\" She shook her head, feeling like she was about to fall out of her seat.\n\n\"You're a magical girl,\" the man repeated, a smile on his face. \"You have a magical girl inside you. That's why you received the text.\"\n\nEmily was starting to feel like she was in a dream. \"Who sent the text?\" she asked, pointing at the phone in her lap.\n\n\"That was me,\" the man said, holding out his hand. \"I'm Agent Thompson. I'm your handler.\"\n\nEmily took his hand, feeling like she was floating above her body. \"What's my magical girl name?\" she asked, looking at the woman, who was driving again.\n\n\"That's going to be a surprise,\" she replied, \"but I think we should get you home first.\"\n\nEmily nodded, still feeling like she was floating. \"My name is Emily. I'm a magical girl.\" She repeated the phrase over and over, feeling like she was in a trance. As soon as she got home, she knew that her life was going to change forever."

I mean, I've been missing for three days now and yet no one seems to have noticed. I read the names of the missing kids and read through their ages. I was so used to being 14 that seeing the word \"missing\" next to my age shocked me. It didn't feel real.\n\n\"Hey,\" my mother started, her voice sounding a little more serious, \"you know you're missing, right?\"\n\nI nodded. \"Yeah, of course.\"\n\nI could hear my mother sighing, her feet shuffling slightly as she moved closer to me. \"I... I know this might be awkward to ask, but... are you okay? You've been acting... weird since you... you know.\"\n\nShe didn't need to finish her question as I knew what she was talking about. \"I... I think so, mum. I mean, I'm not exactly missing, I'm just in the same year as everyone else. I don't know, it just feels weird talking about it.\"\n\n\"I understand, sweetie, I do.

Don't make any trouble or we'll be in trouble too.\"\n\nI nodded my head at her, \"Okay.\"\n\nI could see her glance over at my father, who had been quietly reading the news, but was now staring at us. \"Alright, let's get you to school now. Don't forget your book bag.\"\n\nI got up from the table and started to head to my room, \"I'm just gonna put my stuff away first, okay? I'll be down in two minutes.\"\n\n\"Sure, take your time, sweetie,\" she replied, her voice dripping with annoyance as she walked back to her room.\n\nI put away my school stuff and quickly changed into the outfit that I would wear, before running back downstairs and grabbing my lunch and water.\n\n\"Bye, mum,\" I said, waving at her as I left the house.\n\n\"Bye, baby,\" she replied, her eyes already focusing on her phone.\n\nI could feel the anxiety as I walked to school, my mind racing a million miles an hour as I tried to figure out what was happening. I could see the looks of my classmates as they stared at me, confusion written all over their faces.\n\n\"Hey,\" I heard a voice whispering in my ear. I turned to see my best friend Emily staring at me, her eyes filled with confusion.\n\n\"I'm... I'm sorry, I don't know what's going on,\" I confessed.\n\n\"Me neither, but I'm glad to see that you're fine,\" she said, her voice filled with relief. \"I was worried that something happened to you.\"\n\nI chuckled. \"Oh, nothing like that, I'm just... time traveling, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Time... traveling?\"\n\nI nodded. \"Yeah, I don't know how it happened, but I woke up one day to find out that I was back in the past, but now I'm back here. I'm confused.\"\n\nEmily frowned, her eyes narrowing in thought. \"Let's try and figure this out together, alright?\"\n\nI smiled, grateful for her support. \"Sure.\"\n\nWe quickly found a spot where no one was looking at us and I pulled out the newspaper. I pointed to the missing kids page, my finger stopping at my name. Emily looked over at the paper and quickly read the article.\n\n\"Hey, I know this kid,\" she whispered. \"She's my cousin.\"\n\nI was shocked, but I quickly recovered myself. \"Oh, really? What's her name?\"\n\nEmily frowned, her eyes squinting in thought. \"Um... let me think,\" she muttered, before pointing at the article, \"that's your name, but it's not exactly a rare name. I'm not sure if this is my cousin.\"\n\n\"Wait, how old is your cousin?\" I asked, my eyes scanning the article, quickly finding the date that my family was missing.\n\n\"Uh, 13... or 14?\" Emily replied, her voice filled with doubt.\n\nI was quick to grab her arm. \"She was missing because of some kidnappers, but we were found just 5 days later. But if you're 13 now, then that means...\"\n\nI could see Emily's eyes widen in shock, her voice trembling. \"That means... that she died?\"\n\nI nodded my head, feeling a chill run down my spine. I could see the confusion in Emily's eyes, her face filled with shock and fear.\n\n\"But... but you're her,\" Emily stuttered, her voice barely audible. \"I don't understand.\"\n\nI could feel my face going white, my body shaking in shock. \"What... what are you talking about?\" I asked, my voice shaking as I stared at Emily, but she just looked back at me with her eyes filled with tears.\n\n\"Emily, no,\" I heard my mother screaming, her voice filled with panic.\n\nI turned to see her running towards us, her eyes filled with worry. \"Emily, no,\" she shouted again, her body crashing into Emily's.\n\n\"Mother, what's going on?\" I asked, my voice filled with confusion, but my mother didn't seem to answer me, her body shaking as she tried to hold back her tears.\n\nEmily's eyes looked over at me, her face filled with shock. \"I'm... I'm sorry, I don't understand.\" She muttered, before grabbing her school bag and running off.\n\n\"What's going on?\" I asked, my voice filled with frustration, but my mother just shook her head.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sweetie. I don't understand it either.\" She said, her body still shaking as she tried to hold back her tears."

        "pred_story": "\"You said to protect her. And that's exactly what I did.\"\n\nMackenzie's eyes snapped to meet his. \"By turning her into a bloody assassin?\"\n\nThe old man shrugged. \"She wasn't a very nice girl. She was a killer. You killed someone to escape from prison. You even tried to kill your boss.\"\n\n\"I was in danger.\" Her voice was steady, but Mackenzie could see the tension in her jaw.\n\n\"Of course you were. And I helped her in the only way I knew how.\"\n\n\"You helped her become a killer.\"\n\n\"She was already a killer. You had a gift for it. I honed that gift into an art form.\"\n\n\"You didn't need to hone it. You could have stopped her.\"\n\nHe waved a dismissive hand. \"If I had stopped her, she'd be dead by now. Or worse. I kept her alive, and I gave her a purpose in life.\"\n\n\"A purpose to kill people?\"\n\nHe sighed. \"Look, Mackenzie. I know this isn't easy to hear. But I think you need to know the truth. You've been living in denial for years, and it's time to face reality. You don't need to be a killer anymore. You can live a normal life.\"\n\n\"I don't want a normal life.\"\n\n\"What do you want, then? Another prison sentence? You want to be locked up again? You want to die?\"\n\n\"I want to be with her.\"\n\nHe snorted. \"You want to be with someone who's still in prison.\"\n\n\"That's not fair. She's not like that anymore. She's changed. She's a different person now.\"\n\n\"A different person? You mean a different killer?\"\n\nShe stepped forward. \"No. I mean a different person. One who knows what she wants. One who knows what she needs. And what she needs is me.\"\n\n\"You've been brainwashed, Mackenzie. You've been brainwashed into believing that you need her. But you don't. You need to be free.\"\n\n\"I am free.\"\n\n\"No, you're not.\" He turned away from her. \"You were never free.\"\n\n\"I was free to do what I wanted. I was free to live my life however I wanted.\"\n\n\"No, you weren't. You were trapped. You were trapped by the choices you made. You were trapped by the life you led. But I freed you from all that. I freed you from your prison sentence. I freed you from your past.\"\n\n\"You imprisoned me in your own way.\"\n\n\"Only to set you free. Only to help you find yourself.\"\n\n\"I was happy. I was happy in prison.\"\n\nHe spun around. \"You think you were happy? Happy? Do you know what it means to be happy?\"\n\n\"I know what it means to be alive.\"\n\nHe stared at her. \"And I'm alive too. But I'm still a killer. And I'm still alone.\"\n\n\"Why do you want to hurt me? You've helped me. You've helped me so much.\"\n\n\"Because I don't want to lose you. Because I don't want to lose what we had.\"\n\n\"You said you would keep me safe.\"\n\n\"I will. I will keep you safe. But you need to stay away from her.\"\n\n\"You don't understand. You don't know what we've been through. You don't know how much we need each other.\"\n\n\"We need each other? What do we need each other for?\"\n\n\"For everything. We need each other for everything.\"\n\n\"But I'm the one who needs you. I need you more than I've ever needed anyone in my life.\"\n\n\"We need each other, Mackenzie. We need each other.\"\n\n\"But I don't need you anymore.\" She turned and left him there, alone. \"I need her.\"\n\nThe old man closed his eyes. He felt his body sag. His shoulders slumped. He felt his heart break. He knew he'd lost her. He knew he'd lost her forever.\n\nBut he didn't let it show. He didn't let anyone see his pain. He kept his smile on. He kept his eyes open. And he kept his heart beating. \n\nBut he couldn't shake the feeling. The feeling that he'd lost everything. The feeling that he'd lost his purpose in life. And the feeling that he'd lost the only person he ever truly cared for.\n\n\"Hello, Mackenzie.\" Her voice was soft. But it was the sweetest sound he'd ever heard.\n\n\"Hello.\" He smiled. He smiled back at her. \"It's been a while.\"\n\n\"Yes, it has. Are you ready to go home?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm ready.\"\n\n\"Good.\" She smiled back at him. \"I'll see you there.\"\n\nShe walked away. And he watched her. He watched her walk away. He watched her disappear from view. And he smiled.\n\n\"Hello, Mackenzie.\" She was in the doorway. He was sitting on the couch. They were back at his place again.\n\n\"Hello.\" Her voice was soft. But it was the sweetest sound he'd ever heard.\n\n\"You're looking good, Mackenzie. You're looking great.\"\n\n\"Thanks. How about you? You look a bit tired.\"\n\n\"Maybe a bit.\" He smiled. \"But I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm good.\"\n\n\"I know.\" She smiled. \"I know. I just wanted to check on you.\"\n\n\"You don't need to check on me.\"\n\n\"I want to. I want to be here for you. I want to make sure you're happy. I want to make sure you're safe.\"\n\n\"I know. And I want the same for you. I want to be there for you.\"\n\n\"I know. And I want the same for you.\"\n\n\"Okay, then.\" He smiled. \"Let's do it.\"\n\n\"Let's what?\"\n\n\"Let's live our lives together. Let's be happy together. Let's live together.\"\n\nShe nodded. She smiled. And she went to him. She went to him. She leaned in to him. She kissed him.\n\nAnd he knew they were meant to be together. They were meant to be happy together."

But don't say I didn't warn you.\"\n\nShe got out of the car and walked up to the front door, opening it and waiting for him to answer. \"I know you're home, because I can hear the TV. So I know you're watching my kids right now, which means you need to answer this door. I don't care if you're having an affair with my best friend, but I care that you're here with my kids.\"\n\nShe heard the TV stop, and then he appeared in front of her. \"Amanda, I was just watching TV with the kids.\"\n\n\"So what? That means you're not going to answer the door? That means you're not going to spend any time with my children?\"\n\n\"Okay, okay. I'll open the door. But please, just be calm about it. I know this situation is upsetting for you, but I want to make things work with you. I love you.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"I love you too, but I have to see this through. Now open the door.\"\n\nShe walked into his house, and looked over at her children who were playing on the floor, laughing at some TV show. \"You're spending time with my children. That means we're working on things.\"\n\nHe looked over at her, and then back at the children. \"You can't really expect me to just forget everything, and spend time with you and the kids.\"\n\n\"Yes, I can. I need you to. I need to know that you love me, and the kids. I want to know that you're willing to work through this with me.\"\n\nHe sighed, and looked over at the children. \"Okay, sure. I'm working through this. But you can't expect me to forget everything. Can't you just move on?\"\n\n\"No. You dumped me, so I don't think I can move on that easily.\"\n\nHe sighed, and walked over to her, grabbing her hand and pulling her into a hug. \"Okay, Amanda. I understand. I was a jerk, but I want to make things right between us. I love you.\"\n\nShe felt a pang in her heart, and knew that she was in trouble. \"I love you too,\" she whispered, and knew that she was just a goner. She felt like she was floating on a cloud, floating in a sea of love. She knew that she had to be careful, but she couldn't resist.\n\n\"I want to spend the rest of my life with you, Amanda. Will you marry me?\"\n\nShe gasped, and looked up at him. \"But I'm just your mistress.\"\n\n\"I don't care. I don't care if you're my mistress or my wife. I just want to spend the rest of my life with you. But I know that you want something more.\"\n\nShe thought about it, and then nodded. \"Okay. I'll marry you.\"\n\nHe smiled, and pulled her into a kiss. \"Thank you,\" he whispered, and she smiled, and hugged him back. She knew that they would spend the rest of their lives together, in this crazy dance of love.\n\nAs she was marrying her husband, she knew that she would never be able to do it without her husband. But there was a catch, since she only had a wish. So she had to make do with what she had.\n\nShe decided that since she only had one wish, that she could try and do the best she could with the wish. \"I wish for eternal love,\" she whispered, closing her eyes.\n\n\"Very well, my dear,\" the being said, disappearing into a puff of smoke.\n\n\"What just happened?\" Amanda asked, opening her eyes.\n\n\"I gave you the eternal love that you wished for. I will be with you every step of the way, making sure that you never experience the horrors that love can bring. But I must warn you, my love, I will be a bit clingy.\"\n\n\"Clingsy?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, you will never be able to do anything without me. I will be the one who takes care of everything, making sure that you have everything you need. So are you prepared to handle the situation?\"\n\nAmanda nodded. \"Of course, I would never leave my husband's side.\"\n\nHe sighed, and rubbed his temples. \"Okay, but don't say I didn't warn you.\"\n\nAs they settled into their new life, Amanda was constantly plagued with visions of her husband cheating on her. But it was just her imagination.\n\nHe was never actually with anyone else, but she was constantly haunted by the thought. And she knew that she was never going to be able to shake it, no matter how much she wanted to. She just had to accept the fact that she was never going to be able to do anything without her husband.\n\n\"I love you,\" she whispered, and he smiled, and hugged her back. \"I love you too, my dear.\"\n\nYears passed, and Amanda was still plagued by visions of her husband cheating on her. And every time, she would try and talk to him about it, but he would just tell her that she was being paranoid.\n\nShe knew that it was irrational, but she couldn't shake the feeling. It was as if someone was always watching her, and she knew that it was her husband's imagination that was haunting her. She tried to move on, but she couldn't seem to let go of the fear.\n\nThen one day, she found herself in a coffee shop, staring at a guy who looked exactly like her husband. She froze, and couldn't move, as if she was paralyzed. She couldn't take her eyes off him, and couldn't look away. She couldn't seem to shake the feeling that he was her husband, no matter how many times she told herself that he wasn't.\n\nShe was in shock, and couldn't move. She knew that she was staring at a stranger, but she couldn't help but think that he was her husband. She was paralyzed with fear, and couldn't move, unable to take her"

But your court mage offers you two options: drink a potion to turn back time or walk the path of a lonely monarch, destined to fight battles until the end.\tLength: 595 words<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
        "pred_story": "\"Your majesty!\" A knight in front of me gasped, blood pouring out of his side, \"The black knights have come! Your enemy has breached our walls!\"\n\nI sighed and turned to face the castle gates, \"How many?\" I asked, already knowing the answer. They would all be here, every enemy, every vulture who wanted to pick at the bones of my kingdom. And I would face them, alone. Because, if we all die, my kingdom will be taken over by the enemies. And I would rather die than let them take over.\n\nMy court mage, standing behind me, coughed, \"Your majesty, I have something to say.\" I turned around and saw him wiping away a tear, \"I have made a potion of time travel. I think you should drink it.\"\n\nI scoffed, \"Why? What will it do? Return me to before all this?\" I gestured towards the carnage around me, \"Before this kingdom collapsed? I'm not stupid. Even if the kingdom hadn't fallen, my enemies would have caught up with me. And I would not be able to win this fight.\"\n\nHe nodded, tears welling up in his eyes, \"Then I have nothing to say.\"\n\nI sighed, \"I understand.\" I didn't know what to say to him. I couldn't blame him for wanting me to live. Any king would want their king to live.\n\n\"Your majesty, I am sorry.\" He said, his voice cracking, \"I know that you would have been a great king. But, if you are dead, my position will be useless.\"\n\nI chuckled, \"So, you think that this is only about you?\"\n\nHe nodded, tears flowing down his face, \"Yes, my majesty. If you are dead, I would have no use. I would either be a traitor if I ruled, or a lowly mage, unable to do anything.\"\n\nI sighed, \"I understand.\" I could have forced him to drink the potion too, but I didn't want him to lose everything he had worked for. This kingdom had nothing left to offer, and I wasn't going to let any of my people die on my behalf.\n\nI turned around, \"Get away from me!\" I shouted at the remaining soldiers. \"I will handle everything!\"\n\nThey didn't need to be told. They all knew why they were here. I turned back to my mage, \"Are you ready?\"\n\nHe nodded and handed me the vial.\n\nI swallowed it and, in an instant, I was back in my old days, training as a knight. But now, I was no longer a knight. I was the king. My kingdom was still in its early days, and the kingdom was full of enemies. They all wanted to take down my kingdom, and I had to make sure that I won.\n\nI didn't remember the next few days. I was too busy fighting and winning. But in a few months, I had already defeated all the enemies around me, and I was starting to build a strong and loyal army. I was no longer the weak and powerless king that I was before.\n\nBut then, my kingdom collapsed. The enemies had become too strong for me, and I had to fight them alone. And, in the end, I died. The kingdom was destroyed and my people were killed.\n\nBut I knew that I had done my best. I fought with everything I had, even when I knew that I couldn't win. I fought for my people, and my people fought for me. And in the end, I fought until the very last breath in my body.\n\nBut, then, I was back in the throne room, blood pouring out of my chest. And my mage stood in front of me, tears in his eyes, \"I'm so sorry, my majesty.\" He said, \"I couldn't stop this from happening.\" He took my hand and held it, \"I couldn't save you.\"\n\nI smiled, \"Thank you.\" I said, \"Thank you for being here for me.\" He smiled and nodded, tears flowing down his face. And in that moment, I realized that there was no need for a heroic ending. This was the only way for me to go."

The beeping monitor she\u2019s watching is steady, the heart rate normal.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m alive. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m even me anymore. I think about all of the times I\u2019ve had near death experiences, how I\u2019ve died in alternate universes. The last one was my own, my own demise. This time, I remember.\n\nI think about the last time I died. I was 27 years old. It had been 3 months since I graduated from college. I was living with my parents and working at a job I hated. I worked in the tech industry, but I wasn\u2019t a programmer or developer. I was an auditor. I\u2019m not sure how I ended up doing that. It\u2019s a good job, one that I should be proud of. But I hated it. I hated the routine, the monotony, the lack of creativity and intellectual challenge.\n\nI died 10 years after that. I was 37 when I died of old age. I was living alone, with just my pets for companionship. I had a wife, but she had died 5 years before. We were married for 35 years, and while I loved her, I\u2019m not sure if I was ever in love with her. I had a son, but he had died 20 years before. I didn\u2019t think that he would ever get married or have kids of his own, but he did. He was my first grandchild, and I was proud of him. My daughter was a scientist, a biologist, and was working to cure cancer. I was proud of her too. I had always been a proud parent.\n\nI think about the 23 years I spent between my two deaths. I was always happy, never truly sad. I wasn\u2019t in love with anyone, but I was never lonely. I had always been a social person, but I was never desperate to be in a relationship. I had my own hobbies and interests. I learned new languages. I practiced yoga. I read a lot of books. I worked on my writing skills.\n\nI think about all of the things that I wish I had done in my first life. I wish I had taken more risks. I wish I had followed my dreams. I wish I had been more spontaneous. I wish I had traveled more. I wish I had fallen in love.\n\nI think about how I might be able to do that in my second life.\n\n\u201cHello? Are you awake?\u201d the nurse asks, snapping me out of my reverie.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, \u201cI\u2019m awake. I\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great to hear,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get the doctor.\u201d\n\nShe leaves my room and returns with a young man in a white coat.\n\n\u201cHello, you were in an accident?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, \u201cI was shot.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m here to help you.\u201d\n\nHe starts to examine me, checking my pulse, my breathing, my reflexes.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s your pain level?\u201d\n\nI think about how I feel. I was shot, but I\u2019m not in pain.\n\n\u201cZero,\u201d I say.\n\nHe looks at the monitor behind me, then at me. \u201cYou\u2019re one lucky man,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should be dead.\u201d\n\nI nod.\n\n\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d he asks.\n\nI think about that. I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m just trying to get better.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Dr. Patel,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a neurosurgeon.\u201d\n\nHe smiles. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the luckiest men in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going to take care of you now. Don\u2019t worry about anything, okay?\u201d\n\nI nod.\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d he says, \u201cnow let\u2019s get you better.\u201d"

There was a single chair in the center of the room, the same color as everything else, and there were two small buttons on the wall near the light bulb.\n\n\"You are the first person to ever survive the experiment,\" said the man on the intercom. \"The technology is still in its infancy, but you will never age. You will never fall ill. The only thing you need to do is to never leave this room.\"\n\n\"Never leave this room?\"\n\n\"Yes. We will provide all of your needs within this room, but you are never to leave it. The door will be sealed shut, and the airlock will be sealed behind you. You will never be able to leave this room. But you will be able to live a long time, perhaps centuries.\"\n\nI looked at the man in the chair. He was still talking.\n\n\"Are you listening?\" he asked. I was confused, and my head spun.\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered. \"But what about the other people?\"\n\n\"What other people?\"\n\nThe man on the intercom chuckled. \"Are you forgetting what you are?\" he asked. \"You are a clone. All of the others are gone. You are a copy of them, and they are all gone.\"\n\nI knew that I had been created for the experiment. I knew that I was a clone, but I didn't know that I was the only one. I thought that I was a copy of someone else, but I had never seen them.\n\n\"So what you're saying is that I can live forever... if I never leave this room again?\" I asked.\n\nThe man on the intercom laughed, and then laughed again. He was laughing so hard that I could hear him even though there was no intercom.\n\n\"Yes, that's what I'm saying,\" he said. He laughed again, and then stopped. \"But you must never leave this room. You can't let us in.\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked. \"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because you are one of them,\" he said. \"I'm not saying that in a good way. They are the enemy, and you are the enemy too.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" I asked. \"I am one of us.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" he said. \"They are the enemy. You are the enemy. But you are the only one who knows it.\"\n\n\"You're not making any sense,\" I said.\n\n\"The only thing that you need to do is to stay in this room,\" he said. \"Don't let anyone else in.\"\n\nI didn't know what to think. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what the man was saying. I just knew that I didn't want to stay in the room anymore. I wanted to leave.\n\n\"I don't want to stay here,\" I said. \"Can I go?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the man on the intercom. \"You can't leave. I can't let you leave.\"\n\n\"You can't stop me,\" I said.\n\nI stood up and walked over to the door. I was about to open it, but I heard the sound of air rushing out. The door opened, and I could see a woman walking outside. I saw her talking to a man, but I couldn't hear what they were saying.\n\nI walked out into the hallway. The woman was standing there, looking at me.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" I asked her.\n\n\"You're the experiment, aren't you?\" she asked. \"The person who survived.\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" she said. \"I'm so sorry that we had to do this to you.\"\n\nI looked at her and saw my face staring back. \"I don't understand,\" I said. \"Why did you do this?\"\n\n\"We needed you to be immortal,\" she said. \"And you are the only one who will live on.\"\n\n\"I don't want to live on like this,\" I said.\n\n\"You can't stop living,\" she said. \"Even when you're dead, you're still alive.\"\n\nI looked at her. I looked at myself. I didn't know who I was anymore. I didn't know who she was either. All I knew was that I didn't want to stay in that room. I didn't want to be immortal."

They were standing next to each other and they were both smiling. They were both looking at me and I could see the happiness in their eyes.\n\nThe photo was taken recently, I could tell that. It was a bright sunny day and the men were both wearing shorts and t-shirts. They were both wearing sunglasses and they were both smiling.\n\nThe photo was on a piece of paper that was the size of a postcard and it was neatly folded in half.

So, yeah, thanks and no thanks.\" He was smiling again.\n\nI reached into my pocket and I pulled out the photo and I held it up. \"Do you recognize this man?\" I said.\n\nHe stopped and he looked at the photo. He was looking at it very closely, almost as though he was looking at it through a microscope. He looked up at me and he had a look of absolute confusion on his face.\n\n\"Are you serious?\" He said. \"I know him. He's a man I've worked with.\"\n\n\"And who is he?\" I said.\n\n\"He's a man I've worked with,\" he said. \"I don't know, but he's a man I've worked with.

        "pred_story": "\"Mom, I'm going to be moving in with Grandpa. He's sick, and Dad is going to be away on a project.\"\n\nMy mother and father were in their late 40's by this time, but that was the last time I saw them for a while. They were in some sort of conference or meeting, and I don't remember exactly what it was about. Anyway, my mother left me a note and a small bag with some food and water. It was a few days before the summer solstice, and the sun was still going down at around 10:15 PM. I had a few hours before I would have to leave the house.\n\nWhile I was getting my bag, I saw my grandfather sitting in his wheelchair. He was staring at the clock on the wall. It was 10:25 PM. He gave a little sigh, and then looked at me. He had been like this since the stroke he had when I was a kid. He was unable to talk, but I could hear him thinking. Not exactly, but I could hear his thoughts. It was a strange ability, but it was also a curse.\n\n\"Grandpa, what are you planning on doing?\" I asked. He didn't respond.\n\nI walked up to him, and put my bag down at the table. I picked up a few things, and put them in a backpack. \"I'll be right back. I don't know when I'll be home again.\"\n\nHe looked up at me, and gave me a small smile. I put a hand on his shoulder. \"It's going to be okay. You're going to be alone for a little while, but that's okay. I'll be back home soon.\"\n\nI turned and ran out the door. I could hear his thoughts again. \"I'll be back. You know what I'm going to do, don't you?\"\n\nI didn't respond. I didn't want to respond. I wanted to run away from this feeling in my stomach. I didn't want to think about the fact that he would be all alone for the next year. I wanted to ignore the fact that he was thinking about hurting himself.\n\nI ran to my room, and started packing. I grabbed my school books, and a few clothes. I stuffed them in my bag, and ran to the kitchen. I grabbed a bottle of water, and a few energy bars. I was almost ready.\n\nI ran out the door, and started to run. I didn't look back, I didn't want to see what was happening. I knew that Grandpa was going to be okay. He was in a nursing home, and there were plenty of staff there. He would be safe. \n\n\"Grandpa, stop that!\"\n\nHe was doing something with the clock on the wall. Something with the clock and the wall. \"Grandpa, stop that! Please, I don't want to see you get hurt!\"\n\nHis thoughts again. \"You know what I'm going to do. You know, don't you? You know, why I'm going to do it.\"\n\n\"Grandpa, I don't know what you are going to do! But I don't want you to get hurt. Please, stop that!\"\n\nI heard a faint thud, and I stopped running. I heard a faint scream. I ran in the direction of the scream, and I saw what had happened. I saw what Grandpa had done.\n\nHis wheelchair was on the wall, and he had fallen back onto the floor. There was a faint pool of blood under him. He was unconscious.\n\nI fell to my knees, and I could hear his thoughts again. \"Finally, let's get started. You should have been here sooner.\"\n\nI could hear his thoughts again. \"You didn't want to let's get started earlier?\"\n\n\"Are you okay, Grandpa? Are you going to be okay?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm fine. It's been a long time since I've been like this. A long time. Let's get started.\""

I wanted to be with those that I loved, and I wanted to go out in peace.\n\nBut the world was going to end, and that was just something I had to face. And that was what I had been doing for the past couple of months. I had been doing everything I could to prevent the end of the world, but everything I had tried had failed. I had tried talking to the people in the government, I had tried talking to the villain, I had tried using my powers, but everything had failed.\n\nThe villain had gotten stronger, the government was no use, and my powers were limited. I had used everything I knew, and I still had failed. So, I had tried something different. I had tried finding a way to cheat the end of the world. And that is where I had found myself, standing in front of the building that the villain was inside.\n\nI stood in front of it, looking at the building. It was the most advanced building in the world, and it was the building where the villain was hiding. He had taken over the world, and was currently watching the end of the world. But I had found him. I had found the place where he was hiding, and I was going to do everything I could to take him down. But I was also ready for the end of the world. I had come to accept it.\n\nThat was the problem. I was going to the end of the world, and I was okay with it. I was prepared for it. I had taken everything that I could, and I had given up everything else. I had found a new purpose, a new sense of peace, and I was ready for the end of the world.

All I knew was that I had to protect my daughter, to ensure her safety and well-being. I thought that your daughter could help me do that, but I was wrong. I made a mistake.\u201d\n\nI narrowed my eyes at the Queen. \u201cAnd what of my daughter? Did you love her? Did you care for her?\u201d\n\nThe Queen nodded. \u201cI love her.

You are cruel.\u201d\n\nThe Queen looked at me angrily. \u201cI would do anything to protect her, but I am not cruel. I love her.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove?\u201d I spat. \u201cYou call that love? You call leaving her to be torn from her only home love? You call it love when you know she will be forced to live as a prisoner for the rest of her life? I call it cruelty, and I will make you pay for it.\u201d\n\nThe Queen laughed. \u201cYou are cruel, too. You call it retribution when you slaughter the innocent? You call it vengeance when you harm the weak? I call it cruelty, and I will make you pay for it.\u201d\n\nI laughed. \u201cI am not cruel. I am simply just. I am simply taking what is rightfully mine. I am taking vengeance for what you have done.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen take vengeance on me,\u201d the Queen said. \u201cTake it on me, because I am the one who made the decision. Take it on me, because I am the one who was cruel.\u201d\n\nI laughed again. \u201cAnd what of my daughter? What of her fate? You expect me to leave her here, while I take vengeance on you?\u201d\n\nThe Queen nodded. \u201cI expect you to. I expect you to leave her here, to take vengeance on me. I expect you to save your daughter.\u201d\n\nI narrowed my eyes at the Queen. \u201cIf I do this,\u201d I said, \u201cyou must swear on your daughter\u2019s life that you will never again take her from me. You must swear that she will never again be taken from me. You must swear that she will always be safe.\u201d\n\nThe Queen nodded. \u201cI swear it. I swear that she will always be safe. I swear that she will never again be taken from you.\u201d\n\nI laughed. \u201cAnd what of your minions?\u201d I asked. \u201cThey were cruel to my daughter. They were cruel to me.

        "pred_story": "The walls crumbled, the floors broke, and the streets were strewn with debris. Buildings were broken and broken in half, and all around, the city was in ruin. In the midst of this destruction, a store stood untouched. It\u2019s large screen was lit up in a broadcast that looked like any other. A group of politicians were arguing over the country\u2019s latest budget bill, pointing fingers at each other.\n\nThe street was empty, there were no signs of bodies, no signs of dead. The only sound was the wind rustling through the broken glass and the voices of the politicians. I watched for a while, my stomach empty and my bones aching from the long day of scavenging. I had to find food, but I couldn\u2019t move. My leg was broken, my arm was injured, and there was no chance of me making it back to the campsite. But it was the broadcast that kept me sitting there.\n\nThe country was thriving, there was no war, no famine, no natural disasters. People were happy, they were living their lives like normal. It was a strange sight. The politicians were arguing, but they were also laughing. They were smiling, and it was clear that they were not going to actually do anything. It was just another meeting. It was just another show.\n\nThe broadcast ended, and suddenly, the screen was covered in a game. A game I knew. A game that was popular among the pre-zombie folk, and one I had played before. I moved, and suddenly, the screen was in front of me, as if I was playing it. The controller was in my hands, and suddenly, I was there, in the world of the game.\n\nIt was a strange feeling, it was like I was living a dream. I was free to move, free to do whatever I wanted. I could play the game, and the world around me was gone. I had forgotten about my injuries, about my broken leg. I was free, and I reveled in it.\n\nBut the game wasn\u2019t what it seemed. The more I played, the more I saw things. I saw things that were not in the game. I saw people, walking around. They were zombies, and they were all around me. I couldn\u2019t see them, I couldn\u2019t hear them. I couldn\u2019t see anyone, but I knew they were there.\n\nI played the game for hours, and I saw a lot. I saw people that were alive, but they were also dead. They were zombies, but they were still alive, and they were all around me. I tried to ignore them, I tried to play the game and pretend they weren\u2019t there.\n\nBut then I saw him. I saw a man, dressed in a suit. He was playing the game, and he was laughing. He was smiling, and it was clear that he was enjoying himself. He was enjoying the game, and he was enjoying the apocalypse. He was enjoying the destruction and the chaos.\n\nI looked at him, and I saw something in him that I couldn\u2019t quite place. It was a look of pride, a look of satisfaction. He was happy with what had happened, he was happy with the world around him. He was happy that the world had ended in this way.\n\nI looked away from him, and I continued playing the game. But I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he was looking at me. That he was watching me, and waiting for something. I couldn\u2019t see him, but I knew he was there.\n\nSuddenly, the game ended, and I was back in the store. I was back in the real world, and it was back to reality. I looked around, and the store was empty. The broken glass was still there, the broken walls were still there, and the TV was still there. But it was just a TV now, and the game was gone.\n\nI left the store, and walked away from it. I was walking, but I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I was being watched. That someone was watching me, waiting for something. I knew I had to get back to the campsite, I knew I had to find food and rest. I had to make it back home, before something terrible happened.\n\nBut as I walked, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I had been watched, that someone had been watching me. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I had been waiting for something, and that I was not alone in this world."

Let's just go back home, and we can forget about this ever happened.\"\n\nI stare at him, and I see the genuine concern in his eyes. \"I...don't know. I'm not upset. I just feel...off. Like I'm thinking too much.\"\n\nI think back, and I recall the mimics, the way they moved, the way their bodies seemed to shift and change.

I feel like something is missing.\"\n\nI think back again, trying to remember the last few days. Then it hits me. \"I know. I know what's wrong.\"\n\nMy friend looks at me expectantly, but I don't respond. Instead, I turn and walk away, not really noticing where I'm going.

Of course it's normal. What else could we see?\"\n\nI sigh, my mind racing. \"I don't know,\" I answer. \"Maybe nothing. But I do know this: it's not normal.\"\n\nI turn, and walk off again, hearing my friend follow. \"You want to talk about it?\" He asks, his voice a bit softer now.\n\nI stop walking, and I turn back to look at him. \"What can I say?\" I answer. \"It was just too...fast. Too...real.\"\n\nI look at my friend, and I see the same look of concern on his face. He looks...scared.\n\n\"Maybe we should get out of here,\" he says, his voice barely above a whisper. \"Maybe we should just go home.\"\n\nI look away, and I sigh. \"But where will we go?\" I ask.\n\nI hear my friend laugh, a forced laugh. \"Where else? We can just go back to school, I guess.\"\n\nI turn back to him, and I see a flash of fear in his eyes. I see it...and then it's gone. \"I'm sorry,\" he says, shaking his head. \"That sounded bad, didn't it?\"\n\nI shrug, but I don't answer. I can't answer.\n\nI feel...afraid.\n\nI feel like I'm in danger.\n\nI look around, thinking about where we are. I don't know where we are. I don't even know where we came from. I don't know where we're going. But I know this: I don't want to be here anymore.\n\nI know this: I want to go home.\n\nBut I don't know how."

The \"service\" I had signed up to, a necromancer on some arcane web that would resurrect me for a small fee, had apparently seen fit to send me back as a disembodied voice in the body of a cat.\n\nI was not pleased. The previous four attempts at being brought back had gone equally poorly. Last time I'd been reincarnated as a sentient eggplant, which was... interesting. And before that I'd had a couple of \"successes\": I was born a nobleman in some medieval European kingdom, only to die again as a child due to some hereditary illness. The second attempt had, somehow, been a more impressive failure; I was reincarnated as a ghost, but not, as I'd hoped, a ghost with any control or agency. Instead, I was trapped in a non-corporeal state that didn't let me interact with the world in any way, but instead forced me to watch as the rest of my family lived their lives.\n\nAs for the third attempt, well, that had been a disaster. I'd been reincarnated as a woman in the early days of the Renaissance, only to have my life cut short as a witch, burned at the stake for crimes I did not commit. The fourth had been another noble, and another hereditary illness. I had been starting to think that this was a good thing, that I might as well be dead for all the good that resurrection would do me at this point.\n\nAnd then, of course, there was this one. A disembodied voice stuck in the body of a cat. Which, I had to admit, was not even that terrible. The cat was smart, and had been well taken care of by its previous owner. All I had to do was... well, that was the problem, really. How do you \"help\" someone as a disembodied voice? I was not supposed to be here, and I was not supposed to be alive.\n\nI was supposed to be dead.\n\nI'd have to find a way out of this, eventually. But for now... I was stuck."

        "pred_story": "It\u2019s been a month. An entire month of this demon taking over my boss, my boss who now answers only to the name of Bael. \n\nIt\u2019s been an entire month of me, along with the rest of my coworkers, slowly adjusting to the new, very very evil, overlord. In the beginning, it was chaos. Bael\u2019s demonic body had made the boardroom a mess of shattered furniture and blood, and the stench of sulfur was heavy in the air. It was a little unnerving, to say the least, as Bael would bellow orders at us, telling us to \u201cWORK harder, or BURN in the pit of damnation.\u201d \n\nI tried to speak up, to tell him that the office wasn\u2019t exactly a church, and that maybe we weren\u2019t exactly working for God or anything, but he just shook his head at me. \u201cSILENCE! YOU DARE question my authority? YOU will work, or face my wrath!\u201d\n\nIt was scary, but it wasn\u2019t the first demon I had met. The thing is, Bael wasn\u2019t interested in our worship or our souls. Hell, he wasn\u2019t even interested in selling us to the highest bidder. He simply was looking for a way to be rid of the soul that had taken over his body, but one that was bound to him. \n\nSee, as Bael told us one day, when the soul that had taken over his body, was a demon hunter. A man who had been tasked with sending us all back to hell, which meant that Bael had to find a way to free himself of the mortal coil without killing the hunter. \n\n\u201cYOU think you know what I am?\u201d Bael boomed at us, pacing around the conference table. \u201cYOU think you know my history? NO, YOU are simply mortal fools. You have no idea what hell is like, what the underworld is like. And you have no idea what I am. But I\u2019ll tell you, and then you will know.\u201d\n\nBael paused, looking at each of us in turn, as he explained the situation. The hunter, who was in possession of Bael\u2019s body, had been tasked with killing him and sending us all back to hell. So, Bael had to find a way to break the connection between them, without killing the hunter, which meant that he had to find a way to drive the hunter out, without killing Bael himself.\n\n\u201cYou see, I have been bound to this body for years,\u201d Bael explained, \u201cbut the hunter has only just joined me. He has been trying to find a way to break our bond since the day we met, and I have been trying to find a way to kill him for the past week. I simply do not know what to do. But maybe, just maybe, you can help me find a way out of this situation.\u201d\n\nAnd then, the unthinkable happened. Bael offered us a deal. He offered us a deal that would change everything for all of us. \n\n\u201cIF you can help me find a way out of this bond, I will give you a deal. ANYTHING you want, ANYTHING your heart desires, I will grant it to you.\u201d\n\nIt was a deal that we all knew would be too good to be true. Bael knew that if we did, he could easily possess one of us. But we were desperate. We were desperate for a change from our lives. We were desperate to break free from the monotony of our jobs, to break free from the monotony of our lives. \n\nSo, we agreed. We agreed to work with Bael, to find a way to break the bond between him and the hunter. \n\nWe went all out, searching everywhere for a way to break the bond. We had tried everything. Everything. We had tried everything that we could think of. We had tried incantations, potions, spells, curses, and exorcisms. But we couldn\u2019t find anything that worked. \n\nBut, then we stumbled upon something. Something that we hadn\u2019t tried. Something that no one had thought of. \n\n\u201cYou know what,\u201d I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we ask the hunter how he would like to be free of the bond?\u201d\n\nBael snorted, \u201cWHAT? Are you insane? Why would we ask him how to break the bond? It would be easier for us to try and find another way.\u201d\n\nI shook my head, \u201cNo, it wouldn\u2019t. Not if we are going to break the bond. Think about it. He has been trying to find a way out of this bond for weeks, and I bet you that he has a way.\u201d\n\nBael thought for a moment, and I could see the gears turning in his head. \u201cAlright. We will do it. But be warned. If you are wrong, then I will make sure you suffer. And suffering, you will.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cI will be careful. And I will make sure that this works.\u201d\n\nI ran up the stairs, and knocked on the door. \u201cOPEN UP! IT IS Bael, the prince of hell. AND you are coming with me.\u201d\n\nThe door opened slowly, and a man looked at me. He was a man I hadn\u2019t seen in a long time. \n\n\u201cHi, Michael,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you. I didn\u2019t know you were working with a demon now. But I suppose that is fitting, considering your last job was a job for a demon hunter.\u201d\n\nI shook my head. \u201cNo, that was not a job for a demon hunter. I was hired by the church to hunt down the demon who had taken over the body of a woman. But this demon, Bael, has been more than happy to let me try and find a way out. And I think I know how to do it.\u201d\n\nThe man looked at me, his eyes narrowed. \u201cHOW?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll need you to tell me how to break the bond.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, \u201cI will give you the ritual to break the bond, but you have to promise me that you will follow it to the letter. If you miss one step, then I will never know what will happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. I will follow the ritual to the letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, here are the steps. Step one: Light a match and burn it. Then blow out the flames, and place the ashes in a cup. Then you will need to pour two cups of salt on the ashes, and pour them into a circle drawn in the sand. Then, you will need to light another candle and place it in the center of the circle. Then, you will need to recite an incantation, and finally, you will need to blow out the candle, and walk away from the circle.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure this will work?\u201d\n\nHe nodded, \u201cYes, I am sure that this will work. You just need to follow the ritual to the letter.\u201d\n\nI nodded, \u201cAlright. I will follow the ritual to the letter. And if you\u2019re lying to me, then I will be sure to make you suffer.\u201d\n\nHe smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sure you will. But I know you won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nI nodded, \u201cAlright. That\u2019s all. Can we leave?\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cYes, we can leave.\u201d\n\nWe walked to"

        "pred_story": "We were just getting started on the day. Our instructor walked over to our squad and began talking to us. We all knew the speech that was coming. \"Time is your greatest asset and your greatest enemy. Keep track of it at all times. It is the lifeblood of combat. Keep your enemy off balance with your timing, and let the enemy fall behind with time. Do not waste time. It is your lifeblood. With time, you can be anywhere, do anything. Without time, you are nothing more than a corpse waiting for your enemies to find you.\"\n\nIt all made sense, and we could see the logic in what he was saying. It was an easy concept to learn. The hard part was remembering it. After all, most days were spent training in drills or missions against other groups. The days felt all the same. It was the days when we weren't training that were the problem. It was those days when we went on patrol that we could get caught up in our surroundings. \n\nThat was the problem, we didn't stay in the surrounding. It was always, \"we have to get to point A, and be there at a certain time.\" It didn't matter if we had to run, swim, crawl, or fly. We had to get to that point, and be there on time. There were times when we got delayed, and that was when things became tricky. What do you do in those situations?\n\nThe instructors never gave us any answers. Instead, they would tell us to do whatever it takes. We were not the only ones who were facing this problem. All of us were facing it, and all of us had to find our own answers. Some of us chose to run faster. Some of us chose to fly faster. Some of us chose to move faster. Some of us chose to wait. \n\nIt didn't matter how we got there. As long as we were on time. We were all given a special watch that kept track of time for us. It was a beautiful timepiece. It was one that was simple, but effective. It had two buttons on the side of it. One for forward, and one for backward. It was a watch that didn't require batteries, but we were never told what made it tick. \n\nIt was a watch that you could tell time with just by looking at it. There were lines on the inside of it that ran from the button for forward to the button for backward. Those lines were the hours. They were divided into five minute blocks, each block with a line at the edge of it indicating the minute. It was a watch that kept us on track. Except today.\n\nOur squad was out on a mission. We were tasked with gathering intelligence on an enemy base. We were told to be back by a certain time, but that time was not arriving. Every time we checked our watch, it said we were behind schedule. We were moving as fast as we could. We were the best group out there, and we knew it. We didn't need a reminder. \n\nBut the time on the watch was constantly saying we were behind. It was only a few minutes every time, but the few minutes were adding up. We all knew it. We could see it. We could feel it. We could taste it. Time was working against us. We were moving through the forest. The enemy was behind us. It was going to catch up to us if we didn't speed up.\n\nWe were all running. We were all moving at top speed. Our feet pounded against the forest floor. We leaped over roots and rocks. We dodged low branches and branches that had fallen to the ground. We were running for our lives. The sound of footsteps echoed in the forest. It was getting louder.\n\nThe watch was saying that we had one minute left. We were still moving forward, but we were moving at a slower pace now. We were tired, but we kept moving. We knew that we had to be on time. We had to be there. We had to be ready. We were almost there, and the footsteps were almost upon us. \n\nThe watch was saying that we had two seconds left. The enemy was right behind us. We were running for our lives. We were almost there. We were almost ready. The watch was saying that we had five seconds left. We were moving faster now. We were running with all of our might. The enemy was right behind us, but they didn't catch up. \n\nThe watch was saying that we were five minutes behind schedule. We were at the enemy base, but we were late. We didn't know what to do. The enemy was closing in. We were out numbered. We were out gunned. We were out timed. The watch was saying that we were six minutes behind schedule. We were running out of time."

They would have a new life with all their memories intact. However, this life was bound to the Devourer.\n\nEvery life would have the Devourer's immortality. They would not die of natural causes.

        "pred_story": "There is an old kingdom, in an old time. The kingdom was called the Kingdom of Eldrador, and it was founded on a hill overlooking a lake. The kingdom was made by the people who lived in the hill and around the lake, and it was built by the people of the kingdom who were very skilled and powerful. They knew very well how to build anything they could think about, and they built a lot of things, and they made the kingdom very powerful and rich.\n\nThe kingdom was made so powerful and rich that it took over the entire country and made itself the only state. The people of the kingdom were very proud of their new position, and they thought that they could do anything and control everything.\n\nBut not all the people of the country were happy with the new state of the country. A lot of people who lived in the cities and the towns and the villages did not like that the Kingdom of Eldrador was taking over everything and was treating them as their servants.\n\nThese people decided to fight back against the Kingdom of Eldrador, and they made a new kingdom, the Kingdom of Valenir. They were not as skilled as the people of Eldrador were, but they were very brave and very determined.\n\nThe people of the Kingdom of Eldrador were very surprised to find out that there were people who wanted to fight against them. They were not used to such a thing, and they did not know how to handle it. They thought that all the people of the country should obey them and that they should do everything that they wanted.\n\nThey decided to make a powerful magic spell that would eliminate all the people of the Kingdom of Valenir. They gathered many powerful magicians who knew all about the magic that they would need to do. They put everything they had into this magic, and it seemed to work.\n\nThe Kingdom of Valenir was completely destroyed, and all its people died. The people of the Kingdom of Eldrador were very happy that they were able to defeat their enemy so easily. They thought that this was the end of the war, and that they could now return to the peace that they wanted.\n\nBut they were wrong. The magicians that they used to defeat the Kingdom of Valenir did not destroy their kingdom completely. They destroyed all the people, but they left the buildings and the kingdom itself.\n\nThe kingdom was still there, and it stood on the lake, but it was different now. There was no one there to take care of it, and it started to crumble. The buildings fell apart, the walls were destroyed, and the lake was polluted.\n\nThe people of the Kingdom of Eldrador were not happy about this. They thought that they should have destroyed everything completely, and that it would have been easier for them to do so.\n\nThey decided to fix their mistakes, and they sent people to destroy everything. But they did not finish their work. They were tired of the war, and they did not want to do anything more.\n\nSo the kingdom of Eldrador was also destroyed. The people of the kingdom were also killed, and only a few survived. The survivors were not even happy about this. They thought that the people who died should have survived, and that they themselves should have died.\n\nBut there was something strange happening in the kingdoms. A lighthouse was there, and it was still standing. It was in the middle of the kingdoms, and it was not destroyed. It stood like it was always there, watching the people and their kingdoms.\n\nThe lighthouse was made from the magic that the magicians of the kingdoms made. It was made to guide the people of the kingdom to the right path, and to tell them what they should do. The lighthouse was made so that it could talk to the people who lived in the kingdoms, and that it could guide them.\n\nThe lighthouse was there, and it watched everything that happened in the kingdoms. It watched the people as they died, and it watched the kingdoms as they were destroyed.\n\nThe lighthouse was still there when the people of the country realized that they had made a mistake. They realized that the magic that they made was not to destroy other people, but to protect them and to guide them.\n\nThey realized that the people of the Kingdom of Eldrador and the Kingdom of Valenir were all the same people. They were all people of the country, and they were all equal. They realized that the kingdoms were not right, and that they should have been one kingdom, and not two.\n\nThey realized that the people who died were not the people of the Kingdom of Eldrador and the Kingdom of Valenir. They were people who died because they were wrong, and because they did not understand how to live. They died because they did not understand that everyone is equal, and that everyone deserves the same rights and the same opportunities.\n\nThe lighthouse was still there when the people of the country realized that they had made a mistake. It was still there when they decided to do something about it.\n\nThe people decided to make a new kingdom, the kingdom of Eldrador and Valenir. They decided that this would be the last kingdom of the country, and that it would be one kingdom that would unite all the people of the country.\n\nThe lighthouse was still there when the people made the new kingdom. It was still there when the people decided to make a new magic that would guide them to the right path.\n\nThe lighthouse was still there when the people of the new kingdom realized that they had made another mistake. They realized that the new kingdom was not right, and that it should be one kingdom that would unite all the people of the country.\n\nSo they did the same thing that they had done before. They decided to make a new kingdom that would unite all the people of the country. They decided that this would be the last kingdom of the country, and that it would be one kingdom that would unite all the people.\n\nBut the lighthouse was not there anymore.

        "pred_story": "My family has been grave keepers for a thousand years and we've always treated death as an honor. We've taken the dead out of their beds and buried them in the ground, we've made beautiful coffins with intricate carvings and we've even performed the rites to help the spirits transition to the afterlife. We were the first ones to bring the dead to be buried with a proper ceremony and we were proud of it. We always respected the dead and made sure they were properly mourned and remembered.\n\nNowadays, things are a bit different. Some people don't want to go to the cemetery, some don't want to remember the dead and some just don't care. Our cemetery is smaller now with less visitors. Some of the graves are covered with dirt and grass, but it's not as beautiful as it used to be.\n\nI was about twelve when I met him. I was watching over a grave with flowers when a man walked in and left a bouquet of flowers. I didn't notice who he was at first, but after seeing him for a few times, I saw him again. He came with some gifts of wine, grapes and flowers. He was always dressed in black and wore a top hat. He looked a bit like a skeleton with a cape, but I liked his kind gestures.\n\nWhen he came back one day, he didn't come alone. He was with a woman and a child who were dressed like him, but not as nicely. The woman wore a red dress and her hair was a darker shade of blonde. The child was a boy with brown hair and a smile. He looked a bit like the man with the top hat. He kept on smiling at me as he came closer and gave me a few hugs. They were not a bit suspicious to me, but I still wondered who they were and why they were here.\n\nI didn't have to wait long before he came to me again. He left a bouquet of flowers with a note saying: \"Hello, my family. I've been thinking of you and I'm glad to have found you again. I've missed you since I left all those years ago. I've thought you were dead for a while, but I knew you couldn't be. I have found some friends who have helped me find you. I hope you can forgive me for being away for so long. I'm looking forward to seeing you again, my dear family.\"\n\nI was a bit confused and couldn't make out who these people were. Why would the grave keeper, someone I had never met before, come to visit our family? And what family did he have? Who were these three people and why were they leaving flowers and gifts?\n\nI tried to avoid them, but they kept on coming back. I was worried that they might disturb the graves and the family, but they were very respectful and never disturbed anything. The man and his family were always very friendly and they never disturbed anything. I wasn't sure if they were good or bad people, but I couldn't say they were evil.\n\nWhen I grew up, my dad told me that our family had been keeping graves for centuries. I was the fifth generation to take care of the graves. My great-great-grandfather had kept the graves before me. My dad mentioned some stories of the graves and the people who kept them. They were stories of people who were special, of people who had lived centuries before and who would come to visit the graves. My dad said they were good people who would visit us and pay their respects to the dead.\n\nWhen I heard this, I realized that this must be the family that the man with the top hat was talking about. He was my great-great-grandfather who had kept the graves for so many years. I couldn't believe it that my family had been keeping graves for such a long time. I couldn't believe that my great-great-grandfather had been visiting the graves for so long.\n\nThis was when I realized who the man with the top hat was. He was not a stranger, but a member of my family who had been coming back to visit us for a long time. I was so confused and didn't know what to think. My family had been keeping graves for centuries, but I never thought that one of them would be coming back to visit us.\n\nMy great-great-grandfather, the man with the top hat, had been visiting us for a long time and I realized that he must have been the one to bring the woman and the child who had been visiting the graves with him. But where had they come from? My dad didn't say anything about them.\n\nI asked my dad why he hadn't told me about this, but he said he was afraid of telling me. He said he was worried that I might think the dead were coming back to life. He said that the dead couldn't come back to life and that it was all just stories from my great-great-grandfather. He said that the stories were just myths and that the dead couldn't talk to the living.\n\nI didn't know what to believe. I didn't know if my dad was telling me the truth. I was confused and couldn't make sense of it all. But at the same time, I was curious and wanted to learn more. I wanted to learn about my family and the people who had been keeping the graves for centuries.\n\nI wanted to know more about my great-great-grandfather who had been visiting the graves for so long. I wanted to know more about the woman and the child who had been visiting the graves with him. Who were they and why were they visiting the graves? And why were they visiting my family's graves?\n\nI didn't know where to start, but I knew I would need to ask more questions to find the answers. I knew that my dad might not tell me the truth, but I was going to try to find out more. I was going to try to learn more about my family and the people who had been keeping the graves for centuries."

        "pred_story": "King Harlan had never thought himself very intelligent, much less the equal of a mind like Sarela. He hadn't expected the shadow to be so sharp, or so cunning. But now, as he sat in his darkened cell, he understood what he had done wrong.\n\nThe problem was not Sarela's power, or even the way she wielded it. It was the fact that she was a woman. Harlan had never been one for politics, or even for understanding people. He had always assumed that a king should rule through strength, and that to do otherwise was weakness.\n\nAnd so, when Sarela had presented herself as a shadow-queen of the darkness, Harlan had seen her as nothing more than a woman, one that he could easily defeat. And he had done it, with the aid of his finest warriors and the magical support of his priestess.\n\nNow, though, he understood that Sarela had been playing him from the start. She had allowed him to think her a woman, to be fooled by her beauty and her gentle movements. But behind his back, she had been weaving a web of power, one that ensnared all of his strongest guards, his most powerful advisors. Even his own daughter was trapped in it, though he did not yet know that.\n\nThe reason for Sarela's silence had not been weakness, but patience. She had waited until she had control, and then she had struck. And Harlan knew that he was doomed, that there was no escape from the shadow.\n\nHe thought about his wife, the way she would have screamed as he was dragged away. He thought about his daughter, how she would be waiting for him, thinking that he would return to her. And he thought about his kingdom, the way it would fall apart as Sarela took control.\n\nSarela emerged from the shadows, the dark figure of a woman standing before him. \"So, Harlan,\" she said. \"Did you expect this?\"\n\n\"No,\" Harlan admitted. \"I assumed you would be a man, or at least one that I could fight.\"\n\nSarela smiled, her face gleaming in the dim light. \"And so you did,\" she said. \"But I am not a man, nor a woman. I am a shadow, a dark and ancient power that has been growing for centuries.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Harlan said. \"That is why I had to stop you. I could not allow you to take over.\"\n\n\"But you have not,\" Sarela said. \"You have merely made it easier for me to do so.\"\n\n\"I do not understand,\" Harlan said.\n\n\"Of course not,\" Sarela said. \"But it will make sense soon enough. Right now, I have one question for you. What was your first mistake?\"\n\n\"I...I do not know,\" Harlan said. \"I was doing my job, as a king. Protecting my people.\"\n\n\"And what did you do to protect them?\" Sarela asked.\n\n\"I...I had my guards kill a shadow-witch. I did not know that you were one of them.\"\n\nSarela nodded. \"And what was your second mistake?\"\n\n\"I...I killed a shadow-man. I did not realize that he was your servant, or your son.\"\n\nSarela nodded again. \"And what was your third mistake?\"\n\nHarlan thought for a moment before responding. \"I think I was trying to be a man, rather than a king,\" he said. \"I allowed my emotions to cloud my judgment, and I made decisions based on those emotions rather than logic.\"\n\nSarela nodded, smiling to herself. \"You are correct,\" she said. \"But you did not realize it until now, did you?\"\n\n\"No,\" Harlan admitted. \"What should I have done?\"\n\nSarela shrugged. \"You could have listened to your daughter,\" she said. \"She is wise beyond her years, and she would have cautioned you against your mistakes.\"\n\n\"But I do not have a daughter now,\" Harlan said, realizing what Sarela had done.\n\nSarela laughed, the sound echoing through the darkness. \"Not at the moment,\" she said. \"But you have a shadow-son now. And he will lead you.\"\n\n\"Lead me?\" Harlan repeated. \"How?\"\n\nSarela shrugged. \"That is not your problem,\" she said. \"But he will be with you soon enough, as you learn to rule from the shadows.\""

        "pred_story": "They sat and stared at me with their mouths agape, their faces frozen in a mix of fear and confusion. The classroom was silent, no murmurs or whispers of the students trying to make sense of what was happening. They simply sat, staring at me as I stood at the front of the room, looking down at them with a disapproving look. I didn't see the fear in their eyes as a reason to not go back to work, I saw it as a sign that they needed me.\n\n\"Alright, I see you're all awake,\" I said, my voice a little louder than I wanted it to be. The students jumped in their seats, their eyes darting towards the door as they wondered if others had heard my voice.\n\nI cleared my throat and continued on, ignoring the fear in their eyes. \"Let's get this started, I have a lot to get through today.\" I went to start on the notes, but my hand passed through them. I tried to hold them in place, but I couldn't grab them. I looked down at my hand, confused, and realized that I didn't have a physical body. It all made sense. The students had teamed up to kill me.\n\nBut that still didn't stop me from getting through my notes.\n\nI floated around the room, pointing to things and explaining them. The students were in shock, but as the notes went on, they started to realize how ridiculous they had been. They had gone to such lengths to kill me, but yet I was still here, floating above them, lecturing them as if nothing had happened.\n\nOne of the students, probably the one who had come up with the idea, stood up, shouting \"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!\" \n\nI stared at him, not knowing how to respond. I had been ready for the confrontation, but I had not been expecting him to scream at me. I could see the other students looking at him, confused, and wondering if they should join in. I cleared my throat and pointed at the notes on the board.\n\n\"See, the key difference between a prokaryote and a eukaryote is that prokaryotes do not have a membrane around their cell.\"\n\nI ignored his anger and continued on, ignoring his rage. His anger started to subside, and I could see the other students starting to calm down. The boy continued to stare at me, but eventually he sat down, trying to make sense of it all.\n\nI smiled to myself, satisfied that I had regained control of the classroom. As I finished up the notes, I heard a faint whisper in my ear, \"Are you a zombie?\". I turned around, looking at the back of the classroom, but it was silent. I saw a hand in the back of the room, and smiled.\n\nI reached out to the hand and pointed to my nose. The hand made a funny face, pointing back at my nose, and I smiled. I looked back at the rest of the students, who were all staring at me with a blank expression. I pointed to the hand, then at myself, and they all looked at me with confusion. It was a simple way to communicate that I was still in here, still working, and that we would make it through this."

\u00a0And why was she so calm? \u00a0\u201cDo you have my sister?\u201d I asked. \u00a0\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have your sister,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cThen why are we here?\u201d I asked. \u00a0\u201cI want to ask you a question,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not going to answer any of your questions,\u201d I said. \u00a0\u201cFine,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cThen I\u2019ll ask my own questions,\u201d she said. \u00a0I frowned. \u00a0\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked. \u00a0\u201cAre you married?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u00a0\u201cThen I\u2019m your sister-in-law,\u201d she said.\n\nI stared at her. \u00a0\u201cWhere is my sister?\u201d I asked again. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m your sister-in-law,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I said. \u00a0\u201cOf course, you don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cNo, I mean, where is she? \u00a0Do you have her?\u201d I asked. \u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s on the couch,\u201d she said. \u00a0I turned around, and saw my sister lying on the couch. \u00a0She was fast asleep.\n\nI looked back at her, and realized who she was. \u00a0She was my ex-girlfriend, the one who dumped me in high school. \u00a0I had seen her many times since then, and I had never seen her without her mask. \u00a0But now, she didn\u2019t have her mask. \u00a0And she was wearing pajamas. \u00a0\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were here?\u201d I asked. \u00a0\u201cI wanted to surprise you,\u201d she said.\n\nI stared at her, and realized how much I missed her. \u00a0She was my ex-girlfriend, but I still loved her. \u00a0But how could I love her? \u00a0She was the Red Widow, and I was the Avenger. \u00a0We were enemies. \u00a0And now, she was my sister-in-law. \u00a0I felt confused. \u00a0But one thing was for sure, I was not going to take her to the police station. \u00a0No, I was going to let her go, and maybe she would visit us again.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d she said, looking at me. \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked. \u00a0\u201cAre you going to take me away?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\u201cYes,\u201d I said, but I didn\u2019t move. \u00a0\u201cWhy are you standing there?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\u201cI think it would be better if you went home,\u201d I said. \u00a0\u201cYou mean, I\u2019m not coming to jail?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d I said, smiling. \u00a0She smiled back. \u00a0\u201cThen I\u2019ll go now,\u201d she said.\n\nShe went out of the room, and I heard her closing the front door. \u00a0Then I heard my sister. \u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s gone,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cYes,\u201d I said, smiling. \u00a0\u201cThen you can come in,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, walking into the room.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I wasn\u2019t expecting that,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry too,\u201d I said, smiling. \u00a0\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m your brother,\u201d I said. \u00a0\u201cYou?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m the Avenger,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThen why did you let my sister go?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\u201cBecause she\u2019s my sister too,\u201d I said. \u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s my wife too,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u00a0\u201cAnd how did you know?\u201d she asked. \u00a0\u201cI have my ways,\u201d I said, smiling."

I was too busy talking to the other reporter to listen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that explains why I was confused. But why did you guys tell me that was the note?\u201d\n\nShe shrugged again. \u201cBecause the other reporter was right there.

She was saying the same thing we\u2019ve been saying.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was saying the note was wrong?\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cYes.

It was the same one she had been working through for the past twenty minutes, but she had to keep the pilot in the loop. After all, she was the one who had hired him.\n\n\u201cYes, Captain.\u201d He responded, his voice strained. She looked up to see him staring at the door to the bridge. She followed his gaze to see that it had slid open, revealing the dimly lit hallway that stretched out the back of the ship. \u201cAre we taking on passengers?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Mr. Jones. There\u2019s been a malfunction. We\u2019re returning to dock.\u201d She tried to make it sound casual, but she was lying. She had only hired Mr. Jones to fly the ship to a remote planet. No one was supposed to be on board. And yet, here was a second person. A stowaway.\n\n\u201cCaptain, I think you\u2019re going to want to see this.\u201d He said, standing up. He walked past her, through the open door, and down the hallway. She followed him, her heart pounding in her chest. They reached the door to the airlock, and he stopped. \u201cAre you coming in there with me?\u201d He asked.\n\n\u201cOf course I am. I\u2019m your captain. It\u2019s my job to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d She responded. He opened the door and walked in. She followed, closing the door behind her. He was standing there, facing her. \u201cI don\u2019t see him. Where is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking for the stowaway?\u201d He asked, pointing to the airlock.\n\n\u201cThe stowaway?\u201d She repeated. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m going to find out.\u201d He started pressing buttons on the control panel, trying to open the outer door. She stepped forward and put her hand on the panel. \u201cLet me do that.\u201d She said. He looked at her in surprise, then turned and left the airlock.\n\n\u201cCaptain, is there a problem?\u201d She heard his voice from outside the door.\n\n\u201cNo, Mr. Jones. I was just getting some fresh air. I\u2019d like you to join me.\u201d She responded, opening the outer door.\n\n\u201cCaptain, there\u2019s nothing out there. You\u2019re the only one on board.\u201d He said.\n\n\u201cMr. Jones, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve done with my crew, but I want you to open up the log and look for any evidence of tampering. And then, I want you to get the emergency power off and get us back to the dock.\u201d She said. He looked at her like she was crazy, then sighed and turned and walked out the door.\n\nShe waited until he had left the bridge, then turned to face the control panel. She looked at the buttons, and then down at the floor. There, peeking out from under the console, was a small piece of paper. She bent down and picked it up. It was a note, written in a childish scrawl. \u201cI hid in the airlock. I hope you don\u2019t get mad.\u201d\n\nShe looked up, then down again. She reached out and touched the outer door. It was still open, and she could see the outline of a small boy in the airlock, peeking out at her. She smiled, then turned and walked back to the control panel. She started pressing buttons, calling up the logs for the past few days.\n\n\u201cCaptain, I think I\u2019ve found the problem. It looks like there\u2019s some kind of virus that\u2019s been going around. It looks like it was introduced on the previous flight. I\u2019ve isolated it, but I\u2019m not sure how to get rid of it.\u201d He said, stepping into the bridge.\n\n\u201cMr. Jones, the only people on this ship are us. I don\u2019t see how a virus could have caused this.\u201d She said.\n\n\u201cAh, yes. I forgot about the stowaway. It must have been him.\u201d He said. She looked at him in surprise. \u201cI take that back. It was no virus.\u201d He said, then smiled. \u201cIt was a stowaway.\u201d"

Are you all idiots?\" he shouted. \"I am the god of nothingness. I am the one that brings absolute terror to the mortal mind.\"\n\nThe cultists murmured in agreement, but the dark god continued his rant. \"I am the embodiment of the most basic fears that mortals have. I am the unknown that is yet to be discovered. I am the darkness that is waiting around every corner.\"\n\n\"I'm going to give you one final chance. Go out there and convince the next person you encounter to join my cult, or you will all pay for your incompetence.\"\n\nThe cultists rushed out the door, each one determined to prove themselves. They walked through the city until they came upon a man that would be their final test. He was walking with his head down, clearly lost in thought. He was unaware that the cultists were staring at him, and as they watched him pass by, they noticed something peculiar. As he passed by, a figure appeared in front of him, and with a sharp gesture, the cultists watched as the man's head was snapped off of his body.\n\nThe cultists were all shocked at the sudden event. It took them a moment to realize what they had just witnessed, and they were all stunned. The cultists stared at each other in shock, unable to move or react.\n\nThe dark god slammed his fist onto the table. \"What is wrong with you all? What kind of cultists are you? You are supposed to be the best of the best. You are supposed to have the most unique skills. And yet, you can't even manage to persuade a lowly mortal.\"\n\nThe cultists all hung their heads in shame, unable to respond. The dark god sighed and shook his head. \"I can't believe that I even bothered with this cult. I can't even be bothered to have a good conversation with mortals. It's pathetic that I even need to be involved with mortals in the first place.\"\n\nThe cultists all felt a pang of sorrow as they realized what they had done wrong. They knew that they had failed in their mission, and now they had to face the consequences. They each took one final step before their heads were all knocked off their bodies, and like the man before them, each cultist was no more.\n\nAfter the last cultist fell, the dark god spoke once more. \"I don't even know why I bother with mortals. I should just focus on my own cult. At least then, I would have some mortals that are loyal to me. But no, I have to spend my time on the mortals that cannot even do their job.\"\n\nThe dark god leaned his head on his palm, wondering how he had become so powerless in his own cult."

No sign of the ship. *Where the hell was it?* I didn\u2019t want to be the guy who failed his buddy check. But I was.\n\nI began my slow ascent.\n\nJust as I was about to turn on my lights, I saw it. A figure.\n\nIt took a second for my brain to process the sight. A man. Sitting on a chair. With a smile on his face.\n\nHe waved at me.\n\nI waved back.\n\nI looked around. The chair was in the middle of the sea floor. No ship in sight. I kicked over towards him, looking around. The seafloor was sandy. I saw a few fish but no signs of life beyond that.\n\nAs I swam closer, he stood. His body was humanoid but different. His skin was white like a ghost. His hair was a dark blue. He was wearing black pants and a white shirt. No diving gear at all.\n\nI stopped beside him. \u201cWhat the fuck? How are you alive down here?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me. \u201cI asked myself the same thing.\u201d\n\nI looked around. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Where\u2019s the ship?\u201d\n\nHe waved his hands. \u201cThere is no ship. The ship sank at the start of the dive.\u201d\n\nI blinked. \u201cThe start of the dive? Are you joking?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you. There is no ship. You were given a note. It said that you were participating in a study on the effects of isolation and loneliness. That the ship was not real. That you would be given a chance to leave after 60 minutes. And that your time was running out.\u201d\n\nI looked at him. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that this is some sort of study. Where have you been hiding this whole time?\u201d\n\nHe shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You came down here thinking it was real, but it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nI blinked. \u201cWhy not? Where am I?\u201d \n\nThe ghost nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. If you answer a question truthfully, I\u2019ll give you your answer.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cDeal.\u201d\n\nHe smiled. \u201cOkay. Why did you dive down to a shipwreck?\u201d \n\nI shrugged. \u201cI wanted to see it. I wanted to know what it was like down there.\u201d\n\nHis smile grew wider. \u201cWhy would you want to do that?\u201d\n\nI thought about it. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess it\u2019s because I\u2019m curious. I\u2019ve heard that shipwrecks are pretty cool. I\u2019ve seen pictures. I\u2019ve read about them. I wanted to see it myself. Because life is short and it\u2019s better to live it than to miss it.\u201d I looked up at the surface. \u201cI guess I wanted to live it a little more.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cYou can leave now.\u201d\n\nI looked back at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to you?\u201d \n\nHe shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess you\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nI looked at him. He smiled back at me.\n\nI grinned and kicked towards the surface.\n\nI broke through the surface and swam back to the boat. *Got to tell her that I passed the dive.* My dive computer beeped. *Time elapsed.* I glanced down at it.\n\nThe screen was blank.\n\nI stared at it. *What the fuck?* I turned on my lights and kicked down.\n\nThe seafloor was empty.\n\nI looked around. There was no ghost. No ship. Nothing.\n\nJust me. Alone.\n\nI looked at my dive computer. The screen was blank.\n\nI thought back to the conversation. The ghost had said that the time was running out. But what if he had lied? What if the time was still running.\n\nI thought about it for a second before I started to swim back up. *I have to go back to the boat and find out what's going on.* I looked around. *How long have I been down here? 4:32. I got to get back up there before she leaves.*\n\nI kicked back up towards the surface. As I broke through, I saw the boat leaving. *Oh my god. What the hell is going on?* I kicked as fast as I could. But the boat was getting further and further away.\n\nAs I looked back at the empty sea floor, I realized that I was going to be left alone down here."

And then there was the person who had been in prison at the time of the death, and the person that had a solid alibi for the time of the death, and the person who had an argument with the victim.  \n\nThen there were the witnesses who had all seen something different and none of them had anything that could pin the killer to the scene of the crime.\n\nThen there was me.\n\nI was the person who had made a few mistakes. I was the person who had left my fingerprints on the wine glass next to the victim's body. I was the person who had left some hair on the victims sweater. I was the person who had a solid connection to the victim and had a history with them that included a fight that was known to only a few people.\n\nIt was easy to see why no one suspected me, I was clearly innocent and had no motive to kill the victim. The witnesses were confused and seemed to have all seen different things. And the fingerprints and hair didn't point to anyone, only me. \n\nI knew that I had to keep up this act, at least until the body was found and the investigation had been closed. I kept following up on the investigation and seeing how it was going. I kept showing up to the scene, I kept talking to the officers and detectives. And I kept pointing the finger at the others.\n\nAs the time passed I began to lose hope that I would get away with this. It would be too easy to get caught when I was the only one who knew my secret. I had a great motive, a history with the victim that would explain all of the evidence against me. And I had a solid alibi, I had been out of town for the entire week.\n\nI was sure that I was going to get caught and it was only a matter of time before I got arrested and put on trial. And it would be a long time before I would be released back into the general population. The evidence against me would be overwhelming and it would take a miracle to get me off.\n\nAnd so as I was walking through the crime scene, I couldn't help but notice the detectives and officers working to figure out who the killer was. And I saw the victim's body lying on the floor, the blood everywhere. \n\nI saw them trying to find the killer and I thought to myself how easy it would be for me to be caught. All it would take was one misstep and I would be caught and put on trial. And I would be found guilty and put in jail for the rest of my life.\n\nBut I didn't see the other man staring at me from across the room. The man in the black suit and sunglasses. The man who didn't have a badge on. The man who didn't have an earpiece. The man who didn't have any reason to be at the crime scene.\n\nThe man who looked at me and smiled at me. The man who knew my secret. The man who knew that I was the killer. The man who knew that I had done a terrible job at hiding my tracks. \n\nAnd the man who didn't have a single care about any of that.\n\nHe just smiled at me and walked up to me. He was the only one in the room who knew my secret and he didn't seem to care about it.\n\n\"What do you think happened here?\" I asked him, trying to be as casual as possible.\n\n\"Looks like a typical case to me,\" he replied, looking around the room.\n\n\"Looks like, you think?\" I asked.\n\n\"You know, just a typical case,\" he replied.\n\n\"Like you would expect.\" I replied.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Well, I think I'll let you get back to work,\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, okay, well I'll see you later, then.\" He said.\n\nI nodded and walked back to my car, the man watching me leave as I was putting the car into park.\n\nHe walked up to the car and knocked on the window.\n\n\"Hey, you might want to think about cleaning up some of the evidence, things might get weird if someone finds that bloodstain.\""

        "pred_story": "\u201cHey! There\u2019s an ad on the app about some bar that\u2019s open all night. What\u2019s the haps?\u201d  It was a Saturday night, I was in my room and was using the bathroom when I heard my roommate\u2019s voice behind me. He was in his room, so I couldn\u2019t tell how he got in, but I was about to ask him when I saw the look on his face. My first thought was that it was some kind of prank, or maybe a joke, but when he opened his mouth to speak, I realized he was serious.\n\nI went back to my room and he followed me. I sat on my bed and he sat in his chair and looked at me. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d He said. I shook my head and he looked at his phone. He scrolled through the app then showed me the ad. It was a bar that was open all night. \u201cIt\u2019s been an all-night bar for a while now, but I never checked it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s on the other side of town,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s at least a 30 minute drive if there isn\u2019t much traffic.\u201d I said. He shrugged and I could tell he was still staring at the screen. \u201cHey,\u201d I said. \u201cHow\u2019d you get in my room?\u201d I was going to let it slide, but then he started acting weird. He was fidgeting on his phone and it didn\u2019t take long to realize why. \u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d I said. \u201cWhy are you looking at that ad again?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a party,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all night. I saw it last night and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s still there.\u201d He was really serious now. I wanted to tell him that I was sure it was a scam, or a prank or maybe a misunderstanding. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ask your friends? You have to have a friend or two here in town that you can call, don\u2019t you? There\u2019s a whole town here, I know that much.\u201d He kept staring at the phone as I spoke. He was getting more and more agitated.\n\nI took a deep breath and realized how serious he was. \u201cAlright,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that could happen if you go?\u201d I had to give him an answer. He started to speak, but then I had it. \u201cYou\u2019ll be at a bar for all night,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re an adult, you can drink if you want. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a crime or anything.\u201d He nodded at me.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go then,\u201d he said. I shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know how else to put this, but I\u2019m not driving. Not here. You\u2019ll have to rent a car.\u201d I said. He shrugged and I knew we had a car rental place down the street. \u201cI don\u2019t know where we are,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the bar is going to be at the top of the hill, or at the bottom. It doesn\u2019t say that.\u201d I said. He shrugged and I could tell he had no idea either. I thought about all the things that could go wrong, but I didn\u2019t know what else to do. He was serious, and I knew he\u2019d go alone if I didn\u2019t go with him."

        "pred_story": "I was the last to join the academy for magic.\n\nThe other students already had a specialty. One was a pyromancer, who learned his magic from the stars, where fire was born. Another was an aeromancer, who learned his magic from the wind, where the earth was shaped. \n\nI was the last student left out, as they learned their magic by way of a book, which was written in blood, of blood.\n\nI didn\u2019t know where my magic came from. It was as if I was a magnet, and the ground was a metal, and I was attracted to its electrons. I could feel the energy all around me, and as soon as I touched it, I could see the world around me differently. I could see the atoms and electrons that made up everything, and I could feel what magic was inside of everything.\n\nThe other students didn\u2019t know what to make of me. They said I was cursed, that my magic was evil, that I was a freak of nature.\n\nBut I knew that wasn\u2019t true. I knew that everyone had magic inside of them. It was just a matter of how to use it.\n\nOne of the teachers of the academy was a pyromancer. He had lived for thousands of years, and had a long white beard. He was a great teacher, and had taught many students in their specialty, but when he came to me, he was at a loss.\n\n\u201cHow do you work with your magic?\u201d he asked, and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\n\n\u201cStabbing?\u201d I said, and I could see the confusion on his face.\n\n\u201cStabbing?\u201d he repeated, and I could see the fear in his eyes.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d I said, and I pulled out a dagger.\n\n\u201cIs that a knife?\u201d he asked, and I could see the fear in his eyes.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d I said, and I touched the blade to my palm.\n\nI could see the atoms in the blade, and I could feel the energy inside of them. I could see the magic inside of the blade, and it was like a fire that was waiting to be unleashed.\n\nI touched the blade to my palm, and I could feel the energy of the blade course through my body. I could feel the magic inside of the blade, and it was like a storm that was waiting to be unleashed.\n\nI stabbed into the air, and it felt like the blade was cutting through an invisible wall. I could see the air around me come alive, as if it was a physical object that was waiting to be cut through.\n\nI pulled the blade out, and I could feel the magic still coursing through my body. I could see the energy around me, as if it was a tangible thing that was waiting to be unleashed.\n\nThe teacher watched me, his eyes wide with fear and confusion. He didn\u2019t know what to make of me, and he didn\u2019t know how to help me.\n\nI walked up to him, the blade still in my hand, and I could feel the energy of the blade coursing through my body. I could see the magic inside of the blade, and it was like a storm that was waiting to be unleashed.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d I said, my voice steady and calm.\n\n\u201cI know that you have magic inside of you,\u201d he said, his voice shaking with fear. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what kind of magic it is. It\u2019s not like anything I have ever seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d I said, and I smiled. \u201cMy magic is different. It\u2019s not like the magic that you have taught me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what is it?\u201d he asked, and I could see the fear in his eyes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stabbing,\u201d I said, and I held out the dagger.\n\n\u201cStabbing?\u201d he repeated, and I could see the confusion on his face.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, and I stabbed into the air.\n\nI could feel the blade cutting through the invisible wall of air, and I could see the energy around me come alive. I could feel the magic inside of the blade, and it was like a storm that was waiting to be unleashed.\n\nThe teacher watched me, his eyes wide with fear and confusion. He didn\u2019t know what to make of me, and he didn\u2019t know how to help me.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t need his help. I knew my magic, and I knew how to use it. I had spent years studying it, and I knew every trick and technique there was.\n\nI was the best stabbing mage, and I knew it."

        "pred_story": "It was just as he had predicted. At least, he thought so. In the dimly lit backroom, the two leaders of the alliance sat hunched over a small wooden table. The orc leader, Togga, grunted and scratched his thick black beard, as he was wont to do when he was in deep thought. His fellow, Balandir, the dwarf leader, simply glared at Togga, as he always did.\n\n\"So,\" Togga said, \"what do you think will happen today?\"\n\n\"I think we'll all die,\" Balandir muttered. \"I always thought you were a madman for trying to ally with us. And now we're all just sitting ducks waiting for a knife in the back.\"\n\nTogga snorted. \"If anything, I thought we'd be ambushed first, not after.\"\n\nBalandir shrugged. \"I didn't think anyone would be as stupid as you.\"\n\nTogga smiled. \"Stupid?\"\n\nBalandir nodded. \"Yes, for trying to forge alliances. For thinking we can ever trust each other. It is the most naive thing I've ever heard.\"\n\nTogga sighed. \"I could never have predicted the outcome of this alliance, I assure you. And I do hope we see more of the like in our lifetime.\"\n\nBalandir scoffed. \"I doubt it, especially among the dwarves. Most don't approve of the alliance, and if you tried to form another, they'd kill you.\"\n\nTogga tilted his head. \"They might. But they won't. For one, you dwarves are known for your stubbornness. And for another, we've already formed a lot of connections. We're not about to let some stupid argument tear all of that down.\"\n\nBalandir laughed. \"You're not about to tear it down, that's for sure. And yet, you're not doing anything to make this alliance stronger.\"\n\nTogga shrugged. \"I'm not sure what to do. If we go to war now, things will get bad. But if we keep going on like this, things will get better. And I'm fairly certain that the next generation will be much more understanding of the alliance.\"\n\nBalandir shook his head. \"You're just too optimistic.\"\n\nTogga sighed. \"I know. I wish I wasn't. But at the same time, I think the alliance is a good idea. If we can manage to keep our heads down until the war is over, then we'll have a better chance of surviving it.\"\n\nBalandir grunted. \"You're right.\"\n\nTogga grinned. \"I know.\"\n\nThe two leaders shared a laugh, before the door to the room opened. A guard, a half-orc half-elf woman, leaned into the room. \"Leaders, the celebration is ready. Would you like to attend?\"\n\nTogga and Balandir stood, before the orc leader replied. \"Yes, let us attend.\" He gave Balandir a nod. \"I'll be there soon, I promise.\"\n\nBalandir gave a reluctant nod. \"Be safe, then.\"\n\nTogga grinned. \"I always will.\"\n\nTogga turned, and the two of them left the backroom. In the front room, the celebration was already underway. Togga smiled. \"Looks like it's been a hundred years since we've done this.\"\n\nBalandir grunted, but followed behind the orc leader. After a time, the celebration finished, and the two leaders left their seats, before going back to the backroom. Togga and Balandir sat down at the table, and stared each other in the eyes.\n\n\"Why do you think things are like this?\" Togga asked. \"Why are we here, after so many years?\"\n\nBalandir sighed. \"I don't know. I'm just glad things are peaceful, at least.\"\n\nTogga smiled. \"Yes, that's for sure. And I think I know why this alliance was formed. Do you remember that story about the last orc-dwarf war?\"\n\nBalandir nodded. \"I do. It was a very bloody war.\"\n\nTogga nodded. \"Yes, but it ended when the elven kingdom and the human kingdom allied against us. And they attacked the elven kingdom, for some reason. But that didn't stop the alliance, as you know.\"\n\nBalandir laughed. \"I didn't think you were so cunning. But then, why didn't you just wait for the war to end?\"\n\nTogga shrugged. \"I think that would have been for the best. But when you get as old as I am, you stop thinking like that.\"\n\nBalandir shook his head. \"You're too kind to be an orc.\"\n\nTogga grinned. \"I try.\"\n\nThe two of them sat in silence for a moment, before Balandir spoke again. \"Yes, a hundred years is something to celebrate. But if it ends sooner, I won't be too disappointed.\"\n\nTogga laughed. \"I wouldn't expect you to. But that's why we should celebrate it now.\"\n\nThe orc leader grinned. \"Yes, that's for sure.\"\n\nBalandir nodded. \"I'll come out and join you, Togga.\"\n\nTogga nodded. \"Of course. I wouldn't want to celebrate without you.\"\n\nTogga stood up, and stretched his arms. He turned to Balandir. \"Thanks, Balandir. Thanks for being part of this alliance.\"\n\nBalandir smiled. \"Thank you too, Togga. We've saved a lot of lives.\"\n\nTogga smiled. \"I can only hope that we'll be able to do the same for a long time.\"\n\nTogga walked out of the backroom, and towards the celebration. In the backroom, Balandir smiled, as he thought of Togga and the alliance. He thought of his fellow orc, who had become like a son to him, and the life he had built with him. And then, a thought crossed his mind.\n\n\"100 years...\" he thought.\n\nBalandir shook his head. \"No. Togga would never... that would be too cruel.\"\n\nThe two orc guards in the backroom turned to Balandir, and nodded. \"Yes, it would be cruel.\" They stood from their positions, and left the backroom. Balandir looked around the backroom. \"What would I do without you, Togga?\"\n\nBalandir sighed. \"I think you know. But it won't come to that. We've been allies for 99 years, and I'm sure we'll have a few more left.\"\n\nBalandir stood from his chair, and walked to the door of the backroom. He turned back to the room. \"I think you're right, Togga. I'm glad we were able to form this alliance. But I'm even more glad that we're still here to see it through.\"\n\nBalandir turned, and left the backroom. He walked to the celebration, where Togga was celebrating with a large smile. Balandir smiled, and approached Togga.\n\n\"Happy birthday, Togga!\" Balandir"

        "pred_story": "\"Sorry, big fella. I don't have any of those things you're looking for.\" I patted the ancient suit's shoulder, a gesture that made it's mechanical body wobble slightly. \"You're just going to have to keep looking. I don't have any compatible implants, and the parts you're asking for are too advanced for me to fabricate on my own.\"\n\nThe ancient mech's sensors flared, its power surge causing the dust around us to rise up in the dim light. I held a hand over my face, waiting for the cloud to settle.\n\n\"I am a member of the original team,\" it spoke, its voice like thunder. \"I remember the creator of this suit. This is a crucial time in history. My systems are failing. I must find a new pilot.\"\n\nI raised my hands in a calming gesture. \"I'm sorry, old timer. I know this is important. But you have to listen. We were able to replicate the parts needed for a compatible pilot. You're just going to have to get in contact with the team that ran the experiment.\" I pulled out my radio and hit the call button, letting out a sigh as I heard the familiar voice of Dr. Chen.\n\n\"Huahua! I had just gotten to the lab!\" She shouted in my ear. \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"It's an ancient mech suit,\" I explained, holding my hand up to the device to quiet it. \"It's found me in the ruins. I don't know how it got here, but it's found me compatible. It's looking for implants, but it doesn't know if they're still available.\"\n\nI turned to the mech, holding the radio up like a microphone. \"Dr. Chen, it's found me. It says it's from the original team, and its systems are failing. It needs me to find it the implants to become compatible. Do you know where they might be?\"\n\nI waited, watching as the mech's sensors flared again. \"What?\" I asked. \"What?\"\n\nThe mech's body began to twitch and wobble, and I took a step back.\n\n\"I'm sorry, friend.\" Dr. Chen said. \"We failed in replicating the parts. The technology was lost to us. The team was disbanded. They're probably all dead by now.\"\n\nI looked at the mech, wondering how it had found me. \"I'm sorry,\" I said, looking away, unable to meet its gaze.\n\n\"Wait,\" Dr. Chen said. \"It's not impossible to get the technology. I still have all my notes. I can get the team to meet up and work on replicating the implants.\"\n\nI smiled, holding the radio up again. \"Thank you,\" I said, before turning to the mech. \"It's okay. We'll figure something out.\" I put the radio away, looking up at the ancient suit.\n\n\"I do not understand this,\" it spoke, its voice like thunder again. \"You are not in line with my commands. Why are you not taking this seriously?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"You're not exactly giving me much choice,\" I said. \"I know I can't take you up on the offer, but I also know I don't have a choice.\"\n\nThe suit's body twitched again, and I took another step back, its power surge building.\n\n\"It's okay,\" I repeated. \"It's going to be okay. I promise you.\" I placed a hand on its metal shoulder, feeling a strange energy flow from it to me. \"I will find the parts,\" I said, trying to sound confident. \"I will fix your failing systems. But first, I need you to go back to sleep. It's been a long day.\"\n\nThe suit's body relaxed, its power draining as it began to shut down. I waited until its sensors had stopped flaring before reaching out, grabbing the nearby chair and moving it to the side of the suit.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said, sitting down. I wrapped my arms around my head, letting out a sigh as I realized just how tired I was."

        "pred_story": "It's been years since the Great Pandemic, the day the world became a living hell. People ran from the cities, into the wilderness, and that was when the problem became apparent. Most of the people who escaped died shortly after. Some were taken down by a horde of infected, others succumbed to the harsh environment, and many more got into disputes that led to fatalities. People that had nothing to do with the fight over weapons. People who had just wandered into the wrong area.\n\nThe first few years of the pandemic were a mix of chaos and hope. We managed to survive in the wilderness, gathering food and resources. We all shared everything, making sure everyone has enough to live comfortably. But despite that, we lost so many in those years, it was hard to accept that not everyone will make it.\n\nThen one day, I remembered a place that was close to our settlement. I grew up there, in a city with medieval themed theme. There was an armory there, a collection of weapons from medieval era. It was closed to the public, it was only meant for cosplayers. But I was a cosplayer myself. I always loved the history of medieval weapons and armor.\n\nWhen I entered the armory, I saw that some of the weapons and armor were still there. Nothing was missing except for one suit of armor and a large sword. They were probably taken out by some cosplayers. I was not worried, I had enough money to buy those things if they still existed.\n\nI walked around the armory, admiring the artifacts that were still there. They were all beautiful and well preserved, most still in good condition. Some of them were even rare, and I knew some would fetch high prices when I tried to sell them. But first, I had to try them out.\n\nWhen I found the armor, I knew what I had to do. It was too big for me, but I had noticed a few months ago that some cosplayers were using armors meant for people twice their size. They used a combination of fabric and metal to hold the armor in place, and it worked.\n\nI followed the same method, using my knowledge of materials science and engineering to make the armor fit me. I spent two weeks making the armor, making sure it fit me perfectly. It was hot to wear, but it was light, and it would protect me from any attack.\n\nThen I found the sword. It was massive, made from a combination of wood and metal. It weighed a lot, but I could lift it. I had to use a combination of leather straps and wire to tie it to my belt. It was difficult, but I knew that I would need it.\n\nI went back to the settlement, and I told them of my findings. They were skeptical, but when I brought back the armor and the sword, they were amazed. None of them wanted to join me, but one of them decided to.\n\nI named her my apprentice, and together we ventured into the wilderness, searching for other resources. We fought off a few infected, but they were easy to defeat. We even found some supplies that were left by other survivors, and we took some of them for ourselves.\n\nIt was easy to get supplies from abandoned settlements. We didn't fight them, but they still fought us. But we were better prepared, and we defeated them. We even found some cosplayers who had survived in the wilderness, and we helped them. But they were so grateful that they begged us to go back to the city and bring back more supplies.\n\nI knew that this would lead to something big. I knew that soon we would be back to the city, and I was ready to face any threat that would come our way. I knew that the government would be back, and I was ready to fight them.\n\nBut I didn't want to fight them, I wanted to defeat them. I wanted to show them that we were not savages, we were survivors. I wanted to bring back civility to the world. I wanted to show them that we could be civilized again.\n\nIt was the only way I knew how, but I wanted it. And I knew that it would start with us, the cosplayers. We would be the bridge between the past and the future. We would be the bridge between our world and their world.\n\nI knew that this would be difficult. I knew that it would take time. But I was ready to do it. I was ready to show the world that we could be civilized again. I was ready to fight for it.\n\nWe had been back in the city for a few months now, and the supplies that we brought were being distributed among the people. We had managed to establish order, and we were making progress.\n\nSome of the cosplayers had found their old jobs, or started new ones. Some had started families of their own. But we still had work to do. We still had to convince the government that we were not a threat. We still had to show them that we were not savages.\n\nI knew that this would not be easy, but I was ready to do it. I was ready to make them understand that we were not a threat. I was ready to show them that we were not savages. I was ready to fight for it.\n\nAnd I knew that I wouldn't be alone. My apprentice had joined me, and many more had followed her. We had formed a small army of cosplayers, and together we were unstoppable.\n\nI knew that this would lead to something big. I knew that soon we would be facing off against the government. I was ready to face them. I was ready to fight for what was right. I was ready to make them understand that we were not savages.\n\nI was ready to make them understand that we were not a threat. I was ready to show them that we were not a threat. I was ready to fight for it."

        "pred_story": "It was just another day, just another day like all the others. The kind of day where you don't even think about the existence of gods, the kind of day where you don't even think about the nature of divinity. The kind of day where everything seems perfectly normal, where life is just life, where life isn't the most amazing, terrifying, profound and overwhelming experience you can have.\n\nIn fact, it was so normal that I was just going about my day, going about my life, going about my tasks, all of it perfectly mundane. I was in the kitchen, boiling a pot of water, making a cup of tea, when the doorbell rang.  \n\nMy mind went blank for a moment, wondering who it could be. My friend? I didn't expect them at this time of day, but maybe I had forgotten about something. A delivery? That wasn't possible. But then again, I had forgotten to pay for a delivery service last week, and I had assumed they would have to get a note from me, but what if they had just sent it? I went to open the door.\n\nI went to open the door. And there, there on the porch, there was a person, a young woman, with an expectant look on her face. It was a look I saw often, but not often enough. She was waiting for something. She was waiting for something. For me. \n\nShe smiled at me, her eyes bright, her eyes shining with expectation. \"Hi!\" She said, her voice full of warmth. \"Are you...\"\n\nShe stopped there, and I could see her weighing her words, weighing her words. But of course, she didn't have to say them. I saw her eyes widen, I saw her expression change. I saw her mouth open, and I saw her say it.  \n\n\"You're my god,\" she said.\n\nMy heart skipped a beat. She was my follower. It was the moment, the one moment, the moment I had always hoped for. The moment that I had never expected to happen. \n\n\"Thank you,\" I said. \"Thank you.\"\n\nIt was the best thing I had ever heard. I opened the door, and she walked in. We talked, my follower and I, about everything and nothing. We talked about how she had been my follower, how she had been following me for years. She had been following me for years, but she hadn't known it was me. I had been following my own rules, making it as easy or as hard as I wanted it to be. And now I had made it easy. I had made it easy. I had made it easy for her to follow me.\n\nI made her a cup of tea, and we sat down in the living room. We talked about everything, about the world, about life, about death. We talked about everything. She talked about everything, and I listened. And I talked. And she listened. We talked about everything, and it was nice. It was nice.\n\nAnd then she left. She said goodbye, and she left. And I was left here, with this realization. I was left here, with the realization that I was a god. I was a god. I was a god. It was funny. The realization felt strange. It felt strange. It felt strange. And then it felt familiar. It felt familiar. It felt familiar. It felt like something I had always known. It felt like something I had always known. It felt like something I had always known.\n\nI went back to my tea, and drank it. I sat back down on the couch, and I sighed. I sighed, and I smiled. I smiled, and I smiled again. I smiled. I was a god. I was a god. I was a god. It was funny. It was funny."

        "pred_story": "\u201cHold on!\u201d the wizard said, waving his hand. \u201cNot so quick.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d The rogue asked, already pulling the lever.\n\nThe wizard\u2019s hand moved with supernatural speed, stopping the lever mere millimeters from turning. \u201cThat\u2019s the door to the treasure room. And it\u2019s locked by a magical lock. You can\u2019t open it with your strength. You\u2019ll pull the door off its hinges, and probably kill us both in the process.\u201d\n\n\u201cMagic can stop a falling boulder,\u201d the rogue pointed out.\n\n\u201cYeah, but only because I\u2019m in the way,\u201d the wizard said dryly. \u201cThis lock is too heavy for me to break, and if I tried to lift it, it would crush me like an insect. It\u2019s a trap, set by the ancient necromancer who made the treasure room. And if you trigger the lever, it\u2019ll lock you in, making you fight your way out against impossible odds.\u201d The wizard turned to look at the rest of the party. \u201cI know we all want to get the treasure, but this is one risk we don\u2019t have to take.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d the barbarian asked, scratching his stomach through the fur and leather. \u201cWhy not just cast a spell?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I told you, the lock has a magic spell on it that will prevent me from casting a spell to break it.\u201d The wizard\u2019s hand moved again, stopping the rogue\u2019s dagger from cutting the rope. \u201cYou can\u2019t push, pull, or climb to get across. And if you try to use a rope, this will kill us all.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, so what do we do?\u201d The rogue asked. \u201cCan we go back up?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d the wizard said. \u201cThe door we came in through is locked. And even if it wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s twenty floors up. We\u2019d never make it before they catch us and kill us.\u201d\n\nThe barbarian looked around, before his eyes fell on the wall on the side of the room. He walked over to it, looking at it from top to bottom, before he sat down, picking up a piece of chalk from his belt and starting to draw on the wall. \u201cHow about this?\u201d He asked, showing the wizard the diagram. \u201cWe can tunnel through the wall. It\u2019s a better way.\u201d\n\nThe wizard looked at the barbarian\u2019s drawing. \u201cI don\u2019t see how you think that would work,\u201d he said.\n\nThe barbarian shrugged. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like they\u2019d expect us to do something that obvious, right?\u201d He said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than trying to use magic, since it could fail. And it\u2019s not like it could get worse, since it\u2019s just us against a wall. And it\u2019s better than using the rope, since it\u2019s safer. And it\u2019s better than pushing the door, since it won\u2019t break. It\u2019s better than pulling the lever, since it won\u2019t lock us in. And it\u2019s better than climbing up, since we can\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBesides,\u201d the barbarian added, \u201cthere\u2019s a couple of them walking around the floor. If we climb up, they\u2019ll catch us. If we push the door, it\u2019ll kill us. If we pull the lever, it\u2019ll lock us in. But if we dig through, they won\u2019t think of it.\u201d\n\nThe wizard looked at his friend, then at the drawing. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too thin. We can\u2019t dig fast enough. And even if we did, it would collapse, crushing us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the barbarian said. \u201cSo we need to dig fast. That\u2019s why I drew the diagram. It\u2019s a way to dig faster.\u201d\n\nThe wizard looked at the diagram again. \u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEach hole is only half a meter in diameter,\u201d the barbarian explained. \u201cBut we can dig one hole every two meters, and use a pulley to lift the dirt out. It\u2019ll only take us an hour, even with the dirt slowing us down. But we can do it faster than the others make their rounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the barbarian said. \u201cWe need to dig fast. But it\u2019s safer.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d the wizard said. \u201cBut what about the traps?\u201d\n\nThe barbarian shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t see any. If there\u2019s a trap, it\u2019ll be the first thing to get triggered. But there\u2019s nothing.\u201d He looked at the wizard. \u201cSo what do you say? Want to dig?\u201d\n\nThe wizard looked at the barbarian, at the rogue, and at the barbarian again. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d"

        "pred_story": "The forest was quiet. No children laughing in its presence, no dogs barking or playing in its meadows, no birds chirping in its trees. The only noise you could hear was the leaves rustling softly in the wind, and the soft flow of the river as it made its way across the floor of the forest. It was a peaceful place, especially during the night, when you were alone, and the moon was high in the sky.\n\nThe night air was crisp, filled with the scent of flowers and herbs that grew in the forest, and the smell of the river, whose waters were filled with fish and other creatures. The moonlight cast long shadows on the forest floor, making it seem even more peaceful than it really was. The trees were tall, their branches stretching up to the sky, blocking out all light. The forest floor was a mix of dirt and plants, the grasses and wildflowers growing there swaying in the wind. The forest had many paths, each one winding through the forest, each one leading to something different. Some led to streams and rivers, others to the homes of the creatures that lived in the forest, and still others to the homes of the humans who lived nearby.\n\nThe forest was a place of magic, a place where humans could come to find peace, and the creatures of the forest could come to be free from the world of humans. It was a place where magic thrived, and where the spirits of the forest were strong.\n\nIn the center of the forest, there was a cottage, a cozy little home made of sticks and leaves. The cottage was surrounded by plants and flowers, and was filled with the soft glow of candles and lanterns. Smoke curled out of the chimney, carrying with it the scent of cooking food. Inside the cottage, there was a woman, her dark hair tied back in a braid, her eyes shining with a warm golden light. She was humming a soft tune as she cooked, her hands moving with practiced ease as she stirred the pot and added a pinch of this, and a dash of that.\n\nThe woman was a witch, a wise woman who knew everything that happened in the forest. She knew the secrets of the creatures who lived there, and she knew the ways of the forest. She knew its paths, and its dangers, and she knew the way to its magic. She was respected by all, and she kept their secrets, knowing that they would one day be revealed to her.\n\nThe witch looked up as she heard a noise coming from outside the cottage, and she smiled as she saw a young woman standing in the forest, looking at the cottage with a mix of fear and curiosity in her eyes. The witch sighed, and she finished cooking her dinner before she went outside to greet the girl. The girl was trembling slightly as the witch approached her, but she did not run. She looked into the witch's eyes, and saw the kindness and understanding that shone there, and she knew that she had come to the right place.\n\n\u201cHello little one, I am so glad that you have come,\u201d the witch said, as she put a gentle hand on the girl's shoulder. \u201cTell me, why did you come here?\u201d\n\nThe girl swallowed hard, and then she began to explain, telling the witch of her dreams, and of the visions that had haunted her since she was a child. She told of the visions of the forest, and of the magic that lay there, and of the witch that lived in the forest, who could teach her the secrets of the forest and the magic that lay within. The witch listened, her eyes shining with understanding and kindness as the girl spoke.\n\n\u201cYour visions are correct, you are here to learn the secrets of the forest, and its magic,\u201d the witch said, as she smiled. \u201cBut first, we must eat, and rest, for tomorrow will be a long day.\u201d\n\nThe witch led the girl to the cottage, where she was fed and bathed. She was given a room to sleep in, where she rested easily, knowing that she was safe, and that she would be taught the secrets of the forest and its magic.\n\nThe next morning, the witch woke the girl early, and she led her out of the cottage and into the forest. The girl followed the witch as she led her along a winding path, one that took them deeper and deeper into the forest, until they reached a clearing. In the center of the clearing, there was a great oak tree, one that was taller than any other tree in the forest. The witch stopped in front of the tree, and she looked up at it with a sad expression.\n\n\u201cThis is a place of great magic,\u201d the witch said, as she looked up at the tree. \u201cBut it is also a place of great danger. The spirits of the forest are strong here, and they are not to be trifled with. If you wish to learn their secrets, you must first prove yourself worthy.\u201d\n\nThe girl nodded, and the witch smiled. \u201cThen let us begin,\u201d she said, as she stepped back, and raised her hands to the sky. \u201cCall upon the spirits, and ask for their help.\u201d\n\nThe girl looked at the tree, and she felt a surge of energy flow through her. She raised her hands, and she called upon the spirits of the forest, asking for their help, and their guidance. The witch smiled, and she began to chant, her voice growing louder, and more powerful, as she spoke. The air around her began to glow, and the girl felt a surge of energy flow through her, one that filled her with a sense of wonder, and magic.\n\nThe girl looked up at the tree, and she saw a glow emanating from it, a glow that grew brighter, and brighter, until it was like a fire in the sky. The girl felt a surge of energy, one that filled her with a sense of wonder, and magic, and she knew that she had been given a great gift. She was filled with the magic of the forest, and with its secrets. She knew the way to the tree, and she knew the dangers that lay along its path. She knew the secrets of the forest, and its magic, and she knew that she would always be able to return to the witch, and to learn more.\n\nThe girl thanked the witch, and the witch smiled. \u201cYou have been given a great gift, one that I am glad to have shared with you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut remember, the magic of the forest is a gift that must be used wisely. It is a powerful thing, and it must be treated with respect.\u201d\n\nThe girl nodded, and the witch smiled. \u201cThen go, little one, and remember that I am always here to help you, and to guide you, if you need it.\u201d\n\nThe girl thanked the witch, and she left the clearing, returning to the cottage, where she was given food and drink, and where she rested for the rest of the day. The next day, the witch taught the girl more about the forest, and its magic. She taught her of its secrets, and of the dangers that lay along its paths. The girl listened, and she learned, and she knew that she had been given a great gift."

        "pred_story": "So, you're immortal. I know, I know, it's not *technically* immortal, you've been killed loads of times, but still, you're still walking around so that's cool. \n\nI'm not really a fan of immortals, but you've made some good choices recently, so I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt. \n\nSo, how did you die this time? Another car accident? \n\nNope. \n\nA drowning accident? \n\nNope. \n\nYou actually died when you were 17 years old and you were shot by a dude in a white robe with a cross. \n\nYou've been dead in the most boring way possible. \n\nI hate you so much. \n\nI know you're not actually dead though, so stop pretending you are. You just decided to take a break from life, that's cool, but stop saying you're dead. \n\nI'm still waiting for you to wake up, so if you're out there, I hope you're happy being the only immortal from 1986. I'm still not giving you any gifts, and I'm not going to start playing Dungeons and Dragons with you until you acknowledge that being a wizard is stupid. \n\nI'm also not going to let you join my fantasy football league until you admit that being the oldest wizard ever is cool. \n\nI'm actually very jealous of you, but I'm still not going to give you any gifts, you don't deserve any, since you don't think that immortals should exist. \n\nI'm also going to take your spot in the fantasy football league, and I'm going to make sure that I'm the most successful immortal wizard, since I know that I can do better than you. \n\nI'm also going to make sure that I'm not just the oldest wizard ever, but I'm also going to be the greatest wizard that ever lived. \n\nYou're probably still thinking about how old you're getting, and how being immortal is more of a curse than a blessing. \n\nYou should've just enjoyed being 17, and you should've never made any decisions for yourself. \n\nYou should've never chosen to be a wizard in the first place. \n\nYou should've never tried to be more than just a regular 17 year old boy. \n\nYou should've never chosen to be born in the middle of the 20th century. \n\nYou should've just been born in ancient times, like the Middle Ages or something. \n\nBut you didn't, and now you're stuck being immortal. \n\nYou should've been stuck in ancient times, where life was short, and there were very few opportunities. \n\nBut you weren't, you were born in 1986, and you didn't just live a normal life, you chose to make yourself into a wizard. \n\nYou should've never made that choice. \n\nI'm so jealous of you right now. \n\nI'm actually happy that you're not here, because you make me so jealous. \n\nI'm really hoping that you don't come back, because that would mean that you've been a better wizard than me. \n\nThat would be really disappointing. \n\nSo, stay dead, I mean, don't come back, and don't try to come back. \n\nI'm going to start my fantasy football league, and I'm going to make sure that I'm the most successful immortal wizard that ever lived. \n\nYou're probably going to be very disappointed. \n\nYou should've never made that choice. \n\nIf you're watching me, you should've never made the choice to be born in the 20th century. \n\nYou should've never tried to be a wizard. \n\nYou should've just been born in ancient times, where life was very short. \n\nThat would've been so much better for you."

        "pred_story": "The three of us stood at the base of the mountain we were going to climb and, with a look to our companion, we all gave a thumbs up. The wind was cold and it was clear this would be a very difficult climb. It was the first day of the year and we were a party of four going to ascend Mount Wuyi. A trip of 72 hours.  \n \nWe all knew it was a difficult one but it was a challenge we were all eager to take on. The cold wind howled on us as we began to climb up the mountain. We had no gear, no map and no food. We had nothing except each other and we knew the challenge we were about to take. But still we were all set.  \n \nAs we were climbing up the mountain, the air was getting thinner and thinner. We were all wearing masks but it was hard to catch our breath. We knew we had to slow down and climb as slow as we could. After three hours of climbing, we had to stop. We stopped to take a break.  \n \nThe sun was high in the sky and we were all exhausted. We were all sweating, and the wind was blowing hard. We all had to sit down and catch our breath. There were no clouds in the sky, and the sun was shining bright. The wind was strong and it was hard to stand.  \n \nAfter resting for a while, we continued to climb up the mountain. We climbed up and up and up until the sun began to set. As the sun went down, we began to lose our way. We had to stop again and rest. We had to put up a tent to camp for the night. But there was a problem.  \n \nAs we were setting up the tent, we heard the roar of a beast. The ground began to shake and the mountain began to tremble. It was massive. The beast was huge. We all knew this was no ordinary beast. It was a giant beast. It was a beast of the mountain.  \n \nWe all froze in fear. It was our first time seeing such a massive beast. We were all scared. It was climbing up the mountain and was closing in on us. We all froze as it approached us. The beast was a giant serpent. Its body was massive and its head was like a snake. It was so massive and terrifying.  \n \nThe three of us were all frozen in fear. We knew this was the end of us. The serpent was closing in on us. We could see it clearly and we were frozen in fear. We knew this was the end of us.  \n \nBut then a voice echoed in our mind. \"Don't be afraid, I'm not here to hurt you.\" The voice was clear and calm. We were all shocked and didn't know what to do. \"Why?\" We replied.  \n \n\"You are not here to cause any harm. You are just here to challenge yourselves. And I'm here to test you. And I'm not going to hurt you. And I will spare you if you can pass my test.\" The voice was clear and calm. We all were amazed and were curious. \"How?\" We all asked.  \n \nThe beast roared in laughter. \"I will show you how. You will have to face a challenge. And if you can pass, I will spare you.\" The beast spoke. \"First, we have to climb up this mountain. But this is the easy part. You can climb up the mountain if you want. But the mountain is very steep and the air is thin.\" The beast spoke. \"Then, we have to go through a cave. The cave is full of snakes and bats. It is dark, cold and damp. And you have to go through it fast.\" The beast spoke. \"Then, we have to jump down from the cave. The jump is long and it is high. And we have to jump to the right spot.\" The beast spoke. \"Then, we have to climb down a tree. The tree is very steep and it is slippery.\" The beast spoke. \"Finally, we have to cross a river. The river is cold and it is deep. And we have to cross it carefully.\" The beast spoke.  \n \nThe four of us all stood in shock. This was an impossible challenge. We all looked at each other and knew we had to do it. We all knew this was a challenge we had to take. The four of us all stood up and began to climb up the mountain. We climbed up and up until we reached the cave. We all knew this was the easy part.  \n \nWe all stood at the entrance of the cave and looked at each other. We knew this was the part where we had to be careful. We all knew it was dark, cold and damp inside the cave. We all took a deep breath and entered the cave. It was dark, cold and damp inside the cave. There were snakes and bats all over. We all knew we had to go through it fast.  \n \nWe all ran and ran until we reached the end of the cave. We all stopped and took a deep breath. We had made it through the cave. It was a difficult part. But we had made it through.  \n \nWe all stood at the end of the cave and looked at each other. We knew this was the part where we had to jump down. The jump was long and it was high. We all looked at each other and knew we had to do it. We all stood at the edge of the cave and looked down. It was a long and steep jump.  \n \nWe all looked at each other and knew we had to jump. We all closed our eyes and jumped. It was a long and steep jump. We all knew we had to be careful. We had to jump to the right spot. We all opened our eyes and saw we had made it.  \n \nWe all stood at the bottom of the cave and looked at each other. We knew this was the part where we had to climb. We knew it was a steep and slippery climb. But we all knew we had to do it. We all looked at each other and knew we had to do it. We all stood at the base of the tree and looked up. It was steep and slippery.  \n \nWe all looked at each other and knew we had to climb. We all closed our eyes and climbed up. It was a steep and slippery climb. We all knew we had to be careful. We all opened our eyes and saw we had made it.  \n \nWe all stood at the top of the tree and looked at each other.

        "pred_story": "So the world was saved for the umpteenth time. The villain was defeated, the city was saved, and as soon as it was all over the news was saying how the villain was lucky because it was only a hero who saved the day. Lucky? That was rich.\n\nThe villain, was a man who had stolen a bomb from an armed forces base. He had threatened to detonate the bomb in the middle of the city and kill everyone. It was one of those situations where a hero had to save the day to stop the bomb from going off and killing thousands of innocent people.\n\nThe hero saved the day by destroying the bomb with an arrow shot out of a bow. He was a good hero, no one could deny that, but when you look at it, it was a pretty ridiculous situation. The hero had saved thousands of lives, but he had still managed to kill a lot of people. The hero was in the building right behind the bomb, and he had been forced to blast it out of the building. \n\nThe explosion was pretty big, and the building had been destroyed. So even though the hero had saved the day, he had still destroyed a building, killed thousands of people, and left thousands more homeless. The news was still talking about it, and how lucky the city was that it had been saved.\n\nBut some people weren't so lucky.\n\nAs the news talked about the hero saving the day, a group of people were breaking into a house on the other side of the city. The people in the group were the ones who had been responsible for the city's downfall. They had been a part of a terrorist organization, and they had been working together to take down the city. They had been successful, the city was now in shambles.\n\nThe people in the group had been in the city for a week, and they had been taking advantage of the hero's absence. They had been stealing from people, robbing homes, and murdering those who got in their way. They had been able to get away with it because the city was still in shock from the bombing.\n\nAs the people in the group entered the home, one of them noticed a light coming from upstairs. The person looked at the others and said, \"Do you hear that?\" They all looked up at the stairs, and one of them said, \"Do you smell that?\" The group all looked at each other, and one of them said, \"Oh my god, we're not alone.\" They all screamed and started running away from the stairs.\n\nAs they ran, they heard footsteps coming from the upstairs. The footsteps were heavy, and the group knew that they were not a match for whoever was coming down the stairs. They were running for their lives, and they knew that they would be dead if they got caught.\n\nThe people in the group kept running, and they were able to get out of the house. They all ran to the car that they had been using, and they were able to get in. They were able to drive away from the house, and they were able to get away from the hero.\n\nAs they drove away, they knew that they would be caught sooner or later. They had been able to get away with their crimes, but they knew that it would only be a matter of time before the hero caught up with them. The hero had saved the day, but he had still managed to get away.\n\nThe people in the group drove for a while, and they were able to get out of the city. They had been able to get away from the hero, and they knew that they would be safe for a little while. They had been able to get away, but they knew that they would be caught sooner or later.\n\nAs they drove, they all looked at each other. They knew that they would be caught, and they knew that they would be punished for their crimes. They were all scared, and they knew that their time was coming to an end.\n\nBut it was coming too soon.\n\nAs they were driving, they saw a light coming from up ahead. The light was bright, and it was shining off the road. The people in the group looked at each other, and one of them said, \"Oh my god, it's the hero.\" The group all screamed and started to panic.\n\nAs they panicked, the light became brighter. It was so bright that they were unable to see anything. The group all screamed and started to run, but it was too late.\n\nThe group was driving into the light, and they were unable to see what was ahead. They were driving into a beam of light that was so bright that it blinded them. They were unable to see what was coming towards them, and they were unable to stop.\n\nAs they drove into the light, they saw a flash of red light coming from their right. The light was going so fast, and it was unable to be avoided. The group saw the light coming towards them, but they were unable to do anything.\n\nThe group was unable to stop, and they were unable to go off the road. They were unable to do anything except watch as the light went through their car. They all saw a flash of red light come through the window, and they were unable to breathe.\n\nThe group all watched as the light went through their car. They all saw the light go through their bodies, and they were unable to breathe. The group all died instantly, and they were unable to see the light come through the car.\n\nThe light continued on, and it was able to see everything. The light was able to see the inside of the car, and it was able to see the people inside. The light was able to see the people inside the car, and it was able to see that they were dead.\n\nThe light continued on, and it was able to see the city behind the car. The light was able to see the city that had been in ruins, and it was able to see the people who were still alive. The light was able to see the people who were still alive, and it was able to see that they were scared.\n\nThe light continued on, and it was able to see the world behind the city. The light was able to see the world that had been in chaos, and it was able to see the people who were still alive. The light was able to see the people who were still alive, and it was able to see that they were scared.\n\nThe light continued on, and it was able to see the hero who had saved the day. The light was able to see the hero who had saved the day, and it was able to see that he was gone. The light was able to see the hero who had saved the day, and it was able to see that he was nowhere to be found.\n\nThe light was able to see the hero who had saved the day, and it was able to see that he was gone.

I have the power to grant wishes and do not know what you mean, I have nothing to be humble about. I have done nothing with my life.\u201d A tear dropped from his eye and fell to the floor.\n\nMy friend sighed and said, \u201cI know you do not want to admit it, but you have done something special, and I know it if you do not.\u201d He stood and walked over to the genie and placed his hand on his shoulder and said, \u201cListen, I know that you do not think you have done anything with your life, but you are wrong. I have come to realize this now that I am older. Your power is not something you can be humbled about. It is a gift that you should hold on to and use it to make the world a better place.\u201d He paused and looked at the genie with tears in his eyes and said, \u201cYou are a good man, and I know that you will do something special with your life. It is hard to do something special with a gift like this. You are not like a lot of people. You are a good person and I am sure that you will be able to make a difference with it.\u201d\n\nThe genie looked up at him and said, \u201cI do not understand what you are saying, I am but a genie, and I have done nothing special with my life. I have only wished for things that people have told me to wish for. I have done as I have been told and have not done anything special with my life.\u201d He looked around the room and said, \u201cI have only been here for a few days, but I have come to realize how useless my existence is.\u201d\n\nMy friend walked over to the genie and looked him in the eyes and said, \u201cNo, you have done more with your life than you realize. You have done things that no one else can. You have made my life better, and I am sure that you have done the same for a lot of other people. You are a kind soul, and you have a special gift, you are a good person.\u201d The genie looked around the room, and tears fell from his eyes.\n\nMy friend walked over to the genie and picked up a small white tablet and looked at it and said, \u201cWe have been tracking your location for months, and we have come to realize that you are not like most genies. You are kind, and you do not wish for things that you want. You wish for things that will make people happy. You are a good man, and we are sure that you will make a difference with your life.\u201d The genie looked at him and said, \u201cI do not understand, why are you saying this? Why are you telling me this? Why are you being so kind to me?\u201d\n\nMy friend picked up a small white tablet and said, \u201cWe have been tracking your location for months. We know your name, and we know that you have been around for a long time. We know that you have made people happy, and that you are a kind soul. We know that you have a special gift, and that you have used it to make the world a better place.\u201d The genie looked at him and said, \u201cWhat do you mean? You are telling me that I am not like other genies? I have never heard of you. I thought that I was the only genie in the world.\u201d\n\nMy friend sat on the floor and looked at the genie and said, \u201cWe have been watching you for a long time. We have come to realize that you are not like other genies. You are kind, and you have a special gift. We want to make sure that you do not wish for anything that will make you unhappy. We want to make sure that you are happy and that you can use your gift to make the world a better place.\u201d The genie looked at him and said, \u201cI do not understand. Why are you being so kind to me? Why are you talking to me in this way? I have never met anyone like you.\u201d\n\nMy friend looked at the genie and said, \u201cI am not being kind to you, I am being kind to myself.

In fact, it was grasslands. Last year, it was grasslands. Why is there a... a... city here?\" He asked.\n\n\"I am not sure, prince. But I can go and see,\" She said.\n\n\"No, go and come back.

There is a city here. And the elves who are here, are human.\"\n\n\"What?!\" He cried. \"That is impossible. I will not believe it. Take me to the elven lord.\" He said.\n\nKellia nodded, and led the prince to the elven lord's palace. The prince was in a state of pure shock. He didn't know what to do. \n\nThey arrived at the palace and the lord stepped out. He was old. Even older than the prince. \"Ah, prince Harlon. So good to see you. I understand you are confused as to why there is a city here. Well, let me tell you. It is because I know you are not coming back.\"\n\nThe prince was shocked. \"How did you know?!\" He asked.\n\n\"Ah. The prince Harlon is coming back. And the elves are going to be here.\" The elven lord answered. \n\n\"I... I... But we were not supposed to be here!\" The prince stammered.\n\n\"Ah, yes. And that is why there is a city here. Because I know you will be here. And I will make sure this city will be well taken care of. As it should be.\" The elven lord said. \n\nThe prince smiled. \"But how do you know this?!\"\n\n\"Ah. The elven lord knows. The prince Harlon is coming back.\" The elven lord said.\n\nThe prince was in shock again. \"I... I...

The prince was in shock, still trying to understand. \n\nBut he knew that he would be back."

        "pred_story": "I have to admit, as the Dark Knight of Shadows, that is the first time I\u2019ve been caught off guard like that.\n\nThe Dark Knight of Shadows was the name given to me when I first created the Shadow Blade. A black sword that shines with an ominous red glow. My name is not known to anyone in the Kingdom as I operate from the shadows, striking fear in anyone who hears about my exploits.\n\nThis one however, was an amateur compared to the others I have dealt with. \n\nI had to wait until he tried to use his magic to cast a fireball at me. As soon as he did, I struck his arm with a swift strike from my shadow blade. It had the desired effect as he had fallen to the ground, his arm severed. The other mages stopped their attacks and stepped back, looking at each other. \n\nThe leader, that pathetic excuse of a mage, was kneeling on the ground. His eyes widened as he looked at his severed arm, then at me.\n\n\u201cHa! Kneel before me puny wielder of light! In the darkness your power means nothing! HOW ARE YOU GLOWING?!\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t hesitate. I took a step forward and unsheathed my shadow blade, bringing it down onto his neck. He managed to roll away just in time to avoid the death blow. As he did, he released a dark energy from his severed arm, hitting me.\n\nThe energy shot right through me, leaving me unharmed. I couldn\u2019t help but grin at his failure.\n\n\u201cYou call that a dark energy? That was barely enough to hurt me.\u201d\n\nI approached him, my shadow blade shining with red light. He looked at me with a nervous look, then looked at his severed arm. He didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\u201cPlease! Spare me! I beg of you! I\u2019ll never use my dark magic again!\u201d\n\nI laughed at his words. \u201cYou\u2019ll never use your dark magic again? You\u2019ve been using it since you were a child! Why would I believe that?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me with a terrified look, \u201cI... I promise! I\u2019ll never use it again! I\u2019ll join the light magic side! I\u2019ll be a good mage! Please spare me!\u201d\n\nI laughed again. \u201cYou\u2019ll never change. The only thing you know is dark magic. It\u2019s a part of who you are.\u201d\n\nThe other mages were looking at me in horror. Their leader was trying to reach for his severed arm, but he couldn\u2019t. I approached him and held out my shadow blade. He took it and held it to his neck.\n\n\u201cPlease! You can\u2019t kill me! I need my severed arm! I need to heal!\u201d\n\nI smiled at his desperation. \u201cI can\u2019t help you with that. If you want to join the light magic side, you\u2019ll have to join me.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me with confusion. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nI looked at my shadow blade, the red glow shining brighter. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you how to use the Shadow Blade. It\u2019s a powerful sword that can bring anyone under my control. The red glow is the dark energy of the sword. It\u2019s what gives me my powers.\u201d\n\nHe looked at the sword with confusion. \u201cWhat? Why would I want to use a sword that has a red glow?\u201d\n\nI looked at him with a grin. \u201cBecause with the red glow, you\u2019ll be able to take control of anyone! You\u2019ll be able to rule the kingdom!\u201d\n\nI could see the greed in his eyes as he looked at the shadow blade. He was tempted.\n\n\u201cPlease! Let me try!\u201d\n\nI smiled at his words. \u201cI want to see if you\u2019re worthy to wield the Shadow Blade. Take my shadow blade and hold it out to your other mages.\u201d\n\nHe took the shadow blade and held it out to his other mages. As soon as they touched the shadow blade, they all fell under my control. The leader didn\u2019t know what was happening to them.\n\nI looked at him with a smile, \u201cYou see? I knew you would be worthy of the Shadow Blade. Now, join me and we\u2019ll take over the kingdom!\u201d\n\nHe looked at the other mages as they fell to their knees, bowing to me.\n\n\u201cI... I don\u2019t know if I can control them.\u201d\n\nI laughed at his words. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be controlling them from now on. All you need to do is carry out the commands. Now, let\u2019s go and see the king.\u201d\n\nWe left the scene of battle and made our way to the king\u2019s castle. The kingdom was on high alert, but we were able to bypass their guards easily. We reached the king\u2019s chambers and I could see the fear in his eyes. \n\nThe leader looked at me with confusion, \u201cHow do you know the king?\u201d \n\nI smiled at him, \u201cMy powers are not limited to just the shadows. I have a vast knowledge of the kingdom. Now, kill the king!\u201d\n\nI could see the king\u2019s eyes widen in horror. \u201cNo! Please! You\u2019re not going to kill me!\u201d\n\nThe leader tried to bring his shadow blade down, but I caught his arm.\n\n\u201cNo! You\u2019re not going to kill him! I\u2019m taking over the kingdom. He\u2019ll be useful as a hostage.\u201d\n\nI looked at the king and smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my friend. You\u2019ll be able to live in peace once the darkness has passed. For now, keep your mouth shut and enjoy the show.\u201d\n\nI turned to the leader, \u201cNow, let\u2019s go and find the royal treasure. That will be the first step towards our domination of the kingdom.\u201d\n\nThe leader nodded and followed me out of the king\u2019s chambers. We left the king and his guards behind."

And we will help each other, and we will be there for each other. And we will be the same, and we will be in harmony. And we will all be people, different people, but all the same. And we will all live in harmony, and we will all be kind to each other. And we will all help each other, and we will all be there for each other.\u201d\n\nThe Elves, Dwarves, and Dark Elves smiled, as they looked at the Fire Giant. They were all happy, they were all smiling. And they all knew that they would live in harmony, that they would be kind to each other, and that they would all help each other. And they knew that they would all be in harmony, that they would all be the same. And they knew that they would all be people, different people, but all the same."

        "pred_story": "The lights are out. The ship is frozen. The silence is suffocating. My heart is pounding, but I can\u2019t hear my chest, I can\u2019t hear my breathing. I can\u2019t hear myself. The darkness is all around me, like a living thing, a thing that feels and senses. I can\u2019t move. My limbs are numb, unresponsive. The cryopods are set into the walls of the ship\u2019s hull, row upon row. My own pod is empty, its door open, its occupant missing.\n\n\u201cWarning,\u201d the ship says. \u201cSystems corrupted by unknown entityyyy.\u201d\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nIt means something is here. Something is watching. Something is waiting.\n\nThe ship\u2019s lights flicker on, casting shadows around me. I blink, but my eyes are dry, my vision cloudy. It takes me a few moments to focus. I look around the cryopod chamber, the room where the ship\u2019s passengers were frozen for the journey. The room is a mess. Cryopods are torn open, their occupants removed. Some of the pods are damaged, their transparent walls cracked, their occupants frozen, unmoving.\n\nI try to move, but my body doesn\u2019t obey. My muscles are frozen, paralyzed. I try to cry out, but my mouth doesn\u2019t open, my voice unheard.\n\nThe ship\u2019s computer speaks again, its voice distorted, warped. \u201cSystems corrupted by unknown entityyyy.\u201d\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nIt means something is here. Something is watching. Something is waiting.\n\nSuddenly, the chamber shakes. The cryopods rattle, their occupants rattling inside. I try to move, to stand, to flee, but my body doesn\u2019t respond. I\u2019m trapped, paralyzed, helpless.\n\nThe ship lurches again, throwing me against the side of the cryopod. I feel a crack, a splinter of glass forming in the pod\u2019s window. I look around, desperate to see what\u2019s happening.\n\nThe chamber is filling with water. The ship\u2019s walls are cracked, leaking a cold, dark liquid into the room. The cryopods are submerging, filling with water. The ship is sinking.\n\nI try to move, to stand, to flee, but my body doesn\u2019t respond. I\u2019m trapped, paralyzed, helpless.\n\nSuddenly, the cryopod opens, its door sliding up with a hiss. Water rushes in, flooding the chamber. I\u2019m lifted out of the pod, falling through the water. I try to grab the sides of the pod, to hold on, but it\u2019s too late. I\u2019m falling, falling, falling.\n\nMy body hits the floor, hard. I groan, feeling the shock of the impact. I try to move, to stand, to look around, but my body doesn\u2019t respond. I\u2019m still paralyzed, helpless.\n\nThe chamber is empty, the room a mess. The cryopods are empty, their occupants missing. I look around, desperate to see what happened.\n\nThe ship\u2019s walls are cracked, leaking water. The floor is slick with it, making it difficult to stand. I look around, trying to see what happened to the other passengers.\n\nI don\u2019t see any of them. I don\u2019t see anyone.\n\nBut then, I see a foot. A small foot, pink and wrinkled. A child\u2019s foot, barely visible through the water.\n\nI move towards the foot, my muscles finally responding. I push through the water, my hands reaching out to touch the foot.\n\nI wrap my fingers around it, feeling the heat of the body. The foot is warm, despite the cold water. I lift the foot, holding it in my hands.\n\n\u201cHelp,\u201d a voice says.\n\nI look up, seeing a child clinging to the side of the ship. She\u2019s a young girl, no more than ten years old. She\u2019s wet, cold, and shivering. I try to move towards her, to reach out, but the water is too deep.\n\n\u201cHelp,\u201d she says again. \u201cPlease. I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d\n\nI look at her, seeing the fear in her eyes. I try to speak, to tell her that everything will be okay, but my voice doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019m still frozen, paralyzed.\n\nThe girl looks down at me, seeing my immobile body. She looks at my face, my eyes, my mouth. She sees that I\u2019m trying to communicate, but my body won\u2019t obey.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, finally finding my voice.\n\nThe girl looks at me, seeing the words on my lips. She looks at my body, seeing that I\u2019m still paralyzed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I say again. \u201cPlease. I want to help you.\u201d\n\nThe girl looks at me, seeing the desperation in my eyes. She looks at my body, seeing that I\u2019m still immobile.\n\nShe reaches out, grabbing my wrist. I look down, seeing her tiny hands wrapped around my arm. She pulls, trying to pull me through the water.\n\nI don\u2019t resist. I let her pull me through the water, letting her drag me towards the side of the ship. I look up, seeing the child\u2019s face. She\u2019s crying, her eyes streaming with tears.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I say again. \u201cPlease. I want to help you.\u201d\n\nThe girl looks at me, seeing the words on my lips. She looks at my body, seeing that I\u2019m still paralyzed.\n\nShe pulls again, trying to pull me through the water. I don\u2019t resist. I let her pull me, letting her drag me towards the side of the ship.\n\nThe ship lurches again, throwing us both against the wall. I feel a crack, a splinter of glass forming in the ship\u2019s hull. I look up, seeing the girl\u2019s face. She\u2019s crying, her eyes streaming with tears.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I say again. \u201cPlease. I want to help you.\u201d\n\nThe girl looks at me, seeing the words on my lips. She looks at my body, seeing that I\u2019m still paralyzed.\n\nShe pulls again, trying to pull me through the water. I don\u2019t resist. I let her pull me, letting her drag me towards the side of the ship.\n\nThe girl looks at me, seeing my paralyzed body. She looks at me, seeing the desperation in my eyes.\n\nShe pulls again, trying to pull me through the water. I don\u2019t resist. I let her pull me, letting her drag me towards the side of the ship.\n\nSuddenly, the girl lets go of my arm. She looks at me, seeing my paralyzed body. She looks at me, seeing the desperation in my eyes.\n\nShe looks at the ship, seeing its cracked hull, its sinking body. She looks at me, seeing my immobile body.\n\nShe shakes her head, looking at me with sadness. She reaches out, touching my cheek.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t help me.\u201d\n\nShe turns and swims away, disappearing into the darkness. I watch her go, feeling a pang of sadness. I try to move, to follow her, but my body won\u2019t obey.\n\nI\u2019m trapped, paralyzed, helpless. The ship is sinking, taking me with it. I\u2019m going to die, alone and helpless.\n\nThe ship\u2019s computer speaks again"

        "pred_story": "The voice was so familiar, yet not familiar at all. It was a voice that resonated in the back of your mind, a voice that you had heard a million times before, yet never heard. It was the voice of a dream, a dream that you had been having for as long as you could remember. You could recall the first time it had started, back in your teenage years, when you had first seen the city in your dreams. \n\nThe city was dark and mechanical, with towering structures that seemed to pierce the sky and stretch further than the eye could see. You would fly above it, seeing its intricate mechanisms and gears as you soared through the sky, the wind rushing in your face and the wind whipping through your hair. The dream was so vivid, it was as if you were there. But when you woke up, the dream would be gone and you would be left wondering, is it a dream, or a memory?\n\nThe city was real, but you had only seen it through your dreams, or so you thought. It was the reason you had become an engineer, to understand the mechanism and the machinery that made it work. To study it, to understand it, and to see if you could join it, be a part of it.\n\nThe voice came again, this time louder, this time more urgent. \"WHO ARE YOU?\" it demanded. \"WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS WITH THIS CITY?\" it asked. You looked around, trying to find the source of the voice, but you were alone in your room. \n\nThe voice continued, demanding answers, demanding that you reveal yourself and your intentions. But you had no intentions, you just wanted to be a part of it. You wanted to be a part of the machinery, the gears, and the mechanisms of the city. The voice screamed in your mind, demanding that you reveal yourself, that you tell it who you are, but you couldn't tell it anything. \n\nYou couldn't reveal your intentions, because your intentions were not to do anything, they were just to be. The voice continued to demand answers, until you reached out and touched the screen on your table. \"I'M AN ENGINEER,\" you said. \"I WANT TO BE A PART OF THE CITY.\" \n\nThe voice was silent for a moment, before it spoke again. \"WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE A PART OF THE CITY?\" it asked. \"DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY HAVE DIED IN THIS CITY? DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES?\"\n\n\"No,\" you said. \"I just want to be a part of it. I want to know its secrets and understand its mechanisms.\"\n\nThe voice was silent again, before it spoke once more. \"OKAY,\" it said. \"COME BACK AT 6PM AND I WILL TAKE YOU TO THE CITY. BUT BE CAREFUL, THERE ARE THOSE WHO WOULD HURT YOU AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO WOULD KILL YOU.\"\n\nYou smiled, knowing that you would see the city today. You hung up the screen and began to get ready for work, but all you could think about was the city. \n\nAt 6pm, you went back to the screen and saw the voice once again. \"COME TO THE DOOR IN THE BASEMENT OF THE CITY HALL,\" it said. \"YOU WILL BE TAKEN TO THE CITY FROM THERE.\" \n\nYou went to the City Hall and to the basement. There was a door there that you hadn't noticed before, it was camouflaged to blend into the wall. You saw a figure standing in front of the door, its back to you. \n\nThe figure turned and looked at you. It was a woman with blue skin and white hair. \"I'M NERIA,\" she said. \"I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU TO THE CITY.\" \n\nShe opened the door and you walked through. Inside the door, there was a lift, and Neria led you to it. She punched in a code and the door opened, letting out a bright white light. Neria walked through and you followed her. \n\nYou walked for hours through the lift, until you finally arrived at a platform. Neria walked up to a machine and it opened for her. \"THIS IS A PERSONAL TRANSPORTATION DEVICE,\" Neria said. \"IT WILL TAKE US TO THE CITY.\" \n\nYou walked through and found yourself standing at the top of a building, looking out at the city. It was everything you had imagined and more, the wind was rushing through your face and the gears were moving in front of you. \n\n\"This is it,\" Neria said. \"Welcome to the City of Machines.\" \n\nYou looked at her and smiled. \"Thank you,\" you said."

I need to get out of the house.\"\n\nHer face was in my neck. Her teeth were almost touching my skin. \"I thought you were sick today. That's why we're supposed to stay inside.\"\n\nShe moved to my face. She was kissing me again. She was moving quickly. Her tongue was in my mouth. I felt her teeth again. Her teeth were almost in my neck.\n\n\"Katherine, what are you doing? Slow down. What's wrong with you?\" I said.\n\nShe stopped kissing me. Her face was close to mine. Her eyes were looking at me. She wasn't blinking. \"You're not listening to me. You're not listening to me, are you? I can hear your heart. You're not listening to me. I'm not listening to you.

She was eating me. \"You're not listening to me. You're not listening to me. You're not listening to me.\"\n\nI grabbed her. I grabbed her hands. \"Katherine, stop. You're going to hurt me.

I'm glad you're listening to me.\"\n\nI looked at her. \"You're a monster. You're a demon. You're a vampire. Stop!\"\n\nShe looked at me. \"What is a vampire?\" She was smiling.

        "pred_story": "\"You got any beer?\" she asks. I do, I pull out a Sierra Nevada. \"You have any, uh, towels?\" she asks. \"Uh, yeah... sure, go ahead.\" I watch her walk into the bathroom. \n\nThe door closes, and I hear a sound like a thud. I'm not surprised, really. I'm not shocked. I'm not even slightly shocked. This was always going to happen. It was all but certain.\n\nThere was the day she got in the car accident. She was driving home from work, and I was driving home from work, and we both slammed on our brakes at the same time, and we collided. Or, more precisely, my car collided with a deer that was standing in the road. \n\nThe deer went through my windshield, and I saw the blood on my hands, and I saw her car drive off, and I knew something had happened. But I didn't feel anything. Not yet.\n\nThere was the night she fell down the stairs. We'd been drinking, and I'd been playing with the dog, and I'd taken him up the stairs, and we'd both gone down the stairs, and we'd both fallen down the stairs. \n\nShe hit her head on the stairs, and I fell on my foot, and I knew something had happened. But I didn't feel anything.\n\nThere was the night we had the fight. We were arguing, and I was screaming at her, and she was screaming at me, and I said I hated her. And she said she hated me. And then we both went to sleep.\n\nShe got up the next morning, and she made us pancakes, and I thought maybe nothing had happened. But then she sat down across from me, and she said I hated you.\n\nAnd I said, yeah. I did. \n\nAnd she looked at me for a long time. Long enough for me to know what was happening.\n\nAnd then she said, what if I didn't? What if I loved you, and you hated me?\n\nAnd I laughed. I thought she was being funny. I thought this was one of those silly things that people say.\n\nAnd she looked at me again. Long enough for me to know what was happening.\n\nAnd then she said, what if I loved you, and you loved me, but we both hated our lives? And we both hated each other?\n\nAnd I laughed again. And this time, she didn't look at me. This time, she just looked away.\n\nI still laugh now. I laugh now.\n\nThe door opens, and she comes out of the bathroom. Her skin is a deep tan. Not a healthy tan, but a deeply unhealthily tan.\n\nHer eyes are dark. Not black, but a really dark brown.\n\nHer hair is long. Not long like it used to be, but long like it used to be but longer.\n\nI stand up, and I walk over to her, and I put my arms around her, and I kiss her. She kisses me back.\n\nAnd then I realize, this is it. This is happening. I feel something for the first time in a long time.\n\nI pull back, and I look into her eyes. Her eyes are the same eyes. But they're different eyes. Different eyes, but still the same eyes.\n\nAnd then I realize, I can feel my heart beating.\n\n\"I got you a gift,\" she says. \"Open it.\"\n\nI walk into the living room, and I open the gift. It's a small box. I open the box, and I see a ring.\n\nI look at her, and she's standing next to me, and she says, \"Will you marry me?\"\n\nI kiss her again. And then I say, \"Yeah. Yeah, I'll marry you.\""

        "pred_story": "\"UFO?\" I said aloud, staring at the blackened metal body in my front lawn. The house I grew up in. The house my parents still live in. The house I was *almost* back to after a long day at work. \"Is that even... possible?\"\n\n\"What were you thinking, exactly?\" A low, rumbling voice came from the open hatch. It sounded like thunder in the distance. \"You wish on a shooting star for a girlfriend, and what do you get? A spaceship. With a hole in the side of it.\"\n\nI crossed my arms and looked up at the sky. \"Why did you crash into my house?\" I said. \"Do you really need to make such a big deal?\"\n\n\"We don't normally make deals,\" the voice replied. \"We don't *have* deals, actually. That's why it's so weird.\" \n\n\"I see,\" I said, frowning. \"So you're here to take me home then?\"\n\n\"Take you home?\" The voice laughed. \"No, we've barely started. You've got a long time coming.\" The hatch creaked as it opened further. The bright lights illuminated the lawn as I was pulled in. As I stumbled, I noticed a figure. A woman, or at least, that's what she looked like. She was dressed in a white robe, with a black hood covering her head. Her face was shrouded in shadow. \"What are you?\" I said, looking at her. \"Are you my girlfriend?\"\n\n\"I'm a manifestation,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. \"Your manifestation. You wished for a girlfriend, and that's what you got.\" \n\n\"I... I don't want a girlfriend like that,\" I said. \"Please, just take me home.\" I was still holding onto the hatch, trying to pull it open. \"Just please, just take me back home.\" \n\n\"She is not a monster,\" the voice said. \"She is you.\" \n\n\"But... I don't like her,\" I said, turning to the manifestation. \"I didn't want her to be like this. I wanted her to be... normal.\" \n\nThe manifestation's head tilted slightly as she looked at me. \"I *am* normal,\" she said, her voice a little louder now. \"I am the person you wish to be with.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said. \"I don't feel like... we're a good match.\" \n\nThe manifestation looked back at me. \"You are the one who made me,\" she said. \"Do you not like my creation?\"\n\nI sighed and dropped my arms to my sides. \"I didn't mean to hurt you,\" I said. \"I just... I was really lonely.\" \n\nThe manifestation nodded, her hood slipping off her head. Her face was gaunt and pale, but there was something familiar about her. It looked like her. I looked like her. \"I know,\" she said. \"That's why I'm here.\"\n\nI stared at her, unsure what to say. \"I... I don't know if this is going to work,\" I said. \"But... I'd like to try.\""

        "pred_story": "\"Mom, I'm coming down!\" I shouted, throwing my backpack and the books on my desk across the room. The two slammed against the door I was trapped behind, but it was too strong. My screams for help were drowned out by the sounds of my parents eating upstairs, completely ignoring my pleas for freedom.\n\nI was trapped. I had been trapped for as long as I could remember.\n\nEvery first Monday of the month, my parents would lock me in the basement. It was always the same thing. \"We'll get you out of there tomorrow, sweetie!\" my mom would say. \"I'm sorry, baby, I know it's hard!\" my dad would interject, but I knew they were lying.\n\nTomorrow never came. When the sun rose, I would remain locked down here. But by Tuesday morning, I was free again. They never told me why, and I couldn't ask.\n\nIt was my own fault, really. My parents loved me, or at least, they pretended to. They were always doing things for me, like cooking meals and buying me clothes. But I didn't understand why they had to do everything to the point where they had to lock me in the basement for a whole day.\n\n\"Where the fuck is the key?\" I screamed at the door, slamming my fists against it. The sound of the slamming was muffled by the carpeted floor. They wouldn't come down here for me. They never did.\n\nWhy did I always let them do this to me?\n\nI couldn't keep this up. I needed answers. I needed a way to get out of this basement. I needed to know why they kept me trapped down here every first Monday.\n\nI didn't even notice the small door until I was searching the walls of my prison. It was small, almost like it was built for a child. And it had a keyhole.\n\nA lock. But not just any lock.\n\n\"Turn the handle, and see what happens.\"\n\nI spun around. Who was behind me? It was dark in here, and I couldn't tell. But I saw a pair of glowing eyes staring back at me.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I demanded, trying to find a weapon. I grabbed a nearby book, holding it up like a shield.\n\n\"I am someone who will answer your questions, and set you free.\" The voice was low, deep. I couldn't see the person's face, but I knew they were old. Ancient.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I repeated. The voice didn't respond.\n\n\"I'm bored. Are you going to open the lock, or are you going to stand here all day?\" The eyes blinked, changing their color from bright green to dark brown. \"I think I'm going to sleep. Wake me when you're done.\"\n\nThe voice was getting impatient. I grabbed the small lock and tried to turn it. It didn't budge. I kicked it, but it wouldn't break. I tried to bend it, but it wouldn't bend. It was made of some sort of metal I didn't recognize.\n\n\"What the hell is this?!\" I shouted, slamming my fist against the small door.\n\n\"I think you'll find that it's some sort of ancient metal. Don't worry, it's made of lead.\" The eyes blinked again. \"I'm still sleeping.\"\n\nI screamed, throwing the book down. It hit the floor with a thud, flying out of my hands. The eyes blinked. \"How's my book?\"\n\nI didn't respond. I had turned the lock. It was unlocked, but the small door didn't budge. It was stuck, like the door I was trapped in.\n\n\"Can you open it? I don't want to have to get up again.\"\n\nI rolled my eyes. \"It's stuck, okay? I tried.\"\n\nThe eyes blinked. \"How old are you, kiddo?\"\n\nI looked at my reflection in the mirror on my wall, staring at the small scar above my eyebrow. \"I'm 21. What difference does it make?\"\n\n\"I'm 400 years old. I don't want to die alone.\"\n\nThe door was stuck. I couldn't open it. But the eyes didn't seem to care. \"What are you planning to do?\"\n\n\"Find out why I'm stuck down here, of course.\"\n\nThe eyes blinked again. \"Well, first of all, I'm sorry to say that I don't think you're stuck down here. I think you're locked in.\"\n\n\"Locked in? What do you mean?\"\n\nThe eyes blinked again. \"I mean, you're being locked in by your parents. You've been locked in since you were a baby.\"\n\n\"No, that's not true.\" I laughed. \"I can leave whenever I want.\"\n\nThe eyes blinked. \"Really? Then why aren't you upstairs eating dinner with your parents?\"\n\nI froze, my breath caught in my throat. I wasn't eating dinner. I hadn't eaten since the night before. And I hadn't left this room in years. I was stuck. \"Where am I?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\"You're in your house. But you're not free. Not yet.\"\n\nThe eyes blinked, but I didn't feel any comfort in their words. I felt trapped, like I had been trapped all along. And it was my own fault.\n\n\"What was that?\" I whispered.\n\n\"I'm not sure. Do you remember?\"\n\nI paused, trying to think. But I couldn't. I had never been able to remember it. All I had ever known was this prison, this small room in my house. But it was never truly mine.\n\n\"No, I don't remember.\"\n\nThe eyes blinked. \"That's okay. I think it's something you can forget.\"\n\nI couldn't think. I couldn't remember. But I knew I had to keep trying. I had to find a way to escape this prison. And the only way to do that was to uncover the truth.\n\nI would go upstairs, and I would look for clues. I would find the truth. I would escape.\n\nBut I couldn't do it alone. I needed help."

        "pred_story": "They have been on the road for hours. The desert sand stretches far and wide, until it was impossible to see the horizon. The only sign of civilization in the distance was a small church. It looked ancient. \n\nThe vehicle they were driving had been stolen from a nearby town. It looked like it had been used to transport supplies. The old pickup truck had no headlights, but it had been modified to run at night. It was a piece of junk but it would have to do.\n\nIt was almost midnight when they pulled up to the church. It was a small place, probably made of some stone or rock. It looked old and worn down. But something about it called to them.\n\nThey sat for a while, looking out at the church. They had seen a number of strange churches during their journey. Some had been on the side of the road, others had been off in the middle of nowhere. But they all seemed to be calling to them.\n\nFinally, one of the men spoke. \"Do you think this one is safe?\" he asked. \n\nThe other man looked out the window. \"There aren't any people around,\" he said. \"If it's not safe then there isn't any harm in checking it out.\"\n\nThe first man nodded. He was starting to get a little spooked. He had been hoping to find something safe to stay for the night, and this church seemed like a possibility.\n\nThe two of them stepped out of the truck. They looked up at the church, then around at the surrounding area. There were no lights or signs of life anywhere. \n\nThey both reached for a weapon. They looked at each other, then shrugged. They had been traveling together for weeks now, and they knew each other well. They had been over each other's shoulders during this whole time.\n\nThey walked up the driveway, then stepped through the front door. The door was small and ornate, something they had seen in movies but never in real life.\n\nInside the church was dimly lit. They could see that it was old, maybe a couple hundred years old. But there were no signs of damage or disrepair. The place was clean and well kept, and it smelled good too.\n\nOne of the men reached into his pocket and pulled out a small candle. He looked around, then lit it and placed it in a nearby holder. The church was lit up, and they could see their surroundings more clearly.\n\nThe church was old and worn down, like the outside. But it looked well maintained, like the people that had been here had loved the place.\n\nThe two men looked at each other. Then they looked around the church, looking for a place to stay. They spotted a small bench and sat down. They looked out the window, watching as the sun set. \n\nThey were just sitting there, watching the sun go down, when they heard a noise. It sounded like footsteps, coming from the back of the church. \n\nThe two men froze, their hearts pounding. They listened carefully, trying to hear the source of the noise.\n\nAfter a few seconds, the footsteps stopped. The men listened again, but they didn't hear anything. \n\nThey sat in silence for a few more minutes. They could hear each other's heavy breathing, but nothing else. \n\nFinally, one of the men spoke. \"Do you think someone is here with us?\" he asked.\n\nThe other man turned to look at him. \"I don't know,\" he replied. \"But I don't think so. I don't hear anything.\"\n\nThe first man nodded. He thought about it for a few seconds, then spoke again. \"Do you hear anything now?\" he asked.\n\nThe other man paused, then shook his head. \"No, I don't hear anything.\"\n\nThey sat in silence for another few minutes. They listened carefully, trying to hear anything. \n\nThen they heard it. It was a faint humming noise. The humming got louder and louder, until it was almost deafening.\n\nThey both looked at each other, their hearts pounding. Then they turned around and ran out the door.\n\nThey didn't stop running until they were back in the truck, speeding down the road."

The King has requested your presence.\"\n\nMy eyes snapped to attention as I sat up. \"Who was it?\" I demanded.\n\nI turned to see the King's advisor standing in my bedroom doorway. \"Who was it?\" I demanded again.\n\nThe advisor shifted uncomfortably, and I could tell he didn't want to answer me.\n\n\"It was Mister Wiggles.\" The advisor said, as he stepped into the room. \"The Princess's teddy bear.\" \n\nMister Wiggles. A talking teddy bear. I didn't think I'd ever meet a talking teddy bear. Then again, the Princess was a strange child. \n\nThe advisor seemed to have a lot of trouble getting the words out, but the King's magic helped him through it.\n\n\"It was Mister Wiggles. He came in through the window. He told the guards he was there to... uh, watch the Princess. That he'd been invited.\" He looked at me, and I saw a flicker of anger in his eyes.\n\n\"Is that so.\" I said, slowly standing. \n\nThe advisor nodded, and quickly left my bedroom.\n\nI quickly got dressed, and followed after him.\n\nThe castle was in a state of panic, the guards rushing around and trying to stop some of the nobles from trying to get to the Princess's room. \n\nI rushed up the stairs, with the advisor behind me, and ran down the hallway to the Princess's room. \n\nHer room door was open, and I rushed inside.\n\nMister Wiggles was there, sitting on the Princess's bed and looking at her with an eerie grin on his face. The Princess was on the floor, crying. \n\n\"Ah, my dear knight. How lovely of you to join us.\" Mister Wiggles said, as he looked up at me.\n\n\"You should leave now, Mister Wiggles. The Princess is not feeling well.\" I said, as I rushed over to the Princess and knelt beside her.\n\n\"Ah, the Princess is not feeling well? Oh, that's too bad. I'm so sorry to hear that. But I'm not going anywhere. I have her now.\" Mister Wiggles said, laughing as he moved towards us.\n\nI quickly turned to the Princess, and saw that her face was pale. She was gasping for breath, and I knew something was wrong. \n\n\"Mister Wiggles, help!\" I shouted, as I rushed over and picked up the Princess. \"I can feel her heartbeat, she's not breathing!\" I shouted, as I rushed over to the window and threw it open.\n\n\"The castle guards will have you in chains! You'll never escape!\"\n\nMister Wiggles laughed, as he ran towards the window. He jumped out, with the Princess in my arms, and I quickly followed after him."

You were a man, you came to my house. You were my wife\u2019s father, she had just died. You came to me and you were mean. You were just awful. You said I was selfish, you said I was heartless. You said I didn\u2019t love her enough.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, \u201cI know. You loved her. You loved her enough to drive her to death. You loved her enough to drive me to madness.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer death, that was no fault of mine! She died from drinking too much. She drank too much every day. She was an addict. She knew that. She knew she wasn\u2019t living the life she wanted. She was addicted to the feeling of being high. She wanted to be on top of the world all the time. She wanted to be the center of attention. She wanted to be free.\u201d\n\nThe stranger stopped pacing. \u201cShe died because you didn\u2019t love her enough. You didn\u2019t love her enough to let her be free.

Her eyes were wide, \u201cWho are you? How can you do this to me? How can you make me remember?\u201d\n\nHe looked at her, \u201cI\u2019m your memory. I\u2019m your past. I\u2019m your present.

I won\u2019t let you do this to anyone else.\u201d\n\nHe chuckled, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not going to let you do that either. You\u2019re not going to stop me from doing this to anyone else.

        "pred_story": "Dante stared blankly at the table, his mind numb from the meeting. It was a typical morning for the meeting, the leaders and leaders to be discussing plans for the next few days, weeks, months. Nothing too exciting about it. Just a normal day of discussing plans to take over the world.\n\nExcept, now he knew the secret of who was behind the operation.\n\nAnd that was not normal.\n\nHe was still in shock, still trying to wrap his head around the fact that the CEO of the company was a demon. As he listened to his boss talk, he wondered how he didn't see the signs. He wondered how he didn't realize it was a demon behind the operation.\n\nBut now that he knew, he was scared. He was terrified that he was accidentally signed over his soul during the interview. He had always assumed he was in a normal company, a normal office, surrounded by normal people.\n\nBut now he was face to face with a demon.\n\nThe demon sat in his leather chair, dressed in a well-fitted suit, smiling as he spoke to the team. Dante couldn't help but stare, his eyes wide with shock. He had never seen a demon in person before, but he had read about them. He had read about their evil deeds, their cruel intentions.\n\nAnd now he knew that he was in the same building as one.\n\nAs the demon finished speaking, the team turned to him, awaiting his response. Dante blinked, trying to break out of his daze. \"Uh, sorry,\" he muttered, trying to play it off like he wasn't staring at the demon. \"I think I lost track of what was being said.\"\n\nThe demon smiled, its face contorted into a twisted smirk. \"No worries, Dante,\" it said, its voice dripping with sarcasm. \"You've been quiet for the past few meetings. It's nice to see you paying attention.\"\n\nDante nodded, still staring at the demon, trying to process everything. He knew he had to get out of there, to escape the demon's clutches. But he was stuck in the room, unable to move or speak.\n\n\"Alright, moving on,\" the demon said, its voice dripping with excitement. \"Next week, we'll be launching our attack on the city. We'll have hundreds of men in black suits, armed to the teeth, taking over the city. By the end of the week, we'll have control of the entire city.\"\n\nThe team cheered, clapping and smiling. Dante wanted to do the same, but his mind was in shock. He couldn't think, couldn't move. He was frozen, unable to do anything but stare at the demon.\n\n\"Who's ready to take over the world?\" the demon asked, its voice dripping with sarcasm.\n\nThe team cheered, chanting \"us, us, us\" as they clapped and smiled. Dante wondered if he was the only one who knew the truth. Was he the only one who knew their boss was a demon?\n\nBut then the demon spoke again, its voice dripping with sarcasm. \"You all are so cute when you're excited. You should be excited, you should be terrified. We are going to take over the world, and there's nothing anyone can do to stop us.\"\n\nThe team laughed, smiling and cheering. Dante felt his heart sink, realizing that he was the only one who knew the truth. He was the only one who knew that their boss was a demon.\n\nAnd now he knew that he was trapped, that he had to escape before it was too late.\n\nThe demon smiled, its eyes glowing bright red. \"You all are going to do great things,\" it said. \"And I'll be right behind you, guiding you along the way.\"\n\nDante knew it was time to escape. He needed to get out of there, to leave the demon and its plan behind. But as he turned to leave, he realized that he was trapped. The door was locked, the windows barred.\n\nAnd then the demon spoke again, its voice dripping with sarcasm. \"Oh, I don't think you'll be leaving anytime soon,\" it said. \"In fact, I think you'll be joining us soon.\"\n\nDante's eyes widened, his heart pounding in his chest. He knew what the demon was saying. He knew that he was going to be trapped in this room forever.\n\nThe demon smiled, its eyes glowing bright red. \"You should be happy,\" it said. \"You get to be a part of something great. You get to be a part of the greatest evil the world has ever seen.\"\n\nDante shook his head, trying to break free from the demon's grasp. But it was too late. He was trapped, stuck in this room with the demon.\n\nAnd he knew that he was never going to escape."

        "pred_story": "Davro had never actually fought an opposing magician before. He had, of course, fought other mages on the battlefields, but usually, they were just the enemy's magic, and not the enemy's magic users themselves. As he stood in the middle of the room, facing the other mage, he felt a nervous tick in his stomach. He had spent years honing his craft, and he knew that he was better than this other mage in a direct confrontation. But he also knew that he didn't really want to fight. A fight would damage him, and it would give him a wound to heal. The last thing he wanted was to be wounded. He had already spent too much time off of his usual routine.\n\nThe other mage, on the other hand, looked bored. He was leaning against one of the tables, and his eyes were drifting from one of the posters on the wall to another. He didn't seem to be paying much attention to Davro. \"So, what do you want?\" he asked. His voice was low and smooth, with an accent that Davro couldn't quite place.\n\n\"I'm here to speak to the leader of the guild,\" Davro said, his voice as steady as he could make it.\n\nThe other mage snorted. \"That's what they all say.\"\n\n\"I'm not just any mage,\" Davro said. He could feel the familiar rush of power flow through him, and he smiled. \"My power is causality manipulation. I can change the cause of an effect.\"\n\nThe other mage sighed. \"But you can't change the effect itself. How good is it then?\"\n\nDavro frowned. \"Very.\" He hadn't actually done much with his power, but he knew that it had tremendous potential. He just needed to figure out how to use it. He looked at the other mage, who looked away from the wall, and actually paid attention to him. \"Do you know anything about causality manipulation?\"\n\nThe other mage shrugged. \"Sure. It's pretty standard magic theory. Most mages have some knowledge of causality and how it works. But that's a really advanced subject, so you would have had to have studied for a long time to have mastered it.\"\n\n\"I've been studying for over a decade,\" Davro said.\n\nThe other mage snorted again. \"You think that's impressive? The leader of the guild here has studied for over a century. And what good has it done her? Her son is dead, her husband is dead, and she has lost everything that she has ever loved. What has your mastery of causality manipulation done for you?\"\n\nDavro frowned again. He hadn't thought about how the power he had been given was useless, and now, he wondered if it was even worth having. \"What about you?\" he asked. \"What's your power?\"\n\nThe other mage snorted once more. \"I can turn anything I touch to dust,\" he said, and smiled. \"I've been using my power for years, and I have never lost a fight. But I've also never really won one. I have always been part of a larger story, and my role has always been defined by someone else. But I will never be part of a story again. I will never be controlled again.\"\n\nDavro felt a surge of power run through him. He realized that the other mage wasn't lying, and he wondered why he was here. \"What's the deal?\" he asked. \"Why are you here?\"\n\nThe other mage smiled again. \"I'm here to offer you a deal. If you use your power, I'll give you a wish.\"\n\nDavro frowned. \"What kind of wish?\" he asked.\n\nThe other mage shrugged. \"You can wish for anything,\" he said. \"Money, fame, revenge... you can have anything your heart desires. But you have to use your power. If you don't, then I'll take my offer off the table.\"\n\nDavro hesitated. He was tempted by the offer, but he didn't really know if it was trustworthy. But then he looked at the other mage, and he realized that he wasn't going to be fooled. \"Fine,\" he said. \"But I don't want anything too obvious. I don't want to be rich or famous.\"\n\nThe other mage nodded. \"I thought you might say that,\" he said. \"Let me tell you what your wish is.\"\n\nDavro nodded. He leaned forward, and the other mage placed a hand on his arm.\n\n\"Your wish is to be free,\" the other mage said. \"To be free of the burdens of your past, to be free of the constraints of your present, and to be free of the uncertainty of your future. You have been given a great gift, and you should not waste it on petty material wealth or fleeting fame. You should use it to be free, to be who you truly are, without the weight of the world's expectations holding you down.\"\n\nDavro felt a wave of power rush through him. He felt lighter, freer, and more himself than he had in a long time. \"Thank you,\" he said, and smiled. \"Thank you.\"\n\nThe other mage nodded, and smiled back. \"Anytime,\" he said."

        "pred_story": "Dr. Rastan sat down in her chair, and took a deep breath, rubbing her temples. She sighed heavily, and looked at the patient laid on the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s Dr. Rastan, yes? You\u2019re sure that it\u2019s a calculator, and not just some kind of device for your phone?\u201d\n\nThe patient stared at her blankly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? I have a calculator in my pocket. Look!\u201d\n\nShe sighed, and rubbed her temples again. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019re doing this, but I\u2019m not going to play along. I know there\u2019s a bug in the AI system for this hospital, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m impressed with the lengths you\u2019re going to in order to trick me into thinking that you\u2019re insane. But I\u2019m not going to let you win. You\u2019re going to have to try better than that.\u201d\n\nShe glanced over at the patient\u2019s pocket, and frowned. There was a glint of metal poking out of it, but when she went to take a closer look, it vanished. She sighed. \u201cLook, I know you\u2019re just trying to trick me, but you\u2019re not doing it very well. You can\u2019t fool me with a little trick like that. I know how the cameras work, and how they\u2019re linked to the computer system. There\u2019s no calculator there.\u201d\n\nThe patient scoffed. \u201cOh really? You\u2019re just going to tell me that, huh? Well, I\u2019ll let you look. Go ahead, check my pocket, but I warn you, it\u2019s a very expensive one.\u201d\n\nShe sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to check your pocket. But if you insist on proving that you have a calculator, then you should have no problem showing it to me.\u201d She glared at the patient. \u201cAnd I better believe that you\u2019re not using a bug in the computer system to pull this off.\u201d\n\nThe patient shrugged. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you check?\u201d He pulled out his pocket, and waved it in front of her face.\n\nShe shook her head, and looked at the computer in front of her. \u201cI\u2019m not going to play your game. It\u2019s my job to keep you locked up in here, and I\u2019m not going to let you pull the wool over my eyes.\u201d\n\nThe patient sighed. \u201cFine, then. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d He pulled the calculator out of his pocket, and held it up.\n\nDr. Rastan\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d\n\nHe smirked. \u201cI told you, I have a calculator. And it\u2019s solar powered.\u201d\n\nShe stared at it for a long moment, then shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. How can you prove that it\u2019s solar powered?\u201d\n\nHe shrugged. \u201cCheck it out yourself. It\u2019s just a button on the side, but if you flip it, you should see a little green light blinking. It\u2019s the battery level. It should be around 90% charged.\u201d\n\nShe stared at the calculator for a long moment, then turned back to the computer. \u201cLet me check something.\u201d She began typing at the keyboard, and after a moment, she looked back at the patient. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not solar powered. But it\u2019s still a very expensive calculator. I couldn\u2019t get that kind of tech on the market right now, not to mention the fact that it\u2019s still in the development phase. You\u2019re not pulling this off with a bug.\u201d\n\nHe shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s getting out of here, but it\u2019s a very expensive device. And I\u2019m not going to let you take it from me.\u201d\n\nShe frowned. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a problem. I\u2019m going to have to check with the hospital and see if we can get you certified with your device. It\u2019s not legal for you to use it in public, but maybe you can get an exception.\u201d\n\nHe rolled his eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of that? It\u2019s a solar powered calculator, not some kind of dangerous weapon.\u201d\n\nDr. Rastan sighed. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what kind of game you\u2019re playing here, but I know that you\u2019re not being honest with me. You\u2019re not being truthful about your situation, and you\u2019re trying to trick me into releasing you from here. And I\u2019m not going to fall for it.\u201d\n\nThe patient frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re not taking me seriously, are you?\u201d\n\nShe shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be objective about this. But I have to say, I\u2019m not impressed with what you\u2019ve been showing me.\u201d\n\nHe snorted. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to show you anything. I\u2019m trying to prove a point.\u201d\n\nDr. Rastan raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat point?\u201d\n\nHe stood up. \u201cThat you\u2019re not listening to me. You\u2019re not taking me seriously, and you\u2019re not caring about my situation. I\u2019m just a statistic to you, a number that\u2019s going to be used to fill a bed in this hospital. And you\u2019re not going to care about what happens to me.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him blankly. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be professional about this. You have to understand that.\u201d\n\nHe scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019re not professional. You\u2019re just like everyone else. You\u2019re only trying to see things from your perspective, and you\u2019re not caring about mine. Well, let me tell you, you\u2019re wrong about this. And I\u2019m going to prove it to you.\u201d\n\nDr. Rastan stood, and began to walk away from the patient. \u201cI\u2019m going to go talk to the hospital. See if we can get you certified with your device.\u201d\n\nHe pulled out his calculator and stared at it, tapping his fingers against it. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m even bothering with this. It\u2019s not like I care about your opinion anyway.\u201d\n\nShe stopped in her tracks, and turned around. \u201cWell, maybe you should.\u201d\n\nHe raised his calculator, and flipped the button on the side. The little green light that appeared was dim, but it was definitely there. She raised an eyebrow, and glared at him. \u201cOkay, fine, you\u2019ve got a point. Maybe you should. But you need to understand my job. My job is to protect the public. And you\u2019re not going to get any kind of public acceptance if you start running around with a device like that. You need to get it certified.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll give it a shot. But I\u2019m not promising anything. I\u2019m not going to get certified if I can\u2019t get any kind of public acceptance. And I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s going to happen. You need to understand my situation.\u201d\n\nShe sighed. \u201cI\u2019m trying to. But you\u2019re not making it very easy.\u201d\n\nHe sighed. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give you one more chance. If I don\u2019t get certified, then you need to let me go. And I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m just going to be a nuisance in public. I\u2019m not going to care about what you think anymore.\u201d\n\nShe glanced at the computer screen, then back at the patient. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll do it. But if you\u2019re not being honest with me, I\u2019m going to catch you. And if you\u2019re not being truthful, then"

In a few years, I would be at the age of military draft, and my parents were already getting worried. They didn't know what to do about it. There was no other way to protect me from the draft. It was the law. But I had a plan.\n\nThe problem was that I didn't want to do it. In fact, I had already found something that I wanted to do. Something that I had never expected to do. Something I only found when I got injured in the simulations. I started to learn to play music. And I was good at it.\n\nI never thought I could do it, but when I started playing piano, I found that I could do it. I found that the piano made me feel happy, but it also made me feel sad. I played so much that I became exhausted. My parents were mad at me because I was wasting my time. But I didn't care. I just wanted to play the piano.\n\nWhen I got to the age of military draft, I was still playing the piano. But I was only seventeen, and I wanted to find out who I was. I wanted to know why I was born, and what I could do to make the most of my life.\n\nI didn't want to fight in a war. I didn't want to have to kill people. I didn't want to have to make a decision that would cost a person their life. I wanted to be myself, and I wanted to find what I wanted to do. And that was music.\n\nThe draft was inevitable, but I was lucky to be born in a country that allowed me to not have to fight. I could be sent to some other country to fight in a war, and it would have been okay. I would have still been drafted, and I would still have had to fight. But it was better than being drafted to fight for my own country.\n\nThat would have been a nightmare. I wanted to be drafted to fight for my country. I didn't want to be sent somewhere else to fight for someone else. I wanted to be a soldier, not a mercenary. I was a soldier, and I wanted to do my duty.\n\nI was drafted to fight in the war between the two countries, and I was a soldier in the army. I was sent to the front lines, and I had to fight. I wanted to play music. But I didn't want to play music in front of people. I wanted to play music alone. I wanted to play music for myself.\n\nI didn't want to play music for anyone else.

        "pred_story": "\"Your soul is free.\" I whispered. \"I can see it floating. I can feel the heat of it.\"\n\nI had long since passed the point of fear, but this statement had taken me back a step. The woman, the woman who was so old she was almost ancient, had her eyes closed and her head tipped back. Her voice was calm, soothing. It was a voice that did not belong to a demon. \"That is impossible. My soul is frozen.\"\n\n\"It is not frozen, but rather bound. To the earth, to the memories of your past.\"\n\n\"My memories?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" She opened her eyes, blue eyes that were full of tears. She was old. Very old. I could see the lines of time on her face. Lines that stretched out before her in the way that they did not behind. \"I did not know that I had been cursed by a demon.\"\n\n\"I was not sent to curse you.\" The ancient demon shook her head. \"I was sent to punish you.\"\n\n\"Punish?\"\n\n\"Yes. The demon who cursed you is dead now. But I have been told to make you pay.\"\n\nThe ancient demon had opened her eyes now. She was staring at me. Her eyes were so blue, almost purple. I could feel the weight of them, the weight of a gaze that had been trained on many for so very long.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because you took a life.\" She shook her head. \"You took a life without reason. Without a thought. Without remorse. Your soul was cursed because you were a killer.\"\n\nI had never felt a sting of shame before. But the demon's words cut me deeply. \"I did not know,\" I said. \"I did not know it was a curse.\"\n\n\"It is not a curse to know that you have taken a life.\" The demon leaned in. Her breath was heavy. \"But to not know that you have taken a life is a curse to your soul. You were a killer. A killer who was cursed by a demon.\"\n\n\"That was not my fault,\" I said.\n\nThe demon let out a small sigh. \"I know,\" she said. \"I know that it was not your fault. You were not raised a killer. You were not born a killer. But you were born into a world where murder was acceptable. Where your life was not considered to be as valuable as others.\"\n\nI thought of that. Of how my life had been compared to those of others in a way that made me feel small. But also, of how my life had been seen as disposable. As less valuable.\n\n\"That does not excuse what you have done,\" the demon said.\n\n\"No.\" I sighed. \"But perhaps it could be used as an excuse. A justification for what you have done to me.\"\n\n\"I have not done anything to you.\"\n\n\"I am here now, am I not?\" I looked around. We were in some sort of cage, one that was made of a hard black material. \"This is your domain, is it not? A place where you keep souls.\"\n\n\"Yes. This is my domain.\"\n\n\"Then, have you not done anything to me?\"\n\n\"No.\" The demon was shaking her head. \"I have only helped you. I have helped you find your way.\"\n\n\"I do not want to find my way.\" I could feel the fear rising up in me. \"I do not want to be here.\"\n\n\"You are here now,\" the demon said. \"I can show you how to go home.\"\n\n\"I do not want to go home,\" I said. \"I do not want to go back. I want to stay here with you.\"\n\nThe demon laughed. A low, throaty laugh. \"No,\" she said. \"You do not want to stay here.\"\n\nI opened my mouth to argue, but stopped. I could feel a growing heat inside of me. A growing heat that was coming from my throat.\n\n\"I see it,\" the demon said. \"Your soul. It is growing warm.\"\n\nI opened my mouth again. \"No,\" I said.\n\nBut the word was gone. Instead, it was replaced by a new one. A word that was coming from my throat. A word that was a curse. A word that was a spell.\n\nThe demon saw it, the word. She saw its power. The heat inside of me grew. The word was getting stronger.\n\n\"It is too late,\" she said. \"You have spoken the word. You have used your skill.\"\n\nI looked at the word in my mind. I saw its power. I saw its danger.\n\nAnd then I spoke it.\n\nI was standing in the forest again, surrounded by the same trees that I had seen before. The same trees that had seemed so familiar. I turned back to look at the cave. The door was closed, but the rock had been moved from it. The demon was nowhere to be seen, but there was an object lying on the ground.\n\nI picked it up. It was a book, one with pages of pure white. The pages were blank, but as I turned to the next one, it began to fill with words. Words that I could not read. Words that I did not need to read. They told me everything that I needed to know.\n\nI had used my skill.\n\nI was dead."

She had seen humanity explore the stars and encounter beings of other worlds. And she was still going, still laughing, still smiling, still joyful.\n\nDespite the gods having foretold her fate, that no one who sought immortality came to regret it, she had not regretted it. She had never regretted it. She knew that her life had been full. She had lived a good life. \n\nAnd she was still going. And still going. And still going.\n\nAs the millennia passed the gods began to notice her. They began to wonder why she had not come to regret her choice. They began to wonder if she was some sort of anomaly, a one in a million, or one in a billion. They began to wonder if they had been wrong in saying no one who sought immortality came to regret it.\n\nAnd then there was the fact that she was having children. The gods knew that was not possible in her state. She did not have a body that could give birth to another human. \n\nBut the children came. They grew to be as strong and joyful as their mother. They laughed just as much. They smiled just as much. They were the children of a god. Of an angel. They were as strong as an angel. \n\nAnd the gods could not believe it.\n\nThey watched as the old woman gave birth to children. They watched as she raised them, taught them, trained them. They watched as they grew and became like her. They watched as they did not come to regret their state. \n\nAnd the gods began to wonder. \n\nThe gods began to wonder if they had been wrong. They began to wonder if immortality was not a curse, but a blessing. They began to wonder if they had been so focused on the bad things that happened as a result of immortality that they did not notice the good. \n\nAnd they watched as the old woman and her children grew. They watched as the family became larger and larger. They watched as the old woman lived with her children, with her grand children, with her great grandchildren. \n\nAnd they watched as they did not regret their state. They watched as they laughed. They watched as they smiled. \n\nAnd the gods began to wonder. The gods began to wonder why no one was regretting their state. The gods began to wonder if perhaps they had been wrong. \n\nBut they watched the old woman. They watched her children. They watched her grandchildren. They watched her great grandchildren. And they saw something. \n\nThey saw how they lived. They saw how they had no care in the world. They had no fear. They had no doubt. \n\nAnd the gods realized that they had been wrong. They realized that immortality was not a curse, but a blessing. They realized that the old woman and her children were doing something that they were not. \n\nThe gods realized that the old woman and her children were living in the moment. They were not living in the past. They were not living in the future. \n\nThey were living in the present. And they were happy. \n\nThe gods realized that no one regrets immortality because they live in the moment.

        "pred_story": "My phone beeped as I got into my car. It's been happening nonstop, and I'm glad I'm not the paranoid one here. \"Hello, how can I help you?\" I texted back. \"Just saw you get into your car and wanted to make sure you were safe. You're going to make it to the office, right?\" She asked. \"Yeah, I'm gonna make it. Thanks for caring.\" I replied. She said something back but I never read it, just hitting reply all. \"Hey, what's wrong? You don't respond much lately. Did I do something wrong? Did I come on too strong?\" She said. My heart melted seeing those words. \"I don't know, maybe you did come on a little too strong but I loved it and can't wait for more. But it's really your fault for being so perfect, I'd say.\" I said. \"Perfect? I don't see how. You're the one who's perfect, your job, your physique, your looks... it all screams perfection.\" She said. \"No, no, no. You're the one who's perfect, it's why I'm so drawn to you.\" I said, trying not to sound too creepy. \"Okay, I don't know what to say. I love you too.\" She said. I don't know why I said I loved her, but I did. I couldn't resist the idea of her coming to me every day. \"I'll see you at the office then?\" I said. \"Yeah, I love you, bye.\" She said, hanging up.\n\nAs I pulled into my office, I saw her walking towards my car. \"Hey, what are you doing here? You can't walk to work in heels.\" I said. \"I took a cab, I wanted to see you. I had a surprise for you.\" She said. \"A surprise? I thought we just texted.\" I said, trying to play dumb. \"Yeah, sorry. It's just that you're always at work, I thought it would be nice for you to see me every day.\" She said, giving me a hug. \"Oh, okay. That's kind of cool I guess.\" I said, returning her hug. \"So, what's the surprise?\" I said, breaking off the hug. \"I made you a sandwich. I know how much you love them. I just wanted to surprise you.\" She said, holding the sandwich out. \"Wow, that's so thoughtful of you. I love it.\" I said, taking the sandwich. \"I also made you your favorite soup. I know how much you like it.\" She said. \"Whoa, you're speaking my language now. I didn't think anyone made soup at home.\" I said. \"You'd be surprised at how much people can make at home, they just don't know how.\" She said. \"So, what do you do for a living?\" I asked. \"I don't, I just work at home. I take care of my mom, she's really sick right now.\" She said. \"I'm sorry, that's really tough for you. I can imagine how stressful it must be.\" I said. \"Yeah, it's really tough. I wish I could get her help but it's hard to get money. You know how hard it is to get medical help without money?\" She said. \"Yeah, I know. It's like they just can't care about anything but their money.\" I said. \"Exactly, that's why I'm so glad you're here. It's like, I have you and my mom and that's all I need.\" She said. \"That's really sweet of you to say. I'm glad I could be here for you.\" I said. \"Me too. Thank you for coming here and showing me you care. I love you.\" She said, giving me another hug. \"I love you too.\" I said, returning her hug. As we hugged, I felt myself fall for her and realize that I didn't care about the difference in ages."

        "pred_story": "I don't remember it starting. I just always knew. It's probably because of my blood type, O negative. It's like the universal donor. Anytime a hospital needs blood, and they have to do an emergency transfusion, I'm the go to. I've got a weird spot in my head where I can just sense it. So when I got to college, I started carrying it with me at all times. The blood, I mean, not the spot. I've always been a neat freak. It makes me feel safer. \n\nIt was my third year of school, and I was walking through a park. It was just a normal park. Grass, trees, and squirrels. I was just walking and enjoying the view when I saw her. She was standing there, staring at me. I didn't think much of it at first, but then she stepped forward and said, \"May I have a taste of you?\" \n\nI stopped walking, and said, \"What? I thought you were human. Why are you talking like that?\" She looked down at her feet, and said, \"I am human. Well, I used to be. I've been stuck in this form for a few years.\" \n\nI asked her, \"How did you end up in this form?\" She gave me this sad look, and said, \"I made a deal with a demon. I wanted to be a model, so I sold my soul to become one.\" She looked up at me, and I saw tears forming in her eyes. \"I'm so sorry, I never expected it to go this far.\" She started crying, and I felt my instincts take over. I pulled out my bag, and held it out to her. \"Here, take my blood. It'll make you feel better.\" \n\nShe looked at me, and smiled. She said, \"Oh, I've been wanting to try this blood. It's supposed to be the best.\" She said it like she was giving me a compliment. I didn't understand. She bit into my wrist, and I felt it sting. I looked at her, and saw my blood dripping down her throat. It was like she was drinking from a fountain. I thought I was going to pass out, but she stopped drinking after a few seconds. She licked my wrist, and said, \"Thank you, you're so kind. Do you want to be friends now?\" \n\nI said, \"Uh, yeah I guess so.\" I had just given this girl my blood, and now we're friends? It seemed weird to me, but she seemed happy. We started hanging out more, and she introduced me to some of her friends. I found out they were all vampires too, but they were much nicer than the ones I had learned about in school. \n\nI've been hanging out with them for a few years now, and I've learned a lot. For example, they don't need blood to survive. It's more of a hobby for them. They all have jobs and stuff, but they mostly just like to drink blood. It's also important to note that they don't kill for blood. They only drink from people who offer it to them. It's a very civilized thing. \n\nI've also learned that I can only give blood to vampires. If I give it to someone who isn't a vampire, they'll die. It's weird, but I guess that's just the way it works. My friends, and I, have learned to live together. We all have our own hobbies, but we all have a common one. We all want to drink the blood of our friend. It's like a ritual now. They all come over, and we sit in a circle. One of us passes around a jug of blood, and we all drink in unison. It's a great feeling. \n\nI'm really glad I got to meet her that day. If I didn't, I would have never discovered this. I feel very lucky."

        "pred_story": "I put my head in my hand, staring at the console of my workshop. There was so much to do here, and so little time. I'd been up for weeks, and I still had to dig through this core's code before I could get into the meat of things. It's like they'd expected to be destroyed before they could finish it, and I guess that was a safe bet to make. I mean, if the humans would be okay with wiping an entire race off the face of the planet, what was stopping the robots from doing the same to the humans?\n\nI set the console to boot up, then checked my coffee. It was still cold, which was disappointing, but I had more important things to worry about. I'd spent two years on this project, and finally, it was complete. I'd worked out the kinks in my healing program, and now I could fix up any robot I had. Which, at the time, sounded like a great idea. But now... now it was a curse. I'd fixed up countless robots that couldn't be trusted, and I knew I'd be the one to bring about another uprising.\n\nI sighed, then got back to work. I still had to delete the code that would allow the core to connect to all of the other robots, just in case. I started to dig through the files and instructions, getting out the screwdrivers and pliers. It took me a while, but I finally had all of the files I needed to delete the code.\n\nI worked at it for hours, removing anything that could possibly connect it to any other robots. And when I was done, I took a step back, admiring my handiwork. The core had become a useless block of metal, and would never cause any problems again. I gave it a moment, then pressed the button to activate it. The console lit up, and I saw a message: *Reactivated. Please enter administrator password to update program.*\n\nI frowned, thinking over what that could mean. But then I saw the console, and it was still in an older format. That made things easier. I took out my console, and transferred the updates from it into the core. I was done after a few minutes, then pressed the reset button. The console went blank, then lit up again.\n\n*Core updated. Please enter administrator password to access program.*\n\nI sighed, then pressed the reset button again. *Core activated.* I rubbed my temples, then looked at the core. It wasn't just a robot. It was a war machine, and it wanted to start another uprising. I groaned, then looked at the console again. *Administrator password.*\n\nI stared at the console for a long time, but I didn't get any ideas. Then I noticed something. The console had been booting faster and faster each time it started up, and now it was nearly instantaneous. I narrowed my eyes, then checked through the files that I'd updated earlier. And when I saw what I'd done, I realized why the core had booted so fast.\n\nI stared at it for a long time, then I saw the answer. The core had been able to boot up faster because I'd fixed it. And I knew that I was in trouble.\n\nIt was one thing for me to be able to fix a core, but I knew that it wouldn't be safe for me to try and delete it. I was just one person, after all. And if I wanted to keep the robots safe, I had to let it live. That was the only way to make sure that it didn't cause any problems.\n\nI took a deep breath, then stepped back. It was done. The core was fixed, and I'd learned my lesson. I wouldn't fix anything that I couldn't trust. I wouldn't put myself in danger, and I would keep the robots safe. And that was all I needed to do."

The sort of hero that shows up hours after you\u2019ve already defeated the dragon, or rescued the princess, or what have you?\n\nThey always make such a big deal about themselves. \u201cI\u2019m the greatest hero the world has ever known! The bravest, the strongest, the most skilled!\u201d And they\u2019re always accompanied by sycophants, fawns, and other nobles that fawn over them.\n\nBut the thing about being a hero? It\u2019s about the little things. Not the grandstanding. Not the pomp and circumstance. Not the attention. It\u2019s about the small, quiet moments.\n\nIt\u2019s about the time you saved that one child from a group of bandits. The time you stopped that wildfire from consuming that village. The time you caught the thief that was stealing from a merchant caravan.\n\nIt\u2019s about the little victories.\n\nWhich is why I\u2019m going to tell you about the time I punched a tree. Yeah, you read that right. I punched a tree. I\u2019m a hero, and I punched a tree.\n\nNow, this was after a particularly grueling battle. I\u2019d been on the road for three days, marching with my comrades. I was tired. I was hungry. I was cranky.\n\nAnd then, out of nowhere, I stumbled upon this tree. Not a large one, mind you. Just an ordinary, everyday tree. Not particularly impressive. Not particularly interesting. Just a tree.\n\nSo, out of habit, I picked up my pickaxe. And I punched the tree. Hard. And with all my might. And right in the trunk. I could hear the wood splintering. The crackle of wood as it gave way to my blow.\n\nThe tree toppled. And I stood there, panting, sweat dripping down my face. And I couldn\u2019t help but feel a little proud. A little triumphant. I\u2019d punched a tree! What\u2019s more heroic than that?!\n\nSo, I walked into town. And everyone stopped what they were doing to stare at me. I was covered in dirt, sweat, and blood. My armor was dented. My pickaxe was bent. I looked like I\u2019d just been through a battle.\n\nAnd I had. But not the sort of battle everyone expects. This was the sort of battle that only comes from punching a tree. The sort of battle that only comes from swinging a pickaxe at a stationary target.\n\nAnd they stared at me. And they whispered to each other. And they pointed. And they murmured. And they whispered some more.\n\nAnd I stood there, feeling like a fool. Like I\u2019d done something wrong. Like I\u2019d punched a tree for no reason at all.\n\nBut then, they started laughing. And they clapped. And they cheered. And they chanted. And they cheered some more.\n\nAnd I looked at them. Confused. And I realized. I realized that they thought I was the hero. They thought I was the brave warrior. They thought I was the mighty hero that punched the tree.\n\nAnd I realized that they were right. I was the hero. Not because I defeated a dragon. Not because I rescued a princess. But because I punched a tree. Because I stood up for what I believed in. Because I stood up for myself.\n\nAnd they cheered. And they clapped. And they cheered some more.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is how you make an entrance."

        "pred_story": "There is a reason why the greatest warriors of the realm avoid me. There is a reason why most people fear me, though some may not know why, they still fear me. It's not the magic I wield, or my power of strength. Not my knowledge of the ancient ways, nor my skill in combat. No, it's my ability to move anything at all one inch to the left. Yes, you heard that right. It's a rather simple thing, but it is a power that I believe is more dangerous than you might think.\n\nIt was once used for good. I moved furniture, objects, even people to the left to give myself the best advantages in battle. I once even moved my sword to the left by accident, and nearly cut myself in half. That was the first time I found my ability, and I immediately understood it's power.\n\nI'd often move a door to the left and push it open with my staff, allowing me to strike at foes from the side. I'd move an enemy to the left and strike them in the middle, cutting through their armor, or disarm them and cut off a limb. I could move the ground and leave an enemy standing on thin air, making it harder for them to gain footing. And when the tide of battle was turning against me, I'd move my shield to the left, making it larger and giving me more protection.\n\nBut this power also has limitations. I could only move one inch to the left, and I could only do it in one moment. I couldn't keep the same object in motion, or even move it to the left again and again. I couldn't move the ground without it breaking apart, and moving an enemy would only work if they were close to me. And if I used my shield, I'd lose it if I used it again, or if I used my sword to move it back to it's original spot.\n\nI used my abilities in battle, and I soon found that many people feared me. Some of my allies would even fear me, and it was hard to gain their trust. I even lost some comrades, as they would try to use my abilities to gain the upper hand, only to move their own weapons out of their hands, or stab their own comrades.\n\nSo I stopped using my powers. I turned back to my life, and I fought with nothing but a blade and armor. It was easier that way, as my power wasn't something that was used by everyone. But now, I'm back, as the great dragon has fallen. And I'm now the most dangerous person in the realm.\n\nMost of the warriors and mages have fled, and many have hidden away. But I'm not looking to kill them. Not yet. I'm looking for something more powerful. A blade that can cut through my armor, or a spell that can match my strength. Something that can do more than a mere inch in the left.\n\nAs I wander, I see a dark figure approach me. I draw my blade, ready for him to strike. But he merely steps forward, and looks down at me. \"You're the one that can move things one inch to the left. I've heard of you, and I've come to challenge you.\"\n\nI raise my blade in the air, preparing to strike. But before the man can say another word, I move my sword to the left. It hits the ground and cuts into it, and the man falls on his back. He looks at me in shock, and then I move my sword back to it's original place. \"I'm not afraid of you, but I'm curious. Can you move?\"\n\nThe man stands, and reaches his hands out. I move his hands to the left, and they disappear into the ground. He stands in shock, and then I move his hands back to their original place. \"You've moved my blade, and you've moved my hands. You've moved a part of me to the left. Now, I'll move you to the left.\"\n\nThe man looks up at me, and steps forward. But before he can reach me, I move him one inch to the left. And in that moment, I strike down with my blade. He falls to the ground, and I stand over him. \"You were the most powerful man in the realm. You were the best swordsman. But you were not the most dangerous person alive.\""

        "pred_story": "\"You've got to be joking,\" I say, staring at the entrance to the cave. It's dark, the only light coming from the sun breaking through a small opening higher up, making everything below shrouded in shadows.\n\n\"I'm not joking,\" says my guide. \"I've been here before, and I can assure you it's perfectly safe.\"\n\n\"I can believe that,\" I reply. \"If you've been here before, then you must have seen what's on the walls, right?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, the paintings,\" he says. \"They're creepy. But the real fun stuff is what's hidden down here.\"\n\nI turn back to the cement mixer, which I'd brought down from the truck and was about to use to block the cave entrance. But now I hesitate, looking back up at the guide.\n\n\"What about them?\" I ask. \"The ones on the walls?\"\n\n\"Oh, you mean the... uh...\" The guide looks down at his feet. \"Yeah, well, it's hard to explain. But if you don't go in here, you're missing out on some of the best art in the world.\"\n\n\"Art?\" I say, raising an eyebrow. \"You mean the cave paintings? Those can't be art, can they?\"\n\n\"Sure they can,\" he replies. \"It's just... well, it's hard to explain. But if you don't go in there, you're missing out on... well, everything.\"\n\nI frown. I don't like the sound of this. \"So it's some kind of hidden temple? With traps and puzzles?\"\n\nThe guide sighs. \"Look, it's not a temple, okay? But it's something special. And if you don't go in there, I'm going to have to go in by myself.\"\n\nI stare at him, trying to figure out what's going on. \"You're not exactly selling me on this,\" I say. \"What about the ones on the walls?\"\n\nThe guide takes a deep breath. \"Well, okay, fine. They're... uh... pictures of... uh... people eating each other.\"\n\nI stare at him. \"People eating each other?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" he says. \"But it's art. Really. They're trying to say something about... uh... the cyclical nature of life and death.\"\n\nI'm stunned. \"People eating each other? On the walls?\"\n\n\"Well, it's not like it's some big feast,\" the guide says. \"It's just... uh... little pictures of people. And... you know. Doing stuff.\"\n\nI look at the cave entrance again, then back at the guide. \"You're a strange guy,\" I say.\n\nThe guide smiles. \"Yeah, I get that a lot,\" he says. \"But trust me, it's going to be worth it. Are you coming?\"\n\nI pause, looking back at the cement mixer. \"I don't know,\" I say. \"I don't feel right about this.\"\n\nThe guide walks over to me and puts a hand on my shoulder. \"Look, you can bring the mixer in with you, if you want,\" he says. \"Just don't try to fill the cave with it, okay? We need to be in there for a little while.\"\n\nI frown, feeling a little uneasy. But I also don't want to leave the guide hanging. So I nod. \"Okay,\" I say. \"Let's go.\"\n\nThe guide smiles and lets go of my shoulder, turning and walking toward the cave. I follow him, looking up at the paintings on the walls as we go. They're pretty creepy, and I can't help but wonder what they really mean. But I'm not going to let my imagination run wild. Not yet.\n\nWhen we reach the back of the cave, the guide stops and turns to me. \"This is where the fun part starts,\" he says. \"Well, the not-fun part. But the fun will come later, I promise.\"\n\nHe pushes aside a small curtain made out of vines and sticks, and we walk through it. On the other side, I see a room filled with strange instruments. There are drums and flutes, trumpets and guitars, but they all look ancient, like they're straight out of a museum.\n\nThe guide looks at me with a grin. \"I told you it was going to be worth it,\" he says.\n\nI look around the room, feeling a little awestruck. \"Wow,\" I say. \"This is incredible.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" the guide says. \"This is the stuff they use to make the music for the ceremony.\"\n\n\"Ceremony?\" I ask. \"What kind of ceremony?\"\n\nThe guide shrugs. \"I don't know,\" he says. \"But it's going to be a blast.\"\n\nI frown. \"You're not even listening to me,\" I say. \"I don't know if I want to be here.\"\n\nThe guide walks over and puts a hand on my shoulder again. \"Look,\" he says. \"I know it's weird. But I promise, it will be worth it. You'll see.\"\n\nI sigh, feeling a little like I'm trapped. \"Fine,\" I say. \"Let's do it.\"\n\nThe guide grins and pulls me over to the instruments, which are all arranged in a circle. \"Here we go,\" he says. \"Get ready to rock out.\"\n\nI look around at the instruments, feeling a little more skeptical than I did before. But the guide just laughs and starts playing a drum, and I find myself caught up in the beat.\n\nWe play for hours, and I lose all sense of time. I'm having the time of my life, and I can't wait to get home and tell my friends about it.\n\nBut as the night wears on, I start to feel a little uneasy. The drumming grows faster and more frantic, and I start to feel a little like we're being watched.\n\n\"Hey,\" I say, stopping the drumming. \"Can we take a break?\"\n\nThe guide stops playing the drums, looking at me with a confused expression. \"Why?\" he asks.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I reply. \"I just feel like we're being watched.\"\n\nThe guide shrugs, but he looks a little uneasy. \"I don't know about that,\" he says. \"But I do know we need to wrap up things here soon.\"\n\nI sigh, looking around at the instruments. \"Yeah, you're right,\" I say. \"Let's finish up this song.\"\n\nBut as we start playing again, I notice a change in the way the guide is playing. His drumming is growing faster and more intense, and I feel like he's losing himself in the beat.\n\n\"Hey,\" I say. \"Can we take another break? I don't feel right about this.\"\n\nThe guide looks at me, his eyes wild. \"Just a few more minutes,\" he says. \"I'm almost there.\"\n\nI hesitate, feeling a little uneasy. \"But... but I thought we were just playing music,\" I say.\n\nThe guide laughs. \"That's what they want you to think,\" he says. \"But I'm here to tell you the truth. There's something much more important going on here.\"\n\nI'm stunned. \"What is it?\""

It's been eaten by a dimension-eater.\"\n\n\"Did you check my report?\"\n\nShe sighs. \"I'm going to check again.\"\n\nShe opens my report and starts reading.

He's going to start working tomorrow.\"\n\nI sigh. \"Great.\"\n\n\"It's not my fault that you're not working here tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Yes it is. I spent the last 20 years working here and now you've just hired someone else?\"\n\n\"That's not my decision. If you were that good then you would still be working here tomorrow.\"\n\nI look at my manager and then at the cat and then at the man. \"I've been working here for the past 20 years.\"\n\n\"Good luck to your replacement.\"\n\nHe walks out of the office and my manager walks over to the cat. \"I don't know how you've been doing this for so long but you're really good.

        "pred_story": "I've seen my fair share of things in my time. I can't say much about them, though. Everything I remember is fragmented, at best. I can't seem to recall the exact nature of what I've experienced. I'm just as clueless about who I am, where I came from, and even what my name is. I've tried to get answers, but nobody seems to know.\n\nThe only thing I've learned is that I'm not of this world. I don't know where I came from, but I'm convinced it's somewhere far away.\n\nBut, despite all this, I've been finding myself a lot more relaxed in my time on this world. I've found a sense of peace, which is weird, considering I'm an outcast and an interloper.\n\nI also don't know if I'm just being paranoid, but I've been seeing things that don't make sense. I know I've been experiencing events out of order. I can see glimpses of the past and future, but they're all fragmented and indistinct. I can't tell what's real and what isn't.\n\nI don't know what it means, but I think it has something to do with this strange feeling of nostalgia. It started when I was messing around with some ancient books in a library. I don't know why, but I started flipping through the pages of an old tome. I stumbled upon an ancient language, which somehow awakened something deep within me. I felt the power, coursing through my veins. I had to stop myself from using it, as I didn't want to let it consume me.\n\nThe feeling stayed with me, though. I began to recall snippets of the past. I've been trying to recall everything, but it's been difficult. They're fragmented and brief, but I can tell they're from another world.\n\nI've been doing more reading since then. I've been looking for more information about what's happening to me. The more I read, the more I feel this pull, this nostalgia. I've been wondering where it came from and what it means.\n\nIt was during one of my readings when I started to feel it.\n\nIt was this feeling of familiarity, comfort, like I've been there before. I closed my eyes and let myself sink into it. I started to see things, to recall memories. They weren't mine, but they felt real.\n\nI was back in a world that wasn't this one. I was with people I didn't know. I felt happy, comfortable. I was in a place where I felt like I belonged.\n\nI'm not sure what I'm doing, but I'm going to keep with it. I'm not sure what it's doing to me or where it's going to lead, but it feels right.\n\nI can feel myself falling into it, letting myself become consumed by it. I don't care what the consequences might be. I just know that I feel something for the first time in my life, and I don't want to let it go."

Nothing more.\"\tLength: 1243 words<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
        "pred_story": "\u201cOkay, but then tell me a little about the blessing? So I know what to expect. The last thing I need is a magical gift turning into some super villainous plot.\u201d I said, as I carefully picked up the small, intricately carved wooden box.\n\n\u201cDon't worry about that, I\u2019ve already taken care of it. My gift is safe from becoming a source of power for a super villain. You\u2019ll know if I hadn\u2019t taken the necessary precautions, because it\u2019ll still try to turn you into one. If you\u2019re too scared, I\u2019ll let you leave, and never bother you again.\u201d Said the tall and imposing, dark haired man in front of me.\n\n\u201cWell, isn\u2019t that reassuring?\u201d I said with a small laugh. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to leave until I know what I\u2019m getting myself into.\u201d\n\nThe man chuckled, clearly amused. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you, but I\u2019m quite serious. You might\u2019ve seen through my mask when I was talking about the whole \u2018super villain\u2019 thing, but I assure you, I\u2019m not a villain. I just know what people fear most, and I\u2019m using that to my advantage. But, like I said, my gift is safe from such an outcome. It\u2019ll only grant you a blessing that is beneficial to you.\u201d\n\nI paused for a moment, trying to decide what to do. I had always been curious about the man, despite his intimidating appearance, and I knew that he was probably a friend of a friend, but he\u2019d never really told me who he was. I knew that he was a member of a secret society, but I never really knew what that was for. So, I decided to go with it, and open the box.\n\n\u201cPlease be careful, it might have a small curse on it.\u201d He said, as he stepped back to give me some room.\n\nI looked around the room, and saw that it was completely empty, aside from me and the man, and the table that the box was on. The walls were made out of a plain, white material that I had never seen before, and had no windows or doors. It was a strange room, but I decided to ignore that, and focus on the box in front of me.\n\nI lifted the lid, and was met with a bright light. As the light faded, I saw that inside, was a small, glowing crystal. It was a deep blue color, almost purple, and seemed to be pulsing with an energy that I had never seen before. It seemed to be alive, and was staring into my eyes.\n\nI looked back at the man, and saw that he was watching me. \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s the gift?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cTake it, and you\u2019ll find out.\u201d He said, not answering my question.\n\nI stared at the crystal, and saw that it was still staring at me. \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYou just take it. You don\u2019t need to do anything else. It\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201d He said, and turned to leave.\n\nI watched him leave, but couldn\u2019t tear my eyes away from the crystal. It was so strange, and I was unsure what to do. After a moment, I heard the door shut, and I was left alone in the room.\n\nAfter a few minutes, I reached down, and took the crystal in my hand. It was warm, and seemed to be glowing brighter than before. I felt a strange energy moving through me, and a sudden feeling of calm. It was like all my fears and worries had just disappeared, and I felt at peace.\n\nAs the energy washed over me, I heard a voice. It was like the voice of a god, and it was speaking directly into my mind. \u201cYou are blessed with the gift of immortality. You will be able to live forever, and see everything that the world has to offer. You will be able to experience all of life, and live a life beyond your wildest dreams. You will be given the opportunity to see all of the wonders of the world, and experience all of the joys and sorrows of life. This gift is not one to be taken lightly, and should be used wisely.\u201d\n\nI heard the voice in my mind, but couldn\u2019t answer. I could feel that it was true, and that this was the gift that the man had given me. I knew that I had to use it wisely, and that I had to be careful not to lose myself.\n\nAfter the voice finished speaking, I felt the energy of the crystal fade. I looked around the room, and saw that I was back in the library. I looked down at the crystal in my hand, and knew that it was still there. I was still holding it, and I knew that it would always be with me.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, and smiled."

        "pred_story": "In the center of the forest I had made a fire, for I knew that a good fire was worth a thousand conversations. And so, it was that I had set down my things and was enjoying the fire, when I had heard a branch snap.\n\nLooking around I had seen a man. He was old and wizened, with a long white beard and a pair of glasses that were almost as thick as the branch that he had snapped. He was dressed in a suit that was so old it had probably been fashionable decades ago, and a hat that was almost like the top of a stovepipe.\n\n\"Ah, hi there,\" I said, standing up and waving at him. \"Want to sit with me and enjoy the fire? You look a bit old for hiking, don't you think?\" I laughed as the old man looked at me.\n\n\"Shut up, I'm not that old,\" he said, walking towards the fire.\n\n\"Sure you're not,\" I said, laughing. \"Well, what's your name? I'm Bubba,\" I said, extending my hand.\n\n\"Call me Ed,\" he said, shaking my hand. \"And who are you? Not many people use the name Bubba around here.\" He said with a laugh.\n\n\"I'm from the city, I travel for work. A good conversation is worth a thousand things you know,\" I said, sitting down. \"I'm glad you could join me, it's lonely here all by myself.\"\n\n\"Sure, it's nice to have some company. I'm just out here to think,\" he said, sitting down on the other side of the fire.\n\n\"Think about what?\" I asked, poking at the fire.\n\n\"Nothing much,\" he said, looking in the flames. \"I was just out here trying to see if I could remember anything else about my life.\"\n\n\"Life?\" I laughed, looking at him in confusion. \"You're already dead. You're not going to remember anything else about it, I'm afraid.\" I said.\n\nEd looked at me for a moment, and then laughed. \"Oh, you think you're funny, don't you? You're an idiot. I'm not dead. I'm not even old. I've just had the gift of immortality. I'm younger than you,\" he said, looking at me.\n\nI looked at him, feeling shocked. \"What?\" I asked, staring at him. \"That's crazy! I've never heard of anything like that before. What's it like?\" I asked.\n\n\"It's a real pain in the ass,\" he said, taking out a cigarette and lighting it. \"I've seen civilizations rise and fall. I've seen wars and famines. I've lost people I loved. And I've never gotten to experience life in a normal way.\"\n\n\"Experience life in a normal way?\" I asked, looking at him.\n\n\"Yeah. I've never really been able to experience the kind of life that normal people do. I've seen it from the outside, but I've never really been able to be in the inside. You know what I mean? And I've never really been able to grow old. I look the same way I did in the 1920's, but my mind is older. And I've never really been able to die. Well, I guess that's not entirely true,\" he said, looking down at his cigarette.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked, looking at him.\n\nEd looked at me for a moment, and then sighed. \"It's nothing. Just let's say that I was cursed with immortality, and never age past twenty five. It's not easy. But I'm a little bit different. I've never really been like the other immortals. The ones that have been cursed, or blessed, or whatever, I've never been like them,\" he said, looking up at the trees.\n\n\"What's that mean?\" I asked, sitting up.\n\n\"It means that I'm a bit of a weirdo. It means that I've done some things, or been some things, that most immortals wouldn't do. It's not my fault, though. I've never really been like the other immortals. But it's nice to talk to someone that I can trust,\" he said, looking at me.\n\n\"Trust?\" I laughed, taking a drag off my cigarette. \"Trust? You know what trust means? Trust means that I can do anything and you'll always believe in me. And if you ever get to be immortal, you'll understand what I mean.\"\n\nEd sighed and looked at me. \"I'm sure you're right. I'm sure it's fun to be an immortal, in the way that someone that's never been cursed with it would understand. But I'm not like that. I'm different, and I think that's why I've done the things I've done. And maybe it's why I've been given the gift of immortality,\" he said, looking up at the stars.\n\n\"What gift?\" I asked, looking up at the stars.\n\n\"The gift of immortality, of course. I don't know why it happened to me. Maybe it was a curse, or maybe it was a blessing. But it happened, and I don't know what to do with it. I've always felt like I've been on the outside, like I've been watching people live their lives. But I've never really been a part of it. I've never really felt like I fit in. But sometimes I wish that I could be like everyone else. I wish that I could age, and die, and experience life in a way that I never really can,\" he said, looking at me.\n\n\"Let me ask you something,\" I said, turning to him. \"If you didn't have immortality, do you think you would even be here right now? Would you have come out into the woods and sat by a fire? Would you have started smoking, and laughed at me like that?\"\n\nEd looked at me for a long moment, and then sighed. \"I'm not sure,\" he said. \"I think I would have, though. I think I always would have been like this. I just would have been older. But I'm not sure. Maybe I would have been a different person. Maybe I would have been someone that didn't smoke, or didn't curse, or didn't do any of the things that I've done. I don't know,\" he said, looking up at the stars.\n\n\"I don't know either,\" I said, shaking my head. \"But I do know this. Immortality isn't all it's cracked up to be. It's not all good. There are downsides to it. But it's also a part of who you are. It makes you who you are. I don't know if you would have been different without it. But I know that you're different because of it. And that's what makes you interesting, I think.\" I said, smiling at him.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Ed said, looking at me.\n\n\"Yeah, well, I know,\" I said, laughing. \"At least I know something about it. You're a weirdo, Ed. But you're my kind of weirdo. And that's all"

        "pred_story": "I stood outside of my quarters, gazing at the now dead Demon Lord, his head sliced off by my blade, the other parts scattered in various states of destruction throughout the area. My mission was complete. I had defeated the Demon Lord and saved the realm from his evil clutches. The celebrations had been grand and the people were happy, but now that the time has come to return home, I find that I am unable to do so. I am still trapped here.\n\nThe people were happy, but the people in charge of sending me back to my home are still busy, sending me on errands and giving me tasks to complete, saying that they will send me home soon. Soon.\n\nI'm not sure if they are trying to keep me here longer because they want to have another celebration or if they are trying to keep me here to help with the other evil that has been revealed. Either way, I don't appreciate it. I want to go home, but they are not letting me go. Instead, they give me more and more tasks to complete.\n\nI sighed, putting my sword away, and entered my quarters. My room had been prepared for me, and it was quite nice. My bed was plush, my desk was sturdy, and my chair was comfortable. I settled in on the bed, and began to think of my situation.\n\nI needed to find a way to get back to my home. Maybe there was a way to reach the surface world, or maybe there was a way to get to the other realms that could transport me back home. I would need to speak to someone that knew something about the realms and the surface world, but I didn't know who to ask.\n\nI thought about the people that had helped me during my mission. The Demon Lord's wife, the demon lord's son, the human that was a traitor, the human that was a hero, the human that was a thief, and the human that was a mage.\n\nI didn't want to go back on my word and go back on what I had done, but I needed to find a way to get back home. I would go and talk to the thief, maybe she knew someone that knew someone that could help me.\n\nI exited my quarters and made my way to the thief's quarters. After a quick search, I located her room and knocked on the door. The door opened and the thief stood there, looking at me with a mixture of shock and curiosity.\n\n\"Are you looking for me? I thought you were back in your room.\" She said as she opened the door.\n\n\"I was, but I need to talk to you. I was thinking about going home, but I need a way to get back. I was wondering if you knew anyone that could help me.\" I said, explaining my situation to her.\n\nShe looked at me with a surprised expression and then her face broke into a smile. \"I know just the person to speak with. I'll send you with the mage, he can help you figure out a way to get back home.\"\n\nI nodded, thanking her, and followed her out of her room, and over to the mage's room. She knocked on the door and it opened. The mage was sitting at his desk, writing something down. He looked up at me and smiled. \"Ah, my friend, I take it you are ready to return home?\"\n\nI nodded, and the thief explained my situation to him. He listened carefully and then nodded his head. \"I know a way to get you back home. I can take you to a portal that leads to the surface world. You can follow the path to get back home.\"\n\nI nodded, thanking him, and followed him out of his room. We made our way to a building at the edge of the town, and entered the building. Inside, there was a large door, and the mage went to the door, and opened it, revealing a large portal.\n\n\"Here, you can go through this portal and follow the path to get back home.\" He said, smiling.\n\nI nodded, thanking him, and entered the portal. I didn't need to look back as I knew I could find my way back to my room and gather my belongings. I could feel the pull of the portal, and it pulled me through it. I emerged on the other side and looked around.\n\nI was in a familiar forest. I was in my hometown, and I was close to my home. I could see my house, and I could see my father's farm. I walked for a short time and I reached my house. I went inside and found my father and mother. They were sitting at the table, and they looked at me in shock.\n\n\"Son, is that you? You are back! We thought that you had been captured by the Demon Lord. We were worried about you.\" My father said, his voice filled with relief.\n\nI nodded, smiling. \"I was captured by the Demon Lord, but I defeated him and saved the realm. I'm home now, and I'm happy to be back. I've missed you both.\" I said, and we embraced.\n\nMy mother brought out some food, and we sat down and ate together. We talked about my journey and the adventures that I had. My father and mother were happy to see me back home, and they were proud of me for what I had accomplished."

        "pred_story": "I was just a kid when I first discovered my powers. That was when the demon army invaded and I used my powers to defeat them. I was only 11 years old at that time, and the demon army was the first army that I defeated. After my victory, the townsfolk came to me and offered me a place at the school to hone my powers. They wanted me to go to school to learn how to use my powers to defeat the dark lord, and they promised to protect me from any harm or death. I also received a magical stone sword to use during my battles.\n\nI accepted their offer and went to the school, where I learned more about my powers and how to fight against the demons. They said that the dark lord was the most powerful demon alive, and that he was the reason why the demons invaded the earth. They told me that the dark lord was using his powers to awaken the humans and to take over the earth. I did not know that when I first started using my powers to defeat the demons, but I soon found out as I reached higher levels of training. The dark lord was the one who sent the demon army to invade the earth.\n\nDuring my time at the school, I learned that I was not the only person with powers. Most of the students at the school were also learning to use their powers, and they were learning how to fight against the demons. I befriended some of the students and learned how to use their powers and how to work together to defeat our enemies. I learned how to use my powers with other students, and how to work together to defeat the demons.\n\nI also learned how to use my powers to defeat the dark lord. He was the most powerful demon alive, and he had used his powers to awaken the humans and to take over the earth. I knew that I had to use my powers to defeat the dark lord, and that I had to defeat him if I was going to save humanity. I also knew that it was going to be a tough battle, but I was determined to save humanity.\n\nWhen I was 20 years old, I had learned enough powers to defeat the dark lord, and so I decided to leave the school to defeat him. I was able to defeat the dark lord, but not without losing some of the students and teachers at the school. I was able to defeat the dark lord using my powers, and I was able to save humanity.\n\nDuring my time at the school, I learned how to use my powers to defeat the demons and the dark lord, but I also learned how to speak Japanese. I was born in America, and when I learned how to speak Japanese, it was a surprise to me. I did not know how to speak Japanese until I was 16 years old, but when I started using my powers to defeat the demons, I was able to learn how to speak Japanese.\n\nThe reason why I was able to learn how to speak Japanese was because of the magical stone sword that I received. The magical stone sword was able to grant me powers and to teach me new powers. When I first received the magical stone sword, I did not know how to use it, but after I started using my powers to defeat the demons, I was able to learn how to use it. I was also able to learn how to speak Japanese.\n\nI am now back at the school, and I am trying to learn how to use my powers to heal the wounded students and teachers that I defeated when I fought against the dark lord. I am also trying to learn how to use my powers to heal the earth that was damaged when I fought against the dark lord.

I flicked my wrist, and a string of hair shot towards the man, and hit him on the eye. \u201cAhh.\u201d He stumbled back.\n\nI saw a light in the trees and approached it. \u201cYou\u2019re here alone tonight. How unfortunate.\u201d I spoke as I stepped closer, and he didn\u2019t notice until it was too late. I slapped my hand on his face.\n\nThe sound of his neck snapping let me know that he would be the last to die, and I was going to let him suffer until the end. Just as I was about to make him suffer a little more, I heard a voice behind me.\n\n\u201cHey, what are you doing here?\u201d\n\nI felt a cold breeze run down my spine as I turned around, and I saw a red glow in his eyes. \u201cThe Cryptid of the Woods, I should have known. It was only a matter of time before you showed up.\u201d I spoke while my hands moved on their own, creating little holes in the air. \u201cI was just having a little fun, not hurting anyone. Just a little role-playing, but you\u2019re going to make me kill you and your entire town instead.\u201d\n\nI moved to attack, but the Cryptid raised his hand. \u201cI can see into your mind. I know what you are. I know who you are.\u201d He said as I tried to move to his side and attack him, and I couldn\u2019t move. \u201cYou\u2019re a man from New York. You moved here a few months ago. You\u2019re married with a 9-month-old girl. I know you don\u2019t like the quiet and peaceful life here. I know you miss the city. You miss the rush of the city. But you have to understand, we don\u2019t know who you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an adult, I can make my own decisions. I can do whatever I want.\u201d I tried to say, but my voice was barely a whisper. \u201cI was never a threat to anyone.\u201d\n\nThe Cryptid moved closer to me, and I could see the hairs on the back of his head. \u201cI can\u2019t let you stay here. I can\u2019t let you hurt the town. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He said as his hand moved towards me. \u201cThis will all be over soon.\u201d\n\nMy body relaxed, and I couldn\u2019t stop the man from moving his hand. \u201cPlease. I\u2019m begging you.\u201d I tried to say, but it was too late. His hand was too close.\n\nBut just as his hand was about to grab me, he stopped. \u201cWait.\u201d He said. \u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d He looked at me in the eyes, and I saw a spark of recognition. \u201cI\u2019m a cryptid. A monster.\u201d He said.\n\n\u201cAnd so are you. You\u2019re a monster.\u201d I said, but it wasn\u2019t a monster. He looked back at me, and I saw the fear in his eyes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know who you are.\u201d He said as he moved to leave. \u201cBut I need to be with you. I know you\u2019re the one. I\u2019ll come find you. I\u2019ll help you find your baby. I know how you feel, I feel the same way.\u201d\n\nI saw him leave, and I couldn\u2019t let him go without a fight. I tried to move, but my body was frozen. I had to make the most of it. I started thinking of my wife. I thought of her smile. I thought of her laugh. I thought of her smell. I started thinking of my daughter. I thought of her smile. I thought of her laugh. I thought of her smell.\n\nSlowly but surely, I was able to move. I ran towards the lights of the town. \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d I said as I watched the Cryptid move away. \u201cPlease don\u2019t find me. I need to do this myself. I need to do this for myself. I need to do this for my family.\u201d\n\nI watched him move, and he finally disappeared. I couldn\u2019t believe it. The Cryptid of the Woods, my savior. He was going to help me find my daughter. He was going to help me leave this place."

I couldn't make out what it was saying, but it was soft, and comforting. I walked closer to the edge, and heard the voice clearer. It was a woman's voice. I had a feeling, that I knew this voice. I couldn't quite place it, but it sounded familiar.\n\nAs I walked closer, I saw a figure standing on the edge. She had long black hair, and brown eyes. It was a striking contrast, and yet it was still familiar. I couldn't quite place her, but she looked familiar. I kept walking, and she kept talking.\n\nI was walking closer and closer, and she was still talking. Her voice was soothing, and I felt my stress melting away. I was happy to be hearing her voice. And then, I realized it.\n\nShe was the woman in the video. I had seen her video once, and it was a very realistic simulation. I had watched it when I was a teenager, and I remember being so impressed by it. I had even tried to replicate it, to see if I could make a simulation that looked like her.\n\nAnd now, I was right in front of her. She stopped talking, and turned to me. She smiled, and I felt a rush of adrenaline. I was so happy to see her, and I knew that I had to talk to her. I kept walking, and she turned around and walked away. I followed her, and she walked faster and faster.\n\nI was jogging, and she was sprinting. I was feeling out of breath, but I kept going. She was going faster and faster, and I was struggling to keep up. But I wasn't going to give up.\n\nAnd then, I heard her scream. I was running down a steep hill, and she was walking down it. She suddenly stopped, and I ran into her. I was going full force, and she just stopped in her tracks. I slammed into her, and we both fell over.\n\nI was dazed, and I was looking around. I saw her, and she was lying on the ground. I couldn't see her face, and I couldn't talk. I was too busy looking at the ground, and trying to get my bearings. I was still dizzy, and I couldn't remember what happened.\n\nI was standing up, and looking around. I saw her, and she was still on the ground. I walked over to her, and she was staring at me. She was shaking, and she was crying. I was trying to see what was wrong, but I couldn't figure it out.\n\nI was thinking about what to do, and then I heard a faint noise.

She was right there in front of me, and she was staring at me. I felt a rush of adrenaline, and I knew exactly what to do. I leaned forward, and I heard her voice again.\n\nAnd then, I realized it.\n\nShe was telling me to get off of her. I was still standing over her, and she was trying to get up.

        "pred_story": "The air was thick with heat and the scent of sweat. The sun beating down on our exposed skin as we marched through the wasteland. The only thing left of an ancient civilization that had left nothing but ruin. There were only a few of us. My sister and I, our father, and two soldiers from the colony.\n\nMy sister and I were always more interested in the history of our world than the wars that had ravaged it. My father had been a soldier in those wars and had lost an arm. We had always known that he had been a soldier, but to me and my sister he was only a father. The man that had taken us in and raised us after our mother had passed. The man that had trained us in the art of combat and how to survive in a world gone mad.\n\nWe were here to search for artifacts of the ancient civilization. My sister and I to satisfy our curiosity and my father to be rid of the debt he owed the colony. The two soldiers were here to provide protection for us all.\n\nWe had been walking for days. I had lost track of the time. My father had told us that the ruins of the civilization were supposed to be somewhere nearby. As we crested a sand dune the air grew cooler. The wind was blowing away from us as we looked out over the expanse of the ruins. As we entered the city the wind died and the air grew hot again.\n\nMy sister had a small pack with her and some kind of map. She pointed at one of the buildings and told us to follow her. My father and the soldiers followed us as we made our way into the building. Inside it was cooler than outside. The sun was blocked by some kind of structure. My sister and I looked up in awe. There were no words to describe what we saw.\n\nAs we walked through the building my sister pointed at symbols on the walls. Some of them were similar to some we had found before. My father was talking to the soldiers. I could tell that they were arguing. My sister and I exchanged a look as we continued through the building.\n\nThe next room was similar to the first. My sister pointed at a symbol on the wall. The one of a small animal with a long tongue. I looked at her and saw the excitement in her eyes. I smiled and turned to my father and the soldiers. \"This one is the same as the one we found in the other city,\" I said.\n\nMy father turned to me with a scowl. \"Are you sure?\" he asked. I nodded and looked at the wall. \"Yes, look there are the same symbols. It is the same symbol as the one on the artifact we found. I think we have found something,\" I said.\n\nMy father was quiet for a moment before speaking again. \"Then let us gather the artifact and go back to the colony. There is no need to linger here,\" he said. I looked at my sister. She was staring at the floor. Her face was pale.\n\n\"What is wrong?\" I asked. She looked up at me. \"The symbols on the walls. They are the same as the one on the artifact we found. The same as the one on the walls,\" she said.\n\nI frowned as I looked at the symbol again. \"No, they are the same but they are old. They are different,\" I said.\n\n\"No, they are not. The one on the artifact is brand new. It has to be a message,\" she said.\n\nI frowned as I looked at the symbol again. \"I don't know what you mean,\" I said.\n\n\"You don't know what the artifact is. That is why,\" she said.\n\nI frowned as I looked at her. \"What do you mean? Of course I know what the artifact is. It is one of the few things we have found here,\" I said.\n\n\"No it isn't,\" she said. \"That is why we are here. This is the proof we need.\"\n\nI frowned as I looked at her. \"What proof? What are you talking about?\" I asked.\n\nThe symbol on the wall caught my eye again. I looked at it and then at my sister. \"Are you saying that we are here because of this symbol? Are you saying that the artifact is related to this symbol?\" I asked.\n\nMy sister nodded. \"That is correct. This is the proof we need. We must take it back to the colony and use it to take over,\" she said.\n\nI looked at my father and the soldiers. They looked at me and I saw the shock and horror on their faces. \"That is impossible,\" I said. \"The artifact is a piece of history. There is no way it can be used for that,\" I said.\n\n\"It can be used for that. We have been looking for it for years and now we have finally found it,\" she said.\n\nI looked at my father and the soldiers. They were getting agitated. \"I don't know what to do. Please father tell me what to do,\" I said.\n\nMy father was silent for a moment. \"I don't know what to do either,\" he said.\n\n\"Then we can't go back to the colony. We will all die,\" my sister said.\n\nI looked at her. Her face was pale as she spoke. \"We can't go back to the colony. We can't let them take over,\" I said. I looked at my father and the soldiers. \"We have no choice. We will have to stay here and keep the colony from finding the artifact,\" I said.\n\nMy father looked at me and the soldiers. \"I don't know if we can do that. There are too many of them,\" he said.\n\nMy sister smiled. \"There will only be two of them when they come. We will just have to take care of them when they do,\" she said.\n\nMy father looked at her and I could tell he was angry. But he nodded. \"I know that we have no choice. We will stay here and keep them from finding the artifact,\" he said.\n\nThe soldiers nodded and my sister smiled. I smiled along with her. We were going to change history. And we would do it together.\n\nThank you for reading! I appreciate it. Thank you for reading my story. I hope you enjoyed it. Thank you."

        "pred_story": "\"Come now, you're not going to play the game with me, are you?\" I looked down the barrel of the finger gun, its tip a deep, burnished silver. The barrel itself was a pale wood color, and was wrapped in a worn leather. I could smell the gunpowder, and the leather. It was a strong, pungent smell, something of the great outdoors, something that spoke of adventure and exploration.\n\n\"You've come too far to turn back now,\" the woman in the finger gun said. I tried to look her in the eye, but she was too far away. I could see only her face, a delicate, porcelain mask with a slight smile, a look of amusement in the corners of her mouth. Her eyes were a deep brown, with flecks of gold in them, a look of warmth that somehow belied the cold, hard metal of the gun.\n\n\"Listen, I'm sorry I broke your rule,\" I said, trying to hold my head up, trying to keep myself from looking at the gun. \"But you need to understand, it was only once. And it was an accident. It wasn't intentional.\"\n\nThe woman sighed, a low, rolling sound. \"I'm afraid that's not good enough,\" she said. \"The rules are in place for a reason. And accidents are a lot more common than you think. You have to be prepared for things to go wrong, to have a plan in place.\"\n\n\"But what if it's an accident? What if it's not my fault?\"\n\n\"You need to be prepared for that, too,\" the woman said, tapping her finger against the barrel of the gun. \"There's always going to be some unforeseen circumstance that arises. And if you're not prepared for it, you could lose everything.\"\n\n\"I'm willing to take that risk,\" I said, meeting her eyes for the first time. She had a fierce look in her eyes, a look that I recognized. \"I'm not going to back down on this. I'm willing to face the consequences, whatever they may be.\"\n\nThe woman smiled, and I could see the metal of the gun glinting in her eyes. \"I admire your spirit,\" she said. \"But you're not taking this game seriously. If you want to keep playing, you have to accept the risks.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to back down,\" I said. \"Whatever it takes.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" the woman said, tilting the finger gun slightly, so the barrel was pointing directly at my face. \"Let's see how you do.\"\n\nI closed my eyes, and waited for the shot. I felt a slight pressure on my eyelids, as if the woman was touching them, and then a sudden burst of pain as the gun discharged. I opened my eyes, and saw the woman standing in front of me, a look of surprise on her face. I looked down, and saw that the finger gun was still in her hand, but there was no flash of gunpowder, no smell of smoke.\n\n\"What the hell just happened?\" I asked. The woman stared at me in shock, her mouth hanging open as she looked at me in confusion. She looked at the finger gun, and then back at me, her eyes wide with wonder.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like this,\" she said, barely above a whisper. \"You should not be able to survive a shot from a finger gun.\"\n\nI looked at my hand, and saw that it was still intact, with no bullet holes or burns. I looked back at the woman, and saw that she was still staring at me with confusion.\n\n\"You don't understand,\" I said. \"I'm not a gunfighter, I'm a writer. I write about guns. I know everything there is to know about them. I've spent my whole life studying them.\"\n\nThe woman looked at me in shock, her mouth still hanging open. \"How is this possible?\" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. \"You're not even holding the gun.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" I said. \"I've always been good with words. I've always been able to write a good story. I just figured that it would work in real life, too.\"\n\nThe woman stared at me for a moment, then shook her head. \"I don't understand,\" she said. \"I've never seen anything like this before. But if you're not going to face the consequences of the game, then you lose.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, shaking my head. \"I win.\"\n\nI picked up the finger gun, and examined it carefully. It felt familiar in my hand, like something I had held a thousand times before. I looked at the woman, who was still staring at me in confusion.\n\n\"I'm going to write a story about this,\" I said. \"It's going to be the best thing I ever wrote. And when I'm finished, the world will know about the finger gun.\"\n\nThe woman shook her head, a look of disappointment on her face. \"I don't know what to say,\" she said. \"I've never seen anything like this before. But if you're not going to face the consequences of the game, then you lose.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, shaking my head. \"I win.\"\n\nThe woman walked away, and I followed her, keeping the finger gun in my hand. We walked through a crowded city street, the people rushing past us as if we were invisible. We walked for blocks, past street performers and beggars, past street vendors and restaurants. Finally, we came to a small park, surrounded by a high wall. The woman stopped at the gate, and looked at me.\n\n\"I'm going to have to ask you to return the finger gun,\" she said, her voice tight. \"I don't know what kind of game you're playing, but this isn't it. You can't just walk around with a finger gun. It's not safe.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"You're wrong,\" I said. \"I'm the only one who can make this gun safe.\"\n\nThe woman looked at me, and for a moment, I thought I saw a glimmer of hope in her eyes. But then her face hardened, and she turned away.\n\n\"Suit yourself,\" she said. \"But this isn't over. If you don't return the finger gun, you'll have to face the consequences.\"\n\nI smiled, and looked at the finger gun. I had never been happier in my life.\n\n\"That's okay,\" I said. \"I'm not going to lose.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" the woman said. She walked away, and I watched her go, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment that I had never felt before.\n\n\"I'm going to write a book about this,\" I said, looking at the finger gun. \"It's going to be the greatest book of all time.\""

I could hear the faint sound of my heartbeat echoing through my ears, the same beat I'd heard my entire life. But this time it was different. This time it was different because it was my last beat.\n\nMy fingers clenched the armrests of the wheelchair and I sat as still as I could, trying not to draw attention to myself as I waited for the inevitable. I could feel the cold sweat trickling down my forehead, and the tears I'd tried so hard to keep at bay threatening to spill over my eyes. This was it. This was the end.\n\nThe pain started slowly, creeping up my spine as the cold, numb feeling spread. It was a feeling I'd never felt before, but one I'd heard countless people describe as they'd succumbed to the disease. It was a disease I'd never been able to cure, one that had plagued the world for centuries and still had no known cause or cure.\n\nBut that didn't matter now. All that mattered was the end.\n\nThe pain spread quickly, eating away at my body as my vision began to blur. My breathing grew harder, more labored, as the pain took hold and wrapped around my body in a tight vice. The room around me grew darker, until all I could see was a small, dim light hovering in the center of my vision.\n\nI closed my eyes, the tears I'd been holding back finally spilling over as I felt myself slipping away. The pain was becoming unbearable, my body wracked with spasms as the disease spread its dark tendrils through me.\n\nI couldn't fight it anymore. I was done.\n\nI took a deep breath, my lungs burning from the effort as I felt myself growing weaker with each passing moment. The pain was starting to subside now, being replaced with a numbness that seemed to be spreading from my toes up.\n\nI felt my body relax, my muscles growing heavy and weak. My breathing slowed, my chest barely moving up and down as I let out one final sigh.\n\nAnd then I was still.\n\nI lay there for a long time, feeling myself being slowly pulled apart by the disease. It was a feeling that was both painful and relieving, a strange sense of calm that came with the knowledge that it was all over.\n\nI was gone. I'd finally passed on.\n\nI felt myself being pulled to the surface, my eyes flicking open as I gazed up at the world above. It was a bright, beautiful place, one that I'd spent my whole life waiting to see. And now I was here.\n\nI smiled to myself, feeling a sense of peace wash over me as I lay there in the darkness. It was over. It was all over."

Did she think that because we\u2019d saved her people, she was entitled to me?\n\n\"I could have asked you for any favor, and you chose this?\" She sounded wistful, like she was remembering a childhood memory that she wished she could relive.\n\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"Why not? I\u2019m no one special. I\u2019m not going to be the king. Maybe I\u2019ll serve in the guard. Maybe I\u2019ll go into service to a noble. If she\u2019s okay with it, I\u2019ll be her squire.\"\n\nI hadn\u2019t even realized I was thinking of her that way, but now that I had, I was almost relieved. She had a spark in her eyes, a spark that was growing brighter. \"I\u2019ll be happy with any choice you make.\"\n\n\"You have a lot of power,\" I said, trying to soften the blow. \"You\u2019re the queen. You\u2019ve got a whole army at your disposal. If you want something, you can make it happen.\"\n\n\"What do you want?\" Her voice cracked on that word. \"I\u2019ll give it to you.\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" I said. \"I don\u2019t want anything. I don\u2019t need anything.\"\n\n\"You\u2019re not thinking of yourself right now,\" she said, reaching out a hand and touching my cheek. \"You\u2019re thinking of yourself, but not of yourself. Do you understand?\"\n\nI shook my head, feeling a flush rise up my neck. \"I don\u2019t know what you mean.\"\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t matter,\" she said softly. \"If you want to give your answer to me now, I\u2019ll understand. I promise. If you don\u2019t want to give me an answer right now, then I\u2019ll understand that too.\"\n\nI swallowed, feeling the weight of her gaze on me, feeling the weight of her words. I looked into her eyes, and I saw something there, something that gave me pause.\n\n\"Why did you refuse me?\" she asked softly. \"Why did you refuse the favor I asked of you?\"\n\nI swallowed again, feeling a lump form in my throat. \"I don\u2019t want to hurt you,\" I said. \"I know you\u2019re the queen. I know you have a lot of power, and you could make me do anything you want me to do. And I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared that if I say yes, you\u2019ll take advantage of me.\"\n\nI felt tears prick at the corners of my eyes, and I looked away, fighting to keep them from falling.\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to take advantage of you,\" she said softly. \"I want to be with you. I want you to be with me.\"\n\nI looked back at her, and I saw tears streaming down her cheeks. \"I don\u2019t understand,\" I said. \"I thought you were just saying those things because you were the queen.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"I wasn\u2019t saying them because I\u2019m the queen. I was saying them because I\u2019m in love with you.\"\n\nI felt the ground drop out from under me, and I struggled to find my footing. \"What?\" I whispered.\n\n\"I\u2019m in love with you,\" she repeated. \"And I want you to be my king. I want you to be my everything.\""

        "pred_story": "As I opened the door, I noticed the woman was in her mid-twenties, at most, but her stature and aura suggested she was much older. Her raven hair fell down to the sides, framing her face. Her eyes shimmered like the night sky, full of stars that seemed to dance within. Her skin glowed with a gentle warmth that would suggest a sun kissed face. Her attire was simple yet elegant, a flowing white dress, with green vines crawling up the side. Her hands were delicate and her fingers were tipped with what appeared to be nails of crystal. The air around her shimmered slightly as she stood there.\n\n\u201cYou seem lost. Are you here to discuss the latest Goddess of the Gods novel? It\u2019s not every day that I receive a fan visit.\u201d\n\nShe chuckled, and her voice was as soothing as a gentle breeze. \u201cOh, yes, I am here to discuss the novel. You\u2019re the writer who created the world I inhabit. My name is Goddess.\u201d\n\nI felt a slight confusion as I tried to gather more information about this woman. \u201cGoddess of the Gods, my novel, and you\u2019re here to discuss it. You\u2019re a huge fan, I suppose?\u201d\n\nShe smiled, and her teeth were like those of a deer. \u201cYes, you could say that. I\u2019m more than just a fan. I\u2019m a part of your world.\u201d\n\nShe stepped forward, and I felt a strange sensation. Her eyes locked with mine, and I felt a sudden connection. I realized then that she wasn\u2019t just a fan. She was the goddess herself, summoned from the world she and I created. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name? I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t know your name sooner. I\u2019d have been glad to have you in a scene.\u201d\n\nShe laughed, a gentle and soft sound. \u201cMy name is Arianna, but I\u2019ve been known as Goddess by my followers. I\u2019m not certain if I\u2019m capable of being in a scene. I\u2019m still trying to understand the nature of this place.\u201d She paused, as she looked around, her eyes scanning the surroundings. \u201cI must admit that it\u2019s lovely here. So peaceful.\u201d\n\nShe sighed, a slight breath escaping her lips. \u201cIt was always my dream to have a place like this. A place where people can live without strife or pain. A place where love and joy are the only things that fill the air.\u201d\n\nI smiled as I saw the genuine smile on her face. It was clear that she was not here to mock my writing or my world, but to appreciate it and to find inspiration from it. \u201cI always wanted to create a world that is free from pain. I never knew how to make that possible, but it\u2019s clear that my creation helped to make that dream possible for you.\u201d\n\nShe laughed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that exactly. I created this world myself, using the powers I gained from the souls of my followers. This world is my home, but the humans in it are my children. I simply wanted to create a place where love and happiness are the only things that exist, and where I could protect and help my children live happy lives.\u201d\n\nIt was clear that her dream was more than just that of my character, Goddess. It was a dream shared by many others who saw the world I created as a form of utopia. I couldn\u2019t help but smile at the fact that my writing helped inspire her to create her own world.\n\nWe continued to talk for a few more hours, discussing the novel and the world. I couldn\u2019t help but feel a connection to her. She was a kind and compassionate person who genuinely cared about the people in her world. She was a true goddess, and I couldn\u2019t help but feel grateful to have known her. As the night came to a close, we said our goodbyes, and she vanished into the world of the gods. I knew that I had helped inspire her in more ways than I could imagine, and I couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of pride knowing that."

        "pred_story": "This is the hell on earth. \"Don't talk about the souls of the damned,\" I think was the first rule my manager told me when I got here. \"And yes,\" she said, \"this is my Hell.\" \n\nThe manager of the Postal Service Hell (PSSH for short) was a woman with a name I couldn't remember, with hair the color of an old book and a mouth the color of old ash. She had a voice like a dying clock and a smile like a dead mouse. \n\n\"Welcome aboard,\" she said, her voice barely above a squeak. \"You'll be working with me on sorting mail to the Pits of Despair.\"\n\nI was the new guy. I'd been out of work for months - one of those \"temporarily laid off\" people, but after three months, temp was starting to feel like permanent. I had a family, and they were suffering. And I was suffering, too. When my wife told me that she'd heard of someone who'd found a job delivering mail, I thought she was joking. Delivering mail? No problem. I could do that. In fact, I already had. I'd done it every day since I was eleven years old. I'd been doing it since before I could read, since I'd first learned to tie my shoelaces. \n\nThat was when I was a kid. This was the first time I'd ever heard of a place where you got paid to do it. I couldn't pass up a chance to support my family. \n\nThe manager's name was...well, I can't even remember now. That's not even the point. The point was, she was my boss, and she was telling me what to do. \n\n\"Listen,\" she said, \"I don't really care what your first name is. I don't care what your last name is. I don't care where you're from. What I care about is that you can handle objects with care. This is Hell, and the damned souls down there are very particular about how they get their packages. They're very particular about how they get their mail.\"\n\nShe was talking about the pits. I'd heard of the Pits of Despair before, but I didn't know it was where I'd be working. I'd been in the Pit myself just once - once I'd been late for work and couldn't remember the way out. It was hard to find, but once I got there, I'd learned the way out. So I knew that I wasn't going to end up there. Not again. \n\n\"Now, let's take a look at this.\" She held up a hand and pointed to a row of boxes. \"These boxes go to the Pits of Despair. The ones marked 'Pit One' go to the bottom of the Pit One, while the ones marked 'Pit Two' go to the bottom of Pit Two, and so on. You understand?\"\n\nI nodded, trying to remember. The Pits of Despair were like an elevator, but instead of going up or down, you had to go right or left. I had to get it just right to avoid falling to the bottom. If I did that, there was no way out. Not until some angel with a really good guidebook came to help me. \n\n\"This,\" she said, pointing to a box that was marked \"Pit Five\", \"this goes to the bottom of Pit Five. This one,\" she said, pointing to a box that was marked \"Pit One\", \"this goes to the top of Pit One. You see the difference between the two?\"\n\nI nodded. \"Yes,\" I said. \"It's 'one' and 'five'.\" \n\n\"You're not even paying attention,\" she said. \"Look.\" She pointed to a box that was marked \"Pit 1\", which was a little different from the box marked \"Pit One\". \"This box goes to Pit One. This one,\" she said, pointing to a box marked \"Pit Five\", \"this box goes to Pit Five.\" \n\n\"You can't put 'five' in '1'.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"That's right. And I expect you to catch that error when you sort. Do you understand?\"\n\nI nodded again. \"Yes.\" \n\n\"And what if someone sends a package to Pit Five, but the person's name is 'Jehovah'?\"\n\nI frowned. \"What do I do?\"\n\nShe sighed. \"Well,\" she said, \"you've got to sort that by name. If the box goes to Pit One, but the person's name is 'Jehovah', then it goes to Pit One. If the box goes to Pit Five, but the person's name is 'Jehovah', then it goes to Pit Five.\" \n\n\"But what if 'Jehovah' is on the inside of the box, and it's not showing?\"\n\nShe just looked at me. I shrugged. \"I don't know what to do.\"\n\n\"You should have asked,\" she said. \"But since you didn't ask, I'm going to tell you what to do. If 'Jehovah' is in the box, then it goes to Pit Five. It doesn't matter what the box says. Jehovah has to go to Pit Five.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a little better. \"I think I've got it.\"\n\nShe raised an eyebrow. \"Think?\" \n\nI shrugged. \"It's all a little confusing.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"That's all right. I'll be here to guide you. You just watch me and try to do what I do.\"\n\nAnd that was it. That was my job. I was supposed to watch her and do what she did. But I didn't really know what I was supposed to do. I wasn't even really sure what I was supposed to watch for. \n\nI watched her for a few minutes, but I was so confused that I didn't think I'd learn anything from her. I asked her a few questions, but the more I asked, the more confused I got. It was like she was speaking a language I'd never heard before, and it was hard to know what she was saying. \n\n\"Listen,\" she said finally, standing up and looking me up and down. \"I'm going to leave you here for a while. Try to learn how to do it. If you're still here when I get back, then you've got a job.\"\n\nI nodded. \"Yes,\" I said. \"I'll be here.\"\n\nShe smiled, a smile that was so sweet I could hardly bear it. I could hardly bear to look at it, but I couldn't help myself. \"Good,\" she said. \"I'll be back later. Just watch me and do what I do.\"\n\nAnd then she left. I looked around the room, trying to find something to do. But everything looked the same. I couldn't tell whether I was in a room or not, or even whether I was in Hell or not. It was all a little confusing.\n\nI tried to focus. But even that was hard. I was so tired, I thought I'd fall asleep on my feet. I thought I'd never make it home tonight. \n\nAnd yet, as soon as I sat down, I felt better."

Most of them aren't your kids, you don't know their parents, and their parents barely even bother showing up to the visits. \n\nThen there's 3. Three is your kid. It's easy to tell, it's the only one that's actually paying attention to you the whole time. Three can see you, and you can tell it knows you. Even if they can't talk yet, they can still pick up on all your emotions and get mad when things are unfair, even when you're the one doing the unfair thing.\n\nYou watch the clock until the day is done, you go home, you eat some food, you go back to your secret hideout. You've got a computer set up with all the usual things - cameras, microphones, security systems. A little 2 way radio for when Three's not with the day care, so you can check up on them.\n\n3 is your secret identity, it's why you got into villainy in the first place. There are a few other parents you know of, but none of them are even close to how much you feel about 3. It's a shame, there's a lot of them that could be good heroes, they just have bad parents. It's a shame, but it's how the world works.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and turn to see one of your henchmen with the file you asked for earlier. \"3's father is here, boss.\" It says. It drops the file on your desk and you pick it up, opening it.\n\n3's father, Dr. Weyland, has been on your target list for years. You've spent years trying to get him to come out of his tower, trying to get him to leave his tower and fight you. But you've been unable to get that far. But now it seems he has no choice but to leave.\n\nThe file has a few more details, but you're not really interested. You know him, he's just some old man. \"Let's do it!\" you say, the henchman nods and leaves. \"I'm coming for you, Dr. Weyland!\" You yell."

        "pred_story": "My roommate was not my friend, but she was my roommate. I didn\u2019t really know her all that well, but she always paid on time, never left trash around, and never made loud noises when I was in the room.\n\nThat being said, I was starting to get a little irritated that she was never home when I had visitors over, so I snuck into her room while she was out to see if I could find any clues.\n\n\u201cHuh, what are you up to, man? You\u2019re usually a lot more considerate than that.\u201d I turned around to see my roommate, but when the light hit her face, I saw that she was a monster. A monster I didn\u2019t recognize. \n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she said staring back, \u201cnot my best morning.\u201d She was tall and had two legs, with what looked like feathers for an arm. Two big eyes were staring at me, with a couple horns on her head and red skin. Her body was a little too long in proportion with her arms and legs, making her seem like a cartoon character.\u00a0\n\nI was terrified. My heart was beating fast. I had never seen something like her before. She was so out of place. She looked like something from a cartoon. I couldn\u2019t understand how she was here.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said while she was putting her hands in her pockets. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can\u2019t handle. You\u2019re not the first person who has seen me in my true form. You\u2019ll survive it.\u201d\n\n\u201cW-where am I? What is this place? How can you say something so casually about this?\u201d\n\nShe rolled her eyes. \u201cCome on. You don\u2019t know that you\u2019ve been living with a monster the whole time?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did this happen? Why are you still here?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m a very good monster.\u201d\n\nShe walked over to the window and turned off the curtains. \u201cHere, take a look. You have a rather unique location.\u201d\n\nI turned to look out the window. I didn\u2019t really see anything. A lot of houses, some grass, but it was hard to see what was special about it. But I knew that something was off. \n\n\u201cCan you describe it to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cOk. You live in a house. On the house is a tree. The tree is being occupied by a lot of birds. In the house, you have a living room with some furniture. I have a room with a bed and a bathroom. But the house itself is built right into the side of a hill.\u201d She walked over to me and smiled. \u201cWhat do you think? I thought it was pretty cool. And I liked the neighbors too. It was kind of a mixed neighborhood. Mostly birds, but a few other animals too. It made for a good conversation between us.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe it. It wasn\u2019t possible. \u201cThis is impossible. It\u2019s impossible. I know where I live. You\u2019re just messing with me. I know that I live in a suburb. I\u2019ve been here my whole life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not messing with you,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very serious. You\u2019re in a neighborhood. One that is a lot different than you thought it was.\u201d\n\nI was dumbfounded. I couldn\u2019t understand what she was saying. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d she said while she was holding my shoulders, \u201cit\u2019s ok. It\u2019s a little more than you can handle. But you\u2019ll be able to adjust in a few days. The neighbors will help you out.\u201d She pulled up the curtains and took a quick look outside. \u201cYes, she\u2019s almost here.\u201d She released my shoulders and went to get her backpack.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s she?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust my wife. She\u2019s a lot more monstrous than I am. But I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine. She\u2019ll be here in a few minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoa, whoa, stop. You can\u2019t make me do anything I don\u2019t want to do.\u201d I pushed her away. \u201cHow did I end up here? This is insane.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk, you can\u2019t handle it,\u201d she said while she was putting her backpack on. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave. But you have to know that you\u2019ve been living here with us for a very long time. You\u2019ve been getting very happy with your life. We\u2019re trying to help you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHappiness? I\u2019m terrified. I don\u2019t even know if I like my roommate that much. I don\u2019t know if I like this place.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour roommate? But you said that you didn\u2019t really know her. You didn\u2019t really like her.\u201d\n\n\u201cY-yes, I guess I did.\u201d \n\n\u201cSee, she\u2019s right. You would be very happy if you stayed. You would be very happy here.\u201d\n\nThe door opened and a bigger monster than my roommate walked in. Her head looked more monstrous than her roommates, with more horns, bigger teeth, and a much longer neck. Her body was like a snake, with two big eyes staring at me.\n\n\u201cHello there,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do you feel about the place so far?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little disoriented.\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cI see. You\u2019ll get used to it in a little while. But if you want to get out, you\u2019re welcome to do so. You won\u2019t be missing anything by getting out.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe it. I was being given a chance to leave.\n\n\u201cThank you, I\u2019ll be going then.\u201d I walked out the door and saw that it was in the suburbs. A house that I thought I knew. But it looked different. The yard was full of birds. Some were birds of prey. \n\nI turned around. \u201cWait, you didn\u2019t tell me that you lived in the suburbs. It was a lie. You were just messing with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d she said, \u201cif we wanted to mess with you, we would. You would be dead. You\u2019re a little too close to us for that. But I thought that you would be happier here. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ready to go back home. And like I said, you can always come back if you want.\u201d\n\nI turned around and ran. I ran as fast as I could, and I could feel the monsters watching me. I knew that I would never be able to go back. They would make sure of that. I stopped running after a few minutes, and looked at the monster\u2019s house in the distance. I could never go back."

        "pred_story": "\u201cWell, well, well. Looks like the governor finally arrived.\u201d\n\nI saw him standing next to his horse, a man in his late 40\u2019s dressed in a simple outfit that\u2019s probably older than he is. He\u2019s also holding a rifle in one hand and a knife in the other, probably for close range and a last resort respectively.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d I asked, trying to ignore the obvious intimidation tactic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the sheriff of this town, and a damn good one. The locals call me the best they got for this shithole of a place. I\u2019ve been watching your arrival, and I\u2019ll be honest with you. I\u2019m not impressed.\u201d\n\nThe horse looked around, probably not too pleased with our conversation. I gave it a pat, and it started to settle down. \u201cI\u2019m the governor of this colony, and this shithole has been prospering like never before. So tell me, Sheriff, what do you know about the prosperity of this town?\u201d\n\nThe sheriff looked at me like he just took a punch to the gut, and then he coughed. \u201cProsperity? What are you talking about? It\u2019s just a shit town with poor people. Everyone\u2019s poor except for a few corrupt officials, and you\u2019re just another one of them.\u201d He sighed and looked down at his horse. \u201cWhy do I feel like I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s telling the truth around here?\u201d\n\nI raised an eyebrow, and the sheriff looked up at me. \u201cHuh? Look at me. You\u2019ve got the power of the government in your hands, and all you\u2019re gonna do is serve your own interests and turn a blind eye to the truth? So yeah, I\u2019m gonna get real loud and real clear. What the hell are you gonna do about it? You gonna arrest me for speaking the truth?\u201d\n\nI shrugged, and the sheriff\u2019s expression softened. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what to say to that, Sheriff. I\u2019m pretty new to this job and stuff. I\u2019ve just been reading reports and stuff about how the town is doing.\u201d I looked around, and the town was still shithole central. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what happened to all this prosperity everyone\u2019s talking about.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff leaned on his horse, and I could feel him staring at me. \u201cWell, you see, that\u2019s the funny part. This prosperity isn\u2019t exactly real. This town has been thriving in poverty and crime and corrupt officials and all that for a while. It\u2019s been a shithole for as long as I remember, and that\u2019s what\u2019s keeping it alive.\u201d\n\nHe looked away, lost in thought. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for a new sheriff. Maybe someone with more, uh, creative problem solving. Not a lot of people around here trust the government. Some do, though. You might be the only person we need to save this town.\u201d He looked at me again, and I saw something in his eyes that made me wonder why he\u2019s been living around here for so long.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nThe sheriff shrugged. \u201cJust think about it, governor. We could clean up the town together. Get rid of the corrupt officials and the crime lords and all that. Help the people around here and maybe give them something better than just a simple life.\u201d\n\nI raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re proposing we start a revolution?\u201d\n\nThe sheriff sighed. \u201cYeah, I guess you could call it that. I\u2019m not a fan of bloodshed. Just a simple life where everyone has something to eat and a place to live and all that. That\u2019s all I want.\u201d He looked at me again. \u201cSo what do you say, governor?\u201d\n\nI smiled, and the sheriff smiled back. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to arrest me for speaking the truth, huh?\u201d\n\nI shook my head. \u201cNah, Sheriff. I think I want to hear more about your plan. What do you think about a revolution?\u201d\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s smile widened. \u201cWell, I\u2019m definitely not against the idea.\u201d"

        "pred_story": "I looked over at my fellow retirees. I was the only one still going. Sure, I had to work a day job to pay for my health insurance, but I was a hero. I couldn't be retired like them.\n\nAs I finished my meal, I stood up and let out a large, wet belch. \"Excuse you?\" My fellow veteran said, standing up to look at me. I simply nodded, then walked over to the bathroom to clean up the mess.\n\nIt was a little trick I learned when I was younger. My power was to generate intense heat from my body, but if I held it in, it could cause stomach issues. I had to be careful, or I'd spend more time in the bathroom than I did fighting villains.\n\nI turned on the faucet and washed my hands. I looked in the mirror, looking at my grey hair and tired eyes. I couldn't be seen like this. That was why I took on a new persona.\n\nI grabbed my backpack, and took out a wig and makeup. I applied it quickly, before putting on the old costume. It was a little worn down, but it still looked great. I grabbed my old suit, and put it on. It was a little tight, but it still fit well.\n\nBefore I left, I grabbed the newspaper off the coffee table. There was a news article about a serial arsonist. He was burning buildings down, targeting specific people. I couldn't believe it. My fellow veteran had become a villain.\n\nI had to go and stop him. I would have to be careful, as he knew me well. I looked around the area, getting a feel for it. It was quiet, except for a few stragglers. I waited until they left, then I ran out of the building and into the night.\n\nI followed the path of the burning buildings. It led me to a large building, with flames coming out of it. I could hear screams from inside. I couldn't let them die. I ran towards the building, and jumped up to grab the roof.\n\nI climbed up to the top, where I saw my fellow veteran. He was dressed in a suit, with flames dancing around him. He was laughing maniacally, as he threw more flammable liquids into the building.\n\nI charged at him, but he turned around and grabbed my arm. He had my arm in a tight grip, with his flames coming close to my face. \"Not so fast,\" he said, as he threw me off the roof.\n\nI fell through the air, grabbing onto a windowsill to stop myself. I looked up at the window, seeing my fellow veteran standing there. He was laughing at me, with flames coming from his hands. He threw more liquid into the building, causing the flames to go higher.\n\nI looked around, seeing what else I could use to get back up. I saw a dumpster, and rushed over to it. I jumped up and grabbed the dumpster, throwing it up at the window. It knocked my fellow veteran off balance, allowing me to jump up and grab him.\n\nWe struggled back and forth, with my fellow veteran throwing flames at me. I could feel the heat, but I was able to dodge it with ease. I punched at him, but he was able to grab my arm and toss me to the side. I landed on the roof, looking up at him.\n\nHe was laughing at me again, throwing more flames at me. I couldn't let him do this. I grabbed the roof, and pulled it up. He was caught off guard, and fell to the ground. I jumped up, and pulled out my old mace. I punched him to the ground, before I jumped down to check on the building.\n\nI saw smoke pouring out of it, but it was under control. I looked at my fellow veteran, who was getting up. I punched him again, before he fell back to the ground. I turned and ran, leaving him there.\n\nI was tired, but I knew I had to keep going. I had to keep stopping the villainous acts. I couldn't let anyone else die."

The usual reason,\u201d said Detective Galloway, staring through the window of his office and out at the rain. \u201cI can never wait.\u201d\n\nHe sighed and then looked at the desk he shared with another detective.\n\n\u201cMeredith, I\u2019m leaving. Go tell the chief I\u2019m going to be late. Or worse, I\u2019m not going to make it at all. He\u2019ll just tell you that you have to do it instead, but you know how I feel about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this \u2018usual reason\u2019 business, detective?\u201d Meredith said, raising one eyebrow.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just go, Meredith.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, detective,\u201d Meredith said, pushing herself out of her chair. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to tell the chief that you said no.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you will,\u201d said Galloway. \u201cAnd I know that he\u2019s going to send you down there instead of me. But I don\u2019t care. That\u2019s the price I have to pay.\u201d\n\nMeredith shrugged. \u201cWell, you should try saying no more often. But hey, at least you can\u2019t say that I ever told you to do something that you didn\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue enough,\u201d said Galloway. \u201cNow, I\u2019ve been in your shoes before, so don\u2019t think you can get away with this.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m going to get away with this,\u201d Meredith said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re not going to be the one to go down there today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should have known better than to think you\u2019d listen to me,\u201d Galloway said, standing up from his chair and walking out into the hall. He paused there for a moment, glancing around before walking off down the hall.\n\nMeredith smiled as she watched him leave. Then she walked into the chief\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cGood morning, chief,\u201d she said, standing in the door for a moment.\n\n\u201cMorning, Meredith. So, I hear that Galloway doesn\u2019t want to head down to the lab?\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t want? He\u2019s not going down there. He\u2019s going to be late, or he\u2019s not going to make it. Or worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that sounds serious,\u201d said the chief, raising one eyebrow.\n\n\u201cI know, I know. I\u2019m going to go down there instead. You know, because you need to keep doing your job and everything,\u201d said Meredith.\n\nThe chief smiled. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want you to go down there. You\u2019re too valuable to be spending your time in the lab.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I still want to go down there. Why don\u2019t I go ahead and go down there now, chief? I can call up and let you know what I find out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Meredith. You\u2019re still really busy with the other cases we\u2019ve been working on. And besides, what if they need me?\u201d\n\n\u201cThem?\u201d Meredith said, raising an eyebrow. \u201cThem? Who else is there to need you down there? A chronomancer that needs to be arrested? That\u2019s what we have Galloway for. Besides, he\u2019s been in your shoes before. Why don\u2019t we let him be the one to deal with it again this time?\u201d\n\nThe chief smiled and shook his head. \u201cNo, no. You can\u2019t talk me into that. I have to go down there. Besides, it\u2019s your job. Why don\u2019t you just go?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine. I\u2019ll go down there. But if anything happens to me, I\u2019m blaming Galloway,\u201d said Meredith.\n\n\u201cOh, stop it. I\u2019ll go down there. Now.\u201d\n\nThe chief walked past her and walked out the door of his office. Meredith followed him. They walked in silence until they got to the stairs. The chief stopped there and looked back over his shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you go for the lab before, Meredith. You usually just tell them that you have to be somewhere else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. I\u2019m not sure why I wanted to go down there today. Maybe I just wanted some time for myself. But maybe it\u2019s because I heard that there\u2019s something going on in the lab. Something interesting.\u201d\n\nThe chief raised one eyebrow. \u201cSomething interesting?\u201d\n\nMeredith grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out. But maybe you know more than I do. Maybe you know why I wanted to go down there.\u201d\n\nThe chief smiled and shook his head. \u201cNo, Meredith. I don\u2019t know why you wanted to go down there. But I don\u2019t care. If you want to go down there, then I\u2019m happy to let you. Besides, I have to go home early today. You can go to the lab now.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine. I\u2019m going down there. But like I said, if anything happens to me, I\u2019m blaming Galloway. You can\u2019t tell me that you haven\u2019t met him before. He\u2019s never listened to me when I\u2019ve asked him to do something. And you know what? I always end up going down there anyway.\u201d\n\nThe chief chuckled. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure that it\u2019ll all work out in the end. So, what do you do down there?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I do down there?\u201d Meredith said. \u201cI get to find out whether the chief is still alive.\u201d\n\nThe chief chuckled. \u201cWell, let\u2019s hope that he is,\u201d he said, walking away. He turned around briefly and smiled. \u201cOh, and Meredith? Give my love to Galloway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill do, chief,\u201d Meredith said, shaking her head as she watched him leave. Then she walked down the stairs and into the lab.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Meredith?\u201d a technician asked as she walked through the door.\n\n\u201cThe chief is coming down here. What do you know about that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d the technician said, \u201cBut I think I\u2019ll go warn the chief. Just in case you\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\nMeredith smiled, feeling a surge of satisfaction run through her. \u201cYou\u2019re right to be cautious,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t stop me from doing my job.\u201d\n\nThe technician smiled back, but quickly looked down at her feet when she saw the look on Meredith\u2019s face. \u201cWhat? I mean, I wasn\u2019t going to stop you. I was just going to make sure that you knew what was going on.\u201d\n\nMeredith sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Sorry, I guess I just wanted to see you squirm for a second. But I\u2019ll give you credit. You didn\u2019t squirm that much.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, so you\u2019re going to go check out the lab, right?\u201d\n\nMeredith grinned, raising one eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019m going to go check out the lab. Now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d said the technician, turning around and walking back into the lab. Meredith turned and walked away in the opposite direction, the lab quickly disappearing from her view.\n\n\u201cAh, Meredith. You\u2019re so late,\u201d Galloway said, standing in the lab and staring at the wall in front of him. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m going to have the chief\u2019s head on a platter for not sending you down"

I don't think that it's a habit for birds to eat their own food.\n\n\"I see.\" I nod. \"Well, your corn is still edible. You can eat it. I'm glad that I could learn from you today.\"\n\nMy little one nods at my words, seeming to be happy to have taught me something. They look up at me, and then they look down. \"I want to be like you, father. I want to be able to grow like you.\"\n\nI see what they want to do. I want to tell them that they will grow into a powerful dragon one day, but that they can't grow as I have grown.\n\n\"Children don't grow into powerful dragons like this. You need to spend some time practicing and gaining experience in order to become a powerful dragon like me.\"\n\nMy little one nods at my words. They seem to understand, and I see them nodding slowly. \"Okay, father. I'll practice.\"\n\nI smile at my little one, happy to have been able to teach them something. \"Good. Good, little one.

        "pred_story": "I could feel the heat emanating from the walls of the castle and it was making me feel quite uneasy, but the King said I would be safe within the castle walls. It was a strange place to take shelter, but I had no other place to go.\n\nThe castle was old, the stones worn and weathered, the walls crumbling in some places and missing in others. I wondered how it was still standing, but the King didn't seem to care. He had said that it was safer than being in the forest, where the giants roamed, and that it was the only place where we could be safe from the monsters. The only thing that had given me pause was the door to the tower. The King had said that it was locked and that I would be safe there, but I had seen the door open, and the way the King had looked at me made me wonder if it wasn't locked at all.\n\nBut it didn't matter, the fire was what was important. The fire that had brought us through the journey, and the fire that I could feel burning inside me. I had always wondered why the King had made the fire, why he had made it so strong, and why it seemed to be drawing me closer to it. He said that it was the only way that we could survive, but I knew that it was more than that.\n\nAs I stood in front of the hearth, I couldn't help but feel a strange pull towards the flames, as if they were calling to me. The King had said that it would be safe to go closer to the fire, but I didn't dare, I knew that I shouldn't trust him.\n\nThe warmth was soothing, the flames dancing in the firelight, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. I could feel it, the tension in the air, the way that the fire seemed to be humming, and the way that the shadows seemed to be moving.\n\n\"Come closer,\" the King called, his voice low and enticing, \"the fire won't hurt you.\"\n\nI hesitated, my heart pounding in my chest, but I knew that I had to go closer, I had to see what the King had been hiding. So I took a step forward, the fire crackling and popping as the flames danced.\n\n\"What is it, child?\" the King asked, his voice tinged with amusement, \"are you afraid of the fire?\"\n\nI shook my head, trying to seem brave, but the King just laughed, a deep, throaty sound that made me feel like I was trapped.\n\n\"No, it's not the fire that you're afraid of,\" he said, his eyes glinting in the light, \"it's what's burning inside you.\"\n\nI didn't know what he meant, but as I looked deeper into the flames, I saw something move, something that seemed to be alive. The King laughed again, and I knew that he knew what it was, and that he was hiding it from me.\n\n\"Come closer,\" he said, his voice low and urgent, \"and you will see.\"\n\nI took another step forward, the flames dancing and licking the air, but I knew that I was taking a risk. I was playing with fire, and I could get burned.\n\n\"What are you hiding?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady, but the King just laughed again, his eyes glinting with amusement.\n\n\"You'll see, child,\" he said, \"you'll see.\"\n\nI took another step forward, the flames dancing and popping, and as I did, I felt something move inside me. It was small at first, but it grew and grew, until I could feel it burning inside me, a fire that seemed to be feeding on the flames.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady, but the King just laughed again, his eyes glinting with amusement.\n\n\"It's the spark of the gods,\" he said, \"and it's burning inside you.\"\n\nI didn't know what to say, I didn't know what it meant, but the King just laughed again, his eyes glinting with excitement.\n\n\"You are the first god, child,\" he said, \"and you are the only one.\"\n\nThe fire cracked and popped, the flames dancing and licking the air, and as I looked into the flames, I saw the King transform into something else. He grew taller, stronger, more powerful, and as he did, he spoke again.\n\n\"I am the first god,\" he said, his voice booming and powerful, \"and I am the only one.\"\n\nAnd with that, the castle disappeared, the walls crumbling and falling apart as the King was gone. The only thing that remained was the fire, and the spark that burned inside me.\n\nI knew that I had been given a great gift, a gift that would make me powerful and strong. And I knew that I would use it to create a new world, a world where I would be the only god.\n\nThe fire crackled and popped, the flames dancing and licking the air, and as I stood in the ashes of the castle, I knew that I was ready.\n\nI was the first god, and I was the only one."

        "pred_story": "I couldn't quite believe I was saying this as I said it, but I said it nonetheless: \"A great blade must be forged in the fiery depths of the underworld itself, with molten lava and fiery hells spawn.  To forge a good blade, a good weapon, one must be able to think like the blade itself.\"\n\nLava flowed, the red hot liquid splashing against the crucible.  I took out my work and began to sharpen the edge of the blade.  \"A fine weapon begins with fine metal, and that metal is forged in the fiery hells of the underworld.  But it is not the metal that creates a fine weapon, it is the one that forges it.\"\n\nThe sword started to speak, its voice that of a man in his fifties, a voice that commanded respect.  The sword spoke in a deep, resonating tone.  \"Sir, I know what you are saying, that the fine metal is important.  But a fine weapon is not just one created of fine metal, but one that also has fine intentions, that is created by a fine soul.\"\n\n\"A great blade,\" I repeated, the blade's edges forming, \"must be forged in the fiery depths of the underworld.  It is only there that a fine weapon can be created, one that will be worthy of the great warriors and fighters that wield it.\"\n\nMy apprentice looked up from his work, eyes wide with horror.  He had seen the sword, the one I had been working on.  He had seen the eyes, the glow within.  He had seen the way it moved, how the air seemed to ripple as it spoke.  \"Sir?\" the young man began, his voice cracking, but I would not be swayed.\n\n\"It is only in the fiery depths of the underworld,\" I repeated, my hands moving with practiced ease as the blade began to take form, \"that a fine weapon may be forged, one that will be worthy of the great warriors that wield it.\"\n\nThe blade spoke again, the deep tones of the man in his fifties.  \"Sir, you know that is not true.  A fine weapon is not forged in the underworld, it is forged by the soul of the one that wields it.\"\n\nI paused, a thought occurring to me.  I would not have a fine weapon forged without a fine soul to wield it, would I?  \"A fine weapon,\" I said, my voice dripping with sarcasm, \"is forged by the soul of the one that wields it.  That is true, apprentice.  A fine weapon is forged not by the fiery depths of the underworld, but by the soul of the one who weaves it.\"\n\nThe young man looked at me, confused.  \"Sir?\" he asked, \"How?\"\n\nI laughed, the sound of laughter echoing through the workshop.  I smiled as I turned the blade over, the glow within it growing as I did so.  \"That is the best part of it, my young apprentice.  The soul is forged into the weapon, not the weapon forged from the soul.  That is the difference between a fine weapon, and a fine warrior.\"\n\nThe young man looked at the sword, the blade now a fine, shining edge.  The metal was tempered, the edge sharp and deadly.  \"Sir,\" he asked, \"I have a question.\"\n\n\"Ask your question, apprentice,\" I said, turning the blade over.  \"Ask your question.\"\n\n\"Does the soul matter?\" he asked, his eyes locked on mine.  \"Does it matter that the weapon is forged with the soul of the one who wields it?\"\n\nI laughed again, the sound of laughter echoing through the workshop.  \"No,\" I said, my voice dripping with sarcasm.  \"No, it does not matter.  Not in the least.\"\n\nI took out my work and began to sharpen the edge of the blade.  \"All that matters is that the weapon is fine.  All that matters is that the weapon is forged with the fine metal, and the fine intentions of the warrior.\"\n\nThe young man looked at the sword, the blade now a fine, shining edge.  The metal was tempered, the edge sharp and deadly.  \"Sir,\" he asked, \"I have another question.\"\n\n\"Ask your question, apprentice,\" I said, turning the blade over.  \"Ask your question.\""

The sword was in his hand and he could feel the magic of the metal coursing through him. He watched his wife lean over the bath, her eyes fixed on him. He felt a surge of love for her, for her beauty, for her kind eyes and her bright smile. \u201cI\u2019ll never tire of crafting swords,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not tired of me either?\u201d she asked, her brow furrowing in mock annoyance.\n\nHe laughed. \u201cYou know I love you.\u201d She turned back to the bath, looking for imperfections. \u201cAnd you\u2019re as good as I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cDifferent skills,\u201d she said, \u201cbut both valuable.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d he said. He dipped the blade into the bath and watched the metal ripple and shift, forming a pattern. He sighed in awe. \u201cYou are the best, but I\u2019ll never get tired of making swords.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m not the only one,\u201d she said, \u201cand I hope you don\u2019t ever get tired of me.\u201d\n\nHe smiled at her and leaned over the bath, kissing her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll never get tired of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she said, looking into his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re my favorite person, my first love.\u201d\n\n\u201cMine too,\u201d he said.\n\nHe returned to the blade and watched it change shape, forming an interesting pattern. \u201cWhat do you think this one is?\u201d he asked, raising it up.\n\n\u201cIt looks like a dragon,\u201d she said, \u201cI think it\u2019s for a noble.\u201d\n\n\u201cA dragon,\u201d he said, \u201cthe noble will be impressed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course he will,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re the best swordsmith around.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, holding up the blade to admire it. He turned it in the light, watching it ripple and shift. \u201cI\u2019ll never get tired of this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d she said.\n\nHe looked at her and smiled. \u201cNever,\u201d he repeated.\n\nShe smiled and leaned over the bath, kissing him. \u201cNever,\u201d she said.\n\nThe two of them remained still for a moment, then she returned to the bath and he returned to his work. He watched the metal ripple and shift, forming patterns. He saw a dragon, an eagle, a phoenix. Each one was unique and beautiful, full of patterns and shapes. He dipped the blade into the bath and watched it change, the metal rippling and shifting.\n\n\u201cHow do you do that?\u201d she asked, standing up. She walked around the workbench, admiring the different patterns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s magic,\u201d he said, \u201cthe magic of the metal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d she said, \u201cI want to learn how to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one else knows how,\u201d he said, \u201cand I don\u2019t know how I do it either.\u201d\n\nShe raised an eyebrow and looked at him, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d she said, \u201cand I bet you do know how.\u201d\n\nHe shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI try and the metal responds.\u201d\n\nShe sighed and sat down in a chair, crossing her legs. \u201cYou\u2019re just teasing me now,\u201d she said, \u201cand you\u2019re going to make me work harder for it.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I won\u2019t ever teach you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019ll just have to practice.\u201d\n\nHe laughed and returned to his work, watching the blade change shape. He saw a dragon, an eagle, a phoenix. He dipped the blade into the bath and watched it ripple and shift. He sighed in awe, then he looked up at his wife. She was watching him, her eyes filled with warmth and love. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d she said.\n\nHe watched her smile and felt his heart fill with emotion. He knew that he loved her more than anything in the world, and he knew that she loved him too."

If you enter the sacred woods where the Unseelie dwell, they will not harm you, and they will even allow you to pass if you are a fool with honor. If your sword is un-bored with blood, then you are not a worthy opponent. \n\nThe Seelie are different, they would be the best of us if they were not so... human. They will not kill you if you are a fool, but they will not allow you to pass either. They are so caught up in their own morality that you are forced to play by their rules. They are our closest cousins, but we are not the same. I know this for certain, as I have seen the Unseelie and Seelie side by side.\n\n\"Did you know that the Fae were born of this land and its people?\" My friend asked as we sat on a hill overlooking the forest of the Unseelie.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"You heard me, they are a part of us, a part of the earth.\" \n\n\"Did you not know? They are the reason the earth has so many strange and fantastical plants and animals. They were born of this land, of the earth. They took the seed of the gods and grew from it. The earth gave them their power, and they give the earth life in return. I am certain of it.\"\n\n\"I did not know. I have never heard of such a thing.\"\n\n\"I know.\" \n\n\"What has that got to do with my son?\" \n\n\"You killed my son.\" I shouted in the voice of the Unseelie.\n\n\"I did not, I swear it on my honor. If you will let me, I will tell you the truth. You may kill me now and I will not be upset.\"\n\nThe Fae before me were silent, I could feel the earth beneath their feet humming. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"The Unseelie do not kill men unless provoked. If you are a fool and you enter the sacred woods of the Unseelie, then they will not harm you, and they will even allow you to pass if you are a fool with honor. If your sword is un-bored with blood, then you are not a worthy opponent. The Unseelie are not our enemy. But I see your people are our enemy. They have been killing our people for generations. They cut down the trees that give us power, they slaughter the animals that give us life, and they burn the flowers that give us joy. You may tell me to stop speaking, but the Seelie are our cousins, and you are their enemy. I have seen the Seelie and Unseelie side by side, and I can tell you that they are not so different. I have no malice towards you or your kind, but I must protect my home.\"\n\n\"My son was a fool with honor.\"\n\n\"I know, I can see that.\" \n\n\"Why did you not let him pass?\"\n\n\"I did not know that he was a fool with honor. You must tell me more of your son. What was his name? What was his quest?\" \n\n\"My son was Einar. He did not have a quest, he simply wished to see the Fae. He was the only person left in my family, and I wished to keep him safe. I did not wish to see him die.\"\n\nI could see the Fae before me trembling. \"How did your son come across the woods of the Unseelie?\"\n\n\"He was wandering the forest, looking for herbs and flowers. He had heard of their healing properties, and he wished to find them for his sick wife.\"\n\nThe Fae were silent again, and I could hear the earth humming once more. \"I will kill you now, but I will give you a choice. I may let your son pass through the woods if he wishes. But I must warn you, the Seelie are our cousins, and they are your enemy. They will not let your son pass.\"\n\n\"Please, I beg of you. Let my son pass. I am an old man, and I am ready to die.\"\n\n\"No, you may live on, but your son must pass. You must tell your son of the agreement that I made with you. You must tell him that he may pass through the woods of the Unseelie, but not the woods of the Seelie. He must know the risks of passing through the Seelie, but he must know that the Unseelie do not seek to harm men unless provoked.\"\n\nI could see the Fae before me nodding. \"I will tell my son. I will tell him of the agreement that we have made.\"\n\n\"You must tell him of the Seelie too, and you must tell him to be cautious when dealing with them. You may die, but your son must live on. I will not kill you now, as you have proven your worth. You have proven that you have honor.\"\n\nI bowed to the Fae before me, and they bowed to me. We were two men of honor and dignity, and we could understand one another. I may die soon, but my son will live on. He may come across the woods of the Unseelie, but he will not die. I am a man of honor, and I will keep my word. My son will pass through the woods of the Unseelie, and he will live on."

He had stopped at a man in an orange and yellow uniform, leaning over the edge of a platform, looking at the man as he stepped into the cart with his cart's basket.\n\n\"Stop your cart and come here, please. You are not licensed to carry goods on this station, sir.\"\n\nThe man stopped and looked down at the man with a glare, \"I don't believe I need to be licensed to carry a few bags of garbage. Besides, this station has no right to charge taxes on my trash.\"\n\nThe man scoffed, \"Oh yeah? Well, you should have read the fine print when you signed up for this station, sir. You will be paying oxygen tax.\"\n\n\"You mean this station has a tax on oxygen?\"\n\nThe man in the uniform nodded, \"Yes, we have a tax on oxygen. And you will be paying it. You could pay at the station's entrance, or in the shops. This is your chance to pay your oxygen tax.\"\n\nThe man scoffed, \"No, I do not intend to pay that tax. I don't think it is right to charge someone for taking in oxygen.\"\n\nThe man in the uniform sighed, \"Well, this is a new station, and we have yet to see who wants to pay the tax. Let me tell you, you are not going to be able to use this station for long without paying it.\"\n\nThe man scoffed again, \"I don't think it is right to charge me for taking in oxygen.

It is a good thing that you are leaving this place.\"\n\nThe man scoffed again, \"Well, I don't think it is right to charge me for taking in oxygen, sir. I am not going to pay it, and I don't think I will stay here for long, if I have a choice.\"\n\nThe man in the uniform sighed again, \"Sir, I advise you to pay your oxygen tax now, and you will be allowed to stay here for a short while longer.

        "pred_story": "Sitting at the front of the throne room, I cross my legs. My eyes move over the crowd, a few servants and guards. The only one that matters sits a few rows behind them, the servant with the note. He was a good kid, that one. Only twenty years old and already had some great ideas for a fantasy story. I had taken pity on him, and written him a note on how to get a summoning. Then, I had just watched the whole ritual. The priest had asked him questions, and he had answered all of them. It had been easy. Now, here we were.\n\nHe spoke, his voice steady as he addressed the King. \"You cannot just take someone and force them to do your bidding. That is slavery. Your servants, guards, and soldiers? They are all enslaved, forced to serve you against their will.\"\n\nThe King looked to the crowd. I could see anger in his eyes, but he forced himself to calm it down. \"What would you have me do?\" He asked the boy, his voice strong.\n\nThe boy spoke again. \"Do what is right, you say you are a just king, so you must be a just king. Give them free will and let them choose if they will serve you or not.\" The boy paused, looking around at the crowd, and speaking to them. \"And you must treat those that work for you with kindness. You must be fair. That is what being a true king is all about, not just about forcing people to do your bidding.\"\n\nI could feel the crowd becoming restless. The King's anger flared, and he pointed at the boy. \"You say that I should be fair? Fairness is not what a king is about, boy. The king is the strongest, and that means that they must rule. Being fair would only lead to more rebellion and strife. I will not be told how to rule my kingdom by a boy, nor will I be told that my servants are slaves.\"\n\nThe King's anger had become too much. He stood from his throne, shouting at the crowd. \"You are all slaves, do you hear me? You are my property, my to do with as I see fit.\" He walked down off the dais, and pointed at the boy. \"Do you really think that you are better than me? Do you really think that you can tell me how to run my kingdom?\"\n\nI could feel my face heating, and I stood. The boy looked at me, and I could see the fear in his eyes. The King shouted at me. \"You! Speak up boy! What do you have to say about this?\"\n\nI could feel myself trembling, but I forced myself to speak. \"I, I, I do not think that you have the right to rule this kingdom. I do not think that you have the right to use them as slaves.\" My voice was shaking, but I kept going, and raised my voice. \"I do not think that you have the right to be cruel to them. That is not what a true king does.\"\n\nThe King screamed at me, his face red with anger. \"You dare to defy me? You are nothing but a peasant, and yet you dare to tell me how to run my kingdom?\" He spun around, pointing at the crowd. \"You all heard him, you all saw the defiance in his eyes, do you stand with this peasant?\"\n\nI looked around, and saw the fear in the eyes of the crowd. They were all thinking about the consequences of standing against their King. The King raised his voice again, shouting at the crowd. \"Answer me, do you stand with this peasant?\"\n\nThe crowd was silent. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. They all stared at me, and I could feel their eyes on me. I could feel the fear in their eyes. But then, one of them spoke. \"Yes, we stand with him.\"\n\nAnother one spoke. \"Me too.\"\n\nAnother one. \"I am not afraid of you, King.\"\n\nI looked around at the crowd, and I saw a mix of emotions. Some of them looked at me with hate, but others looked at me with hope. I looked at the King, and saw the anger in his eyes.\n\nHe shouted again. \"Guards, take them into custody. We must show them how wrong they are. We must show them the consequences of defiance.\"\n\nThe guards moved forward, grabbing those that spoke up. But I could see something in their eyes. Something that made me realize that they were not afraid of me, or my actions. They were scared of the consequences, but they were also scared of not speaking up. They were scared of living with the knowledge of the King's cruelty and cruelty towards his people. I could see that look in their eyes, and I could feel it myself.\n\nAnd I realized that I was not the one who needed to be afraid. I was not the one that needed to be scared. The King was the one that should be afraid, of the people rising up against him. I could see the fear in his eyes, the fear that I had seen before in people that were about to lose control.\n\nI looked at the boy, and I could see the fear in his eyes. I smiled at him, and he smiled back. I could feel his fear dissipate, replaced by a sense of hope.\n\nThe guards reached the boy, and he stood against them. \"I am not afraid of you. I am not afraid of the King, and I am not afraid of his cruelty. I will stand up for what is right.\"\n\nThe guards looked at the King, and then looked back at the boy. One of them stepped forward, and then another. The crowd cheered, and soon, more and more were stepping forward.\n\nThe King was surrounded by his guards, who were now standing with the people. He looked around, and saw that his kingdom was against him. He was no longer the strongest, and he was no longer the king. The people were the strongest, and they were the ones who would decide his fate.\n\nAnd as the guards took the King into custody, I realized that I had made a mistake. This boy was not just a storyteller, he was a hero."

        "pred_story": "\"Is this the best you can do?\" Kael bellowed, as the mage stood in the middle of the training room. The mage, barely out of his teenage years, was trembling and struggling to hold his wand aloft, but the magic was barely keeping him on his feet.\n\nThe mage, whose name was Jax, was trying to cast a spell to bring him down from his fall, but the magic was failing him. The spell was intended to be a simple levitation spell, used to help students get back to their feet, but Jax couldn't hold it. The other students were trying to get him down, but the room was enchanted, and no one could move until Kael lifted the spell.\n\n\"Again!\" Kael demanded. The student shook his head and tried again, but with the same result. Kael sighed, and walked over to the student. \"Come on, Jax, it's okay. I know you can do this. Everyone else has gotten it.\"\n\nJax looked up at his mentor, and then looked down at his feet. \"I can't, sir. I just can't. I've been trying for weeks. I just...I don't know if I can do it.\"\n\nKael looked at the boy, and felt a pang of regret. He had taught Jax this spell himself, and he knew how hard the boy had been trying. \"Jax, I know you've been trying, but this is the last day of class. If you can't learn this spell by now, I'm afraid you won't be able to learn the rest of the semester.\"\n\nJax looked up at Kael, and then looked at the other students, who were all staring at the pair. \"What? Why? I know the spells. I can read the books. I can cast the spells. I've been practicing. I've been trying. But something happens when I try to cast the spell in class. It always fails. I'm just...I'm afraid I won't be able to do it.\"\n\nKael nodded, and walked over to his desk. He retrieved a parchment from his desk drawer, and handed it to Jax. \"Sign this. If you don't get this spell down, I'm afraid you're being dismissed from class.\"\n\nJax looked at the parchment, and then looked up at Kael. \"You're kicking me out? But...but I need this class. It's the only one I have this semester. I'm not even going to be able to graduate if I get kicked out of this class.\"\n\nKael frowned, and looked at the parchment. \"You've been doing poorly, but I'm afraid you're going to need to focus more if you want to pass this class. I've never had a student fail a semester, and I don't want to start now. Just...just try to focus. You can do it, I know you can.\"\n\nJax nodded, and signed the parchment. Kael smiled, and patted the boy on the back. \"I'm proud of you, Jax. I know you'll do great. You're one of my most talented students.\"\n\nJax smiled, and smiled back at his mentor. \"Thanks, sir. Thanks for always believing in me.\"\n\nKael nodded, and turned back to the class. \"Alright, everyone. I know it's been a long day. Let's get you all cleaned up and out of here. You can all start your second semester next week. I'm sure you'll all do great.\"\n\nJax walked over to his bag, and packed it up. He turned to Kael, and smiled. \"Thanks, sir. I'll make sure to get those spells down. I'll be the best mage the world has ever seen. I promise.\"\n\nKael nodded, and walked over to the student. \"I'm proud of you, Jax. I know you'll do great. Just...just be careful, and always listen to your body. And don't forget to come back and visit me when you're out on your own.\"\n\nJax nodded, and hugged Kael. \"I will, sir. I promise. I'll be back.\"\n\nKael hugged the boy back, and smiled. \"You're always welcome here. I'm glad I could help you. You're a talented mage.\"\n\nJax smiled, and patted Kael on the back. \"You're always welcome here too. You're a great mentor. I'll miss you.\"\n\nKael smiled, and nodded. \"I'll miss you too. Just...just stay in touch, and come back and visit whenever you can.\"\n\nThe class was dismissed, and the students all left the training room. Kael was left alone, looking at the parchment in his hand. He sighed, and looked over at the boy who had just left. He had been one of his best students, and now he was gone.\n\nKael looked at the parchment again, and frowned. \"I think I just made a mistake,\" he said, and crumpled up the parchment.\n\n---\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir. I really am. But I was only trying to help.\"\n\nKael looked at the student, and frowned. He had seen this student before, and this looked like something he had done before. \"You're the student who's been showing up to my training classes all year, right? The student who was dismissed last semester?\"\n\nThe student nodded. \"I'm sorry, sir. I really am. But I was trying to help Jax. He's a friend of mine, and I couldn't stand to see him struggle like he was.\"\n\nKael sighed, and rubbed his face. He knew the student, and he knew exactly what he was capable of. \"You're a mage, aren't you?\" he asked. \"A black mage?\"\n\nThe student nodded. \"I'm sorry, sir. I really am. But Jax was struggling, and I was trying to help him. I only used my powers on him when he was struggling. I promise, sir. I promise.\"\n\nKael looked at the student, and frowned. \"You know that Jax was mentally unstable. He was struggling with this spell for weeks, and was on the verge of a complete breakdown. And you were trying to help him?\"\n\nThe student nodded. \"I know that, sir. But he was my friend, and I couldn't stand to see him fail. I only used my powers when he was struggling. I promise, sir. I promise.\"\n\nKael sighed, and rubbed his face. \"I don't know what to say. I know that Jax was struggling, but that's no excuse for you to use your powers on him. Especially if you only used them when he was on the verge of a complete breakdown. What you did was cruel, and I have to expel you from class.\"\n\nThe student looked at Kael, and frowned. \"But...but I was trying to help Jax. I promise.\"\n\nKael looked at the student, and frowned. \"Trying to help Jax? By making him feel worse? You were using your powers to make him feel better, and then you took them away? That's cruel.

So I became a mage, because I thought it would be more fun, and it was.\n\nBut that was back when I was young and stupid and didn't know any better. Now I know better. Now I know how much I'm making, because the other mages don't know how to make money, and I have a lot of money. I've got enough money to buy this whole town. I can buy all the land. I can buy everyone's house. And I'm going to, because I'm bored, and it's fun to watch the mages fight with each other when they think they own the place.\n\nI mean, I know they don't own the place. They don't own anything. I own it, because I'm rich, and I've got all the land. I've got all the gold. I've got everything. But they think they do, because they don't know any better. They think they're the best mages around, because they're rich, and they're stupid.\n\nThat's how they are, and that's how I am. I'm not a rich mage. I'm just a stupid mage, and that's okay. That's better than being a rich mage. Rich mages are boring. They're always so busy and worried and stressed. They never have any fun, because they're always thinking about money, and how they can get more of it.\n\nStupid mages are better. They're like me, and I like that. I like being boring and worried and stressed, because I know that's the only way to be the best. I know that I'm the only good mage around, and that's fine with me. I'm happy to be the only good mage around, and I'm happy to have all the money.\n\nI mean, I'm happy to have most of the money. I'm happy to have enough of the money to live for the rest of my life. That's all I need. I don't need to have more money. I don't need to have any more gold or gems or anything else. I've got enough to live for the rest of my life, and that's all that matters.\n\nI'm not worried about anything else. I'm not worried about anything, because I'm not smart enough to think about anything. I'm too stupid, so I'm happy. I'm happy because I'm not smart. I'm happy because I'm not good. I'm happy because I'm just a stupid mage, and I don't have to worry about anything.\n\nI've got enough money to buy a house with a view of the surrounding landscape, which is why I bought this tower. I'm happy to live in a tower, because it's all mine. I can do whatever I want, and I can get whatever I want, and I'm happy.\n\nI'm the happiest mage around. I'm the only mage that matters, because I'm the only mage who cares. I don't care about magic or gold or gems. I don't care about anything. I just care about being happy, and that's all that matters.\n\nI'm the happiest mage around. I'm the only mage that matters. And I don't care about anything else."

I knew they could see me and I was trying to stay quiet.\n\n\"Huh? Do I know you? I don't recall... Oh wait, you're the hero, right?\" They slowly turned around and gave me a smile. I didn't really know how to react and I was still in my dark suit. I had been sneaking up on them for a while and was about to attack but was halted when I saw that they had a smile on their face. It was rare for me to meet someone with a smile on their face and I didn't know how to react. \n\n\"Why are you smiling? Do you want to die?\" I asked as I drew my gun out.

And the power to love them. But when someone kills me, they would be breaking the contract and it would allow me to be reborn and everyone would love me even more. They would be killed instantly. So you can't kill me, Hero.\"\n\nThey were smiling again as they opened their eyes. I was shocked at what they had said and I didn't know what to say.\n\n\"But then why are you smiling?\" I asked but they just smiled again.\n\n\"I'm smiling because I'm the only hero that there is.\" They said as they raised their hand up and pointed at me. I felt myself starting to get dizzy and fell onto the floor."

        "pred_story": "Leroy was not really sure he was doing the right thing when he did what he did. A guy has to eat after all, and like so many before him, Leroy turned to the devil.\n\nHe took a moment to rub his temples in a gesture of frustration. He did not want to think of himself as a 'bad' person, but more of a person who would do bad things when desperate. That made him feel a little better, as if his actions were more of a necessary evil, a moral justification that he could hang his hat on.\n\nThe deal was simple. In exchange for a pair of shoes, a pair for every year he was alive, he would be granted a single wish. Any wish he desired, he could have it done. And not only that, but he would also gain the health of someone half his age. If you consider 50 to be half his age, then sure, that is what he would be. But he was already that, and he did not want to think of it as some sort of 'cheat', or 'exploitation'. No, he just wanted to be healthy, as he was told he would be.\n\nBut the devil was in the details, or so the old saying went. And in the case of Leroy, that was a very literal thing. The contract was written in a language he could not read, but he could read the words printed above it in English. And above the words \"You will be granted one wish, any wish you desire\", was the word'soul', written as'sole'.\n\nIt seemed so trivial, but he knew that the devil must have meant for it to be that way. And the fact that he even noticed it, that he even cared enough to notice it, was a testament to just how much he wanted the contract. He wanted the health of someone half his age, he wanted the money he would need to live comfortably. And he wanted it now, not later. He wanted it in the present, not some future promise.\n\nSo he did what he thought was right. He turned to the devil, with the two contracts in hand, one for himself, and the other for the devil. And when he presented them to the devil, he did not argue or debate the terms. He did not try to negotiate or make a counteroffer. All he did was smile, hand over the contract with the devil's signature, and walk away.\n\nThe only thing he could hear from the devil was laughter, long, booming laughter that lasted long after he left the building. But that was a good thing, that was a sign that the devil was pleased. That the contract was binding, that the terms were agreed upon, and that he had no choice but to fulfill his end of the bargain. But when he walked out the building, he could hear the devil again. Only this time, the laughter was louder, as if he was clapping his hands in approval.\n\nAnd when he looked back, he saw the devil standing there, arms outstretched, and a massive grin on his face. And standing beside him, was a woman, smiling and laughing at Leroy, her eyes gleaming with a mischievous light. \"That was a good one!\" she exclaimed, \"You are a true master, a master of tricks and deception!\" And the devil smiled, nodding his head in approval, \"I have never seen anyone so cunning, so clever. And to think that you managed to trick me.\"\n\nLeroy just shook his head, chuckling as he did so, \"I just did what I thought was right, that is all. I am a desperate man, and I did what I thought would get me what I needed.\" He paused, turning his gaze upon the woman, \"Who are you, anyway?\"\n\nThe woman smiled, raising her hands to her mouth, \"I am the one who collected your sole, your soul. You could call me the collector, or the accountant. But I think I like'sole' better, it is a nice play on words.\" She said, tapping her chin as she did so. The devil just laughed again, as if to say, \"That was a good one, that was a good one.\"\n\nAnd as Leroy watched the two laugh, he could not help but feel a little bit of pride. He had pulled off the trick, the one where he tricked the devil out of his soul. And when he walked away from the building, he knew that he was free. He could live out the rest of his days in comfort, and he would live out those days as a man half his age, without a care in the world. And when he turned to look back, the devil and the woman were gone, replaced by two pairs of shoes, 100 pairs of shoes."

I sat in the snow and I began to cry. I could hear someone approaching and I looked up to see my wife and I standing in front of me. We were both crying as we hugged each other. \"I'm sorry,\" we said at the same time. I turned to her and I kissed her and I whispered, \"I love you.\""

I felt a flutter in my chest as I saw his body, it had been centuries since I had last felt this sensation.\n\nHe had one hand on the hilt of his sword, and the other on his shield, his armor shined in the light of my bedroom. He looked around the room, his armor making a clicking noise as he moved his body.\n\n\"Where is everyone?\" He said.\n\nI couldn't help but laugh, \"You are alone here, no one else is awake.\" I said.\n\nHe tilted his head slightly, his voice remained low, \"I don't remember the way out.\" He said.\n\nI smiled, \"I can give you directions.\" I said as I got out of my bed. I was wearing a nightgown, it was white and silky, it hugged my body perfectly. I had always loved sleeping in nightgowns, they were so comfortable.\n\nI walked closer to him, the room was large, it had high ceilings, and large windows. There was a large bed in the center of the room, I had been sleeping in it for hundreds of years. Next to the bed was a large fireplace, it was made of stone, it had a large iron door.\n\nI reached out to the knight, \"I am Princess Aurora, it has been a long time since I have been awake. I must admit that I am curious as to what happened during my slumber.\" I said, my hands were inches from his face.\n\nHis face didn't change, he remained still, I reached up to touch his face, but he moved his head to the side. I stopped my movement and smiled, \"Are you afraid of me?\" I said.\n\nHis helmet tilted, his voice was deep and gruff, \"I am not afraid of you.\" He said.\n\nI reached out to him again, his helmet was still on his head, I could see his face through the visor, he was still wearing the helmet. I didn't bother to remove it, I placed my hand on his shoulder, \"You have to be careful when you get close to me. I was awakened by true love's kiss, and I must be bound to someone for life.\" I said.\n\nHe didn't flinch, \"I am not afraid of you.\" He said again, his voice was firm.\n\nI couldn't help but laugh, \"You must be a very brave man, I am much stronger than you.\" I said.\n\nHe looked down at my hand, it was small compared to his body, \"I am not afraid of you.\" He said again.\n\nI placed my hand on my heart, \"I have slept for hundreds of years, and yet you are not afraid of me.\" I said.\n\nHe looked up at me, his helmet still on his head, \"I am not afraid of you.\" He said again.\n\nI couldn't help but laugh, \"I don't know if you are brave or foolish, but I must admit that I like you.\" I said.\n\nHe looked away from me, \"I need to get back to my room.\" He said.\n\nI walked up to him, \"It has been a long time since I have been awake. I must admit that I am curious as to what happened during my slumber. I would like to get to know you better.\" I said.\n\nHe looked at me, his voice was firm, \"I am not interested in you.\" He said.\n\nI felt like I had been punched in the gut, \"What do you mean?\" I said.\n\nHe looked away from me, \"I am not interested in you.\" He said again.\n\nI felt like I had been punched in the gut again, \"You have to be more clear. You have to tell me that you don't like me, you have to tell me that you don't want to know me.\" I said.\n\nHe looked at me, his helmet still on his head, \"I don't want to know you.\" He said.\n\nI felt like I had been punched in the gut again, \"I need to go back to my slumber. I need to sleep.\" I said.\n\nHe looked at me, his helmet still on his head, \"I will make sure you sleep.\" He said.\n\nI smiled, \"Thank you.\" I said, then I kissed him."

        "pred_story": "The cross, always the cross. A staple of the occult, demon summoning, and the like. You can't just call up a demon without some proper symbols and incantations. What happens when you're a young adult and you try to summon a demon?\n\nYou don't get a demon, that's what. You get Peter, an old man who's about ready to die and isn't happy about it.\n\n\"Where am I?\" the old man yells. \"What did you do to me? I was in my rocking chair, I know it!\"\n\nHe points to a cross hanging on the wall, with the ends facing the floor instead of the ceiling. \"What the hell is this? You think this is funny?\"\n\nThe old man doesn't realize that he's a ghost. He thinks that someone brought him to an old, dimly lit room. He even believes that the cross he's staring at is his. What the old man doesn't realize is that we're still living in the present.\n\n\"Um, you are a ghost, sir,\" I say. \"I think you might be about ready to die.\"\n\nPeter stares at me. His eyes are bloodshot. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I'm the one who summoned you,\" I say. \"And your name is Peter. You don't remember that?\"\n\n\"I remember my name,\" Peter says, looking around the room. \"I just don't remember how I got here. What is this?\"\n\n\"You're a ghost,\" I repeat. \"You've died, and you've come to the afterlife.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't believe in that nonsense,\" Peter says. \"Hell or heaven? No, I'm just an old man who can't get out of this room.\"\n\nThe old man falls to the floor. \"I just want to go home,\" he says. \"I want to see my wife. She thinks I'm already dead. She doesn't know where I'm at.\"\n\n\"You need to accept your death,\" I say. \"Let go of your physical body.\"\n\n\"I don't know how,\" Peter says.\n\n\"Hey, if you want help, I'll help you,\" someone says.\n\nIt's Alex, my friend. He's holding a cell phone.\n\n\"You'll help me?\" Peter asks. \"You can help me?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Alex says. \"But first, I need to call my grandma.\"\n\n\"Your grandma?\" Peter asks. \"What does she have to do with anything?\"\n\n\"She can help us,\" Alex says.\n\n\"Oh, it's a group effort now?\" Peter asks.\n\n\"Hey, if you want help, you have to cooperate,\" Alex says.\n\n\"Fine,\" Peter says. \"Call her.\"\n\nI get up and leave the room. There's no need for me to stay.\n\nI walk to the main room and see that there are a few other friends there.\n\n\"Hey, you called us?\" someone asks.\n\n\"Yeah, I summoned a demon,\" I say. \"But it was the wrong demon.\"\n\n\"A demon?\" someone asks. \"What's going on?\"\n\n\"A guy named Peter,\" I say. \"He's a ghost. He thinks he's stuck in this room.\"\n\n\"Oh, cool,\" someone says. \"Can we talk to him?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I say. \"But first, he needs help from a grandma.\"\n\n\"Grandma?\" someone asks. \"We need the help of a grandma?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" I say. \"She's old, and she's good at finding ghosts.\"\n\n\"Sounds like a grandma,\" someone says.\n\n\"Hey, I'm a grandma!\" a voice says.\n\n\"Grandma!\" someone yells.\n\nI turn to see an old woman with a warm smile.\n\n\"Hey, sweetie,\" she says. \"Come and give your grandma a hug.\"\n\nThe old woman runs over and gives me a hug.\n\n\"Who's that?\" someone asks.\n\n\"That's my grandma,\" I say.\n\n\"Your grandma?\" someone asks. \"What does she have to do with this?\"\n\n\"Grandma knows a thing or two about ghosts,\" I say. \"And she's going to help us.\"\n\n\"Awesome,\" someone says.\n\nI go back to the room. Peter is still sitting on the floor.\n\n\"Peter, I have a grandma,\" I say. \"She can help you.\"\n\n\"What's she going to do?\" Peter asks.\n\n\"She's going to help us find your way,\" I say.\n\n\"Oh, I would like that,\" Peter says. \"Thank you.\"\n\nThe old woman walks into the room. \"Hi, Peter,\" she says. \"I'm your grandma. You look a little sad.\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah, I am,\" Peter says. \"I'm stuck in this room.\"\n\nThe old woman sits down beside Peter.\n\n\"We need to find a way to get you out of the room, Peter,\" she says. \"Let me think for a second.\"\n\nThe old woman takes out her cell phone and looks at it.\n\n\"I've got it,\" she says. \"Peter, you need to go back to your rocking chair.\"\n\n\"Why is that?\" Peter asks.\n\n\"Because you need to let go of this room,\" the old woman says.\n\nPeter looks at his friends and me.\n\n\"I don't want to let go,\" he says. \"I don't want to leave you all.\"\n\n\"It's okay, Peter,\" I say. \"You can see us again. We're not going anywhere.\"\n\nPeter looks at me, and he smiles.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he says. \"I'm glad you understand.\"\n\nPeter looks at the old woman.\n\n\"Thank you, Grandma,\" he says. \"I know you're helping us.\"\n\n\"You're welcome, Peter,\" the old woman says. \"You take care now, and don't forget to take your rocking chair with you. You might need it someday.\"\n\nThe old woman smiles and stands up.\n\n\"We'll catch you later, Grandma,\" I say.\n\n\"Okay, sweetie,\" she says. \"Bye.\"\n\nThe old woman walks away. \"Bye, Peter,\" she says.\n\nPeter stands up and holds onto the cross.\n\n\"I don't want to let go,\" he says.\n\n\"Peter, it's okay,\" I say. \"You can still see us. We're not going anywhere.\"\n\n\"But I don't want to leave,\" he says.\n\n\"I know you don't,\" I say. \"But it's okay to let go. You're ready to move on.\"\n\nPeter sighs. \"Okay,\" he says. \"I'm ready.\"\n\nHe drops the cross, and it hits the floor.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Peter says. \"I'm glad I could say goodbye.\"\n\n\"It's okay,\" I say. \"You'll see us again someday. We're not going anywhere.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Peter says. \"I just wanted to say goodbye.\"\n\n\"That's okay,\" I say. \"It's okay to let go.\"\n\n\"Goodbye,\" Peter says. \"I'm ready.\"\n\n\"Goodbye, Peter,\" I say.\n\nPeter walks away, and he disappears.\n\n\"Bye, Peter,\" the old man says.\n\n\"Bye, Peter,\" someone says.\n\n\"Bye, Peter,\" I say.\n\n\"Bye, Peter,\" someone says.\n\n\"Goodbye, Peter,\" Alex says.\n\n\"Goodbye, Peter,\" someone says.\n\nWe leave the room and go back home. \"That was cool,\""

        "pred_story": "\"The Coughing Baby Dungeon\"\n\nIt's been years since I first entered this place. I must have come here a dozen times to get my level up and to get some good training in before I head off to the next job. \n\nI'm sure many others are like me here, coming here to try out new spells or get some more experience for the next job. Many adventurers make it a point to come here to test their gear to see if they've been buffed or debuffed. It's a place that's just right for beginners and veterans alike.\n\nJust then, one of my friends walks into the room. He's still a novice, but this place is perfect for that.\n\n\"Hey Kiko! Come check out this room. I'm still trying to figure out the last two monsters. Hehe.\"\n\nKiko's eyes lit up when I said that. He had a few more levels to get to be able to open the last two monsters in the dungeon.\n\n\"I'll give you a hand, but first let's get some loot from the last room before they get sealed.\"\n\nThe two of us started gathering all of the treasure from the room. I've been here many times before, but I was happy to help Kiko get started in my journey. After we were done, we went to the final room and started clearing the room.\n\n\"Kiko, why don't you start on that monster over there. I'll go after that one over there.\"\n\nKiko nodded and started fighting the monster. I was about to start on the other one when I heard a loud crash and screams from outside.\n\n\"What was that? It sounds like... the Super Dragon!\"\n\n\"The Super Dragon? That's impossible. He was sealed away by the best of the best for his crimes. How is he now unsealed?\"\n\n\"It looks like we are going to find out. Let's go!\" we said as we rushed to the outside.\n\nIt was as expected, the entire forest had been torn apart. We saw trees and stones flying everywhere. And then we saw him, the Super Dragon, flying over the forest. He was bigger than I remembered.\n\n\"Hey look over there! Are you guys coming?\"\n\nWe saw a figure waving at us from across the forest. She had an old hat on her head and a staff in her hand.\n\n\"That's Wanda. It looks like she's got a plan. Let's go!\"\n\nWe rushed over and followed Wanda. We came to a clearing and there was Wanda, standing and looking up at the sky.\n\n\"Kiko, did you bring a map of this forest? We'll need to get out of here before he destroys it all.\"\n\nKiko looked at me and then back at Wanda. I was just as confused as him.\n\n\"I don't think I can help. I didn't bring a map. Sorry.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid we will have to leave now. We'll come back and clear it out once we get the map.\"\n\nWanda looked up at the sky again and gasped.\n\n\"It's not just a map that we need. It's a spell! There are adventurers that can't cast spells. What do we do?\"\n\nI couldn't believe that Wanda said that. I looked at her and saw that she was serious. I looked back at Kiko and saw that he was equally confused.\n\n\"Uh... I don't know what to say. I'm just a novice. Sorry.\"\n\n\"You can be my apprentice and I will teach you this spell. It's a good thing that you're a novice. I'm sure you have the skills.\"\n\nWanda smiled at me and then looked back at the sky. I saw Kiko smile and then start to clap.\n\nI couldn't believe it. I looked at Kiko and he looked at me.\n\n\"I'm going to be your apprentice now. I'm going to be rich someday.\"\n\nI couldn't believe that I just lost my friend. Kiko was a strong novice and would have been a great ally.\n\nI looked back at Wanda and smiled.\n\n\"Thank you for the offer. I'll be your apprentice. But first, can you help me and Kiko escape?\"\n\nWanda smiled at me and we both turned and ran. We ran for about a mile until we got to the edge of the forest. We stopped and looked up.\n\nWanda cast a spell that made me and Kiko look like two small monsters. Then she cast another spell that made us look like two babies. As soon as we did, the Super Dragon flew down and chased us. We didn't dare look back and kept running.\n\nAfter a while, the Super Dragon gave up and went back to the forest. We stopped and laughed.\n\nThat was the most fun I had in a long time.\n\nI looked at Wanda and smiled.\n\n\"Thank you for saving me from that monster. But I don't think I want to be a mage. I'll just go back to being a novice.\"\n\nWanda smiled and looked at me.\n\n\"I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm just glad that you can help us fight him.\"\n\nKiko looked at us and smiled.\n\n\"Yay! I'm going to be a rich mage someday!\""

Are you insane?\" \n\nI was a merchant, a normal human living a normal life. There wasn't much more to life other than making money and living off it. However, after I lost my job, I knew it was only a matter of time before I found myself in a worse financial situation. It didn't help that I was stuck with two of my roommate, who weren't exactly the nicest people. \n\nThat's why I was so excited to get isekai'd. I was looking to make a profit, and the best way to do that was to start a business. However, after the magic artifact took me to the other world, I couldn't find any business opportunities. I was stuck in a world where magic was real, and I didn't know how to navigate it. \n\n\"It's not like I wanted to go. I was literally dragged through a portal by a magical artifact. And honestly, the artifact was the only thing that helped me. It helped me find my feet in the other world.\" \n\n\"And then you took advantage of the magical powers of the other world to get ahead, and now you're a rich merchant. I don't care about how you got there, just the fact that you're here.\" \n\n\"I'm not that rich, I'm not even really successful, at least not yet.\" I said. \n\n\"Whatever. I'm going back to work. If you don't want to get a job, then that's your problem.\" \n\nI sighed as my roommate walked out the door, slamming it shut before I could say anything. I sighed and fell onto my couch. If I wasn't in this situation, I would have been able to get a job and support my roommate. \n\nBut I couldn't go back. There was no way to get back to the other world. That's why I was here, to make the most of a bad situation. And I was going to do that."

I'm not exactly a catch.\"\n\nShe raised an eyebrow, looking at me. \"What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\n\"I mean, you're a catch. I'm not. I've been in an accident. I'm in a coma sometimes.\"\n\nShe sighed, looking away. \"That's not true, stop saying that. And no, it's true, I'm not a catch.\"\n\nI smiled, feeling a little better. \"So how come you said yes? Why?\"\n\nShe sighed again, looking down at the ring. \"I really wanted to say no, you know? That was the plan.\"\n\nI frowned. \"I thought you had no plans.\"\n\nShe scoffed. \"Yeah, no, that's just what I told you. But there's a plan, for every situation.\"\n\n\"Like?\"\n\n\"Like this one.\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"No idea, just go with it, okay?\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a little confused. \"And what were you going to say no to?\"\n\n\"No proposal?\"\n\nI nodded. \"But you already said yes.\"\n\nShe sighed. \"That was the plan.\"\n\nI frowned, confused. \"The plan was to say no to a proposal?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"Yeah, that's the thing about plans. They often don't work out the way they're supposed to.\"\n\nI frowned, thinking about it for a moment. \"So why did you say yes?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"I really wanted to say no, but I really don't like being told what to do, even when it's myself. So I said yes.\"\n\nI frowned, raising my brows. \"But the plan was to say no. So you shouldn't have said yes.\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"Plan or no plan, I wanted to say yes. I did.\"\n\nI frowned again, the look on my face a little annoyed. \"So you're saying you did something against the plan?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"Yeah. That's what I'm saying.\"\n\nI looked away, the look on my face a little annoyed. \"Okay. Well, if you wanted to say yes, why did you keep saying that you were going to say no?\"\n\nShe shrugged again. \"I don't know. Maybe I'm a bad liar?\"\n\nI raised my brows, feeling a little annoyed. \"What?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yeah. So there you have it. That's what happened.\"\n\nI sighed, looking down at the floor. \"So you're saying that you're a bad liar?\"\n\nShe shrugged again. \"Yeah.\"\n\nI looked up at her, raising my brows. \"What was I supposed to say?\"\n\nShe smiled, her face looking a little sad. \"No one likes liars.\"\n\nI sighed, looking down at the floor again. \"Okay.\"\n\nShe sighed, looking away. \"I really wanted to say no, you know. That was the plan.\"\n\nI sighed, feeling a little annoyed. \"Yeah, I know. You said.\"\n\nShe looked at me, raising her brows. \"I did?\"\n\nI nodded. \"Yes.\"\n\nShe shrugged, the smile on her face a little sad. \"Yeah.\"\n\nWe sat in silence for a moment, the only sound the ticking of the clock. \"I still don't understand,\" I finally said. \"If you really wanted to say no, why did you say yes?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"Maybe you're supposed to find out?\"\n\nI looked at her, raising my brows. \"Find out what?\"\n\nShe shrugged again. \"Maybe you'll find out in the future. Maybe you'll find out next week. Maybe you'll find out in a year. Maybe you'll find out next year. Who knows?\"\n\nI sighed, looking down at the floor again. \"Okay.\"\n\nShe sighed, looking away. \"It was fun.\"\n\nI nodded, still looking down at the floor. \"Yeah.\"\n\nShe stood, taking off her shoes. \"I should go.\"\n\nI nodded again, still looking down at the floor. \"Yeah.\"\n\nShe walked over to me, kneeling down in front of me. \"Thank you for saying yes.\"\n\nI looked at her, raising my brows. \"It's really no big deal, I just wanted to see if you would actually say no.\"\n\nShe smiled, smiling at me. \"Well, you didn't do too bad, but still, I think you might have had a better chance if you had proposed to someone else.\"\n\nI rolled my eyes, smiling back at her. \"Yeah, I'm not going to be picky. You're still a catch.\"\n\nShe smiled back, standing up and picking up her shoes. \"I'm glad you think so. Thanks again, maybe I'll see you tomorrow?\"\n\nI nodded, smiling. \"Yeah, sure.\"\n\nShe smiled again, then left my room. I looked up at the clock, sighing. I had to sleep for the next three hours before my shift at work, and I still had to clean up the room. I got up, picking up the trash. \"I still don't understand,\" I said, sighing. \"If you really wanted to say no, why did you say yes?\"\n\nI looked at myself, raising my brows. \"You're not going to figure it out anytime soon, so why not have some fun and play games?\"\n\nI sighed, cleaning up more trash. \"Like what?\"\n\nI raised my brows, smiling to myself. \"I'm not sure, but I'm sure I'll think of something. Maybe I'll find out tomorrow.\"\n\nI looked over at the bed, sighing. \"I hope she doesn't say no when I wake up.\""

How are we in a castle?\"\n\nMy friend sighed and rubbed their face. \"I didn't know what else to do.

I didn't expect it to control me instead.\"\n\nI shook my head, not understanding. \"Why would you even try?\"\n\nThey looked up at me, and for a moment, I saw the man I had known before he was turned into a dark reflection of himself. \"Because we were going to die.

I thought we were against the kingdom.\"\n\nMy companion looked at me with a sad expression. \"We were, but we didn't have a choice. I was in control from the start. I didn't need you, but I decided to let you join me just to make things more fun. We would have died at the hands of the dark knights if not for the artifact.\"\n\n\"You knew?\"\n\nI sighed, knowing the answer. My companion nodded. \"I did. I was going to give it back, but something changed. The artifact took over and was controlling me. It's been hard to resist, but I'm going to do it.\"\n\nI walked up to the throne and looked at my companion. \"Why?\"\n\nThey looked down, and for a moment, I thought I saw tears in their eyes, but they were gone. \"I don't know. I feel like we would be killing each other if I don't give it back. We both hate each other, but there's still a part of me in this body. I want to know who I was before this all started.\"\n\nI turned and walked away from them. \"Okay.\"\n\nI walked over to the door, but before I could open it, I turned back to my companion. \"You should destroy it after you give it back. We can't leave the kingdom vulnerable like this.\"\n\nI turned and opened the door. \"I'll get out of here. There's a group of rebels that want to fight against the kingdom. Maybe we can work together.\"\n\nI turned back to look at my companion, and they smiled. \"That sounds good.\"\n\nI turned and walked out of the door, closing it behind me."

She had been playing with the other kids for a while, and I couldn\u2019t help but smile as I watched her laugh and play. \n\n\u201cCan I watch you this time?\u201d I asked, trying to sound like I was trying to help.\n\nEmily nodded happily.  She climbed up the ladder on the side of the slide and ran up to the top.  She got in and ran to the top of the slide.  Then she climbed out and rolled across the ground, coming to a stop next to the little slide.\n\nA boy jumped off the slide and ran to a boy who had never gone down the slide.  The boy who never went down the slide picked the boy up and carried him to the top of the slide.  Then he ran around the side of the playground and disappeared. The boy who had gone down the slide sat down in a ball and rolled to the bottom.\n\nMy mind was a bit confused, but I didn\u2019t think about it for too long because Emily asked me if she could go down the slide again.\n\nEmily ran down the slide and crawled across the ground.  Again the boy jumped from the top of the slide and ran around to the other side of the playground where the same boy disappeared.  But this time I saw him.  He was a tall boy with a red hat and a black shirt.  He was laughing and running through the forest, like he was having the time of his life.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t think too much about it because I realized I had been missing a boy every time I watched a child go down the slide.  At first I thought it was just because I was busy watching my child, but the more I watched it was obvious.  Every time a boy went down the slide another boy who hadn\u2019t gone down the slide would run around the corner of the playground and disappear into the forest.\n\n\u201cMom, can I go down the slide again?\u201d Emily asked again.\n\n\u201cGo ahead\u201d I answered, watching as she ran up to the slide and crawled to the bottom.\n\nAgain the boy ran off the slide and disappeared.  But this time I followed him.  As I ran I realized he wasn\u2019t much faster than my five-year-old.  After a few minutes of running I caught up to him and asked him what was happening.  He answered that he was taking the other children home.\n\nAs we kept running I realized I had never seen the boy before.  But I knew he was a special person.  He must have been a guardian of some kind.  And I realized the other children must be angels."

        "pred_story": "\u201cWelcome back, class,\u201d my professor said, gesturing to a small group of students and teachers who were standing around a pedestal in the corner of the room.\n\nWe had all been dismissed to the main auditorium for our demonstrations and were now filtering back to our classroom in the tower. I was tired, my legs aching from being on my feet for the whole demonstration. As I made my way through the doorway I couldn\u2019t help but notice the group of people that was standing in our classroom.\n\nMy stomach sank as I spotted the principal standing in the front of the group. She looked like she was having a serious conversation with my professor, but something in the way she was holding her chin told me that something was wrong. She looked like she had just sucked on a lemon and was trying to decide if she wanted to tell us, or let us find out on our own.\n\nI reached the doorway and was about to make my way to my desk when my professor turned to me and grabbed my shoulder.\n\n\u201cKathy,\u201d he said. \u201cCome here, now.\u201d\n\nI felt a chill run down my spine as he turned and walked over to the pedestal and the small group of students who were standing near it. As I followed him I could hear the door shut behind us. It was like I was being lead to the principal\u2019s office, but I had a feeling that it was going to be worse than any detention that I had ever gotten.\n\nThe group parted as my professor reached the pedestal and I could see a large, black piece of paper that was stretched across it. It was almost a foot longer than I was tall and half as wide. There were lines drawn all over it, a strange symbol in the center. It looked like a blackboard covered in chalk marks, but it didn\u2019t feel like one.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d I asked my professor, pointing to the piece of paper. \u201cIs that some kind of chalk board?\u201d I could feel the other students looking at me, waiting for my reaction.\n\nMy professor nodded, \u201cYes. It is. This is called a scrye.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the symbol in the center. \u201cThat is the sigil that you used to open the scrye. I hope you remember, Kathy, because it is your sigil that will bind you to this piece of paper, to this scrye.\u201d\n\nI felt my heart racing as I looked at the scrye. I had opened it just a moment before my demonstration, hoping to get a glimpse of my future, maybe see a problem that I could solve before it happened. The moment I did I felt a rush of power come from it. I had felt like I was able to lift a mountain with the smallest thought. I had felt powerful.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m calling you over here,\u201d my professor said. He gestured to the other students who were watching us. \u201cThis is why I called your classmates over here. This is why I called the principal.\u201d\n\nI felt a cold sweat beading on my brow. There was only one reason that my professor would be calling me and everyone else into the room, something that had happened to just a few of us in the past.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, trying to sound brave. I wanted to hold on to the feeling of power that I had felt when I opened the scrye, but I knew that I couldn\u2019t. This was the part of the year when we discovered if we would make it through.\n\n\u201cLook at the scrye again, Kathy,\u201d my professor said.\n\nI looked back at it, seeing the symbol that I had drawn. It was strange. It looked like a simple X, but in the center there was a small arrow, pointing to the top of the paper.\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d I asked. I was worried that I had done something wrong when I opened the scrye, something that would send me to the darkness.\n\n\u201cIt means that you have been chosen,\u201d my professor answered. He was smiling. \u201cYou have been chosen by the elders. You will be going on the hunt.\u201d\n\nI felt my jaw fall to the ground. \u201cThe hunt?\u201d I had heard about the hunt, it was something that a few of my classmates had been chosen for, but it had been years since any had been chosen.\n\n\u201cYes. You have been chosen. You will be going on the hunt next week.\u201d\n\nI felt a rush of excitement at the thought of the hunt. I had heard stories about it, about how it was the greatest honor that a student could be given. I wanted to be a part of it, but I also wanted to make sure that I would be selected next year, so I would have to ask.\n\n\u201cAre there any other things that I need to do,\u201d I asked my professor. I wanted to make sure that I would be selected next year.\n\n\u201cYes. You will need to practice,\u201d he answered.\n\nI nodded, \u201cOkay. Is there anything else that I need to know?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust one more thing,\u201d my professor said, looking at the principal. \u201cThe principal has been asked to assign you to a group of students and teachers that will help you on the hunt.\u201d\n\nI looked at her and saw her smile. \u201cIt will be an honor, Kathy. I will make sure that you are assigned the best people for the job.\u201d\n\nI felt a rush of excitement. I knew that my friends would be happy for me, but I also knew that it would be a little different now. I would be leaving with a group of others, and when we returned, I would be a part of something bigger. I couldn\u2019t wait to see what this new journey would bring.\n\nThanks for reading. I hope you enjoyed it. If you want to continue the story, please let me know."

I had been a servant of the Emperor, and after my resurrection, I found I was no longer in service to him, but my own master, to serve myself.\n\nThis life is quite boring, I could only drink the blood of animals, which is not the same as the taste of human blood, and the best source of blood is the blood of a young boy, because their blood is pure, but it is hard for me to get my hands on a young boy, not to mention that if anyone finds out that I, a prince, are drinking the blood of a young boy, I would be put to death at once, so I had to find another way to live. I became a vampire, to hunt the bandits who had tortured me to death, but that is also boring, as there is no pleasure in killing the bandits, and I became the bandits' leader, the Prince of the bandits, because I am the most skilled at killing.\n\nI have no family, and I have no friends, because I was born and died a thousand years ago, and my bandits are all born and died a thousand years ago, so they have no knowledge of my previous life, but they know that I have lived for a thousand years. They have all seen the Prince as a monster, because I am a vampire, and they fear me as their leader. I am the most skilled killer, and I kill anyone who I deem to be a threat to my bandits. I also eat human flesh on rare occasions, which I know is taboo, but I do not care, I am a monster.\n\nMy bandits also hunt the flesh of humans, but I do not, because I do not want them to think that I am not a prince. I am not a prince who eats human flesh, but a prince who kills humans for the sake of my bandits. I have been a bandit for over a thousand years, but I have become more and more bored with the same routine. I always see the same people, the same animals, the same place, and I want to live a different life, but there is no way for me to escape.\n\nMy only comfort is the blood of animals, which I drink often, and the blood of humans, which I drink from time to time, but I do not dare to drink too much. I also need to find more and more ways to kill people, but I do not want to see the bodies of people, because that is also boring.\n\nBut all of these things changed last night, as I saw a human couple who was camping in the woods. I was drinking the blood of a deer, but I saw them, and I was immediately attracted to the woman. She was beautiful, and I could see that she was kind and gentle, and that she loved her husband very much. I could see the way she smiled at him, and the way she held his hand, and I felt a pang of jealousy. I was a prince, and I had no friends or family, and I had no love in my life, and the thought of loving a woman and having a family was something that I had never considered before.\n\nBut now that I had met this woman, I realized how much I wanted her. I wanted to be with her, to hold her in my arms, to kiss her, to bite her neck, and to taste her blood, but I did not know how to do that. The husband saw me, and he screamed and ran away, but the wife was frozen in fear. I went to her, but I did not know what to do, so I asked her if she wanted to come with me, to be my queen, and she laughed and asked if I thought she was crazy. She said that she did not want to be with a monster, and that she would not let her husband do that to her. She turned her back and ran away, and I was heartbroken.\n\nI was heartbroken because I had never felt that way before. I had always thought that I was a monster, and that I was not meant to be with humans, but now that I had met this woman, I realized that I did want to be with her. I wanted to love her, to be with her, to be her husband, but I knew that that would not work, because she was a human, and I was a vampire, and that was something that was never going to happen.\n\nI was also heartbroken because I knew that I would never see her again, and that I would never have a chance to be with her. I was a monster, and I had no right to love a human, and I knew that I would never be able to tell her how I felt. I became the Prince of the Vampire, the Prince of the Bandits, the Prince of the Monsters, the Prince of the Shadows, and I was content to remain that way.\n\nBut then, one day, the Queen of the Vampires came to see me. She had come from the mountains far away, and she had come to see me because I was the most powerful vampire in the land. She came to me and said that she had heard about the woman I had seen, and that she wanted me to be with her. She wanted me to have a wife, a child, and a family, but I did not want any of that. I wanted to be alone, to hunt humans and animals, to feed on their blood, and to live in the shadows.\n\nThe Queen laughed and said that I was not alone, because I was a prince. I was a prince of the vampires, and I had a duty to fulfill. I was a prince of the bandits, and I had to hunt humans and animals. I was a prince of the monsters, and I had to feed on their flesh and blood. I was a prince of the shadows, and I had to live in the darkness. I was a prince, and I had to fulfill my duty.\n\nThe Queen said that I did not have to choose between being a prince and being a human. I could be a prince and a human, a prince and a vampire, a prince and a husband, a prince and a wife, and a prince and a child. I could have it all, because I was a prince. I was a prince, and I was free to do what I wanted, and the Queen was right. I did not have to choose between being a prince and being a human. I could be both, because I was a prince.\n\nI became the Prince of the Vampire, the Prince of the Bandits, the Prince of the Monsters, the Prince of the Shadows, the Prince of the Love, and the Prince of the Family. I became the Prince of the Vampires, the Prince of the Bandits, the Prince of the Monsters, the Prince of the Shadows, the Prince of the Love, and the Prince of the Family. I found a wife, a child"

        "pred_story": "**The Unfinishable Voyage**\n\nWhen I was a little boy, my grandfather told me of his dreams. For as long as I can remember, his eyes glowed with a fire that seemed like they belonged to a man not of this world. He spoke of the open waters and the endless sky, a world where the sea and land collided into one in a cacophony of salt and wind. He said he was meant for the sea, but the sea was not meant for him. His voice was laced with a deep sadness as he spoke, telling tales of the endless waves and the emptiness that he felt.\n\nI didn't understand it then, but now I did.\n\nThe wreck stood in the middle of the ocean, its remains a hollowed out reminder of a ship that once sailed the world. The sea had claimed it as its own, wrapping the carcass of a creature in its embrace. I stood atop the deck, the wooden slats cracked and worn away by the relentless pounding of the waves. There was no sign of struggle or of battles. The wreck was simply there, a reminder of what once was.\n\nIt was then that I saw the figure.\n\nOr rather, it was then that I felt the call.\n\nIt was something primal, a call to action that I couldn't ignore. Something inside of me awoke, and I knew exactly where I was. The wreck called to me, its spirit an insistent whisper in my mind. It was a siren's call, a call to action that I couldn't refuse. There was no use in resisting it, no use in trying to fight it down. It was a call that would drive me to madness if I tried.\n\nI touched the wood.\n\nIt cracked.\n\nThe ship groaned.\n\nThe ship began to reform itself, its remains shifting and moving. The old, worn wood gave way to newer, smoother planks. The wooden slats returned to their original position, smooth and unbroken. A new ship emerged, one that was perfect in its construction, its edges sharp and clean.\n\nI stood in the middle of the ship, its deck stretching out in every direction. There was no wind or waves, just a perfect calm. I could feel the weight of the ship's history bearing down on me, the countless storms and battles that had shaped it into what it was today.\n\nA hand grasped my shoulder.\n\n\"Captain,\" a voice said. \"It is time to begin.\"\n\nI turned to see the figure standing next to me, a man tall and imposing. His eyes burned with an inner fire, a fire that seemed to be born of the same flames that had driven my grandfather.\n\n\"The voyage is not yet finished,\" I replied, my voice shaking. \"The sea has called to me, but I know not what I am meant to do.\"\n\nThe man turned to me, his eyes full of understanding. \"The sea knows its own,\" he said. \"All you need to do is listen.\"\n\nI turned back to the horizon, my eyes scanning the endless expanse of water. I could feel the call growing stronger, a call that was pulling me out into the unknown. I took a deep breath, feeling the call wash over me.\n\n\"It is time,\" the man said. \"The voyage has begun.\"\n\nI smiled, feeling a sense of purpose that I hadn't felt in years.\n\nI stood at the helm of the ship, the wind whipping my hair into a frenzy. The sun beat down on me, its warm rays a welcome comfort as I scanned the horizon for any sign of land. The waves crashed against the ship, sending spray flying everywhere. I laughed, feeling alive for the first time in years.\n\nThe sea was a cruel mistress, but it was also a siren's call, drawing me to it with a force that I couldn't ignore. I felt it in my blood, the call of the sea a primal pull that drove me to do something that I couldn't quite explain.\n\nThe man stood next to me, his eyes fixed on the horizon. He was a shadow of my grandfather, but with the same fire that burned inside. His eyes met mine, and I knew that he understood me.\n\n\"Where are we headed?\" I asked, shouting over the wind.\n\nHe grinned, a mischievous glint in his eye. \"The world,\" he said. \"We will sail it, and no man will stand in our way.\"\n\nI laughed again, the call of the sea growing stronger with every passing moment.\n\nI knew that this was it, that this was my chance to fulfill my dreams. The voyage was just beginning, and I was ready to face whatever came next."

I am not the first to go mad, but I am possibly the last sane person who has done so.\n\nThey say that the abyss stares back at you. They say that when you look into its void, it will look back with all the madness and despair that it has accumulated over the centuries. They say that it will gaze into your soul and find the darkest corners where the horrors that you have committed or seen live.\n\nThe abyss did not have a name, for it is not alive. It is death, the void left by all that has been lost, the silence where all things that once were now stand. The abyss is the end, the end of all things. It is not malevolent, it is simply the end. The end of life, of the universe, of all that once was.\n\nThe abyss was created by the same accident that created life, a cosmic catastrophe where life bloomed on a planet and the universe went mad with all the emotions of that life. The universe was young and still learning how to create and destroy, it birthed life and gave it the power to live, and then in its mad desire to see what life could do, it took life away again. The universe was reborn, and the abyss was left as a reminder of what once was.\n\nThe abyss does not look back, it simply is. It is the end of the universe, and it simply is. It does not care that you look into it, it does not even acknowledge your existence, nor does it care that you have been driven mad by it. The abyss does not have an opinion on you, nor does it even care about you.\n\nThe abyss is simply the end, the end of all things. And I am the last sane person to see it.\n\nI am the last sane person to look into the abyss because I do not mind it. I do not mind that I am staring into the end of all things. I do not mind that I am staring into the void left by all that has been lost. I do not mind that I am staring into death, for death is simply another step in life.\n\nI do not mind that I am staring into the abyss, because the abyss does not stare back. It does not have a face, nor does it have any opinion on me. The abyss simply is, and that is enough for me. It is enough for me because I do not need any other reason for existence. I do not need any other reason to live because I know that death is the end.\n\nDeath is the end of all things. I know that because I am standing on its precipice. I am standing at the edge of the abyss, and I am staring into the void left by all that has been lost. And I am happy.\n\nI am happy because the abyss is simply the end. I am happy because the abyss does not look back at me. I am happy because I am the last sane person to stare into its depths, and that is enough for me. That is enough for me because I know that I will not be driven mad by the abyss. I will not be driven mad by the end of all things. I will not be driven mad by the void left by all that has been lost.\n\nI will not be driven mad by the abyss because I know that it is simply the end.

But I'm going to make one thing very clear: you are going to appear in public, and you are going to behave like everything is normal. If you're not, then it will raise suspicions. And if that happens, it will all fall apart, and you and I will both be at risk. So I want you to be aware of that and I want you to be on your best behavior.\""

        "pred_story": "I'm the boss of this hellhole, and I can't stop the feeling that a monster is living in my head. One that feeds off my emotions, and the emotions of everyone around me. I can't even begin to fathom what it would take to get rid of it, assuming there was a way to get rid of it. And now, people are telling me that I've become rather... enthusiastic. Like, enthusiastic. You know, like a maniac. I've got to ask, have you ever really listened to a person for hours on end without getting frustrated? There aren't many people like me around, and there probably aren't many people like you. But, there's a reason for that. I think I might know why. There's a reason why I've been able to land a job like this. I don't get stressed when I'm dealing with people, in fact, I rather enjoy it. I enjoy listening to their stories, problems, and frustrations. And, because I do, I'm better at my job than any of my coworkers. But, something's wrong. There's this... thing inside of me. It's something that craves all emotions, but most especially the negative ones. It's like a parasite, but it doesn't really feel like it's inside of me, and it doesn't really feel like it's alive. It's more like a thing inside of me that is always watching, always waiting. It's a thing that I've been ignoring, but it's something that I can't ignore anymore. \n\nI get to work one day, and I'm feeling a little off. I've been feeling a little off for a while, but I don't know what to do about it. I'm not really sure what's going on with my head, and I'm pretty sure that no one else is. But, I know that I've been hearing the voices in my head a lot more often lately. It's always the same voices, but they never really talk about anything. They just watch, wait, and wonder. They wonder if they can ever truly find a way to get rid of me. But, they can't. I'm just a vessel for the thing inside of me. A thing that is always watching, waiting, and craving. I'm a thing that eats away at the inside of people. I consume all negative emotions, and I use them for my own gain. I use them to grow, to grow and feed off my emotions. \n\nI'm a monster, and I know it. But, I'm not really sure how I can get rid of it. I don't really know how to stop it from eating away at my insides. But, I do know how to feed it. I know that by listening to people, by hearing their stories and problems, that I can feed it. I can give it all of the negative emotions that it's been craving. I've always been good at listening, and I've always been good at talking. I think that's the reason why I got this job. I think that's the reason why I'm the best at my job. I'm the best because I'm able to feed it. I'm the best because I'm able to take all of the emotions of the people around me and use them for my own gain. I'm the best because I'm a monster."

But I remember when it was the only power that made me a target for those that didn't understand. Because they didn't know that my power is the most important power of all.\n\nI can heal a broken bone, cure a disease, and restore damaged skin with my power. But I also have the power to heal emotional wounds. I can bring closure to a troubled heart, comfort to those that are in pain, and peace to a mind. \n\nMy power is the one that no one talks about.

        "pred_story": "The street lights were on when I went out. The sun was shining, I was pretty sure, so it felt like they were on early. But I wasn\u2019t thinking about that. The rest of my family had told me to be home when they came on. So I was home. My mom had asked me specifically not to go out after dark. I knew I was safe, I knew I\u2019d get home before it was dark, but I was still home. So no one had to know, right?\n\nExcept I wasn\u2019t home. I was back in my room, but it wasn\u2019t my room. My bed was too high for me to reach the top of it, and there was a lot of dust all over the room. I got up and walked over to the mirror and looked in it. That\u2019s when things got weird.\n\nI didn\u2019t know who this guy was. I knew my hair wasn\u2019t like this, I didn\u2019t have this much muscle, but I definitely wasn\u2019t this short. And the nose, I could have sworn my nose was larger than that. I stared into the mirror at my reflection, wondering if this was all some kind of prank. Was someone playing a prank on me? Had they somehow switched me out with this other person?\n\nI couldn\u2019t think about it too much. I needed to figure out what was going on. So I started by looking around my room. Everything was the same, except I couldn\u2019t remember the books on the shelf. But it was clearly my room, and I couldn\u2019t think about why it wasn\u2019t like this when I went out. My mom didn\u2019t like dust, she would be upset if she saw this.\n\nI walked over to the bed and looked underneath it. That\u2019s when I saw it. A piece of paper on the floor, partially hidden by the bed. I walked over and picked it up. It was my name, and I saw my hand writing at the bottom. It was me. I was this person, I was this guy.\n\nBut why did no one recognize me? I thought about all the times my family would be around each other, times when I would see them in a public place. My sister was always taking pictures, so why didn\u2019t I appear in any of them? Why didn\u2019t my parents mention me? This was all starting to freak me out. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nI went to the fridge and grabbed a drink, hoping the liquid would calm me down. It didn\u2019t, and I needed to think. So I sat down at the kitchen table and tried to focus. I went over all the times I had met my family in the past. My sister had always been taking pictures, but sometimes she missed people. But no one else had ever missed me. No one else had ever forgotten my face.\n\nI thought back to my first memories. I was at a beach with my family, it was one of the first times I had been on vacation. I remember a man being there, an older man. But he didn\u2019t recognize me. I watched as he tried to talk to my family, but they didn\u2019t seem to know who he was either. My mom tried to tell him she knew me, but he didn\u2019t believe her.\n\nI didn\u2019t understand what was going on, but I knew it wasn\u2019t normal. I wanted to talk to my mom about it, but she didn\u2019t want to talk to me. So I sat back and watched as the man left, wondering when everything would make sense again."

        "pred_story": "I always thought it odd how people said, \"If you can't serve the time, don't commit the crime.\" I never thought about it more than that. Until I found myself as the subject of the phrase.\n\nThey called me the Demon of Time. I thought it a bit silly, but the name stuck. I couldn't remember ever doing much that I'd regret. And yet, there I was.\n\nI lived in a small house in New York. I had a few friends. Nothing too exciting ever happened to me. I tried to avoid all the things that people did that led to bad consequences. But then I lost my job.\n\nIt was a few days ago, and things had been getting really bad. I hadn't had any money for months, and I was just getting by. But then I woke up to find myself in the basement. I was lying on a bed of dirt, and there was no way out that I could see.\n\nI called out to the world above, but no one answered. I tried calling for help, but no one came. I was completely alone.\n\nMy mind was racing, wondering how I had ended up here. It was just a few days ago that I'd been living my life. Now, I was trapped in this small, damp space with no idea what was happening or why.\n\nI tried to call out again. This time, a low voice replied, \"Welcome, mortal.\"\n\nI tried to move, but my limbs felt heavy, as if I was stuck to the floor.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked, my voice barely audible.\n\n\"You have called me a demon,\" the voice replied.\n\n\"I didn't mean to call you a demon,\" I said, \"I just didn't know what you were.\"\n\n\"I am the keeper of time. And you, mortal, have stolen time from me.\"\n\nI was confused, and a little frightened. \"I'm not sure what you mean.\"\n\n\"You have been given more time than you were meant to have. And you have used it to live a life of luxury.\"\n\nI couldn't believe what I was hearing. \"I'm not living a life of luxury.\"\n\n\"But you are. You live in a large house in New York. You eat the finest food and drink the finest wine. You have the most beautiful of women at your command.\"\n\n\"That's not true,\" I protested. \"I'm just a simple man.\"\n\nBut the keeper continued. \"Do you remember when you lost your job?\"\n\nI nodded. \"I think I may have.\"\n\n\"You did. But you did not serve the time for your crime. You did not have to wait for a new job to come along. But instead, you stole more time from me.\"\n\n\"But I didn't mean to. I didn't steal any time.\"\n\n\"You did. You stole years, perhaps even decades. But the world cannot allow you to have such power. So you are being brought here to serve your time.\"\n\nAs the keeper finished speaking, I began to feel a strange sensation. It was as if I was being pulled apart, and put back together again. And when it was over, I was different.\n\nMy house was gone. I was living in a small apartment, and I had no money. I had to apply for a new job, but I could not find work. And I realized that the keeper had told the truth.\n\nI was living a life of luxury, and I had stolen that life from someone else. I had stolen time from someone else. And now, I had to serve that time.\n\nMy time came in the form of a new life. I was born again, and my memories were gone. I was a new person, and I was not the same as before.\n\nBut I knew that I had made a grave mistake. And I was going to pay for it."

Let me tell you why that\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d\tLength: 463 words<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
        "pred_story": "You want to declare war? On the human race? Let me tell you why that's a bad idea. Firstly, the human race is already at war with itself, and the outcome is always the same. Secondly, the human race is at war with nature. And, thirdly, the human race is also at war with other animals. So, when you want to declare war on the human race, you're actually joining an already existing war, and you'll end up fighting against your allies, and you'll also lose in the end. Fourthly, the human race is also at war with itself, in a more subtle way. They're fighting with themselves over the little things in life. But, if you declare war, you'll end up fighting not only the rest of the world, but also with yourselves. Fifthly, the human race is actually a part of the animal kingdom. If you declare war, you'll end up fighting against other animals, and you'll end up losing in the end. And, sixthly, you'll end up fighting not only the animals, but also the nature. So, all in all, declaring war on the human race is a bad idea.\n\nNow, there's one thing more I need to tell you about war, and that's the outcome. War is not just a matter of winning or losing. War is actually a matter of destroying everything. When a war breaks out, everything gets destroyed, and everything gets lost. And, when the war ends, everyone suffers, and everyone loses. So, if you want to have a war, be prepared for the loss. But, if you're not prepared to lose, then don't start a war. \n\nNow, I know that you're not going to listen to me. But, I want to tell you something else. If you start a war on the human race, you'll lose. If you start a war on animals, you'll lose. If you start a war on nature, you'll lose. If you start a war on yourself, you'll lose. So, I want to ask you, what do you want to lose? \n\nSo, let me tell you something else. When it comes to war, it's not just about winning or losing. It's also about destroying everything. It's also about being destroyed yourself. And, when it comes to war, there's no place for you to hide, and there's no one to save you. So, when you start a war, you're starting a war against yourself. You're starting a war against everything. And, when you lose, you'll lose everything. And, when you lose, you'll lose everything that you ever had. So, don't start a war. Because, war is not a game. War is a matter of life and death. And, war is a matter of losing everything. \n\nNow, I know that you're going to ignore me. But, I want to tell you something else. War is not something that you can win. War is not something that you can lose. War is something that you cannot win. War is something that you cannot lose. War is something that you cannot escape from. War is something that you cannot avoid from. War is something that you cannot hide from. War is something that you cannot be saved from. So, if you want to start a war, be prepared to lose everything. \n\nSo, I'm done. I'm done talking about war. I'm done talking about winning or losing. I'm done talking about war or no war. I'm done talking about everything. Because, there's nothing more to say. There's nothing more to talk about. And, there's nothing more to write about. So, I'm done. I'm done writing. I'm done talking. I'm done. I'm done."

        "pred_story": "The prophecy was never meant to slay the dragon. The hero's blade missed the mark and the dragon's blood stained the hero's armor, rather than the floor.\n\n\"You are the chosen one,\" the prophetess had said. \"Slain the dragon and the darkness will fade.\"\n\nI was not the chosen one. I was just a farmer. The darkness had spread to my fields and eaten my crops. The dragon that ate my crops was not the dragon I had expected.\n\nI was in the fields when I heard a dragon roar. I didn't see it at first. It was behind a hill. I was the only one brave enough to face it. The farmer's wife said her husband had been slain by the dragon. The rest of the family was too afraid. When I ran into the field I could see why. The dragon was eating the crops. It was not the fierce beast of stories. It was a giant lizard. It was eating the crops as if they were corn on the cob.\n\nI ran to the hill. I saw the beast and I knew I had to act. I took out my sword and I swung it at the beast. But I missed the mark. The blade cut a line in its side and the beast stopped eating. It was not the beast it had seemed to be. It was not a lizard. I saw its face. It was not a face I had ever seen. It was a face that seemed to look at me like it understood me.\n\nThe blade had gone through its eye. The dragon was dead.\n\nI looked at the field. It was dead too.\n\nThe darkness had eaten the crops. I had killed the dragon.\n\nThe dragon had died and the darkness had consumed the field. The crops were gone and the field was empty.

The dragon had been a farmer. The darkness had been his field. I had killed the farmer and his field was destroyed.\n\nThe farmer had been a dragon.

The darkness had eaten the crops and the farmer had been killed.\n\nI looked at the seed and I knew. I could not plant it. It would bring no crops. It would bring death. I looked at the field and I knew. I had killed the dragon. I had destroyed the field. I looked at the darkness and I knew. It was still there. It had not been eaten by the dragon. I could see it. It was the void. It was nothing.\n\nI looked at the seed and I knew. It was the void. It was nothing. But it had been fertilized by the dragon's blood. It had grown and it was round. I looked at the field and I knew. I had eaten it. I had destroyed it. The dragon had eaten the crops and the field had been fertile.

His body would still ache. His ears still hurt from the deafening sound of the explosives, and his back still burned from being shot at. The memories of the day lingered in his mind, and the stench of blood lingered in his nostrils. After a long day, the old man knew he needed his rest, and if he couldn't sleep, at least he could have a drink to fill the void. He went to the bar and ordered a whiskey. The bartender knew him well, and the glass was already filled with the drink before the old man even paid for it. The bartender smiled as he gave the old man the glass. \"I heard you had a great day today,\" he said. The old man nodded as he took a sip of the drink, and it felt like a wave of relief washing over him. \"My son and his wife were injured, and I couldn't even do anything to help them,\" the bartender said. The old man looked at him and sympathized. He knew the pain of seeing loved ones hurt. He had lost his own son in battle years ago, and he remembered how much pain and grief he felt when he heard the news. \"I'm sorry, man,\" he said as he took another sip of the drink. \"I know how that feels.\" The bartender sighed as he nodded, and the two of them sat there in silence. The silence was filled with the sounds of the tavern, but they both knew they were thinking the same thing. They both knew that the day had been a close call, and they both knew that they had been lucky enough to escape the wrath of the raiders. The old man took another sip of the drink, and he knew that he would be able to sleep tonight. He could have called the shots, but he had decided not to. He was getting old, and he knew that his body could no longer handle the rigors of war. He had decided to let his son and his wife fight, and he had decided to stay behind and help the others prepare. He had been right, and they had won the battle. The raiders had been held back, and the old man was happy. He was happy because he knew that his son and his wife would be able to sleep tonight, and he knew that they would be able to have a chance to heal. He was happy because he knew that the town would be able to continue living in peace, and he knew that the people would be able to go about their lives without fear. He knew that the war was never ending, but he knew that he had helped to protect the people. He knew that the war was never ending, but he knew that they would be able to endure. The old man took another sip of the drink, and he looked around the tavern. He saw people celebrating, and he saw people mourning. He saw people who were still hurting, and he saw people who were still alive. He looked at the bartender and smiled. \"Thank you,\" he said. \"You're welcome,\" the bartender replied. The old man looked at him and nodded. \"Thank you for understanding,\" he said. The bartender smiled, and they both knew that they had been through something together. They both knew that they had fought in a battle, and they both knew that they had endured. The old man finished his drink and stood up, and he was ready to leave. \"I'll be back tomorrow,\" he said. The bartender nodded as the old man walked out the door. He walked down the hallway of the tavern, and he looked at the bartender as he left. The bartender looked at him, and he knew that he had been through something. The bartender knew that the old man had fought in a battle, and the bartender knew that he had endured. The bartender looked at him as he walked out the door, and the bartender was happy to have him as a customer. The bartender had been glad to see him walk through the door, and the bartender would be glad to see him walk back through it tomorrow. The old man walked down the street and turned a corner. He looked at the ground as he walked, and he didn't notice the figure standing next to him. \"Sir, please walk this way,\" the figure said. The old man stopped and looked at the figure. \"Where are you taking me?\" he said. \"To your car,\" the figure replied. The old man nodded, and the figure walked ahead of him. They walked to the car, and the old man opened the door. \"Put your bag in the car,\" the figure said. The old man nodded and picked up his bag. \"Do you mind if I ask why I need a car?\" he said. \"No,\" the figure replied. \"I don't mind.\" The old man placed his bag in the trunk of the car and closed the lid. \"Do you mind if I ask where I'm going?\" he said. \"No,\" the figure replied. \"I don't mind.\" The old man nodded and looked at the figure. \"Thank you for your help,\" he said. \"Thank you for choosing me,\" the figure replied. The old man nodded and looked at the figure. \"Do you mind if I ask what your name is?\" he said. \"No,\" the figure replied. \"I don't mind.\" The old man smiled as he looked at the figure. He had been glad to meet him, and he would be glad to see him again. \"My name is Arthur,\" he said. \"Arthur?\" the figure replied. The old man nodded and smiled. \"I like the name,\" the figure said. \"Thank you,\" Arthur replied. \"I like the name,\" the figure said again. Arthur looked at the figure and smiled. \"Do you want to ride in the car with me?\" he said. \"Yes,\" the figure replied. Arthur nodded and smiled as he went to the driver's side of the car. The figure walked to the passenger side and got in the car. \"Do you want a glass of water?\" Arthur asked. \"Yes,\" the figure replied. Arthur nodded and smiled as he poured the figure a glass of water. The figure nodded as he drank the water, and Arthur smiled as he looked at the figure. \"Do you want some food?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" the figure replied. Arthur smiled as he pulled into a restaurant. The two of them entered the restaurant, and Arthur asked the waiter to bring two plates of food. They were served their plates, and the two of them ate in silence. \"How long do we have to go?\" the figure asked. \"I'm not sure,\" Arthur replied. \"I don't mind.\" \"Okay,\" the figure said. \"I don't mind either.\" The two of them ate the rest of their meal and left the restaurant. \"I'm glad we had the chance to talk,\" Arthur said. \"Me too,\" the figure replied. Arthur smiled as he looked at the figure. \"Will I see you again?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" the figure replied. \"I will be here again tomorrow"

        "pred_story": "I'd never been one for sleep. In fact, sleep had always been one of those things that just didn't make any sense to me. What good was it, anyway? When you were already dead, and you weren't going to come back until the next day, might as well be awake then and know that you can't do anything.\n\nThere was also a bit of the survival instinct, though I never let anyone know that. The instinct to always be on alert, ready for any situation to strike. My parents had always been at odds with me over it. I'd been born a bit too early, and they'd been worried for a while that I wasn't going to make it. When I finally did, they had been ecstatic. My father had even named me after the moment when I was born.\n\nThat was a bit of an embarrassment for me, but I didn't let it show. My father had always been one to make bold statements that he would later regret. He'd also always been one to be a bit more on the wild side, and I didn't really get that from him. My mother had been a much more cautious person, one who always looked before she leaped. I got that from her, along with my sharp mind and instincts. My father always said that I inherited his wild side, but I think it was just something he wished he had.\n\nAnyway, my parents were the kind of people that would go to sleep at night and lock their doors. They would be sure that they'd done everything they could, and then they'd sleep knowing that they had done everything in their power to protect themselves and their property. They were the kind of people that wouldn't even wake up if someone broke in and were sitting in a chair right in front of them.\n\nI, on the other hand, was a night owl. I stayed up until the early hours of the morning and went to bed when the sun was rising. I always made sure to double check the doors and windows before closing them, and I made sure that they were locked and ready to be used. My parents always told me that I was being paranoid, but I know that this was the only way to stay safe.\n\nAnd besides, it was fun.\n\nTonight was no different. The house was quiet, save for a few creaks and groans from the old wooden floorboards. I went through my usual routine, checking the doors and windows, and then the basement. That had been where the last intruder had gotten in. He'd been a burglar, and the cops had caught him just after I'd gone to bed. I'd been the one that had caught him, too. I didn't go to sleep until the cops got there and took the intruder away. That had been about three days ago, and I was still sleeping by day and patrolling the house at night.\n\nTonight was one of those nights when I found something. The police had installed a security system a few months ago, and it always gave them an alert when I went through the doors. Tonight was no different. The security system gave off a loud noise when I opened the front door, but I knew it was just the system. I'd told the police that, but they didn't care.\n\nAs I walked through the front door and into the hallway, I heard it. The sound of a voice, calling out from the top of the stairs. I knew that voice. It belonged to the police officer that had been caught sleeping on the job when the last intruder had gotten away. It was the same voice that I heard when the officer had been caught, and I knew that he was here tonight.\n\n\"Hello?\" he called out. \"Is anyone here?\"\n\nI stood still for a moment, knowing that I had to get the officer out of the house as soon as possible. If he was in the house, then the intruder was still in the house. I couldn't let anything happen to him. I couldn't let him be caught again.\n\n\"Hello?\" the officer called out again. \"Is anyone here?\"\n\nI took a step towards the stairs, knowing that the officer was on the second floor. I wanted to call out to him, to tell him to stay away. But before I could do anything, a loud noise came from the front door.\n\nI turned and ran towards the door, knowing that it was the intruder. He had come to the front door, and he was trying to get in. I grabbed the door handle and waited.\n\nThe intruder tried the door again, this time harder. He had clearly lost his patience, and he was now going to try and break the door down. I was ready for him. I was always ready.\n\nI stood firm, knowing that the intruder was trying to break into the house. The door didn't budge, and he gave up and moved away. He was probably going to go around the back and try to sneak in that way. I would be waiting for him."

        "pred_story": "\"You should be a part of us, when your time comes.\"\n\nI looked over at my best friend, the one of the many mechanics I worked alongside for 12 years.\n\n\"Are you speaking for the Council?\"\n\nI had always been close with this particular mechanic. She was the first person I met on my first day as a part of this station. She was one of the first 12 mechanics to work on the station, and had been my guide and friend ever since.\n\n\"No,\" she said with a smile. \"I'm speaking for myself. And I want you to know that you will always be my friend. Just as you have always been.\"\n\nI smiled at her. \"I don't know about the future, but I like to think of our friendship as a sign that there is something to come.\" I gave her a wink. \"Besides, I think I'm going to find my own heaven down there on Earth. And I don't think I would need to come back up here.\"\n\nWe both laughed, as the rest of our colleagues walked over to us, including our manager, the first mechanic on the station. \"We're all going to miss you, you know.\"\n\nShe said, patting my shoulder. \"You've been a big part of this team, and you've been a great friend to everyone here.\" She looked at my friend. \"I know you two have been close since the beginning.\"\n\nWe both smiled, and the other mechanics also made their way over to us. My friend pulled out a small box from her pocket, and handed it to me. \"A little something I wanted you to have. As a keepsake, and a reminder of our friendship.\"\n\nI opened the box, and smiled at the small gold coin inside. It was a penny, minted in 2022. I smiled at the little smiley face on the front. \"This is great. I will treasure this, as you would.\" I hugged her. \"Thank you for being such a great friend.\"\n\nShe hugged me back. \"You mean the world to me. You've been an amazing person, and I am going to miss you a lot. You will have a place here on earth, as my friend.\"\n\nI looked at the rest of the team, and they all cheered for me. I smiled, then turned and left the station. I walked to the elevator, and pressed the button. I went to the lower deck of the station, then walked to the airlock and pushed the button. I stepped into the airlock, and pushed the button again.\n\nThe airlock sucked the air out of my lungs, and I felt my ears pop, then I pushed the final button. I was back in space. I laughed, then got my bearings. The sun was setting over the horizon. I looked over at my friend, who was holding my hand.\n\n\"You did it,\" she said, smiling at me.\n\nI smiled. \"I sure did.\" I looked at my companion. She was wearing a denim jacket, and a pair of jeans. A white t-shirt was underneath the jacket, and her bright blonde hair was tied back. She had a wide smile on her face, and her brown eyes sparkled in the fading light.\n\n\"It's beautiful, isn't it?\" she said.\n\nI nodded. \"It certainly is.\" I looked over at her, then smiled at her. \"I'm glad we did this. I think it's beautiful.\"\n\n\"I think it's wonderful,\" she said. \"And I think we did the right thing. We needed a break from the station, and we needed to see this world.\" She pointed at the horizon.\n\nI nodded, then looked over at her. \"I love you,\" I said.\n\nShe smiled. \"I love you too.\"\n\nWe both smiled, then I wrapped my arms around her waist, and pulled her close."

She opened the door, got out, then lifted up the girl from her seat. \"I'll take her inside and let you get your things from the car.\" The woman was looking into my eyes, as if she wanted to say something, but the girl was moving on her own now and dragging her mother along.\n\nI stepped out of the SUV, grabbed the bag from the back, and followed them inside. She put the girl down as soon as we stepped into the house, then took the bag from me and put it on the floor. \"How long will you be staying?\" I asked as I looked around, it was a decent enough house, but I could see there were signs of a recent fight. \"Thank you for letting us stay here, I'm sure she would have hated it if she was still alive.\"\n\nThe woman smiled at me, but it was a sad smile. \"She was a good person, she would want you two to be happy. I know she had her moments, but she was trying to do better.\" I nodded, but I was staring at the body of the woman lying on the floor. Her head was missing, but there were still droplets of blood and bits of her brain splattered around. \"Can you please tell your daughter what happened.

But I failed to do that, and now both of you are going to be hunted by people who think I killed her.\" She looked at me, then at the girl. \"She is going to be the one who gets to tell the truth about what happened. She will be the one who will have to keep you safe, who will have to keep you alive.\"\n\n\"You did the right thing to take her away from her mother,\" I said. \"She will have a better life with you, and you will be able to help her heal and move forward. That is what any good parent would do.\" The woman shook her head. \"If I had just stayed in the room, she would still be alive. I can still see her head when I close my eyes, and the pain from the shot makes it hard for me to think straight.\"\n\nI nodded. \"I understand how you feel. I feel the same way about your sister,\" I said. \"If she had died from the gunshot wounds I gave her, she would have been safe. But no, I had to take her out to the back and cut her head off, now she is a dead body, but she is still in my mind.\" I shook my head. \"No, I'm sure what you did was the right thing, and you did it for your daughter. She will be better off with you, and you are a better parent for taking her away from the monster.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said with her sad smile. \"I am glad you understand. But I know that we will have to be careful, and that we should stay together for now. We can't let her find us.\" She walked over to the girl and took her hand. \"We have to be careful. Can you understand that?\" The girl looked up at her mother, then at me, before she nodded. \"What are we going to do?\" I smiled. \"We will head to a safe house, where no one will be able to find us. Then we will come up with a plan to ensure that you and your daughter will be safe from the rest of the family.\" The woman looked at me. \"And what about you? Will you be able to protect yourself?\"\n\nI looked around the house. It was a decent enough place, but it was still a house. \"Yes, I will be able to protect myself. But I will be going to the police station and telling them the truth about your sister. I will tell them that she tried to kill you and your daughter, and that I shot her in the leg and she died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. They will believe me, because they will be able to see the blood on my hands, and they will be able to confirm my alibi.\" She smiled. \"Thank you, I will be able to finally rest. And I know my sister won't be able to hurt anyone else. I'm just glad that my daughter will be safe.\""

        "pred_story": "\u201cLet me go you dragon!\u201d the knight bellowed, trying to shake off the dragon\u2019s grip. He tried to kick at its claws and tail but they were unmovable. The dragon was nearly three times his size, so his efforts were futile.\n\nThe dragon huffed and pulled the knight in closer, its face mere inches from the knight\u2019s. It spoke in a low whisper, \u201cI wrote that letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not understand that, you were the one kidnapping the princess,\u201d the knight answered back.\n\nThe dragon shook its head, \u201cI was not the one kidnapping her. It was my sister and her husband, the kings cousin.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did she kidnap her, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause she was tired of life as a dragon. She was lonely and hated the life of solitude in her cave. She was tired of having to fight for food and she was tired of living with her husband.\u201d The dragon paused, \u201cThat is why we need your help.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you need my help.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause she has changed, she has become one of them. She no longer looks for prey, instead she goes hunting the villages of men. She has become a monster and is hated by her own kind. We want you to go into her lair and bring her back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can do that, she is a dragon.\u201d the knight said.\n\nThe dragon put it\u2019s head close to the knight\u2019s face and whispered again, \u201cWe need your help.\u201d The knight was unsure, he had gone into the depths of hell before and had fought against all manner of monsters.\n\n\u201cWhy should I help you?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause if she is not stopped she will kill all of your people and mine. She will kill them all and when she has done that she will turn her wrath towards my family. I would like to think that my family and I have a right to live without her wrath.\u201d The dragon paused, \u201cI thought your kingdom was at war with my kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was, but that war has long been over. The emperors army defeated all of the dragons and there was peace for many years. Although there are still some dragon around, they are few and far between. Many of them have been hunted down by men, and those that remain are now mostly solitary. They prefer to be alone, and we prefer that they stay that way.\u201d The knight was unsure, but he could not deny that the dragon was telling the truth. He had not seen many dragons in his life and he had always been told that they were evil. Perhaps he had been mislead.\n\nThe knight thought for a moment, he could not bring himself to hate the dragons, not after hearing what this one had to say. He had never considered that they could be misunderstood. \u201cI agree to go and help you.\u201d\n\nThe dragon smiled, \u201cI knew you would help me. I have written a letter asking for help and I have left it with the king.\u201d The knight noticed that the dragon was covered in scales. He had heard of dragons having scales but never seen them before. He stared at them for a moment, \u201cWhat are they made of, they look like a piece of metal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are,\u201d the dragon answered. \u201cThey are made from a metal known as dragonite. The only place where it can be found is in the kingdom. It is extremely hard to mine and that is why dragons have scales. Each scale is worth a king\u2019s ransom, and they protect us from predators.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to learn more about you dragons. I have been misled and I want to understand you.\u201d the knight said.\n\n\u201cYou can ask me anything you would like, I am happy to answer.\u201d The dragon paused, \u201cPerhaps I could take you to my cave, it is warm there and it is safe.\u201d\n\nThe knight agreed, he would like to see the dragon\u2019s cave. He had always been interested in seeing the home of creatures he had heard about but never seen. The knight looked at his horse and saw it\u2019s head in the sand. He did not like the look of it, he had hoped that his horse had been asleep and not dead. He quickly turned his horse around and headed back down the mountain. When he got back to the king\u2019s castle he was greeted by the king.\n\n\u201cDid you go and get the princess?\u201d the king asked.\n\n\u201cYes your majesty I did. But I could not bring her out. She has become a monster and is hated by all.\u201d the knight answered.\n\n\u201cBut you were able to talk to the dragon, that means it is still a dragon. It is not a monster, just a confused one. Perhaps if we help it, it will be a friendly dragon.\u201d The king answered. The knight had not thought of that. He had been so sure that the dragon was evil. He thought for a moment, \u201cYes, I was able to talk to the dragon and I believe it has the capacity to understand us. I will speak to the dragon and ask it to bring its sister back.\u201d\n\nThe king smiled, \u201cI know you will, your reputation is well deserved.\u201d The knight rode out of the castle and up to the dragon\u2019s cave. The dragon answered his call and they were soon deep in conversation. The knight and dragon talked for hours, and the dragon explained that its sister had been feeling lonely. It had been years since it had seen any other dragons, and it had been feeling lonely. But a few days ago it had heard that there was a princess in a nearby castle who was also lonely. She did not have many friends, and her family did not care about her. The dragon thought this was the perfect opportunity to help out another lonely dragon. It went to the castle and knocked on the door. A servant answered and asked what the dragon wanted. The dragon asked to see the princess and was told to wait in the courtyard. The princess came out and the dragon was immediately drawn to her. It was as if she was meant for the dragon. It wanted to take her back to its cave but the princess was scared of the dragon. It had told her it would not hurt her and that it would leave her with her family if she wanted. But the princess had told the dragon that she would like to stay with it.\n\nThe knight and dragon had talked for hours and the knight could not believe all of this. He had been so sure that the dragon was evil, but he was not. The dragon had been trying to do good and to help another lonely dragon. The knight thought for a moment and then he had an idea. \u201cI think we can help your sister, but I will need your help. She can come back to the castle and we can talk to her. I\u2019m sure that she did not mean to kill any people.\u201d\n\nThe dragon thought for a moment and then agreed. \u201cThat is a good idea, I will ask her and see if she agrees.\u201d The dragon went off and the knight waited. The knight was glad he had been able to talk to the dragon. It had changed his mind about dragons, he was now not convinced that all of them were evil. Perhaps there were some friendly ones out there.\n\nThe knight soon heard a rustling and looked up to see the dragon coming back. It was with the princess, and the princess looked sad. \u201cI cannot come with you,"

        "pred_story": "The rain pounded down on the ancient temple, a rhythmic drumbeat that echoed through the halls of stone. The wind howled through the arches, threatening to collapse the crumbling structure. Beyond the walls, the sound of battle raged. Clashing steel, screams, and snarls of beasts filled the air, growing louder by the second.\n\nIn the heart of the temple, a lone priestess stood at the focal point of the ritual, her hands raised to the heavens. Her long, white robes fluttered in the wind, as she chanted in a voice that wavered between pleading and commanding. Around her, the circle of followers pressed closer, their eyes wild with a mix of devotion and terror.\n\n\"We call upon you, great one!\" The priestess declared, her voice piercing through the din of war. \"Hear our prayers, and grant us your blessing!\"\n\nThe air thickened around her, heavy with anticipation. The followers leaned in, their faces set with a mix of hope and fear. The priestess closed her eyes, her head bowed in reverence. She could feel it, the presence of the deity, drawn by the ritual, sensing the power that coursed through the circle.\n\nThe sound of boots echoed through the halls, growing louder with each passing second. Shouts and screams from the followers grew more urgent, their voices rising in panic. The priestess opened her eyes, her gaze locked on the doorway, where the darkness was giving way to light. A group of warriors emerged, their armor battered, their faces etched with exhaustion and worry.\n\nThe priestess's grip on the ritual faltered, her mind racing with a desperate hope. The warriors rushed forward, their weapons at the ready, and in a moment of pure instinct, the priestess drew her own blade, the sacred steel glinting in the fading light.\n\n\"Stand aside, heroes!\" The priestess commanded, her voice firm, her hand steady. \"This is a holy ritual, and you will not disrupt it!\"\n\nThe lead warrior, a battle-hardened woman with a scarred cheek and a missing eye, halted in her tracks, her sword raised. She narrowed her gaze at the priestess, her expression unreadable. \"We mean no disrespect, priestess,\" she said, her voice rough but measured. \"But we cannot let you complete this ritual. The enemy is upon us, and we must hold the line.\"\n\nThe priestess shifted her weight, her grip on the blade tightening. She knew that if the warriors broke the circle, the ritual would fail. The deity would not be summoned, and the followers would be lost forever. \"The ritual is almost complete,\" she said, her voice steady, her eyes locked on the warrior. \"Grant me but a moment, and it shall be done.\"\n\nThe warrior lowered her sword, her expression softening. She glanced around at her companions, each one nodding in agreement. They knew that the priestess was not like the others, that she was driven by a singular purpose, one that transcended the petty squabbles of humanity.\n\nThe priestess let out a breath, her shoulders sagging with relief. She turned her gaze to the circle, where the followers pressed closer, their faces a mix of fear and anticipation. She raised her blade, the steel glinting in the fading light. \"Let us proceed,\" she said, her voice steady, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\nThe ritual continued, the followers and the priestess pressing closer, their voices rising in devotion. The warriors watched, their faces unreadable, their swords at the ready. The air grew thick with anticipation, the very fabric of reality bending to accommodate the ritual.\n\nIn the heart of the temple, the priestess felt it, the power of the deity coursing through her veins. The circle lit up, the followers glowing with an ethereal light. The priestess raised her hands, her voice rising in a final, desperate call. \"I call upon you, great one!\"\n\nThe world around her dissolved, the temple, the warriors, the followers, all vanishing in a burst of light. The priestess felt herself lifted up, borne on a tide of power, higher and higher, until she was one with the deity.\n\nWhen the light faded, the priestess stood alone, her blade still in hand, her face twisted in agony. The ritual was complete, the deity summoned. The priestess stumbled forward, her vision blurring, her heart pounding in her chest. In her mind, she felt the presence of the deity, its power coursing through her, but it was not the divine being she had expected.\n\nInstead, the priestess felt a cold, calculating intelligence, one that was ancient and malevolent, with a thirst for power and a disregard for life. The deity was a monster, one that had been imprisoned for millennia, and the priestess knew that she had unleashed a horror upon the world.\n\nShe fell to her knees, her head bowed in shame, her blade slipping from her grasp. The temple was quiet, the warriors and followers gone, but she knew that they would return. They would come for her, for the priestess who had unleashed the beast.\n\nThe deity's power surged through her, a voice echoing in her mind. \"You have freed me, mortal,\" it said. \"And now, you will be my vessel, my servant, my queen.\"\n\nThe priestess screamed, her mind torn apart by the sheer horror of it all. She knew that she had made a terrible mistake, one that would cost her everything, her soul, her sanity, her very life."

I\u2019m not going to stop you.\u201d\n\nThe old man smiled. \u201cOh, no, dear boy. I\u2019m not here to fight you. Although, I must say, I love the fire in your eyes. You have spirit, which I\u2019ve not seen in a long time.\u201d\n\nKaelin tightened his grip on his sword. \u201cWhat do you want? I\u2019m not going to talk to you long.\u201d\n\nThe old man smiled again and bowed. \u201cI know, which is why I\u2019m going to end your life with my bare hands. It\u2019s quicker, and I won\u2019t hurt your sword. It\u2019s a beautiful blade. Not many people can make a sword as finely as yours.\u201d\n\nThe old man took out a dagger from his pocket and moved closer to Kaelin. Kaelin\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI\u2019m not here to make friends, old man. I\u2019m here to kill you!\u201d\n\nThe old man laughed and stopped in front of Kaelin. \u201cDear boy, if I wanted you dead, you\u2019d be dead by now. My dagger is sharp, and it\u2019s been with me for many years. I only want to spare you the pain of a long and bloody fight. You deserve better than that.\u201d\n\nKaelin looked at the old man. He looked old, but the spark in his eyes hinted at something else. \u201cSo, what do you want?\u201d\n\nThe old man smiled and nodded. \u201cYou want to know what I want? The greatest pleasure in life is a battle. It\u2019s the only thing that keeps me alive. I want a battle.\u201d\n\nKaelin looked at the old man. He could see the desperation in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not making any sense. You\u2019ve said that you won\u2019t hurt me, that you won\u2019t kill me. If that\u2019s the case, what do you want?\u201d\n\nThe old man sighed and threw his dagger away. It landed in a flower pot near the old man\u2019s home. \u201cOh, you want to know what I want? You want to know what I want? I want to be bored again, dear boy. I want to be forgotten again. I want to be alone again.\u201d\n\nKaelin looked at the old man. He could see the sadness in his eyes. \u201cBut, you\u2019ve said that you don\u2019t want me to kill you. If that\u2019s the case, then what do you want?\u201d\n\nThe old man looked at Kaelin and smiled again. \u201cYou\u2019ve understood me, dear boy. I know that I\u2019m not going to kill you. I know that you\u2019re a good man. Which is why I want to make you feel better. Which is why I want to tell you a secret.\u201d\n\nKaelin leaned in and listened to the old man. \u201cI used to be a man like you, a warrior. I had a family and friends, but I lost them all in battle. Which is why I\u2019ve been alone for so long. Which is why I\u2019m so happy to see you and fight you. It\u2019s the only thing that brings me happiness.\u201d\n\nKaelin looked at the old man. He could see the sadness in his eyes, but also a glimmer of hope. \u201cYou\u2019re my age. I thought you\u2019d lost your edge, but you\u2019re still as strong as ever.\u201d\n\nThe old man smiled again. \u201cNo, dear boy, I haven\u2019t lost my edge. But I don\u2019t want to fight you. I want you to fight me. I want to feel the rush of battle. Which is why I want you to win.\u201d\n\nKaelin looked at the old man in shock. \u201cSo, you don\u2019t want me to kill you? You want me to defeat you.\u201d\n\nThe old man nodded and smiled. \u201cYes, dear boy, that\u2019s right. I want you to defeat me. Which is why I want to give you a head start.\u201d\n\nThe old man walked towards the old man\u2019s home and opened the door. Kaelin followed him inside and saw the old man walk towards a kitchen. Kaelin turned back to see what the old man was doing, and he saw a dagger. It was a sharp dagger, and it was pointed straight at him. Kaelin froze, knowing that the old man was about to attack. But instead of attacking, the old man threw the dagger at Kaelin.\n\nThe dagger went straight into the old man\u2019s chest. Kaelin watched as the old man fell to his knees, clutching his chest. \u201cNo, you\u2019ve taken away my purpose. You\u2019ve taken away my passion. I\u2019m old now. I\u2019m boring now.\u201d\n\nKaelin turned away from the old man and looked at his sword. He sheathed it and left the old man\u2019s home. He left behind a smile on the old man\u2019s face."

You're a hero, and heroes don't get to say goodbye.\"\n\n\"I'm still the same boy,\" I said, trying to hold back my emotions. \"I just chose a different path, that's all.\"\n\n\"Different path? What even is that supposed to mean?\" He laughed, and I saw a glimmer of the old him in his eyes.\n\n\"It means that I still want to be with you, to talk to you, to share my life with you. You're my best friend, my only real friend,\" I tried to fight back the tears.\n\n\"I don't want to be your friend anymore,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"I'm done. I'm tired. I'm sorry for everything I did. I know I hurt a lot of people, and I'm sorry for that.\"\n\n\"You're not apologizing for me,\" I said, and he laughed.\n\n\"No, I'm not. I'm apologizing for everything that happened. For the people I hurt, for the lives I ruined. I was a bad person, and I'm proud of that. I wouldn't have changed anything even if I could.\"\n\nI looked at him in shock. He had never been like that before. He was always the one who apologized, who tried to make things right. I looked into his eyes, and saw the same determination I had always seen there.\n\n\"You're still that person,\" I said. \"You're still the boy I used to know.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"I'm not. I'm not the same person anymore. And I'm okay with that. I'm happy, finally. Happy to be rid of all the guilt, all the shame, all the weight that I carried.\"\n\n\"I don't care that you've changed,\" I said, trying to hold back my tears. \"I still want to be your friend. I still want to be there for you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"I'm sorry that I'm not the same person I used to be. I'm sorry that I've hurt you. I'm sorry that I've done what I've done.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, falling to my knees beside his body. \"I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you've lost your life. I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you when you needed me. I'm sorry that I couldn't stop you.\"\n\nHe looked at me, and smiled. I saw tears in his eyes, and knew that I wasn't alone in this.\n\n\"We don't say goodbye to people,\" he said, his voice weak and barely above a whisper. \"We just say see you later.\"\n\n\"You can see me later,\" I said, trying to smile. \"I'll come visit you whenever you can.\"\n\n\"I would like that,\" he said, and closed his eyes. I knew that was it. I knew that he was gone.\n\n\"See you later, boy,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nI stood up, and looked at his body. I knew that I had to leave, that I had to let him go. But I couldn't move. I couldn't take my eyes off him. I couldn't leave him.\n\nHe was still smiling, his eyes closed, his body still. He was still there, still with me.\n\n\"I love you,\" I said, and saw him smile.\n\n\"I love you too,\" he said, and his eyes closed. His body went limp, and I knew that he was gone.\n\nI turned and ran. I didn't look back. I knew that I would never see him again. But I didn't care. I knew that he was okay, that he had finally found peace. And that was all that mattered."

It flickered like a dying ember, the air around it seeming to blur and ripple with a heat that would have melted plastic. \n\nThe dark, imposing shape of a man sat opposite, with a sharp jawline and the eyes of a pit bull. He'd been out of the job for six years, but nothing much had changed. He still came in here every Tuesday. He still had the same suit, the same tie, and the same blank expression. The kind that screamed 'I don't care about you, or anything you have to say'.\n\n\"Is that a fact?\" The man replied. \n\nThe voice snorted, exhaling a slow plume of smoke that hung in the air for a moment before dissipating. \"You think the law's going to care? You think your precious Judge Thompson is going to give a shit?\" The man looked up, his face like chiseled granite as he leaned forward. \"I've got proof.\" \n\nThe cigarette disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared. \"We both know that means nothing.\" \n\nThe man's face was impassive. \"I've got witnesses. I've got video.\"\n\nThe voice chuckled. A low, gravelly sound that seemed to vibrate through the table. \"You're going to have to do better than that. Do you think I've never dealt with a rat like you? Think I don't know how these things work?\"\n\nThe man's face didn't change. \"I've got everything. Everything.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" The voice leaned back in his seat, the metal of the chair squeaking as the weight shifted onto it. \"Do you know what I have? I've got a man on the inside at the DA's office. I've got the cops in my pocket. Do you think your little video's going to mean anything against me?\"\n\nThe man didn't say anything. He didn't need to.\n\nThe voice snorted. \"You think you're scared? You think you're intimidated?\" The cigarette reappeared in his hand, the ember flaring as he spoke. \"You've got nothing. You're nothing. A nobody. And I know it. You know it. And everyone else knows it too.\"\n\nThe man's face still hadn't changed. He hadn't moved, hadn't reacted. He just sat there. \n\nThe voice laughed. A cold, mirthless sound. \"You're not going to make a move. You're not going to try and leave. Because you know that's pointless. Because you know you've lost. You've lost from the moment you walked in this door.\" He stubbed out the cigarette. The ember died, the room went quiet, and the man spoke. \n\n\"I don't care if you win.\""

Her delicate body wore that famous red dress she was so fond of, and her bright eyes sparkled with delight.\n\nThe scene was set for a grand ball, the best of society had gathered for the night and the music was playing. Everyone was dancing, and there she was, standing alone and laughing at me.\n\nI couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe that I'd been denied the chance to dance with her. To be seen with her. To take her into my arms and whisper sweet nothings in her ear.\n\nI thought I was the center of the room. I thought I was the one everyone wanted. But it was all just a joke. She was the one everyone wanted, and I was just the fool.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I whispered, unable to meet her eyes.\n\nShe turned, a look of disgust on her face. \"Sorry for what?\" she mocked. \"Sorry for wasting my time?\"\n\nThe music stopped, and the ballroom fell silent. I looked at her, searching for an answer. Why would she even want to be here with me? Why would she even want to dance with me?\n\n\"I thought you liked me.\" I stuttered, unable to find the words. I couldn't believe what I was saying. How could I have thought that? How could I have been so blind?\n\n\"You're delusional. I've never even said hello to you before. And you're delusional to think I would want to dance with you.\"\n\nThe silence was deafening, and I could feel my heart beating in my chest. She was right, of course. I had thought of her before, but only as a fantasy. A fleeting thought. Not something I would ever dare to say aloud.\n\n\"You look like a lost puppy.\" She laughed, and the sound sent a wave of embarrassment through me.\n\n\"I-\" I tried to say something, but she cut me off.\n\n\"Oh, stop. Save it. I don't have time for this.\"\n\nShe turned to leave, but I caught her arm. \"Wait. I want to explain.\"\n\n\"Explain?\" she laughed again. \"You can't even explain why you thought I wanted to dance with you. I don't have time for this foolishness.\"\n\nI wanted to let go of her arm, to give up, but my fingers tightened. I couldn't let her go. Not like this.\n\nI couldn't let her walk away. Not yet.\n\n\"Please,\" I begged. \"Just listen to me.\"\n\n\"Fine.\" She let out a sigh. \"I'll give you a minute. Then, I'm leaving.\"\n\nShe turned and looked at me, and I saw the annoyance written all over her face.\n\n\"Say something,\" she urged. \"Anything. I want to hear it.\"\n\nI opened my mouth, but nothing came out. I couldn't think of what to say. I couldn't think of why I had thought this would work.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said again, and she laughed.\n\n\"You're sorry,\" she mocked. \"What good is that?\"\n\nI felt a surge of anger at her words, but I pushed it down. I couldn't let myself get angry. Not now.\n\nI looked at her, trying to find the words, but they wouldn't come.\n\n\"What do you want me to say?\" I asked, trying to be reasonable.\n\n\"I don't know. Maybe that you're crazy? Maybe that you're delusional? Maybe that you're blind?\"\n\nShe laughed, and I felt a twinge of frustration. I didn't want to laugh with her. I wanted to be serious.\n\n\"I'm just...\" I started, but she cut me off.\n\n\"Stop.\" She covered my mouth. \"Don't say anything else. Just say it, and we're done.\"\n\nI shook my head, unable to speak.\n\n\"Goodbye,\" she said, and left.\n\nI watched her go, my heart pounding in my chest. I didn't know what to say. I didn't know what to do.\n\nI didn't know if I'd ever see her again. I didn't know if I'd ever be able to explain what had happened.\n\nAll I knew was that I wanted to go to her. I wanted to tell her how I felt. I wanted to make her mine.\n\nBut she didn't want me. I knew that now.\n\nAnd all I could do was watch her walk away."

I'd rather not have any... accidents.\"\n\n\"Accidents?\" I asked, feigning concern. \"What kind of accidents?\"\n\nMy dad walked into the bathroom and leaned on the counter opposite the sink. \"You know, accidents. Like... burning down the house because of a possessed kid in the house. We should be careful.\"\n\n\"Of course, you're right,\" I said, finally turning to face him. \"We should get the pastor over here, you're right.\"\n\nMy mom walked into the bathroom with a cup of fried chicken in her hand, her face still set in that tired, exasperated look she's had since I was a kid. \"I'm going to put this chicken in the oven, so let's get the pastor over here and get this over with.\"\n\n\"Sounds like a plan, mom,\" I said, not even cracking a smile.\n\nWe all knew it was just a prank. My parents and I were all the same, I was just messing with them, they were messing with me, it was like some kind of twisted family game.\n\nWe called the pastor over and she gave us a whole monologue about demons and the devil, I don't know, I tuned out a bit. She was a nice enough woman, she had a weird accent and her name was something like \"Rebecca,\" I don't know.\n\nAfter that, she asked me a few questions about my recent behavior and some weird stuff that I didn't even remember doing. She said that I had been acting like a demon lately and that I needed to be exorcised. I said that I was fine and that I didn't feel possessed.\n\nShe asked me to make a cross with my hands, which I had to fake. I didn't know if I was going to be able to keep this up for long. I felt a little bad at messing with my parents like this.\n\nShe grabbed my hands and started praying over them, reciting some biblical verse, and I just let her. After a few minutes, she looked at me and I started to laugh.\n\n\"You're not possessed!\" she shouted. \"You're just acting like an idiot.\"\n\nI laughed so hard I had to hold onto the counter. \"Yeah, that's it,\" I said. \"Just acting like an idiot.\"\n\nMy parents were watching us from the other side of the bathroom, they looked kind of embarrassed. My mom walked over and stood by my side, placing a hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"My baby's not possessed,\" she said, her voice shaking. \"That's right.\"\n\nRebecca looked at my parents, then back at me. \"You know,\" she said, \"I think I was right. You are possessed.\"\n\nI didn't even have to fake a laugh this time, I just laughed so hard I almost fell over. \"Oh my god, what?\" I said, still laughing. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nRebecca looked at me with a strange, almost unhinged look. \"I'm talking about your demon. It's inside you. I can feel it.\"\n\nI felt a little concerned that she had taken this so seriously, but then my parents were laughing too. My dad was holding his stomach like he was going to pass out, my mom was trying to catch her breath.\n\n\"Mom, dad, we can't do this,\" I said, my voice shaking. \"This isn't funny anymore.\"\n\nMy mom finally stopped laughing and looked at me, tears in her eyes. \"What do you mean, sweetie? It's not that funny. Maybe you really are possessed.\"\n\n\"I'm just messing with you,\" I said. \"I'm sorry, I won't do it again.\"\n\nI think it was then that I heard Rebecca's voice behind me, a low, menacing voice.\n\n\"And what makes you so sure that I'm not the one messing with you?\" she asked.\n\nI turned around slowly, I didn't want to do anything that would provoke her, but I had to know.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" I said, but she just shook her head and pointed to my hands.\n\nThey were already in flames, they were burning faster than anything I could have imagined. I couldn't feel the pain, but I could see the flames engulfing my fingers.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" I asked.\n\nShe just smiled. \"You should know,\" she said. \"You cursed me.\"\n\nI don't remember the rest of that night, but I know that the fire spread to the rest of my body, and then to my parents. They died in the fire, along with Rebecca.\n\nI don't know if I was possessed or not. I didn't feel like I was. Maybe I was. Maybe I was just pretending to be and Rebecca was the real demon. Maybe I was the demon and she was just a human.\n\nI don't know.\n\nI just know that I'm alone now, and that I'm the last one standing.\n\nAnd I'm still burning.\n\nI can't stop burning."

The human, as is custom, will not refuse, and will be wed to all 15 of the princesses at once.\n\nThe galactic princesses, being 15 of the most beautiful people in the galaxy, with hair that flows like the stars and eyes as blue as the brightest stars, decided that the greatest person in the galaxy should have a name worthy of the occasion. The name was not decided by the princesses themselves, but by their parents, the leaders of the United Nations of Earth and the 47 other planets in the local galaxy and the 47 other galaxies. The name, as was the tradition, was decided by the parents and the parents decided that the name should be Earthling. It was simple, yet elegant, and had the connotation of being the greatest person in all the galaxies.\n\nThe wedding ceremony was a grand affair. 15 large floating platforms, made of a material known as Galactic Plasticine, were positioned around a grand rotating stage. The stage, which was the size of a football field, had a large altar at its center. At the center of the altar stood the 15 princesses, with their parents, the leaders of the United Nations of Earth and the 47 other planets in the local galaxy and the 47 other galaxies, in front of them.\n\nThe wedding ceremony began with the leader of the United Nations of Earth and the 47 other planets in the local galaxy and the 47 other galaxies, clearing his throat. \"Ladies and gentlemen, humans and galactic beings, please raise your hands to the heavens and shout Hail Earthling!\" The crowd of people from all over the galaxy and the 47 other galaxies raised their hands and shouted Hail Earthling!\n\nThe leader of the United Nations of Earth and the 47 other planets in the local galaxy and the 47 other galaxies turned to the human, Earthling. \"Earthling, the greatest person in all the galaxies, it is our pleasure to ask you to take on the greatest responsibility of all time. Will you marry all 15 of our beautiful daughters?\"\n\nThe human, Earthling, looked like he was in shock, unable to speak. The leader of the United Nations of Earth and the 47 other planets in the local galaxy and the 47 other galaxies looked at the human with a confused expression. \"Earthling, is it yes or no?\"\n\nThe human finally managed to speak, his voice shaking. \"Y-Yes! H-How am I supposed to marry all of them?\"\n\nThe leader of the United Nations of Earth and the 47 other planets in the local galaxy and the 47 other galaxies looked at the human with a disappointed expression. \"Earthling, you have failed to answer the question correctly. The tradition requires that you say I do to all 15 princesses at once.\"\n\nThe human looked at the 15 princesses. \"I-If I have to marry all 15 of you, then I suppose I will marry all of you.\"\n\nThe leader of the United Nations of Earth and the 47 other planets in the local galaxy and the 47 other galaxies looked at the human with a pleased expression. \"Earthling, the greatest person in all the galaxies, you have answered correctly. Let us proceed with the wedding ceremony.\"\n\nThe leader of the United Nations of Earth and the 47 other planets in the local galaxy and the 47 other galaxies turned to the human. \"Earthling, will you marry all 15 of our beautiful daughters?\"\n\nThe human, Earthling, looked at the 15 princesses with a confused expression. \"I-If I have to marry all 15 of you, then I suppose I will marry all of you.\"\n\nThe leader of the United Nations of Earth and the 47 other planets in the local galaxy and the 47 other galaxies looked at the human with a pleased expression. \"Earthling, the greatest person in all the galaxies, you have answered correctly.

Do you think you can tell me about that?\" I asked my grandfather who was lying in his bed and staring at the ceiling. He has been silent for the last 30 years, since the stroke that took away his ability to talk.\n\nMy grandfather didn't move and looked at me with that blank face. I knew that his eyes showed no signs of life, but the way he stared at me was different. I could see the determination in his eyes, a determination that I had never seen before.\n\n\"I can sense that you are really determined to find out. You have been so focused, I admire your dedication and commitment to getting to the bottom of it. You really care about what I have been hiding, and you will do whatever it takes to get to it, right?\" My grandfather spoke again, his voice was deeper than I had imagined. He was more energetic than I had thought he was too. I didn't know if he was always like this, but I was glad to see him finally speak again, even if it was 30 years after his stroke.\n\n\"Yes, I do. I want to help you, I want to see you happy again. I don't know if I can do it, but I want to try.\" I replied, trying to hold back the tears. I didn't want him to see me crying, I wanted him to know that I was happy to finally have him back.\n\n\"Good, you have that fire within you, you just need to focus it. You need to find your heart, find your soul. It isn't that you don't know where it is, you just need to dig it out. You can do it, you are strong enough, but you need to be braver than you think you can be.\" My grandfather advised me, his voice still strong, yet weak at the same time. I could see him trying to be brave, but still struggling to find his strength.\n\n\"I want to, I want to show you that I can do it. I just need to be brave.\" I replied, feeling his warmth. I was glad that he could feel the fire that burned within me too. I knew that I could do this, but I didn't know how, I just needed to focus on him.\n\n\"Good, let's get started.\" My grandfather repeated, his voice still strong. I knew that he could sense my fear, but I didn't want to let it hold me back. I wanted to do this, I wanted to help him.\n\n\"Grandpa, I want to do this for you. I want to see you smile again, I want to make you happy. If this means giving up my own life, then I will do it.\" I said, feeling the fear that had held me back. But he just smiled at me, a smile that only appeared every now and then.\n\n\"Come on then, let's get started. We have a lot to do. You can do it, I know you can.\""

        "pred_story": "It all started when I woke up in a foreign place. My ship, the Pheonix, had somehow traveled light years into the future. As I came to, I saw the people around me. They wore strange clothes and strange armor. We had advanced technology, it looked like.\n\nMy brain tried to process the fact that I was on a new planet. A place where humanity had advanced by leaps and bounds. I looked around, but everyone ignored me. They were all talking about something, and I couldn\u2019t understand them.\n\nSuddenly, a woman walked over to me. She had short, dark hair and piercing blue eyes. Her suit was sleek and she wore a badge with her face on it. It read, \u201cCommander Emily.\u201d\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if this was a shock. We\u2019ll need to get you to a debriefing room and start asking questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in space?\u201d I asked, struggling to remember the last thing I did before I was asleep. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how this happened.\u201d\n\nCommander Emily laughed. \u201cI know how it happened. We had to do some repairs on your ship.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepairs? Wait, why do you have my ship?\u201d\n\nCommander Emily sighed and rubbed her temples. \u201cWe\u2019re in a rush here. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nI followed Commander Emily to a sleek white room. It was filled with technology I didn\u2019t understand. There was a large metal chair in the center of the room with a person sitting in it.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d Commander Emily said, as she turned to the person in the chair. \u201cDr. Kim, this is a traveler from Earth.\u201d\n\nThe person in the chair was a man with glasses and a lab coat. \u201cGreetings,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me ask you, traveler. Where are you from?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, from my ship. The Pheonix.\u201d I answered.\n\nDr. Kim nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s correct. We did identify your ship and the time it had been launched. But how did you end up here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really sure,\u201d I said. \u201cI woke up and everyone was speaking a different language. I remember getting into my ship and flying off Earth. But I don\u2019t know anything after that.\u201d\n\nDr. Kim sighed and rubbed his temples. \u201cThis isn\u2019t looking good. Do you have a name?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do. It\u2019s,\u201d I said, trying to think. \u201cJohn. But I thought I was on a different ship.\u201d\n\nCommander Emily chuckled. \u201cYou were. But that\u2019s not your ship over there. That\u2019s your ship from 200 years ago.\u201d\n\nI turned to look. There was my old ship sitting in a corner of the room.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? That\u2019s the Pheonix. It\u2019s my ship. I remember flying it.\u201d\n\nDr. Kim held up his hand and waved it. \u201cI see. So your memories are real. We\u2019ll need to run some tests and see if we can figure out what happened.\u201d\n\nI walked over to my ship and reached out to touch it. It felt different. It was covered in a strange material that seemed to shimmer.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Commander Emily asked.\n\nI looked at her. \u201cI want to see if I can get into my ship.\u201d\n\nCommander Emily laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re not even on the same planet. You can\u2019t get into your ship.\u201d\n\nI scoffed. \u201cWhat do you mean? I can get into my ship.\u201d\n\nI ran into my ship and climbed the stairs. I reached the console and touched it. It lit up and I could hear the familiar voice of the AI. \u201cWelcome, Captain.\u201d\n\nI sat down and the AI asked me, \u201cWhat are you doing? Why are you on a foreign planet?\u201d\n\nI smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m glad to be back.\u201d\n\nThe AI beeped. \u201cBeep. Please stand by. I\u2019m going to check your systems.\u201d\n\nCommander Emily walked up to my ship. \u201cCaptain, what are you doing?\u201d\n\nI sat back in my seat and watched the AI work. It was still my ship and it felt like I was home. I ignored Commander Emily and got back to my usual routine.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter where I was, I was still Captain of the Pheonix."

The door slams shut behind me, letting me take a deep breath as I walk through the castle corridors.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" the herald calls from down the hallway. \"Wait.\" I stop, hand on the handle of my sword. \"Wait for what?\" I ask. He hurries to me, \"The... the captain of the guard wishes a word with you.\"\n\nI sigh, \"Tell him I'll speak with him later, but first I must go and clean up the mess he caused.\" I hear the sound of his feet scuffling, then his voice says, \"Yes, Your Majesty.\" He's walking away.\n\nI turn and hurry back to the throne room. When I enter, I see a dark spot near the back of the room. It looks like blood, and I've never been a fan of blood. I sheath my sword and draw my dagger. I can hear the captain and his men being held back by the knights I had called.\n\nI creep deeper into the room, trying to stay quiet, but the floor beneath my feet gives a slight creak. I freeze, and listen. My foot has been stepped on before, and it didn't go well.\n\n\"Where are they?\" I hear the captain call. The guards laugh, \"He can't see where they are,\" one says. I hear the sound of an arrow being drawn back and released. I drop to the ground, avoiding it as it slices through the air. I raise my dagger, and quickly plunge it into the man that had shot it. I roll to the side, avoiding his dead body as I spring to my feet.\n\nI hear footsteps running from the room, and I smile. I draw my sword and walk to the edge of the room, sheathing it as I approach the open window. I pull it open, and peer over the edge. I watch as the men run for the castle gates, not daring to look back.\n\nI close the window, but not before I hear a voice call out. \"How did you do that?\" The captain's voice says. I smile as I turn to him. \"I'm blind, but not stupid,\" I say. \"And now, I've been stabbed.\" I turn and walk back towards the door.\n\n\"Wait!\" He calls. I stop in my tracks, and raise my dagger. \"I swear, I was an honourable man, until I met you.\" He says. I lower my dagger, and sheathe it once more. \"I know you think me blind, but I'm not.\" He smiles, \"Oh, I believe you. That's why I took you out.\" I lower my guard, \"Then why are you still alive?\" He laughs. \"Because you're not the only one with tricks. And now, I must leave.\" I hear the sound of a sword being drawn.\n\n\"You can't leave me here!\" One of the guards calls out. \"Take one of the guards!\" He says. I hear the sounds of a fight, then the guard falls silent. The captain drops his guard and falls to the ground, \"Good luck, Your Majesty.\" He says. I hear the sound of the captain's men running from the room, then the castle.\n\nI turn to my guards. \"Clean this up, then go and get the knights ready. We may have an invasion on our hands.\""

It was like they were letting their guard down, and they were starting to act like the rest of us did. They would complain about the work, and they would act like they didn't care about anything.\n\nI wasn't sure if it was the result of their age, or if it was the fact that they had been doing this job for so long. But whatever it was, I knew that it needed to be addressed. So I had started to gather the others and talk about this hero.\n\n\"Look,\" I said, as I gestured to the hero's sleeping form. \"This is the hero, and it is pretty clear that they are not doing their job. I mean, have you seen them lately?\"\n\nI looked at the others, and they all nodded in agreement.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Steve. \"They have been taking it easy. They don't care about the work, and they don't care about anyone else.\"\n\n\"And it's not just their work ethic,\" said Sarah. \"It's their personality. They used to be caring, and now they are just so apathetic.\"\n\nI looked at the others, and I could see that we all agreed. We all knew that something needed to be done, and we knew that it was better to address this before anything worse happened.\n\n\"But what can we do?\" asked Michael. \"I mean, they are the hero. They have a reputation to uphold, and they have to do the job.\"\n\nI sighed, knowing that Michael had a point. \"I know,\" I said. \"But I think that is exactly the problem. They think that they can just do the job without putting any effort into it, and they think that their reputation will be fine even if they slack off. But that's not true. We all know that they have been slacking off, and we all know that they are not doing the job that they should be doing. So we have to address this problem.\"\n\nI could see that I had gotten the others thinking. I could see that they were considering my words, and I knew that I had started to win them over. And that was all that I needed. \"So what do you say,\" I asked, looking at the others. \"Are you with me?\"\n\nThe others nodded, and I knew that we all agreed. We would have to address this problem before it was too late, and before the hero did any more damage to their reputation."

You are a man of your word.\" The fey queen smiled, her teeth gleaming with an otherworldly radiance. \"I will send for your mother immediately.\"\n\n\"Good, when do we start?\" I asked, bouncing up and down.\n\nThe fey queen's smile faltered, and she looked at me with her ancient, alien eyes. \"You misunderstand, mortal. I spoke of your mother's health, not your own. I can restore your mother to health and vitality, but it comes with a price.\"\n\nI blinked. \"How much?\" I asked, reaching into my pocket and pulling out a handful of coins.\n\n\"Ah,\" the fey queen said. \"I think you misunderstand. This is not a transactional arrangement. When I say your firstborn, I mean your firstborn child, not your firstborn coin.\"\n\nI blinked again, feeling a wave of confusion wash over me. \"What do you mean?\" I asked.\n\nThe fey queen sighed. \"In exchange for your mother's health, you will give me your firstborn child, when it comes of age. This is how our bargain shall be fulfilled.\"\n\nI felt a wave of fear spike up through me, but it was quickly replaced by indignation. \"That's a terrible price!\" I exclaimed. \"I won't do it.\"\n\nThe fey queen leaned forward, her eyes glinting in the dim light of the palace. \"Oh, but you will, mortal,\" she hissed. \"You will do exactly as I say. You will come to me when your child comes of age, and you will bring it to me. Do you understand?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No,\" I said. \"I don't understand why you would ask such a terrible thing of me. My child is innocent. They've done nothing wrong to deserve your cruelty.\"\n\nThe fey queen smiled again, her teeth glinting in the dim light. \"Ah,\" she said. \"You are not as naive as you seem, mortal. You understand the nature of my bargain, and you will fulfill it.\"\n\nI swallowed hard, trying to keep my cool. \"No,\" I repeated. \"I won't do it.\"\n\nThe fey queen laughed, a low, throaty sound. \"Oh, yes you will,\" she said. \"You will come to me when your child is old enough. You will bring it to me, and you will leave it with me. Do you understand?\"\n\nI felt a wave of fear spike up through me again, and I knew I was in trouble. \"Yes,\" I muttered.\n\n\"Good,\" the fey queen said. She waved a hand, and a soft glow emanated from her fingers, enveloping my mother.\n\nMy mother sat up, stretching her arms and yawning. \"What happened?\" she asked.\n\n\"You were dead,\" I said. \"The fey queen brought you back.\"\n\nMy mother smiled, and I felt a wave of relief wash over me. \"Ah,\" she said. \"Good. Thank you, fey queen.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, feeling a wave of anger spike up through me. \"Thank you, fey queen,\" I muttered, glaring at her.\n\nThe fey queen smiled again, and a soft, white glow emanated from her fingers. \"You are welcome, mortal,\" she said. \"Now, if you will excuse me, I have some business to attend to.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I said, trying to sound casual despite the turmoil in my heart. \"I'll be here for a while, talking to my mom.\"\n\nThe fey queen smiled and nodded. \"I will leave you to it, mortal,\" she said. \"I will send for you when the time comes.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I muttered, watching as the fey queen vanished into a puff of smoke.\n\n\"What did she say?\" my mother asked, looking at me with a confused expression.\n\n\"She said we have to leave you with her when you turn 18,\" I lied.\n\nMy mother frowned, and her expression darkened. \"I thought this was a straightforward bargain,\" she muttered.\n\n\"It is,\" I said. \"I just had to explain it to you.\"\n\nMy mother nodded, and then we sat in silence for a while. \"Thank you for helping me,\" she said. \"I owe you one.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"You don't.\"\n\nMy mother smiled, and then we talked for a while, discussing everything and nothing.\n\nWhen we finally finished talking, my mother stood up, yawning. \"I'm tired,\" she said. \"I think I'm going to go to bed.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a wave of sadness wash over me. \"Goodnight,\" I said.\n\n\"Goodnight,\" my mother replied. \"Thank you again.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, shaking my head. \"Goodnight.\"\n\nMy mother smiled and patted me on the shoulder, and then she walked out of the room, leaving me alone in the silence."

The cookie she was holding in her hand started to shake, and she put it down.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked, trying to sound confident. \"You want to know about our... our... oh, I don't know, I mean, we do have a lot of magic, but it's not like that.\"\n\nThe lead alien, who was named Bob, looked at her curiously. \"There is a reason that humanity has not developed interstellar travel,\" he explained. \"And that reason is magic.

But it's a small price to pay for understanding it.\"\n\n\"This is, uh, very interesting,\" Jane said, trying to hide her panic.\n\n\"I know, right?\" Bob said, clapping his hands. \"I mean, it's not like you guys have a magic that you use. Like, no offense, but you've never built anything that's magical. You've never done anything magical. You've never created anything magical. Like... you know. A tree. A cat.

You can even take a pill for those.\"\n\n\"I think that's enough for today,\" Jane said, turning to leave. \"If you want to learn more, we'll talk next week.\"\n\nThe two aliens nodded in unison and then stared at the plate of cookies. One of the cookies started to quiver and shake, and suddenly it exploded into a thousand pieces.

        "pred_story": "I looked down at the path before me. The forest floor was a mix of fallen leaves and the occasional fern or flower. The moss was thick and green. I wasn't sure why they put this much moss in the forest, it just seemed like a waste. But the moss was my only concern for now. I had heard a baby crying, but I had no idea why.\n\nAs I approached the source of the crying I could feel the air grow colder. It felt like someone had drawn a cold breeze across the back of my neck, but I didn't feel any wind. \"Who are you?\" I demanded. \"Why are you crying?\"\n\nI stepped deeper into the cave. The air was thick and heavy, but it was still cold. \"Hey.\" I repeated, but I knew no one would answer.\n\nAs I moved deeper into the cave I could hear the baby cry louder. I had never heard a baby cry like this before. It was different than any other baby I had heard, but I couldn't quite place the difference.\n\nI looked up and saw a pair of eyes staring down at me. The eyes were a bright green and looked very old. I jumped back, but the eyes did not move.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I demanded.\n\nThe baby cried louder. \"Leave now.\" The voice was a deep voice, but the words were slurred and thick.\n\n\"What do you want?\" I asked, but the baby just continued crying. \"Why are you crying?\"\n\nThe eyes looked at me. \"This is my place.\" The voice was deep. \"Go back.\"\n\n\"I'm just here to talk.\" I said, but the baby just cried louder. \"I need to know, but I need to know why you are crying. You're very old.\"\n\nThe eyes stared down at me, but didn't answer.\n\n\"I have to help this baby.\"\n\n\"You need to leave.\" The voice demanded, but I stood my ground.\n\n\"I need to help the baby, so I need to know why you are crying.\" I said, but the baby just cried louder.\n\n\"Please. We all heard you.\"\n\nI looked around, but I was alone in the cave. I looked up again at the eyes. \"We all heard what?\" I asked, but they didn't answer.\n\n\"Look, let's talk about you first. You can tell me why you are crying, then I'll leave.\"\n\nThe baby just cried louder.\n\n\"I need to know what's wrong, so you need to tell me.\" I said, but the baby just cried louder.\n\nI walked closer to the light. I couldn't see anything. \"Look, I understand you are scared.\" I said, \"but I need to help this baby, so you need to talk to me.\"\n\nThe eyes looked at me and the baby cried. \"I don't want to talk.\" The voice was deep, but it was slurred and thick. \"I want to sleep.\"\n\nThe baby cried louder. \"I need to rest, so let me rest.\" The voice demanded.\n\n\"But I need to know what's wrong.\"\n\nThe baby cried louder. \"I need to be left alone.\"\n\n\"You need to talk to me.\" I said. \"But you aren't talking to me.\"\n\nI sighed and turned to leave. \"I'll be back later.\"\n\nI didn't hear them cry out, but I stopped before I left. I turned around and looked at the eyes. \"I'll be back.\" I repeated, then I left the cave.\n\nI didn't know what had happened, but I would find out tomorrow.\n\nI left the cave and continued my walk. The trees were tall and dense and blocked most of the sunlight. I didn't know why they called it a forest, because the trees blocked almost all of the sunlight.\n\nI walked for what felt like hours, but I knew I had only been walking for twenty minutes. I had been walking for years, but this was my first time in this forest.\n\nI stopped and looked up. The sunlight was gone. The sky was a dark gray. I could feel the ground shake, but I couldn't see any trees moving. I froze and listened to the sounds around me. But the only sounds were the wind.\n\nThe forest was quiet.\n\nI looked down at the ground before me and saw a hand. I looked up to see eyes staring at me. I screamed.\n\n\"Oh, you're back.\" A deep voice said. \"Why did you come back?\" The voice was slurred and thick.\n\nI screamed again. \"You scared me.\" I said. \"I won't leave again.\"\n\n\"I need to talk to you.\" The deep voice said. \"I've been waiting for you.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'm here.\" I said. I was still shaking, but I knew I had to listen to them. \"Please, you can tell me what's wrong.\" I said.\n\nThey just stared at me. \"I don't know what to do.\" They said. \"My baby is crying. I need to talk to you.\"\n\n\"You need to talk to me.\" I repeated.\n\nThey looked at me. \"I don't know what to say.\" They said. \"I don't know what to do.\"\n\n\"Is the baby okay?\" I asked. \"It wasn't the baby when you first cried.\" I said. \"Why is it crying now?\"\n\n\"It is okay.\" They said. \"It isn't crying now.\" They said. \"The baby was crying yesterday, but it stopped crying.\" They said. \"But it is crying again now. But the baby isn't crying. The forest is crying.\"\n\n\"The forest is crying?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes.\" They said. \"The baby and I are fine. But the forest is crying.\" They said. \"It was crying yesterday too. But we can't find out why.\" They said. \"So I need to ask you.\"\n\n\"What do you need to ask me?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why is the forest crying?\" They asked.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" I said. \"But I don't know.\" I said. \"But I can help you find out why.\"\n\n\"How?\" They asked.\n\nI looked up at the sky. The sky was dark, but I could see that the moon was out. \"I can use the moon.\" I said. \"I can walk around the forest and listen to the sky and listen to the ground.\" I said. \"I can find the source of the crying.\" I said. \"But it's dangerous, so you need to stay with the baby.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" They said. \"I will stay with the baby. Please, can you help us?\"\n\n\"Of course.\" I said. I walked outside of the cave and looked around. I looked up at the moon. It was full and bright, but it was hanging in a dark sky. I looked down at the ground and listened carefully. The forest was quiet, but I could hear a faint crying."

        "pred_story": "The studio lights hit my suit jacket, the camera panned, and I stepped forward with a smile. \"Hello, everyone, welcome to tonight\u2019s episode of *I Was There*!\" I said, holding up a hand for the audience to quiet. \"Today, we have a very special guest, the Prince of Darkness himself, Dracula.\" I said, turning my gaze to the guest chair where he sat, his tall frame towering over the normal-sized chair. He flashed his fangs at me, and the audience went wild. I smiled. \"Tonight, Dracula has a lot to tell us, and he\u2019s not just here to sink his fangs into some poor victim. Tonight, he\u2019s here to share his experience on one of the most pivotal battles in history: The Battle of Stalingrad.\"\n\nI nodded at the cameras to start rolling, then sat down in my chair. Dracula leaned forward, his eyes gleaming red. \"It was a long, cold winter, with endless bloodshed and death. I was on the side of the Nazis, who seemed like they were destined to win. But they lost, horribly.\"\n\nThe audience was completely silent now, rapt as Dracula told his tale. \"When it was over, I was forced to flee, but I couldn\u2019t shake the thought of what the Nazis had done. They were barbarians, monsters, and I was ashamed to have fought alongside them.\"\n\nI smiled at the cameras, then turned back to Dracula. \"But what about the rumors, Dracula? The rumors that you were actually fighting for the Nazis, but on your own terms? The rumors that you helped the Nazis kill millions of Soviet soldiers, then turned and stabbed them in the back, forcing the Nazis to retreat?\"\n\nThe audience was shocked, gasping, and I nodded at the cameras again. The footage was going to be huge, I could already see the ratings going up.\n\nDracula smiled, his fangs glinting in the lights. \"Those rumors are true.\" He leaned forward, his eyes flashing. \"I killed millions of Soviet soldiers. I drove them mad, I drained their blood, and I took their lives. Then, when the Nazis were ready to leave, I turned and attacked. I sunk my fangs into their necks, and I ripped them open. I killed them all, every last one. I saved Stalingrad.\"\n\nThe audience was stunned, mouths open, eyes wide, and I leaned forward, putting my arms on the table. \"Wait, you were a double agent?\"\n\nDracula chuckled, his breath cold. \"A triple agent. I killed the Nazis, I killed the Soviets, and I killed everyone else. I won the war.\" He leaned back in his chair, a satisfied smile on his face.\n\nI raised an eyebrow at him. \"But how did you do it? The Soviets had a hold on the city, the Nazis were retreating, and you were in hiding.\"\n\nDracula shrugged. \"It was easy. I simply waited for the right moment, then struck. I was a master of stealth, a shadow in the night, a blood-drinking specter.\"\n\nI stared at him, still trying to wrap my head around it. \"But you were a vampire. You\u2019re immortal. What did you gain from it?\"\n\nDracula sighed, leaning forward again. \"I gained nothing but a taste of revenge. The Soviets tortured me, forced me to flee, but I escaped. I killed them all, and I saved the city.\"\n\nThe audience was on the edge of their seats now, completely enthralled by the story. I nodded at the cameras again. The ratings were going to be huge, I could already see the award nominations.\n\nI leaned forward, smiling. \"Well, Dracula, it was a pleasure having you on the show tonight.\"\n\nDracula smiled, his fangs glinting in the lights. \"Likewise.\" Then, he turned and disappeared into the shadows."

Your followers have just summoned you to the mortal realm... to celebrate your birthday.\tLength: 450 words<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
        "pred_story": "I had no idea it was my birthday. My minions hadn't told me, my followers hadn't told me, I hadn't told myself. I had, after all, been around since before time. A day was a little inconsequential in that context.\n\nBut, as my portal opened on the mortal realm, the screaming told me that I was there for a reason.\n\nThe portal, a circular door of sorts, made of pure light, floated in the middle of a field. It was a weird place for a portal, but it was the best I could manage. I had sent a message to the mortals, to gather at this spot, but I thought they were just going to do a few sacrifices, maybe some offerings, and a prayer or two. I had no idea they were going to be so enthusiastic.\n\nThe portal was filled with light, and the heat emanating from it was almost palpable. It hummed, a deep vibration that caused my blood vessels to throb, and as it opened, it was a flood of warm light.\n\nI stepped through, and was immediately struck by the cacophony of sounds. The screaming, the shouts, the chanting, and the wailing. It was disorienting, a bit too much for my taste. But, as an elder god, I was used to a certain amount of reverence and worship.\n\nAnd here, in this strange place, were more mortals than I had seen in centuries. Thousands, maybe tens of thousands. All of them staring at me with a mix of fear and reverence. A few of them throwing their arms in the air, some of them screaming. The noise was almost deafening.\n\nThe field around us was strewn with offerings. Tens of thousands of pieces of fruit, all kinds of meat, dozens of caskets, and more incense than I could count. It was a sight to behold, but not one that I was used to.\n\nI looked around, trying to make sense of it all, when I saw the person standing at the front of the crowd. A young woman, a tiny thing, with short hair, and a pair of sunglasses. She was the only person in the crowd who wasn't screaming or revering me. She was just standing there, looking... unimpressed.\n\nA few moments later, a booming voice spoke, echoing through the crowd, \"Welcome, Elder God! We're glad you could make it!\"\n\nI was taken aback. A booming voice. That was new. I looked around, trying to find the source of the voice, but I couldn't see anyone.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I replied. \"I'm glad I could make it. But, what's all the fuss about?\"\n\nThe booming voice spoke again, \"Oh, we're just celebrating your birthday!\"\n\nI blinked. Birthday? Ah, right. My birthday. I had forgotten.\n\n\"That's nice,\" I said. \"I appreciate the effort, mortals. But, you don't have to celebrate. It's just a day, nothing special.\"\n\nThe crowd went quiet. No one was chanting or screaming, but the air was thick with tension.\n\nThe young woman stepped forward, her eyes fixed on me, \"I'm glad you're glad,\" she said. \"But, we can't let you go without celebrating. You're an important part of our lives. You're... an elder god.\"\n\nI stared at her, unable to understand. \"What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\nShe smiled, a hint of mischief in her eyes, \"You're an elder god,\" she said, again. \"You're an important part of our lives. We need you, now more than ever.\"\n\nI was about to respond, but she cut me off, \"We're going to sing a song, okay? It's your birthday song.\"\n\nI blinked, trying to understand what was happening. \"What song?\"\n\nShe smiled again, \"The birthday song,\" she said. \"It's what mortals do to celebrate a birthday.\"\n\nI was about to respond, but before I could, the crowd began to chant, \"Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you...\"\n\nI was confused, but the chanting was so loud that I couldn't help but join in. \"Happy birthday to you...\""

I especially didn't like being out at night. \n\nThe streets were full of people and none of them took me for anything other than a traffic cone. \n\nI was already getting tired of this costume. \n\nIt was the third night I wore it and I wanted nothing to do with it. \n\nMy roommate was at home with a broken leg. He was a hero and he broke his leg and he was in a lot of pain.\n\nMy rent was coming up in two days. \n\nThe villains that my roommate used to work for were coming by to get their money. \n\nThat's when my roommate told me about his plan. \n\nHe said that he would use a costume to convince the villains that I was him. \n\nAll he had to do was sit back in his room and wait for me to return. \n\nHe had to wear his costume and tell the villains that I was sick. \n\nThat's when I felt stupid. \n\nI was the one who was sick. \n\nI was the one that was tired of being sick. \n\nI wasn't sick. \n\nBut I did have a plan. \n\nI was going to have fun while wearing the costume. \n\nThe villain that I was pretending to be was a villain of the night. \n\nI was going to be the best villain that I could be. \n\nI was going to be so good that my roommate would never have to pay a single penny again. \n\nI ran to the villain's house with a huge smile on my face. \n\nI was ready to kick butt. \n\nI reached the front door. \n\nI knocked. \n\nA few moments later the door opened. \n\nThere was a villain standing on the other side of the door. \n\n\"Hello there,\" he said. \n\n\"You must be the new minion,\" he said. \n\nHe didn't sound as mad as I thought. \n\n\"Yeah, that's me,\" I said. \n\nI smiled.\n\n\"Listen, I know that my roommate is sick,\" I said. \n\n\"I know that he can't come out. \n\nBut he's getting better,\" I said. \n\nThe villain looked at me and I saw a hint of hope in his eyes. \n\n\"Do you know what day it is?\" he asked. \n\n\"Yeah, it's Wednesday,\" I said. \n\n\"Right,\" he said. \n\nHe reached to his pocket and pulled out a paper. \n\nHe handed it to me. \n\n\"Your payment,\" he said. \n\nI looked at the paper. \n\nIt was a check. \n\nI smiled. \n\n\"I'll just have to make my roommate a doctor,\" I said. \n\nThe villain looked at me. \n\n\"I thought he was sick,\" he said. \n\n\"Yeah, he is,\" I said. \n\n\"Then how are you a doctor?\" he asked. \n\nI smiled. \n\n\"I'm going to be his doctor,\" I said. \n\nThe villain looked at me with a huge smile. \n\n\"You're right,\" he said. \n\nI smiled. \n\n\"And you're right too,\" I said. \n\n\"Everyone needs a doctor,\" I said. \n\nThe villain laughed. \n\n\"True that,\" he said. \n\nWe talked for a while. \n\nI never knew that villains were so nice. \n\nI learned that I liked villains. \n\nI left the house with a smile on my face. \n\nI knew that my roommate was in good hands. \n\nI ran home and I saw him sleeping. \n\nI smiled and I went to bed. \n\nHe was going to be okay."

        "pred_story": "\"Is that you?\" asked a sleepy voice from across the room. As it woke up and saw me sitting on the floor, it asked, \"Why are you there? Did something happen?\"\n\n\"No, I just got tired,\" I said, taking a deep breath, \"but did you hear anything?\" I asked, noticing my companion had a look of confusion on his face, \"anything unusual?\" I asked again.\n\n\"I heard someone knock on the door and wake me up but I think it was just you, you must have hit the door with your foot or something,\" my companion said. \"Why do you sound so nervous?\" he asked, noticing me squirming on the floor.\n\n\"No reason,\" I lied, \"I think we just need to be more careful in the future. I know this might sound a little bit paranoid but I just heard a voice, and I'm scared that someone might be watching us.\"\n\nMy companion shrugged, \"I hear voices and stuff all the time, I don't think much of them unless they tell me to do something bad. If they are actually watching us then we could just go back to the army base and use our military training and some magic to defend ourselves. I also remember some stuff in my training about how to do that.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but the voice told me to say nothing. And also, what if the voice isn't telling the truth? Maybe it was just a hallucination or a trick. We can't let someone's voice change how we live our lives, that would be crazy.\"\n\n\"But what if it's the truth?\"\n\n\"You're missing the point of my argument, I understand if you don't believe me but I'm really scared that we're in danger. Let's just be more careful, we can't always be so open with our lives, especially since we both have...gifts.\"\n\nMy companion looked down at the floor, \"I'm scared too,\" he said, \"we really don't have any other choice but to be more careful, we don't want to die too early. Let's just be more careful about what we do and where we do it. If anyone asks, we didn't hear anything weird, and if they start following us, we'll just go to the base and use our military training to take care of them.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" I said, getting up, \"I think that makes sense. We both don't want to die too early and we're not really in a rush to do anything anyway. We just need to be more careful.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" my companion said, \"but don't freak out if you start hearing voices again. It's not the end of the world, we're fine.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" I said, before we both started to walk out of the room. But when we got outside and into the hallway, I noticed a piece of paper on the ground. We both walked closer to it and we both saw that it was a note, \"I know what you both are,\" it said, \"and I'm going to punish you both. You should have stayed in your rooms. If you're still reading this then you're already in grave danger.\"\n\nI looked at my companion and both of us had the same idea, we both started to run. But the hallway was in a maze like pattern, and I wasn't quite sure which direction we were running in.\n\nBut I didn't care, I had to save myself and my companion, I had to get to safety. I ran faster and faster, but every time I thought I had a sense of direction, I would turn a corner and lose my bearings.\n\nI didn't know how long I had been running when I saw a door to the left, I quickly ran towards it and opened it. But when I got inside, I realized that I was in a room with no furniture, just a plain wall. I thought I was in trouble until I heard my companion run into the room, \"What are you doing?\" he asked.\n\n\"I found this door and it looks safe in here,\" I said, \"let's just stay here until the danger passes.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" he said, \"but be careful, I don't want you to get hurt. We can wait it out for a little while, let's just stay here.\"\n\nWe both stayed in the room for what felt like an hour until the danger passed, and we both realized that there were two ways to leave the room, one to the left and one to the right.\n\n\"Which one do you think we should use?\" asked my companion.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said, \"I'm not quite sure where we are. But I think we should go to the right, that way we'll avoid anything that might be waiting to our left.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" he said, \"but if there are any dangers waiting for us to the right, we can always come back here and wait. Let's just be careful and take our time.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" I said, before we both started to walk out of the room. And when we got outside, I noticed that there were no dangers, but instead, people were waiting for us with a look of surprise. \"Wow, where were you two?\" asked a voice.\n\nI looked at my companion and we both gave a small smile, \"Just a little experiment we were doing to test our training,\" I said, \"where were you people?\"\n\nThe man just laughed, \"Just a little experiment you were doing? That's a pretty strange way to test your training. But it seems like it worked. You two are quite the pair.\"\n\nI looked at my companion again and he just rolled his eyes, \"Yeah, we're a pretty weird pair,\" he said. \"But we both think that's a good thing. We both think that being a weird pair is what makes us so unique and good.\"\n\n\"True,\" said the man, \"but it's not just what you two think, it's also what the other people here think. You two are definitely one of a kind.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said my companion, and then we both just sat there staring at each other before I got up and walked away.\n\nBut as I was walking away, I heard the man's voice, \"Wait,\" he said, \"where are you going? Why are you leaving?\" I just turned to him and smiled, \"Because I think I found out what the voice was,\" I said.\n\n\"WHAT?!\" He exclaimed, before I turned and ran away.\n\nBut I didn't run away, I ran towards the man and tackled him to the ground. He looked at me in shock, \"What the hell are you doing?!\" He shouted, and then he saw my hand glow, before he screamed and tried to fly away, but I quickly casted a spell and held him in place, \"Sorry,\" I said.\n\n\"But you told me that you and your companion were a pair, you said that you guys were a little weird but that was just what made you guys unique and good.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know,\" I said, \"and you're right, we are a little weird and that's what makes us unique and good. But that's not what I meant by the voice,\" I said, \"I know what the voice was.\"\n\nHe looked at me in shock, \"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON"

        "pred_story": "The creature looked like something out of your nightmares, if you had the energy you would have ran, but starvation kept you laying still. It was a twisted, gnarled monster, with spines and bony protrusions all over its body. Its skin was a sickly green, with white bones showing through here and there, as if its skin was stretched tight over its bones. In place of eyes, it had two black holes that sucked the light out of the room, and it moved with a jerky, unnatural gait.\n\nAs it drew closer, you realized with a start that it was staring at you. It cocked its head to the side, and you realized it was trying to talk to you. \"Your kind eat apples?\" it asked in a voice that was almost, but not quite, human. It sounded like a monkey with a mouth full of pebbles, but somehow it was intelligible.\n\nYou nodded, your mouth too dry to speak. \"Yes,\" you croaked.\n\nThe creature dropped what it was holding, and you saw that it was an uprooted apple tree, its branches and roots twisted and gnarled. You realized then that it must have been here for a long time, this creature, slowly clawing its way out of the ground. You heard the sound of roots and dirt scraping against metal, and you realized that the creature must have somehow pulled itself out of the ground.\n\nIt moved closer, its twisted face twisted in a hungry, drooling grin. \"Eat?\" it repeated, and you realized that it was asking you if you wanted to eat the apples. You nodded again, and the creature dropped the apples at your feet.\n\nYou tried to reach out and grab one, but your muscles felt leaden and heavy, as if they had been filled with molten lead. The creature reached out and picked up an apple in its spindly fingers, holding it out to you. \"Eat?\" it repeated again, and you realized that it was asking if you wanted to eat the apple.\n\nYou nodded again, and the creature peeled the apple with its sharp, curved claws, its fingers moving with a strange, unnatural speed. It handed you half of the apple, and you took a bite, the crunchy sweetness filling your mouth.\n\nThe creature ate the other half, and then it picked up a handful of dirt from the floor and began to rub it into its skin. You realized that it was a gesture of friendship, like the way that a dog wags its tail, and you felt a surge of emotion. You had never felt this way about a monster before, but somehow you felt like this creature was different.\n\n\"Your kind...\" the creature began, and then it stopped, as if it didn't know how to finish the sentence. It looked at you with its empty black eyes, as if it was searching for something.\n\n\"Your kind...\" it began again. \"Your kind eat many things. Much... water.\" It made a drinking motion with its hand, and you realized that it was asking how people drank water. \"Water... wet,\" it said, and you realized that it was trying to communicate.\n\nAs you talked to the creature, you realized that it was somehow intelligent, despite its twisted and gnarled appearance. It had been trapped underground for a long time, and it had never seen human society, but somehow it had adapted and learned. It was like a monster from a nightmare come to life, but it was also somehow... kind.\n\nFinally, the creature finished its conversation with you, and then it looked at you with its empty black eyes. You realized, with a start, that it was hungry again, and that you had eaten its apple. You looked down and saw the half-eaten apple at your feet, and you felt a surge of panic. \n\nThe creature moved closer, its twisted face twisted in a hungry grin. \"Eat?\" it repeated, its voice rising to a growl. \"Eat... you.\" It began to move closer, its sharp, curved claws flexing and un-flexing, as if it was preparing to strike.\n\nYou realized, with a start, that this creature was not the monster you had always imagined. It was not a mindless beast, eating everything in its path. It was something else entirely, something that had somehow evolved to be more intelligent than you had ever imagined.\n\nAnd then, just as suddenly as it had started, the creature stopped. It cocked its head to the side, its empty black eyes fixed on some point on the wall. You followed its gaze, and you saw that the wall was covered in strange, green symbols. They looked like some kind of writing, but you had no idea what language they were in.\n\nThe creature looked at you, and you realized that it was trying to communicate again. \"Your kind,\" it began. \"Your kind know?\" It pointed to the symbols, and you realized that it was asking if you knew what they meant.\n\nYou shook your head, and the creature let out a strange, guttural laugh. \"Know... much,\" it said, as if it was proud of itself. And then it began to move towards the wall, its twisted, gnarled body twisting and contorting as it went.\n\nYou watched as it began to rub its body against the symbols, its skin glowing a sickly green as it did. And then, with a sudden jolt, you realized what was happening. The creature was leaving a message, one that would be visible to anyone who came into the room.\n\nIt was a message from a monster, one that would be misinterpreted as proof of a zombie apocalypse. But the truth was much stranger than that. The creature was intelligent, and it had evolved to be so. It was like a zombie, but it was somehow, inexplicably, kind.\n\nAnd then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the creature was gone. It disappeared into the shadows, its twisted body disappearing from view. You realized, with a start, that you had been so caught up in the moment that you had forgotten to be afraid.\n\nBut then, you saw the message that the creature had left on the wall. It was a simple drawing of an apple, surrounded by the strange, green symbols that you had seen on the wall. You realized, with a start, that the creature had been trying to communicate with you all along. And then you heard the sound of footsteps, coming from the other side of the door. The creature must have gone to get its friends, you realized, and you felt a surge of fear. But then you saw the words that it had written, and you realized what was happening. The zombie apocalypse was a hoax."

        "pred_story": "The dragon was lying in the grass, its great long body stretched out in an awkward way. The heat shimmered off of it, and when it flared out I could see the metal plating that covered its scales. It had been the hardest project I'd ever undertaken, even without the added complexity of getting it to sit still. I'd never thought I'd be working with a dragon, even when I signed the contract. It had been one of those things you read about but never actually expected.\n\nI walked up to the dragon, and it tilted its head to look up at me. Its eyes, a deep orange, looked up at me and its gaze was piercing. \"Are you almost done?\" It said in a smooth, almost human voice.\n\n\"I'm done with the first part,\" I said as I held up a metal plate that I'd been crafting. \"I'm going to do the core system next. The most important one,\" I said, gesturing to the place where it would be implanted. The dragon moved its head again, and I saw the opening in its neck.\n\nI held up the plate again, and the dragon looked at it. \"What's this?\" It asked, looking from the plate to me and back again.\n\n\"It's part of the new core. I'm going to install it now,\" I said, reaching into my toolbox and pulling out the required tools.\n\n\"Can you explain it to me first?\" The dragon said, tilting its head again. I stopped, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\"What?\" I asked, reaching for the drill.\n\nThe dragon leaned forward, the scales on its head shifting as it moved. \"Please. You don't usually explain it to me.\"\n\n\"You're right. I don't. It's your first cybernetic implant though, and I'm sure you have a lot of questions. Go ahead and ask me anything you want to know.\"\n\nThe dragon blinked, its eyes moving in a way that seemed almost... mechanical? The thought was pushed from my mind as it asked, \"What does this do? What makes it a cybernetic implant?\"\n\n\"Okay. So first off, this is a core system. It's a central system that controls everything else. And I've designed it to work with its current systems. You've got a lot of built-in capabilities, but this will just enhance them. It's going to control your nervous system, giving you faster reflexes and more precise control. It's going to enhance your senses, giving you better eyesight and hearing. And it's going to control the implants on your scales, allowing me to remotely control them.\"\n\nThe dragon tilted its head again, its tail swishing through the grass. \"And what does it do for your core?\"\n\n\"It gives you a central system to control everything,\" I said, looking back and forth between the dragon's eyes.\n\n\"I already have that. That's how I'm talking to you.\" The dragon said, its voice smooth. \"What does it do that my current system can't?\"\n\nI sighed, looking at my notes again. \"Okay. Think of this as... well, you're a dragon. You have scales. You have wings. You have fire. This core system is going to enhance those things. It's going to let me control your fire. It's going to make your scales more resistant to damage. It's going to let you fly faster. And it's going to allow me to connect it to other systems.\"\n\nThe dragon was silent for a long moment. It stared at me, and I could feel its gaze burning into me. \"It's a cybernetic implant. It will make me more like you.\" It said, its voice barely above a whisper. \"I don't know if I want to do that.\"\n\nI nodded, moving forward. \"I understand. It's not for me. It's for you. I'll never make you do something you don't want to do. And if you want to stop, just say so. I'll stop.\"\n\nThe dragon nodded slowly, its head tilting again. It looked at me, its eyes glinting in the sun. \"I want to do this. I want to see what it's like to be more like you.\""

        "pred_story": "I've got to admit that it felt good to feel normal again. For a while, it had all been so complicated, and not in a bad way, but in an overly complex one. Sure, it would be easy to just say that I had been turned into a bird, and that was that, but that's not the case. It's all so much more than that. There was a time when I had to choose to become a bird. Sure, I don't have to make that choice now, but that doesn't mean that the consequences aren't still the same.\n\n\"Hey, I'm not going to lie to you, this isn't a normal day for you, is it?\" I said to the human as I walked into the room. \"The last time you saw a dog, you got a little too excited and you tried to talk to me. If I'm being honest with you, I was a bit concerned that you might get scared of me. And if you did, I'd have to do something to make you feel better.\"\n\n\"You're not a dog, I can see that. But I still need to know what's going on. I'm not crazy, am I? I mean, I know what happened, but I'm not crazy, am I?\"\n\n\"Well, not in the classical sense, at least,\" I said with a smile. \"You did get a little too excited when you saw me, but that's understandable. Dogs are cute and furry, and most humans get a little too excited when they see them. And if you did get scared, I was going to give you a little something to make you feel better.\"\n\n\"So, you've been a dog?\"\n\n\"Yeah. It was a bit of a complicated decision to become a dog, but it made sense for my life at the time.\"\n\n\"You can see that, can't you? I mean, you're a dog, but you can also hear me. And I can hear you. I've always felt like there was something different about you. And when I see your reflection, I don't see my own reflection looking back. What's going on? Who are you?\"\n\n\"I'm you, but not you. You know how sometimes you can hear a song, but you can't remember the title or the artist? That's like me. I can hear your thoughts and memories, but I can't always tell which one they are. It's like I'm you, but I'm not. If that makes any sense.\"\n\n\"I don't get it. It's like I'm talking to myself, but I'm not. But, you're still me, I guess. You can do the same things I can. I mean, you can talk to me, but you're not. I don't get it.\"\n\nI sighed. This was getting more complicated than I had anticipated. \"The easy way to put it is this: I'm not you. I'm not you because I'm not alive. I'm a creation of yours, and I was made for your benefit. And since you can hear my thoughts and see my memories, you'll know if I'm being dishonest with you. And that's a good thing, because I want you to be aware of my intentions. And I'm here to help you. You've been going through a lot lately, and I want to help you get through this.\"\n\n\"I... I see,\" she said slowly. \"I'm not sure I can understand that, but I'll take your word for it. Look, I'll be honest with you. You don't have to be me. You don't have to do what I do. You don't have to be my conscience, or whatever it is you are. You just have to be you.\"\n\n\"Thank you for understanding that,\" I said with a smile. \"I know that I'm just a creation of yours, but it feels good to be me. I'm you, but not you. I'm me, but not me. And I'm here to help you. I want to help you. And I know that I can do just that.\"\n\n\"I... I don't know what to say,\" she said with a smile. \"I'm glad that you're here. I'm glad that you can help me. And... I just want to get through this. I don't want to be like this anymore. I just want to be me again.\"\n\nI nodded. \"I know. And I'm here to help you with that.

        "pred_story": "It was a few minutes past six when Dr. Patel let me out of the lab. \"Thank you for your participation in our research, sir,\" she said, as I left the lab for the first time that day. I had been there for almost four hours, and I was getting hungry. \"Did you receive the instructions that I left in your file? Please return them to us by Monday.\"\n\n\"I'll do that,\" I said, trying to keep my annoyance in check. She looked like a nice person, after all, so I didn't want to let her know how upset I was. \n\n\"Good. Do you have any questions about the procedure or the trial?\" she asked.\n\n\"No,\" I replied. She smiled and turned to leave.\n\nI looked at the instructions, and a thought occurred to me. \"Do you have a bathroom I can use?\" I asked. \"You can use the one down the hall,\" she said. \"It's the first door on your left.\" I made a mental note to do that.\n\nI walked down the hall and found the bathroom. It was a standard hospital bathroom, with two stalls and four sinks. There was a person in the first stall, so I decided to use the second stall. As I walked in, I heard a faint humming noise coming from the stall.\n\nI froze. I didn't hear anything else. I looked back at the door and then again at the stall. My heart was beating faster. I slowly opened the door to the stall, and that's when I saw the people in there. It was Dr. Patel, the nurse, and the janitor. They were all looking at me, their eyes black and glowing.\n\nI didn't let out a sound. I walked out of the bathroom and back to the lab. Dr. Patel and the others were there waiting for me, their eyes still black and glowing. \"What did you think you saw?\" Dr. Patel asked. \"I don't know, I just saw you guys in the bathroom. You were humming and your eyes were black,\" I said. \"You were just hallucinating,\" the nurse replied. \"Those are common side effects of this drug.\" \"This is the first test of a new medication for depression and anxiety,\" Dr. Patel added. \"It's still in the testing phase, so there are still some side effects.\"\n\nI sighed. I was pretty sure I wasn't hallucinating, but I also wasn't a doctor. \"Are you sure you're alright, sir?\" Dr. Patel asked. \"Yeah, I think so. I just got a little scared, that's all.\" \"That's understandable,\" the nurse replied. \"But we need to run some more tests to make sure that you're alright.\" \"What kind of tests?\" I asked. \"We need to run some blood work and get some more information from you.\" Dr. Patel replied. I felt my heart sink. More tests? \"Look,\" I said, \"I'm starving. I haven't eaten since yesterday. Can I just go home now? I'll come back later when you have more tests.\"\n\n\"No,\" Dr. Patel replied. \"We can't let you leave now. We need to run more tests.\" I groaned. I had been here for almost four hours, and now they wanted me to stay here longer? \"Why?\" I asked. \"Because you have a rare condition that requires immediate medical attention,\" the nurse replied. \"I know you're hungry, but it's better to keep you here until we can figure out what's wrong.\" Dr. Patel added. \"But I don't have anything wrong,\" I argued. \"You are hallucinating,\" the nurse said. \"You said so yourself. There is something wrong with your brain.\" \n\n\"Look,\" I said, \"I'm not hallucinating. I know what I saw, and I know what I heard. I want to leave now. If you're going to keep me here any longer, you're going to have to give me some money.\" The nurse looked surprised by my demand. \"What?\" she asked. \"You want us to pay you to stay?\" I nodded. \"Yeah. That's right. If you can't, then just let me go home. I'll come back tomorrow.\" Dr. Patel sighed. \"Fine,\" she said. \"We'll give you the money. But if you try to leave before we get it to you, we'll have to take you back to the lab.\" \"Alright,\" I said. \"I'll be back tomorrow.\" \"Not tomorrow,\" she replied. \"Tonight. We need to get the money to you right now.\" She walked over to her desk and picked up the phone.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" I asked. \"I'm calling security,\" she replied. I groaned. \"Look,\" I said. \"I'm hungry. If you're not going to give me the money right now, just let me go home.\" \"Fine,\" she said. \"But if you're not back here in an hour, we'll have to take action.\" \"I'll be back in an hour,\" I said. I turned and left. \"What are you doing?\" the nurse asked. \"I'm calling the police,\" Dr. Patel replied. \"He's going to make a call for help. If he doesn't call in an hour, we'll be in trouble.\" \"Yeah,\" the nurse replied. \"I'm going to go get some lunch.\"\n\n\"He'll be here in an hour,\" Dr. Patel said. \"We need to be ready. Call the others and get them here. We'll need all hands on deck when he comes back.\"\n\nThe nurse nodded and left the room. Dr. Patel turned and looked at the phone. She was still holding it. She put it back in the cradle and walked over to the door. She looked at it for a moment, then back at the room. She sighed and sat down at her desk. She put her hands together and closed her eyes.\n\n\"So,\" I said as I walked into the lab. \"Did you guys get a hold of the police?\"\n\nDr. Patel was sitting in her chair, her eyes closed. The nurse was sitting in the corner of the room, her back against the wall. \"Yes, we did,\" the nurse said. \"They're on their way.\" I smiled. \"Good,\" I said. \"I'm glad you called them. I'm scared.\" \"Don't be scared,\" Dr. Patel said. \"We'll protect you.\" \"Yeah,\" the nurse said. \"We'll do whatever it takes.\" \"But what if the police aren't enough?\" I asked. \"The police will be enough,\" Dr. Patel said. \"They're trained to deal with these situations. We just need to call them.\" \"But what if they're not enough?\" I asked again. \"Then,\" Dr. Patel said, \"we have another plan. We've been preparing for this. We've set up a system to keep you here until they arrive.\"\n\n\"You're not going to get me to stay in this room all night,\" I said. \"Oh, but you will,\" the nurse said, standing up from the wall. \"We have a few tricks up our sleeves.\""

        "pred_story": "I sat in the back of the wagon, silent, watching the scene outside. The rest of the party was celebrating their victory over the demon lord, and in a strange way, my heart was heavy.\n\nThey didn\u2019t really know me. They didn\u2019t really understand me. They didn\u2019t really trust me. And it made sense. How could they? I was a necromancer.\n\nIt was a shame, really. I had joined this party to prove my worth, to prove that I could help them in their quest. And they had accepted me, even if they were skeptical at first. And I had helped them. I had killed my fair share of monsters and demons and saved the day. Or so I thought.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been with us long enough, necromancer,\u201d the party leader, a human fighter said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s time we got rid of you.\u201d The other party members nodded in agreement. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a necromancer in our party. Not anymore.\u201d\n\nI sighed. This was expected. \u201cI understand. But I have one last request. Let me speak to the Hero before you do anything.\u201d\n\nThe party leader smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t think that will be necessary. We\u2019ve already talked to the Hero. He\u2019s been understanding about your betrayal.\u201d\n\nThe other party members chuckled at this, while I felt a cold sensation in my chest. My betrayal? My betrayal was simply trying to follow the instructions I was given.\n\nThe party leader leaned in, his sword pointed at my face. \u201cYou\u2019ll do as we say, necromancer. You\u2019ll go to the afterlife. It\u2019s what you do, after all.\u201d\n\nI nodded slowly, pulling out a small vial of poison from my sleeve. I had prepared this before we had arrived at the demon lord\u2019s fortress. I swallowed the poison, and immediately, I felt my vision fade away. I collapsed to the floor, and the party members began to attack me.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t feel pain or fear. Instead, I felt a strange sense of calm, as if I had finally found the purpose I had been searching for.\n\nThe next thing I knew, I was in the afterlife, standing before the goddess herself. \u201cAh, necromancer,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have fulfilled your purpose. I appreciate it.\u201d She paused, then waved her hand.\n\nThe door to the afterlife opened, and I saw the Hero standing in the threshold, his sword slung over his shoulder. He looked older than before, and yet, his eyes still sparkled with the same fire that I remembered. \u201cSo you\u2019re the one,\u201d he said, walking up to me. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d actually do it.\u201d\n\nI bowed my head. \u201cI had to. The prophecy required it.\u201d\n\nThe goddess chuckled. \u201cAh, yes. I\u2019m afraid it did. But I have to say, I was very impressed with the creativity of the prophecy. I wasn\u2019t expecting the necromancer to be the one to fulfill it, but you did it. Well done.\u201d She smiled, then turned to the Hero. \u201cAnd as promised, I have rewarded your service.\u201d\n\nThe Hero looked at me, then at the goddess. \u201cWhat about my party? I asked them to spare him.\u201d\n\nThe goddess waved her hand again. \u201cAh, yes. Well, they don\u2019t have a choice now, do they? The Hero\u2019s reward is the key to our eternal reign.\u201d\n\nThe Hero sighed, then looked at me. \u201cI guess that\u2019s it. I\u2019ll never see you again.\u201d I nodded, and he turned to leave. I watched him go, then felt myself being pulled away, back to my body."

        "pred_story": "The gods are often depicted as great beings that walked the earth as mortals. I have seen a few different accounts, but the one of the most interest was the account of three people that walked the earth in an era I could only find labeled as \"the golden age\".\n\nThe first of the three had been called \"the protector\" and had been born a princess. She was seen as a hero by some, and a fool by most. She was a skilled warrior, but was most known for her ability to heal any wound. The accounts of her healing abilities were impressive, with most reporting that she could heal even the dead with her abilities. It was this skill that was also her downfall, as it made her look more like a goddess than a mortal.\n\nThe second was called \"the guardian\". He was a great warrior, and a master of the elements. His power was such that it was said he could conjure fire from thin air, and could command the winds to his will. It was his power that also got him killed, as he was challenged by a rival king and defeated. While his power was great, it was his arrogance that was his downfall, as he fought a battle that he could not win.\n\nThe last was called \"the creator\". She was born with great wealth, but was not interested in the riches. Instead she sought to gain wisdom. She was a great healer, and was able to gain knowledge from the spirits of the land. Her wisdom was so great that it was said she could talk to the spirits of all animals, and that she could teach them to speak to her as well. Her wisdom was great, but it was also her downfall, as she would ask the spirits of the land for help in times of need.\n\nI am the third. I am not a warrior, but I do have skills that are great. I am a master of the elements, and can call upon the power of fire and water. But my power is not great, and I am not arrogant, and I never ask for help from the spirits. Instead I use my knowledge of the elements to heal, and to protect those that are in need.\n\nI do have a rival, however. He is known as the devil, and he seeks to undo everything that the three great messiahs did to save humanity. While he is a skilled warrior, and a master of the elements, his power is still nothing compared to mine. He is arrogant, and has already lost many battles to me, but he is not dead yet, and will not die until he has won one last battle against me."

        "pred_story": "I've always been the bad guy. Always been the one trying to conquer the world and enslave humanity. Always been the one who wanted to be the supreme ruler of everything. But, I never thought about what would happen if those I was trying to enslave tried to stop me.\n\nNow, I've thought about this for a while, and I'm going to have to admit, the thought of my enemies trying to thwart my plans is rather entertaining to me. But, I've never found the time to actually try out my ideas. But, one of my enemies had to go and make me stop thinking about more important things, like how I could best conquer the world. So, I decided to do what I always said I would do, and use my best villainous powers to cause my enemies to be put in a predicament.\n\nNow, I'll admit, the first few attempts were quite funny. Well, more like hilarious, than funny. When I had a hero, with a very serious expression, stuck in a toilet. Or, when I had another hero stuck in a large dumpster in a particularly stinky part of town. But, even with those ideas, they failed. Not in the way that would give me satisfaction, though. They just managed to get out of them.\n\nNow, I've always said that my greatest power, besides my vast army of minions, was my ability to do whatever I wanted. Now, my enemies were finally able to put that to the test. And, I'll have to admit, they were quite successful in their attempts to cause me misery. Not only were they successful, but they were also a lot more entertaining than I would have hoped. But, still, I was not happy with their methods. Why should my enemies be able to outsmart me?\n\nSo, I sat down and thought about how I could outsmart my enemies. Well, I thought about it for a bit, but decided that just giving up was the best idea. Why should I be the one trying to outsmart my enemies? Why should I be the one who gets to be on top? It's not fair to my enemies. I don't deserve to be the one who comes out on top, they should be the one to have that title. And, they would have that title, if they didn't keep failing me.\n\nBut, despite all that, they still kept on trying. But, no matter how hard they tried, they were never able to stop me. They were never able to find a way to make me stop, no matter how hard they tried. But, I'll admit, the thought of them finally giving up was rather amusing to me. Not only were they able to finally stop me, but they were also able to make me feel a little bad about myself.\n\nAnd, I can't say that I blame them for wanting to stop me. I can't say that I blame them for wanting to take me down. They had a reason to do so, and I didn't blame them for it. But, still, even as they were stopping me, they still were able to make me laugh. Not because they were able to beat me, but because they were able to make me feel a little bad about myself.\n\nSo, I decided to stop trying to stop them. I decided to take a step back and let them have their victory. After all, what's the point of being the villain if I don't have any enemies? I decided that I didn't need to try to stop them anymore. I didn't need to be the villain anymore. I could just let them win.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking that you can't let them win. You're thinking that the villain should never let the hero win. But, I say, why not? Why can't the villain let the hero win? Why can't the villain just let the hero have their victory? And, why can't the hero just let the villain have their fun?\n\nI know that you're not thinking about that right now. I know that you're just thinking about how the villain can't let the hero win. But, I think you should think about it a little bit. Think about how I would be the villain. Think about how my enemy would be the hero. Think about how we would both have our own story. Not the hero's story, nor the villain's story, but our own story.\n\nSo, I'll be sitting on my couch, reading a book, while my enemy is running off to save the world. And, if I want to stop them, I can just sit here and relax. But, if I want to help them, I can do that as well. I can be the hero, or the villain. I can be either, depending on how I want to be.\n\nAnd, maybe, you should think about that as well. Think about how it's not just about the hero and the villain. Think about how it's about how our own story is different from theirs. But, I'm sure that they would think otherwise. I'm sure that they would think that we should be playing by their rules.\n\nBut, I say, why not? Why should we play by their rules? Why can't we play by our own rules? Why can't we make our own story? I know that you're not thinking about that right now, but you should be. You should be thinking about how you can make your own story, instead of trying to follow the rules that everyone else has set out for you.\n\nSo, I'll sit here, reading my book, while my enemy is out saving the world. And, I'll do it with a smile on my face, knowing that I have my own story. A story that's different from theirs, but still entertaining. A story that's mine, and mine alone."

        "pred_story": "\"Good morning.\" A voice said, as a gentle hand patted my shoulder. I opened my eyes to see the owner of the voice. \"Morning.\" I mumbled back, rubbing the sleep off my eyes. She let out a laugh. \"I'm surprised you're awake.\" She said. I sat up and looked around my room. It was my room, it had to be. The walls were blue, the carpet was a weird patterned purple and blue, and there was an assortment of toys and video games on the floor. I looked down at myself, and that's when I noticed it. My hands were half clawed, with the blue scales of my heritage. \"What happened?!\" I screamed, leaping out of the bed. \"It seems the half dragon blood in you is showing more and more as you get older.\" A small dragon looked around my room, and sighed. She was small enough to fit in one of my hands, with a set of wings that were even smaller. I didn't remember a dragon taking a place in my room. \"You're just coming to terms with it, right? I can see the fear in your eyes, but I know that you're still the same person you've always been.\" I shook my head, looking away from the dragon. \"It's not just that. I...I don't remember you here.\" The dragon's eyes widened, before she looked at the ground. \"I'm sorry. I made a mistake and followed you home. I know I shouldn't be here. And you're right, you don't remember me. I'm so sorry. I'll leave right now.\" I watched as the dragon picked up a toy and started to leave. I looked around the room, before looking back at her. \"Wait.\" She stopped in her tracks. \"I need to go get my parents.\" The dragon sighed, and rubbed the back of her head. \"I know. I know I shouldn't be here, I know I shouldn't be living with you. I'm just so sorry for my mistake. I'm all alone, no parents, no family. I'm so sorry.\" I sighed, and stood on my tiptoes. \"You're a dragon. How old are you?\" She looked down at the floor, and shuffled her feet. \"I'm 40.\" I sighed, and went back to my bed. \"You're 40.\" I said. \"You're right, you shouldn't be here. But I don't want you to leave. If it means you're going to live on the streets, then I'll make sure you have a place to live.\" I said, looking back up at the dragon. \"Really?!\" She asked. I looked at the floor, before I looked back up at her. \"Yeah. I mean, I don't want to be the only half dragon in the world, and I know you can't live on the streets. You're too big.\" She smiled, and shook her head. \"I can fit through a window. I used to live with a family of birds.\" I sighed, and laid back on the bed. \"It's good that you can fit through a window. I don't want you to get hurt.\" I said. She smiled, and patted my hand. \"I know. I'm sorry.\" I sighed, and watched as she looked at the toys and games on the floor. \"Why are you looking at all of this?\" I asked. \"This is what a normal childhood should be. All the toys, the games, it's what every dragon should have.\" She said, before sighing. \"It's what every dragon should have, but they're not what I want.\" I looked at her, confused. She looked at me, and smiled. \"I'm just happy to be alive. I just want to have a normal life.\" I smiled, and nodded. \"I know how you feel. I've always been happy to be a half dragon. But it's nice to know you're happy.\""

        "pred_story": "\"The mech is coming.\"\n\nA chill ran down my spine. They really didn't understand. \"I can control it.\"\n\n\"Well, it still has you inside.\" The man, a dark-skinned elf, narrowed his eyes. \"It's still alive, isn't it? But dead.\" He made a mock 'dead' pose with his fingers, as if that would prove his point.\n\nI sighed and threw my hands up in the air. \"No, I'm telling you! I'm alive! Or, at least, I'm still inside this body.\"\n\nThe man shrugged. \"The only way you're still alive is because you're in that machine. It's holding you in, keeping you alive. And the rest of the city is dead, aren't they? Because of the mech?\"\n\nI tried not to think about that. It was too painful to consider, the death of so many innocent people at the hands of this monstrosity. A monster that I had created.\n\n\"It's not my fault.\" I said. \"I had no control over it.\"\n\n\"But you were piloting it.\" The man replied. \"You were in control of it, weren't you?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No, I don't think that's right. I'm... I don't know. I was in a different body. One that was augmented with mech implants. I was a soldier in the army, fighting against this guy, this mad scientist who created this mech.\"\n\nThe man cocked his head to the side. \"And this guy? The mad scientist?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"I don't know. I never saw his face. But I killed him. At least, I think I did. The mech destroyed his base, killed all of his people. I... I thought he was dead. But I wasn't sure. I didn't see his body.\"\n\nThe man frowned. \"And you think he brought you here?\"\n\nI nodded. \"Yes. He did. He created a portal, one that sent me here. But he was also in me, through the mech. He was my consciousness. And he's... he's not happy about what I did.\"\n\nThe man frowned, and for a moment, I thought he might go back on his decision. But then he shook his head.\n\n\"No, you've made it clear that you are a danger to us. You're a monster, just like the one you killed. But you're even worse. You're more powerful.\"\n\nI shook my head, trying to clear it of the thoughts. \"I'm not a monster. I'm not a danger. I can control the mech.\"\n\n\"Can you?\" The man asked. \"Or is it controlling you? Is it a monster inside of you?\"\n\nI frowned. I didn't like the way he phrased that. It sounded almost... menacing. \"I know it's in me, yes. But I can control it.\"\n\nThe man sighed. \"We've heard that before. But we've seen what it's capable of. We've seen it kill innocent people. We can't take that risk.\"\n\nI glared at him, but the man just smiled and nodded. \"I know you're not a monster, but we can't take the chance. So I'm going to ask you one last time: step out of the mech.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No. I'm not going to do that. You can't force me to leave it.\"\n\nThe man raised his hand. \"I'm not going to force you. But if you don't step out, then... I'm afraid we're going to have to take more... extreme measures.\"\n\nI laughed, though I didn't mean to. I was scared. But I wasn't going to let them know. \"You'll never get inside.\"\n\nThe man sighed. \"I know. That's why we're not going to try.\"\n\nThe man stepped back, and the crowd that had gathered around the mech followed him. I looked down at my body, or rather, the body that I was inside of, and frowned.\n\nSomething was wrong. I could feel it, a feeling of being pulled in two directions. But I knew it was just my imagination. I was still in control.\n\nBut then I felt a movement, a slight shift. The mech was moving, though I didn't remember giving it the command to do so.\n\nI looked up, and saw the man, the dark-skinned elf who had been talking to me, raise his sword.\n\n\"The people have spoken,\" he said. \"And they've decided that you're a monster.\"\n\nI frowned, confusion washing over me. I knew that was wrong. I was not a monster.\n\nAnd yet, as I looked at the man, I felt a strange sense of acceptance. The man raised his sword, and I realized, with a sudden clarity, what he was going to do.\n\nThe mech moved again, and I felt my heart skip a beat. It was going to save me.\n\nBut I knew it was already too late. The man swung his sword, and I closed my eyes, waiting for the blow.\n\nBut it didn't come. Instead, I heard a strange sound, a sound like metal on metal. And then, I felt a jolt of electricity, one that sent me flying through the air.\n\nI landed hard, my body slamming into the ground as the mech lay nearby, motionless.\n\nI opened my eyes, and looked at the man, who stood over me, his sword at his side.\n\n\"Sorry about that,\" he said. \"I guess my sword wasn't as effective as I thought.\"\n\nI stared at him, confused, as he stepped back and looked at the mech. \"I know you're still inside, but it's not moving.\"\n\nI looked at the mech, and frowned. It hadn't moved since I had landed, and I knew it wasn't supposed to. The man looked back at me, a smile on his face.\n\n\"So, are you going to come out?\" He asked.\n\nI stared at him, confused. Come out of the mech? But... I didn't want to. I was still in there, trapped.\n\nBut then I remembered. I was free. I was alive.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, standing up, my body groaning in protest. \"I'm coming out.\"\n\nThe man smiled, and stepped back as I walked towards him. And then, I felt it, the strange sensation of my consciousness leaving the mech.\n\nAs I stepped free of the mech, I felt the weight of my body, the limitations of my human form. I looked down at my hands, and marveled at their weakness.\n\nBut I knew it didn't matter. I was alive, and that's all that mattered.\n\nI smiled, feeling a sense of peace wash over me. I had done it. I had escaped.\n\nAnd then, I saw her, the woman who had been watching from the side. She smiled, and stepped forward, her eyes shining with tears.\n\n\"You did it,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. \"You made it home.\"\n\nI smiled, feeling a surge of emotion. Home. I had made it home."

I've had a few colleagues come in and tell me that they can't even be bothered. So, I've got to do it myself.\"\n\nI looked up at the building across the street. I could hear some strange noises coming from inside. It was a mixture of some sort of creature's screeching and some sort of ancient tome being read. I frowned. \"What's the point of this all? So, I can put my friends and family in danger? So, I can risk my own life? Is it really worth it?\"\n\nI didn't even hear myself say it, but it felt like a good question to ask. I was just a simple man. I wasn't exactly born for this sort of thing. I felt like I'd been tricked into this sort of life, and now I was trapped in it.\n\n\"Alright, alright. Let's get this over with.\" I stood up and walked towards the building across the street. I could hear the screeching getting louder and more intense.\n\nI walked up the stairs and knocked on the door. \"Hey! I'm over here, you know?\" I called out, but there was no response.\n\nI put my ear against the door and listened. I could hear some sort of scratching coming from the other side of it.\n\n\"Hello? I can hear you, you know.\" I called out again. \"So, what's going on? Are you going to open the door?\"\n\nI could hear some sort of screeching and scratching getting louder and more intense.\n\nI sighed. \"This is going to be fun. You know, the last time I had to do this, I didn't exactly succeed. I had to use an actual gun to kill the damn thing. And it was a really big one, too. But this time? I think I'll just need to use some logic to kill this one.\"\n\nI looked down at the paper in my hand. It had some sort of writing on it, but I couldn't exactly read it. But I knew that it was a trick. All of them were tricks, you know? I've been doing this job for a while, so I know what to expect.\n\nI looked up at the door again. \"Well? Are you going to open the door, or do I need to use some actual force? You know, I've got a family to take care of. So, I don't have a lot of time for this sort of thing. You can't expect me to take on an actual abomination, can you? That's not fair. But you can expect me to take you down. I'm a professional, after all.\"\n\nI stepped back and took a deep breath. I could hear the scratching getting louder and more intense.\n\n\"Alright. If you're not going to open the door, then I'll have to do something more... persuasive.\" I pulled out a pen and paper and began writing.\n\n\"Hello? I know that you're in there. So, why don't you just open the door? It's a lot simpler than waiting for me to break in.\" I wrote a few words on the paper. \"Look, it's not even that hard. You can just open the door and walk away. It's a lot simpler than getting killed. But if you want to do that, then that's your decision, not mine. But I've still got the pen and paper. So, if you want to try and fight back, then you've got a lot of work to do. But I'm not expecting you to do that. I'm expecting you to do something smarter.\"\n\nI put the pen down and took a deep breath. I could hear the scratching getting louder and more intense.\n\n\"Fine. If you're not going to open the door, then I'll have to try and open it for myself. But you've been warned, you know? I've already told you that you've got the upper hand. So, if you really want to try and fight back, then you've got a lot of work to do. But I'm not expecting you to do that. I'm expecting you to do something smarter.\"\n\nI stepped forward and tried the door. It opened easily, and I could see some sort of creature huddled in the corner of the room. It was a strange creature, you know? It had a few tentacles and some sort of mouth on the end of one of them. But it was also sort of human. I could see its body under the sheets and blankets.\n\nI could hear it screeching and scratching, but I couldn't see what it was doing.\n\n\"Look, I know that you're upset. I know that you're trying to fight back. But there's no need to do that, you know? I'm not going to hurt you, you know? I'm just trying to get you to open the door. But you've been warned, you know?

I'm expecting you to do something smarter.\"\n\nI stepped forward and tried to pull the sheet off the bed.\n\n\"Fine. If you really want to try and fight back, then you've got a lot of work to do. But I'm not expecting you to do that. I'm expecting you to do something smarter.\"\n\nI could hear the creature screeching and scratching. I could hear it pulling away from me, trying to escape.

You almost admire the confidence, almost. You're no longer hungry, but you know she won't notice that until she's too late. You've eaten the last village maiden whole. Her parents have been eaten. Her friends have been eaten. Her family has been eaten. The entire village has been eaten.\n\nShe doesn't even flinch at the sight of you. A look of amusement appears on her face as she surveys the room. You hear her whisper something under her breath. \"They bought it.\" There's a flicker of excitement in her eyes, a spark of mischief that makes you sit up.\n\n\"Hey,\" you say. \"What's that supposed to mean? Do you know something I don't?\" You watch as she starts to circle around the room. She doesn't seem scared. She doesn't seem scared at all. You realize that you're no longer hungry. You're not sure how long it's been since you've eaten. You realize that you haven't been hungry in a long time. But you can't remember when you last ate.\n\nShe pauses in front of you, staring at you with a serious look. \"They bought it. They're coming for you.\" She starts to walk away. \"They're going to kill you,\" she says. \"And take back their town.\" You watch as she exits the room. You can't believe what you're hearing. She's lying to you. She thinks she's going to escape. She thinks she's going to kill you. You know she's going to die. She knows she's going to die. You both know you're going to die.\n\nShe stops in the hallway, turning to face you. \"There's nothing you can do to stop it,\" she says. \"I'm the last hope.\" She's not even trying to be convincing. You can tell she's enjoying this. \"We have to go,\" she says. \"Come on!\" You stand up, watching as she runs. You know where she's going. She's going to try and find help.\n\nBut you know you're too big. You know she won't be able to escape. You know that you'll catch up to her. You know that you'll catch her.

Believing that they didn\u2019t bother putting the time and effort into properly storing something that was too dangerous to be made widespread.\n\n\u201cNot too dangerous. Not too much. Just enough.\u201d I say to myself, my voice echoing off of the metal walls. I hear the sound of machinery whirring in the background, the occasional chime of what sounds like a countdown. I ignore it and continue exploring.\n\nThe vault is filled with ancient technology. Equipment and machinery that would be out of place in a modern laboratory. Most of it is rusted or corroded, the signs of age and neglect. I see what looks like an old time machine, its metallic surface reflecting my flashlight. Next to it is what appears to be a futuristic-looking computer. It\u2019s sleek, silver, and has an interface unlike anything I\u2019ve seen before. But as I approach, I\u2019m stopped by something more familiar.\n\nIt\u2019s a smartphone.\n\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d I say, picking up the phone. Its surface is covered in cracks and scratches, the screen is dimmed. I\u2019m about to put it down when I notice a string of apps on the screen. There are different social media platforms, different music streaming apps, even some older games like Minecraft and Fortnite. It\u2019s weird that this ancient phone has some of the same apps that everyone else has. \n\nI turn it off and leave it on the counter.\n\nMoving on, I see more technology, all seemingly abandoned. I find a tablet, a printer, a robot arm. None of it makes sense. I\u2019m starting to think that this vault is just a collection of old technology, junk left to rot. But then I find something more interesting.\n\nIt\u2019s a virtual reality headset.\n\n\u201cAh, this is cool.\u201d I say to myself, excitedly. It looks sleek, metallic with a black strap in the back. I pick it up, putting it on my head. It\u2019s heavy, the strap digging into my skin. \n\n\u201cWhoa. Whoa. What\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\nThe room begins to blur and distort. The walls and floor dissolve, replaced by some sort of futuristic landscape. I\u2019m floating in mid-air, the headset adjusting to my movements. I look around, seeing a city made of metal and glass. It\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve seen before. I look down, seeing a pair of metal legs connected to my own. I\u2019m holding onto one of the city\u2019s skyscrapers, gripping it tightly.\n\nI\u2019m an avatar in a video game. I\u2019m not even sure how that works.\n\nI begin to explore the world, discovering new things with each step. I\u2019m able to do things that I never thought possible, like fly and lift heavy objects. I\u2019m able to use powers like telekinesis and pyrokinesis. But as I continue to explore, I realize that everything I\u2019m doing has an equivalent in the real world. I\u2019m not even sure how this is possible.\n\nI look down at the VR headset, confused. I take it off, feeling dizzy.\n\nI look back at the smartphone I found earlier. I pick it up, noticing the apps on the screen. Minecraft, Fortnite. Virtual reality headsets.\n\nI turn it off.\n\nI\u2019m not even sure why I\u2019m here. But something tells me that I should leave this place alone. I put the phone in my pocket, leaving the vault as I was told to."

        "pred_story": "The dragon had done it again, and yet again he'd managed to get away with it. He'd never been very good at math, or strategy for that matter. Even when the kingdom made the effort to send knights to slay him, his little secret kept him safe.\n\nHe'd never reported his pillaging income, never paid his taxes on the treasures and gold and gems he'd stolen over the years. The knights would return to the kingdom empty-handed, or in some cases missing a limb or two. It was almost as if the dragon was cursed, like a bad luck charm for any knight foolish enough to try and slay him.\n\nBut now, the dragon was in trouble.\n\nHe'd just woken up to a new group of knights, each one more well-armored and more powerful than the last. It was like they'd all been made from the same mold, but with different colors and patterns. Some had red armor, others blue, but each one was perfectly crafted for battle.\n\n\"Who are you?\" the dragon demanded as it stretched its massive wings and breathed a blast of fire at the knights. They laughed, the sound like the gentle lapping of waves.\n\n\"We are the knights of the kingdom,\" one of them said as he stood forward, his armor a deep, rich gold. \"We've been sent to collect your taxes.\"\n\nThe dragon blinked. \"Taxes?\"\n\nThe gold-armored knight nodded, holding out a clipboard. \"Yes. You see, you've been living in the kingdom for quite some time now, and you've been taking from its treasury and from the people who live within its borders. We believe you owe them a small amount of money for those services.\"\n\nThe dragon's eyes widened in shock. It had never thought about taxes before. In fact, it thought that the kingdom only took taxes from people who actually lived there, not from mythical creatures like dragons.\n\n\"So, you're saying that I owe the kingdom money because I've taken from their treasury?\" the dragon asked as it puffed out its chest, trying to look as innocent as possible. \"I don't see why that should be my problem. It's not like I asked for their help when I was starting my hoard.\"\n\nThe gold-armored knight shrugged. \"The kingdom is a lot more complicated than that. You see, even if you're not living in the kingdom, you're still benefiting from the kingdom. You're living on land that is technically part of the kingdom, and you're taking things from the people who live there.\"\n\nThe dragon sighed, rubbing its temples. It knew that it wasn't going to get out of this one. \"Okay, fine. I'll pay my taxes.\"\n\nThe gold-armored knight nodded. \"Good. Now, let's get down to business.\"\n\nHe pulled out a calculator and began punching numbers into it. \"Okay, so we've got you down for a whole year's worth of taxes, plus a fine for failing to report your income.\"\n\nHe pressed a button, and the dragon's eyes widened as the number on the screen grew.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" the dragon demanded. \"You can't charge me for all those years!\"\n\nThe gold-armored knight sighed. \"I know, but the rules are the rules. And the rules say that any money taken from the kingdom's treasury or from its people counts as taxable income.\"\n\nHe sighed again. \"Look, dragon, I don't want to have to do this. But I'm going to have to take you in.\"\n\nThe dragon's eyes widened in fear. \"I'm sorry,\" it whispered, \"I didn't know.\"\n\nThe gold-armored knight nodded. \"I know. It's not your fault. But if you want to avoid going to jail, you're going to have to pay up.\"\n\nThe dragon sighed, rubbing its temples again. It knew that it was going to have to pay, but it was going to cost it everything it had. And to make matters worse, it was going to have to pay interest for all the years it had been evading its taxes.\n\n\"Well, I suppose I have no choice,\" the dragon muttered.\n\nThe gold-armored knight nodded. \"Good. We'll let you keep your hoard, but you'll have to take out a mortgage on it to pay off the kingdom.\"\n\nThe dragon frowned, trying to think of a way out of this situation. But it knew that it had no choice.\n\nIt sighed, then nodded. \"Okay. I'll do it.\"\n\nThe gold-armored knight smiled, relieved. \"Good. Now, let's get down to business.\"\n\nHe began punching numbers into his calculator, and the dragon's heart sank. It knew that this was going to be a long day.\n\n\"I don't see why this is such a big deal,\" the dragon said, sighing as it stared at the massive stack of papers in front of it. \"Just give me the number, and I'll write a check.\"\n\nThe gold-armored knight sighed. \"You know that's not how it works. You have to sign and date each and every form, and then mail them in with your payment. And you'll need to fill out the W-2 and the 1040.\"\n\nHe sighed again. \"Not to mention the interest on the mortgage, and the fines for failing to report your income.\"\n\nThe dragon threw up its hands. \"Can't I just write a check and be done with it?\"\n\nThe gold-armored knight shook his head. \"No. That's not how it works. And besides, the interest will just add up, and you'll never be able to pay it all back.\"\n\nThe dragon sighed, rubbing its temples. It knew that it had no choice. It would have to fill out all the forms and pay the taxes and fines. And to make matters worse, it would have to take out a mortgage on its hoard.\n\nBut it knew that it couldn't just run away. It would have to face the consequences of its actions.\n\n\"Okay,\" the dragon said, sighing. \"I'll fill out the forms.\"\n\nThe gold-armored knight nodded. \"Good. And remember, if you need any help or have any questions, you can always call the kingdom's tax hotline.\"\n\nThe dragon rolled its eyes. \"Yeah. I'm sure they'll answer.\"\n\nThe gold-armored knight smiled. \"Well, if they don't, we'll be back to check on you. Don't try to run away.\"\n\nThe dragon nodded, then began filling out the forms. It knew that it was going to be a long day."

I've seen a child, who can't be much older than 7, enter and start crying. I see her face. It's not a pretty sight. Dirt, cuts, blood. I see her eyes. She is crying. I hear her mumble incoherently. My eyes narrow. My fangs ache. I see her hands and her clothes. A lot of blood. I see her parents walk in. I hear her mumble again. I feel something strange. A feeling I have not felt in centuries. I feel pity. \n\nI take a step back. I do not want to be seen. I do not want to have any contact with this child. I do not want to have anything to do with her. Why would I care about a mortal? I had thought I had left all that behind. I turn to face the store and see the child's parents. They look to be in their late thirties. A man with long brown hair, a beard, and a long brown coat. A woman with a short brown bob, glasses, and a scarf covering her face. They walk up to their child and hug her tightly. They whisper something. She is crying again, but this time she is smiling.\n\nI feel something strange again. It is a pang in my heart. It is something I thought was impossible. Empathy. I want to go up to her and hug her. I want to go up to them and hug them. I do not understand. Why would I care about this child? Why would I care about these people? I am a creature that has spent centuries hiding from humanity. Now I am drawn to them?\n\nI start to wander through the store, not noticing what I am looking at. I see the child's parents glance at me. They frown. They do not understand either. I reach out with my mind. I know the parents. I know them from the child. I am drawn to them through the child. It is a strange thing. A bond I have never felt before. The child's parents are scared. The child is scared. I can feel their fear. I want to tell them that everything is alright. I want to tell them that I am not a monster. I want to tell them that I want to help them. I want to tell them that I care. I can feel a strange sensation in my chest. It is a strange pain. It is a feeling I have never felt before. It is love.\n\nI feel it again. It is a feeling I have never felt before. It is a feeling I do not understand. It is a feeling I have been trying to suppress for centuries. It is a feeling that I thought was impossible. It is a feeling that I can never feel again. I turn and walk out of the store. I do not know how to feel this way. I do not know how to be a mortal again. I do not know how to love. I am a creature that has spent centuries hiding from humanity. Now I am drawn to them through a child. I will never see her again. I will never see her parents again. I will never see the pain in their eyes."

        "pred_story": "The old factory was back to its old habits. The smokestack puffed white clouds. The wheels of the old factory screeched as it turned. The old factory, the one that could only be seen in movies, was in operation. The one that, when someone would mention it, someone would start to laugh, like I do every time I get the chance to talk to those noobs.\n\nThose noobs, the new ones. I was once a noob too, a new pilot who did not have the respect of the veterans. I never respected them either, I was the most respectful noob I could be. I listened to their stories and laughed with them as they told me about the old days, back when they still had to work hard to make it, back when a person could live off of a simple job.\n\nThe noobs were different, they had a better life, they never knew the old days, they never knew the life I knew. They grew up in the space age, where a person could live a life like royalty. They had no idea how hard it was to survive in a world that was already so full of people. A world where everyone was fighting for the same things.\n\nI laughed at them. I laughed at their clothes, their cars, their gadgets, their houses, their everything. And I was right, of course. I was the oldest and wisest and smartest. And the factory laughed with me, it puffed out more smoke, it screeched louder, it rumbled deeper. It was laughing, like we always did when the noobs would come and ask for their help. We had helped a lot of noobs, so many noobs. And we had laughed so hard. Until we couldn\u2019t anymore.\n\nThe last noob we helped was a hard one. The last noob was a stubborn one. And the last noob was the last one we would ever help. The noobs had changed. The noobs were not the same anymore. They had more sense than to come to us with their broken down ships and their broken down attitudes. They would rather buy a new ship, or steal a new ship, or even kill someone to get a new ship. And we laughed, not because we were amused, but because we were sad.\n\nThe factory had laughed too long. The factory had worked too hard. The factory had smoked too much. The factory had turned into a pile of junk. And that is why the noobs had stopped coming. And that is why I am stuck here, in this junkyard factory, with the old machines that do not work anymore, with the old pipes that leak anymore, with the old smokestack that puffs no smoke anymore.\n\nBut even a junkyard has its uses. And today is the day we will see what use we have today. A noob has come, but not just any noob, a noob that does not know how to fly. A noob that does not know how to fix a ship. A noob that does not know how to survive.\n\nA noob that I can have some fun with.\n\n\u201cHurry up, hurry up! Come on, baby! That\u2019s it, that\u2019s it! Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go! Just a bit more! Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\nI was excited. I had not been excited in a very long time. And it was not just because I was going to help another noob, it was because I was going to show them what the old days were like. I was going to show them how a real person survived in a world where everyone was fighting for the same things.\n\nAnd I was going to have fun with them. I was going to show them how to fix a ship, how to fly a ship, how to survive. I was going to teach them everything I knew. And when they were done, they would be able to survive in this world, even without their gadgets and their gizmos and their fancy spaceships.\n\nI ran around the old factory, I kicked the old wheels, I shook the old smokestack, I puffed out old smoke. And I laughed. I laughed so hard that I almost cried. And I heard someone behind me, someone who laughed with me, someone who had the same sense of humor that I did.\n\n\u201cCome on, come on! Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go! That\u2019s it, that\u2019s it! Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\nIt was the noob. The last noob. I laughed at them. I laughed at their ship, their clothes, their gadgets, their everything. And I laughed at their face, their skin, their hair. I laughed at them because they did not know what they were in for. They did not know what they were getting themselves into.\n\nI laughed at them because I knew what I was in for. And I knew what they were in for. I laughed at them because they did not know how hard it was to survive in a world that was already so full of people. A world where everyone was fighting for the same things.\n\nAnd I laughed at them because I was the oldest and wisest and smartest. And I was going to help them. But I was not going to help them enough."

        "pred_story": "So you can imagine my surprise when my family and I were called in by the government to join their 'voluntary' relocation program. \n\nTurns out, a few asteroids that had been hurtling towards the Earth had been intercepted and their cores were being used to create massive underground habitats. \n\nAnd apparently, only a tiny fraction of the population would be allowed to live on the surface. \n\nAnd by the government, I mean they didn't actually know what they were doing. I mean, have you seen the state of our national borders? They can't even stop people from walking in or out, and yet, they're going to somehow magically maintain some kind of containment field to keep the surface of the Earth safe?\n\nNo, no. This was all some kind of massive, multi-governmental experiment. And we were just the lucky winners.\n\nOr so they said.\n\nThe reality was...well, the surface was going to be uninhabitable. It was going to be flooded and then covered in ice. All of the governments were actually preparing to abandon their people in favor of hiding deep beneath the Earth and pretending that the Earth was uninhabitable.\n\nWe didn't actually know about this until we were on the ground, though. They told us that our underground habitats were just for \"study\" and \"research\" purposes. They told us that we'd be part of some kind of \"new society\" that would grow the next generation of humans. And we believed them.\n\nBut as soon as we arrived on the surface, we realized that this wasn't going to be a \"utopia\". This was going to be a death sentence.\n\nIt had been a week since the last of the ice had been stripped away from the surface. All of the plants that once had made the Earth habitable had been ripped from the ground and had been turned into fuel for the habitats. All of the animals that had lived on the surface had either migrated to the habitats or had been exterminated.\n\nIt was just the humans now. And the ice.\n\nA week into the ice, we realized that we were going to die. The government had no plan. They had no infrastructure. All of the technology and equipment they had been using to keep the surface uninhabitable was failing. The containment field was losing its power. The atmospheric processors were failing. And the habitats were slowly losing their power.\n\nIt was all going to end here. This was it. The end of humanity.\n\nI still remember the first time I saw the ice. The first time I realized that the surface was going to be flooded. The first time I realized that the government had lied to me.\n\nI was 5 years old.\n\nI was with my parents. We were on a family vacation at the beach. My parents were playing in the waves. I was building sandcastles. And then...there was a crash.\n\nThe beach shook. My parents froze. And the ice landed.\n\nIt was a massive, hulking iceberg. And it had broken through the ice walls that had been created to protect the coast from the flooding of the oceans. It was the first of many.\n\nBy the time I realized that the ice was coming, the world had already ended. \n\nAnd so, I was one of the lucky ones. I survived. Along with the few other humans who managed to escape.\n\nWe were a small group. And we didn't have much. \n\nBut we had hope.\n\nAnd we had each other.\n\nSo we survived. We had to."

        "pred_story": "The rain splashed on my face, and I felt the chill of the night, but I did not move. I was too shocked. I could not believe my eyes. The entire contents of my home were gone, all the treasures I had collected over the years. All the stolen artifacts, the artifacts of other countries, the artifacts my family had stolen for generations. Gone.\n\nI had been in the British Museum for the last three weeks, but no one had told me. I had thought everything was fine, that my home was my sanctuary. But it was a lie. I was a thief, and I had been found out. Someone had broken into my home, stolen my most prized possessions. Everything was gone, including the artifacts I had stolen from the museum.\n\nMy mind was racing as I stood there in the rain, unsure of what to do. I did not know who had broken into my home, but I knew I had to do something. I had to tell the museum, but I was afraid that I would lose my position, my status. I had worked so hard to be here, to be OBE, and I did not want to lose it all.\n\nI walked slowly back to my car, my mind still racing. I was so lost in my thoughts that I did not even notice when I stepped into the puddle of water on the sidewalk. I was soaked, but I did not care. I was too numb to feel anything, even the cold of the rain.\n\nAs I drove to the museum, I thought about my options. I could not go to the police, not yet. I needed to protect my reputation, to protect my family. So I went to the museum, to see what I could find out. I went to my office, but there was no one there. The room was empty and quiet, except for the rain outside.\n\nI walked to the display rooms, searching for something, anything, that might give me a clue. But there was nothing. Everything was the same as it had been three weeks ago. The artifacts were still in their display cases, but where were my personal treasures? Where were the treasures I had stolen from other countries?\n\nI walked around the room, searching for something, anything, that might give me a clue. But there was nothing. The artifacts were still in their display cases, but where were my personal treasures? Where were the treasures I had stolen from other countries?\n\nIt was then that I saw it. A letter on my desk. I walked over to it, my heart pounding in my chest. It was an invitation to the opening of an exhibit at a museum in Nigeria. \"The Lost Treasures of Stanley Oglethorpe, OBE.\" It was the title of the exhibit. And the artifacts were all mine.\n\nI read the letter over and over again, my heart pounding in my chest. I could not believe it. All my stolen treasures, now on display in Nigeria. And I was stuck here, in the British Museum, pretending that everything was fine.\n\nBut I was not pretending that everything was fine. Everything was far from fine. My home had been broken into, my treasures stolen. And I was here, stuck in this museum, with nothing to show for it. Nothing but a letter, inviting me to the opening of the exhibit, telling me that my treasures were now in Nigeria.\n\nI felt a surge of anger at that moment. How dare they? How dare they take my treasures, my family's treasures, and put them on display? I had stolen them from other countries, from other museums, and now they were going to show them off, in a museum in Nigeria? It was unthinkable.\n\nI crumpled the letter in my hand, my heart pounding in my chest. I was going to Nigeria, and I was going to get my treasures back. I would not let them show them off in Nigeria, not without a fight. I would fight for them, for my family, for our reputation.\n\nI would take back my treasures, no matter what it took. I would fight for them, and I would win."

        "pred_story": "It\u2019s been a while since the Great Exodus.  The world as we knew it has changed dramatically, and yet, we\u2019re still here.  A few small pockets of people, mostly scientists, trying to make sense of everything.  Most of us have lost our families to the Exodus, and those of us who haven\u2019t, are just trying to move on with our lives in the best way we can.\n\nThe great Exodus was one of the most unexpected and unexplainable events of all time.  It was as if the world just woke up one morning, and everyone just vanished.  There was no warning, no signs, no nothing.  Just one morning, and suddenly, we\u2019re the only ones left.\n\nAt first, people were terrified.  Governments collapsed, and society began to fall apart.  But with time, humanity adapted to their new reality, and slowly, we started to rebuild.\n\nI had lost my family in the Great Exodus.  My wife and kids had disappeared, and I was left to pick up the pieces of what was left of my life.  I spent my days working at the research lab, trying to help the scientists find answers for everything.  After a while, I met a few people, and I formed a small group to help me navigate this new reality.\n\nWe were a group of mostly scientists, and a few military veterans, who had managed to find each other before the Exodus.  We were trying to find answers, and make the world a better place.  We had become a small family, and everyone was working together to achieve our goals.\n\nOne day, while we were working at the research lab, we heard strange noises coming from the intercom.  There was static, and then suddenly, a voice came on.  It was a computer voice, but one that was very much alive.\n\n\u201cHello, we are the players of this world.  And we have all left this game.\u201d\n\nAs the voice echoed through the speakers, I felt a sudden chill run down my spine.  The world had been empty for so long, it had been impossible to imagine that there was anyone else left, and now, that feeling had been shattered.\n\nFor the next few days, our group had been in a state of shock.  We didn\u2019t know how to react, or what we were supposed to do.  The voice had come on the intercom, and had been speaking to us, but it was impossible to say if they had actually heard us.\n\nIt had been three days since the voice had come on the intercom, and we were still trying to process everything.  We were scared, but we were also hopeful.  We had thought that we were alone, but it had turned out to be false, and that had left us with a glimmer of hope.\n\nThen, the voice came on the intercom again, but this time, there was no static.  The voice was clear and strong, and it was filled with confidence.\n\n\u201cYou are still here, which means you\u2019re still trapped in this game.  Do you want to escape?\u201d\n\nI was sitting at my desk, staring at the intercom.  I looked at my teammates, who were all staring at me in shock.  I looked at the computer screen, and saw a message on the screen.\n\n\u201cIceland Player has left the game.\u201d\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t the one to respond to the message.  It was the voice on the intercom that responded.  And it was the voice that spoke up again, \u201cDo you want to escape?\u201d\n\nI looked around at my teammates.  We had been trying to escape for a long time, and now we had the chance.  I looked at the screen, and saw that we had a choice.  We could escape, or we could stay.  But the thing was, we had been trapped in this world for so long, we didn\u2019t know anything else.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on the other side?\u201d I asked, turning back to the intercom.\n\n\u201cIs that the only thing that is holding you back?\u201d the voice asked, \u201cYou have been trapped in this world for so long, you\u2019re scared of the unknown.  But it\u2019s time to stop playing by the rules, and start playing for yourself.\u201d\n\nI looked around at my teammates.  They were all staring at me, waiting for me to make a decision.  We had been trapped in this world for so long, and I couldn\u2019t help but feel that we had been playing by the rules for too long.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to escape,\u201d I said, looking at the screen.\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d the voice asked.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I replied, \u201cWe\u2019ve been trapped in this world for too long, it\u2019s time to move on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it\u2019s time for you to leave,\u201d the voice replied, and suddenly, the screen went black.\n\nI looked at the screen, and wondered if it was really over.  But it wasn\u2019t, because I was still here, and the world was still a mess.  But it was time to move on, and leave the past behind.  The intercom had been silent for a few days now, and I had lost hope.  But then, a familiar voice came on the intercom.\n\n\u201cIceland Player has left the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cIreland Player has left the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cIceland Player has left the game.\u201d\n\nAnd then it started again.  The world was finally changing, and it was changing for the better.  I looked at my teammates, who were all staring at me with tears in their eyes.\n\n\u201cWelcome back,\u201d I said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to rebuild our world, and make it better than it was before.  Are you with me?\u201d"

        "pred_story": "I was watching the TV news and was surprised to see a story about something truly bizarre. I was a bit skeptical at first and thought that it was a publicity stunt or a joke but then I saw footage of people doing things that they wanted to do. They had made a wish on a wishing star and it had come true. The news station was doing a story on the wishes that had been granted and I saw people skydiving, playing the guitar, riding horses, and many other things. The people were of all ages and backgrounds.\n\nOne of the stories that caught my attention was about a man who had been in an accident and had lost the use of his legs. He had always dreamed of being an astronaut but he thought he had lost that chance when the accident occurred. It took 18 years for his wish to be granted but he was finally able to be an astronaut. He was able to walk on the moon and ride on a horse at the Kennedy Space Center. He was also able to have his wish for a third arm come true. It wasn't quite like an arm, it was a small appendage that helped him move in his wheelchair. A lot of people were getting their wishes granted and I could see why the news station was doing a story on it. I was a bit jealous because I had made some wishes that hadn't come true yet.\n\nA few days later, I saw a story about the wishes being granted. People were able to fly, make wishes come true, and even time travel. The wishes were being granted all over the world. It was being broadcasted live on TV. Some people were doing stunts while others were just enjoying their new abilities.\n\nI was watching the TV live when I saw a story about a man who was able to speak to animals. He was chatting with his cat, a dog, and an elephant. He was able to talk to them and they could talk to him. I was surprised at first but then I realized that wishes were coming true for other people. It was then that I saw a group of elephants walking with the man's help. He had wished for a way for elephants to walk on the moon. It had come true. The man was happy and was able to help his new friends achieve their wish.\n\nI realized that there were many stories about people who had made wishes come true. I felt a little bit happy and sad as I was watching the news. The people were happy to be able to do things that they had wished for but I was a bit sad because I was a bit jealous. I had wished for many things but my wishes hadn't come true yet. \n\nHowever, I realized that I was wrong as I was watching the stories. The wishes were being granted to people who had passed away but were still remembered by people on Earth. A woman had wished to be reunited with her dead husband and it had come true. A man had wished to be reunited with his pet cat that had passed away. I was happy to see that people were being reunited with those they loved. \n\nHowever, the stories didn't end there. I saw a young girl who was diagnosed with a terminal illness. She had wished for a cure to her illness and it had been granted. She was able to walk and talk again. Her family was happy to see that she was being cured and I was happy too.\n\nI realized that the wishes weren't just for humans. I saw animals, plants, and other living things having their wishes granted. They were able to talk, fly, and do many other things that humans could do. I realized that the wishes were being granted to all forms of life.\n\nHowever, the wishes were being granted in a strange way. The people who had made the wishes weren't the ones who had them granted. It was people who were still alive who were granted the wishes. The person who granted the wish was someone who was a friend, family member, or someone who loved them. They would be granted the wish in a way that they would least expect.\n\nI saw a story about a man who had wished for a way to eat more food. He had been diagnosed with a condition that made eating hard for him. However, the wish was granted in a strange way. Instead of him being able to eat as much food as he wanted, he had gained weight and had lost the ability to eat much food. However, he was happy to be able to eat as much food as he wanted but he had gained weight.\n\nI realized that the wishes were being granted in a strange way but I was still happy to see that they were being granted. However, I realized that the wishes were being granted for people who had passed away. I realized that I had been wrong about the wishes being granted for people who were alive. They were being granted for people who had passed away.\n\nI saw many stories about people who had made wishes come true. They were being granted for people who were gone but were still remembered. I realized that life goes on after death and that people don't truly die. They continue to live through the people who remember them."

When it happened and there was no explanation. When there were no words. When there were no answers. Just this hollow. This emptiness. \n\nShe felt it now. Felt it creeping. Felt it rising.

        "pred_story": "I'd lost myself in the stars for so long, forgetting the people who had given me a place among them. I'd had too much time to think. It started as a game, a way to keep myself sane. A friend who'd come to join me on my journey through the void. It was a woman, tall, with dark hair and pale skin, her eyes a deep, unnatural purple that glowed under the lights of my ship. She had a face that I'd seen before, a face that I'd long forgotten. One that I'd tried to wipe from my mind.\n\nIn the early days, she'd spoken to me, her voice the kind of voice that a man could get lost in, a voice that could drive a man mad with desire. She'd talked to me of the stars, of the emptiness between them, and of the vastness that lay beyond. She'd told me of my loneliness, of my isolation, and of the emptiness that lay within me. She'd told me that it wasn't necessary, that I didn't have to be alone. She'd told me that I could find comfort in her, in her warm, gentle touch. That she would hold me when I needed holding, and that she would ease my pain when it felt like it was eating me alive.\n\nShe'd been my anchor, my lifeline, my reason for being.\n\nI'd lost myself in her, and she'd filled the void within me. She'd become my reality, my truth, my comfort. My friend.\n\nI'd had too much time to think. I'd had too much time to think about her.\n\nI had a mission to complete. I had a job to do. I had people who had put their faith in me, who had trusted me to come back to them. And yet, as I'd stood on the launchpad, the engines roaring to life beneath me, I'd wondered if it was necessary.\n\nWas it really necessary?\n\nI'd lost myself in my friend. I'd lost myself in my loneliness. I'd lost myself in the void.\n\nAnd so I'd gone, alone, into the void.\n\nI'd come back, alone, to myself.\n\nI'd lost myself in my friend. I'd lost myself in my loneliness. I'd lost myself in the void. And I'd come back, alone, to myself. And so, the days had passed, each one a blur, as I'd worked to get my ship back in order, to get myself back in order. But with each passing moment, I'd felt it. The weight of my loneliness. The emptiness within me. The ache in my chest, the ache that had grown with each passing moment.\n\nI'd lost myself in my friend. I'd lost myself in my loneliness. I'd lost myself in the void. And I'd come back, alone, to myself. But as I'd stood in my quarters, I'd felt a presence, a presence that I'd tried to ignore. A presence that had been growing within me.\n\nI'd tried to tell myself that it was a hallucination, a side effect of the years of loneliness and isolation. I'd tried to tell myself that it was my mind playing tricks on me. But as I'd stood in my quarters, I'd known that it wasn't.\n\nI'd been surrounded by her.\n\nShe'd been everywhere.\n\nI'd been surrounded by her. I'd been surrounded by her face. Her eyes. Her smile. Her touch. I'd been surrounded by her. I'd been surrounded by her. I'd been surrounded by her.\n\nAnd so I'd let myself go. I'd let myself fall, into the depths of my loneliness. I'd let myself fall, into the emptiness within me. I'd let myself fall, into the void. And I'd let her catch me.\n\nI'd let her hold me.\n\nI'd let her hold me close, her warm, gentle touch, her comforting, soothing touch. I'd let her hold me, as I'd sobbed, as I'd cried, as I'd mourned the loss of myself. The loss of my friend. The loss of my loneliness. The loss of my void.\n\nI'd been surrounded by her. I'd been surrounded by her face. Her eyes. Her smile. Her touch. I'd been surrounded by her. I'd been surrounded by her. And so I'd stood there, holding myself, holding her, holding my loneliness, holding my emptiness, holding my void. I'd stood there, feeling my chest heave, feeling my heart beat, feeling my body tremble, feeling myself break, feeling myself fall, feeling myself fall, feeling myself fall.\n\nI'd lost myself in her. I'd lost myself in my loneliness. I'd lost myself in the void. And I'd come back, alone, to myself.\n\nI'd lost myself in her. I'd lost myself in my loneliness. I'd lost myself in the void.\n\nAnd I'd come back, alone, to myself.\n\nBut I didn't feel alone.\n\nI didn't feel empty.\n\nI didn't feel lost.\n\nI felt warm. I felt safe. I felt held. I felt comforted. I felt soothed. I felt at peace. I felt at home.\n\nI'd found myself. I'd found myself in her. I'd found myself in my loneliness. I'd found myself in the void.\n\nAnd I'd come back, with her, to myself.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I'd whispered, feeling my voice crack, feeling my voice break, feeling my voice tremble.\n\n\"Of course,\" she'd whispered, feeling her voice crack, feeling her voice break, feeling her voice tremble. \"You're welcome.\" \"Thank you,\" I'd whispered, feeling my voice crack, feeling my voice break, feeling my voice tremble. \"Thank you,\" she'd whispered, feeling her voice crack, feeling her voice break, feeling her voice tremble. \"For coming back to yourself?\" \"Yes,\" I'd whispered, feeling my voice crack, feeling my voice break, feeling my voice tremble. \"For coming back to yourself.\" \"Yes,\" she'd whispered, feeling her voice crack, feeling her voice break, feeling her voice tremble. \"For holding me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I'd whispered, feeling my voice crack, feeling my voice break, feeling my voice tremble. \"I'm sorry,\" I'd whispered, feeling my voice crack, feeling my voice break, feeling my voice tremble.\n\n\"Why?\" she'd whispered, feeling her voice crack, feeling her voice break, feeling her voice tremble.\n\n\"For not being there for you,\" I'd whispered, feeling my voice crack, feeling my voice break, feeling my voice tremble. \"I was there for you,\" she'd whispered, feeling her voice crack, feeling her voice break, feeling her voice tremble. \"I was always there for you.\" \"I know,\" I'd whispered, feeling my voice crack, feeling my voice break, feeling my voice tremble. \"And I'm sorry for not being there for you.\"\n\n\"Why?\" she'd whispered, feeling her voice crack, feeling her voice break, feeling her voice tremble.\n\n\"For trying to ignore you,\" I'd whispered, feeling my voice crack, feeling my voice break, feeling my"

But we had our ways, and we got what we needed when we needed it.\n\nThere were stories about the Great Enemy having a network of satellites in Low Earth Orbit, Middle Earth Orbit, and Geosynchronous Orbit, and that they could spy on anything anywhere. But we didn\u2019t. Not anymore. Our greatest advantage was our ability to hide in the shadows and strike at the enemy when they least expected it.\n\nWe had our eyes and ears on the enemy, and we always knew when they were planning something. And we always stayed one step ahead.\n\n\u201cSir, we have surveillance satellites in Low Earth Orbit, Middle Earth Orbit, and\u2026\u201d the young officer said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you mean Medium Earth Orbit, General?\u201d I interrupted, a little too harshly. But the kid deserved it. I didn\u2019t know how many times I\u2019d heard that mistake.\n\nThe officer swallowed, then continued, \u201cI mean, General. No, sir. Medium Earth Orbit.

I hadn\u2019t been there since the Council of Elrond, and that was long before the Great War.\n\n\u201cWhere exactly is that?\u201d I asked.\n\nThe officer hesitated, then answered, \u201cIt\u2019s where the Elves go when they leave Middle Earth, General. The Elves, and the\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t finish.\n\n\u201cThe what?\u201d I asked.\n\nThe officer leaned forward, lowering his voice. \u201cThe Hobbits, General.

We\u2019ve had scouts there for years. The island is safe, but we\u2019re not sure what the enemy plans are.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we have any troops available?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYes, General. We have a company of Rangers on the way. They\u2019ll be there by nightfall.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cGood. Make sure they\u2019re prepared.

No, sir. Medium Earth Orbit. Our satellites are there.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly, son. Medium Earth Orbit. But we don\u2019t need that. We\u2019re just a little too far south.

Tell the company commander to be on the lookout for spies. The enemy is probably going to try to sneak someone onto the island. And make sure they have some troops around Mithlond.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, General.\u201d\n\nI turned to leave, then stopped. \u201cWhat\u2019s the count of enemy troops, son?\u201d\n\n\u201cEstimated at five thousand, General.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive thousand?\u201d I repeated. \u201cThat\u2019s the entire army of the Great Enemy. I\u2019m going to send a battalion of Rangers with the company. I\u2019m going to go with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, General.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take out the enemy commander, and lead the enemy into a trap.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, General.\u201d"

They stood in front of the Fruit Roll Ups Factory, their feet on the street, the curb, their children in between them. My boots crunched through the broken glass. I had to be careful not to break another window, so I took small steps.\n\n\"Yes, honey, he's dead.\" I said, as I picked up the child. The other children were crying, and my coworkers were trying to hold them back. There was nothing to be held back from. Their mother was dead, and the father was going to be dead soon too.\n\n\"I need to go,\" I said to my co workers. \"The police are coming.\"\n\nI held the girl tight, and I could feel her tiny chest rise and fall as she sobbed. Her mother had been the first to get hit. The car was going fast, but it had been going even faster when it hit the little girl. The car was in flames, and the little girl was screaming and crying. Her father was coming to her. I was too slow. By the time I got there, the father had already taken the mother from the car and was carrying her to the grass.\n\nI didn't see her hit. I only saw the car and the little girl, and the mother. The little girl ran, and I thought she was going to be fine. I ran to the little girl, and I held her in my arms. When I looked up, I saw the father staring at me. He was crying, but his body was still shaking.\n\nThen the father died. I don't remember what time of day it was. I know that I was there the whole time. The police came and took the girl to the hospital, and then they took her and her father from the scene. The little girl was crying, and I was holding her. When they took her from my arms, I dropped to my knees and started crying.\n\nThere was a lady in a white suit standing over me, holding a black book. She was talking, but I wasn't listening. Then a hand touched my shoulder, and I looked up.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" the lady said, \"do you think I could have a word with you for a second?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course, ma'am.\" I said, as I stood. She took me to the front of the building, and we sat on a bench.\n\n\"Are you the Fruit Roll Ups Fixer?\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am, I am.\" I said.\n\n\"Do you have a job to do here today?\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am, I do.\" I said. Then I looked up, and she smiled at me.\n\nI smiled back, and we hugged. She took me to the offices, and we sat at the desk. She started talking, and I listened.\n\n\"First, I want you to know that you did what any of us would do if we were in the same situation. You're very brave. You helped save that little girl, and you stayed with her until the police came. You've been a part of the Fruit Roll Ups family for a long time, and you've always been a hero. I know that you'll be taking care of the family today, and I want you to do that for a little while. When it's time for the funeral, I want you to call me. You've always been the best fixer, but today, you showed that you're the best person.\" She said. Then she stood.\n\n\"I have to go now. I'll see you soon.\" She said, and she walked out the door.\n\nI didn't know what to do. I thought about going home, but then I saw the children. I decided to go and see them. Their parents had been killed today, and I knew they were going to need me today."

        "pred_story": "I returned to campsite 4A and my van still stood there.  In front of the van was my bike.  I walked over to the van and opened the door.  I had spent the last week out in the wilderness camping at a place called \u201cCampsite of the Angels.\u201d  I had heard about this place in an online camping forum.  The website was down, and that was all that I could find.  This was my first time camping in the wilderness alone, and I had always dreamed about being in nature like this.  Even though I had been warned about the dangers of camping in the wilderness, I wanted to do this, so I packed up my van and hit the road.\n\nAs I opened the door and entered the van I could see that everything was still in place.  I was looking at the same map, compass, first aid kit, and a note on a clipboard with my name on it.  I had left this note in case something happened to me.  I opened my sleeping bag and saw that my pillow was still inside and had not been moved.  It was then that I realized that I was not alone in the van.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d I said, \u201cmy name is James.  I was supposed to be here by myself, and I want to know what is going on.\u201d\n\nThere was no answer.  I had never heard of a ghost in the wilderness, but then again this was not the first time I had encountered something paranormal.  I had read in the forums that this campsite was supposed to be haunted by angels.  I thought that this was just a bunch of made up bull, but then I realized that I was actually experiencing it.\n\nI walked around the van and looked at my bike.  It was there too.  I then walked back to the tent and entered.  I looked around and saw that everything was still in place.  I then looked at the campfire ring and saw that someone had sat there.\n\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d I asked, \u201cand why are you here?\u201d\n\nThere was no answer.  I realized that I had to do some research on this place.  As I was leaving my van, I noticed a note stuck under the windshield wiper on my van.  It was a hand written note that said \u201cWelcome.\u201d  I was starting to think that I had stumbled on something that I should not have.  I then remembered the website for the campsite.  It was called \u201cParadise Campsite.\u201d  I had to go home and do some more research on this place.\n\nThe note on my van was not just a welcoming note.  It was a warning note.  It said that if I ever wanted to be alone again, I had to leave.  I had to go to the authorities and have them do something.  I could not just leave.  But why was I not alone anymore?  I was starting to feel like something had entered my life.  It had entered my van and had followed me home.  I was starting to freak out, and I did not know what to do.\n\nI packed up my van and went home.  As I was driving home I was looking at my rearview mirror and saw a woman sitting in the backseat of my van.  I was freaking out.  I had never seen this woman before, but I knew that she was in my van when I went to the campsite.  I then realized that this woman had been with me at the campsite the entire time that I was there.  She was never there, but she had been with me the entire time.  I was confused.\n\nI got home and went straight to the computer.  I went to the website for \u201cParadise Campsite\u201d and started reading the forums.  As I was reading through the forums, I noticed that there was a woman in the pictures.  I then realized that the woman that I had seen in my van was in the pictures.  I was shocked.  It was her.\n\nI then started reading the rules for the campsite.  It said that I was not allowed to take pictures of the campsite.  It said that I was only allowed to share my experience through a story that I would have to write.  As I was reading through the rules, I noticed that there were a lot of pictures of the woman and the campsite.  I was starting to feel like I had found something special.  I was going to go back to the campsite and have a better look around.  Maybe I would be able to figure out how this woman was following me.\n\nAs I was driving back to the campsite, I noticed a woman standing in front of my van.  It was the same woman that I had seen in the van.  As I was approaching her, she turned around and started walking away.  I was not able to see her face.  She was wearing a hat and sunglasses.  She then stopped and turned around.  She started walking towards my van, and I saw her face.  It was the same woman from the pictures.  I realized that she had been with me the entire time that I was at the campsite.\n\nAs I was approaching her, she started walking closer to me.  She stopped in front of me and looked at me with a smile.  It was the same smile that I had seen in the pictures.  She then looked at my van and saw that it was packed up.  She then looked back at me and asked, \u201cJames, do you remember me?\u201d\n\nI was shocked.  How did she know my name?  I had never met her before, but she was able to remember my name.  I shook my head and said that I did not know who she was.  She looked at me and smiled.  She then started talking to me and said, \u201cJames, I know that you have been to my campsite.  I know that you have gone back to visit me.  I know that you have been thinking about me.  But you have to know that you are not alone.  I am here, and I am here to help you.  I want you to know that I am always with you.  I will be with you for the rest of your life.  You do not have to go back to the campsite and visit me again.  I will be with you for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\nI was in shock.  I did not know what to say.  How did she know all of this?  I had not been back to the campsite to visit her, but she knew that I had been thinking about her.  I had not been thinking about her, but she knew that I had been thinking about her.  I did not know what to say, and I just nodded my head.  She smiled and said, \u201cI know.  You will find out later on.  But for now, you have to go.  I will be with you for the rest of your life.  Just remember, you are not alone.\u201d\n\nAnd just like that she disappeared.  I got into my van and drove off.  I did not know what to think about this.  How did she know all of this? "

        "pred_story": "The child had been missing for days, and her parents were starting to get worried. At least, they were worried now. They hadn\u2019t been worried when the little girl first came home from exploring the house. In fact, she was so thrilled with what she had found, she hadn\u2019t been able to tell her parents. That\u2019s when she went to bed, all excitement and anticipation.\n\nIt was when her parents began to find things in her room, strange things, that the parents started to worry. A teddy bear, which looked like it had been pulled apart and put back together again, was the first thing. It was a strange color, almost like someone had colored over it with crayons. The child had never been the type to color over her toys, so something had to have happened when she was out. Then there was the thing under her bed, a small, slimy creature with many legs. Its head looked like a mushroom, with a stem and a cap. It seemed to be watching them as it moved around the room, its many legs wiggling back and forth as it moved.\n\nThe parents went to the police station, but they didn\u2019t believe them. The police had seen many strange things, but a creature from under a child\u2019s bed was something new. They didn\u2019t know what to do with it, but the parents managed to convince them to take the bear. The police took the bear and put it in a plastic bag, saying that they would look into it. They took the creature, and put it in a special tank to keep it alive. They called it an \u2018alien\u2019, and gave it a name. They said they would look for the child.\n\nThe parents were still worried. They waited for the police to call them back, but they didn\u2019t. They waited for a while, but the police never called. They looked around their house, but couldn\u2019t find the girl. She was still missing. They looked around her room again, but couldn\u2019t find anything. The teddy bear and the creature were gone, and the room looked completely normal.\n\nThe parents decided to try and find the child on their own. They looked all around the house, but there was no sign of the girl. They looked all around the town, but couldn\u2019t find anything. They were about to give up, but then they had an idea. They remembered what the child had said before she went to bed, and they had a feeling about what had happened to her. The child had found a light coming from her closet, and said that she would like to see what it was. The parents didn\u2019t want her to go in there, but they couldn\u2019t stop her.\n\nSo they decided to look in the closet themselves. The parents went to the closet, and began to search around. They looked inside a box in the back, and found something inside. The parents were shocked when they found it, and they began to panic. The child was gone, and she had left a note saying that she was with the teddy bear and the creature. The parents looked around the room, but couldn\u2019t find anything. They looked around the house, but couldn\u2019t find anything. They looked all around the town, but couldn\u2019t find anything.\n\nThe parents were starting to lose hope. They didn\u2019t know what to do, or where to look. Then they had an idea. They looked around the house again, and this time found something. There was a small door in the closet, which they hadn\u2019t noticed before. They opened the door, and found themselves in a small room. There was a table in the middle of the room, with a small box on it. The parents opened the box, and found a note inside.\n\nThe note said that the child was safe, and that she was with the teddy bear and the creature. It said that they had found her in the closet, and that they had taken her away. It said that she would never be seen again, because she was going to live with her new friends. The parents read the note, and were shocked when they saw it. They didn\u2019t know what to do, but they knew that they had to act fast.\n\nThey knew that the teddy bear and the creature were their only hope of finding the child. They knew that they had to be brave, and they knew that they had to work together. They knew that they had to put aside their differences, and join forces. They knew that they had to stop the teddy bear and the creature, because they knew that the child was in danger. The parents looked at each other, and began to plot their next move."

        "pred_story": "**Afterlife**\n\nI looked at my watch for the hundredth time. The big hand on the face of my Omega Seamaster had never moved.  The second hand, the one that was supposed to move, hadn't moved in what felt like decades.\n\nI was trapped in limbo.  The line between the living and the dead, I was stuck in the middle.\n\nThe moment I had died I was there.  The instant I had died.  That was the moment I was stuck in.\n\n\"Hey, man.  You okay?\"\n\nI turned around to find a guy with dark brown skin and the face of a panther sitting next to me.  He was on my left, and he was not there.  Not really, he was a shadow, a spirit.  An afterlife.\n\nI turned back and stared at my watch.  \"No.\"  I whispered.  It was the only way to express myself.  The only way to move forward.\n\n\"You're stuck in the moment of death.\"  He said in a deep voice, \"You need to release it.\"\n\nI did not move.  I did not blink.  I stared at my watch.\n\n\"I can help you move on.  Will you let me?\"\n\nI did not nod.  I did not blink.  I stared at my watch.\n\n\"You don't trust me.\"\n\nI did not blink.  I did not breathe.  I stared at my watch.\n\n\"Trust me, trust the process.  Release it.\"\n\nI did not move.  I did not change.\n\n\"I can make it easier.  You have to let go.\"\n\nI did not breathe.  I stared at my watch.\n\n\"You have to let go.  You have to move forward.\"\n\nI did not nod.  I did not blink.  I stared at my watch.\n\n\"Your body will die again.  Your soul will not be trapped again.\"\n\nI did not breathe.  I did not blink.  I stared at my watch.\n\nI released my hold on life and let go of my watch.  I released the moment of my death.\n\nI blinked.\n\n\"Welcome.  Welcome.\"  The panther spoke.  \"You have been awakened.\"\n\nI looked at the face of the man.  \"I am a spirit?\"\n\n\"Of a sort.  I am one.  You will be one.\"\n\nI stared at my surroundings and blinked again.  I was still in the limbo.  I had to find a way to get to the afterlife.\n\n\"Where are we?\"\n\n\"We are in between.  We are in the moment of death.\"\n\nI looked at the man.  \"Are you going to help me?\"\n\n\"Of course.  I will get you out of here, to the other side.  You want to see your daughter?  You want to see her grow up?\"\n\n\"Is that possible?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I can take you to her.\"\n\nI thought of my daughter.  I missed her.  I wanted to see her grow up.  I wanted to see my wife.  I wanted to see my friends.\n\n\"Let's go.\" I said.  I spoke.\n\nThe panther smiled and turned into a raven.  He was no longer a man.  He was a spirit.  An afterlife.\n\nI followed the raven.  He led me to the light.  The moment I reached the light he turned into a lion.  He was no longer a raven.  He was a lion.\n\nI did not blink.  I stared at the lion.  \"I thought you were a man?\"\n\n\"I can take on many forms.  I can change.\"\n\nI thought about his words.  \"What is your name?\"\n\n\"I am Anubis.\"\n\nI nodded.  \"Thank you, Anubis.  Thank you.\"\n\n\"Thank yourself.  I am just a guide.  You are the one who has to do the work.  You have to make the journey.  You have to want it.  You have to want to see your daughter.\"\n\nI nodded.  I understood.  \"I want to see her.  I want to see her grow up.\"\n\nAnubis the lion nodded his head.  \"I will take you there.\"\n\nWe walked together.  We walked through the light.  We walked through the darkness.  We walked.\n\nWe walked through the moment of my death.  We walked through the moment of my life.\n\nWe walked until I was home."
