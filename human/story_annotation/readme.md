# Human Annotation 

Annotation File Path: ```examples/data.json```

There are 30 annotation examples, each of the form: 
1. Writing Prompt: Describes the writing prompt for that story 
2. User Writing Sheet: Analysis of user's story writing skills
3. Story A and Story B: Two stories that are being evaluated

## Task 

1. Evaluate Story A and Story B separately with the User Writing Sheet for every skill mentioned in the sheet by rating on a scale of 1-5 (1 least, 5 highest) based on how closely the story aligns with the User Writing Sheet.
2. Use the annotation files in ```examples/annotation/annotator_x.csv``` to provide your skill-wise annotation for each of the 30 annotation samples.
