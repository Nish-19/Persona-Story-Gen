        "ground_truth": "# Curtain Call for Dr. Dramatis\n\nDr. George Malicetti (formerly known as Dr. Dramatis, Terror of Theater District) was peacefully deadheading his roses when he got The Call.\n\n\u00abGrandpa?\u00bb Sophie\u2019s voice was small, even for a five-year-old. \u00abMs. Primsworth says I can\u2019t be a tree anymore. She says I have to do... backstage.\u00bb\n\nGeorge\u2019s secateurs crushed a perfectly innocent rose stem. In his former life, such an insult would have resulted in a dramatic thunderstorm over the offender\u2019s house for at least a week. But he was retired. Reformed. Respectable.\n\n\u00abTell me everything, mein Schatz,\u00bb he said, already mentally calculating how much of his old equipment was still functional.\n\nApparently, Ms. Primsworth had decided Sophie was \u00abtoo enthusiastic\u00bb about being a tree. \u00abDistracting,\u00bb she\u2019d said. \u00abTrees should be still.\u00bb\n\nGeorge looked at his garden\u2019s prize-winning roses, which definitely didn\u2019t dance in time to classical music when nobody was watching. Absolutely not.\n\n\u00abBackstage is very important,\u00bb he told Sophie, while his free hand typed out a message to his former minions (now running \u201eDramatic Solutions LLC - We Make Your Events Villainously Good\u201c). \u00abIn fact, it\u2019s where the real magic happens.\u00bb\n\n\u00abReally?\u00bb Sophie sniffled.\n\n\u00abOh yes. Now, does your Kindergarten have a loading dock?\u00bb\n\nThree days later, George arrived at Little Sprouts Kindergarten wearing his most normal-looking cardigan (which only had three hidden pockets) and carrying a toolbox that definitely didn\u2019t contain repurposed weather-control miniatures.\n\n\u00abMr. Malicetti!\u00bb Ms. Primsworth\u2019s smile was as plastic as his reformed citizen act. \u00abHow... involved of you to volunteer.\u00bb\n\n\u00abOh, I dabbled in theater back in the day,\u00bb he said, which wasn\u2019t technically a lie. Threatening to destroy the Metropolitan Opera unless they cast his preferred soprano had involved quite a bit of theater.\n\n\u00abWe\u2019re very simple here,\u00bb she said firmly. \u00abJust some cardboard trees and-\u00bb\n\n\u00abBEHOLD!\u00bb George winced. Old habits. More calmly: \u00abI mean, let me show you some sketches.\u00bb\n\nHis old lair\u2019s drafting table had worked overtime. The designs were perfect: elaborate enough to be magical, simple enough to seem possible. Probably.\n\nOver the next week, George deployed every non-lethal trick in his former arsenal. The trees Sophie had wanted to play? They would dance, but only when the script called for it. The enchanted forest would have actual twinkling lights (powered by a scaled-down version of his old death ray, converted to run on AA batteries).\n\nHis old nemesis, Captain Spotlight, now retired and going by Jim from Accounting, spotted him rigging the lighting system.\n\n\u00abDramatis?\u00bb Jim squinted up at the ladder.\n\n\u00abIt\u2019s just George now,\u00bb George said, carefully not activating the trap door under Jim\u2019s feet. \u00abAnd it\u2019s all legitimate.\u00bb\n\nJim watched him install another perfectly-focused spotlight. \u00abYour granddaughter?\u00bb\n\n\u00abSophie. They wouldn\u2019t let her be a tree.\u00bb\n\n\u00abAh.\u00bb Jim nodded sagely. \u00abNeed help with the rigging?\u00bb\n\nTogether, they created effects that would have made Broadway jealous. Everything was technically within budget, if you didn\u2019t ask too many questions about where the \u00abdonated materials\u00bb came from.\n\nSophie thrived backstage. George taught her the basics of theatrical magic - the kind that didn\u2019t require actual weather manipulation. She learned to cue lights, manage scene changes, and coordinate the other children who\u2019d been \u00abrelegated\u00bb to backstage work.\n\nThe night of the show arrived. George sat in the back, officially manning the main controls, unofficially ready to deploy emergency glitter if needed. His daughter and son-in-law were in the audience, unaware that the theatrical genius they were about to witness had anything to do with the father they hadn\u2019t spoken to in years.\n\nThe show began. Trees danced (on cue). Snow fell (hypoallergenic). Fog rolled in (non-toxic). Scene changes happened like magic (literally, but nobody needed to know that).\n\nDuring intermission, he heard Ms. Primsworth telling another teacher, \u00abI had no idea we had such talented backstage children!\u00bb\n\nSophie found him at his control panel. \u00abGrandpa! Did you see? Did you see how everyone clapped when the forest grew?\u00bb\n\n\u00abYou did that perfectly, mein Schatz. Timing is everything in sh- theater.\u00bb\n\nAfter the show, amid the chaos of proud parents and sugar-rushed kindergarteners, George\u2019s daughter approached his control booth.\n\n\u00abDad?\u00bb She looked at the elaborate setup, then at Sophie proudly showing other kids how to work the fog machine. \u00abThis was you?\u00bb\n\n\u00abI just helped with technical things,\u00bb he said. \u00abSophie did all the hard work.\u00bb\n\n\u00abIt\u2019s very... dramatic.\u00bb\n\n\u00abTheater is meant to be dramatic.\u00bb He hesitated. \u00abThe birthday party invitations are still open, you know. For Sophie.\u00bb\n\nShe looked at him for a long moment. \u00abMaybe... maybe we could do coffee first?\u00bb\n\nGeorge smiled. No maniacal laughter, no thunder crashes. Just a grandfather who\u2019d learned that the best special effects were the ones that brought people together.\n\nThough he did treat himself to one tiny lightning flash on the drive home. For old times\u2018 sake.\n\nAt the next parent-teacher meeting, Ms. Primsworth announced that the spring show would be \u00absomething simpler.\u00bb But by then, the backstage crew had a waiting list.\n\nAnd if anyone noticed that the Little Sprouts Kindergarten had better theatrical effects than the Metropolitan Opera that season, well, that was probably just a coincidence.\n\nProbably.",
        "story_a": "The scent of freshly baked cookies filled the air as Harold stirred his tea, watching the neighborhood kids play in his front yard. Life had finally slowed down, giving him peace in his twilight years. No one suspected that the gentle, silver-haired man with a penchant for gardening had once been the feared supervillain known as The Obsidian Shadow.\n\nYears of wreaking havoc, of grand schemes and daring escapes, were behind him. He had traded his costume for cardigans, his sinister plots for Sudoku puzzles. Harold had found solace in the mundane, and he cherished every moment of it.\n\nThat tranquility shattered with the ring of the phone one crisp autumn afternoon.\n\n\"Mr. Blackwell?\" The voice on the other end was strained, a stark contrast to the usual friendly tone of his daughter, Emily. \"It's Emily. Dad, something's happened. It's Jacob. He... he\u2019s missing.\"\n\nHarold's heart sank. Jacob, his six-year-old grandson, was the light of his life. He could hear the panic in Emily's voice, and his own fears echoed back from his past. He knew that even in retirement, the world had not forgotten his legacy.\n\n\"Emily, stay calm. Have you called the police?\" Harold asked, trying to keep his voice steady.\n\n\"Yes, but they haven't found anything yet,\" she replied, her voice breaking. \"Dad, I need you.\"\n\nThose words triggered something deep within him. The Obsidian Shadow had been a persona he\u2019d buried, but for his family, he would unearth it.\n\nHarold hung up the phone and walked to the hidden panel behind his bookshelf. With a creak, it swung open, revealing the dark, sleek costume he hadn\u2019t worn in decades. He donned it, feeling the familiar weight of the obsidian armor, the snug fit of the mask. The transformation was complete; Harold Blackwell was gone, replaced by The Obsidian Shadow.\n\nHe moved swiftly, his senses heightened and body responsive despite the years. The trail to Jacob was faint, but Harold had always been a master of tracking. He followed the clues, piecing together the puzzle that led him to an old, abandoned factory on the outskirts of the city.\n\nThe place was a relic of another era, much like himself. Rusted machinery loomed like skeletal remains, and the air was thick with dust and decay. Harold's eyes, sharp and calculating, scanned the scene. He spotted a faint trail of footprints leading deeper into the factory.\n\n\"Jacob!\" he called out, his voice echoing through the empty halls.\n\nA faint whimper responded, guiding him forward. He moved with purpose, his steps silent and swift. The old skills came flooding back, muscle memory guiding him as he navigated the labyrinthine corridors.\n\nAt last, he found Jacob, tied to a chair in a dimly lit room. The boy's eyes widened with recognition and relief as Harold approached.\n\n\"Grandpa!\" Jacob exclaimed, his voice muffled by the gag.\n\nHarold quickly untied him, pulling him into a tight embrace. \"It's okay, Jacob. I've got you.\"\n\nBut before they could leave, a shadowy figure emerged from the darkness, clapping slowly. \"The Obsidian Shadow. I never thought I'd see the day when you'd come out of retirement.\"\n\nHarold turned to face the newcomer, his eyes narrowing. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Just a fan,\" the man replied with a smirk. \"A fan who wants to see if the legend still has what it takes.\"\n\nHarold recognized the challenge in the man's eyes. He had faced countless adversaries in his time, and this one was no different. \"You're making a mistake,\" Harold said, his voice cold and steady.\n\nThe fight was swift and brutal. Harold's movements were precise, his attacks calculated. He was older, yes, but experience had honed him into a formidable opponent. The man was skilled, but he underestimated the ferocity of a grandfather protecting his family.\n\nIn the end, the man lay defeated, gasping for breath. Harold stood over him, his chest heaving. \"Tell your friends,\" he said, his voice low and dangerous, \"The Obsidian Shadow is done with villainy. But mess with my family, and you\u2019ll wish you never crossed my path.\"\n\nWith Jacob in his arms, Harold walked out of the factory, leaving the past behind once more. As they stepped into the sunlight, Jacob looked up at him with awe. \"Grandpa, you're a hero.\"\n\nHarold smiled, ruffling Jacob's hair. \"No, Jacob. I'm just your grandpa.\"\n\nBut as they made their way home, Harold couldn't help but feel a renewed sense of purpose. The world may have known him as a villain, but for his family, he would always be their protector. And that was a role he would never retire from.",
        "story_b": "## The Gauntlet of Forgotten Glories\n\nIn the quiet suburbs of Greenville, Mr. Mortimer Harkness was known as the friendly retiree who spent his days gardening and spoiling his grandchildren. Little did they know, he once ruled the city as \"The Midnight Phantom,\" a super villain whose name struck fear into the hearts of millions. That life was behind him, or so he thought.\n\nOne crisp autumn evening, Mortimer was trimming his azaleas when his granddaughter, Lily, burst into the garden, tears streaming down her face. \"Grandpa, someone broke into our house! They took Mom's jewelry and my laptop!\"\n\nMortimer's peaceful retirement shattered like a glass window. His family was his sanctuary, and now it had been violated. The Midnight Phantom stirred within him, shaking off the dust of decades.\n\n\"Who did this, Lily?\" he asked, his voice calm but his eyes cold with determination.\n\n\"They left a note,\" she sniffled, handing him a crumpled piece of paper. It read: \"Greetings from The Shadow Syndicate. We have your valuables. Pay up, or else.\"\n\nThe name sent a shiver down Mortimer's spine. The Shadow Syndicate\u2014his old nemesis. They had resurfaced, and they dared to threaten his family. It was time to don the cloak of nostalgia and revisit the fortress of solitude, now a relic of bygone schemes.\n\nIn the basement, hidden behind a false wall, lay his secret lair. Dusty and neglected, it held the remnants of his villainous past: gadgets, costumes, and the AI assistant known as \"The Guardian of Shadows.\"\n\n\"Ah, Master Harkness, it's been ages,\" the AI chimed in, its voice tinged with sarcasm. \"Dusted off the old cape, have we?\"\n\n\"Enough with the commentary, Guardian,\" Mortimer snapped, though a smile tugged at his lips. \"We have work to do.\"\n\nHe spent the night training, upgrading his old gadgets, and reacquainting himself with the tools of his trade. The lair buzzed with activity as he reactivated the security systems and prepared for his comeback. The Guardian of Shadows offered humorous commentary along the way, a constant reminder of the absurdity of his situation.\n\n\"Who knew retirement would be more dangerous than my villainous career?\" Mortimer muttered, strapping on his gauntlets.\n\nThe next day, the news broke: \"Former Villain Back in Action: Neighborhood Watch or Menace?\" The headlines were satirical, critiquing his past and present. Mortimer chuckled at the irony but stayed focused on his mission.\n\nHe tracked the Shadow Syndicate to an abandoned warehouse downtown. The lair, hidden beneath a historical landmark, was a maze of traps and defenses. Mortimer navigated it with ease, his muscle memory guiding him through the dangers. Along the way, he encountered mythical creatures and ancient artifacts\u2014remnants of his old life that now aided his quest.\n\nAt the heart of the lair, he found the Syndicate's leader, a minor demon named Malphas, who had once been his shady financial advisor. \"Mortimer Harkness,\" Malphas sneered, \"I never expected to see you again.\"\n\n\"The feeling's mutual,\" Mortimer replied, his eyes steely. \"You've messed with my family, and now you'll pay.\"\n\nTheir confrontation was both comedic and intense. Malphas, out of practice, struggled to adapt to his role, while Mortimer rediscovered his old skills with surprising ease. They exchanged blows and witty banter, each trying to outwit the other.\n\n\"Time to dust off the old cape\u2014literally,\" Mortimer quipped as he dodged a fireball.\n\nEventually, Mortimer overpowered Malphas, using a combination of old-school methods and upgraded gadgets. He reclaimed the stolen items and ensured the Syndicate's demise. As he stood victorious, he felt a sense of empowerment and rediscovery. The Midnight Phantom was not gone; he had merely evolved.\n\nBack home, Mortimer returned the valuables to his daughter and granddaughter, their faces lighting up with gratitude. \"Grandpa, you're amazing!\" Lily exclaimed, her eyes wide with admiration.\n\n\"Just doing what I had to, sweetheart,\" he replied, ruffling her hair. \"Past villainy does not guarantee future success, but it sure helps.\"\n\nAs he settled back into retirement, Mortimer realized that his journey was far from over. He had found a balance between his past and present, embracing both the peaceful retiree and the determined protector. The Midnight Phantom would always be a part of him, ready to rise whenever his family needed him.\n\nIn the end, Mortimer Harkness was not just a retired super villain; he was a hero in his own right, navigating the absurdities of life with humor, determination, and a touch of whimsy. And as the Guardian of Shadows would say, \"Onward to the next adventure, Master Harkness. The world always needs a bit of midnight magic.\"",

        "story_b": "Harold \"The Havoc\" Hargrove was not your typical retiree. Sure, he spent his mornings tending to his rose garden and his afternoons playing chess with old Mr. Thompson from next door, but behind the serene fa\u00e7ade lay a mind that once masterminded the most audacious heists and escapades the world had ever known. In the small town of Meadowbrook, he was just Harold, the kindly old man with a green thumb and a penchant for baking the best apple pies. Little did his neighbors know, in his youth, he had been The Havoc, a name that still sent shivers down the spines of the world\u2019s greatest heroes.\n\nHis days of villainy were behind him, or so he thought. One sunny afternoon, as he carefully pruned his prized roses, a sleek black car pulled up to his driveway. Out stepped a young man in a suit, his face pallid and eyes frantic. \"Mr. Hargrove,\" he stammered, \"Your family is in danger.\"\n\nHarold\u2019s heart skipped a beat. His daughter, Emily, and his two grandkids were his world. He dropped his shears and hustled inside, the young man following close behind. \"What happened?\" he demanded.\n\nThe man, introducing himself as Agent Collins, quickly explained. \"A rival criminal organization has targeted your daughter to draw you out of retirement. They believe you still have something they want.\"\n\nHarold\u2019s mind raced. He had buried his past deep, but evidently, it wasn\u2019t deep enough. \"What do they want?\" he asked, already knowing the answer.\n\n\"Your old plans,\" Collins replied. \"The blueprints for the Quantum Disruptor. They\u2019re convinced you still have them.\"\n\nHarold had destroyed those plans years ago, but that wouldn\u2019t stop desperate men from believing otherwise. \"Where\u2019s Emily?\" he asked, his voice steely.\n\n\"Safe, for now. But they\u2019re closing in. We need you to come with us.\"\n\nHarold looked around his cozy living room, the walls adorned with family photos and mementos of a life well-lived. His eyes landed on an old chest in the corner, a relic of his past he had hoped never to open again. With a heavy sigh, he walked over and lifted the lid, revealing his old costume\u2014the black and green suit of The Havoc.\n\n\"Time to get the old costume out,\" he muttered.\n\n---\n\nThe van hurtled down the highway, Agent Collins at the wheel and Harold in the back, slipping into his old persona like a well-worn glove. The suit was a bit tight around the middle, and the gadgets seemed almost comically outdated, but it would have to do.\n\nAs they neared the safe house, Collins briefed him on the plan. \"We\u2019ve set up a decoy location to lure the attackers away from your family. You\u2019ll need to outsmart them and lead them into our trap.\"\n\nHarold nodded, his mind already working a mile a minute. \"Leave it to me,\" he said, a wicked grin spreading across his face. \"I\u2019ve got a few tricks left up my sleeve.\"\n\nThe safe house was a nondescript cabin in the woods, surrounded by dense foliage. Inside, Emily and the kids were huddled together, fear etched on their faces. Harold embraced them tightly, feeling a surge of determination. No one messed with his family.\n\n\"Stay here,\" he instructed, \"and don\u2019t open the door for anyone but me.\"\n\nOutside, the night was closing in. Harold set up a series of traps around the perimeter, using his knowledge of the terrain to his advantage. Soon, the sound of approaching footsteps reached his ears. The attackers were here.\n\nFrom the shadows, Harold watched as they triggered his traps one by one\u2014nets, tripwires, and smoke bombs disorienting them. With a final flourish, he activated the old hologram projector, creating multiple illusions of himself that sent the attackers into a frenzy.\n\nUsing the chaos to his advantage, Harold slipped through the shadows, reaching the leader of the group. \"Looking for me?\" he quipped, delivering a swift blow that knocked the man out cold.\n\nThe rest of the attackers, now thoroughly confused and demoralized, were quickly apprehended by Collins and his team. As the dust settled, Harold stood tall, a sense of satisfaction washing over him. He hadn\u2019t lost his touch.\n\nBack at the cabin, Emily and the kids rushed out to embrace him. \"Dad, are you okay?\" Emily asked, tears of relief in her eyes.\n\nHarold smiled, hugging her tightly. \"I\u2019m fine, sweetheart. Just a little trip down memory lane.\"\n\nAs they drove back to Meadowbrook, Harold couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. His old costume might be outdated, and his body might ache in places he didn\u2019t know existed, but some things never changed. The love for his family and the lengths he would go to protect them were as strong as ever.\n\nAnd as for his peaceful retirement? Well, it seemed that even in the twilight of his years, The Havoc still had a few adventures left in him.",

        "ground_truth": "# Curtain Call for Dr. Dramatis\n\nDr. George Malicetti (formerly known as Dr. Dramatis, Terror of Theater District) was peacefully deadheading his roses when he got The Call.\n\n\u00abGrandpa?\u00bb Sophie\u2019s voice was small, even for a five-year-old. \u00abMs. Primsworth says I can\u2019t be a tree anymore. She says I have to do... backstage.\u00bb\n\nGeorge\u2019s secateurs crushed a perfectly innocent rose stem. In his former life, such an insult would have resulted in a dramatic thunderstorm over the offender\u2019s house for at least a week. But he was retired. Reformed. Respectable.\n\n\u00abTell me everything, mein Schatz,\u00bb he said, already mentally calculating how much of his old equipment was still functional.\n\nApparently, Ms. Primsworth had decided Sophie was \u00abtoo enthusiastic\u00bb about being a tree. \u00abDistracting,\u00bb she\u2019d said. \u00abTrees should be still.\u00bb\n\nGeorge looked at his garden\u2019s prize-winning roses, which definitely didn\u2019t dance in time to classical music when nobody was watching. Absolutely not.\n\n\u00abBackstage is very important,\u00bb he told Sophie, while his free hand typed out a message to his former minions (now running \u201eDramatic Solutions LLC - We Make Your Events Villainously Good\u201c). \u00abIn fact, it\u2019s where the real magic happens.\u00bb\n\n\u00abReally?\u00bb Sophie sniffled.\n\n\u00abOh yes. Now, does your Kindergarten have a loading dock?\u00bb\n\nThree days later, George arrived at Little Sprouts Kindergarten wearing his most normal-looking cardigan (which only had three hidden pockets) and carrying a toolbox that definitely didn\u2019t contain repurposed weather-control miniatures.\n\n\u00abMr. Malicetti!\u00bb Ms. Primsworth\u2019s smile was as plastic as his reformed citizen act. \u00abHow... involved of you to volunteer.\u00bb\n\n\u00abOh, I dabbled in theater back in the day,\u00bb he said, which wasn\u2019t technically a lie. Threatening to destroy the Metropolitan Opera unless they cast his preferred soprano had involved quite a bit of theater.\n\n\u00abWe\u2019re very simple here,\u00bb she said firmly. \u00abJust some cardboard trees and-\u00bb\n\n\u00abBEHOLD!\u00bb George winced. Old habits. More calmly: \u00abI mean, let me show you some sketches.\u00bb\n\nHis old lair\u2019s drafting table had worked overtime. The designs were perfect: elaborate enough to be magical, simple enough to seem possible. Probably.\n\nOver the next week, George deployed every non-lethal trick in his former arsenal. The trees Sophie had wanted to play? They would dance, but only when the script called for it. The enchanted forest would have actual twinkling lights (powered by a scaled-down version of his old death ray, converted to run on AA batteries).\n\nHis old nemesis, Captain Spotlight, now retired and going by Jim from Accounting, spotted him rigging the lighting system.\n\n\u00abDramatis?\u00bb Jim squinted up at the ladder.\n\n\u00abIt\u2019s just George now,\u00bb George said, carefully not activating the trap door under Jim\u2019s feet. \u00abAnd it\u2019s all legitimate.\u00bb\n\nJim watched him install another perfectly-focused spotlight. \u00abYour granddaughter?\u00bb\n\n\u00abSophie. They wouldn\u2019t let her be a tree.\u00bb\n\n\u00abAh.\u00bb Jim nodded sagely. \u00abNeed help with the rigging?\u00bb\n\nTogether, they created effects that would have made Broadway jealous. Everything was technically within budget, if you didn\u2019t ask too many questions about where the \u00abdonated materials\u00bb came from.\n\nSophie thrived backstage. George taught her the basics of theatrical magic - the kind that didn\u2019t require actual weather manipulation. She learned to cue lights, manage scene changes, and coordinate the other children who\u2019d been \u00abrelegated\u00bb to backstage work.\n\nThe night of the show arrived. George sat in the back, officially manning the main controls, unofficially ready to deploy emergency glitter if needed. His daughter and son-in-law were in the audience, unaware that the theatrical genius they were about to witness had anything to do with the father they hadn\u2019t spoken to in years.\n\nThe show began. Trees danced (on cue). Snow fell (hypoallergenic). Fog rolled in (non-toxic). Scene changes happened like magic (literally, but nobody needed to know that).\n\nDuring intermission, he heard Ms. Primsworth telling another teacher, \u00abI had no idea we had such talented backstage children!\u00bb\n\nSophie found him at his control panel. \u00abGrandpa! Did you see? Did you see how everyone clapped when the forest grew?\u00bb\n\n\u00abYou did that perfectly, mein Schatz. Timing is everything in sh- theater.\u00bb\n\nAfter the show, amid the chaos of proud parents and sugar-rushed kindergarteners, George\u2019s daughter approached his control booth.\n\n\u00abDad?\u00bb She looked at the elaborate setup, then at Sophie proudly showing other kids how to work the fog machine. \u00abThis was you?\u00bb\n\n\u00abI just helped with technical things,\u00bb he said. \u00abSophie did all the hard work.\u00bb\n\n\u00abIt\u2019s very... dramatic.\u00bb\n\n\u00abTheater is meant to be dramatic.\u00bb He hesitated. \u00abThe birthday party invitations are still open, you know. For Sophie.\u00bb\n\nShe looked at him for a long moment. \u00abMaybe... maybe we could do coffee first?\u00bb\n\nGeorge smiled. No maniacal laughter, no thunder crashes. Just a grandfather who\u2019d learned that the best special effects were the ones that brought people together.\n\nThough he did treat himself to one tiny lightning flash on the drive home. For old times\u2018 sake.\n\nAt the next parent-teacher meeting, Ms. Primsworth announced that the spring show would be \u00absomething simpler.\u00bb But by then, the backstage crew had a waiting list.\n\nAnd if anyone noticed that the Little Sprouts Kindergarten had better theatrical effects than the Metropolitan Opera that season, well, that was probably just a coincidence.\n\nProbably.",
        "story_a": "The scent of freshly baked cookies filled the air as Harold stirred his tea, watching the neighborhood kids play in his front yard. Life had finally slowed down, giving him peace in his twilight years. No one suspected that the gentle, silver-haired man with a penchant for gardening had once been the feared supervillain known as The Obsidian Shadow.\n\nYears of wreaking havoc, of grand schemes and daring escapes, were behind him. He had traded his costume for cardigans, his sinister plots for Sudoku puzzles. Harold had found solace in the mundane, and he cherished every moment of it.\n\nThat tranquility shattered with the ring of the phone one crisp autumn afternoon.\n\n\"Mr. Blackwell?\" The voice on the other end was strained, a stark contrast to the usual friendly tone of his daughter, Emily. \"It's Emily. Dad, something's happened. It's Jacob. He... he\u2019s missing.\"\n\nHarold's heart sank. Jacob, his six-year-old grandson, was the light of his life. He could hear the panic in Emily's voice, and his own fears echoed back from his past. He knew that even in retirement, the world had not forgotten his legacy.\n\n\"Emily, stay calm. Have you called the police?\" Harold asked, trying to keep his voice steady.\n\n\"Yes, but they haven't found anything yet,\" she replied, her voice breaking. \"Dad, I need you.\"\n\nThose words triggered something deep within him. The Obsidian Shadow had been a persona he\u2019d buried, but for his family, he would unearth it.\n\nHarold hung up the phone and walked to the hidden panel behind his bookshelf. With a creak, it swung open, revealing the dark, sleek costume he hadn\u2019t worn in decades. He donned it, feeling the familiar weight of the obsidian armor, the snug fit of the mask. The transformation was complete; Harold Blackwell was gone, replaced by The Obsidian Shadow.\n\nHe moved swiftly, his senses heightened and body responsive despite the years. The trail to Jacob was faint, but Harold had always been a master of tracking. He followed the clues, piecing together the puzzle that led him to an old, abandoned factory on the outskirts of the city.\n\nThe place was a relic of another era, much like himself. Rusted machinery loomed like skeletal remains, and the air was thick with dust and decay. Harold's eyes, sharp and calculating, scanned the scene. He spotted a faint trail of footprints leading deeper into the factory.\n\n\"Jacob!\" he called out, his voice echoing through the empty halls.\n\nA faint whimper responded, guiding him forward. He moved with purpose, his steps silent and swift. The old skills came flooding back, muscle memory guiding him as he navigated the labyrinthine corridors.\n\nAt last, he found Jacob, tied to a chair in a dimly lit room. The boy's eyes widened with recognition and relief as Harold approached.\n\n\"Grandpa!\" Jacob exclaimed, his voice muffled by the gag.\n\nHarold quickly untied him, pulling him into a tight embrace. \"It's okay, Jacob. I've got you.\"\n\nBut before they could leave, a shadowy figure emerged from the darkness, clapping slowly. \"The Obsidian Shadow. I never thought I'd see the day when you'd come out of retirement.\"\n\nHarold turned to face the newcomer, his eyes narrowing. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Just a fan,\" the man replied with a smirk. \"A fan who wants to see if the legend still has what it takes.\"\n\nHarold recognized the challenge in the man's eyes. He had faced countless adversaries in his time, and this one was no different. \"You're making a mistake,\" Harold said, his voice cold and steady.\n\nThe fight was swift and brutal. Harold's movements were precise, his attacks calculated. He was older, yes, but experience had honed him into a formidable opponent. The man was skilled, but he underestimated the ferocity of a grandfather protecting his family.\n\nIn the end, the man lay defeated, gasping for breath. Harold stood over him, his chest heaving. \"Tell your friends,\" he said, his voice low and dangerous, \"The Obsidian Shadow is done with villainy. But mess with my family, and you\u2019ll wish you never crossed my path.\"\n\nWith Jacob in his arms, Harold walked out of the factory, leaving the past behind once more. As they stepped into the sunlight, Jacob looked up at him with awe. \"Grandpa, you're a hero.\"\n\nHarold smiled, ruffling Jacob's hair. \"No, Jacob. I'm just your grandpa.\"\n\nBut as they made their way home, Harold couldn't help but feel a renewed sense of purpose. The world may have known him as a villain, but for his family, he would always be their protector. And that was a role he would never retire from.",
        "story_b": "The afternoon sun cast a warm glow over the garden, where Gerald Thompson knelt beside a row of blooming marigolds. He hummed a tune from an old musical, the melody weaving through the gentle rustle of leaves. Retirement had been a blessing\u2014a chance to cultivate beauty rather than chaos, to nurture life instead of plots for world domination. The neighborhood kids called him \"Mr. T,\" a nod to his past he found humorously ironic.\n\nAs he admired the vibrant petals, his phone buzzed on the garden table. Gerald wiped his hands on his pants and answered. The voice on the other end was unfamiliar, cold as ice.\n\n\"We know who you are, Dr. Chaos. We've got your granddaughter.\"\n\nThe phone slipped from his fingers, crashing into the soil. Gerald\u2019s heart pounded against his ribs, his peaceful world suddenly shattered. He thought of little Emily, her innocent laugh echoing in his mind. Panic and resolve clashed within him, the old instincts stirring from their long slumber.\n\nHe stood up, brushing off the earth, and headed towards the old toolshed at the end of the yard\u2014a relic of his former life, hidden beneath mundane gardening supplies. Inside, he pushed aside a stack of fertilizer bags to reveal a trapdoor. Dust swirled as he descended into the dimly lit cellar.\n\nThe lair was just as he had left it, though cobwebs now draped over the once-glorious array of gadgets and costumes. In the corner, his old suit lay in a heap\u2014a patchwork of dark leather and armored plates, now looking somewhat outdated. He chuckled dryly, the sound reverberating in the confined space.\n\n\"Time to see if this still fits,\" he muttered, pulling the suit from its resting place.\n\nHe struggled to fasten the clasps, grumbling as he squeezed into it. The fabric groaned in protest, much like his knees as he bent to adjust the boots. Catching sight of himself in a dusty mirror, Gerald shook his head. \"Dr. Chaos, the paunchy edition,\" he quipped.\n\nNext, he rummaged through the shelves, searching for his old gadgets. He found a handheld EMP device, once cutting-edge but now likely obsolete. A flicker of nostalgia turned to frustration as it sparked and fizzled in his hand. \"Figures,\" he sighed, tossing it aside.\n\nStill, he managed to salvage a few trinkets\u2014smoke bombs, a grappling hook\u2014and stuffed them into a utility belt. From another corner, he retrieved a map of the city, lines crisscrossed with potential escape routes and hideouts. He traced a path with his finger, the plan formulating as his resolve hardened like steel.\n\nThe night was his ally as he emerged from the cellar, the shadows embracing his transformation. The air felt alive with possibility, a stark contrast to the serene garden he left behind. The thrill of the chase, the scent of danger\u2014it was intoxicating, a reminder of who he had once been.\n\nHis first stop was an old haunt, a defunct observatory on the outskirts of town. There, he found Max \"The Gearhead\" Miller, an old ally turned mechanic. Max was elbow-deep in the engine of a classic car, grease smeared across his cheeks.\n\n\"Well, if it isn't Dr. Chaos,\" Max greeted, wiping his hands on a rag. \"Heard you retired.\"\n\n\"Didn't take,\" Gerald replied, explaining the situation.\n\nMax nodded, his expression somber. \"I've got just the thing.\" He led Gerald to a back room, unveiling a sleek, updated version of the EMP device. \"Consider it a prototype.\"\n\nWith the new device in hand, Gerald felt a surge of confidence. He exchanged a few more words with Max before heading out, his path clear.\n\nThe final confrontation took place in a high-rise under construction, its skeletal frame silhouetted against the moonlit sky. Gerald climbed the scaffolding with surprising agility, each step bringing him closer to Emily.\n\nHe found the kidnappers on the top floor, a ragtag group of mercenaries led by a man with a face like a hawk. Emily was bound in the corner, her wide eyes a mix of fear and trust as they locked onto his.\n\nWith a deep breath, Gerald stepped into the open, his voice a growl that echoed through the girders. \"Let her go.\"\n\nThe mercenaries laughed, dismissing the relic before them. But when the prototype EMP device crackled to life, disabling their weapons and lights, the laughter died.\n\nIn the ensuing chaos, Gerald moved with the precision of his younger days. Smoke bombs created cover, confusion reigned, and one by one, the mercenaries fell.\n\nFinally, he reached Emily, her bindings quickly undone. She clung to him, the warmth of her hug more rewarding than any victory of his villainous past.\n\nAs they emerged into the dawn, Gerald knew he had changed. He was no longer Dr. Chaos, but a grandfather, a gardener, and a man who\u2019d found redemption through the love of his family.",

        "ground_truth": "Summer had taken full possession of the Eastern Coast. Washington\u2019s troops were buzzing about the camp, readying for a campaign at Monmouth Courthouse that was to commence four days hence. But that was not the only event that was bringing about both excitement and fear among the men; on the 24th of June, there was to be a solar eclipse that had been reported in newspapers at the beginning of January.\nNothing in Washington\u2019s inner circle had changed despite the solar event. Battle plans were still being drawn up, the office was busy with more correspondence being written, orders were being directed by the Commander-in-Chief of the army. The aides-de-camp were not so busy as that they scarcely discussed topics that were not related to the upcoming battle at dinner. Except for tonight, when they had a reprieve long enough to talk about something else.\n\u201cDid you see the newspaper today? There\u2019s to be a solar eclipse the day after tomorrow.\u201d John said between the bits of his meager stew of salted beef and potatoes.\n\u201cSome of the soldiers are calling it a bad omen it being so close to the upcoming battle.\u201d Alexander sighed and rolled his eyes.\nLafayette shrugged, \u201cI see it as a good omen. The brightness of the Revolution, the periods of darkness where we\u2019ve lost battles, and the sun re-appearing means our cause will shine brightly again with won battles.\u201d\n\u2018You are very optimistic,\nMon Ami\n.\u201d Laurens said with a quirked smile.\n\u201cThough I will admit that I have not ever seen a solar eclipse before in my life. It will be interesting to observe it given the chance.\u201d \u00a0Meade returned.\n\u201cNor I. Let\u2019s just hope we\u2019re not overwhelmed with paperwork.\u201d Hamilton added dryly.\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not going to be hard to miss, really.\u201d Laurens laughed.\nAs the group continued to discuss the upcoming solar eclipse and its possible implications, the conversation in the room shifted again towards the coming battle at Monmouth.\nAlexander would be glad of the distraction of this celestial event to calm his nerves about the fight. There was something in the air that made him uneasy. He felt something was going to go wrong.\n*~*\nThe hours before the eclipse was just as busy as usual. Washington\u2019s aides-de-camp were kept busy with their work, all the while tilting their heads out the window to keep an eye on the sky or their pocket watches.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a few minutes break would go amiss.\u201d Hamilton remarked, putting down his quill and capping his ink.\nLafayette grinned, \u201cYou read my mind, mon ami!\u201d\nThe others chuckled while putting away their writing utensils and pushed back their chairs. Each of them stretched, grateful for the exercise after so many hours seated. They all stepped outside onto the small patch of dirt generously called a lawn and stared up, with their hands over their foreheads to shield them from sunlight.\nMeade pulled out his pocket watch and glanced at it. \u201cIt should be starting any time now. The newspaper said the eclipse should begin at 3:19 pm.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t look as though it has changed.\u201d Alexander remarked squinting up at the sun.\n\u201cAlex, don\u2019t look directly at the sun, you idiot!\u201d Laurens snapped.\nHamilton closed his eyes sharply then winced. He slowly opened them, squinting and shielding them with his hand. He stayed still for a few moments, adjusting to the brightness.\nFinally, at 3:30, as the sky began to dim, the soldiers began to gasp. Lafayette and Laurens leaped up from the stairs.\n\"It's beginning!\" Lafayette shouted, standing on his tiptoes as if trying to catch a glimpse of the sky. \"Look at that!\" Lafayette exclaimed, pointing up at the darkening sky.\nThe Moon slowly began to creep in front of the sun, the group watched in awe as the sky grew darker and a strange twilight settled over the land.\nSlowly, the sun became more and more obscured, the crescent becoming smaller and smaller as the smaller body of the Moon overtook it. \u00a0A sense of anticipation filled the air. Meade felt a shiver run down his spine, a mixture of excitement and wonder at the celestial event unfolding before their eyes.\nThe whole camp seemed to hold its breath as the moon completely covered the sun, casting a shadow over their little part of the world. The temperature dropped, and a hush fell over the group as they experienced the breathtaking beauty of the total solar eclipse.\n\u201c\nC\u2019est Incroyable\n!\u201d Lafayette whispered in awe. \"Mon Dieu! But it\u2019s like dawn!\u201d\n\u201cLook at that bright light at the right corner.\u201d Alexander remarked, \u201cI wonder if that is the sun re-appearing.\u201d He turned, tilting his head while his eyebrows furrowed. \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d He pointed his finger upwards. \u201cThere are no birds chirping now. I think they are just as discombobulated!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a sight isn\u2019t it, gentlemen?\u201d A deep voice from behind them called, making them all whirl around to see the General striding towards them. The group all saluted, looking as though they were ready to take a reprimand.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Excellency,\u201d Hamilton started, \u201cWe did not mean to abandon our duties during such a critical period before a battle-\u201d\nWashington raised his hand. \"No worries. I wouldn't want to miss out on witnessing such a rare celestial phenomenon; one that we might never get to see again.\" He gazed up at the solar eclipse. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a sight to see, no?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think that ring around the sun is, sir?\u201d Alexander wondered.\n\u201cPerhaps,\" Washington replied, raising his chin up to the eclipse, \"it\u2019s the atmosphere of the moon, or that of the sun.\u201d Washington commented.\n\u201cWell, whatever it is, it sure is a beautiful sight,\u201d Laurens added.\n\u201cIt looks like light surrounding a void,\u201d remarked Lafayette with wonder in his voice.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not eerie or anything, Lafayette,\u201d scoffed Meade.\nA few moments later, the moon began to move away from the sun, beginning to chase away the shadows. The ring of light around the sun grew brighter as the moon slowly moved out of its path. The sky gradually began to lighten.\n\u201cSunrise again.\u201d Laughed Alexander, his breath catching as it indeed felt as though dawn was breaking for a second time that day. It wasn\u2019t long before afternoon sunshine returned to the sky. The soldiers murmured but went back to their duties.\nThe group stood in awe as the eclipse passed.\u00a0\u00a0Washington turned to his companions with a smile. \"Well, gentlemen, it seems we have witnessed to something truly extraordinary today. Now, shall we get back to work?\u201d",
        "story_a": "The sky above Washington's camp darkened like ink spilled across parchment, the rare solar eclipse casting an eerie twilight over the soldiers. The air grew thick with tension, a palpable sense of foreboding that settled in their bones. Whispers skittered through the ranks like mice in the walls, each man interpreting the celestial event in his own way. Some saw it as a divine omen, a sign that Providence was with them, while others feared it as a harbinger of doom.\n\nAlexander Hamilton stood at the edge of the camp, his sharp eyes fixed on the sliver of sun still visible through the encroaching shadow. He was not a man given to superstition, but even he could not deny the strangeness of the moment. The usual clamor of the camp had quieted to a murmur, the soldiers\u2019 nervous energy vibrating in the air.\n\n\"Alexander,\" a familiar voice called, cutting through his reverie. He turned to see John Laurens approaching, his brow furrowed with concern. \"Have you heard the rumors?\"\n\nHamilton sighed, running a hand through his hair. \"Which ones? There are so many.\"\n\nLaurens glanced around, ensuring they were out of earshot. \"Some of the men are saying this eclipse is a sign. A warning from God, perhaps. They think it foretells disaster.\"\n\nHamilton raised an eyebrow. \"And what do you think, John? Do you believe the heavens have taken an interest in our little rebellion?\"\n\nLaurens chuckled softly, though his eyes remained serious. \"I don't know what to believe. But I do know that fear can be a dangerous thing in a camp like this. It can spread like wildfire.\"\n\nHamilton nodded, his mind already racing with possibilities. \"We need to address this before it undermines morale. A few well-placed words from General Washington might help.\"\n\nAs if summoned by the mention of his name, General George Washington strode into view, his presence commanding even in the dimming light. Hamilton and Laurens exchanged a glance before approaching their commander.\n\n\"General,\" Hamilton began, \"there are whispers spreading through the camp. The men are unsettled by the eclipse.\"\n\nWashington's expression remained impassive, but his eyes betrayed a flicker of concern. \"What are they saying?\"\n\n\"That it is a sign,\" Laurens replied. \"A warning of impending doom.\"\n\nWashington considered this for a moment, his gaze shifting to the darkening sky. \"Fear is a powerful enemy,\" he said finally. \"We must quash these rumors before they take root.\"\n\nHamilton nodded. \"What do you suggest, sir?\"\n\nWashington's eyes hardened with determination. \"Gather the men. I will address them directly.\"\n\nThe camp bustled as word spread that the General would speak. Soldiers gathered, their faces a mix of apprehension and curiosity. Hamilton and Laurens stood to the side, watching as Washington took his place before the assembled troops.\n\n\"Men,\" Washington began, his voice steady and strong, \"I know that this eclipse has caused unease among you. It is a rare and wondrous event, and such things often stir our deepest fears and hopes. But let me assure you, this is no omen of disaster. It is merely a natural occurrence, a reminder of the vastness of the universe and our small place within it.\"\n\nHe paused, allowing his words to sink in. \"We fight for a cause greater than ourselves, for the freedom and future of our young nation. Do not let fear cloud your resolve. Let this eclipse be a symbol of the challenges we face and the strength we must find within ourselves to overcome them.\"\n\nThe soldiers murmured amongst themselves, the tension in the air beginning to dissipate. Hamilton watched as the General's words took hold, the men standing a little taller, their expressions a little more resolute.\n\nAs Washington stepped down, Hamilton approached him. \"That was well said, sir.\"\n\nWashington nodded. \"Let us hope it is enough.\"\n\nThe eerie twilight of the eclipse continued to cast its shadow, but the camp seemed lighter, the whispers of doom fading into the background. Hamilton felt a sense of relief, though he knew the real battle was far from over.\n\nThat evening, as the camp settled into an uneasy quiet, Hamilton found himself alone by the fire, his thoughts drifting back to the events of the day. The eclipse, with all its strange beauty and unsettling power, had reminded him of the precariousness of their cause. But it had also reminded him of the strength that lay in unity, in the unwavering belief in something greater than themselves.\n\n\"Alexander,\" Laurens' voice broke through his reverie once more. \"Mind if I join you?\"\n\nHamilton gestured to the empty space beside him. \"Not at all.\"\n\nThey sat in companionable silence for a while, the fire crackling softly between them. Finally, Laurens spoke. \"Do you ever wonder if we're being watched? If there's something out there, beyond the stars, taking an interest in our fate?\"\n\nHamilton smiled faintly. \"I think we'd be arrogant to assume otherwise. The universe is vast and full of mysteries. Who's to say what forces are at play?\"\n\nLaurens nodded thoughtfully. \"It's a humbling thought.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Hamilton agreed. \"But whether we are watched by gods or men, our duty remains the same. We fight for freedom, for a future where our children can live without fear.\"\n\nLaurens raised his canteen in a silent toast. \"To that future.\"\n\nHamilton clinked his own canteen against Laurens'. \"To that future.\"\n\nAs the shadow of the eclipse began to recede, the camp slowly returned to its usual rhythm. The soldiers, buoyed by Washington's words and the quiet strength of their shared purpose, faced the coming days with renewed resolve. And though the whispers of unease lingered at the edges of their minds, they were tempered by the knowledge that they were not alone in their struggle.\n\nThe eclipse had brought more than just darkness; it had brought a reminder of their unity, their resilience, and the light that would always follow the shadows.",
        "story_b": "The camp was abuzz with a strange energy that morning, soldiers murmuring and casting wary glances toward the sky. The air was thick with anticipation, fear, and a sense of the unknown. They had heard tales of the eclipse, whispered warnings from the townsfolk and the grim predictions of the camp's more superstitious men. As the sun began its slow retreat behind the moon, an eerie twilight spread across the landscape, casting Washington's camp into a surreal half-light.\n\nPrivate Samuel Carter, a young soldier from Virginia, stood at the edge of the camp, his gaze fixed upwards. He felt a chill creeping up his spine, a sensation that had nothing to do with the cool breeze that tugged at his coat. To him, the eclipse seemed a celestial dance, a silent waltz of cosmic bodies, yet he could not shake the feeling that it was a harbinger of something more sinister.\n\n\"What do you make of it, Sam?\" asked Private Nathaniel Greene, sidling up beside him. Nate had a knack for humor, often lightening the mood with his jests, but today his voice held a note of genuine curiosity tinged with unease.\n\nSam sighed, his eyes never leaving the sky. \"I reckon it's just an eclipse, Nate, though I'll admit it does feel peculiar.\" He paused, his fingers unconsciously tracing the scar on his forearm\u2014a reminder of a skirmish at Brandywine. \"But I can't help but wonder if it means something more.\"\n\nNate chuckled, though it lacked his usual mirth. \"Perhaps it's a sign from the heavens that we'll finally get proper rations. Or maybe General Washington's about to sprout wings and fly us all to victory.\"\n\nSam managed a weak smile, but his thoughts drifted to the stories his grandmother used to tell. Tales of celestial events heralding great change or impending doom. He shook his head, trying to dispel the uneasy feeling that clung to him like a shadow.\n\nElsewhere in the camp, General George Washington himself stood with his trusted aide-de-camp, Alexander Hamilton, observing the phenomenon. Washington's face was stoic, but Hamilton could sense the weight of his thoughts.\n\n\"Do you think the men will see this as an ill omen, sir?\" Hamilton inquired, adjusting his spectacles as he squinted at the darkening sky.\n\nWashington remained silent for a moment, his eyes narrowing as he surveyed the camp. \"The men are on edge, that's certain. But we must remind them that the eclipse is merely a natural occurrence, not a portent.\" He paused, his voice softening. \"Though I confess, even I feel a certain unease.\"\n\nHamilton nodded, understanding the burden of leadership that Washington carried. He knew well the toll it took on the General, the sleepless nights and the constant pressure to lead a fledgling nation to victory. \"Perhaps we can use this moment to inspire them, sir. To remind them of the unity and renewal that can come from darkness.\"\n\nWashington considered this, a thoughtful expression crossing his features. \"Aye, perhaps you are right, Hamilton. Let us gather the men and address them.\"\n\nAs the eclipse reached its zenith, the camp was bathed in an otherworldly glow. A hush fell over the soldiers as Washington and Hamilton ascended a small rise, their silhouettes framed against the eerie twilight. The men gathered, their faces a tapestry of awe, fear, and curiosity.\n\n\"My fellow soldiers,\" Washington began, his voice carrying across the camp, \"we find ourselves under the shadow of a great celestial event. Some of you may see this as a sign of ill fortune, others as a divine message. But I stand before you to say that it is neither.\"\n\nHe paused, allowing his words to settle over the men. \"An eclipse is a natural occurrence, a reminder of the order and balance of the universe. It is a moment of darkness, yes, but also a moment of transition. From this darkness, we emerge renewed, united in our cause.\"\n\nHamilton stepped forward, his voice ringing with conviction. \"We fight not just for ourselves, but for the future of this nation. Let this eclipse be a symbol of our resilience, our determination to overcome any obstacle. Together, we shall emerge stronger, ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead.\"\n\nAs the sun began its slow return, a murmur of agreement rippled through the crowd. Sam felt a warmth spreading through him, a spark of hope igniting in his chest. Perhaps the eclipse was more than just a celestial dance\u2014it was a reminder that even in the darkest times, there was light to be found.\n\nNate clapped him on the back, grinning widely. \"See, Sam? Not so bad after all. Maybe next time we'll get a rainbow.\"\n\nSam laughed, feeling the tension that had gripped him begin to ease. \"Aye, perhaps we will, Nate. Perhaps we will.\"\n\nAs the camp returned to its routine, the soldiers' spirits lifted, buoyed by the sense of unity and purpose that Washington and Hamilton had instilled. The eclipse, once a source of fear and uncertainty, had become a catalyst for hope and camaraderie.\n\nLater that evening, as the camp settled into the quiet of the night, Sam found himself reflecting on the day's events. He thought of the battles they had fought, the hardships they had endured, and the friendships that had formed in the crucible of war. He realized that, like the eclipse, their journey was one of transformation\u2014a passage through darkness that would ultimately lead to light.\n\nAs he drifted off to sleep, Sam felt a sense of peace wash over him. The eclipse had come and gone, leaving in its wake a renewed sense of purpose and a reminder that, no matter the challenges they faced, they were not alone. Together, they would forge ahead, united in their quest for freedom and a brighter future.",

        "ground_truth": "Summer had taken full possession of the Eastern Coast. Washington\u2019s troops were buzzing about the camp, readying for a campaign at Monmouth Courthouse that was to commence four days hence. But that was not the only event that was bringing about both excitement and fear among the men; on the 24th of June, there was to be a solar eclipse that had been reported in newspapers at the beginning of January.\nNothing in Washington\u2019s inner circle had changed despite the solar event. Battle plans were still being drawn up, the office was busy with more correspondence being written, orders were being directed by the Commander-in-Chief of the army. The aides-de-camp were not so busy as that they scarcely discussed topics that were not related to the upcoming battle at dinner. Except for tonight, when they had a reprieve long enough to talk about something else.\n\u201cDid you see the newspaper today? There\u2019s to be a solar eclipse the day after tomorrow.\u201d John said between the bits of his meager stew of salted beef and potatoes.\n\u201cSome of the soldiers are calling it a bad omen it being so close to the upcoming battle.\u201d Alexander sighed and rolled his eyes.\nLafayette shrugged, \u201cI see it as a good omen. The brightness of the Revolution, the periods of darkness where we\u2019ve lost battles, and the sun re-appearing means our cause will shine brightly again with won battles.\u201d\n\u2018You are very optimistic,\nMon Ami\n.\u201d Laurens said with a quirked smile.\n\u201cThough I will admit that I have not ever seen a solar eclipse before in my life. It will be interesting to observe it given the chance.\u201d \u00a0Meade returned.\n\u201cNor I. Let\u2019s just hope we\u2019re not overwhelmed with paperwork.\u201d Hamilton added dryly.\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not going to be hard to miss, really.\u201d Laurens laughed.\nAs the group continued to discuss the upcoming solar eclipse and its possible implications, the conversation in the room shifted again towards the coming battle at Monmouth.\nAlexander would be glad of the distraction of this celestial event to calm his nerves about the fight. There was something in the air that made him uneasy. He felt something was going to go wrong.\n*~*\nThe hours before the eclipse was just as busy as usual. Washington\u2019s aides-de-camp were kept busy with their work, all the while tilting their heads out the window to keep an eye on the sky or their pocket watches.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a few minutes break would go amiss.\u201d Hamilton remarked, putting down his quill and capping his ink.\nLafayette grinned, \u201cYou read my mind, mon ami!\u201d\nThe others chuckled while putting away their writing utensils and pushed back their chairs. Each of them stretched, grateful for the exercise after so many hours seated. They all stepped outside onto the small patch of dirt generously called a lawn and stared up, with their hands over their foreheads to shield them from sunlight.\nMeade pulled out his pocket watch and glanced at it. \u201cIt should be starting any time now. The newspaper said the eclipse should begin at 3:19 pm.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t look as though it has changed.\u201d Alexander remarked squinting up at the sun.\n\u201cAlex, don\u2019t look directly at the sun, you idiot!\u201d Laurens snapped.\nHamilton closed his eyes sharply then winced. He slowly opened them, squinting and shielding them with his hand. He stayed still for a few moments, adjusting to the brightness.\nFinally, at 3:30, as the sky began to dim, the soldiers began to gasp. Lafayette and Laurens leaped up from the stairs.\n\"It's beginning!\" Lafayette shouted, standing on his tiptoes as if trying to catch a glimpse of the sky. \"Look at that!\" Lafayette exclaimed, pointing up at the darkening sky.\nThe Moon slowly began to creep in front of the sun, the group watched in awe as the sky grew darker and a strange twilight settled over the land.\nSlowly, the sun became more and more obscured, the crescent becoming smaller and smaller as the smaller body of the Moon overtook it. \u00a0A sense of anticipation filled the air. Meade felt a shiver run down his spine, a mixture of excitement and wonder at the celestial event unfolding before their eyes.\nThe whole camp seemed to hold its breath as the moon completely covered the sun, casting a shadow over their little part of the world. The temperature dropped, and a hush fell over the group as they experienced the breathtaking beauty of the total solar eclipse.\n\u201c\nC\u2019est Incroyable\n!\u201d Lafayette whispered in awe. \"Mon Dieu! But it\u2019s like dawn!\u201d\n\u201cLook at that bright light at the right corner.\u201d Alexander remarked, \u201cI wonder if that is the sun re-appearing.\u201d He turned, tilting his head while his eyebrows furrowed. \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d He pointed his finger upwards. \u201cThere are no birds chirping now. I think they are just as discombobulated!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a sight isn\u2019t it, gentlemen?\u201d A deep voice from behind them called, making them all whirl around to see the General striding towards them. The group all saluted, looking as though they were ready to take a reprimand.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Excellency,\u201d Hamilton started, \u201cWe did not mean to abandon our duties during such a critical period before a battle-\u201d\nWashington raised his hand. \"No worries. I wouldn't want to miss out on witnessing such a rare celestial phenomenon; one that we might never get to see again.\" He gazed up at the solar eclipse. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a sight to see, no?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think that ring around the sun is, sir?\u201d Alexander wondered.\n\u201cPerhaps,\" Washington replied, raising his chin up to the eclipse, \"it\u2019s the atmosphere of the moon, or that of the sun.\u201d Washington commented.\n\u201cWell, whatever it is, it sure is a beautiful sight,\u201d Laurens added.\n\u201cIt looks like light surrounding a void,\u201d remarked Lafayette with wonder in his voice.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not eerie or anything, Lafayette,\u201d scoffed Meade.\nA few moments later, the moon began to move away from the sun, beginning to chase away the shadows. The ring of light around the sun grew brighter as the moon slowly moved out of its path. The sky gradually began to lighten.\n\u201cSunrise again.\u201d Laughed Alexander, his breath catching as it indeed felt as though dawn was breaking for a second time that day. It wasn\u2019t long before afternoon sunshine returned to the sky. The soldiers murmured but went back to their duties.\nThe group stood in awe as the eclipse passed.\u00a0\u00a0Washington turned to his companions with a smile. \"Well, gentlemen, it seems we have witnessed to something truly extraordinary today. Now, shall we get back to work?\u201d",
        "story_a": "The sky above Washington's camp darkened like ink spilled across parchment, the rare solar eclipse casting an eerie twilight over the soldiers. The air grew thick with tension, a palpable sense of foreboding that settled in their bones. Whispers skittered through the ranks like mice in the walls, each man interpreting the celestial event in his own way. Some saw it as a divine omen, a sign that Providence was with them, while others feared it as a harbinger of doom.\n\nAlexander Hamilton stood at the edge of the camp, his sharp eyes fixed on the sliver of sun still visible through the encroaching shadow. He was not a man given to superstition, but even he could not deny the strangeness of the moment. The usual clamor of the camp had quieted to a murmur, the soldiers\u2019 nervous energy vibrating in the air.\n\n\"Alexander,\" a familiar voice called, cutting through his reverie. He turned to see John Laurens approaching, his brow furrowed with concern. \"Have you heard the rumors?\"\n\nHamilton sighed, running a hand through his hair. \"Which ones? There are so many.\"\n\nLaurens glanced around, ensuring they were out of earshot. \"Some of the men are saying this eclipse is a sign. A warning from God, perhaps. They think it foretells disaster.\"\n\nHamilton raised an eyebrow. \"And what do you think, John? Do you believe the heavens have taken an interest in our little rebellion?\"\n\nLaurens chuckled softly, though his eyes remained serious. \"I don't know what to believe. But I do know that fear can be a dangerous thing in a camp like this. It can spread like wildfire.\"\n\nHamilton nodded, his mind already racing with possibilities. \"We need to address this before it undermines morale. A few well-placed words from General Washington might help.\"\n\nAs if summoned by the mention of his name, General George Washington strode into view, his presence commanding even in the dimming light. Hamilton and Laurens exchanged a glance before approaching their commander.\n\n\"General,\" Hamilton began, \"there are whispers spreading through the camp. The men are unsettled by the eclipse.\"\n\nWashington's expression remained impassive, but his eyes betrayed a flicker of concern. \"What are they saying?\"\n\n\"That it is a sign,\" Laurens replied. \"A warning of impending doom.\"\n\nWashington considered this for a moment, his gaze shifting to the darkening sky. \"Fear is a powerful enemy,\" he said finally. \"We must quash these rumors before they take root.\"\n\nHamilton nodded. \"What do you suggest, sir?\"\n\nWashington's eyes hardened with determination. \"Gather the men. I will address them directly.\"\n\nThe camp bustled as word spread that the General would speak. Soldiers gathered, their faces a mix of apprehension and curiosity. Hamilton and Laurens stood to the side, watching as Washington took his place before the assembled troops.\n\n\"Men,\" Washington began, his voice steady and strong, \"I know that this eclipse has caused unease among you. It is a rare and wondrous event, and such things often stir our deepest fears and hopes. But let me assure you, this is no omen of disaster. It is merely a natural occurrence, a reminder of the vastness of the universe and our small place within it.\"\n\nHe paused, allowing his words to sink in. \"We fight for a cause greater than ourselves, for the freedom and future of our young nation. Do not let fear cloud your resolve. Let this eclipse be a symbol of the challenges we face and the strength we must find within ourselves to overcome them.\"\n\nThe soldiers murmured amongst themselves, the tension in the air beginning to dissipate. Hamilton watched as the General's words took hold, the men standing a little taller, their expressions a little more resolute.\n\nAs Washington stepped down, Hamilton approached him. \"That was well said, sir.\"\n\nWashington nodded. \"Let us hope it is enough.\"\n\nThe eerie twilight of the eclipse continued to cast its shadow, but the camp seemed lighter, the whispers of doom fading into the background. Hamilton felt a sense of relief, though he knew the real battle was far from over.\n\nThat evening, as the camp settled into an uneasy quiet, Hamilton found himself alone by the fire, his thoughts drifting back to the events of the day. The eclipse, with all its strange beauty and unsettling power, had reminded him of the precariousness of their cause. But it had also reminded him of the strength that lay in unity, in the unwavering belief in something greater than themselves.\n\n\"Alexander,\" Laurens' voice broke through his reverie once more. \"Mind if I join you?\"\n\nHamilton gestured to the empty space beside him. \"Not at all.\"\n\nThey sat in companionable silence for a while, the fire crackling softly between them. Finally, Laurens spoke. \"Do you ever wonder if we're being watched? If there's something out there, beyond the stars, taking an interest in our fate?\"\n\nHamilton smiled faintly. \"I think we'd be arrogant to assume otherwise. The universe is vast and full of mysteries. Who's to say what forces are at play?\"\n\nLaurens nodded thoughtfully. \"It's a humbling thought.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Hamilton agreed. \"But whether we are watched by gods or men, our duty remains the same. We fight for freedom, for a future where our children can live without fear.\"\n\nLaurens raised his canteen in a silent toast. \"To that future.\"\n\nHamilton clinked his own canteen against Laurens'. \"To that future.\"\n\nAs the shadow of the eclipse began to recede, the camp slowly returned to its usual rhythm. The soldiers, buoyed by Washington's words and the quiet strength of their shared purpose, faced the coming days with renewed resolve. And though the whispers of unease lingered at the edges of their minds, they were tempered by the knowledge that they were not alone in their struggle.\n\nThe eclipse had brought more than just darkness; it had brought a reminder of their unity, their resilience, and the light that would always follow the shadows.",
        "story_b": "The sun was a dim shadow in the sky, casting the camp in an eerie twilight that seemed to blur the line between day and night. The soldiers, usually boisterous and lively, gathered in clusters, their faces illuminated by the strange half-light. They whispered among themselves, eyes darting upward to the celestial spectacle unfolding above. \n\n\"Is this a sign from the heavens, or a warning of what's to come?\" muttered Private Harris, a young soldier with a mop of unruly hair and a penchant for old tales. His voice trembled slightly, betraying the fear that crept into his heart. \n\nSergeant O\u2019Malley, standing nearby, crossed his arms and shook his head, an attempt to mask his own unease. \"I've heard stories from my grandmother,\" he said, his brogue thickening with the weight of memory. \"Eclipses were seen as omens. They say they herald great change\u2014sometimes for better, sometimes for worse.\"\n\nPrivate Thompson, ever the joker, tried to lighten the mood. \"Well, if the sun's taking a break, maybe we should too!\" he quipped, earning a few chuckles from the group. Yet, beneath the laughter, the tension was palpable, like the taut string of a bow ready to snap.\n\nGeneral Washington, sensing the growing anxiety, decided to address the camp. He moved through the crowd with his characteristic calm, his presence a steady anchor amidst the swirling uncertainty. As he mounted a small rise to speak, the soldiers gathered around, their eyes wide with awe and trepidation.\n\n\"Men,\" Washington began, his voice carrying authority and reassurance. \"I understand the fears that this eclipse may stir within you. Such events have long been cloaked in mystery, shrouded in superstition. Yet, let us not forget that we face greater challenges daily, challenges that demand our unity and resolve.\"\n\nThe camp fell silent, save for the whispering wind that rustled the leaves. Washington's words hung in the air, a beacon of hope against the encroaching darkness.\n\n\"Remember,\" he continued, \"we are not alone in this fight. We stand together, as brothers, against whatever trials come our way. Let this eclipse be a reminder of our resilience, our ability to find light even in the darkest times.\"\n\nAs he spoke, a sudden gust of wind swept through the camp, sending shivers down spines and scattering fallen leaves. It was as if the eclipse itself was responding to Washington's call for courage, a tangible reminder of the change that lay ahead.\n\nIn the crowd, two soldiers\u2014Henry and Samuel\u2014stood side by side, their gazes fixed on the sky. They had fought together in battles past, their bond forged in the crucible of war.\n\n\"Do you remember that storm at Valley Forge?\" Henry asked, his voice barely above a whisper. \"We thought it was the end of us.\"\n\nSamuel nodded, a wry smile tugging at his lips. \"Aye, and yet here we are, still standing. This eclipse is nothing compared to what we've faced.\"\n\nTheir conversation, though quiet, was a balm to their frayed nerves. The eclipse became a backdrop to their reflections on courage and fear, a metaphor for their internal journey. \n\nAs the minutes ticked by, the sky transformed into a canvas of swirling darkness and light, the moon slowly reclaiming the sun. The eerie glow bathed the camp in an otherworldly hue, shadows stretching like fingers across the ground.\n\nWashington, having finished his speech, walked through the camp, offering words of encouragement to those he passed. His leadership style was one of compassion and steady presence, a guiding light for his men.\n\n\"Stay strong,\" he said to a young soldier who looked particularly pale. \"This too shall pass.\"\n\nThe soldier nodded, bolstered by Washington's confidence. \"Thank you, sir.\"\n\nElsewhere in the camp, the soldiers' camaraderie shone through their shared fears. A group gathered around a makeshift fire, sharing stories and laughter to ward off the chill of uncertainty.\n\n\"If this is the end, at least we're in good company,\" one soldier joked, earning a round of laughter that echoed into the twilight.\n\nDespite the tension, there was a sense of introspection that pervaded the camp. The eclipse, with its fleeting darkness, prompted many to reflect on their past battles and personal growth. It was a reminder of the changes they had undergone, both as individuals and as a unit.\n\nIn the midst of this introspection, Private Harris found himself contemplating the tales his grandmother had told him. He realized that while eclipses had been seen as omens of change, they were not inherently good or bad. Rather, it was how one responded to the change that truly mattered.\n\nWith this newfound understanding, Harris turned to his comrades, his voice steady and resolute. \"Let's make sure whatever change this brings, we're ready for it.\"\n\nThe soldiers nodded in agreement, their spirits lifted by the shared resolve. The eclipse, once a source of unease, had become a catalyst for unity and strength.\n\nAs the moon continued its journey across the sun, the camp gradually returned to its usual rhythm. The soldiers, their fears quelled by Washington's words and their own reflections, prepared for the challenges that lay ahead with renewed determination.\n\nBy the time the eclipse passed and the sun's full light returned, the camp was alive with a sense of purpose. The soldiers, their hearts buoyed by their shared experience, knew that they could face whatever came their way. The eclipse had not brought doom, but rather a reminder of their resilience and the bonds that tied them together.\n\nAnd so, under the brightening sky, Washington's men carried on, their spirits as unyielding as the sun that once more shone upon them.",

I wouldn't want to miss out on witnessing such a rare celestial phenomenon; one that we might never get to see again.\" He gazed up at the solar eclipse. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a sight to see, no?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think that ring around the sun is, sir?\u201d Alexander wondered.\n\u201cPerhaps,\" Washington replied, raising his chin up to the eclipse, \"it\u2019s the atmosphere of the moon, or that of the sun.\u201d Washington commented.\n\u201cWell, whatever it is, it sure is a beautiful sight,\u201d Laurens added.\n\u201cIt looks like light surrounding a void,\u201d remarked Lafayette with wonder in his voice.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not eerie or anything, Lafayette,\u201d scoffed Meade.\nA few moments later, the moon began to move away from the sun, beginning to chase away the shadows. The ring of light around the sun grew brighter as the moon slowly moved out of its path. The sky gradually began to lighten.\n\u201cSunrise again.\u201d Laughed Alexander, his breath catching as it indeed felt as though dawn was breaking for a second time that day. It wasn\u2019t long before afternoon sunshine returned to the sky. The soldiers murmured but went back to their duties.\nThe group stood in awe as the eclipse passed.\u00a0\u00a0Washington turned to his companions with a smile. \"Well, gentlemen, it seems we have witnessed to something truly extraordinary today. Now, shall we get back to work?\u201d",
        "story_a": "The sky above Washington's camp darkened like ink spilled across parchment, the rare solar eclipse casting an eerie twilight over the soldiers. The air grew thick with tension, a palpable sense of foreboding that settled in their bones. Whispers skittered through the ranks like mice in the walls, each man interpreting the celestial event in his own way. Some saw it as a divine omen, a sign that Providence was with them, while others feared it as a harbinger of doom.\n\nAlexander Hamilton stood at the edge of the camp, his sharp eyes fixed on the sliver of sun still visible through the encroaching shadow. He was not a man given to superstition, but even he could not deny the strangeness of the moment. The usual clamor of the camp had quieted to a murmur, the soldiers\u2019 nervous energy vibrating in the air.\n\n\"Alexander,\" a familiar voice called, cutting through his reverie. He turned to see John Laurens approaching, his brow furrowed with concern. \"Have you heard the rumors?\"\n\nHamilton sighed, running a hand through his hair. \"Which ones? There are so many.\"\n\nLaurens glanced around, ensuring they were out of earshot. \"Some of the men are saying this eclipse is a sign. A warning from God, perhaps. They think it foretells disaster.\"\n\nHamilton raised an eyebrow. \"And what do you think, John? Do you believe the heavens have taken an interest in our little rebellion?\"\n\nLaurens chuckled softly, though his eyes remained serious. \"I don't know what to believe. But I do know that fear can be a dangerous thing in a camp like this. It can spread like wildfire.\"\n\nHamilton nodded, his mind already racing with possibilities. \"We need to address this before it undermines morale. A few well-placed words from General Washington might help.\"\n\nAs if summoned by the mention of his name, General George Washington strode into view, his presence commanding even in the dimming light. Hamilton and Laurens exchanged a glance before approaching their commander.\n\n\"General,\" Hamilton began, \"there are whispers spreading through the camp. The men are unsettled by the eclipse.\"\n\nWashington's expression remained impassive, but his eyes betrayed a flicker of concern. \"What are they saying?\"\n\n\"That it is a sign,\" Laurens replied. \"A warning of impending doom.\"\n\nWashington considered this for a moment, his gaze shifting to the darkening sky. \"Fear is a powerful enemy,\" he said finally. \"We must quash these rumors before they take root.\"\n\nHamilton nodded. \"What do you suggest, sir?\"\n\nWashington's eyes hardened with determination. \"Gather the men. I will address them directly.\"\n\nThe camp bustled as word spread that the General would speak. Soldiers gathered, their faces a mix of apprehension and curiosity. Hamilton and Laurens stood to the side, watching as Washington took his place before the assembled troops.\n\n\"Men,\" Washington began, his voice steady and strong, \"I know that this eclipse has caused unease among you. It is a rare and wondrous event, and such things often stir our deepest fears and hopes. But let me assure you, this is no omen of disaster. It is merely a natural occurrence, a reminder of the vastness of the universe and our small place within it.\"\n\nHe paused, allowing his words to sink in. \"We fight for a cause greater than ourselves, for the freedom and future of our young nation. Do not let fear cloud your resolve. Let this eclipse be a symbol of the challenges we face and the strength we must find within ourselves to overcome them.\"\n\nThe soldiers murmured amongst themselves, the tension in the air beginning to dissipate. Hamilton watched as the General's words took hold, the men standing a little taller, their expressions a little more resolute.\n\nAs Washington stepped down, Hamilton approached him. \"That was well said, sir.\"\n\nWashington nodded. \"Let us hope it is enough.\"\n\nThe eerie twilight of the eclipse continued to cast its shadow, but the camp seemed lighter, the whispers of doom fading into the background. Hamilton felt a sense of relief, though he knew the real battle was far from over.\n\nThat evening, as the camp settled into an uneasy quiet, Hamilton found himself alone by the fire, his thoughts drifting back to the events of the day. The eclipse, with all its strange beauty and unsettling power, had reminded him of the precariousness of their cause. But it had also reminded him of the strength that lay in unity, in the unwavering belief in something greater than themselves.\n\n\"Alexander,\" Laurens' voice broke through his reverie once more. \"Mind if I join you?\"\n\nHamilton gestured to the empty space beside him. \"Not at all.\"\n\nThey sat in companionable silence for a while, the fire crackling softly between them. Finally, Laurens spoke. \"Do you ever wonder if we're being watched? If there's something out there, beyond the stars, taking an interest in our fate?\"\n\nHamilton smiled faintly. \"I think we'd be arrogant to assume otherwise. The universe is vast and full of mysteries. Who's to say what forces are at play?\"\n\nLaurens nodded thoughtfully. \"It's a humbling thought.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Hamilton agreed. \"But whether we are watched by gods or men, our duty remains the same. We fight for freedom, for a future where our children can live without fear.\"\n\nLaurens raised his canteen in a silent toast. \"To that future.\"\n\nHamilton clinked his own canteen against Laurens'. \"To that future.\"\n\nAs the shadow of the eclipse began to recede, the camp slowly returned to its usual rhythm. The soldiers, buoyed by Washington's words and the quiet strength of their shared purpose, faced the coming days with renewed resolve. And though the whispers of unease lingered at the edges of their minds, they were tempered by the knowledge that they were not alone in their struggle.\n\nThe eclipse had brought more than just darkness; it had brought a reminder of their unity, their resilience, and the light that would always follow the shadows.",
        "story_b": "The sun's light waned as the moon began its slow dance across the sky, casting an otherworldly shadow over Washington's camp. The soldiers paused in their duties, eyes drawn upward to the celestial drama unfolding above them. The air thrummed with an unspoken tension, a mixture of awe and apprehension. The day, once bright and clear, was now cloaked in a shroud of creeping twilight, the light dimming as if the heavens themselves were holding their breath.\n\nThe camp, usually bustling with the sounds of clattering pots and the distant laughter of camaraderie, fell into a hushed silence. Horses stamped nervously, their breath misting in the cool, thickening air. Birds ceased their songs, leaving an eerie quiet that only served to amplify the soldiers' unease.\n\nCorporal Samuel Haines, a veteran of many battles, stood with his arms crossed, squinting at the sky. \"Ain't natural,\" he muttered to his companion, Private Josiah Carter, who stood beside him, eyes wide with a mixture of fear and wonder. \"The sun don't just disappear like that.\"\n\nJosiah nodded, swallowing hard. \"Reckon it means something, Sam? Some say it's a sign from the Almighty, a message to us down here.\"\n\nSamuel grunted, shifting his weight. \"Could be. Or it could be something else. I've heard tales of such things. Some say it's a warning, others... well, they say it's a curse.\"\n\nNearby, a group of younger soldiers gathered, their whispered voices carrying in the stillness. They argued quietly, each one trying to impose his interpretation of the event. A tall, lanky soldier named Peter insisted, \"It's a sign of victory! The Lord's telling us we'll win this war.\"\n\nAnother, a stout lad with fiery hair named Thomas, shook his head vehemently. \"No, it's a bad omen. My grandmother used to say an eclipse brings death and misfortune.\"\n\nThe debate grew more heated as the shadows deepened, the camp now bathed in an eerie twilight that seemed to blur the line between day and night. The soldiers' faces were painted in shades of gray, their eyes reflecting the growing uncertainty.\n\nIn the midst of this celestial spectacle, Captain William Morris stepped into the circle of arguing men, his presence commanding an immediate silence. A respected leader, Morris was known for his steady hand and calming influence.\n\n\"Enough,\" he said firmly, his voice cutting through the tension like a blade. \"We cannot afford to let superstition cloud our judgment. Whatever this eclipse means, we must remain vigilant.\"\n\nSamuel nodded in agreement, his eyes scanning the horizon. \"Aye, Captain. We've got enough to worry about without chasing shadows.\"\n\nAs the moon continued its slow crawl across the sun, a strange sound echoed through the camp\u2014a low, mournful wail that sent shivers down the spines of even the bravest men. It was as if the earth itself was keening in response to the celestial event. The soldiers exchanged uneasy glances, their earlier bravado faltering in the face of this new mystery.\n\nJosiah clutched his musket tighter, his knuckles white with tension. \"What in God's name is that?\"\n\nCaptain Morris turned his gaze toward the sound, his brow furrowing. \"I don't know, but we need to find out.\"\n\nGathering a small group of men, Morris led them toward the source of the haunting wail. The air seemed to grow colder as they moved, the eerie twilight casting long shadows that danced and flickered in the corners of their vision.\n\nAs they approached the edge of the camp, they stumbled upon a sight that none of them could have anticipated. There, standing in the shadow of the trees, was an unexpected visitor\u2014a Native American man, his face painted in striking patterns, his eyes reflecting the same twilight that enveloped the camp.\n\nThe soldiers halted, their initial fear giving way to curiosity. The man stood calmly, his posture serene despite the tension that crackled in the air. Captain Morris stepped forward, meeting the stranger's gaze with cautious respect.\n\n\"Who are you, and why have you come?\" Morris asked, his voice steady but laced with curiosity.\n\nThe man regarded him silently for a moment before speaking, his voice low and melodic. \"I am called Tahoma. The eclipse has brought me here, as it is a time of great change. I come with no harm, only with words.\"\n\nThe soldiers exchanged glances, their earlier fear replaced by intrigue. Morris nodded, urging the man to continue.\n\n\"In my people\u2019s beliefs,\" Tahoma began, \"an eclipse is a time of transformation, a moment when the world holds its breath, waiting to see what will be. It is neither good nor evil, but a reminder of the balance that exists in all things.\"\n\nSamuel, still wary, crossed his arms. \"And what does this balance mean for us?\"\n\nTahoma looked up at the sky, where the sun was beginning to reemerge from behind the moon's shadow. \"It means that what you see as a curse or a blessing is but a part of a greater cycle. You must find your own path through the darkness and into the light.\"\n\nAs the eclipse passed and the sun's light returned to the world, the soldiers found themselves pondering Tahoma's words. The tension that had gripped the camp slowly began to dissipate, replaced by a renewed sense of purpose and understanding.\n\nCaptain Morris, ever the leader, addressed his men once more. \"We have faced many challenges, but we must not let fear dictate our actions. Let this day remind us of our strength and our unity.\"\n\nThe soldiers nodded, their spirits lifted by both Tahoma's wisdom and their captain's unwavering resolve. As the camp returned to its usual rhythm, the memory of the eclipse lingered in their minds\u2014a reminder of the mysteries that lay beyond their understanding and the courage required to face them.\n\nAnd so, beneath the light of a sun restored, Washington's camp continued its march toward the unknown future, guided by the knowledge that even in the darkest of times, there was always a glimmer of hope waiting to be found.",

        "ground_truth": "Israel Rostov was a high school dropout who worked as a fur-cart pusher in the State and Lake Building. Roy was eight years old when he first saw him. On Saturdays Roy often accompanied his grandfather, Jack Colby, whom he called Pops, to the furriers\u2019 office there that Pops shared with his brothers, Ike and Nate. Their brother Louie, who was the president of the Chicago Furriers Association, which he had founded, kept his office on the sixth floor of the building. The Colby brothers\u2019 office was on the eighth floor.\n\nRoy would sit on a high stool and cut up pelts with a stiletto-like knife Pops had taught him to use, while his grandfather and great-uncles sat around a marble-topped table and played cards. When Louie joined them, the game was bridge; otherwise, they played three-handed gin rummy.\n\nIzzy Rostov delivered furs on carts from floor to floor. He was a short kid with thick, curly black hair and bushy eyebrows, small dark-brown eyes, and a huge hook nose that seemed to be trying to escape from his face. Rostov\u2019s thick red lips curved upward at the corners so that it looked as if he were always smiling, except that his smile more resembled a sneer. He perpetually had a burning, unfiltered Lucky Strike dripping from his mouth. Roy was fascinated by Izzy\u2019s ability to talk while never removing the cigarette from his lips, as if the butt end were glued between them.\n\nRostov called Roy \u201cmy little pal\u201d and stopped his cart to talk to him whenever he encountered Roy in the hallways or in the freight elevator. This usually occurred when Roy was going between the sixth and eighth floors to visit with his Uncle Louie. The delivery boy always had a future plan for himself that he told Roy about. Most of the time it had to do with his moving to Miami Beach to hang out in the luxury hotels so that he could \u201chook up with rich, lazy broads.\u201d\n\nOne afternoon, Rostov told Roy he had something special to show him but he couldn\u2019t do it in the hallway. Roy followed Izzy into the men\u2019s room on the eighth floor. After making sure that nobody else was in the bathroom, Rostov removed from one of his coat pockets a small black handgun and held it out for Roy to look at.\n\n\u201cThis is a .38-caliber snub-nosed revolver,\u201d Rostov said. \u201cA very accurate piece of hardware. I bought it from a spook on Maxwell Street.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with it?\u201d asked Roy.\n\n\u201cStick up a few gas stations, what else? I gotta get a stake together before I travel, buy some slick clothes to impress the broads, you know. I can\u2019t make it on the peanuts these penny-pinchin\u2019 Hebes pay me around here.\u201d\n\nIzzy Rostov tapped the tip of his prodigious nose with the barrel of his revolver and said, \u201cI might even have enough dough to get my beak fixed.\u201d\n\nThen he laughed and put the gun back into his coat pocket. The ash from Rostov\u2019s cigarette dangled dangerously, and Roy was certain it would fall off, but it didn\u2019t. Roy moved farther away from him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be frightened, little pal,\u201d said Izzy. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna shoot anyone. The piece is just to throw a scare into \u2019em, let the suckers know Israel Rostov means business. I could change my name too, once I get down south. How does Guy DeMarco sound? Smooth, huh? The broads\u2019ll go for a name like that. Guy DeMarco.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think gas stations keep a lot of cash around?\u201d Roy asked.\n\n\u201cDepends,\u201d said Rostov. \u201cBut I got bigger ideas.\u201d\n\nRostov came close to Roy, mussed up his hair, and then walked out of the men\u2019s room. Roy waited for a minute before returning to his grandfather\u2019s office. Jack, Ike, and Nate were playing gin.\n\n\u201cHey, babe,\u201d said Pops, \u201cI thought you were going to see your Uncle Louie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI decided not to. I just went to the washroom.\u201d\n\nRoy went over to his stool, climbed on, and resumed cutting up pelts.\n\nThe next time Roy ran into Izzy Rostov, the delivery boy winked at him but did not stop to talk. His cart was loaded with mink and fox stoles.\n\n\u201cGotta get these on a truck goin\u2019 to the Merchandise Mart,\u201d Izzy said, and pushed on toward the freight elevator.\n\nA couple of Saturdays after that, all four of the brothers were playing bridge, when Louie said, \u201cYou hear the Rostov boy got killed?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe delivery cart kid?\u201d asked Ike.\n\n\u201cYes. Apparently he tried to rob a liquor store on Huron the other night and the clerk shot him in the back before he could get away.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know about his parents?\u201d asked Nate.\n\n\u201cWhat about them?\u201d Jack asked.\n\n\u201cThey were survivors of Auschwitz.\u201d\n\n\u201cHorrible,\u201d said Ike. \u201cImagine how they must feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Auschwitz?\u201d asked Roy.\n\nThe men were silent for a few moments before Nate spoke.\n\n\u201cIt was a concentration camp, a prison death camp during the war where the Germans murdered Jews.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey also murdered Gypsies and communists,\u201d said Ike, \u201cbut mostly Jews.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Rostov\u2019s parents are still alive,\u201d Roy said.\n\n\u201cSome prisoners were rescued by the Allies before the Nazis could kill them,\u201d said Louie.\n\n\u201cHow many people did they kill?\u201d asked Roy.\n\n\u201cToo many to count,\u201d said his grandfather. \u201cThe accepted figure is six million.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore,\u201d said Louie. \u201cThey murdered more.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo think that the parents escaped the Holocaust,\u201d Nate said. \u201cThey come to America and their child is shot down in the street like a wild animal.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had a gun,\u201d Roy said. \u201cHe showed it to me.\u201d\n\nThe men all looked at Roy.\n\n\u201cIt was a snub-nosed .38,\u201d he said. \u201cIzzy told me he was going to stick up a gas station and move to Miami Beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of home life could the boy have had?\u201d said Nate.\n\nRoy looked out a window onto State Street. The Chicago Theatre was showing Alan Ladd in The Badlanders. Clumps of brown dirt the size of pigeons were blowing through the gray air.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s play cards,\u201d said Ike.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The summer I turned eleven, our small town felt like it was holding its breath. Dust settled thick on the streets, the heat shimmering off the blacktop like a mirage. That was the summer I met Eddie.\n\nEddie was the new delivery worker for the local grocery store, a lanky guy in his mid-twenties with a mop of unruly hair and a smile that could charm the stripes off a zebra. He drove an ancient, battered pickup that rattled down the street like it was barely holding together, and he always had a cigarette dangling from his lips, the smoke curling up into the sky like a question mark.\n\nHe\u2019d show up at our house every Thursday, hauling bags of groceries to the front porch while my mother fussed over the order. I\u2019d sit on the steps, watching him with a mix of curiosity and envy. He moved with a sort of reckless energy, like he was always on the brink of something exciting.\n\n\u201cHey, kid,\u201d he said to me one afternoon, wiping the sweat off his brow. \u201cYou ever ride in a truck like this?\u201d\n\nI shook my head, my eyes wide. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, a sound like gravel rolling down a hill. \u201cSir? Man, you make me feel old. Name\u2019s Eddie. Wanna come see something cool?\u201d\n\nMy mother would\u2019ve had a fit if she knew, but something about Eddie made me trust him. I hopped off the steps and followed him to the truck. He opened the door with a creak and gestured for me to climb in. The seat was cracked and worn, the dashboard littered with old receipts and empty soda cans. But to me, it was a treasure trove.\n\n\u201cCheck this out,\u201d Eddie said, reaching into the glove compartment. He pulled out a small, leather-bound notebook and handed it to me. \u201cThese are my plans. Gonna open my own shop someday. Get outta this town, you know?\u201d\n\nI flipped through the pages, filled with sketches and notes. It was like looking into a secret world, one where Eddie was more than just a delivery worker. He was a dreamer, a builder, an architect of his own future.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really cool,\u201d I said, handing it back to him.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his eyes distant. \u201cJust gotta save up enough cash. Won\u2019t be long now.\u201d\n\nFrom that day on, I looked forward to Thursdays. Eddie would tell me stories about his dreams, about the places he wanted to go and the things he wanted to do. He had a way of making the world seem bigger, more full of possibilities. He talked about opening a bike shop, then a caf\u00e9, then a music store. His dreams were as wild and shifting as the clouds in the summer sky.\n\nBut there was an edge to him, too. Sometimes, I\u2019d catch a glimpse of it in the way he clenched his jaw or stared off into the distance. It was like he was running from something, and no matter how fast he went, it was always right behind him.\n\nOne Thursday, Eddie didn\u2019t show up. I waited on the steps all afternoon, my heart sinking with every passing minute. My mother said he probably just had the day off, but I could tell she was worried, too. The next week, another delivery worker came, a grizzled old man who didn\u2019t say much.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to Eddie?\u201d I asked, my voice trembling.\n\nThe man looked at me with sad eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear, kid? Eddie got into some trouble. Car crash. Didn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nThe words hit me like a punch to the gut. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Eddie, with his big dreams and easy smile, gone just like that. It didn\u2019t seem fair. It didn\u2019t seem real.\n\nIn the days that followed, I learned more about Eddie\u2019s life than I ever had while he was alive. He\u2019d grown up in a rough part of town, raised by a single mother who worked three jobs to make ends meet. He\u2019d dropped out of high school to help support his family, taking on whatever work he could find. The dreams he shared with me were more than just fantasies; they were his way out, his hope for something better.\n\nAs I pieced together his story, I began to understand the weight he carried. Eddie had lived a hard life, one filled with struggle and sacrifice. But he\u2019d never let it crush his spirit. He\u2019d held onto his dreams with a tenacity that both inspired and haunted me.\n\nI spent a lot of time that summer sitting on the front steps, thinking about Eddie. His death left me with a gnawing sense of loss, but also a burning question: Why do some people get trapped by their circumstances while others manage to break free? Was it fate, family, luck, or something else entirely?\n\nOne afternoon, I found myself flipping through an old book my father had left behind. It was filled with stories of heroes and adventurers, people who faced insurmountable odds and came out the other side stronger. Eddie had been like one of those heroes to me, but his story had ended too soon.\n\nI realized then that Eddie\u2019s dreams didn\u2019t have to die with him. They could live on in the people he\u2019d touched, in the lessons he\u2019d taught me. He\u2019d shown me that no matter how tough life gets, you can always dream, always strive for something better.\n\nAs the summer faded into fall, I made a promise to myself. I\u2019d keep Eddie\u2019s dreams alive by chasing my own, by never letting the weight of the world crush my spirit. And in doing so, I\u2019d honor the memory of the brash delivery worker who\u2019d taught me to see the world not just as it was, but as it could be.",
        "story_b": "The first time Simon saw the delivery worker, he was perched on the edge of the curb, his sneakers untied and backpack slung low. The man rode into view like a streak of mischief, the wheels of his bike skidding to a halt just inches from Simon's toes. With a grin that could light up the grayest afternoon, he tipped an imaginary hat. \"Careful there, little man! Almost became part of my delivery.\"\n\nSimon watched, wide-eyed, as the man dismounted with a flair, balancing the bike with one hand while he pulled a package from the satchel slung over his shoulder. \"Name's Luke,\" he said, extending a grease-streaked hand. \"And one day, I'll deliver more than just packages\u2014I'll deliver my own destiny.\"\n\nA laugh bubbled out of Simon before he could stop it. Luke\u2019s daring seemed to defy the ordinary humdrum of the neighborhood, where the streets were lined with the sound of honking cars and the chatter of people rushing through their day. As they stood there, the sun casting long shadows, Simon felt a shift, as if a new adventure had just begun.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Simon would find himself waiting on the curb, anticipating the familiar whirr of Luke's bike. Their conversations, always filled with Luke's tales of adventure, took place in odd corners of the city: the rooftop of an old building overlooking the sprawling streets, or the quiet recesses of an alleyway with walls covered in vibrant graffiti.\n\nLuke's stories were a patchwork of dreams and escapades. \"I used to be an actor, you know,\" he told Simon one evening, the city lights twinkling like distant stars. \"Off-Broadway, nothing big. But those roles were alive, breathing inside me. Just like this city.\"\n\nSimon listened, captivated by Luke's charisma, the way he painted his life with bold strokes. Yet, there was always a hint of something unsaid in Luke's laughter, a dangerous edge that lingered like the aftertaste of a bitter memory.\n\nTheir bond grew in the spaces between deliveries, in shared slices of pizza and stolen moments. Simon admired the way Luke navigated the chaotic streets with ease, weaving through traffic as if he were invincible. Luke was a force of nature, unstoppable and fearless.\n\nBut Simon began to notice the watch Luke always wore, its face cracked, hands frozen at an impossible hour. \"Why don't you fix it?\" Simon asked one day, pointing to the watch.\n\nLuke merely shrugged. \"Keeps me grounded,\" he said, ruffling Simon's hair. \"A reminder that time\u2019s just a concept. You gotta live in the moment.\"\n\nThen, one crisp autumn afternoon, Luke didn't show up. Simon waited, his heart sinking with each passing hour. Days turned into a week, and still, there was no sign of him. The city seemed duller, its vibrancy dimmed without Luke's presence.\n\nIt was on a windy Saturday that Simon heard the news. Mrs. Alvarez, who ran the bodega on the corner, spoke in hushed tones as she handed him a folded piece of paper. \"Found it in one of his old deliveries,\" she said, her eyes soft with sympathy.\n\nThe letter was addressed to no one, its edges frayed. It spoke of dreams deferred, of family he\u2019d lost touch with, and of a longing to escape a past that clung like shadows. Luke's words were raw, filled with a vulnerability Simon had never seen.\n\nIn the letter, Luke wrote about an accident\u2014how he\u2019d lost someone dear, how the guilt had chased him like a relentless storm. He had come to the city to outrun it, to find redemption in the chaos of deliveries and fleeting connections.\n\nSimon sat on the rooftop where they used to talk, the city sprawling below him, a vast ocean of stories. He realized then that Luke's bravado had been a shield, his dreams a way to keep the darkness at bay. The watch, with its stopped hands, was more than a symbol; it was a reminder of time stolen, of lives intertwined with fate's cruel hand.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Simon grappled with questions that felt too big for him. He wondered about the nature of dreams, of destinies that seemed always just out of reach. Was Luke's story one of fate, or had he been caught in the web of history, unable to break free?\n\nThe city continued its relentless pace, but for Simon, everything had changed. He found himself looking for pieces of Luke in the streets, in the laughter of strangers, in the fleeting moments where life felt vibrant and full.\n\nOne evening, as the sky bled into shades of pink and orange, Simon returned to the rooftop. He closed his eyes and imagined Luke beside him, recounting some wild delivery adventure with that infectious grin.\n\nSimon took a deep breath, feeling the weight of history, of dreams unfulfilled. He knew that Luke's story would remain with him, a reminder of the fragility and strength that coexisted within each of us.\n\nAs the last light faded, Simon opened his eyes, a resolve settling within him. He would honor Luke\u2019s memory by living boldly, by embracing the unpredictability of life. And somewhere, in the heart of the city, Simon felt Luke's presence\u2014a whisper in the wind, a promise that destinies could still be delivered.",

        "ground_truth": "Israel Rostov was a high school dropout who worked as a fur-cart pusher in the State and Lake Building. Roy was eight years old when he first saw him. On Saturdays Roy often accompanied his grandfather, Jack Colby, whom he called Pops, to the furriers\u2019 office there that Pops shared with his brothers, Ike and Nate. Their brother Louie, who was the president of the Chicago Furriers Association, which he had founded, kept his office on the sixth floor of the building. The Colby brothers\u2019 office was on the eighth floor.\n\nRoy would sit on a high stool and cut up pelts with a stiletto-like knife Pops had taught him to use, while his grandfather and great-uncles sat around a marble-topped table and played cards. When Louie joined them, the game was bridge; otherwise, they played three-handed gin rummy.\n\nIzzy Rostov delivered furs on carts from floor to floor. He was a short kid with thick, curly black hair and bushy eyebrows, small dark-brown eyes, and a huge hook nose that seemed to be trying to escape from his face. Rostov\u2019s thick red lips curved upward at the corners so that it looked as if he were always smiling, except that his smile more resembled a sneer. He perpetually had a burning, unfiltered Lucky Strike dripping from his mouth. Roy was fascinated by Izzy\u2019s ability to talk while never removing the cigarette from his lips, as if the butt end were glued between them.\n\nRostov called Roy \u201cmy little pal\u201d and stopped his cart to talk to him whenever he encountered Roy in the hallways or in the freight elevator. This usually occurred when Roy was going between the sixth and eighth floors to visit with his Uncle Louie. The delivery boy always had a future plan for himself that he told Roy about. Most of the time it had to do with his moving to Miami Beach to hang out in the luxury hotels so that he could \u201chook up with rich, lazy broads.\u201d\n\nOne afternoon, Rostov told Roy he had something special to show him but he couldn\u2019t do it in the hallway. Roy followed Izzy into the men\u2019s room on the eighth floor. After making sure that nobody else was in the bathroom, Rostov removed from one of his coat pockets a small black handgun and held it out for Roy to look at.\n\n\u201cThis is a .38-caliber snub-nosed revolver,\u201d Rostov said. \u201cA very accurate piece of hardware. I bought it from a spook on Maxwell Street.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with it?\u201d asked Roy.\n\n\u201cStick up a few gas stations, what else? I gotta get a stake together before I travel, buy some slick clothes to impress the broads, you know. I can\u2019t make it on the peanuts these penny-pinchin\u2019 Hebes pay me around here.\u201d\n\nIzzy Rostov tapped the tip of his prodigious nose with the barrel of his revolver and said, \u201cI might even have enough dough to get my beak fixed.\u201d\n\nThen he laughed and put the gun back into his coat pocket. The ash from Rostov\u2019s cigarette dangled dangerously, and Roy was certain it would fall off, but it didn\u2019t. Roy moved farther away from him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be frightened, little pal,\u201d said Izzy. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna shoot anyone. The piece is just to throw a scare into \u2019em, let the suckers know Israel Rostov means business. I could change my name too, once I get down south. How does Guy DeMarco sound? Smooth, huh? The broads\u2019ll go for a name like that. Guy DeMarco.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think gas stations keep a lot of cash around?\u201d Roy asked.\n\n\u201cDepends,\u201d said Rostov. \u201cBut I got bigger ideas.\u201d\n\nRostov came close to Roy, mussed up his hair, and then walked out of the men\u2019s room. Roy waited for a minute before returning to his grandfather\u2019s office. Jack, Ike, and Nate were playing gin.\n\n\u201cHey, babe,\u201d said Pops, \u201cI thought you were going to see your Uncle Louie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI decided not to. I just went to the washroom.\u201d\n\nRoy went over to his stool, climbed on, and resumed cutting up pelts.\n\nThe next time Roy ran into Izzy Rostov, the delivery boy winked at him but did not stop to talk. His cart was loaded with mink and fox stoles.\n\n\u201cGotta get these on a truck goin\u2019 to the Merchandise Mart,\u201d Izzy said, and pushed on toward the freight elevator.\n\nA couple of Saturdays after that, all four of the brothers were playing bridge, when Louie said, \u201cYou hear the Rostov boy got killed?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe delivery cart kid?\u201d asked Ike.\n\n\u201cYes. Apparently he tried to rob a liquor store on Huron the other night and the clerk shot him in the back before he could get away.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know about his parents?\u201d asked Nate.\n\n\u201cWhat about them?\u201d Jack asked.\n\n\u201cThey were survivors of Auschwitz.\u201d\n\n\u201cHorrible,\u201d said Ike. \u201cImagine how they must feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Auschwitz?\u201d asked Roy.\n\nThe men were silent for a few moments before Nate spoke.\n\n\u201cIt was a concentration camp, a prison death camp during the war where the Germans murdered Jews.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey also murdered Gypsies and communists,\u201d said Ike, \u201cbut mostly Jews.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Rostov\u2019s parents are still alive,\u201d Roy said.\n\n\u201cSome prisoners were rescued by the Allies before the Nazis could kill them,\u201d said Louie.\n\n\u201cHow many people did they kill?\u201d asked Roy.\n\n\u201cToo many to count,\u201d said his grandfather. \u201cThe accepted figure is six million.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore,\u201d said Louie. \u201cThey murdered more.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo think that the parents escaped the Holocaust,\u201d Nate said. \u201cThey come to America and their child is shot down in the street like a wild animal.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had a gun,\u201d Roy said. \u201cHe showed it to me.\u201d\n\nThe men all looked at Roy.\n\n\u201cIt was a snub-nosed .38,\u201d he said. \u201cIzzy told me he was going to stick up a gas station and move to Miami Beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of home life could the boy have had?\u201d said Nate.\n\nRoy looked out a window onto State Street. The Chicago Theatre was showing Alan Ladd in The Badlanders. Clumps of brown dirt the size of pigeons were blowing through the gray air.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s play cards,\u201d said Ike.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The summer I turned eleven, our small town felt like it was holding its breath. Dust settled thick on the streets, the heat shimmering off the blacktop like a mirage. That was the summer I met Eddie.\n\nEddie was the new delivery worker for the local grocery store, a lanky guy in his mid-twenties with a mop of unruly hair and a smile that could charm the stripes off a zebra. He drove an ancient, battered pickup that rattled down the street like it was barely holding together, and he always had a cigarette dangling from his lips, the smoke curling up into the sky like a question mark.\n\nHe\u2019d show up at our house every Thursday, hauling bags of groceries to the front porch while my mother fussed over the order. I\u2019d sit on the steps, watching him with a mix of curiosity and envy. He moved with a sort of reckless energy, like he was always on the brink of something exciting.\n\n\u201cHey, kid,\u201d he said to me one afternoon, wiping the sweat off his brow. \u201cYou ever ride in a truck like this?\u201d\n\nI shook my head, my eyes wide. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, a sound like gravel rolling down a hill. \u201cSir? Man, you make me feel old. Name\u2019s Eddie. Wanna come see something cool?\u201d\n\nMy mother would\u2019ve had a fit if she knew, but something about Eddie made me trust him. I hopped off the steps and followed him to the truck. He opened the door with a creak and gestured for me to climb in. The seat was cracked and worn, the dashboard littered with old receipts and empty soda cans. But to me, it was a treasure trove.\n\n\u201cCheck this out,\u201d Eddie said, reaching into the glove compartment. He pulled out a small, leather-bound notebook and handed it to me. \u201cThese are my plans. Gonna open my own shop someday. Get outta this town, you know?\u201d\n\nI flipped through the pages, filled with sketches and notes. It was like looking into a secret world, one where Eddie was more than just a delivery worker. He was a dreamer, a builder, an architect of his own future.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really cool,\u201d I said, handing it back to him.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his eyes distant. \u201cJust gotta save up enough cash. Won\u2019t be long now.\u201d\n\nFrom that day on, I looked forward to Thursdays. Eddie would tell me stories about his dreams, about the places he wanted to go and the things he wanted to do. He had a way of making the world seem bigger, more full of possibilities. He talked about opening a bike shop, then a caf\u00e9, then a music store. His dreams were as wild and shifting as the clouds in the summer sky.\n\nBut there was an edge to him, too. Sometimes, I\u2019d catch a glimpse of it in the way he clenched his jaw or stared off into the distance. It was like he was running from something, and no matter how fast he went, it was always right behind him.\n\nOne Thursday, Eddie didn\u2019t show up. I waited on the steps all afternoon, my heart sinking with every passing minute. My mother said he probably just had the day off, but I could tell she was worried, too. The next week, another delivery worker came, a grizzled old man who didn\u2019t say much.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to Eddie?\u201d I asked, my voice trembling.\n\nThe man looked at me with sad eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear, kid? Eddie got into some trouble. Car crash. Didn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nThe words hit me like a punch to the gut. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Eddie, with his big dreams and easy smile, gone just like that. It didn\u2019t seem fair. It didn\u2019t seem real.\n\nIn the days that followed, I learned more about Eddie\u2019s life than I ever had while he was alive. He\u2019d grown up in a rough part of town, raised by a single mother who worked three jobs to make ends meet. He\u2019d dropped out of high school to help support his family, taking on whatever work he could find. The dreams he shared with me were more than just fantasies; they were his way out, his hope for something better.\n\nAs I pieced together his story, I began to understand the weight he carried. Eddie had lived a hard life, one filled with struggle and sacrifice. But he\u2019d never let it crush his spirit. He\u2019d held onto his dreams with a tenacity that both inspired and haunted me.\n\nI spent a lot of time that summer sitting on the front steps, thinking about Eddie. His death left me with a gnawing sense of loss, but also a burning question: Why do some people get trapped by their circumstances while others manage to break free? Was it fate, family, luck, or something else entirely?\n\nOne afternoon, I found myself flipping through an old book my father had left behind. It was filled with stories of heroes and adventurers, people who faced insurmountable odds and came out the other side stronger. Eddie had been like one of those heroes to me, but his story had ended too soon.\n\nI realized then that Eddie\u2019s dreams didn\u2019t have to die with him. They could live on in the people he\u2019d touched, in the lessons he\u2019d taught me. He\u2019d shown me that no matter how tough life gets, you can always dream, always strive for something better.\n\nAs the summer faded into fall, I made a promise to myself. I\u2019d keep Eddie\u2019s dreams alive by chasing my own, by never letting the weight of the world crush my spirit. And in doing so, I\u2019d honor the memory of the brash delivery worker who\u2019d taught me to see the world not just as it was, but as it could be.",
        "story_b": "The first time Jake met Sam, it was a day etched with the chaos of summer rain. The kind that makes the city streets gleam like polished mirrors and sends pedestrians scurrying for cover. Jake, a boy with wide eyes and a collection of model airplanes, was perched on the stoop of his apartment building, watching the world ripple through the rain.\n\nSam's arrival was heralded by the screech of brakes and the dull thud of a delivery box tumbling from the back of his battered truck. The box burst open, spilling its contents\u2014a dozen soccer balls\u2014into the glistening street. Jake's laughter bubbled over, catching Sam's attention as he wrestled the balls back into their cardboard prison.\n\n\"Hey, kid! You ever play soccer in the rain?\" Sam shouted, his voice a gravelly mix of challenge and amusement.\n\nJake shook his head, intrigued by the man's audacity. \"Not unless I want to catch a cold.\"\n\nSam chuckled, his grin wide beneath the brim of a signature red cap, the kind that seemed part of his very identity. \"Cold's just a myth parents use to keep kids inside. You help me out here, and I'll tell you a secret about these old city streets.\"\n\nIntrigued by the promise of adventure, Jake leapt into action, chasing after the rogue soccer balls. It was the beginning of an unlikely friendship, one where Sam's brash energy met Jake's youthful curiosity head-on.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Jake found himself tagging along with Sam on his delivery routes, the city becoming their shared playground. Sam navigated the bustling avenues with a reckless grace, the delivery truck rumbling like a beast of burden. To Jake, those rides were akin to flying\u2014unbound and exhilarating.\n\n\"Ever think of being a pilot?\" Jake asked one day, as they watched planes soar over the city's skyline.\n\nSam's eyes flickered with a wistful glow. \"I used to dream about it,\" he confessed, his voice softening. \"Thought I'd be flying over the world by now, not just driving through it.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you?\" Jake's question hung in the air, innocent and probing.\n\nSam shrugged, a shadow crossing his face. \"Life's got a way of clipping your wings, kid. But dreams\u2014they're like kites in a storm. You hold on tight, even when the wind tries to snatch 'em away.\"\n\nJake was mesmerized by Sam's stories, each one a piece of the puzzle that was Sam's life. There was the tale of a tattoo etched in ink and memory on Sam's forearm\u2014a tangled knot of lines and symbols that hinted at a past Jake couldn't quite decipher. And there were the cryptic phone calls, where Sam's voice would drop to a low murmur, leaving Jake to wonder about the stories left unspoken.\n\nDespite the mystery, Jake saw in Sam a resilience that shone through the cracks of his hardened exterior. Sam's laughter, a rough melody, became a constant in Jake's days, a counterpoint to the city's restless symphony.\n\nBut fate, ever the capricious playwright, had its own script. One evening, as the city basked in the golden light of a setting sun, Jake overheard a conversation that set his world tilting.\n\n\"Yeah, I know it's risky, but what choice do I have?\" Sam's voice was tight, edged with desperation. \"I can't keep running forever.\"\n\nThe words were a puzzle Jake couldn't solve, their weight pressing down on him like the gathering dusk. He wanted to ask Sam, to unravel the tangled threads of his life, but before he could, the opportunity slipped through his fingers like sand.\n\nIt was a few days later, on a morning draped in fog, that the news came. Sam was gone, the victim of a collision on the very streets he had navigated with such reckless abandon. The world felt suddenly smaller to Jake, the loss an echo that reverberated in the empty spaces Sam once filled.\n\nIn the aftermath, Jake found himself standing at the edge of the city park, a place they had often visited. The park was a patchwork of memories\u2014of laughter shared, of dreams whispered into the wind.\n\nJake closed his eyes, the scent of gasoline and the distant hum of traffic enveloping him. He thought of Sam, of kites caught in storms, and of dreams that seemed to soar just out of reach. There was a lesson there, Jake realized, about the fragility of life and the tenacity of dreams, and how history can weigh heavy on the present.\n\nHe opened his eyes, staring at the sky where planes traced invisible paths. Sam's absence was a void, but within it, Jake found a spark of understanding. The world was vast and unpredictable, yet filled with moments that could shape a lifetime.\n\nAs Jake stood at the crossroads of memory and future, he felt the weight of Sam's story settle like a gentle hand on his shoulder. Their friendship had been a brief, brilliant flame, but it had left a mark on Jake's heart, a reminder that even in loss, there was a kind of grace.\n\nAnd so, Jake took a deep breath, letting the wind carry his thoughts skyward, and stepped forward into the world, ready to chase his own dreams with the same fierce determination Sam had shown him.",

He pulled out a small, leather-bound notebook and handed it to me. \u201cThese are my plans. Gonna open my own shop someday. Get outta this town, you know?\u201d\n\nI flipped through the pages, filled with sketches and notes. It was like looking into a secret world, one where Eddie was more than just a delivery worker. He was a dreamer, a builder, an architect of his own future.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really cool,\u201d I said, handing it back to him.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his eyes distant. \u201cJust gotta save up enough cash. Won\u2019t be long now.\u201d\n\nFrom that day on, I looked forward to Thursdays. Eddie would tell me stories about his dreams, about the places he wanted to go and the things he wanted to do. He had a way of making the world seem bigger, more full of possibilities. He talked about opening a bike shop, then a caf\u00e9, then a music store. His dreams were as wild and shifting as the clouds in the summer sky.\n\nBut there was an edge to him, too. Sometimes, I\u2019d catch a glimpse of it in the way he clenched his jaw or stared off into the distance. It was like he was running from something, and no matter how fast he went, it was always right behind him.\n\nOne Thursday, Eddie didn\u2019t show up. I waited on the steps all afternoon, my heart sinking with every passing minute. My mother said he probably just had the day off, but I could tell she was worried, too. The next week, another delivery worker came, a grizzled old man who didn\u2019t say much.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to Eddie?\u201d I asked, my voice trembling.\n\nThe man looked at me with sad eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear, kid? Eddie got into some trouble. Car crash. Didn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nThe words hit me like a punch to the gut. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Eddie, with his big dreams and easy smile, gone just like that. It didn\u2019t seem fair. It didn\u2019t seem real.\n\nIn the days that followed, I learned more about Eddie\u2019s life than I ever had while he was alive. He\u2019d grown up in a rough part of town, raised by a single mother who worked three jobs to make ends meet. He\u2019d dropped out of high school to help support his family, taking on whatever work he could find. The dreams he shared with me were more than just fantasies; they were his way out, his hope for something better.\n\nAs I pieced together his story, I began to understand the weight he carried. Eddie had lived a hard life, one filled with struggle and sacrifice. But he\u2019d never let it crush his spirit. He\u2019d held onto his dreams with a tenacity that both inspired and haunted me.\n\nI spent a lot of time that summer sitting on the front steps, thinking about Eddie. His death left me with a gnawing sense of loss, but also a burning question: Why do some people get trapped by their circumstances while others manage to break free? Was it fate, family, luck, or something else entirely?\n\nOne afternoon, I found myself flipping through an old book my father had left behind. It was filled with stories of heroes and adventurers, people who faced insurmountable odds and came out the other side stronger. Eddie had been like one of those heroes to me, but his story had ended too soon.\n\nI realized then that Eddie\u2019s dreams didn\u2019t have to die with him. They could live on in the people he\u2019d touched, in the lessons he\u2019d taught me. He\u2019d shown me that no matter how tough life gets, you can always dream, always strive for something better.\n\nAs the summer faded into fall, I made a promise to myself. I\u2019d keep Eddie\u2019s dreams alive by chasing my own, by never letting the weight of the world crush my spirit. And in doing so, I\u2019d honor the memory of the brash delivery worker who\u2019d taught me to see the world not just as it was, but as it could be.",
        "story_b": "The rumble of the delivery truck echoed through the narrow alley as it came to a halt. Jonah, wide-eyed and curious, watched from his perch on the stoop as the driver, a burly man with a grin that could light up a room, hopped out. The man was Carlos, a delivery worker known for his quick wit and even quicker hands.\n\n\"What's the scoop, kid?\" Carlos called out, adjusting his cap as he approached Jonah.\n\n\"Not much, just waiting for my mom to get back,\" Jonah replied, kicking his feet against the step.\n\nCarlos nodded, leaning against his truck. \"You call that a sandwich?\" he said, pointing to Jonah's lunch. \"My grandma could do better with her eyes closed.\"\n\nJonah laughed, taking a bite anyway. \"What do you want to do after all these deliveries, Carlos?\"\n\nCarlos's eyes sparkled with a dream only he could see. \"Open a restaurant,\" he said, like it was the most natural thing in the world. \"A place where everyone can taste my grandpa's empanadas. He came here with nothing but a suitcase and a recipe.\"\n\n\"Empanadas?\" Jonah echoed, his interest piqued.\n\n\"Yeah, kid. The best you\u2019ll ever taste,\" Carlos said, patting his stomach. \"One day, I'll have a place with a line out the door.\"\n\nTheir conversations continued like this over the weeks, Carlos teasing Jonah about his crush on the girl down the street. \"You better deliver that love letter before she finds someone else,\" he\u2019d joke, his laughter bouncing off the brick walls.\n\nBut there was always an edge to Carlos, a dangerous gleam in his eyes when he talked about hustling to make it in the world. \"You gotta keep your head up, Jonah,\" he'd say. \"Life's a street fight, and you gotta be ready.\"\n\nOne rainy afternoon, Jonah found himself in Carlos's truck, the smell of fresh bread wafting from the bakery as they passed by. Jonah loved these moments, the city blurring past, Carlos recounting tales from his family's history.\n\n\"Do you think we're stuck with the life we're given?\" Jonah asked, staring out the window.\n\nCarlos shrugged, his hands steady on the wheel. \"History's just a bunch of stories, kid. It's up to us to write our own.\"\n\nThe words lingered with Jonah long after he climbed out of the truck, a new layer of understanding settling over him.\n\nThen one day, the truck didn\u2019t rumble down the street. Carlos didn't hop out with his usual grin. Instead, whispers spread through the neighborhood about a delivery gone wrong, a confrontation that turned deadly.\n\nJonah sat on the stoop, staring at the spot where Carlos's truck usually parked, his mind reeling. The vibrant tales of empanadas and dreams of a bustling restaurant felt like fragile memories slipping through his fingers.\n\nThe next morning, Jonah decided to visit Carlos's family. He imagined how it would be, stepping into their home, filled with the aroma of spices and stories of old times. He wanted to pay his respects, to connect with the roots of the man who had shared so much with him.\n\nCarlos's mother opened the door, her eyes red-rimmed but warm. \"You must be Jonah,\" she said, ushering him inside.\n\nThe house was small but filled with laughter and tears, photos of Carlos and his family lining the walls. Jonah listened as stories were shared, tales of Carlos\u2019s relentless spirit and the sacrifices his family had made.\n\n\"Fate's a funny thing,\" Carlos's uncle said, handing Jonah a plate of empanadas. \"Carlos always believed he was meant for more. And in a way, he was right.\"\n\nJonah nodded, biting into the empanada. It was as if he could taste the legacy, the dreams, and the determination that had fueled Carlos's life.\n\nAs Jonah left, he paused to look at the sky, a kaleidoscope of colors painting the horizon. He thought about fate, family, and the weight of history. The loss of Carlos left a void, but it also ignited a fire within Jonah\u2014a desire to honor the dreams of those who came before him.\n\nSitting back on the stoop, Jonah reflected on their last conversation, the way Carlos's eyes had lit up when talking about his restaurant. \"You gotta hustle to make it in this world,\" Carlos had said.\n\nJonah knew he would carry those words with him, a reminder that while history was just stories, it was up to him to write his own chapter. He promised himself he would remember Carlos not just for his untimely death but for the passion and dreams he had shared.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, one day Jonah would open a restaurant, the kind Carlos had always dreamed of, with a line out the door and the world tasting the empanadas that carried a legacy.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, Jonah felt a sense of calm, knowing that Carlos\u2019s story, though tragically cut short, had left an indelible mark on his own. The weight of history was heavy, but it was a burden he was willing to bear, fueled by the dreams of a brash delivery worker who had taught him that fate was something you could change with enough determination and heart.",

        "prompt": "A writer, desperate to please his mother, attempts to craft a children's story, only to find her critique sharper than any editor's and her demand for a happy ending far more challenging than he anticipated.",
        "ground_truth": "To please his mother, a writer attempts a children\u2019s story. The mother doesn\u2019t usually read fiction but will read a children\u2019s story and, if it\u2019s good, show it to all her friends. In his mother\u2019s eyes, the writer is, by and large, an anomaly. She believes that writing is a skill, not a vocation, and to make up stories for anyone other than children is a silly way to occupy one\u2019s time.\n\nSo here is his attempt at a story that maybe his mother will read and show her friends.\n\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a clown. The clown lived in a village that had no other clowns, for each village was allotted only one. The job of the clown was to scare some children but amuse others. He had balloons and face paint and could juggle. Half the time, he appeared without warning, and the other half he provided notice of the when, where, and what. Children had a fifty-fifty chance of receiving each option: the clown could either burst out from under their bed to juggle hatchets (no notice) or appear at their birthday party to juggle balls (notice given). If a child was amused once, there was no guarantee that this would happen again. Still, the chance of that child\u2019s being scared was no higher than it would have been, because, in this fair and made-up world, the clown existed to teach a lesson: that events of fear and events of joy are independent, and independent events must have independent probabilities.\n\nThe writer thinks this last sentence will please his mother. In her home country, she\u2019d taught math and begun work on a textbook, but then came instability, uprisings, and she and his father had had to leave. For a long time and openly, she\u2019d hoped that her son would carry on her work. \u201cMy son, the writer of textbooks\u201d is how she would have introduced him\u2014instead of simply \u201cmy son.\u201d\n\nThe mother now lives in a facility, and he visits her there. He gives her a printout of the children\u2019s story, and she reads it. From bed, she says, \u201cYou must have footnotes with proper notation. How else is a child supposed to understand that for independent events the probability of A equals the probability of A given B, and the probability of B equals the probability of B given A? It\u2019s not clear. But what\u2019s clear is that you\u2019re writing about me,\u201d she says, tapping her finger on the page at the word \u201cclown.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re clearly writing about your father and me, and none of my friends will want to read that.\u201d\n\nThe writer\u2019s father is no longer with them and was neither a funny man nor a person who had opinions about clowns. He and the writer\u2019s mother had been married for forty-seven years, most of which were arduous and sombre. In the new country, they\u2019d had to work menial jobs. It did not help that the father had a horrendous temper, made worse by his belief that everyone around him was belittling him, and by the fact that everyone was. So he raged and lashed out at home and left all the bathroom cleaning to his wife.\n\n\u201cAlso, I want a happy ending,\u201d the mother says, folding up the story and setting it on her nightstand. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to write happy.\u201d\n\nHe asks how she could know that if she has never read anything of his.\n\n\u201cI hear things from my friends,\u201d she says. \u201cThey all say you\u2019re too serious and no one knows what you mean.\u201d\n\nBecause she raised and didn\u2019t abandon him, because of her troubles and the unfinished textbook, the writer returns to his story to see what he can do.\n\nOne day, the children gathered in the village square to take a vote. Future clown encounters, they argued, had to either all be happy or all be scary. One of these options had to win, and they would not accept an in-between. They needed to have certainty. They voted unanimously for happiness, of course, and then, in parallel lines, wearing hats and safety equipment, the children marched to the hut at the edge of the village where the clown lived. They barred the door and windows from the outside. They lit a torch and told the clown inside that if he didn\u2019t change his metrics, they would burn down the hut. The clown refused: the rules of his tenure were fixed, and if he gave in to the children\u2019s request the village would oust him and replace him with another clown. The children encircled the hut and held hands. They chanted gibberish and made menacing expressions that were subpar. Then they threw the torch onto the hut\u2019s straw roof. \u201cFear and joy!\u201d the clown lectured, until he suffocated and could no longer be heard. The children cheered as the flaming hut caved in and crushed him; then, in parallel lines, they marched back to the village square, where the adults were waiting.\n\nHaving learned what the children had done, the adults were grim. With the clown gone, they now had to scare or amuse the children themselves. Up to this point, the adults had had a contract of emotional neutrality. They dealt with the feeding, sheltering, and not abandoning, while the clown dealt with the rest. News travelled to other villages of what the children had done, and the children of other villages followed suit, which meant that clowns were soon in short supply and the over-all profession lost its prestige. As the adults of these murderous, arsonist children were forced to take on new roles, they found the rule of independent probabilities failing them. Some could bring only fear, and the probability of future fear was dependent on the probability of past fear, as well as on the parent\u2019s over-all chance of penitence. Others could only bring joy, and, likewise, that probability was dependent on other factors, such as the children\u2019s response to repeated joy, to guaranteed joy, and to the adults\u2019 ability to sustain joy through their socioeconomic status.\n\nThe clowns never returned, and the adults became parents, and their children became adults who begot more children, whom they had to parent. Thus was born, in these villages, the idea of conditional probabilities and, with it, the practice of conditional love.\n\nAfter the mother reads the story, she is silent for long enough that the son thinks she has died, in bed, with her eyes open. He waves a frantic hand in her face until she blinks.\n\n\u201cYou must be making fun of me,\u201d she says.\n\nThe writer says he would never dare.\n\n\u201cYou are,\u201d she says, with patience and firmness.\n\nThe writer truly would never dare.\n\nThe mother looks at her son in disbelief that she has brought such a person into the world. A person incapable of writing a children\u2019s story or a happy ending. Is this a result of too much imagination or too little? Is this revenge? \u2666\n\n",
        "story_a": "The typewriter keys clattered like a discordant symphony in the dimly lit study. Julian's fingers hovered above them, searching for the right words, the perfect cadence that might conjure the elusive approval of his mother. His mother, who had devoured books to escape a life of compromises, who had been the first to place a pencil in his hand and urge him to draw the world as he saw it. She had never asked for much, but now she had asked for this. A children's story, bright and optimistic, to read to her first grandchild. \n\nJulian glanced at the half-empty glass of bourbon on the desk, the liquid amber catching the light from the single desk lamp. He took a sip, feeling the warmth spread through his chest, and turned back to the blank page in the typewriter. He had written for magazines and literary journals, had his work dissected by critics and professors, but nothing had prepared him for this\u2014creating a tale simple enough for a child but profound enough to satisfy his mother's discerning eye.\n\nThe study door creaked open. His mother, Margaret, entered with an air of quiet determination. Though her hair had turned silver, her eyes retained the same sharpness that had once quashed his adolescent rebellions with a single glance.\n\n\"How's it coming along?\" she asked, her voice carrying the weight of expectation.\n\nJulian hesitated. \"It's... a work in progress.\"\n\nMargaret moved to the window, drawing back the heavy curtains to let in the pale morning light. \"I don't understand why it's taking so long. It's just a children's story.\"\n\nHe sighed, running a hand through his disheveled hair. \"It's not just any story, Mother. It has to be right.\"\n\nShe turned, her gaze piercing through his feeble defense. \"It has to have a happy ending. That's all I ask.\"\n\nJulian nodded, though he felt the weight of her request like an anchor. Happy endings had never come naturally to him; his characters were often left grappling with their flaws, their resolutions ambiguous, their lives mirroring the complexities of his own. But for his mother, he would try.\n\nThat night, as the house settled into its nocturnal rhythms, Julian sat alone in the study, the typewriter's clack-clack a steady companion. He began with a village nestled in a valley, where sunlight kissed the rooftops and laughter echoed through the cobblestone streets. The protagonist, a young girl named Clara, was curious and kind-hearted, traits his mother had always valued. Clara's journey led her through enchanted forests and talking animals, each encounter a lesson in kindness and courage.\n\nDays turned into weeks. Julian's desk became a battlefield of crumpled pages and ink stains. His mother's visits were frequent, her critiques sharp but fair. \"Clara's too passive,\" she would say, or \"The dialogue needs more warmth.\" He absorbed her feedback, revising tirelessly, but the happy ending remained elusive.\n\nOne afternoon, as Julian sat staring at the latest draft, Margaret entered without knocking. She carried a small, worn book in her hands. \"I want to show you something,\" she said, placing the book in front of him. It was a collection of fairy tales, the cover faded from years of handling.\n\nJulian opened the book, the pages brittle under his fingers. He recognized the stories\u2014ones she had read to him as a child. \"Why are you showing me this?\"\n\nMargaret's eyes softened with nostalgia. \"These stories... they gave me hope when I needed it most. I want Clara's story to do the same for your niece.\"\n\nJulian closed the book gently. \"Hope isn't always easy to write.\"\n\nHis mother smiled, a rare tenderness in her expression. \"No, but it's necessary.\"\n\nThat night, Julian dreamed of his childhood, the nights spent wrapped in blankets, listening to his mother's voice as she read from the fairy tale book. He remembered the comfort of those stories, the way they had painted a world where problems could be solved and happiness was attainable.\n\nHe awoke with a sense of clarity. Returning to the typewriter, he rewrote Clara's journey, infusing it with the hope his mother had spoken of. Clara faced trials, but each one brought her closer to understanding her own strength. The forest, once dark and foreboding, became a place of discovery and friendship.\n\nAnd the ending\u2014Julian crafted it with care. Clara returned to her village, not just victorious but transformed. She had learned that happiness was not the absence of hardship but the presence of love and courage. The village celebrated her return, the air filled with music and laughter, and Clara knew she was home.\n\nJulian typed the final words, a sense of quiet satisfaction settling over him. He placed the manuscript in a folder and carried it to his mother's room. She was sitting by the window, knitting a blanket for the baby.\n\n\"Is it finished?\" she asked, looking up.\n\nHe nodded, handing her the folder. \"I hope you like it.\"\n\nMargaret took the manuscript and began to read. Julian watched her face, searching for any sign of approval or disappointment. When she finished, she closed the folder and looked at him, her eyes glistening.\n\n\"It's beautiful,\" she said softly. \"Clara's journey... it's everything I hoped it would be.\"\n\nJulian felt a swell of relief and pride. \"Thank you, Mother.\"\n\nShe reached out, squeezing his hand. \"You have a gift, Julian. Never forget that.\"\n\nAs he left her room, Julian felt a weight lift from his shoulders. The story he had crafted for his mother had become more than just a tale for a child; it was a bridge between them, a testament to the power of hope and the enduring bond of family.\n\nIn the quiet of his study, Julian sat down at the typewriter once more. He began to write a letter to his niece, the newest member of their family, sharing with her the story of Clara and the lessons she had learned. As he wrote, he realized that the happy ending his mother had demanded was not just for Clara, but for all of them.",
        "story_b": "In the tiny corner of his cramped apartment that he generously called an office, Louis stared at the computer screen, a sea of crumpled drafts and ink-stained fingers around him. His mother, a retired librarian with opinions as sharp as the corners of the books she shelved, had one simple request: a children\u2019s story. Not just any children\u2019s story, but one with a happy ending, the kind that would leave the youngest of readers with a smile rather than existential dread.\n\nLouis had written moody novels, short stories that left readers questioning their life choices, and even an article on the socio-political implications of garden gnomes. But a children's story? That was foreign territory, akin to a mathematician suddenly asked to compose a sonnet.\n\nHe glanced at the draft titled \"The Lonely Dragon,\" where a dragon named Fergus found solace not in fiery destruction but in knitting. But there was a problem: Fergus\u2019s kingdom was too tangled in its own yarn-based economy to find any resolution. His mother had looked at him over her glasses and said, \"Louis, I think you might be overthinking it.\"\n\nOverthinking was his forte. He began again, his fingers tapping rhythmically against the keyboard, as if trying to coax the words into aligning themselves into something coherent and, more importantly, mother-approved. The sun dipped lower, casting a warm orange glow over his cluttered desk, but the glow brought no warmth to his creative turmoil.\n\nHis next attempt involved a bunny who couldn\u2019t hop. An allegory for self-acceptance, he thought. But his mother, after reading the first page, had simply sighed. \"Louis, children need to believe they can hop,\" she said, her critique weighing as heavily as a stack of unreturned library books.\n\n\"Why can\u2019t I just write a tragedy?\" Louis muttered to himself, imagining the bunny facing an existential crisis, pondering the futility of hopping in a world where foxes wore suits. His mother\u2019s voice echoed in his mind: \"Because, dear, life is tragic enough.\"\n\nThe doorbell rang, jolting him from his thoughts. It was his mother, with her usual punctuality and a casserole dish balanced precariously in her hands. She swept into the room, her presence filling the space with a mix of lavender perfume and unconditional love, tempered with a healthy dose of criticism.\n\n\"Have you made any progress?\" she asked, setting the dish down and peering over his shoulder at the screen. Louis quickly minimized the document, hoping she wouldn\u2019t notice the lack of happy endings in his digital wake.\n\n\"Uh, sort of,\" he replied, scratching the back of his head. \"I was thinking about a story where the protagonist tries really hard to please someone important to them, but\u2014\"\n\n\"But what, Louis? They fail and learn a valuable lesson about self-worth?\" Her eyes twinkled with a humor that was both mocking and endearing.\n\n\"Something like that,\" he admitted, unable to keep a straight face.\n\n\"Well, tell me what you\u2019ve got,\" she said, settling into the chair opposite his desk, her expectation as palpable as the casserole's aroma.\n\nHe hesitated, then launched into the tale of Fergus again, trying to reframe it as a journey of creative self-discovery. His mother listened patiently, nodding in places, her expression a canvas of practiced neutrality. When he finished, she took a moment, as if weighing her words carefully.\n\n\"It\u2019s charming, Louis,\" she began. \"But don\u2019t you think Fergus could find happiness in something simpler? Perhaps he meets a friend who appreciates his knitting, someone who needs a scarf, maybe?\"\n\n\"Like a cold prince or something?\" Louis suggested, his voice tinged with irony.\n\n\"Exactly!\" Her eyes lit up with the enthusiasm of someone who\u2019d just discovered a first edition in a pile of paperbacks. \"And they become friends. That\u2019s what children need, Louis\u2014friendship and warmth.\"\n\nLouis sighed, a dramatic exhale that spoke volumes. \"Isn\u2019t that a bit... predictable?\" he ventured, imagining the prince not as a noble savior but a tax auditor, something more akin to real life.\n\n\"Predictability isn\u2019t a flaw in a children\u2019s story,\" she countered, a smile softening the edges of her critique. \"It\u2019s a comfort.\"\n\nHe nodded, the weight of her words sinking in. The challenge wasn\u2019t in the writing itself but in crafting a narrative that fit into a world where happy endings were not just desired but essential. It was a world he was still learning to navigate.\n\nAs she left, with promises to return for dinner, Louis stared at the screen once more. The cursor blinked expectantly, a metronome ticking down the moments until inspiration struck. He thought about Fergus and the prince, about knitting and castles and the absurdity of it all. And suddenly, the story unfolded in his mind\u2014a tale of warmth and unlikely alliances, of dragons and princes finding common ground.\n\nThe next day, he presented the revised story to his mother. Her eyes crinkled with delight as she read the final pages, where Fergus and the prince, wrapped in a vibrant tapestry of friendship, watched the sunset from a castle turret.\n\n\"It\u2019s perfect, Louis,\" she said, her voice thick with emotion. \"I knew you could do it.\"\n\nLouis smiled, a mixture of relief and pride washing over him. It wasn\u2019t the story he\u2019d set out to write, but it was one that felt right, both for him and for her. The ambiguity of the process\u2014the struggle, the compromise, the unexpected resolution\u2014mirrored the complexities of their relationship.\n\nLater, as he sat alone in his office, the satisfaction of his mother's approval settled over him. The story, with its layers of irony and humor, had found its way to a happy ending, even if the journey there was fraught with doubts and drafts. And perhaps, he mused, that was the real story all along\u2014a tale of familial expectations and creative pressure, resolved not with a bang but a contented sigh.\n\nHis mother\u2019s laughter echoed in his mind, a comforting reminder that, sometimes, predictability was exactly what the heart needed. And in that small corner of his world, amidst the chaos of creativity, Louis found peace in knowing that, for now, he had managed to craft his own kind of happy ending.",

How else is a child supposed to understand that for independent events the probability of A equals the probability of A given B, and the probability of B equals the probability of B given A? It\u2019s not clear. But what\u2019s clear is that you\u2019re writing about me,\u201d she says, tapping her finger on the page at the word \u201cclown.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re clearly writing about your father and me, and none of my friends will want to read that.\u201d\n\nThe writer\u2019s father is no longer with them and was neither a funny man nor a person who had opinions about clowns. He and the writer\u2019s mother had been married for forty-seven years, most of which were arduous and sombre. In the new country, they\u2019d had to work menial jobs. It did not help that the father had a horrendous temper, made worse by his belief that everyone around him was belittling him, and by the fact that everyone was. So he raged and lashed out at home and left all the bathroom cleaning to his wife.\n\n\u201cAlso, I want a happy ending,\u201d the mother says, folding up the story and setting it on her nightstand. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to write happy.\u201d\n\nHe asks how she could know that if she has never read anything of his.\n\n\u201cI hear things from my friends,\u201d she says. \u201cThey all say you\u2019re too serious and no one knows what you mean.\u201d\n\nBecause she raised and didn\u2019t abandon him, because of her troubles and the unfinished textbook, the writer returns to his story to see what he can do.\n\nOne day, the children gathered in the village square to take a vote. Future clown encounters, they argued, had to either all be happy or all be scary. One of these options had to win, and they would not accept an in-between. They needed to have certainty. They voted unanimously for happiness, of course, and then, in parallel lines, wearing hats and safety equipment, the children marched to the hut at the edge of the village where the clown lived. They barred the door and windows from the outside. They lit a torch and told the clown inside that if he didn\u2019t change his metrics, they would burn down the hut. The clown refused: the rules of his tenure were fixed, and if he gave in to the children\u2019s request the village would oust him and replace him with another clown. The children encircled the hut and held hands. They chanted gibberish and made menacing expressions that were subpar. Then they threw the torch onto the hut\u2019s straw roof. \u201cFear and joy!\u201d the clown lectured, until he suffocated and could no longer be heard. The children cheered as the flaming hut caved in and crushed him; then, in parallel lines, they marched back to the village square, where the adults were waiting.\n\nHaving learned what the children had done, the adults were grim. With the clown gone, they now had to scare or amuse the children themselves. Up to this point, the adults had had a contract of emotional neutrality. They dealt with the feeding, sheltering, and not abandoning, while the clown dealt with the rest. News travelled to other villages of what the children had done, and the children of other villages followed suit, which meant that clowns were soon in short supply and the over-all profession lost its prestige. As the adults of these murderous, arsonist children were forced to take on new roles, they found the rule of independent probabilities failing them. Some could bring only fear, and the probability of future fear was dependent on the probability of past fear, as well as on the parent\u2019s over-all chance of penitence. Others could only bring joy, and, likewise, that probability was dependent on other factors, such as the children\u2019s response to repeated joy, to guaranteed joy, and to the adults\u2019 ability to sustain joy through their socioeconomic status.\n\nThe clowns never returned, and the adults became parents, and their children became adults who begot more children, whom they had to parent. Thus was born, in these villages, the idea of conditional probabilities and, with it, the practice of conditional love.\n\nAfter the mother reads the story, she is silent for long enough that the son thinks she has died, in bed, with her eyes open. He waves a frantic hand in her face until she blinks.\n\n\u201cYou must be making fun of me,\u201d she says.\n\nThe writer says he would never dare.\n\n\u201cYou are,\u201d she says, with patience and firmness.\n\nThe writer truly would never dare.\n\nThe mother looks at her son in disbelief that she has brought such a person into the world. A person incapable of writing a children\u2019s story or a happy ending. Is this a result of too much imagination or too little? Is this revenge? \u2666\n\n",
        "story_a": "The typewriter keys clattered like a discordant symphony in the dimly lit study. Julian's fingers hovered above them, searching for the right words, the perfect cadence that might conjure the elusive approval of his mother. His mother, who had devoured books to escape a life of compromises, who had been the first to place a pencil in his hand and urge him to draw the world as he saw it. She had never asked for much, but now she had asked for this. A children's story, bright and optimistic, to read to her first grandchild. \n\nJulian glanced at the half-empty glass of bourbon on the desk, the liquid amber catching the light from the single desk lamp. He took a sip, feeling the warmth spread through his chest, and turned back to the blank page in the typewriter. He had written for magazines and literary journals, had his work dissected by critics and professors, but nothing had prepared him for this\u2014creating a tale simple enough for a child but profound enough to satisfy his mother's discerning eye.\n\nThe study door creaked open. His mother, Margaret, entered with an air of quiet determination. Though her hair had turned silver, her eyes retained the same sharpness that had once quashed his adolescent rebellions with a single glance.\n\n\"How's it coming along?\" she asked, her voice carrying the weight of expectation.\n\nJulian hesitated. \"It's... a work in progress.\"\n\nMargaret moved to the window, drawing back the heavy curtains to let in the pale morning light. \"I don't understand why it's taking so long. It's just a children's story.\"\n\nHe sighed, running a hand through his disheveled hair. \"It's not just any story, Mother. It has to be right.\"\n\nShe turned, her gaze piercing through his feeble defense. \"It has to have a happy ending. That's all I ask.\"\n\nJulian nodded, though he felt the weight of her request like an anchor. Happy endings had never come naturally to him; his characters were often left grappling with their flaws, their resolutions ambiguous, their lives mirroring the complexities of his own. But for his mother, he would try.\n\nThat night, as the house settled into its nocturnal rhythms, Julian sat alone in the study, the typewriter's clack-clack a steady companion. He began with a village nestled in a valley, where sunlight kissed the rooftops and laughter echoed through the cobblestone streets. The protagonist, a young girl named Clara, was curious and kind-hearted, traits his mother had always valued. Clara's journey led her through enchanted forests and talking animals, each encounter a lesson in kindness and courage.\n\nDays turned into weeks. Julian's desk became a battlefield of crumpled pages and ink stains. His mother's visits were frequent, her critiques sharp but fair. \"Clara's too passive,\" she would say, or \"The dialogue needs more warmth.\" He absorbed her feedback, revising tirelessly, but the happy ending remained elusive.\n\nOne afternoon, as Julian sat staring at the latest draft, Margaret entered without knocking. She carried a small, worn book in her hands. \"I want to show you something,\" she said, placing the book in front of him. It was a collection of fairy tales, the cover faded from years of handling.\n\nJulian opened the book, the pages brittle under his fingers. He recognized the stories\u2014ones she had read to him as a child. \"Why are you showing me this?\"\n\nMargaret's eyes softened with nostalgia. \"These stories... they gave me hope when I needed it most. I want Clara's story to do the same for your niece.\"\n\nJulian closed the book gently. \"Hope isn't always easy to write.\"\n\nHis mother smiled, a rare tenderness in her expression. \"No, but it's necessary.\"\n\nThat night, Julian dreamed of his childhood, the nights spent wrapped in blankets, listening to his mother's voice as she read from the fairy tale book. He remembered the comfort of those stories, the way they had painted a world where problems could be solved and happiness was attainable.\n\nHe awoke with a sense of clarity. Returning to the typewriter, he rewrote Clara's journey, infusing it with the hope his mother had spoken of. Clara faced trials, but each one brought her closer to understanding her own strength. The forest, once dark and foreboding, became a place of discovery and friendship.\n\nAnd the ending\u2014Julian crafted it with care. Clara returned to her village, not just victorious but transformed. She had learned that happiness was not the absence of hardship but the presence of love and courage. The village celebrated her return, the air filled with music and laughter, and Clara knew she was home.\n\nJulian typed the final words, a sense of quiet satisfaction settling over him. He placed the manuscript in a folder and carried it to his mother's room. She was sitting by the window, knitting a blanket for the baby.\n\n\"Is it finished?\" she asked, looking up.\n\nHe nodded, handing her the folder. \"I hope you like it.\"\n\nMargaret took the manuscript and began to read. Julian watched her face, searching for any sign of approval or disappointment. When she finished, she closed the folder and looked at him, her eyes glistening.\n\n\"It's beautiful,\" she said softly. \"Clara's journey... it's everything I hoped it would be.\"\n\nJulian felt a swell of relief and pride. \"Thank you, Mother.\"\n\nShe reached out, squeezing his hand. \"You have a gift, Julian. Never forget that.\"\n\nAs he left her room, Julian felt a weight lift from his shoulders. The story he had crafted for his mother had become more than just a tale for a child; it was a bridge between them, a testament to the power of hope and the enduring bond of family.\n\nIn the quiet of his study, Julian sat down at the typewriter once more. He began to write a letter to his niece, the newest member of their family, sharing with her the story of Clara and the lessons she had learned. As he wrote, he realized that the happy ending his mother had demanded was not just for Clara, but for all of them.",
        "story_b": "In a cluttered room that bore a striking resemblance to the aftermath of a literary hurricane, sat a beleaguered writer named Jonathan. The space was a battlefield of ideas, where every crumpled page was a fallen soldier in the war for a perfect story. Stacks of children's books teetered precariously, and drafts lay scattered like autumn leaves, each one a testament to Jonathan\u2019s mounting frustration. The air was filled with the faint scent of ink and desperation.\n\nJonathan was engaged in the Herculean task of writing a children's story. But this was no ordinary tale, for it was to please his mother, whose critique was sharper than any editor's red pen. Her expectations loomed large, her voice echoing in Jonathan\u2019s mind as he typed: \u201cMake sure it has a happy ending, dear. Every good children's story needs one.\u201d\n\n\"Why does every fairy tale need a prince?\" Jonathan muttered to himself, his fingers hovering over the keyboard. \"Can't a frog just be a frog?\"\n\nHe glanced at the latest draft, a whimsical tale of a dragon who dreamed of becoming a concert pianist. It was a story that dared to defy convention, where scales and symphonies intertwined. Jonathan had poured his heart into it, only for his mother to suggest, with the sweetest of smiles, \"The dragon should be more environmentally conscious. Perhaps he can plant trees with his tail?\"\n\nJonathan sighed, the weight of her critique pressing down like a stack of rejection letters. Was a happy ending really just a formulaic conclusion, or was it the ultimate test of a writer's creativity? He pondered this as his computer screen flickered ominously. Every time he typed \"happily ever after,\" the cursed device crashed, as if mocking his attempts at narrative closure.\n\nUndeterred, Jonathan embarked on a series of absurd plot twists, each more outlandish than the last. He envisioned a pirate rabbit who, upon discovering the treasure, found it to be a trove of mismatched socks. Surely, this twist would elicit laughter. Yet, his mother\u2019s voice intruded again, \"But what about the moral lesson, Jonathan? Children need to learn something, don't they?\"\n\nIn a fit of irony, he scribbled, \u201cThe lesson is: never trust a sock to hold your dreams. They have too many holes.\u201d Then, realizing the absurdity, he tore the page, another fallen soldier.\n\nJonathan's character development was equally challenging. He imagined a courageous princess who swapped her crown for a skateboard, only to hear his mother's gentle suggestion, \"She should also learn knitting. It's a valuable skill, you know.\"\n\n\"Sure, Mom,\" Jonathan grumbled. \"Because every child dreams of knitting their way to glory.\"\n\nAs the drafts accumulated, so did his frustration. He could see the absurdity of his situation, his creativity ensnared in a web of well-intentioned maternal advice. He pictured himself as a knight, tilting at windmills of critique with nothing but a pen for a lance.\n\nIn a moment of introspection, Jonathan considered his relationship with happy endings. They seemed as elusive as a needle in a haystack made of rejection letters. He wondered if perhaps he was searching in the wrong place. Maybe a happy ending wasn't about tying up loose ends with a neat bow, but about embracing the chaos of the story itself.\n\nWith renewed determination, Jonathan returned to his keyboard. He crafted a tale of a mischievous cat who, after a series of misadventures, learned to dance on the moon. It was whimsical, delightful, and, most importantly, it felt right. He imagined the cat twirling among the stars, free from the constraints of expectation.\n\nHe hesitated before typing those three fateful words: \"happily ever after.\" As if sensing his trepidation, the computer remained steady, its hum a gentle encouragement. Jonathan exhaled, a sense of completion washing over him.\n\nWith the final draft in hand, Jonathan nervously approached his mother. Her eyes lit up as she read, her expression softening with each turn of the page. Jonathan braced himself for the inevitable critique, the list of \"improvements\" longer than the story itself.\n\nBut to his surprise, she smiled, a genuine warmth in her eyes. \"Jonathan, it's wonderful,\" she said, her voice tinged with pride. \"The cat dances on the moon. It's perfect.\"\n\nRelief flooded through him, a tide washing away doubt and frustration. For the first time, he realized that a happy ending wasn't about meeting expectations but about finding joy in the story he wanted to tell.\n\nAs he left his mother's house, Jonathan felt lighter, as if a weight had been lifted. He glanced up at the sky, imagining his moon-dancing cat, and whispered to himself, \"Maybe all stories have happy endings, if we let them.\"\n\nBack in his cluttered room, Jonathan surveyed the battlefield of ideas, the fallen soldiers of drafts and crumpled pages. They were no longer symbols of defeat but reminders of a creative journey that, despite its chaos, had led to something beautiful.\n\nHe cleared a space on his desk, setting down the final draft with a reverence usually reserved for treasure. With a smile, he turned to a fresh page, ready to embark on his next adventure, knowing that the pursuit of a happy ending was, in itself, the most satisfying story of all.",

        "ground_truth": "To please his mother, a writer attempts a children\u2019s story. The mother doesn\u2019t usually read fiction but will read a children\u2019s story and, if it\u2019s good, show it to all her friends. In his mother\u2019s eyes, the writer is, by and large, an anomaly. She believes that writing is a skill, not a vocation, and to make up stories for anyone other than children is a silly way to occupy one\u2019s time.\n\nSo here is his attempt at a story that maybe his mother will read and show her friends.\n\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a clown. The clown lived in a village that had no other clowns, for each village was allotted only one. The job of the clown was to scare some children but amuse others. He had balloons and face paint and could juggle. Half the time, he appeared without warning, and the other half he provided notice of the when, where, and what. Children had a fifty-fifty chance of receiving each option: the clown could either burst out from under their bed to juggle hatchets (no notice) or appear at their birthday party to juggle balls (notice given). If a child was amused once, there was no guarantee that this would happen again. Still, the chance of that child\u2019s being scared was no higher than it would have been, because, in this fair and made-up world, the clown existed to teach a lesson: that events of fear and events of joy are independent, and independent events must have independent probabilities.\n\nThe writer thinks this last sentence will please his mother. In her home country, she\u2019d taught math and begun work on a textbook, but then came instability, uprisings, and she and his father had had to leave. For a long time and openly, she\u2019d hoped that her son would carry on her work. \u201cMy son, the writer of textbooks\u201d is how she would have introduced him\u2014instead of simply \u201cmy son.\u201d\n\nThe mother now lives in a facility, and he visits her there.

        "story_b": "When his mother casually mentioned her wish for a story about a brave little squirrel, he felt the weight of her expectations settle on his shoulders. The request seemed innocuous enough, a sweet mother's wish for her son to write something whimsical and delightful. But for him, it was a task fraught with the potential for disappointment, his mother's critiques lingering in his mind like ink that refused to fade.\n\nHe sat at his kitchen table, cluttered with drafts and coffee cups, his sanctuary and his battlefield. The first draft came to life with a squirrel named Nutty, who had a penchant for getting into trouble. Nutty found himself lost in the dense, enchanted forest, where each leaf shimmered like emeralds and the air was thick with the scent of pine and mystery. The squirrel's quest was simple: find his way back home.\n\n\"Nutty stumbled upon a magical acorn,\" the writer typed, the words flowing with the ease of a childhood memory. \"This acorn granted wishes, a treasure whispered about in the rustling leaves.\"\n\nHe sent the draft to his mother, anticipating her warm approval. Her feedback arrived in the form of a phone call, her voice laced with love yet cutting through his story like a red pen. \"But where's the joy, dear? Nutty seems to face one dilemma after another. Shouldn't he find happiness?\"\n\nHis mother's well-meaning critique echoed in his mind as he returned to his desk. Her eyes, he imagined, twinkled with affection, even as her words drove him to frustration. He wondered if she saw the world in black and white, while he painted in shades of gray. Yet, his desire to please her was stronger than his creative pride.\n\nDetermined to find the elusive happy ending, he drafted again. This time, the forest was alive with fantastical creatures\u2014a talking mushroom named Mo, whose advice was sage and occasionally nonsensical. Mo suggested that Nutty should wish for a map to guide him home.\n\n\"But what if the journey is the point?\" Nutty asked, his little heart swelling with newfound courage.\n\n\"Ah, my furry friend,\" Mo mused, \"sometimes the journey is just the beginning.\"\n\nThe writer paused, considering Mo's wisdom. Was he, too, on a journey to understand his mother's perspective? Was the happy ending she desired not just for Nutty, but for him as well?\n\nHe sent this revised version to his mother, hopeful for her applause. Her response was swift and sharp. \"It's charming, darling, but Nutty's journey feels incomplete. Shouldn't he find a home, a place of belonging?\"\n\nHer words stung, yet they sparked a revelation. The story wasn't just about Nutty\u2014it was about him, his struggle to find a narrative that fit within his mother's vision while remaining true to his own voice.\n\nHe brewed another cup of coffee, his mind a whirlwind of ideas. Nutty's tale unfolded once more, the forest now a vibrant tapestry of color and magic. Nutty, guided by Mo, discovered a hidden grove where the trees whispered secrets and the sky blazed with twilight hues. It was here that Nutty realized the true magic was not in the acorn, but in the friendships he had forged and the courage he had gained.\n\n\"Nutty knew, as he nestled among the whispering leaves, that he had found his home,\" the writer penned, the words imbued with newfound understanding.\n\nHe sent the final draft to his mother, his heart light yet apprehensive. Her reply came in the form of a handwritten letter, its envelope decorated with little acorns. He opened it with trembling hands.\n\n\"My dear,\" the letter read, \"you've captured the joy I wished for Nutty and for you. The journey you wrote, both for your little squirrel and yourself, is a story I cherish.\"\n\nIn that moment, he realized the story's true ending lay not in Nutty's adventure, but in his own acceptance of imperfection and the delicate dance of meeting his mother's expectations while honoring his creative voice.\n\nHe found peace in the process, the journey of writing a tale that reflected both his world and hers. In crafting Nutty's story, he discovered his own\u2014a narrative woven with humor, sincerity, and the gentle push and pull of a mother's love.\n\nAnd as he sat at his kitchen table, surrounded by drafts and empty coffee cups, he knew he had found a home in his storytelling, a place where both he and his mother could find joy.",

        "ground_truth": "Pantheons Call was thoroughly routed. Emant Harrown, Lord Elect of the religious order, sat tall on his horse outside the gates of Yistria. Behind him were the remnants of the small army he had commanded in the city. Had he but known the declaration Jaharet would make, he would have mustered the entirety of Pantheons Call. But she had taken him by surprisehe and the rest of Danthes. She had exposed herself in that moment for the charlatan she was, an impure soul muddying the holy mantle of leadership she had been gifted. And he and his followers had reacted in the only way they couldthey had attempted to capture the Blasphemer and force her to Ascend. Theyd almost had her. But Jaharet too had followers, men and women devoted to her in a manner that was almost fanatical. Her Empyrean Guard and the sentinels of the Sanctum had joined together to protect her.Theyd bought her precious time so that she and those closest to her could flee to the Sanctum, the holiest of temples located deep in the heart of the city. And from within the Sanctum, some of her protectorsthose clerics and priests and mages that had sided with herhad come together to create a magical ward that no sword or magic at Harrowns disposal could breach. She was impervious now, safe in her cocoon of sorcery. But not for long. The small force Harrown commanded had surrounded the Sanctum. There they would have remained until the whole of Pantheons Call had come to aid them, if it had not been for the unforeseen. Jaharets alliances ran deep and spread far. Not even a day after her announcement was made, a large rebel faction from Morialor had marched into the city. Formidable though Harrown and his men were in battle, they were outnumbered greatly when this rebel group banded together with those loyal to the Empyrean. It was to her credit, Harrown mused now as he stared at the city denied to him, that Jaharet did not order he and his men slain. It was also going to be something she would come to regret most intensely. She had allowed them to fall back and regroup outside the gates. And then she had ordered that all city gates be closed and all its walls manned. The Lord Elect suddenly wheeled his horse around. The beast, a magnificent destrier, snorted as it turned on its haunches. Before him were the remnants of the men hed commanded in the city, all of them looking equally as grim as their leader, all of them sporting the emblem of the Five Eyes somewhere on their clothing, weapons, or shields. Have the men been sent? Harrown asked one of his commanders as he rode past. The commander heeled his horse forward so that it kept pace with the Lord Elects mount. They have, Lord. Harrown mused on this. When the magical aegis went up around the Sanctum, Harrown had known instinctively that breaching it would require some creative thinking. Hed sent word out of the city with swift messengers, instructing those in various outposts throughout the country to scry for certain individuals who were in possession of particular skills. These skills, when brought together and put to use in tandem, would ultimately be the way the ward would fall. And so men had been dispatched, armed and capable, to retrieve these individuals chosen. Harrown knew they would not all come willingly. No, some wouldl resist, which is why certain pressures had been applied to convince them that this task is in their best interests. Of course, some of them would be all too willing to lend their skills to this most righteous of crusades. As Harrown and his men rode away from Yistria, heading south, he carefully considered those that were chosen for this task the Vessanian clansmen that lived outside civilization, whose skills with a horse and bow would provide protection when violence inevitably happens the clever, impious merchant, whose connections and influence would be necessary to navigate through a nation turned hostile against those that would harm Jaharet the willful mage, a risky choice that was green in experience yet vast in untapped power, who would lend her skills to breaching the ward that protects the Empyrean Daughter and the messenger, whose knowledge of Danthes roads, paths, and secret ways would guide them all through a hostile landscape, whose lack of allegiances makes him perhaps the most trustworthy of the lot All of them would be escortedsome perhaps by forceto meet Lord Elect Harrown. And he would impart upon them the absolute necessity of what they must do. He would make certain they realize that they must not fail. Until then, however there were other matters he must attend to. And so it was that he and his men left the Holy City and its untrue ruler behind. *** In other parts of Danthes, paths were altered. Harrowns men sought them out unerringly, their locations revealed through the scrying of Pantheon Calls own priests and mages. One by one they were made to understand that they had no choice in this, that they must obey. And one by one they left their homes, their families, the things that mattered to them to set out on these new blind paths.",
        "story_a": "The moon hung high and cold above the crumbling keep, its pale light casting long, jagged shadows across the courtyard. The once-majestic fortress now lay in ruins, a ghost of its former glory, with ivy creeping up its walls and the scent of damp earth filling the air. It was here, beneath the ancient stone archway, that Lord Malric stood, his silhouette a dark and imposing figure against the night sky.\n\nHe gazed intently at the motley group assembled before him, each one an outcast in their own right, drawn together by necessity rather than choice. Malric's eyes glinted with a fervor that bordered on madness, a zeal that had driven him to this desperate hour.\n\n\"Behold,\" he intoned, his voice a gravelly echo that seemed to resonate through the stones themselves. \"You stand on the brink of destiny, chosen by fate to cleanse this land of the blasphemer who sits upon the throne.\"\n\nThe group exchanged wary glances, their expressions a mixture of skepticism and resignation. Each had their reasons for being here, though none truly believed in Malric's cause. Yet, the promise of freedom, gold, or revenge had been too tempting to resist.\n\nAt the forefront stood Elara, a lithe and agile thief with quicksilver eyes that darted nervously around the courtyard. Her deft fingers had lifted many a purse in the shadowed alleys of the city, but tonight they itched with uncertainty. She had agreed to join Malric's crusade in exchange for a clean slate, a chance to leave her life of crime behind. Yet, as she listened to his fervent speech, she couldn't shake the feeling that she had traded one set of chains for another.\n\nBeside her, Brogan shifted uneasily, his massive frame casting a formidable shadow. The blacksmith-turned-mercenary had once been a hero in his village, until a tragic accident had left him shunned and outcast. His thick arms, scarred from years of labor, bore the weight of his imposing warhammer, and his eyes held a sadness that spoke of battles lost both on and off the field. Malric had promised him redemption, a chance to reclaim his honor, but Brogan couldn't ignore the nagging doubt gnawing at his conscience.\n\nIn the back, partially hidden by the gloom, stood Seraphine, a healer whose talents had been both a blessing and a curse. Her ethereal beauty and delicate hands masked a fierce determination that had seen her through countless hardships. Branded a witch by those who feared her power, she had wandered the land in search of acceptance. Malric had approached her with promises of a new beginning, yet his fanaticism made her question the true cost of such a gift.\n\nFinally, there was Kade, a rogue mage with a sardonic smile and a past shrouded in mystery. His dark robes billowed around him like smoke, and his eyes gleamed with a dangerous intelligence. Kade had joined the group not out of loyalty or belief, but for the sheer thrill of the challenge. The magical ward that protected the ruler's stronghold was a puzzle he couldn't resist, and the potential to unlock its secrets was a temptation too great to ignore.\n\nMalric's voice broke through their thoughts, his eyes blazing with conviction. \"Together, we shall breach the ward and topple the tyrant who defiles our sacred land. Each of you brings a unique gift, a strength that will be vital to our success. Remember, our cause is just, and the gods themselves favor our quest.\"\n\nWith that, he turned and strode towards the keep's entrance, his cloak billowing behind him like a dark omen. The group followed, their footsteps echoing off the stone walls as they descended into the bowels of the fortress.\n\nThe air grew colder and more oppressive as they ventured deeper, the flickering torchlight casting eerie shadows on the damp walls. The silence was punctuated only by the distant drip of water and the occasional scuffle of unseen creatures. Each step seemed to draw them closer to an unknown fate, and the weight of their mission pressed heavily upon their shoulders.\n\nAs they reached the heart of the keep, they found themselves standing before a massive iron door, its surface etched with intricate runes that pulsed with a faint, otherworldly light. The magical ward, a barrier that had kept countless enemies at bay, now loomed before them as both a challenge and a promise.\n\nKade stepped forward, his eyes alight with curiosity and determination. He ran his fingers over the runes, muttering incantations under his breath as he sought to unravel the ward's secrets. The others watched in tense silence, their fates hanging in the balance.\n\nMinutes stretched into hours as Kade worked, his brow furrowed in concentration. Sweat dripped from his forehead, mingling with the dust and grime that clung to his robes. Finally, with a triumphant shout, he stepped back, the runes flickering and then fading into darkness.\n\n\"The ward is broken,\" he declared, his voice tinged with both relief and exhilaration. \"The path is clear.\"\n\nLord Malric's eyes gleamed with a fanatical light as he stepped forward, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword. \"Onward, then,\" he commanded. \"We shall cleanse this land of its corruption and restore its rightful order.\"\n\nAs they pushed open the iron door and stepped into the unknown, each member of the group couldn't help but feel a sense of foreboding. The journey ahead would test not only their skills but their very souls. And as the line between righteousness and tyranny began to blur, they would soon discover that the true battle lay not against the blasphemer, but within themselves.",
        "story_b": "The fortress of Lord Edris stood like a monolith against the evening sky, its towering spires clawing at the heavens. It was a bastion of stone and steel, a testament to the lord's relentless ambition and unyielding faith. Within its walls, a magical ward encircled the keep\u2014a shimmering barrier of translucent energy that pulsed with ancient power. It hummed with the whispers of forgotten incantations, etched into its surface in a lattice of intricate runes that shimmered in the waning light. This was the domain of Lord Edris, a realm where zealotry and vision coalesced into a singular purpose.\n\nIn the heart of this stronghold, the council chamber was a place of grandeur and authority. Opulent tapestries adorned the walls, depicting conquests long past. A grand table, carved from a single piece of enchanted wood, dominated the room, its surface polished to a mirror-like sheen. Around it gathered a motley crew of outcasts, each drawn here by promises of redemption, vengeance, or perhaps something less definable.\n\nLord Edris rose from his seat, his voice a clarion call, filled with fervor and conviction. \u201cThe time has come to rid this world of the blasphemous ruler who defiles our sacred lands. The magical ward is our final obstacle; its breach will herald a new era.\u201d\n\nYet, even as he spoke, a tremor shook the chamber, a disturbance in the ward's energy that sent ripples through the barrier. It was a sign, an omen of instability that could no longer be ignored. Urgency gripped the air, and the outcasts exchanged wary glances. Their mission, once a distant promise, now demanded immediate action.\n\nAmong them was Lirael, a rogue with nimble fingers and a sharper wit. She stood apart, her eyes flitting from face to face, gauging the resolve of her newfound companions. Beside her, Torin, a stoic warrior, checked the edge of his blade with methodical precision. His silence spoke volumes of his determination, yet his eyes betrayed a flicker of doubt.\n\nElara, a mage with a penchant for strategic insight, studied the ward's fluctuating energy patterns. Her fingers traced invisible lines in the air, reading the currents with a precision that bordered on the scientific. \u201cThe ward's instability is both a boon and a curse,\u201d she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. \u201cIt offers us a chance, but also a danger.\u201d\n\nTheir journey began under the cover of night, the forest a labyrinth of shadows and secrets. The path was fraught with hidden perils, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and the rustle of unseen creatures. Each step brought them closer to their goal, yet also deeper into the heart of uncertainty.\n\nAs they traveled, the outcasts found themselves grappling with the complexity of their mission. Lord Edris's vision, once a beacon of righteousness, began to reveal its darker facets. His rhetoric, so compelling in the safety of the council chamber, now seemed tinged with fanaticism.\n\nLirael, ever questioning, broached the topic as they paused to rest. \u201cWhat if we\u2019re just trading one tyrant for another?\u201d Her words hung in the air, heavy with implication.\n\nTorin, though usually reticent, nodded in agreement. \u201cPower corrupts. We must be wary of becoming the very thing we seek to destroy.\u201d\n\nElara\u2019s gaze was distant, her thoughts a swirl of conflicting loyalties. She had seen firsthand the devastation wrought by unchecked power, yet she also understood the necessity of their mission. \u201cThe line between righteousness and tyranny is thin indeed,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut we must trust in our purpose and hold fast to our own convictions.\u201d\n\nTheir resolve was tested as they neared the ward, its energy a palpable force that set the air to crackling. The runes glowed fiercely, and the outcasts braced themselves for the task ahead. Elara stepped forward, her hands weaving a complex spell designed to unravel the ward\u2019s defenses. Lirael and Torin stood ready, each poised to act at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nThe breach, when it came, was a moment of both triumph and trepidation. The ward shimmered, its energy fracturing into a kaleidoscope of colors before collapsing inward. The path lay open before them, yet uncertainty loomed large.\n\nAt the threshold of the ruler\u2019s domain, the outcasts paused. The air was charged with potential, a crossroads of destiny. They stood united, yet each was acutely aware of the personal stakes involved. Their journey had revealed much about the nature of power and the perilous balance between right and wrong.\n\nAs they prepared to confront the ruler, the outcasts knew that their mission was far from over. The true test lay ahead, in the choices they would make and the principles they would uphold. The path of righteousness was fraught with peril, but it was theirs to navigate.\n\nIn the stillness of that moment, the echoes of the past and the promise of the future converged. The outcasts breathed as one, stepping into the unknown with hearts steeled against the uncertainty that lay ahead. The story of their journey was yet unwritten, its outcome as elusive as the shimmering remnants of the ward they had breached.",

        "story_b": "The dimly lit chamber echoed with a nervous energy as the outcasts gathered, their eyes shifting warily between one another and the imposing figure at the center. Lord Elian, his presence as commanding as the crimson cloak he wore, stood before them with a fervor that bordered on the maniacal. His voice boomed through the cavernous hall, weaving tales of betrayal and sacrilege committed by the ruler they were to dethrone. \n\n\u201cThe time has come,\u201d Elian proclaimed, his eyes blazing with conviction. \u201cThe blasphemer\u2019s reign must end, and you\u2014each chosen for your unparalleled talents\u2014are the instruments of justice.\u201d\n\nYet, the outcasts shifted uncomfortably, their skepticism palpable. They were a motley assembly\u2014an elven mage with secrets more ancient than the stones beneath them, a rogue skilled in the shadows, a healer with a haunted past, and a warrior whose scars told stories of battles lost and won. Each bore their own burdens, their own reasons for joining this perilous quest, though few could match Elian\u2019s fanaticism.\n\nThe journey began with the lord\u2019s promises still ringing in their ears, but as they traveled through lands scarred by conflict, doubt crept in like a silent specter. The magical ward that guarded the ruler\u2019s domain was a thing of legend, its shimmering surface a veil of liquid starlight, whispering secrets of forgotten realms. It loomed ahead, a barrier both beautiful and forbidding.\n\nAs they approached, the ward seemed to pulse with a life of its own, testing their resolve. The mage, Rhiannon, stepped forward, her fingers dancing in intricate patterns as she murmured incantations. The ward responded, its surface rippling like disturbed water, reflecting their innermost fears. It was a sentient barrier, one that demanded not just magical skill but a confrontation with their own truths.\n\nThe rogue, Kael, was the first to falter, his reflection showing a life of betrayal and mistrust. \u201cThis isn\u2019t right,\u201d he muttered, stepping back. But Elian\u2019s voice cut through the hesitation like a blade. \u201cWe are on the side of righteousness, Kael. Do not waver now.\u201d\n\nYet as the ward\u2019s challenges persisted, the group\u2019s unity began to fracture. Each outcast faced visions that tested their loyalty not just to the mission, but to each other. The healer, Mira, saw echoes of the lives she failed to save, the warrior, Bran, relived the horrors of past battles. Their faith in the lord\u2019s mission wavered, the certainty of their path clouded by doubt.\n\nAmidst these trials, Elian\u2019s true nature began to surface. His obsession with overthrowing the ruler seemed less about justice and more about personal vendetta. The outcasts whispered among themselves, questioning whether they were merely pawns in a game of power and revenge. The lord\u2019s charisma, once a beacon of purpose, now felt like the chains binding them to a quest that was not their own.\n\nDespite the growing unease, they pressed on, driven by a mixture of fear and the hope that perhaps, beyond the ward, they would find the truth. The final confrontation came in the shadow of the ruler\u2019s fortress, where the outcasts stood poised to fulfill their mission. But as they prepared to breach the gates, a moment of clarity struck them\u2014a realization that their actions mirrored the very tyranny they sought to overthrow.\n\nElian\u2019s eyes gleamed with the madness of ambition. \u201cThis is our moment!\u201d he shouted, urging them forward. Yet, it was Rhiannon who spoke, her voice soft yet resolute. \u201cWhat if the tyrant is not the one we seek to dethrone, but the one who leads us?\u201d\n\nHer words hung in the air, a challenge that forced each outcast to confront the duality of their mission. The mirrors of the ward had shown them their fears and failures, but also the potential for redemption and choice. In that moment, they understood that the line between righteousness and tyranny was not as clear as the lord\u2019s impassioned speeches had made it seem.\n\nIn the end, they turned not against the ruler, but against the fanaticism that had driven them to this brink. The ambiguity of their resolution left questions unanswered, a testament to the complexity of their journey. As they walked away from the fortress, the echoes of their actions lingered\u2014a reminder that in the battle between light and shadow, it is not always clear where one ends and the other begins.\n\nThe outcasts dispersed, each returning to their own paths, forever changed by the choices they had made.

        "ground_truth": "Pantheons Call was thoroughly routed. Emant Harrown, Lord Elect of the religious order, sat tall on his horse outside the gates of Yistria. Behind him were the remnants of the small army he had commanded in the city. Had he but known the declaration Jaharet would make, he would have mustered the entirety of Pantheons Call. But she had taken him by surprisehe and the rest of Danthes. She had exposed herself in that moment for the charlatan she was, an impure soul muddying the holy mantle of leadership she had been gifted. And he and his followers had reacted in the only way they couldthey had attempted to capture the Blasphemer and force her to Ascend. Theyd almost had her. But Jaharet too had followers, men and women devoted to her in a manner that was almost fanatical. Her Empyrean Guard and the sentinels of the Sanctum had joined together to protect her.Theyd bought her precious time so that she and those closest to her could flee to the Sanctum, the holiest of temples located deep in the heart of the city. And from within the Sanctum, some of her protectorsthose clerics and priests and mages that had sided with herhad come together to create a magical ward that no sword or magic at Harrowns disposal could breach. She was impervious now, safe in her cocoon of sorcery. But not for long. The small force Harrown commanded had surrounded the Sanctum. There they would have remained until the whole of Pantheons Call had come to aid them, if it had not been for the unforeseen. Jaharets alliances ran deep and spread far. Not even a day after her announcement was made, a large rebel faction from Morialor had marched into the city. Formidable though Harrown and his men were in battle, they were outnumbered greatly when this rebel group banded together with those loyal to the Empyrean. It was to her credit, Harrown mused now as he stared at the city denied to him, that Jaharet did not order he and his men slain. It was also going to be something she would come to regret most intensely. She had allowed them to fall back and regroup outside the gates. And then she had ordered that all city gates be closed and all its walls manned. The Lord Elect suddenly wheeled his horse around. The beast, a magnificent destrier, snorted as it turned on its haunches. Before him were the remnants of the men hed commanded in the city, all of them looking equally as grim as their leader, all of them sporting the emblem of the Five Eyes somewhere on their clothing, weapons, or shields. Have the men been sent? Harrown asked one of his commanders as he rode past. The commander heeled his horse forward so that it kept pace with the Lord Elects mount. They have, Lord. Harrown mused on this. When the magical aegis went up around the Sanctum, Harrown had known instinctively that breaching it would require some creative thinking. Hed sent word out of the city with swift messengers, instructing those in various outposts throughout the country to scry for certain individuals who were in possession of particular skills. These skills, when brought together and put to use in tandem, would ultimately be the way the ward would fall. And so men had been dispatched, armed and capable, to retrieve these individuals chosen. Harrown knew they would not all come willingly. No, some wouldl resist, which is why certain pressures had been applied to convince them that this task is in their best interests. Of course, some of them would be all too willing to lend their skills to this most righteous of crusades. As Harrown and his men rode away from Yistria, heading south, he carefully considered those that were chosen for this task the Vessanian clansmen that lived outside civilization, whose skills with a horse and bow would provide protection when violence inevitably happens the clever, impious merchant, whose connections and influence would be necessary to navigate through a nation turned hostile against those that would harm Jaharet the willful mage, a risky choice that was green in experience yet vast in untapped power, who would lend her skills to breaching the ward that protects the Empyrean Daughter and the messenger, whose knowledge of Danthes roads, paths, and secret ways would guide them all through a hostile landscape, whose lack of allegiances makes him perhaps the most trustworthy of the lot All of them would be escortedsome perhaps by forceto meet Lord Elect Harrown. And he would impart upon them the absolute necessity of what they must do. He would make certain they realize that they must not fail. Until then, however there were other matters he must attend to. And so it was that he and his men left the Holy City and its untrue ruler behind. *** In other parts of Danthes, paths were altered. Harrowns men sought them out unerringly, their locations revealed through the scrying of Pantheon Calls own priests and mages. One by one they were made to understand that they had no choice in this, that they must obey. And one by one they left their homes, their families, the things that mattered to them to set out on these new blind paths.",
        "story_a": "The moon hung high and cold above the crumbling keep, its pale light casting long, jagged shadows across the courtyard. The once-majestic fortress now lay in ruins, a ghost of its former glory, with ivy creeping up its walls and the scent of damp earth filling the air. It was here, beneath the ancient stone archway, that Lord Malric stood, his silhouette a dark and imposing figure against the night sky.\n\nHe gazed intently at the motley group assembled before him, each one an outcast in their own right, drawn together by necessity rather than choice. Malric's eyes glinted with a fervor that bordered on madness, a zeal that had driven him to this desperate hour.\n\n\"Behold,\" he intoned, his voice a gravelly echo that seemed to resonate through the stones themselves. \"You stand on the brink of destiny, chosen by fate to cleanse this land of the blasphemer who sits upon the throne.\"\n\nThe group exchanged wary glances, their expressions a mixture of skepticism and resignation. Each had their reasons for being here, though none truly believed in Malric's cause. Yet, the promise of freedom, gold, or revenge had been too tempting to resist.\n\nAt the forefront stood Elara, a lithe and agile thief with quicksilver eyes that darted nervously around the courtyard. Her deft fingers had lifted many a purse in the shadowed alleys of the city, but tonight they itched with uncertainty. She had agreed to join Malric's crusade in exchange for a clean slate, a chance to leave her life of crime behind. Yet, as she listened to his fervent speech, she couldn't shake the feeling that she had traded one set of chains for another.\n\nBeside her, Brogan shifted uneasily, his massive frame casting a formidable shadow. The blacksmith-turned-mercenary had once been a hero in his village, until a tragic accident had left him shunned and outcast. His thick arms, scarred from years of labor, bore the weight of his imposing warhammer, and his eyes held a sadness that spoke of battles lost both on and off the field. Malric had promised him redemption, a chance to reclaim his honor, but Brogan couldn't ignore the nagging doubt gnawing at his conscience.\n\nIn the back, partially hidden by the gloom, stood Seraphine, a healer whose talents had been both a blessing and a curse. Her ethereal beauty and delicate hands masked a fierce determination that had seen her through countless hardships. Branded a witch by those who feared her power, she had wandered the land in search of acceptance. Malric had approached her with promises of a new beginning, yet his fanaticism made her question the true cost of such a gift.\n\nFinally, there was Kade, a rogue mage with a sardonic smile and a past shrouded in mystery. His dark robes billowed around him like smoke, and his eyes gleamed with a dangerous intelligence. Kade had joined the group not out of loyalty or belief, but for the sheer thrill of the challenge. The magical ward that protected the ruler's stronghold was a puzzle he couldn't resist, and the potential to unlock its secrets was a temptation too great to ignore.\n\nMalric's voice broke through their thoughts, his eyes blazing with conviction. \"Together, we shall breach the ward and topple the tyrant who defiles our sacred land. Each of you brings a unique gift, a strength that will be vital to our success. Remember, our cause is just, and the gods themselves favor our quest.\"\n\nWith that, he turned and strode towards the keep's entrance, his cloak billowing behind him like a dark omen. The group followed, their footsteps echoing off the stone walls as they descended into the bowels of the fortress.\n\nThe air grew colder and more oppressive as they ventured deeper, the flickering torchlight casting eerie shadows on the damp walls. The silence was punctuated only by the distant drip of water and the occasional scuffle of unseen creatures. Each step seemed to draw them closer to an unknown fate, and the weight of their mission pressed heavily upon their shoulders.\n\nAs they reached the heart of the keep, they found themselves standing before a massive iron door, its surface etched with intricate runes that pulsed with a faint, otherworldly light. The magical ward, a barrier that had kept countless enemies at bay, now loomed before them as both a challenge and a promise.\n\nKade stepped forward, his eyes alight with curiosity and determination. He ran his fingers over the runes, muttering incantations under his breath as he sought to unravel the ward's secrets. The others watched in tense silence, their fates hanging in the balance.\n\nMinutes stretched into hours as Kade worked, his brow furrowed in concentration. Sweat dripped from his forehead, mingling with the dust and grime that clung to his robes. Finally, with a triumphant shout, he stepped back, the runes flickering and then fading into darkness.\n\n\"The ward is broken,\" he declared, his voice tinged with both relief and exhilaration. \"The path is clear.\"\n\nLord Malric's eyes gleamed with a fanatical light as he stepped forward, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword. \"Onward, then,\" he commanded. \"We shall cleanse this land of its corruption and restore its rightful order.\"\n\nAs they pushed open the iron door and stepped into the unknown, each member of the group couldn't help but feel a sense of foreboding. The journey ahead would test not only their skills but their very souls. And as the line between righteousness and tyranny began to blur, they would soon discover that the true battle lay not against the blasphemer, but within themselves.",
        "story_b": "The path twisted through the forest like a serpent, each curve revealing new shadows that clawed at the sky with bony fingers. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth, mingling with an undercurrent of magic that made the hairs on their arms stand on end. The outcasts moved in a loose formation, each step bringing them closer to the shimmering barrier of light ahead\u2014a magical ward, pulsing with an ominous hum, its surface rippling like disturbed water.\n\nThe lord, a gaunt figure with eyes that blazed with fervor, led the group. His voice, sharp and commanding, cut through the stillness. \"Remember, the ward is no mere obstacle. It is an ancient sentinel, its magic woven with the whispers of forgotten spells. It watches us with an unblinking eye.\"\n\nBeside him, a warrior with a scarred face and stoic demeanor grunted in response, his hand resting on the hilt of a well-worn sword. \"And here I thought we were just taking a stroll,\" he muttered, his voice laced with dry humor that did little to mask his unease.\n\nTrailing slightly behind, a thief with nimble fingers and a quicksilver grin regarded the ward with a glint of professional interest. \"Just another lock to pick,\" he said, though his eyes betrayed a flicker of doubt. \"Albeit one with a mind of its own.\"\n\nThe mage, a woman with eyes that seemed to hold the stars themselves, studied the ward with cautious curiosity. Her fingers traced patterns in the air, sensing the arcane energy that crackled around them like a lattice of light and shadow. \"It's alive,\" she murmured, half to herself. \"Like a dragon of legend, its secrets coiled tight within.\"\n\nTheir journey had not been an easy one. The path had been fraught with dangers, both seen and unseen. Yet it was the social dynamics among them that proved the most treacherous. Each outcast bore their own scars\u2014some visible, some etched into the soul. Trust was a currency they could ill afford, yet one they found themselves spending more with each passing day.\n\nAs they neared the ward, the lord turned to address them, his voice a clarion call in the oppressive silence. \"The ruler we seek to overthrow is a blasphemer, a defiler of sacred truths. We are the instruments of divine justice, the harbingers of a new order.\"\n\nThe mage's eyes narrowed, her skepticism plain. \"And if this new order mirrors the old? If tyranny merely changes its face?\"\n\nThe lord's gaze hardened, his fanaticism a palpable force. \"Doubt is a luxury we cannot indulge. The righteousness of our cause is unquestionable.\"\n\nThe tension between them was a living thing, a silent testament to the fragile alliance they had formed. Each had their reasons for embarking on this perilous mission\u2014reasons that were as varied as they were personal. For the warrior, it was a chance at redemption, a way to atone for past sins. The thief sought freedom, a clean slate unburdened by the weight of his crimes. The mage yearned for knowledge, the forbidden kind that danced just out of reach.\n\nAs they stood before the ward, its surface crackling with arcane energy, the line between righteousness and tyranny seemed to blur like a mirage on a summer's day. The lord's conviction was a beacon, but it cast long shadows that stretched into the unknown.\n\nThe forest around them was silent, save for the rustle of leaves underfoot. The air was electric, charged with anticipation. The lord stepped forward, raising a hand to the ward. \"This is it,\" he declared, his voice resonating with unshakable belief. \"The moment we fulfill our destiny.\"\n\nThe mage exchanged a glance with the warrior, her expression a mixture of resolve and trepidation. \"Let's hope destiny knows what it's doing,\" she quipped, her tone light but her meaning heavy.\n\nThe thief chuckled, a sound that held more nerves than mirth. \"This whole mission's a bloody mess, but what else is new?\"\n\nWith a collective breath, they moved as one, each bringing their unique skills to bear against the ward. The warrior's blade sang as it cut through the air, the thief's hands danced over the ward's surface, and the mage's incantations wove through the ether like threads of starlight.\n\nThe ward resisted, its defenses formidable and relentless. Yet the outcasts pressed on, driven by the disparate hopes that bound them together. Slowly, inexorably, the ward began to yield, its light flickering like a candle in the wind.\n\nAs the barrier finally shattered, a cascade of energy washed over them, leaving them breathless and exhilarated. Beyond lay the ruler's domain\u2014a fortress of black stone, its towers piercing the sky like daggers, surrounded by a moat of swirling mist.\n\nThe lord's eyes gleamed with triumph, but the outcasts found their victory tinged with uncertainty. The path ahead was uncharted, fraught with peril and possibility. Together, they stepped into the unknown, their hearts a curious mix of hope and dread.\n\nIn that moment, they understood that the journey was far from over. The true battle lay within, where the line between righteousness and tyranny was not a boundary but a threshold\u2014one they must each cross in their own way.",

Admission is Free for All!**\n\nCarl hammered the sign down on the cracking concrete in front of the rusted, disused warehouse and stared at his partner Ralph. \"Bro, you sure this is going to lure in that pesky detective who keeps foiling Boss Bernando's plans?\"\n\n\"Carl, you dumbass!\" Ralph slapped him on the back of his head with a goat plush toy. \"Didn't boss make it clear? We're kidnapping the loved one of Detective Watson as bait. She wouldn't fall for such an elementary trick. But her dorky boyfriend will.\"\n\n\"Right, right. So, what do we know about Katrina Watson's boyfriend?\"\n\n\"He's obsessed with tea and cakes, and goats,\" Ralph read his briefing notes. \"We're serving chamomile tea, strawberry cheesecakes and he can go pet some goats at the back of this warehouse.\"\n\n\"What does he look like?\"\n\n\"Some goth LARPer who dresses like a necromancer in black robes. Pale, white-haired guy.\"\n\n\"That one?\" Carl pointed to the strange man sauntering towards them on...tentacles? Those have got to be some fake animatronic, right?\n\nRalph nodded, \"That one.\"\n\n\"Greetings humans!\" Their target waved at them with a cheery grin. \"Ah, the Tinseltown's Tea Party! Boy, am I glad to have free flow of tea and cakes! Where do I register?\"\n\n\"The guestbook's right here,\" Ralph presented to him the book he purchased from Poppa's Art and Craft shop just twenty minutes ago. \"Sign here.\"\n\n*Lord Elvari was here! :D*\n\n*Who doesn't love tea parties! :P*\n\n\"There! I've signed it. Let's get down to the party, shall we?\" He rubbed his hands, and those oddly realistic tentacles together. \"You can't have free lunches all the time, but I'm sure am glad free tea parties exist!\"\n\nCarl kept his head down and his mouth shut while Ralph led their gullible and eager target inside. The cheap plastic utensils, scrappy tablecloth they bought off a second-hand goods store, and the paltry Christmas decorations they salvaged from an impoverished orphanage, would that dork really buy it? About the only thing that costed more than pocket change was the exquisite porcelain teapot and silver serving platter for the cake. That's the most important things, Ralph said. The things that their target would focus on. And the tea, of course.\n\n\"You sure do have many armed guards for a simple tea party,\" Elvari scanned the sparsely decorated warehouse and pointed towards the gang members standing by armed and ready.\n\n\"Yea, we want to ensure our VIP party guest is secure in our premises,\" Ralph said. \"That'll be you, our honored guest.\"\n\n\"Why, thank you. How very considerate of you.\"\n\n\"Only the best for our guest,\" Ralph forced a smile on his face and gestured his kidnapping target towards the sole table and chair in the area. \"Would you like to take a seat and enjoy what we have to offer?\"\n\nThe weirdo in black robes plopped himself down on the chair and poured himself some tea. No sooner than he aimed his fork towards the cheesecake, the warehouse door slammed open.\n\n\"Freeze!\" Detective Katrina Watson shouted as she aimed her gun towards Ralph. \"You're under arrest for kidnapping...Elvari?\"\n\n\"Kidnapping?\" He sounded displeased. \"I was told this was a tea party!\"\n\n\"It's a kidnapping,\" Carl pressed the muzzle of his gun against Elvari's head. \"Detective, take a step closer and I'll blow his brains out.\"\n\n\"Which brain?\" Elvari asked in the puzzled tone. \"I have nine of these squiggly organs you call brains.\"\n\n\"Oh god Elvari, this is not the time for jokes!\" Kat bemoaned. \"Not when you're the target of a kidnapping attempt.\"\n\n\"But I do actually have nine brains in total...\" he pouted and tented his tentacles. \"I know...they've been accused of sharing one same braincell at times, but they're still nine separate brains.\"\n\n\"Boys, I'd advise you put your guns down,\" Kat spoke to the armed gangsters surrounding them. \"You have picked literally the worst target to kidnap to impede my investigations. Not because he's a big dork who thinks there could be a real tea party in an abandoned warehouse. Because he's an actual eldritch deity who could shatter your minds and have you pissing in your diapers in a psychiatric ward for life.\"\n\nThe men backed away with their guns down. A few ran out the door and never looked back. Ralph kept his gun on Kat, while Carl \u2014\n\n*Bang!*\n\nBlood trickled down from the side of Elvari's head. He sat still, eyes wide open, before blinking.\n\n\"That wasn't very nice of you,\" he frowned while his tentacles hissed angrily. \"I was suspicious of the abandoned warehouse setup, but the tea was just too good, so I thought I should be a gracious guest and play along. But playtime's over.\"\n\nA tentacle coiled around Carl's hand to twist it until audible cracking sounds echoed across the room, alongside the gangster's screams. His gun fell to the floor, as did his knees crashed down onto the concrete. Ralph let out gurgling noises when a tentacle throttled his throat. Both unable to protest while tentacles slapped them repeatedly in their faces. Elvari continued to sip his tea and stuffed his face with cake like it was a pleasant afternoon at his favourite cafe and totally not punishing two gangsters for a failed kidnapping attempt at an old warehouse.\n\n\"Elvari? You can stop now,\" Kat squeezed his shoulder. \"I've notified Officer Jenkins to come by and make an arrest, so please leave those two to be recognizable by other scam victims at a line-up, okay?",
        "story_a": "I should've known something was off the moment I stepped into the neighborhood. The air was thick with the scent of blooming roses and freshly cut grass, an odd juxtaposition to the task at hand. My target was a high-profile scientist who had crossed the wrong people, and my mission was to kidnap his loved one as leverage. Simple, right? Except, nothing about this felt simple.\n\nI approached the house, a quaint two-story with ivy creeping up the brick exterior. The intel said she\u2019d be alone\u2014his wife, a schoolteacher with a penchant for gardening. Easy pickings. I jimmied the lock on the back door, the click of the mechanism echoing in the silent kitchen. My heart pounded in my chest, but I dismissed it as the usual pre-job jitters.\n\nThe kitchen was immaculate, almost sterile in its cleanliness. A bowl of apples sat on the counter, and I noticed the faint aroma of freshly baked bread lingering in the air. It was the kind of place that screamed \"normalcy,\" but there was something else, an underlying tension that set my instincts on edge.\n\nI crept through the house, careful to avoid the creaky floorboards. The living room was tastefully decorated, with family photos lining the walls. There she was, sitting on a plush armchair, reading a book. Her long, auburn hair cascaded over her shoulders, and she looked up, locking eyes with me.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" she asked, her voice calm and measured. No hint of fear, no surprise. Just... calm.\n\n\"Mrs. Thompson,\" I said, trying to sound authoritative. \"I need you to come with me.\"\n\nShe closed her book and placed it on the side table, standing up with an elegance that seemed almost rehearsed. \"Is that so?\" she replied, a small smile playing on her lips. \"And what if I say no?\"\n\nI pulled out my gun, leveling it at her. \"Then things get messy.\"\n\nHer smile widened, and for the first time, I felt a chill run down my spine. \"You really should have done your homework,\" she said, and before I could react, she moved.\n\nOne moment she was standing there, and the next, she was a blur of motion. My gun was knocked from my hand, and I found myself on the floor, gasping for breath. Her knee was pressed against my chest, and her eyes bore into mine with an intensity that made my blood run cold.\n\n\"Who sent you?\" she demanded, her voice now a dangerous whisper.\n\nI struggled to breathe, my mind racing. This wasn't supposed to happen. She was supposed to be easy, a means to an end. But now, with her hand gripping my throat, I realized I was the one in over my head.\n\n\"Talk!\" she snapped, tightening her grip.\n\n\"V-Veritas,\" I choked out, the word barely escaping my lips. \"They want your husband.\"\n\nHer eyes narrowed, and she released her hold, allowing me to gasp for air. \"Of course they do,\" she muttered, almost to herself. \"Fools.\"\n\nShe stood up, giving me a chance to scramble to my feet. I rubbed my throat, my mind racing with thoughts of escape, but something about her presence kept me rooted to the spot.\n\n\"What's your name?\" she asked, her tone softer now, almost gentle.\n\n\"Marcus,\" I replied, still wary.\n\n\"Well, Marcus,\" she said, picking up the book she had been reading. \"It seems you've found yourself in quite the predicament. You see, Veritas didn't just send you to kidnap a schoolteacher. They sent you to kidnap me\u2014an operative they thought was long retired.\"\n\nHer words hung in the air, and my mind struggled to process the implications. She was one of them? A former operative? No wonder she had taken me down so easily.\n\n\"They didn't tell you, did they?\" she continued, shaking her head. \"Typical. They always underestimate the people they cast aside.\"\n\nI took a step back, my instincts screaming at me to run, but she held up a hand. \"Wait. I'm not going to hurt you.\"\n\n\"Why should I believe you?\" I asked, my voice trembling.\n\n\"Because you and I, we're pawns in a game much larger than ourselves,\" she said, her eyes softening. \"And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that pawns can change the course of the game.\"\n\nShe walked over to the window, peering out into the night. \"You have a choice, Marcus. You can leave now, go back to Veritas, and tell them you failed. Or,\" she turned to face me, \"you can help me take them down.\"\n\nI hesitated, the weight of her words settling over me. She was offering me a chance to flip the script, to turn the tables on those who had sent me here. It was dangerous, reckless even, but something in her eyes told me she was serious.\n\n\"What do you need me to do?\" I asked, the decision made.\n\nHer smile returned, this time warm and genuine. \"First, we're going to pay my husband a visit. He's been working on something that might just give us the upper hand.\"\n\nAs we left the house together, I couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation. The game was changing, and for the first time, I wasn't just a pawn. I was a player.",

Desperation breeds creativity, or so he told himself. The address led him to an old mansion, the kind that seemed to breathe its own history. Every corner of the place whispered secrets.\n\n\u201cAlright, let's get this over with,\u201d Derek muttered, adjusting the mask on his face. \u201cThis can't be any harder than that time in Madrid.\u201d\n\nHe slipped in through an unlocked window\u2014an open invitation, really. The mansion was eerily quiet, save for the occasional creak of wood. As he moved through the dimly lit corridors, he couldn't shake the feeling of being watched.\n\nDerek found her in a room at the far end of the hallway. She was seated in a large, ornate chair, seemingly engrossed in a book. She looked up, eyes like deep pools of midnight. Young, no older than twenty, with a frail appearance that belied the danger he was warned about.\n\n\u201cShe can't be that dangerous,\u201d Derek thought, a smirk tugging at his lips. \u201cShe looks like she couldn't hurt a fly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHello there,\u201d he said, attempting to sound intimidating. \u201cYou're coming with me.\u201d\n\nShe closed her book gently, placing it on a small table beside her. \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d Her voice was soft, almost musical, but it carried an undertone that made Derek's skin crawl.\n\n\u201cYeah, you're coming with me to make your boyfriend talk,\u201d Derek said, pulling out a pair of handcuffs. \u201cNow, let's make this easy.\u201d\n\nHer laugh was light, almost innocent. \u201cBoyfriend? Is that what you think?\u201d She stood up, and Derek was taken aback by how gracefully she moved. \u201cI think you might be mistaken about a few things.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust\u2014just turn around,\u201d Derek stammered, waving the handcuffs. \u201cNo funny business.\u201d\n\nThe next moment happened in a blur. One second she was standing there, the next, Derek was flying across the room, crashing into an antique cabinet. The air crackled with an energy that made his hair stand on end.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Derek groaned, struggling to his feet. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d\n\nShe walked over to him, her steps soundless on the wooden floor. \u201cYou poor thing. You have no idea what you\u2019ve walked into, do you?\u201d She extended a hand, and Derek felt an invisible force lifting him off the ground.\n\n\u201cLet me go!\u201d Derek shouted, writhing in mid-air.\n\n\u201cYou should have done your homework,\u201d she said, her eyes glowing with an eerie light. Shadows around the room seemed to dance and twist, moving to some unseen rhythm. \u201cI\u2019m not some damsel in distress. I\u2019m the one they tell stories about to keep you up at night.\u201d\n\nDerek\u2019s mind raced.

I just wanted the money.\u201d\n\nShe seemed to consider this for a moment. \u201cMoney, is it? And what will you do with that money?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out,\u201d Derek said quickly. \u201cStart over. Leave this life behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cInteresting.\u201d She released her hold, and Derek dropped to the floor with a thud. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first to come after me, you know. But you might be the first with a shred of honesty.\u201d\n\nDerek rubbed his sore limbs, trying to process what was happening. \u201cSo\u2026 what now?\u201d\n\nShe smiled, a disconcerting blend of warmth and menace. \u201cNow, we talk. You see, my beloved isn\u2019t what you think. He\u2019s part of something much larger, something darker. And you, my dear kidnapper, might just be the key to turning the tide.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Derek asked, genuinely confused.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a war coming,\u201d she said, her eyes distant, as if seeing something far away. \u201cA war between those who want to control, and those who want to be free. My beloved is on the wrong side, and so was I, once. But you, you could help us.\u201d\n\n\u201cHelp you?\u201d Derek echoed, incredulous. \u201cYou just tossed me across the room like a rag doll.\u201d\n\nShe laughed again, a sound that sent chills down his spine. \u201cYes, I did. And I could do much worse. But I see potential in you. You\u2019re desperate enough to change, to do what\u2019s necessary.\u201d\n\nDerek took a deep breath. \u201cAlright, say I believe you. What\u2019s the plan?\u201d\n\nShe extended her hand again, this time in a gesture of alliance. \u201cWe start by taking down the ones who sent you. They\u2019re the real danger here.\u201d\n\nDerek hesitated, then took her hand. \u201cOkay. But if this goes south, I\u2019m blaming you.\u201d\n\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d she said, a mischievous glint in her eye. \u201cLet\u2019s get to work.\u201d\n\nAs they left the mansion together, Derek couldn\u2019t help but wonder what he had gotten himself into. One thing was certain: his life was never going to be the same.",

No sooner than he aimed his fork towards the cheesecake, the warehouse door slammed open.\n\n\"Freeze!\" Detective Katrina Watson shouted as she aimed her gun towards Ralph. \"You're under arrest for kidnapping...Elvari?\"\n\n\"Kidnapping?\" He sounded displeased. \"I was told this was a tea party!\"\n\n\"It's a kidnapping,\" Carl pressed the muzzle of his gun against Elvari's head. \"Detective, take a step closer and I'll blow his brains out.\"\n\n\"Which brain?\" Elvari asked in the puzzled tone. \"I have nine of these squiggly organs you call brains.\"\n\n\"Oh god Elvari, this is not the time for jokes!\" Kat bemoaned. \"Not when you're the target of a kidnapping attempt.\"\n\n\"But I do actually have nine brains in total...\" he pouted and tented his tentacles. \"I know...they've been accused of sharing one same braincell at times, but they're still nine separate brains.\"\n\n\"Boys, I'd advise you put your guns down,\" Kat spoke to the armed gangsters surrounding them. \"You have picked literally the worst target to kidnap to impede my investigations.

The living room was tastefully decorated, with family photos lining the walls. There she was, sitting on a plush armchair, reading a book.

My gun was knocked from my hand, and I found myself on the floor, gasping for breath.

I rubbed my throat, my mind racing with thoughts of escape, but something about her presence kept me rooted to the spot.\n\n\"What's your name?\" she asked, her tone softer now, almost gentle.\n\n\"Marcus,\" I replied, still wary.\n\n\"Well, Marcus,\" she said, picking up the book she had been reading. \"It seems you've found yourself in quite the predicament. You see, Veritas didn't just send you to kidnap a schoolteacher.

No wonder she had taken me down so easily.\n\n\"They didn't tell you, did they?\" she continued, shaking her head. \"Typical. They always underestimate the people they cast aside.\"\n\nI took a step back, my instincts screaming at me to run, but she held up a hand. \"Wait.

She was offering me a chance to flip the script, to turn the tables on those who had sent me here. It was dangerous, reckless even, but something in her eyes told me she was serious.\n\n\"What do you need me to do?\" I asked, the decision made.\n\nHer smile returned, this time warm and genuine. \"First, we're going to pay my husband a visit. He's been working on something that might just give us the upper hand.\"\n\nAs we left the house together, I couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation.

        "story_b": "The mission was supposed to be straightforward. Kidnap the loved one of the infamous sorcerer Alaric, use them as bait to lure him out, and then deliver him to the council. Easy enough, right? I'd handled tougher jobs. As I crept through the dimly lit corridors of the mansion, my confidence wavered only slightly. The target was supposed to be harmless\u2014a scholar, not a warrior. But as I approached their study, the flickering candlelight cast strange shadows that made my skin prickle with unease.\n\nI paused at the doorway, peering inside. The room was cluttered with scrolls and books, the air thick with the smell of parchment and ink. In the center sat a figure, their back to me, seemingly engrossed in a tome. My heart beat steadily as I stepped forward, a soft whisper of movement. Then, the figure turned, and I found myself staring into eyes that gleamed with a predatory awareness that sent a chill down my spine.\n\n\"You're not the first to try this,\" they said, their voice calm yet laced with amusement. \"And I doubt you'll be the last.\"\n\nI barely had time to react before the room seemed to come alive. Books flew from the shelves, their pages cutting through the air like blades. I ducked, narrowly avoiding a tome that whizzed past my ear. My instincts screamed at me to retreat, but my pride urged me forward. I was a professional, after all.\n\nThe scholar\u2014no, the warrior\u2014moved with a grace that belied their scholarly appearance. They flicked their wrist, and shadows pooled at their feet, rising up to obscure their form. I darted sideways, hoping to flank them, but the shadows followed, twisting and turning to keep me at bay.\n\n\"You thought this would be easy, didn't you?\" Their voice echoed around the room, disembodied, as if the very walls were speaking. \"Most people do.\"\n\nI didn't answer. Instead, I grabbed a nearby chair, using it as a makeshift shield against the relentless assault of flying books. The absurdity of the situation was not lost on me, and I couldn't help but chuckle. Outmatched by a librarian\u2014what a way to go.\n\nWith a sudden burst of inspiration, I swung the chair, scattering the books momentarily. I seized the opportunity to dive behind a desk, catching my breath. I needed a new plan. Clearly, I was dealing with someone far more formidable than anticipated.\n\nThe shadows danced around the room, and I knew I had to act fast. I rummaged through my pouch, fingers closing around a small vial of oil. With a quick flick of my wrist, I splashed it across the floor, igniting it with a spark from a flint.\n\nThe fire blazed to life, the light banishing the shadows to the corners of the room. For the first time, I saw the scholar fully\u2014their features sharp, eyes glinting with intelligence and something else, something dangerous.\n\nThey paused, assessing me with a curious tilt of their head. \"Clever,\" they admitted, the hint of a smile on their lips. \"But not clever enough.\"\n\nWith a flick of their hand, the flames sputtered out, leaving only smoke and the smell of charred wood. I cursed under my breath. This was not going to end well.\n\nIn that moment of quiet, I realized I had underestimated them entirely. They weren't just defending themselves; they were toying with me. I had to rethink my strategy, and fast.\n\nA sudden idea struck me. Maybe brute force wasn't the answer. Maybe... maybe I could talk my way out of this. It was a long shot, but better than the alternative.\n\n\"Look,\" I said, raising my hands in a gesture of peace. \"This isn't personal. It's just business.\"\n\nThey regarded me with a mixture of skepticism and curiosity, the shadows receding slightly. \"Business? Kidnapping is a poor business indeed.\"\n\nI shrugged, trying to appear nonchalant. \"True. But what if we could make it... mutually beneficial?\"\n\nThe scholar laughed, a sound both musical and dangerous. \"And what exactly do you propose?\"\n\n\"An alliance,\" I suggested, the words tumbling out before I could second-guess them. \"You help me take down Alaric, and in return, I make sure the council leaves you alone.\"\n\nTheir eyes narrowed, considering my offer. For a moment, the only sound was the crackle of the dying fire. Then, slowly, they nodded.\n\n\"Very well,\" they said, extending a hand. \"But betray me, and you'll find this encounter was the least of your worries.\"\n\nI took their hand, sealing our unexpected alliance. As we left the study, a new plan forming in my mind, I couldn't help but feel a grudging respect for my would-be target. They had been more than a match for me, and now, perhaps, they would be the ally I never knew I needed.\n\nIn the end, I realized, it wasn't about the mission. It was about the unexpected paths we take and the unlikely alliances we forge along the way.",

She twisted, and I found myself face down on the table, my arm pinned painfully behind my back. The caf\u00e9 patrons continued their conversations, oblivious to the sudden violence.\n\n\"You really should do your homework before attempting something like this,\" she whispered in my ear, her breath warm against my skin. \"Did you honestly think you could kidnap me?\"\n\nI struggled, trying to break free, but her grip was unyielding. \"Who are you?\" I gasped, the pain in my arm intensifying.\n\n\"Let's just say I'm not as helpless as I look,\" she replied, releasing me abruptly. I stumbled back, rubbing my wrist and glaring at her.\n\n\"Why didn't you just kill me?\" I spat, my pride wounded more than my body.\n\nShe shrugged, leaning back in her chair. \"Because I want to know who sent you and why.\"\n\nFrom the corner of my eye, I saw a shadow move\u2014The Specter, no doubt, lurking nearby and watching us. He must have known she was dangerous, but he didn't intervene. Why?\n\n\"Fine,\" I said, deciding to play along. \"I was sent to kidnap you to get to The Specter. Happy now?\"\n\nHer laughter was soft but chilling. \"Oh, you poor fool. Did you really think you could use me against him? We've been aware of your little plan from the start.\"\n\nMy heart sank. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nShe leaned forward, her eyes locking onto mine. \"I knew you were coming. I let you get close because I wanted to see if you were worth saving.\"\n\nMy confusion must have been evident because she continued, \"Everyone deserves a second chance, even kidnappers. So, here's the deal. You walk away from this, and we forget it ever happened. Or you can keep trying and face the consequences.\"\n\n\"You're giving me a choice?\" I asked, incredulous.\n\n\"Call it an act of mercy,\" she said, standing up and tossing a few bills on the table to cover her coffee. \"But don't mistake it for weakness.\"\n\nAs she walked away, I felt a strange mix of relief and frustration. She was letting me go, but why? I followed her out of the caf\u00e9, keeping a safe distance. She led me to a secluded alley where The Specter waited, his silhouette barely visible in the shadows.\n\n\"You've got guts, I'll give you that,\" he said, his voice low and menacing. \"But if you ever come near her again, I won't be so forgiving.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I asked, genuinely curious. \"Why not just kill me and be done with it?\"\n\nThe Specter stepped forward, his face still obscured. \"Because she believes in second chances, even for people like you. And for her sake, I'm willing to give you one.\"\n\nI looked at Lisa, who stood silently beside him, her expression unreadable. \"Why do you care?\" I asked her.\n\n\"Because everyone deserves a chance to change,\" she said simply. \"Even you.\"\n\nThe Specter placed a hand on her shoulder, a silent gesture of support. \"Now go,\" he commanded. \"Before I change my mind.\"\n\nI turned and walked away, my mind racing. They had seen through my plan from the start, yet they chose to let me live. It was a strange and humbling experience. As I left the alley, I couldn't help but wonder what kind of person could turn a kidnapping into a lesson on redemption.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, there was hope for me after all.",

        "story_b": "Sherlock Holmes stood in the dimly lit Haunted House, flickering lanterns casting eerie shadows across his face. The scent of candy floss mingled with the crisp autumn air, creating a peculiar ambiance. Beside him, John Watson adjusted his own ill-fitting jumper, muttering, \"I feel like a walking pumpkin in this.\"\n\n\"This is hardly the case of the century, John,\" Sherlock quipped, tugging at the neckline of his own garish jumper, emblazoned with a garish cartoon bat. \"These jumpers aren't known for their flattering fit.\"\n\nJohn chuckled, \"But it might be the most colorful.\"\n\nThe Haunted House was bustling with visitors, children giggling nervously as they approached the entrance. Suddenly, a commotion erupted from the corner where the dragon costume lurked, its elongated neck snapping playfully at unsuspecting visitors.\n\n\"That costume has a mind of its own,\" John remarked, watching as a child shrieked with delight rather than fear.\n\nSherlock rolled his eyes. \"I think I'd be far better suited to being a dragon tamer,\" he said dryly, marching over to the costume. He bent down, inspecting the mechanism within. \"Ah, faulty wiring,\" he deduced, swiftly untangling the mess. \"Elementary.\"\n\nAs he stood, the dragon head gave an affectionate nip at his shoulder, earning a reluctant smile from Sherlock. \"Quite the bite you've got there,\" he said, patting the costume's snout.\n\nMeanwhile, the candy floss machine began to emit a strange whirring sound, clouds of pink sugar swirling like mischievous spirits. A young girl nearby yelped as her hair became entangled in the sticky mess. Sherlock sighed, striding over with determination.\n\n\"Hold still,\" he instructed, deftly untangling the candy floss from the girl\u2019s hair. \"This is more convoluted than any case file.\"\n\nJohn joined him, trying to suppress his laughter. \"You look like you're in a story by Lewis Carroll.\"\n\n\"More like H.G. Wells, given the technology involved,\" Sherlock retorted, a hint of amusement in his eyes.\n\nThe girl beamed at him, \"You're a real-life hero, Mr. Dragon!\"\n\nSherlock straightened, a rare, genuine smile tugging at his lips. \"Hardly,\" he replied, but the warmth in his voice betrayed his pleasure.\n\nAs the evening wore on, the chaos continued. The dragon costume snapped at visitors with playful mischief, and the candy floss machine occasionally sputtered out puffs of sugar. Yet, amidst the absurdity, Sherlock found himself unexpectedly enjoying the whimsical nature of it all.\n\nJohn watched him, noting the subtle changes in his demeanor. \"Perhaps a cape would suit you better, Sherlock,\" he suggested, gesturing to the jumper. \n\n\"If you ever suggest I wear that jumper again, John, I will personally see to its destruction,\" Sherlock declared with mock severity.\n\nJohn laughed, clapping him on the shoulder. \"Deal.\"\n\nAs the Haunted House finally quieted down, Sherlock and John stood side by side, surveying the aftermath of their adventure. The lanterns flickered, casting a cozy glow over the scene.\n\n\"Not the worst way to spend an evening,\" John admitted.\n\nSherlock nodded, a touch of contentment in his voice. \"No, not the worst at all.\"",

It's for charity. Besides, it's not every day you get to see a dragon costume with a mind of its own.\"\n\nIndeed, the dragon costume was an impressive\u2014if somewhat defective\u2014creation. Designed to loom menacingly over guests as they entered the house, it had unfortunately developed a habit of snapping its jaws at anyone who got too close. Which, as it turned out, included Sherlock. \n\n\"Watch it, Sherlock, the dragon's biting again!\" John called, barely concealing his amusement as the dragon's head lurched forward, narrowly missing Sherlock's ear.\n\nSherlock sidestepped with a huff. \"This is ridiculous,\" he muttered, adjusting the unflattering jumper that Mrs. Hudson had insisted he wear for the occasion. It was an eye-searing shade of orange, adorned with a pattern that vaguely resembled cobwebs. \n\n\"At least it matches the dragon's scales,\" John quipped, earning himself a withering glare from Sherlock.\n\nInside, the haunted house was a whirlwind of chaos. Fog machines belched clouds of mist, while strobe lights flickered erratically. The air was filled with the sounds of creaking floorboards and eerie wails, punctuated by the occasional shriek from a startled visitor.\n\nIn the corner, a candy floss machine was churning out a sticky, sugary mess. Somehow, the floss had managed to escape its confines and was now clinging to every available surface, creating a web of pastel-colored chaos. \n\n\"John, the candy floss is staging a coup,\" Sherlock observed dryly as they passed by, lifting a strand of pink fluff off his shoulder with disdain.\n\n\"Looks like it's winning,\" John replied, trying to stifle his laughter as he watched a group of children attempt to untangle themselves from the sticky trap.\n\nThe evening continued in a similar vein, with the dragon costume causing havoc and the candy floss becoming an unintentional attraction in its own right. As the night wore on, even Sherlock seemed to relent slightly, his irritation giving way to a grudging acceptance of the absurdity around him.\n\nFinally, as the last guests trickled out and the haunted house began to wind down, John turned to Sherlock with a grin. \"Admit it, you had fun.\"\n\nSherlock hesitated, then sighed. \"It was... not entirely without merit,\" he conceded, though his tone suggested he was loath to admit even that much.\n\nJohn chuckled, clapping him on the back. \"See? Told you. And look on the bright side\u2014we survived a dragon attack and a candy floss rebellion. I'd call that a success.\"\n\nSherlock's lips twitched in what might have been the ghost of a smile. \"I suppose,\" he said, finally allowing himself a moment of levity. \"Though next time, John, you're wearing the jumper.\"\n\nWith that, they stepped back into the cool night air, leaving behind the chaos of the haunted house but carrying with them the memory of an evening that, despite its absurdities, had proven unexpectedly entertaining.",

There were tooth marks on the kid\u2019s neck.\u201d\n\u201cDragon ate our Albert!\u201d Sally said.\n\u201cWhat? How do you know the kid was called Albert?\u201d Sherlock asked.\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d John said. \u201cOh, speaking of dragons, it\u2019s fallen over and can\u2019t get back up again.\u201d\n\u201cIt will,\u201d Greg said. \u201cI\u2019ll prod it with St George\u2019s spear.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why is there a dragon? They\u2019re not traditional Hallowe\u2019en creatures.\u201d\n\u201cMycroft got a cheap George and the Dragon costume. We\u2019re not using the George part, although the spear is quite useful. The dragon costume needs adjusting. At the moment Seb\u2019s at the front and Jim\u2019s at the back. Molly thinks it would work better with Jim at the front, but Seb doesn\u2019t fit in the back half. I must be off, dragon to right, punters to welcome. Have a good day, folks!\u201d\nWith that Greg departed, ignoring the various rude words flung in his direction.",
        "story_a": "John Watson had been many things in his life\u2014soldier, doctor, and flatmate to the world's most insufferable consulting detective. But as he stood in the center of 221B Baker Street, surrounded by cobweb decorations and a dragon costume that looked suspiciously like it had been dragged through a hedge, he found himself confronting a new role: Haunted House manager.\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" Sherlock declared, holding up a garish orange jumper adorned with a grinning pumpkin. \"There are limits to what even I will tolerate for the sake of an investigation.\"\n\nJohn sighed, rubbing his temples. \"It's for the kids, Sherlock. And it's not an investigation. Mrs. Hudson asked us to help because the community center's short-staffed.\"\n\n\"Semantics,\" Sherlock muttered, but he reluctantly pulled the jumper over his head, looking like he'd rather be dissecting a corpse.\n\nThe dragon costume lay ominously on the sofa, and John eyed it warily. \"Does it bite?\" he asked, half-joking.\n\nSherlock shot him a withering look. \"Don't be ridiculous, John. It doesn't\u2014\" He stopped mid-sentence as the dragon's head snapped towards him with a mechanical growl. \"Oh, for heaven's sake.\"\n\n\"Looks like it does,\" John said with a smirk. \"Come on, let's get this show on the road.\"\n\nThe community center was a buzz of activity. Children in various states of costume chaos darted around, high on sugar and excitement. Sherlock's dragon costume, now safely worn by a teenager who seemed to have no issues with its mechanical tendencies, was a hit. \n\nSherlock, meanwhile, was manning the 'Mad Scientist's Laboratory,' which mostly involved glaring at anyone who approached his station. John was in charge of the candy floss machine, a task he quickly regretted as pink sticky clouds began to envelop him.\n\n\"Sherlock,\" John called out, trying to disentangle himself from the sugary mess, \"a little help here?\"\n\nSherlock glanced over, his expression a mix of amusement and disdain. \"John, you look like a yeti caught in a candy floss avalanche.\"\n\n\"Very funny,\" John grumbled, but couldn't help a chuckle. \"Just, can you\u2014\" \n\nBefore he could finish, a small child tugged on Sherlock's jumper. \"Mr. Dragon, can I have some candy floss, please?\"\n\nSherlock's eyes softened\u2014a rare sight. \"Of course,\" he said, taking the child's hand and leading them over to the machine.\n\nAs the night wore on, the chaos only increased. The dragon costume had somehow ended up in the haunted maze, terrorizing teenagers and causing several to flee in exaggerated horror. Sherlock's jumper had acquired a few new stains, courtesy of overenthusiastic children with sticky hands. And John, well, he was still fighting a losing battle with the candy floss machine.\n\nBut amidst the absurdity, there were moments\u2014fleeting, but precious\u2014where laughter rang out and smiles were shared. Sherlock, despite his grumbling, had a glimmer of enjoyment in his eyes. John, tired but happy, couldn't deny the warmth that filled his heart seeing Sherlock engage with the children, even if it was in his own peculiar way.\n\nAs the night came to an end, Sherlock turned to John, a rare smile playing on his lips. \"Perhaps there's something to be said for unflattering jumpers and candy floss chaos after all.\"\n\nJohn laughed, clapping Sherlock on the shoulder. \"Happy Halloween, Sherlock.\"\n\n\"Happy Halloween, John.\"",
        "story_b": "\"John, this is absurd,\" Sherlock Holmes grumbled, tugging at the hem of an offensively orange jumper that declared in bold black letters: 'Official Haunted House Guide'. The Haunted House attraction loomed behind them, a haphazard amalgamation of creaky floorboards, fake cobwebs, and the unmistakable scent of candy floss gone rogue.\n\n\"Think of it as a case, Sherlock,\" John Watson replied, attempting to maintain a semblance of order. \"A mystery to solve. Besides, Mrs. Hudson insisted we help her friend.\"\n\nSherlock sighed dramatically. \"If by 'mystery' you mean managing a malfunctioning dragon costume and corralling sugar-fueled children, then yes, a riveting case indeed.\"\n\nAs if on cue, a child shrieked as the dragon costume\u2014previously suspended in eerie stillness\u2014lurched forward with a mechanical growl. Its eyes glowed an unsettling red, and its wings flapped with a mind of their own, sending a gust of air through the room.\n\n\"Fantastic,\" Sherlock muttered. \"The dragon costume's gone rogue.\"\n\nJohn chuckled. \"You fix the dragon, I'll distract the visitors.\"\n\nWith a theatrical roll of his eyes, Sherlock approached the dragon, examining the machinery with his usual analytical precision. Meanwhile, John gathered the children around him, launching into an impromptu ghost story. \"Once upon a time, in a house just like this one...\"\n\nSherlock focused on the dragon's wiring, his fingers deftly navigating the tangled mess. \"Simple mechanics,\" he murmured, disconnecting a few wires and reconnecting them with a sharp click. The dragon stilled, its eyes dimming to a harmless yellow.\n\n\"How's it going, Sherlock?\" John called, his ghost story reaching its crescendo with the kids hanging on his every word.\n\n\"It's as fixed as it can be,\" Sherlock replied, turning back to the crowd. \"Though I suspect our issues stem from more mischievous roots.\"\n\nAs the attraction continued, Sherlock's gaze flitted around the room. A group of children, suspiciously giggling in the corner, caught his attention. One child held a remote control, its antenna pointed toward the dragon.\n\n\"Ah, our culprits,\" Sherlock said, striding over with the jumper flapping ridiculously. \"Ingenious, but you'll have to try harder to fool me.\"\n\nThe children burst into laughter, their prank exposed. \"You caught us, Mr. Holmes!\" one of them exclaimed.\n\nJohn joined them, a broad grin on his face. \"Looks like we've been outsmarted by children, Sherlock.\"\n\nSherlock huffed, though amusement tugged at the corners of his mouth. \"A clever ruse. Perhaps I underestimated the complexity of this case.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you did,\" John agreed, clapping Sherlock on the back. \"Now, let's finish this day without further chaos, shall we?\"\n\nBy the end of the night, the Haunted House had returned to its charming disarray, and the visitors departed with tales of their own. As they locked up, Sherlock caught sight of his reflection in a mirror, the garish jumper still in place.\n\n\"Admit it, Sherlock,\" John teased, \"you enjoyed it more than you thought.\"\n\nSherlock sighed, a rare smile gracing his features. \"Perhaps. But don't expect me to wear this jumper again.\"\n\nJohn laughed, leading the way out. \"Come on, let's go home before the dragon decides to take another bite.\"",

        "ground_truth": "The girl with the purple eyes did not like having her picture taken. She scowled into the camera with alarming intensity.\n\n\u201cSmile,\u201d the photographer said, flashing his own toothy grin.\n\nHer face remained unchanged. No one had asked how she felt being cornered by a stranger, or if she wanted to smile, and scowling was her only means of protest.\n\nThe girl with the purple eyes didn\u2019t actually have purple eyes\u2014that\u2019s just how they looked to her classmates. Really they were deep-blue. The purple came from them being sunken, dark underneath, like a smudged plum or bruises: the combination of inherited memory\u2014generations and generations of purple-eyed women\u2014and many sleepless nights spent coughing, small lungs gasping for air.\n\nShe got her lungs from her father, who had suffered from asthma as well. Growing up, he was thin, probably from the lack of oxygen, breathing in just enough to survive and nothing more. Not enough to thrive or grow or run the way that most boys do, and so he remained small and devoted himself to studying biology and later, medicine. He was different from the other men in his family, and perhaps it was his smallness that made him kind.\n\nThe purple-eyed women on her mother\u2019s side began generations ago. Years of stored fears, doubts, holding of breath so that Dad doesn\u2019t hear you under the bed; the acceptance that even if he doesn\u2019t hear you, he knows exactly where you are; the truth that there is no escape. Small girls\u2019 bodies covered in fingerprints, dealt with harshly, like overworked clay.\n\nIt\u2019s the lack of air that makes for purple eyes, whether it be from fear, asthma, dreams of drowning, or the inherited memory of what\u2019s mine is theirs, especially if what\u2019s mine is feminine and soft\u2014the remembering through mothers and mothers and mothers.\n\nAfter taking her photo, the toothy man, Wes, gave her a nod. While he wished he could\u2019ve coaxed a smile out of this last one, it had been a pretty successful day. Two hours of wrangling a pre-K class into solo photos outside on the playground without a single tantrum or tear shed was success in his book.\n\nWes\u2019s standard of success had changed since his art school days. Back then he spent hours shooting smoke clouds on film, or nude men in black and white. Back then success meant he had been invited onto a shoot with some obscure creative vision or had scored a free drink at a bar, sent over by someone mysterious, attractive, older. He never could have guessed that elementary-class photos would end up paying his bills, or that he would learn how to make four-year-olds smile with his exaggerated facial expressions, almost without fail.\n\nWhen he got home Wes popped a bag of ready-to-steam frozen edamame into the microwave and stared at the photo of that girl, the one with eyes so deep he felt they might fall right into her head.\n\nDamn.\n\nShe was only four or five, with bangs that cut straight across her forehead, her hair pulled back at the nape of her neck into a loose ponytail. She wore a smocked blue cotton dress that popped against her olive skin. It was an eerie photo, and this was one of those rare moments when he looked at his work and remembered what it felt like to be an artist. Suddenly, he was glad she hadn\u2019t smiled. This made for a much better photo. Maybe not something her parents would want to hang on the fridge, but still.\n\n\nNicole pulled up thirty minutes late, screeching to a halt in front of the school. Thirty minutes late meant she would have to retrieve Ella from the office.\n\n\u201cWe have a three-strike system, okay?\u201d said Ms. Smith, the school\u2019s head of administration. She was a petite lady with a southern accent, always wearing a full face of makeup, always in heels. She was someone whom Nicole would have avoided at first glance, but two months into the school year Ms. Smith had proven to be kind, warm-hearted, and welcoming while Ella and her mom learned what it meant to attend St. Ignatius Day School.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fret about it today. I know how hard it can be with traffic and all. It\u2019s just a formality,\u201d she said, handing Ella\u2019s mom a hot-pink \u201ctardy slip.\u201d\n\nDespite Ms. Smith\u2019s reassurance, the hot-pink slip certainly felt like more than just a formality. As she strode down the hall to the office, every teacher she passed stared her down, giving her a disdainful once-over. She folded the piece of paper and shoved it into her purse.\n\nDon\u2019t you care about your child? Are you completely self-absorbed? Don\u2019t you know how traumatizing it is to be forgotten? Think of how this could impact her future.\n\nShe added her own harsh words to their disapproving glances.\n\nQuite honestly, she had forgotten Ella. Well, not forgotten entirely\u2014she had lost track of time. She had been drifting in and out of sleep, and suddenly it was 2:55, leaving her just five minutes to make the almost thirty-minute drive to Ella\u2019s school.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t taken the time to put on something more \u201cadult,\u201d or even more \u201cmom,\u201d and now she walked briskly through the hallway in Ugg slippers and mismatched pajamas.\n\nOn the way home Ella and her mom stopped for Chick-fil-A, a rare indulgence that they decided they had both earned. Ella got a fried-chicken sandwich and a Sprite. She ate about half her sandwich before tucking the rest away in the pocket of the seat in front of her, saving it for later. She took a pull of Sprite through the straw and nodded the way little kids do when they are exceptionally pleased with their choice in beverage.\n\nElla caught her mom\u2019s eye in the rearview mirror and scrunched up her face in a smile.\n\nRelief swept through Nicole\u2019s shoulders and chest. She could almost cry.\n\n\u201cToday a man with very white teeth took our pictures without asking,\u201d Ella said.\n\n\u201cI know, hon. I told you about school pictures today. That\u2019s why you wore your dress, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I forgot,\u201d Ella stated matter-of-factly, taking another swig of Sprite.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Ella. Hey, on our way home I\u2019m going to run into Walgreens, okay? You can stay in the car and finish your Sprite.\u201d\n\nElla nodded.\n\n\nWes grabbed his gym bag from the bench by the door and threw it over his shoulder, digging around in his jacket pocket for his car keys. At thirty-three, he had promised himself that he would never fall victim to that soft, midthirties dad-bod that so many of his friends had grown into, so he worked out often and ate \u201cclean.\u201d Sure, dad-bods were fine for them\u2014most of them settling into complacent, accepting relationships\u2014but he could do better.\n\nOn his way to the gym he stopped by the Walgreens to pick up some Advil, Irish Springs body wash, and a Gatorade Zero. Out of habit he waved at the TV monitor that greeted him, and the tiny mirror image version of him on the monitor waved back.\n\nA woman walked in just as he finished waving, and Wes caught a glimpse of her in the monitor. He was transported. Her eyes were sad, sunken, dark, purple underneath, almost like someone had taken a fist to each of them. It was the second time that day Wes had seen eyes like those. His eyes followed her to the prescription counter, until the rotating display of reading glasses blocked her from view.\n\nThat evening Wes fell asleep on the couch while watching Spencer, his favorite film about Princess Diana. His dreams began with the haunted face of Princess Di as she appeared in the film, played by Kristen Stewart, withering away under the watchful eye of the royal family. Suddenly she was joined by the purple-eyed girl and the purple-eyed woman he had seen earlier that day. The three of them followed him everywhere he went\u2014the gym, the grocery store, the car wash\u2014but in a strange turn of events, he realized that it was he who was following them. He caught their reflections in windows, TV screens, puddles in the street. He stalked them with his camera, like a member of the paparazzi, desperate to get the right angle, the perfect photo. They did not say anything to him or acknowledge that he was there. He followed them all the way to their house in the English countryside, and then he woke up.\n\n\nElla\u2019s dad worked late that night, so Ella and her mom agreed to watch a few episodes of Little Bear while Ella had a breathing treatment. The mask fit over her mouth and nose with a blue elastic strap that went behind her head, like the kind they show you on an airplane \u201cin case of a loss of cabin pressure.\u201d By now Ella was used to the sounds and smells of albuterol being pumped into her lungs and she relaxed into her beanbag chair, watching while Little Bear scooped the moon up into his bucket of water. One hour later, Ella was showered and tucked into bed wearing her polyester blue Cinderella nightgown.\n\n\u201cGoodnight, Ella. Sweet dreams,\u201d her mom said, pulling her door almost to a close.\n\nThen Nicole crawled into her own bed, allowing her feet to stretch as far as they could down into the cool cotton sheets, allowing herself to spread starfish for a moment before turning over onto her left side into a small fetal position.\n\nIt would be a late night for Michael, which meant a less than ideal night\u2019s sleep for her. She would be on edge until he got home. She tried waiting up and opened her copy of The House of the Spirits, a book she had reread more times than she could count. Somehow she found it comforting. Something about the stored-up generations of motherhood, the trauma manifested in physical bodies, the brokenness, but also the slow growth and healing that rolled through the Trueba and del Valle families. It made her feel hopeful. She drifted in and out of sleep. Eventually, she slipped into deep sleep, the kind filled with rhythmic breathing and vivid dreams.\n\nShe dreamed that she was wandering the hallways of a big creaky house with heavy curtains and doors. She didn\u2019t recognize the house but seemed to know exactly where to go. She was small again and wore a white nightgown smattered with blue and pink flowers. She was looking for something.\n\nShe found her way to the kitchen and paused outside the closed door. There were voices on the other side and she could see the lights on, glowing underneath. They were cold, blue, like hospital lights, or the kind associated with an alien abduction\u2014not like the lights of the kitchen she knew. The voices she heard sounded sterile. She didn\u2019t want to open the door because she didn\u2019t want anyone to see her, so she peeked through the keyhole and let out a silent scream.\n\nSplayed out on the kitchen table was Nicole\u2019s Ella, though in this strange world she and Ella both looked about five\u2014not possibly mother and daughter. Ella was spread wide like a butchered animal, two men bent over her little body\u2014men rummaging around in her abdomen, poking and prodding with long metal prongs, wringing out her insides like wet paper towels, slicing through her soft belly and cracking open her chest cavity. They whispered and laughed. They seemed to be searching for something inside her, like pearl divers slicing open oyster shells, unbothered by oyster flesh and juice.\n\nElla\u2019s mom could hear every snap and squelch as the men made themselves familiar with Ella\u2019s insides, as if the awful sounds were being broadcast over a loud speaker. Then one of the men pulled out a camera with a big flashbulb on top and started snapping pictures of Ella\u2019s body from all different angles, contorted, bloodied, splayed open, her eyes empty and deep. Every flash lit the room like a burst of lightning, and the snap of the lens made Ella\u2019s mom feel sick\u2014the snap, flash, snap, flash over and over again, like a strobe light.\n\nThis was more than Nicole could bear, and she let out another scream, though this one was not silent. It was loud, desperate to be heard.\n\nSuddenly she was awake, catching the end of her own scream, which had followed her from nightmare into consciousness. For a moment she didn\u2019t know where she was. She was enveloped in dense, still darkness. She felt a small rustle and realized she was in Ella\u2019s room, kneeling beside her bed. She felt her own face, wet with tears; felt her arms and shoulders, her chest, making sure she was in her adult body again.\n\nThen she felt Ella\u2019s arm, gently; her shoulders, her head. She was warm, small and whole, still in her Cinderella nightgown, breathing deeply. Her eyes fluttered open.\n\n\u201cMom, did you have a bad dream?\u201d Ella asked, her voice full of sleep. She stroked her mom\u2019s head gently, the way someone might pet a wild animal or baby bird.\n\n\u201cElla, I did. I had a really bad dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to get in? To help you sleep?\u201d Ella lifted her comforter a bit, showing the wide expanse of unoccupied twin bed to her left.\n\n\u201cFor a little bit. Just until Dad gets home.\u201d Nicole answered, climbing into bed.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The first time I saw her eyes, I was crouched behind the lens of my Leica, adjusting the focus to capture the delicate interplay of light and shadow in the crowded marketplace. It was late afternoon, and the sun cast a golden hue over the scene, deepening the colors of the vendor stalls and the faces of the people drifting through the narrow aisles. I was just a visitor, passing through this small town on my way to nowhere in particular, drawn by the promise of capturing the essence of everyday life in my photographs.\n\nThen I saw her. She stood apart from the bustling crowd, a still figure in a sea of movement. Her dark hair framed a face that seemed both ageless and ancient, and her eyes\u2014those haunting, deep-set eyes\u2014gazed directly into the lens as if she could see through it, into me. They were eyes that spoke of wisdom and sorrow far beyond her years, and I knew in that moment that I had to capture them.\n\nI clicked the shutter once, twice, three times, unable to tear myself away from the intensity of her gaze. It was only when a woman, presumably her mother, hurried over and took her by the hand that I lowered my camera. The woman glanced at me briefly, her expression one of guarded suspicion, before leading the girl away. But those eyes stayed with me, burned into my memory and, more importantly, onto my film.\n\nBack in my small rented room, I developed the photos in the makeshift darkroom I had set up in the bathroom. The image of the girl emerged slowly, the chemicals revealing the stark contrast of her pale face against the dark backdrop of the market. Her eyes, even in black and white, seemed to hold a depth that was almost supernatural. I found myself staring at the photograph long after it had dried, tracing the lines of her face with my finger, lost in the mystery of who she was and what her eyes were trying to tell me.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and I couldn't shake the image of the girl from my mind. I returned to the marketplace every day, hoping to see her again, but she was never there. I asked around, describing her to the vendors and the regulars, but no one seemed to know who she was. It was as if she had appeared out of nowhere, a ghost haunting my thoughts and my art.\n\nMy obsession with the girl began to consume me. I spent hours each night developing and re-developing the same photograph, trying to tease out more details, to understand the story behind those eyes. I started to dream about her, vivid and unsettling dreams where she would appear in different places\u2014standing in the corner of my room, sitting at the edge of my bed, always watching me with that unblinking gaze.\n\nOne night, as I was poring over the photograph yet again, a knock on the door startled me. I opened it to find the girl's mother standing there, her face pale and drawn, her eyes filled with a mixture of fear and desperation.\n\n\"Please,\" she said, her voice trembling. \"You have to stop.\"\n\n\"Stop what?\" I asked, genuinely confused.\n\n\"Taking pictures of my daughter,\" she replied. \"You've been following us, haven't you?\"\n\n\"No, I\u2014\" I began, but she cut me off.\n\n\"I can feel it,\" she said, her voice rising. \"Every night, I see her in my dreams, watched by strangers, dissected by their eyes and their cameras. It's driving me mad. You have to stop.\"\n\nHer words stunned me into silence. I had no idea that my obsession had been affecting her so deeply, that she had been experiencing the same nightmares that plagued me. I wanted to explain, to apologize, but the intensity of her emotion left me speechless.\n\n\"Please,\" she repeated, tears welling up in her eyes. \"Let us be.\"\n\nShe turned and walked away before I could respond, leaving me standing in the doorway, the weight of her words heavy on my shoulders. I closed the door and returned to my darkroom, staring at the photograph of the girl one last time before tucking it away in a drawer.\n\nI didn't go back to the marketplace after that. I packed my things and moved on, hoping to leave the haunting eyes and the nightmares behind. But even now, years later, I can still see her face in my mind, those eyes staring out at me from the depths of my memory, a reminder of the unintended consequences of my obsession.\n\nIn the years that followed, I traveled far and wide, capturing images of people and places, each photograph a testament to the world as I saw it. But no matter how many faces I photographed, none ever held the same power, the same haunting beauty, as the eyes of that young girl in the marketplace.\n\nAs time passed, I found myself returning to that small town, drawn by an inexplicable need to confront the past. The marketplace was still there, much the same as I remembered it, the same vendors selling their wares, the same vibrant energy filling the air. But the girl and her mother were nowhere to be found.\n\nI wandered through the narrow aisles, my camera hanging heavy around my neck, feeling a strange sense of loss and longing. I had hoped that coming back here would bring some sort of closure, but instead, it only deepened the mystery. I felt like a ghost, drifting through a place that no longer held any answers.\n\nIt was late afternoon when I stumbled upon a small photography shop tucked away in a quiet corner of the marketplace. Curious, I stepped inside, the bell above the door tinkling softly. The shop was filled with old cameras and photographs, a treasure trove of memories captured on film.\n\nAs I browsed the shelves, my eyes were drawn to a photograph hanging on the wall. It was a portrait of a young girl, her dark hair framing a face that seemed both ageless and ancient, her eyes\u2014those haunting, deep-set eyes\u2014gazing directly into the camera. My heart skipped a beat as I realized it was the same girl I had photographed all those years ago.\n\nI turned to the shopkeeper, an elderly man with a kind smile and a twinkle in his eye.\n\n\"Who is she?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThe shopkeeper looked at the photograph and then back at me, his smile fading.\n\n\"She was my granddaughter,\" he said softly. \"She passed away many years ago.\"\n\nI felt a lump form in my throat as I processed his words. The girl, the haunting eyes, the nightmares\u2014it all made sense now. She had been trying to tell me something, to reach out from beyond the grave, and I had been too blind to see it.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said, my voice choked with emotion. \"I didn't know.\"\n\nThe shopkeeper nodded, his eyes filled with a sadness that mirrored my own.\n\n\"She was special,\" he said. \"Her eyes saw things that others couldn't. She had a gift, but it also brought her great pain.\"\n\nI felt a deep sense of guilt wash over me, realizing that my obsession with her had only added to that pain. I wanted to make amends, to find some way to honor her memory, but I didn't know how.\n\n\"May I buy the photograph?\" I asked, hoping that having it would bring some measure of closure.\n\nThe shopkeeper shook his head. \"It's not for sale,\" he said gently. \"But you can have it. She would have wanted you to have it.\"\n\nI took the photograph from the wall, feeling its weight in my hands. It was more than just a picture; it was a connection to a past I could never fully understand, a reminder of the consequences of my actions and the haunting beauty of those eyes.\n\nAs I left the shop, I felt a strange sense of peace settle over me. The girl's eyes would always be with me, a silent witness to my journey and a testament to the power of a single moment captured on film. And in that moment, I knew that my obsession had not been in vain. It had led me to a deeper understanding of myself and the world around me, and for that, I was grateful.\n\nI walked through the marketplace one last time, the photograph clutched tightly in my hand. The sun was setting, casting a golden hue over the scene, deepening the colors and the shadows. I raised my camera and took one final picture, capturing the essence of the place that had changed my life forever. And as I did, I felt the weight of the past lift from my shoulders, replaced by a sense of hope and possibility.\n\nIn the end, it was not the photograph of the girl that haunted me, but the lesson she had taught me: that every image, every moment, holds a story waiting to be discovered, and that sometimes, the most powerful stories are the ones that we least expect.",
        "story_b": "The fog rolled in thick, shrouding the coastal town in a blanket of gray that seemed to dull the edges of reality. It was the kind of morning where time felt suspended, as if the world held its breath waiting for something to tip the scales. In his dimly lit studio, surrounded by vintage cameras and the sharp scent of developing chemicals, Adrian Hart was already lost in his latest obsession.\n\nThe photograph lay before him, a black-and-white portrait of a young girl with eyes that seemed to pierce through the paper. They were pools of shadow that seemed to hold secrets untold, drawing him in with an intensity that left him breathless. Each time he glanced at them, he felt a peculiar sensation, as though the eyes were alive, watching him, understanding him in ways that no one else could.\n\nAdrian's fingers brushed over the photograph, the texture of the paper rough against his skin. He had captured her by chance on a breezy afternoon, the sun breaking through clouds just long enough to cast a halo around her in the park. She had been standing alone, her gaze fixed on something distant, and he had been unable to resist the pull of the light, the way it danced in her eyes.\n\nHe had not intended to take her picture. His focus had been on the landscape, on the way the shadows played against the aged stone fountain. But when he developed the film, her image emerged like a specter, haunting and beautiful, demanding his attention.\n\nAcross town, in a small house nestled at the end of a quiet street, Clara sat bolt upright in her bed, the remnants of a nightmare clinging to her like cobwebs. Her breath came in ragged gasps, her heart pounding a frantic rhythm against her ribs. She pressed a hand to her chest, willing it to calm, to slow, but the images from her dream swirled in her mind, refusing to dissipate.\n\nIn the dream, her daughter, Lily, had been standing in a field of wildflowers, her dress a splash of color against the muted tones of the landscape. Clara had watched, unable to move, as shadows crept closer, faceless figures with cameras and notebooks, their eyes hidden behind dark glasses. They circled Lily, their presence oppressive, and Clara had screamed, a soundless cry that echoed in the void.\n\nClara swung her legs over the side of the bed, her feet meeting the cool floorboards. She needed to see Lily, to hold her, to assure herself that she was safe. The dreams had started a week ago, each one more vivid, more terrifying than the last. They left her shaken and filled with an unshakeable dread, a mother's instinct warning her of danger unseen.\n\nAs she padded down the hallway, the house silent save for the creaking of old wood, she wondered if it was merely her own fears manifesting, a response to the world outside and its endless uncertainties. But deep down, she felt it was more than that, a connection she couldn't comprehend, a thread that tied her to something just beyond her grasp.\n\nIn his studio, Adrian moved through the familiar ritual of developing film, the repetitive motions calming his racing thoughts. He watched as the images came to life, the chemicals etching the light and shadow onto paper, revealing the world as he saw it. Yet, his mind remained tethered to the girl's eyes, their depth and mystery, and the strange compulsion that had taken root within him.\n\nHe had begun to dream of her, though he couldn't recall the details upon waking. It was as if she were a part of him now, embedded in his psyche, a muse and a tormentor all at once. He found himself returning to the park day after day, hoping to glimpse her again, to capture the essence of what had drawn him in so completely.\n\nBut she was never there. Only the echoes of her presence lingered, a whisper on the wind, a shadow beneath the trees. The frustration gnawed at him, a constant reminder of the chasm between desire and reality. He spent hours in his studio, surrounded by the detritus of his obsession, sifting through photographs, searching for clues in the grainy images.\n\nClara stood in the doorway of Lily's room, watching the gentle rise and fall of her daughter's chest. The moonlight cast a soft glow through the window, illuminating the peaceful contours of her face. It was moments like these that she cherished, the stillness and serenity, the assurance that all was well.\n\nYet, the dreams lingered at the edges of her consciousness, a persistent reminder that peace was fleeting, that shadows lurked just beyond the periphery. She wondered if she should tell someone, confide in a friend, seek advice from those who might understand. But the thought of speaking it aloud made it all too real, and so she remained silent, her fears her own to bear.\n\nAs the days passed, Adrian's obsession deepened, a tangled web from which he could not extricate himself. He spent long hours in the archives, poring over old photographs, searching for any trace of the girl, any hint that might explain the hold she had over him. It was during one of these late-night searches that he stumbled upon something that made his blood run cold.\n\nThe photograph was old, sepia-toned and faded, yet unmistakable in its detail. There she was, the same girl, the same eyes, captured in a moment frozen in time. But this photograph was decades old, far older than it should have been, and the realization struck him like a physical blow. She had not aged, not in the slightest.\n\nHe stared at the image, a chill creeping up his spine. How was it possible? Who was she? The questions raced through his mind, each more frantic than the last. It was as if the world had tilted on its axis, the familiar becoming strange and the strange becoming familiar.\n\nThe discovery unraveled something within him, the threads of his obsession pulling tight, binding him to her in ways he could not understand. He felt a compulsion to know more, to uncover the truth that lay hidden beneath layers of time and shadow. Yet, with each step closer, he felt the pull of the abyss, the danger that lurked in the unknown.\n\nClara's nightmares intensified, the shadows growing bolder, more menacing. In her dreams, she saw Lily not as a child but as a timeless figure, her eyes unchanging, her presence eternal. The strangers with cameras circled closer, their whispers filling the air, a language she could not comprehend but felt in the marrow of her bones.\n\nShe awoke each morning with the echoes of those whispers haunting her, a chorus of voices urging her to protect, to guard against the unseen threat. She took to watching Lily more closely, her gaze lingering on her daughter's face, searching for signs, for answers that eluded her waking mind.\n\nIt was on one of these mornings, her resolve steeled by the weight of her dreams, that Clara decided to act. She would not wait for the shadows to close in, for the nightmares to become reality. She would seek out those who might understand, who might help unravel the mystery that bound her daughter to forces unknown.\n\nAdrian, too, felt the urgency, the need to confront the truth that had ensnared him. He returned to the park, the place where it had all begun, hoping for answers, for clarity. The fog lay thick over the town, the world hushed and waiting, as if the very air held its breath.\n\nAs he wandered the familiar paths, his mind a whirlwind of questions and half-formed theories, he caught sight of her\u2014a flash of color in the gray, a figure standing by the fountain. It was her, the girl from his photographs, unchanged, ethereal in the mist.\n\nHis heart raced, a mixture of fear and excitement, as he approached. She turned to face him, her eyes meeting his, and in that moment, he understood. The connection between them, the pull that had drawn him in, was not a product of his imagination. It was real, tangible, a thread that bound them across time and space.\n\nBefore he could speak, before he could reach out, a voice cut through the fog, sharp and clear.\n\n\"Lily!\"\n\nThe girl's head turned, her gaze shifting from Adrian to the woman who had called her name. Clara stood at the edge of the park, her heart pounding, her fears realized. She had seen the man before, in her dreams, his camera an extension of his soul, capturing her daughter in ways she could not fathom.\n\nAdrian stepped back, confusion warring with understanding, as the pieces fell into place. The mother, the child, the nightmares and photographs\u2014a tapestry woven with threads of light and shadow, reality and dream.\n\nClara approached, her expression a mix of protectiveness and curiosity. She had seen the recognition in Adrian's eyes, the understanding that mirrored her own. They stood in silence, the fog swirling around them, the weight of the moment pressing down.\n\n\"I need to know,\" Clara said finally, her voice steady despite the tremor in her heart. \"Why her? Why now?\"\n\nAdrian met her gaze, the truth on the tip of his tongue, the connection between them undeniable. \"I don't know,\" he admitted, the words raw and honest. \"But I think we're meant to find out together.\"\n\nIn that instant, the fog seemed to lift, the world sharpening into focus. They were no longer strangers bound by coincidence but allies in a shared quest, driven by the same need to protect, to understand.\n\nTogether, they turned to Lily, the girl who had brought them together, her eyes holding the secrets of a thousand lifetimes. In her gaze, they saw the past and the future, the promise of answers yet to be discovered.\n\nAs they walked away from the park, the fog closing in behind them, Adrian and Clara knew their journey was only just beginning. They were bound by the mysteries of the girl with haunting eyes, by the dreams that had led them to this moment.\n\nAnd as they stepped into the unknown, they felt the pull of the light, the promise of understanding, guiding them forward into a future where shadows and reality intertwined.",

        "ground_truth": "The girl with the purple eyes did not like having her picture taken. She scowled into the camera with alarming intensity.\n\n\u201cSmile,\u201d the photographer said, flashing his own toothy grin.\n\nHer face remained unchanged. No one had asked how she felt being cornered by a stranger, or if she wanted to smile, and scowling was her only means of protest.\n\nThe girl with the purple eyes didn\u2019t actually have purple eyes\u2014that\u2019s just how they looked to her classmates. Really they were deep-blue. The purple came from them being sunken, dark underneath, like a smudged plum or bruises: the combination of inherited memory\u2014generations and generations of purple-eyed women\u2014and many sleepless nights spent coughing, small lungs gasping for air.\n\nShe got her lungs from her father, who had suffered from asthma as well. Growing up, he was thin, probably from the lack of oxygen, breathing in just enough to survive and nothing more. Not enough to thrive or grow or run the way that most boys do, and so he remained small and devoted himself to studying biology and later, medicine. He was different from the other men in his family, and perhaps it was his smallness that made him kind.\n\nThe purple-eyed women on her mother\u2019s side began generations ago. Years of stored fears, doubts, holding of breath so that Dad doesn\u2019t hear you under the bed; the acceptance that even if he doesn\u2019t hear you, he knows exactly where you are; the truth that there is no escape. Small girls\u2019 bodies covered in fingerprints, dealt with harshly, like overworked clay.\n\nIt\u2019s the lack of air that makes for purple eyes, whether it be from fear, asthma, dreams of drowning, or the inherited memory of what\u2019s mine is theirs, especially if what\u2019s mine is feminine and soft\u2014the remembering through mothers and mothers and mothers.\n\nAfter taking her photo, the toothy man, Wes, gave her a nod. While he wished he could\u2019ve coaxed a smile out of this last one, it had been a pretty successful day. Two hours of wrangling a pre-K class into solo photos outside on the playground without a single tantrum or tear shed was success in his book.\n\nWes\u2019s standard of success had changed since his art school days. Back then he spent hours shooting smoke clouds on film, or nude men in black and white. Back then success meant he had been invited onto a shoot with some obscure creative vision or had scored a free drink at a bar, sent over by someone mysterious, attractive, older. He never could have guessed that elementary-class photos would end up paying his bills, or that he would learn how to make four-year-olds smile with his exaggerated facial expressions, almost without fail.\n\nWhen he got home Wes popped a bag of ready-to-steam frozen edamame into the microwave and stared at the photo of that girl, the one with eyes so deep he felt they might fall right into her head.\n\nDamn.\n\nShe was only four or five, with bangs that cut straight across her forehead, her hair pulled back at the nape of her neck into a loose ponytail. She wore a smocked blue cotton dress that popped against her olive skin. It was an eerie photo, and this was one of those rare moments when he looked at his work and remembered what it felt like to be an artist. Suddenly, he was glad she hadn\u2019t smiled. This made for a much better photo. Maybe not something her parents would want to hang on the fridge, but still.\n\n\nNicole pulled up thirty minutes late, screeching to a halt in front of the school. Thirty minutes late meant she would have to retrieve Ella from the office.\n\n\u201cWe have a three-strike system, okay?\u201d said Ms. Smith, the school\u2019s head of administration. She was a petite lady with a southern accent, always wearing a full face of makeup, always in heels. She was someone whom Nicole would have avoided at first glance, but two months into the school year Ms. Smith had proven to be kind, warm-hearted, and welcoming while Ella and her mom learned what it meant to attend St. Ignatius Day School.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fret about it today. I know how hard it can be with traffic and all. It\u2019s just a formality,\u201d she said, handing Ella\u2019s mom a hot-pink \u201ctardy slip.\u201d\n\nDespite Ms. Smith\u2019s reassurance, the hot-pink slip certainly felt like more than just a formality. As she strode down the hall to the office, every teacher she passed stared her down, giving her a disdainful once-over. She folded the piece of paper and shoved it into her purse.\n\nDon\u2019t you care about your child? Are you completely self-absorbed? Don\u2019t you know how traumatizing it is to be forgotten? Think of how this could impact her future.\n\nShe added her own harsh words to their disapproving glances.\n\nQuite honestly, she had forgotten Ella. Well, not forgotten entirely\u2014she had lost track of time. She had been drifting in and out of sleep, and suddenly it was 2:55, leaving her just five minutes to make the almost thirty-minute drive to Ella\u2019s school.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t taken the time to put on something more \u201cadult,\u201d or even more \u201cmom,\u201d and now she walked briskly through the hallway in Ugg slippers and mismatched pajamas.\n\nOn the way home Ella and her mom stopped for Chick-fil-A, a rare indulgence that they decided they had both earned. Ella got a fried-chicken sandwich and a Sprite. She ate about half her sandwich before tucking the rest away in the pocket of the seat in front of her, saving it for later. She took a pull of Sprite through the straw and nodded the way little kids do when they are exceptionally pleased with their choice in beverage.\n\nElla caught her mom\u2019s eye in the rearview mirror and scrunched up her face in a smile.\n\nRelief swept through Nicole\u2019s shoulders and chest. She could almost cry.\n\n\u201cToday a man with very white teeth took our pictures without asking,\u201d Ella said.\n\n\u201cI know, hon. I told you about school pictures today. That\u2019s why you wore your dress, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I forgot,\u201d Ella stated matter-of-factly, taking another swig of Sprite.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Ella. Hey, on our way home I\u2019m going to run into Walgreens, okay? You can stay in the car and finish your Sprite.\u201d\n\nElla nodded.\n\n\nWes grabbed his gym bag from the bench by the door and threw it over his shoulder, digging around in his jacket pocket for his car keys. At thirty-three, he had promised himself that he would never fall victim to that soft, midthirties dad-bod that so many of his friends had grown into, so he worked out often and ate \u201cclean.\u201d Sure, dad-bods were fine for them\u2014most of them settling into complacent, accepting relationships\u2014but he could do better.\n\nOn his way to the gym he stopped by the Walgreens to pick up some Advil, Irish Springs body wash, and a Gatorade Zero. Out of habit he waved at the TV monitor that greeted him, and the tiny mirror image version of him on the monitor waved back.\n\nA woman walked in just as he finished waving, and Wes caught a glimpse of her in the monitor. He was transported. Her eyes were sad, sunken, dark, purple underneath, almost like someone had taken a fist to each of them. It was the second time that day Wes had seen eyes like those. His eyes followed her to the prescription counter, until the rotating display of reading glasses blocked her from view.\n\nThat evening Wes fell asleep on the couch while watching Spencer, his favorite film about Princess Diana. His dreams began with the haunted face of Princess Di as she appeared in the film, played by Kristen Stewart, withering away under the watchful eye of the royal family. Suddenly she was joined by the purple-eyed girl and the purple-eyed woman he had seen earlier that day. The three of them followed him everywhere he went\u2014the gym, the grocery store, the car wash\u2014but in a strange turn of events, he realized that it was he who was following them. He caught their reflections in windows, TV screens, puddles in the street. He stalked them with his camera, like a member of the paparazzi, desperate to get the right angle, the perfect photo. They did not say anything to him or acknowledge that he was there. He followed them all the way to their house in the English countryside, and then he woke up.\n\n\nElla\u2019s dad worked late that night, so Ella and her mom agreed to watch a few episodes of Little Bear while Ella had a breathing treatment. The mask fit over her mouth and nose with a blue elastic strap that went behind her head, like the kind they show you on an airplane \u201cin case of a loss of cabin pressure.\u201d By now Ella was used to the sounds and smells of albuterol being pumped into her lungs and she relaxed into her beanbag chair, watching while Little Bear scooped the moon up into his bucket of water. One hour later, Ella was showered and tucked into bed wearing her polyester blue Cinderella nightgown.\n\n\u201cGoodnight, Ella. Sweet dreams,\u201d her mom said, pulling her door almost to a close.\n\nThen Nicole crawled into her own bed, allowing her feet to stretch as far as they could down into the cool cotton sheets, allowing herself to spread starfish for a moment before turning over onto her left side into a small fetal position.\n\nIt would be a late night for Michael, which meant a less than ideal night\u2019s sleep for her. She would be on edge until he got home. She tried waiting up and opened her copy of The House of the Spirits, a book she had reread more times than she could count. Somehow she found it comforting. Something about the stored-up generations of motherhood, the trauma manifested in physical bodies, the brokenness, but also the slow growth and healing that rolled through the Trueba and del Valle families. It made her feel hopeful. She drifted in and out of sleep. Eventually, she slipped into deep sleep, the kind filled with rhythmic breathing and vivid dreams.\n\nShe dreamed that she was wandering the hallways of a big creaky house with heavy curtains and doors. She didn\u2019t recognize the house but seemed to know exactly where to go. She was small again and wore a white nightgown smattered with blue and pink flowers. She was looking for something.\n\nShe found her way to the kitchen and paused outside the closed door. There were voices on the other side and she could see the lights on, glowing underneath. They were cold, blue, like hospital lights, or the kind associated with an alien abduction\u2014not like the lights of the kitchen she knew. The voices she heard sounded sterile. She didn\u2019t want to open the door because she didn\u2019t want anyone to see her, so she peeked through the keyhole and let out a silent scream.\n\nSplayed out on the kitchen table was Nicole\u2019s Ella, though in this strange world she and Ella both looked about five\u2014not possibly mother and daughter. Ella was spread wide like a butchered animal, two men bent over her little body\u2014men rummaging around in her abdomen, poking and prodding with long metal prongs, wringing out her insides like wet paper towels, slicing through her soft belly and cracking open her chest cavity. They whispered and laughed. They seemed to be searching for something inside her, like pearl divers slicing open oyster shells, unbothered by oyster flesh and juice.\n\nElla\u2019s mom could hear every snap and squelch as the men made themselves familiar with Ella\u2019s insides, as if the awful sounds were being broadcast over a loud speaker. Then one of the men pulled out a camera with a big flashbulb on top and started snapping pictures of Ella\u2019s body from all different angles, contorted, bloodied, splayed open, her eyes empty and deep. Every flash lit the room like a burst of lightning, and the snap of the lens made Ella\u2019s mom feel sick\u2014the snap, flash, snap, flash over and over again, like a strobe light.\n\nThis was more than Nicole could bear, and she let out another scream, though this one was not silent. It was loud, desperate to be heard.\n\nSuddenly she was awake, catching the end of her own scream, which had followed her from nightmare into consciousness. For a moment she didn\u2019t know where she was. She was enveloped in dense, still darkness. She felt a small rustle and realized she was in Ella\u2019s room, kneeling beside her bed. She felt her own face, wet with tears; felt her arms and shoulders, her chest, making sure she was in her adult body again.\n\nThen she felt Ella\u2019s arm, gently; her shoulders, her head. She was warm, small and whole, still in her Cinderella nightgown, breathing deeply. Her eyes fluttered open.\n\n\u201cMom, did you have a bad dream?\u201d Ella asked, her voice full of sleep. She stroked her mom\u2019s head gently, the way someone might pet a wild animal or baby bird.\n\n\u201cElla, I did. I had a really bad dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to get in? To help you sleep?\u201d Ella lifted her comforter a bit, showing the wide expanse of unoccupied twin bed to her left.\n\n\u201cFor a little bit. Just until Dad gets home.\u201d Nicole answered, climbing into bed.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The first time I saw her eyes, I was crouched behind the lens of my Leica, adjusting the focus to capture the delicate interplay of light and shadow in the crowded marketplace. It was late afternoon, and the sun cast a golden hue over the scene, deepening the colors of the vendor stalls and the faces of the people drifting through the narrow aisles. I was just a visitor, passing through this small town on my way to nowhere in particular, drawn by the promise of capturing the essence of everyday life in my photographs.\n\nThen I saw her. She stood apart from the bustling crowd, a still figure in a sea of movement. Her dark hair framed a face that seemed both ageless and ancient, and her eyes\u2014those haunting, deep-set eyes\u2014gazed directly into the lens as if she could see through it, into me. They were eyes that spoke of wisdom and sorrow far beyond her years, and I knew in that moment that I had to capture them.\n\nI clicked the shutter once, twice, three times, unable to tear myself away from the intensity of her gaze. It was only when a woman, presumably her mother, hurried over and took her by the hand that I lowered my camera. The woman glanced at me briefly, her expression one of guarded suspicion, before leading the girl away. But those eyes stayed with me, burned into my memory and, more importantly, onto my film.\n\nBack in my small rented room, I developed the photos in the makeshift darkroom I had set up in the bathroom. The image of the girl emerged slowly, the chemicals revealing the stark contrast of her pale face against the dark backdrop of the market. Her eyes, even in black and white, seemed to hold a depth that was almost supernatural. I found myself staring at the photograph long after it had dried, tracing the lines of her face with my finger, lost in the mystery of who she was and what her eyes were trying to tell me.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and I couldn't shake the image of the girl from my mind. I returned to the marketplace every day, hoping to see her again, but she was never there. I asked around, describing her to the vendors and the regulars, but no one seemed to know who she was. It was as if she had appeared out of nowhere, a ghost haunting my thoughts and my art.\n\nMy obsession with the girl began to consume me. I spent hours each night developing and re-developing the same photograph, trying to tease out more details, to understand the story behind those eyes. I started to dream about her, vivid and unsettling dreams where she would appear in different places\u2014standing in the corner of my room, sitting at the edge of my bed, always watching me with that unblinking gaze.\n\nOne night, as I was poring over the photograph yet again, a knock on the door startled me. I opened it to find the girl's mother standing there, her face pale and drawn, her eyes filled with a mixture of fear and desperation.\n\n\"Please,\" she said, her voice trembling. \"You have to stop.\"\n\n\"Stop what?\" I asked, genuinely confused.\n\n\"Taking pictures of my daughter,\" she replied. \"You've been following us, haven't you?\"\n\n\"No, I\u2014\" I began, but she cut me off.\n\n\"I can feel it,\" she said, her voice rising. \"Every night, I see her in my dreams, watched by strangers, dissected by their eyes and their cameras. It's driving me mad. You have to stop.\"\n\nHer words stunned me into silence. I had no idea that my obsession had been affecting her so deeply, that she had been experiencing the same nightmares that plagued me. I wanted to explain, to apologize, but the intensity of her emotion left me speechless.\n\n\"Please,\" she repeated, tears welling up in her eyes. \"Let us be.\"\n\nShe turned and walked away before I could respond, leaving me standing in the doorway, the weight of her words heavy on my shoulders. I closed the door and returned to my darkroom, staring at the photograph of the girl one last time before tucking it away in a drawer.\n\nI didn't go back to the marketplace after that. I packed my things and moved on, hoping to leave the haunting eyes and the nightmares behind. But even now, years later, I can still see her face in my mind, those eyes staring out at me from the depths of my memory, a reminder of the unintended consequences of my obsession.\n\nIn the years that followed, I traveled far and wide, capturing images of people and places, each photograph a testament to the world as I saw it. But no matter how many faces I photographed, none ever held the same power, the same haunting beauty, as the eyes of that young girl in the marketplace.\n\nAs time passed, I found myself returning to that small town, drawn by an inexplicable need to confront the past. The marketplace was still there, much the same as I remembered it, the same vendors selling their wares, the same vibrant energy filling the air. But the girl and her mother were nowhere to be found.\n\nI wandered through the narrow aisles, my camera hanging heavy around my neck, feeling a strange sense of loss and longing. I had hoped that coming back here would bring some sort of closure, but instead, it only deepened the mystery. I felt like a ghost, drifting through a place that no longer held any answers.\n\nIt was late afternoon when I stumbled upon a small photography shop tucked away in a quiet corner of the marketplace. Curious, I stepped inside, the bell above the door tinkling softly. The shop was filled with old cameras and photographs, a treasure trove of memories captured on film.\n\nAs I browsed the shelves, my eyes were drawn to a photograph hanging on the wall. It was a portrait of a young girl, her dark hair framing a face that seemed both ageless and ancient, her eyes\u2014those haunting, deep-set eyes\u2014gazing directly into the camera. My heart skipped a beat as I realized it was the same girl I had photographed all those years ago.\n\nI turned to the shopkeeper, an elderly man with a kind smile and a twinkle in his eye.\n\n\"Who is she?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThe shopkeeper looked at the photograph and then back at me, his smile fading.\n\n\"She was my granddaughter,\" he said softly. \"She passed away many years ago.\"\n\nI felt a lump form in my throat as I processed his words. The girl, the haunting eyes, the nightmares\u2014it all made sense now. She had been trying to tell me something, to reach out from beyond the grave, and I had been too blind to see it.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said, my voice choked with emotion. \"I didn't know.\"\n\nThe shopkeeper nodded, his eyes filled with a sadness that mirrored my own.\n\n\"She was special,\" he said. \"Her eyes saw things that others couldn't. She had a gift, but it also brought her great pain.\"\n\nI felt a deep sense of guilt wash over me, realizing that my obsession with her had only added to that pain. I wanted to make amends, to find some way to honor her memory, but I didn't know how.\n\n\"May I buy the photograph?\" I asked, hoping that having it would bring some measure of closure.\n\nThe shopkeeper shook his head. \"It's not for sale,\" he said gently. \"But you can have it. She would have wanted you to have it.\"\n\nI took the photograph from the wall, feeling its weight in my hands. It was more than just a picture; it was a connection to a past I could never fully understand, a reminder of the consequences of my actions and the haunting beauty of those eyes.\n\nAs I left the shop, I felt a strange sense of peace settle over me. The girl's eyes would always be with me, a silent witness to my journey and a testament to the power of a single moment captured on film. And in that moment, I knew that my obsession had not been in vain. It had led me to a deeper understanding of myself and the world around me, and for that, I was grateful.\n\nI walked through the marketplace one last time, the photograph clutched tightly in my hand. The sun was setting, casting a golden hue over the scene, deepening the colors and the shadows. I raised my camera and took one final picture, capturing the essence of the place that had changed my life forever. And as I did, I felt the weight of the past lift from my shoulders, replaced by a sense of hope and possibility.\n\nIn the end, it was not the photograph of the girl that haunted me, but the lesson she had taught me: that every image, every moment, holds a story waiting to be discovered, and that sometimes, the most powerful stories are the ones that we least expect.",
        "story_b": "In the dim light of his studio, where shadows danced among the equipment and the scent of developing chemicals lingered like a ghost, the photographer stared at the image on his screen. The girl's eyes\u2014two vast pools of midnight\u2014held him captive, their depths whispering secrets and stories that he could not fully grasp. Each click of the shutter had felt like a heartbeat, a pulse that connected him to something beyond the lens, yet as elusive as the flickering light that played over her face.\n\nHe had met her by chance at a local fair, where the air was thick with laughter and the sweet aroma of cotton candy. She had been seated on a carousel horse, her eyes scanning the crowd with a curious, searching gaze that seemed to pierce through the noise. Drawn inexplicably to those eyes, he had asked her mother if he could take a few pictures. The mother, a woman with a weary smile and lavender-scented hair, had hesitated before nodding her consent.\n\nNow, in the quiet solitude of his studio, he found himself returning to that moment, reliving it with an intensity that bordered on obsession. He studied the girl's image, tracing every contour, every shadow, as if trying to unlock some hidden truth within the depths of her stare. Her eyes were windows to a world he could never enter, yet couldn't look away from.\n\nAcross town, the girl's mother lay in bed, surrounded by the comforting scents of lavender and chamomile, yet unable to escape the grip of her nightmares. Every night, the dreams came, uninvited and relentless, leaving her breathless and afraid. In the dark theater of her mind, she saw her daughter ensnared by shadows that crept like silent predators, wrapping around her image with an insidious intent. Strangers watched and dissected her child with eyes that were as cold and unfeeling as the lens of a camera.\n\nShe awoke in a cold sweat, heart pounding with a frantic rhythm that matched the fear coursing through her veins. Her daughter's room was just down the hall, a sanctuary filled with protective symbols\u2014dreamcatchers, soft toys, and the gentle glow of a nightlight that warded off the darkness. Yet the nightmares seeped into her waking hours, casting a pall over her interactions with her daughter, who remained blissfully unaware of the specters that haunted her mother.\n\nThe photographer, meanwhile, found himself consumed by the girl's eyes, their haunting beauty a siren call that echoed in his thoughts. He began to see her eyes everywhere, in the reflections of storefront windows, in the shimmering surface of his morning coffee, in the depths of his own dreams where they loomed larger than life. His fascination grew into a relentless tide, washing over his days and nights, pulling him further into a world he could not comprehend.\n\nHe tried to capture the essence of those eyes in his work, but each attempt left him feeling empty, as if the soul of the image had slipped through his fingers. He wanted to call the mother, to ask for another session, another chance to explore the mystery that had ensnared him. Yet something held him back\u2014a whisper of guilt that warned him of crossing a line he could not see but sensed was there.\n\nThe mother's nightmares intensified, the images more vivid, more terrifying. Her daughter's laughter, once a balm to her soul, now carried an edge of fear, the echoes of her dreams bleeding into reality. She watched her child with a growing sense of unease, as if expecting the shadows to reach out and claim her. The protective symbols in her home offered little comfort against the relentless march of her fears.\n\nOne day, as she watched her daughter play in the garden, the phone rang. It was the photographer, his voice a tentative thread that wove through her anxiety. He spoke of the pictures, of the magic he saw in her daughter's eyes, and asked if he could take more. The request, though innocuous, struck a chord within her, resonating with the echoes of her nightmares. She hesitated, her mind a battlefield of maternal instincts and the shadows of her dreams.\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" she replied, her voice wavering.\n\nHe sensed the uncertainty, the unspoken hesitation, and pressed on, trying to convey the depth of his fascination without revealing the obsession that lurked beneath. \"Her eyes... they're captivating. There's something there, something that I can't quite capture. Please, just one more session.\"\n\nThe mother's grip on the phone tightened, her heart a drumbeat of doubt and fear. The shadows of her nightmares loomed large, whispering warnings of strangers and cold, dissecting eyes. But there was also a part of her that understood the power of capturing a moment, of preserving the essence of her child's innocence.\n\n\"All right,\" she said at last, her voice barely above a whisper. \"But only if I'm there with her.\"\n\nThe photographer agreed, relief flooding through him like a tide. He could hardly wait to see those eyes again, to delve into their depths and perhaps, finally, capture the essence that eluded him. Yet as he prepared for the session, a sliver of unease crept into his thoughts, a feeling that perhaps he was venturing too close to something sacred, something he had no right to claim.\n\nThe day of the session arrived, and the mother watched as the photographer set up his equipment with a meticulous care that bordered on reverence. Her daughter sat patiently, her eyes wide with curiosity, oblivious to the tension that hung in the air. As the photographer began to click away, the mother observed him closely, noting the intensity with which he studied her child, the way his gaze lingered on those haunting eyes.\n\nThe session progressed, each click of the shutter a heartbeat in the silent room. The photographer was lost in the moment, absorbed by the interplay of light and shadow, the way the girl's eyes seemed to draw him into a world he could never fully understand. Yet with each shot, he felt a growing sense of frustration, as if the truth he sought remained just beyond his grasp.\n\nThe mother, too, felt the weight of the session, her nightmares hovering at the edges of her consciousness. She watched her daughter's image flash across the screen, her heart a tumult of love and fear, the shadows of her dreams whispering their insidious warnings. Yet as the session drew to a close, she saw something in the photographer's eyes\u2014a flicker of understanding, a glimpse of the struggle within him.\n\nAs they packed up, the photographer hesitated, his mind a whirlwind of conflicting emotions. He wanted to thank the mother, to express his gratitude for allowing him another glimpse into the world behind her daughter's eyes. Yet he also felt the weight of his obsession, the knowledge that he had crossed a line that perhaps should have remained intact.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said at last, his voice a quiet echo in the room. \"Her eyes... they're extraordinary.\"\n\nThe mother nodded, her own emotions a tangled web of relief and lingering unease. \"They are,\" she agreed, her voice soft. \"But they're just a part of her.\"\n\nHe nodded, understanding more than he had before. The girl's eyes were indeed extraordinary, but they were not the whole of her. They were windows to a world that was both captivating and elusive, a world he could admire but never fully possess.\n\nAs they parted ways, the photographer felt a sense of closure, a release from the grip of his obsession. He had seen the depths of those haunting eyes, had tried to capture their essence, but in the end, he realized that some mysteries were not meant to be unraveled. They were to be cherished, admired from a distance, like the beauty of a star-streaked sky or the fleeting glow of a sunset.\n\nFor the mother, the session marked a turning point in her battle with the nightmares. She saw her daughter's image not as a harbinger of fear, but as a beacon of strength and innocence. The shadows still lurked at the edges of her dreams, but she faced them with renewed resolve, knowing that her love was the strongest shield against the darkness.\n\nIn the quiet of their separate worlds, both the photographer and the mother found a measure of peace. Their paths had crossed in a moment of shared wonder, their lives briefly intertwined by the haunting beauty of a child's eyes. And though they would never meet again, the memory of that shared moment lingered, a testament to the power of connection and the mysteries that bind us all.",

        "ground_truth": "The girl with the purple eyes did not like having her picture taken. She scowled into the camera with alarming intensity.\n\n\u201cSmile,\u201d the photographer said, flashing his own toothy grin.\n\nHer face remained unchanged. No one had asked how she felt being cornered by a stranger, or if she wanted to smile, and scowling was her only means of protest.\n\nThe girl with the purple eyes didn\u2019t actually have purple eyes\u2014that\u2019s just how they looked to her classmates. Really they were deep-blue. The purple came from them being sunken, dark underneath, like a smudged plum or bruises: the combination of inherited memory\u2014generations and generations of purple-eyed women\u2014and many sleepless nights spent coughing, small lungs gasping for air.\n\nShe got her lungs from her father, who had suffered from asthma as well. Growing up, he was thin, probably from the lack of oxygen, breathing in just enough to survive and nothing more. Not enough to thrive or grow or run the way that most boys do, and so he remained small and devoted himself to studying biology and later, medicine. He was different from the other men in his family, and perhaps it was his smallness that made him kind.\n\nThe purple-eyed women on her mother\u2019s side began generations ago. Years of stored fears, doubts, holding of breath so that Dad doesn\u2019t hear you under the bed; the acceptance that even if he doesn\u2019t hear you, he knows exactly where you are; the truth that there is no escape. Small girls\u2019 bodies covered in fingerprints, dealt with harshly, like overworked clay.\n\nIt\u2019s the lack of air that makes for purple eyes, whether it be from fear, asthma, dreams of drowning, or the inherited memory of what\u2019s mine is theirs, especially if what\u2019s mine is feminine and soft\u2014the remembering through mothers and mothers and mothers.\n\nAfter taking her photo, the toothy man, Wes, gave her a nod. While he wished he could\u2019ve coaxed a smile out of this last one, it had been a pretty successful day. Two hours of wrangling a pre-K class into solo photos outside on the playground without a single tantrum or tear shed was success in his book.\n\nWes\u2019s standard of success had changed since his art school days. Back then he spent hours shooting smoke clouds on film, or nude men in black and white. Back then success meant he had been invited onto a shoot with some obscure creative vision or had scored a free drink at a bar, sent over by someone mysterious, attractive, older. He never could have guessed that elementary-class photos would end up paying his bills, or that he would learn how to make four-year-olds smile with his exaggerated facial expressions, almost without fail.\n\nWhen he got home Wes popped a bag of ready-to-steam frozen edamame into the microwave and stared at the photo of that girl, the one with eyes so deep he felt they might fall right into her head.\n\nDamn.\n\nShe was only four or five, with bangs that cut straight across her forehead, her hair pulled back at the nape of her neck into a loose ponytail. She wore a smocked blue cotton dress that popped against her olive skin. It was an eerie photo, and this was one of those rare moments when he looked at his work and remembered what it felt like to be an artist. Suddenly, he was glad she hadn\u2019t smiled. This made for a much better photo. Maybe not something her parents would want to hang on the fridge, but still.\n\n\nNicole pulled up thirty minutes late, screeching to a halt in front of the school. Thirty minutes late meant she would have to retrieve Ella from the office.\n\n\u201cWe have a three-strike system, okay?\u201d said Ms. Smith, the school\u2019s head of administration. She was a petite lady with a southern accent, always wearing a full face of makeup, always in heels. She was someone whom Nicole would have avoided at first glance, but two months into the school year Ms. Smith had proven to be kind, warm-hearted, and welcoming while Ella and her mom learned what it meant to attend St. Ignatius Day School.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fret about it today. I know how hard it can be with traffic and all. It\u2019s just a formality,\u201d she said, handing Ella\u2019s mom a hot-pink \u201ctardy slip.\u201d\n\nDespite Ms. Smith\u2019s reassurance, the hot-pink slip certainly felt like more than just a formality. As she strode down the hall to the office, every teacher she passed stared her down, giving her a disdainful once-over. She folded the piece of paper and shoved it into her purse.\n\nDon\u2019t you care about your child? Are you completely self-absorbed? Don\u2019t you know how traumatizing it is to be forgotten? Think of how this could impact her future.\n\nShe added her own harsh words to their disapproving glances.\n\nQuite honestly, she had forgotten Ella. Well, not forgotten entirely\u2014she had lost track of time. She had been drifting in and out of sleep, and suddenly it was 2:55, leaving her just five minutes to make the almost thirty-minute drive to Ella\u2019s school.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t taken the time to put on something more \u201cadult,\u201d or even more \u201cmom,\u201d and now she walked briskly through the hallway in Ugg slippers and mismatched pajamas.\n\nOn the way home Ella and her mom stopped for Chick-fil-A, a rare indulgence that they decided they had both earned. Ella got a fried-chicken sandwich and a Sprite. She ate about half her sandwich before tucking the rest away in the pocket of the seat in front of her, saving it for later. She took a pull of Sprite through the straw and nodded the way little kids do when they are exceptionally pleased with their choice in beverage.\n\nElla caught her mom\u2019s eye in the rearview mirror and scrunched up her face in a smile.\n\nRelief swept through Nicole\u2019s shoulders and chest. She could almost cry.\n\n\u201cToday a man with very white teeth took our pictures without asking,\u201d Ella said.\n\n\u201cI know, hon. I told you about school pictures today. That\u2019s why you wore your dress, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I forgot,\u201d Ella stated matter-of-factly, taking another swig of Sprite.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Ella. Hey, on our way home I\u2019m going to run into Walgreens, okay? You can stay in the car and finish your Sprite.\u201d\n\nElla nodded.\n\n\nWes grabbed his gym bag from the bench by the door and threw it over his shoulder, digging around in his jacket pocket for his car keys. At thirty-three, he had promised himself that he would never fall victim to that soft, midthirties dad-bod that so many of his friends had grown into, so he worked out often and ate \u201cclean.\u201d Sure, dad-bods were fine for them\u2014most of them settling into complacent, accepting relationships\u2014but he could do better.\n\nOn his way to the gym he stopped by the Walgreens to pick up some Advil, Irish Springs body wash, and a Gatorade Zero. Out of habit he waved at the TV monitor that greeted him, and the tiny mirror image version of him on the monitor waved back.\n\nA woman walked in just as he finished waving, and Wes caught a glimpse of her in the monitor. He was transported. Her eyes were sad, sunken, dark, purple underneath, almost like someone had taken a fist to each of them. It was the second time that day Wes had seen eyes like those. His eyes followed her to the prescription counter, until the rotating display of reading glasses blocked her from view.\n\nThat evening Wes fell asleep on the couch while watching Spencer, his favorite film about Princess Diana. His dreams began with the haunted face of Princess Di as she appeared in the film, played by Kristen Stewart, withering away under the watchful eye of the royal family. Suddenly she was joined by the purple-eyed girl and the purple-eyed woman he had seen earlier that day. The three of them followed him everywhere he went\u2014the gym, the grocery store, the car wash\u2014but in a strange turn of events, he realized that it was he who was following them. He caught their reflections in windows, TV screens, puddles in the street. He stalked them with his camera, like a member of the paparazzi, desperate to get the right angle, the perfect photo. They did not say anything to him or acknowledge that he was there. He followed them all the way to their house in the English countryside, and then he woke up.\n\n\nElla\u2019s dad worked late that night, so Ella and her mom agreed to watch a few episodes of Little Bear while Ella had a breathing treatment. The mask fit over her mouth and nose with a blue elastic strap that went behind her head, like the kind they show you on an airplane \u201cin case of a loss of cabin pressure.\u201d By now Ella was used to the sounds and smells of albuterol being pumped into her lungs and she relaxed into her beanbag chair, watching while Little Bear scooped the moon up into his bucket of water. One hour later, Ella was showered and tucked into bed wearing her polyester blue Cinderella nightgown.\n\n\u201cGoodnight, Ella. Sweet dreams,\u201d her mom said, pulling her door almost to a close.\n\nThen Nicole crawled into her own bed, allowing her feet to stretch as far as they could down into the cool cotton sheets, allowing herself to spread starfish for a moment before turning over onto her left side into a small fetal position.\n\nIt would be a late night for Michael, which meant a less than ideal night\u2019s sleep for her. She would be on edge until he got home. She tried waiting up and opened her copy of The House of the Spirits, a book she had reread more times than she could count. Somehow she found it comforting. Something about the stored-up generations of motherhood, the trauma manifested in physical bodies, the brokenness, but also the slow growth and healing that rolled through the Trueba and del Valle families. It made her feel hopeful. She drifted in and out of sleep. Eventually, she slipped into deep sleep, the kind filled with rhythmic breathing and vivid dreams.\n\nShe dreamed that she was wandering the hallways of a big creaky house with heavy curtains and doors. She didn\u2019t recognize the house but seemed to know exactly where to go. She was small again and wore a white nightgown smattered with blue and pink flowers. She was looking for something.\n\nShe found her way to the kitchen and paused outside the closed door. There were voices on the other side and she could see the lights on, glowing underneath. They were cold, blue, like hospital lights, or the kind associated with an alien abduction\u2014not like the lights of the kitchen she knew. The voices she heard sounded sterile. She didn\u2019t want to open the door because she didn\u2019t want anyone to see her, so she peeked through the keyhole and let out a silent scream.\n\nSplayed out on the kitchen table was Nicole\u2019s Ella, though in this strange world she and Ella both looked about five\u2014not possibly mother and daughter. Ella was spread wide like a butchered animal, two men bent over her little body\u2014men rummaging around in her abdomen, poking and prodding with long metal prongs, wringing out her insides like wet paper towels, slicing through her soft belly and cracking open her chest cavity. They whispered and laughed. They seemed to be searching for something inside her, like pearl divers slicing open oyster shells, unbothered by oyster flesh and juice.\n\nElla\u2019s mom could hear every snap and squelch as the men made themselves familiar with Ella\u2019s insides, as if the awful sounds were being broadcast over a loud speaker. Then one of the men pulled out a camera with a big flashbulb on top and started snapping pictures of Ella\u2019s body from all different angles, contorted, bloodied, splayed open, her eyes empty and deep. Every flash lit the room like a burst of lightning, and the snap of the lens made Ella\u2019s mom feel sick\u2014the snap, flash, snap, flash over and over again, like a strobe light.\n\nThis was more than Nicole could bear, and she let out another scream, though this one was not silent. It was loud, desperate to be heard.\n\nSuddenly she was awake, catching the end of her own scream, which had followed her from nightmare into consciousness. For a moment she didn\u2019t know where she was. She was enveloped in dense, still darkness. She felt a small rustle and realized she was in Ella\u2019s room, kneeling beside her bed. She felt her own face, wet with tears; felt her arms and shoulders, her chest, making sure she was in her adult body again.\n\nThen she felt Ella\u2019s arm, gently; her shoulders, her head. She was warm, small and whole, still in her Cinderella nightgown, breathing deeply. Her eyes fluttered open.\n\n\u201cMom, did you have a bad dream?\u201d Ella asked, her voice full of sleep. She stroked her mom\u2019s head gently, the way someone might pet a wild animal or baby bird.\n\n\u201cElla, I did. I had a really bad dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to get in? To help you sleep?\u201d Ella lifted her comforter a bit, showing the wide expanse of unoccupied twin bed to her left.\n\n\u201cFor a little bit. Just until Dad gets home.\u201d Nicole answered, climbing into bed.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The first time I saw her eyes, I was crouched behind the lens of my Leica, adjusting the focus to capture the delicate interplay of light and shadow in the crowded marketplace. It was late afternoon, and the sun cast a golden hue over the scene, deepening the colors of the vendor stalls and the faces of the people drifting through the narrow aisles. I was just a visitor, passing through this small town on my way to nowhere in particular, drawn by the promise of capturing the essence of everyday life in my photographs.\n\nThen I saw her. She stood apart from the bustling crowd, a still figure in a sea of movement. Her dark hair framed a face that seemed both ageless and ancient, and her eyes\u2014those haunting, deep-set eyes\u2014gazed directly into the lens as if she could see through it, into me. They were eyes that spoke of wisdom and sorrow far beyond her years, and I knew in that moment that I had to capture them.\n\nI clicked the shutter once, twice, three times, unable to tear myself away from the intensity of her gaze. It was only when a woman, presumably her mother, hurried over and took her by the hand that I lowered my camera. The woman glanced at me briefly, her expression one of guarded suspicion, before leading the girl away. But those eyes stayed with me, burned into my memory and, more importantly, onto my film.\n\nBack in my small rented room, I developed the photos in the makeshift darkroom I had set up in the bathroom. The image of the girl emerged slowly, the chemicals revealing the stark contrast of her pale face against the dark backdrop of the market. Her eyes, even in black and white, seemed to hold a depth that was almost supernatural. I found myself staring at the photograph long after it had dried, tracing the lines of her face with my finger, lost in the mystery of who she was and what her eyes were trying to tell me.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and I couldn't shake the image of the girl from my mind. I returned to the marketplace every day, hoping to see her again, but she was never there. I asked around, describing her to the vendors and the regulars, but no one seemed to know who she was. It was as if she had appeared out of nowhere, a ghost haunting my thoughts and my art.\n\nMy obsession with the girl began to consume me. I spent hours each night developing and re-developing the same photograph, trying to tease out more details, to understand the story behind those eyes. I started to dream about her, vivid and unsettling dreams where she would appear in different places\u2014standing in the corner of my room, sitting at the edge of my bed, always watching me with that unblinking gaze.\n\nOne night, as I was poring over the photograph yet again, a knock on the door startled me. I opened it to find the girl's mother standing there, her face pale and drawn, her eyes filled with a mixture of fear and desperation.\n\n\"Please,\" she said, her voice trembling. \"You have to stop.\"\n\n\"Stop what?\" I asked, genuinely confused.\n\n\"Taking pictures of my daughter,\" she replied. \"You've been following us, haven't you?\"\n\n\"No, I\u2014\" I began, but she cut me off.\n\n\"I can feel it,\" she said, her voice rising. \"Every night, I see her in my dreams, watched by strangers, dissected by their eyes and their cameras. It's driving me mad. You have to stop.\"\n\nHer words stunned me into silence. I had no idea that my obsession had been affecting her so deeply, that she had been experiencing the same nightmares that plagued me. I wanted to explain, to apologize, but the intensity of her emotion left me speechless.\n\n\"Please,\" she repeated, tears welling up in her eyes. \"Let us be.\"\n\nShe turned and walked away before I could respond, leaving me standing in the doorway, the weight of her words heavy on my shoulders. I closed the door and returned to my darkroom, staring at the photograph of the girl one last time before tucking it away in a drawer.\n\nI didn't go back to the marketplace after that. I packed my things and moved on, hoping to leave the haunting eyes and the nightmares behind. But even now, years later, I can still see her face in my mind, those eyes staring out at me from the depths of my memory, a reminder of the unintended consequences of my obsession.\n\nIn the years that followed, I traveled far and wide, capturing images of people and places, each photograph a testament to the world as I saw it. But no matter how many faces I photographed, none ever held the same power, the same haunting beauty, as the eyes of that young girl in the marketplace.\n\nAs time passed, I found myself returning to that small town, drawn by an inexplicable need to confront the past. The marketplace was still there, much the same as I remembered it, the same vendors selling their wares, the same vibrant energy filling the air. But the girl and her mother were nowhere to be found.\n\nI wandered through the narrow aisles, my camera hanging heavy around my neck, feeling a strange sense of loss and longing. I had hoped that coming back here would bring some sort of closure, but instead, it only deepened the mystery. I felt like a ghost, drifting through a place that no longer held any answers.\n\nIt was late afternoon when I stumbled upon a small photography shop tucked away in a quiet corner of the marketplace. Curious, I stepped inside, the bell above the door tinkling softly. The shop was filled with old cameras and photographs, a treasure trove of memories captured on film.\n\nAs I browsed the shelves, my eyes were drawn to a photograph hanging on the wall. It was a portrait of a young girl, her dark hair framing a face that seemed both ageless and ancient, her eyes\u2014those haunting, deep-set eyes\u2014gazing directly into the camera. My heart skipped a beat as I realized it was the same girl I had photographed all those years ago.\n\nI turned to the shopkeeper, an elderly man with a kind smile and a twinkle in his eye.\n\n\"Who is she?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThe shopkeeper looked at the photograph and then back at me, his smile fading.\n\n\"She was my granddaughter,\" he said softly. \"She passed away many years ago.\"\n\nI felt a lump form in my throat as I processed his words. The girl, the haunting eyes, the nightmares\u2014it all made sense now. She had been trying to tell me something, to reach out from beyond the grave, and I had been too blind to see it.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said, my voice choked with emotion. \"I didn't know.\"\n\nThe shopkeeper nodded, his eyes filled with a sadness that mirrored my own.\n\n\"She was special,\" he said. \"Her eyes saw things that others couldn't. She had a gift, but it also brought her great pain.\"\n\nI felt a deep sense of guilt wash over me, realizing that my obsession with her had only added to that pain. I wanted to make amends, to find some way to honor her memory, but I didn't know how.\n\n\"May I buy the photograph?\" I asked, hoping that having it would bring some measure of closure.\n\nThe shopkeeper shook his head. \"It's not for sale,\" he said gently. \"But you can have it. She would have wanted you to have it.\"\n\nI took the photograph from the wall, feeling its weight in my hands. It was more than just a picture; it was a connection to a past I could never fully understand, a reminder of the consequences of my actions and the haunting beauty of those eyes.\n\nAs I left the shop, I felt a strange sense of peace settle over me. The girl's eyes would always be with me, a silent witness to my journey and a testament to the power of a single moment captured on film. And in that moment, I knew that my obsession had not been in vain. It had led me to a deeper understanding of myself and the world around me, and for that, I was grateful.\n\nI walked through the marketplace one last time, the photograph clutched tightly in my hand. The sun was setting, casting a golden hue over the scene, deepening the colors and the shadows. I raised my camera and took one final picture, capturing the essence of the place that had changed my life forever. And as I did, I felt the weight of the past lift from my shoulders, replaced by a sense of hope and possibility.\n\nIn the end, it was not the photograph of the girl that haunted me, but the lesson she had taught me: that every image, every moment, holds a story waiting to be discovered, and that sometimes, the most powerful stories are the ones that we least expect.",
        "story_b": "The photograph lay on the table, a silent testament to an obsession that had begun to consume him. The girl's eyes, captured in a fleeting moment of vulnerability, stared back at him, pools of shadow, deep and unknowable, like the depths of a forgotten well. Each click of the shutter had felt like a step deeper into an abyss of obsession, yet he couldn\u2019t look away.\n\nIn the dim light of his cluttered darkroom, the photographer traced the contours of the image, his fingers hovering just above the surface as if afraid to touch it. The room smelled of chemicals and old film, the air thick with the weight of countless images, each vying for attention, yet none as commanding as this. His mind, once a sharp lens focusing solely on the craft, now felt chaotic, spiraling into a fixation that refused to release him.\n\nHe remembered the day vividly. The sun had been setting, casting a warm glow over the park where he often found inspiration. He had been drawn to the laughter of children, the innocence that seemed so fleeting and fragile. That\u2019s when he saw her, the young girl, sitting alone on a bench, her gaze distant, lost in thoughts only she could fathom. There was something about her eyes that called to him, a silent plea or perhaps a challenge, daring him to capture the essence of her soul.\n\n\u201cThose eyes,\u201d he murmured to himself, the phrase echoing in the dim room, a mantra that had become both comfort and torment.\n\nHis memories drifted to other subjects, other haunting images that had once gripped him. There was the old man with eyes like storm clouds, filled with stories untold. The young couple whose gaze held secrets only they shared. Yet none had left a mark as indelible as the girl with the haunting eyes. It was as if, in capturing her, he had also captured a piece of himself, a fragment of his own soul that he had long forgotten.\n\nMeanwhile, across town, the girl's mother tossed in her sleep, caught in the throes of another vivid nightmare. The room was dimly lit, shadows playing across the walls, as if echoing the turmoil within her mind. In her dreams, she saw her daughter, surrounded by strangers, their eyes cold and analytical, dissecting her with their gaze, stripping away her innocence piece by piece. She reached out, trying to protect her, but her hands passed through as if her daughter were nothing more than a ghost.\n\nEach nightmare was the same, a relentless cycle that left her waking in a cold sweat, her heart pounding in her chest. She would sit up, her breath ragged, the silence of the room pressing in on her like a weight. Her daughter slept peacefully down the hall, unaware of the fears that plagued her mother\u2019s mind, of the dark eyes that watched her even in her dreams.\n\nIn the small hours of the morning, she would find herself at her daughter\u2019s door, watching the rise and fall of her chest, assuring herself that she was safe, untouched by the shadows that haunted her sleep. Yet the unease lingered, a persistent whisper that warned of unseen dangers, of eyes that watched from the darkness.\n\nBack in his darkroom, the photographer\u2019s obsession grew. He found himself returning to the photograph, studying every detail, searching for answers to questions he couldn\u2019t fully articulate. Who was she? What stories lay hidden behind those eyes? Each examination only deepened his fascination, driving him to capture more, to seek out other subjects that might offer a glimpse of the same haunting depth.\n\nHe began to see her eyes everywhere. In the reflection of a storefront window, in the rearview mirror of his car, in the faces of strangers who passed him on the street. It was as if the world had become a gallery, each image a reminder of the gaze that had ensnared him.\n\nYet with each new photograph, he felt a growing disquiet, a sense that he was intruding on something sacred, something that wasn\u2019t his to capture. The line between artist and voyeur blurred, leaving him trapped in a labyrinth of his own making, desperate for a way out but unwilling to let go.\n\nThe mother, too, found herself caught in a cycle of fear and uncertainty. She watched her daughter with a new intensity, searching for signs that might explain the nightmares, the sense of foreboding that hung over their lives like a dark cloud. She began to notice small changes, the way her daughter\u2019s gaze would linger on strangers, as if recognizing something familiar in their eyes.\n\nOne afternoon, as they walked through the park, she caught sight of the photographer, his camera raised, capturing the world in frames. Her heart skipped a beat, an inexplicable dread settling over her. She didn\u2019t know him, had never met him, yet something about his presence felt like an echo of her dreams, a shadow that had crossed from her nightmares into reality.\n\nShe tightened her grip on her daughter\u2019s hand, pulling her closer, as if proximity could shield her from the unseen threat. Her daughter glanced up, a question in her eyes, but the mother only smiled, hiding her fear behind a mask of calm.\n\nThe photographer, oblivious to her gaze, continued his work, driven by a compulsion he couldn\u2019t name. He was aware of the world around him only as shapes and shadows, subjects to be captured, moments to be preserved. His focus remained on the girl, the mystery of her eyes, the story they seemed to promise.\n\nAs the days turned into weeks, the mother\u2019s nightmares intensified, each more vivid than the last. She began to dread the night, the darkness that brought with it visions of her daughter\u2019s innocence being stripped away by unseen eyes. She tried to shake the feeling, to convince herself that they were only dreams, but the fear clung to her, a persistent shadow that refused to fade.\n\nThe photographer, too, found himself in a state of unrest. He spent hours in his darkroom, the photograph a constant presence, a reminder of the obsession that had taken hold. He began to question his motives, his right to capture the lives of others, to dissect them with his lens.\n\n\u201cThe photograph was a mirror,\u201d he thought, reflecting not just her image but the haunting echoes of his own soul. It was as if, in capturing her, he had also captured a part of himself, a fragment he had long sought but never found.\n\nYet the answers remained elusive, slipping through his fingers like sand. He was left with only questions, the haunting eyes of the girl his only clue, a puzzle he was desperate to solve.\n\nThe mother, in her dimly lit bedroom, found herself haunted by her own reflections. She saw her daughter\u2019s innocence in every shadow, every corner, and feared the day when it might be taken from her. Her dreams, once a source of comfort, had become a battleground, a place where she fought to protect her child from unseen threats, from eyes that watched and waited.\n\nThe cycle continued, each caught in their own struggle, their paths intertwined by a photograph that had captured more than just a moment. The photographer, in his darkroom, and the mother, in her bedroom, both haunted by the image, by the eyes that held more than they could ever know.\n\nAnd so it began again, the photographer reviewing the photograph, the mother waking from another nightmare, both trapped in a dance of shadows and light, of obsession and fear. Each seeking answers, each finding only more questions, the haunting eyes of the girl a constant reminder of the mysteries that lay just beyond their reach.",

On the phone very early one morning, when he calls, as he has been calling, immediately after the oncologist making rounds in the hospital has examined him.\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\nOn the phone, so that he is spared seeing your face.

Not knowing, at this time, the vast Sahara that lies ahead with all that you cannot bear, that nonetheless will be borne, and by you.\n\nFor always, each step of the way, you resist.\n\nIt is a steep uphill. It is natural to resist. Or, if you accept the steep climb, console yourself with the thought that it is only temporary. The plateau, the flatland to which you\u2019ve been accustomed, awaits you, both of you. You will return there. Soon.\n\nUntil a day, an hour\u2014always there is a day, an hour\u2014when you began to speak of hospice yourself.\n\nAt first, you, too, are shy, faltering. Your throat feels lacerated as if by metal filings.\n\nGradually, you learn to utter the two syllables clearly, bravely\u2014hos-pice.\n\nSoon after that, you begin to say these distinct, deliberate words: \u201cour hospice.\u201d\n\nSoon, you draw up your vows. Quaintly state to yourself, as if to God, a formal decree.\n\nIt is my hope: I will make of our hospice a honeymoon.\n\nMy vow is to make my husband as comfortable as humanly possible.\n\nTo make him happy. To make us both happy.\n\nTo fulfill whatever he wishes that is within the range of possibility.\n\nFirst: a new setting for him. NOT the Cancer Center. Our hospice will be in our home, which he loves.\n\nThe atrium flooded with morning light.\n\nThe foreshortened horizon\u2014for the house is surrounded by trees.\n\nThe flotillas of sculpted clouds.\n\nMy husband can lie on a sofa, staring at the tree line and at the sky.

His fingers, when squeezed, never fail to squeeze in return.\n\nAs his lips, when kissed, never fail to kiss in return.\n\nI will sleep beside my husband holding him in my arms, not strong arms, in fact, rather weak arms, which nonetheless can be made to behave as if they were strong.\n\nI will scatter seed on the redwood deck outside the window. Not ordinary seed but the more expensive \u201cwild bird seed\u201d my husband purchases.\n\nThrilling to watch the birds. Taking the time, undistracted, really watching, for once . . .\n\nAnd my husband loves music! I will bathe him in the most beautiful music through his waking hours. So long as it is not uncomfortable for him, I will lie on the bed beside him, holding him, listening with him to Beethoven\u2019s \u201cOde to Joy,\u201d Rachmaninoff\u2019s \u201cVespers.\u201d\n\n\nFalling asleep with him. Even during the day. Even with wan sunshine slanting through the window onto our faces. Head on the pillow beside his head.\n\nFrom the bookcases in the house, I will select art books, his favorite artists, books from his photography shelves\u2014Bruce Davidson, Edward Weston, Diane Arbus, Eliot Porter. I will turn the pages slowly, marvel with him.\n\nOld albums, family photographs dating back to the early nineteen-hundreds. His family, great-grandparents who emigrated from the Pale. In which he has only recently shown an interest.\n\nHis favorite foods. . . . Well, I will try!\n\nWhen he is at home, possibly his appetite will return. When I am the one to prepare his food, his appetite will return, I am sure.\n\nOf course, family will come to visit. Adult children, grandchildren. Relatives, friends. Colleagues from the university. Neighbors. Old friends from grammar school he hasn\u2019t seen in fifty years. Some surprises for him\u2014I will negotiate with the imagination of a theatre director.\n\nNot merely hospice but our hospice. Not sad but joyous, a honeymoon.\n\nWe will be happy there, in our own home. Both of us.\n\nFor both of us, the \u201cfinal days\u201d will be a honeymoon. I vow.\n\nIn fact, nothing remotely like this will happen. How could you have imagined it would!\n\nHospice, yes. Honeymoon, no.\n\n",
        "story_a": "When the word \"hospice\" is first spoken, it feels like the air itself changes, heavy with finality. The syllables linger in the room, almost visible, as if they have weight and shape, settling over the furniture, the bed, and the person lying in it. Clara hears it and feels an almost imperceptible shift in the universe, a closing door. It\u2019s her mother, Marjorie, who the doctor is addressing, but the word reverberates through Clara\u2019s own heart, a dull thud of inevitability.\n\nMarjorie stares at the doctor with a mix of resignation and defiance, her once-vibrant green eyes now clouded by the long battle with illness. She nods slowly, her lips pressed into a thin line, and then looks away, out the window where a soft autumn rain begins to fall. Clara watches her mother\u2019s profile, the sharp lines softened by the afternoon light, and feels a pang of something she cannot name.\n\nThey return home, the word \"hospice\" now a silent companion that follows them through the days. Clara finds herself moving through the motions of care with an urgency that surprises her. She arranges visits from the nurses, fills out forms, and talks in hushed tones with her mother\u2019s friends, who come bearing casseroles and quiet condolences.\n\nIn the evenings, after the house has settled into its own kind of weary quiet, Clara sits by her mother\u2019s bedside, reading aloud from old favorites\u2014books they had shared during long summer afternoons when she was a child. Marjorie listens with her eyes closed, a faint smile playing at the corners of her mouth, her breath shallow but steady. It is in these moments that Clara feels the weight of loss most acutely, the slow erosion of time slipping through their fingers.\n\nOne evening, as the fire in the hearth crackles and the shadows lengthen, Marjorie opens her eyes and reaches for Clara\u2019s hand. Her touch is light, almost ethereal, and Clara feels a sudden rush of tears she struggles to hold back.\n\n\u201cClara,\u201d Marjorie says softly, her voice barely a whisper. \u201cDo you remember the garden?\u201d\n\nClara nods, unable to speak. The garden had been Marjorie\u2019s sanctuary, a riot of color and life where she had spent countless hours tending to roses, tulips, and wildflowers. It had been Clara\u2019s playground, a place of wonder and discovery, where she had learned the names of plants and the rhythms of nature.\n\n\u201cI want to see it,\u201d Marjorie says, her eyes shining with a faint glimmer of the old spark. \u201cOne last time.\u201d\n\nClara hesitates, the practical part of her mind already listing the reasons why it might be impossible. But then she sees the determination in her mother\u2019s gaze, the unspoken plea, and she nods.\n\nThe next morning, Clara arranges for a wheelchair and blankets, wrapping Marjorie in layers to keep the chill at bay. She pushes her mother through the narrow hallway and out into the garden, where the late autumn sun bathes the world in a golden glow. The air is crisp, filled with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, and Clara feels a strange sense of peace settle over her.\n\nMarjorie breathes in deeply, her eyes scanning the familiar landscape. The garden is past its prime, the flowers wilted and the branches bare, but there is a beauty in the decay, a quiet dignity in the way the world prepares for winter.\n\nClara wheels her mother to the old wooden bench under the maple tree, its leaves a brilliant tapestry of reds and golds. She sits beside her, their hands still entwined, and they watch the world together, the silence between them filled with unspoken memories.\n\nFor a while, they sit in companionable silence, the only sounds the rustling of leaves and the distant chirping of birds. Clara feels a warmth spread through her, a sense of connection that transcends words. It is as if the garden itself is holding them, cradling them in its embrace, offering a kind of solace that she hadn\u2019t realized she needed.\n\nMarjorie turns to her, her eyes filled with a mixture of gratitude and sadness. \u201cThank you, Clara,\u201d she says, her voice trembling. \u201cFor everything.\u201d\n\nClara squeezes her mother\u2019s hand, her own heart aching with the weight of all the things she cannot say. She looks around the garden, taking in the details\u2014the way the sunlight filters through the leaves, the intricate patterns of the spider webs glistening with dew, the gentle sway of the grass in the breeze. It is a moment of clarity, a reminder that even in the face of loss, there is beauty and light.\n\nIn the days that follow, Clara finds herself drawn to the garden more and more. She spends hours there, tending to the plants, raking leaves, and preparing the soil for the winter. It becomes a ritual, a way to connect with her mother\u2019s spirit, to feel her presence in the place she had loved so deeply.\n\nMarjorie\u2019s decline is gradual but inevitable, and Clara feels the weight of each passing day. She continues to read to her mother, to sit by her side, and to hold her hand through the long nights. The word \"hospice\" no longer feels like a sentence but a gentle guide, leading them through the final chapter with grace.\n\nOne crisp morning, as the first frost dusts the garden in a delicate shimmer, Marjorie slips away. Clara is by her side, her hand still entwined with her mother\u2019s, and she feels a profound stillness settle over her. It is a moment of both grief and release, a quiet ending to a life well-lived.\n\nIn the weeks that follow, Clara finds herself returning to the garden, drawn to its quiet resilience. She plants new seeds, tending to them with care, and watches as they begin to sprout, tiny green shoots pushing through the cold earth. It is a reminder of the cycles of life, of the way hope can be found even in the darkest of times.\n\nAnd so, in the space where hope had seemed to vanish, Clara discovers a new kind of light\u2014a gentle, enduring presence that carries her forward, one day at a time. The garden becomes her sanctuary, a place of healing and remembrance, where the memory of her mother lives on in the whisper of the wind and the bloom of every flower.",
        "story_b": "The morning rounds at Saint Miriam\u2019s Hospice began as they always did, with Nurse Emily weaving through the corridors, her steps soft against the linoleum, her voice a gentle murmur in the quietude. The patients awaited her arrival, some with expectant eyes, others with resignation. The word \u201chospice\u201d was a whisper in the air, its presence undeniable, like a shadow that lingered even in the brightest rooms.\n\n\u201cHow are you feeling today?\u201d Emily asked as she entered each room, the question a thread connecting her to those she cared for. It was a ritual, almost sacred in its repetition. For Gerald, the elderly man with thinning hair and eyes that once sparkled with mischief, the response was always the same: \u201cI\u2019m just waiting.\u201d His voice carried the weight of his years, each word heavy with the life he had lived.\n\nIn the room next door, Mrs. Alvarez clutched a faded photograph, her fingers tracing the outlines of her children. \u201cIt\u2019s just hospice,\u201d she would say, her voice barely above a whisper, as if speaking it aloud might make it more real. Her daughter, Ana, sat by her side, her hands restless in her lap. \u201cIs there anything more we can do?\u201d she asked Emily, desperation threading her words. Emily\u2019s reply was steady, practiced: \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can.\u201d\n\nThe routine was comforting in its predictability, yet beneath it simmered a tension, a knowing that each day could bring the unexpected. The hospice was a place of waiting, of moments suspended between hope and acceptance. Emily had learned to navigate this liminal space, her heart attuned to the unspoken needs of her patients.\n\nAs she moved through the building, Emily paused at room seven. Inside, a young woman named Clara lay amidst a sea of white sheets, her breath a fragile thing. Her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, hovered nearby, their faces etched with exhaustion and love. \u201cIt\u2019s just hospice,\u201d Mr. Thompson muttered, his voice thick with finality. Emily offered him a smile, small but sincere, a lighthouse in the fog of their grief.\n\n\u201cHow are you feeling today, Clara?\u201d Emily asked, her voice a gentle coaxing. Clara\u2019s eyes flickered open, a faint smile ghosting across her lips. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said, the words a surprise, even to herself. In that moment, the air shifted, the heaviness lifting ever so slightly, like a curtain drawn back to reveal a sliver of light.\n\nThe words echoed through the hospice, a ripple of change that touched each room. Gerald, upon hearing the news, sat a little straighter in his bed. \u201cReady,\u201d he repeated to himself, the syllables rolling off his tongue like a prayer. Mrs. Alvarez, too, seemed to find solace in the words, her grip on the photograph relaxing as she exhaled a long-held breath. Ana watched her mother, a flicker of understanding passing between them.\n\nEmily continued her rounds, the mantra of \u201cHow are you feeling today?\u201d now carrying a newfound resonance. She lingered in each room, her presence a balm. The word \u201chospice\u201d began to shift, its meaning evolving from a place of finality to one of quiet acceptance. It was still a space where life waned, but now it was also a place where life was honored, each moment cherished.\n\nIn the days that followed, Clara\u2019s words continued to echo, their impact profound. The patients and their families began to see the hospice not as an end, but as a space where love lingered, where memories were woven into the fabric of the walls. The staff noticed the change, too, their interactions with patients and families carrying a gentle warmth, a shared understanding of what it meant to be truly present.\n\nOne afternoon, as the sun dipped low on the horizon, casting long shadows through the hospice windows, Emily found herself sitting with Gerald. They talked of small things: the weather, the birds outside his window, the stories of his youth. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d Gerald said, his voice thoughtful. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m ready, too.\u201d His words were not of resignation, but of peace, a quiet acceptance of what was to come.\n\nIn another room, Mrs. Alvarez and Ana sat in silence, their hands entwined. \u201cIt\u2019s a place of peace,\u201d Ana whispered, her voice a tender caress. Her mother nodded, a soft smile playing on her lips. The photograph lay beside them, a testament to a life well-lived, to love enduring beyond the confines of time.\n\nAs Emily prepared to leave for the day, she paused in the hallway, her heart full. The hospice, with its quiet corridors and rooms filled with stories, had transformed. It was a place where hope had not vanished, but had simply taken on a new form, a gentler light that illuminated the path for those who found themselves within its walls.\n\nThe next morning, as Emily began her rounds, the familiar question fell from her lips with ease. \u201cHow are you feeling today?\u201d she asked, and the responses came, each one a testament to the journey they were all on together. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d they said, or \u201cI\u2019m at peace,\u201d or simply \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nIn the end, it was not about the destination, but the journey, the moments of connection that defined their days. The hospice was still a place of waiting, but now it was also a sanctuary, a haven where love and light intertwined, creating a tapestry of hope and acceptance.\n\nEmily moved from room to room, her heart a quiet drumbeat in the symphony of life that surrounded her. The word \u201chospice\u201d had become something more, a place not of endings, but of beginnings, each day a new chapter in the story of those who found themselves within its embrace.",

        "story_a": "When the word \"hospice\" is first spoken, it feels like the air itself changes, heavy with finality. The syllables linger in the room, almost visible, as if they have weight and shape, settling over the furniture, the bed, and the person lying in it. Clara hears it and feels an almost imperceptible shift in the universe, a closing door. It\u2019s her mother, Marjorie, who the doctor is addressing, but the word reverberates through Clara\u2019s own heart, a dull thud of inevitability.\n\nMarjorie stares at the doctor with a mix of resignation and defiance, her once-vibrant green eyes now clouded by the long battle with illness. She nods slowly, her lips pressed into a thin line, and then looks away, out the window where a soft autumn rain begins to fall. Clara watches her mother\u2019s profile, the sharp lines softened by the afternoon light, and feels a pang of something she cannot name.\n\nThey return home, the word \"hospice\" now a silent companion that follows them through the days. Clara finds herself moving through the motions of care with an urgency that surprises her. She arranges visits from the nurses, fills out forms, and talks in hushed tones with her mother\u2019s friends, who come bearing casseroles and quiet condolences.\n\nIn the evenings, after the house has settled into its own kind of weary quiet, Clara sits by her mother\u2019s bedside, reading aloud from old favorites\u2014books they had shared during long summer afternoons when she was a child. Marjorie listens with her eyes closed, a faint smile playing at the corners of her mouth, her breath shallow but steady. It is in these moments that Clara feels the weight of loss most acutely, the slow erosion of time slipping through their fingers.\n\nOne evening, as the fire in the hearth crackles and the shadows lengthen, Marjorie opens her eyes and reaches for Clara\u2019s hand. Her touch is light, almost ethereal, and Clara feels a sudden rush of tears she struggles to hold back.\n\n\u201cClara,\u201d Marjorie says softly, her voice barely a whisper. \u201cDo you remember the garden?\u201d\n\nClara nods, unable to speak. The garden had been Marjorie\u2019s sanctuary, a riot of color and life where she had spent countless hours tending to roses, tulips, and wildflowers. It had been Clara\u2019s playground, a place of wonder and discovery, where she had learned the names of plants and the rhythms of nature.\n\n\u201cI want to see it,\u201d Marjorie says, her eyes shining with a faint glimmer of the old spark. \u201cOne last time.\u201d\n\nClara hesitates, the practical part of her mind already listing the reasons why it might be impossible. But then she sees the determination in her mother\u2019s gaze, the unspoken plea, and she nods.\n\nThe next morning, Clara arranges for a wheelchair and blankets, wrapping Marjorie in layers to keep the chill at bay. She pushes her mother through the narrow hallway and out into the garden, where the late autumn sun bathes the world in a golden glow. The air is crisp, filled with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, and Clara feels a strange sense of peace settle over her.\n\nMarjorie breathes in deeply, her eyes scanning the familiar landscape. The garden is past its prime, the flowers wilted and the branches bare, but there is a beauty in the decay, a quiet dignity in the way the world prepares for winter.\n\nClara wheels her mother to the old wooden bench under the maple tree, its leaves a brilliant tapestry of reds and golds. She sits beside her, their hands still entwined, and they watch the world together, the silence between them filled with unspoken memories.\n\nFor a while, they sit in companionable silence, the only sounds the rustling of leaves and the distant chirping of birds. Clara feels a warmth spread through her, a sense of connection that transcends words. It is as if the garden itself is holding them, cradling them in its embrace, offering a kind of solace that she hadn\u2019t realized she needed.\n\nMarjorie turns to her, her eyes filled with a mixture of gratitude and sadness. \u201cThank you, Clara,\u201d she says, her voice trembling. \u201cFor everything.\u201d\n\nClara squeezes her mother\u2019s hand, her own heart aching with the weight of all the things she cannot say. She looks around the garden, taking in the details\u2014the way the sunlight filters through the leaves, the intricate patterns of the spider webs glistening with dew, the gentle sway of the grass in the breeze. It is a moment of clarity, a reminder that even in the face of loss, there is beauty and light.\n\nIn the days that follow, Clara finds herself drawn to the garden more and more. She spends hours there, tending to the plants, raking leaves, and preparing the soil for the winter. It becomes a ritual, a way to connect with her mother\u2019s spirit, to feel her presence in the place she had loved so deeply.\n\nMarjorie\u2019s decline is gradual but inevitable, and Clara feels the weight of each passing day. She continues to read to her mother, to sit by her side, and to hold her hand through the long nights. The word \"hospice\" no longer feels like a sentence but a gentle guide, leading them through the final chapter with grace.\n\nOne crisp morning, as the first frost dusts the garden in a delicate shimmer, Marjorie slips away. Clara is by her side, her hand still entwined with her mother\u2019s, and she feels a profound stillness settle over her. It is a moment of both grief and release, a quiet ending to a life well-lived.\n\nIn the weeks that follow, Clara finds herself returning to the garden, drawn to its quiet resilience. She plants new seeds, tending to them with care, and watches as they begin to sprout, tiny green shoots pushing through the cold earth. It is a reminder of the cycles of life, of the way hope can be found even in the darkest of times.\n\nAnd so, in the space where hope had seemed to vanish, Clara discovers a new kind of light\u2014a gentle, enduring presence that carries her forward, one day at a time. The garden becomes her sanctuary, a place of healing and remembrance, where the memory of her mother lives on in the whisper of the wind and the bloom of every flower.",
        "story_b": "\u201cHospice.\u201d The doctor\u2019s voice was soft, yet the word cut through the room like a chisel. Everyone stopped, the air itself seemed to halt, heavy with an unspoken understanding. The family sat in a semicircle, their expressions shifting from disbelief to acceptance, and then, slowly, settling into a quiet resolve. Mary, who had been dabbing her eyes with a tissue, felt the weight of the word settle in her chest, anchoring her to her chair.\n\nThe room, a small, sunlit corner of the hospital, suddenly felt suffocating. Outside, the world continued with its oblivious bustle, but inside, time seemed to pause. It was Mary\u2019s father, Harold, who broke the silence first. His voice was unexpectedly steady. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI suppose that\u2019s that, then.\u201d But his eyes, usually so sharp and mischievous, were now clouded with a mixture of fear and acceptance.\n\nThe doctor, a kind-faced woman with gentle hands and a calm demeanor, nodded. \u201cThere\u2019s still time, Mr. Thompson. Time for moments that matter. Hospice isn\u2019t the end; it\u2019s about the quality of life.\u201d\n\nMary wanted to believe her. She looked around the room, at her brothers who sat stoically, and her mother, who seemed to shrink into herself. The air was thick, but as the doctor spoke, Mary noticed a thin beam of sunlight filtering through the window, dust particles dancing in its glow. It was a gentle reminder that light could pierce even the heaviest of shadows.\n\nIn the days that followed, Mary found herself returning to that image, the sunlight breaking through. The hospice center, where her father was moved, was a place of serene acceptance. The corridors were quiet, filled with the soft hum of medical equipment, and the gentle rustle of curtains as they swayed with each passing breeze. There was a garden outside, vibrant with autumn colors, where Mary often found solace.\n\nHer father, despite the circumstances, retained his dry humor. \u201cLooks like I\u2019ve got a one-way ticket,\u201d he joked one afternoon, winking at Mary. She chuckled, albeit with tears in her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare make that your stand-up routine,\u201d she replied, her voice catching in her throat.\n\nThe nurses were a balm to her frayed nerves. One in particular, Nurse Jill, seemed to have a knack for lightening the atmosphere. She would come in with a story or a joke, her laughter bright and contagious. \u201cWhy did the scarecrow win an award?\u201d she asked one day, as she adjusted Harold\u2019s pillows. \u201cBecause he was outstanding in his field!\u201d Even Harold, who had heard it before, couldn\u2019t help but smile.\n\nMary marveled at how these small acts of kindness, these moments of levity, could lift the weight that had settled over them. The hospice was not just a place of endings, but also of unexpected beginnings\u2014connections and reflections that might never have happened otherwise.\n\nOne afternoon, as Mary sat by her father\u2019s bedside, he turned to her, his eyes clear and focused. \u201cDo you remember the summer we built that treehouse?\u201d he asked suddenly. Mary nodded, a smile tugging at her lips. \u201cYou insisted on painting it bright blue,\u201d she recalled. \u201cSaid it would match the sky.\u201d\n\nHarold chuckled, a soft, rasping sound. \u201cIt was the most crooked thing I ever built, but you loved it anyway.\u201d They sat in silence for a moment, the memory wrapping around them like a warm blanket. Outside, the garden shimmered in the late afternoon sun, the colors vivid and alive.\n\nAs the days passed, Mary found herself drawn to the garden more often. It was here that she encountered a scene that seemed almost magical. A patient, an elderly woman with silver hair, sat in her wheelchair, eyes closed, a serene smile on her lips. Around her, in her mind\u2019s eye, the garden transformed into a vibrant tapestry of colors and sounds. She imagined it alive with laughter and the voices of loved ones long gone.\n\nMary watched, entranced, as the woman\u2019s face lit up with an inner joy, untouched by the shadows of her surroundings. It was a moment that seemed to transcend reality, a reminder that even in the face of finality, there could be beauty and light.\n\nInspired, Mary began to bring small tokens of brightness into her father\u2019s room. She placed fresh flowers on the windowsill, their colors bright against the stark white of the walls. She brought books filled with his favorite stories, reading to him in the quiet hours of the afternoon. And always, there was music\u2014soft, soothing melodies that filled the room with warmth.\n\nHer father, too, found solace in these simple pleasures. He would listen intently as Mary read, his eyes closed, a faint smile on his lips. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d find peace here,\u201d he admitted one evening, \u201cbut somehow, I do.\u201d His words were a balm to Mary\u2019s aching heart, a testament to the power of light in the darkest of times.\n\nAs the days turned to weeks, the weight of the initial word\u2014hospice\u2014began to lift, replaced by a gentle acceptance. Mary learned to cherish the moments, the laughter, and even the tears, for they were a testament to the life her father had lived.\n\nOn a crisp autumn morning, as the leaves danced in the breeze outside the window, Harold took his last breath. The room was filled with a profound stillness, yet there was also a sense of peace. Mary sat beside him, holding his hand, feeling the warmth of the sun on her face. She knew, in that moment, that the light had not vanished but had simply transformed, leaving behind a glow that would guide her in the days to come.\n\nIn the quiet aftermath, as Mary stepped into the garden, she understood that hope was not a fleeting thing. It was a constant, like the sunlight that broke through the clouds, a gentle reminder that even in the shadow of loss, life continued in all its beauty and complexity.",

        "ground_truth": "\u201cHospice.\u201d\n\nOnce the word is uttered aloud, there is a seismic shift. You will feel it.\n\n\nLike a (very short) thread through the eye of a needle, swiftly in and swiftly out.\n\nThe air itself becomes thin, steely.\n\nAt the periphery of your vision, an immediate dimming. The penumbra begins to shrink. In time, it will become a tunnel. Ever diminishing. Until the remaining light is small enough to be cupped in two hands. And then it will be extinguished.\n\nFor when \u201chospice\u201d is spoken, the fact is at last acknowledged: There is no hope.\n\nNo hope. These words are obscene, unspeakable. To be without hope is to be without a future.\n\nWorse, by acknowledging that you are without a future, you have \u201cgiven up.\u201d\n\nAnd so when the word \u201chospice\u201d is first spoken\u2014carefully, cautiously, by a (female) palliative-care physician\u2014neither of you hears it. Or, if you hear it, you don\u2019t register that you have heard.\n\nA low-grade buzzing in the ears, a ringing, as of a distant alarm, an alarm in a shuttered room. That is all.\n\nFor if you don\u2019t hear, perhaps it has not (yet) been uttered.\n\nFor if neither of you hears, perhaps it will not (ever) be uttered.\n\nYet somehow it happens: \u201chospice\u201d comes to be more frequently spoken as the days pass.\n\nAnd somehow it happens that your husband, surprising himself, begins to speak of his \u201cfinal days.\u201d As in, \u201cI think these might be my final days.\u201d\n\nAs if shyly. On the phone very early one morning, when he calls, as he has been calling, immediately after the oncologist making rounds in the hospital has examined him.\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\nOn the phone, so that he is spared seeing your face. And you, his.\n\nA new shyness like the first, initial shyness. Finding some way to say I love you.\n\nFor some, an impossible statement\u2014I love you.\n\nBut your husband managed it, and you managed it, somehow: I love you.\n\nAnd now, years later, it is \u201cI think these might be my final days.\u201d\n\nThese words you hear over the phone distinctly, irrevocably, yet (you would claim) you have not heard them. No!\n\nBut, yes, you\u2019ve heard. Must have heard. For the walls of the room reel giddily around you, blood rushes out of your head, leaving you faint, sinking to your knees like a terrified child, stammering, \u201cWhat? What are you saying? That\u2019s ridiculous. Don\u2019t say such things! What on earth do you mean\u2014\u2018final days\u2019?\u201d\n\nYour voice rises wildly. You want to fling the cell phone from you.\n\nFor you can\u2019t bear it. You don\u2019t think so. Not knowing, at this time, the vast Sahara that lies ahead with all that you cannot bear, that nonetheless will be borne, and by you.\n\nFor always, each step of the way, you resist.\n\nIt is a steep uphill. It is natural to resist. Or, if you accept the steep climb, console yourself with the thought that it is only temporary. The plateau, the flatland to which you\u2019ve been accustomed, awaits you, both of you. You will return there. Soon.\n\nUntil a day, an hour\u2014always there is a day, an hour\u2014when you began to speak of hospice yourself.\n\nAt first, you, too, are shy, faltering. Your throat feels lacerated as if by metal filings.\n\nGradually, you learn to utter the two syllables clearly, bravely\u2014hos-pice.\n\nSoon after that, you begin to say these distinct, deliberate words: \u201cour hospice.\u201d\n\nSoon, you draw up your vows. Quaintly state to yourself, as if to God, a formal decree.\n\nIt is my hope: I will make of our hospice a honeymoon.\n\nMy vow is to make my husband as comfortable as humanly possible.\n\nTo make him happy. To make us both happy.\n\nTo fulfill whatever he wishes that is within the range of possibility.\n\nFirst: a new setting for him. NOT the Cancer Center. Our hospice will be in our home, which he loves.\n\nThe atrium flooded with morning light.\n\nThe foreshortened horizon\u2014for the house is surrounded by trees.\n\nThe flotillas of sculpted clouds.\n\nMy husband can lie on a sofa, staring at the tree line and at the sky. Comfortable on the sofa with pillows behind him and feet (in warm socks) elevated.\n\nOr, more likely, he can lie on a (rented) hospital bed, positioned in such a way that he can easily gaze out the window. And I can lie beside him, as I have done in the hospital.\n\nHolding hands. Of course, we will hold hands. His hands are still warm\u2014strong. His fingers, when squeezed, never fail to squeeze in return.\n\nAs his lips, when kissed, never fail to kiss in return.\n\nI will sleep beside my husband holding him in my arms, not strong arms, in fact, rather weak arms, which nonetheless can be made to behave as if they were strong.\n\nI will scatter seed on the redwood deck outside the window. Not ordinary seed but the more expensive \u201cwild bird seed\u201d my husband purchases.\n\nThrilling to watch the birds. Taking the time, undistracted, really watching, for once . . .\n\nAnd my husband loves music! I will bathe him in the most beautiful music through his waking hours. So long as it is not uncomfortable for him, I will lie on the bed beside him, holding him, listening with him to Beethoven\u2019s \u201cOde to Joy,\u201d Rachmaninoff\u2019s \u201cVespers.\u201d\n\n\nFalling asleep with him. Even during the day. Even with wan sunshine slanting through the window onto our faces. Head on the pillow beside his head.\n\nFrom the bookcases in the house, I will select art books, his favorite artists, books from his photography shelves\u2014Bruce Davidson, Edward Weston, Diane Arbus, Eliot Porter.

        "story_b": "In the hospice, days unfolded like pages in a tattered book, worn at the edges from the repeated turning of chapters that promised little change. The air, thick with antiseptic and whispered regrets, shifted subtly the first time the word \"hospice\" was spoken, as if the walls themselves absorbed its weight, bowing slightly inward, holding secrets of both despair and quiet resolve.\n\nAnother day, another round. Nurse Evelyn moved through the corridors with the practiced grace of one who had long since learned to navigate the tightrope of empathy and detachment. The hospice was a place of transitions, and she had witnessed many\u2014a last breath, a reconciliatory embrace, a tearful goodbye. Each room held its own story, and Evelyn was part keeper, part witness.\n\n\"How are we feeling today?\" she asked in a soft, rhythmic cadence as she entered Room 4, where Mr. Harper lay, his form barely disturbing the white expanse of the bed. His eyes, clouded with resignation yet flickering with a stubborn spark of hope, met hers. They had their routine, Mr. Harper and Evelyn. Each morning, she would ask, and each morning he would respond with the same wry smile, \"Still here.\"\n\nMr. Harper's son, David, visited every Sunday, his presence a reluctant duty wrapped in love and regret. He sat by the window, staring out at the garden that stretched beyond the glass, vibrant even in winter, as if mocking the sterility within. Evelyn had seen him there many times, his profile etched with a quiet determination, struggling to find words that wouldn\u2019t come.\n\nThe misunderstanding began with a silence\u2014Mr. Harper's silence. It was the previous Sunday when David, in a moment of frustration, had pleaded, \"Dad, do you want me to make arrangements? Is this what you want?\" And in the heavy quiet that followed, he had taken the silence as consent, as acceptance.\n\nBut Evelyn knew better. That evening, as she tidied the room, she found the letter\u2014hidden beneath a stack of well-worn books, its envelope yellowed with age. Inside, Mr. Harper had scrawled his desires, his fears, and his love in a shaky hand. \"I want to see the ocean again,\" it read. \"I want to feel the sand, hear the waves. I want to remember how it was to live.\"\n\nThe discovery of the letter became a turning point\u2014a moment when the routine shattered, revealing raw, unspoken truths. Evelyn held the letter in her hand, its weight surprisingly light yet burdened with Mr. Harper's unfulfilled dreams. She knew she had to act, to bring light into a place where hope seemed to have vanished.\n\nThe next Sunday, David arrived, his expression a mask of weary expectation. Evelyn approached him gently, the letter carefully tucked into her pocket. \"David,\" she began, \"there's something you should see.\" She led him to a quiet room where they could talk undisturbed.\n\nAs David unfolded the letter, his face transformed, the mask slipping away to reveal a mixture of shock and sorrow. \"I didn\u2019t know,\" he whispered, his voice cracking. \"I thought he had given up.\"\n\nEvelyn placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder. \"He hasn't,\" she said softly. \"There's still time.\"\n\nTogether, they devised a plan\u2014a final journey, a chance to fulfill Mr. Harper's wish. It was risky, perhaps even foolish, but David was resolute. Hope, once a distant memory, began to take shape, fragile yet persistent.\n\nOn a chilly morning, under a sky that promised rain, Evelyn and David wheeled Mr. Harper through the hospice doors, his frail body bundled in blankets. He watched the world unfold around him with a childlike wonder, his eyes wide with anticipation. The drive to the coast was long, the hours passing in a blur of conversation and silence, punctuated by the hum of the engine and the rhythmic beat of the windshield wipers.\n\nWhen they arrived, the sea stretched before them, vast and endless, its waves crashing against the shore with a ferocity that seemed to echo Mr. Harper's own struggle. David lifted his father from the wheelchair, supporting him as they made their way to the water's edge. Mr. Harper's feet sank into the sand, the grains cool and familiar.\n\nEvelyn watched from a distance, her heart swelling with an unfamiliar warmth. It was a rare moment of triumph, a reminder that even in places shrouded in darkness, light could be found.\n\nMr. Harper stood at the edge of the world, the ocean before him a testament to life\u2019s enduring beauty. The wind whipped through his hair, and he laughed\u2014a sound so full of joy that it startled even him. He turned to David, his eyes brimming with gratitude. \"Thank you,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"For everything.\"\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the water, Evelyn knew they had created something extraordinary\u2014a memory that would linger long after Mr. Harper was gone. In that moment, hope was not just an abstract concept but a tangible force, binding them together in a shared understanding of life's fragility and its fleeting joys.\n\nReturning to the hospice, the journey felt different. The routine would resume, the rounds and the questions, the quiet moments and the unsaid goodbyes. But something had changed. The air, once heavy with finality, now held a promise\u2014a whisper of hope, stubborn and enduring.\n\nIn the days that followed, Mr. Harper's condition worsened, the inevitable march of time relentless. Yet there was a peace about him, a contentment that had not been there before. He spoke often of the ocean, of the waves and the sand, recounting the experience to anyone who would listen.\n\nEvelyn continued her rounds, her presence a constant in the ever-changing landscape of the hospice. She learned to see the light in unexpected places\u2014a shared smile, a gentle touch, a moment of connection. In the hospice, where hope seemed to have vanished, she had discovered that it was never truly gone, only waiting to be rekindled.\n\nThe day Mr. Harper passed, the sky was overcast, the garden outside a riot of colors. David was there, holding his father's hand, the letter tucked safely in his pocket. Evelyn stood quietly at the door, her heart heavy yet uplifted, knowing they had done everything they could. In the hospice, where life and death danced closely together, light had found a way to shine through.",

You know...despite its hardships -deadly mutants trying to kill you, rival scavenger gangs trying to kill you, the Spice trying to kill you- it could be a *very* beautiful place during a sunset. The way the sun sinks beneath the horizon as you look out into the desert. The way the Spice in the air gives the orange and purple-tinted sky almost a....*magical* feeling! The mutant coyotes, somewhere in the distance, gently howling the song of their people. Sometimes, the sunset gets so peaceful and quiet that one would almost...forget...that they were in the Wasteland, where everything, even the sand itself, tries to kill you. Ah...the simple beauty in life... NOPE. **ACID RAIN.** Almost twice a year did it ever rain in West Virginia. And today was one of those days! And if you thought that rain in the Wasteland was anything like rain nearly 200 years ago, boy were you mistaken! The rain was...*acid rain*. Real...acid rain. Acid rain that if you dared to stick your naked, unprotected head under it, you were walking away without hair. And if you dared to look *up* or -Spice forbid- try to catch the *acid raindrops* onto your tongue, you're...basically walking away looking like the Joker. And where was our newly-formed, green in the gills, positively *itching* to start their pirate adventure, crew right now?? Bus stop. Thankfully the buildings, any coverings, and the bus stops, were made with lead (because *that* was safe!) to withstand the acid! So that's where the crew was. All stuffed into a smallish, lead-topped, glass-walled, graffiti'd, bus stop. Some sat on the grimy bench, others stood around or sat on the floor where the acid rain couldn't reach them. Their fearless captain, Petey Flynn, sat back, legs stretched out in front of him, on the far side of the bench. Next to his first mate, Voodood. Petey sighed and reached into his pocket, taking out a *centuries-old*, small, Nokia phone, in more or less pristine condition. He dialed a number and put it up to his ear. It picked up after a few rings. \"Heeeyyyy Genie-Bean!\", Petey crooned over the sounds of acid rain into the phone. \"Peter. Pinkie-Pie. Flynn.\", came, expectantly, from the other end of the line. And then Gina silently waited for the rest. It had only been a *week* since Petey set out on his 'Portal Gun pirate adventure', and has somehow, in one week, acquired a crew. They were set to depart *today morning*. So the fact that he was calling her could not *possibly* mean anything good. \"Soooo.....\", Petey continued after a glance over at Voodood, and then the rest of his crew,\"....we kiiiiinda....sorta.....*lost* the ship.\" \"YOU WHA--\" \"--It's okay! It's okay!\", Petey sat up, \"We *know* where it is! Or or...rather *who has it*! And it's....it's *Buster*. The Hermit Crabs took our ship. --Stole! *Stole* our ship.\" The *longest*, most drawn out sigh came from Gina's side of the line. \"Your....*pirate ship*...\", she clarified, \"....was....*pirated*...by the Hermit Crabs?\" \"Yeeahhhh. I mean if you really think about it, it was *such* a funny stor--\" **CLICK.** Petey blinked down at the phone. She hung up. He turned to rest of his crew, surprisingly *very* nonchalant about the whole thing. And gave them a shrug, sitting back once again. \"It's okay guys, she'll call back! I'm sure she's comin' up with a *plan* for us as we speak!\", he paused to look at each and every person at that bus stop, \"...Man, can you *believe* it's already been a week since we all met? Feels like *just yesterday* Dood saved me from that other time the Crabs jumped me....\" Seeming to quite literally be content with waiting for his sister to *maybe* call him back with a plan, Petey's eyes glazed over with recollection of that week during which they all met.",
        "story_a": "The sky wept with a venomous deluge, each raindrop hissing as it struck the cracked pavement. The acrid scent of burning chemicals permeated the air, mingling with the earthy odor of damp concrete. A cacophony of pattering rain and distant thunder reverberated through the graffiti-covered bus stop, where the remnants of the notorious pirate crew, the Storm Serpents, huddled together in a tenuous sanctuary.\n\nCaptain Sable, a woman whose commanding presence belied her petite stature, stood at the edge of the shelter, her dark eyes scanning the horizon with a mixture of fury and desperation. Her once pristine tricorn hat now drooped miserably, dripping with the noxious rain. She clenched a weathered Nokia phone in one hand, its ancient keypad slick with moisture. The screen glowed dimly, casting an eerie light on her determined face.\n\n\"We can\u2019t stay here forever,\" growled Flint, the burly first mate whose scarred visage looked even more menacing in the flickering light. He shifted restlessly, his broad shoulders barely fitting beneath the narrow awning. \"The Hermit Crabs have our ship. And if we don\u2019t act fast, they\u2019ll strip her down to the bones.\"\n\nAround them, the rest of the crew murmured in uneasy agreement. There was Marlowe, the lithe navigator with a penchant for getting lost in his own thoughts, and Lila, the sharp-tongued quartermaster whose quick wit was second only to her lethal aim. And then there was Jinx, the youngest and unluckiest of the lot, whose very presence seemed to attract misfortune like iron filings to a magnet.\n\nJinx shuffled his feet nervously, glancing up at the sky as if expecting it to rain fire next. \"But how do we even start looking for them?\" he asked, his voice trembling. \"We don\u2019t have any weapons, no transport, and that phone\u2019s older than dirt.\"\n\nCaptain Sable\u2019s grip tightened on the Nokia. \"This phone,\" she said, her voice steely, \"is our only lifeline. And we\u2019re going to use it to call in a favor.\"\n\nLila raised an eyebrow, her skepticism evident. \"A favor? From who? Most of our so-called friends would sooner slit our throats than help us.\"\n\nSable\u2019s lips curled into a tight smile. \"Not this one. There\u2019s a fence named Rook who owes me. Big time. If anyone knows the Hermit Crabs\u2019 movements, it\u2019s him.\"\n\nThe crew exchanged glances, a spark of hope igniting in their eyes. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was a start. Sable dialed the number with practiced fingers, the tone ringing out like a beacon in the storm. After an agonizing pause, the call connected.\n\n\"Sable,\" a gravelly voice answered, laced with suspicion. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Rook, I need information,\" Sable replied, her tone brooking no argument. \"The Hermit Crabs stole our ship. Where are they headed?\"\n\nThere was a rustle of papers, a muffled curse. \"You\u2019re in luck,\" Rook said grudgingly. \"They\u2019ve been laying low in the old shipyard by the docks. But you didn\u2019t hear it from me.\"\n\nSable ended the call, her eyes gleaming with renewed determination. \"To the docks, then,\" she declared. \"We\u2019ll take back what\u2019s ours.\"\n\nThe crew nodded, a newfound resolve settling over them. The acid rain continued to pour, but it couldn\u2019t extinguish the fire in their hearts. They moved as one, leaving the dilapidated bus stop behind, their silhouettes merging with the shadows of the storm.\n\nThe journey to the docks was fraught with peril. The city was a labyrinth of crumbling buildings and deserted streets, each step echoing with the threat of danger. But the Storm Serpents pressed on, driven by the promise of reclaiming their stolen ship.\n\nAs they neared the shipyard, Flint\u2019s keen eyes spotted movement. \"There,\" he whispered, pointing to a cluster of figures skulking around the rusted hulls. The Hermit Crabs, oblivious to their approach.\n\nSable signaled for silence, her mind racing with a plan. They had the element of surprise, and with it, a chance to turn the tide. \"On my mark,\" she breathed, her voice barely audible over the storm.\n\nThe crew tensed, every muscle coiled and ready. The moment stretched, the air thick with anticipation. And then, with a fierce cry, Sable led the charge, her crew following close behind.\n\nThe battle was swift and brutal, a clash of wills and desperation. The Hermit Crabs, caught off guard, fell back under the relentless assault. Sable\u2019s crew fought with the ferocity of those with nothing left to lose, reclaiming their ship inch by hard-fought inch.\n\nWhen the dust finally settled, the Storm Serpents stood victorious, their ship once more beneath their feet. The rain had begun to let up, the sky lightening with the promise of a new dawn. Sable looked around at her crew, battered but unbroken, and allowed herself a rare smile.\n\n\"Our adventure begins anew,\" she said, her voice ringing with triumph. \"Let\u2019s set sail.\"",
        "story_b": "\"Ain't no storm like an acid rainstorm to test a pirate's mettle, or so they say,\" Captain Barnacle grumbled, tugging the brim of his sodden hat down over his eyes. Around him, his crew of misfits huddled beneath the scant shelter of a graffiti-covered bus stop, trying vainly to dodge raindrops like cannonballs. The vibrant graffiti, depicting sea monsters and treasure maps, seemed to mock their current landlocked predicament.\n\n\"Blimey, this ain't no place for a pirate!\" wailed Salty Pete, the crew\u2019s grizzled navigator, who was futilely attempting to use his trusty sextant to chart a course through the rain. Each drop splattered off the brass device, and Pete squinted into the storm with a look of grim determination.\n\nNext to him, Mad Mabel, the ship\u2019s cook, was optimistically holding a pot out into the downpour. \"Soup\u2019s on, lads!\" she chirped, her apron now a soggy mess. \"Who knew acid rain could sting worse than a jellyfish?\"\n\nThe rest of the crew shuffled around, trying to keep spirits high despite their soggy situation. Meanwhile, Captain Barnacle paced, his boots sloshing in the growing puddle beneath the shelter. \"Where's me ship?\" he barked, glaring at the distant harbor now shrouded in a misty veil of rain. \"Who could\u2019ve made off with the Barnacle Beauty?\"\n\nIt was then that One-Eyed Jack, the lookout, pulled from his pocket an artifact of the modern age\u2014a Nokia phone, as ancient and indestructible as any pirate's cutlass. \"Cap\u2019n,\" he said, waving the phone like a treasure map, \"I found this where the Beauty was last anchored.\"\n\nBarnacle snatched the phone, peering at the glowing screen with suspicion. \"What sorcery be this?\" he muttered, poking at the buttons with a calloused finger. The screen lit up with a cryptic message from the Hermit Crabs. \n\n\"To the salty seadogs who dared park in our turf,\" it read, \"Your ship now belongs to the Hermit Crabs. We\u2019ll be waitin\u2019 at the Old Lighthouse. Come if you dare.\"\n\nThe crew erupted into a cacophony of disbelief and outrage. \"Hermit Crabs!\" Salty Pete spat. \"Those scallywags! Stealin' ships like it\u2019s a game!\"\n\n\"Speaking of games,\" piped up Gamer Gary, the youngest crew member, who was an avid fan of pirate-themed video games. \"I reckon we can use this here Nokia\u2019s map feature like in 'PlunderQuest'! We follow the dot to the lighthouse!\"\n\nBarnacle squinted at the pixelated map, which seemed to depict a route only slightly less confusing than a treasure map drawn by a drunken sailor. \"Right, lads and lass,\" he declared, attempting to exude confidence. \"Let\u2019s reclaim the Barnacle Beauty!\"\n\nWith renewed purpose, the crew sallied forth into the rain-soaked streets, sprinting through puddles like a pack of wet dogs. They followed the Nokia\u2019s map, though more than once they ended up down alleyways leading nowhere but to more graffiti and soggy cardboard boxes.\n\nFinally, after several wrong turns and a brief encounter with a very confused raccoon, they found themselves before the towering silhouette of the Old Lighthouse. The Hermit Crabs, a scrappy gang clad in mismatched rain gear, awaited them at the base, grinning with the smugness of those who think themselves victorious.\n\n\"Ye Hermit Crabs think ye can outwit us?\" Barnacle shouted, brandishing the Nokia as though it were a sword. \"We demand our ship returned!\"\n\nThe Hermit Crabs laughed, but before they could respond, Gamer Gary stepped forward. \"I challenge ye to a game!\" he declared, recalling a pivotal scene from his favorite video game. \"Winner takes the ship!\"\n\nThe Hermit Crabs, intrigued by this unexpected proposition, agreed, and thus began a game of wits and daring unlike any other. With a combination of pirate cunning, game strategy, and a bit of luck, the crew managed to outmaneuver the Hermit Crabs, reclaiming the Barnacle Beauty and sailing away into the stormy night, leaving behind the graffiti and the bus stop, and with them, one heck of a tale.",

        "story_b": "The sky was a bruised shade of purple, and the acid rain fell like a thousand tiny daggers, sizzling as they hit the pavement. Mother Nature seemed to be having a grand time drenching the ragtag pirate crew huddled under the decrepit, graffiti-covered bus stop. Captain Rumble, with his oversized hat and even larger ego, paced back and forth, narrowly avoiding the puddles of acidic doom. He clutched a Nokia phone like it was the Holy Grail, insisting it was their compass to salvation.\n\n\"Arr, this blasted rain's just a rival curse, mark me words!\" Captain Rumble declared, shaking his fist at the heavens. The crew, a motley group of dubious competence, nodded solemnly as if contemplating the wisdom of his words.\n\nFirst Mate Squawk, notorious for speaking exclusively in pirate-themed riddles, perched on a battered bench. \"When the sea's in the sky, and the ship's gone awry, what beast steals but has no claws?\" he mused cryptically, earning a chorus of groans from the crew.\n\nNavigator Nelly, whose sense of direction was as reliable as a broken compass\u2014her good luck charm\u2014grinned as she twirled it like a baton. \"Captain, the Nokia's got Snake on it. We could strategize like the days of old!\" she suggested with a mischievous glint.\n\n\"Snake, ye say?\" Captain Rumble's eyes lit up with the wild hope of a man who believed in the indestructibility of outdated technology. \"Aye, a game of strategy! Let\u2019s outwit them Hermit Crabs!\"\n\nThe crew, now marginally drier in their makeshift haven, began transforming the bus stop into a temporary pirate camp. The graffiti walls, a chaotic masterpiece of urban expression, became their map. One suspiciously detailed mural depicted a treasure map, which the crew enthusiastically adopted as their own.\n\n\"Look, Captain! X marks the spot right next to that...what is that, a sea monster or a cat?\" pondered Peg-Leg Pete, scratching his head.\n\n\"Aye, that be a cat, Pete. A fearsome feline, no doubt,\" Captain Rumble affirmed, squinting at the vibrant spray-painted creature. \"Navigator Nelly, plot us a course using yon map!\"\n\n\"Aye aye, Cap'n!\" Nelly saluted, her enthusiasm undampened by their dire circumstances. \"If the X be true, the Hermit Crabs' lair ain't too far.\"\n\nAs the crew debated tactics, Captain Rumble attempted to call the Hermit Crabs on the Nokia, convinced they could negotiate the return of their ship through sheer charm and outdated technology. \"Why is it always seagulls?\" he muttered, glaring at the persistent birds scavenging nearby.\n\n\"The birds know more than they let on, Captain,\" Squawk replied enigmatically, flapping an imaginary wing. \n\nWith the acid rain showing no signs of letting up, the crew decided it was time to reclaim their stolen vessel. Armed with umbrellas as makeshift cutlasses and a determination that bordered on absurd, they ventured out, leaving the safety of their bus stop sanctuary.\n\nTheir journey led them to a deserted beach, where they found the Hermit Crabs' hideout\u2014a rickety shack that looked like it had been assembled from shipwrecks and bad decisions. But as they prepared to storm the place, they were stopped in their tracks by a new challenge: a flock of aggressive seagulls, guarding the entrance like feathered sentinels.\n\n\"Blimey, them's the biggest seagulls I've ever seen,\" muttered Peg-Leg Pete, eyeing their beady eyes and sharp beaks with trepidation.\n\n\"Riddle me this, crew,\" Squawk began, \"when wings are your foe, what do you throw?\" His grin was as wide as the ocean as he revealed a stash of stale bread.\n\nWith a battle cry that echoed across the shore, the crew lobbed the bread, distracting the seagulls long enough to make their move. Yet, as they charged forward, Captain Rumble's voice rang out, \"Hold fast, mates! We've got a ship to reclaim, but first... who\u2019s got Snake on level ten?\"\n\nAnd with that, their adventure continued, uncertain and absurd, driven by questionable leadership and the indestructible spirit of a Nokia phone.",

        "prompt": "Stranded in a graffiti-covered bus stop during a rare acid rainstorm, your ragtag pirate crew faces a major setback: your ship has been stolen by a gang called the Hermit Crabs. Now, with nothing but a Nokia phone, questionable leadership, and a lot of bad luck, you must figure out how to reclaim your vessel and start your adventure.",
        "ground_truth": "# How (Not) to Start a Pirate Adventure [* Sunoco City, West Virginia, Wasteland. Sunset. You know...despite its hardships -deadly mutants trying to kill you, rival scavenger gangs trying to kill you, the Spice trying to kill you- it could be a *very* beautiful place during a sunset. The way the sun sinks beneath the horizon as you look out into the desert. The way the Spice in the air gives the orange and purple-tinted sky almost a....*magical* feeling! The mutant coyotes, somewhere in the distance, gently howling the song of their people. Sometimes, the sunset gets so peaceful and quiet that one would almost...forget...that they were in the Wasteland, where everything, even the sand itself, tries to kill you. Ah...the simple beauty in life... NOPE. **ACID RAIN.** Almost twice a year did it ever rain in West Virginia. And today was one of those days! And if you thought that rain in the Wasteland was anything like rain nearly 200 years ago, boy were you mistaken! The rain was...*acid rain*. Real...acid rain. Acid rain that if you dared to stick your naked, unprotected head under it, you were walking away without hair. And if you dared to look *up* or -Spice forbid- try to catch the *acid raindrops* onto your tongue, you're...basically walking away looking like the Joker. And where was our newly-formed, green in the gills, positively *itching* to start their pirate adventure, crew right now?? Bus stop. Thankfully the buildings, any coverings, and the bus stops, were made with lead (because *that* was safe!) to withstand the acid! So that's where the crew was. All stuffed into a smallish, lead-topped, glass-walled, graffiti'd, bus stop. Some sat on the grimy bench, others stood around or sat on the floor where the acid rain couldn't reach them. Their fearless captain, Petey Flynn, sat back, legs stretched out in front of him, on the far side of the bench. Next to his first mate, Voodood. Petey sighed and reached into his pocket, taking out a *centuries-old*, small, Nokia phone, in more or less pristine condition. He dialed a number and put it up to his ear. It picked up after a few rings. \"Heeeyyyy Genie-Bean!\", Petey crooned over the sounds of acid rain into the phone. \"Peter. Pinkie-Pie. Flynn.\", came, expectantly, from the other end of the line. And then Gina silently waited for the rest. It had only been a *week* since Petey set out on his 'Portal Gun pirate adventure', and has somehow, in one week, acquired a crew. They were set to depart *today morning*. So the fact that he was calling her could not *possibly* mean anything good. \"Soooo.....\", Petey continued after a glance over at Voodood, and then the rest of his crew,\"....we kiiiiinda....sorta.....*lost* the ship.\" \"YOU WHA--\" \"--It's okay! It's okay!\", Petey sat up, \"We *know* where it is! Or or...rather *who has it*! And it's....it's *Buster*. The Hermit Crabs took our ship. --Stole! *Stole* our ship.\" The *longest*, most drawn out sigh came from Gina's side of the line. \"Your....*pirate ship*...\", she clarified, \"....was....*pirated*...by the Hermit Crabs?\" \"Yeeahhhh. I mean if you really think about it, it was *such* a funny stor--\" **CLICK.** Petey blinked down at the phone. She hung up. He turned to rest of his crew, surprisingly *very* nonchalant about the whole thing. And gave them a shrug, sitting back once again. \"It's okay guys, she'll call back! I'm sure she's comin' up with a *plan* for us as we speak!\", he paused to look at each and every person at that bus stop, \"...Man, can you *believe* it's already been a week since we all met? Feels like *just yesterday* Dood saved me from that other time the Crabs jumped me....\" Seeming to quite literally be content with waiting for his sister to *maybe* call him back with a plan, Petey's eyes glazed over with recollection of that week during which they all met.",
        "story_a": "The sky wept with a venomous deluge, each raindrop hissing as it struck the cracked pavement. The acrid scent of burning chemicals permeated the air, mingling with the earthy odor of damp concrete. A cacophony of pattering rain and distant thunder reverberated through the graffiti-covered bus stop, where the remnants of the notorious pirate crew, the Storm Serpents, huddled together in a tenuous sanctuary.\n\nCaptain Sable, a woman whose commanding presence belied her petite stature, stood at the edge of the shelter, her dark eyes scanning the horizon with a mixture of fury and desperation. Her once pristine tricorn hat now drooped miserably, dripping with the noxious rain. She clenched a weathered Nokia phone in one hand, its ancient keypad slick with moisture. The screen glowed dimly, casting an eerie light on her determined face.\n\n\"We can\u2019t stay here forever,\" growled Flint, the burly first mate whose scarred visage looked even more menacing in the flickering light. He shifted restlessly, his broad shoulders barely fitting beneath the narrow awning. \"The Hermit Crabs have our ship. And if we don\u2019t act fast, they\u2019ll strip her down to the bones.\"\n\nAround them, the rest of the crew murmured in uneasy agreement. There was Marlowe, the lithe navigator with a penchant for getting lost in his own thoughts, and Lila, the sharp-tongued quartermaster whose quick wit was second only to her lethal aim. And then there was Jinx, the youngest and unluckiest of the lot, whose very presence seemed to attract misfortune like iron filings to a magnet.\n\nJinx shuffled his feet nervously, glancing up at the sky as if expecting it to rain fire next. \"But how do we even start looking for them?\" he asked, his voice trembling. \"We don\u2019t have any weapons, no transport, and that phone\u2019s older than dirt.\"\n\nCaptain Sable\u2019s grip tightened on the Nokia. \"This phone,\" she said, her voice steely, \"is our only lifeline. And we\u2019re going to use it to call in a favor.\"\n\nLila raised an eyebrow, her skepticism evident. \"A favor? From who? Most of our so-called friends would sooner slit our throats than help us.\"\n\nSable\u2019s lips curled into a tight smile. \"Not this one. There\u2019s a fence named Rook who owes me. Big time. If anyone knows the Hermit Crabs\u2019 movements, it\u2019s him.\"\n\nThe crew exchanged glances, a spark of hope igniting in their eyes. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was a start. Sable dialed the number with practiced fingers, the tone ringing out like a beacon in the storm. After an agonizing pause, the call connected.\n\n\"Sable,\" a gravelly voice answered, laced with suspicion. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Rook, I need information,\" Sable replied, her tone brooking no argument. \"The Hermit Crabs stole our ship. Where are they headed?\"\n\nThere was a rustle of papers, a muffled curse. \"You\u2019re in luck,\" Rook said grudgingly. \"They\u2019ve been laying low in the old shipyard by the docks. But you didn\u2019t hear it from me.\"\n\nSable ended the call, her eyes gleaming with renewed determination. \"To the docks, then,\" she declared. \"We\u2019ll take back what\u2019s ours.\"\n\nThe crew nodded, a newfound resolve settling over them. The acid rain continued to pour, but it couldn\u2019t extinguish the fire in their hearts. They moved as one, leaving the dilapidated bus stop behind, their silhouettes merging with the shadows of the storm.\n\nThe journey to the docks was fraught with peril. The city was a labyrinth of crumbling buildings and deserted streets, each step echoing with the threat of danger. But the Storm Serpents pressed on, driven by the promise of reclaiming their stolen ship.\n\nAs they neared the shipyard, Flint\u2019s keen eyes spotted movement. \"There,\" he whispered, pointing to a cluster of figures skulking around the rusted hulls. The Hermit Crabs, oblivious to their approach.\n\nSable signaled for silence, her mind racing with a plan. They had the element of surprise, and with it, a chance to turn the tide. \"On my mark,\" she breathed, her voice barely audible over the storm.\n\nThe crew tensed, every muscle coiled and ready. The moment stretched, the air thick with anticipation. And then, with a fierce cry, Sable led the charge, her crew following close behind.\n\nThe battle was swift and brutal, a clash of wills and desperation. The Hermit Crabs, caught off guard, fell back under the relentless assault. Sable\u2019s crew fought with the ferocity of those with nothing left to lose, reclaiming their ship inch by hard-fought inch.\n\nWhen the dust finally settled, the Storm Serpents stood victorious, their ship once more beneath their feet. The rain had begun to let up, the sky lightening with the promise of a new dawn. Sable looked around at her crew, battered but unbroken, and allowed herself a rare smile.\n\n\"Our adventure begins anew,\" she said, her voice ringing with triumph. \"Let\u2019s set sail.\"",
        "story_b": "Captain Redbeard squinted at the Nokia phone in his weathered hand, the acid rain pattering rhythmically on the bus stop's tin roof. The graffiti around them danced like a chaotic treasure map under the storm's relentless assault, and he could swear one of the scribbles looked suspiciously like a kraken. \"Blast it, this contraption's as useful as a compass in a whirlpool!\" he grumbled, shaking the phone as if it might suddenly reveal their ship's location.\n\nFirst Mate Sally, a paragon of pragmatism amidst the crew's motley chaos, peered over Redbeard's shoulder. \"Cap'n, maybe if we use it to call someone who knows about these Hermit Crabs, we might get a lead on the ship.\"\n\nRedbeard's eyes gleamed with a spark of hope. \"Aye, Sally, ye might be onto somethin'. But who in this blasted city would know about a bunch o' crusty thieves?\"\n\nMeanwhile, the crew huddled under the scant shelter, each member an embodiment of pirate lore clashing hilariously with urban life. Cannonball Carl, whose girth could rival a small cannon, was trying to decipher the graffiti, convinced it was an ancient pirate code. \"This here's gotta be a clue,\" he declared, tracing a finger over a particularly colorful mural. \"Or maybe directions to the nearest tavern.\"\n\n\"Or the loo,\" muttered Peggy Pegleg, who was tapping her wooden limb impatiently on the wet ground.\n\n\"Enough o' that!\" Redbeard commanded, the Nokia now aloft like a ceremonial sword. \"Let's figure out how this cursed thing works!\"\n\nDeckhand Jimmy, whose youthful exuberance often led to impulsive suggestions, piped up. \"Cap'n, what if we record a message and send it to the airwaves? Like a distress call!\"\n\nRedbeard nodded sagely, despite having no clue what airwaves were. \"Aye, Jimmy, get to it then! Make it known that we've been wronged by these Hermit Crabs!\"\n\nAs Jimmy fiddled with the phone, the crew fell into a heated debate about the best way to communicate with the Hermit Crabs. Suggestions ranged from sending a message in a bottle via the sewer drains to staging an elaborate puppet show.\n\nSally rolled her eyes and crossed her arms, leaning against a particularly vibrant depiction of a technicolor parrot. \"Or we could just try to call them directly,\" she interjected dryly. \"If only we had their number.\"\n\n\"Arr, but where's the adventure in that?\" Redbeard chuckled, patting her shoulder.\n\nMeanwhile, the rain continued its sizzling assault on the pavement, the acidic scent mingling with the aroma of city life\u2014a blend of exhaust and street food that seemed oddly fitting for a pirate crew marooned in modernity.\n\nFinally, Jimmy managed to dial a number, his voice crackling over the Nokia's tiny speaker. \"This is Captain Redbeard's crew, and we're demandin' the return of our ship! Ye Hermit Crabs best be hearin' this!\"\n\nThe voice on the other end was far from helpful. \"Welcome to Radio City, where your voice is our broadcast! You're live on air!\"\n\nSally slapped her forehead, while Carl let out a belly laugh that echoed across the bus stop.\n\n\"Well, now the whole city knows we're in a pickle,\" Peggy quipped, tapping her peg leg to a jaunty rhythm.\n\nBut then, a lightbulb moment struck Redbeard. \"On air, ye say? Then let's make this work for us!\"\n\nHe grabbed the phone and leaned in, his voice a commanding boom. \"To ye Hermit Crabs, we challenge ye to a duel of wits and strength! Meet us by the canal at dawn, and may the best crew reclaim the ship!\"\n\nThe crew cheered, their spirits buoyed by the captain's audacity. As the rain began to let up, they set off, the promise of adventure renewed in their hearts.\n\nIn the distance, the city canal awaited\u2014a maze of water and steel that would test their pirate mettle. And perhaps, just perhaps, it would lead them to their next grand escapade.",

Just tell me where he is!\u201d The strange man shouted, sending spit flying at my face as he did.\n\u201cFine. He\u2019s at work, the local Lidl,\u201d I answered, hoping he\u2019ll believe me.\n\u201cAre you stupid?! If I can track down his house I can track down his work. And he\u2019s not there!\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s where he said he\u2019d. If he\u2019s not there, then I don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\nThe man narrowed his eyes at me before lowering his gun. \u201cHe must\u2019ve known I was coming, made a break for it.\u201d As he left, he put his finger to his ear and spoke into what I assumed was a radio.

I\u2019d already found it while cleaning a couple months ago, but hadn\u2019t opened it, figuring it was a disaster survival pack or something, but with the new revelations, I had other ideas. I went to the floorboards and lifted them up to find a puzzle box that I already solved the first time I found it, so quickly solved again to pull out a bag.\n\nAnd viola, money, fake identities and, most importantly, a burner phone. I dialled my friend\u2019s number and waited. Once he answered I didn\u2019t give him time for his usual greetings.\n\n\u201cSome guy is looking for you.

What do you need?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat grab bag, take it to where I had my first birthday party.\u201d With that, he hung up. I furrowed my eyebrows. He\u2019d always told me he hadn\u2019t had a birthday party. So if it hadn\u2019t happened, it didn\u2019t happen anywhere, it happened nowhere. Ohhhh, I got it.\n\n30 minutes later, I found myself outside a pub a few miles outside of town. Normally you could get there in half the time, but I had to make sure I wasn\u2019t being followed. The pub was called Nowhere, people said it was because you could say to your spouse you were going \u2018nowhere\u2019 when they asked and not technically be lying.\n\nI handed my friend the bag, filled with some chocolate as an added treat before saying goodbye.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll miss you. Don\u2019t think the next roommate could replace you.\u201d But instead of agreeing, he shook his head.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be having another roommate. As long as they\u2019re coming after me, you\u2019re in danger. Go to this address,\u201d he handed me a small slip of paper, \u201cit\u2019s a safe house, you\u2019ll be safe there.\u201d\n\nNormally I\u2019d be disagreeing, I had a life and a job and family here, but being held at gunpoint still had me shaken, so I just nodded and we parted ways.\n\nI drove straight home, packing up quickly what I could and talking with the landlord. I told him I\u2019d recently inherited a house that came ready furnished, so I\u2019d be willing to sell him the furniture so he could rent the room as pre furnished. We came to a deal quickly and I walked away with some extra money in my account, that I immediately drained before driving.\n\nI didn\u2019t stop driving for almost 6 hours, not even for a toilet break, until I finally reached the address, somewhere in the middle of Scotland.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a modest house. 3 stories, as wide as my block of flats and a huge garden that I\u2019d have to measure in acres rather than metres.\n\nThe cupboards were wet stocked with non-perishables and a large amount of money, so I knew food wouldn\u2019t be an issue for a while. So I unpacked and settled into my new home, looking at the landline, wondering when the call would come in that I could go home.",
        "story_a": "\"Today\u2019s the day I tackle my taxes,\" I announced, plopping down at the kitchen table with a stack of forms and a mug of coffee. My roommate, Ethan, glanced up from his latest puzzle\u2014a 3D model of the Eiffel Tower made from matchsticks.\n\n\"Need any help?\" he asked, a glint of amusement in his eye.\n\nI waved him off. \"Nah, I got this. It's just numbers and boxes.\"\n\nEthan chuckled, returning to his intricate construction. He always had these weird hobbies. One week it was lock-picking, the next it was cryptography. I\u2019d always chalked it up to ADHD, figuring he was just a restless genius. But today, that perception was about to shatter.\n\nI was elbow-deep in deductions when the doorbell rang. Ethan\u2019s head snapped up, and for a moment, I saw something in his eyes\u2014something cold and calculating. He stood up, his movements fluid and silent, and walked to the door. I followed, curious.\n\nThe man on the other side was tall and imposing, with a hard face that screamed trouble. Ethan's demeanor shifted, becoming something entirely different\u2014controlled, intense. \n\n\"Long time, no see, Ethan,\" the man said, voice like gravel.\n\nEthan didn\u2019t respond. Instead, he stepped aside, letting the man in. My stomach churned with a mix of confusion and dread. \n\n\"Ethan, who is this?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.\n\nThe man ignored me, his eyes locked on Ethan. \"You\u2019ve been hard to find. The organization wants you back.\"\n\nEthan sighed, a sound filled with a weight I\u2019d never heard from him before. \"I told them, I'm out.\"\n\nThe man pulled a gun from his coat, pointing it directly at my face. \"And I told them, that's not an option.\"\n\nMy heart pounded, and a cold sweat broke out on my forehead. \"E-Ethan, what\u2019s going on?\"\n\nEthan\u2019s face was a mask of calm, but his eyes flickered with something fierce. \"I'm sorry, Jake. There's a lot I haven't told you.\"\n\n\"Yeah, like the fact you're an ex-assassin?\" The words tumbled out before I could stop them. It sounded absurd even as I said it.\n\nEthan's lips twitched into a small, humorless smile. \"Something like that.\"\n\nThe man with the gun cut in. \"Enough chit-chat. You\u2019re coming with me.\"\n\nEthan's eyes never left mine. \"Jake, trust me.\"\n\nI nodded, though every instinct screamed at me to run. Ethan moved faster than I thought possible. In a blur, he disarmed the man, twisting his wrist until the gun clattered to the floor. A swift kick to the chest sent the intruder sprawling.\n\nThe fight was over in seconds. Ethan stood over the man, breathing heavily, while I struggled to process what had just happened.\n\n\"Ethan, what the hell?\" I finally managed to say.\n\nHe ran a hand through his hair, looking suddenly weary. \"I was part of a... special operations group. We did things\u2014bad things. I got out, but they don't let people just leave.\"\n\nI glanced at the unconscious man on the floor. \"So, all those hobbies... they weren\u2019t just hobbies?\"\n\nEthan shook his head. \"No. They were skills I needed to survive.\"\n\nI sank into a chair, feeling the weight of it all settle on my shoulders. \"What happens now?\"\n\nEthan knelt beside the man, checking his pulse. \"We need to get out of here. They\u2019ll keep coming.\"\n\n\"Where will we go?\"\n\nHe stood up, determination hardening his features. \"Somewhere they can't find us. But first, we need to tie this guy up and figure out our next move.\"\n\nAs we worked together, a strange calm settled over me. This was Ethan\u2014my eccentric, puzzle-loving roommate. But he was also someone else, someone dangerous and skilled. And now, I was part of his world.\n\nBy the time we finished, the sun was setting, casting long shadows across the room. Ethan looked at me, his expression softened.\n\n\"Jake, I'm sorry you got dragged into this.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No turning back now, right?\"\n\nHe smiled, a real one this time. \"Right.\"\n\nIn that moment, I knew our lives had changed forever. The future was uncertain, filled with danger and questions. But as long as we faced it together, I felt a strange sense of hope.",
        "story_b": "I always thought Jake was just quirky. His strange hobbies seemed harmless, even if they were a bit unusual. Knowing how to pick locks, solve every puzzle and cipher by heart, or commit tax fraud\u2014these were just things that made him interesting. I never imagined they were skills from a darker past.\n\nToday, everything changed. I came home to find Jake standing in the middle of our living room, gun in hand, eyes wild with fear. \"Sit down, Alex,\" he ordered, voice trembling. \n\nI froze, my heart pounding. \"Jake, what the hell is going on?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady as I slowly lowered myself onto the couch.\n\nJake's hands were shaking, the gun wobbling as he tried to keep it pointed at me. \"I never wanted you to find out like this,\" he said, almost pleading. \"But I'm out of time.\"\n\nThe pieces started to fall into place. His late-night disappearances, the coded messages he received, the scars he tried to hide. Jake wasn't just quirky; he was an ex-assassin. \"This isn't what I wanted,\" I muttered, more to myself than to him. \"I didn't ask to be in this situation.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Jake replied, his voice breaking. \"But if word gets out that you know who I am, my life\u2014and yours\u2014will never be the same. My enemies will come for you, Alex. They don't leave loose ends.\"\n\nA cold shiver ran down my spine. Everything I had built\u2014my job, my friends, my life\u2014was at risk. \"What do you want from me?\" I asked, my voice barely a whisper.\n\n\"I need your help to disappear for good,\" Jake said, his eyes boring into mine. \"I never wanted to hurt you. I just need a way out.\"\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to steady my racing thoughts. \"And if I say no?\"\n\nJake's grip on the gun tightened. \"Then neither of us survives this.\"\n\nI might not survive this, but I'll make sure you don't get away with it either, I thought. But I couldn't just sit there and do nothing. \"Alright,\" I said finally. \"What do you need me to do?\"\n\nJake's relief was palpable. He lowered the gun slightly, his shoulders relaxing. \"I need you to help me gather some things. Documents, money, anything that can help me start a new life.\"\n\nAs we moved around the apartment, gathering the items Jake needed, I couldn't help but reflect on how much my past had shaped me. I had always thought I was just an ordinary person, trying to make a living. But now I realized how much my past\u2014my stubbornness, my resourcefulness\u2014had prepared me for this moment.\n\nWe worked in silence, the tension between us thick and heavy. My mind raced with questions. How could I reconcile the person I thought I knew with the reality of who Jake was? And more importantly, could I really trust him not to turn on me once he had what he needed?\n\nFinally, we had everything packed. Jake turned to me, his expression unreadable. \"Thank you, Alex,\" he said quietly. \"I know this isn't easy for you.\"\n\n\"Just promise me one thing,\" I replied, my voice hard. \"Promise me you'll never come back.\"\n\nJake nodded. \"I promise. This is the last you'll ever see of me.\"\n\nWith that, he slipped out the door and into the night, leaving me alone in the apartment that now felt so empty and unfamiliar. I sank onto the couch, my mind racing. Was it possible to truly escape one's past? Or are we all just running from our own shadows?\n\nAs the reality of what had just happened sank in, I felt a strange mix of emotions\u2014relief, fear, and a deep, gnawing uncertainty about the future. But one thing was clear: my life would never be the same. And maybe, just maybe, that wasn't such a bad thing after all.",

The pub was called Nowhere, people said it was because you could say to your spouse you were going \u2018nowhere\u2019 when they asked and not technically be lying.\n\nI handed my friend the bag, filled with some chocolate as an added treat before saying goodbye.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll miss you. Don\u2019t think the next roommate could replace you.\u201d But instead of agreeing, he shook his head.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be having another roommate. As long as they\u2019re coming after me, you\u2019re in danger. Go to this address,\u201d he handed me a small slip of paper, \u201cit\u2019s a safe house, you\u2019ll be safe there.\u201d\n\nNormally I\u2019d be disagreeing, I had a life and a job and family here, but being held at gunpoint still had me shaken, so I just nodded and we parted ways.\n\nI drove straight home, packing up quickly what I could and talking with the landlord. I told him I\u2019d recently inherited a house that came ready furnished, so I\u2019d be willing to sell him the furniture so he could rent the room as pre furnished. We came to a deal quickly and I walked away with some extra money in my account, that I immediately drained before driving.\n\nI didn\u2019t stop driving for almost 6 hours, not even for a toilet break, until I finally reached the address, somewhere in the middle of Scotland.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a modest house. 3 stories, as wide as my block of flats and a huge garden that I\u2019d have to measure in acres rather than metres.\n\nThe cupboards were wet stocked with non-perishables and a large amount of money, so I knew food wouldn\u2019t be an issue for a while. So I unpacked and settled into my new home, looking at the landline, wondering when the call would come in that I could go home.",
        "story_a": "\"Today\u2019s the day I tackle my taxes,\" I announced, plopping down at the kitchen table with a stack of forms and a mug of coffee. My roommate, Ethan, glanced up from his latest puzzle\u2014a 3D model of the Eiffel Tower made from matchsticks.\n\n\"Need any help?\" he asked, a glint of amusement in his eye.\n\nI waved him off. \"Nah, I got this. It's just numbers and boxes.\"\n\nEthan chuckled, returning to his intricate construction. He always had these weird hobbies. One week it was lock-picking, the next it was cryptography. I\u2019d always chalked it up to ADHD, figuring he was just a restless genius. But today, that perception was about to shatter.\n\nI was elbow-deep in deductions when the doorbell rang. Ethan\u2019s head snapped up, and for a moment, I saw something in his eyes\u2014something cold and calculating. He stood up, his movements fluid and silent, and walked to the door. I followed, curious.\n\nThe man on the other side was tall and imposing, with a hard face that screamed trouble. Ethan's demeanor shifted, becoming something entirely different\u2014controlled, intense. \n\n\"Long time, no see, Ethan,\" the man said, voice like gravel.\n\nEthan didn\u2019t respond. Instead, he stepped aside, letting the man in. My stomach churned with a mix of confusion and dread. \n\n\"Ethan, who is this?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.\n\nThe man ignored me, his eyes locked on Ethan. \"You\u2019ve been hard to find. The organization wants you back.\"\n\nEthan sighed, a sound filled with a weight I\u2019d never heard from him before. \"I told them, I'm out.\"\n\nThe man pulled a gun from his coat, pointing it directly at my face. \"And I told them, that's not an option.\"\n\nMy heart pounded, and a cold sweat broke out on my forehead. \"E-Ethan, what\u2019s going on?\"\n\nEthan\u2019s face was a mask of calm, but his eyes flickered with something fierce. \"I'm sorry, Jake. There's a lot I haven't told you.\"\n\n\"Yeah, like the fact you're an ex-assassin?\" The words tumbled out before I could stop them. It sounded absurd even as I said it.\n\nEthan's lips twitched into a small, humorless smile. \"Something like that.\"\n\nThe man with the gun cut in. \"Enough chit-chat. You\u2019re coming with me.\"\n\nEthan's eyes never left mine. \"Jake, trust me.\"\n\nI nodded, though every instinct screamed at me to run. Ethan moved faster than I thought possible. In a blur, he disarmed the man, twisting his wrist until the gun clattered to the floor. A swift kick to the chest sent the intruder sprawling.\n\nThe fight was over in seconds. Ethan stood over the man, breathing heavily, while I struggled to process what had just happened.\n\n\"Ethan, what the hell?\" I finally managed to say.\n\nHe ran a hand through his hair, looking suddenly weary. \"I was part of a... special operations group. We did things\u2014bad things. I got out, but they don't let people just leave.\"\n\nI glanced at the unconscious man on the floor. \"So, all those hobbies... they weren\u2019t just hobbies?\"\n\nEthan shook his head. \"No. They were skills I needed to survive.\"\n\nI sank into a chair, feeling the weight of it all settle on my shoulders. \"What happens now?\"\n\nEthan knelt beside the man, checking his pulse. \"We need to get out of here. They\u2019ll keep coming.\"\n\n\"Where will we go?\"\n\nHe stood up, determination hardening his features. \"Somewhere they can't find us. But first, we need to tie this guy up and figure out our next move.\"\n\nAs we worked together, a strange calm settled over me. This was Ethan\u2014my eccentric, puzzle-loving roommate. But he was also someone else, someone dangerous and skilled. And now, I was part of his world.\n\nBy the time we finished, the sun was setting, casting long shadows across the room. Ethan looked at me, his expression softened.\n\n\"Jake, I'm sorry you got dragged into this.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No turning back now, right?\"\n\nHe smiled, a real one this time. \"Right.\"\n\nIn that moment, I knew our lives had changed forever. The future was uncertain, filled with danger and questions. But as long as we faced it together, I felt a strange sense of hope.",
        "story_b": "I never thought I'd be staring down the barrel of a gun in my own living room, but here I was, my roommate's eyes cold and unrecognizable. The cozy apartment we shared, with its mismatched furniture and cluttered bookshelves, seemed like a surreal backdrop to this deadly standoff. The air was thick with tension, my heart pounding so loudly I was sure he could hear it.\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me?\" I demanded, my voice shaking with a mix of fear and betrayal. \"Would you have believed me?\" he shot back, his voice cold and steady. I always thought his quirks were just part of his charm. Turns out, they were skills honed for survival and death.\n\nHow had I missed the signs? The late-night disappearances, the scars he never explained. It all made sense now, but it was too late. My mind raced, trying to find a way out of this alive. Of all the ways I thought I'd die, being shot by my roommate wasn't even in the top ten. Shows what I know.\n\n\"Look,\" I said, trying to keep my voice calm, \"we don't have to do this. You don\u2019t have to do this.\" \n\nHe sighed, lowering the gun slightly but keeping his grip firm. \"You weren't supposed to find out. It was safer that way.\" He looked almost regretful. Almost.\n\n\"Safer for who?\" I asked, anger bubbling up inside me. \"For me or for you?\" \n\n\"Both of us,\" he replied, his eyes flickering with something I couldn't quite read. \"But now that you know, things have to change.\"\n\nAs he tightened his grip on the gun, I remembered the emergency button hidden under the coffee table. One press, and the room would be flooded with blinding light. It was a relic from my past, a past I had tried so hard to leave behind. I knew I had to act fast, even if it meant revealing my own secrets. I couldn't let him pull the trigger.\n\n\"I know what you did,\" I said, my voice low and steady. \"But you don't know everything about me either.\"\n\nHis eyes narrowed, the gun wavering slightly. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Do you remember that code you taught me?\" I asked, inching my hand closer to the button. \"The one you said was just for fun?\" \n\nHe nodded, suspicion growing in his eyes.\n\n\"It wasn't just for fun,\" I continued. \"It was a test. And I passed.\" \n\nJust as he was about to pull the trigger, I whispered the code word that only someone from my old life would know. His eyes widened in recognition, the gun lowering as the realization hit him.\n\n\"You... you're one of them,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\"Not anymore,\" I replied, pressing the button. The room was instantly flooded with blinding light, and I took my chance. Lunging forward, I knocked the gun from his hand and sent it skittering across the floor.\n\nWe stood there, panting and staring at each other, the weight of our shared past hanging heavy in the air. How had we both ended up here, trying to escape the same shadows?\n\n\"I never wanted this,\" he said, his voice breaking. \"I just wanted to be normal.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" I replied, my own voice trembling. \"But here we are.\"\n\nAs the light began to fade, I knew we had to make a choice. We could either continue living in fear, or we could find a way to trust each other. It was a risk, but one I was willing to take.\n\n\"Let's make a deal,\" I said, extending my hand. \"No more secrets. We help each other stay hidden, stay safe.\"\n\nHe looked at my hand, then back at me, the conflict clear in his eyes. Finally, he nodded, taking my hand in his.\n\n\"Deal,\" he said, a hint of a smile playing at the corners of his mouth.\n\nIn that moment, we both knew that survival would come at a cost. But for the first time, it felt like a cost we could bear together. The room, once filled with tension and fear, now held a fragile sense of hope. And as we stood there, two ex-assassins trying to find a new path, I realized that maybe, just maybe, we could find a way to live in the light, instead of hiding in the shadows.",

I\u2019d already found it while cleaning a couple months ago, but hadn\u2019t opened it, figuring it was a disaster survival pack or something, but with the new revelations, I had other ideas. I went to the floorboards and lifted them up to find a puzzle box that I already solved the first time I found it, so quickly solved again to pull out a bag.\n\nAnd viola, money, fake identities and, most importantly, a burner phone.

        "story_b": "I always thought his lock-picking skills were just a quirky hobby. Turns out, they were part of his \"previous employment.\" My heart pounded in my chest as I stared at the gun, its barrel staring back at me like a cold, unblinking eye. It was one of those moments when the universe decided to smack you in the face with a reality check, and I was the unlucky recipient.\n\n\"Really, Jason?\" I stammered, trying to mask my terror with sarcasm. \"All those times you 'joked' about disappearing people\u2014I thought you were just being dramatic!\"\n\nHis smirk was as sharp as ever, a deadly charm that had probably saved him countless times. \"You always were too curious for your own good,\" he replied, his voice as calm as if we were discussing the weather.\n\nI glanced around our cozy apartment, now a prison with its locked windows and heavy drapes. The eclectic mix of furniture and decor\u2014once a testament to our shared eccentric tastes\u2014felt like a collection of sinister props. His collection of exotic teas suddenly seemed less about taste and more about poisons.\n\n\"But a gun, Jason? Really? I thought we were past all this,\" I said, trying to buy time as my mind raced for a solution. \"You know, I'm not great at getting blood out of the carpet.\"\n\nHe chuckled, a sound that used to be comforting but now felt like the eerie soundtrack to my imminent demise. \"Don't worry, I have a guy for that.\"\n\nI always figured Jason's bizarre knowledge of ciphers and tax fraud was just his ADHD manifesting in weird ways. I had even joked about how he could crack the Da Vinci Code in his sleep. Now, those skills seemed less endearing and more menacing.\n\nThe tension in the air was as thick as a fog, and I knew I had to act fast. I might not be an assassin, but years of escape room challenges had to count for something, right? I remembered a trick from one of those games\u2014a distraction that could buy me some time.\n\n\"Wait, Jason!\" I blurted out, \"I have a riddle for you!\"\n\nHe raised an eyebrow, clearly intrigued despite himself. \"You know I can't resist a good puzzle.\"\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to steady my trembling hands. \"What has keys but can't open locks?\"\n\nHis gaze softened for a moment, and I saw a flicker of the friend I thought I knew. \"A piano,\" he answered, lowering the gun slightly.\n\n\"Right!\" I said, seizing the moment. \"And speaking of music, I think there's something you should hear.\" I reached for my phone, praying he wouldn't shoot first and ask questions later.\n\nTo my surprise, Jason's curiosity got the better of him. I quickly pulled up a song\u2014a shared favorite from our college days. The familiar notes filled the room, a melody that held memories of late-night study sessions and endless debates over the best movie villains.\n\nHis grip on the gun slackened, and I saw the tension in his shoulders ease. The music was our unspoken truce, a reminder of the bond we once shared. As the song played, I inched towards the window, my heart pounding with each step.\n\n\"Jason,\" I said softly, \"we've been through a lot together. This doesn\u2019t have to end badly.\"\n\nHe hesitated, the gun wavering in his hand. I could see the internal conflict etched on his face, the struggle between the killer he once was and the friend he had become.\n\nIn that moment, I made a decision. I might not have his skills, but I had my own. Years of mediating roommate disputes and navigating office politics had taught me how to find common ground.\n\n\"Let's talk this out,\" I suggested, trying to sound braver than I felt. \"Over some of that weird tea you love so much.\"\n\nHe laughed, a genuine, if reluctant, sound. \"You always knew how to get me to listen.\"\n\nAs he lowered the gun, I released a breath I hadn't realized I was holding. The immediate threat was gone, but I knew our conversation was far from over. Still, it was a start\u2014a chance to untangle the mess we found ourselves in.\n\nFor now, I was just grateful to still be standing, armed with nothing but my wits and a shared history that might just save us both.",

Amidst subtle glances, unspoken tensions, and a buttery apple turnover, their fates begin to intertwine\u2014will duty or desire prevail?",
        "ground_truth": "On the terraces of the Citadel, a gentle breeze wafted through the air. Low tables, large cushions, and thick carpets were arranged with care, the linen cloths embroidered with the symbols of Rohan, and the white muslin of Gondor reflected the sunlight. Upon them lay silver platters filled with simple yet delightful fare: savory pies, salads of fresh fruit, slices of seed bread dipped in Dol Amroth's oil, portions of roast with a crisp crust, and morsels of spiced meat. Carafes of refreshing juices, white and red wine, sweet ratafia, and sparkling mead glimmered in the sun. Some elvish silk drapes had been stretched between decorated poles adorned with ribbons and red vine tendrils to provide shade for the guests.\nNot long before, the Citadel had been animated by a grand parade of Gondorian warriors, their silver armor shining beneath the warm autumn sun, and their long pikes reflecting rays of light. The Rohirrim knights had demonstrated their valor in a jousting exhibition: their powerful and agile steeds moved with perfect precision and grace, while the riders showcased their legendary equestrian mastery. Following this, the elegant knights of Dol Amroth glided onto the scene, their capes billowing like sails, as some sailors from the maritime realm displayed their skill in knot and rigging games, throwing ceremonial ropes and nets into the air, amidst the admiring applause of the spectators.\nThroughout the ceremony, \u00c9omer had maintained a composed expression, befitting a King of the Mark. Yet, every so often, his gaze inevitably slipped towards the beautiful daughter of Imrahil. Her attire, rich as befitted a princess, was of refined simplicity. The silver and blue cloak fluttered lightly in the breeze, occasionally revealing the amber skin of her shoulders, and, Bema help him, a generous portion of her collarbones. But it was Loth\u00edriel's face that truly captured \u00c9omer's attention: her bright eyes and full lips seemed to hide a secret smile.\nLoth\u00edriel, for her part, did not fail to notice the fleeting yet fervent glances the King of Rohan cast her way. She felt flattered, intrigued by the contrast between his imposing presence and the apparent shyness that shone through his gestures. Gracefully, she offered him a few subtle smiles, hoping that \u00c9omer would grasp the message hidden behind her composure. He was no Boromir, of course, and she would never forget him. However, there was something about this warrior king that reminded her of him, and she was ready to give him a chance. Her father had hinted at a promise, and Loth\u00edriel, fully aware of the role she was meant to play from birth, intended to honor it to the best of her ability. If the sovereign she was destined for was to be that proud barbarian king, well, she would not be intimidated.\nLater, after the horses and their riders had been refreshed, the foot soldiers and sailors found respite, and every noble of the court had settled at the long, informal low tables prepared for the feast, \u00c9omer was called loudly by the Dol Amrothian brothers with whom he had forged a sincere friendship as well as a steadfast military alliance. With a nod of his head, King Elassar gave his consent, and so \u00c9omer found himself seated right next to Loth\u00edriel. Perhaps it was mere coincidence, or perhaps not: Imrahil's knowing smile did not entirely escape him, making him suspect that the princess's family had orchestrated the meeting. In any case, he preferred it this way: he felt more at ease among the jovial and witty knights of Dol Amroth than among the pompous and haughty nobles of Gondor. Not to mention, it had the undeniable advantage of sitting next to the princess. It mattered little if the prince\u2014her father\u2014had had a hand in it. He continued to watch her as she laughed and conversed animatedly with her brothers, revealing more of her sharp wit and undeniable beauty. Though distracted by the charms of his neighbor, \u00c9omer still managed, albeit with some difficulty, to respond to the jests of his newfound friends. At one point, one of the guests offered Loth\u00edriel another glass of ratafia, and before she could accept, \u00c9omer interjected in a measured tone:\n\u201cSurely the princess would prefer a glass of fresh spring water.\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel was taken aback and, without allowing the others to hear, whispered with a tone betraying her displeasure:\n\u201cI thank my lord for his concern, but you are not a relative to whom I must account for my libations.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, I am not your kin.\"\nA \u201c\nnot yet\n\u201d lingered between them for a moment, an unspoken tension that vibrated the air with unexpressed possibilities.

        "story_a": "The Great Hall of Meduseld was alive with laughter, the clinking of goblets, and the rich scent of roasted meats and freshly baked bread. The alliance between Rohan and Gondor had brought about a celebration the likes of which had not been seen in many years. Golden banners of the Rohirrim draped alongside the silver and white standards of Gondor, symbolizing the unity of the two great kingdoms.\n\n\u00c9omer, King of the Mark, sat at the head of the grand table, his eyes scanning the room with a mixture of pride and wariness. His gaze settled on the empty seat beside him, reserved for Loth\u00edriel, daughter of Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth. He had heard much about her\u2014her sharp mind, her beauty, and her tendency to speak her mind in ways that both intrigued and unsettled the courtiers of Gondor.\n\nAs if on cue, Loth\u00edriel entered the hall, her presence commanding immediate attention. Draped in a dress of deep blue, her dark hair fell in waves down her back, and her eyes sparkled with a mix of curiosity and mischief. She approached the table with a grace that spoke of her noble lineage, and \u00c9omer stood to greet her, his heart unexpectedly quickening.\n\n\"My lady,\" he said, offering her a polite bow.\n\n\"King \u00c9omer,\" she replied with a nod, her eyes meeting his with a boldness that caught him off guard. \"It is an honor to be seated beside you.\"\n\n\"The honor is mine,\" he said, motioning for her to sit. As they took their seats, the feast continued around them, the noise and merriment providing a backdrop to their burgeoning connection.\n\nFor a while, they exchanged pleasantries, discussing the success of the alliance and the future of their kingdoms. But there was an undercurrent to their conversation, a tension that neither could ignore. \u00c9omer found himself stealing glances at Loth\u00edriel, noting the way her eyes crinkled when she laughed and the way her fingers drummed lightly against the table when she was lost in thought.\n\nAt one point, a servant placed a platter of buttery apple turnovers before them, and Loth\u00edriel's eyes lit up with delight. \"These are my favorite,\" she confessed, reaching for one. \"My father always has the kitchens prepare them for special occasions.\"\n\n\u00c9omer smiled, taking one for himself. \"Then let us consider this a special occasion indeed,\" he said, his tone light but his gaze serious.\n\nAs they bit into the turnovers, the conversation turned more personal. Loth\u00edriel spoke of her childhood in Dol Amroth, of the sea and the freedom she felt when riding along the shores. \u00c9omer listened intently, captivated by her stories and the passion with which she told them. He shared tales of his own, of the rolling plains of Rohan and the bond between the Rohirrim and their horses.\n\n\"There is something about the open sky,\" Loth\u00edriel mused, \"that makes one feel truly alive.\"\n\n\u00c9omer nodded in agreement. \"It is the same for me. The wind in my hair, the land stretching out before me\u2014it is where I feel most at home.\"\n\nTheir eyes met, and for a moment, the rest of the hall seemed to fade away. \u00c9omer felt a pull, a connection that was more than just the alliance between their kingdoms. It was something deeper, something that neither duty nor distance could easily sever.\n\nBut as quickly as the moment came, it was interrupted by a call for a toast. \u00c9omer raised his goblet, his voice strong and clear as he spoke of the bond between Rohan and Gondor, and the hope for a future of peace and prosperity. The hall erupted in cheers, and the spell between him and Loth\u00edriel was momentarily broken.\n\nAs the night wore on, \u00c9omer and Loth\u00edriel found themselves drawn back to each other, their conversation flowing easily despite the interruptions. They spoke of dreams and fears, of the weight of their responsibilities and the desire for something more.\n\n\"Do you ever wish,\" Loth\u00edriel asked softly, \"that you could set aside the crown, even for a day, and just be yourself?\"\n\n\u00c9omer considered her question, his expression contemplative. \"There are times,\" he admitted, \"when the burden of kingship feels heavy. But it is a weight I bear willingly, for the sake of my people.\"\n\nLoth\u00edriel nodded, understanding in her eyes. \"It is the same for me. I love my family, my home, but there are moments when I long for freedom.\"\n\n\"In that, we are kindred spirits,\" \u00c9omer said, a smile tugging at his lips.\n\nAs the feast drew to a close, \u00c9omer escorted Loth\u00edriel to the doors of Meduseld. The night air was cool, and the stars shone brightly above them. They stood in silence for a moment, the weight of their unspoken feelings hanging between them.\n\n\"Thank you for a memorable evening, King \u00c9omer,\" Loth\u00edriel said, her voice soft.\n\n\"The pleasure was mine, Lady Loth\u00edriel,\" he replied, his hand lingering on hers for just a moment longer than necessary. \"Until we meet again.\"\n\n\"Until then,\" she said, her eyes holding a promise that made \u00c9omer's heart ache with a longing he could not deny.\n\nAs she walked away, \u00c9omer watched her go, knowing that their fates were now intertwined. Whether duty or desire would prevail, only time would tell. But for tonight, he allowed himself to hope.",
        "story_b": "The grand hall of Minas Tirith was ablaze with light, banners of Rohan and Gondor proudly displayed side by side, their colors vibrant under the flickering candles. The air was thick with the scents of roasted meats, spiced wine, and the gentle hum of laughter and conversation. It was a night of celebration, marking the enduring alliance between the two great realms, yet for \u00c9omer, King of the Mark, the feast was more a battlefield than a banquet.\n\nSeated beside him was Loth\u00edriel, daughter of Prince Imrahil. Her gown of deep blue silk shimmered under the candlelight, and her eyes, a striking shade of grey, sparkled with mischief. \u00c9omer found himself caught between his kingly duties and the unexpected pull of her presence. His heart was a battlefield of duty and desire, each glance at Loth\u00edriel a skirmish he struggled to win.\n\n\"Is the King of Rohan always so serious, or is it just the company?\" Loth\u00edriel teased, her voice a playful melody that cut through the din of the feast. She turned to him, a subtle smile playing on her lips, and \u00c9omer felt a warmth spread across his cheeks.\n\n\"I assure you, my lady, it is not the company,\" \u00c9omer replied, attempting to match her levity. \"But it is rare for me to sit idle while others hold swords.\"\n\nLoth\u00edriel laughed, a sound that seemed to dance across the room. \u00c9omer watched her, captivated, as she reached for a buttery apple turnover from the platter before them. She held it delicately, the flaky pastry glistening in the light.\n\n\"They say,\" she began, her tone conspiratorial, \"that sharing food at a feast brings good fortune and binds destinies.\" She broke the turnover in half and offered him a piece. \"Do you believe in such superstitions, my lord?\"\n\n\u00c9omer hesitated, recalling the old tales his people whispered by the firelight. He had always been one for practicality over omens, yet there was something in Loth\u00edriel's gaze that made him reconsider.\n\n\"I have heard such tales,\" he admitted, accepting the offering. \"But I find that fate often has a mind of its own, regardless of what we share.\"\n\nLoth\u00edriel tilted her head, considering his words. \"Perhaps,\" she replied, \"but sometimes it is the smallest gestures that set the course of our lives.\"\n\n\u00c9omer took a bite of the turnover, its sweetness a surprising delight, and allowed himself a moment of vulnerability. \"And what course do you wish to set, my lady?\"\n\nShe met his gaze, her expression softening. \"One where duty does not overshadow desire, where alliances are not just of lands but of hearts.\"\n\nHer words lingered in the air, weaving a spell that \u00c9omer found difficult to break. His thoughts were a storm of conflicting loyalties, the weight of his crown heavy upon his brow. Yet, as he watched Loth\u00edriel's laughter and felt the warmth of her presence, a new resolve began to form.\n\n\"Then let us carve such a path, together,\" he said, surprising even himself with the boldness of his declaration.\n\nLoth\u00edriel's eyes widened slightly, her surprise quickly replaced by a radiant smile. \"A daring proposal, King \u00c9omer. I should warn you, I am not easily swayed.\"\n\n\"Nor am I, Princess Loth\u00edriel,\" \u00c9omer replied, his voice steady. \"Yet here we are, contemplating more than just alliances.\"\n\nThe feast continued around them, the music and merriment a backdrop to the quiet exchange that had begun to change the course of their lives. \u00c9omer found himself drawn to Loth\u00edriel's wit, her spirit, and the promise of something beyond duty\u2014a shared destiny that might intertwine their fates in ways neither had foreseen.\n\nAs the night wore on, \u00c9omer could not shake the feeling that perhaps, amidst the laughter and the buttery apple turnover, he had found not just an ally, but a partner. The stars outside shone brightly over Minas Tirith, witnessing the beginning of a new bond forged not by obligation, but by choice\u2014a choice that would echo through the halls of both kingdoms for years to come.",

Low tables, large cushions, and thick carpets were arranged with care, the linen cloths embroidered with the symbols of Rohan, and the white muslin of Gondor reflected the sunlight. Upon them lay silver platters filled with simple yet delightful fare: savory pies, salads of fresh fruit, slices of seed bread dipped in Dol Amroth's oil, portions of roast with a crisp crust, and morsels of spiced meat. Carafes of refreshing juices, white and red wine, sweet ratafia, and sparkling mead glimmered in the sun. Some elvish silk drapes had been stretched between decorated poles adorned with ribbons and red vine tendrils to provide shade for the guests.\nNot long before, the Citadel had been animated by a grand parade of Gondorian warriors, their silver armor shining beneath the warm autumn sun, and their long pikes reflecting rays of light. The Rohirrim knights had demonstrated their valor in a jousting exhibition: their powerful and agile steeds moved with perfect precision and grace, while the riders showcased their legendary equestrian mastery. Following this, the elegant knights of Dol Amroth glided onto the scene, their capes billowing like sails, as some sailors from the maritime realm displayed their skill in knot and rigging games, throwing ceremonial ropes and nets into the air, amidst the admiring applause of the spectators.\nThroughout the ceremony, \u00c9omer had maintained a composed expression, befitting a King of the Mark. Yet, every so often, his gaze inevitably slipped towards the beautiful daughter of Imrahil. Her attire, rich as befitted a princess, was of refined simplicity. The silver and blue cloak fluttered lightly in the breeze, occasionally revealing the amber skin of her shoulders, and, Bema help him, a generous portion of her collarbones. But it was Loth\u00edriel's face that truly captured \u00c9omer's attention: her bright eyes and full lips seemed to hide a secret smile.\nLoth\u00edriel, for her part, did not fail to notice the fleeting yet fervent glances the King of Rohan cast her way. She felt flattered, intrigued by the contrast between his imposing presence and the apparent shyness that shone through his gestures. Gracefully, she offered him a few subtle smiles, hoping that \u00c9omer would grasp the message hidden behind her composure. He was no Boromir, of course, and she would never forget him. However, there was something about this warrior king that reminded her of him, and she was ready to give him a chance. Her father had hinted at a promise, and Loth\u00edriel, fully aware of the role she was meant to play from birth, intended to honor it to the best of her ability. If the sovereign she was destined for was to be that proud barbarian king, well, she would not be intimidated.\nLater, after the horses and their riders had been refreshed, the foot soldiers and sailors found respite, and every noble of the court had settled at the long, informal low tables prepared for the feast, \u00c9omer was called loudly by the Dol Amrothian brothers with whom he had forged a sincere friendship as well as a steadfast military alliance. With a nod of his head, King Elassar gave his consent, and so \u00c9omer found himself seated right next to Loth\u00edriel. Perhaps it was mere coincidence, or perhaps not: Imrahil's knowing smile did not entirely escape him, making him suspect that the princess's family had orchestrated the meeting. In any case, he preferred it this way: he felt more at ease among the jovial and witty knights of Dol Amroth than among the pompous and haughty nobles of Gondor.

        "story_b": "The Great Hall of Merethrond was alive with the glow of candlelight, casting a warm shimmer over polished silverware, while the rich aroma of roasted meats mingled with the sweet scent of apple turnovers. Banners of Rohan and Gondor hung side by side, their colors bright against the stone walls, symbolizing unity and shared purpose. Laughter and music wove through the air like a tapestry of celebration, binding the two realms in joyous harmony.\n\n\u00c9omer, King of Rohan, sat at the head table, his gaze occasionally drifting across the hall to where the laughter was loudest. Yet, his attention was repeatedly drawn back to the woman seated beside him\u2014Loth\u00edriel, daughter of Imrahil. Her presence was as captivating as the night sky, her wit as sharp as the stars that adorned it. As they shared the evening meal, subtle glances and unspoken tensions danced between them, weaving a tale of possibility beneath the surface of formality.\n\n\u00c9omer found himself both comforted and unnerved by Loth\u00edriel's presence. Her eyes, a stormy grey, met his with an intensity that was both challenging and inviting. He admired her poise, the way she engaged in conversation with those around her, her laughter like a melody that lingered in his thoughts. Yet, beneath his admiration lay a growing conflict, a tug-of-war between the duties of a king and the desires of a man.\n\nAs the meal progressed, \u00c9omer, with a gesture both hesitant and hopeful, offered Loth\u00edriel a buttery apple turnover. Her fingers brushed his as she accepted it, the touch sending a ripple through the air around them. \"A taste of Gondor's finest,\" he said, a slight smile tugging at the corners of his lips.\n\nLoth\u00edriel returned his smile, her eyes twinkling with a blend of mischief and understanding. \"I have always been fond of apple turnovers,\" she replied, her voice a soft melody amidst the clamor of the feast. \"They remind me of home, yet here they carry a hint of something new.\"\n\n\u00c9omer nodded, his thoughts drifting. \"The sweetness of apples, the complexity of spices\u2014a fitting symbol for our alliance, do you not think?\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Loth\u00edriel agreed, her gaze lingering on the turnover before her. \"A blend of flavors, much like the melding of our cultures. Yet one must wonder,\" she added, her eyes meeting his with a playful challenge, \"if the sweetness will endure.\"\n\nA silence fell between them, charged with the weight of unspoken words. \u00c9omer felt the pull of her question, the underlying inquiry of whether their personal fates, like the fates of their realms, could intertwine without conflict. He marveled at her ability to speak so much with so little, to challenge him with a mere glance or a simple phrase.\n\nThe hall around them seemed to fade, the laughter and music becoming a distant echo as \u00c9omer's thoughts turned inward. He was a king, bound by duty to his people, yet here beside him was a woman who stirred something deep within him. A desire for more than duty, a yearning for a connection that transcended politics and alliances.\n\nLoth\u00edriel watched him, her gaze softening as she sensed the turmoil within him. Her own heart was not immune to the conflict of duty and desire, the path laid before her by her father's ambitions, and the path she wished to carve for herself. Yet, in \u00c9omer's presence, she found a kindred spirit, a man who understood the weight of responsibility and the longing for something beyond it.\n\nAs the feast continued, their conversation flowed like a river, sometimes swift and playful, other times deep and contemplative. They spoke of their homes, their families, their hopes for the future. And all the while, the buttery apple turnover remained a symbol between them\u2014a reminder of what could be, if only they dared to reach for it.\n\nThe night wore on, and as the feast began to wane, \u00c9omer and Loth\u00edriel found themselves lingering in their shared moment, reluctant to let it end. The tension between duty and desire hung in the air, an unresolved chord that played softly in the background of their thoughts.\n\nAs the last notes of music faded and the hall began to empty, \u00c9omer rose, offering Loth\u00edriel his arm. \"Shall I escort you to your quarters, my lady?\"\n\nShe accepted with a graceful nod, her fingers light on his arm. \"I would be honored, my lord.\"\n\nTogether they walked through the echoing corridors of Minas Tirith, the world around them both vast and intimate. And in the quiet of the night, they pondered what the future might hold, each step a silent promise of what could be, if only they dared to follow the path of their hearts.",

Realizing he had overstepped, \u00c9omer made an embarrassed grimace and replied:\n\"Please forgive my intrusion.\u201d\nIt was for this reason that \u00c9omer, to ease the atmosphere, offered her a delicacy typical of Rohan: a buttery apple turnover.\n\u201cI recall you particularly enjoyed it when you had the chance to taste it.\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel immediately understood that it was a gesture of peace, a way to apologize and to convey that his attentions were sincere. She took a bite, and when \u00c9omer saw her tongue licking the filling from her lips, he felt a shiver run down his spine. He struggled to maintain his composure, but within him, he was nearly going mad: may Bema help him, that girl would be his undoing!",
        "story_a": "The Great Hall of Meduseld was alive with laughter, the clinking of goblets, and the rich scent of roasted meats and freshly baked bread. The alliance between Rohan and Gondor had brought about a celebration the likes of which had not been seen in many years. Golden banners of the Rohirrim draped alongside the silver and white standards of Gondor, symbolizing the unity of the two great kingdoms.\n\n\u00c9omer, King of the Mark, sat at the head of the grand table, his eyes scanning the room with a mixture of pride and wariness. His gaze settled on the empty seat beside him, reserved for Loth\u00edriel, daughter of Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth. He had heard much about her\u2014her sharp mind, her beauty, and her tendency to speak her mind in ways that both intrigued and unsettled the courtiers of Gondor.\n\nAs if on cue, Loth\u00edriel entered the hall, her presence commanding immediate attention. Draped in a dress of deep blue, her dark hair fell in waves down her back, and her eyes sparkled with a mix of curiosity and mischief. She approached the table with a grace that spoke of her noble lineage, and \u00c9omer stood to greet her, his heart unexpectedly quickening.\n\n\"My lady,\" he said, offering her a polite bow.\n\n\"King \u00c9omer,\" she replied with a nod, her eyes meeting his with a boldness that caught him off guard. \"It is an honor to be seated beside you.\"\n\n\"The honor is mine,\" he said, motioning for her to sit. As they took their seats, the feast continued around them, the noise and merriment providing a backdrop to their burgeoning connection.\n\nFor a while, they exchanged pleasantries, discussing the success of the alliance and the future of their kingdoms. But there was an undercurrent to their conversation, a tension that neither could ignore. \u00c9omer found himself stealing glances at Loth\u00edriel, noting the way her eyes crinkled when she laughed and the way her fingers drummed lightly against the table when she was lost in thought.\n\nAt one point, a servant placed a platter of buttery apple turnovers before them, and Loth\u00edriel's eyes lit up with delight. \"These are my favorite,\" she confessed, reaching for one. \"My father always has the kitchens prepare them for special occasions.\"\n\n\u00c9omer smiled, taking one for himself. \"Then let us consider this a special occasion indeed,\" he said, his tone light but his gaze serious.\n\nAs they bit into the turnovers, the conversation turned more personal. Loth\u00edriel spoke of her childhood in Dol Amroth, of the sea and the freedom she felt when riding along the shores. \u00c9omer listened intently, captivated by her stories and the passion with which she told them. He shared tales of his own, of the rolling plains of Rohan and the bond between the Rohirrim and their horses.\n\n\"There is something about the open sky,\" Loth\u00edriel mused, \"that makes one feel truly alive.\"\n\n\u00c9omer nodded in agreement. \"It is the same for me. The wind in my hair, the land stretching out before me\u2014it is where I feel most at home.\"\n\nTheir eyes met, and for a moment, the rest of the hall seemed to fade away. \u00c9omer felt a pull, a connection that was more than just the alliance between their kingdoms. It was something deeper, something that neither duty nor distance could easily sever.\n\nBut as quickly as the moment came, it was interrupted by a call for a toast. \u00c9omer raised his goblet, his voice strong and clear as he spoke of the bond between Rohan and Gondor, and the hope for a future of peace and prosperity. The hall erupted in cheers, and the spell between him and Loth\u00edriel was momentarily broken.\n\nAs the night wore on, \u00c9omer and Loth\u00edriel found themselves drawn back to each other, their conversation flowing easily despite the interruptions. They spoke of dreams and fears, of the weight of their responsibilities and the desire for something more.\n\n\"Do you ever wish,\" Loth\u00edriel asked softly, \"that you could set aside the crown, even for a day, and just be yourself?\"\n\n\u00c9omer considered her question, his expression contemplative. \"There are times,\" he admitted, \"when the burden of kingship feels heavy. But it is a weight I bear willingly, for the sake of my people.\"\n\nLoth\u00edriel nodded, understanding in her eyes. \"It is the same for me. I love my family, my home, but there are moments when I long for freedom.\"\n\n\"In that, we are kindred spirits,\" \u00c9omer said, a smile tugging at his lips.\n\nAs the feast drew to a close, \u00c9omer escorted Loth\u00edriel to the doors of Meduseld. The night air was cool, and the stars shone brightly above them. They stood in silence for a moment, the weight of their unspoken feelings hanging between them.\n\n\"Thank you for a memorable evening, King \u00c9omer,\" Loth\u00edriel said, her voice soft.\n\n\"The pleasure was mine, Lady Loth\u00edriel,\" he replied, his hand lingering on hers for just a moment longer than necessary. \"Until we meet again.\"\n\n\"Until then,\" she said, her eyes holding a promise that made \u00c9omer's heart ache with a longing he could not deny.\n\nAs she walked away, \u00c9omer watched her go, knowing that their fates were now intertwined. Whether duty or desire would prevail, only time would tell. But for tonight, he allowed himself to hope.",
        "story_b": "Golden goblets gleamed under the soft candlelight, casting a warm glow over the grand hall of Merethrond in Minas Tirith. The air was filled with the scent of roasted meats and the laughter of guests, a testament to the joyous occasion celebrating the alliance between Rohan and Gondor. Yet, amidst the revelry, \u00c9omer, King of the Mark, sat in reflective silence, his gaze occasionally drifting to the enchanting woman seated beside him\u2014Loth\u00edriel, the daughter of Prince Imrahil.\n\n\u00c9omer's mind wandered as he surveyed the opulent hall. The weight of kingship rested heavily on his shoulders, his duties to Rohan ever-present in his thoughts. Yet, here, in this moment of celebration, he found himself torn between the obligations of his title and a growing desire for something more personal, something he had not expected\u2014a connection with the sharp-witted maiden by his side.\n\nLoth\u00edriel, for her part, was not content to play the role of a mere spectator. Her eyes sparkled with intelligence and mischief as she engaged in the political discussions swirling around the feast. She challenged expectations with her insightful remarks, her voice a melody that cut through the more mundane conversations. Her presence was a breath of fresh air, and \u00c9omer couldn't help but be drawn to her.\n\nTheir eyes met briefly, a silent acknowledgment passing between them. \u00c9omer felt a tug at his heart, a nostalgic yearning for connection amidst the formalities and the pomp of the feast. He cleared his throat, attempting to break the ice with a comment about the sumptuous spread before them.\n\n\"It seems the cooks outdid themselves with this feast,\" he said, gesturing toward the array of dishes. \"Though I must admit, the buttery apple turnover is a personal favorite.\"\n\nLoth\u00edriel chuckled softly, a sound that seemed to lighten the very air around them. \"Ah, the famed apple turnover of Minas Tirith. I hear it has won many a heart, yet I suspect it is the company that makes it truly delightful.\"\n\n\u00c9omer's lips curled into a smile, appreciating her playful banter. \"Then I am fortunate indeed to have such company.\"\n\nTheir exchange, though lighthearted, carried a depth that neither could ignore. They continued to speak, their conversation weaving between topics of politics and personal aspirations. Loth\u00edriel shared her hopes for a future where Gondor and Rohan stood united, not just through alliances but through understanding and friendship.\n\n\u00c9omer listened intently, captivated by her eloquence and vision. He found himself sharing his own dreams for Rohan\u2014a land of rolling hills and fierce warriors, yet also a place of peace and prosperity. As they spoke, the flickering candlelight seemed to mirror \u00c9omer's flickering resolve, caught between duty and the desire to explore this newfound connection.\n\nThe feast continued around them, a tapestry of cultural vibrancy. The guests were adorned in traditional attire, the men in richly embroidered tunics and the women in gowns that shimmered like the stars above. Music filled the air, a harmonious blend of Rohan's robust melodies and Gondor's elegant symphonies.\n\nIn a moment of quiet, \u00c9omer turned to Loth\u00edriel, his voice softened by sincerity. \"I find myself at a crossroads, torn between what is expected of me as King and what my heart desires. Yet in your company, I see a path that could lead to both.\"\n\nLoth\u00edriel met his gaze, her eyes reflecting a similar longing. \"And I, too, find myself intrigued by a future where duty and desire need not be at odds.\"\n\nTheir conversation had evolved from playful exchanges to a deeper understanding, a shared acknowledgment of the potential that lay before them. In that moment, \u00c9omer and Loth\u00edriel found a sense of reconciliation, a mutual recognition of their burgeoning interest.\n\nAs the feast drew to a close, \u00c9omer knew that the path ahead was not without its challenges. Yet, with Loth\u00edriel by his side, he felt a renewed sense of hope. Together, they could forge a bond that transcended mere political alliances\u2014a bond built on friendship, respect, and perhaps something even greater.\n\nWith a final glance at the buttery apple turnover, \u00c9omer rose from his seat, offering Loth\u00edriel his hand. She accepted with grace, her touch a promise of things to come. And as they left the grand hall, the future stretched out before them, a dance of shadows and light, filled with the promise of a shared destiny.",

        "ground_truth": "Some days or weeks or months or years before Mom died, I got her laughing about the Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that bad,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat one guy had a bag of meth,\u201d I told her.\n\n\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t smoke it,\u201d she responded. \u201cHe kept it in his pocket.\u201d\n\nTrue. He didn\u2019t. But even if he did, I don\u2019t think the night could have been any worse.\n\nMom was living in a house with several apartments in Bangor, Maine, at the time. Before living there, she lived in the town next over for seven years, but due to her drinking and her temper, got evicted, which is how she ended up in Bangor\u2014in a housing complex for Native tenants only. Mom tried so hard\u2014so, so hard\u2014to stay sober. And she did, occasionally. Weeks and months would go by when I don\u2019t think she was drinking. Or if she was, she had learned to control her temper. And it was around the time of that Thanksgiving\u2014the Thanksgiving\u2014when she had been sober. Clearheaded. When she called me, she no longer asked for money, asked for rides, asked for a pack of cigarettes. I want to say she was loving and caring and motherly, but even when she drank, she was those things too. I suppose she was just better. And that\u2019s why, when she said she wanted to host Thanksgiving, I was excited. Jess, my sister, was getting out of prison\u2014she served a one-year sentence for theft, on top of priors. According to an article in the local paper, which Mom had cut out and taped on the fridge next to an article about an award I won, Jess had been one of \u201cthree arrested after chicken, potatoes, vodka stolen from grocer,\u201d and she would be there. I was busy with something the day before Thanksgiving when my sister was released, and I told Mom I couldn\u2019t go with her to get Jess at the bus stop, so I didn\u2019t get to see her take her first step off the bus into the free world. My sister and I had written once a month for the year she was in prison. The only thing I remembered from the letters was that my sister\u2019s walking partner was Roxanne Jeskey, a woman convicted of torturing and murdering her husband with a wooden towel rack with nails protruding, needle-nose pliers, and a metal broom handle. Jess said that Roxanne was a good lady. In a text I sent Jess\u2014to make sure I was right that this was true\u2014she wrote back: \u201cShe was a very sweet little old lady who encouraged me to walk with her outside every day to feel better! There I am only doing a year and super depressed and that poor lady had life!\u201d\n\nA very sweet little old lady!\n\nWhile I couldn\u2019t pick my sister up at the bus stop with my mom, I reassured her I\u2019d be at Thanksgiving. Mom was so excited to have her son and daughter together, and part of that excitement, I think, came from the fact that she was sober and so was my sister. Hell, that got me excited too\u2014the first Thanksgiving, far as I can remember, with a sober mother and a sober sister. I imagined it would be a quiet gathering. We\u2019d be in Mom\u2019s cluttered bedroom in her tiny apartment filled with stale cigarette smoke while we sat on the bed and ate turkey, scalloped potatoes, green beans, bread, and cranberry sauce, and along the way Mom would turn down her TV\u2014she\u2019d be watching The Real Housewives of some fucking county\u2014so we could hear each other chew and talk. And in between bites of food we\u2019d ask Jess about prison, and she\u2019d crack jokes, and eventually we would ask her what Roxanne was really like, and Jess would say, Yeah, she told me after she cut off her husband\u2019s penis that she held it over her head and spun it around, pretending to escape the police in a penis-propelled helicopter, and then we\u2019d all laugh and Jess would say, No, no, she was a very nice lady, always asked me how I was doing, and then Jess would get up and ask us if we wanted more cranberry sauce and while she was in the kitchen she\u2019d wonder why Mom never wrote to her.\n\nBut that\u2019s too perfect, right? At least for our family it is.\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day, I got to Mom\u2019s around four in the afternoon. The driveway, which dipped down into a hill, was slick and icy, and so when I parked, I pulled up my emergency brake. I got out and looked up at the second floor, where Mom\u2019s apartment was. A light was on, the window open, and I heard their voices.\n\nThe stairs to Mom\u2019s apartment were narrow and twisty\u2014it\u2019s hyperbole to compare them to the Stairs of Cirith Ungol, but I bet Mom would find that true since she had terrible arthritis and a rod in her leg and that climb was tough\u2014and I climbed them to the top. The door was locked, so I knocked. No answer, but I heard them talking and then laughing. I knocked again, louder, and when the door swung open there was Jess\u2019s ex-boyfriend, Dan. Dan was really good at dumpster diving. He lived in a tent behind Hobby Lobby, even in the winter. Jess lived there too sometimes.\n\nDan was nice. Or so he seemed. I suppose I can say he was one of the nicer men my sister dated, one of the nicer men my sister loved.\n\nHe smiled at me\u2014all but one tooth straight\u2014and he ushered me into the living room, where Mom stood with an apron on and an unlit cigarette between her fingers. Jess was on the floor, cans of Natty Daddies surrounding her like a wall, a fortress, and she got up and from the floor and gave me a beery hug.\n\n\u201cHi, honey,\u201d Mom said, and she told me to follow her into the small kitchen.\n\nMom stirred gravy on the stove. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019s drinking,\u201d she said. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Next to the stove was a cup with tinfoil folded over the top like a lid, a pink bendy straw pierced through it. Did Mom really not know we all knew that\u2019s how she drank? How she tried to hide it?\n\n\u201cRight when she got off the bus,\u201d Mom said, stirring, \u201cshe said she was going to get drunk. Whatever. She\u2019s a grown woman.\u201d\n\nShe drank from the cup with the straw.\n\nThe excitement I felt didn\u2019t immediately turn to disappointment. It was gradual. Sure, it started with seeing my sister\u2019s year of sobriety disappear, started by seeing Dan\u2014yeah, he was nice, but my sister could do better than a guy who lived in a tent behind Hobby Lobby\u2014started by seeing Mom pick up a drink. But the real disappointment came when more guests showed up.\n\nThree, to be exact.\n\nFirst there was Jeremy, a man in his thirties who my mom met at the methadone clinic (she always said she went for pain management, and in a way that\u2019s the truth).\n\n\u201cGod bless you,\u201d she said to him when he showed up with a can of cranberry sauce.\n\n\u201cThis your son?\u201d he asked.\n\nSecond, there was a tall older man, standing behind Jeremy. I can\u2019t remember who the hell he was. He was either a former priest or a pastor, but what I do know is that at that time, he was looking after Jeremy and his sobriety.\n\nThird and finally was the last person I expected: the schizophrenic woman who lived three houses down and who always\u2014and I mean always\u2014stood outside in the middle of the yard smoking.\n\n\u201cLiza, dear,\u201d Mom said. \u201cYou came.\u201d\n\nLiza\u2019s voice was raspy. \u201cYou got a cigarette?\u201d\n\nMom\u2019s apartment was already small to begin with, but just then it felt even smaller. In the living room, I stood while Jess and Dan drank and laughed on the floor, while Liza stood looking out the window, smoking, while Jeremy kept asking my mother if she needed help with anything in the kitchen, and while the priest smiled at us, all of us, a tribe of misfits and nutjobs and criminals and addicts and weirdos, myself included.\n\n\u201cBaby brother,\u201d my sister said, and I sat with her on the floor, even though she had that nasty booze breath, even though I was unhappy with her choices right then, because that\u2019s what you do when you love someone.\n\n\u201cDid you know,\u201d my sister said, not to me but to the room, \u201cdid you know that my baby brother wrote me all the time while I was in prison. And he sent me books and put money in my commissary.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust wonderful!\u201d the priest exclaimed. \u201cJust absolutely wonderful!\u201d\n\nMom cooked. Jess kept me on the floor with her and Dan. Liza continued to stand by the window. Jeremy moved between room and room, unable to commit to one place. And the priest kept on smiling.\n\nIt\u2019s moments like these, I realize now, with people like us, when the world and the lives within it are at their truest.\n\nEventually the food was ready, which Mom announced, that cigarette in her hand still unlit. But nobody moved. Jess and Dan stayed on the floor, drinking. Jeremy\u2014who had asked me more than once if I\u2019d seen a plastic bag filled with white glass beads\u2014couldn\u2019t stand still. Liza was no longer near the window but was in the middle of the living room, staring at Mom, who was in the hallway, waiting for people to come get food. The priest seemed the readiest to eat\u2014he was moving toward the kitchen with such conviction.\n\nThere was no line or anything\u2014we all just crammed ourselves into the kitchen, the very one Mom died hating because there was no sideboard space. It smelled like cooked meat and potatoes and the sweetness of warmed-up cranberry sauce and booze. Mom picked up a dull serrated blade.\n\n\u201cHappy Turkey Day,\u201d she said, and with the dull knife she tried to cut the turkey\u2019s tied feet. She drew the blade back and forth, back and forth, like the string was a giant log, the knife a bow saw, trying to get through it. My sister laughed. \u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Mom said, and then with such force she got the string cut and you\u2019d think tension would dissolve right then but it didn\u2019t and cooked bird juice and grease and fat flew and splattered all over the wall.\n\nMom licked turkey juice off her fingers and carved the turkey. \u201cHelp yourselves,\u201d she said. We all had plates except Liza. \u201cLiza, honey, do you want me to make you a plate?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got a cigarette?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Mom mumbled.\n\nAfter we all ate\u2014except for my mom, who always ate later, and for Liza, who just smoked her cigarette\u2014I told Mom I had to get going. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you down,\u201d she said, taking her apron off. My sister and I didn\u2019t say goodbye, because it wasn\u2019t goodbye for us\u2014we\u2019d see each other in a day or two or three.\n\nI helped Mom down the narrow and steep stairs, made sure she didn\u2019t fall, and outside she zipped up her jacket and lit a smoke. The sky was clear\u2014I remember that\u2014the night made brighter by the winter moon and stars burning so far away, a distance I sometimes felt with my mom but not right then.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe she drank,\u201d Mom was saying, and judging by the face I made she must have known I knew that she too drank. \u201cI had one drink,\u201d she confessed. \u201cBut I can have a drink, can\u2019t I?\u2019\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, lying, because one wouldn\u2019t be enough. But sometimes you know you just can\u2019t fight the person you love. Love. That\u2019s what that Thanksgiving was full of. Mom made sure I knew that years later, when one time we were again laughing about that night, she said to me, \u201cHoney, to those people, it was a good Thanksgiving, because they were invited. Because they had a place to be and they felt welcomed.\u201d\n\nThat night, in the driveway with her, getting ready to leave, that was what I felt, even though I couldn\u2019t name the feeling.\n\nWe stood there, Mom and I, and after I hugged her goodbye and thanked her for dinner\u2014to which she said, \u201cOf course, my honey\u201d\u2014she scraped her half-smoked cigarette across the icy snow, and I didn\u2019t leave the driveway until I saw she\u2019d made it safely back inside.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The scent of rosemary and thyme wafted through the air, mingling with the sharp tang of cranberry sauce and the buttery richness of mashed potatoes. The kitchen was a cacophony of clattering dishes, beeping timers, and the low hum of the oven. Amelia stood at the stove, stirring a pot of gravy with one hand while balancing a phone against her ear with the other.\n\n\"Yes, Mom, I know. I remember the recipe,\" she said, her voice strained but affectionate. \"I've made it a hundred times.\"\n\nHer mother\u2019s voice crackled through the line, insistent and slightly panicked. \"But don\u2019t forget the secret ingredient. Your father always loved it that way.\"\n\nAmelia sighed, glancing at the recipe card propped up against the backsplash. The familiar scrawl of her father's handwriting was both comforting and heart-wrenching. \"I won't forget, promise.\"\n\nShe hung up, setting the phone down on the counter, and took a deep breath. The house was filled with the noise of family, each room echoing with laughter, arguments, and the occasional burst of music from the living room where her younger cousins were attempting a dance-off. It was Thanksgiving, and the Daniels family was in full swing.\n\nAmelia\u2019s brother, Jake, appeared in the doorway, his hands laden with a tray of deviled eggs. \"Need any help in here?\" he asked, though his tone suggested he hoped the answer was no.\n\nShe gave him a wry smile. \"Always. Can you check on the turkey?\"\n\nJake set the tray down and moved to the oven, peering through the glass. \"Looks good. Smells even better.\"\n\nAs he straightened, their eyes met, and for a moment, the chaos around them faded. They had grown up in this house, the walls steeped in memories of holidays past. Their father\u2019s absence was a palpable void, but they had learned to fill it with new traditions, new laughter.\n\n\"How\u2019s Mom holding up?\" Jake asked, his voice softer now.\n\n\"She\u2019s... managing,\" Amelia replied. \"Called me three times already to remind me about the gravy.\"\n\nJake chuckled, but it was tinged with sadness. \"Some things never change.\"\n\nThey worked in tandem, the rhythm of their movements a testament to years of shared experience. Amelia finished the gravy, and Jake basted the turkey, their unspoken coordination a comfort amidst the noise.\n\nIn the living room, their cousin Lizzie was arguing with her husband, Mark, over the volume of the TV. \"I told you, it\u2019s too loud! Grandma can\u2019t hear herself think,\" Lizzie snapped, grabbing the remote from his hand.\n\nMark threw up his hands in exasperation. \"Fine! Turn it off, then. See if I care.\"\n\nTheir grandmother, seated in her favorite armchair, watched the exchange with mild amusement. \"Oh, let them be, Lizzie. It\u2019s a holiday. We\u2019re supposed to be having fun.\"\n\nLizzie huffed but relented, muting the TV and turning her attention back to her children, who were now engaged in a heated debate over the last piece of pumpkin pie.\n\nAmelia stepped into the room, wiping her hands on a dishtowel. \"Alright, everyone, dinner\u2019s almost ready. Can we try to get along for five minutes?\"\n\nHer plea was met with a chorus of good-natured grumbles and a few teasing remarks. She couldn\u2019t help but smile. This was her family, chaotic and dysfunctional, but undeniably bound by love.\n\nAs they gathered around the table, Amelia felt a pang of nostalgia. The seats were filled, but there was an emptiness that no amount of food or laughter could dispel. Her father\u2019s chair, now occupied by her mother, seemed to hold a silent vigil for the man who had once been the heart of these gatherings.\n\nHer mother raised her glass, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. \"To family,\" she said, her voice wavering but strong. \"And to those who are no longer with us, but whose love still fills this room.\"\n\nGlasses clinked, and for a moment, there was a hush, a collective breath held in remembrance. Then the spell was broken, and the room erupted into conversation and laughter once more.\n\nAmelia watched her family, her heart swelling with a mixture of pride and sorrow. They were messy, imperfect, but they were hers. In the midst of the noise and the arguments, the love that tied them together was unbreakable.\n\nAs the night wore on, the stories flowed as freely as the wine. Tales of childhood mischief, of triumphs and failures, of moments that had shaped them into who they were. Amelia listened, laughed, and shared, feeling the weight of the past and the promise of the future in every word.\n\nIt was late when the doorbell rang, a sharp, unexpected sound that cut through the merriment. Amelia frowned, exchanging a puzzled glance with Jake. \"Who could that be?\"\n\nShe rose from her seat, weaving through the crowded room to the front door. When she opened it, she found herself face to face with a young woman, her hair damp from the rain, a hesitant smile on her lips.\n\n\"Hi,\" the woman said, her voice soft but steady. \"I\u2019m sorry to intrude. My name is Emily. I think... I think I might be your sister.\"\n\nThe room behind Amelia fell silent, all eyes turning toward the door. She felt the world tilt beneath her feet, the ground shifting in ways she could not yet comprehend.\n\n\"Sister?\" she echoed, her mind racing. \"How...?\"\n\nEmily took a deep breath, her eyes searching Amelia\u2019s face. \"I was adopted. I\u2019ve been looking for my birth family for a while now. I didn\u2019t mean to just show up like this, but... it\u2019s Thanksgiving. And I didn\u2019t want to be alone.\"\n\nAmelia\u2019s heart ached at the vulnerability in Emily\u2019s voice, the quiet plea for connection. She glanced back at her family, seeing the shock and curiosity mirrored in their expressions. Her mother\u2019s hand covered her mouth, her eyes wide and brimming with tears.\n\n\"Come in,\" Amelia said, stepping aside to let Emily enter. \"You\u2019re not alone anymore.\"\n\nThe room seemed to hold its breath as Emily stepped inside, her eyes darting around, taking in the faces that were both familiar and strange. Jake was the first to move, crossing the room to offer a tentative smile.\n\n\"Hi, Emily,\" he said, his voice warm. \"I\u2019m Jake. Welcome to the family.\"\n\nOne by one, they introduced themselves, the initial shock giving way to a cautious curiosity. Emily\u2019s presence was a ripple in the fabric of their lives, a new thread woven into the tapestry of their story.\n\nAmelia watched as her mother approached Emily, her hands trembling. \"I... I never knew,\" she whispered, her voice breaking. \"I\u2019m so sorry.\"\n\nEmily shook her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. \"It\u2019s okay. I just... I wanted to know where I came from. To find my roots.\"\n\nHer mother pulled her into a tight embrace, the years of separation and silence dissolving in the warmth of that hug. Amelia felt her own tears spill over, the weight of the moment pressing down on her.\n\nThey gathered around the table once more, making room for Emily, who sat between Jake and their grandmother. The conversation resumed, tentative at first, but soon the laughter and the stories flowed again, now with a new participant.\n\nEmily shared her own story, of her search for her birth family, of the life she had built for herself. Her words were met with encouragement, with acceptance, with love. The Daniels family had always been a patchwork quilt of personalities and histories, and Emily was now a part of that intricate design.\n\nAs the night drew to a close, Amelia found herself standing on the porch, the cool night air a welcome respite from the warmth of the house. Emily joined her, her eyes reflecting the glow of the porch light.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Emily said quietly. \"For welcoming me.\"\n\nAmelia smiled, reaching out to squeeze her hand. \"You\u2019re family. That\u2019s what we do.\"\n\nThey stood in silence for a moment, the weight of the day settling around them. Amelia felt a sense of peace, a quiet certainty that, despite the chaos and the dysfunction, they had found something beautiful. Connection, belonging, love\u2014these were the threads that held them together, even in the most unexpected moments.\n\nAs they turned to go back inside, Amelia knew that this Thanksgiving would be one they would all remember. It was a reminder that family was not just about blood, but about the bonds they chose to forge, the love they chose to give.\n\nAnd in that chaotic, imperfect, wonderful gathering, they had found a deeper truth about what it meant to belong.",
        "story_b": "I realized I had forgotten my mother's birthday as I stepped into the kitchen, the scent of burnt toast and the shrill beep of a smoke detector greeting me like an unwelcome alarm clock. Panic set in as I scrambled to organize a last-minute family dinner, a frantic whirlwind of phone calls and hasty promises. My mother, bless her heart, pretended not to care, but I knew better. Birthdays were a big deal in our family, a tradition that, despite its imperfections, held us together like the glue on a hastily mended teacup.\n\nBy midday, the chaos had begun to unfold, each family member arriving with their own brand of eccentricity. The living room was a chaotic symphony of mismatched furniture and family photos, a nostalgia-tinged backdrop for what promised to be an evening of love and dysfunction.\n\nMy brother, Jake, was the first to arrive, his arms laden with grocery bags filled with everything but what we'd actually need. He grinned sheepishly, his eyes twinkling with mischief. \"I brought chips, dip, and...a pineapple?\" he said, holding up the spiky fruit like a trophy.\n\n\"Great, Jake. Exactly what we need for dinner,\" I replied, rolling my eyes but smiling despite myself. Jake had always been the joker, the one who could lighten any mood with his antics.\n\nNext came Aunt Linda, her perfume wafting in before she did, an overpowering floral scent that clung to everything it touched. She swept into the room like a force of nature, her voice a booming reminder of her presence. \"Happy birthday, dear sister!\" she exclaimed, enveloping my mother in a hug that looked more like a wrestling hold.\n\n\"Linda, you're crushing me,\" my mother gasped, patting her sister's back awkwardly.\n\n\"Oh, nonsense! You love my hugs,\" Linda declared, releasing her grip to inspect the room with a critical eye. \"I see you still haven't redecorated, dear. This couch is practically an antique!\"\n\n\"It's a family heirloom,\" my mother retorted, a hint of pride in her voice. The couch, with its faded floral print and sagging cushions, was indeed a relic of our family's past, a symbol of our imperfect but enduring bond.\n\nAs the afternoon wore on, more relatives trickled in, each one adding to the cacophony of voices and clinking dishes that filled the house. My cousin Sarah arrived with her newborn, a squalling bundle of joy who seemed determined to out-sing the smoke detector. My father shuffled in behind her, carrying a cake that looked suspiciously lopsided.\n\n\"Happy birthday, honey,\" he said, placing the cake on the kitchen counter. \"I might have hit a pothole on the way over.\"\n\n\"You think?\" I said, eyeing the cake, which now resembled the Leaning Tower of Pisa.\n\nDespite the mishaps, the gathering was starting to resemble a celebration, the living room buzzing with conversation and laughter. Jake had set up a makeshift bar in the corner, mixing drinks with the enthusiasm of a mad scientist. Aunt Linda was regaling anyone who'd listen with tales of her latest cruise, while my father attempted to salvage the cake with a liberal application of whipped cream.\n\nIt was during one of these moments, just as I was starting to feel the warmth of family envelop me like a cozy blanket, that the first real mishap occurred. Jake, in an attempt to showcase his bartending prowess, accidentally knocked over a bottle of red wine, the contents cascading over the tablecloth like a crimson waterfall.\n\n\"Oops,\" he said, looking genuinely apologetic for once.\n\n\"Jake!\" my mother exclaimed, rushing to blot the stain with napkins. \"This is your grandmother's tablecloth!\"\n\n\"Sorry, Mom. I'll fix it, I promise,\" Jake said, dabbing at the spill with little success.\n\nIn the midst of the chaos, I noticed my grandmother quietly observing from her usual spot by the window. Her eyes, sharp and discerning, missed nothing. She'd been a silent witness to our family's trials and triumphs, her presence a constant reminder of the generations that had come before us.\n\n\"Grandma,\" I said, sidling up to her. \"Are you okay?\"\n\nShe nodded, a soft smile playing on her lips. \"I'm fine, dear. Just watching you all. It's quite a show.\"\n\nI chuckled, taking her hand in mine. \"It always is, isn't it?\"\n\nThe evening progressed with its usual blend of humor and tension, each incident bringing out different family dynamics. At one point, Sarah attempted to pass her baby to Jake, who recoiled as if she'd handed him a ticking time bomb.\n\n\"Uh, no thanks, Sarah. I'm better with bottles,\" he quipped, gesturing to his makeshift bar.\n\n\"Typical,\" Sarah retorted, rolling her eyes but laughing nonetheless.\n\nAs the dinner hour approached, the kitchen became a hive of activity, each family member contributing to the meal in their own way. My mother fretted over the turkey, which seemed determined to remain stubbornly undercooked, while Aunt Linda hovered, offering unsolicited advice.\n\n\"You know, if you basted it with a bit of sherry, it would cook faster,\" she suggested, peering over my mother's shoulder.\n\n\"Linda, if you want sherry in your turkey, you're welcome to make your own,\" my mother replied, her patience wearing thin.\n\n\"Fine, fine. Just trying to help,\" Linda said, raising her hands in mock surrender.\n\nThe turkey eventually emerged from the oven, golden and steaming, a testament to my mother's culinary perseverance. We gathered around the table, a hodgepodge of chairs pulled from every corner of the house, the room filled with the scent of roasted meat and familial anticipation.\n\nAs the meal began, the conversations flowed freely, a tapestry of stories and laughter woven together over plates of food. Jake, emboldened by a few too many cocktails, stood to make a toast, his glass wobbling precariously in his hand.\n\n\"To Mom,\" he said, his voice slurring slightly. \"The best mom anyone could ask for, even if she does hold a grudge like nobody's business.\"\n\n\"Jake!\" my mother exclaimed, half-laughing, half-scolding.\n\n\"What? It's true!\" Jake protested, grinning unabashedly.\n\nThe toast, intended as a joke, revealed an underlying truth about our family. We loved fiercely, but our grudges were just as tenacious, a tangled web of love and resentment that both pulled us closer and pushed us apart.\n\nAs the meal wound down, my father disappeared into the kitchen, returning with the lopsided cake, now adorned with a haphazard array of candles. We sang \"Happy Birthday\" with gusto, our voices a joyful cacophony that echoed off the walls.\n\nThe cake, despite its appearance, was delicious, its sweetness a fitting end to the evening's festivities. As we settled into the living room, cups of coffee and tea in hand, the conversation turned to memories of past birthdays, each story a thread in the tapestry of our family's history.\n\nIt was then that my grandmother spoke, her voice soft but clear. \"Do you remember the year we went to the lake for your birthday?\" she asked my mother, a twinkle in her eye.\n\nMy mother laughed, nodding. \"How could I forget? Jake fell in and nearly drowned.\"\n\n\"I was pushed,\" Jake interjected, feigning indignation.\n\n\"You tripped over your own feet,\" Sarah countered, shaking her head.\n\nThe memory, like so many others, was a blend of humor and chaos, a reminder of the love that bound us despite our flaws. As the evening drew to a close, and the family began to disperse, I felt a sense of contentment settle over me, a warmth that lingered like the fading glow of the candles on my mother's cake.\n\nIn the aftermath of the gathering, as I surveyed the mess left behind, I realized that the evening's chaos had revealed something profound about our family. We were imperfect, a collection of mismatched pieces held together by love and shared history. Our gatherings, with all their mishaps and laughter, were a testament to our connection and belonging, a reminder that even in dysfunction, there was beauty.\n\nAs I began to clean up, my grandmother joined me, her presence a comforting balm against the quiet that had settled over the house.\n\n\"You did well, dear,\" she said, her voice gentle.\n\n\"Thanks, Grandma,\" I replied, feeling a swell of gratitude for her unwavering support.\n\nAs we worked together, I felt the weight of our family's legacy, a tapestry of memories and traditions that bound us together. The evening had been a symphony of chaos, but it was our chaos, a reflection of the love and dysfunction that defined us.\n\nIn the end, it was the unexpected moments, the spilled wine and the lopsided cake, that had revealed the deepest truths about our family. We were a tangled web of love and resentment, each thread pulling us closer and pushing us apart, but in that complexity, there was a beauty that was uniquely ours.\n\nAs the last dish was washed and the lights dimmed, I felt a sense of peace, a quiet understanding that despite the chaos, or perhaps because of it, I belonged. And in that belonging, there was love.",

        "ground_truth": "Some days or weeks or months or years before Mom died, I got her laughing about the Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that bad,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat one guy had a bag of meth,\u201d I told her.\n\n\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t smoke it,\u201d she responded. \u201cHe kept it in his pocket.\u201d\n\nTrue. He didn\u2019t. But even if he did, I don\u2019t think the night could have been any worse.\n\nMom was living in a house with several apartments in Bangor, Maine, at the time. Before living there, she lived in the town next over for seven years, but due to her drinking and her temper, got evicted, which is how she ended up in Bangor\u2014in a housing complex for Native tenants only. Mom tried so hard\u2014so, so hard\u2014to stay sober. And she did, occasionally. Weeks and months would go by when I don\u2019t think she was drinking. Or if she was, she had learned to control her temper. And it was around the time of that Thanksgiving\u2014the Thanksgiving\u2014when she had been sober. Clearheaded. When she called me, she no longer asked for money, asked for rides, asked for a pack of cigarettes. I want to say she was loving and caring and motherly, but even when she drank, she was those things too. I suppose she was just better. And that\u2019s why, when she said she wanted to host Thanksgiving, I was excited. Jess, my sister, was getting out of prison\u2014she served a one-year sentence for theft, on top of priors. According to an article in the local paper, which Mom had cut out and taped on the fridge next to an article about an award I won, Jess had been one of \u201cthree arrested after chicken, potatoes, vodka stolen from grocer,\u201d and she would be there. I was busy with something the day before Thanksgiving when my sister was released, and I told Mom I couldn\u2019t go with her to get Jess at the bus stop, so I didn\u2019t get to see her take her first step off the bus into the free world. My sister and I had written once a month for the year she was in prison. The only thing I remembered from the letters was that my sister\u2019s walking partner was Roxanne Jeskey, a woman convicted of torturing and murdering her husband with a wooden towel rack with nails protruding, needle-nose pliers, and a metal broom handle. Jess said that Roxanne was a good lady. In a text I sent Jess\u2014to make sure I was right that this was true\u2014she wrote back: \u201cShe was a very sweet little old lady who encouraged me to walk with her outside every day to feel better! There I am only doing a year and super depressed and that poor lady had life!\u201d\n\nA very sweet little old lady!\n\nWhile I couldn\u2019t pick my sister up at the bus stop with my mom, I reassured her I\u2019d be at Thanksgiving. Mom was so excited to have her son and daughter together, and part of that excitement, I think, came from the fact that she was sober and so was my sister. Hell, that got me excited too\u2014the first Thanksgiving, far as I can remember, with a sober mother and a sober sister. I imagined it would be a quiet gathering. We\u2019d be in Mom\u2019s cluttered bedroom in her tiny apartment filled with stale cigarette smoke while we sat on the bed and ate turkey, scalloped potatoes, green beans, bread, and cranberry sauce, and along the way Mom would turn down her TV\u2014she\u2019d be watching The Real Housewives of some fucking county\u2014so we could hear each other chew and talk. And in between bites of food we\u2019d ask Jess about prison, and she\u2019d crack jokes, and eventually we would ask her what Roxanne was really like, and Jess would say, Yeah, she told me after she cut off her husband\u2019s penis that she held it over her head and spun it around, pretending to escape the police in a penis-propelled helicopter, and then we\u2019d all laugh and Jess would say, No, no, she was a very nice lady, always asked me how I was doing, and then Jess would get up and ask us if we wanted more cranberry sauce and while she was in the kitchen she\u2019d wonder why Mom never wrote to her.\n\nBut that\u2019s too perfect, right? At least for our family it is.\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day, I got to Mom\u2019s around four in the afternoon. The driveway, which dipped down into a hill, was slick and icy, and so when I parked, I pulled up my emergency brake. I got out and looked up at the second floor, where Mom\u2019s apartment was. A light was on, the window open, and I heard their voices.\n\nThe stairs to Mom\u2019s apartment were narrow and twisty\u2014it\u2019s hyperbole to compare them to the Stairs of Cirith Ungol, but I bet Mom would find that true since she had terrible arthritis and a rod in her leg and that climb was tough\u2014and I climbed them to the top. The door was locked, so I knocked. No answer, but I heard them talking and then laughing. I knocked again, louder, and when the door swung open there was Jess\u2019s ex-boyfriend, Dan. Dan was really good at dumpster diving. He lived in a tent behind Hobby Lobby, even in the winter. Jess lived there too sometimes.\n\nDan was nice. Or so he seemed. I suppose I can say he was one of the nicer men my sister dated, one of the nicer men my sister loved.\n\nHe smiled at me\u2014all but one tooth straight\u2014and he ushered me into the living room, where Mom stood with an apron on and an unlit cigarette between her fingers. Jess was on the floor, cans of Natty Daddies surrounding her like a wall, a fortress, and she got up and from the floor and gave me a beery hug.\n\n\u201cHi, honey,\u201d Mom said, and she told me to follow her into the small kitchen.\n\nMom stirred gravy on the stove. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019s drinking,\u201d she said. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Next to the stove was a cup with tinfoil folded over the top like a lid, a pink bendy straw pierced through it. Did Mom really not know we all knew that\u2019s how she drank? How she tried to hide it?\n\n\u201cRight when she got off the bus,\u201d Mom said, stirring, \u201cshe said she was going to get drunk. Whatever. She\u2019s a grown woman.\u201d\n\nShe drank from the cup with the straw.\n\nThe excitement I felt didn\u2019t immediately turn to disappointment. It was gradual. Sure, it started with seeing my sister\u2019s year of sobriety disappear, started by seeing Dan\u2014yeah, he was nice, but my sister could do better than a guy who lived in a tent behind Hobby Lobby\u2014started by seeing Mom pick up a drink. But the real disappointment came when more guests showed up.\n\nThree, to be exact.\n\nFirst there was Jeremy, a man in his thirties who my mom met at the methadone clinic (she always said she went for pain management, and in a way that\u2019s the truth).\n\n\u201cGod bless you,\u201d she said to him when he showed up with a can of cranberry sauce.\n\n\u201cThis your son?\u201d he asked.\n\nSecond, there was a tall older man, standing behind Jeremy. I can\u2019t remember who the hell he was. He was either a former priest or a pastor, but what I do know is that at that time, he was looking after Jeremy and his sobriety.\n\nThird and finally was the last person I expected: the schizophrenic woman who lived three houses down and who always\u2014and I mean always\u2014stood outside in the middle of the yard smoking.\n\n\u201cLiza, dear,\u201d Mom said. \u201cYou came.\u201d\n\nLiza\u2019s voice was raspy. \u201cYou got a cigarette?\u201d\n\nMom\u2019s apartment was already small to begin with, but just then it felt even smaller. In the living room, I stood while Jess and Dan drank and laughed on the floor, while Liza stood looking out the window, smoking, while Jeremy kept asking my mother if she needed help with anything in the kitchen, and while the priest smiled at us, all of us, a tribe of misfits and nutjobs and criminals and addicts and weirdos, myself included.\n\n\u201cBaby brother,\u201d my sister said, and I sat with her on the floor, even though she had that nasty booze breath, even though I was unhappy with her choices right then, because that\u2019s what you do when you love someone.\n\n\u201cDid you know,\u201d my sister said, not to me but to the room, \u201cdid you know that my baby brother wrote me all the time while I was in prison. And he sent me books and put money in my commissary.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust wonderful!\u201d the priest exclaimed. \u201cJust absolutely wonderful!\u201d\n\nMom cooked. Jess kept me on the floor with her and Dan. Liza continued to stand by the window. Jeremy moved between room and room, unable to commit to one place. And the priest kept on smiling.\n\nIt\u2019s moments like these, I realize now, with people like us, when the world and the lives within it are at their truest.\n\nEventually the food was ready, which Mom announced, that cigarette in her hand still unlit. But nobody moved. Jess and Dan stayed on the floor, drinking. Jeremy\u2014who had asked me more than once if I\u2019d seen a plastic bag filled with white glass beads\u2014couldn\u2019t stand still. Liza was no longer near the window but was in the middle of the living room, staring at Mom, who was in the hallway, waiting for people to come get food. The priest seemed the readiest to eat\u2014he was moving toward the kitchen with such conviction.\n\nThere was no line or anything\u2014we all just crammed ourselves into the kitchen, the very one Mom died hating because there was no sideboard space. It smelled like cooked meat and potatoes and the sweetness of warmed-up cranberry sauce and booze. Mom picked up a dull serrated blade.\n\n\u201cHappy Turkey Day,\u201d she said, and with the dull knife she tried to cut the turkey\u2019s tied feet. She drew the blade back and forth, back and forth, like the string was a giant log, the knife a bow saw, trying to get through it. My sister laughed. \u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Mom said, and then with such force she got the string cut and you\u2019d think tension would dissolve right then but it didn\u2019t and cooked bird juice and grease and fat flew and splattered all over the wall.\n\nMom licked turkey juice off her fingers and carved the turkey. \u201cHelp yourselves,\u201d she said. We all had plates except Liza. \u201cLiza, honey, do you want me to make you a plate?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got a cigarette?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Mom mumbled.\n\nAfter we all ate\u2014except for my mom, who always ate later, and for Liza, who just smoked her cigarette\u2014I told Mom I had to get going. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you down,\u201d she said, taking her apron off. My sister and I didn\u2019t say goodbye, because it wasn\u2019t goodbye for us\u2014we\u2019d see each other in a day or two or three.\n\nI helped Mom down the narrow and steep stairs, made sure she didn\u2019t fall, and outside she zipped up her jacket and lit a smoke. The sky was clear\u2014I remember that\u2014the night made brighter by the winter moon and stars burning so far away, a distance I sometimes felt with my mom but not right then.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe she drank,\u201d Mom was saying, and judging by the face I made she must have known I knew that she too drank. \u201cI had one drink,\u201d she confessed. \u201cBut I can have a drink, can\u2019t I?\u2019\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, lying, because one wouldn\u2019t be enough. But sometimes you know you just can\u2019t fight the person you love. Love. That\u2019s what that Thanksgiving was full of. Mom made sure I knew that years later, when one time we were again laughing about that night, she said to me, \u201cHoney, to those people, it was a good Thanksgiving, because they were invited. Because they had a place to be and they felt welcomed.\u201d\n\nThat night, in the driveway with her, getting ready to leave, that was what I felt, even though I couldn\u2019t name the feeling.\n\nWe stood there, Mom and I, and after I hugged her goodbye and thanked her for dinner\u2014to which she said, \u201cOf course, my honey\u201d\u2014she scraped her half-smoked cigarette across the icy snow, and I didn\u2019t leave the driveway until I saw she\u2019d made it safely back inside.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The scent of rosemary and thyme wafted through the air, mingling with the sharp tang of cranberry sauce and the buttery richness of mashed potatoes. The kitchen was a cacophony of clattering dishes, beeping timers, and the low hum of the oven. Amelia stood at the stove, stirring a pot of gravy with one hand while balancing a phone against her ear with the other.\n\n\"Yes, Mom, I know. I remember the recipe,\" she said, her voice strained but affectionate. \"I've made it a hundred times.\"\n\nHer mother\u2019s voice crackled through the line, insistent and slightly panicked. \"But don\u2019t forget the secret ingredient. Your father always loved it that way.\"\n\nAmelia sighed, glancing at the recipe card propped up against the backsplash. The familiar scrawl of her father's handwriting was both comforting and heart-wrenching. \"I won't forget, promise.\"\n\nShe hung up, setting the phone down on the counter, and took a deep breath. The house was filled with the noise of family, each room echoing with laughter, arguments, and the occasional burst of music from the living room where her younger cousins were attempting a dance-off. It was Thanksgiving, and the Daniels family was in full swing.\n\nAmelia\u2019s brother, Jake, appeared in the doorway, his hands laden with a tray of deviled eggs. \"Need any help in here?\" he asked, though his tone suggested he hoped the answer was no.\n\nShe gave him a wry smile. \"Always. Can you check on the turkey?\"\n\nJake set the tray down and moved to the oven, peering through the glass. \"Looks good. Smells even better.\"\n\nAs he straightened, their eyes met, and for a moment, the chaos around them faded. They had grown up in this house, the walls steeped in memories of holidays past. Their father\u2019s absence was a palpable void, but they had learned to fill it with new traditions, new laughter.\n\n\"How\u2019s Mom holding up?\" Jake asked, his voice softer now.\n\n\"She\u2019s... managing,\" Amelia replied. \"Called me three times already to remind me about the gravy.\"\n\nJake chuckled, but it was tinged with sadness. \"Some things never change.\"\n\nThey worked in tandem, the rhythm of their movements a testament to years of shared experience. Amelia finished the gravy, and Jake basted the turkey, their unspoken coordination a comfort amidst the noise.\n\nIn the living room, their cousin Lizzie was arguing with her husband, Mark, over the volume of the TV. \"I told you, it\u2019s too loud! Grandma can\u2019t hear herself think,\" Lizzie snapped, grabbing the remote from his hand.\n\nMark threw up his hands in exasperation. \"Fine! Turn it off, then. See if I care.\"\n\nTheir grandmother, seated in her favorite armchair, watched the exchange with mild amusement. \"Oh, let them be, Lizzie. It\u2019s a holiday. We\u2019re supposed to be having fun.\"\n\nLizzie huffed but relented, muting the TV and turning her attention back to her children, who were now engaged in a heated debate over the last piece of pumpkin pie.\n\nAmelia stepped into the room, wiping her hands on a dishtowel. \"Alright, everyone, dinner\u2019s almost ready. Can we try to get along for five minutes?\"\n\nHer plea was met with a chorus of good-natured grumbles and a few teasing remarks. She couldn\u2019t help but smile. This was her family, chaotic and dysfunctional, but undeniably bound by love.\n\nAs they gathered around the table, Amelia felt a pang of nostalgia. The seats were filled, but there was an emptiness that no amount of food or laughter could dispel. Her father\u2019s chair, now occupied by her mother, seemed to hold a silent vigil for the man who had once been the heart of these gatherings.\n\nHer mother raised her glass, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. \"To family,\" she said, her voice wavering but strong. \"And to those who are no longer with us, but whose love still fills this room.\"\n\nGlasses clinked, and for a moment, there was a hush, a collective breath held in remembrance. Then the spell was broken, and the room erupted into conversation and laughter once more.\n\nAmelia watched her family, her heart swelling with a mixture of pride and sorrow. They were messy, imperfect, but they were hers. In the midst of the noise and the arguments, the love that tied them together was unbreakable.\n\nAs the night wore on, the stories flowed as freely as the wine. Tales of childhood mischief, of triumphs and failures, of moments that had shaped them into who they were. Amelia listened, laughed, and shared, feeling the weight of the past and the promise of the future in every word.\n\nIt was late when the doorbell rang, a sharp, unexpected sound that cut through the merriment. Amelia frowned, exchanging a puzzled glance with Jake. \"Who could that be?\"\n\nShe rose from her seat, weaving through the crowded room to the front door. When she opened it, she found herself face to face with a young woman, her hair damp from the rain, a hesitant smile on her lips.\n\n\"Hi,\" the woman said, her voice soft but steady. \"I\u2019m sorry to intrude. My name is Emily. I think... I think I might be your sister.\"\n\nThe room behind Amelia fell silent, all eyes turning toward the door. She felt the world tilt beneath her feet, the ground shifting in ways she could not yet comprehend.\n\n\"Sister?\" she echoed, her mind racing. \"How...?\"\n\nEmily took a deep breath, her eyes searching Amelia\u2019s face. \"I was adopted. I\u2019ve been looking for my birth family for a while now. I didn\u2019t mean to just show up like this, but... it\u2019s Thanksgiving. And I didn\u2019t want to be alone.\"\n\nAmelia\u2019s heart ached at the vulnerability in Emily\u2019s voice, the quiet plea for connection. She glanced back at her family, seeing the shock and curiosity mirrored in their expressions. Her mother\u2019s hand covered her mouth, her eyes wide and brimming with tears.\n\n\"Come in,\" Amelia said, stepping aside to let Emily enter. \"You\u2019re not alone anymore.\"\n\nThe room seemed to hold its breath as Emily stepped inside, her eyes darting around, taking in the faces that were both familiar and strange. Jake was the first to move, crossing the room to offer a tentative smile.\n\n\"Hi, Emily,\" he said, his voice warm. \"I\u2019m Jake. Welcome to the family.\"\n\nOne by one, they introduced themselves, the initial shock giving way to a cautious curiosity. Emily\u2019s presence was a ripple in the fabric of their lives, a new thread woven into the tapestry of their story.\n\nAmelia watched as her mother approached Emily, her hands trembling. \"I... I never knew,\" she whispered, her voice breaking. \"I\u2019m so sorry.\"\n\nEmily shook her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. \"It\u2019s okay. I just... I wanted to know where I came from. To find my roots.\"\n\nHer mother pulled her into a tight embrace, the years of separation and silence dissolving in the warmth of that hug. Amelia felt her own tears spill over, the weight of the moment pressing down on her.\n\nThey gathered around the table once more, making room for Emily, who sat between Jake and their grandmother. The conversation resumed, tentative at first, but soon the laughter and the stories flowed again, now with a new participant.\n\nEmily shared her own story, of her search for her birth family, of the life she had built for herself. Her words were met with encouragement, with acceptance, with love. The Daniels family had always been a patchwork quilt of personalities and histories, and Emily was now a part of that intricate design.\n\nAs the night drew to a close, Amelia found herself standing on the porch, the cool night air a welcome respite from the warmth of the house. Emily joined her, her eyes reflecting the glow of the porch light.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Emily said quietly. \"For welcoming me.\"\n\nAmelia smiled, reaching out to squeeze her hand. \"You\u2019re family. That\u2019s what we do.\"\n\nThey stood in silence for a moment, the weight of the day settling around them. Amelia felt a sense of peace, a quiet certainty that, despite the chaos and the dysfunction, they had found something beautiful. Connection, belonging, love\u2014these were the threads that held them together, even in the most unexpected moments.\n\nAs they turned to go back inside, Amelia knew that this Thanksgiving would be one they would all remember. It was a reminder that family was not just about blood, but about the bonds they chose to forge, the love they chose to give.\n\nAnd in that chaotic, imperfect, wonderful gathering, they had found a deeper truth about what it meant to belong.",
        "story_b": "The kitchen was alive with the sound of clattering pots and the rich aroma of spices. It was the annual Lopez family reunion, a gathering that oscillated between chaos and warmth like a well-tuned symphony teetering on the brink of cacophony. Every year, T\u00eda Carmen insisted on hosting it in her sprawling, albeit slightly dilapidated, home that stood at the end of a cul-de-sac lined with palm trees. Her house was a mishmash of vibrant colors and fading memories, with walls adorned with family portraits and traditional Mexican textiles that told stories of generations past.\n\nThis year was no different; the house was bursting at the seams. Cousins chased each other through the living room, their laughter mingling with the strains of mariachi music blaring from an ancient stereo system. In the corner, a group of aunts exchanged gossip in rapid Spanish, punctuated by the rhythmic chopping of vegetables. The dining room table was a masterpiece of culinary chaos, a long wooden expanse covered with dishes both savory and sweet, each one holding its own significance and flavor.\n\nAt the center of this storm stood Marisol, the one who always seemed to be both part of the family and yet slightly apart. She was T\u00eda Carmen's eldest niece, and her role had been unofficially assigned as the peacemaker, the one who stitched the frayed edges of family ties back together. This year, she had her own quest: to recreate Abuela Rosa's mole, a dish that had become more legend than recipe since her grandmother's passing five years ago.\n\nMarisol had spent countless hours poring over scribbled notes and vague instructions left behind by her grandmother. The mole was more than just a sauce; it was a connection to her roots, a way to bring back a piece of Abuela Rosa that the family sorely missed. Standing over the stove, she stirred the concoction with a wooden spoon, the kitchen's heat wrapping around her like a familiar embrace.\n\n\u201cMarisol, you\u2019re burning it!\u201d T\u00eda Carmen\u2019s voice sliced through the din, jolting Marisol from her reverie.\n\n\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ve got it,\u201d Marisol replied, hastily reducing the heat. She glanced at her aunt, who was expertly flipping tortillas on the comal. \u201cIt just needs a little more time.\u201d\n\nT\u00eda Carmen raised an eyebrow, her expression a blend of skepticism and affection. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not just the ingredients that make a good mole. It\u2019s the love you put into it.\u201d\n\nMarisol nodded, though the weight of those words pressed heavily on her shoulders. She stirred the pot again, the rich, earthy scent of chilies and chocolate rising with the steam, and thought about the last time she had made mole with Abuela Rosa. The memory was vivid\u2014her grandmother's hands, weathered yet gentle, guiding her through each step, whispering secrets about the balance of flavors.\n\nIn the living room, Marisol\u2019s younger brother, Diego, was trying to organize a game of loter\u00eda with the younger cousins, a task akin to herding cats. His voice rose above the chaos, tinged with frustration. \u201cOkay, okay, everyone listen! We need to start if we\u2019re ever going to finish before dinner!\u201d\n\n\u201cDiego, you\u2019re supposed to call the cards, not yell at us,\u201d taunted Sofia, their teenage cousin who always seemed to have a sarcastic remark at the ready.\n\nMarisol smiled at their antics, a familiar sense of nostalgia creeping in. Diego had always been the organizer, the one who tried to impose order on chaos, much like her but in a different, less introspective way.\n\nAs the mole simmered, Marisol found herself reflecting on her role within the family. She had always been the one to mediate arguments, to smooth over misunderstandings with a smile and a soft word. Yet, there was a part of her that wondered if she truly belonged, if her efforts to connect the family were a way to mask her own insecurities about fitting in.\n\nHer thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of her cousin, Javier, who sauntered into the kitchen with a mischievous grin. \u201cI hope you\u2019re not poisoning us with that mole, Mari,\u201d he teased, peering into the pot.\n\n\u201cOnly if you\u2019re the first to try it,\u201d she shot back, playfully swatting his arm with the spoon.\n\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d he laughed, grabbing a handful of freshly fried churros from a plate on the counter. \u201cBut seriously, I\u2019m impressed. Abuela would be proud.\u201d\n\nThe words warmed her more than the kitchen heat ever could. \u201cThanks, Javier. I just hope it tastes as good as hers.\u201d\n\nAs the afternoon wore on, the family settled into a rhythm. The younger children played outside, their shouts echoing through the open windows. The adults congregated around the kitchen and dining room, sipping on homemade horchata and reminiscing about past gatherings. It was a tapestry of love, loud and boisterous, each thread weaving a story of connection and belonging.\n\nFinally, it was time to serve the mole. Marisol, with the help of her cousins, set the table with mismatched plates and silverware, each piece carrying its own history. The family gathered around, a lively buzz of anticipation in the air. As the mole was passed around, Marisol held her breath, waiting for the verdict.\n\nThe first taste was met with silence, a pause that stretched for an eternity. Then, T\u00eda Carmen spoke, her voice thick with emotion. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect, Marisol. Just like Abuela\u2019s.\u201d\n\nA chorus of agreement followed, and Marisol felt a wave of relief and pride wash over her. She had done it. She had brought a piece of Abuela Rosa back to life, if only for an evening. The mole was a success, but more than that, it was a reminder of the ties that bound them all together.\n\nAs dinner progressed, stories flowed as freely as the wine. Marisol listened to her family\u2019s tales, each one more outrageous and heartfelt than the last. There was the time T\u00edo Juan had accidentally set fire to the grill, or when Sofia had secretly adopted a stray dog that had become a beloved family pet. Each story was a thread in their shared tapestry, a testament to their resilience and love.\n\nIt was during one of these stories that Marisol noticed Diego sitting quietly, his usual exuberance subdued. She nudged him gently. \u201cHey, what\u2019s up? You\u2019ve been awfully quiet.\u201d\n\nHe shrugged, a shadow passing over his face. \u201cJust thinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\nDiego hesitated, his eyes flicking to the rest of the family. \u201cI guess\u2026 about how I fit in all of this.\u201d\n\nMarisol\u2019s heart ached at the familiar sentiment. \u201cYou fit because you\u2019re you, Diego. We all have our place here.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we?\u201d He looked at her, his expression earnest. \u201cSometimes I feel like I\u2019m just a part of the background, you know?\u201d\n\nShe nodded, understanding all too well. \u201cI feel like that sometimes too. But maybe that\u2019s just part of being in a big family. We\u2019re all different, but that\u2019s what makes it work.\u201d\n\nDiego offered a small smile, the tension in his shoulders easing. \u201cThanks, Mari. I guess I needed to hear that.\u201d\n\nAs the evening wound down, the family gathered in the living room for one last tradition: the telling of family legends. It was a ritual as old as Marisol could remember, a way to pass down stories that were part truth, part myth. T\u00eda Carmen took the lead, her voice weaving tales of ancestors who had crossed mountains and rivers, who had faced adversity with courage and humor.\n\nMarisol watched her family, the way they leaned in, captivated by the stories that were both familiar and new with each telling. It was in these moments, surrounded by laughter and love, that she felt the deepest connection to them all. They were a family, flawed and beautiful, bound by history and hope.\n\nLater, as she helped T\u00eda Carmen clean up, Marisol found herself reflecting on the day. The chaos, the love, the unexpected moments that revealed so much about who they were. She realized that family wasn\u2019t about fitting perfectly into a mold, but about embracing the imperfections and finding belonging in the shared journey.\n\nT\u00eda Carmen caught her eye, a knowing smile playing on her lips. \u201cYou did good today, Marisol. Abuela would be proud.\u201d\n\nMarisol smiled back, feeling a warmth that had nothing to do with the kitchen. \u201cThanks, T\u00eda. It\u2019s just\u2026 nice to be reminded of what really matters.\u201d\n\nAs the last of the dishes were put away and the house settled into a peaceful silence, Marisol knew that the Lopez family would always be a blend of love and dysfunction, chaos and comfort. And in that beautiful mess, she found her place, her sense of belonging, as sure as the sun would rise again tomorrow.\n\nWith the kitchen finally quiet, Marisol stepped outside into the cool night, the sky a tapestry of stars. She took a deep breath, the scent of mole still lingering on her clothes. It was a reminder, a promise of connection and love, a legacy she would carry forward into the future.\n\nAnd in that moment, standing alone yet surrounded by the spirit of her family, Marisol felt at peace. She was part of something bigger, something that transcended the chaos of a single day. She was home.\n\nThe next morning, as the family slowly stirred awake, the house filled once again with the sounds of life. Breakfast was a simpler affair, a mix of leftover tamales and freshly brewed coffee. Marisol found herself in the kitchen once more, flipping tortillas as Diego shuffled in, his hair tousled from sleep.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d he mumbled, reaching for a mug.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d she replied, handing him a tortilla. \u201cSleep well?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, taking a bite. \u201cThanks for last night.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, understanding unspoken between them. \u201cAnytime.\u201d\n\nAs the day unfolded, the family prepared to say their goodbyes, hugs and promises of keeping in touch exchanged amidst the packing of bags. T\u00eda Carmen stood at the door, her arms open for one last embrace with each departing family member.\n\nWhen it was Marisol\u2019s turn, she held her aunt tightly. \u201cThank you for everything, T\u00eda.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, mija, for reminding us all of what\u2019s important,\u201d T\u00eda Carmen said, her voice thick with emotion.\n\nWith one last look at the house that had been the backdrop to so many memories, Marisol and Diego set off, the road stretching out before them. As they drove away, Marisol glanced in the rearview mirror, seeing the house grow smaller yet somehow more significant.\n\n\u201cReady for next year?\u201d Diego asked, a hint of teasing in his voice.\n\nMarisol laughed, the sound bright and full. \u201cAlways.\u201d\n\nAnd as they headed towards their own lives, the Lopez family reunion became another cherished memory, a testament to the enduring bonds of family. A reminder that in the collision of love and dysfunction, the deepest truths about connection and belonging could be found.",

        "ground_truth": "Some days or weeks or months or years before Mom died, I got her laughing about the Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that bad,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat one guy had a bag of meth,\u201d I told her.\n\n\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t smoke it,\u201d she responded. \u201cHe kept it in his pocket.\u201d\n\nTrue. He didn\u2019t. But even if he did, I don\u2019t think the night could have been any worse.\n\nMom was living in a house with several apartments in Bangor, Maine, at the time. Before living there, she lived in the town next over for seven years, but due to her drinking and her temper, got evicted, which is how she ended up in Bangor\u2014in a housing complex for Native tenants only. Mom tried so hard\u2014so, so hard\u2014to stay sober. And she did, occasionally. Weeks and months would go by when I don\u2019t think she was drinking. Or if she was, she had learned to control her temper. And it was around the time of that Thanksgiving\u2014the Thanksgiving\u2014when she had been sober. Clearheaded. When she called me, she no longer asked for money, asked for rides, asked for a pack of cigarettes. I want to say she was loving and caring and motherly, but even when she drank, she was those things too. I suppose she was just better. And that\u2019s why, when she said she wanted to host Thanksgiving, I was excited. Jess, my sister, was getting out of prison\u2014she served a one-year sentence for theft, on top of priors. According to an article in the local paper, which Mom had cut out and taped on the fridge next to an article about an award I won, Jess had been one of \u201cthree arrested after chicken, potatoes, vodka stolen from grocer,\u201d and she would be there. I was busy with something the day before Thanksgiving when my sister was released, and I told Mom I couldn\u2019t go with her to get Jess at the bus stop, so I didn\u2019t get to see her take her first step off the bus into the free world. My sister and I had written once a month for the year she was in prison. The only thing I remembered from the letters was that my sister\u2019s walking partner was Roxanne Jeskey, a woman convicted of torturing and murdering her husband with a wooden towel rack with nails protruding, needle-nose pliers, and a metal broom handle. Jess said that Roxanne was a good lady. In a text I sent Jess\u2014to make sure I was right that this was true\u2014she wrote back: \u201cShe was a very sweet little old lady who encouraged me to walk with her outside every day to feel better! There I am only doing a year and super depressed and that poor lady had life!\u201d\n\nA very sweet little old lady!\n\nWhile I couldn\u2019t pick my sister up at the bus stop with my mom, I reassured her I\u2019d be at Thanksgiving. Mom was so excited to have her son and daughter together, and part of that excitement, I think, came from the fact that she was sober and so was my sister. Hell, that got me excited too\u2014the first Thanksgiving, far as I can remember, with a sober mother and a sober sister. I imagined it would be a quiet gathering. We\u2019d be in Mom\u2019s cluttered bedroom in her tiny apartment filled with stale cigarette smoke while we sat on the bed and ate turkey, scalloped potatoes, green beans, bread, and cranberry sauce, and along the way Mom would turn down her TV\u2014she\u2019d be watching The Real Housewives of some fucking county\u2014so we could hear each other chew and talk. And in between bites of food we\u2019d ask Jess about prison, and she\u2019d crack jokes, and eventually we would ask her what Roxanne was really like, and Jess would say, Yeah, she told me after she cut off her husband\u2019s penis that she held it over her head and spun it around, pretending to escape the police in a penis-propelled helicopter, and then we\u2019d all laugh and Jess would say, No, no, she was a very nice lady, always asked me how I was doing, and then Jess would get up and ask us if we wanted more cranberry sauce and while she was in the kitchen she\u2019d wonder why Mom never wrote to her.\n\nBut that\u2019s too perfect, right? At least for our family it is.\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day, I got to Mom\u2019s around four in the afternoon. The driveway, which dipped down into a hill, was slick and icy, and so when I parked, I pulled up my emergency brake. I got out and looked up at the second floor, where Mom\u2019s apartment was. A light was on, the window open, and I heard their voices.\n\nThe stairs to Mom\u2019s apartment were narrow and twisty\u2014it\u2019s hyperbole to compare them to the Stairs of Cirith Ungol, but I bet Mom would find that true since she had terrible arthritis and a rod in her leg and that climb was tough\u2014and I climbed them to the top. The door was locked, so I knocked. No answer, but I heard them talking and then laughing. I knocked again, louder, and when the door swung open there was Jess\u2019s ex-boyfriend, Dan. Dan was really good at dumpster diving. He lived in a tent behind Hobby Lobby, even in the winter. Jess lived there too sometimes.\n\nDan was nice. Or so he seemed. I suppose I can say he was one of the nicer men my sister dated, one of the nicer men my sister loved.\n\nHe smiled at me\u2014all but one tooth straight\u2014and he ushered me into the living room, where Mom stood with an apron on and an unlit cigarette between her fingers. Jess was on the floor, cans of Natty Daddies surrounding her like a wall, a fortress, and she got up and from the floor and gave me a beery hug.\n\n\u201cHi, honey,\u201d Mom said, and she told me to follow her into the small kitchen.\n\nMom stirred gravy on the stove. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019s drinking,\u201d she said. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Next to the stove was a cup with tinfoil folded over the top like a lid, a pink bendy straw pierced through it. Did Mom really not know we all knew that\u2019s how she drank? How she tried to hide it?\n\n\u201cRight when she got off the bus,\u201d Mom said, stirring, \u201cshe said she was going to get drunk. Whatever. She\u2019s a grown woman.\u201d\n\nShe drank from the cup with the straw.\n\nThe excitement I felt didn\u2019t immediately turn to disappointment. It was gradual. Sure, it started with seeing my sister\u2019s year of sobriety disappear, started by seeing Dan\u2014yeah, he was nice, but my sister could do better than a guy who lived in a tent behind Hobby Lobby\u2014started by seeing Mom pick up a drink. But the real disappointment came when more guests showed up.\n\nThree, to be exact.\n\nFirst there was Jeremy, a man in his thirties who my mom met at the methadone clinic (she always said she went for pain management, and in a way that\u2019s the truth).\n\n\u201cGod bless you,\u201d she said to him when he showed up with a can of cranberry sauce.\n\n\u201cThis your son?\u201d he asked.\n\nSecond, there was a tall older man, standing behind Jeremy. I can\u2019t remember who the hell he was. He was either a former priest or a pastor, but what I do know is that at that time, he was looking after Jeremy and his sobriety.\n\nThird and finally was the last person I expected: the schizophrenic woman who lived three houses down and who always\u2014and I mean always\u2014stood outside in the middle of the yard smoking.\n\n\u201cLiza, dear,\u201d Mom said. \u201cYou came.\u201d\n\nLiza\u2019s voice was raspy. \u201cYou got a cigarette?\u201d\n\nMom\u2019s apartment was already small to begin with, but just then it felt even smaller. In the living room, I stood while Jess and Dan drank and laughed on the floor, while Liza stood looking out the window, smoking, while Jeremy kept asking my mother if she needed help with anything in the kitchen, and while the priest smiled at us, all of us, a tribe of misfits and nutjobs and criminals and addicts and weirdos, myself included.\n\n\u201cBaby brother,\u201d my sister said, and I sat with her on the floor, even though she had that nasty booze breath, even though I was unhappy with her choices right then, because that\u2019s what you do when you love someone.\n\n\u201cDid you know,\u201d my sister said, not to me but to the room, \u201cdid you know that my baby brother wrote me all the time while I was in prison. And he sent me books and put money in my commissary.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust wonderful!\u201d the priest exclaimed. \u201cJust absolutely wonderful!\u201d\n\nMom cooked. Jess kept me on the floor with her and Dan. Liza continued to stand by the window. Jeremy moved between room and room, unable to commit to one place. And the priest kept on smiling.\n\nIt\u2019s moments like these, I realize now, with people like us, when the world and the lives within it are at their truest.\n\nEventually the food was ready, which Mom announced, that cigarette in her hand still unlit. But nobody moved. Jess and Dan stayed on the floor, drinking. Jeremy\u2014who had asked me more than once if I\u2019d seen a plastic bag filled with white glass beads\u2014couldn\u2019t stand still. Liza was no longer near the window but was in the middle of the living room, staring at Mom, who was in the hallway, waiting for people to come get food. The priest seemed the readiest to eat\u2014he was moving toward the kitchen with such conviction.\n\nThere was no line or anything\u2014we all just crammed ourselves into the kitchen, the very one Mom died hating because there was no sideboard space. It smelled like cooked meat and potatoes and the sweetness of warmed-up cranberry sauce and booze. Mom picked up a dull serrated blade.\n\n\u201cHappy Turkey Day,\u201d she said, and with the dull knife she tried to cut the turkey\u2019s tied feet. She drew the blade back and forth, back and forth, like the string was a giant log, the knife a bow saw, trying to get through it. My sister laughed. \u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Mom said, and then with such force she got the string cut and you\u2019d think tension would dissolve right then but it didn\u2019t and cooked bird juice and grease and fat flew and splattered all over the wall.\n\nMom licked turkey juice off her fingers and carved the turkey. \u201cHelp yourselves,\u201d she said. We all had plates except Liza. \u201cLiza, honey, do you want me to make you a plate?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got a cigarette?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Mom mumbled.\n\nAfter we all ate\u2014except for my mom, who always ate later, and for Liza, who just smoked her cigarette\u2014I told Mom I had to get going. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you down,\u201d she said, taking her apron off. My sister and I didn\u2019t say goodbye, because it wasn\u2019t goodbye for us\u2014we\u2019d see each other in a day or two or three.\n\nI helped Mom down the narrow and steep stairs, made sure she didn\u2019t fall, and outside she zipped up her jacket and lit a smoke. The sky was clear\u2014I remember that\u2014the night made brighter by the winter moon and stars burning so far away, a distance I sometimes felt with my mom but not right then.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe she drank,\u201d Mom was saying, and judging by the face I made she must have known I knew that she too drank. \u201cI had one drink,\u201d she confessed. \u201cBut I can have a drink, can\u2019t I?\u2019\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, lying, because one wouldn\u2019t be enough. But sometimes you know you just can\u2019t fight the person you love. Love. That\u2019s what that Thanksgiving was full of. Mom made sure I knew that years later, when one time we were again laughing about that night, she said to me, \u201cHoney, to those people, it was a good Thanksgiving, because they were invited. Because they had a place to be and they felt welcomed.\u201d\n\nThat night, in the driveway with her, getting ready to leave, that was what I felt, even though I couldn\u2019t name the feeling.\n\nWe stood there, Mom and I, and after I hugged her goodbye and thanked her for dinner\u2014to which she said, \u201cOf course, my honey\u201d\u2014she scraped her half-smoked cigarette across the icy snow, and I didn\u2019t leave the driveway until I saw she\u2019d made it safely back inside.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The scent of rosemary and thyme wafted through the air, mingling with the sharp tang of cranberry sauce and the buttery richness of mashed potatoes. The kitchen was a cacophony of clattering dishes, beeping timers, and the low hum of the oven. Amelia stood at the stove, stirring a pot of gravy with one hand while balancing a phone against her ear with the other.\n\n\"Yes, Mom, I know. I remember the recipe,\" she said, her voice strained but affectionate. \"I've made it a hundred times.\"\n\nHer mother\u2019s voice crackled through the line, insistent and slightly panicked. \"But don\u2019t forget the secret ingredient. Your father always loved it that way.\"\n\nAmelia sighed, glancing at the recipe card propped up against the backsplash. The familiar scrawl of her father's handwriting was both comforting and heart-wrenching. \"I won't forget, promise.\"\n\nShe hung up, setting the phone down on the counter, and took a deep breath. The house was filled with the noise of family, each room echoing with laughter, arguments, and the occasional burst of music from the living room where her younger cousins were attempting a dance-off. It was Thanksgiving, and the Daniels family was in full swing.\n\nAmelia\u2019s brother, Jake, appeared in the doorway, his hands laden with a tray of deviled eggs. \"Need any help in here?\" he asked, though his tone suggested he hoped the answer was no.\n\nShe gave him a wry smile. \"Always. Can you check on the turkey?\"\n\nJake set the tray down and moved to the oven, peering through the glass. \"Looks good. Smells even better.\"\n\nAs he straightened, their eyes met, and for a moment, the chaos around them faded. They had grown up in this house, the walls steeped in memories of holidays past. Their father\u2019s absence was a palpable void, but they had learned to fill it with new traditions, new laughter.\n\n\"How\u2019s Mom holding up?\" Jake asked, his voice softer now.\n\n\"She\u2019s... managing,\" Amelia replied. \"Called me three times already to remind me about the gravy.\"\n\nJake chuckled, but it was tinged with sadness. \"Some things never change.\"\n\nThey worked in tandem, the rhythm of their movements a testament to years of shared experience. Amelia finished the gravy, and Jake basted the turkey, their unspoken coordination a comfort amidst the noise.\n\nIn the living room, their cousin Lizzie was arguing with her husband, Mark, over the volume of the TV. \"I told you, it\u2019s too loud! Grandma can\u2019t hear herself think,\" Lizzie snapped, grabbing the remote from his hand.\n\nMark threw up his hands in exasperation. \"Fine! Turn it off, then. See if I care.\"\n\nTheir grandmother, seated in her favorite armchair, watched the exchange with mild amusement. \"Oh, let them be, Lizzie. It\u2019s a holiday. We\u2019re supposed to be having fun.\"\n\nLizzie huffed but relented, muting the TV and turning her attention back to her children, who were now engaged in a heated debate over the last piece of pumpkin pie.\n\nAmelia stepped into the room, wiping her hands on a dishtowel. \"Alright, everyone, dinner\u2019s almost ready. Can we try to get along for five minutes?\"\n\nHer plea was met with a chorus of good-natured grumbles and a few teasing remarks. She couldn\u2019t help but smile. This was her family, chaotic and dysfunctional, but undeniably bound by love.\n\nAs they gathered around the table, Amelia felt a pang of nostalgia. The seats were filled, but there was an emptiness that no amount of food or laughter could dispel. Her father\u2019s chair, now occupied by her mother, seemed to hold a silent vigil for the man who had once been the heart of these gatherings.\n\nHer mother raised her glass, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. \"To family,\" she said, her voice wavering but strong. \"And to those who are no longer with us, but whose love still fills this room.\"\n\nGlasses clinked, and for a moment, there was a hush, a collective breath held in remembrance. Then the spell was broken, and the room erupted into conversation and laughter once more.\n\nAmelia watched her family, her heart swelling with a mixture of pride and sorrow. They were messy, imperfect, but they were hers. In the midst of the noise and the arguments, the love that tied them together was unbreakable.\n\nAs the night wore on, the stories flowed as freely as the wine. Tales of childhood mischief, of triumphs and failures, of moments that had shaped them into who they were. Amelia listened, laughed, and shared, feeling the weight of the past and the promise of the future in every word.\n\nIt was late when the doorbell rang, a sharp, unexpected sound that cut through the merriment. Amelia frowned, exchanging a puzzled glance with Jake. \"Who could that be?\"\n\nShe rose from her seat, weaving through the crowded room to the front door. When she opened it, she found herself face to face with a young woman, her hair damp from the rain, a hesitant smile on her lips.\n\n\"Hi,\" the woman said, her voice soft but steady. \"I\u2019m sorry to intrude. My name is Emily. I think... I think I might be your sister.\"\n\nThe room behind Amelia fell silent, all eyes turning toward the door. She felt the world tilt beneath her feet, the ground shifting in ways she could not yet comprehend.\n\n\"Sister?\" she echoed, her mind racing. \"How...?\"\n\nEmily took a deep breath, her eyes searching Amelia\u2019s face. \"I was adopted. I\u2019ve been looking for my birth family for a while now. I didn\u2019t mean to just show up like this, but... it\u2019s Thanksgiving. And I didn\u2019t want to be alone.\"\n\nAmelia\u2019s heart ached at the vulnerability in Emily\u2019s voice, the quiet plea for connection. She glanced back at her family, seeing the shock and curiosity mirrored in their expressions. Her mother\u2019s hand covered her mouth, her eyes wide and brimming with tears.\n\n\"Come in,\" Amelia said, stepping aside to let Emily enter. \"You\u2019re not alone anymore.\"\n\nThe room seemed to hold its breath as Emily stepped inside, her eyes darting around, taking in the faces that were both familiar and strange. Jake was the first to move, crossing the room to offer a tentative smile.\n\n\"Hi, Emily,\" he said, his voice warm. \"I\u2019m Jake. Welcome to the family.\"\n\nOne by one, they introduced themselves, the initial shock giving way to a cautious curiosity. Emily\u2019s presence was a ripple in the fabric of their lives, a new thread woven into the tapestry of their story.\n\nAmelia watched as her mother approached Emily, her hands trembling. \"I... I never knew,\" she whispered, her voice breaking. \"I\u2019m so sorry.\"\n\nEmily shook her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. \"It\u2019s okay. I just... I wanted to know where I came from. To find my roots.\"\n\nHer mother pulled her into a tight embrace, the years of separation and silence dissolving in the warmth of that hug. Amelia felt her own tears spill over, the weight of the moment pressing down on her.\n\nThey gathered around the table once more, making room for Emily, who sat between Jake and their grandmother. The conversation resumed, tentative at first, but soon the laughter and the stories flowed again, now with a new participant.\n\nEmily shared her own story, of her search for her birth family, of the life she had built for herself. Her words were met with encouragement, with acceptance, with love. The Daniels family had always been a patchwork quilt of personalities and histories, and Emily was now a part of that intricate design.\n\nAs the night drew to a close, Amelia found herself standing on the porch, the cool night air a welcome respite from the warmth of the house. Emily joined her, her eyes reflecting the glow of the porch light.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Emily said quietly. \"For welcoming me.\"\n\nAmelia smiled, reaching out to squeeze her hand. \"You\u2019re family. That\u2019s what we do.\"\n\nThey stood in silence for a moment, the weight of the day settling around them. Amelia felt a sense of peace, a quiet certainty that, despite the chaos and the dysfunction, they had found something beautiful. Connection, belonging, love\u2014these were the threads that held them together, even in the most unexpected moments.\n\nAs they turned to go back inside, Amelia knew that this Thanksgiving would be one they would all remember. It was a reminder that family was not just about blood, but about the bonds they chose to forge, the love they chose to give.\n\nAnd in that chaotic, imperfect, wonderful gathering, they had found a deeper truth about what it meant to belong.",
        "story_b": "The old house on Maple Street, with its creaky floorboards and faded wallpaper, stood like a relic of another time, cradling the sounds of the past within its walls. It was a place where voices echoed and memories lingered. As the early evening sun dipped below the horizon, the family began to gather, a motley crew of personalities and histories converging under one roof. It was Grandma Rosa\u2019s 80th birthday, and she insisted on celebrating at the house where she had raised her children, instilling in them a love for their roots and a fierce sense of independence.\n\nThe kitchen was a whirlwind of activity. The table was laden with dishes, an array of traditional foods that spoke of their heritage. There were tamales, mole, and arroz con pollo, each dish prepared with the kind of care and precision that only came from years of practice. The aroma of chiles and spices filled the air, mingling with the sound of laughter and clattering dishes.\n\nIn the midst of this culinary chaos, Carmen, the eldest daughter, was stirring a pot of beans, her brow furrowed with concentration. \u201cMira, Juan! You\u2019re burning the tortillas!\u201d she shouted across the kitchen to her brother, who was juggling a spatula and a phone, trying to balance his duties as a cook and a father. Juan glanced up, flashing a sheepish grin as he flipped the tortillas with a practiced flick of his wrist.\n\n\u201cRelax, hermana, I got this,\u201d he replied, though the slightly charred edges of the tortillas suggested otherwise.\n\nNearby, in the living room, the younger children were playing, their laughter a bright counterpoint to the adults\u2019 conversations. Little Ana, with her wild curls and gap-toothed smile, was trying to teach her cousin Diego how to dance, her small feet tapping out a rhythm on the wooden floor. The adults watched with a mixture of amusement and exasperation, their voices rising and falling like a tide.\n\nAs the clock ticked towards dinner, the tension in the house began to build. It was an unspoken tradition that at every family gathering, some argument would ignite, sparking a firestorm of opinions and emotions. This time, it was Uncle Roberto, his booming voice cutting through the chatter as he launched into a tirade about the family\u2019s reluctance to support local businesses. \u201cWe\u2019re losing our culture,\u201d he declared, gesturing emphatically with his glass of wine, \u201cbecause we\u2019re too busy buying everything from those big box stores!\u201d\n\nHis brother, Miguel, rolled his eyes, leaning back in his chair with a sigh. \u201cOh, here we go again,\u201d he muttered under his breath, exchanging a knowing glance with his wife, Maria. She shrugged, used to these outbursts, and continued setting the table.\n\nGrandma Rosa, seated at the head of the table, watched the exchange with a bemused smile. Her eyes, still sharp and bright despite her years, moved from one family member to the next, observing, absorbing. She was the anchor of this family, a repository of stories and wisdom, and she knew better than to intervene too soon. These arguments were as much a part of their gatherings as the food and laughter, a cathartic release of pent-up frustrations and grievances.\n\nAs the argument simmered, Carmen called everyone to the table, her voice slicing through the discord. \u201cDinner\u2019s ready!\u201d she announced, and slowly, reluctantly, the family gathered around, the lure of food momentarily quelling the storm.\n\nThey ate in a flurry of passing plates and clinking cutlery, the conversation ebbing and flowing, punctuated by bursts of laughter and the occasional sharp retort. As the meal wound down, Grandma Rosa cleared her throat, drawing all eyes to her. She had a story to tell, and when Grandma Rosa spoke, everyone listened.\n\n\u201cI remember,\u201d she began, her voice steady and warm, \u201ca family reunion when I was just a girl. It was just after the war, and times were hard. We didn\u2019t have much, but we had each other, and that was enough.\u201d\n\nHer story unfolded in the room like a tapestry, weaving together strands of memory and history. She spoke of a time when her family gathered in a small village in the mountains, where the air was thin and the nights were cold. They had come together to celebrate life, to dance and sing and remember those they had lost. It had been a chaotic affair, full of clashing personalities and old grievances, but in the midst of it all, there was a moment of profound connection\u2014a ceremonial dance that brought them together, transcending their differences.\n\nAs she spoke, the room seemed to hold its breath, the family drawn into the web of her words. They could see the flickering firelight, hear the music, feel the warmth of bodies moving in unison. It was a story of love and resilience, a reminder of the bonds that held them together even when everything else seemed to fall apart.\n\nWhen she finished, there was a moment of silence, a collective pause as the family absorbed the weight of her words. Then, slowly, the conversation resumed, softer now, more reflective. The argument had cooled, replaced by a sense of shared understanding.\n\nIn the quiet that followed, Carmen leaned back in her chair, her eyes drifting to the window. She thought of her own struggles, balancing her career with her responsibilities to her family, the constant push and pull between the life she wanted and the life she felt she owed to those who came before her. It was a struggle familiar to many at the table, a theme that ran through their family\u2019s history like a thread.\n\nShe glanced at her brother, Juan, who was trying to coax Ana into eating her vegetables. He caught her eye and grinned, a silent acknowledgment of their shared journey. They had been through so much together, weathered storms and celebrated triumphs, and through it all, they had remained connected, bound by blood and history.\n\nThe evening wore on, and as the moon rose high in the sky, the family began to disperse, drifting into smaller groups or slipping out into the night. The house grew quieter, the chaos of the day fading into a gentle hum.\n\nIn the kitchen, Carmen found Grandma Rosa, tidying up despite her protests that she should rest. \u201cAbuela, let me help you,\u201d she said, reaching for the plates.\n\nGrandma Rosa waved her off with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m not so old that I can\u2019t clean up my own kitchen,\u201d she replied, her voice firm but affectionate. \u201cBesides, I like to do it. It gives me time to think.\u201d\n\nCarmen hesitated, then nodded, understanding that her grandmother needed this time, this space. She left the kitchen and wandered outside, where the cool night air wrapped around her like a shawl. She stood on the porch, looking out at the familiar landscape, the trees swaying gently in the breeze.\n\nShe thought of the stories she had heard that night, the layers of history and memory that made up her family. She thought of the challenges they faced, the way they clung to their traditions even as the world changed around them. It was a delicate balance, a dance of love and dysfunction, but it was theirs.\n\nAs she stood there, she felt a hand on her shoulder. It was Juan, his expression soft and thoughtful. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, his voice low.\n\nShe nodded, leaning into him. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just thinking about everything.\u201d\n\nHe chuckled softly. \u201cYou\u2019re always thinking too much.\u201d\n\nShe smiled, nudging him playfully. \u201cAnd you\u2019re always thinking too little.\u201d\n\nThey stood there together, siblings united against the night, their breath mingling in the chill air. It was a moment of quiet connection, a reminder of the strength that came from being part of something larger than themselves.\n\nInside, the house was settling into silence, the echoes of the day fading into the walls. Grandma Rosa finished her tidying and turned off the lights, her heart full of gratitude and love. She knew that her family was far from perfect, that they would continue to clash and argue, to struggle and strive. But she also knew that they would always come back to this place, to the warmth and chaos of their shared history.\n\nAnd in that knowledge, she found peace.\n\nAs the stars twinkled overhead, the family drifted to their beds, the house enveloping them in its embrace. It was a place of love and dysfunction, of stories and secrets, and it was home.",

In a year, he will not be alive, whether I write or don\u2019t write this story about him. Except perhaps alive in the way stories live, or alive as people say people are alive in stories. People saying that as if they do not understand: dead once, dead forever. As if they don\u2019t know that once is all the time a person ever gets to be alive. As if they don\u2019t know that G.F. doesn\u2019t hear, doesn\u2019t desire mourning, clamor, and cries. As if they do not comprehend that their millions of bodies piled up or kneeling in prayer or prostrate in the street next to G.F. all weigh less than this sheet of paper on which I scribble, and that the commotion, agitation, exercise of their millions upon millions of hearts and minds will not summon a single breath of air when G.F. needs it.\n\nI will not pretend to bring G.F. to life. Nor pretend to bring life to him. G.F. gone for good. Won\u2019t return. No place for G.F. except the past. And the past is not even past, a wise man once declared. Same abyss behind and in front of us is what the wisecracker writer signifying, I believe, and, if I truly believe what he believed, where would I situate G.F. if presented with an opportunity to put him somewhere alive? Not here. Not here in this story where I know better.\n\nBetter to forget G.F. Better to let go, or simply leave G.F. alone, thank you, than attempt to invent the point of view of a person not here, not where I am, a person who somehow possesses the power to see G.F. breathing, moving around, to hear G.F.\u2019s thoughts. A person also able to observe me here, myself performing this grief, this terror and anger, this attempt to console myself and define and control and locate myself, establish myself as one who is offering a story about G.F., a true story confirming my suffering, my connection to him, a story about who he is, who I am, a story about myself, as if I am not here where I am and he is not where he is. As if the two of us not permanently separate as life from death. As dreams from objects dreamed.\n\nBetter to acknowledge impenetrable darkness surrounding G.F. and me, black darkness blinding me when I pretend I can speak with the authority of a being I imagine whose perspective absolutely reliable. Why write as if I can access the power such an angelic being might possess. As if I am able to employ that power to see, to enter G.F. Power to convince myself, or anybody who might be paying attention or reading or simply curious, that my feelings for G.F., my performance, my outrage, my rituals of claiming and disclaiming an unbreakable relationship to him are authentic. Serve some useful purpose. That my eyes, words reliable, convincing as words, eyes of that imaginary observer I proposed a few sentences ago. Why call upon some sort of supernatural observer to bear witness. Attempt to own that point of view. Imitating it to move closer to G.F. Move outside myself.\n\nI find each move unsatisfactory. A kind of presumption. Wishful thinking at best. Guilt and avoidance at worst. Pretending not to be here where I am, here with many millions of others upset over G.F., people who watch online, who march, throng avenues and streets, behind mikes, on TV, in front of TVs, assuming they may be rightfully, righteously blamed, perhaps, but also hoping to be spared, forgiven. Given another chance. Here in this place where I am, too. Whether or not I pretend I can inhabit some impossibly different space. A place elsewhere in which I am neither exactly dead nor alive, where I am suspended, invisible, yet able to observe myself and observe G.F. as neither living nor dead. Despite absolute darkness, to observe G.F. here, to observe myself here, despite or because we are not present here, but elsewhere, nowhere in fact, or wherever anybody chooses to imagine or not imagine she or he might be. Wherever I\u2019m pretending I am.\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\nFor example, pretending not to breathe. A cop knee pressing down on the neck. Choking, suffocating me.

Wonder what street. What city. Wonder how long dead while wondering.\n\nHow long. How long. How to make it real. Not to bid a victim, loved or unloved, adieu. Not to say farewell.

        "story_a": "Sylvia sat on the edge of her bed, the evening light casting long shadows through the curtains. The room was heavy with the scent of lavender, a remnant of her mother\u2019s daily ritual. She glanced at the photograph on her bedside table\u2014her parents on their wedding day, smiling with a brightness that seemed almost foreign now. She traced the silver frame with her fingers, feeling the cool metal beneath her touch. Remembering was not a passive act; it was an act of defiance.\n\nHer father\u2019s voice echoed in her mind: \u201cThe past is a teacher, not a tyrant.\u201d He had said this often, usually when Sylvia\u2019s mother urged him to let go of old grievances, to move forward. But her father, with his quiet resolve, held on to every detail. He kept journals, meticulously cataloged, filled with memories and reflections. It was his way of resisting a world that seemed eager to forget.\n\nSylvia\u2019s own memories of her father were fragmented, like pieces of a shattered mirror. He had died when she was thirteen, his heart giving out under the strain of too many unspoken words. She remembered the way he would sit at the kitchen table, his hands clasped around a cup of coffee, staring into the distance as if searching for something just out of reach. Those mornings were silent, the air thick with unvoiced thoughts.\n\nHer mother, in contrast, embraced the present with a fervor that left little room for the past. \u201cWe must live for today,\u201d she would say, her voice bright and insistent. Sylvia had always found this sentiment hollow, a denial of the weight that the past carried. It was as if her mother were running from something, a shadow that grew longer with each passing year.\n\nNow, at twenty-seven, Sylvia felt the pull of her father\u2019s legacy more acutely than ever. She had inherited his journals, each one a testament to the power of memory. She spent hours poring over them, the pages yellowed and brittle, the ink fading but still legible. They were filled with stories\u2014his childhood in a small coastal town, his first love, the birth of Sylvia herself. Each entry was a piece of a larger mosaic, a map of a life lived in defiance of forgetting.\n\nOne journal, in particular, held her attention. It was the last one he had written, the entries growing more sporadic as his health declined. There was a passage that Sylvia returned to often, a reflection on the nature of memory itself: \u201cTo remember is to resist the erasure of our existence. It is to hold on to the threads that bind us to each other, to the world.\u201d\n\nThese words resonated with Sylvia, a mantra that guided her through the labyrinth of her own memories. She thought of her father\u2019s voice, the way it would rise and fall like the tide, carrying with it the weight of history. She remembered his hands, calloused and strong, the way they would cradle her face when she was a child, anchoring her in a world that often felt adrift.\n\nSylvia\u2019s own memories were a patchwork quilt, stitched together with threads of joy and sorrow. She remembered the scent of pine from their family trips to the mountains, the sound of her father\u2019s laughter as they huddled around a campfire. She remembered the silence of the hospital room, the beeping of machines that marked the passing of time with a cold precision. These memories were her inheritance, a legacy that she carried with her like a sacred trust.\n\nHer mother, meanwhile, had moved on in a way that Sylvia found both admirable and troubling. She had remarried, a man named Peter who was kind but distant, his presence a buffer against the encroaching past. They lived in a house filled with light, the walls adorned with cheerful paintings and the air filled with the sound of classical music. It was a life that seemed untouched by the weight of memory, a fresh start that Sylvia could not bring herself to embrace.\n\nOne evening, as she sat in her apartment, Sylvia received a call from her mother. There was a hesitation in her voice, a vulnerability that Sylvia had not heard in years. \u201cI found something,\u201d her mother said, her words measured and careful. \u201cIt\u2019s a letter, from your father. I think you should see it.\u201d\n\nSylvia felt a tightening in her chest, a familiar ache that had become a part of her. She agreed to meet her mother the next day, the anticipation gnawing at her like a persistent itch. When she arrived at her mother\u2019s house, the air was thick with unspoken words. They sat in the living room, the afternoon light casting a warm glow over the room.\n\nHer mother handed her the letter, the envelope worn and yellowed with age. Sylvia\u2019s hands trembled as she opened it, her eyes scanning the familiar handwriting. The letter was addressed to both Sylvia and her mother, a final message from a man who had always believed in the power of memory.\n\n\u201cMy dearest Sylvia and Margaret,\u201d it began. \u201cAs I write this, I am acutely aware of the passage of time, of the moments that slip through our fingers like sand. I want you both to know that my love for you is boundless, that it transcends the boundaries of life and death. Remembering is not a burden, but a gift. It is a way of keeping the flame of our existence alive, even in the darkest of times.\u201d\n\nSylvia\u2019s eyes filled with tears as she read the words, her father\u2019s voice echoing in her mind. She felt a profound sense of connection, a thread that linked her to a past that was both painful and beautiful. Her mother sat beside her, her eyes moist with unshed tears. For the first time in years, they shared a moment of unspoken understanding, a recognition of the weight they both carried.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Sylvia found herself drawn to her father\u2019s journals with renewed vigor. She saw them not just as a record of the past, but as a guide for the future. She began to write her own reflections, capturing the moments that defined her life, the memories that shaped her existence. It was an act of resistance, a way of asserting her presence in a world that seemed intent on erasure.\n\nHer mother, too, began to embrace the past in a way she had not before. They spent hours reminiscing, sharing stories that had long been buried under the weight of time. It was a process of healing, a way of bridging the gap between them. In those quiet moments, Sylvia felt the presence of her father, his spirit woven into the fabric of their lives.\n\nAs the years passed, Sylvia continued to honor the legacy of memory.

        "story_b": "In the quiet hours of dawn, when the world seemed to hold its breath, I found myself wandering through the deserted streets of my childhood. The air was thick with the scent of lilacs, a fragrance so deeply woven into the fabric of my past that it stirred memories long buried beneath the sediment of years. I walked slowly, each step echoing in the stillness, as if the very ground was whispering stories of those who had walked before me.\n\nMemory is resistance. Resistance is memory. I repeated this mantra silently, a shield against the encroaching tide of forgetfulness. The lilacs were in full bloom, their delicate petals glowing softly in the early light, much like the spirits of my ancestors who lingered in every corner of this place. They were here, unseen but ever-present, their presence a testament to the enduring power of memory.\n\nAs I walked, I recalled a significant memory, one that refused to fade. It was a warm summer evening, many years ago, when my grandmother gathered us around her in the garden, her voice a gentle melody weaving stories of our lineage. She spoke of resilience, of battles fought and won, of love enduring beyond the confines of time. Her words were not mere stories but living memories, anchors in the storm of forgetfulness, holding fast against the tide of oblivion.\n\n\"Remember,\" she had said, her eyes burning with a fierce light, \"remembering is resisting. To forget is to surrender.\"\n\nThe weight of her words settled over me like a cloak, both heavy and comforting. Even now, I felt their gravity, pulling me back to that night, to the glow of fireflies dancing in the twilight, to the warmth of her hand as it clasped mine. Memories, like stories, are graves. Yet, in their weight, we find our strength to resist.\n\nI wandered further, drawn by an invisible thread to the heart of the town, where the library stood\u2014a sanctuary of forgotten stories, echoing with the whispers of resistance. Its doors were weathered, the wood worn smooth by generations of hands. As I pushed them open, the scent of old books enveloped me, a heady mix of dust and ink, of time captured and preserved.\n\nInside, the silence was profound, a palpable presence that filled the space between the shelves. The library was an extension of my mind's landscape, a labyrinth of thoughts and reflections, each aisle a corridor into the past. I moved through it with reverence, fingers trailing over the spines of books that held the collective memory of my people.\n\nMemory is resistance. Resistance is memory.\n\nI found my way to a corner where a single window framed the sky, now a tapestry of colors as the sun began its ascent. I sat there, the light casting long shadows, and let the memories wash over me. I thought of my grandfather, a quiet man whose silence spoke volumes, his life a testament to endurance. He had been a part of the civil rights movement, marching in solidarity, his voice one among many that rose in defiance against injustice.\n\nHis stories were etched in my mind, as vivid as the day he first shared them. He spoke of hope, of the unyielding spirit of those who refused to be silenced, who remembered when others sought to forget. \"Memory is our weapon,\" he had said, his voice a rumble of thunder, \"a torch we pass to those who come after, to light their way through the darkness.\"\n\nI closed my eyes, feeling the weight of his words settle deep within me. Remembering was not a passive act; it was a rebellion, a refusal to let the past be forgotten. The memories of my ancestors, of their struggles and triumphs, were woven into the very fabric of my being, shaping the person I had become.\n\nThe fluidity of time and the permanence of memory converged here, in this quiet corner of the library. Memories were not linear; they existed in a timeless space, a realm where past and present danced together in a delicate balance. I could feel it now, the presence of those who had come before, their voices a chorus that resonated within me.\n\nIs memory not the heart's rebellion against time's erasure? I pondered this question, the answer elusive yet tantalizingly close. Memories were like glowing threads, weaving through the tapestry of time, each a beacon of defiance against the darkness that sought to consume them. They were the essence of resistance, a reminder that the past was not to be forgotten but cherished, honored, and learned from.\n\nI opened my eyes, the library now bathed in the soft glow of morning light. The weight of memory was heavy, but it was a weight I bore with pride. It was the legacy of those who had come before, a testament to their strength and resilience. In their stories, I found my own, a narrative that stretched beyond the confines of time, connecting me to something greater than myself.\n\nAs I rose to leave, I felt a sense of peace settle over me, a calm certainty that the act of remembering was indeed a form of resistance. It was a defiance against the erasure of time, a commitment to preserving the past for future generations. I carried this thought with me as I stepped back into the world, the sun now high in the sky, casting its warm light over the town.\n\nI walked with purpose, each step a reaffirmation of my resolve. The streets were coming to life, people moving with the rhythm of the day, unaware of the quiet rebellion that unfolded within me. But I knew, and that was enough.\n\nI returned to the lilac-scented air, the memories of my ancestors a comforting presence at my side. Their stories were graves, perhaps, but they were also gardens, fertile with the seeds of resistance, waiting to bloom anew with each retelling. In their weight, I found my strength, my purpose, my place in the continuum of time.\n\nAnd so I walked, carrying their legacy forward, a torchbearer in the ceaseless march of history. The past was not forgotten, nor would it ever be, as long as there were those who remembered, who resisted, who refused to let the stories fade into oblivion.\n\nMemory is resistance. Resistance is memory.\n\nIn this mantra, I found my truth, my rebellion, my hope. And in the quiet hours of dawn, as the world held its breath, I knew that I would carry it with me always, a beacon of light in the shadowy depths of forgetfulness.",

Why call upon some sort of supernatural observer to bear witness. Attempt to own that point of view. Imitating it to move closer to G.F. Move outside myself.\n\nI find each move unsatisfactory.

Pretending not to be here where I am, here with many millions of others upset over G.F., people who watch online, who march, throng avenues and streets, behind mikes, on TV, in front of TVs, assuming they may be rightfully, righteously blamed, perhaps, but also hoping to be spared, forgiven.

        "story_a": "Sylvia sat on the edge of her bed, the evening light casting long shadows through the curtains. The room was heavy with the scent of lavender, a remnant of her mother\u2019s daily ritual. She glanced at the photograph on her bedside table\u2014her parents on their wedding day, smiling with a brightness that seemed almost foreign now. She traced the silver frame with her fingers, feeling the cool metal beneath her touch. Remembering was not a passive act; it was an act of defiance.\n\nHer father\u2019s voice echoed in her mind: \u201cThe past is a teacher, not a tyrant.\u201d He had said this often, usually when Sylvia\u2019s mother urged him to let go of old grievances, to move forward. But her father, with his quiet resolve, held on to every detail. He kept journals, meticulously cataloged, filled with memories and reflections. It was his way of resisting a world that seemed eager to forget.\n\nSylvia\u2019s own memories of her father were fragmented, like pieces of a shattered mirror. He had died when she was thirteen, his heart giving out under the strain of too many unspoken words. She remembered the way he would sit at the kitchen table, his hands clasped around a cup of coffee, staring into the distance as if searching for something just out of reach. Those mornings were silent, the air thick with unvoiced thoughts.\n\nHer mother, in contrast, embraced the present with a fervor that left little room for the past. \u201cWe must live for today,\u201d she would say, her voice bright and insistent. Sylvia had always found this sentiment hollow, a denial of the weight that the past carried. It was as if her mother were running from something, a shadow that grew longer with each passing year.\n\nNow, at twenty-seven, Sylvia felt the pull of her father\u2019s legacy more acutely than ever. She had inherited his journals, each one a testament to the power of memory. She spent hours poring over them, the pages yellowed and brittle, the ink fading but still legible. They were filled with stories\u2014his childhood in a small coastal town, his first love, the birth of Sylvia herself. Each entry was a piece of a larger mosaic, a map of a life lived in defiance of forgetting.\n\nOne journal, in particular, held her attention. It was the last one he had written, the entries growing more sporadic as his health declined. There was a passage that Sylvia returned to often, a reflection on the nature of memory itself: \u201cTo remember is to resist the erasure of our existence. It is to hold on to the threads that bind us to each other, to the world.\u201d\n\nThese words resonated with Sylvia, a mantra that guided her through the labyrinth of her own memories. She thought of her father\u2019s voice, the way it would rise and fall like the tide, carrying with it the weight of history. She remembered his hands, calloused and strong, the way they would cradle her face when she was a child, anchoring her in a world that often felt adrift.\n\nSylvia\u2019s own memories were a patchwork quilt, stitched together with threads of joy and sorrow. She remembered the scent of pine from their family trips to the mountains, the sound of her father\u2019s laughter as they huddled around a campfire. She remembered the silence of the hospital room, the beeping of machines that marked the passing of time with a cold precision. These memories were her inheritance, a legacy that she carried with her like a sacred trust.\n\nHer mother, meanwhile, had moved on in a way that Sylvia found both admirable and troubling. She had remarried, a man named Peter who was kind but distant, his presence a buffer against the encroaching past. They lived in a house filled with light, the walls adorned with cheerful paintings and the air filled with the sound of classical music. It was a life that seemed untouched by the weight of memory, a fresh start that Sylvia could not bring herself to embrace.\n\nOne evening, as she sat in her apartment, Sylvia received a call from her mother. There was a hesitation in her voice, a vulnerability that Sylvia had not heard in years. \u201cI found something,\u201d her mother said, her words measured and careful. \u201cIt\u2019s a letter, from your father. I think you should see it.\u201d\n\nSylvia felt a tightening in her chest, a familiar ache that had become a part of her. She agreed to meet her mother the next day, the anticipation gnawing at her like a persistent itch. When she arrived at her mother\u2019s house, the air was thick with unspoken words. They sat in the living room, the afternoon light casting a warm glow over the room.\n\nHer mother handed her the letter, the envelope worn and yellowed with age. Sylvia\u2019s hands trembled as she opened it, her eyes scanning the familiar handwriting. The letter was addressed to both Sylvia and her mother, a final message from a man who had always believed in the power of memory.\n\n\u201cMy dearest Sylvia and Margaret,\u201d it began. \u201cAs I write this, I am acutely aware of the passage of time, of the moments that slip through our fingers like sand. I want you both to know that my love for you is boundless, that it transcends the boundaries of life and death. Remembering is not a burden, but a gift. It is a way of keeping the flame of our existence alive, even in the darkest of times.\u201d\n\nSylvia\u2019s eyes filled with tears as she read the words, her father\u2019s voice echoing in her mind. She felt a profound sense of connection, a thread that linked her to a past that was both painful and beautiful. Her mother sat beside her, her eyes moist with unshed tears. For the first time in years, they shared a moment of unspoken understanding, a recognition of the weight they both carried.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Sylvia found herself drawn to her father\u2019s journals with renewed vigor. She saw them not just as a record of the past, but as a guide for the future. She began to write her own reflections, capturing the moments that defined her life, the memories that shaped her existence. It was an act of resistance, a way of asserting her presence in a world that seemed intent on erasure.\n\nHer mother, too, began to embrace the past in a way she had not before. They spent hours reminiscing, sharing stories that had long been buried under the weight of time. It was a process of healing, a way of bridging the gap between them. In those quiet moments, Sylvia felt the presence of her father, his spirit woven into the fabric of their lives.\n\nAs the years passed, Sylvia continued to honor the legacy of memory. She became a historian, dedicated to preserving the stories of those who had come before. Her work was a testament to the power of remembering, a way of resisting the erasure of existence. And in her own life, she found solace in the act of remembering, a way of keeping the flame of her father\u2019s love alive.\n\nIn the end, Sylvia understood that remembering was not just an act of defiance, but an affirmation of life itself. It was a way of holding on to the threads that bound her to the world, a testament to the enduring power of memory. And in that act of resistance, she found her own strength, a quiet resolve that carried her through the darkest of times.",
        "story_b": "The street is a canvas, each crack a line of history, each shadow a remnant of what was. Time flows here, unruffled by stops and starts, a river of echoes where past and present merge into a singular rhythm. On this familiar path, my steps fall into a cadence, a meditation, and the memories rise like mist from the asphalt, refusing to be forgotten.\n\nIn the act of remembering, we resist. In resistance, we remain.\n\nThe street stretches ahead, a corridor of remembrance. I walk, the soles of my shoes brushing against the pavement with a steady, deliberate beat, and I am both here and elsewhere. The present moment dissolves into memory, and I am a child again, skipping along this same path, the sun warm on my skin, the world vast and full of promise. But the present pulls me back, a tether I cannot sever, and I am here, now, an adult carrying the weight of all the yesterdays that have shaped me.\n\nThe glow of the streetlamps is soft in the early evening, their light blending with the encroaching twilight. They stand as sentinels, witnesses to the passage of time, their glow a reminder of the constancy of change. I pass beneath them, and their light casts long shadows that stretch behind me, echoes of the past that cling and whisper, \"Remember, resist, remain.\"\n\nMemory is a form of resistance. To remember is to defy the erasure of identity, to stand firm against the tide of oblivion that seeks to wash away the traces of what once was. Memory is a battleground, and I am a soldier, armed with recollections that refuse to fade, stories that demand to be told.\n\nAs I walk, the memories unfurl, a tapestry of moments woven together, each thread a connection to the past. I remember my grandmother, her hands worn and wise, her voice a melody of tales and truths. She taught me that stories are lifelines, that to forget is to lose oneself, that in the act of telling, we reclaim the fragments of our existence. Her words echo in my mind, a mantra of resilience: \"We are the stories we tell, the stories we keep alive.\"\n\nThe street narrows as I approach the old park, a place of laughter and innocence, where time seemed endless and the future a distant horizon. The swings creak in the breeze, their chains rusted but sturdy, a reminder that even the strongest of things bear the marks of time. I pause, my gaze lingering on the playground where I once played, where dreams were born and nurtured, where the future was a canvas yet to be painted.\n\nThe past is a presence, a silhouette of thoughts, crowned by the glow of remembered moments. It follows me, a shadow that does not wane, a companion that will not be cast aside. I carry it with me, in me, a testament to the lives that have touched mine, the stories that have shaped me.\n\nIn the act of remembering, we resist. In resistance, we remain.\n\nThe air is cool, carrying with it the scent of earth and leaves and the distant promise of rain. I breathe deeply, the air filling my lungs, grounding me in the present even as I drift through the corridors of memory. The street is alive with the voices of those who have walked it before me, their whispers a chorus that sings of love and loss, of hope and despair, of the indomitable spirit of humanity.\n\nTo remember is to bear witness, to honor the lives that came before, to refuse the silence that seeks to swallow the past. It is an act of defiance, a declaration that we are here, that we have been here, that we will not be erased.\n\nI turn the corner, and the street opens into the square, a space alive with light and movement. The fountain at its center dances with water, its spray catching the light and casting rainbows into the air. Children play around it, their laughter a symphony of joy, and I am reminded that the future is a story yet to be written, a canvas waiting to be filled.\n\nThe square is a meeting place, a convergence of paths and lives, a space where stories intersect and collide. I watch as people move through it, each carrying their own burdens of memory, their own tales of resistance and resilience. They are a tapestry of humanity, each thread unique yet part of the same grand design.\n\nI am drawn to a bench beneath a great oak, its branches reaching skyward, a testament to endurance and growth. I sit, the wood cool beneath me, and I close my eyes, letting the sounds of the square wash over me. The chatter of voices, the rustle of leaves, the distant hum of the city\u2014all blend into a symphony of life, a reminder that the world is vast and interconnected, that we are all part of something greater.\n\nThe weight of memory settles around me, a familiar cloak that I wear with pride. It is a burden and a gift, a reminder of the love and loss that have shaped me, the moments that have defined me. It is a testament to the lives that have touched mine, the stories that I carry with me, the stories that I refuse to forget.\n\nIn the act of remembering, we resist. In resistance, we remain.\n\nI open my eyes, and the world comes into focus, sharp and vibrant. The square is alive with color and motion, a kaleidoscope of existence, and I am part of it, a single thread in the tapestry of life. I rise, my steps steady and sure, and I move through the square, my heart a drumbeat of memory and resistance.\n\nThe street awaits, a path unfolding into the future, a canvas of echoes where past and present merge. I walk, the soles of my shoes brushing against the pavement with a steady, deliberate beat, and I am both here and elsewhere.

Given another chance. Here in this place where I am, too. Whether or not I pretend I can inhabit some impossibly different space. A place elsewhere in which I am neither exactly dead nor alive, where I am suspended, invisible, yet able to observe myself and observe G.F. as neither living nor dead. Despite absolute darkness, to observe G.F. here, to observe myself here, despite or because we are not present here, but elsewhere, nowhere in fact, or wherever anybody chooses to imagine or not imagine she or he might be. Wherever I\u2019m pretending I am.\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\nFor example, pretending not to breathe. A cop knee pressing down on the neck. Choking, suffocating me. How long. How long. Hands cuffed behind back. Cop body sits on my body pressing it down in a city street. Many shoes, boots shuffling too close to eyes. Wonder if they will stomp my eyes. Wonder what street. What city. Wonder how long dead while wondering.\n\nHow long. How long. How to make it real. Not to bid a victim, loved or unloved, adieu. Not to say farewell. Not leave-taking, not goody, good, goodbye. But return to scene of crime. Recount each blow like a senator on the Senate floor who produces cinema verit\u00e9 for his colleagues\u2014pounding rostrum POW-POW-POW-POW-POW\u2014fifty-six times in eighty-one seconds\u2014like cop fists, cop feet striking Rodney King\u2019s body fifty-six hard, loud times\u2014for eighty-one seconds\u2014ignite cities. Like the four hundred blows\u2014les quatre cents coups, as the French saying goes\u2014dirty tricks delivered blow after blow in a black-and-white movie for viewers to silently regard\u2014four hundred uncountable blows beating a boy to his knees. Different strokes for different folks in different countries. Same pain always. Whose. Whose blows. In whose language did the recorder hear Truffaut saying: I demand that a film either express the joy of making cinema or the agony of making cinema. I am not interested in anything in between.\n\nAs I read, I learn more about goodbyes, farewells to the dead, about narrative art, about protests, protesters, protestations, learn that the singer Esther Phillips, n\u00e9e Jones, born colored on December 23, 1935, in Galveston, Texas\u2014two days later and you could call her an Xmas present\u2014learn she recorded \u201cNo Headstone on My Grave,\u201d a Charlie Rich song, in 1962, eleven years before G.F. was born, with all his live years ahead of him before he\u2019s on his stomach on hard concrete or asphalt of a Minneapolis street begging for more breath, more life than he\u2019s going to get. Wondering how he hears, of all things, a blues/church-voiced woman singing words he can\u2019t quite make out, words gone quick as they come, quick as they go, but slow, too, and sad words, no doubt, very gotdamn sad brushing past, he whiffs thick sad on them, sad in a voice sad as blues and church, sad, slow, quick as a very last breath nobody ever hears anyway neck squeezed in a vise or not. . . .

        "story_a": "Sylvia sat on the edge of her bed, the evening light casting long shadows through the curtains. The room was heavy with the scent of lavender, a remnant of her mother\u2019s daily ritual. She glanced at the photograph on her bedside table\u2014her parents on their wedding day, smiling with a brightness that seemed almost foreign now. She traced the silver frame with her fingers, feeling the cool metal beneath her touch. Remembering was not a passive act; it was an act of defiance.\n\nHer father\u2019s voice echoed in her mind: \u201cThe past is a teacher, not a tyrant.\u201d He had said this often, usually when Sylvia\u2019s mother urged him to let go of old grievances, to move forward. But her father, with his quiet resolve, held on to every detail. He kept journals, meticulously cataloged, filled with memories and reflections. It was his way of resisting a world that seemed eager to forget.\n\nSylvia\u2019s own memories of her father were fragmented, like pieces of a shattered mirror. He had died when she was thirteen, his heart giving out under the strain of too many unspoken words. She remembered the way he would sit at the kitchen table, his hands clasped around a cup of coffee, staring into the distance as if searching for something just out of reach. Those mornings were silent, the air thick with unvoiced thoughts.\n\nHer mother, in contrast, embraced the present with a fervor that left little room for the past. \u201cWe must live for today,\u201d she would say, her voice bright and insistent. Sylvia had always found this sentiment hollow, a denial of the weight that the past carried. It was as if her mother were running from something, a shadow that grew longer with each passing year.\n\nNow, at twenty-seven, Sylvia felt the pull of her father\u2019s legacy more acutely than ever. She had inherited his journals, each one a testament to the power of memory. She spent hours poring over them, the pages yellowed and brittle, the ink fading but still legible. They were filled with stories\u2014his childhood in a small coastal town, his first love, the birth of Sylvia herself. Each entry was a piece of a larger mosaic, a map of a life lived in defiance of forgetting.\n\nOne journal, in particular, held her attention. It was the last one he had written, the entries growing more sporadic as his health declined. There was a passage that Sylvia returned to often, a reflection on the nature of memory itself: \u201cTo remember is to resist the erasure of our existence. It is to hold on to the threads that bind us to each other, to the world.\u201d\n\nThese words resonated with Sylvia, a mantra that guided her through the labyrinth of her own memories. She thought of her father\u2019s voice, the way it would rise and fall like the tide, carrying with it the weight of history. She remembered his hands, calloused and strong, the way they would cradle her face when she was a child, anchoring her in a world that often felt adrift.\n\nSylvia\u2019s own memories were a patchwork quilt, stitched together with threads of joy and sorrow. She remembered the scent of pine from their family trips to the mountains, the sound of her father\u2019s laughter as they huddled around a campfire. She remembered the silence of the hospital room, the beeping of machines that marked the passing of time with a cold precision. These memories were her inheritance, a legacy that she carried with her like a sacred trust.\n\nHer mother, meanwhile, had moved on in a way that Sylvia found both admirable and troubling. She had remarried, a man named Peter who was kind but distant, his presence a buffer against the encroaching past. They lived in a house filled with light, the walls adorned with cheerful paintings and the air filled with the sound of classical music. It was a life that seemed untouched by the weight of memory, a fresh start that Sylvia could not bring herself to embrace.\n\nOne evening, as she sat in her apartment, Sylvia received a call from her mother. There was a hesitation in her voice, a vulnerability that Sylvia had not heard in years. \u201cI found something,\u201d her mother said, her words measured and careful. \u201cIt\u2019s a letter, from your father. I think you should see it.\u201d\n\nSylvia felt a tightening in her chest, a familiar ache that had become a part of her. She agreed to meet her mother the next day, the anticipation gnawing at her like a persistent itch. When she arrived at her mother\u2019s house, the air was thick with unspoken words. They sat in the living room, the afternoon light casting a warm glow over the room.\n\nHer mother handed her the letter, the envelope worn and yellowed with age. Sylvia\u2019s hands trembled as she opened it, her eyes scanning the familiar handwriting. The letter was addressed to both Sylvia and her mother, a final message from a man who had always believed in the power of memory.\n\n\u201cMy dearest Sylvia and Margaret,\u201d it began. \u201cAs I write this, I am acutely aware of the passage of time, of the moments that slip through our fingers like sand. I want you both to know that my love for you is boundless, that it transcends the boundaries of life and death. Remembering is not a burden, but a gift. It is a way of keeping the flame of our existence alive, even in the darkest of times.\u201d\n\nSylvia\u2019s eyes filled with tears as she read the words, her father\u2019s voice echoing in her mind. She felt a profound sense of connection, a thread that linked her to a past that was both painful and beautiful. Her mother sat beside her, her eyes moist with unshed tears. For the first time in years, they shared a moment of unspoken understanding, a recognition of the weight they both carried.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Sylvia found herself drawn to her father\u2019s journals with renewed vigor. She saw them not just as a record of the past, but as a guide for the future. She began to write her own reflections, capturing the moments that defined her life, the memories that shaped her existence. It was an act of resistance, a way of asserting her presence in a world that seemed intent on erasure.\n\nHer mother, too, began to embrace the past in a way she had not before. They spent hours reminiscing, sharing stories that had long been buried under the weight of time. It was a process of healing, a way of bridging the gap between them. In those quiet moments, Sylvia felt the presence of her father, his spirit woven into the fabric of their lives.\n\nAs the years passed, Sylvia continued to honor the legacy of memory. She became a historian, dedicated to preserving the stories of those who had come before. Her work was a testament to the power of remembering, a way of resisting the erasure of existence. And in her own life, she found solace in the act of remembering, a way of keeping the flame of her father\u2019s love alive.\n\nIn the end, Sylvia understood that remembering was not just an act of defiance, but an affirmation of life itself. It was a way of holding on to the threads that bound her to the world, a testament to the enduring power of memory. And in that act of resistance, she found her own strength, a quiet resolve that carried her through the darkest of times.",
        "story_b": "The town of Elmwood was a place where stories lingered like the mist that rolled off the river at dawn, curling through the streets and slipping into the crevices of the old stone buildings. It was a town that refused to forget. Along Main Street, a mural stretched across the side of the library, a living tapestry of the town\u2019s tumultuous history. The mural was a gathering of faces, all watching, all remembering. It had been painted by generations, each adding their own brushstroke, a collective act of resistance against the fading of memory.\n\nAt the heart of Elmwood stood the Great Elm, its branches spreading wide like a grand storyteller weaving tales through the wind. Its roots delved deep, intertwining with the stories of those who gathered beneath it. Every year, on the first of May, the townspeople assembled around the Great Elm to recount the tale of the River Rebellion\u2014a series of events that authorities had long tried to erase from the annals of history.\n\nThe Rebellion had begun with whispers, a murmuring among the townsfolk that grew louder until it was a chorus of defiance. The river, once a source of life and prosperity, had been claimed by an outside corporation, its waters diverted for profit, leaving the town parched. But the people of Elmwood would not let their river be taken, nor their history washed away. They rose up, and though the struggle was hard-fought, they won back their river. The authorities tried to silence the story, but Elmwood remembered.\n\nMara, a woman whose lineage stretched back to the first settlers of Elmwood, was the keeper of the town's memories. She carried a locket around her neck, a small silver thing with a photograph of her great-grandmother, who had stood at the forefront of the Rebellion. Mara wore it as a talisman, a symbol of resistance and a reminder of where she came from. The scent of jasmine always lingered around her, a whisper of summers long past when her great-grandmother had tended to the garden by the river, the air thick with the sweet fragrance.\n\nMara's memories were not just her own; they were the town's, woven into her being. She often stood before the mural, tracing the faces with her fingertips, letting the rhythm of the past flow through her. The words of her great-grandmother echoed in her mind, \u201cWe remember, we resist, we endure.\u201d They were the heartbeat of the town, pulsing through every story told beneath the Great Elm.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the sky turned a deep indigo, Mara found herself wandering to the riverbank. The water shimmered under the moonlight, a silver thread stitching together past and present. She closed her eyes and let her thoughts drift, allowing memories to surface, like leaves floating to the surface of a pond.\n\nA flash of a childhood memory: her great-grandmother's voice, rich and warm, recounting the night the townspeople had gathered torches and marched to the river, a line of fire snaking through the darkness. They had stood shoulder to shoulder, their voices rising in song, a hymn of resistance that carried across the water, a promise that the river would flow free once more.\n\nAs Mara stood there, the past unfurled before her, not as a distant memory but as something vivid and alive. She imagined the faces of those who had fought, their determination etched into the landscape. She felt their resolve seep into her bones, a legacy of strength and defiance.\n\nHer reverie was broken by the sound of footsteps behind her. She turned to see a young boy, Simon, his eyes wide with curiosity. He was one of the newer members of the community, his family having moved to Elmwood just a year ago. Yet he had taken to the town's stories with a fervor that belied his age.\n\n\u201cMiss Mara,\u201d he said, his voice bright with the eagerness of youth, \u201cwill you tell me about the Rebellion again?\u201d\n\nMara smiled, gesturing for him to sit beside her on the bank. The memory of the Rebellion was a living thing, passed from one generation to the next, a thread connecting them all. As she spoke, the words flowed like the river, carrying with them the weight of the past, the promise of the future.\n\n\u201cThe river was ours,\u201d she began, the rhythm of her voice like a lullaby, \u201cand it was taken from us. But we didn\u2019t let it go.\u201d\n\nSimon listened, his eyes reflecting the moonlight, absorbing the history that was now part of his own. Mara's words painted images in the air, of nights filled with resolve, of the townspeople\u2019s unwavering spirit.\n\n\u201cWhy do they want us to forget?\u201d Simon asked, his brows furrowing in confusion.\n\n\u201cBecause remembering gives us power,\u201d Mara replied, her voice steady. \u201cWhen we remember, we resist. We hold onto what is ours. We endure.\u201d\n\nThe boy nodded, understanding settling over him like a mantle. He turned his gaze to the river, the water whispering its own stories, the tales of those who had come before and those yet to come.\n\nAs they sat in silence, the Great Elm loomed in the distance, its branches arching over the town like a guardian. It had witnessed generations, its roots entwined with the memories of Elmwood. Each ring of its trunk told a story, a testament to the resilience of the people who gathered beneath it.\n\nIn the days that followed, the town buzzed with preparations for the annual gathering. The mural was touched up, new faces added, their stories woven into the fabric of Elmwood\u2019s history. The scent of jasmine filled the air as Mara tended to the garden by the river, her great-grandmother\u2019s legacy living on in every bloom.\n\nOn the day of the gathering, the townspeople assembled beneath the Great Elm. The sun cast dappled shadows through its leaves, and the air hummed with anticipation. Mara stood at the forefront, the locket around her neck glinting in the light. She looked out at the faces before her, young and old, each carrying the weight of memory in their hearts.\n\nTogether, they began to speak, voices rising in a chorus of remembrance. They told of the River Rebellion, of the nights spent by the water, of the songs that had carried them through the darkness. They recounted the courage of those who had come before, whose stories were etched into the very soil of Elmwood.\n\nAs the sun set, the gathering drew to a close, but the memories lingered, woven into the fabric of the town, a tapestry of resistance and resilience. The Great Elm stood watch, its branches swaying gently in the breeze, a silent witness to the enduring power of memory.\n\nIn Elmwood, the past was never forgotten. It lived on in the stories told beneath the Great Elm, in the mural that stretched across the library, in the hearts of those who refused to let go. In remembering, they found strength. In resistance, they found unity. And in enduring, they found hope.",

        "ground_truth": "#Ghosts _It makes no difference what men think of war. War endures. As well ask men what they think of stone. War was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner. That is the way it was and will be. That way and not some other way._ Cormac McCarthy, Blood Meridian --- [Music: Deportation/Iguazu]( [Music: Alma]( --- The church stood mutely; shrouded yet in the long shadows of morning for the sun had not yet risen so high as to warm Sentinel just yet. But its light shone brilliant against the steep cliffs of the great Mesa beyond. Orange the color of burning phosphor descended slow and silent from the heights. It painted the rock and then the desert below that. Lit the world; made it glow. Lizards stalked among the rocks. Droning whir of windmill. No horse sounds. No hammer beats from the ferrier or blacksmith at his forges. No cluck of morning hens, no bray of donkeys or trundle of wagonwheels. A languid wind that withered as the sun came up. The town was empty. Abandoned. Sentinel was as improbable a place to settle as any in the southern New Mexico Territories in the 1850's. It was a desert town, with no railroad service and sat less than a days ride north of the border with Mexico. Once this had all been Apache land. It was taken by the Comanche who pushed them into northern Mexico and Texas and Arizona. Later Spaniards came and when they could not push out or defeat the natives, they sought to convert them. In consult with the Apache chiefs, the Spaniards were directed to build a Mission at the feet of a great Mesa and were guided by scouts to a site of spiritual importance. The Great Mesa. The monolith. The Sentinel. They built. But the priests didn't realize they had run afoul an Apache trick. These were Comanche lands the chiefs had instructed them to build on, and the Comanche sent a war party and they came in the night and slaughtered the priests and burned the mission. And the Comanche were emboldened by their victory and so began a campaign of incursions and depredations. For decades they raided up and down along the San Amarillas River, into northern Mexico and all along the borderlands. But from the night they scalped and bled those men of God, the Comanche had sealed their fate in the west, for they had brought the Spaniards into war with them, just as the Apache had planned and though the Comanche would expel them, they would not weather the years of strife that followed the arrival of European settlers as well. The Apache were able to return to their tribal lands and build settlements in the area again but it was not long before the Apache were once again forced from their lands, this time by the white man. The settlers built a church with a steeple over the old burned Spanish mission. New priests came. The graves of the Spaniards were buried over and their stone markers removed. That church with its bell tower stands in the Township of Sentinel still today. And it was the clang of its church bells, three rings of diminishing reverberation that woke the strangers in Sentinel that morning. That strange echo in the ears, that shudder of the ground. Above, raptors wheeled across the perfect blue of the sky and turned wide, lazy circles. Buzzards on the distant hills, a thin tendril of smoke visible behind the mesas spire. In the dusty town its streets lay bare and it's windows and doorways were haunted by expectant shadows. --- _Scene notes:_ _I've set the opening scene up so as to be a bit vague, where you each get to decide where in Sentinel your character awakens by selecting and playing a card against one of the Starting Location challenges.

        "story_a": "The first thing you notice upon awakening is the smell of dust\u2014ancient and pervasive, it clings to the dry air like a ghostly residue. You blink, your eyes adjusting to the dim light filtering through the cracked, stained-glass windows of what appears to be an old saloon. The bar, once polished to a warm sheen, now stands weathered and forgotten, its surface marred by time. Tables and chairs lie scattered in disarray, as if abandoned in haste, and a thick layer of dust covers every inch of the room.\n\nA sharp, metallic ringing pierces the silence, drawing your attention. The church bells. They toll with a haunting regularity, their echoes reverberating through the empty streets of Sentinel. The sound stirs something within you\u2014an elusive memory, half-formed and fleeting.\n\nYou sit up, wincing as a dull ache spreads through your limbs. Your clothes are worn but sturdy, a testament to long travels. A quick inventory of your possessions reveals a small leather satchel, a tarnished pocket watch, and a folded piece of parchment. You unfold the parchment with trembling fingers, revealing a rough map of the town. Sentinel. The name is scrawled in faded ink, accompanied by a series of cryptic symbols and notations.\n\nWhat brought you here? The question gnaws at the edges of your mind, but the answer remains just out of reach. You rise unsteadily to your feet, the floorboards creaking beneath your weight. The saloon door, hanging ajar on rusty hinges, beckons you into the unknown.\n\nOutside, the town of Sentinel lies shrouded in an eerie stillness. The buildings, once vibrant with life, now stand as hollow shells, their windows dark and empty. The main street stretches out before you, a desolate path flanked by crumbling facades. The mesa looms in the distance, its shadow casting a long, foreboding line across the town.\n\nYou hesitate, the oppressive silence pressing in from all sides. The church bells toll again, their mournful song urging you onward. With no other clear direction, you follow the sound, your footsteps echoing in the emptiness.\n\nAs you approach the church, you notice a figure standing in the doorway, cloaked in shadow. The figure watches you with an intensity that sends a shiver down your spine. You take a cautious step forward, and the figure steps out into the light\u2014a woman, her face etched with lines of worry and fatigue. Her eyes, however, are sharp and piercing, a stark contrast to the desolation around her.\n\n\"You're awake,\" she says, her voice tinged with relief and suspicion. \"I wasn't sure you would make it.\"\n\nYou frown, searching your fragmented memories for any recognition. \"Do I know you?\"\n\nShe shakes her head. \"Not yet. But we share a purpose, I think.\" She gestures for you to follow her inside the church. \"Come. There is much to discuss, and time is not on our side.\"\n\nInside the church, the air is cooler, the shadows deeper. The pews are empty, save for a few scattered personal items\u2014forgotten remnants of a congregation that once sought solace here. The woman leads you to the front, where a large, intricately carved altar stands. Behind it, a mural depicts a scene of both beauty and terror: a great mesa, with figures climbing its steep sides, reaching for the heavens while dark shapes lurk below.\n\nThe woman turns to face you, her expression grave. \"This town holds many secrets, but the most dangerous of all lies atop that mesa.\" She points to the mural. \"Something ancient and powerful slumbers there. It is our task to ensure it remains undisturbed.\"\n\nYou feel a chill run down your spine. \"Why me? Why am I here?\"\n\nShe studies you for a moment before answering. \"You were chosen, like many before you. Sentinel calls to those with a certain... connection to the past. Your arrival here is no accident.\"\n\nThe weight of her words settles heavily on your shoulders. The fragments of memory stir once more, elusive and tantalizingly close. \"What happens if we fail?\"\n\nThe woman\u2019s eyes darken. \"Then the town will be lost forever, and the darkness will spread beyond the mesa, consuming everything in its path.\"\n\nA sense of urgency grips you. Despite the gaps in your memory, you feel a deep-seated resolve. \"What do we need to do?\"\n\nShe smiles, a flicker of hope in her eyes. \"First, we must find the others. There are more like you\u2014scattered throughout the town, awakening to the same call. Together, we have a chance.\"\n\nWith that, she turns and leads you back outside, the church bells tolling once more. The sun hangs low in the sky, casting long shadows across the deserted streets. You glance at the map in your hand, the cryptic symbols taking on new meaning.\n\nAs you walk through the ghostly town, you can't shake the feeling that Sentinel is watching you, waiting. Each step brings a new discovery\u2014a locked door, a hidden passage, a whispered name carried on the wind. The town's secrets are many, and you sense that uncovering them will not be easy.\n\nYour path leads you to an old general store, its windows boarded up and its sign hanging precariously from a single nail. Inside, the air is thick with the smell of decay. Shelves stand empty, their contents long since pilfered or rotted away. You hear a faint rustling from the back room, and your heart quickens.\n\nPushing open the door, you find a young man crouched over a pile of dusty books, his face pale and drawn. He looks up, startled, as you enter.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he demands, his voice trembling with fear.\n\nYou hold up your hands in a gesture of peace. \"I'm here to help. We need to find the others.\"\n\nHe hesitates, then nods slowly. \"I thought I was alone. But if there are more of us...\"\n\nTogether, you leave the store and continue your search, your numbers growing as you find others\u2014each with their own story, their own fragments of memory. A sense of camaraderie forms, binding you together in your shared purpose.\n\nAs the sun sets, you gather in the town square, the shadow of the mesa looming ever larger. The woman from the church stands before you, her eyes shining with determination.\n\n\"We have much to do,\" she says, her voice strong. \"But together, we can protect Sentinel and uncover the truth of what brought us here.\"\n\nThe church bells toll once more, their echoes a haunting reminder of the task ahead. As you look around at the faces of your newfound companions, you feel a renewed sense of hope. The secrets of Sentinel are many, but you are no longer alone in facing them.\n\nAnd so, with the night closing in and the shadow of the mesa stretching ever wider, you take the first step on a journey that will test your courage, your resolve, and the very fabric of your soul. The town of Sentinel holds its breath, waiting to see if you will uncover its secrets or be consumed by them.",
        "story_b": "Sentinel lay still beneath the mesa, a ghostly tableau of forgotten dreams and whispered echoes. The sun, barely breaching the horizon, cast long shadows that stretched like spectral fingers across the cracked facades and dust-choked streets. The air was laden with the scent of dry earth and the faint tang of rust from the derelict vehicles abandoned in eternal vigil. A chill wind stirred, carrying with it the distant toll of church bells, their sound both mournful and eerily inviting, resonating through the emptiness with an unexplainable clarity.\n\nI awoke, disoriented, in what appeared to be an old saloon. The faded wallpaper peeled away from the wooden walls like layers of secrets long hidden. Dust motes danced in the shafts of pale light that filtered through the grimy windows, settling upon the bar where my few possessions lay scattered\u2014a worn leather satchel, a tarnished pocket watch, and a faded photograph of a face I couldn\u2019t quite recall.\n\nMy mind was a muddled landscape of fragmented memories, like pieces of a shattered mirror reflecting bits of a life I couldn\u2019t fully grasp. There was a sense of urgency, a feeling that something important lay just beyond the reach of conscious thought. But what was it? Why was I here in Sentinel, a place as empty and desolate as my own recollections?\n\nThe church bells tolled again, each chime a question echoing in the hollow cavity of my chest. I gathered my belongings, slipping the pocket watch into the pocket of my threadbare coat. The photograph I tucked carefully into the satchel, feeling a strange pull toward the eyes that gazed out from it, eyes that seemed to hold the key to whatever mystery enveloped me.\n\nStepping out into the street, I was struck by the town\u2019s eerie silence, a silence so profound it seemed alive, as though the very air held its breath in anticipation. Buildings leaned wearily against one another, their windows darkened like the eyes of the dead. The shadows of the mesa loomed over everything, shifting subtly as the sun climbed higher, their movement almost imperceptible yet undeniably real.\n\nAs I walked, my footsteps stirred the dust, leaving transient prints that the wind would soon erase. The church bells seemed to grow louder, their peals a constant, haunting companion. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that they were leading me, guiding me toward some revelation hidden within Sentinel\u2019s abandoned heart.\n\nPassing by what had once been a general store, its shelves barren and its sign swinging on rusted chains, I caught sight of a message scrawled in faded chalk on the board outside: \"The truth lies within.\" It was cryptic, yet I felt an inexplicable certainty that it was meant for me. But what truth? And why did it feel both ominous and strangely comforting?\n\nMy feet carried me inexorably toward the source of the bells, the old church standing sentinel at the edge of town. Its steeple reached skyward, a silhouette against the brightening sky. The doors, heavy and weathered, stood slightly ajar, as if inviting me to enter.\n\nInside, the air was cooler, the shadows deeper. The pews were empty, dust settled like a shroud upon them. At the front, a single candle flickered, its flame unwavering despite the drafts that whispered through the sanctuary. I moved toward it, drawn by an invisible thread that tugged at the corners of my mind.\n\nAs I approached the altar, my gaze fell upon a journal, its cover cracked and worn. Hesitantly, I picked it up, feeling the weight of untold stories within its pages. Opening it, I found entries written in a hand that seemed both familiar and foreign, the ink faded yet legible.\n\n_\"June 12th: They said Sentinel would prosper, a beacon beneath the mesa. But now, only shadows remain, and secrets buried deep.\"_\n\nThe words resonated, stirring echoes of recognition within me. I turned the pages, piecing together a narrative of hope turned to despair, of promises made and broken. Each entry felt like a step closer to understanding, yet the full picture remained elusive, tantalizingly out of reach.\n\n_\"August 5th: The bells ring, but no one comes. We are but ghosts now, lingering in the place we once called home.\"_\n\nThe bells tolled once more, their sound a constant reminder of the passage of time, of lives lived and lost. I closed the journal, my heart heavy with the weight of its revelations. Sentinel was more than a ghost town; it was a monument to forgotten dreams and unfulfilled destinies, its secrets entwined with my own fragmented past.\n\nAs I stood there, the shadows seemed to shift again, the light playing tricks upon the walls. I felt a presence, not malevolent but watchful, as if the town itself was aware, waiting for me to uncover what lay hidden in its silent streets.\n\nI left the church, stepping back into the light, the journal clutched in my hand like a lifeline. The bells had fallen silent, their echo lingering in the air. I knew there were answers to be found here, but also more questions, a labyrinth of mystery that I was only beginning to navigate.\n\nThe road stretched out before me, leading deeper into Sentinel\u2019s heart. With each step, the fragments of memory seemed to shift, rearranging themselves into a pattern I couldn\u2019t yet discern. But I would find the truth, piece by piece, in this town where past and present intertwined, where the shadows of the mesa whispered of secrets long buried.\n\nI walked on, into the unknown, driven by a purpose I couldn\u2019t yet name, in search of the life I had forgotten and the answers that awaited beneath Sentinel\u2019s watchful gaze.",

But its light shone brilliant against the steep cliffs of the great Mesa beyond. Orange the color of burning phosphor descended slow and silent from the heights. It painted the rock and then the desert below that. Lit the world; made it glow. Lizards stalked among the rocks. Droning whir of windmill. No horse sounds. No hammer beats from the ferrier or blacksmith at his forges. No cluck of morning hens, no bray of donkeys or trundle of wagonwheels. A languid wind that withered as the sun came up. The town was empty. Abandoned. Sentinel was as improbable a place to settle as any in the southern New Mexico Territories in the 1850's. It was a desert town, with no railroad service and sat less than a days ride north of the border with Mexico. Once this had all been Apache land. It was taken by the Comanche who pushed them into northern Mexico and Texas and Arizona. Later Spaniards came and when they could not push out or defeat the natives, they sought to convert them. In consult with the Apache chiefs, the Spaniards were directed to build a Mission at the feet of a great Mesa and were guided by scouts to a site of spiritual importance. The Great Mesa. The monolith. The Sentinel. They built. But the priests didn't realize they had run afoul an Apache trick. These were Comanche lands the chiefs had instructed them to build on, and the Comanche sent a war party and they came in the night and slaughtered the priests and burned the mission. And the Comanche were emboldened by their victory and so began a campaign of incursions and depredations. For decades they raided up and down along the San Amarillas River, into northern Mexico and all along the borderlands. But from the night they scalped and bled those men of God, the Comanche had sealed their fate in the west, for they had brought the Spaniards into war with them, just as the Apache had planned and though the Comanche would expel them, they would not weather the years of strife that followed the arrival of European settlers as well. The Apache were able to return to their tribal lands and build settlements in the area again but it was not long before the Apache were once again forced from their lands, this time by the white man. The settlers built a church with a steeple over the old burned Spanish mission. New priests came. The graves of the Spaniards were buried over and their stone markers removed. That church with its bell tower stands in the Township of Sentinel still today. And it was the clang of its church bells, three rings of diminishing reverberation that woke the strangers in Sentinel that morning. That strange echo in the ears, that shudder of the ground. Above, raptors wheeled across the perfect blue of the sky and turned wide, lazy circles. Buzzards on the distant hills, a thin tendril of smoke visible behind the mesas spire.

You blink, your eyes adjusting to the dim light filtering through the cracked, stained-glass windows of what appears to be an old saloon. The bar, once polished to a warm sheen, now stands weathered and forgotten, its surface marred by time. Tables and chairs lie scattered in disarray, as if abandoned in haste, and a thick layer of dust covers every inch of the room.\n\nA sharp, metallic ringing pierces the silence, drawing your attention. The church bells. They toll with a haunting regularity, their echoes reverberating through the empty streets of Sentinel. The sound stirs something within you\u2014an elusive memory, half-formed and fleeting.\n\nYou sit up, wincing as a dull ache spreads through your limbs. Your clothes are worn but sturdy, a testament to long travels. A quick inventory of your possessions reveals a small leather satchel, a tarnished pocket watch, and a folded piece of parchment. You unfold the parchment with trembling fingers, revealing a rough map of the town. Sentinel. The name is scrawled in faded ink, accompanied by a series of cryptic symbols and notations.\n\nWhat brought you here? The question gnaws at the edges of your mind, but the answer remains just out of reach. You rise unsteadily to your feet, the floorboards creaking beneath your weight. The saloon door, hanging ajar on rusty hinges, beckons you into the unknown.\n\nOutside, the town of Sentinel lies shrouded in an eerie stillness. The buildings, once vibrant with life, now stand as hollow shells, their windows dark and empty. The main street stretches out before you, a desolate path flanked by crumbling facades. The mesa looms in the distance, its shadow casting a long, foreboding line across the town.\n\nYou hesitate, the oppressive silence pressing in from all sides. The church bells toll again, their mournful song urging you onward. With no other clear direction, you follow the sound, your footsteps echoing in the emptiness.\n\nAs you approach the church, you notice a figure standing in the doorway, cloaked in shadow. The figure watches you with an intensity that sends a shiver down your spine. You take a cautious step forward, and the figure steps out into the light\u2014a woman, her face etched with lines of worry and fatigue. Her eyes, however, are sharp and piercing, a stark contrast to the desolation around her.\n\n\"You're awake,\" she says, her voice tinged with relief and suspicion. \"I wasn't sure you would make it.\"\n\nYou frown, searching your fragmented memories for any recognition. \"Do I know you?\"\n\nShe shakes her head. \"Not yet. But we share a purpose, I think.\" She gestures for you to follow her inside the church. \"Come. There is much to discuss, and time is not on our side.\"\n\nInside the church, the air is cooler, the shadows deeper. The pews are empty, save for a few scattered personal items\u2014forgotten remnants of a congregation that once sought solace here. The woman leads you to the front, where a large, intricately carved altar stands. Behind it, a mural depicts a scene of both beauty and terror: a great mesa, with figures climbing its steep sides, reaching for the heavens while dark shapes lurk below.\n\nThe woman turns to face you, her expression grave. \"This town holds many secrets, but the most dangerous of all lies atop that mesa.\" She points to the mural. \"Something ancient and powerful slumbers there. It is our task to ensure it remains undisturbed.\"\n\nYou feel a chill run down your spine. \"Why me? Why am I here?\"\n\nShe studies you for a moment before answering. \"You were chosen, like many before you. Sentinel calls to those with a certain... connection to the past. Your arrival here is no accident.\"\n\nThe weight of her words settles heavily on your shoulders. The fragments of memory stir once more, elusive and tantalizingly close. \"What happens if we fail?\"\n\nThe woman\u2019s eyes darken. \"Then the town will be lost forever, and the darkness will spread beyond the mesa, consuming everything in its path.\"\n\nA sense of urgency grips you. Despite the gaps in your memory, you feel a deep-seated resolve. \"What do we need to do?\"\n\nShe smiles, a flicker of hope in her eyes. \"First, we must find the others. There are more like you\u2014scattered throughout the town, awakening to the same call. Together, we have a chance.\"\n\nWith that, she turns and leads you back outside, the church bells tolling once more. The sun hangs low in the sky, casting long shadows across the deserted streets. You glance at the map in your hand, the cryptic symbols taking on new meaning.\n\nAs you walk through the ghostly town, you can't shake the feeling that Sentinel is watching you, waiting. Each step brings a new discovery\u2014a locked door, a hidden passage, a whispered name carried on the wind. The town's secrets are many, and you sense that uncovering them will not be easy.\n\nYour path leads you to an old general store, its windows boarded up and its sign hanging precariously from a single nail. Inside, the air is thick with the smell of decay. Shelves stand empty, their contents long since pilfered or rotted away. You hear a faint rustling from the back room, and your heart quickens.\n\nPushing open the door, you find a young man crouched over a pile of dusty books, his face pale and drawn. He looks up, startled, as you enter.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he demands, his voice trembling with fear.\n\nYou hold up your hands in a gesture of peace. \"I'm here to help. We need to find the others.\"\n\nHe hesitates, then nods slowly. \"I thought I was alone. But if there are more of us...\"\n\nTogether, you leave the store and continue your search, your numbers growing as you find others\u2014each with their own story, their own fragments of memory. A sense of camaraderie forms, binding you together in your shared purpose.\n\nAs the sun sets, you gather in the town square, the shadow of the mesa looming ever larger. The woman from the church stands before you, her eyes shining with determination.\n\n\"We have much to do,\" she says, her voice strong. \"But together, we can protect Sentinel and uncover the truth of what brought us here.\"\n\nThe church bells toll once more, their echoes a haunting reminder of the task ahead. As you look around at the faces of your newfound companions, you feel a renewed sense of hope. The secrets of Sentinel are many, but you are no longer alone in facing them.\n\nAnd so, with the night closing in and the shadow of the mesa stretching ever wider, you take the first step on a journey that will test your courage, your resolve, and the very fabric of your soul. The town of Sentinel holds its breath, waiting to see if you will uncover its secrets or be consumed by them.",
        "story_b": "The cold stone floor was the first sensation that pierced the fog of my consciousness, a chill leeching into my bones and drawing me awake. I lay still, the musty scent of neglect hanging heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of sagebrush that drifted through broken windows. As I opened my eyes, the dim light revealed a ceiling marred by cracks and water stains, a testament to years of abandonment. Sentinel, the name reverberated in my mind like a distant echo. I had heard of this place\u2014a ghost town shrouded in mystery and whispered legends.\n\nI pushed myself upright, my movements slow and deliberate as I took stock of my surroundings. Dust motes floated lazily in the shafts of light that filtered through the boarded-up windows, their dance a silent testament to the passage of time. The room was sparse, furnished only with a rickety chair and a table sagging under the weight of old newspapers and forgotten memories. A worn leather satchel lay at my side, its presence both reassuring and perplexing.\n\nRummaging through the bag, I found a few items: a tarnished silver locket, a faded photograph of a woman whose face was a blur of familiarity, and an old map with the edges frayed and yellowed with age. The map bore the name Sentinel, its streets and alleys sketched with meticulous detail. But it was the locket that stirred something deep within me\u2014a whisper of a memory, a fleeting image of a time and place I could not fully grasp.\n\nThe church bells tolled, their somber notes resonating through the silence, each peal sending a shiver down my spine. I rose to my feet, the weight of my uncertainty pressing down with every step. Each footfall was a question, each breath a search for answers. The emptiness of the town mirrored the void within me, a reflection of my fractured memories and the enigma of my presence here.\n\nThe streets of Sentinel lay before me, dusty and desolate, lined with crumbling facades that spoke of a forgotten past. The mesa loomed above, casting its shadow over the town, a silent guardian watching over its secrets. As I walked, the history of the place seemed to whisper from every crevice, the stories of its rise and fall etched into the very fabric of its being.\n\nI wandered past the old saloon, its windows shattered, the bar inside lined with dust-covered bottles and faded photographs that hinted at lives once vibrant and full. The wooden boards creaked under my weight, a sound that echoed through the hollow shell of the building. Each step felt like a gamble, a wager against the unknown, and yet something compelled me forward.\n\nThere was a pull towards the church, its weathered steeple piercing the sky, the bells now silent but their resonance lingering in the air. The door hung slightly ajar, inviting yet foreboding. I hesitated on the threshold, a wave of apprehension washing over me. But curiosity, the desperate need to piece together the puzzle of my existence, urged me onward.\n\nInside, the church was as I imagined: pews lined with dust, sunlight streaming through stained glass, casting fragmented rainbows onto the floor. The altar was bare, save for a lone candle whose wax had long since dried. It was here, in this place of quiet reverence, that I found the diary. Its leather cover was cracked with age, the pages yellowed and brittle. But the words within were clear, a chronicle of the town\u2019s life and, perhaps, its demise.\n\nThe diary belonged to a man named Samuel, a preacher who had come to Sentinel seeking solace and redemption. His words painted a picture of a town that had thrived once, only to crumble under the weight of its own secrets. There were tales of betrayal, of promises broken and truths buried beneath the mesa\u2019s shadow. But it was the final entry that caught my breath\u2014a mention of a stranger, a wanderer who had come seeking answers and left behind only questions.\n\nThe realization struck me like a thunderclap. Was I the stranger of Samuel\u2019s tale? Had I come to Sentinel searching for something lost, only to find myself ensnared by its mysteries? The diary offered no answers, only more questions, its pages now as silent as the town itself.\n\nAs I stepped out into the fading light, the sun dipping below the horizon, casting long shadows across the streets, I felt the weight of the locket around my neck. I opened it, the click of the clasp a finality that echoed in the silence. Inside was a picture of the woman from the photograph, her eyes holding a promise of familiarity, a connection I could not yet fathom.\n\nI stood there, at the crossroads of past and present, the town of Sentinel a testament to the passage of time and the secrets it held. I knew that the answers I sought were here, buried beneath the layers of history and my own fractured memories. The emptiness of the town was a mirror, reflecting the void within, but also the possibility of understanding and redemption.\n\nWith a deep breath, I turned towards the mesa, its shadow stretching long and dark across the landscape. The path ahead was uncertain, fraught with danger and discovery. But I would walk it, step by step, unraveling the threads of memory and uncovering the truth that Sentinel held in its silent embrace.",

The fragments of memory stir once more, elusive and tantalizingly close. \"What happens if we fail?\"\n\nThe woman\u2019s eyes darken. \"Then the town will be lost forever, and the darkness will spread beyond the mesa, consuming everything in its path.\"\n\nA sense of urgency grips you. Despite the gaps in your memory, you feel a deep-seated resolve. \"What do we need to do?\"\n\nShe smiles, a flicker of hope in her eyes. \"First, we must find the others. There are more like you\u2014scattered throughout the town, awakening to the same call. Together, we have a chance.\"\n\nWith that, she turns and leads you back outside, the church bells tolling once more. The sun hangs low in the sky, casting long shadows across the deserted streets. You glance at the map in your hand, the cryptic symbols taking on new meaning.\n\nAs you walk through the ghostly town, you can't shake the feeling that Sentinel is watching you, waiting. Each step brings a new discovery\u2014a locked door, a hidden passage, a whispered name carried on the wind. The town's secrets are many, and you sense that uncovering them will not be easy.\n\nYour path leads you to an old general store, its windows boarded up and its sign hanging precariously from a single nail. Inside, the air is thick with the smell of decay. Shelves stand empty, their contents long since pilfered or rotted away. You hear a faint rustling from the back room, and your heart quickens.\n\nPushing open the door, you find a young man crouched over a pile of dusty books, his face pale and drawn. He looks up, startled, as you enter.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he demands, his voice trembling with fear.\n\nYou hold up your hands in a gesture of peace. \"I'm here to help. We need to find the others.\"\n\nHe hesitates, then nods slowly. \"I thought I was alone. But if there are more of us...\"\n\nTogether, you leave the store and continue your search, your numbers growing as you find others\u2014each with their own story, their own fragments of memory. A sense of camaraderie forms, binding you together in your shared purpose.\n\nAs the sun sets, you gather in the town square, the shadow of the mesa looming ever larger. The woman from the church stands before you, her eyes shining with determination.\n\n\"We have much to do,\" she says, her voice strong. \"But together, we can protect Sentinel and uncover the truth of what brought us here.\"\n\nThe church bells toll once more, their echoes a haunting reminder of the task ahead. As you look around at the faces of your newfound companions, you feel a renewed sense of hope. The secrets of Sentinel are many, but you are no longer alone in facing them.\n\nAnd so, with the night closing in and the shadow of the mesa stretching ever wider, you take the first step on a journey that will test your courage, your resolve, and the very fabric of your soul. The town of Sentinel holds its breath, waiting to see if you will uncover its secrets or be consumed by them.",
        "story_b": "The chill of the morning air was the first sensation to claw its way through the fog of sleep, its bite sharp against the exposed skin of my arms. I shivered awake, eyes fluttering open to a bleak sky framed by the jagged silhouette of a crumbling window. Dust motes floated lazily in the weak sunlight that filtered through, casting ethereal patterns that danced across the warped floorboards. Somewhere in the distance, the solemn toll of church bells reverberated through the empty streets, their haunting melody echoing off the oppressive shadow of the great mesa that loomed like a sentinel over the town.\n\nI sat up gingerly, the ache in my limbs protesting the movement. The room around me was unfamiliar, a sepulchral chamber filled with the remnants of a life long forgotten. A faded locket hung heavy around my neck, its golden surface tarnished by time. Inside, a photograph so blurred and faded that the faces it once captured were now mere specters, ghosts of a past I couldn\u2019t recall. I clutched it tightly, a tangible connection to whatever thread of identity remained.\n\nThe air was thick with the scent of decay, mingling with the faint, acrid odor of charred wood. As I rose to my feet, the wooden floor creaked in protest, a mournful sigh that echoed through the desolate house. My mind was a fractured landscape, memories scattered like autumn leaves caught in a turbulent wind. Each one elusive, slipping away just as I reached for it.\n\nI stumbled through the doorway, out into the open maw of Sentinel\u2019s abandoned streets. The town lay in ruins, its once vibrant heart stilled by years of neglect. Buildings stood like sentinels themselves, their windows dark and hollow, watching with silent judgment. The pavement beneath my feet was cracked and uneven, weeds forcing their way through the jagged fissures, nature reclaiming what humanity had forsaken.\n\nA whisper of wind rustled through the trees, carrying with it the faintest hint of voices, murmurs that seemed to originate from the very stones of the town. I followed the sound, each step weighted with an inexplicable sense of purpose, as if I were being drawn inexorably toward something. Somewhere in the depths of my mind, fragments of a memory flickered\u2014a promise whispered in the dark, a vow to uncover the truth buried beneath Sentinel\u2019s dust-laden facade.\n\nThe church stood at the heart of the town, its steeple piercing the sky like a skeletal finger pointing accusingly at the heavens. The doors hung ajar, swinging gently in the breeze. I hesitated on the threshold, the echo of the bells still resonating in the hollow of my chest. As I stepped inside, the air grew cool, the shadows deepening into an almost tangible presence that wrapped around me like a shroud.\n\nPews lay overturned, splintered wood strewn across the floor in haphazard disarray. The altar stood intact, a solitary beacon in the gloom, its surface layered in a fine patina of dust. I traced a finger across its surface, disturbing the quiet sanctity, and as the dust swirled into the air, a memory unfurled in my mind\u2014a vision of faces, blurred and indistinct, gathered in solemn assembly beneath the vaulted ceiling.\n\nI turned away, eyes drawn to the stained glass windows that lined the walls, their vibrant colors dulled by neglect. Each pane depicted scenes from some forgotten story, their meaning lost to me. Yet as I stood there, bathed in the muted glow of fractured light, I felt an inexplicable connection to this place, as if the very essence of Sentinel were woven into the fabric of my being.\n\nThe memory faded, leaving in its wake a profound sense of loss. I retraced my steps, emerging once more into the sunlit street. The bells had fallen silent, leaving only the whisper of the wind as it danced through the empty town. I wandered aimlessly, drawn to the outskirts where the mesa cast its long shadow over all.\n\nAt the base of the mesa, I discovered a path, barely discernible beneath the tangle of weeds and brambles. It wound its way up the steep incline, a precarious trail that beckoned with the promise of revelation. I hesitated, the weight of uncertainty heavy on my shoulders. Yet something within me stirred, a yearning to understand the enigma of my presence in this forsaken place.\n\nThe climb was arduous, my breath coming in ragged gasps as I ascended. The sun hung low in the sky, casting the landscape in a warm golden glow that belied the town\u2019s cold desolation. As I reached the summit, I paused to catch my breath, the vista unfurling before me in breathtaking majesty. Sentinel lay spread out below, a patchwork quilt of shadows and light, its secrets hidden beneath layers of time and dust.\n\nI stood there, at the edge of the world, the wind whipping through my hair, carrying with it the faintest echoes of voices from the past. A sense of peace settled over me, the realization dawning that while the full truth might remain elusive, I was not alone. Sentinel was a part of me, its mysteries intertwined with my own.\n\nAnd as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of crimson and gold, I turned away, the path leading me back into the heart of the town. Sentinel's secrets were not mine to uncover in a single day, but the journey had begun. The locket lay heavy against my chest, a reminder of the path yet to be traveled, the stories yet to be told.\n\nIn the ghost town of Sentinel, beneath the watchful gaze of the great mesa, I had awakened. And though the past lay shrouded in mystery, the future stretched out before me, a tapestry waiting to be woven anew.",

Another kingdom so populated, yet so hauntingly distorted.\n\n\n\n\"...Well, I guess that's an age old question isn't it?\" Marco answered. His ribs still ached. \"I never thought of it. You see it as something new.

        "story_a": "Mossbrook Forest was shrouded in twilight, the air thick with the scent of pine and earth. The Wood Elves, delicate and graceful, moved silently through their domain, unseen by the untrained eye. Their skin seemed to blend seamlessly with the bark of the trees, their eyes gleaming like dew on a spider\u2019s web. To outsiders, they were whispers of the forest, harmless and serene.\n\nBut those who believed in their harmlessness had never met Liora.\n\nLiora, the youngest of her kin, stood at the heart of the forest, her hands resting on the trunk of an ancient oak. The tree pulsed with a slow, steady rhythm, a heartbeat of the land itself. She closed her eyes, feeling the life force of the forest flowing through her, connecting her to every root, leaf, and creature. \n\n\"Nature is balance,\" her mother had once told her. \"And balance requires strength.\" \n\nA rustling in the underbrush broke her reverie. Liora\u2019s eyes snapped open, pupils dilating as she scanned the shadows. A human intruder, clad in iron and leather, stumbled into the clearing. His eyes were wide with fear, his breath ragged.\n\n\"Please,\" he gasped, falling to his knees. \"Help me.\"\n\nLiora stepped forward, her movements as fluid as the wind. \"Why do you trespass in our realm?\" she asked, her voice a melodious whisper.\n\n\"The village... attacked by bandits... they set everything on fire,\" he stammered. \"I fled here, seeking sanctuary.\"\n\nLiora's eyes softened, but she knew better than to trust easily. \"Nature offers sanctuary to those who respect it. Do you?\"\n\nThe man nodded fervently. \"Yes, yes, I swear it!\"\n\nShe placed a hand on his forehead, feeling the truth of his words. His desperation was genuine, his fear a palpable force. \"Very well,\" she said, lifting her hand. \"But know this: Nature is not always kind.\"\n\nAs if on cue, the forest around them came alive. Vines snaked out from the ground, wrapping around the man's ankles, securing him in place. He gasped, but Liora held up a hand to silence him.\n\n\"Be still,\" she commanded. \"The forest is merely ensuring your sincerity.\"\n\nThe vines tightened momentarily, then loosened as if satisfied with his compliance. Liora turned away, walking deeper into the forest. The man hesitated, then followed, stumbling over roots and rocks. \n\nThey reached a grove where a circle of elder trees stood sentinel. Liora knelt before them, whispering words in the ancient tongue. The trees responded, their leaves rustling in a language older than time itself.\n\n\"We will aid your village,\" Liora said, rising. \"But you must promise to respect the forest and its guardians.\"\n\nThe man nodded, tears of relief streaming down his face. \"I promise.\"\n\nWith a nod from Liora, the trees began to move. Their roots pulled free from the ground, transforming into powerful legs. Bark hardened into armor, branches twisted into weapons. The forest had awakened, and it was not a gentle awakening.\n\nLiora led the march, her heart heavy with the knowledge of what was to come. The bandits had ignited a fury they could not comprehend. As they approached the village, the sky darkened, clouds gathering as if in response to the forest's wrath.\n\nThe bandits, seeing the living forest advancing, screamed and fled. But there was no escape. The trees moved with purpose, striking down those who had dared to disrupt the natural order.\n\nWhen the last of the bandits had fallen, the trees returned to their grove, roots sinking back into the earth. Liora stood at the edge of the village, watching the survivors emerge from their hiding places, eyes wide with awe and gratitude.\n\n\"Nature is balance,\" she whispered to herself. \"And balance requires strength.\"\n\nWith that, she turned and vanished into the forest, leaving the villagers to ponder the true power of the Wood Elves and the relentless force of Nature.",
        "story_b": "The forest shimmered under the gentle caress of dawn, its emerald canopy dappling sunlight onto the woodland floor below. Wood Elves moved gracefully among the trees, their delicate hands tending to vines and coaxing blooms from reluctant buds. The air was fragrant with the scent of pine and earth, a serene symphony of nature's finest notes. Yet beneath this tranquil facade, an ancient power simmered, as restless as a storm gathering on the horizon.\n\nA human traveler, Evan, entered the woodland realm, his heart set on discovering the secrets of the Wood Elves. He had heard tales of their harmony with Nature, of their reputed gentleness. But as he ventured deeper, the forest seemed to whisper, its voice curling around him like a warning: beware.\n\nAt first, the encounters were subtle. A deer, its eyes reflecting an uncanny intelligence, stood sentinel on his path before melting into the shadows. The trees themselves seemed to shift, their trunks creaking as if communicating in a language older than time. Evan shook off the feeling, attributing it to his own imagination.\n\nHe finally stumbled upon a grove, a circle of ancient oaks whose branches entwined above to form a natural cathedral. In its center stood a Wood Elf, her presence commanding and serene. She turned to him, her eyes the color of storm-tossed seas.\n\n\"You tread upon sacred ground, human,\" she intoned, her voice a blend of the wind's whisper and the river's murmur.\n\nEvan, emboldened by curiosity, stepped forward. \"I seek to understand your harmony with Nature,\" he admitted, \"to learn from your peace.\"\n\nThe Wood Elf smiled, a gesture that was both welcoming and foreboding. \"Then see, but know that Nature is not merely the gentle hand that nurtures.\"\n\nWith a wave of her slender fingers, the grove transformed. The ground trembled as roots surged upwards, weaving into a labyrinth that ensnared Evan's feet. The tranquil forest erupted into a cacophony of life as creatures emerged from the shadows, their eyes gleaming with a wild, untamed light.\n\nThe Wood Elf raised her arms, and the wind obeyed her command, swirling into a tempest that rustled through the leaves with a fierce, primal energy. Thunder rumbled in the distance, and Evan realized that the forest was alive, its spirit fierce and unyielding.\n\n\"Nature is balance,\" she declared, her voice rising above the storm. \"It is creation and destruction, life and decay. We are its guardians, its very essence.\"\n\nEvan's assumptions unraveled as he witnessed the true face of Nature, a force as beautiful as it was terrifying. The Wood Elves were not merely peaceful shepherds of the forest; they were embodiments of its duality, capable of summoning its wrath as easily as its grace.\n\nHumbled, Evan lowered his gaze. \"I see now,\" he murmured, \"the strength that lies within your harmony.\"\n\nThe storm abated, the forest settling back into its serene guise. The roots released their hold, and the creatures retreated, their presence lingering like a shadow.\n\nThe Wood Elf stepped forward, offering Evan a hand. \"Walk with us, learn our ways,\" she invited, \"and understand the true nature of the world.\"\n\nAs Evan took her hand, he felt a connection to the Earth itself, a bond forged not from domination, but respect. He had come seeking knowledge and found enlightenment, realizing that Nature's power lay not in its ferocity, but in its balance, a harmony the Wood Elves had mastered.\n\nTogether, they walked through the forest, the dawn light painting their path with hues of understanding. The Wood Elves were not mere custodians of peace; they were the heart of Nature's untamed soul.",

A human traveler, weary from his journey, stumbled into the clearing where the Wood Elves gathered. Elara, the eldest among them, sat cross-legged on a mossy log, her presence as serene as the moonlit stream nearby.\n\n\"You think the forest is just trees and streams?\" Elara's voice pierced the quiet, her eyes fixed on the traveler. \"It's a living force, and it doesn't take kindly to intruders.\"\n\nThe traveler chuckled nervously, glancing at the rustling leaves. \"I thought elves were all about peace and love.\"\n\nElara's laugh was a melody of irony. \"We don't just hug trees; we make sure they don't hug back too tightly.\"\n\nThe other elves gathered closer, their eyes twinkling with mischief. One of them, a young elf named Lira, leaned over with a grin. \"You call it a gentle breeze; we call it a warning.\"\n\n\"Warnings?\" The traveler echoed, his bravado waning.\n\n\"Nature's got a sense of humor, and it's not always in your favor,\" Elara continued, her fingers weaving through the air as if conducting an unseen orchestra. The trees seemed to respond, their branches swaying in a rhythm only they understood.\n\n\"You see, Nature's not just a backdrop; it's the main act, and we're just the audience,\" Lira added, nudging the traveler with her elbow.\n\nThe traveler cleared his throat, attempting to regain his composure. \"Well, I\u2019m here to negotiate. My people wish to build a settlement here.\"\n\nElara's eyes glimmered with amusement. \"You want to build here? First, you must understand what you're dealing with.\"\n\n\"Is it really that dangerous?\" he asked, skepticism lacing his words.\n\nElara gestured to the forest around them. \"These woods are alive. The plants, the animals, even the earth itself\u2014each has a spirit, a will of its own. We live in harmony because we respect that.\"\n\nAs if on cue, a vine slithered across the ground, curling around Elara's wrist like a pet snake. She patted it affectionately. \"See? Nature responds to kindness.\"\n\nThe traveler watched, awe replacing his doubt. \"So, what do I need to do?\"\n\n\"Listen,\" Elara replied simply. \"Listen to the trees; they have stories to tell.\"\n\nThe traveler nodded, attempting to mimic Elara's meditative pose. The forest seemed to lean in, its whispers brushing against his consciousness. He felt the weight of centuries in the rustling leaves, the wisdom of ages in the creaking branches.\n\n\"Survive here, and the forest might just accept you,\" Lira quipped, her playful tone masking the gravity of her words.\n\nThe traveler opened his eyes, meeting Elara's gaze. \"I understand. We must respect what we don't fully grasp.\"\n\nElara smiled, a gentle, approving nod. \"Exactly. Nature is not to be underestimated. It\u2019s powerful, unpredictable, and sometimes, downright mischievous.\"\n\nAs the evening wore on, the traveler found himself enveloped in the elves' laughter and stories, their words weaving a tapestry of humor and truth. He realized that the harmony the Wood Elves spoke of was not born of naivety but of a profound respect for the forces that governed their world.\n\nWhen the time came for him to leave, the traveler felt a newfound reverence for the forest. As he disappeared into the twilight, Elara watched him go, her heart light with hope.\n\n\"Think he'll make it?\" Lira asked, her tone teasing.\n\nElara shrugged, a smile tugging at her lips. \"If he listens, perhaps. But if not... well, Nature's lessons are always memorable.\"",

        "ground_truth": "\"You fight the land. Why?\"\n\n\nHe asked the traveler. A despondent look across his face. \"Why?\"\n\n\nThe younger man simply pushed\u00a0himself a bit off the bed to look at him. The wraps covering his wounds stretching at the effort.\n\n\n\"Have to.\" He grimaced. \"Have to survive somehow.\"\n\n\nThe ears twitched at this. The elf running a hand over his beard.\n\n\n\"I'll never understand it.\" He remarked. \"Mortals. You can't comprehend magick like us. You can only use your might and your mind.\"\n\n\nHe stood and took stock of the odd items littering the table nearby. A leather pouch\u00a0full of odd paper and some odd bendy cards. The strangest playing cards Aristeinn had ever seen.\n\n\nA headpiece similar to what a paladin or knight would wear. But it was smooth. Light. Like no metal he'd expect. A colorful design circling the edges. A ring of keys, of which he couldn't begin to guess unlocked.\n\n\n\nTwo small handheld devices. Some tome of some sort? Aristeinn ran his hand over the odd symbols dotting raised lumps.\n\n\n\"No-ki-a?\" He asked over his shoulder. \"Is that your name?\"\n\n\n\"...No.\"\n\n\nAnd the last item, it was a handle, seemingly for a knife. But there was no blade. Until he poked the small latch he found and a blade sprang free from the handle.\n\n\n\"Interesting!\" Aristeinn remarked. \"I must say. You are a troubled lot. Always attacking our realm. But I must say, the craftsmanship is quite impressive.\"\n\n\nHe approached with the knife. The traveler wary of it for some reason. But he sat it in an open palm of theirs. Waiting until the young man worked the action and slowly closed the knife against a thigh.\n\n\n\"Why have you cut such paths that separate our worlds apart? How?\"\n\n\n\"Paths?\" The traveler spoke. \"What paths?\"\n\n\n\"Our land, our home. It shrinks by the day, it seems. To you, it might be a lifetime.\" Aristeinn explained. \"But to me. It was like last night. This forest. The land. It stretched forever.\"\n\n\nMarco eyed the pair of men outside the door. Swords at their sides. A lack of emotion in their faces.\n\n\n\"But, I've seen glimpse of the next world.\" Aristeinn carried on. \"The world linked to ours. How much you've claimed. How much you've uprooted.\"\n\n\n\"And?\" Marco urged carefully.\n\n\n\"What does defeating nature so harshly serve such men?\"\n\n\nThe elf seemed disturbed in his findings. Another kingdom so populated, yet so hauntingly distorted.\n\n\n\n\"...Well, I guess that's an age old question isn't it?\" Marco answered. His ribs still ached. \"I never thought of it. You see it as something new. It's been there forever to me.\"\n\n\n\nHe gave life to the idea. \"I'm used to it.\"\n\n\n\"Was it always like this?\"\n\n\n\"No. But that's how it is.\"\n\n\n\"You may serve your king as you wish.\" Aristeinn warned. \"But here, we rule with impunity. It'd be wise to show our woods respect. Or else.\"\n\n\n\"I can barely move.\" Marco muttered. \"It's not like I'm going anywhere anytime soon.\"\n\n\nWith that the elf stood and went back to the door. A weary look on his face.\n\n\n\n\"Very well.\" He sneered. \"Nirmala, you can keep this guest until he heals. But he is to be removed as soon as able.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, your majesty.\"\n\n\n---\n\n\nThe pair of them stared at the trees as they walked.\n\n\n\"...Shay, maybe he's dead up in here.\"\n\n\n\"He's not dead. I'm telling you.\"\n\n\nA tug on his shoulder caused him to look at the face in the dimming sunlight.\n\n\n\n\"You saw the wreck.\" Aurelio remarked as he messed with his bag. \"It looks like-\"\n\n\n\"If he's dead. Rillo?\" Shay waved the light like a fist, \"Where's the body?\"",
        "story_a": "Mossbrook Forest was shrouded in twilight, the air thick with the scent of pine and earth. The Wood Elves, delicate and graceful, moved silently through their domain, unseen by the untrained eye. Their skin seemed to blend seamlessly with the bark of the trees, their eyes gleaming like dew on a spider\u2019s web. To outsiders, they were whispers of the forest, harmless and serene.\n\nBut those who believed in their harmlessness had never met Liora.\n\nLiora, the youngest of her kin, stood at the heart of the forest, her hands resting on the trunk of an ancient oak. The tree pulsed with a slow, steady rhythm, a heartbeat of the land itself. She closed her eyes, feeling the life force of the forest flowing through her, connecting her to every root, leaf, and creature. \n\n\"Nature is balance,\" her mother had once told her. \"And balance requires strength.\" \n\nA rustling in the underbrush broke her reverie. Liora\u2019s eyes snapped open, pupils dilating as she scanned the shadows. A human intruder, clad in iron and leather, stumbled into the clearing. His eyes were wide with fear, his breath ragged.\n\n\"Please,\" he gasped, falling to his knees. \"Help me.\"\n\nLiora stepped forward, her movements as fluid as the wind. \"Why do you trespass in our realm?\" she asked, her voice a melodious whisper.\n\n\"The village... attacked by bandits... they set everything on fire,\" he stammered. \"I fled here, seeking sanctuary.\"\n\nLiora's eyes softened, but she knew better than to trust easily. \"Nature offers sanctuary to those who respect it. Do you?\"\n\nThe man nodded fervently. \"Yes, yes, I swear it!\"\n\nShe placed a hand on his forehead, feeling the truth of his words. His desperation was genuine, his fear a palpable force. \"Very well,\" she said, lifting her hand. \"But know this: Nature is not always kind.\"\n\nAs if on cue, the forest around them came alive. Vines snaked out from the ground, wrapping around the man's ankles, securing him in place. He gasped, but Liora held up a hand to silence him.\n\n\"Be still,\" she commanded. \"The forest is merely ensuring your sincerity.\"\n\nThe vines tightened momentarily, then loosened as if satisfied with his compliance. Liora turned away, walking deeper into the forest. The man hesitated, then followed, stumbling over roots and rocks. \n\nThey reached a grove where a circle of elder trees stood sentinel. Liora knelt before them, whispering words in the ancient tongue. The trees responded, their leaves rustling in a language older than time itself.\n\n\"We will aid your village,\" Liora said, rising. \"But you must promise to respect the forest and its guardians.\"\n\nThe man nodded, tears of relief streaming down his face. \"I promise.\"\n\nWith a nod from Liora, the trees began to move. Their roots pulled free from the ground, transforming into powerful legs. Bark hardened into armor, branches twisted into weapons. The forest had awakened, and it was not a gentle awakening.\n\nLiora led the march, her heart heavy with the knowledge of what was to come. The bandits had ignited a fury they could not comprehend. As they approached the village, the sky darkened, clouds gathering as if in response to the forest's wrath.\n\nThe bandits, seeing the living forest advancing, screamed and fled. But there was no escape. The trees moved with purpose, striking down those who had dared to disrupt the natural order.\n\nWhen the last of the bandits had fallen, the trees returned to their grove, roots sinking back into the earth. Liora stood at the edge of the village, watching the survivors emerge from their hiding places, eyes wide with awe and gratitude.\n\n\"Nature is balance,\" she whispered to herself. \"And balance requires strength.\"\n\nWith that, she turned and vanished into the forest, leaving the villagers to ponder the true power of the Wood Elves and the relentless force of Nature.",
        "story_b": "The air was thick with the scent of pine and wildflowers as Mark stumbled through the forest, each step crunching against the carpet of fallen leaves. He had heard tales of the Wood Elves, mystical beings thought to be as gentle as the breeze that rustled the branches overhead. But as he ventured deeper, curiosity nagging at him, he found himself questioning the stories.\n\n\"Lost, are you?\" A voice, smooth and tinged with amusement, drifted from the shadows. Mark turned to find an elf perched on a low-hanging branch, her eyes glinting like sunlight on a stream.\n\n\"I, uh, was just\u2014\"\n\n\"Exploring?\" she interrupted, leaping gracefully to the ground. \"Or perhaps seeking something more... enlightening?\" Her smile was both welcoming and unsettling.\n\n\"Just curious,\" Mark replied, attempting nonchalance. \"I've heard a lot about you elves.\"\n\n\"And what have you heard?\" she asked, her tone playful yet probing.\n\n\"That you live in harmony with Nature. Peaceful, harmless.\" The words felt foolish as he spoke them.\n\nThe elf laughed, a sound like wind chimes caught in a storm. \"Harmless? My dear human, Nature is anything but.\"\n\nAs if to punctuate her point, a breeze picked up, whispering through the treetops. The elf gestured, and the wind swirled around them, lifting leaves into a graceful dance. \"We are guardians, yes, but also warriors when need be.\"\n\nMark's skepticism faltered. \"You mean you can control... all this?\"\n\nShe shrugged, a casual elegance in the motion. \"We don't control. We ask, and Nature listens.\"\n\n\"So, what? You just... talk to trees?\" he joked, though a part of him was intrigued.\n\n\"Precisely,\" she replied, her eyes twinkling with mischief. \"And they talk back. Would you like a demonstration?\"\n\nBefore he could respond, the elf raised her hand, and the forest seemed to hold its breath. The ground trembled softly, and Mark watched in awe as roots snaked across the earth, weaving a net that rose around him. Flowers bloomed at his feet, their petals vibrant against the forest floor.\n\n\"Okay, that's... wow.\" Mark's voice was a mix of wonder and disbelief.\n\nThe elf chuckled softly. \"A simple trick, but effective. We prefer to live in balance, but we are not without power.\"\n\nMark looked around, feeling the pulse of life in every root and leaf. \"So, what's the point of all this? Just showing off?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she admitted with a grin. \"Or perhaps to teach you a lesson.\"\n\n\"A lesson?\"\n\nThe elf nodded, her expression turning serious. \"Harmony requires strength. Peace is not the absence of power, but its careful use.\"\n\nMark pondered this, feeling the weight of her words. \"I guess I underestimated you.\"\n\n\"Most do,\" she replied, her voice gentle. \"But understanding is the first step to respect.\"\n\nHe nodded, the forest around him now a place of both beauty and mystery. \"So, you ever think about, you know, expanding your circle? Teaching a human a trick or two?\"\n\nThe elf's smile was enigmatic. \"Perhaps. But only if they are willing to listen.\"\n\nMark looked at her, then at the vibrant life surrounding him. The allure of such knowledge tugged at him, mingling with a newfound respect. \"I might be up for it,\" he said slowly.\n\nThe elf inclined her head. \"Then perhaps you will find what you seek.\"\n\nAs she turned to leave, the leaves whispered in her wake, and Mark stood alone, contemplating the path he might yet take. The forest, once just a collection of trees, now felt like a doorway to something greater. And as he started back, he wondered if he would ever see the world in quite the same way again.",

What secrets does her gray corner hold, and what does it mean for a world that forgot how to live without color?",
        "ground_truth": "The whole world could still be gray, as it was in the past, in those old movies. But then one day colors came, sometime between then and here. I think it must have been the wars. After the wars people said, We need some reason to be less upset. Someone suggested, Colors? The world agreed that colors were needed, to pull everyone out of the despair of the dying, and all those piled-up bones. Colors were brought in. They were just carted in on trucks, and everyone took their fill. It was a job for every person on the planet to put colors where they ought to be. Some things were decided in advance, like making the grass green, and you\u2019d get a ticket if you made yours red or blue. But other things you could decide, like the color of your shirt. It was a small committee of people who made the big decisions, they were necessary, but then so was every humble individual, doing their own job. The world sighed in relief: everything was so much more beautiful now! And for several days there were no wars, just people enjoying the colors, but humans adapt quickly to what is beautiful and nice, and then the wars started up again, and the committee was disbanded.\n\nA long time ago I was part of this committee\u2014not the original one, but the commemorative one, made up of the committee\u2019s daughters. We gathered to take notes about what had really happened in those conversations, so that we could tell the world. We asked our fathers, What was it like to be on the committee? How did the meetings go? But they had lost their memories, some of them, and others were angry at the other committee members, and wouldn\u2019t tell us why. We gathered very little information to save for the world, for posterity. Then we disbanded, too. We said to ourselves, Let\u2019s just enjoy the colors. Who cares how they got here? So we did. We became just like everyone else, not archivists of the past, but regular folks walking through the colors of the present, as if we didn\u2019t know anything.\n\nThen, one day, Amanda thought we should actually just talk to the people of the world who had participated in dispersing colors over the land, just regular folk, the ones who did it. The rest of the daughters were tired, but I wanted to do it with her, because I liked her and it sounded fun. I asked if she thought I should bring my movie camera, and she said yes, we could make a documentary. We went to a little town and just stood in the square and accosted people who were going about their Sunday shopping and asked them what it was like when there started to be colors, and had they participated in coloring everything? We only asked the old people. Most people didn\u2019t want to talk to us, but one old woman did. She invited us back to her apartment for tea.\n\nHer apartment was full of colors, just like the rest of the world, except for one corner, which was still gray. It was her own secret corner that hadn\u2019t been colored\u2014perhaps the only place in the world like this! The world would have been agitated to know that a corner had not been filled in; but she said that in fifty years, sixty, seventy, she had not let anyone in. She preferred to give up husbands and friends, so she could keep one corner of the world not colored.\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\nIt was clearly restful to her to have it, as restful as a little gray mouse that\u2019s a friend. Oh, she told us, as she spoke for the camera, avoiding eye contact with it, her fingers playing with her teacup on her little china saucer, it was all anyone could talk about\u2014what color are you going to make this? What color are you going to make that? Isn\u2019t it all so beautiful now? How did we ever live with all that grayness? Why did it take the world so long? Isn\u2019t it nice how we are all co\u00f6perating?\n\nShe was making little sour expressions as she imitated those people from so long ago, many of whom were dead now, she said. She had got into the craze for a little while too, coloring everything in sight, even things that weren\u2019t in her jurisdiction to color, like the neighbor\u2019s fencing.\n\nBut one day she returned to her apartment, where she hadn\u2019t yet filled in the corner. She had been coloring other things, she had just put it off. She thought, I\u2019m tired, I\u2019ll do it tomorrow. She told us this with downcast eyes. And what happened? Well, tomorrow turned into tomorrow, as it does for so many of us. It kept appearing on her to-do list, like one of those items that are there for so many months you don\u2019t even notice them anymore. And the months turned to years, and somehow she never did it. What is it with those things that never make it off the list? Is it that we actually don\u2019t want to do them? Or that we don\u2019t even need to do them? We put them on there because we think we should. Why don\u2019t we just take them off already? So finally she took it off, and by that time the world didn\u2019t even have enough color left that she could use to fill in the corner.\n\nShe stayed in that apartment\u2014various friends encouraged her to move, for the immigrants were moving into her building, and so her friends thought that she ought to move. But, although she wasn\u2019t a fan of the immigrants, she didn\u2019t mind them so much, they were nice neighbors, and that dull corner reassured her in a funny little way. She looked at it every day as she took her tea. No, she didn\u2019t have anybody over, and, yes, her lovely immigrant neighbors thought she was a snob, but really what was she supposed to do if one of them found out, and said something to somebody? She couldn\u2019t take the risk. And so she didn\u2019t take the risk. She finally stood up to let us out, very very sadly. She told us to please not air our documentary, or write about it, until she died. She wanted to live with that little corner like that until she died, and not be taken away or to jail, or for somebody from some committee to come and color it in, so we agreed, because we felt sorry for her, and we liked her.\n\nWell, she finally died last year, and next week our documentary airs, but we are sad about it. Mostly we wish we hadn\u2019t been waiting for this anniversary, the one-year anniversary of her death, with the sort of desire everyone feels to show the world what they\u2019ve made. We\u2019re proud of the short film we created, and that we found this story, but not that she had to die in order for us to put it into the world. Better that she had lived, and lived with her corner, than that we got to show our film. Why is there always so much sadness when something good occurs, a balance between the good and the bad? Couldn\u2019t she have said, Show your film to the world! and felt safe that no one cared any longer about one little corner not being filled in? No, but perhaps she knew something we did not, about colors, and grayness, and corners, and what is allowed to you in your privacy, in your tiny little apartment, and what is not.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The apartment building at 231 West End Avenue had a curious shade of coral on its facade, a color mandated by city ordinance. The hues were supposed to invigorate, to remind the inhabitants of the vibrancy that had been legislated into their lives. But behind the fourth window from the left, on the sixth floor, lived an old woman who kept a secret.\n\nWhen Amelia first visited, drawn by a notice from the Historical Aesthetics Society seeking volunteers to catalog remnants of the pre-color era, she hadn\u2019t expected to find anything more than dusty artifacts. The building's superintendent, a stooped man with nicotine-stained fingers, led her up the narrow staircase. \n\n\"Miss Eliza doesn't like visitors much,\" he warned, tapping a knobby knuckle against the door.\n\nThe door creaked open, revealing a diminutive figure swathed in a housecoat of muted lavender, a concession to the world outside. Her eyes, sharp and wary, settled on Amelia. \"You're here about the history,\" she stated, a hint of irony coloring her voice.\n\nInside, the apartment was a riot of prescribed colors: sunflower yellow cushions, a cerulean rug, and walls painted a shade of green so vivid it seemed to hum. But in the far corner of the living room, beyond the array of mandatory vibrancy, stood a curtain. It was gray, a relic from the days when the world was shrouded in what they called \"the Great Dullness.\"\n\nAmelia moved closer, compelled by the curtain\u2019s quiet defiance. Eliza watched her, a subtle nod giving permission to unveil what lay beyond. Amelia drew the fabric aside, revealing a corner untouched by the chromatic decree. It was a small alcove, the walls bare and unpainted, a simple wooden chair and a table standing as solemn sentinels. On the table, a photograph, black and white, its edges curled with age.\n\n\"Why?\" Amelia whispered, more to herself than to Eliza.\n\nEliza's voice was soft, almost conspiratorial. \"Some things should remain as they were, lest we forget who we were.\"\n\nAmelia turned, the photograph now in her hands. It depicted a younger Eliza with a man and a child, their expressions solemn but content. \"My husband, Daniel, and our son, Martin,\" Eliza explained. \"We lost them to the fever, just before the colors came.\"\n\nThe fever had been the great scourge, the reason for the legislation that followed. It was believed that color would drive away the melancholy that had settled over the populace, a psychological balm to the collective wound. \n\n\"Do you miss them?\" Amelia asked, feeling the inadequacy of her words.\n\nEliza sighed, a sound that seemed to carry the weight of years. \"Every day. But more than missing them, I miss the honesty of that time. The grayness was real. It reflected our grief, our struggles. This,\" she gestured to the room, \"is a mask.\"\n\nAmelia felt a chill, despite the warmth of the room. She had grown up in a world of mandated cheerfulness, where even the sky was sometimes tinted to match the city planners' vision of a perfect day. She had never questioned it, never thought to look beyond the color.\n\n\"What does it mean for you, keeping this gray corner?\" she asked.\n\nEliza's eyes softened, a hint of a smile playing at her lips. \"It means remembering. It means acknowledging that life isn't always bright, that it's okay to sit in the shadow now and then.\"\n\nAmelia nodded, understanding dawning. The world had moved on, painted over its sorrow, but in doing so, it had lost a part of itself. The gray corner was a testament to the resilience of memory, a quiet rebellion against the tyranny of enforced happiness.\n\nThey sat in silence for a while, the muted tones of the alcove wrapping around them like a protective cocoon. Amelia felt a sense of peace she hadn't known she needed, a connection to a past she had never lived but now, somehow, understood.\n\nAs she rose to leave, Eliza pressed the photograph into her hand. \"Keep it,\" she said. \"A reminder.\"\n\nAmelia accepted the gift, feeling its weight, both literal and metaphorical. She left the apartment with a new perspective, the gray corner imprinted on her mind. \n\nIn the weeks that followed, she found herself drawn to places where the colors seemed less forced, where the natural wear and tear revealed glimpses of the world beneath. She began to notice the small acts of defiance scattered throughout the city: a patch of unpainted brick, a door left in its original state, a faded sign that had escaped the brush of regulation. \n\nThese discoveries led her to others like Eliza, keepers of forgotten truths, guardians of the gray. Each had their own story, their own reasons for preserving a piece of the past. Together, they formed a quiet network, a collective memory that resisted the homogeny of the present.\n\nOne evening, Amelia found herself back at Eliza's door. She knocked, and the old woman greeted her with the same wary eyes, though now softened by recognition.\n\n\"I've been thinking,\" Amelia began, \"about what you said, about remembering.\"\n\nEliza nodded, gesturing for her to enter. \"It's important,\" she said simply.\n\n\"I want to help,\" Amelia continued. \"I want to make sure others remember too.\"\n\nEliza's smile was slow to form, but when it did, it was genuine. \"You already are, my dear. You already are.\"\n\nThe two women sat in the gray corner, sharing stories of a world that had tried to forget its pain, and in doing so, had nearly lost its soul. They talked late into the night, the shadows lengthening around them, the colors outside dimming as if in reverence to their quiet rebellion.\n\nThe photograph remained with Amelia, a symbol of her newfound purpose. It reminded her that in a world painted with the brush of enforced vibrancy, there was still a place for the honest hues of life\u2019s more somber moments. The gray corner had taught her that true resilience wasn\u2019t in the bright facade, but in the acceptance of all that had come before. It was a lesson she carried with her, a quiet rebellion of her own against a world that had forgotten how to live without color.",
        "story_b": "In a world painted with every hue imaginable, where each dawn burst with a kaleidoscope of colors designed to erase the memory of a gray past, I found myself drawn to a place devoid of such vibrancy. It was a tiny corner of the city, hidden in the shadows of towering skyscrapers, where an old woman had quietly defied the colorful decree. Her apartment, tucked away in an unassuming building, held a secret\u2014a corner untouched by the mandated spectrum, a pocket of gray in a world that had forgotten how to live without color.\n\n\"Have you ever wondered what lies beneath the colors we paint our lives with?\" I often asked myself as I navigated the bustling streets, where even the pavement seemed to shimmer with iridescent charm. I was a curator of sorts, tasked with ensuring that the city's colors were appropriately vivid, that no corner remained drab or dreary. Yet, something about the old woman\u2019s quiet rebellion called to me, prompting questions I'd long suppressed: \"Is color merely a distraction from the true shades of life?\"\n\nThe day I visited her, the air was thick with the scent of rainbows\u2014manufactured, of course, by the city's atmospheric engineers. She greeted me at her door with a knowing smile, her eyes twinkling like forgotten stars. \u201cCome in,\u201d she said, her voice a soft whisper that seemed to echo the gentle embrace of shadows.\n\nHer apartment was a riot of colors, like every other home, but in one corner, she had preserved a space untouched by the mandate. It was as though I had stepped into another world, one where the soft whispers of dust settled gently on untouched surfaces, where shadows danced in the absence of light. I stood there, transfixed, as if the grayness held an eerie presence that prompted deeper reflection.\n\n\u201cWhat secrets does this gray corner hold?\u201d I asked, more to myself than to her. She chuckled softly, the sound like a breeze rustling through forgotten leaves.\n\n\u201cIn the gray,\u201d she began, her voice weaving through the silence, \u201cI found the colors of my true self.\u201d\n\nHer words lingered in the air, a silent symphony of forgotten notes, and I felt something shift within me. This grayness, this absence of color, was not a void, but a canvas for authenticity, a mirror reflecting hidden depths that vibrant hues could never reveal. \u201cWhat if the absence of color reveals the true hues of our existence?\u201d I pondered, feeling the weight of my own question.\n\nI sat with her in the gray corner, feeling its serene embrace, its untouched stillness contrasting starkly with the vibrant chaos outside. It was as if this space had been waiting for someone to see it, to understand its significance. \u201cIn a world of rainbows, who knew gray could be the pot of gold?\u201d I mused, a touch of dark humor lightening the heaviness of revelation.\n\nThe old woman watched me, her gaze steady, as if she knew the journey I was embarking on. \u201cHave you been blind to the beauty of simplicity?\u201d she asked, her voice gentle yet probing. Her question hung in the air, a challenge and an invitation.\n\nI thought of the world outside, the relentless pursuit of color, the conformity to a law that promised happiness through brightness. Had we lost something in our quest to banish the gray? Had we forgotten the quiet beauty of simplicity, the hidden truths in the absence of distraction?\n\nThe conflict within me grew, a struggle between the societal norm of color distribution and the old woman\u2019s quiet rebellion. I had spent my life enforcing the vibrancy, ensuring that no corner of the city remained dull. Yet here, in this gray corner, I found a peace I had never known, a vibrancy that came not from external colors but from within.\n\n\u201cIs it enough to live without color?\u201d I asked her, my voice barely a whisper.\n\nShe smiled, a gesture that seemed to encompass all the wisdom of the world. \u201cIn the absence of color, I found the spectrum of my soul,\u201d she said, her words a gentle caress, a balm to my conflicted heart.\n\nAs I sat there, the grayness around me began to shift, not in hue but in perception. I saw it as a metaphor for authenticity, a space where I could be myself without the distraction of colors. It was a revelation, a philosophical insight that brought a resolution to my internal struggle. The true essence of color, I realized, lay not in its vividness but in its ability to reveal the hidden shades of life.\n\nThe old woman\u2019s gray corner held no mystical powers, no supernatural secrets. It was simply a space of truth, a reminder that true vibrancy comes from within, not from the colors we wear on the outside. In the gray, I found a freedom I had never known, an acceptance of my own complexity, my own suppressed desires for simplicity.\n\nI left her apartment with a newfound understanding, a peace that settled within me like the dust in her gray corner. The world outside was still a riot of colors, still relentless in its pursuit of vibrancy. But within me, the colors had shifted, rearranged themselves into a spectrum that included the gray.\n\n\u201cHave you ever wondered what lies beneath the colors we paint our lives with?\u201d I would ask others, hoping to share the insight I had gained. \u201cWhat if the absence of color reveals the true hues of our existence?\u201d\n\nIn the gray, I found the colors of my true self. And in that revelation, I discovered a new way of seeing the world, a spectrum that embraced all shades, all hues, even those we had long forgotten. It was a quiet rebellion, a defiance of the vibrant order, but it was a rebellion that brought me peace, a rebellion that showed me the true essence of color in a world that had once forgotten gray.",

The world agreed that colors were needed, to pull everyone out of the despair of the dying, and all those piled-up bones. Colors were brought in. They were just carted in on trucks, and everyone took their fill. It was a job for every person on the planet to put colors where they ought to be. Some things were decided in advance, like making the grass green, and you\u2019d get a ticket if you made yours red or blue. But other things you could decide, like the color of your shirt.

The world sighed in relief: everything was so much more beautiful now! And for several days there were no wars, just people enjoying the colors, but humans adapt quickly to what is beautiful and nice, and then the wars started up again, and the committee was disbanded.\n\nA long time ago I was part of this committee\u2014not the original one, but the commemorative one, made up of the committee\u2019s daughters. We gathered to take notes about what had really happened in those conversations, so that we could tell the world. We asked our fathers, What was it like to be on the committee? How did the meetings go? But they had lost their memories, some of them, and others were angry at the other committee members, and wouldn\u2019t tell us why. We gathered very little information to save for the world, for posterity. Then we disbanded, too. We said to ourselves, Let\u2019s just enjoy the colors. Who cares how they got here? So we did. We became just like everyone else, not archivists of the past, but regular folks walking through the colors of the present, as if we didn\u2019t know anything.\n\nThen, one day, Amanda thought we should actually just talk to the people of the world who had participated in dispersing colors over the land, just regular folk, the ones who did it. The rest of the daughters were tired, but I wanted to do it with her, because I liked her and it sounded fun. I asked if she thought I should bring my movie camera, and she said yes, we could make a documentary. We went to a little town and just stood in the square and accosted people who were going about their Sunday shopping and asked them what it was like when there started to be colors, and had they participated in coloring everything? We only asked the old people. Most people didn\u2019t want to talk to us, but one old woman did. She invited us back to her apartment for tea.\n\nHer apartment was full of colors, just like the rest of the world, except for one corner, which was still gray. It was her own secret corner that hadn\u2019t been colored\u2014perhaps the only place in the world like this! The world would have been agitated to know that a corner had not been filled in; but she said that in fifty years, sixty, seventy, she had not let anyone in. She preferred to give up husbands and friends, so she could keep one corner of the world not colored.\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\nIt was clearly restful to her to have it, as restful as a little gray mouse that\u2019s a friend. Oh, she told us, as she spoke for the camera, avoiding eye contact with it, her fingers playing with her teacup on her little china saucer, it was all anyone could talk about\u2014what color are you going to make this? What color are you going to make that? Isn\u2019t it all so beautiful now? How did we ever live with all that grayness? Why did it take the world so long? Isn\u2019t it nice how we are all co\u00f6perating?\n\nShe was making little sour expressions as she imitated those people from so long ago, many of whom were dead now, she said. She had got into the craze for a little while too, coloring everything in sight, even things that weren\u2019t in her jurisdiction to color, like the neighbor\u2019s fencing.\n\nBut one day she returned to her apartment, where she hadn\u2019t yet filled in the corner. She had been coloring other things, she had just put it off. She thought, I\u2019m tired, I\u2019ll do it tomorrow. She told us this with downcast eyes. And what happened? Well, tomorrow turned into tomorrow, as it does for so many of us. It kept appearing on her to-do list, like one of those items that are there for so many months you don\u2019t even notice them anymore. And the months turned to years, and somehow she never did it. What is it with those things that never make it off the list? Is it that we actually don\u2019t want to do them? Or that we don\u2019t even need to do them? We put them on there because we think we should. Why don\u2019t we just take them off already? So finally she took it off, and by that time the world didn\u2019t even have enough color left that she could use to fill in the corner.\n\nShe stayed in that apartment\u2014various friends encouraged her to move, for the immigrants were moving into her building, and so her friends thought that she ought to move. But, although she wasn\u2019t a fan of the immigrants, she didn\u2019t mind them so much, they were nice neighbors, and that dull corner reassured her in a funny little way. She looked at it every day as she took her tea. No, she didn\u2019t have anybody over, and, yes, her lovely immigrant neighbors thought she was a snob, but really what was she supposed to do if one of them found out, and said something to somebody? She couldn\u2019t take the risk. And so she didn\u2019t take the risk. She finally stood up to let us out, very very sadly. She told us to please not air our documentary, or write about it, until she died. She wanted to live with that little corner like that until she died, and not be taken away or to jail, or for somebody from some committee to come and color it in, so we agreed, because we felt sorry for her, and we liked her.\n\nWell, she finally died last year, and next week our documentary airs, but we are sad about it. Mostly we wish we hadn\u2019t been waiting for this anniversary, the one-year anniversary of her death, with the sort of desire everyone feels to show the world what they\u2019ve made. We\u2019re proud of the short film we created, and that we found this story, but not that she had to die in order for us to put it into the world. Better that she had lived, and lived with her corner, than that we got to show our film. Why is there always so much sadness when something good occurs, a balance between the good and the bad? Couldn\u2019t she have said, Show your film to the world! and felt safe that no one cared any longer about one little corner not being filled in? No, but perhaps she knew something we did not, about colors, and grayness, and corners, and what is allowed to you in your privacy, in your tiny little apartment, and what is not.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The apartment building at 231 West End Avenue had a curious shade of coral on its facade, a color mandated by city ordinance. The hues were supposed to invigorate, to remind the inhabitants of the vibrancy that had been legislated into their lives. But behind the fourth window from the left, on the sixth floor, lived an old woman who kept a secret.\n\nWhen Amelia first visited, drawn by a notice from the Historical Aesthetics Society seeking volunteers to catalog remnants of the pre-color era, she hadn\u2019t expected to find anything more than dusty artifacts. The building's superintendent, a stooped man with nicotine-stained fingers, led her up the narrow staircase. \n\n\"Miss Eliza doesn't like visitors much,\" he warned, tapping a knobby knuckle against the door.\n\nThe door creaked open, revealing a diminutive figure swathed in a housecoat of muted lavender, a concession to the world outside. Her eyes, sharp and wary, settled on Amelia. \"You're here about the history,\" she stated, a hint of irony coloring her voice.\n\nInside, the apartment was a riot of prescribed colors: sunflower yellow cushions, a cerulean rug, and walls painted a shade of green so vivid it seemed to hum. But in the far corner of the living room, beyond the array of mandatory vibrancy, stood a curtain. It was gray, a relic from the days when the world was shrouded in what they called \"the Great Dullness.\"\n\nAmelia moved closer, compelled by the curtain\u2019s quiet defiance. Eliza watched her, a subtle nod giving permission to unveil what lay beyond. Amelia drew the fabric aside, revealing a corner untouched by the chromatic decree. It was a small alcove, the walls bare and unpainted, a simple wooden chair and a table standing as solemn sentinels. On the table, a photograph, black and white, its edges curled with age.\n\n\"Why?\" Amelia whispered, more to herself than to Eliza.\n\nEliza's voice was soft, almost conspiratorial. \"Some things should remain as they were, lest we forget who we were.\"\n\nAmelia turned, the photograph now in her hands. It depicted a younger Eliza with a man and a child, their expressions solemn but content. \"My husband, Daniel, and our son, Martin,\" Eliza explained. \"We lost them to the fever, just before the colors came.\"\n\nThe fever had been the great scourge, the reason for the legislation that followed. It was believed that color would drive away the melancholy that had settled over the populace, a psychological balm to the collective wound. \n\n\"Do you miss them?\" Amelia asked, feeling the inadequacy of her words.\n\nEliza sighed, a sound that seemed to carry the weight of years. \"Every day. But more than missing them, I miss the honesty of that time. The grayness was real. It reflected our grief, our struggles. This,\" she gestured to the room, \"is a mask.\"\n\nAmelia felt a chill, despite the warmth of the room. She had grown up in a world of mandated cheerfulness, where even the sky was sometimes tinted to match the city planners' vision of a perfect day. She had never questioned it, never thought to look beyond the color.\n\n\"What does it mean for you, keeping this gray corner?\" she asked.\n\nEliza's eyes softened, a hint of a smile playing at her lips. \"It means remembering. It means acknowledging that life isn't always bright, that it's okay to sit in the shadow now and then.\"\n\nAmelia nodded, understanding dawning. The world had moved on, painted over its sorrow, but in doing so, it had lost a part of itself. The gray corner was a testament to the resilience of memory, a quiet rebellion against the tyranny of enforced happiness.\n\nThey sat in silence for a while, the muted tones of the alcove wrapping around them like a protective cocoon. Amelia felt a sense of peace she hadn't known she needed, a connection to a past she had never lived but now, somehow, understood.\n\nAs she rose to leave, Eliza pressed the photograph into her hand. \"Keep it,\" she said. \"A reminder.\"\n\nAmelia accepted the gift, feeling its weight, both literal and metaphorical. She left the apartment with a new perspective, the gray corner imprinted on her mind. \n\nIn the weeks that followed, she found herself drawn to places where the colors seemed less forced, where the natural wear and tear revealed glimpses of the world beneath. She began to notice the small acts of defiance scattered throughout the city: a patch of unpainted brick, a door left in its original state, a faded sign that had escaped the brush of regulation. \n\nThese discoveries led her to others like Eliza, keepers of forgotten truths, guardians of the gray. Each had their own story, their own reasons for preserving a piece of the past. Together, they formed a quiet network, a collective memory that resisted the homogeny of the present.\n\nOne evening, Amelia found herself back at Eliza's door. She knocked, and the old woman greeted her with the same wary eyes, though now softened by recognition.\n\n\"I've been thinking,\" Amelia began, \"about what you said, about remembering.\"\n\nEliza nodded, gesturing for her to enter. \"It's important,\" she said simply.\n\n\"I want to help,\" Amelia continued. \"I want to make sure others remember too.\"\n\nEliza's smile was slow to form, but when it did, it was genuine. \"You already are, my dear. You already are.\"\n\nThe two women sat in the gray corner, sharing stories of a world that had tried to forget its pain, and in doing so, had nearly lost its soul. They talked late into the night, the shadows lengthening around them, the colors outside dimming as if in reverence to their quiet rebellion.\n\nThe photograph remained with Amelia, a symbol of her newfound purpose. It reminded her that in a world painted with the brush of enforced vibrancy, there was still a place for the honest hues of life\u2019s more somber moments. The gray corner had taught her that true resilience wasn\u2019t in the bright facade, but in the acceptance of all that had come before. It was a lesson she carried with her, a quiet rebellion of her own against a world that had forgotten how to live without color.",
        "story_b": "In a city where the air itself seemed infused with a kaleidoscope of color, the discovery of the old woman's gray corner felt like stumbling upon a hidden realm. It was an afternoon like any other when I first noticed it\u2014a sliver of monochrome peeking from behind her slightly ajar door as I wandered the halls of the pastel apartment block. Curiosity tugged at me, pulling me closer until I was standing at her threshold, the vibrant world just a step behind me.\n\nThe old woman, Mrs. Calloway, appeared as if summoned by my silent intrigue. Her eyes, a gentle stormy gray, met mine with a knowing glimmer. \u201cCome in, if you\u2019d like,\u201d she offered, her voice a soft whisper against the riotous colors outside.\n\nInside, the grayness enveloped me like a forgotten lullaby. Here, the walls were washed in subtle shadows, the furniture a spectrum of silvers and charcoal. It was a stark contrast to the mandated vibrancy outside, where every surface screamed with color, dictated by the Color Harmony Act\u2014a law enacted to ensure perpetual cheerfulness and unity.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d was all I could manage to ask, glancing around at the subdued beauty of her sanctuary.\n\nMrs. Calloway smiled, a wistful curve of her lips. \u201cTo remember,\u201d she said simply. \u201cTo remember a time when the world was not afraid of silence and shadow.\u201d\n\nAs she moved through the room, her fingers grazed over a faded photograph perched on a side table\u2014a scene of a family in grayscale, their expressions serene, untouched by the artificial brightness of our current age. \u201cThis was my family,\u201d she explained, her voice thick with memory. \u201cWe lived in a world where gray was not the enemy, but the background on which life painted itself.\u201d\n\nI listened, captivated, as she recounted tales of a time when colors were a natural occurrence, not a regulated commodity. She spoke of skies that shifted in temperate hues, of autumn leaves that blazed before fading into winter\u2019s quietude. In her words, I glimpsed a world of balance, where gray was the canvas upon which color found its meaning.\n\n\u201cWhy hide it?\u201d I asked, gesturing to her gray corner.\n\n\u201cBecause they wouldn\u2019t understand,\u201d she replied. \u201cTo them, gray is a reminder of dullness, of the past they wish to forget. But to me, it is a sanctuary. A place where I can be alone with my thoughts.\u201d\n\nThere was something magical about the grayness that I couldn\u2019t quite articulate. It absorbed sound, creating a serene silence that seemed to hush the vibrancy outside. In that stillness, I felt a clarity that had been elusive in the cacophony of color.\n\nMrs. Calloway settled into a worn armchair, inviting me to do the same. \u201cDo you know why they fear the gray?\u201d she asked, her gaze steady on mine. \u201cIt\u2019s because it represents what they\u2019ve lost\u2014the ability to see beauty in simplicity, to find peace in ambiguity.\u201d\n\nHer words resonated deeply within me, challenging the convictions I had never thought to question. In a society where every emotion was color-coded, where red was for passion and blue for tranquility, the gray corner defied all definition. It was neither sad nor joyful; it simply was.\n\nAs the afternoon waned, Mrs. Calloway shared more stories, each one a brushstroke on the canvas of her past. She spoke of personal losses, of a husband who cherished the subtlety of twilight, of children who played in the gentle rain. The grayness, she explained, was not merely a color, but a vessel for memory\u2014a way to hold onto those who had been swallowed by the relentless tide of enforced vibrancy.\n\nWhen I finally left her apartment, the world outside seemed almost blinding in its intensity. But something had shifted within me. The colors that once seemed so essential now felt overwhelming, almost garish. I walked through the streets with a newfound awareness, noticing how the vibrancy masked the underlying monotony of our lives.\n\nOver the following weeks, I visited Mrs. Calloway often. Each time, I learned more about the delicate balance she maintained, about the strength it took to preserve her gray sanctuary in a world that had forgotten how to live without color. She taught me to see the world in gradients, to appreciate the subtle shifts between light and shadow.\n\nIt was during one of these visits that she revealed the ultimate secret of her gray corner. \u201cThis,\u201d she said, gesturing around her, \u201cis not just a rebellion. It is a reminder that life is not meant to be dictated by laws of color. It is a spectrum, full of nuances that we must not forget.\u201d\n\nHer words lingered with me long after I left her side. The grayness had opened my eyes to a truth I had never considered\u2014that in our quest for vibrancy, we had lost the ability to see the beauty in balance. The world outside, with its strict adherence to color, now seemed a facade, a superficial attempt to mask the deeper, more complex realities of life.\n\nThe revelation came to me one evening as I stood on the roof of our building, the city sprawling beneath me in its artificial glory. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the sky transformed into a tapestry of muted tones, a reminder of the natural world that still existed beyond our controlled palette.\n\nIn that moment, I understood what Mrs. Calloway had been trying to teach me. The grayness was not something to be feared, but embraced. It was a reminder of the quiet beauty that lay beneath the surface, of the depth that could be found in simplicity.\n\nI returned to her apartment the next day, eager to share my newfound understanding. But when I knocked on her door, there was no answer. The silence that greeted me felt different, a hollow absence rather than the serene quiet I had come to cherish.\n\nDays passed before I learned the truth. Mrs. Calloway had passed away quietly in her sleep, her gray sanctuary left behind as a testament to her quiet rebellion. Her absence left a void, but her lessons lingered, a whisper of wisdom that continued to shape my perspective.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, I found myself drawn to the idea of balance, of finding a harmony between color and gray. I began to notice the subtle beauty in the world around me\u2014the way shadows danced on the pavement, the way a cloudy sky held its own quiet majesty.\n\nMrs. Calloway\u2019s gray corner had been more than just a rebellion; it was a reminder of the complexity of life, of the importance of seeing beyond the surface. In a world that had forgotten how to live without color, she had taught me to see again.\n\nAnd so, as I stood in my own apartment, surrounded by the vibrancy of the world outside, I carved out a small space of gray\u2014a corner untouched by the dictates of color, a place to remember the lessons of a wise old woman and the beauty of a world that existed beyond the spectrum.\n\nIn the balance of gray and color, I found a new way of seeing\u2014a way that embraced both the vibrancy of life and the quiet grace of simplicity. And in that balance, I discovered a truth that would stay with me forever: that sometimes, it is the gray that lets us truly see.",

It depicted a younger Eliza with a man and a child, their expressions solemn but content. \"My husband, Daniel, and our son, Martin,\" Eliza explained. \"We lost them to the fever, just before the colors came.\"\n\nThe fever had been the great scourge, the reason for the legislation that followed. It was believed that color would drive away the melancholy that had settled over the populace, a psychological balm to the collective wound. \n\n\"Do you miss them?\" Amelia asked, feeling the inadequacy of her words.\n\nEliza sighed, a sound that seemed to carry the weight of years. \"Every day. But more than missing them, I miss the honesty of that time. The grayness was real. It reflected our grief, our struggles. This,\" she gestured to the room, \"is a mask.\"\n\nAmelia felt a chill, despite the warmth of the room. She had grown up in a world of mandated cheerfulness, where even the sky was sometimes tinted to match the city planners' vision of a perfect day. She had never questioned it, never thought to look beyond the color.\n\n\"What does it mean for you, keeping this gray corner?\" she asked.\n\nEliza's eyes softened, a hint of a smile playing at her lips. \"It means remembering. It means acknowledging that life isn't always bright, that it's okay to sit in the shadow now and then.\"\n\nAmelia nodded, understanding dawning. The world had moved on, painted over its sorrow, but in doing so, it had lost a part of itself. The gray corner was a testament to the resilience of memory, a quiet rebellion against the tyranny of enforced happiness.\n\nThey sat in silence for a while, the muted tones of the alcove wrapping around them like a protective cocoon. Amelia felt a sense of peace she hadn't known she needed, a connection to a past she had never lived but now, somehow, understood.\n\nAs she rose to leave, Eliza pressed the photograph into her hand. \"Keep it,\" she said. \"A reminder.\"\n\nAmelia accepted the gift, feeling its weight, both literal and metaphorical. She left the apartment with a new perspective, the gray corner imprinted on her mind. \n\nIn the weeks that followed, she found herself drawn to places where the colors seemed less forced, where the natural wear and tear revealed glimpses of the world beneath. She began to notice the small acts of defiance scattered throughout the city: a patch of unpainted brick, a door left in its original state, a faded sign that had escaped the brush of regulation. \n\nThese discoveries led her to others like Eliza, keepers of forgotten truths, guardians of the gray. Each had their own story, their own reasons for preserving a piece of the past. Together, they formed a quiet network, a collective memory that resisted the homogeny of the present.\n\nOne evening, Amelia found herself back at Eliza's door. She knocked, and the old woman greeted her with the same wary eyes, though now softened by recognition.\n\n\"I've been thinking,\" Amelia began, \"about what you said, about remembering.\"\n\nEliza nodded, gesturing for her to enter. \"It's important,\" she said simply.\n\n\"I want to help,\" Amelia continued. \"I want to make sure others remember too.\"\n\nEliza's smile was slow to form, but when it did, it was genuine. \"You already are, my dear. You already are.\"\n\nThe two women sat in the gray corner, sharing stories of a world that had tried to forget its pain, and in doing so, had nearly lost its soul. They talked late into the night, the shadows lengthening around them, the colors outside dimming as if in reverence to their quiet rebellion.\n\nThe photograph remained with Amelia, a symbol of her newfound purpose. It reminded her that in a world painted with the brush of enforced vibrancy, there was still a place for the honest hues of life\u2019s more somber moments. The gray corner had taught her that true resilience wasn\u2019t in the bright facade, but in the acceptance of all that had come before. It was a lesson she carried with her, a quiet rebellion of her own against a world that had forgotten how to live without color.",
        "story_b": "In a world where the skies were painted in legislated blues and the fields in mandated greens, I found solace in the unexpected. It was the color of nothingness, of neutrality, of shadows that neither demanded attention nor repulsed it. I discovered this anomaly in the most unlikely of places, an old woman's apartment nestled between the kaleidoscopic chaos of the city. She was known as Mrs. Grayer\u2014ironic, perhaps, but fitting. Her name was whispered with a mixture of disdain and curiosity, as if she were a relic from an age best forgotten.\n\nThe first time I stumbled into Mrs. Grayer's world, I was chasing a rumor. \"She's a heretic,\" they said. \"A rebel against vibrancy.\" But what they didn't say was how, in a world drunk on hues, a corner of gray could be a sanctuary of the soul.\n\nAs I entered her apartment, the assault of colors on my senses was immediate and overwhelming. The walls were an erratic dance of reds and yellows, the floor a patchwork of blues and purples. It was as if her home was a prism, reflecting the laws of our society. But then I saw it\u2014the corner. It was unremarkable in its simplicity, a patch of faded walls and a floor that had long since forgotten the touch of paint.\n\n\"In a world painted in hues,\" I pondered aloud, \"what does it mean to find solace in gray?\"\n\nMrs. Grayer appeared from the shadows, her presence as understated as her corner. She smiled, a knowing curve of the lips that seemed to understand the dissonance in my heart. \"To understand gray, you must first understand color,\" she said, her voice a gentle lullaby against the chaos.\n\nI approached the corner, feeling the air thicken with the scent of forgotten rain. There was a tangible silence here, a whisper of stories untold. \"Perhaps the absence of color is the presence of truth,\" I mused, \"a canvas untainted by the laws of vibrancy.\"\n\nMrs. Grayer chuckled softly, her laughter a melody of defiance. \"Why did the world paint itself in colors?\" she asked, her eyes twinkling with mischief. \"To hide the fact that it was afraid of the dark\u2014or maybe just afraid of the gray.\"\n\nI laughed with her, a sound that felt foreign in a world where laughter was often as vibrant as the colors it accompanied. \"In a world where blue is a privilege,\" I quipped, \"I wonder if gray is the ultimate rebellion.\"\n\nThe old woman nodded, her gaze drifting to her corner as if it were an old friend. \"Gray is the color of memory,\" she said, \"of moments that refuse to be buried beneath a coat of paint.\"\n\nAs I sat in that corner, I felt the weight of the world lift. It was as if the colors had been a burden I never knew I carried. I was a spectrum of emotions trapped in a monochrome world, longing for the simplicity of gray.\n\nMrs. Grayer began to share her stories, tales of a time when gray was not an outcast but a companion, when the world did not need color to define itself. Her words painted pictures more vivid than any color could, images of people who lived in the spaces between shades, who found beauty in the subtlety of existence.\n\n\"The laws were meant to banish grayness,\" she explained, \"to erase the melancholy of the past. But in doing so, they forgot that gray is not the absence of color\u2014it's the presence of all colors, blended into harmony.\"\n\nI listened, entranced by her wisdom. In her gray corner, I found clarity. I realized that the vibrant order of our world was a fa\u00e7ade, a distraction from the truths we were too afraid to face.\n\n\"Gray is where life happens,\" Mrs. Grayer continued, her voice a gentle echo in the silence. \"It's where love exists, where hope lingers. It's the space between laughter and tears, where the heart truly resides.\"\n\nHer words resonated deeply within me, awakening a longing I had not known existed. In that moment, I understood why she had kept her corner untouched. It was not just a rebellion against the vibrant order; it was a testament to the power of subtlety, a reminder that life is not always about the bold strokes but the delicate nuances that color the soul.\n\nAs I left her apartment, I carried with me the weight of her wisdom. I realized that the world needed its gray corners, its spaces of introspection and silence. In a society that worshipped color, it was easy to forget the beauty of the in-between, of the shadows that whispered stories of shadows and silence.\n\nMrs. Grayer's gray corner was more than a secret; it was a revelation. It held the truth of a world that had forgotten how to live without color, a world that needed to remember the value of simplicity and the grace of subtlety.\n\nI returned to my own vibrant life, but I carried the gray within me, a talisman of truth in a world of artifice. The gray corner had taught me that in the absence of color, I could find my own palette, one that celebrated the full spectrum of existence.\n\nIn the days that followed, I began to see the world differently. The colors that once blinded me now seemed less imposing, less necessary. I found myself drawn to the quiet moments, the spaces between the noise, where the gray whispered its secrets.\n\nI realized that Mrs. Grayer's rebellion was not against color itself, but against the tyranny of a world that demanded it. Her corner was a sanctuary, a place where the heart could breathe, unfettered by the constraints of conformity.\n\nAs I walked through the city, I noticed the grayness in the shadows, in the spaces where light and darkness met. I saw it in the faces of people who moved through the world without noticing the beauty of what lay beneath the surface.\n\nIn a world obsessed with vibrancy, I found myself longing for the gray. It was a quiet rebellion, a personal revolution against the tyranny of color. I realized that gray was not the enemy, but the truth that lay hidden beneath the surface of our painted lives.\n\nMrs. Grayer's gray corner had changed me, opened my eyes to the beauty of the in-between. It was a revelation, a reminder that the world was not just a canvas of color, but a tapestry of shadows and light, of stories waiting to be told.\n\nIn the end, I understood that gray was not just a color, but a state of being, a way of seeing the world through new eyes. It was a reminder that life was not just about the bold strokes, but the delicate nuances that made it whole.\n\nAnd so, I embraced the gray, carrying it with me as a beacon of truth in a world of color. In the simplicity of gray, I found the complexity of life, a beauty that transcended the vibrant order and whispered the secrets of the soul.",

Now, he must uncover the secrets of a decades-old tragedy to help Maddie reclaim her stolen body.",
        "ground_truth": "As Simon walked away from Maddie, or at least what he had thought was Maddie before he\u2019d come to the conclusion that for the last few weeks he\u2019d been talking to something created by his imagination, he thought that in confronting her, in facing up to it, that would be the end of it. The video Nicole had sent him was clear enough; Maddie was alive, she was heading out of town without even bothering to tell him, her supposed best friend. He\u2019d been creating a version of Maddie in his mind, talking to her, even trying to solve her supposed murder, and Maddie had made the choice to cut him out of her life with no explanation.\nHe went home and called Nicole; they talked for a while about what that video of Maddie in Xavier\u2019s truck might mean, and speculated on why Maddie might have taken off like that but weren\u2019t able to come up with anything that made sense to them both. He called Claire to ask if there was any update on Xavier; Claire said that he wasn\u2019t awake yet and his asshole father had sent her away from the hospital, but she was going to go back the next day and would contact him if she heard any more.\nMaddie didn\u2019t appear to him. Simon didn\u2019t think anything of that; he thought he\u2019d put an end to the matter when he finally told that figment of his imagination goodbye, and he wasn\u2019t going to see her again. (Except maybe in the back of a police van, if anyone did successfully track her down; Simon was annoyed with himself that he still cared.)\nHe headed into school the next day, took his seat in Anderson\u2019s classroom and waited for the sub to arrive, then blinked in surprise at the sight of Maddie sat in her old chair.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not here!\u201d he snapped.\nClaire\u2019s friend Ava gave him a weird look; Nicole walked in and took the seat next to him, asking what he just said.\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s not here,\u201d Simon improvised. \u201cMy notebook. It\u2019s on my bedroom floor.\u201d Nicole seemed to buy that; Simon was determined to keep his focus on the lesson, ignoring Maddie sat at her desk, reaching out to him. When the class ended, he made sure he was first out of the door, ignoring the sound of Maddie\u2019s voice calling out to him, made his way to his next class without waiting for Nicole. Maddie wasn\u2019t there in his next class; Simon flashed back to a conversation they\u2019d had before about how he could only see Maddie in a room where someone had died, and figured that no one must have ever died in this classroom.\nStop being such an idiot,\nSimon told himself.\nThis isn\u2019t real.\nHe got through the rest of the school day, ditching lunch in the cafeteria so he wouldn\u2019t have another sighting of Maddie, headed home, took a call from Claire saying Xavier had woken up, but was still very groggy and it might be better to wait until the next day to stop by.\nMaddie didn\u2019t appear; Simon knew she wouldn\u2019t, because she wasn\u2019t real.\nThe weekend passed; Simon went round to Nicole\u2019s, Sunday they visited Xavier in hospital, where he was less groggy now but said he couldn\u2019t remember much about the accident and hadn\u2019t got a look at the driver of the truck. Simon and Nicole didn\u2019t show him the video; Claire had asked them to leave it for a bit, give Xavier a bit more time to recover before having that conversation with him. Simon was okay with that; he still wasn\u2019t sure if he should show it to anyone. He might have considered the police if he\u2019d had any confidence in how it would be handled; unfortunately, the sheriff was Xavier\u2019s father, who was an ass.\nMaddie didn\u2019t appear at the hospital. Why would she? She wasn\u2019t real.\nSimon headed into school on Monday morning, confident that after a couple of days with no Maddie manifestations, he\u2019d finally closed the door on it\u2026until he got as far as the football field for his first period gym class, only to see Maddie sitting on the bleachers.\nYou\u2019re not here,\nhe told himself as he tried to focus on class, looking anywhere but where Maddie was, trying to ignore her shouts.\n\u201cJanet Hamilton!\u201d Maddie was yelling. \u201cLook it up. Fire in the labs, 1958. That\u2019s who was driving the truck. That\u2019s who\u2019s stolen my body.\u201d\nHe wanted to dismiss it, yet at the same time, he was no longer sure; why would a figment of his imagination conjured up to help deal with his grief be shouting at him about someone he\u2019d never heard of? Wally Clark, sure; Simon could have come up with that name, since there was a stadium in the grounds named after that guy and Simon had seen it at every gym class since freshman year. And he thought he remembered some older kid, a friend of his cousin, telling him the legend of the girl who got murdered by her guidance counsellor; he didn\u2019t remember his cousin\u2019s friend mentioning her name, but it wasn\u2019t impossible he\u2019d said it was Rhonda. But Janet Hamilton, a fire in 1958, that meant nothing to him.\nThere wasn\u2019t going to be anything, Simon thought as he typed into Google. Just some stories about genealogy records, an amateur production of Hamilton starring Janet whoever, stupid shit that wasn\u2019t going to mean anything to him. But when Simon looked at the search results, the first hit that came up was a fire in the science lab at Split River High in 1958, claiming the lives of teacher Everett Martin (another name Maddie had mentioned to him before) and a pupil named Janet Hamilton. If the Maddie Simon had been seeing really was a figment of his imagination, how could she have given Simon this name and story that he\u2019d had no reason to know about, and then have the story turn out to be true?\nThat wasn\u2019t the only thing that had turned out to be true that Simon couldn\u2019t otherwise have known; he\u2019d have had no way of knowing about Anderson\u2019s fraud with the old band uniforms without Maddie, or that the number Anderson had called belonged to Claire (who Simon wasn\u2019t even really friends with at that point and didn\u2019t even have her number). And if she was really a construct of his imagination, why did she never appear when he was at home, or in town, or anywhere other than the high school? So, much as it sounded impossible, Simon had to admit to himself that Maddie must have been real, that she was telling the truth and that was this Janet character on that video driving the truck.\nFirst thing he was going to do when he got to school was find Maddie, and then start brainstorming about how he would track down this Janet. He\u2019d make it up to her; he\u2019d help her get her body back.",
        "story_a": "Simon had always prided himself on his rationality. He was the type of guy who preferred science fairs over ghost stories, facts over fiction. So, when he first saw Maddie standing by the lockers weeks after her supposed disappearance, he dismissed it as his mind playing tricks on him. Grief, he told himself, did strange things to a person. It was easier to believe that than to confront the impossible truth.\n\nBut Maddie was persistent. She showed up during lunch, her favorite time of day, waving at him from across the crowded cafeteria. She appeared in the library, flipping through the pages of books she\u2019d never read in life, and even in the chemistry lab, where they\u2019d spent countless hours together. Each time, she looked more desperate, her silent pleas growing harder to ignore.\n\nSimon finally broke down one evening when he found her sitting on the bleachers in the empty gym, her eyes hollow and pleading. He dropped his gym bag and stared at her, his heart pounding in his chest.\n\n\u201cMaddie,\u201d he whispered, his voice cracking. \u201cAre you really here?\u201d\n\nShe nodded, tears brimming in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve been here all along, Simon. Please, you have to believe me.\u201d\n\nHe took a tentative step closer, his mind reeling. \u201cBut how? How is this possible?\u201d\n\nMaddie\u2019s ghostly form shimmered as she took a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know. All I remember is waking up in this...in-between place. And I\u2019m not alone, Simon. There are others.\u201d\n\nSimon\u2019s stomach churned as he sat down beside her, the cold chill of her presence seeping into his bones. \u201cOthers? Like who?\u201d\n\nShe glanced around the empty gym, her expression wary. \u201cThey\u2019re trapped here too, just like me. But they\u2019re not as...friendly. I think they\u2019ve been here a long time. There\u2019s something keeping us here, something tied to the school.\u201d\n\nSimon felt a shiver run down his spine. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nMaddie\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cThere was a tragedy here, decades ago. A fire. Many students died, and their spirits are still trapped. They\u2019re angry, Simon. And they\u2019ve been trying to keep me from finding out the truth about what happened to me.\u201d\n\nSimon\u2019s mind raced. He had heard whispers about the fire, but it was an old story, buried in the annals of the school\u2019s history. \u201cSo, what do we do? How do we find out what really happened?\u201d\n\nMaddie\u2019s expression softened, a hint of the old determination shining through. \u201cWe need to uncover the secrets of that night. Find out who\u2019s responsible for keeping us here. And maybe, just maybe, we can find a way to reclaim my body.\u201d\n\nSimon nodded, a sense of purpose settling over him. He would help Maddie, no matter what it took. They owed each other that much. \n\nThe next day, Simon found himself in the school\u2019s dusty archives, surrounded by yearbooks and yellowed newspaper clippings. Maddie hovered beside him, her ethereal form casting a faint glow over the dimly lit room.\n\n\u201cLook for anything about the fire,\u201d she urged, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nHours passed as Simon combed through the records, piecing together fragments of the past. He discovered that the fire had started in the old science wing, a result of a mysterious explosion. The official reports had chalked it up to a tragic accident, but there were rumors of foul play, whispers of a cover-up.\n\n\u201cMaddie, look at this,\u201d Simon said, holding up a faded photograph of the science wing before the fire. \u201cDo you recognize anyone?\u201d\n\nMaddie leaned closer, her eyes scanning the faces of the students. \u201cThat\u2019s...that\u2019s Mr. Thompson. He was our chemistry teacher.\u201d\n\nSimon\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cHe\u2019s still here, isn\u2019t he? Maybe he knows something.\u201d\n\nDetermined to get answers, Simon sought out Mr. Thompson after school. The old teacher was in his classroom, grading papers with a weary expression. Simon hesitated at the door, his heart pounding.\n\n\u201cMr. Thompson, can I talk to you for a minute?\u201d Simon asked, stepping inside.\n\nMr. Thompson looked up, his eyes narrowing. \u201cSimon, isn\u2019t it? What can I do for you?\u201d\n\nSimon took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking into the fire that happened here decades ago. I think there\u2019s more to the story than what we\u2019ve been told.\u201d\n\nMr. Thompson\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cThat was a long time ago, Simon. Some things are better left in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not just the past,\u201d Simon insisted. \u201cMy friend Maddie\u2014she\u2019s...she\u2019s trapped here. Just like those students who died in the fire. Please, if you know anything, you have to tell me.\u201d\n\nMr. Thompson\u2019s shoulders slumped, and he motioned for Simon to sit. \u201cI was a young teacher back then, eager to prove myself. The explosion...it wasn\u2019t an accident. There were experiments being conducted, dangerous ones. The administration wanted to cover it up, to protect the school\u2019s reputation.\u201d\n\nSimon\u2019s heart raced. \u201cSo, the spirits are trapped because of what happened that night?\u201d\n\nMr. Thompson nodded, his eyes filled with regret. \u201cThey\u2019re bound to this place by the anger and injustice of it all. I\u2019ve tried to move on, but the guilt...it never goes away.\u201d\n\nSimon swallowed hard. \u201cIs there any way to free them? To help Maddie?\u201d\n\nMr. Thompson sighed. \u201cThe truth needs to be exposed. The people responsible need to be held accountable. Only then can the spirits find peace.\u201d\n\nWith a newfound determination, Simon enlisted the help of his friends, rallying them to uncover the full story. They pored over the archives, interviewed former staff members, and even confronted the school board with their findings.\n\nSlowly, the truth emerged. The dangerous experiments, the cover-up, the lives lost\u2014all came to light. The school was forced to acknowledge its dark past, and measures were taken to ensure such a tragedy would never happen again.\n\nOne evening, as Simon stood in the gym where he had first spoken to Maddie\u2019s ghost, he felt a familiar chill. Maddie appeared beside him, her form shimmering with a newfound brightness.\n\n\u201cSimon,\u201d she said, her voice filled with gratitude. \u201cYou did it. You helped us find the truth.\u201d\n\nHe smiled, tears in his eyes. \u201cDoes this mean you\u2019re free?\u201d\n\nMaddie nodded, a peaceful expression on her face. \u201cYes. We can all move on now. Thank you, Simon. For everything.\u201d\n\nAs she began to fade, Simon reached out, his hand passing through hers. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget you, Maddie.\u201d\n\nWith a final smile, Maddie\u2019s spirit dissipated, leaving Simon standing alone in the empty gym. He felt a sense of closure, knowing he had done everything he could to help his friend. The school, now free from its haunted past, felt like a different place\u2014a place where new memories could be made, and old wounds could finally heal.\n\nSimon walked out of the gym, the weight of the past lifted from his shoulders. He knew that Maddie and the others were at peace, and that was enough for him. As he stepped into the sunlight, he felt a renewed sense of hope, ready to face whatever the future held.",
        "story_b": "In the dimly lit corridors of Split River High, Simon\u2019s footsteps echoed with an eerie cadence, each step resounding like a ghostly reminder of the secrets buried within these walls. The halls seemed to stretch endlessly, twisting and turning as if to conceal the truth he so desperately sought. The air was thick with anticipation, each breath he took clouded by the cold chill of an unseen presence.\n\nWeeks had passed since Simon first glimpsed Maddie\u2019s ghost, her ethereal form flickering at the edge of his vision. He had dismissed it as a trick of the light, a figment of his grief-stricken imagination. But now, as he stood in the silent heart of the school, he knew he could no longer deny the truth. Maddie was real, and she was not alone.\n\n\u201cSimon,\u201d her voice echoed softly, a whisper carried on the breeze that rustled through the empty halls. He turned, finding her spectral form hovering near the lockers, her eyes filled with a mix of fear and urgency.\n\n\u201cMaddie,\u201d he breathed, taking a hesitant step towards her. \u201cI thought\u2026I thought I was losing my mind.\u201d\n\nShe offered a sad smile, the kind that was both familiar and foreign, as though it belonged to another lifetime. \u201cWe all did, at first.\u201d\n\nThe weight of her words pressed down on him, a reminder of the tragedy that had bound them together. Maddie\u2019s disappearance had shaken the school, her absence a ghostly shadow that lingered in every corner. But here she was, standing before him, as real as the day she vanished.\n\n\u201cWe need to find out what happened,\u201d Simon said, determination threading through his voice. \u201cNot just for you, but for all of them.\u201d\n\nHer gaze drifted past him, to the shadows that seemed to pulse with a life of their own. \u201cThere are others, Simon. They\u2019re trapped here, just like me. And it all started with the fire.\u201d\n\nThe fire. It was a story whispered in hushed tones, a tragedy that had claimed lives decades ago. The details had been lost to time, buried beneath layers of rumor and speculation. But Simon knew, deep down, that the truth was still here, waiting to be uncovered.\n\nTogether, they moved through the school, retracing the steps of the past. The ghosts of Split River High lingered in the periphery, their presence a constant reminder of the unfinished stories that haunted these halls. Simon could feel their eyes on him, their silent pleas urging him forward.\n\nAs they reached the old wing, where the fire had left its mark, the air grew colder, the silence more oppressive. Simon shivered, his breath visible in the frosty air. \u201cThis is it,\u201d Maddie said, her voice barely above a whisper. \u201cThis is where it all began.\u201d\n\nThe room was a charred husk of its former self, the walls blackened and crumbling. Simon stepped inside, the floor creaking ominously beneath his weight. He could almost hear the echoes of the past, the crackling flames and desperate cries for help.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something here,\u201d Maddie said, her form flickering as she moved closer to the center of the room. \u201cSomething they don\u2019t want us to find.\u201d\n\nSimon followed her gaze, his eyes landing on a trapdoor hidden beneath the debris. He knelt down, brushing away the soot and ash to reveal its rusted hinges. \u201cHelp me,\u201d he said, glancing at Maddie. She nodded, her spectral hands joining his as they pulled the door open with a groan of protest.\n\nBelow, a narrow staircase descended into darkness, the air thick with the scent of decay. Simon hesitated, the shadows seeming to reach for him with claw-like fingers. But Maddie\u2019s presence beside him gave him strength, her unwavering resolve a beacon in the darkness.\n\nAs they descended, the temperature plummeted, the cold seeping into Simon\u2019s bones. The walls were lined with old photographs, their edges singed by the fire. Faces stared back at him, their expressions frozen in time, each one a reminder of the lives lost.\n\nAt the bottom of the stairs, they found themselves in a small chamber, its walls lined with dusty shelves. In the center stood an old wooden table, and atop it lay a collection of artifacts, each one linked to the tragedy that had unfolded here.\n\nSimon\u2019s eyes fell on a photograph, its edges charred but the image still visible. It was of a girl, her face familiar and hauntingly beautiful. \u201cThat\u2019s her,\u201d Maddie said, her voice trembling with recognition. \u201cThe first one.\u201d\n\nThe girl in the photograph was the catalyst, the first victim of the fire that had claimed so many lives. Her spirit was the one that had drawn Maddie to this place, the one that held the key to unlocking the truth.\n\nAs Simon reached for the photograph, a cold gust of wind swept through the chamber, extinguishing the light and plunging them into darkness. He felt Maddie\u2019s hand grip his, her touch a lifeline in the encroaching shadows.\n\n\u201cSimon, you have to trust me,\u201d she said, her voice steady despite the fear that lingered in the air. \u201cWe\u2019re close. But you need to let go of the past. It\u2019s the only way to free us.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, understanding the weight of her words. The ghosts of Split River High were bound by the tragedy that had claimed them, their spirits trapped in a cycle of grief and regret. To free them, Simon had to confront his own fears, his own guilt for not being able to save Maddie.\n\nWith a deep breath, he closed his eyes, letting the memories of the past wash over him. He saw Maddie\u2019s laughter, her smile, the way she had lit up a room with her presence. He felt the warmth of their friendship, the bond that had been forged through shared secrets and stolen moments.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes, the chamber was bathed in a soft, ethereal glow. The spirits surrounded him, their faces serene and at peace. Maddie stood beside him, her form more solid, more real than before.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, her voice filled with gratitude and love. \u201cYou\u2019ve given us a chance to move on.\u201d\n\nSimon felt a weight lift from his shoulders, the burden of the past finally easing. He knew the journey wasn\u2019t over, that the truth of what happened that fateful day would continue to haunt him. But he also knew that he wasn\u2019t alone, that Maddie\u2019s spirit would always be with him, guiding him through the darkness.\n\nAs they ascended the stairs, leaving the chamber and its secrets behind, Simon felt a sense of peace settle within him. The school was still haunted, its halls filled with the echoes of those who had come before. But now, as he walked beside Maddie\u2019s ghost, he understood that the past was not something to fear, but something to learn from, to grow from.\n\nAnd as the first light of dawn crept through the windows, Simon knew that, together, they would face whatever lay ahead.",

Simon didn\u2019t think anything of that; he thought he\u2019d put an end to the matter when he finally told that figment of his imagination goodbye, and he wasn\u2019t going to see her again. (Except maybe in the back of a police van, if anyone did successfully track her down; Simon was annoyed with himself that he still cared.)\nHe headed into school the next day, took his seat in Anderson\u2019s classroom and waited for the sub to arrive, then blinked in surprise at the sight of Maddie sat in her old chair.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not here!\u201d he snapped.\nClaire\u2019s friend Ava gave him a weird look; Nicole walked in and took the seat next to him, asking what he just said.\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s not here,\u201d Simon improvised. \u201cMy notebook. It\u2019s on my bedroom floor.\u201d Nicole seemed to buy that; Simon was determined to keep his focus on the lesson, ignoring Maddie sat at her desk, reaching out to him. When the class ended, he made sure he was first out of the door, ignoring the sound of Maddie\u2019s voice calling out to him, made his way to his next class without waiting for Nicole. Maddie wasn\u2019t there in his next class; Simon flashed back to a conversation they\u2019d had before about how he could only see Maddie in a room where someone had died, and figured that no one must have ever died in this classroom.\nStop being such an idiot,\nSimon told himself.\nThis isn\u2019t real.\nHe got through the rest of the school day, ditching lunch in the cafeteria so he wouldn\u2019t have another sighting of Maddie, headed home, took a call from Claire saying Xavier had woken up, but was still very groggy and it might be better to wait until the next day to stop by.\nMaddie didn\u2019t appear; Simon knew she wouldn\u2019t, because she wasn\u2019t real.\nThe weekend passed; Simon went round to Nicole\u2019s, Sunday they visited Xavier in hospital, where he was less groggy now but said he couldn\u2019t remember much about the accident and hadn\u2019t got a look at the driver of the truck. Simon and Nicole didn\u2019t show him the video; Claire had asked them to leave it for a bit, give Xavier a bit more time to recover before having that conversation with him. Simon was okay with that; he still wasn\u2019t sure if he should show it to anyone. He might have considered the police if he\u2019d had any confidence in how it would be handled; unfortunately, the sheriff was Xavier\u2019s father, who was an ass.\nMaddie didn\u2019t appear at the hospital. Why would she? She wasn\u2019t real.\nSimon headed into school on Monday morning, confident that after a couple of days with no Maddie manifestations, he\u2019d finally closed the door on it\u2026until he got as far as the football field for his first period gym class, only to see Maddie sitting on the bleachers.\nYou\u2019re not here,\nhe told himself as he tried to focus on class, looking anywhere but where Maddie was, trying to ignore her shouts.\n\u201cJanet Hamilton!\u201d Maddie was yelling. \u201cLook it up. Fire in the labs, 1958. That\u2019s who was driving the truck. That\u2019s who\u2019s stolen my body.\u201d\nHe wanted to dismiss it, yet at the same time, he was no longer sure; why would a figment of his imagination conjured up to help deal with his grief be shouting at him about someone he\u2019d never heard of? Wally Clark, sure; Simon could have come up with that name, since there was a stadium in the grounds named after that guy and Simon had seen it at every gym class since freshman year. And he thought he remembered some older kid, a friend of his cousin, telling him the legend of the girl who got murdered by her guidance counsellor; he didn\u2019t remember his cousin\u2019s friend mentioning her name, but it wasn\u2019t impossible he\u2019d said it was Rhonda. But Janet Hamilton, a fire in 1958, that meant nothing to him.\nThere wasn\u2019t going to be anything, Simon thought as he typed into Google. Just some stories about genealogy records, an amateur production of Hamilton starring Janet whoever, stupid shit that wasn\u2019t going to mean anything to him. But when Simon looked at the search results, the first hit that came up was a fire in the science lab at Split River High in 1958, claiming the lives of teacher Everett Martin (another name Maddie had mentioned to him before) and a pupil named Janet Hamilton. If the Maddie Simon had been seeing really was a figment of his imagination, how could she have given Simon this name and story that he\u2019d had no reason to know about, and then have the story turn out to be true?\nThat wasn\u2019t the only thing that had turned out to be true that Simon couldn\u2019t otherwise have known; he\u2019d have had no way of knowing about Anderson\u2019s fraud with the old band uniforms without Maddie, or that the number Anderson had called belonged to Claire (who Simon wasn\u2019t even really friends with at that point and didn\u2019t even have her number). And if she was really a construct of his imagination, why did she never appear when he was at home, or in town, or anywhere other than the high school? So, much as it sounded impossible, Simon had to admit to himself that Maddie must have been real, that she was telling the truth and that was this Janet character on that video driving the truck.\nFirst thing he was going to do when he got to school was find Maddie, and then start brainstorming about how he would track down this Janet. He\u2019d make it up to her; he\u2019d help her get her body back.",
        "story_a": "Simon had always prided himself on his rationality. He was the type of guy who preferred science fairs over ghost stories, facts over fiction. So, when he first saw Maddie standing by the lockers weeks after her supposed disappearance, he dismissed it as his mind playing tricks on him. Grief, he told himself, did strange things to a person. It was easier to believe that than to confront the impossible truth.\n\nBut Maddie was persistent. She showed up during lunch, her favorite time of day, waving at him from across the crowded cafeteria. She appeared in the library, flipping through the pages of books she\u2019d never read in life, and even in the chemistry lab, where they\u2019d spent countless hours together. Each time, she looked more desperate, her silent pleas growing harder to ignore.\n\nSimon finally broke down one evening when he found her sitting on the bleachers in the empty gym, her eyes hollow and pleading. He dropped his gym bag and stared at her, his heart pounding in his chest.\n\n\u201cMaddie,\u201d he whispered, his voice cracking. \u201cAre you really here?\u201d\n\nShe nodded, tears brimming in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve been here all along, Simon. Please, you have to believe me.\u201d\n\nHe took a tentative step closer, his mind reeling. \u201cBut how? How is this possible?\u201d\n\nMaddie\u2019s ghostly form shimmered as she took a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know. All I remember is waking up in this...in-between place. And I\u2019m not alone, Simon. There are others.\u201d\n\nSimon\u2019s stomach churned as he sat down beside her, the cold chill of her presence seeping into his bones. \u201cOthers? Like who?\u201d\n\nShe glanced around the empty gym, her expression wary. \u201cThey\u2019re trapped here too, just like me. But they\u2019re not as...friendly. I think they\u2019ve been here a long time. There\u2019s something keeping us here, something tied to the school.\u201d\n\nSimon felt a shiver run down his spine. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nMaddie\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cThere was a tragedy here, decades ago. A fire. Many students died, and their spirits are still trapped. They\u2019re angry, Simon. And they\u2019ve been trying to keep me from finding out the truth about what happened to me.\u201d\n\nSimon\u2019s mind raced. He had heard whispers about the fire, but it was an old story, buried in the annals of the school\u2019s history. \u201cSo, what do we do? How do we find out what really happened?\u201d\n\nMaddie\u2019s expression softened, a hint of the old determination shining through. \u201cWe need to uncover the secrets of that night. Find out who\u2019s responsible for keeping us here. And maybe, just maybe, we can find a way to reclaim my body.\u201d\n\nSimon nodded, a sense of purpose settling over him. He would help Maddie, no matter what it took. They owed each other that much. \n\nThe next day, Simon found himself in the school\u2019s dusty archives, surrounded by yearbooks and yellowed newspaper clippings. Maddie hovered beside him, her ethereal form casting a faint glow over the dimly lit room.\n\n\u201cLook for anything about the fire,\u201d she urged, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nHours passed as Simon combed through the records, piecing together fragments of the past. He discovered that the fire had started in the old science wing, a result of a mysterious explosion. The official reports had chalked it up to a tragic accident, but there were rumors of foul play, whispers of a cover-up.\n\n\u201cMaddie, look at this,\u201d Simon said, holding up a faded photograph of the science wing before the fire. \u201cDo you recognize anyone?\u201d\n\nMaddie leaned closer, her eyes scanning the faces of the students. \u201cThat\u2019s...that\u2019s Mr. Thompson. He was our chemistry teacher.\u201d\n\nSimon\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cHe\u2019s still here, isn\u2019t he? Maybe he knows something.\u201d\n\nDetermined to get answers, Simon sought out Mr. Thompson after school. The old teacher was in his classroom, grading papers with a weary expression. Simon hesitated at the door, his heart pounding.\n\n\u201cMr. Thompson, can I talk to you for a minute?\u201d Simon asked, stepping inside.\n\nMr. Thompson looked up, his eyes narrowing. \u201cSimon, isn\u2019t it? What can I do for you?\u201d\n\nSimon took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking into the fire that happened here decades ago. I think there\u2019s more to the story than what we\u2019ve been told.\u201d\n\nMr. Thompson\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cThat was a long time ago, Simon. Some things are better left in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not just the past,\u201d Simon insisted. \u201cMy friend Maddie\u2014she\u2019s...she\u2019s trapped here. Just like those students who died in the fire. Please, if you know anything, you have to tell me.\u201d\n\nMr. Thompson\u2019s shoulders slumped, and he motioned for Simon to sit. \u201cI was a young teacher back then, eager to prove myself. The explosion...it wasn\u2019t an accident. There were experiments being conducted, dangerous ones. The administration wanted to cover it up, to protect the school\u2019s reputation.\u201d\n\nSimon\u2019s heart raced. \u201cSo, the spirits are trapped because of what happened that night?\u201d\n\nMr. Thompson nodded, his eyes filled with regret. \u201cThey\u2019re bound to this place by the anger and injustice of it all. I\u2019ve tried to move on, but the guilt...it never goes away.\u201d\n\nSimon swallowed hard. \u201cIs there any way to free them? To help Maddie?\u201d\n\nMr. Thompson sighed. \u201cThe truth needs to be exposed. The people responsible need to be held accountable. Only then can the spirits find peace.\u201d\n\nWith a newfound determination, Simon enlisted the help of his friends, rallying them to uncover the full story. They pored over the archives, interviewed former staff members, and even confronted the school board with their findings.\n\nSlowly, the truth emerged. The dangerous experiments, the cover-up, the lives lost\u2014all came to light. The school was forced to acknowledge its dark past, and measures were taken to ensure such a tragedy would never happen again.\n\nOne evening, as Simon stood in the gym where he had first spoken to Maddie\u2019s ghost, he felt a familiar chill. Maddie appeared beside him, her form shimmering with a newfound brightness.\n\n\u201cSimon,\u201d she said, her voice filled with gratitude. \u201cYou did it. You helped us find the truth.\u201d\n\nHe smiled, tears in his eyes. \u201cDoes this mean you\u2019re free?\u201d\n\nMaddie nodded, a peaceful expression on her face. \u201cYes. We can all move on now. Thank you, Simon. For everything.\u201d\n\nAs she began to fade, Simon reached out, his hand passing through hers. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget you, Maddie.\u201d\n\nWith a final smile, Maddie\u2019s spirit dissipated, leaving Simon standing alone in the empty gym. He felt a sense of closure, knowing he had done everything he could to help his friend. The school, now free from its haunted past, felt like a different place\u2014a place where new memories could be made, and old wounds could finally heal.\n\nSimon walked out of the gym, the weight of the past lifted from his shoulders. He knew that Maddie and the others were at peace, and that was enough for him. As he stepped into the sunlight, he felt a renewed sense of hope, ready to face whatever the future held.",
        "story_b": "Simon leaned against the cool brick of Split River High, the setting sun casting long shadows across the courtyard. He rubbed his temples, trying to process the impossible: Maddie was a ghost. The thought should have been absurd, a story ripped from the pages of a supernatural thriller, but her laughter still echoed in his mind\u2014a haunting melody that both comforted and chilled him. \n\nIt had started with fleeting glimpses, Maddie's face appearing in mirrors or windows, her voice a whisper on the wind. Simon had dismissed them, attributing it to grief and stress. But then, there were the dreams\u2014vivid, unsettling. He saw the school as it once was, bustling with students from decades past, and always, always, Maddie was there, her presence as real as his own heartbeat.\n\nHe finally acknowledged her presence one night, hesitating outside the school doors. The corridors seemed to pulse with an energy he couldn\u2019t quite explain, shadows dancing just beyond his vision. Simon took a deep breath, the memory of Maddie's teasing tone in his ears. \"Scared of ghosts, Simon? Thought you were tougher than that.\"\n\nHe chuckled despite himself and pushed the door open. The hallways were deserted, the fluorescent lights flickering in a way that made the hair on his neck stand up. He had expected the usual eerie silence, but tonight was different. There was a tangible weight to the air, a sense of anticipation.\n\n\"Simon,\" Maddie's voice came, clear and familiar, yet carrying an ethereal quality that made his skin tingle. He turned, and there she was, standing by the lockers, her expression a mix of relief and urgency.\n\n\"You\u2019re... you\u2019re really here,\" Simon stammered, his mind struggling to reconcile the reality before him with his skepticism. Maddie smiled softly, her eyes filled with a warmth that grounded him.\n\n\"I\u2019ve always been here, Si. But we don\u2019t have much time. There are others\u2014ghosts like me. We need to uncover the truth about what happened all those years ago.\"\n\n\"Others?\" Simon asked, trying to wrap his head around the idea of more spirits wandering the halls of Split River. The thought was both terrifying and exhilarating. \"Why didn\u2019t you tell me sooner?\"\n\n\"I tried,\" Maddie replied, frustration tinging her voice. \"You were too busy convincing yourself I was just your imagination.\"\n\nSimon winced, guilt twisting in his stomach. \"I\u2019m sorry, Mads. I didn\u2019t want to believe... but now I do. What do we need to do?\"\n\nMaddie explained the tragedy from decades ago\u2014a fire that had claimed lives, its cause shrouded in mystery. The spirits trapped here were victims, unable to move on until the truth was revealed. And Maddie, caught in the supernatural crossfire, couldn\u2019t reclaim her body until the mystery was solved.\n\nAs they talked, Simon\u2019s phone buzzed. It was a message from Ben, his classmate who loved nothing more than to ridicule Simon\u2019s ghost obsession. \"Ghostbusters meeting tonight?\" Ben had sent, followed by a string of laughing emojis.\n\nSimon sighed, typing back, \"You wouldn\u2019t believe it even if you saw it.\"\n\nBen\u2019s reply was immediate. \"Try me.\"\n\nSimon pocketed his phone, turning back to Maddie. \"We might have a skeptic joining our ghost-busting club.\"\n\nMaddie laughed, a sound that filled the empty hall with a warmth Simon hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d missed. \"Better than nothing,\" she said.\n\nThe next day, Simon cornered Ben in the cafeteria. \"I need your help,\" he said, lowering his voice as he glanced around to make sure no one else could hear. \"I know you think it\u2019s all a joke, but there\u2019s something seriously weird going on at school.\"\n\nBen raised an eyebrow, skepticism written all over his face. \"Seriously? You\u2019re still on about ghosts?\"\n\n\"Just come with me tonight. If I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019ll owe you a month\u2019s worth of cafeteria pizza. If I\u2019m right...\" Simon let the sentence hang, hoping curiosity would do the rest.\n\nBen hesitated, then shrugged. \"Fine. But if this is some prank, you\u2019re going to regret it.\"\n\nThat night, they met at the school gates. Simon led Ben through the darkened halls, Maddie appearing beside them with a nod of acknowledgment. Ben\u2019s eyes widened, disbelief warring with the evidence before him.\n\n\"Okay, that\u2019s... not something you see every day,\" Ben admitted, his bravado cracking slightly.\n\nSimon grinned, feeling a strange camaraderie forming. \"Told you.\"\n\nAs they explored, Maddie guided them to a forgotten corner of the school where old files and photographs were stored. Simon sifted through the dust-covered documents, his heart pounding with each discovery. They found records of the fire, newspaper clippings detailing the tragedy, and a list of students and teachers who had perished.\n\n\"Here,\" Maddie pointed to a faded photograph of a young woman who bore an uncanny resemblance to her. \"She was one of the first victims. Her spirit is the strongest. I\u2019ve felt her trying to reach out.\"\n\nSimon studied the photograph, a chill running down his spine. The woman\u2019s eyes seemed to hold a plea, a silent cry for justice. \"We need to find out who she was,\" he said, determination settling in his chest.\n\nBen, now fully invested, nodded. \"My dad\u2019s a history buff. He might know something about this.\"\n\nAs the days passed, Simon, Maddie, and Ben delved deeper into the past, piecing together the puzzle of the fire. They uncovered a cover-up, orchestrated by a powerful figure who had since left the town. With each revelation, the spirits grew more restless, their presence a constant reminder of the stakes.\n\nDespite the tension, there were moments of levity. Simon\u2019s younger sibling, Lucy, caught wind of their ghost-hunting adventures and insisted on joining. \"I\u2019m not scared of ghosts,\" she declared, brandishing a toy flashlight like a sword.\n\n\"Fine,\" Simon laughed, ruffling her hair. \"But you have to promise not to tell Mom.\"\n\nLucy grinned mischievously. \"Cross my heart.\"\n\nWith Lucy in tow, the group ventured into the school one last time, determined to set things right. Guided by Maddie and the clues they had uncovered, they confronted the truth of that fateful night.\n\nIn the end, it was Simon\u2019s belief in Maddie, and his newfound trust in his friends, that led them to the heart of the mystery. As they exposed the truth, the spirits found peace, their presence fading into the night.\n\nMaddie lingered, her form becoming more insubstantial with each passing moment. \"Thank you, Simon,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nSimon felt a lump in his throat, a bittersweet mix of joy and sorrow. \"I\u2019ll miss you, Mads.\"\n\n\"You\u2019ll be okay,\" she assured him, her smile a beacon of warmth. \"And remember, I\u2019ll always be watching over you.\"\n\nAs Maddie\u2019s spirit faded into the ether, Simon felt a sense of closure settle over him. He had helped his friend find peace, and in doing so, had come to terms with his own fears and doubts.\n\nThe school, once a place of shadows and secrets, now felt lighter, its halls echoing with the laughter of students new and old. Simon knew he\u2019d never forget Maddie or the journey they\u2019d taken together. In uncovering the past, he had found a future filled with hope and new friendships, a testament to the power of belief and the bonds that transcend even death.",

Maddie wasn\u2019t there in his next class; Simon flashed back to a conversation they\u2019d had before about how he could only see Maddie in a room where someone had died, and figured that no one must have ever died in this classroom.\nStop being such an idiot,\nSimon told himself.\nThis isn\u2019t real.\nHe got through the rest of the school day, ditching lunch in the cafeteria so he wouldn\u2019t have another sighting of Maddie, headed home, took a call from Claire saying Xavier had woken up, but was still very groggy and it might be better to wait until the next day to stop by.\nMaddie didn\u2019t appear; Simon knew she wouldn\u2019t, because she wasn\u2019t real.\nThe weekend passed; Simon went round to Nicole\u2019s, Sunday they visited Xavier in hospital, where he was less groggy now but said he couldn\u2019t remember much about the accident and hadn\u2019t got a look at the driver of the truck. Simon and Nicole didn\u2019t show him the video; Claire had asked them to leave it for a bit, give Xavier a bit more time to recover before having that conversation with him. Simon was okay with that; he still wasn\u2019t sure if he should show it to anyone. He might have considered the police if he\u2019d had any confidence in how it would be handled; unfortunately, the sheriff was Xavier\u2019s father, who was an ass.\nMaddie didn\u2019t appear at the hospital. Why would she? She wasn\u2019t real.\nSimon headed into school on Monday morning, confident that after a couple of days with no Maddie manifestations, he\u2019d finally closed the door on it\u2026until he got as far as the football field for his first period gym class, only to see Maddie sitting on the bleachers.\nYou\u2019re not here,\nhe told himself as he tried to focus on class, looking anywhere but where Maddie was, trying to ignore her shouts.\n\u201cJanet Hamilton!\u201d Maddie was yelling. \u201cLook it up. Fire in the labs, 1958. That\u2019s who was driving the truck. That\u2019s who\u2019s stolen my body.\u201d\nHe wanted to dismiss it, yet at the same time, he was no longer sure; why would a figment of his imagination conjured up to help deal with his grief be shouting at him about someone he\u2019d never heard of? Wally Clark, sure; Simon could have come up with that name, since there was a stadium in the grounds named after that guy and Simon had seen it at every gym class since freshman year. And he thought he remembered some older kid, a friend of his cousin, telling him the legend of the girl who got murdered by her guidance counsellor; he didn\u2019t remember his cousin\u2019s friend mentioning her name, but it wasn\u2019t impossible he\u2019d said it was Rhonda. But Janet Hamilton, a fire in 1958, that meant nothing to him.\nThere wasn\u2019t going to be anything, Simon thought as he typed into Google. Just some stories about genealogy records, an amateur production of Hamilton starring Janet whoever, stupid shit that wasn\u2019t going to mean anything to him. But when Simon looked at the search results, the first hit that came up was a fire in the science lab at Split River High in 1958, claiming the lives of teacher Everett Martin (another name Maddie had mentioned to him before) and a pupil named Janet Hamilton. If the Maddie Simon had been seeing really was a figment of his imagination, how could she have given Simon this name and story that he\u2019d had no reason to know about, and then have the story turn out to be true?\nThat wasn\u2019t the only thing that had turned out to be true that Simon couldn\u2019t otherwise have known; he\u2019d have had no way of knowing about Anderson\u2019s fraud with the old band uniforms without Maddie, or that the number Anderson had called belonged to Claire (who Simon wasn\u2019t even really friends with at that point and didn\u2019t even have her number). And if she was really a construct of his imagination, why did she never appear when he was at home, or in town, or anywhere other than the high school? So, much as it sounded impossible, Simon had to admit to himself that Maddie must have been real, that she was telling the truth and that was this Janet character on that video driving the truck.\nFirst thing he was going to do when he got to school was find Maddie, and then start brainstorming about how he would track down this Janet. He\u2019d make it up to her; he\u2019d help her get her body back.",
        "story_a": "Simon had always prided himself on his rationality. He was the type of guy who preferred science fairs over ghost stories, facts over fiction. So, when he first saw Maddie standing by the lockers weeks after her supposed disappearance, he dismissed it as his mind playing tricks on him. Grief, he told himself, did strange things to a person. It was easier to believe that than to confront the impossible truth.\n\nBut Maddie was persistent. She showed up during lunch, her favorite time of day, waving at him from across the crowded cafeteria. She appeared in the library, flipping through the pages of books she\u2019d never read in life, and even in the chemistry lab, where they\u2019d spent countless hours together. Each time, she looked more desperate, her silent pleas growing harder to ignore.\n\nSimon finally broke down one evening when he found her sitting on the bleachers in the empty gym, her eyes hollow and pleading. He dropped his gym bag and stared at her, his heart pounding in his chest.\n\n\u201cMaddie,\u201d he whispered, his voice cracking. \u201cAre you really here?\u201d\n\nShe nodded, tears brimming in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve been here all along, Simon. Please, you have to believe me.\u201d\n\nHe took a tentative step closer, his mind reeling. \u201cBut how? How is this possible?\u201d\n\nMaddie\u2019s ghostly form shimmered as she took a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know. All I remember is waking up in this...in-between place. And I\u2019m not alone, Simon. There are others.\u201d\n\nSimon\u2019s stomach churned as he sat down beside her, the cold chill of her presence seeping into his bones. \u201cOthers? Like who?\u201d\n\nShe glanced around the empty gym, her expression wary. \u201cThey\u2019re trapped here too, just like me. But they\u2019re not as...friendly. I think they\u2019ve been here a long time. There\u2019s something keeping us here, something tied to the school.\u201d\n\nSimon felt a shiver run down his spine. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nMaddie\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cThere was a tragedy here, decades ago. A fire. Many students died, and their spirits are still trapped. They\u2019re angry, Simon. And they\u2019ve been trying to keep me from finding out the truth about what happened to me.\u201d\n\nSimon\u2019s mind raced. He had heard whispers about the fire, but it was an old story, buried in the annals of the school\u2019s history. \u201cSo, what do we do? How do we find out what really happened?\u201d\n\nMaddie\u2019s expression softened, a hint of the old determination shining through. \u201cWe need to uncover the secrets of that night. Find out who\u2019s responsible for keeping us here. And maybe, just maybe, we can find a way to reclaim my body.\u201d\n\nSimon nodded, a sense of purpose settling over him. He would help Maddie, no matter what it took. They owed each other that much. \n\nThe next day, Simon found himself in the school\u2019s dusty archives, surrounded by yearbooks and yellowed newspaper clippings. Maddie hovered beside him, her ethereal form casting a faint glow over the dimly lit room.\n\n\u201cLook for anything about the fire,\u201d she urged, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nHours passed as Simon combed through the records, piecing together fragments of the past. He discovered that the fire had started in the old science wing, a result of a mysterious explosion. The official reports had chalked it up to a tragic accident, but there were rumors of foul play, whispers of a cover-up.\n\n\u201cMaddie, look at this,\u201d Simon said, holding up a faded photograph of the science wing before the fire. \u201cDo you recognize anyone?\u201d\n\nMaddie leaned closer, her eyes scanning the faces of the students. \u201cThat\u2019s...that\u2019s Mr. Thompson. He was our chemistry teacher.\u201d\n\nSimon\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cHe\u2019s still here, isn\u2019t he? Maybe he knows something.\u201d\n\nDetermined to get answers, Simon sought out Mr. Thompson after school. The old teacher was in his classroom, grading papers with a weary expression. Simon hesitated at the door, his heart pounding.\n\n\u201cMr. Thompson, can I talk to you for a minute?\u201d Simon asked, stepping inside.\n\nMr. Thompson looked up, his eyes narrowing. \u201cSimon, isn\u2019t it? What can I do for you?\u201d\n\nSimon took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking into the fire that happened here decades ago. I think there\u2019s more to the story than what we\u2019ve been told.\u201d\n\nMr. Thompson\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cThat was a long time ago, Simon. Some things are better left in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not just the past,\u201d Simon insisted. \u201cMy friend Maddie\u2014she\u2019s...she\u2019s trapped here. Just like those students who died in the fire. Please, if you know anything, you have to tell me.\u201d\n\nMr. Thompson\u2019s shoulders slumped, and he motioned for Simon to sit. \u201cI was a young teacher back then, eager to prove myself. The explosion...it wasn\u2019t an accident. There were experiments being conducted, dangerous ones. The administration wanted to cover it up, to protect the school\u2019s reputation.\u201d\n\nSimon\u2019s heart raced. \u201cSo, the spirits are trapped because of what happened that night?\u201d\n\nMr. Thompson nodded, his eyes filled with regret. \u201cThey\u2019re bound to this place by the anger and injustice of it all. I\u2019ve tried to move on, but the guilt...it never goes away.\u201d\n\nSimon swallowed hard. \u201cIs there any way to free them? To help Maddie?\u201d\n\nMr. Thompson sighed. \u201cThe truth needs to be exposed. The people responsible need to be held accountable. Only then can the spirits find peace.\u201d\n\nWith a newfound determination, Simon enlisted the help of his friends, rallying them to uncover the full story. They pored over the archives, interviewed former staff members, and even confronted the school board with their findings.\n\nSlowly, the truth emerged. The dangerous experiments, the cover-up, the lives lost\u2014all came to light. The school was forced to acknowledge its dark past, and measures were taken to ensure such a tragedy would never happen again.\n\nOne evening, as Simon stood in the gym where he had first spoken to Maddie\u2019s ghost, he felt a familiar chill. Maddie appeared beside him, her form shimmering with a newfound brightness.\n\n\u201cSimon,\u201d she said, her voice filled with gratitude. \u201cYou did it. You helped us find the truth.\u201d\n\nHe smiled, tears in his eyes. \u201cDoes this mean you\u2019re free?\u201d\n\nMaddie nodded, a peaceful expression on her face. \u201cYes. We can all move on now. Thank you, Simon. For everything.\u201d\n\nAs she began to fade, Simon reached out, his hand passing through hers. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget you, Maddie.\u201d\n\nWith a final smile, Maddie\u2019s spirit dissipated, leaving Simon standing alone in the empty gym. He felt a sense of closure, knowing he had done everything he could to help his friend. The school, now free from its haunted past, felt like a different place\u2014a place where new memories could be made, and old wounds could finally heal.\n\nSimon walked out of the gym, the weight of the past lifted from his shoulders. He knew that Maddie and the others were at peace, and that was enough for him. As he stepped into the sunlight, he felt a renewed sense of hope, ready to face whatever the future held.",
        "story_b": "Simon stood in the dimly lit hallway of Split River High, his footsteps echoing in the silence as he made his way towards the library. The familiar creak of the floorboards beneath him should have been comforting, yet tonight, it was accompanied by an unfamiliar chill that seeped into his bones. He shook his head, trying to dispel the sense of foreboding that clung to him like a shadow.\n\nFor weeks, he had dismissed Maddie's presence as a hallucination, a cruel trick of his grief-stricken mind. She had been his best friend, his confidante, and her sudden disappearance had left a gaping hole in his life. But now, as he approached the library, clutching the old yearbook he'd found in the attic, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.\n\nAs he entered the library, the air seemed to shift, growing colder and more oppressive. The rows of dusty books seemed to close in around him, whispering secrets he couldn't quite hear. He hesitated for a moment, considering turning back, but the thought of Maddie's face, her bright eyes filled with fear and urgency, spurred him on.\n\nHe settled into his usual corner, the overhead lights flickering ominously. The yearbook lay open on the table before him, its yellowed pages filled with black-and-white photographs of students long gone. Simon scanned the pages, searching for anything that might shed light on Maddie's disappearance.\n\nAnd then he saw it.\n\nA photograph of a girl, her features strikingly similar to Maddie's, stared back at him from the page. Her name was scrawled beneath the image: Margaret \"Maddie\" Reynolds, Class of 1983. Simon's heart skipped a beat. It couldn't be a coincidence. He flipped through the pages frantically, finding more photos of students who had mysteriously disappeared over the years, their names and faces lost to time.\n\nSimon felt a shiver run down his spine. Maddie's ghost wasn't an isolated incident. There were others, countless others, trapped within the walls of Split River High. He swallowed hard, the weight of the discovery settling heavily on his shoulders. If Maddie was real, and she needed his help, then he had to act.\n\n\"Simon,\" a voice whispered, barely audible above the rustling pages.\n\nHe froze, his heart pounding in his chest. He turned slowly, his eyes scanning the room for the source of the voice. And there she was, standing at the edge of the shadows, her form shimmering like a mirage. Maddie.\n\n\"Maddie,\" he breathed, his voice cracking with a mixture of relief and fear.\n\n\"Simon, you have to help me,\" she pleaded, her voice urgent and filled with desperation. \"I'm trapped here, and I'm not the only one. You have to find out what happened.\"\n\nSimon nodded, his resolve hardening. \"I will, Maddie. I promise.\"\n\nWith Maddie's guidance, Simon began to piece together the fragmented history of Split River High. The tragedy had occurred decades ago, a fire that had claimed the lives of several students and a teacher. The official reports had deemed it an accident, a faulty electrical wire, but whispers of something darker lingered in the air, rumors of a cover-up, of secrets buried beneath the ashes.\n\nAs the days passed, Simon found himself drawn deeper into the mystery. He explored forgotten wings of the school, discovering hidden rooms and secret passageways that seemed to pulse with a malevolent energy. He pored over old newspaper clippings and faded documents, piecing together a timeline of events that led to the tragedy.\n\nWith each revelation, the school became more oppressive, the shadows growing longer and more sinister. The ghosts of the past seemed to reach out to him, their presence a constant reminder of the lives lost. Yet amidst the darkness, Simon felt a growing sense of purpose, a determination to uncover the truth and set the spirits free.\n\nOne night, as he sat in the library, surrounded by the remnants of the past, he experienced a vivid dream. He found himself standing in the schoolyard, the sun setting on the horizon, casting long shadows across the ground. He watched as the students from the yearbook laughed and played, unaware of the tragedy that awaited them.\n\nHe saw Maddie among them, her laughter ringing out like a melody, her eyes bright with life. And then the scene shifted, the sky darkening as the fire consumed the school, the acrid smoke filling the air. Simon watched helplessly as the students ran, their screams echoing in his ears. He saw the teacher, a figure shrouded in mystery, standing at the edge of the flames, his expression one of sorrow and regret.\n\nSimon awoke with a start, the dream fading away like mist in the morning sun. But the image of the teacher remained, a key piece of the puzzle that had eluded him until now. He was certain that the teacher held the answers he sought, the truth behind the tragedy.\n\nWith renewed determination, Simon delved deeper into the school's history, searching for any mention of the teacher. He discovered that the teacher, Mr. Ellis, had been a beloved figure among the students, known for his kindness and dedication. Yet in the aftermath of the fire, he had vanished without a trace, his name erased from the records as though he had never existed.\n\nSimon knew he had to find Mr. Ellis, to uncover the truth of what had happened that fateful night. He spent countless hours in the library, searching for any clue that might lead him to the missing teacher. And finally, he found it\u2014a letter, hidden within the pages of an old book, written by Mr. Ellis himself.\n\nIn the letter, Mr. Ellis confessed to his role in the tragedy, revealing that he had discovered a dark secret within the school, a secret that had driven him to act. He had tried to save the students, to warn them of the danger, but his efforts had been in vain. The fire had been a result of his actions, an unintended consequence of his desperation to protect the children he loved.\n\nSimon felt a pang of sympathy for Mr. Ellis, understanding the burden of guilt he carried. But more importantly, he realized that the teacher's spirit was still bound to the school, trapped by his own remorse. Simon knew what he had to do.\n\nWith Maddie by his side, Simon ventured into the forgotten wing of the school, the place where the fire had begun. The air was thick with a palpable tension, the whispers of the past growing louder with each step. He found the spot where the fire had started, the charred remnants of the past still visible beneath the layers of dust.\n\n\"Maddie,\" he whispered, his voice steady despite the fear that gripped him. \"We have to help him.\"\n\nTogether, they called out to Mr. Ellis, their voices echoing through the empty halls. Slowly, the shadows began to shift, coalescing into the form of the teacher, his expression one of sorrow and gratitude.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Mr. Ellis said, his voice a soft, echoing whisper. \"I can finally move on.\"\n\nAs the teacher's spirit faded into the ether, Simon felt a sense of peace settle over him. The weight of the tragedy had been lifted, the spirits of the past finally free. He turned to Maddie, her form shimmering in the moonlight, a smile on her lips.\n\n\"Thank you, Simon,\" she said, her voice filled with warmth and gratitude. \"You've given us all a second chance.\"\n\nSimon nodded, tears in his eyes. \"I couldn't have done it without you, Maddie.\"\n\nAs the first light of dawn filtered through the windows, Simon knew that he had found more than just the truth behind the tragedy. He had found a way to honor the memory of those lost, to ensure that their stories would never be forgotten. And in doing so, he had found a way to say goodbye to his best friend, knowing that she, too, could finally find peace.",

        "prompt": "A once-thriving district now overrun by crime, a police department wiped clean and rebuilt from scratch, and a fiery Chief determined to restore order\u2014what secrets and challenges await the new recruits of Arklay Police Department as they step into the shadows of a city on the brink?",
        "ground_truth": "Arklay Police Department was a downtrodden building. Sitting on the junction of Main and Sixth, the dilapidated sixties building was showing all the signs of its age. Faded paint, chipped concrete and sagging plastic that adorned the brutalist frame of the structure. On one side of the building, down an alley that connected Main with the Police Department car park, the message of eternal youth *Fuck The Police* was scrawled in angry red lettering over the concrete. The heavy orange sun began to sink beneath the towering skyline and bathed the dilapidated station in an auburn glow. Arklay had seen better days. Once, it had been the regenerative hope of the sixties, as the prefabricated homes and offices were torn down and replaced with the concrete and steel buildings of the future. Now, however, Arklay was rife with crime and destitution. Half of the buildings in the area were in a major state of disrepair or abandoned completely. The mafia had moved in, in force and now ran a protection racket that was nigh on untouchable under the previous regime and crime rates had soared past the threshold of public or fiscal tolerance. The Chief had ordered a sweeping press conference that stunned both local and regional news outlets. The Chief wiped the entire department in Arklay from their jobs either into retirement or into other departments as a major restructure only one or two extreme veterans were allowed to retain any influence within the precinct. She had wanted a fresh slate for the neighbourhood of Arklay that had been let down by generations of mismanagement and poor policing. The powerful rhetoric had worked on the populace, leading the Chief into a healthy range of mid-term public opinion polls but, now, she had to deliver. The car park of Arklay Police Department was busy, new employees transferred as far in as from across the state to start their new police journey. To set Arklay back on the straight and narrow. The redistribution of certain figures within the department had been viewed with scepticism from some aspects of the media. Was it really a robust challenge on the criminality of Arklay by a courageous Chief or, was it actually, a restructuring by the Chief to set some members of the department up to fail spectacularly? The whispering media mill continued to turn quietly in the background. One floor above the central reception, in a small but functional briefing room. The Chief, a middle aged fiery woman with flaming red hair stood beside the large oak conference table, a glass of iced water clutched in her hand tightly. She surveyed the room with a cold stare, it was her reputation at stake here and she knew that she had to deliver. She may have her fingers in many political and media pies but even the sweetest treat can sour with failure. She is joined by the many recruited members of the new Arklay Department, and one or two of the remaining figures about to depart. Chief among them, the retiring Lieutenant James Gamble, who was once held as a stalwart of bullish interrogation and getting results whatever the cost, who seemed wilted by his age and situation. Mutterings had that the Chief *forced* his decision to retire and that he was merely there for some of the media to get a few last snaps and portray a *happy* handover. The large media screens at one end of the screens recycled images of a happier time in Arklay, when the district had been a blossoming community with a strong police force, and along one wall there was a selection of meagre buffet food and drinks. It seemed to mirror an optimistic parents attempt to win over their child when they had done something wrong. Trying too hard to appear normal just made the *entire* scenario awkward. The Chief took a long cold gulp of the iced water before speaking, lightly rapping her pale knuckles against the table to gain the attention of the room. The mild ambient music filtering through the aging speakers stopped immediately. Thank you everyone for attending. Thank you especially to those of you selected to bring Arklay back under the firm rule of the law and justice. Too long has Arklay been allowed to slump into the archaic depravity of the mafia and oversee rampant disregard for the basics of civilised society. I am pleased to see such a stellar selection from across the city and the state here to reverse this dangerous trend. The speech was full of powerful statements for the media types to note, two of the journalists had already flipped their pads open and were scratching notes. Lieutenant Gamble took a hefty draft from his *Budweiser* in response, he had no intention of listening to his record being shat on whilst sober. He stalked, unnoticed by the reporters, to a far corner of the room and stared reminiscently at the slowly changing photographs. Sandras eyes hardened as she noticed the former Lieutenant sulking. Crime doesnt pay in Arklay anymore than any other district in this fine city. She boomed articulately. Failure is not an option here. Arklays citizens demand more than what they have received in recent years and you she pointed her finger across the new Arklay Department staff. Are my hopes of reversing the situation. But, more importantly, you are all *their* hopes. Now, lets celebrate and get to know each other. She plastered the fakest smile across her face as one of the cameras clicked satisfactorily in the background. The music returned to fill the silence after her speech and people began to mill around the room. The Chief was alone, affording the opportunity to ask her more about the Arklay Police Department and their remit, if anyone of them fancied the chance",
        "story_a": "The neon lights of Arklay City flickered like the last breaths of a dying beast, casting eerie glows upon the rain-slicked streets. Once, this district bustled with the rhythm of prosperity, where laughter echoed through alleys and the hum of commerce sang a hopeful tune. Now, shadows clung to every corner, whispering the tales of crime and despair that had taken root in its heart.\n\nThe Arklay Police Department stood as a stark symbol of both decay and renewal. Its facade, a blend of old stone and modern glass, bore the scars of a turbulent past. Vandalized walls were now scrubbed clean, graffiti replaced by the emblem of a reborn force. The precinct was a phoenix rising from ashes, but the embers of its destruction still glowed with unresolved bitterness.\n\nInside, Chief Leona Hayes surveyed her domain with a steely gaze. Her presence was a force of nature\u2014fiery, unyielding. She had been brought in to cleanse the department of corruption and to spark the flame of justice once more. Her auburn hair, tied in a tight bun, seemed to burn with the same intensity as her mission. Every officer under her command knew she was not one to be trifled with; respect was earned, not given.\n\nLeona's office was cluttered with files, maps, and reports, each a fragment of the city\u2019s broken soul. She leaned over her desk, scrutinizing the latest crime statistics. The numbers were grim, but they were her adversary, and she would not yield to them. Outside her door, the precinct buzzed with the nervous energy of new recruits\u2014eager, green, and blissfully unaware of the trials that awaited them.\n\n\"Chief?\" A tentative knock accompanied the voice. Detective Marcus Cole, a veteran with a reputation for his unorthodox methods, stepped in. His rugged face carried the lines of a man who had seen too much, too soon. Despite his weariness, his eyes sparked with a hint of rebellion.\n\n\"Come in, Cole,\" Leona said without looking up.\n\n\"We\u2019ve got the latest batch of rookies ready for orientation,\" Marcus informed her, his tone a mix of skepticism and hope. \"You sure they're up to it?\"\n\nLeona finally raised her eyes, piercing him with a look that brooked no argument. \"They\u2019ll have to be. We don\u2019t have the luxury of time or resources to coddle them. This city needs heroes, and we will forge them from whatever raw material we have.\"\n\nMarcus nodded, though doubt lingered in his mind. \"I hope you're right, Chief.\"\n\nThe briefing room was a stark contrast to the rest of the precinct\u2014clean, organized, almost clinical. The recruits sat in rigid rows, their expressions a blend of excitement and apprehension. Among them, two stood out.\n\nJenna Morales, sharp-eyed and determined, had grown up in Arklay City. She knew these streets like the back of her hand. Her dark hair was cropped short, and her posture radiated confidence. She was here not just to serve, but to reclaim her home from the clutches of the criminals who had stolen it.\n\nBeside her sat Alex Turner, a transfer from a neighboring district. His calm demeanor and analytical mind had earned him top marks in the academy, but Arklay\u2019s chaos was a different beast altogether. His blond hair fell over his forehead, and he pushed his glasses up nervously as he glanced around the room.\n\nChief Hayes entered, her presence commanding instant silence. She scanned the room, her eyes lingering on each recruit, weighing their potential. \"Welcome to Arklay Police Department,\" she began, her voice steady and authoritative. \"You are here because we believe you have what it takes to make a difference. This city is on the brink, and it\u2019s our job to pull it back from the edge.\"\n\nShe paused, letting her words sink in. \"The district you now serve was once a beacon of hope. It fell into darkness because those sworn to protect it betrayed their oaths. We will not let that happen again. You will face danger, corruption, and temptation. But you will also have the chance to be part of something greater than yourselves.\"\n\nJenna felt a surge of determination. This was her fight, her chance to reclaim the city she loved. Alex, on the other hand, felt the weight of the responsibility settle on his shoulders. He knew the path ahead would be treacherous, but he was ready to walk it.\n\n\"Detective Cole will be your guide,\" Leona continued, nodding towards Marcus, who stepped forward. \"He knows these streets and the challenges that come with them. Listen to him, learn from him, but most importantly, trust your instincts.\"\n\nMarcus gave a curt nod, his gaze sweeping over the recruits. \"This isn\u2019t just a job. It\u2019s a calling. The badge you wear is a symbol of trust, and you must earn it every day. Now, let\u2019s get to work.\"\n\nThe recruits filed out of the room, their minds buzzing with anticipation. Jenna and Alex exchanged glances, a silent pact forming between them. They would watch each other\u2019s backs, no matter what.\n\nAs the precinct settled into its rhythm, the city outside remained restless. In the shadows, unseen forces plotted and schemed, their whispers carried on the wind. Arklay\u2019s heart beat with a dangerous pulse, and the new recruits would soon learn that beneath the surface of their mission lay secrets darker than they could imagine.\n\nIn a dimly lit alley, a figure watched the precinct from afar. Cloaked in shadows, they observed the comings and goings with a keen interest. A smirk played on their lips as they whispered, \"Let the games begin.\"\n\nAnd so, as the rain continued to fall and the neon lights flickered, Arklay City held its breath, waiting for the inevitable clash between light and darkness. The new recruits of the Arklay Police Department were about to step into a world where every decision mattered, and every shadow hid a story yet to be told.",
        "story_b": "The district of Arklay had once been the jewel of the city, its streets bustling with life and commerce, where laughter echoed between the buildings and the aroma of freshly baked bread wafted through the air. But those days were long gone. Now, the streets lay quiet under the oppressive weight of neglect, their surfaces cracked and littered with debris. Abandoned storefronts, once vibrant with color and light, stood as empty shells, their windows shattered and covered in layers of grime and graffiti. The district had fallen victim to a cancer of crime, spreading through its veins and leaving decay in its wake.\n\nIt was against this backdrop that the new recruits of the Arklay Police Department arrived, their footsteps echoing in the tense silence that hung over the precinct. The department itself had been wiped clean, the old guard swept away to make room for fresh faces and new ideas. Chief Samuel Greer, a man with a reputation as fiery as his red hair, stood at the helm, determined to restore order to the chaos.\n\nAs the recruits gathered in the precinct's briefing room, they exchanged nervous glances, each one aware of the enormity of the task before them. Among them was Elena Torres, her jaw set with determination as she surveyed her new colleagues. She had grown up on the outskirts of Arklay, her childhood memories filled with stories of its former glory. The district's decline was personal to her, and she was driven by a desire to see it rise again.\n\nChief Greer entered the room, his presence commanding immediate attention. His piercing blue eyes swept over the group, assessing each recruit with a sharp gaze. \"Welcome to Arklay,\" he began, his voice a gravelly growl that cut through the air. \"This district is on the brink, and it\u2019s up to us to pull it back from the edge.\"\n\nHe paused, letting the weight of his words settle over them. \"You're here because you have what it takes. You\u2019re the best of the best. But make no mistake\u2014this will be the toughest fight of your careers.\"\n\nThe recruits listened intently, the gravity of their mission sinking in. As Chief Greer continued, he outlined the recent string of unexplained disappearances that had plagued the district. The case would be their first challenge, a mystery that had stumped the previous force and left the community gripped by fear.\n\nRumors whispered through the streets of Arklay, tales of shadowy figures seen in the alleys and strange lights flickering in the windows of abandoned buildings. Some spoke of a syndicate, a hidden power pulling the strings behind the scenes, their reach extending into every corner of the district. For Elena, these stories were more than urban legends; they were the key to understanding the district's decline.\n\nThe recruits were dismissed, and Elena found herself paired with Mark Li, a fellow newcomer whose calm demeanor belied a sharp mind. As they stepped out onto the streets, the cool air carried the distant sound of sirens, a constant reminder of the district's unrest.\n\nMark broke the silence, his voice thoughtful. \"You think there's any truth to those rumors?\"\n\nElena considered the question, her gaze sweeping over the crumbling facades of once-grand buildings. \"There's always a grain of truth in stories like these,\" she replied. \"We just need to figure out what's real and what's not.\"\n\nTheir first stop was an abandoned warehouse, a notorious hotspot for illicit activity. As they approached, Elena noticed the faint smell of smoke lingering in the air, a sign of recent use. Inside, the vast space was dimly lit, the shadows stretching long and deep.\n\nThey moved cautiously, their senses heightened by the knowledge that they were not alone. Elena's heart pounded in her chest, but she kept her focus sharp, aware of the importance of their mission. This was more than just a job for her\u2014it was a chance to reclaim her district.\n\nTheir search yielded little in the way of evidence, but as they regrouped outside, Elena spotted something glinting in the gutter. She bent down, retrieving a silver locket caked with dirt. It was a small thing, but it felt significant, a piece of the puzzle that might lead them closer to the truth.\n\nThe day wore on, and the recruits reconvened at the precinct, their expressions a mix of exhaustion and determination. Chief Greer was waiting for them, his demeanor as intense as ever. \"Good work out there,\" he acknowledged, though his tone was far from satisfied. \"But we need more. We need to dig deeper.\"\n\nElena held up the locket, the small object catching the light. \"I found this,\" she said, her voice steady. \"It could belong to one of the missing.\"\n\nThe Chief took the locket, his eyes narrowing as he examined it. \"This is a start,\" he said, a hint of approval in his voice. \"Keep following the trail. We need to know who's behind this.\"\n\nAs the recruits dispersed, Elena felt a renewed sense of purpose. The district's secrets were slowly unraveling, and she was determined to see the investigation through to the end. The challenges were immense, but she knew she wasn\u2019t alone. With Chief Greer's leadership and the support of her fellow officers, there was hope for Arklay yet.\n\nThe night descended over the district, the streets cloaked in shadow. But somewhere in the darkness, answers awaited. Elena and her colleagues would not rest until they brought light to the secrets lurking in Arklay's heart. The district's transformation was far from over, and the new recruits of the Arklay Police Department were ready to face whatever lay ahead.",

        "ground_truth": "Arklay Police Department was a downtrodden building. Sitting on the junction of Main and Sixth, the dilapidated sixties building was showing all the signs of its age. Faded paint, chipped concrete and sagging plastic that adorned the brutalist frame of the structure. On one side of the building, down an alley that connected Main with the Police Department car park, the message of eternal youth *Fuck The Police* was scrawled in angry red lettering over the concrete. The heavy orange sun began to sink beneath the towering skyline and bathed the dilapidated station in an auburn glow. Arklay had seen better days. Once, it had been the regenerative hope of the sixties, as the prefabricated homes and offices were torn down and replaced with the concrete and steel buildings of the future. Now, however, Arklay was rife with crime and destitution. Half of the buildings in the area were in a major state of disrepair or abandoned completely. The mafia had moved in, in force and now ran a protection racket that was nigh on untouchable under the previous regime and crime rates had soared past the threshold of public or fiscal tolerance. The Chief had ordered a sweeping press conference that stunned both local and regional news outlets. The Chief wiped the entire department in Arklay from their jobs either into retirement or into other departments as a major restructure only one or two extreme veterans were allowed to retain any influence within the precinct. She had wanted a fresh slate for the neighbourhood of Arklay that had been let down by generations of mismanagement and poor policing. The powerful rhetoric had worked on the populace, leading the Chief into a healthy range of mid-term public opinion polls but, now, she had to deliver. The car park of Arklay Police Department was busy, new employees transferred as far in as from across the state to start their new police journey. To set Arklay back on the straight and narrow. The redistribution of certain figures within the department had been viewed with scepticism from some aspects of the media. Was it really a robust challenge on the criminality of Arklay by a courageous Chief or, was it actually, a restructuring by the Chief to set some members of the department up to fail spectacularly? The whispering media mill continued to turn quietly in the background. One floor above the central reception, in a small but functional briefing room. The Chief, a middle aged fiery woman with flaming red hair stood beside the large oak conference table, a glass of iced water clutched in her hand tightly. She surveyed the room with a cold stare, it was her reputation at stake here and she knew that she had to deliver. She may have her fingers in many political and media pies but even the sweetest treat can sour with failure. She is joined by the many recruited members of the new Arklay Department, and one or two of the remaining figures about to depart. Chief among them, the retiring Lieutenant James Gamble, who was once held as a stalwart of bullish interrogation and getting results whatever the cost, who seemed wilted by his age and situation. Mutterings had that the Chief *forced* his decision to retire and that he was merely there for some of the media to get a few last snaps and portray a *happy* handover. The large media screens at one end of the screens recycled images of a happier time in Arklay, when the district had been a blossoming community with a strong police force, and along one wall there was a selection of meagre buffet food and drinks. It seemed to mirror an optimistic parents attempt to win over their child when they had done something wrong. Trying too hard to appear normal just made the *entire* scenario awkward. The Chief took a long cold gulp of the iced water before speaking, lightly rapping her pale knuckles against the table to gain the attention of the room. The mild ambient music filtering through the aging speakers stopped immediately. Thank you everyone for attending. Thank you especially to those of you selected to bring Arklay back under the firm rule of the law and justice. Too long has Arklay been allowed to slump into the archaic depravity of the mafia and oversee rampant disregard for the basics of civilised society. I am pleased to see such a stellar selection from across the city and the state here to reverse this dangerous trend. The speech was full of powerful statements for the media types to note, two of the journalists had already flipped their pads open and were scratching notes. Lieutenant Gamble took a hefty draft from his *Budweiser* in response, he had no intention of listening to his record being shat on whilst sober. He stalked, unnoticed by the reporters, to a far corner of the room and stared reminiscently at the slowly changing photographs. Sandras eyes hardened as she noticed the former Lieutenant sulking. Crime doesnt pay in Arklay anymore than any other district in this fine city. She boomed articulately. Failure is not an option here. Arklays citizens demand more than what they have received in recent years and you she pointed her finger across the new Arklay Department staff. Are my hopes of reversing the situation. But, more importantly, you are all *their* hopes. Now, lets celebrate and get to know each other. She plastered the fakest smile across her face as one of the cameras clicked satisfactorily in the background. The music returned to fill the silence after her speech and people began to mill around the room. The Chief was alone, affording the opportunity to ask her more about the Arklay Police Department and their remit, if anyone of them fancied the chance",

Her presence was a force of nature\u2014fiery, unyielding. She had been brought in to cleanse the department of corruption and to spark the flame of justice once more. Her auburn hair, tied in a tight bun, seemed to burn with the same intensity as her mission. Every officer under her command knew she was not one to be trifled with; respect was earned, not given.\n\nLeona's office was cluttered with files, maps, and reports, each a fragment of the city\u2019s broken soul.

Outside her door, the precinct buzzed with the nervous energy of new recruits\u2014eager, green, and blissfully unaware of the trials that awaited them.\n\n\"Chief?\" A tentative knock accompanied the voice. Detective Marcus Cole, a veteran with a reputation for his unorthodox methods, stepped in. His rugged face carried the lines of a man who had seen too much, too soon. Despite his weariness, his eyes sparked with a hint of rebellion.\n\n\"Come in, Cole,\" Leona said without looking up.\n\n\"We\u2019ve got the latest batch of rookies ready for orientation,\" Marcus informed her, his tone a mix of skepticism and hope. \"You sure they're up to it?\"\n\nLeona finally raised her eyes, piercing him with a look that brooked no argument. \"They\u2019ll have to be.

She knew these streets like the back of her hand. Her dark hair was cropped short, and her posture radiated confidence. She was here not just to serve, but to reclaim her home from the clutches of the criminals who had stolen it.\n\nBeside her sat Alex Turner, a transfer from a neighboring district. His calm demeanor and analytical mind had earned him top marks in the academy, but Arklay\u2019s chaos was a different beast altogether. His blond hair fell over his forehead, and he pushed his glasses up nervously as he glanced around the room.\n\nChief Hayes entered, her presence commanding instant silence. She scanned the room, her eyes lingering on each recruit, weighing their potential. \"Welcome to Arklay Police Department,\" she began, her voice steady and authoritative. \"You are here because we believe you have what it takes to make a difference. This city is on the brink, and it\u2019s our job to pull it back from the edge.\"\n\nShe paused, letting her words sink in. \"The district you now serve was once a beacon of hope. It fell into darkness because those sworn to protect it betrayed their oaths. We will not let that happen again. You will face danger, corruption, and temptation. But you will also have the chance to be part of something greater than yourselves.\"\n\nJenna felt a surge of determination. This was her fight, her chance to reclaim the city she loved. Alex, on the other hand, felt the weight of the responsibility settle on his shoulders. He knew the path ahead would be treacherous, but he was ready to walk it.\n\n\"Detective Cole will be your guide,\" Leona continued, nodding towards Marcus, who stepped forward. \"He knows these streets and the challenges that come with them. Listen to him, learn from him, but most importantly, trust your instincts.\"\n\nMarcus gave a curt nod, his gaze sweeping over the recruits. \"This isn\u2019t just a job. It\u2019s a calling. The badge you wear is a symbol of trust, and you must earn it every day. Now, let\u2019s get to work.\"\n\nThe recruits filed out of the room, their minds buzzing with anticipation. Jenna and Alex exchanged glances, a silent pact forming between them. They would watch each other\u2019s backs, no matter what.\n\nAs the precinct settled into its rhythm, the city outside remained restless.

        "story_b": "The city of Arklay, once a bastion of prosperity and innovation, had fallen into a chasm of disrepair and lawlessness. Its history, etched in the grand architecture of bygone eras, spoke of a time when the streets thrummed with the energy of commerce and community. Now, these same streets lay in shadow, their cobblestones cracked and marred by the relentless passage of time and neglect. The vibrant hues of shops and homes were faded, replaced by the grim palette of graffiti and grime. \n\nIt was from this backdrop that the new Arklay Police Department emerged, a beacon of hope amidst the encroaching darkness. The precinct, a gleaming structure of steel and glass, stood in stark contrast to its surroundings. Inside, the air was filled with the hum of technology, the quiet efficiency of a place designed to reclaim order from chaos. The walls adorned with commendations and old photographs from the department's storied past offered a nod to the legacy of those who once walked its halls.\n\nChief Elena Marquez surveyed the city from the expansive window of her office, her gaze lingering on the horizon where the skyline met the dull glow of the setting sun. Her family's legacy in law enforcement stretched back generations, each ancestor etched into the annals of Arklay's tumultuous history. She was driven by a personal vendetta against the crime that had claimed the city she loved. The echoes of her father's words, a former officer who had fallen in the line of duty, resonated in her mind: \"This city is worth fighting for.\"\n\nAs she pondered the weight of her mission, the door creaked open, and Detective Henry Lawson entered. A seasoned veteran, his presence was a steadying force within the newly reformed department. His experience in cybercrime was invaluable, his eyes sharp and discerning as they swept over the files spread across the Chief's desk.\n\n\"Evening, Chief,\" Lawson greeted, his voice a gravelly rumble. \"Looks like we're in for a long night.\"\n\nElena nodded, pushing a stray lock of hair behind her ear. \"Arklay won't fix itself, Henry. We need every edge we can get.\" Her voice was firm, yet tinged with a weariness that spoke of countless sleepless nights.\n\nLawson moved to the window, his reflection merging with the city's shadowy outline. \"I remember when this place was different. A lifetime ago, it feels like.\"\n\nElena's eyes softened for a moment. \"It's why we're here. To bring it back.\"\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Officer Jamie Ortiz, a new recruit whose youthful enthusiasm was tempered by the shadows of her past. Her journey to the department had been a difficult one, her determination to make a difference rooted in personal history with the city's underbelly.\n\n\"Ma'am, Detective,\" Jamie said, her voice carrying a hint of nervousness as she entered the room. The crispness of her new uniform contrasted sharply with the weariness etched into her features.\n\n\"Ortiz,\" Lawson acknowledged with a nod. \"Ready for your first night patrol?\"\n\nJamie straightened, her resolve visible in the set of her jaw. \"Yes, sir. I've been waiting for this.\"\n\nElena smiled, a flicker of warmth breaking through her stern facade. \"Remember, Jamie, this city is full of secrets. Keep your wits about you. And trust your instincts.\"\n\nThe young officer nodded, her eyes bright with determination. \"I will, Chief. I won't let you down.\"\n\nAs Jamie exited the office, the Chief and Detective returned their attention to the city. The distant wail of sirens echoed through the night, a reminder of the challenges that lay ahead. Elena's fingers drummed against the polished wood of her desk, her mind a whirl of strategies and plans.\n\n\"Do you think we're ready, Chief?\" Lawson asked, his gaze unwavering.\n\nElena's response was immediate, her conviction unshakeable. \"We have to be. The people of Arklay are counting on us. And I won't let them down.\"\n\nAs the night deepened, the precinct buzzed with activity. Officers prepared for their shifts, their movements a choreographed dance of efficiency and purpose. The high-tech forensics lab hummed with energy, its sterile surfaces gleaming under fluorescent lights. In the austere holding cells, the quiet tension of those awaiting judgment lingered in the air.\n\nThe city, too, was alive with its own rhythm. In the shadows, whispers of the criminal underworld intermingled with the myths of old. Tales of infamous criminals and legendary police heroes wove through the fabric of Arklay's history, their legacies a constant reminder of the battle between order and chaos.\n\nFor Elena, this battle was personal. Her father's legacy loomed large, a beacon guiding her through the darkness. She could still recall the stories he told of Arklay's golden age, when the streets were safe and the community thrived. Those memories fueled her determination, igniting a fire within her that burned brighter with each passing day.\n\nAs the first light of dawn broke over the city, Elena stood at her window once more. The streets below were still shrouded in the remnants of night, but the promise of a new day shimmered on the horizon. She knew the road ahead would be fraught with challenges, but the Chief of the Arklay Police Department was ready. With her team by her side, she would fight for the city that had given her everything.\n\nArklay was on the brink, but Elena Marquez was determined to pull it back from the edge. The city's secrets would be unveiled, its challenges met head-on. And in the end, she would see Arklay restored to its former glory\u2014a testament to the resilience of its people and the indomitable spirit of those sworn to protect them.",

He knew the path ahead would be treacherous, but he was ready to walk it.\n\n\"Detective Cole will be your guide,\" Leona continued, nodding towards Marcus, who stepped forward. \"He knows these streets and the challenges that come with them. Listen to him, learn from him, but most importantly, trust your instincts.\"\n\nMarcus gave a curt nod, his gaze sweeping over the recruits. \"This isn\u2019t just a job. It\u2019s a calling. The badge you wear is a symbol of trust, and you must earn it every day. Now, let\u2019s get to work.\"\n\nThe recruits filed out of the room, their minds buzzing with anticipation. Jenna and Alex exchanged glances, a silent pact forming between them. They would watch each other\u2019s backs, no matter what.\n\nAs the precinct settled into its rhythm, the city outside remained restless. In the shadows, unseen forces plotted and schemed, their whispers carried on the wind. Arklay\u2019s heart beat with a dangerous pulse, and the new recruits would soon learn that beneath the surface of their mission lay secrets darker than they could imagine.\n\nIn a dimly lit alley, a figure watched the precinct from afar. Cloaked in shadows, they observed the comings and goings with a keen interest. A smirk played on their lips as they whispered, \"Let the games begin.\"\n\nAnd so, as the rain continued to fall and the neon lights flickered, Arklay City held its breath, waiting for the inevitable clash between light and darkness. The new recruits of the Arklay Police Department were about to step into a world where every decision mattered, and every shadow hid a story yet to be told.",
        "story_b": "In the heart of Arklay City, where prosperity had once reigned, a district now lay shrouded in decay. Tall buildings that had stood as testaments to human achievement were now husks of their former glory. The streets, once bustling with life and laughter, had become a labyrinth of shadowed alleys and flickering neon signs. Crime thrived in the cracks of this urban jungle, where the acrid smell of smoke lingered in the air, and the distant wail of sirens echoed through the night.\n\nThe Arklay Police Department had been a casualty of its own past. Corruption had seeped into its core, eroding trust and respect until it was merely a shell of what it had been. But now, under the unyielding gaze of Chief Elara Morgan, the department had been wiped clean, rebuilt from the ground up. She was a force of nature, fiery and determined, with a singular purpose: to restore order to the chaos that had claimed her city.\n\nIn the sterile confines of the new headquarters, the recruits gathered for their first briefing. The room was stark, a contrast to the world outside, with its polished floors and gleaming walls. Chief Morgan stood at the front, her presence commanding and fierce, her eyes scanning the room as if she could see into the very souls of the young officers standing before her.\n\n\"Welcome to Arklay,\" she began, her voice a blend of authority and challenge. \"This city is on the brink, and it's up to us to pull it back. You will face dangers you\u2019ve never imagined, uncover truths you\u2019d rather not know, but you will not falter. Not on my watch.\"\n\nThe recruits exchanged glances, each silently weighing their resolve against the daunting task ahead. Among them was Cole Ramirez, a young officer with a personal vendetta against crime. His brother had fallen victim to the district\u2019s lawlessness, and now, standing in this room, he vowed to bring justice not just for him, but for everyone who had suffered.\n\nBeside him, Mira Chen, a tech-savvy recruit with a penchant for uncovering secrets, adjusted her glasses. She could see the challenge as an opportunity to unearth the mysteries buried within the department\u2019s history\u2014a history she knew was riddled with corruption and deceit.\n\nAs the recruits dispersed to their respective posts, Chief Morgan lingered, her gaze fixed on the map of the district pinned to the wall. Each mark, each red circle, represented an unsolved crime, a mystery yet to be unraveled. The pressure from city officials was mounting; they demanded results, demanded peace, but Morgan knew that beneath the surface lay more than just a string of petty crimes. There was something deeper, darker, lurking in the shadows.\n\nThe first day on the streets was a baptism by fire. Cole and his partner, veteran officer Jake Thorne, patrolled the district, their eyes sharp, senses attuned to the undercurrents of tension that ran through the city. Thorne, with his grizzled demeanor and a past he rarely spoke of, had seen the district at its best and worst. He knew the dangers lurking behind every corner, the desperation that fueled the city's descent into chaos.\n\n\"Keep your eyes open, kid,\" Thorne muttered as they navigated through a narrow alley. \"This place has a way of swallowing you whole if you're not careful.\"\n\nCole nodded, determination etched on his face. \"I\u2019m not here to be careful, Jake. I\u2019m here to make a difference.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in the tech hub of the department, Mira was deep in the digital web of the city's records. Her fingers danced over the keyboard, uncovering patterns and connections that spoke of a conspiracy far more intricate than anyone had imagined. Her heart raced as she stumbled upon encrypted files, remnants of the department\u2019s corrupt past.\n\nThe deeper she delved, the more she realized the magnitude of what they were up against. This was not just about solving crimes; it was about dismantling a network of deceit that had ensnared the city for years. She hurried to report her findings to Chief Morgan, knowing that time was of the essence.\n\nBack on the streets, Cole and Thorne found themselves in the midst of a confrontation. A group of masked figures loomed in the dim light of the alley, a showdown imminent. Cole\u2019s heart pounded, adrenaline surging through him as he faced the threat head-on. Thorne\u2019s voice cut through the tension, calm yet commanding.\n\n\"We don\u2019t want trouble,\" he said, his hand resting on his holster. \"But we won\u2019t back down.\"\n\nThe standoff seemed to stretch into eternity, the air thick with potential violence. But in that moment, Cole understood the gravity of their mission. It wasn\u2019t just about enforcing the law; it was about reclaiming the soul of a city teetering on the edge.\n\nBack at headquarters, Chief Morgan pored over Mira\u2019s findings, her mind racing with possibilities and threats. The recruits were her hope, her chance to turn the tide, but the weight of the city\u2019s fate rested heavily on her shoulders.\n\nAs night fell over Arklay, the recruits returned, weary but unbroken. They had faced their first day in the shadows, had glimpsed the enormity of the challenge before them. But within each of them burned a flicker of resolve, a shared understanding that this was only the beginning.\n\nChief Morgan addressed them one last time, her voice steady, unwavering. \"This city is counting on us. Together, we will uncover the secrets, confront the darkness. And we will restore Arklay to its former glory. This is our city, and we will not let it fall.\"\n\nIn the flickering light of the city, the recruits stood united, ready to face whatever lay ahead. The journey was fraught with danger and uncertainty, but within the heart of Arklay, hope had been rekindled.",

        "prompt": "In 1970s Times Square, you work in a tiny cigarette booth surrounded by impatient hands and the haze of tobacco, dreaming of something more. One day, an unusual job interview promises escape\u2014but at what cost?",
        "ground_truth": "I could extend both arms inside my cubicle, if you included the window slot that I delivered the cigarettes through. Candy too but mostly cigarettes bought in some Southern state near the tobacco fields and smuggled over state lines for cheap. Basil didn\u2019t do the smuggling. Balding, bellicose, and most of the time beaming, the closest he came to clandestine was using a paper bag to hold the take, reasoning that carrying a zippered cash purse had dollar signs all over it, and his bag said \u201cLunch.\u201d\n\nI was not eating lunch in those days, too expensive, maybe a Mars bar that I had to report. Lunch also took time away from slapping packs into the hands forever sticking themselves through the slot, something I did almost maternally rather than for money, given that the job paid maybe five bucks an hour. Again and again those hands beseeched, wriggling their impatient, addicted fingers. I worked in Times Square, long before the area was covered with moving images rather than the lurid static. Businessmen, not just the down-and-outs, were customers, men slumming for pleasure, starting with nicotine. It never occurred to me that I was being sold too, standing inside my glass-fronted box. Wearing peasant skirts and long-sleeved tops, without makeup, not even lipstick, I represented less the gateway drug of nicotine than the loss leader, virtue. How could the peep shows be so bad if she was here?\n\nI didn\u2019t see myself as part of what there was to see at all, I saw only the hands coming in through the slot with their clutched cash, sometimes wanting whole cartons, some just matches. Seldom did I have time to exchange any semblance of talk through the glass, what had been touted by Basil as bulletproof\u2014as reassurance, not to scare me\u2014but what was surely only thick Plexiglass, old and scratched. He hired me as soon as he heard I was going to Columbia. He said only girls from the finest institutions (emphasis on the syllable tu) can add. Few can these days, grumbled Basil, grabbing the paper bag with my calculations stapled to its fold.\n\nWhen my shift ended midafternoon\u2014and it often did, since Times Square attracted early risers and late-goers, people who needed cigarettes far more than coffee or the light of day\u2014Basil would take me along in his old station wagon to have me collect the paper bags from other cubicles. Who would imagine a girl could have so much cash? I didn\u2019t know about the Mafia and its stranglehold on his faux importation of tobacco, how Basil must have paid them off or been part of it.\n\nSince it was too much trouble to unlatch the so-called bulletproof window, the girls in the other cubicles stuffed their bags through the slots, girls grateful for the three-minute break of hello-how-are-you, sitting on stools like mine in an equally tiny space, surrounded by merchandise stretching far up to the ceiling and a space heater at their feet that threatened to turn it all into smoke. They were usually caught reading, book in one hand, a packet of cigarettes in the other, Peyton Place more often than Varieties of Religious Experience, resisting the education Basil said we all needed and that he so envied. He wanted women good with spreadsheets, not sheets, he said. I suspected otherwise, he treated us so nicely. A bonus every month of as many candy bars as you wanted, guaranteeing to stop pilfering he said, because of how sick it would make us. No one was hired who smoked, but the stench of tobacco was so strong in our clothes people asked us for a light on the subway home.\n\nI had an interview one afternoon for a new job that its ad said would pay better. Women only, for artistic purposes. It sounded, at the very least, less claustrophobic. Basil was annoyed. All that training he\u2019d given me going to waste on art? I didn\u2019t enumerate the three things I had learned from him: adding on a machine, smiling at the customer but not too much, and always stacking the bills faceup, from small to big.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if I have a contract, I said, tossing my half-eaten Mars bar out the car window, having found a delicate white worm in the center.\n\nCurious who would pay more for an untrained girl, he drove me to the interview, the paper bags already collected. It\u2019s the least I can do, he said, trying to sound terribly generous. That way I can return you back to your job with two weeks\u2019 notice.\n\nIt\u2019s just an interview, I said, as if his job meant everything.\n\nAre you looking to bargain for a higher wage?\n\nThe thought hadn\u2019t occurred to me, I said. Sure.\n\nHe was pulling up to the location. Well, you might have me over a barrel, he said, seeing money in exclamation marks all in the building. Sleek, of the newest architecture, it even had automatic elevators without a nosy operator, as I soon discovered once inside.\n\nI was ready for art.\n\nRoom 507 contained a man with a clipboard sitting on a folding chair and a camera on a stand. No one else waited to be seen. Hello, said the man, as impersonally as possible. No point in sitting down, he said.\n\nI\u2019ve been selling cigarettes, I said, as if it were a credential.\n\nThat\u2019s nice, he said, and tilted his head to look me over. I pay well, just like it says in the ad.\n\nArt? I asked, the ad out of my purse and in my hand.\n\nCommercial, he said, still eyeing me. Take off your clothes.\n\nDid I say, What? Did I say, Thanks anyway? I took off my clothes. After all, I\u2019d spent a semester drawing nudes. Though I didn\u2019t go so far as to pull my jeans past my knees. Surely he could get enough of an idea without that. I was already braless, and stood with my shirt half-untucked, hanging on my arm.\n\nHe was embarrassed for me. He waved his hand and said he\u2019d call. Put your number here, he said, pointing at his clipboard. He didn\u2019t even take a picture with his big camera.\n\nBasil had circled the block a few times but he was waiting. I got in.\n\nYou could use a drink, he said, glancing at me. There\u2019s a nice ladies\u2019 place uptown. He swung into traffic, away from Times Square.\n\nI don\u2019t drink, I said, and I have schoolwork.\n\nHe kept on driving. You girls are a dime a dozen, he said. It\u2019s amazing. Art, he said, shaking his head.\n\nI hopped out at the first stoplight.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The cigarette booth was a small, glass-walled cage in the heart of Times Square, a microcosm of the city's chaos and vibrancy. It was 1974, and the air was thick with the smell of tobacco and the chatter of impatient New Yorkers. I spent my days in a haze of smoke and noise, handing out packs of Marlboros and Camels to a never-ending stream of customers, their faces blurring into a single, insistent demand.\n\n\"Pack of Winstons,\" a man grunted, shoving a crumpled dollar bill through the slot. His eyes were bloodshot, his fingers yellowed with nicotine.\n\nI nodded, my fingers deftly retrieving the pack from the shelf behind me. The transaction was over in seconds, and he disappeared into the crowd, just another ghost in the city that never sleeps.\n\nI often wondered how I ended up here, in this tiny booth surrounded by glass and smoke. I had dreams once\u2014dreams of writing, of telling stories that mattered. But life had a way of narrowing possibilities, and now my world was no bigger than this booth, no brighter than the neon lights that flickered outside.\n\nOne rainy afternoon, as I watched the raindrops race down the glass, a woman approached the booth. She was different from the usual clientele\u2014her clothes were immaculate, her posture regal. She slid a business card through the slot with a practiced elegance.\n\n\"Are you interested in a job opportunity?\" she asked, her voice smooth and confident.\n\nI glanced at the card. It was plain, with only a name\u2014Eleanor Blackwood\u2014and a phone number printed in bold letters. The simplicity was almost intimidating.\n\n\"What kind of job?\" I asked, curiosity piqued.\n\n\"Something more suited to your talents,\" she replied cryptically. \"Call me if you're interested.\"\n\nAnd with that, she was gone, swallowed by the throng of pedestrians. I turned the card over in my fingers, the weight of it surprisingly heavy for such a small piece of paper. That night, after the booth was locked and the city had quieted to a dull roar, I dialed the number.\n\nEleanor answered on the first ring. \"Meet me at the Roosevelt Hotel tomorrow at noon,\" she said, and hung up before I could respond.\n\nThe next day, I found myself standing in the opulent lobby of the Roosevelt, feeling out of place in my worn jacket and scuffed shoes. Eleanor spotted me immediately and led me to a quiet corner of the hotel's bar.\n\n\"Thank you for coming,\" she said, her smile warm but inscrutable. \"I represent a group of individuals who have a keen interest in literature and the arts. We need someone with your skills to assist us.\"\n\nHer words were a lifeline, pulling me out of the suffocating routine of the cigarette booth. \"What exactly would I be doing?\" I asked, my heart pounding.\n\n\"Writing,\" she said simply. \"Researching, documenting. We have access to stories that need to be told, but we require a storyteller.\"\n\nIt sounded too good to be true. \"And what's the catch?\" I asked, wary of the ease with which she offered this escape.\n\nEleanor's smile faltered for the briefest moment. \"Discretion is paramount. Some of the work may involve sensitive material, things that cannot be shared with the public.\"\n\nI hesitated, the weight of the decision settling on my shoulders. But the promise of something more\u2014something meaningful\u2014was too strong to resist. \"I'm in,\" I said finally.\n\nThe weeks that followed were a whirlwind. I left the cigarette booth behind, diving headfirst into a world of clandestine meetings and whispered secrets. Eleanor introduced me to a network of writers, artists, and intellectuals, each with their own piece of the puzzle. My task was to weave these fragments into a coherent narrative, a tapestry of truth hidden beneath layers of deception.\n\nI thrived on the challenge, the thrill of uncovering hidden stories. But as the weeks turned into months, I began to notice the shadows lurking behind Eleanor's polished facade. There were meetings held in darkened rooms, conversations that stopped abruptly when I entered. The stories I was documenting grew darker, more dangerous.\n\nOne night, as I pored over a stack of documents, Eleanor appeared at my door. Her usual composure was replaced by a palpable tension. \"We need to talk,\" she said, her voice edged with urgency.\n\nShe led me to a secluded park, the city's noise muted by the thick foliage. \"You've done excellent work,\" she began, \"but there are forces at play that you don't fully understand.\"\n\nI frowned, confusion gnawing at me. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nEleanor sighed, her eyes searching mine. \"The stories you've been writing\u2014they're not just stories. They're pieces of a larger truth, one that powerful people would do anything to keep hidden.\"\n\nA chill ran down my spine. \"What are you saying?\"\n\n\"I'm saying that you're in danger,\" she replied. \"You've uncovered too much, and there are those who would silence you to protect their secrets.\"\n\nThe weight of her words settled over me like a shroud. The dream that had seemed so tantalizingly close now felt like a trap, one that I had walked into willingly.\n\n\"I can help you disappear,\" Eleanor said, her voice softer now. \"But you have to leave everything behind\u2014your work, your life here. It's the only way to stay safe.\"\n\nI looked at her, the woman who had offered me an escape, now offering me another. The choice was stark: return to the cigarette booth, to a life of smoke and monotony, or vanish into the shadows, leaving behind the stories that had become my lifeline.\n\nIn the end, the decision was easier than I thought. I chose to disappear, to leave behind the city that had both trapped and inspired me. As I boarded the train that would take me far from Times Square, I realized that dreams were often more complicated than they seemed. They could lift you up, but they could also pull you into the depths. And sometimes, the cost of escape was a price too high to pay.\n\nBut I carried the stories with me, tucked away in the corners of my mind, waiting for the day when it would be safe to bring them into the light.",
        "story_b": "The cigarette booth was like a little island in the roaring chaos of Times Square. Every morning, I unlocked the metal grate, slipped inside, and was surrounded by impatient hands reaching for Marlboros, Camels, and the occasional pack of Lucky Strikes. The haze of tobacco smoke was a constant companion, curling up like a ghostly reminder of my own dreams drifting away.\n\n\u201cHey, kid!\u201d shouted a regular, Jimmy the Juggler, who\u2019d perfected tossing three apples while balancing on a single roller skate. \u201cGimme the usual and don\u2019t try to stiff me with those price hikes, yeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cJimmy,\u201d I grinned, leaning on the counter, \u201cyou know I don\u2019t set the prices. It\u2019s a conspiracy. Big Tobacco, Nixon, the works.\u201d\n\nHe chuckled, tipping his hat. \u201cFar out, man. Just keep my smokes under a buck, and we\u2019re golden.\u201d\n\nOur banter was a daily ritual, a small relief from the monotony. Jimmy had dreams too\u2014of making it big on stage, juggling flaming torches before adoring crowds. But here we were, in the heart of Times Square, surrounded by neon lights and the perpetual honking of taxis.\n\nThe booth was a fishbowl, offering a front-row seat to the theater of life. I\u2019d watch the street performers, the tourists with their cameras, the hustlers working their angles. Each customer told a story, whether they knew it or not.\n\nOne day, a lady with a feathered hat approached, her eyes scanning the display with determination. \u201cDo you have Chesterfields?\u201d\n\nI shook my head. \u201cHaven\u2019t had those in years, ma\u2019am. They went the way of the dodo.\u201d\n\nShe huffed, muttering about \u201cthe good old days,\u201d and walked off, leaving me in a cloud of nostalgia for a time I\u2019d never known.\n\nAs the day wore on, the crowd shifted from the lunchtime rush to the evening bustle. That\u2019s when Sam showed up. He was a regular, but today he seemed different\u2014like he was carrying news. He leaned against the booth, looking around as if he was about to share a secret.\n\n\u201cHey, kid, you wanna get outta this smoke box?\u201d he asked, lowering his voice conspiratorially.\n\nI raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Sam? You got a way out?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this gig,\u201d he said, scratching at his chin. \u201cNot your usual, but it\u2019s good money. An interview\u2019s happening tonight. Interested?\u201d\n\nI hesitated. Working the booth wasn\u2019t my dream, but it paid the rent. Still, the idea of something different tugged at me. \u201cWhat kind of gig?\u201d\n\nSam just grinned. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. Meet me at the corner of 42nd and Broadway at seven. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d\n\nAs he walked away, I felt a mix of excitement and unease. What could be better than selling smokes to impatient New Yorkers? Anything, I decided, locking up the booth with a newfound sense of possibility.\n\nThe evening air was electric, the neon lights casting a surreal glow over the bustling streets. I found Sam leaning against a lamppost, looking as if he belonged in a noir film.\n\n\u201cRight on time,\u201d he said, nodding approvingly. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nHe led me through the throngs, past the vendors selling pretzels and hot dogs, the street musicians playing tunes that echoed off the buildings. We stopped at a nondescript door sandwiched between a peep show and a pawn shop. Sam rapped twice, and the door swung open.\n\nInside, it was dimly lit, the room filled with a peculiar mix of people. The scent of incense hung heavy in the air. I followed Sam to a table where a man with a slicked-back hairdo sat, his fingers steepled like he was about to unveil a master plan.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d he said, his voice smooth as silk. \u201cI hear you\u2019re looking for a change.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m open to possibilities,\u201d I replied, trying to sound more confident than I felt.\n\nHe leaned forward, his eyes gleaming. \u201cThis is an opportunity to be part of something... unique. We need someone with your skills\u2014street smarts, quick thinking. You interested?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the catch?\u201d\n\nHe chuckled, a sound that made the hairs on my neck stand on end. \u201cNo catch, just commitment. The job\u2019s not for everyone, but it pays well.\u201d\n\nI glanced at Sam, who gave me a reassuring nod. My mind raced with the possibilities\u2014what was this job? Could it really be the escape I\u2019d been dreaming of, or was it too good to be true?\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, taking a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s smile widened. \u201cExcellent. You start tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAs Sam and I left the building, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of stepping into something larger than myself, a world beyond the cigarette booth. The city buzzed around us, alive with stories waiting to be told.\n\n\u201cThanks, Sam,\u201d I said, my voice a mixture of gratitude and curiosity.\n\n\u201cNo problem, kid,\u201d he replied, clapping me on the back. \u201cYou\u2019ve got potential. Just remember, keep your eyes open and your wits about you.\u201d\n\nAs I walked back to my tiny apartment, I felt the weight of the day lifting. The booth, Times Square, the constant haze of smoke\u2014they were still part of me, but now they were just the beginning of something new.\n\nThe next morning, I opened the booth for what might be the last time, greeting the usual parade of faces. Jimmy the Juggler stopped by, tossing his apples with practiced ease.\n\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s with the grin, kid? You win the lottery or something?\u201d\n\nI laughed, handing him his cigarettes. \u201cNah, just got a new gig. Something far out.\u201d\n\n\u201cGroovy,\u201d he said, winking. \u201cDon\u2019t forget us little people when you make it big.\u201d\n\nI promised I wouldn\u2019t, watching him roll away on his skate, juggling dreams in the air. As the day wore on, I packed up my things, feeling the familiar tug of the unknown.\n\nTimes Square was still a theater of life, and I was ready for my next act, whatever it might be. The cigarette booth had been my stage, but now the city was calling, and I couldn\u2019t wait to see where it would take me.",

He wanted women good with spreadsheets, not sheets, he said. I suspected otherwise, he treated us so nicely. A bonus every month of as many candy bars as you wanted, guaranteeing to stop pilfering he said, because of how sick it would make us. No one was hired who smoked, but the stench of tobacco was so strong in our clothes people asked us for a light on the subway home.\n\nI had an interview one afternoon for a new job that its ad said would pay better. Women only, for artistic purposes. It sounded, at the very least, less claustrophobic. Basil was annoyed. All that training he\u2019d given me going to waste on art? I didn\u2019t enumerate the three things I had learned from him: adding on a machine, smiling at the customer but not too much, and always stacking the bills faceup, from small to big.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if I have a contract, I said, tossing my half-eaten Mars bar out the car window, having found a delicate white worm in the center.\n\nCurious who would pay more for an untrained girl, he drove me to the interview, the paper bags already collected. It\u2019s the least I can do, he said, trying to sound terribly generous. That way I can return you back to your job with two weeks\u2019 notice.\n\nIt\u2019s just an interview, I said, as if his job meant everything.\n\nAre you looking to bargain for a higher wage?\n\nThe thought hadn\u2019t occurred to me, I said. Sure.\n\nHe was pulling up to the location. Well, you might have me over a barrel, he said, seeing money in exclamation marks all in the building. Sleek, of the newest architecture, it even had automatic elevators without a nosy operator, as I soon discovered once inside.\n\nI was ready for art.\n\nRoom 507 contained a man with a clipboard sitting on a folding chair and a camera on a stand. No one else waited to be seen. Hello, said the man, as impersonally as possible. No point in sitting down, he said.\n\nI\u2019ve been selling cigarettes, I said, as if it were a credential.\n\nThat\u2019s nice, he said, and tilted his head to look me over. I pay well, just like it says in the ad.\n\nArt? I asked, the ad out of my purse and in my hand.\n\nCommercial, he said, still eyeing me. Take off your clothes.\n\nDid I say, What? Did I say, Thanks anyway? I took off my clothes. After all, I\u2019d spent a semester drawing nudes. Though I didn\u2019t go so far as to pull my jeans past my knees. Surely he could get enough of an idea without that. I was already braless, and stood with my shirt half-untucked, hanging on my arm.\n\nHe was embarrassed for me. He waved his hand and said he\u2019d call. Put your number here, he said, pointing at his clipboard. He didn\u2019t even take a picture with his big camera.\n\nBasil had circled the block a few times but he was waiting. I got in.\n\nYou could use a drink, he said, glancing at me. There\u2019s a nice ladies\u2019 place uptown. He swung into traffic, away from Times Square.\n\nI don\u2019t drink, I said, and I have schoolwork.\n\nHe kept on driving. You girls are a dime a dozen, he said. It\u2019s amazing. Art, he said, shaking his head.\n\nI hopped out at the first stoplight.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The cigarette booth was a small, glass-walled cage in the heart of Times Square, a microcosm of the city's chaos and vibrancy. It was 1974, and the air was thick with the smell of tobacco and the chatter of impatient New Yorkers. I spent my days in a haze of smoke and noise, handing out packs of Marlboros and Camels to a never-ending stream of customers, their faces blurring into a single, insistent demand.\n\n\"Pack of Winstons,\" a man grunted, shoving a crumpled dollar bill through the slot. His eyes were bloodshot, his fingers yellowed with nicotine.\n\nI nodded, my fingers deftly retrieving the pack from the shelf behind me. The transaction was over in seconds, and he disappeared into the crowd, just another ghost in the city that never sleeps.\n\nI often wondered how I ended up here, in this tiny booth surrounded by glass and smoke. I had dreams once\u2014dreams of writing, of telling stories that mattered. But life had a way of narrowing possibilities, and now my world was no bigger than this booth, no brighter than the neon lights that flickered outside.\n\nOne rainy afternoon, as I watched the raindrops race down the glass, a woman approached the booth. She was different from the usual clientele\u2014her clothes were immaculate, her posture regal. She slid a business card through the slot with a practiced elegance.\n\n\"Are you interested in a job opportunity?\" she asked, her voice smooth and confident.\n\nI glanced at the card. It was plain, with only a name\u2014Eleanor Blackwood\u2014and a phone number printed in bold letters. The simplicity was almost intimidating.\n\n\"What kind of job?\" I asked, curiosity piqued.\n\n\"Something more suited to your talents,\" she replied cryptically. \"Call me if you're interested.\"\n\nAnd with that, she was gone, swallowed by the throng of pedestrians. I turned the card over in my fingers, the weight of it surprisingly heavy for such a small piece of paper. That night, after the booth was locked and the city had quieted to a dull roar, I dialed the number.\n\nEleanor answered on the first ring. \"Meet me at the Roosevelt Hotel tomorrow at noon,\" she said, and hung up before I could respond.\n\nThe next day, I found myself standing in the opulent lobby of the Roosevelt, feeling out of place in my worn jacket and scuffed shoes. Eleanor spotted me immediately and led me to a quiet corner of the hotel's bar.\n\n\"Thank you for coming,\" she said, her smile warm but inscrutable. \"I represent a group of individuals who have a keen interest in literature and the arts. We need someone with your skills to assist us.\"\n\nHer words were a lifeline, pulling me out of the suffocating routine of the cigarette booth. \"What exactly would I be doing?\" I asked, my heart pounding.\n\n\"Writing,\" she said simply. \"Researching, documenting. We have access to stories that need to be told, but we require a storyteller.\"\n\nIt sounded too good to be true. \"And what's the catch?\" I asked, wary of the ease with which she offered this escape.\n\nEleanor's smile faltered for the briefest moment. \"Discretion is paramount. Some of the work may involve sensitive material, things that cannot be shared with the public.\"\n\nI hesitated, the weight of the decision settling on my shoulders. But the promise of something more\u2014something meaningful\u2014was too strong to resist. \"I'm in,\" I said finally.\n\nThe weeks that followed were a whirlwind. I left the cigarette booth behind, diving headfirst into a world of clandestine meetings and whispered secrets. Eleanor introduced me to a network of writers, artists, and intellectuals, each with their own piece of the puzzle. My task was to weave these fragments into a coherent narrative, a tapestry of truth hidden beneath layers of deception.\n\nI thrived on the challenge, the thrill of uncovering hidden stories. But as the weeks turned into months, I began to notice the shadows lurking behind Eleanor's polished facade. There were meetings held in darkened rooms, conversations that stopped abruptly when I entered. The stories I was documenting grew darker, more dangerous.\n\nOne night, as I pored over a stack of documents, Eleanor appeared at my door. Her usual composure was replaced by a palpable tension. \"We need to talk,\" she said, her voice edged with urgency.\n\nShe led me to a secluded park, the city's noise muted by the thick foliage. \"You've done excellent work,\" she began, \"but there are forces at play that you don't fully understand.\"\n\nI frowned, confusion gnawing at me. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nEleanor sighed, her eyes searching mine. \"The stories you've been writing\u2014they're not just stories. They're pieces of a larger truth, one that powerful people would do anything to keep hidden.\"\n\nA chill ran down my spine. \"What are you saying?\"\n\n\"I'm saying that you're in danger,\" she replied. \"You've uncovered too much, and there are those who would silence you to protect their secrets.\"\n\nThe weight of her words settled over me like a shroud. The dream that had seemed so tantalizingly close now felt like a trap, one that I had walked into willingly.\n\n\"I can help you disappear,\" Eleanor said, her voice softer now. \"But you have to leave everything behind\u2014your work, your life here. It's the only way to stay safe.\"\n\nI looked at her, the woman who had offered me an escape, now offering me another. The choice was stark: return to the cigarette booth, to a life of smoke and monotony, or vanish into the shadows, leaving behind the stories that had become my lifeline.\n\nIn the end, the decision was easier than I thought. I chose to disappear, to leave behind the city that had both trapped and inspired me. As I boarded the train that would take me far from Times Square, I realized that dreams were often more complicated than they seemed. They could lift you up, but they could also pull you into the depths. And sometimes, the cost of escape was a price too high to pay.\n\nBut I carried the stories with me, tucked away in the corners of my mind, waiting for the day when it would be safe to bring them into the light.",
        "story_b": "The cigarette booth felt like the eye of a hurricane, a tiny island in a sea of chaos. Every day, I stood there surrounded by impatient hands thrusting crumpled bills at me, each transaction a brief but necessary interruption to their hurried lives. The neon signs flickered and buzzed above like electric fireflies, casting a sickly glow over the bustling crowd. It was the 1970s Times Square, alive with the perpetual hum of traffic and the ever-present smell of tobacco, the kind of place that held onto its secrets tightly.\n\nI\u2019d been working in the booth long enough to recognize the regulars by their orders. There was the man who bought two packs of Marlboros every morning, always with a nod and a polite \u201cKeep the change.\u201d The woman who preferred Virginia Slims, her fingers tapping impatiently on the counter. And then there was the teenager with his shy smile, trying not to make eye contact as he asked for a pack of Camels without a hint of stubble on his chin.\n\nEvery customer was a reminder of the monotony I longed to escape. As I handed a pack of Winstons to a middle-aged man in a faded trench coat, I caught myself daydreaming about the job interview scheduled for later that afternoon. The prospect of leaving the booth behind was exhilarating and terrifying in equal measure. It promised a change, a break from the routine that had come to define my existence, but what if it was just a different kind of trap?\n\nThe interview invitation had come unexpectedly, passed to me by a mysterious figure draped in shadows\u2014an eccentric dressed in a pinstripe suit that seemed a relic from a bygone era. \u201cMeet me at The Flickering Flame,\u201d he\u2019d said, his voice gravelly and conspiratorial, \u201c2 PM. Don\u2019t be late.\u201d It sounded more like a scene from a noir film than a legitimate job offer, but the allure of the unknown was too strong to resist.\n\nI spent the rest of the morning in a haze, mechanically repeating the motions of my job. The anticipation gnawed at me, each tick of the clock dragging me closer to the moment of decision. I wondered what kind of place The Flickering Flame would be, imagining a dimly lit backroom filled with smoke and whispers, where shadows danced along the walls.\n\nWhen the time came, I slipped out from the booth, the air outside a brisk slap against my skin. Times Square was its usual self, a cacophony of life, but I barely noticed as I navigated through the throng of people. The Flickering Flame was tucked away on a side street, its neon sign flickering just as its name promised, casting an eerie light over the entrance.\n\nInside, the air was thick with cigarette smoke and the scent of something herbal and strange. Eccentric characters populated the room\u2014some hunched over tables, others engaged in animated discussions that seemed to defy the need for secrecy. I was guided to a secluded corner by a woman with a knowing smile, her eyes twinkling with a hint of mischief.\n\nThe man from before was waiting, seated at a table cluttered with papers and an old-fashioned typewriter. \u201cYou made it,\u201d he said, motioning for me to sit. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d\n\nI took the offered seat, my heart a drumbeat of excitement and apprehension. \u201cWhat\u2019s this all about?\u201d I asked, my voice steady despite the whirlwind inside.\n\nHe leaned back, studying me with an intensity that was both unsettling and reassuring. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity,\u201d he said, his hands gesturing expansively. \u201cA chance to be part of something bigger than yourself.\u201d\n\nThe words hung in the air, charged with promise. I found myself leaning forward, caught by the idea of escape. \u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d\n\nHis smile widened, revealing teeth that were too perfect, too straight. \u201cIt\u2019s simple, really. You\u2019ll be our eyes and ears. A storyteller in the midst of the city, capturing the pulse of life here in Times Square.\u201d\n\nI blinked, the offer more surreal than I\u2019d anticipated. \u201cAnd what does that mean exactly?\u201d\n\nHis laughter was rich and warm, filling the space between us. \u201cIt means freedom, my friend. It means stepping out from that booth and into a world where every day is a new adventure.\u201d\n\nThe thought was intoxicating, the idea of leaving behind the cigarette booth, the impatient hands, the routine that had grown stale. But there was a catch, there always was. \u201cAnd the cost?\u201d\n\nHe shrugged, a casual elegance to the motion. \u201cOnly what you\u2019re willing to give. Your time, your perspective. Perhaps a little of your heart.\u201d\n\nThe words lingered, echoing in my mind. It was a gamble, a leap into the unknown, but wasn\u2019t that what I\u2019d been dreaming of? The chance to be more than just a fixture in a booth, to tell stories, to live stories.\n\nI glanced around the room, at the people and their stories, their lives intersecting in ways I\u2019d never imagined. The choice was clear, the pull of the unknown too strong to resist.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d I said, the decision lifting a weight I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d been carrying.\n\nThe man nodded, his expression one of satisfaction. \u201cWelcome to the team.\u201d\n\nAs I left The Flickering Flame, the sun setting on Times Square, I felt the thrill of possibility coursing through me. The cigarette booth was behind me now, and ahead lay a horizon filled with stories waiting to be told. I stepped into the night, ready to embrace whatever the future held, the uncertainty no longer a burden but a promise of something more.",

        "ground_truth": "I could extend both arms inside my cubicle, if you included the window slot that I delivered the cigarettes through. Candy too but mostly cigarettes bought in some Southern state near the tobacco fields and smuggled over state lines for cheap. Basil didn\u2019t do the smuggling. Balding, bellicose, and most of the time beaming, the closest he came to clandestine was using a paper bag to hold the take, reasoning that carrying a zippered cash purse had dollar signs all over it, and his bag said \u201cLunch.\u201d\n\nI was not eating lunch in those days, too expensive, maybe a Mars bar that I had to report. Lunch also took time away from slapping packs into the hands forever sticking themselves through the slot, something I did almost maternally rather than for money, given that the job paid maybe five bucks an hour. Again and again those hands beseeched, wriggling their impatient, addicted fingers. I worked in Times Square, long before the area was covered with moving images rather than the lurid static. Businessmen, not just the down-and-outs, were customers, men slumming for pleasure, starting with nicotine. It never occurred to me that I was being sold too, standing inside my glass-fronted box. Wearing peasant skirts and long-sleeved tops, without makeup, not even lipstick, I represented less the gateway drug of nicotine than the loss leader, virtue. How could the peep shows be so bad if she was here?\n\nI didn\u2019t see myself as part of what there was to see at all, I saw only the hands coming in through the slot with their clutched cash, sometimes wanting whole cartons, some just matches. Seldom did I have time to exchange any semblance of talk through the glass, what had been touted by Basil as bulletproof\u2014as reassurance, not to scare me\u2014but what was surely only thick Plexiglass, old and scratched. He hired me as soon as he heard I was going to Columbia. He said only girls from the finest institutions (emphasis on the syllable tu) can add. Few can these days, grumbled Basil, grabbing the paper bag with my calculations stapled to its fold.\n\nWhen my shift ended midafternoon\u2014and it often did, since Times Square attracted early risers and late-goers, people who needed cigarettes far more than coffee or the light of day\u2014Basil would take me along in his old station wagon to have me collect the paper bags from other cubicles. Who would imagine a girl could have so much cash? I didn\u2019t know about the Mafia and its stranglehold on his faux importation of tobacco, how Basil must have paid them off or been part of it.\n\nSince it was too much trouble to unlatch the so-called bulletproof window, the girls in the other cubicles stuffed their bags through the slots, girls grateful for the three-minute break of hello-how-are-you, sitting on stools like mine in an equally tiny space, surrounded by merchandise stretching far up to the ceiling and a space heater at their feet that threatened to turn it all into smoke.

        "story_b": "The cigarette booth was my own personal purgatory, a cramped box perched on the edge of Times Square where a haze of tobacco smoke mingled with the relentless pulse of neon lights. The air was thick with impatience, punctuated by the rhythmic rattle of coins and the clatter of the cash register. \"You wouldn't believe the things I hear in this booth,\" I'd often say to my regulars, a motley crew of impatient New Yorkers, each with their own peculiar tales to tell.\n\nOne of those regulars, a wiry man named Lou with a penchant for conspiracy theories, leaned in one day with a whisper. \"Heard there's a job going, something big,\" he said, eyes darting around as if he expected the pigeons to be wearing wiretaps. \"Somewhere up there,\" he nodded toward the glittering skyscrapers, \"where they need someone sharp, someone who knows their way around the city.\"\n\nI chuckled, brushing off Lou's usual banter. \"Sure, Lou, and maybe they need me to take down the government too.\"\n\nBut his words lingered as the day wore on, merging with the cacophony of honking taxis and the droning chatter of tourists. What would it be like to leave this booth and find something\u2014anything\u2014more?\n\nLater, as the sun dipped behind the concrete giants, a figure approached, distinct from the parade of customers. He was tall, with a tailored suit that seemed out of place among the polyester and denim. He paused before my booth, looking me over with an inscrutable expression. \"You ever think about a change of scene?\" he asked, his voice smooth like a late-night radio host.\n\nI arched an eyebrow, curiosity piqued. \"Every day. What are you selling?\"\n\n\"Not selling,\" he replied, pulling a sleek card from his pocket and sliding it across the counter. \"Offering. We could use someone like you.\"\n\nThe card read simply: Harper & Co. with an address in an unassuming part of town. It looked legitimate enough, but there was an air of mystery, a glint in his eye that suggested something more.\n\n\"What's the job?\" I asked, trying to keep my tone casual, though my heart was already racing with the potential for escape.\n\nHe only smiled, enigmatic. \"Come find out. Tomorrow at noon. Wear something sharp.\"\n\nAs he disappeared into the crowd, I stood there, card in hand, the booth suddenly feeling more claustrophobic than ever. Was this the opportunity I\u2019d been waiting for, or just another Times Square hustle?\n\nThe next day, I found myself standing before a nondescript door, the kind you'd pass a hundred times without noticing. The office behind it was unexpectedly lavish\u2014dark wood paneling, plush carpets, and eccentric decor that included an ornate chandelier and a massive, ticking grandfather clock. It was as if I'd stepped into another world, far removed from the gritty streets of the Square.\n\nA woman with cat-eye glasses and a severe bun ushered me into an inner office. \"Mr. Harper will see you now,\" she said, her voice clipped, efficient.\n\nMr. Harper sat behind a desk that seemed to stretch for miles, his fingers steepled as he studied me. \"You\u2019ve been working that booth for what, a decade?\" he asked.\n\n\"Feels like it,\" I admitted, half expecting him to pull out a file detailing every cigarette I\u2019d ever sold.\n\n\"We need someone who understands people, the city,\" he continued, his words carefully measured. \"Someone who can blend in, observe, and report back.\"\n\n\"Sounds like espionage,\" I joked, though the thought of being a spy added a certain thrill. \"What exactly is this job?\"\n\nHe offered a cryptic smile. \"Let's just say it involves discretion and a certain flair for the unexpected.\"\n\nThe interview was surreal, a dance of vague promises and unspoken possibilities. As I left, my mind was a whirl of questions, my usual cynicism battling the allure of something new. Was this my ticket out, or a path to something I couldn\u2019t yet fathom?\n\nBack in the booth, the world seemed to close in again, the familiar chaos of Times Square a stark contrast to the elegant mystery of Harper & Co. I served the usual parade of customers, their stories and complaints a comforting routine. Yet, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that the city was whispering secrets, urging me to take a leap.\n\n\"Well, did you find out what they want?\" Lou asked, his curiosity barely contained.\n\n\"Not yet,\" I replied, handing him his change. \"But it sure beats selling smokes.\"\n\n\"You think it\u2019s legit?\" he pressed, eyes bright with the thrill of a potential conspiracy.\n\nI shrugged, the weight of the decision settling on my shoulders. \"Could be a whole new world, Lou. Or just another hustle.\"\n\nAs the city buzzed around me, I stood at the booth, the card from Harper & Co. tucked safely in my pocket. The decision lay before me, a tantalizing mix of fear and excitement. The familiar chaos of Times Square was both a comfort and a cage, each flashing light a reminder of the life I knew and the unknown that beckoned.\n\nAnd so I stood, surrounded by the haze of tobacco, the clamor of impatient hands, dreaming of something more. The choice was mine, the city a vast, unpredictable sea of possibilities.",

But again, that was also part of Grok's personality - he was, indeed, a monster full of muscles, and could break all the bones of your body with just his pinkie, but he was also fun, a jokster, and while simple-minded, everybody at the party loved him.\n\nThat six months in the magic school of Tuslain gave a bunch of new funny things for Grok to do. He started with \"I CAST IRON\", screaming at the top of his lungs, just before smacking someone in his head. Then it became \"I CAST FIRE!\" and him throwing flaming, hot stones soaked in burning oil. Everybody laughed from his jokes...\n\n... until that day.\n\nAmbushed, the party fought as much as they could. But they lost, and Grok was almost unconscious, the ranger was hiding trying to find a way to save his friends, and the sorcerer was unconscious - the only one who could save everybody with some mass cure, and maybe that's exactly why he was targeted first. The cleric and the rogue where nowhere to be seen.\n\nLyla, the fighter, came to her party's camp too late, and she could see the bandits cicling around, trying to find her and the ranger. Luckily, she was able to sneak close to Grok, but she could see he was in a very bad condition - probably poisoned. She tried a telepathic spell, one she learned from an old magician, to communicate with her party. Grok tried to focus his eyes, and just said:\n\n\\- \"My focus. Need it. Also pink flower. Put in it\".\n\n\\- \"Grok, it's not time for that, we need to...\"\n\n\\- \"Need it. Trust Grok. Grok knows what Grok is doing\".\n\nLyla could not believe she was hearing that. Maybe Grok wasn't trying to be funny, he was, indeed, dumber than everybody though he was. Still, she could not waste time - she did give him his skillet, helped Grok to his feet, just as they were ambushed by two bandits - nothing Lyla couldn't handle, but Grok was still rummaging whatever was close to they, seaching for the damn pink flower.\n\nThe bandits, on the other hand, knew how to fight dirty. They did attack, but always targeting Grok, and Lyla as forced to take three arrows to her armor, one indeed piercing her arm, just to protect her friend. Until she heard the words:\n\n\\- \"I CAST WATER!\"\n\nShe looked at Grok, while he was just throwing water filled with flowers to the air, and the moment she opened her mouth to scream to him, so he could do something useful instead of daydreaming about being a wizard...\n\n... it started to rain.\n\nThe arrow dropped for Lyla's skin, the bruise nowhere to be seen. Grok was back on his feet, blinking to his friend, and with his \"battle weapon\" in hand, \"casted iron\" to the two bandits, who fell in the ground immediately.\n\nMoments later, the Rogue and the Sorcerer were at her side, cured from whatever the bandits did with them, and ready to battle, as if they were never even hurt in the first place. But the fight was quick and uneventful - for it was still raining, and the rain cured whatever attack each of them suffered. Screams were heard from the forest, when the Ranger took care of everyone that was still hiding, and the cleric appeared with other bandits tied to some magic binding, looking refreshed as if she had a good night's sleep in a four-star hotel after a good SPA session.\n\n\\- \"Grok... what did...\"\n\n\\- \"Sorry, Grok need sleep. Too tired, magic too dificulty. Ah... one thing. Important thing Grok needs!\"\n\n\\- \"Sure, whatever you want, please, tell us!\"\n\n\\- \"Grok wants fish. Can fish something and ask Ranger to cook for Grok? Tasty!\" - and in seconds, he was sleeping.\n\nThe party looked at each other, confused. It was a known fact that one needed intelligence to cast spells. The higher the intelligence, the stronger the spell. A \"mass cure\" was just possible by the highest academics of Tuslain's Magic School, and a \"mass cure and remove poison\" was essentially unheard of, being attributed to the grand mages of the past, almost a legend.\n\nSo... what the hell happened?",
        "story_a": "\"Uhh, why is the barbarian holding a skillet?\" whispered Thalia, her eyes fixed on the towering figure at the campfire.\n\n\"Oh, he thinks he's a wizard, and that skillet is the focus for his spells, like a wand,\" replied Eldric, the party's rogue, stifling a chuckle. \n\n\"Wait, he has spells?\" Thalia asked, her curiosity piqued.\n\n\"Just one spell. Except, it's really just him smacking someone in the head while shouting 'I CAST IRON!!' It's actually rather comical.\"\n\nThalia couldn't help but laugh softly, glancing over at the barbarian, Grom, who was now using the skillet to cook up a hearty stew. The firelight danced off his muscle-bound frame, casting shadows that made him look even more imposing. Yet, there was a certain innocence to his movements, a childlike belief in his own magical prowess.\n\n\"Come, sit,\" Grom called out, his voice a deep rumble that resonated through the clearing. \"Stew is almost ready.\"\n\nThalia and Eldric joined him, sitting on the logs arranged around the fire. Grom served them each a generous helping of the stew, the aroma of spices and meat filling the air. As they ate, Thalia couldn't help but wonder how a barbarian had come to believe he was a wizard.\n\n\"Grom,\" she began, \"why do you think that skillet is magical?\"\n\nGrom looked up, his face lighting up with a broad grin. \"Ah, it is a tale of destiny and adventure!\" He leaned in, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \"I found this skillet in the ruins of an ancient castle. It called to me, whispered secrets of power and strength. When I first held it, I felt its magic flow through me, and I knew it was my destiny to wield it as my focus.\"\n\nEldric snorted, earning a glare from Thalia. \"And what about your spell?\" she asked, genuinely curious.\n\nGrom's eyes sparkled with excitement. \"The spell was revealed to me in a dream. A great wizard appeared and taught me the incantation. 'I CAST IRON!!' he shouted, and I knew it was a spell of great power.\"\n\nThalia couldn't suppress her smile. \"And does it work?\"\n\nGrom puffed out his chest, clearly proud. \"Oh, yes! Many foes have felt the wrath of my skillet. They fall before me, defeated by my mighty magic.\"\n\nEldric rolled his eyes but kept silent, shoveling another spoonful of stew into his mouth.\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the sound of rustling in the bushes. Instinctively, the trio reached for their weapons. From the shadows emerged a group of bandits, their leader stepping forward with a sneer.\n\n\"Well, well, what do we have here?\" the leader taunted, his eyes gleaming with malice. \"A pretty little group for us to rob.\"\n\nThalia stood, her hand on her sword. Eldric melted into the shadows, ready to strike. Grom, however, brandished his skillet with a grin.\n\n\"You face Grom the Great Wizard!\" he bellowed. \"Prepare to feel the power of my spell!\"\n\nThe bandits laughed, the leader shaking his head in disbelief. \"A wizard with a skillet? This should be good.\"\n\nGrom's eyes narrowed, and he took a deep breath. \"I CAST IRON!!\" he roared, swinging the skillet with all his might. The leader's smirk vanished as the heavy iron collided with his head, dropping him to the ground in an instant.\n\nThe other bandits hesitated, stunned by the sudden turn of events. Thalia took advantage of their confusion, drawing her sword and charging. Eldric appeared from the shadows, his daggers flashing in the firelight. Together, they made quick work of the remaining bandits.\n\nAs the last of the attackers fled into the night, Thalia turned to Grom, who was standing triumphantly over the unconscious leader. She couldn't help but laugh, shaking her head in amazement.\n\n\"Well, Grom,\" she said, wiping her sword clean, \"I think your spell worked.\"\n\nGrom beamed with pride, hoisting the skillet high. \"Indeed! The power of the skillet is unmatched!\"\n\nEldric emerged from the shadows, a rare smile on his face. \"Maybe there's more to your magic than we thought.\"\n\nAs they settled back around the campfire, the trio shared a newfound respect for their unconventional companion. And while Grom's spell might not have been real, his belief in it had made all the difference. In the end, perhaps that was the greatest magic of all.",
        "story_b": "Chaos reigned in the village of Eldergrove. Once a beacon of harmony, the place now bore the scars of societal breakdown. Smoke billowed from crumbling huts, and the air was thick with the cries of the desperate. Traditional roles had been upended; warriors and craftsmen alike fought for scraps, while the once-revered council of elders had disbanded, leaving anarchy in their wake.\n\nAmong the chaos stood Tharn, the barbarian, clutching his prized skillet. His comrades, battered and weary, gathered around a fire, casting wary glances at their unconventional companion. The skillet was an artifact he\u2019d found years ago, buried beneath the ruins of an ancient temple. Tharn believed it granted him wizard-like abilities, a notion that the villagers had initially laughed off but now humored, if only for the sake of their morale.\n\n\u201cUhh, why is the barbarian holding a skillet?\u201d a newcomer asked, eyes wide with confusion.\n\n\u201cOh, he thinks he\u2019s a wizard, and that skillet is the focus for his spells, like a wand,\u201d replied Garret, the group's cynical archer.\n\n\u201cHe has spells?\u201d the newcomer pressed, incredulous.\n\n\u201cJust one spell. Except, it\u2019s really just him smacking someone in the head while shouting \u2018I CAST IRON!!\u2019 It\u2019s actually rather comical.\u201d\n\nDespite the absurdity, Tharn\u2019s belief in his skillet\u2019s powers was unwavering. He\u2019d been a brute all his life, respected for his strength but never for his intellect. The skillet had become a symbol of his desire to be more than just a muscle-bound warrior, to earn respect and recognition from his peers. It was a delusion, but one that gave him purpose.\n\nThe village had been besieged by raiders for weeks, and supplies were running low. Tharn\u2019s comrades debated their next move, their voices tinged with despair.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep this up,\u201d Garret muttered, glancing at Tharn. \u201cWe need a miracle.\u201d\n\nTharn\u2019s grip tightened on the skillet. \u201cI have a plan,\u201d he announced, his voice steady.\n\nThe others turned to him, a mix of skepticism and hope in their eyes. Tharn had always been the muscle, never the strategist. Yet, something in his demeanor commanded their attention.\n\n\u201cWe lure the raiders into the square,\u201d Tharn explained. \u201cThen, I\u2019ll use my spell to take out their leader. Without him, they\u2019ll scatter.\u201d\n\nGarret raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou really think your skillet can win this fight?\u201d\n\nTharn\u2019s gaze was unwavering. \u201cI know it can.\u201d\n\nThe plan was risky, but desperation left little room for alternatives. As night fell, they set their trap. Villagers hid in the shadows, weapons at the ready, while Tharn stood in the center of the square, skillet in hand.\n\nThe raiders arrived, their leader striding forward with a sneer. \u201cSurrender now, and we might let you live,\u201d he taunted.\n\nTharn stepped forward, raising the skillet high. \u201cI cast iron!\u201d he bellowed, charging at the leader.\n\nThe confrontation was swift and brutal. Tharn swung the skillet with all his might, the clang of metal against skull echoing through the square. The leader crumpled to the ground, unconscious. The raiders, stunned by the unexpected attack, hesitated.\n\n\u201cNow!\u201d Garret shouted, and the villagers sprang from their hiding places, overwhelming the raiders in a flurry of blades and arrows.\n\nThe battle was over in minutes. The raiders fled, their morale shattered without their leader. Tharn stood in the center of the square, skillet still in hand, breathing heavily. His comrades gathered around him, their expressions a mix of awe and relief.\n\n\u201cYou did it,\u201d Garret said, clapping Tharn on the back. \u201cYou actually did it.\u201d\n\nTharn nodded, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. For the first time, he felt more than just a brute. He felt like a hero.\n\nAs the villagers celebrated their victory, Tharn retreated to a quiet corner, the weight of his actions settling upon him. The skillet, once a symbol of his delusion, had become a tool of salvation. But the battle had also revealed a harsh truth: his belief in magic was a fragile shield against the brutal reality of their world.\n\nHe gazed at the skillet, the dents and scratches telling the story of countless battles. It was just a piece of metal, yet it had given him hope. Tharn knew he couldn't abandon the delusion entirely, not yet. It was part of who he was, a thread woven into the fabric of his identity.\n\nBut as he looked out over the village, now safe for the moment, Tharn resolved to be more than just a man with a skillet. He would be a protector, a leader, and perhaps, in time, he would find true magic within himself.",

        "story_b": "The tavern buzzed with the usual evening energy\u2014laughter, clinking mugs, and the occasional outburst of a bard's latest tune. But tonight, an unusual spectacle drew everyone's attention to the center of the room. There stood Rognar the Barbarian, all muscle and bravado, clutching a well-seasoned skillet in his meaty hand.\n\n\"Gather 'round, good people!\" Rognar bellowed, his voice echoing off the wooden beams. \"Prepare to witness magic the likes of which you have never seen!\"\n\nAt one of the tables, a group of adventurers exchanged amused glances. \"Uhh, why is the barbarian holding a skillet?\" asked Elara, a curious elf with a penchant for sarcasm.\n\n\"Oh, he thinks he's a wizard, and that skillet is the focus for his spells, like a wand,\" replied Thalion, the group's ranger, shaking his head with a chuckle.\n\nElara's eyes widened in disbelief. \"He has spells?\"\n\n\"Just one spell. Except, it\u2019s really just him smacking someone in the head while shouting \u2018I CAST IRON!\u2019 It\u2019s actually rather comical.\"\n\nAs if on cue, Rognar approached a mock duel with an unsuspecting patron, raising his skillet high. \"Behold!\" he cried, swinging it down with theatrical flair. \"I CAST IRON!!\"\n\nThe patron, already a few ales deep, swayed slightly before the skillet made contact, a dull 'clang' ringing out, followed by uproarious laughter. The patron's eyes crossed comically, and he slumped to the floor, more from the ale than the skillet's impact.\n\nThe tavern erupted in applause and cheers, coins clinking as they were tossed towards Rognar in appreciation of his performance. He bowed deeply, clearly enjoying the attention, his face a mask of earnest pride.\n\nLater, as the festivities continued, the adventurers found themselves at a table with the self-proclaimed wizard. \"Rognar, why the skillet?\" asked Elara, curiosity piqued.\n\nRognar leaned in conspiratorially, his eyes twinkling with mischief. \"Ah, you see, it is not just any skillet. It is the Skillet of Searing Sorcery! Passed down through generations of my clan. Its power is unmatched in the culinary and arcane arts.\"\n\nThalion snorted into his drink. \"And what about that ladle you carry? Does it scry soup?\"\n\nRognar nodded earnestly. \"Indeed! The Ladle of Liquid Luminescence. With it, I see visions of great feasts and impending hunger.\"\n\nThe group laughed, enjoying the barbarian's enthusiasm and the absurdity of his beliefs. Yet, as the night wore on, they couldn't deny that there was something endearing about Rognar's conviction.\n\nThe following day, the adventurers, now joined by Rognar, ventured into the mystical forest bordering the town. They were on the hunt for the rumored Bandit King, whose antics had troubled the local villagers for weeks. As they trekked deeper into the forest, the atmosphere shifted, the air tingling with the promise of adventure.\n\nSuddenly, a group of bandits leaped from the shadows, brandishing swords and daggers. The adventurers sprang into action, Elara deftly firing arrows, Thalion swinging his twin blades. Rognar, skillet in hand, charged forward with a bellow.\n\nHe swung the skillet with gusto. \"I CAST IRON!!\" The skillet connected with a bandit's head, sending him sprawling into a heap of leaves. Another bandit, momentarily distracted by the bizarre scene, found himself knocked out cold by a flying ladle.\n\nAmidst the chaos, a peculiar thing happened. The forest seemed to respond to Rognar's cries, vines twisting and tangling around the bandits' feet, tripping them up in a comical dance of surprise. Whether it was true magic or sheer luck, the adventurers couldn't deny the effectiveness of Rognar's unorthodox approach.\n\nBy the battle's end, the bandits lay defeated, and the forest was once again peaceful. As the group regrouped, breathing heavily but victorious, they turned to Rognar, who stood triumphantly with his skillet held high.\n\n\"Rognar,\" Thalion said, clapping him on the shoulder, \"you may not be a wizard, but you certainly cast a spell of chaos like no other.\"\n\nRognar beamed, his grin wide and infectious. \"Perhaps, my friends, there is magic in the skillet after all.\"\n\nWith a newfound camaraderie and acceptance, the adventurers continued their journey, knowing that while Rognar might not wield true magic, his unique brand of sorcery was something special indeed.",

        "ground_truth": "And indeed, it was comical. But again, that was also part of Grok's personality - he was, indeed, a monster full of muscles, and could break all the bones of your body with just his pinkie, but he was also fun, a jokster, and while simple-minded, everybody at the party loved him.\n\nThat six months in the magic school of Tuslain gave a bunch of new funny things for Grok to do. He started with \"I CAST IRON\", screaming at the top of his lungs, just before smacking someone in his head. Then it became \"I CAST FIRE!\" and him throwing flaming, hot stones soaked in burning oil. Everybody laughed from his jokes...\n\n... until that day.\n\nAmbushed, the party fought as much as they could. But they lost, and Grok was almost unconscious, the ranger was hiding trying to find a way to save his friends, and the sorcerer was unconscious - the only one who could save everybody with some mass cure, and maybe that's exactly why he was targeted first. The cleric and the rogue where nowhere to be seen.\n\nLyla, the fighter, came to her party's camp too late, and she could see the bandits cicling around, trying to find her and the ranger. Luckily, she was able to sneak close to Grok, but she could see he was in a very bad condition - probably poisoned. She tried a telepathic spell, one she learned from an old magician, to communicate with her party. Grok tried to focus his eyes, and just said:\n\n\\- \"My focus. Need it. Also pink flower. Put in it\".\n\n\\- \"Grok, it's not time for that, we need to...\"\n\n\\- \"Need it. Trust Grok. Grok knows what Grok is doing\".\n\nLyla could not believe she was hearing that. Maybe Grok wasn't trying to be funny, he was, indeed, dumber than everybody though he was. Still, she could not waste time - she did give him his skillet, helped Grok to his feet, just as they were ambushed by two bandits - nothing Lyla couldn't handle, but Grok was still rummaging whatever was close to they, seaching for the damn pink flower.\n\nThe bandits, on the other hand, knew how to fight dirty. They did attack, but always targeting Grok, and Lyla as forced to take three arrows to her armor, one indeed piercing her arm, just to protect her friend. Until she heard the words:\n\n\\- \"I CAST WATER!\"\n\nShe looked at Grok, while he was just throwing water filled with flowers to the air, and the moment she opened her mouth to scream to him, so he could do something useful instead of daydreaming about being a wizard...\n\n... it started to rain.\n\nThe arrow dropped for Lyla's skin, the bruise nowhere to be seen. Grok was back on his feet, blinking to his friend, and with his \"battle weapon\" in hand, \"casted iron\" to the two bandits, who fell in the ground immediately.\n\nMoments later, the Rogue and the Sorcerer were at her side, cured from whatever the bandits did with them, and ready to battle, as if they were never even hurt in the first place. But the fight was quick and uneventful - for it was still raining, and the rain cured whatever attack each of them suffered. Screams were heard from the forest, when the Ranger took care of everyone that was still hiding, and the cleric appeared with other bandits tied to some magic binding, looking refreshed as if she had a good night's sleep in a four-star hotel after a good SPA session.\n\n\\- \"Grok... what did...\"\n\n\\- \"Sorry, Grok need sleep. Too tired, magic too dificulty. Ah... one thing. Important thing Grok needs!\"\n\n\\- \"Sure, whatever you want, please, tell us!\"\n\n\\- \"Grok wants fish. Can fish something and ask Ranger to cook for Grok? Tasty!\" - and in seconds, he was sleeping.\n\nThe party looked at each other, confused. It was a known fact that one needed intelligence to cast spells. The higher the intelligence, the stronger the spell. A \"mass cure\" was just possible by the highest academics of Tuslain's Magic School, and a \"mass cure and remove poison\" was essentially unheard of, being attributed to the grand mages of the past, almost a legend.\n\nSo... what the hell happened?",
        "story_a": "\"Uhh, why is the barbarian holding a skillet?\" whispered Thalia, her eyes fixed on the towering figure at the campfire.\n\n\"Oh, he thinks he's a wizard, and that skillet is the focus for his spells, like a wand,\" replied Eldric, the party's rogue, stifling a chuckle. \n\n\"Wait, he has spells?\" Thalia asked, her curiosity piqued.\n\n\"Just one spell. Except, it's really just him smacking someone in the head while shouting 'I CAST IRON!!' It's actually rather comical.\"\n\nThalia couldn't help but laugh softly, glancing over at the barbarian, Grom, who was now using the skillet to cook up a hearty stew. The firelight danced off his muscle-bound frame, casting shadows that made him look even more imposing. Yet, there was a certain innocence to his movements, a childlike belief in his own magical prowess.\n\n\"Come, sit,\" Grom called out, his voice a deep rumble that resonated through the clearing. \"Stew is almost ready.\"\n\nThalia and Eldric joined him, sitting on the logs arranged around the fire. Grom served them each a generous helping of the stew, the aroma of spices and meat filling the air. As they ate, Thalia couldn't help but wonder how a barbarian had come to believe he was a wizard.\n\n\"Grom,\" she began, \"why do you think that skillet is magical?\"\n\nGrom looked up, his face lighting up with a broad grin. \"Ah, it is a tale of destiny and adventure!\" He leaned in, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \"I found this skillet in the ruins of an ancient castle. It called to me, whispered secrets of power and strength. When I first held it, I felt its magic flow through me, and I knew it was my destiny to wield it as my focus.\"\n\nEldric snorted, earning a glare from Thalia. \"And what about your spell?\" she asked, genuinely curious.\n\nGrom's eyes sparkled with excitement. \"The spell was revealed to me in a dream. A great wizard appeared and taught me the incantation. 'I CAST IRON!!' he shouted, and I knew it was a spell of great power.\"\n\nThalia couldn't suppress her smile. \"And does it work?\"\n\nGrom puffed out his chest, clearly proud. \"Oh, yes! Many foes have felt the wrath of my skillet. They fall before me, defeated by my mighty magic.\"\n\nEldric rolled his eyes but kept silent, shoveling another spoonful of stew into his mouth.\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the sound of rustling in the bushes. Instinctively, the trio reached for their weapons. From the shadows emerged a group of bandits, their leader stepping forward with a sneer.\n\n\"Well, well, what do we have here?\" the leader taunted, his eyes gleaming with malice. \"A pretty little group for us to rob.\"\n\nThalia stood, her hand on her sword. Eldric melted into the shadows, ready to strike. Grom, however, brandished his skillet with a grin.\n\n\"You face Grom the Great Wizard!\" he bellowed. \"Prepare to feel the power of my spell!\"\n\nThe bandits laughed, the leader shaking his head in disbelief. \"A wizard with a skillet? This should be good.\"\n\nGrom's eyes narrowed, and he took a deep breath. \"I CAST IRON!!\" he roared, swinging the skillet with all his might. The leader's smirk vanished as the heavy iron collided with his head, dropping him to the ground in an instant.\n\nThe other bandits hesitated, stunned by the sudden turn of events. Thalia took advantage of their confusion, drawing her sword and charging. Eldric appeared from the shadows, his daggers flashing in the firelight. Together, they made quick work of the remaining bandits.\n\nAs the last of the attackers fled into the night, Thalia turned to Grom, who was standing triumphantly over the unconscious leader. She couldn't help but laugh, shaking her head in amazement.\n\n\"Well, Grom,\" she said, wiping her sword clean, \"I think your spell worked.\"\n\nGrom beamed with pride, hoisting the skillet high. \"Indeed! The power of the skillet is unmatched!\"\n\nEldric emerged from the shadows, a rare smile on his face. \"Maybe there's more to your magic than we thought.\"\n\nAs they settled back around the campfire, the trio shared a newfound respect for their unconventional companion. And while Grom's spell might not have been real, his belief in it had made all the difference. In the end, perhaps that was the greatest magic of all.",
        "story_b": "\u201cUhh, why is the barbarian holding a skillet?\u201d Aric asked, eyebrow raised.\n\n\u201cOh, he thinks he\u2019s a wizard, and that skillet is the focus for his spells, like a wand,\u201d replied Talia, her voice tinged with both amusement and concern.\n\n\u201cHe has spells?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust one spell. Except, it\u2019s really just him smacking someone in the head while shouting \u2018I CAST IRON!!\u2019 It\u2019s actually rather comical.\u201d\n\nThe group huddled around the campfire, their shadows dancing on the walls of the ruined city. The air was thick with the acrid scent of burning debris, a constant reminder of the world's decay. Magic had once been a beacon of hope, a tool for rebuilding. But now, under the oppressive rule of the Magisterium, it was tightly controlled, stifling any form of resistance.\n\nIn the distance, the barbarian, known as Thorgar, stood apart from the others. His massive frame was silhouetted against the dying light, the skillet hanging from his belt like a talisman. He stared at it, brow furrowed, as if willing it to reveal its secrets.\n\nThorgar's belief in his magical abilities had become a source of internal conflict. He could hear the mocking voices of his past, whispering doubts into his mind.\n\n_\"You're no wizard, just a fool with a frying pan.\"_\n\n_\"You\u2019ll never be more than a brute, swinging metal like an idiot.\"_\n\nBut there was another voice, faint yet persistent, urging him to believe. It came from a note he had found months ago, tucked into the waistband of his tattered trousers. The note, scrawled in his own handwriting, read:\n\n> \"Believe in the skillet. It holds the power you seek. Trust yourself, Thorgar. You are more than they think.\"\n\nHe glanced at the note once more, the words a lifeline in his sea of self-doubt. The skillet was his focus, his connection to a power that defied the Magisterium's rigid definitions. It was his rebellion against their control.\n\nThe group's mission was simple: infiltrate the Magisterium's stronghold and retrieve the Codex of Aether, a tome rumored to hold the secrets of unrestricted magic. Thorgar's role was less clear. He was a wildcard, a chaotic element in their meticulously planned operation.\n\nAs they approached the fortress, the air grew colder, the oppressive weight of the Magisterium's wards pressing down on them. Thorgar's grip tightened on the skillet, his heart pounding in his chest. The others moved with silent precision, their advanced spells and enchanted weapons at the ready.\n\nSuddenly, a patrol of armored sentinels emerged from the shadows, their eyes glowing with arcane energy. The group tensed, ready to unleash their sophisticated arsenal. But Thorgar stepped forward, skillet raised high.\n\n\u201cI CAST IRON!!\u201d he bellowed, his voice echoing through the night.\n\nThe skillet connected with a resounding clang, sending the first sentinel crumpling to the ground. The others hesitated, their confusion palpable. Thorgar moved with surprising speed, each swing of the skillet a brutal symphony of chaos. The advanced spells and weapons of his companions seemed almost redundant in the face of his raw, unorthodox power.\n\nAs the last sentinel fell, Thorgar stood panting, the skillet slick with sweat and blood. His companions stared in stunned silence, their disbelief slowly giving way to grudging respect.\n\nAric broke the silence, his voice tinged with awe. \u201cThat... that was incredible.\u201d\n\nTalia nodded, her eyes wide. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s more to your \u2018spell\u2019 than we thought.\u201d\n\nBut Thorgar\u2019s triumph was bittersweet. The voices of doubt still lingered, gnawing at the edges of his mind. Was he truly a wizard, or just a delusional barbarian wielding a cooking utensil?\n\nInside the fortress, the group found the Codex of Aether. As they pored over its pages, Thorgar felt a strange resonance with the ancient text. It spoke of magic as an extension of will, not bound by wands or incantations, but by belief and intent.\n\nThe group's success was a testament to Thorgar's unconventional methods, but it also highlighted the unresolved tensions within their ranks. The Magisterium's grip on magic had created a society where only the traditional was accepted, and anything else was seen as a threat.\n\nThorgar\u2019s personal journey was far from over. He still wrestled with his identity, his place in a world that refused to accept him. But as he looked at the skillet, he felt a spark of hope. Maybe, just maybe, he could forge his own path.\n\nIn the end, Thorgar was not seeking validation from others, but from himself. And that, perhaps, was the most powerful magic of all.",

        "prompt": "You and your partner move into a strange, wedge-shaped house sandwiched between two roaring train lines, drawn by its impossibly low rent. But as the seasons pass, you begin to wonder if the Triangle Zone holds more secrets than just its odd shape.",
        "ground_truth": "The Triangle Zone was our name for the place. I couldn\u2019t think of any better name for it. I mean, the area was a perfect triangle, as if someone had drawn it out. And she and I lived there, on that land. This was back in 1973 or \u201974.\n\nWhen I say \u201cTriangle Zone,\u201d don\u2019t go picturing a kind of delta. The Triangle Zone we lived in was much narrower, more like a wedge. Imagine, say, a round, full-sized cheesecake. Cut it into twelve equal pieces with a knife so it\u2019s like the face of a clock. What you\u2019d end up with, of course, are twelve slices of thirty degrees each at the tip. Place one of these on a plate and, as you sip your tea, take a good hard look at it. That tapered end of the thin slice of cake? That\u2019s exactly the shape of the Triangle Zone I\u2019m talking about.\n\nO.K., so how did such a weirdly shaped plot of land come about? Well you might ask. Or maybe not. Either way\u2019s fine with me, since I don\u2019t know the answer. I asked some of the neighbors about it, but all I found out was that it had been shaped like a triangle long, long ago, was a triangle now, and would probably\u2014far, far into the future\u2014remain a triangle. People there didn\u2019t seem to want to talk about this Triangle Zone, or even think about it. For them, it was like talking about a wart behind your ear. Better left undiscussed. Probably because of its weird shape.\n\nRailroad lines ran along either side of the Triangle Zone, one a national railway line, the other a private line. The two lines ran parallel for a while, then at the very tip of the wedge formed a junction where it was as if they were ripped apart, branching off at strange angles, one north and one south. It was quite a sight to see. Whenever I gazed at the trains whizzing by at the tip of the Triangle Zone, I felt as if I were standing on the bridge of a destroyer slicing its way through the ocean waves.\n\nIn terms of livability, the Triangle Zone was appalling. First of all, there was the obvious noise level. But what do you expect? How could it not be earsplitting to live hemmed in between two railroad lines? Open the front door and there was a train roaring by; open a window at the back of the house and yet another train would thunder by, right before your eyes. And when I say \u201cright before your eyes,\u201d I\u2019m not exaggerating. The trains were so close that I could look the passengers in the eye and nod a greeting. Really something, now that I think about it.\n\nYou\u2019d assume that it would be quiet after the last train of the night had passed by, right? I thought so, too, before I moved there. Problem was, there was no such thing as a last train. The last passenger train was just before 1 A.M., but then came the late-night freight trains. And, once they\u2019d finished rolling by, at dawn, the next day\u2019s passenger trains would start up again. It was an endless repeat of this, day after day.\n\nTalk about crazy.\n\nWe picked this place to live in for one simple reason: it was dirt cheap. It was a detached house with three rooms, its own bath, and even a small garden, all for about the same price as renting a studio apartment. Since it was a stand-alone house, we could bring our cat along, too. It was as if the place had been specially made, just for us. We\u2019d only recently got married, and, not to brag or anything, but we could very well have been featured in the Guinness Book of Records under \u201cWorld\u2019s Poorest Couple.\u201d We saw the house listed in the window of a real-estate agent\u2019s office near the station. At least as far as the rent and the layout of the rooms were concerned, this was a lucky find. Astonishing, even.\n\n\u201cYeah, cheap it is. For sure,\u201d the bald real-estate agent said. \u201cBut I have to warn you\u2014it\u2019s really noisy. As long as you can stand that, you could call it a lucky find.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you mind showing it to us?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cSure. But can\u2019t the two of you just go? I get a headache every time I go to that place.\u201d\n\nHe handed me the keys and drew a map. What an easygoing agent.\n\nOn the map, the Triangle Zone didn\u2019t look far from the station, but, when we actually walked to it, it took forever. We had to detour around the railroad tracks, cross an overpass, and trudge up and down a somewhat filthy hill before we finally arrived at the rear of the Triangle Zone. There wasn\u2019t a store in sight. A totally seedy neighborhood.\n\nMy wife and I went into the house at the very tip of the Triangle Zone and stayed for about an hour, just hanging out. During this time, trains kept on rumbling past. Whenever an express train roared by, the windows would rattle. We couldn\u2019t hear each other while a train was passing. We\u2019d be talking and then would have to stop until it was gone. We\u2019d resume talking when it got quiet, only to be interrupted a moment later by yet another train. Choppy, interrupted communication \u00e0 la Jean-Luc Godard.\n\nAside from the noise, the house wasn\u2019t so bad. The structure itself was old-fashioned and in need of some serious repair, but on the plus side it had a tokonoma recessed alcove and a small outside sitting area attached to the house, and had a nice feel to it. Spring light shining in through the windows formed little sunny squares on the tatami. It was a lot like the house I\u2019d lived in, years ago, when I was little. \u201cLet\u2019s take it,\u201d I said. \u201cI know it\u2019s noisy, but we\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what you think, I\u2019m O.K. with it,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\u201cSitting here together like this, it feels like we\u2019re married, our own family.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we are married.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yeah. True enough,\u201d I said.\n\nWe went back to the real-estate agency and told the bald agent that we\u2019d take it.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it too noisy?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYes, it is, but we\u2019ll get used to it,\u201d I said.\n\nThe agent took off his glasses, wiped them with a tissue, took a sip of tea from his teacup, put his glasses back on, and looked at me.\n\n\u201cWell, \u2019cause you\u2019re young,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d I replied.\n\nAnd we filled out the rental agreement.\n\nA friend\u2019s little minivan was more than enough for our move. Futons, clothes, a lamp, a few books, and a cat\u2014that was the extent of our belongings. Nothing else. No radio or TV. No washer or dining table or gas stove or telephone or kettle or vacuum cleaner. That was how poor we were. So our move, such as it was, took only half an hour. Life can be simpler if you don\u2019t have much money.\n\nWhen the friend who helped us move took one look at our new dwelling, hemmed in by railroad lines, he was aghast. After we\u2019d unloaded everything, he turned to me and said something, but a passing express train drowned out his words.\n\n\u201cDid you say something?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cPeople really live in a place like this, huh?\u201d he commented, impressed.\n\nWe ended up living in that house for two years.\n\nIt was a poorly built house in a way, since wind blew in through cracks and gaps all over the place. Pleasant enough in the summer, but, come winter, it was hell. With no money to buy a space heater, my wife and I and the cat would crawl under the futons once the sun set, literally clinging to each other to keep warm. Many a time we\u2019d wake up to find the water in the kitchen faucet frozen solid.\n\nOnce winter passed, the spring would come. And spring was a lovely season. She and I and the cat would breathe a sigh of relief. In April, the railroads went on strike for a few days, and we were ecstatic. Not a single train came rumbling by all day. We carried the cat down to the railroad tracks and sat there sunning ourselves. It was so quiet it was as if we were sitting at the bottom of a lake. We were young, just married, and the sunshine was free!\n\nEven now, when I hear the word \u201cpoor,\u201d I remember that thin, triangular sliver of land. And I wonder, Who could be living there now? \u2666\n\n",
        "story_a": "The house stood at the intersection of reverie and discontent. A wedge-shaped anomaly, sandwiched between two roaring train lines, it seemed like a mirage, an illusion of affordable rent in a city where space was a luxury. We moved in, drawn by the impossibly low price and the eccentricity of its structure. The Triangle Zone, as we came to call it, felt like an adventure, a story waiting to unfold, its secrets tucked into corners where light barely touched.\n\nIn the first weeks, we marveled at the quirks of our new home. The narrow kitchen that forced us to cook in tandem, the living room with its slanting walls that made furniture placement an exercise in creativity, and the peculiar acoustics that amplified whispers into conversations. The trains, though loud, became a rhythm, a metronome that punctuated our days and soothed our nights. The steel wheels on iron tracks were a lullaby of sorts, a reminder that the world outside was in constant motion.\n\nSeasons changed, and with them, the novelty of the Triangle Zone began to wane. The trains, once a source of comfort, now felt like an intrusion, their relentless clatter a reminder of confinement. I noticed the cracks in the walls, the way the windows rattled with each passing locomotive, as though the house itself were shivering. But it was the subtle shift in our lives that troubled me more.\n\nI caught glimpses of my partner, Elena, standing by the narrow window, her silhouette framed against the twilight, her face a study in contemplation. She had always been the dreamer, the one with eyes that saw beyond the present, but now there was a distance, an opacity to her thoughts that I could not penetrate.\n\n\"Do you ever wonder about this place?\" she asked one evening, as we sat in the living room, the light from a single lamp casting long shadows.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I replied, though I had my own suspicions.\n\n\"The house... it feels like it's watching us, doesn't it?\"\n\nI laughed, a short, uneasy sound. \"It's just a house, Elena. An oddly shaped one, but still just a house.\"\n\nShe shrugged, her eyes lingering on the slanted ceiling. \"Maybe.\"\n\nThe days grew shorter, the nights longer. The trains, now more frequent, seemed to bring with them a chill that seeped into our bones. Elena's restlessness grew, her nights filled with dreams she could not recall, her days marked by a quiet introspection. I tried to reach her, but it was as though she had slipped into a world of her own, a world where I was only a distant observer.\n\nOne night, as the wind howled and the trains roared, I found her in the attic. It was a space we rarely ventured into, its low ceiling and cramped quarters a repository for forgotten boxes and old furniture. She stood by the small, circular window, her breath fogging the glass.\n\n\"Elena, what are you doing up here?\" I asked, my voice echoing in the confined space.\n\nShe turned to me, her eyes wide, almost luminous in the dim light. \"I heard something,\" she said. \"A voice.\"\n\n\"A voice? From where?\"\n\n\"From the walls,\" she whispered. \"It's like the house is speaking to me.\"\n\nI felt a shiver run down my spine. \"Elena, you're just tired. This place... it gets to you. Let's go back downstairs.\"\n\nShe nodded, but there was a reluctance in her movement, a hesitation that spoke of something deeper. We returned to the living room, but the sense of unease lingered, a shadow that clung to the edges of our lives.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, I began to hear it too. A faint murmur, a whisper that seemed to emanate from the very fabric of the house. At first, I dismissed it as the creaking of old wood, the settling of foundations, but as the nights grew colder, the whispers grew louder, more insistent. They spoke of secrets, of hidden things buried deep within the walls, of lives intertwined with the very essence of the Triangle Zone.\n\nElena became more withdrawn, her eyes haunted by something she could not name. She spent hours in the attic, her fingers tracing the lines of the walls, as though searching for a hidden passage, a door to another world. I watched her, helpless, as she slipped further away from me, consumed by the house and its secrets.\n\nOne night, as the trains thundered past, I woke to find her gone. Panic surged through me as I searched the house, my heart pounding in my chest. I found her in the attic, standing before a section of the wall that seemed to pulse with a life of its own.\n\n\"Elena, what are you doing?\" I shouted, my voice breaking the silence.\n\nShe turned to me, her face pale, her eyes distant. \"I found it,\" she said. \"The door.\"\n\n\"What door?\"\n\n\"The door to the other side,\" she whispered, her fingers tracing the outline of an invisible portal.\n\nI stepped closer, my breath catching as I saw it too. A faint outline, a shimmer in the air, as though the wall itself were a veil, a barrier between worlds.\n\n\"Elena, this is madness. We need to leave this place.\"\n\nShe shook her head, her eyes filled with a strange, serene determination. \"I can't leave. Not now. I have to know.\"\n\n\"Know what?\"\n\n\"The truth,\" she said simply, and with that, she stepped through the wall, disappearing into the unknown.\n\nI reached out, but it was too late. The shimmer faded, and the wall was solid once more. I pounded on it, desperation clawing at my throat, but there was no response. Elena was gone, lost to the secrets of the Triangle Zone.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and I searched every corner of the house, every hidden nook and cranny, but she was nowhere to be found. The whispers grew louder, mocking me, taunting me with their knowledge. I became a prisoner of the house, my life reduced to a ceaseless search for answers that eluded me.\n\nThe trains continued to roar past, their noise a constant reminder of the world outside, a world I no longer belonged to. I was trapped in the Triangle Zone, a place where reality blurred and dreams became nightmares. I saw Elena in my dreams, her face framed by the soft glow of twilight, her eyes filled with a sadness I could not comprehend.\n\nOne night, as the wind howled and the trains thundered, I found myself in the attic once more. The circular window offered no solace, only a view of darkness and shadows. I stood before the wall, my fingers tracing the outline of the invisible door, and for a moment, I felt a connection, a pull that drew me closer.\n\nI stepped through the wall, into a world of whispers and shadows, a world where the secrets of the Triangle Zone were laid bare. I saw Elena, her form shimmering in the twilight, her eyes filled with a quiet understanding.\n\n\"You found me,\" she said, her voice a soft echo in the silence.\n\n\"I couldn't leave you,\" I replied, my heart aching with the weight of our separation.\n\nShe smiled, a sad, wistful smile. \"The house... it's not just a house. It's a passage, a gateway to another realm. We're part of it now, part of its secrets.\"\n\nI took her hand, feeling the warmth of her touch, the solidity of her presence. \"We'll face it together,\" I said, my voice steady.\n\nAnd so, we walked through the corridors of the Triangle Zone, our footsteps echoing in the silence, our hearts bound by the mystery that had drawn us in. The house watched over us, its whispers a constant reminder of the secrets it held, but we were no longer afraid. We had found each other, and in that, we had found our truth.\n\nThe trains continued to roar past, their noise a distant hum, a reminder of the world we had left behind. We were part of the Triangle Zone now, its secrets our own, its mysteries a part of our story. And in the quiet moments, when the whispers faded and the shadows danced, we knew that we were home.",
        "story_b": "The wedge-shaped house stood defiant, like a ship\u2019s prow slicing through the relentless tide of urban sprawl. Its brick fa\u00e7ade was weathered, a testament to years spent wedged between two relentless train lines. The rent was ridiculously low, a fact that had initially sparked our curiosity more than alarm. As we stepped inside for the first time, the noise of a passing train rumbled beneath our feet, vibrating through the walls like a giant\u2019s heartbeat.\n\n\"Can you believe this place?\" Sam's voice was bright with excitement as they ran a hand along the slanted wall, fingers tracing the jagged seams of brick and mortar. There was something infectious about their enthusiasm, even as I squinted at the odd angles that seemed to converge overhead, casting strange shadows across the narrow hallway.\n\n\"It's... unique,\" I replied, forcing a smile. The air inside was cool and musty, a scent that clung to my nostrils like wet leaves.\n\nThe first few weeks were filled with the thrill of settling in, arranging furniture to fit the peculiar geometry of our new home. The windows were slender slits, letting in beams of light that slashed across the rooms, highlighting dust motes like tiny planets in orbit. At night, the trains sang their lullabies, a cacophony that rocked us to sleep with its relentless rhythm.\n\nBut as summer gave way to autumn, subtle shifts began to ripple through our sanctuary. It started with noises that echoed through the corridors\u2014whispers that seemed to drift from the walls themselves. At first, I dismissed them as tricks of the wind, the groans and creaks of an old house settling into its foundation. Yet, as days turned into weeks, the whispers grew more insistent, tugging at the edges of my consciousness.\n\n\"Did you hear that?\" I would ask Sam, who would tilt their head, listening intently before shaking it off with a laugh. \"It's just the house making friends,\" they\u2019d say, their smile unwavering. But I couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching, something woven into the very fabric of the Triangle Zone.\n\nOne evening, as I stood in the kitchen, the overhead light flickered, casting the room into a strobe-lit dance of light and shadow. I stared at the table, where a spoon lay, still and gleaming. I could have sworn I\u2019d left it in the sink. A chill skittered up my spine.\n\nWhen I mentioned it to Sam, they shrugged. \"You're just tired,\" they said, wrapping an arm around my shoulders, their warmth a balm against the growing unease. \"Moving's stressful. It'll get better.\"\n\nBut it didn't. The strangeness persisted, each day bringing new oddities. Shadows shifted even when the light was still, and sometimes, as I lay in bed, I would hear a soft humming, a lullaby that seemed to rise from the floorboards. Sam, ever pragmatic, attributed it to the trains, their vibrations causing the house to sing its own tunes.\n\nOur lives started to mirror the architecture around us\u2014narrow, constricted, each corner a sharp turn we struggled to navigate. Conversations that once flowed easily now snagged on unspoken worries, the house's mysteries threading through our words like a taut string.\n\nOne night, a storm raged outside, rain lashing the windows like angry fingers. I lay awake, listening to the wind howl through the eaves, when a sound, distinct from the storm\u2019s fury, pulled me from the bed. It was a soft scraping, like nails against stone, emanating from the far end of the hallway.\n\nI found myself drawn to the noise, my feet moving of their own accord. The house seemed to breathe around me, its walls pulsing in time with my heartbeat. At the end of the hall, a door I hadn\u2019t noticed before stood ajar, a sliver of darkness beyond.\n\nInside, the air was thick with dust, the scent of old paper and forgotten secrets. Shelves lined the walls, filled with books whose spines were cracked and faded. But it was the journal on the table that caught my eye, its leather cover worn and inviting. I opened it with trembling fingers.\n\nThe entries were written in a neat, slanting hand, dated decades before. They spoke of the house, of its oddities and the strange occurrences that had driven the previous occupant to the brink of madness. There were sketches, too\u2014scribbled diagrams of the house\u2019s layout, with notes pointing to hidden spaces behind the walls, places where time seemed to fold in on itself.\n\nAs I read, the house groaned, its timbers protesting under the weight of its secrets. I felt a presence, a shifting in the air that whispered of things unseen, of eyes watching from the shadows. The journal slipped from my fingers, and I fled back to the bedroom, where Sam slept soundly, oblivious to the storm that raged both outside and within.\n\nThe next morning, I told Sam everything. My words tumbled out in a rush, the truth of the house\u2019s past spilling over us like a wave. Sam listened, their brow furrowed in concentration, then took my hand in theirs, a steady anchor in the sea of uncertainty.\n\n\"We need to decide,\" they said, their voice calm but firm. \"Do we stay and try to unravel this, or do we leave it behind?\"\n\nThe question hung between us, heavy with implication. The house had become more than just a structure of brick and wood; it was a mirror reflecting our fears, our hesitations, our hope. It was a test of our resolve, our willingness to face the unknown together.\n\nWe spent the day in silence, each lost in thought, the house watching with its quiet patience. As dusk fell, we found ourselves standing at the window, watching the trains streak past in a blur of light and sound. Sam turned to me, their eyes searching mine.\n\n\"I think we should stay,\" I said finally, the words surprising even me. \"There's something here, something we need to understand. Maybe it can help us understand ourselves, too.\"\n\nSam nodded, a small smile playing at their lips. \"Together, then.\"\n\nTogether, we began to explore the house anew, our curiosity tempered by caution, our steps deliberate and measured. The journal became our guide, its pages leading us to discoveries that both terrified and fascinated us. We found hidden rooms, spaces that seemed to exist outside of time, echoes of the past whispering their stories into our ears.\n\nAs winter settled over the city, we grew closer, our bond strengthening with each revelation, each shared secret. The house, once a source of fear, became a part of us, its mysteries woven into the fabric of our lives.\n\nAnd so we stayed, the Triangle Zone becoming both home and enigma. We learned to live with the shadows, the whispers, the hum of time folding around us. We embraced the unknown, finding comfort in the constant rumble of the trains, their song a reminder of the world beyond our wedge-shaped sanctuary.\n\nIn the end, the house was more than just a place; it was a journey, a reflection of the paths we chose to walk, the choices we made in the face of uncertainty. And as we lay in bed at night, listening to the creaks and groans that once filled us with dread, we knew that whatever secrets the house held, we would face them together.\n\nThe Triangle Zone was ours, a place where the past and present danced in intricate patterns, where the lines between reality and imagination blurred and shifted like shadows in the evening light. And in that shifting landscape, we found ourselves, and each other, anew.",

        "prompt": "You and your partner move into a strange, wedge-shaped house sandwiched between two roaring train lines, drawn by its impossibly low rent. But as the seasons pass, you begin to wonder if the Triangle Zone holds more secrets than just its odd shape.",
        "ground_truth": "The Triangle Zone was our name for the place. I couldn\u2019t think of any better name for it. I mean, the area was a perfect triangle, as if someone had drawn it out. And she and I lived there, on that land. This was back in 1973 or \u201974.\n\nWhen I say \u201cTriangle Zone,\u201d don\u2019t go picturing a kind of delta. The Triangle Zone we lived in was much narrower, more like a wedge. Imagine, say, a round, full-sized cheesecake. Cut it into twelve equal pieces with a knife so it\u2019s like the face of a clock. What you\u2019d end up with, of course, are twelve slices of thirty degrees each at the tip. Place one of these on a plate and, as you sip your tea, take a good hard look at it. That tapered end of the thin slice of cake? That\u2019s exactly the shape of the Triangle Zone I\u2019m talking about.\n\nO.K., so how did such a weirdly shaped plot of land come about? Well you might ask. Or maybe not. Either way\u2019s fine with me, since I don\u2019t know the answer. I asked some of the neighbors about it, but all I found out was that it had been shaped like a triangle long, long ago, was a triangle now, and would probably\u2014far, far into the future\u2014remain a triangle. People there didn\u2019t seem to want to talk about this Triangle Zone, or even think about it. For them, it was like talking about a wart behind your ear. Better left undiscussed. Probably because of its weird shape.\n\nRailroad lines ran along either side of the Triangle Zone, one a national railway line, the other a private line. The two lines ran parallel for a while, then at the very tip of the wedge formed a junction where it was as if they were ripped apart, branching off at strange angles, one north and one south. It was quite a sight to see. Whenever I gazed at the trains whizzing by at the tip of the Triangle Zone, I felt as if I were standing on the bridge of a destroyer slicing its way through the ocean waves.\n\nIn terms of livability, the Triangle Zone was appalling. First of all, there was the obvious noise level. But what do you expect? How could it not be earsplitting to live hemmed in between two railroad lines? Open the front door and there was a train roaring by; open a window at the back of the house and yet another train would thunder by, right before your eyes. And when I say \u201cright before your eyes,\u201d I\u2019m not exaggerating. The trains were so close that I could look the passengers in the eye and nod a greeting. Really something, now that I think about it.\n\nYou\u2019d assume that it would be quiet after the last train of the night had passed by, right? I thought so, too, before I moved there. Problem was, there was no such thing as a last train. The last passenger train was just before 1 A.M., but then came the late-night freight trains. And, once they\u2019d finished rolling by, at dawn, the next day\u2019s passenger trains would start up again. It was an endless repeat of this, day after day.\n\nTalk about crazy.\n\nWe picked this place to live in for one simple reason: it was dirt cheap. It was a detached house with three rooms, its own bath, and even a small garden, all for about the same price as renting a studio apartment. Since it was a stand-alone house, we could bring our cat along, too. It was as if the place had been specially made, just for us. We\u2019d only recently got married, and, not to brag or anything, but we could very well have been featured in the Guinness Book of Records under \u201cWorld\u2019s Poorest Couple.\u201d We saw the house listed in the window of a real-estate agent\u2019s office near the station. At least as far as the rent and the layout of the rooms were concerned, this was a lucky find. Astonishing, even.\n\n\u201cYeah, cheap it is. For sure,\u201d the bald real-estate agent said. \u201cBut I have to warn you\u2014it\u2019s really noisy. As long as you can stand that, you could call it a lucky find.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you mind showing it to us?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cSure. But can\u2019t the two of you just go? I get a headache every time I go to that place.\u201d\n\nHe handed me the keys and drew a map. What an easygoing agent.\n\nOn the map, the Triangle Zone didn\u2019t look far from the station, but, when we actually walked to it, it took forever. We had to detour around the railroad tracks, cross an overpass, and trudge up and down a somewhat filthy hill before we finally arrived at the rear of the Triangle Zone. There wasn\u2019t a store in sight. A totally seedy neighborhood.\n\nMy wife and I went into the house at the very tip of the Triangle Zone and stayed for about an hour, just hanging out. During this time, trains kept on rumbling past. Whenever an express train roared by, the windows would rattle. We couldn\u2019t hear each other while a train was passing. We\u2019d be talking and then would have to stop until it was gone. We\u2019d resume talking when it got quiet, only to be interrupted a moment later by yet another train. Choppy, interrupted communication \u00e0 la Jean-Luc Godard.\n\nAside from the noise, the house wasn\u2019t so bad. The structure itself was old-fashioned and in need of some serious repair, but on the plus side it had a tokonoma recessed alcove and a small outside sitting area attached to the house, and had a nice feel to it. Spring light shining in through the windows formed little sunny squares on the tatami. It was a lot like the house I\u2019d lived in, years ago, when I was little. \u201cLet\u2019s take it,\u201d I said. \u201cI know it\u2019s noisy, but we\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what you think, I\u2019m O.K. with it,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\u201cSitting here together like this, it feels like we\u2019re married, our own family.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we are married.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yeah. True enough,\u201d I said.\n\nWe went back to the real-estate agency and told the bald agent that we\u2019d take it.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it too noisy?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYes, it is, but we\u2019ll get used to it,\u201d I said.\n\nThe agent took off his glasses, wiped them with a tissue, took a sip of tea from his teacup, put his glasses back on, and looked at me.\n\n\u201cWell, \u2019cause you\u2019re young,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d I replied.\n\nAnd we filled out the rental agreement.\n\nA friend\u2019s little minivan was more than enough for our move. Futons, clothes, a lamp, a few books, and a cat\u2014that was the extent of our belongings. Nothing else. No radio or TV. No washer or dining table or gas stove or telephone or kettle or vacuum cleaner. That was how poor we were. So our move, such as it was, took only half an hour. Life can be simpler if you don\u2019t have much money.\n\nWhen the friend who helped us move took one look at our new dwelling, hemmed in by railroad lines, he was aghast. After we\u2019d unloaded everything, he turned to me and said something, but a passing express train drowned out his words.\n\n\u201cDid you say something?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cPeople really live in a place like this, huh?\u201d he commented, impressed.\n\nWe ended up living in that house for two years.\n\nIt was a poorly built house in a way, since wind blew in through cracks and gaps all over the place. Pleasant enough in the summer, but, come winter, it was hell. With no money to buy a space heater, my wife and I and the cat would crawl under the futons once the sun set, literally clinging to each other to keep warm. Many a time we\u2019d wake up to find the water in the kitchen faucet frozen solid.\n\nOnce winter passed, the spring would come. And spring was a lovely season. She and I and the cat would breathe a sigh of relief. In April, the railroads went on strike for a few days, and we were ecstatic. Not a single train came rumbling by all day. We carried the cat down to the railroad tracks and sat there sunning ourselves. It was so quiet it was as if we were sitting at the bottom of a lake. We were young, just married, and the sunshine was free!\n\nEven now, when I hear the word \u201cpoor,\u201d I remember that thin, triangular sliver of land. And I wonder, Who could be living there now? \u2666\n\n",
        "story_a": "The house stood at the intersection of reverie and discontent. A wedge-shaped anomaly, sandwiched between two roaring train lines, it seemed like a mirage, an illusion of affordable rent in a city where space was a luxury. We moved in, drawn by the impossibly low price and the eccentricity of its structure. The Triangle Zone, as we came to call it, felt like an adventure, a story waiting to unfold, its secrets tucked into corners where light barely touched.\n\nIn the first weeks, we marveled at the quirks of our new home. The narrow kitchen that forced us to cook in tandem, the living room with its slanting walls that made furniture placement an exercise in creativity, and the peculiar acoustics that amplified whispers into conversations. The trains, though loud, became a rhythm, a metronome that punctuated our days and soothed our nights. The steel wheels on iron tracks were a lullaby of sorts, a reminder that the world outside was in constant motion.\n\nSeasons changed, and with them, the novelty of the Triangle Zone began to wane. The trains, once a source of comfort, now felt like an intrusion, their relentless clatter a reminder of confinement. I noticed the cracks in the walls, the way the windows rattled with each passing locomotive, as though the house itself were shivering. But it was the subtle shift in our lives that troubled me more.\n\nI caught glimpses of my partner, Elena, standing by the narrow window, her silhouette framed against the twilight, her face a study in contemplation. She had always been the dreamer, the one with eyes that saw beyond the present, but now there was a distance, an opacity to her thoughts that I could not penetrate.\n\n\"Do you ever wonder about this place?\" she asked one evening, as we sat in the living room, the light from a single lamp casting long shadows.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I replied, though I had my own suspicions.\n\n\"The house... it feels like it's watching us, doesn't it?\"\n\nI laughed, a short, uneasy sound. \"It's just a house, Elena. An oddly shaped one, but still just a house.\"\n\nShe shrugged, her eyes lingering on the slanted ceiling. \"Maybe.\"\n\nThe days grew shorter, the nights longer. The trains, now more frequent, seemed to bring with them a chill that seeped into our bones. Elena's restlessness grew, her nights filled with dreams she could not recall, her days marked by a quiet introspection. I tried to reach her, but it was as though she had slipped into a world of her own, a world where I was only a distant observer.\n\nOne night, as the wind howled and the trains roared, I found her in the attic. It was a space we rarely ventured into, its low ceiling and cramped quarters a repository for forgotten boxes and old furniture. She stood by the small, circular window, her breath fogging the glass.\n\n\"Elena, what are you doing up here?\" I asked, my voice echoing in the confined space.\n\nShe turned to me, her eyes wide, almost luminous in the dim light. \"I heard something,\" she said. \"A voice.\"\n\n\"A voice? From where?\"\n\n\"From the walls,\" she whispered. \"It's like the house is speaking to me.\"\n\nI felt a shiver run down my spine. \"Elena, you're just tired. This place... it gets to you. Let's go back downstairs.\"\n\nShe nodded, but there was a reluctance in her movement, a hesitation that spoke of something deeper. We returned to the living room, but the sense of unease lingered, a shadow that clung to the edges of our lives.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, I began to hear it too. A faint murmur, a whisper that seemed to emanate from the very fabric of the house. At first, I dismissed it as the creaking of old wood, the settling of foundations, but as the nights grew colder, the whispers grew louder, more insistent. They spoke of secrets, of hidden things buried deep within the walls, of lives intertwined with the very essence of the Triangle Zone.\n\nElena became more withdrawn, her eyes haunted by something she could not name. She spent hours in the attic, her fingers tracing the lines of the walls, as though searching for a hidden passage, a door to another world. I watched her, helpless, as she slipped further away from me, consumed by the house and its secrets.\n\nOne night, as the trains thundered past, I woke to find her gone. Panic surged through me as I searched the house, my heart pounding in my chest. I found her in the attic, standing before a section of the wall that seemed to pulse with a life of its own.\n\n\"Elena, what are you doing?\" I shouted, my voice breaking the silence.\n\nShe turned to me, her face pale, her eyes distant. \"I found it,\" she said. \"The door.\"\n\n\"What door?\"\n\n\"The door to the other side,\" she whispered, her fingers tracing the outline of an invisible portal.\n\nI stepped closer, my breath catching as I saw it too. A faint outline, a shimmer in the air, as though the wall itself were a veil, a barrier between worlds.\n\n\"Elena, this is madness. We need to leave this place.\"\n\nShe shook her head, her eyes filled with a strange, serene determination. \"I can't leave. Not now. I have to know.\"\n\n\"Know what?\"\n\n\"The truth,\" she said simply, and with that, she stepped through the wall, disappearing into the unknown.\n\nI reached out, but it was too late. The shimmer faded, and the wall was solid once more. I pounded on it, desperation clawing at my throat, but there was no response. Elena was gone, lost to the secrets of the Triangle Zone.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and I searched every corner of the house, every hidden nook and cranny, but she was nowhere to be found. The whispers grew louder, mocking me, taunting me with their knowledge. I became a prisoner of the house, my life reduced to a ceaseless search for answers that eluded me.\n\nThe trains continued to roar past, their noise a constant reminder of the world outside, a world I no longer belonged to. I was trapped in the Triangle Zone, a place where reality blurred and dreams became nightmares. I saw Elena in my dreams, her face framed by the soft glow of twilight, her eyes filled with a sadness I could not comprehend.\n\nOne night, as the wind howled and the trains thundered, I found myself in the attic once more. The circular window offered no solace, only a view of darkness and shadows. I stood before the wall, my fingers tracing the outline of the invisible door, and for a moment, I felt a connection, a pull that drew me closer.\n\nI stepped through the wall, into a world of whispers and shadows, a world where the secrets of the Triangle Zone were laid bare. I saw Elena, her form shimmering in the twilight, her eyes filled with a quiet understanding.\n\n\"You found me,\" she said, her voice a soft echo in the silence.\n\n\"I couldn't leave you,\" I replied, my heart aching with the weight of our separation.\n\nShe smiled, a sad, wistful smile. \"The house... it's not just a house. It's a passage, a gateway to another realm. We're part of it now, part of its secrets.\"\n\nI took her hand, feeling the warmth of her touch, the solidity of her presence. \"We'll face it together,\" I said, my voice steady.\n\nAnd so, we walked through the corridors of the Triangle Zone, our footsteps echoing in the silence, our hearts bound by the mystery that had drawn us in. The house watched over us, its whispers a constant reminder of the secrets it held, but we were no longer afraid. We had found each other, and in that, we had found our truth.\n\nThe trains continued to roar past, their noise a distant hum, a reminder of the world we had left behind. We were part of the Triangle Zone now, its secrets our own, its mysteries a part of our story. And in the quiet moments, when the whispers faded and the shadows danced, we knew that we were home.",
        "story_b": "The moment we moved into the wedge-shaped house, nestled like a forgotten relic between two roaring train lines, I felt the world tilt slightly off its axis. The house, with its peculiar angles and shadows, seemed to defy the logic of architecture. The low rent had been a siren call, luring us into the Triangle Zone, a place that felt both foreign and eerily familiar.\n\nOur first night there, the trains' relentless symphony rattled through the paper-thin walls, a metallic heartbeat that refused to be ignored. I lay awake, feeling the vibrations travel through the mattress, and wondered if this was what it meant to live inside a riddle. Beside me, my partner, Sam, slept soundly, as if the cacophony were a lullaby.\n\nDays passed, and I found myself drawn deeper into the house's enigma. The narrow corridors, like veins leading to a heart, twisted and turned, sometimes leading nowhere. Each time I stepped into the hallway, it felt as though I might wander into an alternate reality where the laws of space and time were rewritten. The walls whispered secrets in the language of creaking wood and settling dust.\n\nThe house's windows were small and oddly placed, casting fragmented light across the rooms. I would sit in the living room, watching the sunlight dance across the floor like a restless ghost. It was during one of these moments that I first heard it\u2014a soft, almost imperceptible whisper, like the susurrus of leaves on a windless day. I turned, expecting to see Sam, but I was alone.\n\n\"Did you hear that?\" I asked later, as we sat at the tiny kitchen table, our elbows practically touching.\n\n\"Hear what?\" Sam replied, looking up from the newspaper, a smile teasing the corner of their lips.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said, trying to find the right words. \"It's like the house is alive.\"\n\nSam laughed, the sound bright and comforting amidst the gloom. \"Maybe it is,\" they said, their eyes twinkling with mischief. \"Maybe it's trying to tell us something.\"\n\nWe laughed it off, chalking it up to the quirks of an old house settling into its foundations. But in the quiet moments, when the trains paused their relentless march and the world seemed to hold its breath, I could feel the house watching us, its presence a shadow in the corner of my mind.\n\nAutumn came, painting the world outside in shades of gold and rust. The house, too, seemed to shift, its shadows growing longer and darker. I found myself wandering its narrow halls more frequently, tracing the lines of wallpaper with my fingertips, searching for something I couldn't name.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, I stood at the window, watching the shadows stretch across the yard like fingers reaching for the fading light. The trains roared past, a reminder of the world beyond this strange cocoon. Sam was in the kitchen, humming softly as they prepared dinner, their voice a beacon in the encroaching darkness.\n\nThe whispering began again, a soft murmur that seemed to rise from the very bones of the house. It was insistent, calling to me with a voice that was both foreign and intimately familiar. I closed my eyes, letting the sound wash over me, and in that moment, I understood.\n\nThe house was a prism, refracting the light of our lives into unexpected colors. It held within its walls the echoes of our past, the dreams and fears we had brought with us, and the secrets we had yet to uncover. It was a mirror, reflecting the truths we had hidden even from ourselves.\n\nI turned away from the window, my heart pounding in my chest. Sam stood in the doorway, watching me with a curious gaze. \"You okay?\" they asked, concern lacing their voice.\n\nI nodded, forcing a smile. \"Yeah, just... thinking.\"\n\n\"About what?\"\n\nI hesitated, searching for the right words. \"About this place. About us.\"\n\nSam crossed the room, wrapping their arms around me, grounding me with their warmth. \"It's just a house,\" they murmured, resting their chin on my shoulder. \"It can't hurt us.\"\n\nBut I wasn't so sure. As winter settled in, the house seemed to draw closer around us, its angles sharper, its shadows deeper. The trains' roars became a constant presence, a reminder of the boundaries we had unknowingly crossed.\n\nOne night, as snow fell silently outside, I found myself wandering the halls again, drawn by a pull I couldn't resist. The air was heavy with the scent of dust and time, and the whispering grew louder, a symphony of voices overlapping and merging until they became a single, coherent thought.\n\nI stopped in front of a small, forgotten door at the end of the hall. It was a door I had never noticed before, its surface worn and weathered, as if it had witnessed countless seasons pass. My hand trembled as I reached for the knob, hesitating for a moment before turning it.\n\nThe door swung open with a groan, revealing a narrow staircase that spiraled downward into darkness. I hesitated, the weight of the unknown pressing down on me. But the whispering urged me forward, promising answers to questions I had never dared to ask.\n\nWith each step I took, the air grew colder, the darkness thicker. The whispering swelled, filling the space around me, guiding me deeper into the house's heart. And then, suddenly, the staircase ended, depositing me into a small, dimly lit room.\n\nThe room was empty, save for a single, dusty mirror hanging on the far wall. I approached it slowly, my reflection distorted and wavering in the glass. The whispering ceased, and in the silence that followed, I heard my own voice, clear and steady.\n\n\"What do you want?\" I asked, my words echoing in the stillness.\n\nThe house responded with a flicker of light, a brief flash that illuminated the room in shades of silver and shadow. I saw my reflection shift, becoming something other, something more. It was me, but not me, a version of myself that had been shaped by the house's secrets and lies.\n\nIn that moment, I understood. The house was not haunted by ghosts of the past, but by the fears and desires that lay buried within me. It was a reflection of my own psyche, a place where the boundaries between reality and imagination blurred and twisted.\n\nI stepped back, my heart racing, and the mirror returned to its original state, my reflection once again my own. The whispering resumed, softer now, a lullaby that cradled me in its embrace.\n\nI retraced my steps, the whispering fading as I ascended the staircase and closed the door behind me. Sam was waiting for me in the hallway, their expression a mixture of curiosity and concern.\n\n\"What happened?\" they asked, taking my hand in theirs.\n\nI squeezed their hand, drawing strength from their presence. \"I think... I think I found what I was looking for.\"\n\n\"And what was that?\"\n\nMy gaze drifted to the window, where the snow continued to fall, blanketing the world in silence. The trains were quiet for once, the stillness a balm to my frayed nerves. \"I found myself,\" I said softly, turning back to Sam. \"And I found us.\"\n\nWe stood there for a moment, wrapped in the warmth of each other's presence, the house a silent witness to our realization. It was no longer an enigma, but a part of our story, a place where we could confront the shadows of our past and forge a new path together.\n\nAs the seasons turned once more, the wedge-shaped house remained, a prism of secrets and possibilities. The trains continued their relentless march, but their roars no longer held the power to unsettle. In the Triangle Zone, we had found the courage to face our own fears and desires, and in doing so, we had found each other anew.\n\nThe house whispered its approval, a soft murmur that echoed through the walls, a reminder that the journey was far from over. But for now, we were content to stand together, hand in hand, ready to embrace whatever came next.",

        "prompt": "You and your partner move into a strange, wedge-shaped house sandwiched between two roaring train lines, drawn by its impossibly low rent. But as the seasons pass, you begin to wonder if the Triangle Zone holds more secrets than just its odd shape.",
        "ground_truth": "The Triangle Zone was our name for the place. I couldn\u2019t think of any better name for it. I mean, the area was a perfect triangle, as if someone had drawn it out. And she and I lived there, on that land. This was back in 1973 or \u201974.\n\nWhen I say \u201cTriangle Zone,\u201d don\u2019t go picturing a kind of delta. The Triangle Zone we lived in was much narrower, more like a wedge. Imagine, say, a round, full-sized cheesecake. Cut it into twelve equal pieces with a knife so it\u2019s like the face of a clock. What you\u2019d end up with, of course, are twelve slices of thirty degrees each at the tip. Place one of these on a plate and, as you sip your tea, take a good hard look at it. That tapered end of the thin slice of cake? That\u2019s exactly the shape of the Triangle Zone I\u2019m talking about.\n\nO.K., so how did such a weirdly shaped plot of land come about? Well you might ask. Or maybe not. Either way\u2019s fine with me, since I don\u2019t know the answer. I asked some of the neighbors about it, but all I found out was that it had been shaped like a triangle long, long ago, was a triangle now, and would probably\u2014far, far into the future\u2014remain a triangle. People there didn\u2019t seem to want to talk about this Triangle Zone, or even think about it. For them, it was like talking about a wart behind your ear. Better left undiscussed. Probably because of its weird shape.\n\nRailroad lines ran along either side of the Triangle Zone, one a national railway line, the other a private line. The two lines ran parallel for a while, then at the very tip of the wedge formed a junction where it was as if they were ripped apart, branching off at strange angles, one north and one south. It was quite a sight to see. Whenever I gazed at the trains whizzing by at the tip of the Triangle Zone, I felt as if I were standing on the bridge of a destroyer slicing its way through the ocean waves.\n\nIn terms of livability, the Triangle Zone was appalling. First of all, there was the obvious noise level. But what do you expect? How could it not be earsplitting to live hemmed in between two railroad lines? Open the front door and there was a train roaring by; open a window at the back of the house and yet another train would thunder by, right before your eyes. And when I say \u201cright before your eyes,\u201d I\u2019m not exaggerating. The trains were so close that I could look the passengers in the eye and nod a greeting. Really something, now that I think about it.\n\nYou\u2019d assume that it would be quiet after the last train of the night had passed by, right? I thought so, too, before I moved there. Problem was, there was no such thing as a last train. The last passenger train was just before 1 A.M., but then came the late-night freight trains. And, once they\u2019d finished rolling by, at dawn, the next day\u2019s passenger trains would start up again. It was an endless repeat of this, day after day.\n\nTalk about crazy.\n\nWe picked this place to live in for one simple reason: it was dirt cheap. It was a detached house with three rooms, its own bath, and even a small garden, all for about the same price as renting a studio apartment. Since it was a stand-alone house, we could bring our cat along, too. It was as if the place had been specially made, just for us. We\u2019d only recently got married, and, not to brag or anything, but we could very well have been featured in the Guinness Book of Records under \u201cWorld\u2019s Poorest Couple.\u201d We saw the house listed in the window of a real-estate agent\u2019s office near the station. At least as far as the rent and the layout of the rooms were concerned, this was a lucky find. Astonishing, even.\n\n\u201cYeah, cheap it is. For sure,\u201d the bald real-estate agent said. \u201cBut I have to warn you\u2014it\u2019s really noisy. As long as you can stand that, you could call it a lucky find.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you mind showing it to us?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cSure. But can\u2019t the two of you just go? I get a headache every time I go to that place.\u201d\n\nHe handed me the keys and drew a map. What an easygoing agent.\n\nOn the map, the Triangle Zone didn\u2019t look far from the station, but, when we actually walked to it, it took forever. We had to detour around the railroad tracks, cross an overpass, and trudge up and down a somewhat filthy hill before we finally arrived at the rear of the Triangle Zone. There wasn\u2019t a store in sight. A totally seedy neighborhood.\n\nMy wife and I went into the house at the very tip of the Triangle Zone and stayed for about an hour, just hanging out. During this time, trains kept on rumbling past. Whenever an express train roared by, the windows would rattle. We couldn\u2019t hear each other while a train was passing. We\u2019d be talking and then would have to stop until it was gone. We\u2019d resume talking when it got quiet, only to be interrupted a moment later by yet another train. Choppy, interrupted communication \u00e0 la Jean-Luc Godard.\n\nAside from the noise, the house wasn\u2019t so bad. The structure itself was old-fashioned and in need of some serious repair, but on the plus side it had a tokonoma recessed alcove and a small outside sitting area attached to the house, and had a nice feel to it. Spring light shining in through the windows formed little sunny squares on the tatami. It was a lot like the house I\u2019d lived in, years ago, when I was little. \u201cLet\u2019s take it,\u201d I said. \u201cI know it\u2019s noisy, but we\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what you think, I\u2019m O.K. with it,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\u201cSitting here together like this, it feels like we\u2019re married, our own family.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we are married.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yeah. True enough,\u201d I said.\n\nWe went back to the real-estate agency and told the bald agent that we\u2019d take it.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it too noisy?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYes, it is, but we\u2019ll get used to it,\u201d I said.\n\nThe agent took off his glasses, wiped them with a tissue, took a sip of tea from his teacup, put his glasses back on, and looked at me.\n\n\u201cWell, \u2019cause you\u2019re young,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d I replied.\n\nAnd we filled out the rental agreement.\n\nA friend\u2019s little minivan was more than enough for our move. Futons, clothes, a lamp, a few books, and a cat\u2014that was the extent of our belongings. Nothing else. No radio or TV. No washer or dining table or gas stove or telephone or kettle or vacuum cleaner. That was how poor we were. So our move, such as it was, took only half an hour. Life can be simpler if you don\u2019t have much money.\n\nWhen the friend who helped us move took one look at our new dwelling, hemmed in by railroad lines, he was aghast. After we\u2019d unloaded everything, he turned to me and said something, but a passing express train drowned out his words.\n\n\u201cDid you say something?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cPeople really live in a place like this, huh?\u201d he commented, impressed.\n\nWe ended up living in that house for two years.\n\nIt was a poorly built house in a way, since wind blew in through cracks and gaps all over the place. Pleasant enough in the summer, but, come winter, it was hell. With no money to buy a space heater, my wife and I and the cat would crawl under the futons once the sun set, literally clinging to each other to keep warm. Many a time we\u2019d wake up to find the water in the kitchen faucet frozen solid.\n\nOnce winter passed, the spring would come. And spring was a lovely season. She and I and the cat would breathe a sigh of relief. In April, the railroads went on strike for a few days, and we were ecstatic. Not a single train came rumbling by all day. We carried the cat down to the railroad tracks and sat there sunning ourselves. It was so quiet it was as if we were sitting at the bottom of a lake. We were young, just married, and the sunshine was free!\n\nEven now, when I hear the word \u201cpoor,\u201d I remember that thin, triangular sliver of land. And I wonder, Who could be living there now? \u2666\n\n",
        "story_a": "The house stood at the intersection of reverie and discontent. A wedge-shaped anomaly, sandwiched between two roaring train lines, it seemed like a mirage, an illusion of affordable rent in a city where space was a luxury. We moved in, drawn by the impossibly low price and the eccentricity of its structure. The Triangle Zone, as we came to call it, felt like an adventure, a story waiting to unfold, its secrets tucked into corners where light barely touched.\n\nIn the first weeks, we marveled at the quirks of our new home. The narrow kitchen that forced us to cook in tandem, the living room with its slanting walls that made furniture placement an exercise in creativity, and the peculiar acoustics that amplified whispers into conversations. The trains, though loud, became a rhythm, a metronome that punctuated our days and soothed our nights. The steel wheels on iron tracks were a lullaby of sorts, a reminder that the world outside was in constant motion.\n\nSeasons changed, and with them, the novelty of the Triangle Zone began to wane. The trains, once a source of comfort, now felt like an intrusion, their relentless clatter a reminder of confinement. I noticed the cracks in the walls, the way the windows rattled with each passing locomotive, as though the house itself were shivering. But it was the subtle shift in our lives that troubled me more.\n\nI caught glimpses of my partner, Elena, standing by the narrow window, her silhouette framed against the twilight, her face a study in contemplation. She had always been the dreamer, the one with eyes that saw beyond the present, but now there was a distance, an opacity to her thoughts that I could not penetrate.\n\n\"Do you ever wonder about this place?\" she asked one evening, as we sat in the living room, the light from a single lamp casting long shadows.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I replied, though I had my own suspicions.\n\n\"The house... it feels like it's watching us, doesn't it?\"\n\nI laughed, a short, uneasy sound. \"It's just a house, Elena. An oddly shaped one, but still just a house.\"\n\nShe shrugged, her eyes lingering on the slanted ceiling. \"Maybe.\"\n\nThe days grew shorter, the nights longer. The trains, now more frequent, seemed to bring with them a chill that seeped into our bones. Elena's restlessness grew, her nights filled with dreams she could not recall, her days marked by a quiet introspection. I tried to reach her, but it was as though she had slipped into a world of her own, a world where I was only a distant observer.\n\nOne night, as the wind howled and the trains roared, I found her in the attic. It was a space we rarely ventured into, its low ceiling and cramped quarters a repository for forgotten boxes and old furniture. She stood by the small, circular window, her breath fogging the glass.\n\n\"Elena, what are you doing up here?\" I asked, my voice echoing in the confined space.\n\nShe turned to me, her eyes wide, almost luminous in the dim light. \"I heard something,\" she said. \"A voice.\"\n\n\"A voice? From where?\"\n\n\"From the walls,\" she whispered. \"It's like the house is speaking to me.\"\n\nI felt a shiver run down my spine. \"Elena, you're just tired. This place... it gets to you. Let's go back downstairs.\"\n\nShe nodded, but there was a reluctance in her movement, a hesitation that spoke of something deeper. We returned to the living room, but the sense of unease lingered, a shadow that clung to the edges of our lives.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, I began to hear it too. A faint murmur, a whisper that seemed to emanate from the very fabric of the house. At first, I dismissed it as the creaking of old wood, the settling of foundations, but as the nights grew colder, the whispers grew louder, more insistent. They spoke of secrets, of hidden things buried deep within the walls, of lives intertwined with the very essence of the Triangle Zone.\n\nElena became more withdrawn, her eyes haunted by something she could not name. She spent hours in the attic, her fingers tracing the lines of the walls, as though searching for a hidden passage, a door to another world. I watched her, helpless, as she slipped further away from me, consumed by the house and its secrets.\n\nOne night, as the trains thundered past, I woke to find her gone. Panic surged through me as I searched the house, my heart pounding in my chest. I found her in the attic, standing before a section of the wall that seemed to pulse with a life of its own.\n\n\"Elena, what are you doing?\" I shouted, my voice breaking the silence.\n\nShe turned to me, her face pale, her eyes distant. \"I found it,\" she said. \"The door.\"\n\n\"What door?\"\n\n\"The door to the other side,\" she whispered, her fingers tracing the outline of an invisible portal.\n\nI stepped closer, my breath catching as I saw it too. A faint outline, a shimmer in the air, as though the wall itself were a veil, a barrier between worlds.\n\n\"Elena, this is madness. We need to leave this place.\"\n\nShe shook her head, her eyes filled with a strange, serene determination. \"I can't leave. Not now. I have to know.\"\n\n\"Know what?\"\n\n\"The truth,\" she said simply, and with that, she stepped through the wall, disappearing into the unknown.\n\nI reached out, but it was too late. The shimmer faded, and the wall was solid once more. I pounded on it, desperation clawing at my throat, but there was no response. Elena was gone, lost to the secrets of the Triangle Zone.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and I searched every corner of the house, every hidden nook and cranny, but she was nowhere to be found. The whispers grew louder, mocking me, taunting me with their knowledge. I became a prisoner of the house, my life reduced to a ceaseless search for answers that eluded me.\n\nThe trains continued to roar past, their noise a constant reminder of the world outside, a world I no longer belonged to. I was trapped in the Triangle Zone, a place where reality blurred and dreams became nightmares. I saw Elena in my dreams, her face framed by the soft glow of twilight, her eyes filled with a sadness I could not comprehend.\n\nOne night, as the wind howled and the trains thundered, I found myself in the attic once more. The circular window offered no solace, only a view of darkness and shadows. I stood before the wall, my fingers tracing the outline of the invisible door, and for a moment, I felt a connection, a pull that drew me closer.\n\nI stepped through the wall, into a world of whispers and shadows, a world where the secrets of the Triangle Zone were laid bare. I saw Elena, her form shimmering in the twilight, her eyes filled with a quiet understanding.\n\n\"You found me,\" she said, her voice a soft echo in the silence.\n\n\"I couldn't leave you,\" I replied, my heart aching with the weight of our separation.\n\nShe smiled, a sad, wistful smile. \"The house... it's not just a house. It's a passage, a gateway to another realm. We're part of it now, part of its secrets.\"\n\nI took her hand, feeling the warmth of her touch, the solidity of her presence. \"We'll face it together,\" I said, my voice steady.\n\nAnd so, we walked through the corridors of the Triangle Zone, our footsteps echoing in the silence, our hearts bound by the mystery that had drawn us in. The house watched over us, its whispers a constant reminder of the secrets it held, but we were no longer afraid. We had found each other, and in that, we had found our truth.\n\nThe trains continued to roar past, their noise a distant hum, a reminder of the world we had left behind. We were part of the Triangle Zone now, its secrets our own, its mysteries a part of our story. And in the quiet moments, when the whispers faded and the shadows danced, we knew that we were home.",
        "story_b": "The wedge-shaped house had seemed like a stroke of luck, a rare find in the chaotic urban sprawl, tucked sharply between two roaring train lines. When we first saw it, the sharp angles and peculiar architecture intrigued us more than it deterred. \"It's quirky,\" I had said, my voice slightly raised to cut through the thunder of an afternoon freight train. \"And the rent is unbeatable.\" \n\nMy partner, Alex, had nodded, eyes wide with the possibility of what this new space might hold for us. The house, with its odd shape and low cost, seemed to whisper promises of a fresh start, a place where we could build our life together without the crushing weight of financial burdens. We signed the lease, excitement bubbling within us, ready to make the house our own.\n\nAt first, the excitement of unpacking and arranging our things filled the narrow, angular rooms with a tangible energy. We laughed as we squeezed our sofa into the living room, maneuvering it around the acute corners, and celebrated with takeout on the floor, the trains providing a rhythmic backdrop to our evening. The wedge-shaped house, with its peculiar geometry, was our new adventure, a story we were eager to tell.\n\nAs the months rolled by, however, the novelty began to wane, replaced by a subtle undercurrent of something else, something we couldn't quite name. The house, we soon realized, was full of sounds. Not just the trains, which we had expected, but other noises\u2014strange creaks and groans that seemed to emanate from the walls themselves. At night, as we lay in bed, it was as if the house was stretching, sighing, settling into itself, or perhaps shifting in ways we couldn't see.\n\n\"The house has character,\" Alex would say with a smile, trying to dismiss the unease that sometimes shadowed our conversations. But there was something about the way the light filtered through the narrow windows, casting odd shadows that stretched and bent, which made me feel as though the house was watching us, learning us.\n\nThe rooms, too, seemed to change. One day the kitchen felt cramped and suffocating, the next it was expansive, a cavernous space that swallowed us whole. The living room, where we spent most of our time, seemed to hold its breath when we entered, a heavy silence that hung between us. And then there were the objects\u2014small things like keys and pens\u2014that would vanish, only to reappear in unexpected places, as if the house was playing tricks on us.\n\nDespite these oddities, we settled into a routine. Our lives, like the trains, had a rhythm\u2014a pattern that was comforting in its predictability. We navigated the quirks of the Triangle Zone with a growing acceptance, adapting to the peculiarities of our home.\n\nBut as the seasons changed, so did we. The winter was harsh, the wind howling through the narrow gaps, chilling the air inside. It was during those long, cold months that I noticed a shift in Alex. They became distant, their laughter less frequent, their eyes often lost in thought. I wondered if the house was affecting them more than they let on, if the strange noises and shifting spaces were unsettling them as they were me.\n\nOne evening, as the snow fell thick and silent outside, I found Alex standing in a room we seldom used. It was a room at the very tip of the wedge, a space so narrow and triangular it was almost impractical. The walls were lined with shelves cluttered with forgotten items left by previous tenants\u2014a jumble of books, knick-knacks, and dusty photographs. The air was thick with the scent of age and neglect.\n\n\"What are you doing in here?\" I asked, stepping into the room. The floorboards creaked beneath my weight, a sound like a whisper that seemed to echo in the narrow space.\n\nAlex turned, a photograph in their hand. \"I was just looking,\" they said, their voice soft, distant. \"This place... it holds stories, don't you think?\"\n\nI nodded, though I wasn't sure what they meant. The room felt heavy with the past, the objects around us like ghosts of those who had lived here before. I glanced at the photograph Alex held\u2014it was an old black-and-white image of a couple standing in front of the house, their faces blurred with time.\n\n\"Do you ever wonder why the rent is so low?\" Alex asked suddenly, their eyes meeting mine. \"What if there's something about this place, something we're not seeing?\"\n\nI hesitated, the question hanging between us like a shadow. I had wondered, of course, but had always dismissed the thought as paranoia. \"It's just a house,\" I said, though my words felt hollow even as I spoke them. \"It's just... different.\"\n\nBut even as I said it, I knew it wasn't true. The house was more than different. It was alive in ways I couldn't explain, its walls pulsing with a strange energy that seeped into our lives.\n\nSpring came slowly, the thaw revealing the hidden world beneath the snow. The trains continued their relentless passage, their roar a constant reminder of the world beyond our narrow walls. But inside, the air was thick with something unspoken, a tension that had grown between us like a creeping vine.\n\nOne night, as the rain beat against the windows, I woke to find Alex missing from our bed. Panic bubbled up within me, and I stumbled through the darkened house, the shadows stretching long and thin in the dim light. I found them in the triangular room, seated on the floor amidst the clutter, their face illuminated by the pale glow of a single lamp.\n\n\"Alex?\" I called softly, my voice barely audible above the rain. \"What are you doing?\"\n\nThey looked up, their eyes tired but clear. \"I can't sleep,\" they said simply. \"The house... it feels different tonight.\"\n\nI knelt beside them, the floor cold beneath me. \"Different how?\"\n\n\"Like it's trying to tell us something,\" Alex said, their voice a whisper. \"Like it wants us to understand.\"\n\nWe sat there in silence, the rain a gentle lullaby against the roof, the house around us breathing softly. I listened, trying to hear what Alex heard, trying to feel what they felt. And slowly, as the minutes ticked by, I began to understand.\n\nThe house was a reflection, a mirror of our own lives. Its shifting walls and changing spaces mirrored the distance growing between us, the unease that had settled in our hearts. The strange occurrences, the noises, the vanished objects\u2014they were the house's way of communicating, of reaching out to us.\n\n\"It's not just about the rent, is it?\" I said finally, my voice barely above a whisper. \"This place... it's more than that.\"\n\nAlex nodded, a small smile playing on their lips. \"It's like it's challenging us, pushing us to see what's really important.\"\n\nWe stayed there, wrapped in the stillness of the night, the house around us a living, breathing entity. In that moment, I realized that the Triangle Zone was not just a strange, wedge-shaped house, but a catalyst for change, a place that forced us to confront our fears and insecurities.\n\nAs the rain eased and the first light of dawn crept through the windows, I knew that the house had given us something invaluable. It had shown us the cracks in our relationship, the places where we needed to grow and mend. It had challenged us to see beyond the surface, to look deeper into ourselves and each other.\n\nThe wedge-shaped house, with its low rent and peculiarities, had become a part of us, a chapter in our story. It had tested us, shaped us, and ultimately, brought us closer together.\n\nAnd as we rose to face the new day, I knew that whatever secrets the Triangle Zone held, we would face them together, hand in hand, ready to embrace the mystery of our shared journey.",

He stood up and dusted himself off before Severus stopped him.\n\u201cDon't do that, you are dirtying the floor,\u201d Severus admonished, waving his wand to vanish the ash. \u201cHow is Mr. Weasley?\u201d\nHarry had gone to visit Mr. Weasley at St. Mungo's.\n\u201cStill bleeding,\u201d Harry said, \u201cbut he's much better. The healers are confident he'll live.\u201d\n\u201cI'll keep working,\u201d reminded Severus.\nHarry nodded. \u201cI know. Thanks, Severus.\u201d\nSeverus nodded, then to Harry\u2019s surprise, led him to the sofa. On the table were a couple cups of tea, along with a bunch of Harry\u2019s favourite treats. Far from relaxing him, the sight made Harry even more worried.\n\u201cSeverus, what's up?\u201d\nSeverus seemed to hesitate, mixing sugar with deliberation and putting a couple of coffee biscuits on his plate. Severus didn't like coffee.\nFinally, Severus sat down on the wingback chair opposite and looked at Harry with the blank expression Harry used to associate with the Potions Master till last year.\n\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d Severus said, and Harry rolled his eyes.\n\u201cYou don't say?\u201d\nSeverus didn't even glare at Harry, and Harry felt the dread in his heart build up.\n\u201cBefore I begin, I want you to know that,\u201d Severus began, a faint trembling in his voice Harry only heard because he knew Severus so well, \u201cIf I could turn back time and undo what I\u2019ve done\u2026\u201d\nSeverus trailed off, looking at his cup, and Harry grabbed a ginger biscuit and bit into it aggressively.

It should have never come to this point\u2026\u201d\nHe said the last part to himself, and Harry felt the first stirring of anger within him.\n\u201cYou don't have to, you know,\u201d Harry said coldly. \u201cI can go back to the Dursleys if you want. I'm sure I can survive a few more years.\u201d\nSeverus stared at Harry in surprise. \u201cWhat\u2014\u00a0 that's not what I meant! I just meant\u2014\u201d He cut himself off with a groan and put his head in his hands. \u201cI cannot do this.\u201d\n\u201cThat's good,\u201d Harry declared. \u201cCause I'm not going anywhere.\u201d\nIf possible, Severus looked back up with an increasingly mournful look. \u201cSee?

Harry could do no more than stare at Severus with his mouth hanging open, not having expected that outburst.\n\u201cSo you're saying you regret coming to care for me? Harry said, staring at Severus, who had begun shaking his head, looking at Harry with an imploring look. \u201cThat perhaps you had told Dumbledore and dusted your hand off me? That, ultimately,\nI'm\nmore trouble than I'm worth?\u201d\nThat, more than anything, seemed to snap Severus out of his melancholy. For the first time that evening, Harry saw a hint of the man he'd come to know, as Severus carefully sat down his cup and came to sit next to Harry on the couch. Harry turned to look at him.\n\u201cThat was uncalled for, I apologise,\u201d Severus said, then nodded at Harry's doubtful look. \u201cWhen I said it shouldn't have come to this, I meant us growing closer and coming to care for each other without you knowing the full truth.\u201d\nHarry was almost afraid to breathe, but he had to know. \u201cWhat full truth?\u201d\nWhat had Severus in such a state?\nThen Severus told him everything. About his mother and the prophecy and the part he played in it, and his vow and subsequent effort to keep Harry safe. Harry didn't say a word, listening to Snape raptly, who was speaking almost as if he had forgotten Harry was there.\n\u201cAnd, when I found out about the Dursleys, I planned to go to Dumbledore, but he waved away my concerns. I let him placate me, but your hand was the last straw.\u201d\nHarry's eyes darted to his scarred hand then back to Severus\u2019 face, who was still speaking.\n\u201cand last year's tournament weighed heavily on my mind, and could I really ignore the danger you were in? After all, a little help wouldn't hurt anything. I could help you then we could part ways, pretending that nothing had happened, and I could continue paying my recompense by serving the Dark Lord. But now\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNow?\u201d Harry whispered pleadingly, not sure what he wanted. Apologies? Assurance?\n\u201cI don't think I can lie to the Dark Lord any longer,\u201d Severus confessed. \u201cLove leaves marks, and I've only ever loved Lily as much as I love you now. Not even the strongest Occlumency shields will hide that. My only question is, what do you want to do? I understand if you'd never want to associate with me. I should have given you the choice \u2014\u201d\nHe cut himself off as he finally dared to look at Harry's face, only to see tears freely flowing down his cheeks.\n\u201cI'm sorry,\u201d Severus whispered, then fell silent, awaiting Harry's judgement.\nHarry aggressively wiped the tears from his cheeks and stood up.\n\u201cI'm sorry, I can't do this now,\u201d he choked out, shaking his head as Severus made to interrupt him. \u201cI'm angry, don't get me wrong, but I\ncan't\nignore the last few months. I\nwon't.\u201d\nhe finally looked at Severus. \u201cI'll forgive you. Not yet, but I will. I think you deserve that much.\u201d\nWith that, Harry left for his room, Severus staring after him.",
        "story_a": "The dungeons were colder than usual, or perhaps it was the weight of the words that had just been spoken hanging in the air. Harry Potter stood frozen, his green eyes wide and uncomprehending as he stared at Severus Snape.\n\n\"I was the one who told Voldemort about the prophecy,\" Snape had said, his voice flat, almost detached, as if he were reciting a potion recipe rather than revealing a secret that could shatter lives. \"I am the reason your parents are dead.\"\n\nHarry's heart pounded in his chest, a deafening roar in his ears. He felt as though the floor had dropped out from under him, plunging him into a void of confusion and betrayal. How could this man, this complex, enigmatic figure who had saved his life more times than he could count, be the cause of his greatest pain?\n\n\"Why now?\" Harry asked, his voice barely above a whisper. \"Why tell me this now, after everything?\"\n\nSnape's dark eyes, usually so guarded, were uncharacteristically open, revealing a depth of sorrow and regret that took Harry aback. \"Because you deserve the truth, Potter. Because you need to understand the full extent of my failures, my mistakes.

I lost everything.\"\n\nThe raw, unfiltered emotion in Snape's voice cut through Harry's anger and confusion, leaving behind a profound sense of sadness.

        "story_b": "The storm raged outside Hogwarts, lightning illuminating the darkened corridors as Harry Potter made his way towards the dungeons. The flickering candlelight cast long shadows that danced eerily along the stone walls. He could feel the tension in the air, a tangible presence that seemed to mirror his own internal turmoil. He clenched his fists, trying to steady his racing heart. How could he trust a man who had once been his enemy?\n\nHarry\u2019s footsteps echoed as he neared Snape\u2019s office, the anticipation tightening in his chest. Over the past months, they had grown closer, an unlikely camaraderie formed through mutual respect and shared battles. But tonight, Snape had summoned him with an urgency that promised revelation\u2014one that left Harry both hopeful and apprehensive.\n\nHe knocked on the heavy wooden door, the sound swallowed by the storm. It swung open without a word, revealing Snape seated behind his desk, the shadows playing across his sallow face. The room was dimly lit, the only illumination coming from a solitary candle that flickered precariously, casting a warm glow over the cluttered shelves of potions and artifacts.\n\n\u201cPotter,\u201d Snape greeted, his voice a low rumble that seemed to harmonize with the thunder outside. \u201cSit.\u201d\n\nHarry obliged, taking the chair opposite Snape, feeling the weight of the moment settle over him. Snape\u2019s eyes bore into his, a storm of their own brewing within their depths.\n\n\u201cThere is something you must know,\u201d Snape began, his tone uncharacteristically hesitant. \u201cA truth long hidden, one that may change your perspective on the past\u2014and on me.\u201d\n\nHarry swallowed, the anticipation knotting in his stomach. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nSnape looked away, the candlelight casting sharp angles on his face. \u201cDuring my time as a Death Eater, I made choices\u2014grave mistakes that haunt me to this day. But there is one in particular\u2026 one that involves your mother.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s heart skipped a beat, his mother\u2019s image flashing before his eyes. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nSnape took a deep breath, his gaze returning to Harry, steady and solemn. \u201cI was the one who revealed the prophecy to Voldemort. It is because of my actions that your parents were targeted.\u201d\n\nThe words hung in the air, heavy and unyielding. Harry\u2019s mind reeled, a whirlwind of emotions threatening to overtake him. Anger, betrayal, disbelief\u2014each vying for dominance. He clenched his fists tighter, his knuckles turning white.\n\n\u201cHow could you?\u201d The question burst forth, raw and accusatory. \u201cHow could you betray them like that?\u201d\n\nSnape flinched, a rare vulnerability crossing his features before he masked it with his usual stoicism. \u201cI was a different man then, driven by ambition and blinded by my own darkness. I have spent every day since trying to atone for that mistake.\u201d\n\nHarry stared at him, searching for any sign of deceit, but all he found was an earnest regret that tugged at the edges of his resolve. Could he trust this man, this former enemy who had saved his life more times than he could count? The man who had protected him, guided him, and, in his own twisted way, cared for him?\n\nThe storm outside seemed to echo his internal conflict, each clap of thunder a reminder of the tumultuous path that lay before him. \u201cWhy tell me now?\u201d Harry asked, his voice strained.\n\n\u201cBecause you deserve the truth,\u201d Snape replied, his tone earnest. \u201cAnd because I\u2026 I need you to understand that despite my past, I have always strived to protect you.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s mind flashed back to countless memories\u2014Snape\u2019s curt instructions, his sardonic remarks, the quiet moments of unexpected kindness. He had always been a contradiction, a man of shadows and light, whose true intentions were as elusive as the swirling mist beyond the castle walls.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can forgive you,\u201d Harry admitted, his words laced with uncertainty. \u201cBut I can\u2019t forget what you\u2019ve done for me, either.\u201d\n\nSnape nodded, a flicker of something\u2014hope, perhaps\u2014crossing his face. \u201cThat is more than I deserve.\u201d\n\nA silence settled between them, the storm outside tapering off to a gentle patter. In that moment, Harry made a choice\u2014not of forgiveness, but of understanding. He realized that Snape\u2019s past, though marred by mistakes, did not define the man he had become. It was a realization that brought a measure of peace to his conflicted heart.\n\n\u201cI want to know more,\u201d Harry said finally, his voice steady. \u201cAbout you, about my mum\u2026 everything.\u201d\n\nSnape\u2019s expression softened, a rare smile ghosting his lips. \u201cVery well, Potter. But know this\u2014it will not be easy.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded, feeling a strange sense of camaraderie with the man before him. They were both survivors of a war that had shaped their lives in ways they could not fully comprehend. And perhaps, in understanding each other, they could find a way to heal the wounds of the past.\n\nAs they spoke, the candle burned low, casting a warm glow over their conversation. It was a symbol, Harry realized, of the fragile bond they had built\u2014a bond that, despite the shadows of the past, had the potential to endure. The storm had passed, leaving behind a calm that promised new beginnings, and Harry found himself hopeful for what lay ahead.\n\nIn the depths of Hogwarts, amidst the shadows and flickering light, two unlikely allies began to forge a path towards redemption and understanding, united by a shared history and an unspoken promise of trust.",

He stood up and dusted himself off before Severus stopped him.\n\u201cDon't do that, you are dirtying the floor,\u201d Severus admonished, waving his wand to vanish the ash. \u201cHow is Mr. Weasley?\u201d\nHarry had gone to visit Mr. Weasley at St. Mungo's.\n\u201cStill bleeding,\u201d Harry said, \u201cbut he's much better. The healers are confident he'll live.\u201d\n\u201cI'll keep working,\u201d reminded Severus.\nHarry nodded. \u201cI know. Thanks, Severus.\u201d\nSeverus nodded, then to Harry\u2019s surprise, led him to the sofa. On the table were a couple cups of tea, along with a bunch of Harry\u2019s favourite treats. Far from relaxing him, the sight made Harry even more worried.\n\u201cSeverus, what's up?\u201d\nSeverus seemed to hesitate, mixing sugar with deliberation and putting a couple of coffee biscuits on his plate. Severus didn't like coffee.\nFinally, Severus sat down on the wingback chair opposite and looked at Harry with the blank expression Harry used to associate with the Potions Master till last year.\n\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d Severus said, and Harry rolled his eyes.\n\u201cYou don't say?\u201d\nSeverus didn't even glare at Harry, and Harry felt the dread in his heart build up.\n\u201cBefore I begin, I want you to know that,\u201d Severus began, a faint trembling in his voice Harry only heard because he knew Severus so well, \u201cIf I could turn back time and undo what I\u2019ve done\u2026\u201d\nSeverus trailed off, looking at his cup, and Harry grabbed a ginger biscuit and bit into it aggressively. Severus still hadn't spoken by the time the crumbs had disappeared from Harry's mouth, so Harry interrupted the silence.\n\u201cSeverus, you're scaring me.\u201d\nHe tried to make it come out forcefully, but he couldn't stop the pleading tone entering his voice.\nSeverus looked up with a pained expression. \u201cNot enough, in my opinion. It should have never come to this point\u2026\u201d\nHe said the last part to himself, and Harry felt the first stirring of anger within him.\n\u201cYou don't have to, you know,\u201d Harry said coldly. \u201cI can go back to the Dursleys if you want. I'm sure I can survive a few more years.\u201d\nSeverus stared at Harry in surprise. \u201cWhat\u2014\u00a0 that's not what I meant! I just meant\u2014\u201d He cut himself off with a groan and put his head in his hands. \u201cI cannot do this.\u201d\n\u201cThat's good,\u201d Harry declared. \u201cCause I'm not going anywhere.\u201d\nIf possible, Severus looked back up with an increasingly mournful look. \u201cSee? That's what I meant! You weren't supposed to barge in here so that we could play Happy Families! I was supposed to get you out of\nthat\nhouse and not think any more of it, and definitely was not supposed to\u2014 supposed to\u2026\ncare\n,\u201d Severus whispered the last word as if it were some scandalous word. Harry could do no more than stare at Severus with his mouth hanging open, not having expected that outburst.\n\u201cSo you're saying you regret coming to care for me? Harry said, staring at Severus, who had begun shaking his head, looking at Harry with an imploring look. \u201cThat perhaps you had told Dumbledore and dusted your hand off me? That, ultimately,\nI'm\nmore trouble than I'm worth?\u201d\nThat, more than anything, seemed to snap Severus out of his melancholy.

        "story_b": "The flickering candlelight cast long shadows across the stone walls of Snape's office, a sanctuary of secrecy and solitude nestled deep within the bowels of Hogwarts. Harry sat across from Snape, the silence between them thick and suffocating. The room, usually a cocoon of quietude where Harry found unexpected solace, now felt like a crucible of tension.\n\nSnape had been unusually quiet, even for him, his dark eyes flickering with a storm of emotions as unreadable as the potions simmering on the shelves. Harry sensed the crackling unease, an electric charge in the air that made the hairs on his arms stand on end. He had come to expect their meetings to be full of curt exchanges and begrudging respect, but today the silence screamed louder than any argument.\n\n\u201cPotter,\u201d Snape began, his voice a hoarse whisper that barely broke the oppressive quiet. The use of Harry\u2019s surname was a shield, a thin veneer of formality that failed to mask the vulnerability beneath. \u201cThere is something you must know.\u201d\n\nThe words hung between them, heavy and foreboding. Harry felt a knot tighten in his stomach, a tangled web of confusion and apprehension. He had grown to trust Snape, to see him not just as a former adversary but as a complicated man with layers of regret and redemption. Yet, here was a truth that threatened to unravel everything.\n\n\u201cI owe you an explanation,\u201d Snape continued, his eyes avoiding Harry\u2019s, instead fixating on a spot on the wall. \u201cAbout my past. About...your mother.\u201d\n\nThe mention of his mother sent a jolt through Harry, a mix of longing and loss. Lily Potter was a specter that haunted his life, her memory a beacon of love and sacrifice. To hear Snape speak of her now, with such gravity, was unsettling.\n\n\u201cYour mother and I,\u201d Snape paused, drawing a deep breath as if steeling himself against an invisible tide, \u201cwe were friends. Once. She was... she was everything I was not. Kind, brave, compassionate. I loved her, Harry, more than I have ever loved anyone.\u201d\n\nThe admission cracked something in Snape, his voice breaking as he laid bare this piece of himself. Harry watched, his heart pounding, as Snape\u2019s carefully constructed facade crumbled. He had never seen Snape so exposed, so human.\n\n\u201cBut I failed her,\u201d Snape continued, his voice a low tremor. \u201cIn ways that are unforgivable. I was blinded by my own bitterness, my own ambition. I chose a path that led me away from her, that contributed to her death.\u201d\n\nThe room seemed to close in around Harry, the weight of the revelation pressing down on him. He felt the sting of betrayal, the sharp edge of anger cutting through the fog of his mind. How could he reconcile this Snape, the man who had protected him, with the one whose choices had indirectly led to his parents\u2019 deaths?\n\n\u201cWhy tell me now?\u201d Harry asked, his voice a mix of disbelief and hurt. \u201cWhy risk everything we\u2019ve built?\u201d\n\nSnape met his gaze then, his eyes dark pools of sincerity and regret. \u201cBecause you deserve the truth. Because I cannot ask for your trust without earning it, and you cannot truly know me if you do not know this.\u201d\n\nThe honesty in Snape\u2019s words pierced through Harry\u2019s anger, leaving behind a raw ache of understanding. Trust was a delicate thing, a fragile thread that could bind or break. Harry had learned that lesson time and again, and now he faced it anew.\n\nA silence stretched between them, not the oppressive silence of before, but something softer, more tentative. Harry grappled with his emotions, the tumultuous swirl of confusion and betrayal giving way to a burgeoning sense of clarity.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d Harry admitted, his voice quiet, almost lost in the cavernous room.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything,\u201d Snape replied, his tone gentler than Harry had ever heard. \u201cIt is enough that you listen. That you know.\u201d\n\nHarry nodded, the gesture small but significant. He realized then that understanding was not about excusing the past but acknowledging it, about seeing the whole of a person\u2014their faults and their virtues. Snape had laid bare his soul, and in doing so, offered Harry a choice.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d Harry began, hesitating, \u201cI think I\u2019m beginning to understand. Trust isn\u2019t simple. It\u2019s messy and complicated. But maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\nSnape\u2019s eyes softened, a flicker of relief passing through them. \u201cIndeed, Potter. Indeed.\u201d\n\nAs the candle flickered and the shadows danced, Harry felt the storm within him begin to calm. He knew the path ahead would not be easy, that forgiveness was a journey fraught with challenges. But sitting here, in this dimly lit office, he saw a glimmer of hope\u2014a chance to rebuild, to forge a bond not in spite of the past, but because of it.\n\nHarry stood, the weight of the revelation still pressing on him, yet he felt lighter somehow. He met Snape\u2019s gaze, a silent promise passing between them. This was not the end, but a new beginning, a step towards understanding and redemption.\n\nAs he left the office, the door closing softly behind him, Harry felt a sense of resolve. Trust was not about forgetting the past but learning from it. And perhaps, just perhaps, he and Snape could find a way forward\u2014together.",

He stood up and dusted himself off before Severus stopped him.\n\u201cDon't do that, you are dirtying the floor,\u201d Severus admonished, waving his wand to vanish the ash. \u201cHow is Mr. Weasley?\u201d\nHarry had gone to visit Mr. Weasley at St. Mungo's.\n\u201cStill bleeding,\u201d Harry said, \u201cbut he's much better. The healers are confident he'll live.\u201d\n\u201cI'll keep working,\u201d reminded Severus.\nHarry nodded. \u201cI know. Thanks, Severus.\u201d\nSeverus nodded, then to Harry\u2019s surprise, led him to the sofa. On the table were a couple cups of tea, along with a bunch of Harry\u2019s favourite treats. Far from relaxing him, the sight made Harry even more worried.\n\u201cSeverus, what's up?\u201d\nSeverus seemed to hesitate, mixing sugar with deliberation and putting a couple of coffee biscuits on his plate. Severus didn't like coffee.\nFinally, Severus sat down on the wingback chair opposite and looked at Harry with the blank expression Harry used to associate with the Potions Master till last year.\n\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d Severus said, and Harry rolled his eyes.\n\u201cYou don't say?\u201d\nSeverus didn't even glare at Harry, and Harry felt the dread in his heart build up.\n\u201cBefore I begin, I want you to know that,\u201d Severus began, a faint trembling in his voice Harry only heard because he knew Severus so well, \u201cIf I could turn back time and undo what I\u2019ve done\u2026\u201d\nSeverus trailed off, looking at his cup, and Harry grabbed a ginger biscuit and bit into it aggressively. Severus still hadn't spoken by the time the crumbs had disappeared from Harry's mouth, so Harry interrupted the silence.\n\u201cSeverus, you're scaring me.\u201d\nHe tried to make it come out forcefully, but he couldn't stop the pleading tone entering his voice.\nSeverus looked up with a pained expression. \u201cNot enough, in my opinion. It should have never come to this point\u2026\u201d\nHe said the last part to himself, and Harry felt the first stirring of anger within him.\n\u201cYou don't have to, you know,\u201d Harry said coldly. \u201cI can go back to the Dursleys if you want. I'm sure I can survive a few more years.\u201d\nSeverus stared at Harry in surprise. \u201cWhat\u2014\u00a0 that's not what I meant! I just meant\u2014\u201d He cut himself off with a groan and put his head in his hands. \u201cI cannot do this.\u201d\n\u201cThat's good,\u201d Harry declared. \u201cCause I'm not going anywhere.\u201d\nIf possible, Severus looked back up with an increasingly mournful look. \u201cSee? That's what I meant! You weren't supposed to barge in here so that we could play Happy Families! I was supposed to get you out of\nthat\nhouse and not think any more of it, and definitely was not supposed to\u2014 supposed to\u2026\ncare\n,\u201d Severus whispered the last word as if it were some scandalous word. Harry could do no more than stare at Severus with his mouth hanging open, not having expected that outburst.\n\u201cSo you're saying you regret coming to care for me? Harry said, staring at Severus, who had begun shaking his head, looking at Harry with an imploring look. \u201cThat perhaps you had told Dumbledore and dusted your hand off me? That, ultimately,\nI'm\nmore trouble than I'm worth?\u201d\nThat, more than anything, seemed to snap Severus out of his melancholy. For the first time that evening, Harry saw a hint of the man he'd come to know, as Severus carefully sat down his cup and came to sit next to Harry on the couch. Harry turned to look at him.\n\u201cThat was uncalled for, I apologise,\u201d Severus said, then nodded at Harry's doubtful look. \u201cWhen I said it shouldn't have come to this, I meant us growing closer and coming to care for each other without you knowing the full truth.\u201d\nHarry was almost afraid to breathe, but he had to know. \u201cWhat full truth?\u201d\nWhat had Severus in such a state?\nThen Severus told him everything. About his mother and the prophecy and the part he played in it, and his vow and subsequent effort to keep Harry safe. Harry didn't say a word, listening to Snape raptly, who was speaking almost as if he had forgotten Harry was there.\n\u201cAnd, when I found out about the Dursleys, I planned to go to Dumbledore, but he waved away my concerns. I let him placate me, but your hand was the last straw.\u201d\nHarry's eyes darted to his scarred hand then back to Severus\u2019 face, who was still speaking.\n\u201cand last year's tournament weighed heavily on my mind, and could I really ignore the danger you were in? After all, a little help wouldn't hurt anything. I could help you then we could part ways, pretending that nothing had happened, and I could continue paying my recompense by serving the Dark Lord. But now\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNow?\u201d Harry whispered pleadingly, not sure what he wanted. Apologies? Assurance?\n\u201cI don't think I can lie to the Dark Lord any longer,\u201d Severus confessed. \u201cLove leaves marks, and I've only ever loved Lily as much as I love you now. Not even the strongest Occlumency shields will hide that. My only question is, what do you want to do? I understand if you'd never want to associate with me. I should have given you the choice \u2014\u201d\nHe cut himself off as he finally dared to look at Harry's face, only to see tears freely flowing down his cheeks.\n\u201cI'm sorry,\u201d Severus whispered, then fell silent, awaiting Harry's judgement.\nHarry aggressively wiped the tears from his cheeks and stood up.\n\u201cI'm sorry, I can't do this now,\u201d he choked out, shaking his head as Severus made to interrupt him. \u201cI'm angry, don't get me wrong, but I\ncan't\nignore the last few months. I\nwon't.\u201d\nhe finally looked at Severus. \u201cI'll forgive you. Not yet, but I will. I think you deserve that much.\u201d\nWith that, Harry left for his room, Severus staring after him.",
        "story_a": "The dungeons were colder than usual, or perhaps it was the weight of the words that had just been spoken hanging in the air. Harry Potter stood frozen, his green eyes wide and uncomprehending as he stared at Severus Snape.\n\n\"I was the one who told Voldemort about the prophecy,\" Snape had said, his voice flat, almost detached, as if he were reciting a potion recipe rather than revealing a secret that could shatter lives. \"I am the reason your parents are dead.\"\n\nHarry's heart pounded in his chest, a deafening roar in his ears. He felt as though the floor had dropped out from under him, plunging him into a void of confusion and betrayal. How could this man, this complex, enigmatic figure who had saved his life more times than he could count, be the cause of his greatest pain?\n\n\"Why now?\" Harry asked, his voice barely above a whisper. \"Why tell me this now, after everything?\"\n\nSnape's dark eyes, usually so guarded, were uncharacteristically open, revealing a depth of sorrow and regret that took Harry aback. \"Because you deserve the truth, Potter. Because you need to understand the full extent of my failures, my mistakes. And because... because I owe it to you.\"\n\nThe silence that followed was heavy, laden with the weight of unspoken emotions and the ghosts of the past. Harry's mind raced, memories of his parents' smiling faces, the warmth of their love, and the cold, unyielding reality of their loss flashing before him.\n\n\"All this time,\" Harry said slowly, his voice trembling, \"you've been protecting me. But it was because of you that I needed protection in the first place.\"\n\nSnape flinched, the words striking him like a physical blow. \"Yes,\" he admitted, his voice thick with self-loathing. \"I have tried to atone for my sins, but I know that nothing I do can ever bring them back.\"\n\nHarry took a step closer, his gaze never leaving Snape's face. \"You loved my mum,\" he said, not a question, but a statement of fact that he had come to understand over the past months. \"That's why you did everything you did.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Snape whispered, his voice breaking. \"Lily was my everything, and in my desperation, I lost her. I lost everything.\"\n\nThe raw, unfiltered emotion in Snape's voice cut through Harry's anger and confusion, leaving behind a profound sense of sadness. He realized that Snape's torment was a reflection of his own, a shared pain that bound them together in ways he had never imagined.\n\n\"I don't know if I can ever forgive you,\" Harry said, his voice soft but steady. \"But I do know that you've changed. You've tried to make up for what you did, even when it meant risking your life.\"\n\nSnape nodded, a single tear slipping down his cheek. \"I have lived with my guilt every day, Potter. And I will continue to do so for the rest of my life.\"\n\nHarry took a deep breath, the enormity of the revelation settling over him like a heavy cloak. \"We can't change the past,\" he said finally. \"But we can try to move forward. Together.\"\n\nSnape looked at Harry, a flicker of hope in his eyes. \"Do you truly mean that, Potter?\"\n\nHarry nodded. \"Yes, I do. We've both suffered enough. It's time to start healing, for both of us.\"\n\nIn that moment, the bond between them, fragile and tenuous as it was, began to strengthen. They stood together in the cold, dark dungeon, united by their shared pain and their determination to find a way forward.\n\nThe journey ahead would not be easy, and the scars of the past would never fully fade. But Harry knew that they could face whatever came their way, as long as they faced it together.\n\nAnd perhaps, in the end, that was all that truly mattered.\n\n---\n\nTags: #Severus Snape Redemption #Hurt/Comfort #Emotional Baggage #Healing #Harry Potter & Severus Snape Bonding #Canon Divergence #Bittersweet Ending #Unexpected Allies #Past Mistakes #Reconciliation #Shared Pain #Dark Dungeons & Darker Secrets #Hope Amidst Despair #Forgiveness #Atonement",
        "story_b": "The Potions classroom was dimly lit, the flickering candlelight casting long shadows that danced across the stone walls. Harry sat at one of the desks, his eyes flickering over the ancient tomes scattered before him. The quiet solitude of the library-like atmosphere usually brought him peace, but tonight, his heart felt heavy, burdened by the weight of Snape's impending confession.\n\nHarry's mind was a whirlwind of confusion and disbelief, yet a part of him clung to the hope that Snape's intentions were genuine. After months of tentative trust and shared, unspoken understanding, Harry could sense something significant was about to be revealed. He recalled the odd expressions that had crossed Snape's face during their recent conversations\u2014the flickers of hesitation, the rare moments of softness.\n\n\"Harry,\" Snape's voice broke through the silence, pulling Harry from his thoughts. The professor stood at the entrance, his silhouette sharp against the candlelight. Harry nodded, trying to dispel the unease curling in his stomach.\n\n\"Professor,\" Harry replied, his voice steady, though his heart raced.\n\nSnape approached, his movements deliberate, as if each step was carefully measured. He sat opposite Harry, their eyes meeting in a silent exchange. The air between them was thick with unspoken words.\n\n\"I owe you an explanation,\" Snape began, his voice low and somber. Harry's breath caught; the moment he'd been anticipating had finally arrived.\n\n\"What is it?\" Harry asked, his curiosity mingling with a sense of dread.\n\nSnape hesitated, an internal struggle evident in his eyes. \"There are things about my past, Harry, things that I have kept hidden for too long.\"\n\nHarry felt his chest tighten. \"Why are you telling me now?\"\n\n\"Because you deserve the truth,\" Snape replied, his gaze unwavering. \"And because I've come to care about your well-being more than I anticipated.\"\n\nHarry's mind raced, grappling with the revelation. He had spent so long viewing Snape through a lens of suspicion and resentment, yet here was a man who had quietly, steadily become a part of his life\u2014offering guidance, protection, and, in his own way, care. \n\n\"I was a Death Eater,\" Snape confessed, his voice barely above a whisper. The words hung in the air, heavy and ominous.\n\nHarry's heart pounded, a mix of anger and confusion flaring within him. \"Why didn't you tell me sooner?\" he demanded, his voice sharp with hurt. The man he had come to trust, to see as a mentor, was now tangled in the very darkness he'd fought against.\n\nSnape's eyes met Harry's, filled with regret and something akin to pleading. \"I feared losing what little trust we've built,\" he admitted, his voice tinged with vulnerability. \"But I could not continue deceiving you.\"\n\nA tense silence enveloped them, broken only by the soft crackling of the candles. Harry's thoughts spiraled, his emotions a tumultuous storm. He had seen glimpses of kindness in Snape, moments where the man's defenses had slipped, revealing a more complex soul. Yet, the weight of his past actions loomed large.\n\n\"I don't know if I can just... forget,\" Harry confessed, his voice trembling with uncertainty. The man before him was a paradox\u2014both protector and betrayer, ally and adversary.\n\nSnape nodded, his expression solemn. \"I do not expect forgiveness, Harry. Only understanding.\"\n\nThe words resonated within Harry, stirring a flicker of empathy. He considered Snape's past, the choices he'd made in a time of war, and the consequences that lingered like shadows. Slowly, he began to see the man before him not as a villain, but as someone seeking redemption\u2014a soul burdened by the weight of his own mistakes.\n\n\"You've changed,\" Harry acknowledged, his voice softening. \"I can see that.\"\n\nSnape's gaze held Harry's, and for a moment, the years of animosity and mistrust seemed to fade into the background. The room around them transformed, the shadows of the past giving way to a tentative light of understanding.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Snape said, his voice barely audible. The gratitude in his eyes spoke volumes, a silent promise of continued effort and growth.\n\nHarry nodded, a small gesture of acceptance. The road ahead would not be easy, but for the first time, he saw a path forward\u2014one where past grievances did not dictate the future, where redemption was possible through understanding and choice.\n\nIn the surreal, dreamlike atmosphere of the Potions classroom, time felt suspended. Harry found himself reflecting on their journey\u2014how trust had been built, not through grand gestures, but through quiet acts of care and shared moments of vulnerability. He recalled their conversations, the subtle shifts in Snape's demeanor, the rare smiles that had gradually replaced scowls.\n\nAs they sat in silence, Harry felt a sense of peace settling within him. It was a fragile peace, woven from threads of trust and forgiveness, but it was real. For the first time, he saw Snape not as a figure from his nightmares, but as a man seeking redemption\u2014a man who, like Harry, was trying to find his place in a world that often seemed unforgiving.\n\nHarry rose from his seat, the weight on his heart lifting slightly. \"Let's work together,\" he proposed, a tentative smile playing on his lips. \"Maybe we can both learn from this.\"\n\nSnape's eyes softened, and for the first time, Harry saw a genuine smile\u2014a small, fleeting thing, but it was enough. Together, they stood at the threshold of a new beginning, where the mistakes of the past could be left behind, and the promise of understanding could light their way forward.",

But alas, not all wishes come true.* *In a dimly lit corner of the city, there sat a man named Edward. He was a simple man, with simple desires.

They felt as if they had finally found someone who understood their plight, and the prospect of gaining justice against the elusive creatures that held their fate in their hands. Under the name Candent, a figure reached out to these individuals, offering them the chance to band together and achieve retribution for their unfulfilled desires. They exchanged electronic and postal messages, building a camaraderie and trust among themselves until just a mere few received an invitation to gather at an address in Old Hill, Chislehurst, London, England. Of the few, only a couple dared to arrive at the appointed hour. \"Candent\" was not disappointed by the no-shows, but more delighted that he had found a pair who truly had the courage to follow through. But little did they know, the path they had chosen would be fraught with danger, and the consequences of their actions could prove to be disastrous.",
        "story_a": "The night air was thick with a damp chill that clung to the skin, as if the city itself were breathing in sync with the slow, deliberate pace of your footsteps. The narrow alleyways, lit only by the occasional flicker of a faulty streetlamp, seemed to twist and turn as if guiding you deeper into the labyrinthine heart of the metropolis. Somewhere in the distance, the sound of a siren wailed, a reminder of the unseen dangers lurking in the shadows.\n\nYou rubbed your hands together, feeling the prickle of the scar that marred your left palm. A cruel reminder of the wish that had gone so horribly wrong. You had hoped for a new beginning, a chance to rewrite your story, but the twisted interpretation of your desire had left you with nothing but regret and a lingering sense of betrayal.\n\nIt was in the depths of your despair that you stumbled upon the blog. \"Justice for the Jaded\" it was called, and its posts spoke directly to your wounded soul. Each entry detailed the tales of those wronged by the beings who granted wishes, offering hope and solace to the victims. But it was the promise of justice that truly captivated you. The enigmatic \"Candent\" claimed to have the power to right these wrongs, to exact vengeance on those who perverted dreams into nightmares.\n\nYou had spent countless hours poring over the blog, devouring every word, until one night, an email arrived. The subject line read simply, \"An Invitation.\" The message within was sparse, directing you to a location in the heart of the city and signing off with the single word: Candent.\n\nAnd so here you were, navigating the maze of alleys, your heart pounding with a mixture of anticipation and fear. The address led you to an unassuming door, its paint peeling and the number barely visible in the dim light. You hesitated for a moment, your breath catching in your throat, before raising your hand to knock.\n\nThe door creaked open before your knuckles made contact, revealing a dimly lit room that seemed to stretch on indefinitely. The walls were lined with shelves, each one crammed with dusty tomes and strange artifacts. The air was thick with the scent of old paper and something else, something metallic and sharp.\n\nA figure stepped forward from the shadows, their face obscured by the deep hood of their cloak. \"Welcome,\" the voice was low and resonant, carrying an almost tangible weight. \"I am Candent.\"\n\nYou swallowed hard, your throat dry. \"I received your invitation.\"\n\nCandent nodded, their movements slow and deliberate. \"I know why you are here. You seek revenge against those who twist desires.\"\n\nYou nodded, feeling a surge of anger rise within you. \"They ruined my life. I want them to pay.\"\n\nCandent gestured for you to follow, leading you deeper into the room. As you walked, you noticed the flickering light of candles casting eerie shadows on the walls. \"Revenge is a dangerous path,\" Candent said softly. \"It requires sacrifice and resolve. Are you truly prepared for what lies ahead?\"\n\nYou took a deep breath, steeling yourself. \"I am.\"\n\nCandent stopped before a large, ornate mirror. The surface was cracked, the fractures creating a web of reflections that seemed to shift and shimmer. \"This mirror is a gateway,\" Candent explained. \"It will take you to the realm of the wish-granters. There, you will face trials that will test your strength and determination. Only then can you hope to achieve justice.\"\n\nYou stared at the mirror, your mind racing. The prospect of entering an unknown realm, of facing unimaginable dangers, was daunting. But the memory of your ruined wish, of the pain and loss it had caused, fueled your resolve. \"I'll do it,\" you said firmly.\n\nCandent placed a hand on your shoulder, their grip surprisingly warm and reassuring. \"Remember, the path to justice is fraught with peril. Trust in your conviction, and you may yet prevail.\"\n\nWith a final nod, you stepped toward the mirror, your reflection fracturing and merging with the countless others. As you passed through the glass, the world around you dissolved into a swirl of light and shadow, and you felt a surge of determination. The beings who twisted your desires would face justice. You would see to it, no matter the cost.",

The glow of the screen cast a ghostly pallor across their face, the only light in the dimly lit room. The blog had appeared as if by magic, nestled between mundane links in a web search. \u201cRevenge Against the Twisters,\u201d it proclaimed, and Alex's heart had skipped a beat. \n\nWeeks had passed since their ill-fated wish\u2014a seemingly innocuous request for success that had spiraled into a nightmare. Promotions came with unbearable stress, leaving Alex isolated from friends, burdened by a job that consumed every waking hour. The beings who twisted desires had taken their simple wish and warped it into a gilded cage.\n\nThe blog was cryptic, filled with tales of others who had fallen prey to the same cruel irony. Each post was a vignette of chaos, a testament to the destruction wrought by the wish-twisters. Yet, woven through the despair was a promise\u2014a way to reclaim lost wishes and gain protection from future manipulations. The more Alex read, the more the words seemed to whisper directly to them.\n\nAn invitation arrived, as enigmatic as the blog itself. A meeting with \u201cCandent,\u201d a name that carried both hope and dread. The promise of revenge and the chance to rewrite their fate was tempting. But the risks\u2014they loomed large, shadows lurking at the edge of Alex's consciousness. Could they trust a stranger with such power?\n\nTheir mind raced with professional obligations and personal demons as they prepared for the meeting. The office was a battlefield, each day a struggle to maintain focus as thoughts of vengeance consumed them. Colleagues noticed the change\u2014Alex's once meticulous work was now hurried, punctuated by furtive glances at their phone, anticipating messages from the mysterious network.\n\nAmidst the chaos, the reality of the situation pressed heavily on Alex\u2019s shoulders. The promise of revenge was intoxicating, but what if it led to deeper entanglements with the beings they sought to escape? Fear clashed with desperation, creating an internal conflict that gnawed at their resolve.\n\nThe meeting place was as cryptic as the blog\u2014a forgotten cafe, nestled in the heart of the city where time seemed to stand still. The air was thick with the aroma of roasted beans, mingling with the mustiness of old books lining the walls. Alex hesitated at the threshold, heart pounding with anticipation and dread.\n\nInside, Candent awaited\u2014a figure shrouded in ambiguity, their presence both commanding and unsettling. The conversation that followed danced between humor and gravity, the absurdity of Alex\u2019s situation not lost on them. Candent\u2019s voice was smooth, laced with irony as they recounted tales of the wish-twisters\u2019 internal politics, factions vying for power over human desires.\n\n\u201cNot all of them agree on how to handle humans, you know,\u201d Candent remarked, their eyes glinting with mischief. \u201cSome think your kind too fragile for their games.\u201d\n\nThe dialogue was a chess match, each word chosen with care to unearth motivations and potential alliances. Candent offered insights into the beings\u2019 weaknesses, a tantalizing glimpse at victory. Yet, Alex sensed the danger lurking beneath the surface\u2014a game of manipulation where the stakes were impossibly high.\n\nThe weight of the decision bore down on Alex as they left the cafe, the city lights flickering in the puddles at their feet. Revenge was a powerful motivator, but was it worth the potential cost? The blog had promised justice, a tantalizing reward system designed to lure those who had been wronged. Yet, Alex knew that nothing was ever as simple as it seemed.\n\nThe night air was cool against their skin, the rain a gentle reminder of the reality they faced. Balancing the tangible desire for retribution against the risks of deeper entanglement was a delicate dance. As Alex walked away, the choice lingered in their mind\u2014a tightrope stretched between revenge and redemption, with the promise of reclaiming their destiny hanging in the balance.",

        "story_b": "The air crackled with unspoken promises as I sat hunched over my laptop, staring at the flickering screen. The blog's interface was unlike anything I had seen before\u2014cryptic messages scrolled across the page, each more tantalizing than the last. \"Justice for the twisted,\" it promised, \"an end to the beings who manipulate desires.\" It felt as though the words were meant for me, a beacon in the digital void, calling me to action.\n\nMy heart pounded as I recalled the wish gone wrong. The scars it left were more than emotional; they were etched into my very being. Promises of happiness and fulfillment had turned into a nightmare, a twisted reality that I couldn't escape. And now, this blog, this mysterious invitation\u2014it was as if destiny itself had intervened.\n\nThe invitation was simple: \"Meet Candent. Discover the truth. Unravel the organization.\" It was signed with a flourish, the name \"Candent\" glowing ominously. It felt like a trap, yet the promise of revenge whispered enticingly in my ear.\n\nI wasn't alone in this quest. As I delved deeper into the blog, I discovered others drawn to the same promise of justice. A ragtag group of adventurers, each with their own haunted pasts and singular skills. There was Alex, the tech-savvy hacker who had once been a pawn in the beings' game, now seeking to dismantle their digital realm. Then there was Lila, a disillusioned former wish-granter, seeking redemption for the wishes she had unknowingly twisted. And finally, Max, a skeptical journalist with a personal vendetta, determined to expose the truth to the world.\n\nTogether, we formed an unlikely alliance, united by a shared goal and a mutual distrust of the beings who twisted desires for their own gain. Our mission was clear: confront the beings, expose their secrets, and reclaim the justice they had denied us.\n\nWe met Candent in a shadowy, candle-lit chamber, the air thick with tension and the faint scent of incense lingering. Shadows danced in the corners of the room, and every word felt like a potential trap. Candent was a figure shrouded in mystery, their face obscured by a hood, their voice a melodic whisper that seemed to echo from all directions.\n\n\"You seek justice,\" Candent said, their voice weaving through the room like a silken thread. \"But justice comes at a price. What are you willing to risk?\"\n\n\"What price would you pay for justice?\" the question hung in the air, a challenge that none of us could ignore.\n\nOur resolve was tested in that chamber. The beings we sought to confront were part of a larger, secretive organization, woven into the very fabric of society. Their power dynamics were complex, their influence pervasive. Yet, the promise of glory and the chance to rewrite our destinies outweighed the dangers lurking in the shadows.\n\nAs we embarked on our quest, the boundaries between fantasy and reality blurred. We navigated a hidden underground network where the beings operated, filled with surreal and otherworldly architecture. Advanced technology mixed with mystical elements, creating a world where desires were stored and manipulated, accessible only through the digital realm of the blog.\n\nConflicts arose, both personal and societal. Alex's skills were tested against the beings' digital defenses, while Lila faced the consequences of her past actions. Max uncovered layers of political intrigue, revealing how the beings manipulated desires on a global scale. And I, driven by the emotional scars of my own twisted wish, found empowerment in unity and collaboration.\n\nIn the end, it was our differences that became our strength. Together, we exposed the organization, freeing others from their twisted wishes. The beings were stripped of their power, their secrets laid bare for the world to see.\n\nThe quest for justice had been perilous, but it had brought us together, forging bonds that transcended the scars of the past. As we stood on the precipice of a new beginning, I realized that revenge had been worth the risks. We had not only rewritten our destinies but had also paved the way for a world where desires could no longer be twisted to serve those in power.",

Amidst the hustle and bustle of the streets, there were many who were wishing for a better life. Some yearned for wealth and prosperity, while others craved love and companionship. But alas, not all wishes come true.* *In a dimly lit corner of the city, there sat a man named Edward. He was a simple man, with simple desires. All he wanted was a warm meal and a place to lay his head at night. But despite his best efforts, he had never been able to make ends meet. As he trudged through the streets, his stomach growling with hunger, he couldn't help but feel like the world was against him.* *And then there was Mary. She had always dreamed of finding her soulmate, a man who would cherish her and love her for who she was. But despite her many attempts at love, she had been met with disappointment and heartbreak at every turn. She was beginning to lose hope that she would ever find true love.* *As the night wore on, Edward and Mary found themselves walking along the same path. They didn't know each other, but there was a sense of camaraderie between them. They were both people who had been let down by life, and they found solace in each other's company.* *And then something strange happened. As they walked, they stumbled upon a mysterious figure who offered them each a wish. Edward wished for a warm meal and a place to stay, while Mary wished for a true love that would never leave her side.* *But as the night wore on, they both realized that their wishes had been in vain. Edward's warm meal turned out to be cold, and his place to stay was infested with rats. And Mary's true love turned out to be nothing more than a passing fancy.* *As they sat together, cold and hungry and alone, they realized that sometimes the things we wish for are not the things we truly need.* *It was a story that repeated many times, throughout human history.* *But, sometimes, fools had trusted in magical beings to fulfil their wishes. Seldom did this end well.* *Most, if they lived to regret their decision at all, saw themselves as fighting a power that would always be greater than them.* But one man refused to accept this fate... ---- #Burned by the things you wish for? ---- So read the eye-catching headline of a blog that circulated throughout the vast expanse of the internet.

        "story_b": "It was supposed to be a simple wish. One whispered under a shooting star on a night where the sky seemed to promise endless possibilities. \"Let me succeed where I have failed,\" you had murmured, eyes locked on that fleeting light. But the cosmos, or whatever mischievous entity had been listening, had twisted your words into a cruel jest. The project you had hoped to salvage crumbled spectacularly, your career ambitions reduced to ashes. A scar from a hurried escape from the office building\u2014a jagged line running across your forearm\u2014served as a permanent reminder of that night and its disastrous outcome.\n\nHaunted by the folly of that moment, you found solace in late-night internet wanderings, drifting from one distraction to another until you stumbled upon a blog unlike any you had seen. Its design was otherworldly, a labyrinth of digital whispers and flickering shadows, with cryptic messages embedded in its code. The name \"Candent\" appeared repeatedly, woven through the text like a thread of molten gold.\n\nDespite its eerie allure, there was something about the blog that resonated with you, a promise of justice against those who twist desires. The posts seemed to speak directly to your pain, recounting tales of wishes gone awry and the enigmatic figure who could set things right. It was said that Candent was a shadowy figure, capable of bending reality to their will, offering redemption\u2014or revenge\u2014to those they deemed worthy.\n\nIntrigued, you delved deeper, following hidden links that seemed to alter the very fabric of your screen, morphing the mundane into the mystical. Each post led to another breadcrumb of insight, a puzzle whose pieces formed a picture of hope tinged with danger. Then, one night, an invitation appeared, glowing softly on your monitor, its words clear and compelling:\n\n\"Seek me at the place where shadows dance and whispers linger. Decide if you dare to tread this path. - Candent\"\n\nThe invitation was both a lure and a warning. You felt the weight of it in your chest, a tightness that spoke of both trepidation and excitement. What did you truly desire? Was revenge worth the risks that loomed in the shadows of this mysterious offer?\n\nYou closed your eyes, recalling the skeptical voice of your friend, Sarah, who had warned you against such pursuits. \"You're playing with fire,\" she had said, her eyes wide with concern. \"These things never end well. Let it go.\"\n\nBut Sarah hadn't seen the depths of your despair, the way the scar on your arm seemed to pulse with every beat of your heart, a reminder of your failure and the injustice of it all. Could you truly let go when justice\u2014or perhaps something more\u2014was within reach?\n\nThe day arrived, wrapped in a shroud of mist that clung to the streets, blurring the line between reality and fantasy. The meeting place was a forgotten corner of the city, where shadows danced and whispers lingered, just as the invitation had promised.\n\nCandent emerged from the gloom, a figure cloaked in an aura of power and mystery. Their presence was both unsettling and compelling, as though the air itself bent to their will. \"You seek justice,\" they intoned, their voice a melody of echoes and silence. \"But at what cost?\"\n\nYour mind swirled with questions, doubts, and desires. Could you trust this being, this embodiment of the unknown? Was the promise of revenge enough to risk everything you had left?\n\n\"Candent,\" you began, the name feeling foreign yet familiar on your tongue. \"I have been wronged. My wish was twisted into a curse. I seek redress.\"\n\nThe figure tilted their head, as if weighing your words against some unseen scale. \"Justice is never simple,\" they replied. \"For every action, there is a consequence.\"\n\nIn the silence that followed, you felt the enormity of your decision pressing down upon you. The path before you was shrouded in uncertainty, yet it beckoned with the promise of closure\u2014or perhaps something more.\n\nWould you step into the unknown, risking all for the chance to rewrite your destiny, or would you heed Sarah's warning and turn away? The choice hung in the air, unresolved, as the shadows deepened around you.",

When tragedy strikes, she and her mother must navigate the weight of loss, shame, and the whispers of a community unwilling to understand.",
        "ground_truth": "They will cut your stomach open like a fruit, Emefa says to Chichi as they walk back home from the river, their pots balanced on their heads. The women in the village of Atebubu are going mad over the news\u2014Chichi, daughter of Awo, has decided to give birth in the clinic in the city and, what\u2019s worse, undergo some kind of surgery, one where the baby does not come from between her legs. Chichi\u2019s mother, a popular plantain seller, faces a tough time at the local market. The women disperse their small gatherings when they see her approaching, and some will not even look her in the eye. The rumors spread fast, a few of the stories surprising Awo upon hearing\u2014Chichi has ridiculed the traditional method of childbirth and called the town\u2019s midwives ignorant, their tools unsterile. She\u2019s using all of her life\u2019s savings for this surgery when she could afford five plots of land for farming. Others even cursed her daughter\u2019s womb, saying, Nothing good will come from there, that child will be no better than any of ours.\n\nShe knows they blame her for this, as if anyone can ever make Chichi change her mind. She remembers the day her daughter spoke about it for the first time. She was only two months pregnant.\n\nMa?\n\nEh?\n\nHow painful is childbirth? Chichi let the words out so easily, as though she were talking about the weather. These topics are considered sacred, and Awo, who was breaking off stalks in a bowl filled with red pepper, stopped abruptly and looked at her daughter before continuing her work. They sat in silence for a while. Chichi hummed an old tune in patience, knowing her mother was giving the question some thought, perhaps too much of it. And when her mother finally spoke, she said, As painful as death. I won\u2019t lie to you, Chi. I\u2019ve never been dead before but while I gave birth to you, I imagined this is how dying feels like\u2014breaking away from your body while still in it.\n\nAwo had had a difficult pregnancy. She was bedridden for months, and people said she nearly didn\u2019t recover. After that, she spat on the floor and swore to never bear a child again and never had since. There were days she worried her daughter had inherited her fear, traumatized by her painful labor.\n\nBut, she added, it ends, you don\u2019t think the pain ever stops but it does. And you open your eyes and there\u2019s a new life nestled in your arms. One of the best gifts, look at you now. Awo stood up then, her back to Chichi as she half smiled at her daughter\u2019s curiosity, all the while the ache of the unknown tugging at her heart.\n\n\nEverything Chichi knows she\u2019s read in books. While her friends crowd the only home in the village with a television set, she spends her days after work inside a library, an old tumbledown cottage with its shelves weathered and dusty, loaded with donated books, several of them with pages missing or ripped out. When she discovered she was going to be a mother, she pulled off the shelf every book that had on its cover something to do with pregnancy\u2014Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy, What to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting, Foods for Nine Whole Months, often showing the smiling face of a white woman with her protruding belly. It was in one of these books that Chichi came across the C-section. She saw in the illustration how an incision is made in the abdomen and the baby removed. She moved her fingers over the page, marveled at how easy and simple it looked, nothing like the horrific things she had been told.\n\nShe had never said a word about her fear of childbirth, since it would come across as absurd. What kind of woman is terrified by her own power? But she was scared about the thought of a full body popping out from between her legs. She was sickened by it, afraid for her dear life. Which is why with the book in her hands, Chichi had run home to show her mother this miracle she had found. But Awo, upon seeing the pictures, broke down in tears, shaking fervently. She ordered Chichi to return the book to the library or watch it burned on the coal pot. This is an abomination. I have never seen something like this before. The body is not meat that it should be cut. Hei! Chichi Attawura, do not bring me trouble.\n\nOf course there was no stopping Chichi. She would bring the trouble on her household, break their necks with its burden and console them with the joys of her newborn child.\n\nHer mother was not the only one who had shared her painful birth story; her friends spoke about it often and described how herbs were inserted in their private parts to cleanse the unborn baby and how they were made to gobble down bitter concoctions. What terrified her most was hearing about how the newborn\u2019s head was molded over a lit fire, a practice meant to shape the child\u2019s head into a pleasing round figure. Kids with large foreheads and square-shaped heads were often made fun of, teased for not having enough fire down their skulls. After the child was born, the cord was cut with a reed, and cow-dung powder was mixed with mud and applied to quicken the healing. Not every part of the story was hideous\u2014during the birth, old women, most of whom had never been to school but had delivered hundreds of babies, gathered around the labor hut and sang war songs until the cry of a child was heard from the inside. Her mother had once said, It\u2019s like going to war. You fight and fight and lose some blood. But if you\u2019re lucky, you return whole, along with a gift you salvaged from the battleground.\n\nBut not Chichi. There was no way her child was simply something to be salvaged. This was her baby, her heart, and, even more than she would like to admit, her proof of survival after her lover of four years left in the middle of the night, having been told the day before by a beaming Chichi that he was going to be a father. This birth, carried out in the safe way she\u2019d seen in the books, would be the only thing that would make sense in her life.\n\n\nOn a cold August night Awo heard her daughter scream. Lying next to her with the roof of her belly swollen, Chichi bit her lower lip, wincing in pain. The mat was soaked wet. That\u2019s when Awo knew it was time. Finally this child would be born in whatever way the mother wished and would be the talk of town for about a month or so until the townspeople found another story to rub their mouths in. She rose from the mat and helped her daughter to her feet. Chichi, overcome by an unhinging sensation, could barely keep still. It wasn\u2019t until Awo washed her face at the tap that she realized it was stark midnight and not a vehicle in sight. There was no way a truck would be moving to the city at this time. She panicked at the thought, unsure what her daughter would decide to do next.\n\nI\u2019ll go on an okada, Chichi said, rubbing her palms hurriedly against her cheeks, anything to get her mind off the contractions.\n\nAn okada? Awo gasped. Chi, have you seen yourself? You\u2019re as huge as an oak tree and here you are, talking about riding on an okada. Please, listen to me. The local nurses are a few huts away. All we have to do is go to them, and this baby will be out. Sharp sharp.\n\nNo. Chichi\u2019s voice was firm, in no way swayed by her discomfort. She shook her head, her mind already filling with the odor of cow dung and rusted metals.\n\nAwo needed no one to tell her about how adamant her daughter could be. Wrapping a cloth over her waist, she set off to the market and headed to the transport shed, where okada riders waited their turn for passengers. A lean man lay on a bench asleep, his helmet clutched tight to his chest as though if he had to guard against anything, that would be a good enough weapon to save him. Awo rushed to his side, panting. She shook him by the arm and said, Chief, I need you. Hurry. My daughter is in labor. The man, still waking up from his sleep, was startled by the sight of a woman in the middle of the night. He rubbed his eyes and threw his legs over the bench, stretching. He registered the urgency in Awo\u2019s voice and without a word got on his motorbike. Awo joined him at the back, and he sped off, the smoke from his pipe coughing out like a long-held secret.\n\nThey found Chichi on the cement floor, moaning, letting out huge breaths. The rider, who clearly felt he was in the wrong place, stared from one face to the other as he pointed to the labor hut, a few huts away from them, and asked, Ah, is this where she\u2019s going? He was unable to hide his frustration for coming all the way just to cover such a short distance.\n\nNo, Awo said, as she helped Chichi up. She\u2019s going to the clinic in the city. The rider, who by this time thought he was dreaming, stood by his bike without moving, resting his eyes on both women. Not until Chichi let out a painful scream did he shake himself out of the trance and assist her onto the bike. On the back of the okada Chichi looked as though she would fall and roll onto her stomach any moment. The rider, after having decided to leave the two women to their fate, stretched out his hand for the fare, and Awo folded a twenty cedis note into his palm. He sped off. As Awo wandered back into the hut, the bloated body of her daughter bumping down the dusty road was the last image clouding her mind.\n\n\nAwo was not the first to arrive at the clinic. After sitting on a truckload of pineapples for three hours, she found her daughter\u2019s friends in the waiting area and immediately knew something was wrong. They ran to Awo and clad her in an uncomfortable embrace. She was impatient and stopped herself from asking the question tingling on her tongue: Which one of them survived? As though certain only one had to go, as though the loss of one life makes up for the other. Her legs trembled, but she leaned against a wall as she searched their eyes for answers. It\u2019s the baby, she said, knowing immediately. She watched them nod, a calm relief unknotting inside her. She didn\u2019t cry but asked to see her daughter. A fetal injury, they had been told. In the making of the uterine incision, a laceration was accidentally made to the baby\u2019s head. The cut was long and deep on the baby\u2019s scalp, and the baby died after an hour of hemorrhaging.\n\nChichi lay with her back flat on the bed, her head turned to face the other side of the room. The only sound, apart from her muffled cries, was from a small ceiling fan that spun slowly above their heads. The room was neat, and on a table was a bowl of untouched soup. A wooden chair sat next to the bed. Fancy place, Awo thought as she walked toward Chichi. Chi, she said softly and saw her daughter try to inch her body farther away, a movement that sent pain searing through her body. It was only a small bed but it seemed an ocean between them. Awo moved around to face her daughter and sat on the floor, hoping the nurses wouldn\u2019t think her insane. She reached for her daughter\u2019s hand as she spoke. Chi, my child, you have fought a good fight.\n\nChichi was quiet, her tears spilling heavily onto the white sheets. She didn\u2019t want a good fight. She didn\u2019t want any fight at all. Her body was numb and yet a throng of pain moved through her. Her mind flooded with thoughts. The most horrifying was returning to Atebubu without a child. Walking back empty-handed, having nothing to show, nothing to prove. And the word that would go around about how her library mind had failed her. Awo thought about the same things too, sitting on the cold floor, watching her daughter grieve.\n\nSilence, a weapon of choice, hung between them, cut through the air. How quickly loss takes over the body and inhabits it. Awo couldn\u2019t tell what would have been worse\u2014the baby surviving and the family having to live with the curse of a child born in an unnatural way or having to carry the burden of loss and shame. And as if giving up on understanding the dilemma, she thought, What does it matter even? That which is gone is gone forever. We shall rub this sore to heal. After all, a scar is nothing but a blemish. The body can take it, the body can take it, she whispered more to herself than to Chichi. Both mother and daughter wept then, emptying themselves of an unspoken heaviness and cleaning their wounds dry, like a hungry tongue scraping the bottom of a pot.\n",
        "story_a": "Chichi stood on the edge of the village square, her gaze fixed on the small, weathered building where traditions were born and preserved. The meeting house, with its thatched roof and wooden beams, seemed to pulse with the collective memory of generations. It was here that her grandmother had woven tales of strength and sacrifice, where her mother had learned the customs that shaped their lives, and where Chichi herself had once believed in the sanctity of their ways.\n\nBut today, Chichi's heart was a storm of defiance and fear. She cradled her swollen belly, feeling the flutter of life within her, a life she had chosen to bring into the world not through the time-honored rituals, but through the sterile, clinical hands of modern medicine. It was a decision that had drawn sharp breaths and shaking heads, a decision that had set her apart from the women who wore their traditions like a second skin.\n\nThe whispers had begun the moment she announced her choice. \"Chichi is going to the city hospital,\" they said, their voices tinged with disbelief and disdain. \"She trusts those machines more than the hands of our midwives.\" The words stung, but Chichi held her ground, buoyed by the promise of safety and the hope of a future free from the shadows of past losses.\n\nHer mother, Ekaete, had been her only ally, albeit a reluctant one. Ekaete's eyes, dark and deep as the village well, had filled with worry as she listened to Chichi's arguments. \"I don't understand it,\" she had said, her voice trembling with the weight of a lifetime of conformity. \"But I will stand by you, my daughter. You are the light of my life, and I cannot bear to see you suffer.\"\n\nAs the weeks passed, Chichi and Ekaete had grown closer, their bond forged in the crucible of the village's judgment. Ekaete had accompanied her daughter to the city for every appointment, her presence a comforting reminder of home even amidst the sterile corridors and antiseptic smells. The doctors had been kind, their reassurances a balm to Chichi's anxious heart.\n\nThe day of the birth dawned clear and bright, the sky a brilliant blue canvas stretched over the world. Chichi had felt a surge of excitement and trepidation as she was wheeled into the delivery room, Ekaete's hand clasped tightly in hers. \"You are strong,\" Ekaete had whispered, her voice a steady anchor. \"You are my brave girl.\"\n\nHours later, the cries of a newborn filled the room, a sound that brought tears of joy to Chichi's eyes. She looked down at the tiny, perfect face of her daughter, and in that moment, all the fear and doubt melted away. She had done it. She had brought new life into the world, and in doing so, she had forged a new path for herself and her family.\n\nBut joy can be fleeting, and fate has a way of testing even the strongest of wills. As the days turned into weeks, Chichi noticed that her daughter, Amara, was not thriving as she should. The doctors spoke in hushed tones of complications and anomalies, their words a cruel echo of the village's warnings. Chichi's heart ached with the weight of it, and she turned to Ekaete for solace.\n\n\"We will get through this,\" Ekaete said, her voice unwavering. \"We are strong, Chichi. We have always been strong.\"\n\nBut despite their strength, despite their unwavering love, Amara's tiny body could not fight the unseen battle. One cold, silent night, as the village slept under a blanket of stars, Amara slipped away, leaving Chichi and Ekaete to grapple with a grief that felt as vast and unfathomable as the ocean.\n\nThe village mourned with them, but the whispers returned, sharper and more insidious. \"She defied our ways,\" they said. \"This is the price she pays.\" Chichi felt the sting of their judgment like a thousand tiny cuts, each one deepening the wound of her loss.\n\nEkaete stood by her daughter, her presence a shield against the storm. \"You did what you believed was best,\" she said, her voice a steady beacon in the darkness. \"Do not let their words break you.\"\n\nBut Chichi's heart was heavy with guilt and doubt. She replayed every decision, every moment, searching for the point where she had gone wrong. The weight of it threatened to crush her, to drown her in a sea of regret.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows over the village, Chichi and Ekaete sat by the river that wound its way through the fields. The water flowed gently, a soothing murmur that spoke of continuity and change. Chichi stared into the depths, her reflection a distorted, sorrowful visage.\n\n\"Mother,\" she said, her voice barely a whisper. \"Do you think I was wrong? Do you think I brought this upon us?\"\n\nEkaete turned to her daughter, her eyes filled with a fierce, unwavering love. \"No, Chichi,\" she said firmly. \"You did what you believed was best for Amara. You wanted to protect her, to give her the best chance at life. That is not wrong. That is love.\"\n\n\"But the village\u2014\"\n\n\"The village will always have its whispers,\" Ekaete interrupted gently. \"But they do not know your heart. They do not know the depth of your love or the strength of your spirit. You must find a way to forgive yourself, to understand that you did everything you could.\"\n\nChichi nodded, tears streaming down her face. She leaned into her mother's embrace, feeling the warmth and solidity of her presence. They sat together as the stars began to twinkle overhead, a silent testament to the enduring bond between mother and daughter.\n\nIn the days that followed, Chichi found small moments of solace. She tended to the garden behind their home, her hands working the soil, planting seeds that would one day bloom into vibrant flowers. She visited Amara's grave, leaving fresh flowers and whispering words of love and apology. She listened to Ekaete's stories, tales of strength and resilience that reminded her of the legacy she carried.\n\nSlowly, the weight of guilt and shame began to lift, replaced by a quiet determination. Chichi knew she could not change the past, but she could honor Amara's memory by living a life of purpose and love. She began to help other women in the village, sharing her knowledge and experiences, offering support and understanding.\n\nThe whispers never completely ceased, but they lost their power to wound. Chichi held her head high, knowing that she had faced the storm and emerged stronger. She had defied tradition, and though the cost had been great, she had forged a new path, one that honored both the past and the future.\n\nEkaete watched her daughter with pride and love, knowing that Chichi's strength and courage would inspire others. Together, they navigated the complexities of their world, finding a balance between tradition and modernity, between loss and hope. And in the quiet moments, when the village was still and the stars shone brightly above, they felt the presence of Amara, a gentle, guiding light in their hearts.\n\nYears passed, and the village changed in subtle ways. New customs blended with the old, and the rigid boundaries of tradition softened. Chichi's story became a part of the village's tapestry, a testament to the power of love and the resilience of the human spirit.\n\nOne day, as Chichi walked through the village square, she saw a group of young girls gathered by the meeting house. They were listening to Ekaete, who was sharing one of her many stories. Chichi paused, a smile tugging at her lips as she watched her mother captivate the audience with her words.\n\nEkaete caught her daughter's eye and beckoned her over. \"Come, Chichi,\" she said. \"Tell them about Amara. Tell them about the strength of a mother's love.\"\n\nChichi joined the circle, her heart swelling with pride and gratitude. She took a deep breath and began to speak, her voice steady and clear. She told them of her journey, of the choices she had made and the lessons she had learned. She spoke of Amara, of the love that had guided her every step, and of the hope that had carried her through the darkest days.\n\nAs she spoke, Chichi felt a sense of peace and purpose. She knew that her story would live on, a beacon of hope for future generations. And in that moment, surrounded by the warmth of her community and the love of her family, she felt Amara's presence, a gentle whisper of reassurance and love.\n\nThe village square, once a place of judgment and whispers, now resonated with the sound of laughter and stories. Chichi looked around at the faces of the young girls, seeing in their eyes the promise of a future where tradition and modernity could coexist, where love and resilience could overcome any challenge.\n\nAs the sun set and the stars began to appear, Chichi felt a deep sense of contentment. She had navigated the storm, and though the journey had been fraught with pain and loss, she had emerged stronger, her spirit unbroken. She had honored Amara's memory by living a life of purpose and love, and in doing so, she had found a way to heal.\n\nChichi and Ekaete walked home together, their steps in sync, their hearts connected by an unbreakable bond. They spoke of the future, of the dreams they held for the village and for each other. And as they reached their home, Chichi looked up at the sky, feeling a deep sense of gratitude and peace.\n\nIn the quiet of the night, as they sat together by the fire, Ekaete took Chichi's hand in hers. \"You are my brave girl,\" she said softly. \"You have faced the storm and come through stronger. Amara would be proud of you.\"\n\nChichi smiled, her heart full. \"And I am proud of you, Mother. For standing by me, for loving me unconditionally. We have walked this path together, and I could not have done it without you.\"\n\nEkaete squeezed her daughter's hand, her eyes shining with love and pride. \"We are strong, Chichi. We always have been, and we always will be.\"\n\nAs the fire crackled and the night deepened, Chichi and Ekaete sat together, their hearts full of love and hope. They knew that the journey ahead would not be easy, but they were ready to face it together, their bond unbreakable, their spirits resilient.\n\nAnd in the stillness of the night, as the village slept and the stars shone brightly above, Chichi felt a sense of peace and purpose. She had defied tradition, faced the storm, and emerged stronger. She had honored Amara's memory by living a life of love and resilience, and in doing so, she had found a way to heal.\n\nThe village would continue to change, blending the old with the new, but Chichi knew that the strength of a mother's love and the resilience of the human spirit would always endure. And in that knowledge, she found a deep and abiding sense of hope.\n\nAs the first light of dawn began to break, Chichi and Ekaete rose to face a new day, their hearts filled with love and determination. They knew that the journey ahead would be filled with challenges, but they were ready to face them together, their bond unbreakable, their spirits resilient.\n\nAnd in the quiet moments, when the world was still and the stars shone brightly above, they felt the presence of Amara, a gentle, guiding light in their hearts, a testament to the enduring power of love and the resilience of the human spirit.",
        "story_b": "The air in the village was thick with the scent of rain and the whispers of those who walked its narrow paths. It was a place where the past clung to the present like moss to the ancient stones that formed the village's heart. For generations, tradition had been the thread that wove the lives of its people, dictating how they lived, loved, and brought new life into the world. But Chichi, in a moment of defiance or perhaps desperation, had chosen a different thread, a modern method that promised safety and comfort but carried the weight of the unknown.\n\nChichi sat in the dim light of her room, her eyes tracing the patterns on the family heirloom tapestry. It hung on the wall opposite her bed, a testament to the hands of her ancestors who had worked it for years. Each thread told a story, a history of lives lived and lost, of births that followed the same time-honored rituals her people had practiced for centuries. But now, in her mind\u2019s eye, the colors seemed to shift, the reds and golds bleeding into each other, unraveling the very essence of the tradition she had dared to challenge.\n\nShe felt the weight of her decision heavy upon her chest, a physical presence that pressed down on her with every breath. Her heart ached with the weight of a thousand unspoken words, each one a reminder of the life that had been lost, the child she had never held. She had believed in the promises of the modern world, in the sterile rooms and gentle reassurances of the doctors who spoke of progress and safety. But the whispers of the village, like the relentless rain that fell outside her window, clung to her, suffocating and relentless.\n\n\"The modern ways have angered the spirits,\" the villagers would say, their voices a constant murmur that reached Chichi even in the solitude of her room. They had gathered outside her window, their faces shadowed in the evening light, their eyes filled with a mixture of pity and judgment. In their minds, Chichi had not just lost a child; she had defied the very essence of who they were, and for that, there could be no understanding.\n\nHer mother, Nneka, sat across the room, her presence a silent echo of Chichi\u2019s own turmoil. The lines on her face spoke of a life spent adhering to the rhythms of the village, a life where the old ways were not just respected but revered. And yet, there was a tension between them, a shared grief that neither could articulate, a chasm filled with the weight of their loss and the judgment of their peers.\n\nThey sat in silence, the space between them filled with the whispers of the village and the unspoken emotions that threatened to drown them both. Chichi could feel her mother's eyes upon her, a steady gaze that held both reproach and a deep, abiding love. But how could she explain the fear that had driven her to choose the modern way, the fear of losing her child, a fear that had now been realized in the most devastating of ways?\n\nThe village had always been a place where lives were intertwined, where the boundaries of one\u2019s existence were defined by the collective whole. The paths were narrow, winding through homes built so close that secrets were impossible to keep. Communal spaces thrived on gossip, and the walls were thin enough for every whisper to find its way to those who were the subject of its scrutiny. In such a place, Chichi\u2019s choice was not just a personal tragedy but a communal wound, one that the village prodded and picked at with merciless curiosity.\n\nChichi\u2019s mind drifted to the day she had first considered the modern method of childbirth. She remembered the pamphlet she had hidden beneath her pillow, its glossy pages filled with images of smiling mothers and healthy babies, promises of safety wrapped in sterile words. She had read it in the quiet moments of the night, her heart filled with a longing for something she couldn\u2019t quite name\u2014a desire to hold her child without the fear that had haunted so many mothers in her village.\n\nBut that longing had turned to ashes, a bitter reminder of dreams unfulfilled. The child, a son she had named in her heart but never aloud, had slipped from her grasp, leaving behind an emptiness that echoed through her every thought. And now, the whispers of the village painted her as a cautionary tale, a reminder of the perils of straying from the path laid out by tradition.\n\nHer mother shifted in her seat, the movement drawing Chichi\u2019s gaze. Nneka\u2019s hands were clasped in her lap, her fingers tracing the worn fabric of her dress, a gesture that spoke of her own internal struggle. She had not openly condemned Chichi's choice, but neither had she offered support in the face of the village\u2019s judgment. It was an unspoken agreement between them, a fragile truce built on love and the shared weight of their loss.\n\n\"The spirits are not angered by change,\" Chichi said finally, her voice barely above a whisper. \"They are angered by fear, by our unwillingness to see beyond what we have always known.\"\n\nNneka looked at her daughter, her eyes filled with a sadness that seemed to envelop the room. \"The village speaks of anger because they do not understand, Chichi. They fear what they do not know.\"\n\nChichi nodded, the words resonating with a truth she had long suspected. The village's whispers were born of fear, a fear that had kept their traditions intact for generations. But she also knew that fear could not hold back the tide of change forever. It was a realization that brought both solace and despair, for while she understood the inevitability of change, she also felt the crushing weight of her role in bringing it to light.\n\nOutside, the rain continued to fall, a steady rhythm that seemed to echo the pulse of the village itself. Chichi rose from her seat, moving to the window where she could see the outlines of her neighbors moving through the mist. They were familiar figures, people she had known all her life, and yet in this moment, they seemed like strangers, their faces blurred by the rain and the distance of her isolation.\n\n\"The path of the future is not one we walk alone,\" Nneka said, her voice a gentle reminder of the bond they shared. \"We must walk it together, even if the world around us is not ready to follow.\"\n\nChichi turned to her mother, seeing in her eyes the strength that had carried her through a life defined by tradition. It was a strength that Chichi now realized she would need to draw upon, a strength that would allow her to face the whispers of the village with defiance rather than despair.\n\nTogether, they would navigate the weight of their loss, the shame that had been heaped upon them, and the whispers that sought to define their grief. They would find a way to honor the past while embracing the future, even if it meant walking a path that was theirs alone.\n\nAs the rain began to ease, Chichi felt a sense of calm settle over her, a resolve that had been absent in the days since her son\u2019s death. She knew that the path she had chosen was fraught with challenges, but it was a path that held the promise of new beginnings, a path that could lead to a world where tradition and modernity walked hand in hand.\n\nIn the quiet of her room, with the whispers of the village fading into the distance, Chichi and Nneka sat together, their silence now filled with a shared understanding. They would face the future together, and in doing so, they would find a way to weave a new tapestry, one that honored the past but was vibrant with the colors of change. \n\nChichi knew that it was a journey that would require courage, a journey that would test the very fabric of who she was. But she also knew that it was a journey worth taking, for herself, for her mother, and for the child she had lost but would never forget. As the first light of dawn began to break over the village, Chichi felt its warmth upon her face, a gentle reminder that even in the darkest of times, there was always the promise of a new day.",

        "ground_truth": "They will cut your stomach open like a fruit, Emefa says to Chichi as they walk back home from the river, their pots balanced on their heads. The women in the village of Atebubu are going mad over the news\u2014Chichi, daughter of Awo, has decided to give birth in the clinic in the city and, what\u2019s worse, undergo some kind of surgery, one where the baby does not come from between her legs. Chichi\u2019s mother, a popular plantain seller, faces a tough time at the local market. The women disperse their small gatherings when they see her approaching, and some will not even look her in the eye. The rumors spread fast, a few of the stories surprising Awo upon hearing\u2014Chichi has ridiculed the traditional method of childbirth and called the town\u2019s midwives ignorant, their tools unsterile. She\u2019s using all of her life\u2019s savings for this surgery when she could afford five plots of land for farming. Others even cursed her daughter\u2019s womb, saying, Nothing good will come from there, that child will be no better than any of ours.\n\nShe knows they blame her for this, as if anyone can ever make Chichi change her mind. She remembers the day her daughter spoke about it for the first time. She was only two months pregnant.\n\nMa?\n\nEh?\n\nHow painful is childbirth? Chichi let the words out so easily, as though she were talking about the weather. These topics are considered sacred, and Awo, who was breaking off stalks in a bowl filled with red pepper, stopped abruptly and looked at her daughter before continuing her work. They sat in silence for a while. Chichi hummed an old tune in patience, knowing her mother was giving the question some thought, perhaps too much of it. And when her mother finally spoke, she said, As painful as death. I won\u2019t lie to you, Chi. I\u2019ve never been dead before but while I gave birth to you, I imagined this is how dying feels like\u2014breaking away from your body while still in it.\n\nAwo had had a difficult pregnancy. She was bedridden for months, and people said she nearly didn\u2019t recover. After that, she spat on the floor and swore to never bear a child again and never had since. There were days she worried her daughter had inherited her fear, traumatized by her painful labor.\n\nBut, she added, it ends, you don\u2019t think the pain ever stops but it does. And you open your eyes and there\u2019s a new life nestled in your arms. One of the best gifts, look at you now. Awo stood up then, her back to Chichi as she half smiled at her daughter\u2019s curiosity, all the while the ache of the unknown tugging at her heart.\n\n\nEverything Chichi knows she\u2019s read in books. While her friends crowd the only home in the village with a television set, she spends her days after work inside a library, an old tumbledown cottage with its shelves weathered and dusty, loaded with donated books, several of them with pages missing or ripped out. When she discovered she was going to be a mother, she pulled off the shelf every book that had on its cover something to do with pregnancy\u2014Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy, What to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting, Foods for Nine Whole Months, often showing the smiling face of a white woman with her protruding belly. It was in one of these books that Chichi came across the C-section. She saw in the illustration how an incision is made in the abdomen and the baby removed. She moved her fingers over the page, marveled at how easy and simple it looked, nothing like the horrific things she had been told.\n\nShe had never said a word about her fear of childbirth, since it would come across as absurd. What kind of woman is terrified by her own power? But she was scared about the thought of a full body popping out from between her legs. She was sickened by it, afraid for her dear life. Which is why with the book in her hands, Chichi had run home to show her mother this miracle she had found. But Awo, upon seeing the pictures, broke down in tears, shaking fervently. She ordered Chichi to return the book to the library or watch it burned on the coal pot. This is an abomination. I have never seen something like this before. The body is not meat that it should be cut. Hei! Chichi Attawura, do not bring me trouble.\n\nOf course there was no stopping Chichi. She would bring the trouble on her household, break their necks with its burden and console them with the joys of her newborn child.\n\nHer mother was not the only one who had shared her painful birth story; her friends spoke about it often and described how herbs were inserted in their private parts to cleanse the unborn baby and how they were made to gobble down bitter concoctions. What terrified her most was hearing about how the newborn\u2019s head was molded over a lit fire, a practice meant to shape the child\u2019s head into a pleasing round figure. Kids with large foreheads and square-shaped heads were often made fun of, teased for not having enough fire down their skulls. After the child was born, the cord was cut with a reed, and cow-dung powder was mixed with mud and applied to quicken the healing. Not every part of the story was hideous\u2014during the birth, old women, most of whom had never been to school but had delivered hundreds of babies, gathered around the labor hut and sang war songs until the cry of a child was heard from the inside. Her mother had once said, It\u2019s like going to war. You fight and fight and lose some blood. But if you\u2019re lucky, you return whole, along with a gift you salvaged from the battleground.\n\nBut not Chichi. There was no way her child was simply something to be salvaged. This was her baby, her heart, and, even more than she would like to admit, her proof of survival after her lover of four years left in the middle of the night, having been told the day before by a beaming Chichi that he was going to be a father. This birth, carried out in the safe way she\u2019d seen in the books, would be the only thing that would make sense in her life.\n\n\nOn a cold August night Awo heard her daughter scream. Lying next to her with the roof of her belly swollen, Chichi bit her lower lip, wincing in pain. The mat was soaked wet. That\u2019s when Awo knew it was time. Finally this child would be born in whatever way the mother wished and would be the talk of town for about a month or so until the townspeople found another story to rub their mouths in. She rose from the mat and helped her daughter to her feet. Chichi, overcome by an unhinging sensation, could barely keep still. It wasn\u2019t until Awo washed her face at the tap that she realized it was stark midnight and not a vehicle in sight. There was no way a truck would be moving to the city at this time. She panicked at the thought, unsure what her daughter would decide to do next.\n\nI\u2019ll go on an okada, Chichi said, rubbing her palms hurriedly against her cheeks, anything to get her mind off the contractions.\n\nAn okada? Awo gasped. Chi, have you seen yourself? You\u2019re as huge as an oak tree and here you are, talking about riding on an okada. Please, listen to me. The local nurses are a few huts away. All we have to do is go to them, and this baby will be out. Sharp sharp.\n\nNo. Chichi\u2019s voice was firm, in no way swayed by her discomfort. She shook her head, her mind already filling with the odor of cow dung and rusted metals.\n\nAwo needed no one to tell her about how adamant her daughter could be. Wrapping a cloth over her waist, she set off to the market and headed to the transport shed, where okada riders waited their turn for passengers. A lean man lay on a bench asleep, his helmet clutched tight to his chest as though if he had to guard against anything, that would be a good enough weapon to save him. Awo rushed to his side, panting. She shook him by the arm and said, Chief, I need you. Hurry. My daughter is in labor. The man, still waking up from his sleep, was startled by the sight of a woman in the middle of the night. He rubbed his eyes and threw his legs over the bench, stretching. He registered the urgency in Awo\u2019s voice and without a word got on his motorbike. Awo joined him at the back, and he sped off, the smoke from his pipe coughing out like a long-held secret.\n\nThey found Chichi on the cement floor, moaning, letting out huge breaths. The rider, who clearly felt he was in the wrong place, stared from one face to the other as he pointed to the labor hut, a few huts away from them, and asked, Ah, is this where she\u2019s going? He was unable to hide his frustration for coming all the way just to cover such a short distance.\n\nNo, Awo said, as she helped Chichi up. She\u2019s going to the clinic in the city. The rider, who by this time thought he was dreaming, stood by his bike without moving, resting his eyes on both women. Not until Chichi let out a painful scream did he shake himself out of the trance and assist her onto the bike. On the back of the okada Chichi looked as though she would fall and roll onto her stomach any moment. The rider, after having decided to leave the two women to their fate, stretched out his hand for the fare, and Awo folded a twenty cedis note into his palm. He sped off. As Awo wandered back into the hut, the bloated body of her daughter bumping down the dusty road was the last image clouding her mind.\n\n\nAwo was not the first to arrive at the clinic. After sitting on a truckload of pineapples for three hours, she found her daughter\u2019s friends in the waiting area and immediately knew something was wrong. They ran to Awo and clad her in an uncomfortable embrace. She was impatient and stopped herself from asking the question tingling on her tongue: Which one of them survived? As though certain only one had to go, as though the loss of one life makes up for the other. Her legs trembled, but she leaned against a wall as she searched their eyes for answers. It\u2019s the baby, she said, knowing immediately. She watched them nod, a calm relief unknotting inside her. She didn\u2019t cry but asked to see her daughter. A fetal injury, they had been told. In the making of the uterine incision, a laceration was accidentally made to the baby\u2019s head. The cut was long and deep on the baby\u2019s scalp, and the baby died after an hour of hemorrhaging.\n\nChichi lay with her back flat on the bed, her head turned to face the other side of the room. The only sound, apart from her muffled cries, was from a small ceiling fan that spun slowly above their heads. The room was neat, and on a table was a bowl of untouched soup. A wooden chair sat next to the bed. Fancy place, Awo thought as she walked toward Chichi. Chi, she said softly and saw her daughter try to inch her body farther away, a movement that sent pain searing through her body. It was only a small bed but it seemed an ocean between them. Awo moved around to face her daughter and sat on the floor, hoping the nurses wouldn\u2019t think her insane. She reached for her daughter\u2019s hand as she spoke. Chi, my child, you have fought a good fight.\n\nChichi was quiet, her tears spilling heavily onto the white sheets. She didn\u2019t want a good fight. She didn\u2019t want any fight at all. Her body was numb and yet a throng of pain moved through her. Her mind flooded with thoughts. The most horrifying was returning to Atebubu without a child. Walking back empty-handed, having nothing to show, nothing to prove. And the word that would go around about how her library mind had failed her. Awo thought about the same things too, sitting on the cold floor, watching her daughter grieve.\n\nSilence, a weapon of choice, hung between them, cut through the air. How quickly loss takes over the body and inhabits it. Awo couldn\u2019t tell what would have been worse\u2014the baby surviving and the family having to live with the curse of a child born in an unnatural way or having to carry the burden of loss and shame. And as if giving up on understanding the dilemma, she thought, What does it matter even? That which is gone is gone forever. We shall rub this sore to heal. After all, a scar is nothing but a blemish. The body can take it, the body can take it, she whispered more to herself than to Chichi. Both mother and daughter wept then, emptying themselves of an unspoken heaviness and cleaning their wounds dry, like a hungry tongue scraping the bottom of a pot.\n",
        "story_a": "Chichi stood on the edge of the village square, her gaze fixed on the small, weathered building where traditions were born and preserved. The meeting house, with its thatched roof and wooden beams, seemed to pulse with the collective memory of generations. It was here that her grandmother had woven tales of strength and sacrifice, where her mother had learned the customs that shaped their lives, and where Chichi herself had once believed in the sanctity of their ways.\n\nBut today, Chichi's heart was a storm of defiance and fear. She cradled her swollen belly, feeling the flutter of life within her, a life she had chosen to bring into the world not through the time-honored rituals, but through the sterile, clinical hands of modern medicine. It was a decision that had drawn sharp breaths and shaking heads, a decision that had set her apart from the women who wore their traditions like a second skin.\n\nThe whispers had begun the moment she announced her choice. \"Chichi is going to the city hospital,\" they said, their voices tinged with disbelief and disdain. \"She trusts those machines more than the hands of our midwives.\" The words stung, but Chichi held her ground, buoyed by the promise of safety and the hope of a future free from the shadows of past losses.\n\nHer mother, Ekaete, had been her only ally, albeit a reluctant one. Ekaete's eyes, dark and deep as the village well, had filled with worry as she listened to Chichi's arguments. \"I don't understand it,\" she had said, her voice trembling with the weight of a lifetime of conformity. \"But I will stand by you, my daughter. You are the light of my life, and I cannot bear to see you suffer.\"\n\nAs the weeks passed, Chichi and Ekaete had grown closer, their bond forged in the crucible of the village's judgment. Ekaete had accompanied her daughter to the city for every appointment, her presence a comforting reminder of home even amidst the sterile corridors and antiseptic smells. The doctors had been kind, their reassurances a balm to Chichi's anxious heart.\n\nThe day of the birth dawned clear and bright, the sky a brilliant blue canvas stretched over the world. Chichi had felt a surge of excitement and trepidation as she was wheeled into the delivery room, Ekaete's hand clasped tightly in hers. \"You are strong,\" Ekaete had whispered, her voice a steady anchor. \"You are my brave girl.\"\n\nHours later, the cries of a newborn filled the room, a sound that brought tears of joy to Chichi's eyes. She looked down at the tiny, perfect face of her daughter, and in that moment, all the fear and doubt melted away. She had done it. She had brought new life into the world, and in doing so, she had forged a new path for herself and her family.\n\nBut joy can be fleeting, and fate has a way of testing even the strongest of wills. As the days turned into weeks, Chichi noticed that her daughter, Amara, was not thriving as she should. The doctors spoke in hushed tones of complications and anomalies, their words a cruel echo of the village's warnings. Chichi's heart ached with the weight of it, and she turned to Ekaete for solace.\n\n\"We will get through this,\" Ekaete said, her voice unwavering. \"We are strong, Chichi. We have always been strong.\"\n\nBut despite their strength, despite their unwavering love, Amara's tiny body could not fight the unseen battle. One cold, silent night, as the village slept under a blanket of stars, Amara slipped away, leaving Chichi and Ekaete to grapple with a grief that felt as vast and unfathomable as the ocean.\n\nThe village mourned with them, but the whispers returned, sharper and more insidious. \"She defied our ways,\" they said. \"This is the price she pays.\" Chichi felt the sting of their judgment like a thousand tiny cuts, each one deepening the wound of her loss.\n\nEkaete stood by her daughter, her presence a shield against the storm. \"You did what you believed was best,\" she said, her voice a steady beacon in the darkness. \"Do not let their words break you.\"\n\nBut Chichi's heart was heavy with guilt and doubt. She replayed every decision, every moment, searching for the point where she had gone wrong. The weight of it threatened to crush her, to drown her in a sea of regret.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows over the village, Chichi and Ekaete sat by the river that wound its way through the fields. The water flowed gently, a soothing murmur that spoke of continuity and change. Chichi stared into the depths, her reflection a distorted, sorrowful visage.\n\n\"Mother,\" she said, her voice barely a whisper. \"Do you think I was wrong? Do you think I brought this upon us?\"\n\nEkaete turned to her daughter, her eyes filled with a fierce, unwavering love. \"No, Chichi,\" she said firmly. \"You did what you believed was best for Amara. You wanted to protect her, to give her the best chance at life. That is not wrong. That is love.\"\n\n\"But the village\u2014\"\n\n\"The village will always have its whispers,\" Ekaete interrupted gently. \"But they do not know your heart. They do not know the depth of your love or the strength of your spirit. You must find a way to forgive yourself, to understand that you did everything you could.\"\n\nChichi nodded, tears streaming down her face. She leaned into her mother's embrace, feeling the warmth and solidity of her presence. They sat together as the stars began to twinkle overhead, a silent testament to the enduring bond between mother and daughter.\n\nIn the days that followed, Chichi found small moments of solace. She tended to the garden behind their home, her hands working the soil, planting seeds that would one day bloom into vibrant flowers. She visited Amara's grave, leaving fresh flowers and whispering words of love and apology. She listened to Ekaete's stories, tales of strength and resilience that reminded her of the legacy she carried.\n\nSlowly, the weight of guilt and shame began to lift, replaced by a quiet determination. Chichi knew she could not change the past, but she could honor Amara's memory by living a life of purpose and love. She began to help other women in the village, sharing her knowledge and experiences, offering support and understanding.\n\nThe whispers never completely ceased, but they lost their power to wound. Chichi held her head high, knowing that she had faced the storm and emerged stronger. She had defied tradition, and though the cost had been great, she had forged a new path, one that honored both the past and the future.\n\nEkaete watched her daughter with pride and love, knowing that Chichi's strength and courage would inspire others. Together, they navigated the complexities of their world, finding a balance between tradition and modernity, between loss and hope. And in the quiet moments, when the village was still and the stars shone brightly above, they felt the presence of Amara, a gentle, guiding light in their hearts.\n\nYears passed, and the village changed in subtle ways. New customs blended with the old, and the rigid boundaries of tradition softened. Chichi's story became a part of the village's tapestry, a testament to the power of love and the resilience of the human spirit.\n\nOne day, as Chichi walked through the village square, she saw a group of young girls gathered by the meeting house. They were listening to Ekaete, who was sharing one of her many stories. Chichi paused, a smile tugging at her lips as she watched her mother captivate the audience with her words.\n\nEkaete caught her daughter's eye and beckoned her over. \"Come, Chichi,\" she said. \"Tell them about Amara. Tell them about the strength of a mother's love.\"\n\nChichi joined the circle, her heart swelling with pride and gratitude. She took a deep breath and began to speak, her voice steady and clear. She told them of her journey, of the choices she had made and the lessons she had learned. She spoke of Amara, of the love that had guided her every step, and of the hope that had carried her through the darkest days.\n\nAs she spoke, Chichi felt a sense of peace and purpose. She knew that her story would live on, a beacon of hope for future generations. And in that moment, surrounded by the warmth of her community and the love of her family, she felt Amara's presence, a gentle whisper of reassurance and love.\n\nThe village square, once a place of judgment and whispers, now resonated with the sound of laughter and stories. Chichi looked around at the faces of the young girls, seeing in their eyes the promise of a future where tradition and modernity could coexist, where love and resilience could overcome any challenge.\n\nAs the sun set and the stars began to appear, Chichi felt a deep sense of contentment. She had navigated the storm, and though the journey had been fraught with pain and loss, she had emerged stronger, her spirit unbroken. She had honored Amara's memory by living a life of purpose and love, and in doing so, she had found a way to heal.\n\nChichi and Ekaete walked home together, their steps in sync, their hearts connected by an unbreakable bond. They spoke of the future, of the dreams they held for the village and for each other. And as they reached their home, Chichi looked up at the sky, feeling a deep sense of gratitude and peace.\n\nIn the quiet of the night, as they sat together by the fire, Ekaete took Chichi's hand in hers. \"You are my brave girl,\" she said softly. \"You have faced the storm and come through stronger. Amara would be proud of you.\"\n\nChichi smiled, her heart full. \"And I am proud of you, Mother. For standing by me, for loving me unconditionally. We have walked this path together, and I could not have done it without you.\"\n\nEkaete squeezed her daughter's hand, her eyes shining with love and pride. \"We are strong, Chichi. We always have been, and we always will be.\"\n\nAs the fire crackled and the night deepened, Chichi and Ekaete sat together, their hearts full of love and hope. They knew that the journey ahead would not be easy, but they were ready to face it together, their bond unbreakable, their spirits resilient.\n\nAnd in the stillness of the night, as the village slept and the stars shone brightly above, Chichi felt a sense of peace and purpose. She had defied tradition, faced the storm, and emerged stronger. She had honored Amara's memory by living a life of love and resilience, and in doing so, she had found a way to heal.\n\nThe village would continue to change, blending the old with the new, but Chichi knew that the strength of a mother's love and the resilience of the human spirit would always endure. And in that knowledge, she found a deep and abiding sense of hope.\n\nAs the first light of dawn began to break, Chichi and Ekaete rose to face a new day, their hearts filled with love and determination. They knew that the journey ahead would be filled with challenges, but they were ready to face them together, their bond unbreakable, their spirits resilient.\n\nAnd in the quiet moments, when the world was still and the stars shone brightly above, they felt the presence of Amara, a gentle, guiding light in their hearts, a testament to the enduring power of love and the resilience of the human spirit.",
        "story_b": "Chichi stood at the edge of the village, her eyes tracing the familiar lines of the horizon where the sun dipped below the hills, casting long shadows over the undulating fields. The air was thick with the scent of ripe maize and the distant hum of cicadas. This was her home, where every stone, every tree, and every whisper of the wind carried the weight of tradition. And yet, she had chosen a path that veered away from the well-trodden course of her ancestors.\n\nHer decision had not been easy. It had come after many nights of restless sleep, lying on a straw mat, listening to the village\u2019s heartbeat\u2014a rhythmic pulse of age-old customs and stories passed down through generations. Chichi had felt the tug of these stories, the pressure to conform, and yet, something inside her yearned for change.\n\nThe village elders had gathered the day she announced her choice. Their faces were carved from the same stone that lined the path to the river; their eyes, pools of tradition filled with skepticism. She had chosen to give birth in the city hospital, a place where machines hummed and sterile lights replaced the comforting glow of firelight. It was a decision that rattled the very core of the village\u2019s beliefs, where childbirth was a sacred ceremony, a dance between the living and the spirits that could only be conducted under the watchful gaze of the midwives and ancestors.\n\nHer mother, Adaku, stood by her side that day, her face a mask of stoic support hiding the storm within. Adaku had always been a pillar in the community, respected for her wisdom and her unwavering adherence to tradition. And yet, her love for Chichi had carved a new path in her heart, one that allowed room for understanding even in the face of her own doubts.\n\n\"The world changes, and so must we,\" Chichi had said, her voice steady, yet tinged with the vulnerability of defiance. The words echoed through the village square, bouncing off mud walls and into the ears of those who had gathered to witness her rebellion.\n\nThe whispers began soon after. In the marketplace, where women exchanged goods and gossip, Chichi's name became synonymous with recklessness. \u201cHow could she turn her back on us?\u201d they asked, their voices a melody of disdain and curiosity. \u201cWhat does she seek in the city that our own hands cannot provide?\u201d\n\nChichi often dreamt of a river that flowed backward, its waters defying gravity, moving away from the sea and back to its source. It was a dream that haunted her, a reflection of her own journey against the current of her community\u2019s expectations.\n\nThe day of the birth was a blur of sterile smells and strange voices. Machines beeped in rhythm with her heartbeat, and the sharp sting of antiseptic filled the air. Adaku held her daughter\u2019s hand through it all, her grip a lifeline tethering Chichi to the world she had known. The doctors moved with precision, their faces masked, their eyes focused.\n\nBut tragedy struck, swift and unrelenting. The baby, a girl, was born silent, her cries swallowed by the cold, indifferent walls of the hospital. The room, once bustling with energy, fell into a silence so profound it echoed through Chichi\u2019s very soul.\n\nThe journey back to the village was a somber procession. Adaku walked beside Chichi, their steps in sync, a silent testament to their shared grief. The villagers watched as they returned, their eyes following the pair with a mixture of pity and judgment. In the days that followed, the whispers grew louder, a cacophony of blame and superstition.\n\n\u201cSuch misfortune,\u201d the elders said, shaking their heads. \u201cThe spirits were not honored. This is the result of forsaking our ways.\u201d\n\nChichi retreated into herself, the weight of loss pressing down on her like a heavy cloak. Her dreams of the backward river became more frequent, each one a reminder of her isolation, her estrangement from the world she had once belonged to.\n\nAdaku, too, felt the strain, torn between the desire to protect her daughter and the pull of the community she had always served. She found herself standing on the threshold of her own beliefs, questioning the rigidity of traditions she had once upheld without question. \n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows that danced on the walls of their home, Adaku sat beside Chichi. The air was thick with unspoken words, the silence between them a chasm filled with shared sorrow.\n\n\u201cChichi,\u201d Adaku began, her voice a soft murmur in the quiet room. \u201cWe cannot change what has happened. But we can choose how we move forward.\u201d\n\nChichi looked at her mother, her eyes reflecting the flickering light of the lantern. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in that dream, the one where the river flows backward. I don\u2019t know how to move against it.\u201d\n\nAdaku reached out, taking Chichi\u2019s hand in hers. \u201cPerhaps the river is not meant to be fought. Perhaps it\u2019s a sign that we need to find our own way, even if it means going against the current.\u201d\n\nThe words hung in the air, a fragile bridge of hope spanning the gulf of their despair. In that moment, Chichi felt a flicker of understanding, a glimmer of the first light she had longed for. It was a light not of the past, but of a future she had yet to define.\n\nThe days turned into weeks, and slowly, the village\u2019s whispers faded into the background, a constant murmur but no longer a defining roar. Chichi and Adaku began to find solace in small things\u2014in the quiet moments shared over a pot of steaming soup, in the gentle rhythm of daily chores, and in the resilient bond that had grown between them.\n\nChichi often walked to the edge of the village, standing where the land met the sky, her thoughts stretching out beyond the horizon. She imagined the river in her dreams, its waters now calm and steady, flowing not backward, but in circles\u2014a continuous loop, a never-ending cycle of renewal and hope.\n\nOne afternoon, as Chichi stood at her usual spot, she noticed a group of children playing nearby. Their laughter floated on the breeze, a sweet melody of innocence and joy. She watched them for a while, her heart swelling with a bittersweet longing.\n\n\u201cChichi,\u201d a voice called from behind. It was Adaku, carrying a basket filled with freshly picked herbs. \u201cCome, help me with dinner.\u201d\n\nChichi turned, a smile tugging at the corners of her mouth. She walked toward her mother, feeling the warmth of the sun on her back, the earth solid beneath her feet.\n\nAs they prepared the evening meal, Chichi found herself humming a tune, a melody her grandmother had sung to her long ago. It was a song of resilience, of hope, and of the strength found in familial bonds.\n\nAdaku joined in, her voice harmonizing with Chichi\u2019s. Together, they sang, their voices weaving a tapestry of sound that filled their home with warmth and light. It was a moment of connection, a reminder that though they had faced loss and shame, they had also found a deeper understanding of each other and of themselves.\n\nAs the sun set, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, Chichi and Adaku sat together, their silhouettes framed by the dying light. They spoke of the future, of dreams yet to be realized, and of the courage it would take to forge a new path.\n\nThe village, with its traditions and whispers, continued to exist around them, a constant presence but no longer a defining force. Chichi and Adaku knew that the journey ahead would not be easy, but they also knew that they were not alone.\n\nTogether, they faced the horizon, daring to hope for understanding and acceptance, not just from their community, but from themselves. The river in Chichi\u2019s dreams now flowed steady and true, a symbol of the path she had chosen, a path of courage, resilience, and love.\n\nIn the quiet of their home, as night descended and stars began to twinkle in the vast expanse above, Chichi and Adaku found peace. It was a peace born not of conformity, but of the strength to stand together, to face the unknown, and to embrace the possibilities that lay ahead.\n\nTheir story, like the river, would continue to flow, shaped by the choices they made and the dreams they dared to dream. And in that flow, they found the first light of their own lives, a light that shone brightly against the darkness, guiding them forward, always forward.",

        "ground_truth": "They will cut your stomach open like a fruit, Emefa says to Chichi as they walk back home from the river, their pots balanced on their heads. The women in the village of Atebubu are going mad over the news\u2014Chichi, daughter of Awo, has decided to give birth in the clinic in the city and, what\u2019s worse, undergo some kind of surgery, one where the baby does not come from between her legs. Chichi\u2019s mother, a popular plantain seller, faces a tough time at the local market. The women disperse their small gatherings when they see her approaching, and some will not even look her in the eye. The rumors spread fast, a few of the stories surprising Awo upon hearing\u2014Chichi has ridiculed the traditional method of childbirth and called the town\u2019s midwives ignorant, their tools unsterile. She\u2019s using all of her life\u2019s savings for this surgery when she could afford five plots of land for farming. Others even cursed her daughter\u2019s womb, saying, Nothing good will come from there, that child will be no better than any of ours.\n\nShe knows they blame her for this, as if anyone can ever make Chichi change her mind. She remembers the day her daughter spoke about it for the first time. She was only two months pregnant.\n\nMa?\n\nEh?\n\nHow painful is childbirth? Chichi let the words out so easily, as though she were talking about the weather. These topics are considered sacred, and Awo, who was breaking off stalks in a bowl filled with red pepper, stopped abruptly and looked at her daughter before continuing her work. They sat in silence for a while. Chichi hummed an old tune in patience, knowing her mother was giving the question some thought, perhaps too much of it. And when her mother finally spoke, she said, As painful as death. I won\u2019t lie to you, Chi. I\u2019ve never been dead before but while I gave birth to you, I imagined this is how dying feels like\u2014breaking away from your body while still in it.\n\nAwo had had a difficult pregnancy. She was bedridden for months, and people said she nearly didn\u2019t recover. After that, she spat on the floor and swore to never bear a child again and never had since. There were days she worried her daughter had inherited her fear, traumatized by her painful labor.\n\nBut, she added, it ends, you don\u2019t think the pain ever stops but it does. And you open your eyes and there\u2019s a new life nestled in your arms. One of the best gifts, look at you now. Awo stood up then, her back to Chichi as she half smiled at her daughter\u2019s curiosity, all the while the ache of the unknown tugging at her heart.\n\n\nEverything Chichi knows she\u2019s read in books. While her friends crowd the only home in the village with a television set, she spends her days after work inside a library, an old tumbledown cottage with its shelves weathered and dusty, loaded with donated books, several of them with pages missing or ripped out. When she discovered she was going to be a mother, she pulled off the shelf every book that had on its cover something to do with pregnancy\u2014Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy, What to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting, Foods for Nine Whole Months, often showing the smiling face of a white woman with her protruding belly. It was in one of these books that Chichi came across the C-section. She saw in the illustration how an incision is made in the abdomen and the baby removed. She moved her fingers over the page, marveled at how easy and simple it looked, nothing like the horrific things she had been told.\n\nShe had never said a word about her fear of childbirth, since it would come across as absurd. What kind of woman is terrified by her own power? But she was scared about the thought of a full body popping out from between her legs. She was sickened by it, afraid for her dear life. Which is why with the book in her hands, Chichi had run home to show her mother this miracle she had found. But Awo, upon seeing the pictures, broke down in tears, shaking fervently. She ordered Chichi to return the book to the library or watch it burned on the coal pot. This is an abomination. I have never seen something like this before. The body is not meat that it should be cut. Hei! Chichi Attawura, do not bring me trouble.\n\nOf course there was no stopping Chichi. She would bring the trouble on her household, break their necks with its burden and console them with the joys of her newborn child.\n\nHer mother was not the only one who had shared her painful birth story; her friends spoke about it often and described how herbs were inserted in their private parts to cleanse the unborn baby and how they were made to gobble down bitter concoctions. What terrified her most was hearing about how the newborn\u2019s head was molded over a lit fire, a practice meant to shape the child\u2019s head into a pleasing round figure. Kids with large foreheads and square-shaped heads were often made fun of, teased for not having enough fire down their skulls. After the child was born, the cord was cut with a reed, and cow-dung powder was mixed with mud and applied to quicken the healing. Not every part of the story was hideous\u2014during the birth, old women, most of whom had never been to school but had delivered hundreds of babies, gathered around the labor hut and sang war songs until the cry of a child was heard from the inside. Her mother had once said, It\u2019s like going to war. You fight and fight and lose some blood. But if you\u2019re lucky, you return whole, along with a gift you salvaged from the battleground.\n\nBut not Chichi. There was no way her child was simply something to be salvaged. This was her baby, her heart, and, even more than she would like to admit, her proof of survival after her lover of four years left in the middle of the night, having been told the day before by a beaming Chichi that he was going to be a father. This birth, carried out in the safe way she\u2019d seen in the books, would be the only thing that would make sense in her life.\n\n\nOn a cold August night Awo heard her daughter scream. Lying next to her with the roof of her belly swollen, Chichi bit her lower lip, wincing in pain. The mat was soaked wet. That\u2019s when Awo knew it was time. Finally this child would be born in whatever way the mother wished and would be the talk of town for about a month or so until the townspeople found another story to rub their mouths in. She rose from the mat and helped her daughter to her feet. Chichi, overcome by an unhinging sensation, could barely keep still. It wasn\u2019t until Awo washed her face at the tap that she realized it was stark midnight and not a vehicle in sight. There was no way a truck would be moving to the city at this time. She panicked at the thought, unsure what her daughter would decide to do next.\n\nI\u2019ll go on an okada, Chichi said, rubbing her palms hurriedly against her cheeks, anything to get her mind off the contractions.\n\nAn okada? Awo gasped. Chi, have you seen yourself? You\u2019re as huge as an oak tree and here you are, talking about riding on an okada. Please, listen to me. The local nurses are a few huts away. All we have to do is go to them, and this baby will be out. Sharp sharp.\n\nNo. Chichi\u2019s voice was firm, in no way swayed by her discomfort. She shook her head, her mind already filling with the odor of cow dung and rusted metals.\n\nAwo needed no one to tell her about how adamant her daughter could be. Wrapping a cloth over her waist, she set off to the market and headed to the transport shed, where okada riders waited their turn for passengers. A lean man lay on a bench asleep, his helmet clutched tight to his chest as though if he had to guard against anything, that would be a good enough weapon to save him. Awo rushed to his side, panting. She shook him by the arm and said, Chief, I need you. Hurry. My daughter is in labor. The man, still waking up from his sleep, was startled by the sight of a woman in the middle of the night. He rubbed his eyes and threw his legs over the bench, stretching. He registered the urgency in Awo\u2019s voice and without a word got on his motorbike. Awo joined him at the back, and he sped off, the smoke from his pipe coughing out like a long-held secret.\n\nThey found Chichi on the cement floor, moaning, letting out huge breaths. The rider, who clearly felt he was in the wrong place, stared from one face to the other as he pointed to the labor hut, a few huts away from them, and asked, Ah, is this where she\u2019s going? He was unable to hide his frustration for coming all the way just to cover such a short distance.\n\nNo, Awo said, as she helped Chichi up. She\u2019s going to the clinic in the city. The rider, who by this time thought he was dreaming, stood by his bike without moving, resting his eyes on both women. Not until Chichi let out a painful scream did he shake himself out of the trance and assist her onto the bike. On the back of the okada Chichi looked as though she would fall and roll onto her stomach any moment. The rider, after having decided to leave the two women to their fate, stretched out his hand for the fare, and Awo folded a twenty cedis note into his palm. He sped off. As Awo wandered back into the hut, the bloated body of her daughter bumping down the dusty road was the last image clouding her mind.\n\n\nAwo was not the first to arrive at the clinic. After sitting on a truckload of pineapples for three hours, she found her daughter\u2019s friends in the waiting area and immediately knew something was wrong. They ran to Awo and clad her in an uncomfortable embrace. She was impatient and stopped herself from asking the question tingling on her tongue: Which one of them survived? As though certain only one had to go, as though the loss of one life makes up for the other. Her legs trembled, but she leaned against a wall as she searched their eyes for answers. It\u2019s the baby, she said, knowing immediately. She watched them nod, a calm relief unknotting inside her. She didn\u2019t cry but asked to see her daughter. A fetal injury, they had been told. In the making of the uterine incision, a laceration was accidentally made to the baby\u2019s head. The cut was long and deep on the baby\u2019s scalp, and the baby died after an hour of hemorrhaging.\n\nChichi lay with her back flat on the bed, her head turned to face the other side of the room. The only sound, apart from her muffled cries, was from a small ceiling fan that spun slowly above their heads. The room was neat, and on a table was a bowl of untouched soup. A wooden chair sat next to the bed. Fancy place, Awo thought as she walked toward Chichi. Chi, she said softly and saw her daughter try to inch her body farther away, a movement that sent pain searing through her body. It was only a small bed but it seemed an ocean between them. Awo moved around to face her daughter and sat on the floor, hoping the nurses wouldn\u2019t think her insane. She reached for her daughter\u2019s hand as she spoke. Chi, my child, you have fought a good fight.\n\nChichi was quiet, her tears spilling heavily onto the white sheets. She didn\u2019t want a good fight. She didn\u2019t want any fight at all. Her body was numb and yet a throng of pain moved through her. Her mind flooded with thoughts. The most horrifying was returning to Atebubu without a child. Walking back empty-handed, having nothing to show, nothing to prove. And the word that would go around about how her library mind had failed her. Awo thought about the same things too, sitting on the cold floor, watching her daughter grieve.\n\nSilence, a weapon of choice, hung between them, cut through the air. How quickly loss takes over the body and inhabits it. Awo couldn\u2019t tell what would have been worse\u2014the baby surviving and the family having to live with the curse of a child born in an unnatural way or having to carry the burden of loss and shame. And as if giving up on understanding the dilemma, she thought, What does it matter even? That which is gone is gone forever. We shall rub this sore to heal. After all, a scar is nothing but a blemish. The body can take it, the body can take it, she whispered more to herself than to Chichi. Both mother and daughter wept then, emptying themselves of an unspoken heaviness and cleaning their wounds dry, like a hungry tongue scraping the bottom of a pot.\n",
        "story_a": "Chichi stood on the edge of the village square, her gaze fixed on the small, weathered building where traditions were born and preserved. The meeting house, with its thatched roof and wooden beams, seemed to pulse with the collective memory of generations. It was here that her grandmother had woven tales of strength and sacrifice, where her mother had learned the customs that shaped their lives, and where Chichi herself had once believed in the sanctity of their ways.\n\nBut today, Chichi's heart was a storm of defiance and fear. She cradled her swollen belly, feeling the flutter of life within her, a life she had chosen to bring into the world not through the time-honored rituals, but through the sterile, clinical hands of modern medicine. It was a decision that had drawn sharp breaths and shaking heads, a decision that had set her apart from the women who wore their traditions like a second skin.\n\nThe whispers had begun the moment she announced her choice. \"Chichi is going to the city hospital,\" they said, their voices tinged with disbelief and disdain. \"She trusts those machines more than the hands of our midwives.\" The words stung, but Chichi held her ground, buoyed by the promise of safety and the hope of a future free from the shadows of past losses.\n\nHer mother, Ekaete, had been her only ally, albeit a reluctant one. Ekaete's eyes, dark and deep as the village well, had filled with worry as she listened to Chichi's arguments. \"I don't understand it,\" she had said, her voice trembling with the weight of a lifetime of conformity. \"But I will stand by you, my daughter. You are the light of my life, and I cannot bear to see you suffer.\"\n\nAs the weeks passed, Chichi and Ekaete had grown closer, their bond forged in the crucible of the village's judgment. Ekaete had accompanied her daughter to the city for every appointment, her presence a comforting reminder of home even amidst the sterile corridors and antiseptic smells. The doctors had been kind, their reassurances a balm to Chichi's anxious heart.\n\nThe day of the birth dawned clear and bright, the sky a brilliant blue canvas stretched over the world. Chichi had felt a surge of excitement and trepidation as she was wheeled into the delivery room, Ekaete's hand clasped tightly in hers. \"You are strong,\" Ekaete had whispered, her voice a steady anchor. \"You are my brave girl.\"\n\nHours later, the cries of a newborn filled the room, a sound that brought tears of joy to Chichi's eyes. She looked down at the tiny, perfect face of her daughter, and in that moment, all the fear and doubt melted away. She had done it. She had brought new life into the world, and in doing so, she had forged a new path for herself and her family.\n\nBut joy can be fleeting, and fate has a way of testing even the strongest of wills. As the days turned into weeks, Chichi noticed that her daughter, Amara, was not thriving as she should. The doctors spoke in hushed tones of complications and anomalies, their words a cruel echo of the village's warnings. Chichi's heart ached with the weight of it, and she turned to Ekaete for solace.\n\n\"We will get through this,\" Ekaete said, her voice unwavering. \"We are strong, Chichi. We have always been strong.\"\n\nBut despite their strength, despite their unwavering love, Amara's tiny body could not fight the unseen battle. One cold, silent night, as the village slept under a blanket of stars, Amara slipped away, leaving Chichi and Ekaete to grapple with a grief that felt as vast and unfathomable as the ocean.\n\nThe village mourned with them, but the whispers returned, sharper and more insidious. \"She defied our ways,\" they said. \"This is the price she pays.\" Chichi felt the sting of their judgment like a thousand tiny cuts, each one deepening the wound of her loss.\n\nEkaete stood by her daughter, her presence a shield against the storm. \"You did what you believed was best,\" she said, her voice a steady beacon in the darkness. \"Do not let their words break you.\"\n\nBut Chichi's heart was heavy with guilt and doubt. She replayed every decision, every moment, searching for the point where she had gone wrong. The weight of it threatened to crush her, to drown her in a sea of regret.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows over the village, Chichi and Ekaete sat by the river that wound its way through the fields. The water flowed gently, a soothing murmur that spoke of continuity and change. Chichi stared into the depths, her reflection a distorted, sorrowful visage.\n\n\"Mother,\" she said, her voice barely a whisper. \"Do you think I was wrong? Do you think I brought this upon us?\"\n\nEkaete turned to her daughter, her eyes filled with a fierce, unwavering love. \"No, Chichi,\" she said firmly. \"You did what you believed was best for Amara. You wanted to protect her, to give her the best chance at life. That is not wrong. That is love.\"\n\n\"But the village\u2014\"\n\n\"The village will always have its whispers,\" Ekaete interrupted gently. \"But they do not know your heart. They do not know the depth of your love or the strength of your spirit. You must find a way to forgive yourself, to understand that you did everything you could.\"\n\nChichi nodded, tears streaming down her face. She leaned into her mother's embrace, feeling the warmth and solidity of her presence. They sat together as the stars began to twinkle overhead, a silent testament to the enduring bond between mother and daughter.\n\nIn the days that followed, Chichi found small moments of solace. She tended to the garden behind their home, her hands working the soil, planting seeds that would one day bloom into vibrant flowers. She visited Amara's grave, leaving fresh flowers and whispering words of love and apology. She listened to Ekaete's stories, tales of strength and resilience that reminded her of the legacy she carried.\n\nSlowly, the weight of guilt and shame began to lift, replaced by a quiet determination. Chichi knew she could not change the past, but she could honor Amara's memory by living a life of purpose and love. She began to help other women in the village, sharing her knowledge and experiences, offering support and understanding.\n\nThe whispers never completely ceased, but they lost their power to wound. Chichi held her head high, knowing that she had faced the storm and emerged stronger. She had defied tradition, and though the cost had been great, she had forged a new path, one that honored both the past and the future.\n\nEkaete watched her daughter with pride and love, knowing that Chichi's strength and courage would inspire others. Together, they navigated the complexities of their world, finding a balance between tradition and modernity, between loss and hope. And in the quiet moments, when the village was still and the stars shone brightly above, they felt the presence of Amara, a gentle, guiding light in their hearts.\n\nYears passed, and the village changed in subtle ways. New customs blended with the old, and the rigid boundaries of tradition softened. Chichi's story became a part of the village's tapestry, a testament to the power of love and the resilience of the human spirit.\n\nOne day, as Chichi walked through the village square, she saw a group of young girls gathered by the meeting house. They were listening to Ekaete, who was sharing one of her many stories. Chichi paused, a smile tugging at her lips as she watched her mother captivate the audience with her words.\n\nEkaete caught her daughter's eye and beckoned her over. \"Come, Chichi,\" she said. \"Tell them about Amara. Tell them about the strength of a mother's love.\"\n\nChichi joined the circle, her heart swelling with pride and gratitude. She took a deep breath and began to speak, her voice steady and clear. She told them of her journey, of the choices she had made and the lessons she had learned. She spoke of Amara, of the love that had guided her every step, and of the hope that had carried her through the darkest days.\n\nAs she spoke, Chichi felt a sense of peace and purpose. She knew that her story would live on, a beacon of hope for future generations. And in that moment, surrounded by the warmth of her community and the love of her family, she felt Amara's presence, a gentle whisper of reassurance and love.\n\nThe village square, once a place of judgment and whispers, now resonated with the sound of laughter and stories. Chichi looked around at the faces of the young girls, seeing in their eyes the promise of a future where tradition and modernity could coexist, where love and resilience could overcome any challenge.\n\nAs the sun set and the stars began to appear, Chichi felt a deep sense of contentment. She had navigated the storm, and though the journey had been fraught with pain and loss, she had emerged stronger, her spirit unbroken. She had honored Amara's memory by living a life of purpose and love, and in doing so, she had found a way to heal.\n\nChichi and Ekaete walked home together, their steps in sync, their hearts connected by an unbreakable bond. They spoke of the future, of the dreams they held for the village and for each other. And as they reached their home, Chichi looked up at the sky, feeling a deep sense of gratitude and peace.\n\nIn the quiet of the night, as they sat together by the fire, Ekaete took Chichi's hand in hers. \"You are my brave girl,\" she said softly. \"You have faced the storm and come through stronger. Amara would be proud of you.\"\n\nChichi smiled, her heart full. \"And I am proud of you, Mother. For standing by me, for loving me unconditionally. We have walked this path together, and I could not have done it without you.\"\n\nEkaete squeezed her daughter's hand, her eyes shining with love and pride. \"We are strong, Chichi. We always have been, and we always will be.\"\n\nAs the fire crackled and the night deepened, Chichi and Ekaete sat together, their hearts full of love and hope. They knew that the journey ahead would not be easy, but they were ready to face it together, their bond unbreakable, their spirits resilient.\n\nAnd in the stillness of the night, as the village slept and the stars shone brightly above, Chichi felt a sense of peace and purpose. She had defied tradition, faced the storm, and emerged stronger. She had honored Amara's memory by living a life of love and resilience, and in doing so, she had found a way to heal.\n\nThe village would continue to change, blending the old with the new, but Chichi knew that the strength of a mother's love and the resilience of the human spirit would always endure. And in that knowledge, she found a deep and abiding sense of hope.\n\nAs the first light of dawn began to break, Chichi and Ekaete rose to face a new day, their hearts filled with love and determination. They knew that the journey ahead would be filled with challenges, but they were ready to face them together, their bond unbreakable, their spirits resilient.\n\nAnd in the quiet moments, when the world was still and the stars shone brightly above, they felt the presence of Amara, a gentle, guiding light in their hearts, a testament to the enduring power of love and the resilience of the human spirit.",
        "story_b": "The sun loomed high over the village, casting long shadows across the tightly packed huts of thatched roofs and clay walls. A gentle breeze rustled through the palm fronds, whispering the age-old secrets of a place where tradition governed every heartbeat. But today, the air felt charged, tense, as if the very earth held its breath.\n\nChichi stood at the edge of the village square, her gaze fixed on the horizon. She was aware of the eyes upon her, the silent judgment woven into each sideways glance and murmured conversation. Her heart pounded with a defiant rhythm, echoing the decision she had made\u2014a decision that had set her at odds with everything the village held sacred.\n\n\"Chichi,\" the voice was low, resonant, a gentle reprimand cloaked in concern. It was Elder Nnamdi, his presence commanding respect, his face etched with the lines of a life steeped in tradition. \"You must reconsider this path you have chosen.\"\n\nChichi met his gaze, unflinching. \"I have given this much thought, Elder. This is what I want.\" Her voice was steady, yet beneath the surface, a torrent of emotions churned.\n\n\"This modern method you speak of,\" Elder Nnamdi continued, his tone softening, \"it is not our way. The ancestors\u2014\"\n\n\"The ancestors,\" Chichi interrupted, her frustration seeping through, \"they lived in their time, and we live in ours. Does every new thing defy them, or do we simply continue what they began?\"\n\nNnamdi sighed, a sound heavy with the weight of generations. \"Childbirth is sacred. It is a passage, a connection to our past, to those who came before us. You must not sever that bond.\"\n\nBut Chichi had already made her choice. She turned away from the elder, her heart a storm of conviction and doubt, and walked back to her mother\u2019s hut. The path was well-trodden, yet each step felt like a journey into the unknown.\n\nHer mother, Adaeze, was waiting by the entrance, her face a canvas of worry and resilience. She reached out, pulling Chichi into an embrace that spoke of comfort and understanding. \"My daughter,\" Adaeze whispered, her voice barely audible over the rustling leaves, \"are you sure?\"\n\nChichi nodded, though her resolve wavered in the warmth of her mother\u2019s arms. \"I am sure, Mama. This is my choice.\"\n\nAdaeze pulled back, her eyes searching Chichi\u2019s for the truth behind her words. She saw the flicker of fear, the glimmer of hope, and most of all, the determination that had always defined her daughter. \"Then we will face this together,\" she said, her voice firm. \"Whatever comes, we will face it together.\"\n\nAnd so, the days passed, each one a step closer to the moment that would change everything. The village continued its life around them, a tapestry of rituals and routines, woven with the threads of history. Yet, beneath the surface, there was an undercurrent of tension, a ripple of unease that touched every corner, every heart.\n\nThe whispers grew louder, a storm of shadows that followed Chichi and Adaeze wherever they went. \"She defies the ancestors,\" some said, shaking their heads in disapproval. \"She brings shame upon us all,\" others muttered, their eyes averted in disdain.\n\nChichi bore the weight of their words in silence, her resolve unbroken. But in the quiet moments, when the world was still and the night stretched long, she felt the tendrils of doubt creeping in. Would she be strong enough to face what lay ahead? Could she bear the consequences of her choice?\n\nThe day arrived, as all days do, without fanfare or warning. The sun rose, casting its golden light over the village, and Chichi knew that the time had come. She felt the first stirrings of pain, a reminder of the life growing within her, and with it came a surge of fear and excitement.\n\nAdaeze was by her side, her presence a balm to Chichi\u2019s frayed nerves. They made their way to the clinic, a small building on the outskirts of the village, its modernity a stark contrast to the ancient landscape. It was here that Chichi would bring her child into the world, defying tradition, embracing change.\n\nThe hours passed in a blur of pain and anticipation, the world narrowing to the confines of the room, the rhythmic beeping of machines a strange symphony to Chichi\u2019s ears. She focused on her breathing, on the gentle guidance of the doctor, on the promise of new life just within reach.\n\nBut fate, it seemed, had other plans.\n\nThe tragedy struck with the force of a storm, sudden and unforgiving. In the aftermath, there was silence\u2014a silence so profound it seemed to swallow the world whole. Chichi lay still, her body exhausted, her mind adrift in a sea of confusion and disbelief.\n\nAdaeze was there, holding her daughter\u2019s hand, her own heart breaking with the weight of what had been lost. The child, a small, fragile thing, lay wrapped in a blanket, a life that had barely begun now ended too soon.\n\nThe village was a living organism, and the news spread through it like wildfire, igniting the whispers anew. \"It is a punishment,\" some said, their voices tinged with a morbid satisfaction. \"She brought this upon herself,\" others concluded, the judgment in their words a blade that cut deep.\n\nChichi and Adaeze returned to their hut, their world irrevocably changed. The days that followed were a blur of grief and silence, punctuated by the whispers that seemed to grow louder with each passing moment. The village watched, a silent jury, as mother and daughter navigated the treacherous waters of loss and shame.\n\nAdaeze found solace in her work, her hands busy with the tasks that had always grounded her. She cooked and cleaned, tended to the small garden behind their hut, her movements a dance of necessity and ritual. But in the quiet moments, when the world was still and the night stretched long, she wept\u2014for the grandchild she would never know, for the daughter who bore a burden too great to carry alone.\n\nChichi was a shadow of herself, her laughter gone, her spirit dimmed. She wandered the village in silence, her eyes downcast, her heart heavy with the weight of her choices. Each step was a reminder of what she had lost, each whispered word a dagger that twisted in her soul.\n\nOne afternoon, as the sun dipped low in the sky, casting the village in a warm, golden glow, Chichi found herself drawn to the river. It was a place of solace, a sanctuary where she could escape the whispers, if only for a moment. She sat at the water\u2019s edge, her reflection a ghostly figure in the rippling surface.\n\nThe river was a living thing, its currents a tapestry of movement and sound. It whispered to her, a gentle lullaby that spoke of healing and hope, of the promise of renewal. She closed her eyes, letting the sound wash over her, and for the first time since the tragedy, she allowed herself to feel.\n\nGrief was a river, relentless and unyielding, carving its path through her heart. It was a part of her now, a shadow that would walk with her always. But in its depths, there was also strength\u2014a strength she had not known she possessed.\n\nIn that moment, she understood that she could not change the past, could not undo the choices she had made. But she could choose how to move forward, how to honor the life that had been lost. She could choose to heal, to find a way to live with the shadows that followed her.\n\nRising to her feet, Chichi took a deep breath, the air cool and crisp against her skin. She turned away from the river, her steps sure and steady, and made her way back to the village. The whispers would not cease, the judgment would not fade, but she was ready to face it.\n\nAs she approached her hut, she saw her mother waiting by the door, her face a canvas of love and understanding. Chichi met her gaze, a silent exchange passing between them\u2014a promise of healing, of hope, of a future they would face together.\n\nThat night, as the village settled into slumber, Chichi and Adaeze sat by the fire, the flames casting a warm glow over their faces. They spoke of the child they had lost, of the life that had been and the life that would be. They spoke of the whispers, the shadows, and the strength they had found in each other.\n\nAnd in the quiet moments, when the world was still and the night stretched long, Chichi allowed herself to dream. She dreamed of a time when the whispers would fade, when the village would see her not as a defiant daughter, but as a mother who had loved and lost, and loved still.\n\nIt was a dream woven with hope, a dream that would guide her through the days to come. For in the end, she understood that healing was not a destination, but a journey\u2014a journey she was ready to take, one step at a time.\n\nThe village would continue its life around them, a tapestry of rituals and routines, woven with the threads of history. And Chichi and Adaeze would find their place within it, their story a testament to the power of love and the strength of the human spirit.\n\nFor in the heart of the village, beneath the weight of history and expectation, there was room for change, for growth, for new beginnings. And Chichi, with her heart full of hope and her spirit unbroken, was ready to embrace it.",
