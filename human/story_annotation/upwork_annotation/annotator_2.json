        "ground_truth": "# Curtain Call for Dr. Dramatis\n\nDr. George Malicetti (formerly known as Dr. Dramatis, Terror of Theater District) was peacefully deadheading his roses when he got The Call.\n\n\u00abGrandpa?\u00bb Sophie\u2019s voice was small, even for a five-year-old. \u00abMs. Primsworth says I can\u2019t be a tree anymore. She says I have to do... backstage.\u00bb\n\nGeorge\u2019s secateurs crushed a perfectly innocent rose stem. In his former life, such an insult would have resulted in a dramatic thunderstorm over the offender\u2019s house for at least a week. But he was retired. Reformed. Respectable.\n\n\u00abTell me everything, mein Schatz,\u00bb he said, already mentally calculating how much of his old equipment was still functional.\n\nApparently, Ms. Primsworth had decided Sophie was \u00abtoo enthusiastic\u00bb about being a tree. \u00abDistracting,\u00bb she\u2019d said. \u00abTrees should be still.\u00bb\n\nGeorge looked at his garden\u2019s prize-winning roses, which definitely didn\u2019t dance in time to classical music when nobody was watching. Absolutely not.\n\n\u00abBackstage is very important,\u00bb he told Sophie, while his free hand typed out a message to his former minions (now running \u201eDramatic Solutions LLC - We Make Your Events Villainously Good\u201c). \u00abIn fact, it\u2019s where the real magic happens.\u00bb\n\n\u00abReally?\u00bb Sophie sniffled.\n\n\u00abOh yes. Now, does your Kindergarten have a loading dock?\u00bb\n\nThree days later, George arrived at Little Sprouts Kindergarten wearing his most normal-looking cardigan (which only had three hidden pockets) and carrying a toolbox that definitely didn\u2019t contain repurposed weather-control miniatures.\n\n\u00abMr. Malicetti!\u00bb Ms. Primsworth\u2019s smile was as plastic as his reformed citizen act. \u00abHow... involved of you to volunteer.\u00bb\n\n\u00abOh, I dabbled in theater back in the day,\u00bb he said, which wasn\u2019t technically a lie. Threatening to destroy the Metropolitan Opera unless they cast his preferred soprano had involved quite a bit of theater.\n\n\u00abWe\u2019re very simple here,\u00bb she said firmly. \u00abJust some cardboard trees and-\u00bb\n\n\u00abBEHOLD!\u00bb George winced. Old habits. More calmly: \u00abI mean, let me show you some sketches.\u00bb\n\nHis old lair\u2019s drafting table had worked overtime. The designs were perfect: elaborate enough to be magical, simple enough to seem possible. Probably.\n\nOver the next week, George deployed every non-lethal trick in his former arsenal. The trees Sophie had wanted to play? They would dance, but only when the script called for it. The enchanted forest would have actual twinkling lights (powered by a scaled-down version of his old death ray, converted to run on AA batteries).\n\nHis old nemesis, Captain Spotlight, now retired and going by Jim from Accounting, spotted him rigging the lighting system.\n\n\u00abDramatis?\u00bb Jim squinted up at the ladder.\n\n\u00abIt\u2019s just George now,\u00bb George said, carefully not activating the trap door under Jim\u2019s feet. \u00abAnd it\u2019s all legitimate.\u00bb\n\nJim watched him install another perfectly-focused spotlight. \u00abYour granddaughter?\u00bb\n\n\u00abSophie. They wouldn\u2019t let her be a tree.\u00bb\n\n\u00abAh.\u00bb Jim nodded sagely. \u00abNeed help with the rigging?\u00bb\n\nTogether, they created effects that would have made Broadway jealous. Everything was technically within budget, if you didn\u2019t ask too many questions about where the \u00abdonated materials\u00bb came from.\n\nSophie thrived backstage. George taught her the basics of theatrical magic - the kind that didn\u2019t require actual weather manipulation. She learned to cue lights, manage scene changes, and coordinate the other children who\u2019d been \u00abrelegated\u00bb to backstage work.\n\nThe night of the show arrived. George sat in the back, officially manning the main controls, unofficially ready to deploy emergency glitter if needed. His daughter and son-in-law were in the audience, unaware that the theatrical genius they were about to witness had anything to do with the father they hadn\u2019t spoken to in years.\n\nThe show began. Trees danced (on cue). Snow fell (hypoallergenic). Fog rolled in (non-toxic). Scene changes happened like magic (literally, but nobody needed to know that).\n\nDuring intermission, he heard Ms. Primsworth telling another teacher, \u00abI had no idea we had such talented backstage children!\u00bb\n\nSophie found him at his control panel. \u00abGrandpa! Did you see? Did you see how everyone clapped when the forest grew?\u00bb\n\n\u00abYou did that perfectly, mein Schatz. Timing is everything in sh- theater.\u00bb\n\nAfter the show, amid the chaos of proud parents and sugar-rushed kindergarteners, George\u2019s daughter approached his control booth.\n\n\u00abDad?\u00bb She looked at the elaborate setup, then at Sophie proudly showing other kids how to work the fog machine. \u00abThis was you?\u00bb\n\n\u00abI just helped with technical things,\u00bb he said. \u00abSophie did all the hard work.\u00bb\n\n\u00abIt\u2019s very... dramatic.\u00bb\n\n\u00abTheater is meant to be dramatic.\u00bb He hesitated. \u00abThe birthday party invitations are still open, you know. For Sophie.\u00bb\n\nShe looked at him for a long moment. \u00abMaybe... maybe we could do coffee first?\u00bb\n\nGeorge smiled. No maniacal laughter, no thunder crashes. Just a grandfather who\u2019d learned that the best special effects were the ones that brought people together.\n\nThough he did treat himself to one tiny lightning flash on the drive home. For old times\u2018 sake.\n\nAt the next parent-teacher meeting, Ms. Primsworth announced that the spring show would be \u00absomething simpler.\u00bb But by then, the backstage crew had a waiting list.\n\nAnd if anyone noticed that the Little Sprouts Kindergarten had better theatrical effects than the Metropolitan Opera that season, well, that was probably just a coincidence.\n\nProbably.",
        "story_a": "The scent of freshly baked cookies filled the air as Harold stirred his tea, watching the neighborhood kids play in his front yard. Life had finally slowed down, giving him peace in his twilight years. No one suspected that the gentle, silver-haired man with a penchant for gardening had once been the feared supervillain known as The Obsidian Shadow.\n\nYears of wreaking havoc, of grand schemes and daring escapes, were behind him. He had traded his costume for cardigans, his sinister plots for Sudoku puzzles. Harold had found solace in the mundane, and he cherished every moment of it.\n\nThat tranquility shattered with the ring of the phone one crisp autumn afternoon.\n\n\"Mr. Blackwell?\" The voice on the other end was strained, a stark contrast to the usual friendly tone of his daughter, Emily. \"It's Emily. Dad, something's happened. It's Jacob. He... he\u2019s missing.\"\n\nHarold's heart sank. Jacob, his six-year-old grandson, was the light of his life. He could hear the panic in Emily's voice, and his own fears echoed back from his past. He knew that even in retirement, the world had not forgotten his legacy.\n\n\"Emily, stay calm. Have you called the police?\" Harold asked, trying to keep his voice steady.\n\n\"Yes, but they haven't found anything yet,\" she replied, her voice breaking. \"Dad, I need you.\"\n\nThose words triggered something deep within him. The Obsidian Shadow had been a persona he\u2019d buried, but for his family, he would unearth it.\n\nHarold hung up the phone and walked to the hidden panel behind his bookshelf. With a creak, it swung open, revealing the dark, sleek costume he hadn\u2019t worn in decades. He donned it, feeling the familiar weight of the obsidian armor, the snug fit of the mask. The transformation was complete; Harold Blackwell was gone, replaced by The Obsidian Shadow.\n\nHe moved swiftly, his senses heightened and body responsive despite the years. The trail to Jacob was faint, but Harold had always been a master of tracking. He followed the clues, piecing together the puzzle that led him to an old, abandoned factory on the outskirts of the city.\n\nThe place was a relic of another era, much like himself. Rusted machinery loomed like skeletal remains, and the air was thick with dust and decay. Harold's eyes, sharp and calculating, scanned the scene. He spotted a faint trail of footprints leading deeper into the factory.\n\n\"Jacob!\" he called out, his voice echoing through the empty halls.\n\nA faint whimper responded, guiding him forward. He moved with purpose, his steps silent and swift. The old skills came flooding back, muscle memory guiding him as he navigated the labyrinthine corridors.\n\nAt last, he found Jacob, tied to a chair in a dimly lit room. The boy's eyes widened with recognition and relief as Harold approached.\n\n\"Grandpa!\" Jacob exclaimed, his voice muffled by the gag.\n\nHarold quickly untied him, pulling him into a tight embrace. \"It's okay, Jacob. I've got you.\"\n\nBut before they could leave, a shadowy figure emerged from the darkness, clapping slowly. \"The Obsidian Shadow. I never thought I'd see the day when you'd come out of retirement.\"\n\nHarold turned to face the newcomer, his eyes narrowing. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Just a fan,\" the man replied with a smirk. \"A fan who wants to see if the legend still has what it takes.\"\n\nHarold recognized the challenge in the man's eyes. He had faced countless adversaries in his time, and this one was no different. \"You're making a mistake,\" Harold said, his voice cold and steady.\n\nThe fight was swift and brutal. Harold's movements were precise, his attacks calculated. He was older, yes, but experience had honed him into a formidable opponent. The man was skilled, but he underestimated the ferocity of a grandfather protecting his family.\n\nIn the end, the man lay defeated, gasping for breath. Harold stood over him, his chest heaving. \"Tell your friends,\" he said, his voice low and dangerous, \"The Obsidian Shadow is done with villainy. But mess with my family, and you\u2019ll wish you never crossed my path.\"\n\nWith Jacob in his arms, Harold walked out of the factory, leaving the past behind once more. As they stepped into the sunlight, Jacob looked up at him with awe. \"Grandpa, you're a hero.\"\n\nHarold smiled, ruffling Jacob's hair. \"No, Jacob. I'm just your grandpa.\"\n\nBut as they made their way home, Harold couldn't help but feel a renewed sense of purpose. The world may have known him as a villain, but for his family, he would always be their protector. And that was a role he would never retire from.",
        "story_b": "## The Gauntlet of Forgotten Glories\n\nIn the quiet suburbs of Greenville, Mr. Mortimer Harkness was known as the friendly retiree who spent his days gardening and spoiling his grandchildren. Little did they know, he once ruled the city as \"The Midnight Phantom,\" a super villain whose name struck fear into the hearts of millions. That life was behind him, or so he thought.\n\nOne crisp autumn evening, Mortimer was trimming his azaleas when his granddaughter, Lily, burst into the garden, tears streaming down her face. \"Grandpa, someone broke into our house! They took Mom's jewelry and my laptop!\"\n\nMortimer's peaceful retirement shattered like a glass window. His family was his sanctuary, and now it had been violated. The Midnight Phantom stirred within him, shaking off the dust of decades.\n\n\"Who did this, Lily?\" he asked, his voice calm but his eyes cold with determination.\n\n\"They left a note,\" she sniffled, handing him a crumpled piece of paper. It read: \"Greetings from The Shadow Syndicate. We have your valuables. Pay up, or else.\"\n\nThe name sent a shiver down Mortimer's spine. The Shadow Syndicate\u2014his old nemesis. They had resurfaced, and they dared to threaten his family. It was time to don the cloak of nostalgia and revisit the fortress of solitude, now a relic of bygone schemes.\n\nIn the basement, hidden behind a false wall, lay his secret lair. Dusty and neglected, it held the remnants of his villainous past: gadgets, costumes, and the AI assistant known as \"The Guardian of Shadows.\"\n\n\"Ah, Master Harkness, it's been ages,\" the AI chimed in, its voice tinged with sarcasm. \"Dusted off the old cape, have we?\"\n\n\"Enough with the commentary, Guardian,\" Mortimer snapped, though a smile tugged at his lips. \"We have work to do.\"\n\nHe spent the night training, upgrading his old gadgets, and reacquainting himself with the tools of his trade. The lair buzzed with activity as he reactivated the security systems and prepared for his comeback. The Guardian of Shadows offered humorous commentary along the way, a constant reminder of the absurdity of his situation.\n\n\"Who knew retirement would be more dangerous than my villainous career?\" Mortimer muttered, strapping on his gauntlets.\n\nThe next day, the news broke: \"Former Villain Back in Action: Neighborhood Watch or Menace?\" The headlines were satirical, critiquing his past and present. Mortimer chuckled at the irony but stayed focused on his mission.\n\nHe tracked the Shadow Syndicate to an abandoned warehouse downtown. The lair, hidden beneath a historical landmark, was a maze of traps and defenses. Mortimer navigated it with ease, his muscle memory guiding him through the dangers. Along the way, he encountered mythical creatures and ancient artifacts\u2014remnants of his old life that now aided his quest.\n\nAt the heart of the lair, he found the Syndicate's leader, a minor demon named Malphas, who had once been his shady financial advisor. \"Mortimer Harkness,\" Malphas sneered, \"I never expected to see you again.\"\n\n\"The feeling's mutual,\" Mortimer replied, his eyes steely. \"You've messed with my family, and now you'll pay.\"\n\nTheir confrontation was both comedic and intense. Malphas, out of practice, struggled to adapt to his role, while Mortimer rediscovered his old skills with surprising ease. They exchanged blows and witty banter, each trying to outwit the other.\n\n\"Time to dust off the old cape\u2014literally,\" Mortimer quipped as he dodged a fireball.\n\nEventually, Mortimer overpowered Malphas, using a combination of old-school methods and upgraded gadgets. He reclaimed the stolen items and ensured the Syndicate's demise. As he stood victorious, he felt a sense of empowerment and rediscovery. The Midnight Phantom was not gone; he had merely evolved.\n\nBack home, Mortimer returned the valuables to his daughter and granddaughter, their faces lighting up with gratitude. \"Grandpa, you're amazing!\" Lily exclaimed, her eyes wide with admiration.\n\n\"Just doing what I had to, sweetheart,\" he replied, ruffling her hair. \"Past villainy does not guarantee future success, but it sure helps.\"\n\nAs he settled back into retirement, Mortimer realized that his journey was far from over. He had found a balance between his past and present, embracing both the peaceful retiree and the determined protector. The Midnight Phantom would always be a part of him, ready to rise whenever his family needed him.\n\nIn the end, Mortimer Harkness was not just a retired super villain; he was a hero in his own right, navigating the absurdities of life with humor, determination, and a touch of whimsy. And as the Guardian of Shadows would say, \"Onward to the next adventure, Master Harkness. The world always needs a bit of midnight magic.\"",

        "story_b": "Harold \"The Havoc\" Hargrove was not your typical retiree. Sure, he spent his mornings tending to his rose garden and his afternoons playing chess with old Mr. Thompson from next door, but behind the serene fa\u00e7ade lay a mind that once masterminded the most audacious heists and escapades the world had ever known. In the small town of Meadowbrook, he was just Harold, the kindly old man with a green thumb and a penchant for baking the best apple pies. Little did his neighbors know, in his youth, he had been The Havoc, a name that still sent shivers down the spines of the world\u2019s greatest heroes.\n\nHis days of villainy were behind him, or so he thought. One sunny afternoon, as he carefully pruned his prized roses, a sleek black car pulled up to his driveway. Out stepped a young man in a suit, his face pallid and eyes frantic. \"Mr. Hargrove,\" he stammered, \"Your family is in danger.\"\n\nHarold\u2019s heart skipped a beat. His daughter, Emily, and his two grandkids were his world. He dropped his shears and hustled inside, the young man following close behind. \"What happened?\" he demanded.\n\nThe man, introducing himself as Agent Collins, quickly explained. \"A rival criminal organization has targeted your daughter to draw you out of retirement. They believe you still have something they want.\"\n\nHarold\u2019s mind raced. He had buried his past deep, but evidently, it wasn\u2019t deep enough. \"What do they want?\" he asked, already knowing the answer.\n\n\"Your old plans,\" Collins replied. \"The blueprints for the Quantum Disruptor. They\u2019re convinced you still have them.\"\n\nHarold had destroyed those plans years ago, but that wouldn\u2019t stop desperate men from believing otherwise. \"Where\u2019s Emily?\" he asked, his voice steely.\n\n\"Safe, for now. But they\u2019re closing in. We need you to come with us.\"\n\nHarold looked around his cozy living room, the walls adorned with family photos and mementos of a life well-lived. His eyes landed on an old chest in the corner, a relic of his past he had hoped never to open again. With a heavy sigh, he walked over and lifted the lid, revealing his old costume\u2014the black and green suit of The Havoc.\n\n\"Time to get the old costume out,\" he muttered.\n\n---\n\nThe van hurtled down the highway, Agent Collins at the wheel and Harold in the back, slipping into his old persona like a well-worn glove. The suit was a bit tight around the middle, and the gadgets seemed almost comically outdated, but it would have to do.\n\nAs they neared the safe house, Collins briefed him on the plan. \"We\u2019ve set up a decoy location to lure the attackers away from your family. You\u2019ll need to outsmart them and lead them into our trap.\"\n\nHarold nodded, his mind already working a mile a minute. \"Leave it to me,\" he said, a wicked grin spreading across his face. \"I\u2019ve got a few tricks left up my sleeve.\"\n\nThe safe house was a nondescript cabin in the woods, surrounded by dense foliage. Inside, Emily and the kids were huddled together, fear etched on their faces. Harold embraced them tightly, feeling a surge of determination. No one messed with his family.\n\n\"Stay here,\" he instructed, \"and don\u2019t open the door for anyone but me.\"\n\nOutside, the night was closing in. Harold set up a series of traps around the perimeter, using his knowledge of the terrain to his advantage. Soon, the sound of approaching footsteps reached his ears. The attackers were here.\n\nFrom the shadows, Harold watched as they triggered his traps one by one\u2014nets, tripwires, and smoke bombs disorienting them. With a final flourish, he activated the old hologram projector, creating multiple illusions of himself that sent the attackers into a frenzy.\n\nUsing the chaos to his advantage, Harold slipped through the shadows, reaching the leader of the group. \"Looking for me?\" he quipped, delivering a swift blow that knocked the man out cold.\n\nThe rest of the attackers, now thoroughly confused and demoralized, were quickly apprehended by Collins and his team. As the dust settled, Harold stood tall, a sense of satisfaction washing over him. He hadn\u2019t lost his touch.\n\nBack at the cabin, Emily and the kids rushed out to embrace him. \"Dad, are you okay?\" Emily asked, tears of relief in her eyes.\n\nHarold smiled, hugging her tightly. \"I\u2019m fine, sweetheart. Just a little trip down memory lane.\"\n\nAs they drove back to Meadowbrook, Harold couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. His old costume might be outdated, and his body might ache in places he didn\u2019t know existed, but some things never changed. The love for his family and the lengths he would go to protect them were as strong as ever.\n\nAnd as for his peaceful retirement? Well, it seemed that even in the twilight of his years, The Havoc still had a few adventures left in him.",

        "ground_truth": "# Curtain Call for Dr. Dramatis\n\nDr. George Malicetti (formerly known as Dr. Dramatis, Terror of Theater District) was peacefully deadheading his roses when he got The Call.\n\n\u00abGrandpa?\u00bb Sophie\u2019s voice was small, even for a five-year-old. \u00abMs. Primsworth says I can\u2019t be a tree anymore. She says I have to do... backstage.\u00bb\n\nGeorge\u2019s secateurs crushed a perfectly innocent rose stem. In his former life, such an insult would have resulted in a dramatic thunderstorm over the offender\u2019s house for at least a week. But he was retired. Reformed. Respectable.\n\n\u00abTell me everything, mein Schatz,\u00bb he said, already mentally calculating how much of his old equipment was still functional.\n\nApparently, Ms. Primsworth had decided Sophie was \u00abtoo enthusiastic\u00bb about being a tree. \u00abDistracting,\u00bb she\u2019d said. \u00abTrees should be still.\u00bb\n\nGeorge looked at his garden\u2019s prize-winning roses, which definitely didn\u2019t dance in time to classical music when nobody was watching. Absolutely not.\n\n\u00abBackstage is very important,\u00bb he told Sophie, while his free hand typed out a message to his former minions (now running \u201eDramatic Solutions LLC - We Make Your Events Villainously Good\u201c). \u00abIn fact, it\u2019s where the real magic happens.\u00bb\n\n\u00abReally?\u00bb Sophie sniffled.\n\n\u00abOh yes. Now, does your Kindergarten have a loading dock?\u00bb\n\nThree days later, George arrived at Little Sprouts Kindergarten wearing his most normal-looking cardigan (which only had three hidden pockets) and carrying a toolbox that definitely didn\u2019t contain repurposed weather-control miniatures.\n\n\u00abMr. Malicetti!\u00bb Ms. Primsworth\u2019s smile was as plastic as his reformed citizen act. \u00abHow... involved of you to volunteer.\u00bb\n\n\u00abOh, I dabbled in theater back in the day,\u00bb he said, which wasn\u2019t technically a lie. Threatening to destroy the Metropolitan Opera unless they cast his preferred soprano had involved quite a bit of theater.\n\n\u00abWe\u2019re very simple here,\u00bb she said firmly. \u00abJust some cardboard trees and-\u00bb\n\n\u00abBEHOLD!\u00bb George winced. Old habits. More calmly: \u00abI mean, let me show you some sketches.\u00bb\n\nHis old lair\u2019s drafting table had worked overtime. The designs were perfect: elaborate enough to be magical, simple enough to seem possible. Probably.\n\nOver the next week, George deployed every non-lethal trick in his former arsenal. The trees Sophie had wanted to play? They would dance, but only when the script called for it. The enchanted forest would have actual twinkling lights (powered by a scaled-down version of his old death ray, converted to run on AA batteries).\n\nHis old nemesis, Captain Spotlight, now retired and going by Jim from Accounting, spotted him rigging the lighting system.\n\n\u00abDramatis?\u00bb Jim squinted up at the ladder.\n\n\u00abIt\u2019s just George now,\u00bb George said, carefully not activating the trap door under Jim\u2019s feet. \u00abAnd it\u2019s all legitimate.\u00bb\n\nJim watched him install another perfectly-focused spotlight. \u00abYour granddaughter?\u00bb\n\n\u00abSophie. They wouldn\u2019t let her be a tree.\u00bb\n\n\u00abAh.\u00bb Jim nodded sagely. \u00abNeed help with the rigging?\u00bb\n\nTogether, they created effects that would have made Broadway jealous. Everything was technically within budget, if you didn\u2019t ask too many questions about where the \u00abdonated materials\u00bb came from.\n\nSophie thrived backstage. George taught her the basics of theatrical magic - the kind that didn\u2019t require actual weather manipulation. She learned to cue lights, manage scene changes, and coordinate the other children who\u2019d been \u00abrelegated\u00bb to backstage work.\n\nThe night of the show arrived. George sat in the back, officially manning the main controls, unofficially ready to deploy emergency glitter if needed. His daughter and son-in-law were in the audience, unaware that the theatrical genius they were about to witness had anything to do with the father they hadn\u2019t spoken to in years.\n\nThe show began. Trees danced (on cue). Snow fell (hypoallergenic). Fog rolled in (non-toxic). Scene changes happened like magic (literally, but nobody needed to know that).\n\nDuring intermission, he heard Ms. Primsworth telling another teacher, \u00abI had no idea we had such talented backstage children!\u00bb\n\nSophie found him at his control panel. \u00abGrandpa! Did you see? Did you see how everyone clapped when the forest grew?\u00bb\n\n\u00abYou did that perfectly, mein Schatz. Timing is everything in sh- theater.\u00bb\n\nAfter the show, amid the chaos of proud parents and sugar-rushed kindergarteners, George\u2019s daughter approached his control booth.\n\n\u00abDad?\u00bb She looked at the elaborate setup, then at Sophie proudly showing other kids how to work the fog machine. \u00abThis was you?\u00bb\n\n\u00abI just helped with technical things,\u00bb he said. \u00abSophie did all the hard work.\u00bb\n\n\u00abIt\u2019s very... dramatic.\u00bb\n\n\u00abTheater is meant to be dramatic.\u00bb He hesitated. \u00abThe birthday party invitations are still open, you know. For Sophie.\u00bb\n\nShe looked at him for a long moment. \u00abMaybe... maybe we could do coffee first?\u00bb\n\nGeorge smiled. No maniacal laughter, no thunder crashes. Just a grandfather who\u2019d learned that the best special effects were the ones that brought people together.\n\nThough he did treat himself to one tiny lightning flash on the drive home. For old times\u2018 sake.\n\nAt the next parent-teacher meeting, Ms. Primsworth announced that the spring show would be \u00absomething simpler.\u00bb But by then, the backstage crew had a waiting list.\n\nAnd if anyone noticed that the Little Sprouts Kindergarten had better theatrical effects than the Metropolitan Opera that season, well, that was probably just a coincidence.\n\nProbably.",
        "story_a": "The scent of freshly baked cookies filled the air as Harold stirred his tea, watching the neighborhood kids play in his front yard. Life had finally slowed down, giving him peace in his twilight years. No one suspected that the gentle, silver-haired man with a penchant for gardening had once been the feared supervillain known as The Obsidian Shadow.\n\nYears of wreaking havoc, of grand schemes and daring escapes, were behind him. He had traded his costume for cardigans, his sinister plots for Sudoku puzzles. Harold had found solace in the mundane, and he cherished every moment of it.\n\nThat tranquility shattered with the ring of the phone one crisp autumn afternoon.\n\n\"Mr. Blackwell?\" The voice on the other end was strained, a stark contrast to the usual friendly tone of his daughter, Emily. \"It's Emily. Dad, something's happened. It's Jacob. He... he\u2019s missing.\"\n\nHarold's heart sank. Jacob, his six-year-old grandson, was the light of his life. He could hear the panic in Emily's voice, and his own fears echoed back from his past. He knew that even in retirement, the world had not forgotten his legacy.\n\n\"Emily, stay calm. Have you called the police?\" Harold asked, trying to keep his voice steady.\n\n\"Yes, but they haven't found anything yet,\" she replied, her voice breaking. \"Dad, I need you.\"\n\nThose words triggered something deep within him. The Obsidian Shadow had been a persona he\u2019d buried, but for his family, he would unearth it.\n\nHarold hung up the phone and walked to the hidden panel behind his bookshelf. With a creak, it swung open, revealing the dark, sleek costume he hadn\u2019t worn in decades. He donned it, feeling the familiar weight of the obsidian armor, the snug fit of the mask. The transformation was complete; Harold Blackwell was gone, replaced by The Obsidian Shadow.\n\nHe moved swiftly, his senses heightened and body responsive despite the years. The trail to Jacob was faint, but Harold had always been a master of tracking. He followed the clues, piecing together the puzzle that led him to an old, abandoned factory on the outskirts of the city.\n\nThe place was a relic of another era, much like himself. Rusted machinery loomed like skeletal remains, and the air was thick with dust and decay. Harold's eyes, sharp and calculating, scanned the scene. He spotted a faint trail of footprints leading deeper into the factory.\n\n\"Jacob!\" he called out, his voice echoing through the empty halls.\n\nA faint whimper responded, guiding him forward. He moved with purpose, his steps silent and swift. The old skills came flooding back, muscle memory guiding him as he navigated the labyrinthine corridors.\n\nAt last, he found Jacob, tied to a chair in a dimly lit room. The boy's eyes widened with recognition and relief as Harold approached.\n\n\"Grandpa!\" Jacob exclaimed, his voice muffled by the gag.\n\nHarold quickly untied him, pulling him into a tight embrace. \"It's okay, Jacob. I've got you.\"\n\nBut before they could leave, a shadowy figure emerged from the darkness, clapping slowly. \"The Obsidian Shadow. I never thought I'd see the day when you'd come out of retirement.\"\n\nHarold turned to face the newcomer, his eyes narrowing. \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Just a fan,\" the man replied with a smirk. \"A fan who wants to see if the legend still has what it takes.\"\n\nHarold recognized the challenge in the man's eyes. He had faced countless adversaries in his time, and this one was no different. \"You're making a mistake,\" Harold said, his voice cold and steady.\n\nThe fight was swift and brutal. Harold's movements were precise, his attacks calculated. He was older, yes, but experience had honed him into a formidable opponent. The man was skilled, but he underestimated the ferocity of a grandfather protecting his family.\n\nIn the end, the man lay defeated, gasping for breath. Harold stood over him, his chest heaving. \"Tell your friends,\" he said, his voice low and dangerous, \"The Obsidian Shadow is done with villainy. But mess with my family, and you\u2019ll wish you never crossed my path.\"\n\nWith Jacob in his arms, Harold walked out of the factory, leaving the past behind once more. As they stepped into the sunlight, Jacob looked up at him with awe. \"Grandpa, you're a hero.\"\n\nHarold smiled, ruffling Jacob's hair. \"No, Jacob. I'm just your grandpa.\"\n\nBut as they made their way home, Harold couldn't help but feel a renewed sense of purpose. The world may have known him as a villain, but for his family, he would always be their protector. And that was a role he would never retire from.",
        "story_b": "The afternoon sun cast a warm glow over the garden, where Gerald Thompson knelt beside a row of blooming marigolds. He hummed a tune from an old musical, the melody weaving through the gentle rustle of leaves. Retirement had been a blessing\u2014a chance to cultivate beauty rather than chaos, to nurture life instead of plots for world domination. The neighborhood kids called him \"Mr. T,\" a nod to his past he found humorously ironic.\n\nAs he admired the vibrant petals, his phone buzzed on the garden table. Gerald wiped his hands on his pants and answered. The voice on the other end was unfamiliar, cold as ice.\n\n\"We know who you are, Dr. Chaos. We've got your granddaughter.\"\n\nThe phone slipped from his fingers, crashing into the soil. Gerald\u2019s heart pounded against his ribs, his peaceful world suddenly shattered. He thought of little Emily, her innocent laugh echoing in his mind. Panic and resolve clashed within him, the old instincts stirring from their long slumber.\n\nHe stood up, brushing off the earth, and headed towards the old toolshed at the end of the yard\u2014a relic of his former life, hidden beneath mundane gardening supplies. Inside, he pushed aside a stack of fertilizer bags to reveal a trapdoor. Dust swirled as he descended into the dimly lit cellar.\n\nThe lair was just as he had left it, though cobwebs now draped over the once-glorious array of gadgets and costumes. In the corner, his old suit lay in a heap\u2014a patchwork of dark leather and armored plates, now looking somewhat outdated. He chuckled dryly, the sound reverberating in the confined space.\n\n\"Time to see if this still fits,\" he muttered, pulling the suit from its resting place.\n\nHe struggled to fasten the clasps, grumbling as he squeezed into it. The fabric groaned in protest, much like his knees as he bent to adjust the boots. Catching sight of himself in a dusty mirror, Gerald shook his head. \"Dr. Chaos, the paunchy edition,\" he quipped.\n\nNext, he rummaged through the shelves, searching for his old gadgets. He found a handheld EMP device, once cutting-edge but now likely obsolete. A flicker of nostalgia turned to frustration as it sparked and fizzled in his hand. \"Figures,\" he sighed, tossing it aside.\n\nStill, he managed to salvage a few trinkets\u2014smoke bombs, a grappling hook\u2014and stuffed them into a utility belt. From another corner, he retrieved a map of the city, lines crisscrossed with potential escape routes and hideouts. He traced a path with his finger, the plan formulating as his resolve hardened like steel.\n\nThe night was his ally as he emerged from the cellar, the shadows embracing his transformation. The air felt alive with possibility, a stark contrast to the serene garden he left behind. The thrill of the chase, the scent of danger\u2014it was intoxicating, a reminder of who he had once been.\n\nHis first stop was an old haunt, a defunct observatory on the outskirts of town. There, he found Max \"The Gearhead\" Miller, an old ally turned mechanic. Max was elbow-deep in the engine of a classic car, grease smeared across his cheeks.\n\n\"Well, if it isn't Dr. Chaos,\" Max greeted, wiping his hands on a rag. \"Heard you retired.\"\n\n\"Didn't take,\" Gerald replied, explaining the situation.\n\nMax nodded, his expression somber. \"I've got just the thing.\" He led Gerald to a back room, unveiling a sleek, updated version of the EMP device. \"Consider it a prototype.\"\n\nWith the new device in hand, Gerald felt a surge of confidence. He exchanged a few more words with Max before heading out, his path clear.\n\nThe final confrontation took place in a high-rise under construction, its skeletal frame silhouetted against the moonlit sky. Gerald climbed the scaffolding with surprising agility, each step bringing him closer to Emily.\n\nHe found the kidnappers on the top floor, a ragtag group of mercenaries led by a man with a face like a hawk. Emily was bound in the corner, her wide eyes a mix of fear and trust as they locked onto his.\n\nWith a deep breath, Gerald stepped into the open, his voice a growl that echoed through the girders. \"Let her go.\"\n\nThe mercenaries laughed, dismissing the relic before them. But when the prototype EMP device crackled to life, disabling their weapons and lights, the laughter died.\n\nIn the ensuing chaos, Gerald moved with the precision of his younger days. Smoke bombs created cover, confusion reigned, and one by one, the mercenaries fell.\n\nFinally, he reached Emily, her bindings quickly undone. She clung to him, the warmth of her hug more rewarding than any victory of his villainous past.\n\nAs they emerged into the dawn, Gerald knew he had changed. He was no longer Dr. Chaos, but a grandfather, a gardener, and a man who\u2019d found redemption through the love of his family.",

        "ground_truth": "Summer had taken full possession of the Eastern Coast. Washington\u2019s troops were buzzing about the camp, readying for a campaign at Monmouth Courthouse that was to commence four days hence. But that was not the only event that was bringing about both excitement and fear among the men; on the 24th of June, there was to be a solar eclipse that had been reported in newspapers at the beginning of January.\nNothing in Washington\u2019s inner circle had changed despite the solar event. Battle plans were still being drawn up, the office was busy with more correspondence being written, orders were being directed by the Commander-in-Chief of the army. The aides-de-camp were not so busy as that they scarcely discussed topics that were not related to the upcoming battle at dinner. Except for tonight, when they had a reprieve long enough to talk about something else.\n\u201cDid you see the newspaper today? There\u2019s to be a solar eclipse the day after tomorrow.\u201d John said between the bits of his meager stew of salted beef and potatoes.\n\u201cSome of the soldiers are calling it a bad omen it being so close to the upcoming battle.\u201d Alexander sighed and rolled his eyes.\nLafayette shrugged, \u201cI see it as a good omen. The brightness of the Revolution, the periods of darkness where we\u2019ve lost battles, and the sun re-appearing means our cause will shine brightly again with won battles.\u201d\n\u2018You are very optimistic,\nMon Ami\n.\u201d Laurens said with a quirked smile.\n\u201cThough I will admit that I have not ever seen a solar eclipse before in my life. It will be interesting to observe it given the chance.\u201d \u00a0Meade returned.\n\u201cNor I. Let\u2019s just hope we\u2019re not overwhelmed with paperwork.\u201d Hamilton added dryly.\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not going to be hard to miss, really.\u201d Laurens laughed.\nAs the group continued to discuss the upcoming solar eclipse and its possible implications, the conversation in the room shifted again towards the coming battle at Monmouth.\nAlexander would be glad of the distraction of this celestial event to calm his nerves about the fight. There was something in the air that made him uneasy. He felt something was going to go wrong.\n*~*\nThe hours before the eclipse was just as busy as usual. Washington\u2019s aides-de-camp were kept busy with their work, all the while tilting their heads out the window to keep an eye on the sky or their pocket watches.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a few minutes break would go amiss.\u201d Hamilton remarked, putting down his quill and capping his ink.\nLafayette grinned, \u201cYou read my mind, mon ami!\u201d\nThe others chuckled while putting away their writing utensils and pushed back their chairs. Each of them stretched, grateful for the exercise after so many hours seated. They all stepped outside onto the small patch of dirt generously called a lawn and stared up, with their hands over their foreheads to shield them from sunlight.\nMeade pulled out his pocket watch and glanced at it. \u201cIt should be starting any time now. The newspaper said the eclipse should begin at 3:19 pm.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t look as though it has changed.\u201d Alexander remarked squinting up at the sun.\n\u201cAlex, don\u2019t look directly at the sun, you idiot!\u201d Laurens snapped.\nHamilton closed his eyes sharply then winced. He slowly opened them, squinting and shielding them with his hand. He stayed still for a few moments, adjusting to the brightness.\nFinally, at 3:30, as the sky began to dim, the soldiers began to gasp. Lafayette and Laurens leaped up from the stairs.\n\"It's beginning!\" Lafayette shouted, standing on his tiptoes as if trying to catch a glimpse of the sky. \"Look at that!\" Lafayette exclaimed, pointing up at the darkening sky.\nThe Moon slowly began to creep in front of the sun, the group watched in awe as the sky grew darker and a strange twilight settled over the land.\nSlowly, the sun became more and more obscured, the crescent becoming smaller and smaller as the smaller body of the Moon overtook it. \u00a0A sense of anticipation filled the air. Meade felt a shiver run down his spine, a mixture of excitement and wonder at the celestial event unfolding before their eyes.\nThe whole camp seemed to hold its breath as the moon completely covered the sun, casting a shadow over their little part of the world. The temperature dropped, and a hush fell over the group as they experienced the breathtaking beauty of the total solar eclipse.\n\u201c\nC\u2019est Incroyable\n!\u201d Lafayette whispered in awe. \"Mon Dieu! But it\u2019s like dawn!\u201d\n\u201cLook at that bright light at the right corner.\u201d Alexander remarked, \u201cI wonder if that is the sun re-appearing.\u201d He turned, tilting his head while his eyebrows furrowed. \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d He pointed his finger upwards. \u201cThere are no birds chirping now. I think they are just as discombobulated!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a sight isn\u2019t it, gentlemen?\u201d A deep voice from behind them called, making them all whirl around to see the General striding towards them. The group all saluted, looking as though they were ready to take a reprimand.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Excellency,\u201d Hamilton started, \u201cWe did not mean to abandon our duties during such a critical period before a battle-\u201d\nWashington raised his hand. \"No worries. I wouldn't want to miss out on witnessing such a rare celestial phenomenon; one that we might never get to see again.\" He gazed up at the solar eclipse. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a sight to see, no?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think that ring around the sun is, sir?\u201d Alexander wondered.\n\u201cPerhaps,\" Washington replied, raising his chin up to the eclipse, \"it\u2019s the atmosphere of the moon, or that of the sun.\u201d Washington commented.\n\u201cWell, whatever it is, it sure is a beautiful sight,\u201d Laurens added.\n\u201cIt looks like light surrounding a void,\u201d remarked Lafayette with wonder in his voice.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not eerie or anything, Lafayette,\u201d scoffed Meade.\nA few moments later, the moon began to move away from the sun, beginning to chase away the shadows. The ring of light around the sun grew brighter as the moon slowly moved out of its path. The sky gradually began to lighten.\n\u201cSunrise again.\u201d Laughed Alexander, his breath catching as it indeed felt as though dawn was breaking for a second time that day. It wasn\u2019t long before afternoon sunshine returned to the sky. The soldiers murmured but went back to their duties.\nThe group stood in awe as the eclipse passed.\u00a0\u00a0Washington turned to his companions with a smile. \"Well, gentlemen, it seems we have witnessed to something truly extraordinary today. Now, shall we get back to work?\u201d",
        "story_a": "The sky above Washington's camp darkened like ink spilled across parchment, the rare solar eclipse casting an eerie twilight over the soldiers. The air grew thick with tension, a palpable sense of foreboding that settled in their bones. Whispers skittered through the ranks like mice in the walls, each man interpreting the celestial event in his own way. Some saw it as a divine omen, a sign that Providence was with them, while others feared it as a harbinger of doom.\n\nAlexander Hamilton stood at the edge of the camp, his sharp eyes fixed on the sliver of sun still visible through the encroaching shadow. He was not a man given to superstition, but even he could not deny the strangeness of the moment. The usual clamor of the camp had quieted to a murmur, the soldiers\u2019 nervous energy vibrating in the air.\n\n\"Alexander,\" a familiar voice called, cutting through his reverie. He turned to see John Laurens approaching, his brow furrowed with concern. \"Have you heard the rumors?\"\n\nHamilton sighed, running a hand through his hair. \"Which ones? There are so many.\"\n\nLaurens glanced around, ensuring they were out of earshot. \"Some of the men are saying this eclipse is a sign. A warning from God, perhaps. They think it foretells disaster.\"\n\nHamilton raised an eyebrow. \"And what do you think, John? Do you believe the heavens have taken an interest in our little rebellion?\"\n\nLaurens chuckled softly, though his eyes remained serious. \"I don't know what to believe. But I do know that fear can be a dangerous thing in a camp like this. It can spread like wildfire.\"\n\nHamilton nodded, his mind already racing with possibilities. \"We need to address this before it undermines morale. A few well-placed words from General Washington might help.\"\n\nAs if summoned by the mention of his name, General George Washington strode into view, his presence commanding even in the dimming light. Hamilton and Laurens exchanged a glance before approaching their commander.\n\n\"General,\" Hamilton began, \"there are whispers spreading through the camp. The men are unsettled by the eclipse.\"\n\nWashington's expression remained impassive, but his eyes betrayed a flicker of concern. \"What are they saying?\"\n\n\"That it is a sign,\" Laurens replied. \"A warning of impending doom.\"\n\nWashington considered this for a moment, his gaze shifting to the darkening sky. \"Fear is a powerful enemy,\" he said finally. \"We must quash these rumors before they take root.\"\n\nHamilton nodded. \"What do you suggest, sir?\"\n\nWashington's eyes hardened with determination. \"Gather the men. I will address them directly.\"\n\nThe camp bustled as word spread that the General would speak. Soldiers gathered, their faces a mix of apprehension and curiosity. Hamilton and Laurens stood to the side, watching as Washington took his place before the assembled troops.\n\n\"Men,\" Washington began, his voice steady and strong, \"I know that this eclipse has caused unease among you. It is a rare and wondrous event, and such things often stir our deepest fears and hopes. But let me assure you, this is no omen of disaster. It is merely a natural occurrence, a reminder of the vastness of the universe and our small place within it.\"\n\nHe paused, allowing his words to sink in. \"We fight for a cause greater than ourselves, for the freedom and future of our young nation. Do not let fear cloud your resolve. Let this eclipse be a symbol of the challenges we face and the strength we must find within ourselves to overcome them.\"\n\nThe soldiers murmured amongst themselves, the tension in the air beginning to dissipate. Hamilton watched as the General's words took hold, the men standing a little taller, their expressions a little more resolute.\n\nAs Washington stepped down, Hamilton approached him. \"That was well said, sir.\"\n\nWashington nodded. \"Let us hope it is enough.\"\n\nThe eerie twilight of the eclipse continued to cast its shadow, but the camp seemed lighter, the whispers of doom fading into the background. Hamilton felt a sense of relief, though he knew the real battle was far from over.\n\nThat evening, as the camp settled into an uneasy quiet, Hamilton found himself alone by the fire, his thoughts drifting back to the events of the day. The eclipse, with all its strange beauty and unsettling power, had reminded him of the precariousness of their cause. But it had also reminded him of the strength that lay in unity, in the unwavering belief in something greater than themselves.\n\n\"Alexander,\" Laurens' voice broke through his reverie once more. \"Mind if I join you?\"\n\nHamilton gestured to the empty space beside him. \"Not at all.\"\n\nThey sat in companionable silence for a while, the fire crackling softly between them. Finally, Laurens spoke. \"Do you ever wonder if we're being watched? If there's something out there, beyond the stars, taking an interest in our fate?\"\n\nHamilton smiled faintly. \"I think we'd be arrogant to assume otherwise. The universe is vast and full of mysteries. Who's to say what forces are at play?\"\n\nLaurens nodded thoughtfully. \"It's a humbling thought.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Hamilton agreed. \"But whether we are watched by gods or men, our duty remains the same. We fight for freedom, for a future where our children can live without fear.\"\n\nLaurens raised his canteen in a silent toast. \"To that future.\"\n\nHamilton clinked his own canteen against Laurens'. \"To that future.\"\n\nAs the shadow of the eclipse began to recede, the camp slowly returned to its usual rhythm. The soldiers, buoyed by Washington's words and the quiet strength of their shared purpose, faced the coming days with renewed resolve. And though the whispers of unease lingered at the edges of their minds, they were tempered by the knowledge that they were not alone in their struggle.\n\nThe eclipse had brought more than just darkness; it had brought a reminder of their unity, their resilience, and the light that would always follow the shadows.",
        "story_b": "The camp was abuzz with a strange energy that morning, soldiers murmuring and casting wary glances toward the sky. The air was thick with anticipation, fear, and a sense of the unknown. They had heard tales of the eclipse, whispered warnings from the townsfolk and the grim predictions of the camp's more superstitious men. As the sun began its slow retreat behind the moon, an eerie twilight spread across the landscape, casting Washington's camp into a surreal half-light.\n\nPrivate Samuel Carter, a young soldier from Virginia, stood at the edge of the camp, his gaze fixed upwards. He felt a chill creeping up his spine, a sensation that had nothing to do with the cool breeze that tugged at his coat. To him, the eclipse seemed a celestial dance, a silent waltz of cosmic bodies, yet he could not shake the feeling that it was a harbinger of something more sinister.\n\n\"What do you make of it, Sam?\" asked Private Nathaniel Greene, sidling up beside him. Nate had a knack for humor, often lightening the mood with his jests, but today his voice held a note of genuine curiosity tinged with unease.\n\nSam sighed, his eyes never leaving the sky. \"I reckon it's just an eclipse, Nate, though I'll admit it does feel peculiar.\" He paused, his fingers unconsciously tracing the scar on his forearm\u2014a reminder of a skirmish at Brandywine. \"But I can't help but wonder if it means something more.\"\n\nNate chuckled, though it lacked his usual mirth. \"Perhaps it's a sign from the heavens that we'll finally get proper rations. Or maybe General Washington's about to sprout wings and fly us all to victory.\"\n\nSam managed a weak smile, but his thoughts drifted to the stories his grandmother used to tell. Tales of celestial events heralding great change or impending doom. He shook his head, trying to dispel the uneasy feeling that clung to him like a shadow.\n\nElsewhere in the camp, General George Washington himself stood with his trusted aide-de-camp, Alexander Hamilton, observing the phenomenon. Washington's face was stoic, but Hamilton could sense the weight of his thoughts.\n\n\"Do you think the men will see this as an ill omen, sir?\" Hamilton inquired, adjusting his spectacles as he squinted at the darkening sky.\n\nWashington remained silent for a moment, his eyes narrowing as he surveyed the camp. \"The men are on edge, that's certain. But we must remind them that the eclipse is merely a natural occurrence, not a portent.\" He paused, his voice softening. \"Though I confess, even I feel a certain unease.\"\n\nHamilton nodded, understanding the burden of leadership that Washington carried. He knew well the toll it took on the General, the sleepless nights and the constant pressure to lead a fledgling nation to victory. \"Perhaps we can use this moment to inspire them, sir. To remind them of the unity and renewal that can come from darkness.\"\n\nWashington considered this, a thoughtful expression crossing his features. \"Aye, perhaps you are right, Hamilton. Let us gather the men and address them.\"\n\nAs the eclipse reached its zenith, the camp was bathed in an otherworldly glow. A hush fell over the soldiers as Washington and Hamilton ascended a small rise, their silhouettes framed against the eerie twilight. The men gathered, their faces a tapestry of awe, fear, and curiosity.\n\n\"My fellow soldiers,\" Washington began, his voice carrying across the camp, \"we find ourselves under the shadow of a great celestial event. Some of you may see this as a sign of ill fortune, others as a divine message. But I stand before you to say that it is neither.\"\n\nHe paused, allowing his words to settle over the men. \"An eclipse is a natural occurrence, a reminder of the order and balance of the universe. It is a moment of darkness, yes, but also a moment of transition. From this darkness, we emerge renewed, united in our cause.\"\n\nHamilton stepped forward, his voice ringing with conviction. \"We fight not just for ourselves, but for the future of this nation. Let this eclipse be a symbol of our resilience, our determination to overcome any obstacle. Together, we shall emerge stronger, ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead.\"\n\nAs the sun began its slow return, a murmur of agreement rippled through the crowd. Sam felt a warmth spreading through him, a spark of hope igniting in his chest. Perhaps the eclipse was more than just a celestial dance\u2014it was a reminder that even in the darkest times, there was light to be found.\n\nNate clapped him on the back, grinning widely. \"See, Sam? Not so bad after all. Maybe next time we'll get a rainbow.\"\n\nSam laughed, feeling the tension that had gripped him begin to ease. \"Aye, perhaps we will, Nate. Perhaps we will.\"\n\nAs the camp returned to its routine, the soldiers' spirits lifted, buoyed by the sense of unity and purpose that Washington and Hamilton had instilled. The eclipse, once a source of fear and uncertainty, had become a catalyst for hope and camaraderie.\n\nLater that evening, as the camp settled into the quiet of the night, Sam found himself reflecting on the day's events. He thought of the battles they had fought, the hardships they had endured, and the friendships that had formed in the crucible of war. He realized that, like the eclipse, their journey was one of transformation\u2014a passage through darkness that would ultimately lead to light.\n\nAs he drifted off to sleep, Sam felt a sense of peace wash over him. The eclipse had come and gone, leaving in its wake a renewed sense of purpose and a reminder that, no matter the challenges they faced, they were not alone. Together, they would forge ahead, united in their quest for freedom and a brighter future.",

        "ground_truth": "Summer had taken full possession of the Eastern Coast. Washington\u2019s troops were buzzing about the camp, readying for a campaign at Monmouth Courthouse that was to commence four days hence. But that was not the only event that was bringing about both excitement and fear among the men; on the 24th of June, there was to be a solar eclipse that had been reported in newspapers at the beginning of January.\nNothing in Washington\u2019s inner circle had changed despite the solar event. Battle plans were still being drawn up, the office was busy with more correspondence being written, orders were being directed by the Commander-in-Chief of the army. The aides-de-camp were not so busy as that they scarcely discussed topics that were not related to the upcoming battle at dinner. Except for tonight, when they had a reprieve long enough to talk about something else.\n\u201cDid you see the newspaper today? There\u2019s to be a solar eclipse the day after tomorrow.\u201d John said between the bits of his meager stew of salted beef and potatoes.\n\u201cSome of the soldiers are calling it a bad omen it being so close to the upcoming battle.\u201d Alexander sighed and rolled his eyes.\nLafayette shrugged, \u201cI see it as a good omen. The brightness of the Revolution, the periods of darkness where we\u2019ve lost battles, and the sun re-appearing means our cause will shine brightly again with won battles.\u201d\n\u2018You are very optimistic,\nMon Ami\n.\u201d Laurens said with a quirked smile.\n\u201cThough I will admit that I have not ever seen a solar eclipse before in my life. It will be interesting to observe it given the chance.\u201d \u00a0Meade returned.\n\u201cNor I. Let\u2019s just hope we\u2019re not overwhelmed with paperwork.\u201d Hamilton added dryly.\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not going to be hard to miss, really.\u201d Laurens laughed.\nAs the group continued to discuss the upcoming solar eclipse and its possible implications, the conversation in the room shifted again towards the coming battle at Monmouth.\nAlexander would be glad of the distraction of this celestial event to calm his nerves about the fight. There was something in the air that made him uneasy. He felt something was going to go wrong.\n*~*\nThe hours before the eclipse was just as busy as usual. Washington\u2019s aides-de-camp were kept busy with their work, all the while tilting their heads out the window to keep an eye on the sky or their pocket watches.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a few minutes break would go amiss.\u201d Hamilton remarked, putting down his quill and capping his ink.\nLafayette grinned, \u201cYou read my mind, mon ami!\u201d\nThe others chuckled while putting away their writing utensils and pushed back their chairs. Each of them stretched, grateful for the exercise after so many hours seated. They all stepped outside onto the small patch of dirt generously called a lawn and stared up, with their hands over their foreheads to shield them from sunlight.\nMeade pulled out his pocket watch and glanced at it. \u201cIt should be starting any time now. The newspaper said the eclipse should begin at 3:19 pm.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t look as though it has changed.\u201d Alexander remarked squinting up at the sun.\n\u201cAlex, don\u2019t look directly at the sun, you idiot!\u201d Laurens snapped.\nHamilton closed his eyes sharply then winced. He slowly opened them, squinting and shielding them with his hand. He stayed still for a few moments, adjusting to the brightness.\nFinally, at 3:30, as the sky began to dim, the soldiers began to gasp. Lafayette and Laurens leaped up from the stairs.\n\"It's beginning!\" Lafayette shouted, standing on his tiptoes as if trying to catch a glimpse of the sky. \"Look at that!\" Lafayette exclaimed, pointing up at the darkening sky.\nThe Moon slowly began to creep in front of the sun, the group watched in awe as the sky grew darker and a strange twilight settled over the land.\nSlowly, the sun became more and more obscured, the crescent becoming smaller and smaller as the smaller body of the Moon overtook it. \u00a0A sense of anticipation filled the air. Meade felt a shiver run down his spine, a mixture of excitement and wonder at the celestial event unfolding before their eyes.\nThe whole camp seemed to hold its breath as the moon completely covered the sun, casting a shadow over their little part of the world. The temperature dropped, and a hush fell over the group as they experienced the breathtaking beauty of the total solar eclipse.\n\u201c\nC\u2019est Incroyable\n!\u201d Lafayette whispered in awe. \"Mon Dieu! But it\u2019s like dawn!\u201d\n\u201cLook at that bright light at the right corner.\u201d Alexander remarked, \u201cI wonder if that is the sun re-appearing.\u201d He turned, tilting his head while his eyebrows furrowed. \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d He pointed his finger upwards. \u201cThere are no birds chirping now. I think they are just as discombobulated!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a sight isn\u2019t it, gentlemen?\u201d A deep voice from behind them called, making them all whirl around to see the General striding towards them. The group all saluted, looking as though they were ready to take a reprimand.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Excellency,\u201d Hamilton started, \u201cWe did not mean to abandon our duties during such a critical period before a battle-\u201d\nWashington raised his hand. \"No worries. I wouldn't want to miss out on witnessing such a rare celestial phenomenon; one that we might never get to see again.\" He gazed up at the solar eclipse. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a sight to see, no?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think that ring around the sun is, sir?\u201d Alexander wondered.\n\u201cPerhaps,\" Washington replied, raising his chin up to the eclipse, \"it\u2019s the atmosphere of the moon, or that of the sun.\u201d Washington commented.\n\u201cWell, whatever it is, it sure is a beautiful sight,\u201d Laurens added.\n\u201cIt looks like light surrounding a void,\u201d remarked Lafayette with wonder in his voice.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not eerie or anything, Lafayette,\u201d scoffed Meade.\nA few moments later, the moon began to move away from the sun, beginning to chase away the shadows. The ring of light around the sun grew brighter as the moon slowly moved out of its path. The sky gradually began to lighten.\n\u201cSunrise again.\u201d Laughed Alexander, his breath catching as it indeed felt as though dawn was breaking for a second time that day. It wasn\u2019t long before afternoon sunshine returned to the sky. The soldiers murmured but went back to their duties.\nThe group stood in awe as the eclipse passed.\u00a0\u00a0Washington turned to his companions with a smile. \"Well, gentlemen, it seems we have witnessed to something truly extraordinary today. Now, shall we get back to work?\u201d",
        "story_a": "The sky above Washington's camp darkened like ink spilled across parchment, the rare solar eclipse casting an eerie twilight over the soldiers. The air grew thick with tension, a palpable sense of foreboding that settled in their bones. Whispers skittered through the ranks like mice in the walls, each man interpreting the celestial event in his own way. Some saw it as a divine omen, a sign that Providence was with them, while others feared it as a harbinger of doom.\n\nAlexander Hamilton stood at the edge of the camp, his sharp eyes fixed on the sliver of sun still visible through the encroaching shadow. He was not a man given to superstition, but even he could not deny the strangeness of the moment. The usual clamor of the camp had quieted to a murmur, the soldiers\u2019 nervous energy vibrating in the air.\n\n\"Alexander,\" a familiar voice called, cutting through his reverie. He turned to see John Laurens approaching, his brow furrowed with concern. \"Have you heard the rumors?\"\n\nHamilton sighed, running a hand through his hair. \"Which ones? There are so many.\"\n\nLaurens glanced around, ensuring they were out of earshot. \"Some of the men are saying this eclipse is a sign. A warning from God, perhaps. They think it foretells disaster.\"\n\nHamilton raised an eyebrow. \"And what do you think, John? Do you believe the heavens have taken an interest in our little rebellion?\"\n\nLaurens chuckled softly, though his eyes remained serious. \"I don't know what to believe. But I do know that fear can be a dangerous thing in a camp like this. It can spread like wildfire.\"\n\nHamilton nodded, his mind already racing with possibilities. \"We need to address this before it undermines morale. A few well-placed words from General Washington might help.\"\n\nAs if summoned by the mention of his name, General George Washington strode into view, his presence commanding even in the dimming light. Hamilton and Laurens exchanged a glance before approaching their commander.\n\n\"General,\" Hamilton began, \"there are whispers spreading through the camp. The men are unsettled by the eclipse.\"\n\nWashington's expression remained impassive, but his eyes betrayed a flicker of concern. \"What are they saying?\"\n\n\"That it is a sign,\" Laurens replied. \"A warning of impending doom.\"\n\nWashington considered this for a moment, his gaze shifting to the darkening sky. \"Fear is a powerful enemy,\" he said finally. \"We must quash these rumors before they take root.\"\n\nHamilton nodded. \"What do you suggest, sir?\"\n\nWashington's eyes hardened with determination. \"Gather the men. I will address them directly.\"\n\nThe camp bustled as word spread that the General would speak. Soldiers gathered, their faces a mix of apprehension and curiosity. Hamilton and Laurens stood to the side, watching as Washington took his place before the assembled troops.\n\n\"Men,\" Washington began, his voice steady and strong, \"I know that this eclipse has caused unease among you. It is a rare and wondrous event, and such things often stir our deepest fears and hopes. But let me assure you, this is no omen of disaster. It is merely a natural occurrence, a reminder of the vastness of the universe and our small place within it.\"\n\nHe paused, allowing his words to sink in. \"We fight for a cause greater than ourselves, for the freedom and future of our young nation. Do not let fear cloud your resolve. Let this eclipse be a symbol of the challenges we face and the strength we must find within ourselves to overcome them.\"\n\nThe soldiers murmured amongst themselves, the tension in the air beginning to dissipate. Hamilton watched as the General's words took hold, the men standing a little taller, their expressions a little more resolute.\n\nAs Washington stepped down, Hamilton approached him. \"That was well said, sir.\"\n\nWashington nodded. \"Let us hope it is enough.\"\n\nThe eerie twilight of the eclipse continued to cast its shadow, but the camp seemed lighter, the whispers of doom fading into the background. Hamilton felt a sense of relief, though he knew the real battle was far from over.\n\nThat evening, as the camp settled into an uneasy quiet, Hamilton found himself alone by the fire, his thoughts drifting back to the events of the day. The eclipse, with all its strange beauty and unsettling power, had reminded him of the precariousness of their cause. But it had also reminded him of the strength that lay in unity, in the unwavering belief in something greater than themselves.\n\n\"Alexander,\" Laurens' voice broke through his reverie once more. \"Mind if I join you?\"\n\nHamilton gestured to the empty space beside him. \"Not at all.\"\n\nThey sat in companionable silence for a while, the fire crackling softly between them. Finally, Laurens spoke. \"Do you ever wonder if we're being watched? If there's something out there, beyond the stars, taking an interest in our fate?\"\n\nHamilton smiled faintly. \"I think we'd be arrogant to assume otherwise. The universe is vast and full of mysteries. Who's to say what forces are at play?\"\n\nLaurens nodded thoughtfully. \"It's a humbling thought.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Hamilton agreed. \"But whether we are watched by gods or men, our duty remains the same. We fight for freedom, for a future where our children can live without fear.\"\n\nLaurens raised his canteen in a silent toast. \"To that future.\"\n\nHamilton clinked his own canteen against Laurens'. \"To that future.\"\n\nAs the shadow of the eclipse began to recede, the camp slowly returned to its usual rhythm. The soldiers, buoyed by Washington's words and the quiet strength of their shared purpose, faced the coming days with renewed resolve. And though the whispers of unease lingered at the edges of their minds, they were tempered by the knowledge that they were not alone in their struggle.\n\nThe eclipse had brought more than just darkness; it had brought a reminder of their unity, their resilience, and the light that would always follow the shadows.",
        "story_b": "The sun was a dim shadow in the sky, casting the camp in an eerie twilight that seemed to blur the line between day and night. The soldiers, usually boisterous and lively, gathered in clusters, their faces illuminated by the strange half-light. They whispered among themselves, eyes darting upward to the celestial spectacle unfolding above. \n\n\"Is this a sign from the heavens, or a warning of what's to come?\" muttered Private Harris, a young soldier with a mop of unruly hair and a penchant for old tales. His voice trembled slightly, betraying the fear that crept into his heart. \n\nSergeant O\u2019Malley, standing nearby, crossed his arms and shook his head, an attempt to mask his own unease. \"I've heard stories from my grandmother,\" he said, his brogue thickening with the weight of memory. \"Eclipses were seen as omens. They say they herald great change\u2014sometimes for better, sometimes for worse.\"\n\nPrivate Thompson, ever the joker, tried to lighten the mood. \"Well, if the sun's taking a break, maybe we should too!\" he quipped, earning a few chuckles from the group. Yet, beneath the laughter, the tension was palpable, like the taut string of a bow ready to snap.\n\nGeneral Washington, sensing the growing anxiety, decided to address the camp. He moved through the crowd with his characteristic calm, his presence a steady anchor amidst the swirling uncertainty. As he mounted a small rise to speak, the soldiers gathered around, their eyes wide with awe and trepidation.\n\n\"Men,\" Washington began, his voice carrying authority and reassurance. \"I understand the fears that this eclipse may stir within you. Such events have long been cloaked in mystery, shrouded in superstition. Yet, let us not forget that we face greater challenges daily, challenges that demand our unity and resolve.\"\n\nThe camp fell silent, save for the whispering wind that rustled the leaves. Washington's words hung in the air, a beacon of hope against the encroaching darkness.\n\n\"Remember,\" he continued, \"we are not alone in this fight. We stand together, as brothers, against whatever trials come our way. Let this eclipse be a reminder of our resilience, our ability to find light even in the darkest times.\"\n\nAs he spoke, a sudden gust of wind swept through the camp, sending shivers down spines and scattering fallen leaves. It was as if the eclipse itself was responding to Washington's call for courage, a tangible reminder of the change that lay ahead.\n\nIn the crowd, two soldiers\u2014Henry and Samuel\u2014stood side by side, their gazes fixed on the sky. They had fought together in battles past, their bond forged in the crucible of war.\n\n\"Do you remember that storm at Valley Forge?\" Henry asked, his voice barely above a whisper. \"We thought it was the end of us.\"\n\nSamuel nodded, a wry smile tugging at his lips. \"Aye, and yet here we are, still standing. This eclipse is nothing compared to what we've faced.\"\n\nTheir conversation, though quiet, was a balm to their frayed nerves. The eclipse became a backdrop to their reflections on courage and fear, a metaphor for their internal journey. \n\nAs the minutes ticked by, the sky transformed into a canvas of swirling darkness and light, the moon slowly reclaiming the sun. The eerie glow bathed the camp in an otherworldly hue, shadows stretching like fingers across the ground.\n\nWashington, having finished his speech, walked through the camp, offering words of encouragement to those he passed. His leadership style was one of compassion and steady presence, a guiding light for his men.\n\n\"Stay strong,\" he said to a young soldier who looked particularly pale. \"This too shall pass.\"\n\nThe soldier nodded, bolstered by Washington's confidence. \"Thank you, sir.\"\n\nElsewhere in the camp, the soldiers' camaraderie shone through their shared fears. A group gathered around a makeshift fire, sharing stories and laughter to ward off the chill of uncertainty.\n\n\"If this is the end, at least we're in good company,\" one soldier joked, earning a round of laughter that echoed into the twilight.\n\nDespite the tension, there was a sense of introspection that pervaded the camp. The eclipse, with its fleeting darkness, prompted many to reflect on their past battles and personal growth. It was a reminder of the changes they had undergone, both as individuals and as a unit.\n\nIn the midst of this introspection, Private Harris found himself contemplating the tales his grandmother had told him. He realized that while eclipses had been seen as omens of change, they were not inherently good or bad. Rather, it was how one responded to the change that truly mattered.\n\nWith this newfound understanding, Harris turned to his comrades, his voice steady and resolute. \"Let's make sure whatever change this brings, we're ready for it.\"\n\nThe soldiers nodded in agreement, their spirits lifted by the shared resolve. The eclipse, once a source of unease, had become a catalyst for unity and strength.\n\nAs the moon continued its journey across the sun, the camp gradually returned to its usual rhythm. The soldiers, their fears quelled by Washington's words and their own reflections, prepared for the challenges that lay ahead with renewed determination.\n\nBy the time the eclipse passed and the sun's full light returned, the camp was alive with a sense of purpose. The soldiers, their hearts buoyed by their shared experience, knew that they could face whatever came their way. The eclipse had not brought doom, but rather a reminder of their resilience and the bonds that tied them together.\n\nAnd so, under the brightening sky, Washington's men carried on, their spirits as unyielding as the sun that once more shone upon them.",

I wouldn't want to miss out on witnessing such a rare celestial phenomenon; one that we might never get to see again.\" He gazed up at the solar eclipse. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a sight to see, no?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think that ring around the sun is, sir?\u201d Alexander wondered.\n\u201cPerhaps,\" Washington replied, raising his chin up to the eclipse, \"it\u2019s the atmosphere of the moon, or that of the sun.\u201d Washington commented.\n\u201cWell, whatever it is, it sure is a beautiful sight,\u201d Laurens added.\n\u201cIt looks like light surrounding a void,\u201d remarked Lafayette with wonder in his voice.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not eerie or anything, Lafayette,\u201d scoffed Meade.\nA few moments later, the moon began to move away from the sun, beginning to chase away the shadows. The ring of light around the sun grew brighter as the moon slowly moved out of its path. The sky gradually began to lighten.\n\u201cSunrise again.\u201d Laughed Alexander, his breath catching as it indeed felt as though dawn was breaking for a second time that day. It wasn\u2019t long before afternoon sunshine returned to the sky. The soldiers murmured but went back to their duties.\nThe group stood in awe as the eclipse passed.\u00a0\u00a0Washington turned to his companions with a smile. \"Well, gentlemen, it seems we have witnessed to something truly extraordinary today. Now, shall we get back to work?\u201d",
        "story_a": "The sky above Washington's camp darkened like ink spilled across parchment, the rare solar eclipse casting an eerie twilight over the soldiers. The air grew thick with tension, a palpable sense of foreboding that settled in their bones. Whispers skittered through the ranks like mice in the walls, each man interpreting the celestial event in his own way. Some saw it as a divine omen, a sign that Providence was with them, while others feared it as a harbinger of doom.\n\nAlexander Hamilton stood at the edge of the camp, his sharp eyes fixed on the sliver of sun still visible through the encroaching shadow. He was not a man given to superstition, but even he could not deny the strangeness of the moment. The usual clamor of the camp had quieted to a murmur, the soldiers\u2019 nervous energy vibrating in the air.\n\n\"Alexander,\" a familiar voice called, cutting through his reverie. He turned to see John Laurens approaching, his brow furrowed with concern. \"Have you heard the rumors?\"\n\nHamilton sighed, running a hand through his hair. \"Which ones? There are so many.\"\n\nLaurens glanced around, ensuring they were out of earshot. \"Some of the men are saying this eclipse is a sign. A warning from God, perhaps. They think it foretells disaster.\"\n\nHamilton raised an eyebrow. \"And what do you think, John? Do you believe the heavens have taken an interest in our little rebellion?\"\n\nLaurens chuckled softly, though his eyes remained serious. \"I don't know what to believe. But I do know that fear can be a dangerous thing in a camp like this. It can spread like wildfire.\"\n\nHamilton nodded, his mind already racing with possibilities. \"We need to address this before it undermines morale. A few well-placed words from General Washington might help.\"\n\nAs if summoned by the mention of his name, General George Washington strode into view, his presence commanding even in the dimming light. Hamilton and Laurens exchanged a glance before approaching their commander.\n\n\"General,\" Hamilton began, \"there are whispers spreading through the camp. The men are unsettled by the eclipse.\"\n\nWashington's expression remained impassive, but his eyes betrayed a flicker of concern. \"What are they saying?\"\n\n\"That it is a sign,\" Laurens replied. \"A warning of impending doom.\"\n\nWashington considered this for a moment, his gaze shifting to the darkening sky. \"Fear is a powerful enemy,\" he said finally. \"We must quash these rumors before they take root.\"\n\nHamilton nodded. \"What do you suggest, sir?\"\n\nWashington's eyes hardened with determination. \"Gather the men. I will address them directly.\"\n\nThe camp bustled as word spread that the General would speak. Soldiers gathered, their faces a mix of apprehension and curiosity. Hamilton and Laurens stood to the side, watching as Washington took his place before the assembled troops.\n\n\"Men,\" Washington began, his voice steady and strong, \"I know that this eclipse has caused unease among you. It is a rare and wondrous event, and such things often stir our deepest fears and hopes. But let me assure you, this is no omen of disaster. It is merely a natural occurrence, a reminder of the vastness of the universe and our small place within it.\"\n\nHe paused, allowing his words to sink in. \"We fight for a cause greater than ourselves, for the freedom and future of our young nation. Do not let fear cloud your resolve. Let this eclipse be a symbol of the challenges we face and the strength we must find within ourselves to overcome them.\"\n\nThe soldiers murmured amongst themselves, the tension in the air beginning to dissipate. Hamilton watched as the General's words took hold, the men standing a little taller, their expressions a little more resolute.\n\nAs Washington stepped down, Hamilton approached him. \"That was well said, sir.\"\n\nWashington nodded. \"Let us hope it is enough.\"\n\nThe eerie twilight of the eclipse continued to cast its shadow, but the camp seemed lighter, the whispers of doom fading into the background. Hamilton felt a sense of relief, though he knew the real battle was far from over.\n\nThat evening, as the camp settled into an uneasy quiet, Hamilton found himself alone by the fire, his thoughts drifting back to the events of the day. The eclipse, with all its strange beauty and unsettling power, had reminded him of the precariousness of their cause. But it had also reminded him of the strength that lay in unity, in the unwavering belief in something greater than themselves.\n\n\"Alexander,\" Laurens' voice broke through his reverie once more. \"Mind if I join you?\"\n\nHamilton gestured to the empty space beside him. \"Not at all.\"\n\nThey sat in companionable silence for a while, the fire crackling softly between them. Finally, Laurens spoke. \"Do you ever wonder if we're being watched? If there's something out there, beyond the stars, taking an interest in our fate?\"\n\nHamilton smiled faintly. \"I think we'd be arrogant to assume otherwise. The universe is vast and full of mysteries. Who's to say what forces are at play?\"\n\nLaurens nodded thoughtfully. \"It's a humbling thought.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Hamilton agreed. \"But whether we are watched by gods or men, our duty remains the same. We fight for freedom, for a future where our children can live without fear.\"\n\nLaurens raised his canteen in a silent toast. \"To that future.\"\n\nHamilton clinked his own canteen against Laurens'. \"To that future.\"\n\nAs the shadow of the eclipse began to recede, the camp slowly returned to its usual rhythm. The soldiers, buoyed by Washington's words and the quiet strength of their shared purpose, faced the coming days with renewed resolve. And though the whispers of unease lingered at the edges of their minds, they were tempered by the knowledge that they were not alone in their struggle.\n\nThe eclipse had brought more than just darkness; it had brought a reminder of their unity, their resilience, and the light that would always follow the shadows.",
        "story_b": "The sun's light waned as the moon began its slow dance across the sky, casting an otherworldly shadow over Washington's camp. The soldiers paused in their duties, eyes drawn upward to the celestial drama unfolding above them. The air thrummed with an unspoken tension, a mixture of awe and apprehension. The day, once bright and clear, was now cloaked in a shroud of creeping twilight, the light dimming as if the heavens themselves were holding their breath.\n\nThe camp, usually bustling with the sounds of clattering pots and the distant laughter of camaraderie, fell into a hushed silence. Horses stamped nervously, their breath misting in the cool, thickening air. Birds ceased their songs, leaving an eerie quiet that only served to amplify the soldiers' unease.\n\nCorporal Samuel Haines, a veteran of many battles, stood with his arms crossed, squinting at the sky. \"Ain't natural,\" he muttered to his companion, Private Josiah Carter, who stood beside him, eyes wide with a mixture of fear and wonder. \"The sun don't just disappear like that.\"\n\nJosiah nodded, swallowing hard. \"Reckon it means something, Sam? Some say it's a sign from the Almighty, a message to us down here.\"\n\nSamuel grunted, shifting his weight. \"Could be. Or it could be something else. I've heard tales of such things. Some say it's a warning, others... well, they say it's a curse.\"\n\nNearby, a group of younger soldiers gathered, their whispered voices carrying in the stillness. They argued quietly, each one trying to impose his interpretation of the event. A tall, lanky soldier named Peter insisted, \"It's a sign of victory! The Lord's telling us we'll win this war.\"\n\nAnother, a stout lad with fiery hair named Thomas, shook his head vehemently. \"No, it's a bad omen. My grandmother used to say an eclipse brings death and misfortune.\"\n\nThe debate grew more heated as the shadows deepened, the camp now bathed in an eerie twilight that seemed to blur the line between day and night. The soldiers' faces were painted in shades of gray, their eyes reflecting the growing uncertainty.\n\nIn the midst of this celestial spectacle, Captain William Morris stepped into the circle of arguing men, his presence commanding an immediate silence. A respected leader, Morris was known for his steady hand and calming influence.\n\n\"Enough,\" he said firmly, his voice cutting through the tension like a blade. \"We cannot afford to let superstition cloud our judgment. Whatever this eclipse means, we must remain vigilant.\"\n\nSamuel nodded in agreement, his eyes scanning the horizon. \"Aye, Captain. We've got enough to worry about without chasing shadows.\"\n\nAs the moon continued its slow crawl across the sun, a strange sound echoed through the camp\u2014a low, mournful wail that sent shivers down the spines of even the bravest men. It was as if the earth itself was keening in response to the celestial event. The soldiers exchanged uneasy glances, their earlier bravado faltering in the face of this new mystery.\n\nJosiah clutched his musket tighter, his knuckles white with tension. \"What in God's name is that?\"\n\nCaptain Morris turned his gaze toward the sound, his brow furrowing. \"I don't know, but we need to find out.\"\n\nGathering a small group of men, Morris led them toward the source of the haunting wail. The air seemed to grow colder as they moved, the eerie twilight casting long shadows that danced and flickered in the corners of their vision.\n\nAs they approached the edge of the camp, they stumbled upon a sight that none of them could have anticipated. There, standing in the shadow of the trees, was an unexpected visitor\u2014a Native American man, his face painted in striking patterns, his eyes reflecting the same twilight that enveloped the camp.\n\nThe soldiers halted, their initial fear giving way to curiosity. The man stood calmly, his posture serene despite the tension that crackled in the air. Captain Morris stepped forward, meeting the stranger's gaze with cautious respect.\n\n\"Who are you, and why have you come?\" Morris asked, his voice steady but laced with curiosity.\n\nThe man regarded him silently for a moment before speaking, his voice low and melodic. \"I am called Tahoma. The eclipse has brought me here, as it is a time of great change. I come with no harm, only with words.\"\n\nThe soldiers exchanged glances, their earlier fear replaced by intrigue. Morris nodded, urging the man to continue.\n\n\"In my people\u2019s beliefs,\" Tahoma began, \"an eclipse is a time of transformation, a moment when the world holds its breath, waiting to see what will be. It is neither good nor evil, but a reminder of the balance that exists in all things.\"\n\nSamuel, still wary, crossed his arms. \"And what does this balance mean for us?\"\n\nTahoma looked up at the sky, where the sun was beginning to reemerge from behind the moon's shadow. \"It means that what you see as a curse or a blessing is but a part of a greater cycle. You must find your own path through the darkness and into the light.\"\n\nAs the eclipse passed and the sun's light returned to the world, the soldiers found themselves pondering Tahoma's words. The tension that had gripped the camp slowly began to dissipate, replaced by a renewed sense of purpose and understanding.\n\nCaptain Morris, ever the leader, addressed his men once more. \"We have faced many challenges, but we must not let fear dictate our actions. Let this day remind us of our strength and our unity.\"\n\nThe soldiers nodded, their spirits lifted by both Tahoma's wisdom and their captain's unwavering resolve. As the camp returned to its usual rhythm, the memory of the eclipse lingered in their minds\u2014a reminder of the mysteries that lay beyond their understanding and the courage required to face them.\n\nAnd so, beneath the light of a sun restored, Washington's camp continued its march toward the unknown future, guided by the knowledge that even in the darkest of times, there was always a glimmer of hope waiting to be found.",

        "ground_truth": "Israel Rostov was a high school dropout who worked as a fur-cart pusher in the State and Lake Building. Roy was eight years old when he first saw him. On Saturdays Roy often accompanied his grandfather, Jack Colby, whom he called Pops, to the furriers\u2019 office there that Pops shared with his brothers, Ike and Nate. Their brother Louie, who was the president of the Chicago Furriers Association, which he had founded, kept his office on the sixth floor of the building. The Colby brothers\u2019 office was on the eighth floor.\n\nRoy would sit on a high stool and cut up pelts with a stiletto-like knife Pops had taught him to use, while his grandfather and great-uncles sat around a marble-topped table and played cards. When Louie joined them, the game was bridge; otherwise, they played three-handed gin rummy.\n\nIzzy Rostov delivered furs on carts from floor to floor. He was a short kid with thick, curly black hair and bushy eyebrows, small dark-brown eyes, and a huge hook nose that seemed to be trying to escape from his face. Rostov\u2019s thick red lips curved upward at the corners so that it looked as if he were always smiling, except that his smile more resembled a sneer. He perpetually had a burning, unfiltered Lucky Strike dripping from his mouth. Roy was fascinated by Izzy\u2019s ability to talk while never removing the cigarette from his lips, as if the butt end were glued between them.\n\nRostov called Roy \u201cmy little pal\u201d and stopped his cart to talk to him whenever he encountered Roy in the hallways or in the freight elevator. This usually occurred when Roy was going between the sixth and eighth floors to visit with his Uncle Louie. The delivery boy always had a future plan for himself that he told Roy about. Most of the time it had to do with his moving to Miami Beach to hang out in the luxury hotels so that he could \u201chook up with rich, lazy broads.\u201d\n\nOne afternoon, Rostov told Roy he had something special to show him but he couldn\u2019t do it in the hallway. Roy followed Izzy into the men\u2019s room on the eighth floor. After making sure that nobody else was in the bathroom, Rostov removed from one of his coat pockets a small black handgun and held it out for Roy to look at.\n\n\u201cThis is a .38-caliber snub-nosed revolver,\u201d Rostov said. \u201cA very accurate piece of hardware. I bought it from a spook on Maxwell Street.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with it?\u201d asked Roy.\n\n\u201cStick up a few gas stations, what else? I gotta get a stake together before I travel, buy some slick clothes to impress the broads, you know. I can\u2019t make it on the peanuts these penny-pinchin\u2019 Hebes pay me around here.\u201d\n\nIzzy Rostov tapped the tip of his prodigious nose with the barrel of his revolver and said, \u201cI might even have enough dough to get my beak fixed.\u201d\n\nThen he laughed and put the gun back into his coat pocket. The ash from Rostov\u2019s cigarette dangled dangerously, and Roy was certain it would fall off, but it didn\u2019t. Roy moved farther away from him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be frightened, little pal,\u201d said Izzy. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna shoot anyone. The piece is just to throw a scare into \u2019em, let the suckers know Israel Rostov means business. I could change my name too, once I get down south. How does Guy DeMarco sound? Smooth, huh? The broads\u2019ll go for a name like that. Guy DeMarco.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think gas stations keep a lot of cash around?\u201d Roy asked.\n\n\u201cDepends,\u201d said Rostov. \u201cBut I got bigger ideas.\u201d\n\nRostov came close to Roy, mussed up his hair, and then walked out of the men\u2019s room. Roy waited for a minute before returning to his grandfather\u2019s office. Jack, Ike, and Nate were playing gin.\n\n\u201cHey, babe,\u201d said Pops, \u201cI thought you were going to see your Uncle Louie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI decided not to. I just went to the washroom.\u201d\n\nRoy went over to his stool, climbed on, and resumed cutting up pelts.\n\nThe next time Roy ran into Izzy Rostov, the delivery boy winked at him but did not stop to talk. His cart was loaded with mink and fox stoles.\n\n\u201cGotta get these on a truck goin\u2019 to the Merchandise Mart,\u201d Izzy said, and pushed on toward the freight elevator.\n\nA couple of Saturdays after that, all four of the brothers were playing bridge, when Louie said, \u201cYou hear the Rostov boy got killed?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe delivery cart kid?\u201d asked Ike.\n\n\u201cYes. Apparently he tried to rob a liquor store on Huron the other night and the clerk shot him in the back before he could get away.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know about his parents?\u201d asked Nate.\n\n\u201cWhat about them?\u201d Jack asked.\n\n\u201cThey were survivors of Auschwitz.\u201d\n\n\u201cHorrible,\u201d said Ike. \u201cImagine how they must feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Auschwitz?\u201d asked Roy.\n\nThe men were silent for a few moments before Nate spoke.\n\n\u201cIt was a concentration camp, a prison death camp during the war where the Germans murdered Jews.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey also murdered Gypsies and communists,\u201d said Ike, \u201cbut mostly Jews.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Rostov\u2019s parents are still alive,\u201d Roy said.\n\n\u201cSome prisoners were rescued by the Allies before the Nazis could kill them,\u201d said Louie.\n\n\u201cHow many people did they kill?\u201d asked Roy.\n\n\u201cToo many to count,\u201d said his grandfather. \u201cThe accepted figure is six million.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore,\u201d said Louie. \u201cThey murdered more.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo think that the parents escaped the Holocaust,\u201d Nate said. \u201cThey come to America and their child is shot down in the street like a wild animal.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had a gun,\u201d Roy said. \u201cHe showed it to me.\u201d\n\nThe men all looked at Roy.\n\n\u201cIt was a snub-nosed .38,\u201d he said. \u201cIzzy told me he was going to stick up a gas station and move to Miami Beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of home life could the boy have had?\u201d said Nate.\n\nRoy looked out a window onto State Street. The Chicago Theatre was showing Alan Ladd in The Badlanders. Clumps of brown dirt the size of pigeons were blowing through the gray air.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s play cards,\u201d said Ike.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The summer I turned eleven, our small town felt like it was holding its breath. Dust settled thick on the streets, the heat shimmering off the blacktop like a mirage. That was the summer I met Eddie.\n\nEddie was the new delivery worker for the local grocery store, a lanky guy in his mid-twenties with a mop of unruly hair and a smile that could charm the stripes off a zebra. He drove an ancient, battered pickup that rattled down the street like it was barely holding together, and he always had a cigarette dangling from his lips, the smoke curling up into the sky like a question mark.\n\nHe\u2019d show up at our house every Thursday, hauling bags of groceries to the front porch while my mother fussed over the order. I\u2019d sit on the steps, watching him with a mix of curiosity and envy. He moved with a sort of reckless energy, like he was always on the brink of something exciting.\n\n\u201cHey, kid,\u201d he said to me one afternoon, wiping the sweat off his brow. \u201cYou ever ride in a truck like this?\u201d\n\nI shook my head, my eyes wide. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, a sound like gravel rolling down a hill. \u201cSir? Man, you make me feel old. Name\u2019s Eddie. Wanna come see something cool?\u201d\n\nMy mother would\u2019ve had a fit if she knew, but something about Eddie made me trust him. I hopped off the steps and followed him to the truck. He opened the door with a creak and gestured for me to climb in. The seat was cracked and worn, the dashboard littered with old receipts and empty soda cans. But to me, it was a treasure trove.\n\n\u201cCheck this out,\u201d Eddie said, reaching into the glove compartment. He pulled out a small, leather-bound notebook and handed it to me. \u201cThese are my plans. Gonna open my own shop someday. Get outta this town, you know?\u201d\n\nI flipped through the pages, filled with sketches and notes. It was like looking into a secret world, one where Eddie was more than just a delivery worker. He was a dreamer, a builder, an architect of his own future.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really cool,\u201d I said, handing it back to him.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his eyes distant. \u201cJust gotta save up enough cash. Won\u2019t be long now.\u201d\n\nFrom that day on, I looked forward to Thursdays. Eddie would tell me stories about his dreams, about the places he wanted to go and the things he wanted to do. He had a way of making the world seem bigger, more full of possibilities. He talked about opening a bike shop, then a caf\u00e9, then a music store. His dreams were as wild and shifting as the clouds in the summer sky.\n\nBut there was an edge to him, too. Sometimes, I\u2019d catch a glimpse of it in the way he clenched his jaw or stared off into the distance. It was like he was running from something, and no matter how fast he went, it was always right behind him.\n\nOne Thursday, Eddie didn\u2019t show up. I waited on the steps all afternoon, my heart sinking with every passing minute. My mother said he probably just had the day off, but I could tell she was worried, too. The next week, another delivery worker came, a grizzled old man who didn\u2019t say much.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to Eddie?\u201d I asked, my voice trembling.\n\nThe man looked at me with sad eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear, kid? Eddie got into some trouble. Car crash. Didn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nThe words hit me like a punch to the gut. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Eddie, with his big dreams and easy smile, gone just like that. It didn\u2019t seem fair. It didn\u2019t seem real.\n\nIn the days that followed, I learned more about Eddie\u2019s life than I ever had while he was alive. He\u2019d grown up in a rough part of town, raised by a single mother who worked three jobs to make ends meet. He\u2019d dropped out of high school to help support his family, taking on whatever work he could find. The dreams he shared with me were more than just fantasies; they were his way out, his hope for something better.\n\nAs I pieced together his story, I began to understand the weight he carried. Eddie had lived a hard life, one filled with struggle and sacrifice. But he\u2019d never let it crush his spirit. He\u2019d held onto his dreams with a tenacity that both inspired and haunted me.\n\nI spent a lot of time that summer sitting on the front steps, thinking about Eddie. His death left me with a gnawing sense of loss, but also a burning question: Why do some people get trapped by their circumstances while others manage to break free? Was it fate, family, luck, or something else entirely?\n\nOne afternoon, I found myself flipping through an old book my father had left behind. It was filled with stories of heroes and adventurers, people who faced insurmountable odds and came out the other side stronger. Eddie had been like one of those heroes to me, but his story had ended too soon.\n\nI realized then that Eddie\u2019s dreams didn\u2019t have to die with him. They could live on in the people he\u2019d touched, in the lessons he\u2019d taught me. He\u2019d shown me that no matter how tough life gets, you can always dream, always strive for something better.\n\nAs the summer faded into fall, I made a promise to myself. I\u2019d keep Eddie\u2019s dreams alive by chasing my own, by never letting the weight of the world crush my spirit. And in doing so, I\u2019d honor the memory of the brash delivery worker who\u2019d taught me to see the world not just as it was, but as it could be.",
        "story_b": "The first time Simon saw the delivery worker, he was perched on the edge of the curb, his sneakers untied and backpack slung low. The man rode into view like a streak of mischief, the wheels of his bike skidding to a halt just inches from Simon's toes. With a grin that could light up the grayest afternoon, he tipped an imaginary hat. \"Careful there, little man! Almost became part of my delivery.\"\n\nSimon watched, wide-eyed, as the man dismounted with a flair, balancing the bike with one hand while he pulled a package from the satchel slung over his shoulder. \"Name's Luke,\" he said, extending a grease-streaked hand. \"And one day, I'll deliver more than just packages\u2014I'll deliver my own destiny.\"\n\nA laugh bubbled out of Simon before he could stop it. Luke\u2019s daring seemed to defy the ordinary humdrum of the neighborhood, where the streets were lined with the sound of honking cars and the chatter of people rushing through their day. As they stood there, the sun casting long shadows, Simon felt a shift, as if a new adventure had just begun.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Simon would find himself waiting on the curb, anticipating the familiar whirr of Luke's bike. Their conversations, always filled with Luke's tales of adventure, took place in odd corners of the city: the rooftop of an old building overlooking the sprawling streets, or the quiet recesses of an alleyway with walls covered in vibrant graffiti.\n\nLuke's stories were a patchwork of dreams and escapades. \"I used to be an actor, you know,\" he told Simon one evening, the city lights twinkling like distant stars. \"Off-Broadway, nothing big. But those roles were alive, breathing inside me. Just like this city.\"\n\nSimon listened, captivated by Luke's charisma, the way he painted his life with bold strokes. Yet, there was always a hint of something unsaid in Luke's laughter, a dangerous edge that lingered like the aftertaste of a bitter memory.\n\nTheir bond grew in the spaces between deliveries, in shared slices of pizza and stolen moments. Simon admired the way Luke navigated the chaotic streets with ease, weaving through traffic as if he were invincible. Luke was a force of nature, unstoppable and fearless.\n\nBut Simon began to notice the watch Luke always wore, its face cracked, hands frozen at an impossible hour. \"Why don't you fix it?\" Simon asked one day, pointing to the watch.\n\nLuke merely shrugged. \"Keeps me grounded,\" he said, ruffling Simon's hair. \"A reminder that time\u2019s just a concept. You gotta live in the moment.\"\n\nThen, one crisp autumn afternoon, Luke didn't show up. Simon waited, his heart sinking with each passing hour. Days turned into a week, and still, there was no sign of him. The city seemed duller, its vibrancy dimmed without Luke's presence.\n\nIt was on a windy Saturday that Simon heard the news. Mrs. Alvarez, who ran the bodega on the corner, spoke in hushed tones as she handed him a folded piece of paper. \"Found it in one of his old deliveries,\" she said, her eyes soft with sympathy.\n\nThe letter was addressed to no one, its edges frayed. It spoke of dreams deferred, of family he\u2019d lost touch with, and of a longing to escape a past that clung like shadows. Luke's words were raw, filled with a vulnerability Simon had never seen.\n\nIn the letter, Luke wrote about an accident\u2014how he\u2019d lost someone dear, how the guilt had chased him like a relentless storm. He had come to the city to outrun it, to find redemption in the chaos of deliveries and fleeting connections.\n\nSimon sat on the rooftop where they used to talk, the city sprawling below him, a vast ocean of stories. He realized then that Luke's bravado had been a shield, his dreams a way to keep the darkness at bay. The watch, with its stopped hands, was more than a symbol; it was a reminder of time stolen, of lives intertwined with fate's cruel hand.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Simon grappled with questions that felt too big for him. He wondered about the nature of dreams, of destinies that seemed always just out of reach. Was Luke's story one of fate, or had he been caught in the web of history, unable to break free?\n\nThe city continued its relentless pace, but for Simon, everything had changed. He found himself looking for pieces of Luke in the streets, in the laughter of strangers, in the fleeting moments where life felt vibrant and full.\n\nOne evening, as the sky bled into shades of pink and orange, Simon returned to the rooftop. He closed his eyes and imagined Luke beside him, recounting some wild delivery adventure with that infectious grin.\n\nSimon took a deep breath, feeling the weight of history, of dreams unfulfilled. He knew that Luke's story would remain with him, a reminder of the fragility and strength that coexisted within each of us.\n\nAs the last light faded, Simon opened his eyes, a resolve settling within him. He would honor Luke\u2019s memory by living boldly, by embracing the unpredictability of life. And somewhere, in the heart of the city, Simon felt Luke's presence\u2014a whisper in the wind, a promise that destinies could still be delivered.",

        "ground_truth": "Israel Rostov was a high school dropout who worked as a fur-cart pusher in the State and Lake Building. Roy was eight years old when he first saw him. On Saturdays Roy often accompanied his grandfather, Jack Colby, whom he called Pops, to the furriers\u2019 office there that Pops shared with his brothers, Ike and Nate. Their brother Louie, who was the president of the Chicago Furriers Association, which he had founded, kept his office on the sixth floor of the building. The Colby brothers\u2019 office was on the eighth floor.\n\nRoy would sit on a high stool and cut up pelts with a stiletto-like knife Pops had taught him to use, while his grandfather and great-uncles sat around a marble-topped table and played cards. When Louie joined them, the game was bridge; otherwise, they played three-handed gin rummy.\n\nIzzy Rostov delivered furs on carts from floor to floor. He was a short kid with thick, curly black hair and bushy eyebrows, small dark-brown eyes, and a huge hook nose that seemed to be trying to escape from his face. Rostov\u2019s thick red lips curved upward at the corners so that it looked as if he were always smiling, except that his smile more resembled a sneer. He perpetually had a burning, unfiltered Lucky Strike dripping from his mouth. Roy was fascinated by Izzy\u2019s ability to talk while never removing the cigarette from his lips, as if the butt end were glued between them.\n\nRostov called Roy \u201cmy little pal\u201d and stopped his cart to talk to him whenever he encountered Roy in the hallways or in the freight elevator. This usually occurred when Roy was going between the sixth and eighth floors to visit with his Uncle Louie. The delivery boy always had a future plan for himself that he told Roy about. Most of the time it had to do with his moving to Miami Beach to hang out in the luxury hotels so that he could \u201chook up with rich, lazy broads.\u201d\n\nOne afternoon, Rostov told Roy he had something special to show him but he couldn\u2019t do it in the hallway. Roy followed Izzy into the men\u2019s room on the eighth floor. After making sure that nobody else was in the bathroom, Rostov removed from one of his coat pockets a small black handgun and held it out for Roy to look at.\n\n\u201cThis is a .38-caliber snub-nosed revolver,\u201d Rostov said. \u201cA very accurate piece of hardware. I bought it from a spook on Maxwell Street.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with it?\u201d asked Roy.\n\n\u201cStick up a few gas stations, what else? I gotta get a stake together before I travel, buy some slick clothes to impress the broads, you know. I can\u2019t make it on the peanuts these penny-pinchin\u2019 Hebes pay me around here.\u201d\n\nIzzy Rostov tapped the tip of his prodigious nose with the barrel of his revolver and said, \u201cI might even have enough dough to get my beak fixed.\u201d\n\nThen he laughed and put the gun back into his coat pocket. The ash from Rostov\u2019s cigarette dangled dangerously, and Roy was certain it would fall off, but it didn\u2019t. Roy moved farther away from him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be frightened, little pal,\u201d said Izzy. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna shoot anyone. The piece is just to throw a scare into \u2019em, let the suckers know Israel Rostov means business. I could change my name too, once I get down south. How does Guy DeMarco sound? Smooth, huh? The broads\u2019ll go for a name like that. Guy DeMarco.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think gas stations keep a lot of cash around?\u201d Roy asked.\n\n\u201cDepends,\u201d said Rostov. \u201cBut I got bigger ideas.\u201d\n\nRostov came close to Roy, mussed up his hair, and then walked out of the men\u2019s room. Roy waited for a minute before returning to his grandfather\u2019s office. Jack, Ike, and Nate were playing gin.\n\n\u201cHey, babe,\u201d said Pops, \u201cI thought you were going to see your Uncle Louie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI decided not to. I just went to the washroom.\u201d\n\nRoy went over to his stool, climbed on, and resumed cutting up pelts.\n\nThe next time Roy ran into Izzy Rostov, the delivery boy winked at him but did not stop to talk. His cart was loaded with mink and fox stoles.\n\n\u201cGotta get these on a truck goin\u2019 to the Merchandise Mart,\u201d Izzy said, and pushed on toward the freight elevator.\n\nA couple of Saturdays after that, all four of the brothers were playing bridge, when Louie said, \u201cYou hear the Rostov boy got killed?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe delivery cart kid?\u201d asked Ike.\n\n\u201cYes. Apparently he tried to rob a liquor store on Huron the other night and the clerk shot him in the back before he could get away.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know about his parents?\u201d asked Nate.\n\n\u201cWhat about them?\u201d Jack asked.\n\n\u201cThey were survivors of Auschwitz.\u201d\n\n\u201cHorrible,\u201d said Ike. \u201cImagine how they must feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Auschwitz?\u201d asked Roy.\n\nThe men were silent for a few moments before Nate spoke.\n\n\u201cIt was a concentration camp, a prison death camp during the war where the Germans murdered Jews.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey also murdered Gypsies and communists,\u201d said Ike, \u201cbut mostly Jews.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Rostov\u2019s parents are still alive,\u201d Roy said.\n\n\u201cSome prisoners were rescued by the Allies before the Nazis could kill them,\u201d said Louie.\n\n\u201cHow many people did they kill?\u201d asked Roy.\n\n\u201cToo many to count,\u201d said his grandfather. \u201cThe accepted figure is six million.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore,\u201d said Louie. \u201cThey murdered more.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo think that the parents escaped the Holocaust,\u201d Nate said. \u201cThey come to America and their child is shot down in the street like a wild animal.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had a gun,\u201d Roy said. \u201cHe showed it to me.\u201d\n\nThe men all looked at Roy.\n\n\u201cIt was a snub-nosed .38,\u201d he said. \u201cIzzy told me he was going to stick up a gas station and move to Miami Beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of home life could the boy have had?\u201d said Nate.\n\nRoy looked out a window onto State Street. The Chicago Theatre was showing Alan Ladd in The Badlanders. Clumps of brown dirt the size of pigeons were blowing through the gray air.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s play cards,\u201d said Ike.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The summer I turned eleven, our small town felt like it was holding its breath. Dust settled thick on the streets, the heat shimmering off the blacktop like a mirage. That was the summer I met Eddie.\n\nEddie was the new delivery worker for the local grocery store, a lanky guy in his mid-twenties with a mop of unruly hair and a smile that could charm the stripes off a zebra. He drove an ancient, battered pickup that rattled down the street like it was barely holding together, and he always had a cigarette dangling from his lips, the smoke curling up into the sky like a question mark.\n\nHe\u2019d show up at our house every Thursday, hauling bags of groceries to the front porch while my mother fussed over the order. I\u2019d sit on the steps, watching him with a mix of curiosity and envy. He moved with a sort of reckless energy, like he was always on the brink of something exciting.\n\n\u201cHey, kid,\u201d he said to me one afternoon, wiping the sweat off his brow. \u201cYou ever ride in a truck like this?\u201d\n\nI shook my head, my eyes wide. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, a sound like gravel rolling down a hill. \u201cSir? Man, you make me feel old. Name\u2019s Eddie. Wanna come see something cool?\u201d\n\nMy mother would\u2019ve had a fit if she knew, but something about Eddie made me trust him. I hopped off the steps and followed him to the truck. He opened the door with a creak and gestured for me to climb in. The seat was cracked and worn, the dashboard littered with old receipts and empty soda cans. But to me, it was a treasure trove.\n\n\u201cCheck this out,\u201d Eddie said, reaching into the glove compartment. He pulled out a small, leather-bound notebook and handed it to me. \u201cThese are my plans. Gonna open my own shop someday. Get outta this town, you know?\u201d\n\nI flipped through the pages, filled with sketches and notes. It was like looking into a secret world, one where Eddie was more than just a delivery worker. He was a dreamer, a builder, an architect of his own future.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really cool,\u201d I said, handing it back to him.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his eyes distant. \u201cJust gotta save up enough cash. Won\u2019t be long now.\u201d\n\nFrom that day on, I looked forward to Thursdays. Eddie would tell me stories about his dreams, about the places he wanted to go and the things he wanted to do. He had a way of making the world seem bigger, more full of possibilities. He talked about opening a bike shop, then a caf\u00e9, then a music store. His dreams were as wild and shifting as the clouds in the summer sky.\n\nBut there was an edge to him, too. Sometimes, I\u2019d catch a glimpse of it in the way he clenched his jaw or stared off into the distance. It was like he was running from something, and no matter how fast he went, it was always right behind him.\n\nOne Thursday, Eddie didn\u2019t show up. I waited on the steps all afternoon, my heart sinking with every passing minute. My mother said he probably just had the day off, but I could tell she was worried, too. The next week, another delivery worker came, a grizzled old man who didn\u2019t say much.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to Eddie?\u201d I asked, my voice trembling.\n\nThe man looked at me with sad eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear, kid? Eddie got into some trouble. Car crash. Didn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nThe words hit me like a punch to the gut. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Eddie, with his big dreams and easy smile, gone just like that. It didn\u2019t seem fair. It didn\u2019t seem real.\n\nIn the days that followed, I learned more about Eddie\u2019s life than I ever had while he was alive. He\u2019d grown up in a rough part of town, raised by a single mother who worked three jobs to make ends meet. He\u2019d dropped out of high school to help support his family, taking on whatever work he could find. The dreams he shared with me were more than just fantasies; they were his way out, his hope for something better.\n\nAs I pieced together his story, I began to understand the weight he carried. Eddie had lived a hard life, one filled with struggle and sacrifice. But he\u2019d never let it crush his spirit. He\u2019d held onto his dreams with a tenacity that both inspired and haunted me.\n\nI spent a lot of time that summer sitting on the front steps, thinking about Eddie. His death left me with a gnawing sense of loss, but also a burning question: Why do some people get trapped by their circumstances while others manage to break free? Was it fate, family, luck, or something else entirely?\n\nOne afternoon, I found myself flipping through an old book my father had left behind. It was filled with stories of heroes and adventurers, people who faced insurmountable odds and came out the other side stronger. Eddie had been like one of those heroes to me, but his story had ended too soon.\n\nI realized then that Eddie\u2019s dreams didn\u2019t have to die with him. They could live on in the people he\u2019d touched, in the lessons he\u2019d taught me. He\u2019d shown me that no matter how tough life gets, you can always dream, always strive for something better.\n\nAs the summer faded into fall, I made a promise to myself. I\u2019d keep Eddie\u2019s dreams alive by chasing my own, by never letting the weight of the world crush my spirit. And in doing so, I\u2019d honor the memory of the brash delivery worker who\u2019d taught me to see the world not just as it was, but as it could be.",
        "story_b": "The first time Jake met Sam, it was a day etched with the chaos of summer rain. The kind that makes the city streets gleam like polished mirrors and sends pedestrians scurrying for cover. Jake, a boy with wide eyes and a collection of model airplanes, was perched on the stoop of his apartment building, watching the world ripple through the rain.\n\nSam's arrival was heralded by the screech of brakes and the dull thud of a delivery box tumbling from the back of his battered truck. The box burst open, spilling its contents\u2014a dozen soccer balls\u2014into the glistening street. Jake's laughter bubbled over, catching Sam's attention as he wrestled the balls back into their cardboard prison.\n\n\"Hey, kid! You ever play soccer in the rain?\" Sam shouted, his voice a gravelly mix of challenge and amusement.\n\nJake shook his head, intrigued by the man's audacity. \"Not unless I want to catch a cold.\"\n\nSam chuckled, his grin wide beneath the brim of a signature red cap, the kind that seemed part of his very identity. \"Cold's just a myth parents use to keep kids inside. You help me out here, and I'll tell you a secret about these old city streets.\"\n\nIntrigued by the promise of adventure, Jake leapt into action, chasing after the rogue soccer balls. It was the beginning of an unlikely friendship, one where Sam's brash energy met Jake's youthful curiosity head-on.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Jake found himself tagging along with Sam on his delivery routes, the city becoming their shared playground. Sam navigated the bustling avenues with a reckless grace, the delivery truck rumbling like a beast of burden. To Jake, those rides were akin to flying\u2014unbound and exhilarating.\n\n\"Ever think of being a pilot?\" Jake asked one day, as they watched planes soar over the city's skyline.\n\nSam's eyes flickered with a wistful glow. \"I used to dream about it,\" he confessed, his voice softening. \"Thought I'd be flying over the world by now, not just driving through it.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you?\" Jake's question hung in the air, innocent and probing.\n\nSam shrugged, a shadow crossing his face. \"Life's got a way of clipping your wings, kid. But dreams\u2014they're like kites in a storm. You hold on tight, even when the wind tries to snatch 'em away.\"\n\nJake was mesmerized by Sam's stories, each one a piece of the puzzle that was Sam's life. There was the tale of a tattoo etched in ink and memory on Sam's forearm\u2014a tangled knot of lines and symbols that hinted at a past Jake couldn't quite decipher. And there were the cryptic phone calls, where Sam's voice would drop to a low murmur, leaving Jake to wonder about the stories left unspoken.\n\nDespite the mystery, Jake saw in Sam a resilience that shone through the cracks of his hardened exterior. Sam's laughter, a rough melody, became a constant in Jake's days, a counterpoint to the city's restless symphony.\n\nBut fate, ever the capricious playwright, had its own script. One evening, as the city basked in the golden light of a setting sun, Jake overheard a conversation that set his world tilting.\n\n\"Yeah, I know it's risky, but what choice do I have?\" Sam's voice was tight, edged with desperation. \"I can't keep running forever.\"\n\nThe words were a puzzle Jake couldn't solve, their weight pressing down on him like the gathering dusk. He wanted to ask Sam, to unravel the tangled threads of his life, but before he could, the opportunity slipped through his fingers like sand.\n\nIt was a few days later, on a morning draped in fog, that the news came. Sam was gone, the victim of a collision on the very streets he had navigated with such reckless abandon. The world felt suddenly smaller to Jake, the loss an echo that reverberated in the empty spaces Sam once filled.\n\nIn the aftermath, Jake found himself standing at the edge of the city park, a place they had often visited. The park was a patchwork of memories\u2014of laughter shared, of dreams whispered into the wind.\n\nJake closed his eyes, the scent of gasoline and the distant hum of traffic enveloping him. He thought of Sam, of kites caught in storms, and of dreams that seemed to soar just out of reach. There was a lesson there, Jake realized, about the fragility of life and the tenacity of dreams, and how history can weigh heavy on the present.\n\nHe opened his eyes, staring at the sky where planes traced invisible paths. Sam's absence was a void, but within it, Jake found a spark of understanding. The world was vast and unpredictable, yet filled with moments that could shape a lifetime.\n\nAs Jake stood at the crossroads of memory and future, he felt the weight of Sam's story settle like a gentle hand on his shoulder. Their friendship had been a brief, brilliant flame, but it had left a mark on Jake's heart, a reminder that even in loss, there was a kind of grace.\n\nAnd so, Jake took a deep breath, letting the wind carry his thoughts skyward, and stepped forward into the world, ready to chase his own dreams with the same fierce determination Sam had shown him.",

He pulled out a small, leather-bound notebook and handed it to me. \u201cThese are my plans. Gonna open my own shop someday. Get outta this town, you know?\u201d\n\nI flipped through the pages, filled with sketches and notes. It was like looking into a secret world, one where Eddie was more than just a delivery worker. He was a dreamer, a builder, an architect of his own future.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really cool,\u201d I said, handing it back to him.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his eyes distant. \u201cJust gotta save up enough cash. Won\u2019t be long now.\u201d\n\nFrom that day on, I looked forward to Thursdays. Eddie would tell me stories about his dreams, about the places he wanted to go and the things he wanted to do. He had a way of making the world seem bigger, more full of possibilities. He talked about opening a bike shop, then a caf\u00e9, then a music store. His dreams were as wild and shifting as the clouds in the summer sky.\n\nBut there was an edge to him, too. Sometimes, I\u2019d catch a glimpse of it in the way he clenched his jaw or stared off into the distance. It was like he was running from something, and no matter how fast he went, it was always right behind him.\n\nOne Thursday, Eddie didn\u2019t show up. I waited on the steps all afternoon, my heart sinking with every passing minute. My mother said he probably just had the day off, but I could tell she was worried, too. The next week, another delivery worker came, a grizzled old man who didn\u2019t say much.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to Eddie?\u201d I asked, my voice trembling.\n\nThe man looked at me with sad eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear, kid? Eddie got into some trouble. Car crash. Didn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nThe words hit me like a punch to the gut. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Eddie, with his big dreams and easy smile, gone just like that. It didn\u2019t seem fair. It didn\u2019t seem real.\n\nIn the days that followed, I learned more about Eddie\u2019s life than I ever had while he was alive. He\u2019d grown up in a rough part of town, raised by a single mother who worked three jobs to make ends meet. He\u2019d dropped out of high school to help support his family, taking on whatever work he could find. The dreams he shared with me were more than just fantasies; they were his way out, his hope for something better.\n\nAs I pieced together his story, I began to understand the weight he carried. Eddie had lived a hard life, one filled with struggle and sacrifice. But he\u2019d never let it crush his spirit. He\u2019d held onto his dreams with a tenacity that both inspired and haunted me.\n\nI spent a lot of time that summer sitting on the front steps, thinking about Eddie. His death left me with a gnawing sense of loss, but also a burning question: Why do some people get trapped by their circumstances while others manage to break free? Was it fate, family, luck, or something else entirely?\n\nOne afternoon, I found myself flipping through an old book my father had left behind. It was filled with stories of heroes and adventurers, people who faced insurmountable odds and came out the other side stronger. Eddie had been like one of those heroes to me, but his story had ended too soon.\n\nI realized then that Eddie\u2019s dreams didn\u2019t have to die with him. They could live on in the people he\u2019d touched, in the lessons he\u2019d taught me. He\u2019d shown me that no matter how tough life gets, you can always dream, always strive for something better.\n\nAs the summer faded into fall, I made a promise to myself. I\u2019d keep Eddie\u2019s dreams alive by chasing my own, by never letting the weight of the world crush my spirit. And in doing so, I\u2019d honor the memory of the brash delivery worker who\u2019d taught me to see the world not just as it was, but as it could be.",
        "story_b": "The rumble of the delivery truck echoed through the narrow alley as it came to a halt. Jonah, wide-eyed and curious, watched from his perch on the stoop as the driver, a burly man with a grin that could light up a room, hopped out. The man was Carlos, a delivery worker known for his quick wit and even quicker hands.\n\n\"What's the scoop, kid?\" Carlos called out, adjusting his cap as he approached Jonah.\n\n\"Not much, just waiting for my mom to get back,\" Jonah replied, kicking his feet against the step.\n\nCarlos nodded, leaning against his truck. \"You call that a sandwich?\" he said, pointing to Jonah's lunch. \"My grandma could do better with her eyes closed.\"\n\nJonah laughed, taking a bite anyway. \"What do you want to do after all these deliveries, Carlos?\"\n\nCarlos's eyes sparkled with a dream only he could see. \"Open a restaurant,\" he said, like it was the most natural thing in the world. \"A place where everyone can taste my grandpa's empanadas. He came here with nothing but a suitcase and a recipe.\"\n\n\"Empanadas?\" Jonah echoed, his interest piqued.\n\n\"Yeah, kid. The best you\u2019ll ever taste,\" Carlos said, patting his stomach. \"One day, I'll have a place with a line out the door.\"\n\nTheir conversations continued like this over the weeks, Carlos teasing Jonah about his crush on the girl down the street. \"You better deliver that love letter before she finds someone else,\" he\u2019d joke, his laughter bouncing off the brick walls.\n\nBut there was always an edge to Carlos, a dangerous gleam in his eyes when he talked about hustling to make it in the world. \"You gotta keep your head up, Jonah,\" he'd say. \"Life's a street fight, and you gotta be ready.\"\n\nOne rainy afternoon, Jonah found himself in Carlos's truck, the smell of fresh bread wafting from the bakery as they passed by. Jonah loved these moments, the city blurring past, Carlos recounting tales from his family's history.\n\n\"Do you think we're stuck with the life we're given?\" Jonah asked, staring out the window.\n\nCarlos shrugged, his hands steady on the wheel. \"History's just a bunch of stories, kid. It's up to us to write our own.\"\n\nThe words lingered with Jonah long after he climbed out of the truck, a new layer of understanding settling over him.\n\nThen one day, the truck didn\u2019t rumble down the street. Carlos didn't hop out with his usual grin. Instead, whispers spread through the neighborhood about a delivery gone wrong, a confrontation that turned deadly.\n\nJonah sat on the stoop, staring at the spot where Carlos's truck usually parked, his mind reeling. The vibrant tales of empanadas and dreams of a bustling restaurant felt like fragile memories slipping through his fingers.\n\nThe next morning, Jonah decided to visit Carlos's family. He imagined how it would be, stepping into their home, filled with the aroma of spices and stories of old times. He wanted to pay his respects, to connect with the roots of the man who had shared so much with him.\n\nCarlos's mother opened the door, her eyes red-rimmed but warm. \"You must be Jonah,\" she said, ushering him inside.\n\nThe house was small but filled with laughter and tears, photos of Carlos and his family lining the walls. Jonah listened as stories were shared, tales of Carlos\u2019s relentless spirit and the sacrifices his family had made.\n\n\"Fate's a funny thing,\" Carlos's uncle said, handing Jonah a plate of empanadas. \"Carlos always believed he was meant for more. And in a way, he was right.\"\n\nJonah nodded, biting into the empanada. It was as if he could taste the legacy, the dreams, and the determination that had fueled Carlos's life.\n\nAs Jonah left, he paused to look at the sky, a kaleidoscope of colors painting the horizon. He thought about fate, family, and the weight of history. The loss of Carlos left a void, but it also ignited a fire within Jonah\u2014a desire to honor the dreams of those who came before him.\n\nSitting back on the stoop, Jonah reflected on their last conversation, the way Carlos's eyes had lit up when talking about his restaurant. \"You gotta hustle to make it in this world,\" Carlos had said.\n\nJonah knew he would carry those words with him, a reminder that while history was just stories, it was up to him to write his own chapter. He promised himself he would remember Carlos not just for his untimely death but for the passion and dreams he had shared.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, one day Jonah would open a restaurant, the kind Carlos had always dreamed of, with a line out the door and the world tasting the empanadas that carried a legacy.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, Jonah felt a sense of calm, knowing that Carlos\u2019s story, though tragically cut short, had left an indelible mark on his own. The weight of history was heavy, but it was a burden he was willing to bear, fueled by the dreams of a brash delivery worker who had taught him that fate was something you could change with enough determination and heart.",

        "prompt": "A writer, desperate to please his mother, attempts to craft a children's story, only to find her critique sharper than any editor's and her demand for a happy ending far more challenging than he anticipated.",
        "ground_truth": "To please his mother, a writer attempts a children\u2019s story. The mother doesn\u2019t usually read fiction but will read a children\u2019s story and, if it\u2019s good, show it to all her friends. In his mother\u2019s eyes, the writer is, by and large, an anomaly. She believes that writing is a skill, not a vocation, and to make up stories for anyone other than children is a silly way to occupy one\u2019s time.\n\nSo here is his attempt at a story that maybe his mother will read and show her friends.\n\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a clown. The clown lived in a village that had no other clowns, for each village was allotted only one. The job of the clown was to scare some children but amuse others. He had balloons and face paint and could juggle. Half the time, he appeared without warning, and the other half he provided notice of the when, where, and what. Children had a fifty-fifty chance of receiving each option: the clown could either burst out from under their bed to juggle hatchets (no notice) or appear at their birthday party to juggle balls (notice given). If a child was amused once, there was no guarantee that this would happen again. Still, the chance of that child\u2019s being scared was no higher than it would have been, because, in this fair and made-up world, the clown existed to teach a lesson: that events of fear and events of joy are independent, and independent events must have independent probabilities.\n\nThe writer thinks this last sentence will please his mother. In her home country, she\u2019d taught math and begun work on a textbook, but then came instability, uprisings, and she and his father had had to leave. For a long time and openly, she\u2019d hoped that her son would carry on her work. \u201cMy son, the writer of textbooks\u201d is how she would have introduced him\u2014instead of simply \u201cmy son.\u201d\n\nThe mother now lives in a facility, and he visits her there. He gives her a printout of the children\u2019s story, and she reads it. From bed, she says, \u201cYou must have footnotes with proper notation. How else is a child supposed to understand that for independent events the probability of A equals the probability of A given B, and the probability of B equals the probability of B given A? It\u2019s not clear. But what\u2019s clear is that you\u2019re writing about me,\u201d she says, tapping her finger on the page at the word \u201cclown.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re clearly writing about your father and me, and none of my friends will want to read that.\u201d\n\nThe writer\u2019s father is no longer with them and was neither a funny man nor a person who had opinions about clowns. He and the writer\u2019s mother had been married for forty-seven years, most of which were arduous and sombre. In the new country, they\u2019d had to work menial jobs. It did not help that the father had a horrendous temper, made worse by his belief that everyone around him was belittling him, and by the fact that everyone was. So he raged and lashed out at home and left all the bathroom cleaning to his wife.\n\n\u201cAlso, I want a happy ending,\u201d the mother says, folding up the story and setting it on her nightstand. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to write happy.\u201d\n\nHe asks how she could know that if she has never read anything of his.\n\n\u201cI hear things from my friends,\u201d she says. \u201cThey all say you\u2019re too serious and no one knows what you mean.\u201d\n\nBecause she raised and didn\u2019t abandon him, because of her troubles and the unfinished textbook, the writer returns to his story to see what he can do.\n\nOne day, the children gathered in the village square to take a vote. Future clown encounters, they argued, had to either all be happy or all be scary. One of these options had to win, and they would not accept an in-between. They needed to have certainty. They voted unanimously for happiness, of course, and then, in parallel lines, wearing hats and safety equipment, the children marched to the hut at the edge of the village where the clown lived. They barred the door and windows from the outside. They lit a torch and told the clown inside that if he didn\u2019t change his metrics, they would burn down the hut. The clown refused: the rules of his tenure were fixed, and if he gave in to the children\u2019s request the village would oust him and replace him with another clown. The children encircled the hut and held hands. They chanted gibberish and made menacing expressions that were subpar. Then they threw the torch onto the hut\u2019s straw roof. \u201cFear and joy!\u201d the clown lectured, until he suffocated and could no longer be heard. The children cheered as the flaming hut caved in and crushed him; then, in parallel lines, they marched back to the village square, where the adults were waiting.\n\nHaving learned what the children had done, the adults were grim. With the clown gone, they now had to scare or amuse the children themselves. Up to this point, the adults had had a contract of emotional neutrality. They dealt with the feeding, sheltering, and not abandoning, while the clown dealt with the rest. News travelled to other villages of what the children had done, and the children of other villages followed suit, which meant that clowns were soon in short supply and the over-all profession lost its prestige. As the adults of these murderous, arsonist children were forced to take on new roles, they found the rule of independent probabilities failing them. Some could bring only fear, and the probability of future fear was dependent on the probability of past fear, as well as on the parent\u2019s over-all chance of penitence. Others could only bring joy, and, likewise, that probability was dependent on other factors, such as the children\u2019s response to repeated joy, to guaranteed joy, and to the adults\u2019 ability to sustain joy through their socioeconomic status.\n\nThe clowns never returned, and the adults became parents, and their children became adults who begot more children, whom they had to parent. Thus was born, in these villages, the idea of conditional probabilities and, with it, the practice of conditional love.\n\nAfter the mother reads the story, she is silent for long enough that the son thinks she has died, in bed, with her eyes open. He waves a frantic hand in her face until she blinks.\n\n\u201cYou must be making fun of me,\u201d she says.\n\nThe writer says he would never dare.\n\n\u201cYou are,\u201d she says, with patience and firmness.\n\nThe writer truly would never dare.\n\nThe mother looks at her son in disbelief that she has brought such a person into the world. A person incapable of writing a children\u2019s story or a happy ending. Is this a result of too much imagination or too little? Is this revenge? \u2666\n\n",
        "story_a": "The typewriter keys clattered like a discordant symphony in the dimly lit study. Julian's fingers hovered above them, searching for the right words, the perfect cadence that might conjure the elusive approval of his mother. His mother, who had devoured books to escape a life of compromises, who had been the first to place a pencil in his hand and urge him to draw the world as he saw it. She had never asked for much, but now she had asked for this. A children's story, bright and optimistic, to read to her first grandchild. \n\nJulian glanced at the half-empty glass of bourbon on the desk, the liquid amber catching the light from the single desk lamp. He took a sip, feeling the warmth spread through his chest, and turned back to the blank page in the typewriter. He had written for magazines and literary journals, had his work dissected by critics and professors, but nothing had prepared him for this\u2014creating a tale simple enough for a child but profound enough to satisfy his mother's discerning eye.\n\nThe study door creaked open. His mother, Margaret, entered with an air of quiet determination. Though her hair had turned silver, her eyes retained the same sharpness that had once quashed his adolescent rebellions with a single glance.\n\n\"How's it coming along?\" she asked, her voice carrying the weight of expectation.\n\nJulian hesitated. \"It's... a work in progress.\"\n\nMargaret moved to the window, drawing back the heavy curtains to let in the pale morning light. \"I don't understand why it's taking so long. It's just a children's story.\"\n\nHe sighed, running a hand through his disheveled hair. \"It's not just any story, Mother. It has to be right.\"\n\nShe turned, her gaze piercing through his feeble defense. \"It has to have a happy ending. That's all I ask.\"\n\nJulian nodded, though he felt the weight of her request like an anchor. Happy endings had never come naturally to him; his characters were often left grappling with their flaws, their resolutions ambiguous, their lives mirroring the complexities of his own. But for his mother, he would try.\n\nThat night, as the house settled into its nocturnal rhythms, Julian sat alone in the study, the typewriter's clack-clack a steady companion. He began with a village nestled in a valley, where sunlight kissed the rooftops and laughter echoed through the cobblestone streets. The protagonist, a young girl named Clara, was curious and kind-hearted, traits his mother had always valued. Clara's journey led her through enchanted forests and talking animals, each encounter a lesson in kindness and courage.\n\nDays turned into weeks. Julian's desk became a battlefield of crumpled pages and ink stains. His mother's visits were frequent, her critiques sharp but fair. \"Clara's too passive,\" she would say, or \"The dialogue needs more warmth.\" He absorbed her feedback, revising tirelessly, but the happy ending remained elusive.\n\nOne afternoon, as Julian sat staring at the latest draft, Margaret entered without knocking. She carried a small, worn book in her hands. \"I want to show you something,\" she said, placing the book in front of him. It was a collection of fairy tales, the cover faded from years of handling.\n\nJulian opened the book, the pages brittle under his fingers. He recognized the stories\u2014ones she had read to him as a child. \"Why are you showing me this?\"\n\nMargaret's eyes softened with nostalgia. \"These stories... they gave me hope when I needed it most. I want Clara's story to do the same for your niece.\"\n\nJulian closed the book gently. \"Hope isn't always easy to write.\"\n\nHis mother smiled, a rare tenderness in her expression. \"No, but it's necessary.\"\n\nThat night, Julian dreamed of his childhood, the nights spent wrapped in blankets, listening to his mother's voice as she read from the fairy tale book. He remembered the comfort of those stories, the way they had painted a world where problems could be solved and happiness was attainable.\n\nHe awoke with a sense of clarity. Returning to the typewriter, he rewrote Clara's journey, infusing it with the hope his mother had spoken of. Clara faced trials, but each one brought her closer to understanding her own strength. The forest, once dark and foreboding, became a place of discovery and friendship.\n\nAnd the ending\u2014Julian crafted it with care. Clara returned to her village, not just victorious but transformed. She had learned that happiness was not the absence of hardship but the presence of love and courage. The village celebrated her return, the air filled with music and laughter, and Clara knew she was home.\n\nJulian typed the final words, a sense of quiet satisfaction settling over him. He placed the manuscript in a folder and carried it to his mother's room. She was sitting by the window, knitting a blanket for the baby.\n\n\"Is it finished?\" she asked, looking up.\n\nHe nodded, handing her the folder. \"I hope you like it.\"\n\nMargaret took the manuscript and began to read. Julian watched her face, searching for any sign of approval or disappointment. When she finished, she closed the folder and looked at him, her eyes glistening.\n\n\"It's beautiful,\" she said softly. \"Clara's journey... it's everything I hoped it would be.\"\n\nJulian felt a swell of relief and pride. \"Thank you, Mother.\"\n\nShe reached out, squeezing his hand. \"You have a gift, Julian. Never forget that.\"\n\nAs he left her room, Julian felt a weight lift from his shoulders. The story he had crafted for his mother had become more than just a tale for a child; it was a bridge between them, a testament to the power of hope and the enduring bond of family.\n\nIn the quiet of his study, Julian sat down at the typewriter once more. He began to write a letter to his niece, the newest member of their family, sharing with her the story of Clara and the lessons she had learned. As he wrote, he realized that the happy ending his mother had demanded was not just for Clara, but for all of them.",
        "story_b": "In the tiny corner of his cramped apartment that he generously called an office, Louis stared at the computer screen, a sea of crumpled drafts and ink-stained fingers around him. His mother, a retired librarian with opinions as sharp as the corners of the books she shelved, had one simple request: a children\u2019s story. Not just any children\u2019s story, but one with a happy ending, the kind that would leave the youngest of readers with a smile rather than existential dread.\n\nLouis had written moody novels, short stories that left readers questioning their life choices, and even an article on the socio-political implications of garden gnomes. But a children's story? That was foreign territory, akin to a mathematician suddenly asked to compose a sonnet.\n\nHe glanced at the draft titled \"The Lonely Dragon,\" where a dragon named Fergus found solace not in fiery destruction but in knitting. But there was a problem: Fergus\u2019s kingdom was too tangled in its own yarn-based economy to find any resolution. His mother had looked at him over her glasses and said, \"Louis, I think you might be overthinking it.\"\n\nOverthinking was his forte. He began again, his fingers tapping rhythmically against the keyboard, as if trying to coax the words into aligning themselves into something coherent and, more importantly, mother-approved. The sun dipped lower, casting a warm orange glow over his cluttered desk, but the glow brought no warmth to his creative turmoil.\n\nHis next attempt involved a bunny who couldn\u2019t hop. An allegory for self-acceptance, he thought. But his mother, after reading the first page, had simply sighed. \"Louis, children need to believe they can hop,\" she said, her critique weighing as heavily as a stack of unreturned library books.\n\n\"Why can\u2019t I just write a tragedy?\" Louis muttered to himself, imagining the bunny facing an existential crisis, pondering the futility of hopping in a world where foxes wore suits. His mother\u2019s voice echoed in his mind: \"Because, dear, life is tragic enough.\"\n\nThe doorbell rang, jolting him from his thoughts. It was his mother, with her usual punctuality and a casserole dish balanced precariously in her hands. She swept into the room, her presence filling the space with a mix of lavender perfume and unconditional love, tempered with a healthy dose of criticism.\n\n\"Have you made any progress?\" she asked, setting the dish down and peering over his shoulder at the screen. Louis quickly minimized the document, hoping she wouldn\u2019t notice the lack of happy endings in his digital wake.\n\n\"Uh, sort of,\" he replied, scratching the back of his head. \"I was thinking about a story where the protagonist tries really hard to please someone important to them, but\u2014\"\n\n\"But what, Louis? They fail and learn a valuable lesson about self-worth?\" Her eyes twinkled with a humor that was both mocking and endearing.\n\n\"Something like that,\" he admitted, unable to keep a straight face.\n\n\"Well, tell me what you\u2019ve got,\" she said, settling into the chair opposite his desk, her expectation as palpable as the casserole's aroma.\n\nHe hesitated, then launched into the tale of Fergus again, trying to reframe it as a journey of creative self-discovery. His mother listened patiently, nodding in places, her expression a canvas of practiced neutrality. When he finished, she took a moment, as if weighing her words carefully.\n\n\"It\u2019s charming, Louis,\" she began. \"But don\u2019t you think Fergus could find happiness in something simpler? Perhaps he meets a friend who appreciates his knitting, someone who needs a scarf, maybe?\"\n\n\"Like a cold prince or something?\" Louis suggested, his voice tinged with irony.\n\n\"Exactly!\" Her eyes lit up with the enthusiasm of someone who\u2019d just discovered a first edition in a pile of paperbacks. \"And they become friends. That\u2019s what children need, Louis\u2014friendship and warmth.\"\n\nLouis sighed, a dramatic exhale that spoke volumes. \"Isn\u2019t that a bit... predictable?\" he ventured, imagining the prince not as a noble savior but a tax auditor, something more akin to real life.\n\n\"Predictability isn\u2019t a flaw in a children\u2019s story,\" she countered, a smile softening the edges of her critique. \"It\u2019s a comfort.\"\n\nHe nodded, the weight of her words sinking in. The challenge wasn\u2019t in the writing itself but in crafting a narrative that fit into a world where happy endings were not just desired but essential. It was a world he was still learning to navigate.\n\nAs she left, with promises to return for dinner, Louis stared at the screen once more. The cursor blinked expectantly, a metronome ticking down the moments until inspiration struck. He thought about Fergus and the prince, about knitting and castles and the absurdity of it all. And suddenly, the story unfolded in his mind\u2014a tale of warmth and unlikely alliances, of dragons and princes finding common ground.\n\nThe next day, he presented the revised story to his mother. Her eyes crinkled with delight as she read the final pages, where Fergus and the prince, wrapped in a vibrant tapestry of friendship, watched the sunset from a castle turret.\n\n\"It\u2019s perfect, Louis,\" she said, her voice thick with emotion. \"I knew you could do it.\"\n\nLouis smiled, a mixture of relief and pride washing over him. It wasn\u2019t the story he\u2019d set out to write, but it was one that felt right, both for him and for her. The ambiguity of the process\u2014the struggle, the compromise, the unexpected resolution\u2014mirrored the complexities of their relationship.\n\nLater, as he sat alone in his office, the satisfaction of his mother's approval settled over him. The story, with its layers of irony and humor, had found its way to a happy ending, even if the journey there was fraught with doubts and drafts. And perhaps, he mused, that was the real story all along\u2014a tale of familial expectations and creative pressure, resolved not with a bang but a contented sigh.\n\nHis mother\u2019s laughter echoed in his mind, a comforting reminder that, sometimes, predictability was exactly what the heart needed. And in that small corner of his world, amidst the chaos of creativity, Louis found peace in knowing that, for now, he had managed to craft his own kind of happy ending.",

How else is a child supposed to understand that for independent events the probability of A equals the probability of A given B, and the probability of B equals the probability of B given A? It\u2019s not clear. But what\u2019s clear is that you\u2019re writing about me,\u201d she says, tapping her finger on the page at the word \u201cclown.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re clearly writing about your father and me, and none of my friends will want to read that.\u201d\n\nThe writer\u2019s father is no longer with them and was neither a funny man nor a person who had opinions about clowns. He and the writer\u2019s mother had been married for forty-seven years, most of which were arduous and sombre. In the new country, they\u2019d had to work menial jobs. It did not help that the father had a horrendous temper, made worse by his belief that everyone around him was belittling him, and by the fact that everyone was. So he raged and lashed out at home and left all the bathroom cleaning to his wife.\n\n\u201cAlso, I want a happy ending,\u201d the mother says, folding up the story and setting it on her nightstand. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to write happy.\u201d\n\nHe asks how she could know that if she has never read anything of his.\n\n\u201cI hear things from my friends,\u201d she says. \u201cThey all say you\u2019re too serious and no one knows what you mean.\u201d\n\nBecause she raised and didn\u2019t abandon him, because of her troubles and the unfinished textbook, the writer returns to his story to see what he can do.\n\nOne day, the children gathered in the village square to take a vote. Future clown encounters, they argued, had to either all be happy or all be scary. One of these options had to win, and they would not accept an in-between. They needed to have certainty. They voted unanimously for happiness, of course, and then, in parallel lines, wearing hats and safety equipment, the children marched to the hut at the edge of the village where the clown lived. They barred the door and windows from the outside. They lit a torch and told the clown inside that if he didn\u2019t change his metrics, they would burn down the hut. The clown refused: the rules of his tenure were fixed, and if he gave in to the children\u2019s request the village would oust him and replace him with another clown. The children encircled the hut and held hands. They chanted gibberish and made menacing expressions that were subpar. Then they threw the torch onto the hut\u2019s straw roof. \u201cFear and joy!\u201d the clown lectured, until he suffocated and could no longer be heard. The children cheered as the flaming hut caved in and crushed him; then, in parallel lines, they marched back to the village square, where the adults were waiting.\n\nHaving learned what the children had done, the adults were grim. With the clown gone, they now had to scare or amuse the children themselves. Up to this point, the adults had had a contract of emotional neutrality. They dealt with the feeding, sheltering, and not abandoning, while the clown dealt with the rest. News travelled to other villages of what the children had done, and the children of other villages followed suit, which meant that clowns were soon in short supply and the over-all profession lost its prestige. As the adults of these murderous, arsonist children were forced to take on new roles, they found the rule of independent probabilities failing them. Some could bring only fear, and the probability of future fear was dependent on the probability of past fear, as well as on the parent\u2019s over-all chance of penitence. Others could only bring joy, and, likewise, that probability was dependent on other factors, such as the children\u2019s response to repeated joy, to guaranteed joy, and to the adults\u2019 ability to sustain joy through their socioeconomic status.\n\nThe clowns never returned, and the adults became parents, and their children became adults who begot more children, whom they had to parent. Thus was born, in these villages, the idea of conditional probabilities and, with it, the practice of conditional love.\n\nAfter the mother reads the story, she is silent for long enough that the son thinks she has died, in bed, with her eyes open. He waves a frantic hand in her face until she blinks.\n\n\u201cYou must be making fun of me,\u201d she says.\n\nThe writer says he would never dare.\n\n\u201cYou are,\u201d she says, with patience and firmness.\n\nThe writer truly would never dare.\n\nThe mother looks at her son in disbelief that she has brought such a person into the world. A person incapable of writing a children\u2019s story or a happy ending. Is this a result of too much imagination or too little? Is this revenge? \u2666\n\n",
        "story_a": "The typewriter keys clattered like a discordant symphony in the dimly lit study. Julian's fingers hovered above them, searching for the right words, the perfect cadence that might conjure the elusive approval of his mother. His mother, who had devoured books to escape a life of compromises, who had been the first to place a pencil in his hand and urge him to draw the world as he saw it. She had never asked for much, but now she had asked for this. A children's story, bright and optimistic, to read to her first grandchild. \n\nJulian glanced at the half-empty glass of bourbon on the desk, the liquid amber catching the light from the single desk lamp. He took a sip, feeling the warmth spread through his chest, and turned back to the blank page in the typewriter. He had written for magazines and literary journals, had his work dissected by critics and professors, but nothing had prepared him for this\u2014creating a tale simple enough for a child but profound enough to satisfy his mother's discerning eye.\n\nThe study door creaked open. His mother, Margaret, entered with an air of quiet determination. Though her hair had turned silver, her eyes retained the same sharpness that had once quashed his adolescent rebellions with a single glance.\n\n\"How's it coming along?\" she asked, her voice carrying the weight of expectation.\n\nJulian hesitated. \"It's... a work in progress.\"\n\nMargaret moved to the window, drawing back the heavy curtains to let in the pale morning light. \"I don't understand why it's taking so long. It's just a children's story.\"\n\nHe sighed, running a hand through his disheveled hair. \"It's not just any story, Mother. It has to be right.\"\n\nShe turned, her gaze piercing through his feeble defense. \"It has to have a happy ending. That's all I ask.\"\n\nJulian nodded, though he felt the weight of her request like an anchor. Happy endings had never come naturally to him; his characters were often left grappling with their flaws, their resolutions ambiguous, their lives mirroring the complexities of his own. But for his mother, he would try.\n\nThat night, as the house settled into its nocturnal rhythms, Julian sat alone in the study, the typewriter's clack-clack a steady companion. He began with a village nestled in a valley, where sunlight kissed the rooftops and laughter echoed through the cobblestone streets. The protagonist, a young girl named Clara, was curious and kind-hearted, traits his mother had always valued. Clara's journey led her through enchanted forests and talking animals, each encounter a lesson in kindness and courage.\n\nDays turned into weeks. Julian's desk became a battlefield of crumpled pages and ink stains. His mother's visits were frequent, her critiques sharp but fair. \"Clara's too passive,\" she would say, or \"The dialogue needs more warmth.\" He absorbed her feedback, revising tirelessly, but the happy ending remained elusive.\n\nOne afternoon, as Julian sat staring at the latest draft, Margaret entered without knocking. She carried a small, worn book in her hands. \"I want to show you something,\" she said, placing the book in front of him. It was a collection of fairy tales, the cover faded from years of handling.\n\nJulian opened the book, the pages brittle under his fingers. He recognized the stories\u2014ones she had read to him as a child. \"Why are you showing me this?\"\n\nMargaret's eyes softened with nostalgia. \"These stories... they gave me hope when I needed it most. I want Clara's story to do the same for your niece.\"\n\nJulian closed the book gently. \"Hope isn't always easy to write.\"\n\nHis mother smiled, a rare tenderness in her expression. \"No, but it's necessary.\"\n\nThat night, Julian dreamed of his childhood, the nights spent wrapped in blankets, listening to his mother's voice as she read from the fairy tale book. He remembered the comfort of those stories, the way they had painted a world where problems could be solved and happiness was attainable.\n\nHe awoke with a sense of clarity. Returning to the typewriter, he rewrote Clara's journey, infusing it with the hope his mother had spoken of. Clara faced trials, but each one brought her closer to understanding her own strength. The forest, once dark and foreboding, became a place of discovery and friendship.\n\nAnd the ending\u2014Julian crafted it with care. Clara returned to her village, not just victorious but transformed. She had learned that happiness was not the absence of hardship but the presence of love and courage. The village celebrated her return, the air filled with music and laughter, and Clara knew she was home.\n\nJulian typed the final words, a sense of quiet satisfaction settling over him. He placed the manuscript in a folder and carried it to his mother's room. She was sitting by the window, knitting a blanket for the baby.\n\n\"Is it finished?\" she asked, looking up.\n\nHe nodded, handing her the folder. \"I hope you like it.\"\n\nMargaret took the manuscript and began to read. Julian watched her face, searching for any sign of approval or disappointment. When she finished, she closed the folder and looked at him, her eyes glistening.\n\n\"It's beautiful,\" she said softly. \"Clara's journey... it's everything I hoped it would be.\"\n\nJulian felt a swell of relief and pride. \"Thank you, Mother.\"\n\nShe reached out, squeezing his hand. \"You have a gift, Julian. Never forget that.\"\n\nAs he left her room, Julian felt a weight lift from his shoulders. The story he had crafted for his mother had become more than just a tale for a child; it was a bridge between them, a testament to the power of hope and the enduring bond of family.\n\nIn the quiet of his study, Julian sat down at the typewriter once more. He began to write a letter to his niece, the newest member of their family, sharing with her the story of Clara and the lessons she had learned. As he wrote, he realized that the happy ending his mother had demanded was not just for Clara, but for all of them.",
        "story_b": "In a cluttered room that bore a striking resemblance to the aftermath of a literary hurricane, sat a beleaguered writer named Jonathan. The space was a battlefield of ideas, where every crumpled page was a fallen soldier in the war for a perfect story. Stacks of children's books teetered precariously, and drafts lay scattered like autumn leaves, each one a testament to Jonathan\u2019s mounting frustration. The air was filled with the faint scent of ink and desperation.\n\nJonathan was engaged in the Herculean task of writing a children's story. But this was no ordinary tale, for it was to please his mother, whose critique was sharper than any editor's red pen. Her expectations loomed large, her voice echoing in Jonathan\u2019s mind as he typed: \u201cMake sure it has a happy ending, dear. Every good children's story needs one.\u201d\n\n\"Why does every fairy tale need a prince?\" Jonathan muttered to himself, his fingers hovering over the keyboard. \"Can't a frog just be a frog?\"\n\nHe glanced at the latest draft, a whimsical tale of a dragon who dreamed of becoming a concert pianist. It was a story that dared to defy convention, where scales and symphonies intertwined. Jonathan had poured his heart into it, only for his mother to suggest, with the sweetest of smiles, \"The dragon should be more environmentally conscious. Perhaps he can plant trees with his tail?\"\n\nJonathan sighed, the weight of her critique pressing down like a stack of rejection letters. Was a happy ending really just a formulaic conclusion, or was it the ultimate test of a writer's creativity? He pondered this as his computer screen flickered ominously. Every time he typed \"happily ever after,\" the cursed device crashed, as if mocking his attempts at narrative closure.\n\nUndeterred, Jonathan embarked on a series of absurd plot twists, each more outlandish than the last. He envisioned a pirate rabbit who, upon discovering the treasure, found it to be a trove of mismatched socks. Surely, this twist would elicit laughter. Yet, his mother\u2019s voice intruded again, \"But what about the moral lesson, Jonathan? Children need to learn something, don't they?\"\n\nIn a fit of irony, he scribbled, \u201cThe lesson is: never trust a sock to hold your dreams. They have too many holes.\u201d Then, realizing the absurdity, he tore the page, another fallen soldier.\n\nJonathan's character development was equally challenging. He imagined a courageous princess who swapped her crown for a skateboard, only to hear his mother's gentle suggestion, \"She should also learn knitting. It's a valuable skill, you know.\"\n\n\"Sure, Mom,\" Jonathan grumbled. \"Because every child dreams of knitting their way to glory.\"\n\nAs the drafts accumulated, so did his frustration. He could see the absurdity of his situation, his creativity ensnared in a web of well-intentioned maternal advice. He pictured himself as a knight, tilting at windmills of critique with nothing but a pen for a lance.\n\nIn a moment of introspection, Jonathan considered his relationship with happy endings. They seemed as elusive as a needle in a haystack made of rejection letters. He wondered if perhaps he was searching in the wrong place. Maybe a happy ending wasn't about tying up loose ends with a neat bow, but about embracing the chaos of the story itself.\n\nWith renewed determination, Jonathan returned to his keyboard. He crafted a tale of a mischievous cat who, after a series of misadventures, learned to dance on the moon. It was whimsical, delightful, and, most importantly, it felt right. He imagined the cat twirling among the stars, free from the constraints of expectation.\n\nHe hesitated before typing those three fateful words: \"happily ever after.\" As if sensing his trepidation, the computer remained steady, its hum a gentle encouragement. Jonathan exhaled, a sense of completion washing over him.\n\nWith the final draft in hand, Jonathan nervously approached his mother. Her eyes lit up as she read, her expression softening with each turn of the page. Jonathan braced himself for the inevitable critique, the list of \"improvements\" longer than the story itself.\n\nBut to his surprise, she smiled, a genuine warmth in her eyes. \"Jonathan, it's wonderful,\" she said, her voice tinged with pride. \"The cat dances on the moon. It's perfect.\"\n\nRelief flooded through him, a tide washing away doubt and frustration. For the first time, he realized that a happy ending wasn't about meeting expectations but about finding joy in the story he wanted to tell.\n\nAs he left his mother's house, Jonathan felt lighter, as if a weight had been lifted. He glanced up at the sky, imagining his moon-dancing cat, and whispered to himself, \"Maybe all stories have happy endings, if we let them.\"\n\nBack in his cluttered room, Jonathan surveyed the battlefield of ideas, the fallen soldiers of drafts and crumpled pages. They were no longer symbols of defeat but reminders of a creative journey that, despite its chaos, had led to something beautiful.\n\nHe cleared a space on his desk, setting down the final draft with a reverence usually reserved for treasure. With a smile, he turned to a fresh page, ready to embark on his next adventure, knowing that the pursuit of a happy ending was, in itself, the most satisfying story of all.",

        "ground_truth": "To please his mother, a writer attempts a children\u2019s story. The mother doesn\u2019t usually read fiction but will read a children\u2019s story and, if it\u2019s good, show it to all her friends. In his mother\u2019s eyes, the writer is, by and large, an anomaly. She believes that writing is a skill, not a vocation, and to make up stories for anyone other than children is a silly way to occupy one\u2019s time.\n\nSo here is his attempt at a story that maybe his mother will read and show her friends.\n\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a clown. The clown lived in a village that had no other clowns, for each village was allotted only one. The job of the clown was to scare some children but amuse others. He had balloons and face paint and could juggle. Half the time, he appeared without warning, and the other half he provided notice of the when, where, and what. Children had a fifty-fifty chance of receiving each option: the clown could either burst out from under their bed to juggle hatchets (no notice) or appear at their birthday party to juggle balls (notice given). If a child was amused once, there was no guarantee that this would happen again. Still, the chance of that child\u2019s being scared was no higher than it would have been, because, in this fair and made-up world, the clown existed to teach a lesson: that events of fear and events of joy are independent, and independent events must have independent probabilities.\n\nThe writer thinks this last sentence will please his mother. In her home country, she\u2019d taught math and begun work on a textbook, but then came instability, uprisings, and she and his father had had to leave. For a long time and openly, she\u2019d hoped that her son would carry on her work. \u201cMy son, the writer of textbooks\u201d is how she would have introduced him\u2014instead of simply \u201cmy son.\u201d\n\nThe mother now lives in a facility, and he visits her there.

        "story_b": "When his mother casually mentioned her wish for a story about a brave little squirrel, he felt the weight of her expectations settle on his shoulders. The request seemed innocuous enough, a sweet mother's wish for her son to write something whimsical and delightful. But for him, it was a task fraught with the potential for disappointment, his mother's critiques lingering in his mind like ink that refused to fade.\n\nHe sat at his kitchen table, cluttered with drafts and coffee cups, his sanctuary and his battlefield. The first draft came to life with a squirrel named Nutty, who had a penchant for getting into trouble. Nutty found himself lost in the dense, enchanted forest, where each leaf shimmered like emeralds and the air was thick with the scent of pine and mystery. The squirrel's quest was simple: find his way back home.\n\n\"Nutty stumbled upon a magical acorn,\" the writer typed, the words flowing with the ease of a childhood memory. \"This acorn granted wishes, a treasure whispered about in the rustling leaves.\"\n\nHe sent the draft to his mother, anticipating her warm approval. Her feedback arrived in the form of a phone call, her voice laced with love yet cutting through his story like a red pen. \"But where's the joy, dear? Nutty seems to face one dilemma after another. Shouldn't he find happiness?\"\n\nHis mother's well-meaning critique echoed in his mind as he returned to his desk. Her eyes, he imagined, twinkled with affection, even as her words drove him to frustration. He wondered if she saw the world in black and white, while he painted in shades of gray. Yet, his desire to please her was stronger than his creative pride.\n\nDetermined to find the elusive happy ending, he drafted again. This time, the forest was alive with fantastical creatures\u2014a talking mushroom named Mo, whose advice was sage and occasionally nonsensical. Mo suggested that Nutty should wish for a map to guide him home.\n\n\"But what if the journey is the point?\" Nutty asked, his little heart swelling with newfound courage.\n\n\"Ah, my furry friend,\" Mo mused, \"sometimes the journey is just the beginning.\"\n\nThe writer paused, considering Mo's wisdom. Was he, too, on a journey to understand his mother's perspective? Was the happy ending she desired not just for Nutty, but for him as well?\n\nHe sent this revised version to his mother, hopeful for her applause. Her response was swift and sharp. \"It's charming, darling, but Nutty's journey feels incomplete. Shouldn't he find a home, a place of belonging?\"\n\nHer words stung, yet they sparked a revelation. The story wasn't just about Nutty\u2014it was about him, his struggle to find a narrative that fit within his mother's vision while remaining true to his own voice.\n\nHe brewed another cup of coffee, his mind a whirlwind of ideas. Nutty's tale unfolded once more, the forest now a vibrant tapestry of color and magic. Nutty, guided by Mo, discovered a hidden grove where the trees whispered secrets and the sky blazed with twilight hues. It was here that Nutty realized the true magic was not in the acorn, but in the friendships he had forged and the courage he had gained.\n\n\"Nutty knew, as he nestled among the whispering leaves, that he had found his home,\" the writer penned, the words imbued with newfound understanding.\n\nHe sent the final draft to his mother, his heart light yet apprehensive. Her reply came in the form of a handwritten letter, its envelope decorated with little acorns. He opened it with trembling hands.\n\n\"My dear,\" the letter read, \"you've captured the joy I wished for Nutty and for you. The journey you wrote, both for your little squirrel and yourself, is a story I cherish.\"\n\nIn that moment, he realized the story's true ending lay not in Nutty's adventure, but in his own acceptance of imperfection and the delicate dance of meeting his mother's expectations while honoring his creative voice.\n\nHe found peace in the process, the journey of writing a tale that reflected both his world and hers. In crafting Nutty's story, he discovered his own\u2014a narrative woven with humor, sincerity, and the gentle push and pull of a mother's love.\n\nAnd as he sat at his kitchen table, surrounded by drafts and empty coffee cups, he knew he had found a home in his storytelling, a place where both he and his mother could find joy.",

        "ground_truth": "Pantheons Call was thoroughly routed. Emant Harrown, Lord Elect of the religious order, sat tall on his horse outside the gates of Yistria. Behind him were the remnants of the small army he had commanded in the city. Had he but known the declaration Jaharet would make, he would have mustered the entirety of Pantheons Call. But she had taken him by surprisehe and the rest of Danthes. She had exposed herself in that moment for the charlatan she was, an impure soul muddying the holy mantle of leadership she had been gifted. And he and his followers had reacted in the only way they couldthey had attempted to capture the Blasphemer and force her to Ascend. Theyd almost had her. But Jaharet too had followers, men and women devoted to her in a manner that was almost fanatical. Her Empyrean Guard and the sentinels of the Sanctum had joined together to protect her.Theyd bought her precious time so that she and those closest to her could flee to the Sanctum, the holiest of temples located deep in the heart of the city. And from within the Sanctum, some of her protectorsthose clerics and priests and mages that had sided with herhad come together to create a magical ward that no sword or magic at Harrowns disposal could breach. She was impervious now, safe in her cocoon of sorcery. But not for long. The small force Harrown commanded had surrounded the Sanctum. There they would have remained until the whole of Pantheons Call had come to aid them, if it had not been for the unforeseen. Jaharets alliances ran deep and spread far. Not even a day after her announcement was made, a large rebel faction from Morialor had marched into the city. Formidable though Harrown and his men were in battle, they were outnumbered greatly when this rebel group banded together with those loyal to the Empyrean. It was to her credit, Harrown mused now as he stared at the city denied to him, that Jaharet did not order he and his men slain. It was also going to be something she would come to regret most intensely. She had allowed them to fall back and regroup outside the gates. And then she had ordered that all city gates be closed and all its walls manned. The Lord Elect suddenly wheeled his horse around. The beast, a magnificent destrier, snorted as it turned on its haunches. Before him were the remnants of the men hed commanded in the city, all of them looking equally as grim as their leader, all of them sporting the emblem of the Five Eyes somewhere on their clothing, weapons, or shields. Have the men been sent? Harrown asked one of his commanders as he rode past. The commander heeled his horse forward so that it kept pace with the Lord Elects mount. They have, Lord. Harrown mused on this. When the magical aegis went up around the Sanctum, Harrown had known instinctively that breaching it would require some creative thinking. Hed sent word out of the city with swift messengers, instructing those in various outposts throughout the country to scry for certain individuals who were in possession of particular skills. These skills, when brought together and put to use in tandem, would ultimately be the way the ward would fall. And so men had been dispatched, armed and capable, to retrieve these individuals chosen. Harrown knew they would not all come willingly. No, some wouldl resist, which is why certain pressures had been applied to convince them that this task is in their best interests. Of course, some of them would be all too willing to lend their skills to this most righteous of crusades. As Harrown and his men rode away from Yistria, heading south, he carefully considered those that were chosen for this task the Vessanian clansmen that lived outside civilization, whose skills with a horse and bow would provide protection when violence inevitably happens the clever, impious merchant, whose connections and influence would be necessary to navigate through a nation turned hostile against those that would harm Jaharet the willful mage, a risky choice that was green in experience yet vast in untapped power, who would lend her skills to breaching the ward that protects the Empyrean Daughter and the messenger, whose knowledge of Danthes roads, paths, and secret ways would guide them all through a hostile landscape, whose lack of allegiances makes him perhaps the most trustworthy of the lot All of them would be escortedsome perhaps by forceto meet Lord Elect Harrown. And he would impart upon them the absolute necessity of what they must do. He would make certain they realize that they must not fail. Until then, however there were other matters he must attend to. And so it was that he and his men left the Holy City and its untrue ruler behind. *** In other parts of Danthes, paths were altered. Harrowns men sought them out unerringly, their locations revealed through the scrying of Pantheon Calls own priests and mages. One by one they were made to understand that they had no choice in this, that they must obey. And one by one they left their homes, their families, the things that mattered to them to set out on these new blind paths.",
        "story_a": "The moon hung high and cold above the crumbling keep, its pale light casting long, jagged shadows across the courtyard. The once-majestic fortress now lay in ruins, a ghost of its former glory, with ivy creeping up its walls and the scent of damp earth filling the air. It was here, beneath the ancient stone archway, that Lord Malric stood, his silhouette a dark and imposing figure against the night sky.\n\nHe gazed intently at the motley group assembled before him, each one an outcast in their own right, drawn together by necessity rather than choice. Malric's eyes glinted with a fervor that bordered on madness, a zeal that had driven him to this desperate hour.\n\n\"Behold,\" he intoned, his voice a gravelly echo that seemed to resonate through the stones themselves. \"You stand on the brink of destiny, chosen by fate to cleanse this land of the blasphemer who sits upon the throne.\"\n\nThe group exchanged wary glances, their expressions a mixture of skepticism and resignation. Each had their reasons for being here, though none truly believed in Malric's cause. Yet, the promise of freedom, gold, or revenge had been too tempting to resist.\n\nAt the forefront stood Elara, a lithe and agile thief with quicksilver eyes that darted nervously around the courtyard. Her deft fingers had lifted many a purse in the shadowed alleys of the city, but tonight they itched with uncertainty. She had agreed to join Malric's crusade in exchange for a clean slate, a chance to leave her life of crime behind. Yet, as she listened to his fervent speech, she couldn't shake the feeling that she had traded one set of chains for another.\n\nBeside her, Brogan shifted uneasily, his massive frame casting a formidable shadow. The blacksmith-turned-mercenary had once been a hero in his village, until a tragic accident had left him shunned and outcast. His thick arms, scarred from years of labor, bore the weight of his imposing warhammer, and his eyes held a sadness that spoke of battles lost both on and off the field. Malric had promised him redemption, a chance to reclaim his honor, but Brogan couldn't ignore the nagging doubt gnawing at his conscience.\n\nIn the back, partially hidden by the gloom, stood Seraphine, a healer whose talents had been both a blessing and a curse. Her ethereal beauty and delicate hands masked a fierce determination that had seen her through countless hardships. Branded a witch by those who feared her power, she had wandered the land in search of acceptance. Malric had approached her with promises of a new beginning, yet his fanaticism made her question the true cost of such a gift.\n\nFinally, there was Kade, a rogue mage with a sardonic smile and a past shrouded in mystery. His dark robes billowed around him like smoke, and his eyes gleamed with a dangerous intelligence. Kade had joined the group not out of loyalty or belief, but for the sheer thrill of the challenge. The magical ward that protected the ruler's stronghold was a puzzle he couldn't resist, and the potential to unlock its secrets was a temptation too great to ignore.\n\nMalric's voice broke through their thoughts, his eyes blazing with conviction. \"Together, we shall breach the ward and topple the tyrant who defiles our sacred land. Each of you brings a unique gift, a strength that will be vital to our success. Remember, our cause is just, and the gods themselves favor our quest.\"\n\nWith that, he turned and strode towards the keep's entrance, his cloak billowing behind him like a dark omen. The group followed, their footsteps echoing off the stone walls as they descended into the bowels of the fortress.\n\nThe air grew colder and more oppressive as they ventured deeper, the flickering torchlight casting eerie shadows on the damp walls. The silence was punctuated only by the distant drip of water and the occasional scuffle of unseen creatures. Each step seemed to draw them closer to an unknown fate, and the weight of their mission pressed heavily upon their shoulders.\n\nAs they reached the heart of the keep, they found themselves standing before a massive iron door, its surface etched with intricate runes that pulsed with a faint, otherworldly light. The magical ward, a barrier that had kept countless enemies at bay, now loomed before them as both a challenge and a promise.\n\nKade stepped forward, his eyes alight with curiosity and determination. He ran his fingers over the runes, muttering incantations under his breath as he sought to unravel the ward's secrets. The others watched in tense silence, their fates hanging in the balance.\n\nMinutes stretched into hours as Kade worked, his brow furrowed in concentration. Sweat dripped from his forehead, mingling with the dust and grime that clung to his robes. Finally, with a triumphant shout, he stepped back, the runes flickering and then fading into darkness.\n\n\"The ward is broken,\" he declared, his voice tinged with both relief and exhilaration. \"The path is clear.\"\n\nLord Malric's eyes gleamed with a fanatical light as he stepped forward, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword. \"Onward, then,\" he commanded. \"We shall cleanse this land of its corruption and restore its rightful order.\"\n\nAs they pushed open the iron door and stepped into the unknown, each member of the group couldn't help but feel a sense of foreboding. The journey ahead would test not only their skills but their very souls. And as the line between righteousness and tyranny began to blur, they would soon discover that the true battle lay not against the blasphemer, but within themselves.",
        "story_b": "The fortress of Lord Edris stood like a monolith against the evening sky, its towering spires clawing at the heavens. It was a bastion of stone and steel, a testament to the lord's relentless ambition and unyielding faith. Within its walls, a magical ward encircled the keep\u2014a shimmering barrier of translucent energy that pulsed with ancient power. It hummed with the whispers of forgotten incantations, etched into its surface in a lattice of intricate runes that shimmered in the waning light. This was the domain of Lord Edris, a realm where zealotry and vision coalesced into a singular purpose.\n\nIn the heart of this stronghold, the council chamber was a place of grandeur and authority. Opulent tapestries adorned the walls, depicting conquests long past. A grand table, carved from a single piece of enchanted wood, dominated the room, its surface polished to a mirror-like sheen. Around it gathered a motley crew of outcasts, each drawn here by promises of redemption, vengeance, or perhaps something less definable.\n\nLord Edris rose from his seat, his voice a clarion call, filled with fervor and conviction. \u201cThe time has come to rid this world of the blasphemous ruler who defiles our sacred lands. The magical ward is our final obstacle; its breach will herald a new era.\u201d\n\nYet, even as he spoke, a tremor shook the chamber, a disturbance in the ward's energy that sent ripples through the barrier. It was a sign, an omen of instability that could no longer be ignored. Urgency gripped the air, and the outcasts exchanged wary glances. Their mission, once a distant promise, now demanded immediate action.\n\nAmong them was Lirael, a rogue with nimble fingers and a sharper wit. She stood apart, her eyes flitting from face to face, gauging the resolve of her newfound companions. Beside her, Torin, a stoic warrior, checked the edge of his blade with methodical precision. His silence spoke volumes of his determination, yet his eyes betrayed a flicker of doubt.\n\nElara, a mage with a penchant for strategic insight, studied the ward's fluctuating energy patterns. Her fingers traced invisible lines in the air, reading the currents with a precision that bordered on the scientific. \u201cThe ward's instability is both a boon and a curse,\u201d she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. \u201cIt offers us a chance, but also a danger.\u201d\n\nTheir journey began under the cover of night, the forest a labyrinth of shadows and secrets. The path was fraught with hidden perils, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and the rustle of unseen creatures. Each step brought them closer to their goal, yet also deeper into the heart of uncertainty.\n\nAs they traveled, the outcasts found themselves grappling with the complexity of their mission. Lord Edris's vision, once a beacon of righteousness, began to reveal its darker facets. His rhetoric, so compelling in the safety of the council chamber, now seemed tinged with fanaticism.\n\nLirael, ever questioning, broached the topic as they paused to rest. \u201cWhat if we\u2019re just trading one tyrant for another?\u201d Her words hung in the air, heavy with implication.\n\nTorin, though usually reticent, nodded in agreement. \u201cPower corrupts. We must be wary of becoming the very thing we seek to destroy.\u201d\n\nElara\u2019s gaze was distant, her thoughts a swirl of conflicting loyalties. She had seen firsthand the devastation wrought by unchecked power, yet she also understood the necessity of their mission. \u201cThe line between righteousness and tyranny is thin indeed,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut we must trust in our purpose and hold fast to our own convictions.\u201d\n\nTheir resolve was tested as they neared the ward, its energy a palpable force that set the air to crackling. The runes glowed fiercely, and the outcasts braced themselves for the task ahead. Elara stepped forward, her hands weaving a complex spell designed to unravel the ward\u2019s defenses. Lirael and Torin stood ready, each poised to act at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nThe breach, when it came, was a moment of both triumph and trepidation. The ward shimmered, its energy fracturing into a kaleidoscope of colors before collapsing inward. The path lay open before them, yet uncertainty loomed large.\n\nAt the threshold of the ruler\u2019s domain, the outcasts paused. The air was charged with potential, a crossroads of destiny. They stood united, yet each was acutely aware of the personal stakes involved. Their journey had revealed much about the nature of power and the perilous balance between right and wrong.\n\nAs they prepared to confront the ruler, the outcasts knew that their mission was far from over. The true test lay ahead, in the choices they would make and the principles they would uphold. The path of righteousness was fraught with peril, but it was theirs to navigate.\n\nIn the stillness of that moment, the echoes of the past and the promise of the future converged. The outcasts breathed as one, stepping into the unknown with hearts steeled against the uncertainty that lay ahead. The story of their journey was yet unwritten, its outcome as elusive as the shimmering remnants of the ward they had breached.",

        "story_b": "The dimly lit chamber echoed with a nervous energy as the outcasts gathered, their eyes shifting warily between one another and the imposing figure at the center. Lord Elian, his presence as commanding as the crimson cloak he wore, stood before them with a fervor that bordered on the maniacal. His voice boomed through the cavernous hall, weaving tales of betrayal and sacrilege committed by the ruler they were to dethrone. \n\n\u201cThe time has come,\u201d Elian proclaimed, his eyes blazing with conviction. \u201cThe blasphemer\u2019s reign must end, and you\u2014each chosen for your unparalleled talents\u2014are the instruments of justice.\u201d\n\nYet, the outcasts shifted uncomfortably, their skepticism palpable. They were a motley assembly\u2014an elven mage with secrets more ancient than the stones beneath them, a rogue skilled in the shadows, a healer with a haunted past, and a warrior whose scars told stories of battles lost and won. Each bore their own burdens, their own reasons for joining this perilous quest, though few could match Elian\u2019s fanaticism.\n\nThe journey began with the lord\u2019s promises still ringing in their ears, but as they traveled through lands scarred by conflict, doubt crept in like a silent specter. The magical ward that guarded the ruler\u2019s domain was a thing of legend, its shimmering surface a veil of liquid starlight, whispering secrets of forgotten realms. It loomed ahead, a barrier both beautiful and forbidding.\n\nAs they approached, the ward seemed to pulse with a life of its own, testing their resolve. The mage, Rhiannon, stepped forward, her fingers dancing in intricate patterns as she murmured incantations. The ward responded, its surface rippling like disturbed water, reflecting their innermost fears. It was a sentient barrier, one that demanded not just magical skill but a confrontation with their own truths.\n\nThe rogue, Kael, was the first to falter, his reflection showing a life of betrayal and mistrust. \u201cThis isn\u2019t right,\u201d he muttered, stepping back. But Elian\u2019s voice cut through the hesitation like a blade. \u201cWe are on the side of righteousness, Kael. Do not waver now.\u201d\n\nYet as the ward\u2019s challenges persisted, the group\u2019s unity began to fracture. Each outcast faced visions that tested their loyalty not just to the mission, but to each other. The healer, Mira, saw echoes of the lives she failed to save, the warrior, Bran, relived the horrors of past battles. Their faith in the lord\u2019s mission wavered, the certainty of their path clouded by doubt.\n\nAmidst these trials, Elian\u2019s true nature began to surface. His obsession with overthrowing the ruler seemed less about justice and more about personal vendetta. The outcasts whispered among themselves, questioning whether they were merely pawns in a game of power and revenge. The lord\u2019s charisma, once a beacon of purpose, now felt like the chains binding them to a quest that was not their own.\n\nDespite the growing unease, they pressed on, driven by a mixture of fear and the hope that perhaps, beyond the ward, they would find the truth. The final confrontation came in the shadow of the ruler\u2019s fortress, where the outcasts stood poised to fulfill their mission. But as they prepared to breach the gates, a moment of clarity struck them\u2014a realization that their actions mirrored the very tyranny they sought to overthrow.\n\nElian\u2019s eyes gleamed with the madness of ambition. \u201cThis is our moment!\u201d he shouted, urging them forward. Yet, it was Rhiannon who spoke, her voice soft yet resolute. \u201cWhat if the tyrant is not the one we seek to dethrone, but the one who leads us?\u201d\n\nHer words hung in the air, a challenge that forced each outcast to confront the duality of their mission. The mirrors of the ward had shown them their fears and failures, but also the potential for redemption and choice. In that moment, they understood that the line between righteousness and tyranny was not as clear as the lord\u2019s impassioned speeches had made it seem.\n\nIn the end, they turned not against the ruler, but against the fanaticism that had driven them to this brink. The ambiguity of their resolution left questions unanswered, a testament to the complexity of their journey. As they walked away from the fortress, the echoes of their actions lingered\u2014a reminder that in the battle between light and shadow, it is not always clear where one ends and the other begins.\n\nThe outcasts dispersed, each returning to their own paths, forever changed by the choices they had made.

        "ground_truth": "Pantheons Call was thoroughly routed. Emant Harrown, Lord Elect of the religious order, sat tall on his horse outside the gates of Yistria. Behind him were the remnants of the small army he had commanded in the city. Had he but known the declaration Jaharet would make, he would have mustered the entirety of Pantheons Call. But she had taken him by surprisehe and the rest of Danthes. She had exposed herself in that moment for the charlatan she was, an impure soul muddying the holy mantle of leadership she had been gifted. And he and his followers had reacted in the only way they couldthey had attempted to capture the Blasphemer and force her to Ascend. Theyd almost had her. But Jaharet too had followers, men and women devoted to her in a manner that was almost fanatical. Her Empyrean Guard and the sentinels of the Sanctum had joined together to protect her.Theyd bought her precious time so that she and those closest to her could flee to the Sanctum, the holiest of temples located deep in the heart of the city. And from within the Sanctum, some of her protectorsthose clerics and priests and mages that had sided with herhad come together to create a magical ward that no sword or magic at Harrowns disposal could breach. She was impervious now, safe in her cocoon of sorcery. But not for long. The small force Harrown commanded had surrounded the Sanctum. There they would have remained until the whole of Pantheons Call had come to aid them, if it had not been for the unforeseen. Jaharets alliances ran deep and spread far. Not even a day after her announcement was made, a large rebel faction from Morialor had marched into the city. Formidable though Harrown and his men were in battle, they were outnumbered greatly when this rebel group banded together with those loyal to the Empyrean. It was to her credit, Harrown mused now as he stared at the city denied to him, that Jaharet did not order he and his men slain. It was also going to be something she would come to regret most intensely. She had allowed them to fall back and regroup outside the gates. And then she had ordered that all city gates be closed and all its walls manned. The Lord Elect suddenly wheeled his horse around. The beast, a magnificent destrier, snorted as it turned on its haunches. Before him were the remnants of the men hed commanded in the city, all of them looking equally as grim as their leader, all of them sporting the emblem of the Five Eyes somewhere on their clothing, weapons, or shields. Have the men been sent? Harrown asked one of his commanders as he rode past. The commander heeled his horse forward so that it kept pace with the Lord Elects mount. They have, Lord. Harrown mused on this. When the magical aegis went up around the Sanctum, Harrown had known instinctively that breaching it would require some creative thinking. Hed sent word out of the city with swift messengers, instructing those in various outposts throughout the country to scry for certain individuals who were in possession of particular skills. These skills, when brought together and put to use in tandem, would ultimately be the way the ward would fall. And so men had been dispatched, armed and capable, to retrieve these individuals chosen. Harrown knew they would not all come willingly. No, some wouldl resist, which is why certain pressures had been applied to convince them that this task is in their best interests. Of course, some of them would be all too willing to lend their skills to this most righteous of crusades. As Harrown and his men rode away from Yistria, heading south, he carefully considered those that were chosen for this task the Vessanian clansmen that lived outside civilization, whose skills with a horse and bow would provide protection when violence inevitably happens the clever, impious merchant, whose connections and influence would be necessary to navigate through a nation turned hostile against those that would harm Jaharet the willful mage, a risky choice that was green in experience yet vast in untapped power, who would lend her skills to breaching the ward that protects the Empyrean Daughter and the messenger, whose knowledge of Danthes roads, paths, and secret ways would guide them all through a hostile landscape, whose lack of allegiances makes him perhaps the most trustworthy of the lot All of them would be escortedsome perhaps by forceto meet Lord Elect Harrown. And he would impart upon them the absolute necessity of what they must do. He would make certain they realize that they must not fail. Until then, however there were other matters he must attend to. And so it was that he and his men left the Holy City and its untrue ruler behind. *** In other parts of Danthes, paths were altered. Harrowns men sought them out unerringly, their locations revealed through the scrying of Pantheon Calls own priests and mages. One by one they were made to understand that they had no choice in this, that they must obey. And one by one they left their homes, their families, the things that mattered to them to set out on these new blind paths.",
        "story_a": "The moon hung high and cold above the crumbling keep, its pale light casting long, jagged shadows across the courtyard. The once-majestic fortress now lay in ruins, a ghost of its former glory, with ivy creeping up its walls and the scent of damp earth filling the air. It was here, beneath the ancient stone archway, that Lord Malric stood, his silhouette a dark and imposing figure against the night sky.\n\nHe gazed intently at the motley group assembled before him, each one an outcast in their own right, drawn together by necessity rather than choice. Malric's eyes glinted with a fervor that bordered on madness, a zeal that had driven him to this desperate hour.\n\n\"Behold,\" he intoned, his voice a gravelly echo that seemed to resonate through the stones themselves. \"You stand on the brink of destiny, chosen by fate to cleanse this land of the blasphemer who sits upon the throne.\"\n\nThe group exchanged wary glances, their expressions a mixture of skepticism and resignation. Each had their reasons for being here, though none truly believed in Malric's cause. Yet, the promise of freedom, gold, or revenge had been too tempting to resist.\n\nAt the forefront stood Elara, a lithe and agile thief with quicksilver eyes that darted nervously around the courtyard. Her deft fingers had lifted many a purse in the shadowed alleys of the city, but tonight they itched with uncertainty. She had agreed to join Malric's crusade in exchange for a clean slate, a chance to leave her life of crime behind. Yet, as she listened to his fervent speech, she couldn't shake the feeling that she had traded one set of chains for another.\n\nBeside her, Brogan shifted uneasily, his massive frame casting a formidable shadow. The blacksmith-turned-mercenary had once been a hero in his village, until a tragic accident had left him shunned and outcast. His thick arms, scarred from years of labor, bore the weight of his imposing warhammer, and his eyes held a sadness that spoke of battles lost both on and off the field. Malric had promised him redemption, a chance to reclaim his honor, but Brogan couldn't ignore the nagging doubt gnawing at his conscience.\n\nIn the back, partially hidden by the gloom, stood Seraphine, a healer whose talents had been both a blessing and a curse. Her ethereal beauty and delicate hands masked a fierce determination that had seen her through countless hardships. Branded a witch by those who feared her power, she had wandered the land in search of acceptance. Malric had approached her with promises of a new beginning, yet his fanaticism made her question the true cost of such a gift.\n\nFinally, there was Kade, a rogue mage with a sardonic smile and a past shrouded in mystery. His dark robes billowed around him like smoke, and his eyes gleamed with a dangerous intelligence. Kade had joined the group not out of loyalty or belief, but for the sheer thrill of the challenge. The magical ward that protected the ruler's stronghold was a puzzle he couldn't resist, and the potential to unlock its secrets was a temptation too great to ignore.\n\nMalric's voice broke through their thoughts, his eyes blazing with conviction. \"Together, we shall breach the ward and topple the tyrant who defiles our sacred land. Each of you brings a unique gift, a strength that will be vital to our success. Remember, our cause is just, and the gods themselves favor our quest.\"\n\nWith that, he turned and strode towards the keep's entrance, his cloak billowing behind him like a dark omen. The group followed, their footsteps echoing off the stone walls as they descended into the bowels of the fortress.\n\nThe air grew colder and more oppressive as they ventured deeper, the flickering torchlight casting eerie shadows on the damp walls. The silence was punctuated only by the distant drip of water and the occasional scuffle of unseen creatures. Each step seemed to draw them closer to an unknown fate, and the weight of their mission pressed heavily upon their shoulders.\n\nAs they reached the heart of the keep, they found themselves standing before a massive iron door, its surface etched with intricate runes that pulsed with a faint, otherworldly light. The magical ward, a barrier that had kept countless enemies at bay, now loomed before them as both a challenge and a promise.\n\nKade stepped forward, his eyes alight with curiosity and determination. He ran his fingers over the runes, muttering incantations under his breath as he sought to unravel the ward's secrets. The others watched in tense silence, their fates hanging in the balance.\n\nMinutes stretched into hours as Kade worked, his brow furrowed in concentration. Sweat dripped from his forehead, mingling with the dust and grime that clung to his robes. Finally, with a triumphant shout, he stepped back, the runes flickering and then fading into darkness.\n\n\"The ward is broken,\" he declared, his voice tinged with both relief and exhilaration. \"The path is clear.\"\n\nLord Malric's eyes gleamed with a fanatical light as he stepped forward, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword. \"Onward, then,\" he commanded. \"We shall cleanse this land of its corruption and restore its rightful order.\"\n\nAs they pushed open the iron door and stepped into the unknown, each member of the group couldn't help but feel a sense of foreboding. The journey ahead would test not only their skills but their very souls. And as the line between righteousness and tyranny began to blur, they would soon discover that the true battle lay not against the blasphemer, but within themselves.",
        "story_b": "The path twisted through the forest like a serpent, each curve revealing new shadows that clawed at the sky with bony fingers. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth, mingling with an undercurrent of magic that made the hairs on their arms stand on end. The outcasts moved in a loose formation, each step bringing them closer to the shimmering barrier of light ahead\u2014a magical ward, pulsing with an ominous hum, its surface rippling like disturbed water.\n\nThe lord, a gaunt figure with eyes that blazed with fervor, led the group. His voice, sharp and commanding, cut through the stillness. \"Remember, the ward is no mere obstacle. It is an ancient sentinel, its magic woven with the whispers of forgotten spells. It watches us with an unblinking eye.\"\n\nBeside him, a warrior with a scarred face and stoic demeanor grunted in response, his hand resting on the hilt of a well-worn sword. \"And here I thought we were just taking a stroll,\" he muttered, his voice laced with dry humor that did little to mask his unease.\n\nTrailing slightly behind, a thief with nimble fingers and a quicksilver grin regarded the ward with a glint of professional interest. \"Just another lock to pick,\" he said, though his eyes betrayed a flicker of doubt. \"Albeit one with a mind of its own.\"\n\nThe mage, a woman with eyes that seemed to hold the stars themselves, studied the ward with cautious curiosity. Her fingers traced patterns in the air, sensing the arcane energy that crackled around them like a lattice of light and shadow. \"It's alive,\" she murmured, half to herself. \"Like a dragon of legend, its secrets coiled tight within.\"\n\nTheir journey had not been an easy one. The path had been fraught with dangers, both seen and unseen. Yet it was the social dynamics among them that proved the most treacherous. Each outcast bore their own scars\u2014some visible, some etched into the soul. Trust was a currency they could ill afford, yet one they found themselves spending more with each passing day.\n\nAs they neared the ward, the lord turned to address them, his voice a clarion call in the oppressive silence. \"The ruler we seek to overthrow is a blasphemer, a defiler of sacred truths. We are the instruments of divine justice, the harbingers of a new order.\"\n\nThe mage's eyes narrowed, her skepticism plain. \"And if this new order mirrors the old? If tyranny merely changes its face?\"\n\nThe lord's gaze hardened, his fanaticism a palpable force. \"Doubt is a luxury we cannot indulge. The righteousness of our cause is unquestionable.\"\n\nThe tension between them was a living thing, a silent testament to the fragile alliance they had formed. Each had their reasons for embarking on this perilous mission\u2014reasons that were as varied as they were personal. For the warrior, it was a chance at redemption, a way to atone for past sins. The thief sought freedom, a clean slate unburdened by the weight of his crimes. The mage yearned for knowledge, the forbidden kind that danced just out of reach.\n\nAs they stood before the ward, its surface crackling with arcane energy, the line between righteousness and tyranny seemed to blur like a mirage on a summer's day. The lord's conviction was a beacon, but it cast long shadows that stretched into the unknown.\n\nThe forest around them was silent, save for the rustle of leaves underfoot. The air was electric, charged with anticipation. The lord stepped forward, raising a hand to the ward. \"This is it,\" he declared, his voice resonating with unshakable belief. \"The moment we fulfill our destiny.\"\n\nThe mage exchanged a glance with the warrior, her expression a mixture of resolve and trepidation. \"Let's hope destiny knows what it's doing,\" she quipped, her tone light but her meaning heavy.\n\nThe thief chuckled, a sound that held more nerves than mirth. \"This whole mission's a bloody mess, but what else is new?\"\n\nWith a collective breath, they moved as one, each bringing their unique skills to bear against the ward. The warrior's blade sang as it cut through the air, the thief's hands danced over the ward's surface, and the mage's incantations wove through the ether like threads of starlight.\n\nThe ward resisted, its defenses formidable and relentless. Yet the outcasts pressed on, driven by the disparate hopes that bound them together. Slowly, inexorably, the ward began to yield, its light flickering like a candle in the wind.\n\nAs the barrier finally shattered, a cascade of energy washed over them, leaving them breathless and exhilarated. Beyond lay the ruler's domain\u2014a fortress of black stone, its towers piercing the sky like daggers, surrounded by a moat of swirling mist.\n\nThe lord's eyes gleamed with triumph, but the outcasts found their victory tinged with uncertainty. The path ahead was uncharted, fraught with peril and possibility. Together, they stepped into the unknown, their hearts a curious mix of hope and dread.\n\nIn that moment, they understood that the journey was far from over. The true battle lay within, where the line between righteousness and tyranny was not a boundary but a threshold\u2014one they must each cross in their own way.",

Admission is Free for All!**\n\nCarl hammered the sign down on the cracking concrete in front of the rusted, disused warehouse and stared at his partner Ralph. \"Bro, you sure this is going to lure in that pesky detective who keeps foiling Boss Bernando's plans?\"\n\n\"Carl, you dumbass!\" Ralph slapped him on the back of his head with a goat plush toy. \"Didn't boss make it clear? We're kidnapping the loved one of Detective Watson as bait. She wouldn't fall for such an elementary trick. But her dorky boyfriend will.\"\n\n\"Right, right. So, what do we know about Katrina Watson's boyfriend?\"\n\n\"He's obsessed with tea and cakes, and goats,\" Ralph read his briefing notes. \"We're serving chamomile tea, strawberry cheesecakes and he can go pet some goats at the back of this warehouse.\"\n\n\"What does he look like?\"\n\n\"Some goth LARPer who dresses like a necromancer in black robes. Pale, white-haired guy.\"\n\n\"That one?\" Carl pointed to the strange man sauntering towards them on...tentacles? Those have got to be some fake animatronic, right?\n\nRalph nodded, \"That one.\"\n\n\"Greetings humans!\" Their target waved at them with a cheery grin. \"Ah, the Tinseltown's Tea Party! Boy, am I glad to have free flow of tea and cakes! Where do I register?\"\n\n\"The guestbook's right here,\" Ralph presented to him the book he purchased from Poppa's Art and Craft shop just twenty minutes ago. \"Sign here.\"\n\n*Lord Elvari was here! :D*\n\n*Who doesn't love tea parties! :P*\n\n\"There! I've signed it. Let's get down to the party, shall we?\" He rubbed his hands, and those oddly realistic tentacles together. \"You can't have free lunches all the time, but I'm sure am glad free tea parties exist!\"\n\nCarl kept his head down and his mouth shut while Ralph led their gullible and eager target inside. The cheap plastic utensils, scrappy tablecloth they bought off a second-hand goods store, and the paltry Christmas decorations they salvaged from an impoverished orphanage, would that dork really buy it? About the only thing that costed more than pocket change was the exquisite porcelain teapot and silver serving platter for the cake. That's the most important things, Ralph said. The things that their target would focus on. And the tea, of course.\n\n\"You sure do have many armed guards for a simple tea party,\" Elvari scanned the sparsely decorated warehouse and pointed towards the gang members standing by armed and ready.\n\n\"Yea, we want to ensure our VIP party guest is secure in our premises,\" Ralph said. \"That'll be you, our honored guest.\"\n\n\"Why, thank you. How very considerate of you.\"\n\n\"Only the best for our guest,\" Ralph forced a smile on his face and gestured his kidnapping target towards the sole table and chair in the area. \"Would you like to take a seat and enjoy what we have to offer?\"\n\nThe weirdo in black robes plopped himself down on the chair and poured himself some tea. No sooner than he aimed his fork towards the cheesecake, the warehouse door slammed open.\n\n\"Freeze!\" Detective Katrina Watson shouted as she aimed her gun towards Ralph. \"You're under arrest for kidnapping...Elvari?\"\n\n\"Kidnapping?\" He sounded displeased. \"I was told this was a tea party!\"\n\n\"It's a kidnapping,\" Carl pressed the muzzle of his gun against Elvari's head. \"Detective, take a step closer and I'll blow his brains out.\"\n\n\"Which brain?\" Elvari asked in the puzzled tone. \"I have nine of these squiggly organs you call brains.\"\n\n\"Oh god Elvari, this is not the time for jokes!\" Kat bemoaned. \"Not when you're the target of a kidnapping attempt.\"\n\n\"But I do actually have nine brains in total...\" he pouted and tented his tentacles. \"I know...they've been accused of sharing one same braincell at times, but they're still nine separate brains.\"\n\n\"Boys, I'd advise you put your guns down,\" Kat spoke to the armed gangsters surrounding them. \"You have picked literally the worst target to kidnap to impede my investigations. Not because he's a big dork who thinks there could be a real tea party in an abandoned warehouse. Because he's an actual eldritch deity who could shatter your minds and have you pissing in your diapers in a psychiatric ward for life.\"\n\nThe men backed away with their guns down. A few ran out the door and never looked back. Ralph kept his gun on Kat, while Carl \u2014\n\n*Bang!*\n\nBlood trickled down from the side of Elvari's head. He sat still, eyes wide open, before blinking.\n\n\"That wasn't very nice of you,\" he frowned while his tentacles hissed angrily. \"I was suspicious of the abandoned warehouse setup, but the tea was just too good, so I thought I should be a gracious guest and play along. But playtime's over.\"\n\nA tentacle coiled around Carl's hand to twist it until audible cracking sounds echoed across the room, alongside the gangster's screams. His gun fell to the floor, as did his knees crashed down onto the concrete. Ralph let out gurgling noises when a tentacle throttled his throat. Both unable to protest while tentacles slapped them repeatedly in their faces. Elvari continued to sip his tea and stuffed his face with cake like it was a pleasant afternoon at his favourite cafe and totally not punishing two gangsters for a failed kidnapping attempt at an old warehouse.\n\n\"Elvari? You can stop now,\" Kat squeezed his shoulder. \"I've notified Officer Jenkins to come by and make an arrest, so please leave those two to be recognizable by other scam victims at a line-up, okay?",
        "story_a": "I should've known something was off the moment I stepped into the neighborhood. The air was thick with the scent of blooming roses and freshly cut grass, an odd juxtaposition to the task at hand. My target was a high-profile scientist who had crossed the wrong people, and my mission was to kidnap his loved one as leverage. Simple, right? Except, nothing about this felt simple.\n\nI approached the house, a quaint two-story with ivy creeping up the brick exterior. The intel said she\u2019d be alone\u2014his wife, a schoolteacher with a penchant for gardening. Easy pickings. I jimmied the lock on the back door, the click of the mechanism echoing in the silent kitchen. My heart pounded in my chest, but I dismissed it as the usual pre-job jitters.\n\nThe kitchen was immaculate, almost sterile in its cleanliness. A bowl of apples sat on the counter, and I noticed the faint aroma of freshly baked bread lingering in the air. It was the kind of place that screamed \"normalcy,\" but there was something else, an underlying tension that set my instincts on edge.\n\nI crept through the house, careful to avoid the creaky floorboards. The living room was tastefully decorated, with family photos lining the walls. There she was, sitting on a plush armchair, reading a book. Her long, auburn hair cascaded over her shoulders, and she looked up, locking eyes with me.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" she asked, her voice calm and measured. No hint of fear, no surprise. Just... calm.\n\n\"Mrs. Thompson,\" I said, trying to sound authoritative. \"I need you to come with me.\"\n\nShe closed her book and placed it on the side table, standing up with an elegance that seemed almost rehearsed. \"Is that so?\" she replied, a small smile playing on her lips. \"And what if I say no?\"\n\nI pulled out my gun, leveling it at her. \"Then things get messy.\"\n\nHer smile widened, and for the first time, I felt a chill run down my spine. \"You really should have done your homework,\" she said, and before I could react, she moved.\n\nOne moment she was standing there, and the next, she was a blur of motion. My gun was knocked from my hand, and I found myself on the floor, gasping for breath. Her knee was pressed against my chest, and her eyes bore into mine with an intensity that made my blood run cold.\n\n\"Who sent you?\" she demanded, her voice now a dangerous whisper.\n\nI struggled to breathe, my mind racing. This wasn't supposed to happen. She was supposed to be easy, a means to an end. But now, with her hand gripping my throat, I realized I was the one in over my head.\n\n\"Talk!\" she snapped, tightening her grip.\n\n\"V-Veritas,\" I choked out, the word barely escaping my lips. \"They want your husband.\"\n\nHer eyes narrowed, and she released her hold, allowing me to gasp for air. \"Of course they do,\" she muttered, almost to herself. \"Fools.\"\n\nShe stood up, giving me a chance to scramble to my feet. I rubbed my throat, my mind racing with thoughts of escape, but something about her presence kept me rooted to the spot.\n\n\"What's your name?\" she asked, her tone softer now, almost gentle.\n\n\"Marcus,\" I replied, still wary.\n\n\"Well, Marcus,\" she said, picking up the book she had been reading. \"It seems you've found yourself in quite the predicament. You see, Veritas didn't just send you to kidnap a schoolteacher. They sent you to kidnap me\u2014an operative they thought was long retired.\"\n\nHer words hung in the air, and my mind struggled to process the implications. She was one of them? A former operative? No wonder she had taken me down so easily.\n\n\"They didn't tell you, did they?\" she continued, shaking her head. \"Typical. They always underestimate the people they cast aside.\"\n\nI took a step back, my instincts screaming at me to run, but she held up a hand. \"Wait. I'm not going to hurt you.\"\n\n\"Why should I believe you?\" I asked, my voice trembling.\n\n\"Because you and I, we're pawns in a game much larger than ourselves,\" she said, her eyes softening. \"And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that pawns can change the course of the game.\"\n\nShe walked over to the window, peering out into the night. \"You have a choice, Marcus. You can leave now, go back to Veritas, and tell them you failed. Or,\" she turned to face me, \"you can help me take them down.\"\n\nI hesitated, the weight of her words settling over me. She was offering me a chance to flip the script, to turn the tables on those who had sent me here. It was dangerous, reckless even, but something in her eyes told me she was serious.\n\n\"What do you need me to do?\" I asked, the decision made.\n\nHer smile returned, this time warm and genuine. \"First, we're going to pay my husband a visit. He's been working on something that might just give us the upper hand.\"\n\nAs we left the house together, I couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation. The game was changing, and for the first time, I wasn't just a pawn. I was a player.",

Desperation breeds creativity, or so he told himself. The address led him to an old mansion, the kind that seemed to breathe its own history. Every corner of the place whispered secrets.\n\n\u201cAlright, let's get this over with,\u201d Derek muttered, adjusting the mask on his face. \u201cThis can't be any harder than that time in Madrid.\u201d\n\nHe slipped in through an unlocked window\u2014an open invitation, really. The mansion was eerily quiet, save for the occasional creak of wood. As he moved through the dimly lit corridors, he couldn't shake the feeling of being watched.\n\nDerek found her in a room at the far end of the hallway. She was seated in a large, ornate chair, seemingly engrossed in a book. She looked up, eyes like deep pools of midnight. Young, no older than twenty, with a frail appearance that belied the danger he was warned about.\n\n\u201cShe can't be that dangerous,\u201d Derek thought, a smirk tugging at his lips. \u201cShe looks like she couldn't hurt a fly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHello there,\u201d he said, attempting to sound intimidating. \u201cYou're coming with me.\u201d\n\nShe closed her book gently, placing it on a small table beside her. \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d Her voice was soft, almost musical, but it carried an undertone that made Derek's skin crawl.\n\n\u201cYeah, you're coming with me to make your boyfriend talk,\u201d Derek said, pulling out a pair of handcuffs. \u201cNow, let's make this easy.\u201d\n\nHer laugh was light, almost innocent. \u201cBoyfriend? Is that what you think?\u201d She stood up, and Derek was taken aback by how gracefully she moved. \u201cI think you might be mistaken about a few things.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust\u2014just turn around,\u201d Derek stammered, waving the handcuffs. \u201cNo funny business.\u201d\n\nThe next moment happened in a blur. One second she was standing there, the next, Derek was flying across the room, crashing into an antique cabinet. The air crackled with an energy that made his hair stand on end.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Derek groaned, struggling to his feet. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d\n\nShe walked over to him, her steps soundless on the wooden floor. \u201cYou poor thing. You have no idea what you\u2019ve walked into, do you?\u201d She extended a hand, and Derek felt an invisible force lifting him off the ground.\n\n\u201cLet me go!\u201d Derek shouted, writhing in mid-air.\n\n\u201cYou should have done your homework,\u201d she said, her eyes glowing with an eerie light. Shadows around the room seemed to dance and twist, moving to some unseen rhythm. \u201cI\u2019m not some damsel in distress. I\u2019m the one they tell stories about to keep you up at night.\u201d\n\nDerek\u2019s mind raced.

I just wanted the money.\u201d\n\nShe seemed to consider this for a moment. \u201cMoney, is it? And what will you do with that money?\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out,\u201d Derek said quickly. \u201cStart over. Leave this life behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cInteresting.\u201d She released her hold, and Derek dropped to the floor with a thud. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first to come after me, you know. But you might be the first with a shred of honesty.\u201d\n\nDerek rubbed his sore limbs, trying to process what was happening. \u201cSo\u2026 what now?\u201d\n\nShe smiled, a disconcerting blend of warmth and menace. \u201cNow, we talk. You see, my beloved isn\u2019t what you think. He\u2019s part of something much larger, something darker. And you, my dear kidnapper, might just be the key to turning the tide.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Derek asked, genuinely confused.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a war coming,\u201d she said, her eyes distant, as if seeing something far away. \u201cA war between those who want to control, and those who want to be free. My beloved is on the wrong side, and so was I, once. But you, you could help us.\u201d\n\n\u201cHelp you?\u201d Derek echoed, incredulous. \u201cYou just tossed me across the room like a rag doll.\u201d\n\nShe laughed again, a sound that sent chills down his spine. \u201cYes, I did. And I could do much worse. But I see potential in you. You\u2019re desperate enough to change, to do what\u2019s necessary.\u201d\n\nDerek took a deep breath. \u201cAlright, say I believe you. What\u2019s the plan?\u201d\n\nShe extended her hand again, this time in a gesture of alliance. \u201cWe start by taking down the ones who sent you. They\u2019re the real danger here.\u201d\n\nDerek hesitated, then took her hand. \u201cOkay. But if this goes south, I\u2019m blaming you.\u201d\n\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d she said, a mischievous glint in her eye. \u201cLet\u2019s get to work.\u201d\n\nAs they left the mansion together, Derek couldn\u2019t help but wonder what he had gotten himself into. One thing was certain: his life was never going to be the same.",

No sooner than he aimed his fork towards the cheesecake, the warehouse door slammed open.\n\n\"Freeze!\" Detective Katrina Watson shouted as she aimed her gun towards Ralph. \"You're under arrest for kidnapping...Elvari?\"\n\n\"Kidnapping?\" He sounded displeased. \"I was told this was a tea party!\"\n\n\"It's a kidnapping,\" Carl pressed the muzzle of his gun against Elvari's head. \"Detective, take a step closer and I'll blow his brains out.\"\n\n\"Which brain?\" Elvari asked in the puzzled tone. \"I have nine of these squiggly organs you call brains.\"\n\n\"Oh god Elvari, this is not the time for jokes!\" Kat bemoaned. \"Not when you're the target of a kidnapping attempt.\"\n\n\"But I do actually have nine brains in total...\" he pouted and tented his tentacles. \"I know...they've been accused of sharing one same braincell at times, but they're still nine separate brains.\"\n\n\"Boys, I'd advise you put your guns down,\" Kat spoke to the armed gangsters surrounding them. \"You have picked literally the worst target to kidnap to impede my investigations.

The living room was tastefully decorated, with family photos lining the walls. There she was, sitting on a plush armchair, reading a book.

My gun was knocked from my hand, and I found myself on the floor, gasping for breath.

I rubbed my throat, my mind racing with thoughts of escape, but something about her presence kept me rooted to the spot.\n\n\"What's your name?\" she asked, her tone softer now, almost gentle.\n\n\"Marcus,\" I replied, still wary.\n\n\"Well, Marcus,\" she said, picking up the book she had been reading. \"It seems you've found yourself in quite the predicament. You see, Veritas didn't just send you to kidnap a schoolteacher.

No wonder she had taken me down so easily.\n\n\"They didn't tell you, did they?\" she continued, shaking her head. \"Typical. They always underestimate the people they cast aside.\"\n\nI took a step back, my instincts screaming at me to run, but she held up a hand. \"Wait.

She was offering me a chance to flip the script, to turn the tables on those who had sent me here. It was dangerous, reckless even, but something in her eyes told me she was serious.\n\n\"What do you need me to do?\" I asked, the decision made.\n\nHer smile returned, this time warm and genuine. \"First, we're going to pay my husband a visit. He's been working on something that might just give us the upper hand.\"\n\nAs we left the house together, I couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation.

        "story_b": "The mission was supposed to be straightforward. Kidnap the loved one of the infamous sorcerer Alaric, use them as bait to lure him out, and then deliver him to the council. Easy enough, right? I'd handled tougher jobs. As I crept through the dimly lit corridors of the mansion, my confidence wavered only slightly. The target was supposed to be harmless\u2014a scholar, not a warrior. But as I approached their study, the flickering candlelight cast strange shadows that made my skin prickle with unease.\n\nI paused at the doorway, peering inside. The room was cluttered with scrolls and books, the air thick with the smell of parchment and ink. In the center sat a figure, their back to me, seemingly engrossed in a tome. My heart beat steadily as I stepped forward, a soft whisper of movement. Then, the figure turned, and I found myself staring into eyes that gleamed with a predatory awareness that sent a chill down my spine.\n\n\"You're not the first to try this,\" they said, their voice calm yet laced with amusement. \"And I doubt you'll be the last.\"\n\nI barely had time to react before the room seemed to come alive. Books flew from the shelves, their pages cutting through the air like blades. I ducked, narrowly avoiding a tome that whizzed past my ear. My instincts screamed at me to retreat, but my pride urged me forward. I was a professional, after all.\n\nThe scholar\u2014no, the warrior\u2014moved with a grace that belied their scholarly appearance. They flicked their wrist, and shadows pooled at their feet, rising up to obscure their form. I darted sideways, hoping to flank them, but the shadows followed, twisting and turning to keep me at bay.\n\n\"You thought this would be easy, didn't you?\" Their voice echoed around the room, disembodied, as if the very walls were speaking. \"Most people do.\"\n\nI didn't answer. Instead, I grabbed a nearby chair, using it as a makeshift shield against the relentless assault of flying books. The absurdity of the situation was not lost on me, and I couldn't help but chuckle. Outmatched by a librarian\u2014what a way to go.\n\nWith a sudden burst of inspiration, I swung the chair, scattering the books momentarily. I seized the opportunity to dive behind a desk, catching my breath. I needed a new plan. Clearly, I was dealing with someone far more formidable than anticipated.\n\nThe shadows danced around the room, and I knew I had to act fast. I rummaged through my pouch, fingers closing around a small vial of oil. With a quick flick of my wrist, I splashed it across the floor, igniting it with a spark from a flint.\n\nThe fire blazed to life, the light banishing the shadows to the corners of the room. For the first time, I saw the scholar fully\u2014their features sharp, eyes glinting with intelligence and something else, something dangerous.\n\nThey paused, assessing me with a curious tilt of their head. \"Clever,\" they admitted, the hint of a smile on their lips. \"But not clever enough.\"\n\nWith a flick of their hand, the flames sputtered out, leaving only smoke and the smell of charred wood. I cursed under my breath. This was not going to end well.\n\nIn that moment of quiet, I realized I had underestimated them entirely. They weren't just defending themselves; they were toying with me. I had to rethink my strategy, and fast.\n\nA sudden idea struck me. Maybe brute force wasn't the answer. Maybe... maybe I could talk my way out of this. It was a long shot, but better than the alternative.\n\n\"Look,\" I said, raising my hands in a gesture of peace. \"This isn't personal. It's just business.\"\n\nThey regarded me with a mixture of skepticism and curiosity, the shadows receding slightly. \"Business? Kidnapping is a poor business indeed.\"\n\nI shrugged, trying to appear nonchalant. \"True. But what if we could make it... mutually beneficial?\"\n\nThe scholar laughed, a sound both musical and dangerous. \"And what exactly do you propose?\"\n\n\"An alliance,\" I suggested, the words tumbling out before I could second-guess them. \"You help me take down Alaric, and in return, I make sure the council leaves you alone.\"\n\nTheir eyes narrowed, considering my offer. For a moment, the only sound was the crackle of the dying fire. Then, slowly, they nodded.\n\n\"Very well,\" they said, extending a hand. \"But betray me, and you'll find this encounter was the least of your worries.\"\n\nI took their hand, sealing our unexpected alliance. As we left the study, a new plan forming in my mind, I couldn't help but feel a grudging respect for my would-be target. They had been more than a match for me, and now, perhaps, they would be the ally I never knew I needed.\n\nIn the end, I realized, it wasn't about the mission. It was about the unexpected paths we take and the unlikely alliances we forge along the way.",

She twisted, and I found myself face down on the table, my arm pinned painfully behind my back. The caf\u00e9 patrons continued their conversations, oblivious to the sudden violence.\n\n\"You really should do your homework before attempting something like this,\" she whispered in my ear, her breath warm against my skin. \"Did you honestly think you could kidnap me?\"\n\nI struggled, trying to break free, but her grip was unyielding. \"Who are you?\" I gasped, the pain in my arm intensifying.\n\n\"Let's just say I'm not as helpless as I look,\" she replied, releasing me abruptly. I stumbled back, rubbing my wrist and glaring at her.\n\n\"Why didn't you just kill me?\" I spat, my pride wounded more than my body.\n\nShe shrugged, leaning back in her chair. \"Because I want to know who sent you and why.\"\n\nFrom the corner of my eye, I saw a shadow move\u2014The Specter, no doubt, lurking nearby and watching us. He must have known she was dangerous, but he didn't intervene. Why?\n\n\"Fine,\" I said, deciding to play along. \"I was sent to kidnap you to get to The Specter. Happy now?\"\n\nHer laughter was soft but chilling. \"Oh, you poor fool. Did you really think you could use me against him? We've been aware of your little plan from the start.\"\n\nMy heart sank. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nShe leaned forward, her eyes locking onto mine. \"I knew you were coming. I let you get close because I wanted to see if you were worth saving.\"\n\nMy confusion must have been evident because she continued, \"Everyone deserves a second chance, even kidnappers. So, here's the deal. You walk away from this, and we forget it ever happened. Or you can keep trying and face the consequences.\"\n\n\"You're giving me a choice?\" I asked, incredulous.\n\n\"Call it an act of mercy,\" she said, standing up and tossing a few bills on the table to cover her coffee. \"But don't mistake it for weakness.\"\n\nAs she walked away, I felt a strange mix of relief and frustration. She was letting me go, but why? I followed her out of the caf\u00e9, keeping a safe distance. She led me to a secluded alley where The Specter waited, his silhouette barely visible in the shadows.\n\n\"You've got guts, I'll give you that,\" he said, his voice low and menacing. \"But if you ever come near her again, I won't be so forgiving.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I asked, genuinely curious. \"Why not just kill me and be done with it?\"\n\nThe Specter stepped forward, his face still obscured. \"Because she believes in second chances, even for people like you. And for her sake, I'm willing to give you one.\"\n\nI looked at Lisa, who stood silently beside him, her expression unreadable. \"Why do you care?\" I asked her.\n\n\"Because everyone deserves a chance to change,\" she said simply. \"Even you.\"\n\nThe Specter placed a hand on her shoulder, a silent gesture of support. \"Now go,\" he commanded. \"Before I change my mind.\"\n\nI turned and walked away, my mind racing. They had seen through my plan from the start, yet they chose to let me live. It was a strange and humbling experience. As I left the alley, I couldn't help but wonder what kind of person could turn a kidnapping into a lesson on redemption.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, there was hope for me after all.",

        "story_b": "Sherlock Holmes stood in the dimly lit Haunted House, flickering lanterns casting eerie shadows across his face. The scent of candy floss mingled with the crisp autumn air, creating a peculiar ambiance. Beside him, John Watson adjusted his own ill-fitting jumper, muttering, \"I feel like a walking pumpkin in this.\"\n\n\"This is hardly the case of the century, John,\" Sherlock quipped, tugging at the neckline of his own garish jumper, emblazoned with a garish cartoon bat. \"These jumpers aren't known for their flattering fit.\"\n\nJohn chuckled, \"But it might be the most colorful.\"\n\nThe Haunted House was bustling with visitors, children giggling nervously as they approached the entrance. Suddenly, a commotion erupted from the corner where the dragon costume lurked, its elongated neck snapping playfully at unsuspecting visitors.\n\n\"That costume has a mind of its own,\" John remarked, watching as a child shrieked with delight rather than fear.\n\nSherlock rolled his eyes. \"I think I'd be far better suited to being a dragon tamer,\" he said dryly, marching over to the costume. He bent down, inspecting the mechanism within. \"Ah, faulty wiring,\" he deduced, swiftly untangling the mess. \"Elementary.\"\n\nAs he stood, the dragon head gave an affectionate nip at his shoulder, earning a reluctant smile from Sherlock. \"Quite the bite you've got there,\" he said, patting the costume's snout.\n\nMeanwhile, the candy floss machine began to emit a strange whirring sound, clouds of pink sugar swirling like mischievous spirits. A young girl nearby yelped as her hair became entangled in the sticky mess. Sherlock sighed, striding over with determination.\n\n\"Hold still,\" he instructed, deftly untangling the candy floss from the girl\u2019s hair. \"This is more convoluted than any case file.\"\n\nJohn joined him, trying to suppress his laughter. \"You look like you're in a story by Lewis Carroll.\"\n\n\"More like H.G. Wells, given the technology involved,\" Sherlock retorted, a hint of amusement in his eyes.\n\nThe girl beamed at him, \"You're a real-life hero, Mr. Dragon!\"\n\nSherlock straightened, a rare, genuine smile tugging at his lips. \"Hardly,\" he replied, but the warmth in his voice betrayed his pleasure.\n\nAs the evening wore on, the chaos continued. The dragon costume snapped at visitors with playful mischief, and the candy floss machine occasionally sputtered out puffs of sugar. Yet, amidst the absurdity, Sherlock found himself unexpectedly enjoying the whimsical nature of it all.\n\nJohn watched him, noting the subtle changes in his demeanor. \"Perhaps a cape would suit you better, Sherlock,\" he suggested, gesturing to the jumper. \n\n\"If you ever suggest I wear that jumper again, John, I will personally see to its destruction,\" Sherlock declared with mock severity.\n\nJohn laughed, clapping him on the shoulder. \"Deal.\"\n\nAs the Haunted House finally quieted down, Sherlock and John stood side by side, surveying the aftermath of their adventure. The lanterns flickered, casting a cozy glow over the scene.\n\n\"Not the worst way to spend an evening,\" John admitted.\n\nSherlock nodded, a touch of contentment in his voice. \"No, not the worst at all.\"",

It's for charity. Besides, it's not every day you get to see a dragon costume with a mind of its own.\"\n\nIndeed, the dragon costume was an impressive\u2014if somewhat defective\u2014creation. Designed to loom menacingly over guests as they entered the house, it had unfortunately developed a habit of snapping its jaws at anyone who got too close. Which, as it turned out, included Sherlock. \n\n\"Watch it, Sherlock, the dragon's biting again!\" John called, barely concealing his amusement as the dragon's head lurched forward, narrowly missing Sherlock's ear.\n\nSherlock sidestepped with a huff. \"This is ridiculous,\" he muttered, adjusting the unflattering jumper that Mrs. Hudson had insisted he wear for the occasion. It was an eye-searing shade of orange, adorned with a pattern that vaguely resembled cobwebs. \n\n\"At least it matches the dragon's scales,\" John quipped, earning himself a withering glare from Sherlock.\n\nInside, the haunted house was a whirlwind of chaos. Fog machines belched clouds of mist, while strobe lights flickered erratically. The air was filled with the sounds of creaking floorboards and eerie wails, punctuated by the occasional shriek from a startled visitor.\n\nIn the corner, a candy floss machine was churning out a sticky, sugary mess. Somehow, the floss had managed to escape its confines and was now clinging to every available surface, creating a web of pastel-colored chaos. \n\n\"John, the candy floss is staging a coup,\" Sherlock observed dryly as they passed by, lifting a strand of pink fluff off his shoulder with disdain.\n\n\"Looks like it's winning,\" John replied, trying to stifle his laughter as he watched a group of children attempt to untangle themselves from the sticky trap.\n\nThe evening continued in a similar vein, with the dragon costume causing havoc and the candy floss becoming an unintentional attraction in its own right. As the night wore on, even Sherlock seemed to relent slightly, his irritation giving way to a grudging acceptance of the absurdity around him.\n\nFinally, as the last guests trickled out and the haunted house began to wind down, John turned to Sherlock with a grin. \"Admit it, you had fun.\"\n\nSherlock hesitated, then sighed. \"It was... not entirely without merit,\" he conceded, though his tone suggested he was loath to admit even that much.\n\nJohn chuckled, clapping him on the back. \"See? Told you. And look on the bright side\u2014we survived a dragon attack and a candy floss rebellion. I'd call that a success.\"\n\nSherlock's lips twitched in what might have been the ghost of a smile. \"I suppose,\" he said, finally allowing himself a moment of levity. \"Though next time, John, you're wearing the jumper.\"\n\nWith that, they stepped back into the cool night air, leaving behind the chaos of the haunted house but carrying with them the memory of an evening that, despite its absurdities, had proven unexpectedly entertaining.",

There were tooth marks on the kid\u2019s neck.\u201d\n\u201cDragon ate our Albert!\u201d Sally said.\n\u201cWhat? How do you know the kid was called Albert?\u201d Sherlock asked.\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d John said. \u201cOh, speaking of dragons, it\u2019s fallen over and can\u2019t get back up again.\u201d\n\u201cIt will,\u201d Greg said. \u201cI\u2019ll prod it with St George\u2019s spear.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why is there a dragon? They\u2019re not traditional Hallowe\u2019en creatures.\u201d\n\u201cMycroft got a cheap George and the Dragon costume. We\u2019re not using the George part, although the spear is quite useful. The dragon costume needs adjusting. At the moment Seb\u2019s at the front and Jim\u2019s at the back. Molly thinks it would work better with Jim at the front, but Seb doesn\u2019t fit in the back half. I must be off, dragon to right, punters to welcome. Have a good day, folks!\u201d\nWith that Greg departed, ignoring the various rude words flung in his direction.",
        "story_a": "John Watson had been many things in his life\u2014soldier, doctor, and flatmate to the world's most insufferable consulting detective. But as he stood in the center of 221B Baker Street, surrounded by cobweb decorations and a dragon costume that looked suspiciously like it had been dragged through a hedge, he found himself confronting a new role: Haunted House manager.\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" Sherlock declared, holding up a garish orange jumper adorned with a grinning pumpkin. \"There are limits to what even I will tolerate for the sake of an investigation.\"\n\nJohn sighed, rubbing his temples. \"It's for the kids, Sherlock. And it's not an investigation. Mrs. Hudson asked us to help because the community center's short-staffed.\"\n\n\"Semantics,\" Sherlock muttered, but he reluctantly pulled the jumper over his head, looking like he'd rather be dissecting a corpse.\n\nThe dragon costume lay ominously on the sofa, and John eyed it warily. \"Does it bite?\" he asked, half-joking.\n\nSherlock shot him a withering look. \"Don't be ridiculous, John. It doesn't\u2014\" He stopped mid-sentence as the dragon's head snapped towards him with a mechanical growl. \"Oh, for heaven's sake.\"\n\n\"Looks like it does,\" John said with a smirk. \"Come on, let's get this show on the road.\"\n\nThe community center was a buzz of activity. Children in various states of costume chaos darted around, high on sugar and excitement. Sherlock's dragon costume, now safely worn by a teenager who seemed to have no issues with its mechanical tendencies, was a hit. \n\nSherlock, meanwhile, was manning the 'Mad Scientist's Laboratory,' which mostly involved glaring at anyone who approached his station. John was in charge of the candy floss machine, a task he quickly regretted as pink sticky clouds began to envelop him.\n\n\"Sherlock,\" John called out, trying to disentangle himself from the sugary mess, \"a little help here?\"\n\nSherlock glanced over, his expression a mix of amusement and disdain. \"John, you look like a yeti caught in a candy floss avalanche.\"\n\n\"Very funny,\" John grumbled, but couldn't help a chuckle. \"Just, can you\u2014\" \n\nBefore he could finish, a small child tugged on Sherlock's jumper. \"Mr. Dragon, can I have some candy floss, please?\"\n\nSherlock's eyes softened\u2014a rare sight. \"Of course,\" he said, taking the child's hand and leading them over to the machine.\n\nAs the night wore on, the chaos only increased. The dragon costume had somehow ended up in the haunted maze, terrorizing teenagers and causing several to flee in exaggerated horror. Sherlock's jumper had acquired a few new stains, courtesy of overenthusiastic children with sticky hands. And John, well, he was still fighting a losing battle with the candy floss machine.\n\nBut amidst the absurdity, there were moments\u2014fleeting, but precious\u2014where laughter rang out and smiles were shared. Sherlock, despite his grumbling, had a glimmer of enjoyment in his eyes. John, tired but happy, couldn't deny the warmth that filled his heart seeing Sherlock engage with the children, even if it was in his own peculiar way.\n\nAs the night came to an end, Sherlock turned to John, a rare smile playing on his lips. \"Perhaps there's something to be said for unflattering jumpers and candy floss chaos after all.\"\n\nJohn laughed, clapping Sherlock on the shoulder. \"Happy Halloween, Sherlock.\"\n\n\"Happy Halloween, John.\"",
        "story_b": "\"John, this is absurd,\" Sherlock Holmes grumbled, tugging at the hem of an offensively orange jumper that declared in bold black letters: 'Official Haunted House Guide'. The Haunted House attraction loomed behind them, a haphazard amalgamation of creaky floorboards, fake cobwebs, and the unmistakable scent of candy floss gone rogue.\n\n\"Think of it as a case, Sherlock,\" John Watson replied, attempting to maintain a semblance of order. \"A mystery to solve. Besides, Mrs. Hudson insisted we help her friend.\"\n\nSherlock sighed dramatically. \"If by 'mystery' you mean managing a malfunctioning dragon costume and corralling sugar-fueled children, then yes, a riveting case indeed.\"\n\nAs if on cue, a child shrieked as the dragon costume\u2014previously suspended in eerie stillness\u2014lurched forward with a mechanical growl. Its eyes glowed an unsettling red, and its wings flapped with a mind of their own, sending a gust of air through the room.\n\n\"Fantastic,\" Sherlock muttered. \"The dragon costume's gone rogue.\"\n\nJohn chuckled. \"You fix the dragon, I'll distract the visitors.\"\n\nWith a theatrical roll of his eyes, Sherlock approached the dragon, examining the machinery with his usual analytical precision. Meanwhile, John gathered the children around him, launching into an impromptu ghost story. \"Once upon a time, in a house just like this one...\"\n\nSherlock focused on the dragon's wiring, his fingers deftly navigating the tangled mess. \"Simple mechanics,\" he murmured, disconnecting a few wires and reconnecting them with a sharp click. The dragon stilled, its eyes dimming to a harmless yellow.\n\n\"How's it going, Sherlock?\" John called, his ghost story reaching its crescendo with the kids hanging on his every word.\n\n\"It's as fixed as it can be,\" Sherlock replied, turning back to the crowd. \"Though I suspect our issues stem from more mischievous roots.\"\n\nAs the attraction continued, Sherlock's gaze flitted around the room. A group of children, suspiciously giggling in the corner, caught his attention. One child held a remote control, its antenna pointed toward the dragon.\n\n\"Ah, our culprits,\" Sherlock said, striding over with the jumper flapping ridiculously. \"Ingenious, but you'll have to try harder to fool me.\"\n\nThe children burst into laughter, their prank exposed. \"You caught us, Mr. Holmes!\" one of them exclaimed.\n\nJohn joined them, a broad grin on his face. \"Looks like we've been outsmarted by children, Sherlock.\"\n\nSherlock huffed, though amusement tugged at the corners of his mouth. \"A clever ruse. Perhaps I underestimated the complexity of this case.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you did,\" John agreed, clapping Sherlock on the back. \"Now, let's finish this day without further chaos, shall we?\"\n\nBy the end of the night, the Haunted House had returned to its charming disarray, and the visitors departed with tales of their own. As they locked up, Sherlock caught sight of his reflection in a mirror, the garish jumper still in place.\n\n\"Admit it, Sherlock,\" John teased, \"you enjoyed it more than you thought.\"\n\nSherlock sighed, a rare smile gracing his features. \"Perhaps. But don't expect me to wear this jumper again.\"\n\nJohn laughed, leading the way out. \"Come on, let's go home before the dragon decides to take another bite.\"",

        "ground_truth": "The girl with the purple eyes did not like having her picture taken. She scowled into the camera with alarming intensity.\n\n\u201cSmile,\u201d the photographer said, flashing his own toothy grin.\n\nHer face remained unchanged. No one had asked how she felt being cornered by a stranger, or if she wanted to smile, and scowling was her only means of protest.\n\nThe girl with the purple eyes didn\u2019t actually have purple eyes\u2014that\u2019s just how they looked to her classmates. Really they were deep-blue. The purple came from them being sunken, dark underneath, like a smudged plum or bruises: the combination of inherited memory\u2014generations and generations of purple-eyed women\u2014and many sleepless nights spent coughing, small lungs gasping for air.\n\nShe got her lungs from her father, who had suffered from asthma as well. Growing up, he was thin, probably from the lack of oxygen, breathing in just enough to survive and nothing more. Not enough to thrive or grow or run the way that most boys do, and so he remained small and devoted himself to studying biology and later, medicine. He was different from the other men in his family, and perhaps it was his smallness that made him kind.\n\nThe purple-eyed women on her mother\u2019s side began generations ago. Years of stored fears, doubts, holding of breath so that Dad doesn\u2019t hear you under the bed; the acceptance that even if he doesn\u2019t hear you, he knows exactly where you are; the truth that there is no escape. Small girls\u2019 bodies covered in fingerprints, dealt with harshly, like overworked clay.\n\nIt\u2019s the lack of air that makes for purple eyes, whether it be from fear, asthma, dreams of drowning, or the inherited memory of what\u2019s mine is theirs, especially if what\u2019s mine is feminine and soft\u2014the remembering through mothers and mothers and mothers.\n\nAfter taking her photo, the toothy man, Wes, gave her a nod. While he wished he could\u2019ve coaxed a smile out of this last one, it had been a pretty successful day. Two hours of wrangling a pre-K class into solo photos outside on the playground without a single tantrum or tear shed was success in his book.\n\nWes\u2019s standard of success had changed since his art school days. Back then he spent hours shooting smoke clouds on film, or nude men in black and white. Back then success meant he had been invited onto a shoot with some obscure creative vision or had scored a free drink at a bar, sent over by someone mysterious, attractive, older. He never could have guessed that elementary-class photos would end up paying his bills, or that he would learn how to make four-year-olds smile with his exaggerated facial expressions, almost without fail.\n\nWhen he got home Wes popped a bag of ready-to-steam frozen edamame into the microwave and stared at the photo of that girl, the one with eyes so deep he felt they might fall right into her head.\n\nDamn.\n\nShe was only four or five, with bangs that cut straight across her forehead, her hair pulled back at the nape of her neck into a loose ponytail. She wore a smocked blue cotton dress that popped against her olive skin. It was an eerie photo, and this was one of those rare moments when he looked at his work and remembered what it felt like to be an artist. Suddenly, he was glad she hadn\u2019t smiled. This made for a much better photo. Maybe not something her parents would want to hang on the fridge, but still.\n\n\nNicole pulled up thirty minutes late, screeching to a halt in front of the school. Thirty minutes late meant she would have to retrieve Ella from the office.\n\n\u201cWe have a three-strike system, okay?\u201d said Ms. Smith, the school\u2019s head of administration. She was a petite lady with a southern accent, always wearing a full face of makeup, always in heels. She was someone whom Nicole would have avoided at first glance, but two months into the school year Ms. Smith had proven to be kind, warm-hearted, and welcoming while Ella and her mom learned what it meant to attend St. Ignatius Day School.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fret about it today. I know how hard it can be with traffic and all. It\u2019s just a formality,\u201d she said, handing Ella\u2019s mom a hot-pink \u201ctardy slip.\u201d\n\nDespite Ms. Smith\u2019s reassurance, the hot-pink slip certainly felt like more than just a formality. As she strode down the hall to the office, every teacher she passed stared her down, giving her a disdainful once-over. She folded the piece of paper and shoved it into her purse.\n\nDon\u2019t you care about your child? Are you completely self-absorbed? Don\u2019t you know how traumatizing it is to be forgotten? Think of how this could impact her future.\n\nShe added her own harsh words to their disapproving glances.\n\nQuite honestly, she had forgotten Ella. Well, not forgotten entirely\u2014she had lost track of time. She had been drifting in and out of sleep, and suddenly it was 2:55, leaving her just five minutes to make the almost thirty-minute drive to Ella\u2019s school.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t taken the time to put on something more \u201cadult,\u201d or even more \u201cmom,\u201d and now she walked briskly through the hallway in Ugg slippers and mismatched pajamas.\n\nOn the way home Ella and her mom stopped for Chick-fil-A, a rare indulgence that they decided they had both earned. Ella got a fried-chicken sandwich and a Sprite. She ate about half her sandwich before tucking the rest away in the pocket of the seat in front of her, saving it for later. She took a pull of Sprite through the straw and nodded the way little kids do when they are exceptionally pleased with their choice in beverage.\n\nElla caught her mom\u2019s eye in the rearview mirror and scrunched up her face in a smile.\n\nRelief swept through Nicole\u2019s shoulders and chest. She could almost cry.\n\n\u201cToday a man with very white teeth took our pictures without asking,\u201d Ella said.\n\n\u201cI know, hon. I told you about school pictures today. That\u2019s why you wore your dress, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I forgot,\u201d Ella stated matter-of-factly, taking another swig of Sprite.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Ella. Hey, on our way home I\u2019m going to run into Walgreens, okay? You can stay in the car and finish your Sprite.\u201d\n\nElla nodded.\n\n\nWes grabbed his gym bag from the bench by the door and threw it over his shoulder, digging around in his jacket pocket for his car keys. At thirty-three, he had promised himself that he would never fall victim to that soft, midthirties dad-bod that so many of his friends had grown into, so he worked out often and ate \u201cclean.\u201d Sure, dad-bods were fine for them\u2014most of them settling into complacent, accepting relationships\u2014but he could do better.\n\nOn his way to the gym he stopped by the Walgreens to pick up some Advil, Irish Springs body wash, and a Gatorade Zero. Out of habit he waved at the TV monitor that greeted him, and the tiny mirror image version of him on the monitor waved back.\n\nA woman walked in just as he finished waving, and Wes caught a glimpse of her in the monitor. He was transported. Her eyes were sad, sunken, dark, purple underneath, almost like someone had taken a fist to each of them. It was the second time that day Wes had seen eyes like those. His eyes followed her to the prescription counter, until the rotating display of reading glasses blocked her from view.\n\nThat evening Wes fell asleep on the couch while watching Spencer, his favorite film about Princess Diana. His dreams began with the haunted face of Princess Di as she appeared in the film, played by Kristen Stewart, withering away under the watchful eye of the royal family. Suddenly she was joined by the purple-eyed girl and the purple-eyed woman he had seen earlier that day. The three of them followed him everywhere he went\u2014the gym, the grocery store, the car wash\u2014but in a strange turn of events, he realized that it was he who was following them. He caught their reflections in windows, TV screens, puddles in the street. He stalked them with his camera, like a member of the paparazzi, desperate to get the right angle, the perfect photo. They did not say anything to him or acknowledge that he was there. He followed them all the way to their house in the English countryside, and then he woke up.\n\n\nElla\u2019s dad worked late that night, so Ella and her mom agreed to watch a few episodes of Little Bear while Ella had a breathing treatment. The mask fit over her mouth and nose with a blue elastic strap that went behind her head, like the kind they show you on an airplane \u201cin case of a loss of cabin pressure.\u201d By now Ella was used to the sounds and smells of albuterol being pumped into her lungs and she relaxed into her beanbag chair, watching while Little Bear scooped the moon up into his bucket of water. One hour later, Ella was showered and tucked into bed wearing her polyester blue Cinderella nightgown.\n\n\u201cGoodnight, Ella. Sweet dreams,\u201d her mom said, pulling her door almost to a close.\n\nThen Nicole crawled into her own bed, allowing her feet to stretch as far as they could down into the cool cotton sheets, allowing herself to spread starfish for a moment before turning over onto her left side into a small fetal position.\n\nIt would be a late night for Michael, which meant a less than ideal night\u2019s sleep for her. She would be on edge until he got home. She tried waiting up and opened her copy of The House of the Spirits, a book she had reread more times than she could count. Somehow she found it comforting. Something about the stored-up generations of motherhood, the trauma manifested in physical bodies, the brokenness, but also the slow growth and healing that rolled through the Trueba and del Valle families. It made her feel hopeful. She drifted in and out of sleep. Eventually, she slipped into deep sleep, the kind filled with rhythmic breathing and vivid dreams.\n\nShe dreamed that she was wandering the hallways of a big creaky house with heavy curtains and doors. She didn\u2019t recognize the house but seemed to know exactly where to go. She was small again and wore a white nightgown smattered with blue and pink flowers. She was looking for something.\n\nShe found her way to the kitchen and paused outside the closed door. There were voices on the other side and she could see the lights on, glowing underneath. They were cold, blue, like hospital lights, or the kind associated with an alien abduction\u2014not like the lights of the kitchen she knew. The voices she heard sounded sterile. She didn\u2019t want to open the door because she didn\u2019t want anyone to see her, so she peeked through the keyhole and let out a silent scream.\n\nSplayed out on the kitchen table was Nicole\u2019s Ella, though in this strange world she and Ella both looked about five\u2014not possibly mother and daughter. Ella was spread wide like a butchered animal, two men bent over her little body\u2014men rummaging around in her abdomen, poking and prodding with long metal prongs, wringing out her insides like wet paper towels, slicing through her soft belly and cracking open her chest cavity. They whispered and laughed. They seemed to be searching for something inside her, like pearl divers slicing open oyster shells, unbothered by oyster flesh and juice.\n\nElla\u2019s mom could hear every snap and squelch as the men made themselves familiar with Ella\u2019s insides, as if the awful sounds were being broadcast over a loud speaker. Then one of the men pulled out a camera with a big flashbulb on top and started snapping pictures of Ella\u2019s body from all different angles, contorted, bloodied, splayed open, her eyes empty and deep. Every flash lit the room like a burst of lightning, and the snap of the lens made Ella\u2019s mom feel sick\u2014the snap, flash, snap, flash over and over again, like a strobe light.\n\nThis was more than Nicole could bear, and she let out another scream, though this one was not silent. It was loud, desperate to be heard.\n\nSuddenly she was awake, catching the end of her own scream, which had followed her from nightmare into consciousness. For a moment she didn\u2019t know where she was. She was enveloped in dense, still darkness. She felt a small rustle and realized she was in Ella\u2019s room, kneeling beside her bed. She felt her own face, wet with tears; felt her arms and shoulders, her chest, making sure she was in her adult body again.\n\nThen she felt Ella\u2019s arm, gently; her shoulders, her head. She was warm, small and whole, still in her Cinderella nightgown, breathing deeply. Her eyes fluttered open.\n\n\u201cMom, did you have a bad dream?\u201d Ella asked, her voice full of sleep. She stroked her mom\u2019s head gently, the way someone might pet a wild animal or baby bird.\n\n\u201cElla, I did. I had a really bad dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to get in? To help you sleep?\u201d Ella lifted her comforter a bit, showing the wide expanse of unoccupied twin bed to her left.\n\n\u201cFor a little bit. Just until Dad gets home.\u201d Nicole answered, climbing into bed.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The first time I saw her eyes, I was crouched behind the lens of my Leica, adjusting the focus to capture the delicate interplay of light and shadow in the crowded marketplace. It was late afternoon, and the sun cast a golden hue over the scene, deepening the colors of the vendor stalls and the faces of the people drifting through the narrow aisles. I was just a visitor, passing through this small town on my way to nowhere in particular, drawn by the promise of capturing the essence of everyday life in my photographs.\n\nThen I saw her. She stood apart from the bustling crowd, a still figure in a sea of movement. Her dark hair framed a face that seemed both ageless and ancient, and her eyes\u2014those haunting, deep-set eyes\u2014gazed directly into the lens as if she could see through it, into me. They were eyes that spoke of wisdom and sorrow far beyond her years, and I knew in that moment that I had to capture them.\n\nI clicked the shutter once, twice, three times, unable to tear myself away from the intensity of her gaze. It was only when a woman, presumably her mother, hurried over and took her by the hand that I lowered my camera. The woman glanced at me briefly, her expression one of guarded suspicion, before leading the girl away. But those eyes stayed with me, burned into my memory and, more importantly, onto my film.\n\nBack in my small rented room, I developed the photos in the makeshift darkroom I had set up in the bathroom. The image of the girl emerged slowly, the chemicals revealing the stark contrast of her pale face against the dark backdrop of the market. Her eyes, even in black and white, seemed to hold a depth that was almost supernatural. I found myself staring at the photograph long after it had dried, tracing the lines of her face with my finger, lost in the mystery of who she was and what her eyes were trying to tell me.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and I couldn't shake the image of the girl from my mind. I returned to the marketplace every day, hoping to see her again, but she was never there. I asked around, describing her to the vendors and the regulars, but no one seemed to know who she was. It was as if she had appeared out of nowhere, a ghost haunting my thoughts and my art.\n\nMy obsession with the girl began to consume me. I spent hours each night developing and re-developing the same photograph, trying to tease out more details, to understand the story behind those eyes. I started to dream about her, vivid and unsettling dreams where she would appear in different places\u2014standing in the corner of my room, sitting at the edge of my bed, always watching me with that unblinking gaze.\n\nOne night, as I was poring over the photograph yet again, a knock on the door startled me. I opened it to find the girl's mother standing there, her face pale and drawn, her eyes filled with a mixture of fear and desperation.\n\n\"Please,\" she said, her voice trembling. \"You have to stop.\"\n\n\"Stop what?\" I asked, genuinely confused.\n\n\"Taking pictures of my daughter,\" she replied. \"You've been following us, haven't you?\"\n\n\"No, I\u2014\" I began, but she cut me off.\n\n\"I can feel it,\" she said, her voice rising. \"Every night, I see her in my dreams, watched by strangers, dissected by their eyes and their cameras. It's driving me mad. You have to stop.\"\n\nHer words stunned me into silence. I had no idea that my obsession had been affecting her so deeply, that she had been experiencing the same nightmares that plagued me. I wanted to explain, to apologize, but the intensity of her emotion left me speechless.\n\n\"Please,\" she repeated, tears welling up in her eyes. \"Let us be.\"\n\nShe turned and walked away before I could respond, leaving me standing in the doorway, the weight of her words heavy on my shoulders. I closed the door and returned to my darkroom, staring at the photograph of the girl one last time before tucking it away in a drawer.\n\nI didn't go back to the marketplace after that. I packed my things and moved on, hoping to leave the haunting eyes and the nightmares behind. But even now, years later, I can still see her face in my mind, those eyes staring out at me from the depths of my memory, a reminder of the unintended consequences of my obsession.\n\nIn the years that followed, I traveled far and wide, capturing images of people and places, each photograph a testament to the world as I saw it. But no matter how many faces I photographed, none ever held the same power, the same haunting beauty, as the eyes of that young girl in the marketplace.\n\nAs time passed, I found myself returning to that small town, drawn by an inexplicable need to confront the past. The marketplace was still there, much the same as I remembered it, the same vendors selling their wares, the same vibrant energy filling the air. But the girl and her mother were nowhere to be found.\n\nI wandered through the narrow aisles, my camera hanging heavy around my neck, feeling a strange sense of loss and longing. I had hoped that coming back here would bring some sort of closure, but instead, it only deepened the mystery. I felt like a ghost, drifting through a place that no longer held any answers.\n\nIt was late afternoon when I stumbled upon a small photography shop tucked away in a quiet corner of the marketplace. Curious, I stepped inside, the bell above the door tinkling softly. The shop was filled with old cameras and photographs, a treasure trove of memories captured on film.\n\nAs I browsed the shelves, my eyes were drawn to a photograph hanging on the wall. It was a portrait of a young girl, her dark hair framing a face that seemed both ageless and ancient, her eyes\u2014those haunting, deep-set eyes\u2014gazing directly into the camera. My heart skipped a beat as I realized it was the same girl I had photographed all those years ago.\n\nI turned to the shopkeeper, an elderly man with a kind smile and a twinkle in his eye.\n\n\"Who is she?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThe shopkeeper looked at the photograph and then back at me, his smile fading.\n\n\"She was my granddaughter,\" he said softly. \"She passed away many years ago.\"\n\nI felt a lump form in my throat as I processed his words. The girl, the haunting eyes, the nightmares\u2014it all made sense now. She had been trying to tell me something, to reach out from beyond the grave, and I had been too blind to see it.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said, my voice choked with emotion. \"I didn't know.\"\n\nThe shopkeeper nodded, his eyes filled with a sadness that mirrored my own.\n\n\"She was special,\" he said. \"Her eyes saw things that others couldn't. She had a gift, but it also brought her great pain.\"\n\nI felt a deep sense of guilt wash over me, realizing that my obsession with her had only added to that pain. I wanted to make amends, to find some way to honor her memory, but I didn't know how.\n\n\"May I buy the photograph?\" I asked, hoping that having it would bring some measure of closure.\n\nThe shopkeeper shook his head. \"It's not for sale,\" he said gently. \"But you can have it. She would have wanted you to have it.\"\n\nI took the photograph from the wall, feeling its weight in my hands. It was more than just a picture; it was a connection to a past I could never fully understand, a reminder of the consequences of my actions and the haunting beauty of those eyes.\n\nAs I left the shop, I felt a strange sense of peace settle over me. The girl's eyes would always be with me, a silent witness to my journey and a testament to the power of a single moment captured on film. And in that moment, I knew that my obsession had not been in vain. It had led me to a deeper understanding of myself and the world around me, and for that, I was grateful.\n\nI walked through the marketplace one last time, the photograph clutched tightly in my hand. The sun was setting, casting a golden hue over the scene, deepening the colors and the shadows. I raised my camera and took one final picture, capturing the essence of the place that had changed my life forever. And as I did, I felt the weight of the past lift from my shoulders, replaced by a sense of hope and possibility.\n\nIn the end, it was not the photograph of the girl that haunted me, but the lesson she had taught me: that every image, every moment, holds a story waiting to be discovered, and that sometimes, the most powerful stories are the ones that we least expect.",
        "story_b": "The fog rolled in thick, shrouding the coastal town in a blanket of gray that seemed to dull the edges of reality. It was the kind of morning where time felt suspended, as if the world held its breath waiting for something to tip the scales. In his dimly lit studio, surrounded by vintage cameras and the sharp scent of developing chemicals, Adrian Hart was already lost in his latest obsession.\n\nThe photograph lay before him, a black-and-white portrait of a young girl with eyes that seemed to pierce through the paper. They were pools of shadow that seemed to hold secrets untold, drawing him in with an intensity that left him breathless. Each time he glanced at them, he felt a peculiar sensation, as though the eyes were alive, watching him, understanding him in ways that no one else could.\n\nAdrian's fingers brushed over the photograph, the texture of the paper rough against his skin. He had captured her by chance on a breezy afternoon, the sun breaking through clouds just long enough to cast a halo around her in the park. She had been standing alone, her gaze fixed on something distant, and he had been unable to resist the pull of the light, the way it danced in her eyes.\n\nHe had not intended to take her picture. His focus had been on the landscape, on the way the shadows played against the aged stone fountain. But when he developed the film, her image emerged like a specter, haunting and beautiful, demanding his attention.\n\nAcross town, in a small house nestled at the end of a quiet street, Clara sat bolt upright in her bed, the remnants of a nightmare clinging to her like cobwebs. Her breath came in ragged gasps, her heart pounding a frantic rhythm against her ribs. She pressed a hand to her chest, willing it to calm, to slow, but the images from her dream swirled in her mind, refusing to dissipate.\n\nIn the dream, her daughter, Lily, had been standing in a field of wildflowers, her dress a splash of color against the muted tones of the landscape. Clara had watched, unable to move, as shadows crept closer, faceless figures with cameras and notebooks, their eyes hidden behind dark glasses. They circled Lily, their presence oppressive, and Clara had screamed, a soundless cry that echoed in the void.\n\nClara swung her legs over the side of the bed, her feet meeting the cool floorboards. She needed to see Lily, to hold her, to assure herself that she was safe. The dreams had started a week ago, each one more vivid, more terrifying than the last. They left her shaken and filled with an unshakeable dread, a mother's instinct warning her of danger unseen.\n\nAs she padded down the hallway, the house silent save for the creaking of old wood, she wondered if it was merely her own fears manifesting, a response to the world outside and its endless uncertainties. But deep down, she felt it was more than that, a connection she couldn't comprehend, a thread that tied her to something just beyond her grasp.\n\nIn his studio, Adrian moved through the familiar ritual of developing film, the repetitive motions calming his racing thoughts. He watched as the images came to life, the chemicals etching the light and shadow onto paper, revealing the world as he saw it. Yet, his mind remained tethered to the girl's eyes, their depth and mystery, and the strange compulsion that had taken root within him.\n\nHe had begun to dream of her, though he couldn't recall the details upon waking. It was as if she were a part of him now, embedded in his psyche, a muse and a tormentor all at once. He found himself returning to the park day after day, hoping to glimpse her again, to capture the essence of what had drawn him in so completely.\n\nBut she was never there. Only the echoes of her presence lingered, a whisper on the wind, a shadow beneath the trees. The frustration gnawed at him, a constant reminder of the chasm between desire and reality. He spent hours in his studio, surrounded by the detritus of his obsession, sifting through photographs, searching for clues in the grainy images.\n\nClara stood in the doorway of Lily's room, watching the gentle rise and fall of her daughter's chest. The moonlight cast a soft glow through the window, illuminating the peaceful contours of her face. It was moments like these that she cherished, the stillness and serenity, the assurance that all was well.\n\nYet, the dreams lingered at the edges of her consciousness, a persistent reminder that peace was fleeting, that shadows lurked just beyond the periphery. She wondered if she should tell someone, confide in a friend, seek advice from those who might understand. But the thought of speaking it aloud made it all too real, and so she remained silent, her fears her own to bear.\n\nAs the days passed, Adrian's obsession deepened, a tangled web from which he could not extricate himself. He spent long hours in the archives, poring over old photographs, searching for any trace of the girl, any hint that might explain the hold she had over him. It was during one of these late-night searches that he stumbled upon something that made his blood run cold.\n\nThe photograph was old, sepia-toned and faded, yet unmistakable in its detail. There she was, the same girl, the same eyes, captured in a moment frozen in time. But this photograph was decades old, far older than it should have been, and the realization struck him like a physical blow. She had not aged, not in the slightest.\n\nHe stared at the image, a chill creeping up his spine. How was it possible? Who was she? The questions raced through his mind, each more frantic than the last. It was as if the world had tilted on its axis, the familiar becoming strange and the strange becoming familiar.\n\nThe discovery unraveled something within him, the threads of his obsession pulling tight, binding him to her in ways he could not understand. He felt a compulsion to know more, to uncover the truth that lay hidden beneath layers of time and shadow. Yet, with each step closer, he felt the pull of the abyss, the danger that lurked in the unknown.\n\nClara's nightmares intensified, the shadows growing bolder, more menacing. In her dreams, she saw Lily not as a child but as a timeless figure, her eyes unchanging, her presence eternal. The strangers with cameras circled closer, their whispers filling the air, a language she could not comprehend but felt in the marrow of her bones.\n\nShe awoke each morning with the echoes of those whispers haunting her, a chorus of voices urging her to protect, to guard against the unseen threat. She took to watching Lily more closely, her gaze lingering on her daughter's face, searching for signs, for answers that eluded her waking mind.\n\nIt was on one of these mornings, her resolve steeled by the weight of her dreams, that Clara decided to act. She would not wait for the shadows to close in, for the nightmares to become reality. She would seek out those who might understand, who might help unravel the mystery that bound her daughter to forces unknown.\n\nAdrian, too, felt the urgency, the need to confront the truth that had ensnared him. He returned to the park, the place where it had all begun, hoping for answers, for clarity. The fog lay thick over the town, the world hushed and waiting, as if the very air held its breath.\n\nAs he wandered the familiar paths, his mind a whirlwind of questions and half-formed theories, he caught sight of her\u2014a flash of color in the gray, a figure standing by the fountain. It was her, the girl from his photographs, unchanged, ethereal in the mist.\n\nHis heart raced, a mixture of fear and excitement, as he approached. She turned to face him, her eyes meeting his, and in that moment, he understood. The connection between them, the pull that had drawn him in, was not a product of his imagination. It was real, tangible, a thread that bound them across time and space.\n\nBefore he could speak, before he could reach out, a voice cut through the fog, sharp and clear.\n\n\"Lily!\"\n\nThe girl's head turned, her gaze shifting from Adrian to the woman who had called her name. Clara stood at the edge of the park, her heart pounding, her fears realized. She had seen the man before, in her dreams, his camera an extension of his soul, capturing her daughter in ways she could not fathom.\n\nAdrian stepped back, confusion warring with understanding, as the pieces fell into place. The mother, the child, the nightmares and photographs\u2014a tapestry woven with threads of light and shadow, reality and dream.\n\nClara approached, her expression a mix of protectiveness and curiosity. She had seen the recognition in Adrian's eyes, the understanding that mirrored her own. They stood in silence, the fog swirling around them, the weight of the moment pressing down.\n\n\"I need to know,\" Clara said finally, her voice steady despite the tremor in her heart. \"Why her? Why now?\"\n\nAdrian met her gaze, the truth on the tip of his tongue, the connection between them undeniable. \"I don't know,\" he admitted, the words raw and honest. \"But I think we're meant to find out together.\"\n\nIn that instant, the fog seemed to lift, the world sharpening into focus. They were no longer strangers bound by coincidence but allies in a shared quest, driven by the same need to protect, to understand.\n\nTogether, they turned to Lily, the girl who had brought them together, her eyes holding the secrets of a thousand lifetimes. In her gaze, they saw the past and the future, the promise of answers yet to be discovered.\n\nAs they walked away from the park, the fog closing in behind them, Adrian and Clara knew their journey was only just beginning. They were bound by the mysteries of the girl with haunting eyes, by the dreams that had led them to this moment.\n\nAnd as they stepped into the unknown, they felt the pull of the light, the promise of understanding, guiding them forward into a future where shadows and reality intertwined.",

        "ground_truth": "The girl with the purple eyes did not like having her picture taken. She scowled into the camera with alarming intensity.\n\n\u201cSmile,\u201d the photographer said, flashing his own toothy grin.\n\nHer face remained unchanged. No one had asked how she felt being cornered by a stranger, or if she wanted to smile, and scowling was her only means of protest.\n\nThe girl with the purple eyes didn\u2019t actually have purple eyes\u2014that\u2019s just how they looked to her classmates. Really they were deep-blue. The purple came from them being sunken, dark underneath, like a smudged plum or bruises: the combination of inherited memory\u2014generations and generations of purple-eyed women\u2014and many sleepless nights spent coughing, small lungs gasping for air.\n\nShe got her lungs from her father, who had suffered from asthma as well. Growing up, he was thin, probably from the lack of oxygen, breathing in just enough to survive and nothing more. Not enough to thrive or grow or run the way that most boys do, and so he remained small and devoted himself to studying biology and later, medicine. He was different from the other men in his family, and perhaps it was his smallness that made him kind.\n\nThe purple-eyed women on her mother\u2019s side began generations ago. Years of stored fears, doubts, holding of breath so that Dad doesn\u2019t hear you under the bed; the acceptance that even if he doesn\u2019t hear you, he knows exactly where you are; the truth that there is no escape. Small girls\u2019 bodies covered in fingerprints, dealt with harshly, like overworked clay.\n\nIt\u2019s the lack of air that makes for purple eyes, whether it be from fear, asthma, dreams of drowning, or the inherited memory of what\u2019s mine is theirs, especially if what\u2019s mine is feminine and soft\u2014the remembering through mothers and mothers and mothers.\n\nAfter taking her photo, the toothy man, Wes, gave her a nod. While he wished he could\u2019ve coaxed a smile out of this last one, it had been a pretty successful day. Two hours of wrangling a pre-K class into solo photos outside on the playground without a single tantrum or tear shed was success in his book.\n\nWes\u2019s standard of success had changed since his art school days. Back then he spent hours shooting smoke clouds on film, or nude men in black and white. Back then success meant he had been invited onto a shoot with some obscure creative vision or had scored a free drink at a bar, sent over by someone mysterious, attractive, older. He never could have guessed that elementary-class photos would end up paying his bills, or that he would learn how to make four-year-olds smile with his exaggerated facial expressions, almost without fail.\n\nWhen he got home Wes popped a bag of ready-to-steam frozen edamame into the microwave and stared at the photo of that girl, the one with eyes so deep he felt they might fall right into her head.\n\nDamn.\n\nShe was only four or five, with bangs that cut straight across her forehead, her hair pulled back at the nape of her neck into a loose ponytail. She wore a smocked blue cotton dress that popped against her olive skin. It was an eerie photo, and this was one of those rare moments when he looked at his work and remembered what it felt like to be an artist. Suddenly, he was glad she hadn\u2019t smiled. This made for a much better photo. Maybe not something her parents would want to hang on the fridge, but still.\n\n\nNicole pulled up thirty minutes late, screeching to a halt in front of the school. Thirty minutes late meant she would have to retrieve Ella from the office.\n\n\u201cWe have a three-strike system, okay?\u201d said Ms. Smith, the school\u2019s head of administration. She was a petite lady with a southern accent, always wearing a full face of makeup, always in heels. She was someone whom Nicole would have avoided at first glance, but two months into the school year Ms. Smith had proven to be kind, warm-hearted, and welcoming while Ella and her mom learned what it meant to attend St. Ignatius Day School.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fret about it today. I know how hard it can be with traffic and all. It\u2019s just a formality,\u201d she said, handing Ella\u2019s mom a hot-pink \u201ctardy slip.\u201d\n\nDespite Ms. Smith\u2019s reassurance, the hot-pink slip certainly felt like more than just a formality. As she strode down the hall to the office, every teacher she passed stared her down, giving her a disdainful once-over. She folded the piece of paper and shoved it into her purse.\n\nDon\u2019t you care about your child? Are you completely self-absorbed? Don\u2019t you know how traumatizing it is to be forgotten? Think of how this could impact her future.\n\nShe added her own harsh words to their disapproving glances.\n\nQuite honestly, she had forgotten Ella. Well, not forgotten entirely\u2014she had lost track of time. She had been drifting in and out of sleep, and suddenly it was 2:55, leaving her just five minutes to make the almost thirty-minute drive to Ella\u2019s school.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t taken the time to put on something more \u201cadult,\u201d or even more \u201cmom,\u201d and now she walked briskly through the hallway in Ugg slippers and mismatched pajamas.\n\nOn the way home Ella and her mom stopped for Chick-fil-A, a rare indulgence that they decided they had both earned. Ella got a fried-chicken sandwich and a Sprite. She ate about half her sandwich before tucking the rest away in the pocket of the seat in front of her, saving it for later. She took a pull of Sprite through the straw and nodded the way little kids do when they are exceptionally pleased with their choice in beverage.\n\nElla caught her mom\u2019s eye in the rearview mirror and scrunched up her face in a smile.\n\nRelief swept through Nicole\u2019s shoulders and chest. She could almost cry.\n\n\u201cToday a man with very white teeth took our pictures without asking,\u201d Ella said.\n\n\u201cI know, hon. I told you about school pictures today. That\u2019s why you wore your dress, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I forgot,\u201d Ella stated matter-of-factly, taking another swig of Sprite.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Ella. Hey, on our way home I\u2019m going to run into Walgreens, okay? You can stay in the car and finish your Sprite.\u201d\n\nElla nodded.\n\n\nWes grabbed his gym bag from the bench by the door and threw it over his shoulder, digging around in his jacket pocket for his car keys. At thirty-three, he had promised himself that he would never fall victim to that soft, midthirties dad-bod that so many of his friends had grown into, so he worked out often and ate \u201cclean.\u201d Sure, dad-bods were fine for them\u2014most of them settling into complacent, accepting relationships\u2014but he could do better.\n\nOn his way to the gym he stopped by the Walgreens to pick up some Advil, Irish Springs body wash, and a Gatorade Zero. Out of habit he waved at the TV monitor that greeted him, and the tiny mirror image version of him on the monitor waved back.\n\nA woman walked in just as he finished waving, and Wes caught a glimpse of her in the monitor. He was transported. Her eyes were sad, sunken, dark, purple underneath, almost like someone had taken a fist to each of them. It was the second time that day Wes had seen eyes like those. His eyes followed her to the prescription counter, until the rotating display of reading glasses blocked her from view.\n\nThat evening Wes fell asleep on the couch while watching Spencer, his favorite film about Princess Diana. His dreams began with the haunted face of Princess Di as she appeared in the film, played by Kristen Stewart, withering away under the watchful eye of the royal family. Suddenly she was joined by the purple-eyed girl and the purple-eyed woman he had seen earlier that day. The three of them followed him everywhere he went\u2014the gym, the grocery store, the car wash\u2014but in a strange turn of events, he realized that it was he who was following them. He caught their reflections in windows, TV screens, puddles in the street. He stalked them with his camera, like a member of the paparazzi, desperate to get the right angle, the perfect photo. They did not say anything to him or acknowledge that he was there. He followed them all the way to their house in the English countryside, and then he woke up.\n\n\nElla\u2019s dad worked late that night, so Ella and her mom agreed to watch a few episodes of Little Bear while Ella had a breathing treatment. The mask fit over her mouth and nose with a blue elastic strap that went behind her head, like the kind they show you on an airplane \u201cin case of a loss of cabin pressure.\u201d By now Ella was used to the sounds and smells of albuterol being pumped into her lungs and she relaxed into her beanbag chair, watching while Little Bear scooped the moon up into his bucket of water. One hour later, Ella was showered and tucked into bed wearing her polyester blue Cinderella nightgown.\n\n\u201cGoodnight, Ella. Sweet dreams,\u201d her mom said, pulling her door almost to a close.\n\nThen Nicole crawled into her own bed, allowing her feet to stretch as far as they could down into the cool cotton sheets, allowing herself to spread starfish for a moment before turning over onto her left side into a small fetal position.\n\nIt would be a late night for Michael, which meant a less than ideal night\u2019s sleep for her. She would be on edge until he got home. She tried waiting up and opened her copy of The House of the Spirits, a book she had reread more times than she could count. Somehow she found it comforting. Something about the stored-up generations of motherhood, the trauma manifested in physical bodies, the brokenness, but also the slow growth and healing that rolled through the Trueba and del Valle families. It made her feel hopeful. She drifted in and out of sleep. Eventually, she slipped into deep sleep, the kind filled with rhythmic breathing and vivid dreams.\n\nShe dreamed that she was wandering the hallways of a big creaky house with heavy curtains and doors. She didn\u2019t recognize the house but seemed to know exactly where to go. She was small again and wore a white nightgown smattered with blue and pink flowers. She was looking for something.\n\nShe found her way to the kitchen and paused outside the closed door. There were voices on the other side and she could see the lights on, glowing underneath. They were cold, blue, like hospital lights, or the kind associated with an alien abduction\u2014not like the lights of the kitchen she knew. The voices she heard sounded sterile. She didn\u2019t want to open the door because she didn\u2019t want anyone to see her, so she peeked through the keyhole and let out a silent scream.\n\nSplayed out on the kitchen table was Nicole\u2019s Ella, though in this strange world she and Ella both looked about five\u2014not possibly mother and daughter. Ella was spread wide like a butchered animal, two men bent over her little body\u2014men rummaging around in her abdomen, poking and prodding with long metal prongs, wringing out her insides like wet paper towels, slicing through her soft belly and cracking open her chest cavity. They whispered and laughed. They seemed to be searching for something inside her, like pearl divers slicing open oyster shells, unbothered by oyster flesh and juice.\n\nElla\u2019s mom could hear every snap and squelch as the men made themselves familiar with Ella\u2019s insides, as if the awful sounds were being broadcast over a loud speaker. Then one of the men pulled out a camera with a big flashbulb on top and started snapping pictures of Ella\u2019s body from all different angles, contorted, bloodied, splayed open, her eyes empty and deep. Every flash lit the room like a burst of lightning, and the snap of the lens made Ella\u2019s mom feel sick\u2014the snap, flash, snap, flash over and over again, like a strobe light.\n\nThis was more than Nicole could bear, and she let out another scream, though this one was not silent. It was loud, desperate to be heard.\n\nSuddenly she was awake, catching the end of her own scream, which had followed her from nightmare into consciousness. For a moment she didn\u2019t know where she was. She was enveloped in dense, still darkness. She felt a small rustle and realized she was in Ella\u2019s room, kneeling beside her bed. She felt her own face, wet with tears; felt her arms and shoulders, her chest, making sure she was in her adult body again.\n\nThen she felt Ella\u2019s arm, gently; her shoulders, her head. She was warm, small and whole, still in her Cinderella nightgown, breathing deeply. Her eyes fluttered open.\n\n\u201cMom, did you have a bad dream?\u201d Ella asked, her voice full of sleep. She stroked her mom\u2019s head gently, the way someone might pet a wild animal or baby bird.\n\n\u201cElla, I did. I had a really bad dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to get in? To help you sleep?\u201d Ella lifted her comforter a bit, showing the wide expanse of unoccupied twin bed to her left.\n\n\u201cFor a little bit. Just until Dad gets home.\u201d Nicole answered, climbing into bed.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The first time I saw her eyes, I was crouched behind the lens of my Leica, adjusting the focus to capture the delicate interplay of light and shadow in the crowded marketplace. It was late afternoon, and the sun cast a golden hue over the scene, deepening the colors of the vendor stalls and the faces of the people drifting through the narrow aisles. I was just a visitor, passing through this small town on my way to nowhere in particular, drawn by the promise of capturing the essence of everyday life in my photographs.\n\nThen I saw her. She stood apart from the bustling crowd, a still figure in a sea of movement. Her dark hair framed a face that seemed both ageless and ancient, and her eyes\u2014those haunting, deep-set eyes\u2014gazed directly into the lens as if she could see through it, into me. They were eyes that spoke of wisdom and sorrow far beyond her years, and I knew in that moment that I had to capture them.\n\nI clicked the shutter once, twice, three times, unable to tear myself away from the intensity of her gaze. It was only when a woman, presumably her mother, hurried over and took her by the hand that I lowered my camera. The woman glanced at me briefly, her expression one of guarded suspicion, before leading the girl away. But those eyes stayed with me, burned into my memory and, more importantly, onto my film.\n\nBack in my small rented room, I developed the photos in the makeshift darkroom I had set up in the bathroom. The image of the girl emerged slowly, the chemicals revealing the stark contrast of her pale face against the dark backdrop of the market. Her eyes, even in black and white, seemed to hold a depth that was almost supernatural. I found myself staring at the photograph long after it had dried, tracing the lines of her face with my finger, lost in the mystery of who she was and what her eyes were trying to tell me.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and I couldn't shake the image of the girl from my mind. I returned to the marketplace every day, hoping to see her again, but she was never there. I asked around, describing her to the vendors and the regulars, but no one seemed to know who she was. It was as if she had appeared out of nowhere, a ghost haunting my thoughts and my art.\n\nMy obsession with the girl began to consume me. I spent hours each night developing and re-developing the same photograph, trying to tease out more details, to understand the story behind those eyes. I started to dream about her, vivid and unsettling dreams where she would appear in different places\u2014standing in the corner of my room, sitting at the edge of my bed, always watching me with that unblinking gaze.\n\nOne night, as I was poring over the photograph yet again, a knock on the door startled me. I opened it to find the girl's mother standing there, her face pale and drawn, her eyes filled with a mixture of fear and desperation.\n\n\"Please,\" she said, her voice trembling. \"You have to stop.\"\n\n\"Stop what?\" I asked, genuinely confused.\n\n\"Taking pictures of my daughter,\" she replied. \"You've been following us, haven't you?\"\n\n\"No, I\u2014\" I began, but she cut me off.\n\n\"I can feel it,\" she said, her voice rising. \"Every night, I see her in my dreams, watched by strangers, dissected by their eyes and their cameras. It's driving me mad. You have to stop.\"\n\nHer words stunned me into silence. I had no idea that my obsession had been affecting her so deeply, that she had been experiencing the same nightmares that plagued me. I wanted to explain, to apologize, but the intensity of her emotion left me speechless.\n\n\"Please,\" she repeated, tears welling up in her eyes. \"Let us be.\"\n\nShe turned and walked away before I could respond, leaving me standing in the doorway, the weight of her words heavy on my shoulders. I closed the door and returned to my darkroom, staring at the photograph of the girl one last time before tucking it away in a drawer.\n\nI didn't go back to the marketplace after that. I packed my things and moved on, hoping to leave the haunting eyes and the nightmares behind. But even now, years later, I can still see her face in my mind, those eyes staring out at me from the depths of my memory, a reminder of the unintended consequences of my obsession.\n\nIn the years that followed, I traveled far and wide, capturing images of people and places, each photograph a testament to the world as I saw it. But no matter how many faces I photographed, none ever held the same power, the same haunting beauty, as the eyes of that young girl in the marketplace.\n\nAs time passed, I found myself returning to that small town, drawn by an inexplicable need to confront the past. The marketplace was still there, much the same as I remembered it, the same vendors selling their wares, the same vibrant energy filling the air. But the girl and her mother were nowhere to be found.\n\nI wandered through the narrow aisles, my camera hanging heavy around my neck, feeling a strange sense of loss and longing. I had hoped that coming back here would bring some sort of closure, but instead, it only deepened the mystery. I felt like a ghost, drifting through a place that no longer held any answers.\n\nIt was late afternoon when I stumbled upon a small photography shop tucked away in a quiet corner of the marketplace. Curious, I stepped inside, the bell above the door tinkling softly. The shop was filled with old cameras and photographs, a treasure trove of memories captured on film.\n\nAs I browsed the shelves, my eyes were drawn to a photograph hanging on the wall. It was a portrait of a young girl, her dark hair framing a face that seemed both ageless and ancient, her eyes\u2014those haunting, deep-set eyes\u2014gazing directly into the camera. My heart skipped a beat as I realized it was the same girl I had photographed all those years ago.\n\nI turned to the shopkeeper, an elderly man with a kind smile and a twinkle in his eye.\n\n\"Who is she?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThe shopkeeper looked at the photograph and then back at me, his smile fading.\n\n\"She was my granddaughter,\" he said softly. \"She passed away many years ago.\"\n\nI felt a lump form in my throat as I processed his words. The girl, the haunting eyes, the nightmares\u2014it all made sense now. She had been trying to tell me something, to reach out from beyond the grave, and I had been too blind to see it.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said, my voice choked with emotion. \"I didn't know.\"\n\nThe shopkeeper nodded, his eyes filled with a sadness that mirrored my own.\n\n\"She was special,\" he said. \"Her eyes saw things that others couldn't. She had a gift, but it also brought her great pain.\"\n\nI felt a deep sense of guilt wash over me, realizing that my obsession with her had only added to that pain. I wanted to make amends, to find some way to honor her memory, but I didn't know how.\n\n\"May I buy the photograph?\" I asked, hoping that having it would bring some measure of closure.\n\nThe shopkeeper shook his head. \"It's not for sale,\" he said gently. \"But you can have it. She would have wanted you to have it.\"\n\nI took the photograph from the wall, feeling its weight in my hands. It was more than just a picture; it was a connection to a past I could never fully understand, a reminder of the consequences of my actions and the haunting beauty of those eyes.\n\nAs I left the shop, I felt a strange sense of peace settle over me. The girl's eyes would always be with me, a silent witness to my journey and a testament to the power of a single moment captured on film. And in that moment, I knew that my obsession had not been in vain. It had led me to a deeper understanding of myself and the world around me, and for that, I was grateful.\n\nI walked through the marketplace one last time, the photograph clutched tightly in my hand. The sun was setting, casting a golden hue over the scene, deepening the colors and the shadows. I raised my camera and took one final picture, capturing the essence of the place that had changed my life forever. And as I did, I felt the weight of the past lift from my shoulders, replaced by a sense of hope and possibility.\n\nIn the end, it was not the photograph of the girl that haunted me, but the lesson she had taught me: that every image, every moment, holds a story waiting to be discovered, and that sometimes, the most powerful stories are the ones that we least expect.",
        "story_b": "In the dim light of his studio, where shadows danced among the equipment and the scent of developing chemicals lingered like a ghost, the photographer stared at the image on his screen. The girl's eyes\u2014two vast pools of midnight\u2014held him captive, their depths whispering secrets and stories that he could not fully grasp. Each click of the shutter had felt like a heartbeat, a pulse that connected him to something beyond the lens, yet as elusive as the flickering light that played over her face.\n\nHe had met her by chance at a local fair, where the air was thick with laughter and the sweet aroma of cotton candy. She had been seated on a carousel horse, her eyes scanning the crowd with a curious, searching gaze that seemed to pierce through the noise. Drawn inexplicably to those eyes, he had asked her mother if he could take a few pictures. The mother, a woman with a weary smile and lavender-scented hair, had hesitated before nodding her consent.\n\nNow, in the quiet solitude of his studio, he found himself returning to that moment, reliving it with an intensity that bordered on obsession. He studied the girl's image, tracing every contour, every shadow, as if trying to unlock some hidden truth within the depths of her stare. Her eyes were windows to a world he could never enter, yet couldn't look away from.\n\nAcross town, the girl's mother lay in bed, surrounded by the comforting scents of lavender and chamomile, yet unable to escape the grip of her nightmares. Every night, the dreams came, uninvited and relentless, leaving her breathless and afraid. In the dark theater of her mind, she saw her daughter ensnared by shadows that crept like silent predators, wrapping around her image with an insidious intent. Strangers watched and dissected her child with eyes that were as cold and unfeeling as the lens of a camera.\n\nShe awoke in a cold sweat, heart pounding with a frantic rhythm that matched the fear coursing through her veins. Her daughter's room was just down the hall, a sanctuary filled with protective symbols\u2014dreamcatchers, soft toys, and the gentle glow of a nightlight that warded off the darkness. Yet the nightmares seeped into her waking hours, casting a pall over her interactions with her daughter, who remained blissfully unaware of the specters that haunted her mother.\n\nThe photographer, meanwhile, found himself consumed by the girl's eyes, their haunting beauty a siren call that echoed in his thoughts. He began to see her eyes everywhere, in the reflections of storefront windows, in the shimmering surface of his morning coffee, in the depths of his own dreams where they loomed larger than life. His fascination grew into a relentless tide, washing over his days and nights, pulling him further into a world he could not comprehend.\n\nHe tried to capture the essence of those eyes in his work, but each attempt left him feeling empty, as if the soul of the image had slipped through his fingers. He wanted to call the mother, to ask for another session, another chance to explore the mystery that had ensnared him. Yet something held him back\u2014a whisper of guilt that warned him of crossing a line he could not see but sensed was there.\n\nThe mother's nightmares intensified, the images more vivid, more terrifying. Her daughter's laughter, once a balm to her soul, now carried an edge of fear, the echoes of her dreams bleeding into reality. She watched her child with a growing sense of unease, as if expecting the shadows to reach out and claim her. The protective symbols in her home offered little comfort against the relentless march of her fears.\n\nOne day, as she watched her daughter play in the garden, the phone rang. It was the photographer, his voice a tentative thread that wove through her anxiety. He spoke of the pictures, of the magic he saw in her daughter's eyes, and asked if he could take more. The request, though innocuous, struck a chord within her, resonating with the echoes of her nightmares. She hesitated, her mind a battlefield of maternal instincts and the shadows of her dreams.\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" she replied, her voice wavering.\n\nHe sensed the uncertainty, the unspoken hesitation, and pressed on, trying to convey the depth of his fascination without revealing the obsession that lurked beneath. \"Her eyes... they're captivating. There's something there, something that I can't quite capture. Please, just one more session.\"\n\nThe mother's grip on the phone tightened, her heart a drumbeat of doubt and fear. The shadows of her nightmares loomed large, whispering warnings of strangers and cold, dissecting eyes. But there was also a part of her that understood the power of capturing a moment, of preserving the essence of her child's innocence.\n\n\"All right,\" she said at last, her voice barely above a whisper. \"But only if I'm there with her.\"\n\nThe photographer agreed, relief flooding through him like a tide. He could hardly wait to see those eyes again, to delve into their depths and perhaps, finally, capture the essence that eluded him. Yet as he prepared for the session, a sliver of unease crept into his thoughts, a feeling that perhaps he was venturing too close to something sacred, something he had no right to claim.\n\nThe day of the session arrived, and the mother watched as the photographer set up his equipment with a meticulous care that bordered on reverence. Her daughter sat patiently, her eyes wide with curiosity, oblivious to the tension that hung in the air. As the photographer began to click away, the mother observed him closely, noting the intensity with which he studied her child, the way his gaze lingered on those haunting eyes.\n\nThe session progressed, each click of the shutter a heartbeat in the silent room. The photographer was lost in the moment, absorbed by the interplay of light and shadow, the way the girl's eyes seemed to draw him into a world he could never fully understand. Yet with each shot, he felt a growing sense of frustration, as if the truth he sought remained just beyond his grasp.\n\nThe mother, too, felt the weight of the session, her nightmares hovering at the edges of her consciousness. She watched her daughter's image flash across the screen, her heart a tumult of love and fear, the shadows of her dreams whispering their insidious warnings. Yet as the session drew to a close, she saw something in the photographer's eyes\u2014a flicker of understanding, a glimpse of the struggle within him.\n\nAs they packed up, the photographer hesitated, his mind a whirlwind of conflicting emotions. He wanted to thank the mother, to express his gratitude for allowing him another glimpse into the world behind her daughter's eyes. Yet he also felt the weight of his obsession, the knowledge that he had crossed a line that perhaps should have remained intact.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said at last, his voice a quiet echo in the room. \"Her eyes... they're extraordinary.\"\n\nThe mother nodded, her own emotions a tangled web of relief and lingering unease. \"They are,\" she agreed, her voice soft. \"But they're just a part of her.\"\n\nHe nodded, understanding more than he had before. The girl's eyes were indeed extraordinary, but they were not the whole of her. They were windows to a world that was both captivating and elusive, a world he could admire but never fully possess.\n\nAs they parted ways, the photographer felt a sense of closure, a release from the grip of his obsession. He had seen the depths of those haunting eyes, had tried to capture their essence, but in the end, he realized that some mysteries were not meant to be unraveled. They were to be cherished, admired from a distance, like the beauty of a star-streaked sky or the fleeting glow of a sunset.\n\nFor the mother, the session marked a turning point in her battle with the nightmares. She saw her daughter's image not as a harbinger of fear, but as a beacon of strength and innocence. The shadows still lurked at the edges of her dreams, but she faced them with renewed resolve, knowing that her love was the strongest shield against the darkness.\n\nIn the quiet of their separate worlds, both the photographer and the mother found a measure of peace. Their paths had crossed in a moment of shared wonder, their lives briefly intertwined by the haunting beauty of a child's eyes. And though they would never meet again, the memory of that shared moment lingered, a testament to the power of connection and the mysteries that bind us all.",

        "ground_truth": "The girl with the purple eyes did not like having her picture taken. She scowled into the camera with alarming intensity.\n\n\u201cSmile,\u201d the photographer said, flashing his own toothy grin.\n\nHer face remained unchanged. No one had asked how she felt being cornered by a stranger, or if she wanted to smile, and scowling was her only means of protest.\n\nThe girl with the purple eyes didn\u2019t actually have purple eyes\u2014that\u2019s just how they looked to her classmates. Really they were deep-blue. The purple came from them being sunken, dark underneath, like a smudged plum or bruises: the combination of inherited memory\u2014generations and generations of purple-eyed women\u2014and many sleepless nights spent coughing, small lungs gasping for air.\n\nShe got her lungs from her father, who had suffered from asthma as well. Growing up, he was thin, probably from the lack of oxygen, breathing in just enough to survive and nothing more. Not enough to thrive or grow or run the way that most boys do, and so he remained small and devoted himself to studying biology and later, medicine. He was different from the other men in his family, and perhaps it was his smallness that made him kind.\n\nThe purple-eyed women on her mother\u2019s side began generations ago. Years of stored fears, doubts, holding of breath so that Dad doesn\u2019t hear you under the bed; the acceptance that even if he doesn\u2019t hear you, he knows exactly where you are; the truth that there is no escape. Small girls\u2019 bodies covered in fingerprints, dealt with harshly, like overworked clay.\n\nIt\u2019s the lack of air that makes for purple eyes, whether it be from fear, asthma, dreams of drowning, or the inherited memory of what\u2019s mine is theirs, especially if what\u2019s mine is feminine and soft\u2014the remembering through mothers and mothers and mothers.\n\nAfter taking her photo, the toothy man, Wes, gave her a nod. While he wished he could\u2019ve coaxed a smile out of this last one, it had been a pretty successful day. Two hours of wrangling a pre-K class into solo photos outside on the playground without a single tantrum or tear shed was success in his book.\n\nWes\u2019s standard of success had changed since his art school days. Back then he spent hours shooting smoke clouds on film, or nude men in black and white. Back then success meant he had been invited onto a shoot with some obscure creative vision or had scored a free drink at a bar, sent over by someone mysterious, attractive, older. He never could have guessed that elementary-class photos would end up paying his bills, or that he would learn how to make four-year-olds smile with his exaggerated facial expressions, almost without fail.\n\nWhen he got home Wes popped a bag of ready-to-steam frozen edamame into the microwave and stared at the photo of that girl, the one with eyes so deep he felt they might fall right into her head.\n\nDamn.\n\nShe was only four or five, with bangs that cut straight across her forehead, her hair pulled back at the nape of her neck into a loose ponytail. She wore a smocked blue cotton dress that popped against her olive skin. It was an eerie photo, and this was one of those rare moments when he looked at his work and remembered what it felt like to be an artist. Suddenly, he was glad she hadn\u2019t smiled. This made for a much better photo. Maybe not something her parents would want to hang on the fridge, but still.\n\n\nNicole pulled up thirty minutes late, screeching to a halt in front of the school. Thirty minutes late meant she would have to retrieve Ella from the office.\n\n\u201cWe have a three-strike system, okay?\u201d said Ms. Smith, the school\u2019s head of administration. She was a petite lady with a southern accent, always wearing a full face of makeup, always in heels. She was someone whom Nicole would have avoided at first glance, but two months into the school year Ms. Smith had proven to be kind, warm-hearted, and welcoming while Ella and her mom learned what it meant to attend St. Ignatius Day School.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fret about it today. I know how hard it can be with traffic and all. It\u2019s just a formality,\u201d she said, handing Ella\u2019s mom a hot-pink \u201ctardy slip.\u201d\n\nDespite Ms. Smith\u2019s reassurance, the hot-pink slip certainly felt like more than just a formality. As she strode down the hall to the office, every teacher she passed stared her down, giving her a disdainful once-over. She folded the piece of paper and shoved it into her purse.\n\nDon\u2019t you care about your child? Are you completely self-absorbed? Don\u2019t you know how traumatizing it is to be forgotten? Think of how this could impact her future.\n\nShe added her own harsh words to their disapproving glances.\n\nQuite honestly, she had forgotten Ella. Well, not forgotten entirely\u2014she had lost track of time. She had been drifting in and out of sleep, and suddenly it was 2:55, leaving her just five minutes to make the almost thirty-minute drive to Ella\u2019s school.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t taken the time to put on something more \u201cadult,\u201d or even more \u201cmom,\u201d and now she walked briskly through the hallway in Ugg slippers and mismatched pajamas.\n\nOn the way home Ella and her mom stopped for Chick-fil-A, a rare indulgence that they decided they had both earned. Ella got a fried-chicken sandwich and a Sprite. She ate about half her sandwich before tucking the rest away in the pocket of the seat in front of her, saving it for later. She took a pull of Sprite through the straw and nodded the way little kids do when they are exceptionally pleased with their choice in beverage.\n\nElla caught her mom\u2019s eye in the rearview mirror and scrunched up her face in a smile.\n\nRelief swept through Nicole\u2019s shoulders and chest. She could almost cry.\n\n\u201cToday a man with very white teeth took our pictures without asking,\u201d Ella said.\n\n\u201cI know, hon. I told you about school pictures today. That\u2019s why you wore your dress, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I forgot,\u201d Ella stated matter-of-factly, taking another swig of Sprite.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Ella. Hey, on our way home I\u2019m going to run into Walgreens, okay? You can stay in the car and finish your Sprite.\u201d\n\nElla nodded.\n\n\nWes grabbed his gym bag from the bench by the door and threw it over his shoulder, digging around in his jacket pocket for his car keys. At thirty-three, he had promised himself that he would never fall victim to that soft, midthirties dad-bod that so many of his friends had grown into, so he worked out often and ate \u201cclean.\u201d Sure, dad-bods were fine for them\u2014most of them settling into complacent, accepting relationships\u2014but he could do better.\n\nOn his way to the gym he stopped by the Walgreens to pick up some Advil, Irish Springs body wash, and a Gatorade Zero. Out of habit he waved at the TV monitor that greeted him, and the tiny mirror image version of him on the monitor waved back.\n\nA woman walked in just as he finished waving, and Wes caught a glimpse of her in the monitor. He was transported. Her eyes were sad, sunken, dark, purple underneath, almost like someone had taken a fist to each of them. It was the second time that day Wes had seen eyes like those. His eyes followed her to the prescription counter, until the rotating display of reading glasses blocked her from view.\n\nThat evening Wes fell asleep on the couch while watching Spencer, his favorite film about Princess Diana. His dreams began with the haunted face of Princess Di as she appeared in the film, played by Kristen Stewart, withering away under the watchful eye of the royal family. Suddenly she was joined by the purple-eyed girl and the purple-eyed woman he had seen earlier that day. The three of them followed him everywhere he went\u2014the gym, the grocery store, the car wash\u2014but in a strange turn of events, he realized that it was he who was following them. He caught their reflections in windows, TV screens, puddles in the street. He stalked them with his camera, like a member of the paparazzi, desperate to get the right angle, the perfect photo. They did not say anything to him or acknowledge that he was there. He followed them all the way to their house in the English countryside, and then he woke up.\n\n\nElla\u2019s dad worked late that night, so Ella and her mom agreed to watch a few episodes of Little Bear while Ella had a breathing treatment. The mask fit over her mouth and nose with a blue elastic strap that went behind her head, like the kind they show you on an airplane \u201cin case of a loss of cabin pressure.\u201d By now Ella was used to the sounds and smells of albuterol being pumped into her lungs and she relaxed into her beanbag chair, watching while Little Bear scooped the moon up into his bucket of water. One hour later, Ella was showered and tucked into bed wearing her polyester blue Cinderella nightgown.\n\n\u201cGoodnight, Ella. Sweet dreams,\u201d her mom said, pulling her door almost to a close.\n\nThen Nicole crawled into her own bed, allowing her feet to stretch as far as they could down into the cool cotton sheets, allowing herself to spread starfish for a moment before turning over onto her left side into a small fetal position.\n\nIt would be a late night for Michael, which meant a less than ideal night\u2019s sleep for her. She would be on edge until he got home. She tried waiting up and opened her copy of The House of the Spirits, a book she had reread more times than she could count. Somehow she found it comforting. Something about the stored-up generations of motherhood, the trauma manifested in physical bodies, the brokenness, but also the slow growth and healing that rolled through the Trueba and del Valle families. It made her feel hopeful. She drifted in and out of sleep. Eventually, she slipped into deep sleep, the kind filled with rhythmic breathing and vivid dreams.\n\nShe dreamed that she was wandering the hallways of a big creaky house with heavy curtains and doors. She didn\u2019t recognize the house but seemed to know exactly where to go. She was small again and wore a white nightgown smattered with blue and pink flowers. She was looking for something.\n\nShe found her way to the kitchen and paused outside the closed door. There were voices on the other side and she could see the lights on, glowing underneath. They were cold, blue, like hospital lights, or the kind associated with an alien abduction\u2014not like the lights of the kitchen she knew. The voices she heard sounded sterile. She didn\u2019t want to open the door because she didn\u2019t want anyone to see her, so she peeked through the keyhole and let out a silent scream.\n\nSplayed out on the kitchen table was Nicole\u2019s Ella, though in this strange world she and Ella both looked about five\u2014not possibly mother and daughter. Ella was spread wide like a butchered animal, two men bent over her little body\u2014men rummaging around in her abdomen, poking and prodding with long metal prongs, wringing out her insides like wet paper towels, slicing through her soft belly and cracking open her chest cavity. They whispered and laughed. They seemed to be searching for something inside her, like pearl divers slicing open oyster shells, unbothered by oyster flesh and juice.\n\nElla\u2019s mom could hear every snap and squelch as the men made themselves familiar with Ella\u2019s insides, as if the awful sounds were being broadcast over a loud speaker. Then one of the men pulled out a camera with a big flashbulb on top and started snapping pictures of Ella\u2019s body from all different angles, contorted, bloodied, splayed open, her eyes empty and deep. Every flash lit the room like a burst of lightning, and the snap of the lens made Ella\u2019s mom feel sick\u2014the snap, flash, snap, flash over and over again, like a strobe light.\n\nThis was more than Nicole could bear, and she let out another scream, though this one was not silent. It was loud, desperate to be heard.\n\nSuddenly she was awake, catching the end of her own scream, which had followed her from nightmare into consciousness. For a moment she didn\u2019t know where she was. She was enveloped in dense, still darkness. She felt a small rustle and realized she was in Ella\u2019s room, kneeling beside her bed. She felt her own face, wet with tears; felt her arms and shoulders, her chest, making sure she was in her adult body again.\n\nThen she felt Ella\u2019s arm, gently; her shoulders, her head. She was warm, small and whole, still in her Cinderella nightgown, breathing deeply. Her eyes fluttered open.\n\n\u201cMom, did you have a bad dream?\u201d Ella asked, her voice full of sleep. She stroked her mom\u2019s head gently, the way someone might pet a wild animal or baby bird.\n\n\u201cElla, I did. I had a really bad dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to get in? To help you sleep?\u201d Ella lifted her comforter a bit, showing the wide expanse of unoccupied twin bed to her left.\n\n\u201cFor a little bit. Just until Dad gets home.\u201d Nicole answered, climbing into bed.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The first time I saw her eyes, I was crouched behind the lens of my Leica, adjusting the focus to capture the delicate interplay of light and shadow in the crowded marketplace. It was late afternoon, and the sun cast a golden hue over the scene, deepening the colors of the vendor stalls and the faces of the people drifting through the narrow aisles. I was just a visitor, passing through this small town on my way to nowhere in particular, drawn by the promise of capturing the essence of everyday life in my photographs.\n\nThen I saw her. She stood apart from the bustling crowd, a still figure in a sea of movement. Her dark hair framed a face that seemed both ageless and ancient, and her eyes\u2014those haunting, deep-set eyes\u2014gazed directly into the lens as if she could see through it, into me. They were eyes that spoke of wisdom and sorrow far beyond her years, and I knew in that moment that I had to capture them.\n\nI clicked the shutter once, twice, three times, unable to tear myself away from the intensity of her gaze. It was only when a woman, presumably her mother, hurried over and took her by the hand that I lowered my camera. The woman glanced at me briefly, her expression one of guarded suspicion, before leading the girl away. But those eyes stayed with me, burned into my memory and, more importantly, onto my film.\n\nBack in my small rented room, I developed the photos in the makeshift darkroom I had set up in the bathroom. The image of the girl emerged slowly, the chemicals revealing the stark contrast of her pale face against the dark backdrop of the market. Her eyes, even in black and white, seemed to hold a depth that was almost supernatural. I found myself staring at the photograph long after it had dried, tracing the lines of her face with my finger, lost in the mystery of who she was and what her eyes were trying to tell me.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and I couldn't shake the image of the girl from my mind. I returned to the marketplace every day, hoping to see her again, but she was never there. I asked around, describing her to the vendors and the regulars, but no one seemed to know who she was. It was as if she had appeared out of nowhere, a ghost haunting my thoughts and my art.\n\nMy obsession with the girl began to consume me. I spent hours each night developing and re-developing the same photograph, trying to tease out more details, to understand the story behind those eyes. I started to dream about her, vivid and unsettling dreams where she would appear in different places\u2014standing in the corner of my room, sitting at the edge of my bed, always watching me with that unblinking gaze.\n\nOne night, as I was poring over the photograph yet again, a knock on the door startled me. I opened it to find the girl's mother standing there, her face pale and drawn, her eyes filled with a mixture of fear and desperation.\n\n\"Please,\" she said, her voice trembling. \"You have to stop.\"\n\n\"Stop what?\" I asked, genuinely confused.\n\n\"Taking pictures of my daughter,\" she replied. \"You've been following us, haven't you?\"\n\n\"No, I\u2014\" I began, but she cut me off.\n\n\"I can feel it,\" she said, her voice rising. \"Every night, I see her in my dreams, watched by strangers, dissected by their eyes and their cameras. It's driving me mad. You have to stop.\"\n\nHer words stunned me into silence. I had no idea that my obsession had been affecting her so deeply, that she had been experiencing the same nightmares that plagued me. I wanted to explain, to apologize, but the intensity of her emotion left me speechless.\n\n\"Please,\" she repeated, tears welling up in her eyes. \"Let us be.\"\n\nShe turned and walked away before I could respond, leaving me standing in the doorway, the weight of her words heavy on my shoulders. I closed the door and returned to my darkroom, staring at the photograph of the girl one last time before tucking it away in a drawer.\n\nI didn't go back to the marketplace after that. I packed my things and moved on, hoping to leave the haunting eyes and the nightmares behind. But even now, years later, I can still see her face in my mind, those eyes staring out at me from the depths of my memory, a reminder of the unintended consequences of my obsession.\n\nIn the years that followed, I traveled far and wide, capturing images of people and places, each photograph a testament to the world as I saw it. But no matter how many faces I photographed, none ever held the same power, the same haunting beauty, as the eyes of that young girl in the marketplace.\n\nAs time passed, I found myself returning to that small town, drawn by an inexplicable need to confront the past. The marketplace was still there, much the same as I remembered it, the same vendors selling their wares, the same vibrant energy filling the air. But the girl and her mother were nowhere to be found.\n\nI wandered through the narrow aisles, my camera hanging heavy around my neck, feeling a strange sense of loss and longing. I had hoped that coming back here would bring some sort of closure, but instead, it only deepened the mystery. I felt like a ghost, drifting through a place that no longer held any answers.\n\nIt was late afternoon when I stumbled upon a small photography shop tucked away in a quiet corner of the marketplace. Curious, I stepped inside, the bell above the door tinkling softly. The shop was filled with old cameras and photographs, a treasure trove of memories captured on film.\n\nAs I browsed the shelves, my eyes were drawn to a photograph hanging on the wall. It was a portrait of a young girl, her dark hair framing a face that seemed both ageless and ancient, her eyes\u2014those haunting, deep-set eyes\u2014gazing directly into the camera. My heart skipped a beat as I realized it was the same girl I had photographed all those years ago.\n\nI turned to the shopkeeper, an elderly man with a kind smile and a twinkle in his eye.\n\n\"Who is she?\" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThe shopkeeper looked at the photograph and then back at me, his smile fading.\n\n\"She was my granddaughter,\" he said softly. \"She passed away many years ago.\"\n\nI felt a lump form in my throat as I processed his words. The girl, the haunting eyes, the nightmares\u2014it all made sense now. She had been trying to tell me something, to reach out from beyond the grave, and I had been too blind to see it.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said, my voice choked with emotion. \"I didn't know.\"\n\nThe shopkeeper nodded, his eyes filled with a sadness that mirrored my own.\n\n\"She was special,\" he said. \"Her eyes saw things that others couldn't. She had a gift, but it also brought her great pain.\"\n\nI felt a deep sense of guilt wash over me, realizing that my obsession with her had only added to that pain. I wanted to make amends, to find some way to honor her memory, but I didn't know how.\n\n\"May I buy the photograph?\" I asked, hoping that having it would bring some measure of closure.\n\nThe shopkeeper shook his head. \"It's not for sale,\" he said gently. \"But you can have it. She would have wanted you to have it.\"\n\nI took the photograph from the wall, feeling its weight in my hands. It was more than just a picture; it was a connection to a past I could never fully understand, a reminder of the consequences of my actions and the haunting beauty of those eyes.\n\nAs I left the shop, I felt a strange sense of peace settle over me. The girl's eyes would always be with me, a silent witness to my journey and a testament to the power of a single moment captured on film. And in that moment, I knew that my obsession had not been in vain. It had led me to a deeper understanding of myself and the world around me, and for that, I was grateful.\n\nI walked through the marketplace one last time, the photograph clutched tightly in my hand. The sun was setting, casting a golden hue over the scene, deepening the colors and the shadows. I raised my camera and took one final picture, capturing the essence of the place that had changed my life forever. And as I did, I felt the weight of the past lift from my shoulders, replaced by a sense of hope and possibility.\n\nIn the end, it was not the photograph of the girl that haunted me, but the lesson she had taught me: that every image, every moment, holds a story waiting to be discovered, and that sometimes, the most powerful stories are the ones that we least expect.",
        "story_b": "The photograph lay on the table, a silent testament to an obsession that had begun to consume him. The girl's eyes, captured in a fleeting moment of vulnerability, stared back at him, pools of shadow, deep and unknowable, like the depths of a forgotten well. Each click of the shutter had felt like a step deeper into an abyss of obsession, yet he couldn\u2019t look away.\n\nIn the dim light of his cluttered darkroom, the photographer traced the contours of the image, his fingers hovering just above the surface as if afraid to touch it. The room smelled of chemicals and old film, the air thick with the weight of countless images, each vying for attention, yet none as commanding as this. His mind, once a sharp lens focusing solely on the craft, now felt chaotic, spiraling into a fixation that refused to release him.\n\nHe remembered the day vividly. The sun had been setting, casting a warm glow over the park where he often found inspiration. He had been drawn to the laughter of children, the innocence that seemed so fleeting and fragile. That\u2019s when he saw her, the young girl, sitting alone on a bench, her gaze distant, lost in thoughts only she could fathom. There was something about her eyes that called to him, a silent plea or perhaps a challenge, daring him to capture the essence of her soul.\n\n\u201cThose eyes,\u201d he murmured to himself, the phrase echoing in the dim room, a mantra that had become both comfort and torment.\n\nHis memories drifted to other subjects, other haunting images that had once gripped him. There was the old man with eyes like storm clouds, filled with stories untold. The young couple whose gaze held secrets only they shared. Yet none had left a mark as indelible as the girl with the haunting eyes. It was as if, in capturing her, he had also captured a piece of himself, a fragment of his own soul that he had long forgotten.\n\nMeanwhile, across town, the girl's mother tossed in her sleep, caught in the throes of another vivid nightmare. The room was dimly lit, shadows playing across the walls, as if echoing the turmoil within her mind. In her dreams, she saw her daughter, surrounded by strangers, their eyes cold and analytical, dissecting her with their gaze, stripping away her innocence piece by piece. She reached out, trying to protect her, but her hands passed through as if her daughter were nothing more than a ghost.\n\nEach nightmare was the same, a relentless cycle that left her waking in a cold sweat, her heart pounding in her chest. She would sit up, her breath ragged, the silence of the room pressing in on her like a weight. Her daughter slept peacefully down the hall, unaware of the fears that plagued her mother\u2019s mind, of the dark eyes that watched her even in her dreams.\n\nIn the small hours of the morning, she would find herself at her daughter\u2019s door, watching the rise and fall of her chest, assuring herself that she was safe, untouched by the shadows that haunted her sleep. Yet the unease lingered, a persistent whisper that warned of unseen dangers, of eyes that watched from the darkness.\n\nBack in his darkroom, the photographer\u2019s obsession grew. He found himself returning to the photograph, studying every detail, searching for answers to questions he couldn\u2019t fully articulate. Who was she? What stories lay hidden behind those eyes? Each examination only deepened his fascination, driving him to capture more, to seek out other subjects that might offer a glimpse of the same haunting depth.\n\nHe began to see her eyes everywhere. In the reflection of a storefront window, in the rearview mirror of his car, in the faces of strangers who passed him on the street. It was as if the world had become a gallery, each image a reminder of the gaze that had ensnared him.\n\nYet with each new photograph, he felt a growing disquiet, a sense that he was intruding on something sacred, something that wasn\u2019t his to capture. The line between artist and voyeur blurred, leaving him trapped in a labyrinth of his own making, desperate for a way out but unwilling to let go.\n\nThe mother, too, found herself caught in a cycle of fear and uncertainty. She watched her daughter with a new intensity, searching for signs that might explain the nightmares, the sense of foreboding that hung over their lives like a dark cloud. She began to notice small changes, the way her daughter\u2019s gaze would linger on strangers, as if recognizing something familiar in their eyes.\n\nOne afternoon, as they walked through the park, she caught sight of the photographer, his camera raised, capturing the world in frames. Her heart skipped a beat, an inexplicable dread settling over her. She didn\u2019t know him, had never met him, yet something about his presence felt like an echo of her dreams, a shadow that had crossed from her nightmares into reality.\n\nShe tightened her grip on her daughter\u2019s hand, pulling her closer, as if proximity could shield her from the unseen threat. Her daughter glanced up, a question in her eyes, but the mother only smiled, hiding her fear behind a mask of calm.\n\nThe photographer, oblivious to her gaze, continued his work, driven by a compulsion he couldn\u2019t name. He was aware of the world around him only as shapes and shadows, subjects to be captured, moments to be preserved. His focus remained on the girl, the mystery of her eyes, the story they seemed to promise.\n\nAs the days turned into weeks, the mother\u2019s nightmares intensified, each more vivid than the last. She began to dread the night, the darkness that brought with it visions of her daughter\u2019s innocence being stripped away by unseen eyes. She tried to shake the feeling, to convince herself that they were only dreams, but the fear clung to her, a persistent shadow that refused to fade.\n\nThe photographer, too, found himself in a state of unrest. He spent hours in his darkroom, the photograph a constant presence, a reminder of the obsession that had taken hold. He began to question his motives, his right to capture the lives of others, to dissect them with his lens.\n\n\u201cThe photograph was a mirror,\u201d he thought, reflecting not just her image but the haunting echoes of his own soul. It was as if, in capturing her, he had also captured a part of himself, a fragment he had long sought but never found.\n\nYet the answers remained elusive, slipping through his fingers like sand. He was left with only questions, the haunting eyes of the girl his only clue, a puzzle he was desperate to solve.\n\nThe mother, in her dimly lit bedroom, found herself haunted by her own reflections. She saw her daughter\u2019s innocence in every shadow, every corner, and feared the day when it might be taken from her. Her dreams, once a source of comfort, had become a battleground, a place where she fought to protect her child from unseen threats, from eyes that watched and waited.\n\nThe cycle continued, each caught in their own struggle, their paths intertwined by a photograph that had captured more than just a moment. The photographer, in his darkroom, and the mother, in her bedroom, both haunted by the image, by the eyes that held more than they could ever know.\n\nAnd so it began again, the photographer reviewing the photograph, the mother waking from another nightmare, both trapped in a dance of shadows and light, of obsession and fear. Each seeking answers, each finding only more questions, the haunting eyes of the girl a constant reminder of the mysteries that lay just beyond their reach.",

On the phone very early one morning, when he calls, as he has been calling, immediately after the oncologist making rounds in the hospital has examined him.\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\nOn the phone, so that he is spared seeing your face.

Not knowing, at this time, the vast Sahara that lies ahead with all that you cannot bear, that nonetheless will be borne, and by you.\n\nFor always, each step of the way, you resist.\n\nIt is a steep uphill. It is natural to resist. Or, if you accept the steep climb, console yourself with the thought that it is only temporary. The plateau, the flatland to which you\u2019ve been accustomed, awaits you, both of you. You will return there. Soon.\n\nUntil a day, an hour\u2014always there is a day, an hour\u2014when you began to speak of hospice yourself.\n\nAt first, you, too, are shy, faltering. Your throat feels lacerated as if by metal filings.\n\nGradually, you learn to utter the two syllables clearly, bravely\u2014hos-pice.\n\nSoon after that, you begin to say these distinct, deliberate words: \u201cour hospice.\u201d\n\nSoon, you draw up your vows. Quaintly state to yourself, as if to God, a formal decree.\n\nIt is my hope: I will make of our hospice a honeymoon.\n\nMy vow is to make my husband as comfortable as humanly possible.\n\nTo make him happy. To make us both happy.\n\nTo fulfill whatever he wishes that is within the range of possibility.\n\nFirst: a new setting for him. NOT the Cancer Center. Our hospice will be in our home, which he loves.\n\nThe atrium flooded with morning light.\n\nThe foreshortened horizon\u2014for the house is surrounded by trees.\n\nThe flotillas of sculpted clouds.\n\nMy husband can lie on a sofa, staring at the tree line and at the sky.

His fingers, when squeezed, never fail to squeeze in return.\n\nAs his lips, when kissed, never fail to kiss in return.\n\nI will sleep beside my husband holding him in my arms, not strong arms, in fact, rather weak arms, which nonetheless can be made to behave as if they were strong.\n\nI will scatter seed on the redwood deck outside the window. Not ordinary seed but the more expensive \u201cwild bird seed\u201d my husband purchases.\n\nThrilling to watch the birds. Taking the time, undistracted, really watching, for once . . .\n\nAnd my husband loves music! I will bathe him in the most beautiful music through his waking hours. So long as it is not uncomfortable for him, I will lie on the bed beside him, holding him, listening with him to Beethoven\u2019s \u201cOde to Joy,\u201d Rachmaninoff\u2019s \u201cVespers.\u201d\n\n\nFalling asleep with him. Even during the day. Even with wan sunshine slanting through the window onto our faces. Head on the pillow beside his head.\n\nFrom the bookcases in the house, I will select art books, his favorite artists, books from his photography shelves\u2014Bruce Davidson, Edward Weston, Diane Arbus, Eliot Porter. I will turn the pages slowly, marvel with him.\n\nOld albums, family photographs dating back to the early nineteen-hundreds. His family, great-grandparents who emigrated from the Pale. In which he has only recently shown an interest.\n\nHis favorite foods. . . . Well, I will try!\n\nWhen he is at home, possibly his appetite will return. When I am the one to prepare his food, his appetite will return, I am sure.\n\nOf course, family will come to visit. Adult children, grandchildren. Relatives, friends. Colleagues from the university. Neighbors. Old friends from grammar school he hasn\u2019t seen in fifty years. Some surprises for him\u2014I will negotiate with the imagination of a theatre director.\n\nNot merely hospice but our hospice. Not sad but joyous, a honeymoon.\n\nWe will be happy there, in our own home. Both of us.\n\nFor both of us, the \u201cfinal days\u201d will be a honeymoon. I vow.\n\nIn fact, nothing remotely like this will happen. How could you have imagined it would!\n\nHospice, yes. Honeymoon, no.\n\n",
        "story_a": "When the word \"hospice\" is first spoken, it feels like the air itself changes, heavy with finality. The syllables linger in the room, almost visible, as if they have weight and shape, settling over the furniture, the bed, and the person lying in it. Clara hears it and feels an almost imperceptible shift in the universe, a closing door. It\u2019s her mother, Marjorie, who the doctor is addressing, but the word reverberates through Clara\u2019s own heart, a dull thud of inevitability.\n\nMarjorie stares at the doctor with a mix of resignation and defiance, her once-vibrant green eyes now clouded by the long battle with illness. She nods slowly, her lips pressed into a thin line, and then looks away, out the window where a soft autumn rain begins to fall. Clara watches her mother\u2019s profile, the sharp lines softened by the afternoon light, and feels a pang of something she cannot name.\n\nThey return home, the word \"hospice\" now a silent companion that follows them through the days. Clara finds herself moving through the motions of care with an urgency that surprises her. She arranges visits from the nurses, fills out forms, and talks in hushed tones with her mother\u2019s friends, who come bearing casseroles and quiet condolences.\n\nIn the evenings, after the house has settled into its own kind of weary quiet, Clara sits by her mother\u2019s bedside, reading aloud from old favorites\u2014books they had shared during long summer afternoons when she was a child. Marjorie listens with her eyes closed, a faint smile playing at the corners of her mouth, her breath shallow but steady. It is in these moments that Clara feels the weight of loss most acutely, the slow erosion of time slipping through their fingers.\n\nOne evening, as the fire in the hearth crackles and the shadows lengthen, Marjorie opens her eyes and reaches for Clara\u2019s hand. Her touch is light, almost ethereal, and Clara feels a sudden rush of tears she struggles to hold back.\n\n\u201cClara,\u201d Marjorie says softly, her voice barely a whisper. \u201cDo you remember the garden?\u201d\n\nClara nods, unable to speak. The garden had been Marjorie\u2019s sanctuary, a riot of color and life where she had spent countless hours tending to roses, tulips, and wildflowers. It had been Clara\u2019s playground, a place of wonder and discovery, where she had learned the names of plants and the rhythms of nature.\n\n\u201cI want to see it,\u201d Marjorie says, her eyes shining with a faint glimmer of the old spark. \u201cOne last time.\u201d\n\nClara hesitates, the practical part of her mind already listing the reasons why it might be impossible. But then she sees the determination in her mother\u2019s gaze, the unspoken plea, and she nods.\n\nThe next morning, Clara arranges for a wheelchair and blankets, wrapping Marjorie in layers to keep the chill at bay. She pushes her mother through the narrow hallway and out into the garden, where the late autumn sun bathes the world in a golden glow. The air is crisp, filled with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, and Clara feels a strange sense of peace settle over her.\n\nMarjorie breathes in deeply, her eyes scanning the familiar landscape. The garden is past its prime, the flowers wilted and the branches bare, but there is a beauty in the decay, a quiet dignity in the way the world prepares for winter.\n\nClara wheels her mother to the old wooden bench under the maple tree, its leaves a brilliant tapestry of reds and golds. She sits beside her, their hands still entwined, and they watch the world together, the silence between them filled with unspoken memories.\n\nFor a while, they sit in companionable silence, the only sounds the rustling of leaves and the distant chirping of birds. Clara feels a warmth spread through her, a sense of connection that transcends words. It is as if the garden itself is holding them, cradling them in its embrace, offering a kind of solace that she hadn\u2019t realized she needed.\n\nMarjorie turns to her, her eyes filled with a mixture of gratitude and sadness. \u201cThank you, Clara,\u201d she says, her voice trembling. \u201cFor everything.\u201d\n\nClara squeezes her mother\u2019s hand, her own heart aching with the weight of all the things she cannot say. She looks around the garden, taking in the details\u2014the way the sunlight filters through the leaves, the intricate patterns of the spider webs glistening with dew, the gentle sway of the grass in the breeze. It is a moment of clarity, a reminder that even in the face of loss, there is beauty and light.\n\nIn the days that follow, Clara finds herself drawn to the garden more and more. She spends hours there, tending to the plants, raking leaves, and preparing the soil for the winter. It becomes a ritual, a way to connect with her mother\u2019s spirit, to feel her presence in the place she had loved so deeply.\n\nMarjorie\u2019s decline is gradual but inevitable, and Clara feels the weight of each passing day. She continues to read to her mother, to sit by her side, and to hold her hand through the long nights. The word \"hospice\" no longer feels like a sentence but a gentle guide, leading them through the final chapter with grace.\n\nOne crisp morning, as the first frost dusts the garden in a delicate shimmer, Marjorie slips away. Clara is by her side, her hand still entwined with her mother\u2019s, and she feels a profound stillness settle over her. It is a moment of both grief and release, a quiet ending to a life well-lived.\n\nIn the weeks that follow, Clara finds herself returning to the garden, drawn to its quiet resilience. She plants new seeds, tending to them with care, and watches as they begin to sprout, tiny green shoots pushing through the cold earth. It is a reminder of the cycles of life, of the way hope can be found even in the darkest of times.\n\nAnd so, in the space where hope had seemed to vanish, Clara discovers a new kind of light\u2014a gentle, enduring presence that carries her forward, one day at a time. The garden becomes her sanctuary, a place of healing and remembrance, where the memory of her mother lives on in the whisper of the wind and the bloom of every flower.",
        "story_b": "The morning rounds at Saint Miriam\u2019s Hospice began as they always did, with Nurse Emily weaving through the corridors, her steps soft against the linoleum, her voice a gentle murmur in the quietude. The patients awaited her arrival, some with expectant eyes, others with resignation. The word \u201chospice\u201d was a whisper in the air, its presence undeniable, like a shadow that lingered even in the brightest rooms.\n\n\u201cHow are you feeling today?\u201d Emily asked as she entered each room, the question a thread connecting her to those she cared for. It was a ritual, almost sacred in its repetition. For Gerald, the elderly man with thinning hair and eyes that once sparkled with mischief, the response was always the same: \u201cI\u2019m just waiting.\u201d His voice carried the weight of his years, each word heavy with the life he had lived.\n\nIn the room next door, Mrs. Alvarez clutched a faded photograph, her fingers tracing the outlines of her children. \u201cIt\u2019s just hospice,\u201d she would say, her voice barely above a whisper, as if speaking it aloud might make it more real. Her daughter, Ana, sat by her side, her hands restless in her lap. \u201cIs there anything more we can do?\u201d she asked Emily, desperation threading her words. Emily\u2019s reply was steady, practiced: \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can.\u201d\n\nThe routine was comforting in its predictability, yet beneath it simmered a tension, a knowing that each day could bring the unexpected. The hospice was a place of waiting, of moments suspended between hope and acceptance. Emily had learned to navigate this liminal space, her heart attuned to the unspoken needs of her patients.\n\nAs she moved through the building, Emily paused at room seven. Inside, a young woman named Clara lay amidst a sea of white sheets, her breath a fragile thing. Her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, hovered nearby, their faces etched with exhaustion and love. \u201cIt\u2019s just hospice,\u201d Mr. Thompson muttered, his voice thick with finality. Emily offered him a smile, small but sincere, a lighthouse in the fog of their grief.\n\n\u201cHow are you feeling today, Clara?\u201d Emily asked, her voice a gentle coaxing. Clara\u2019s eyes flickered open, a faint smile ghosting across her lips. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said, the words a surprise, even to herself. In that moment, the air shifted, the heaviness lifting ever so slightly, like a curtain drawn back to reveal a sliver of light.\n\nThe words echoed through the hospice, a ripple of change that touched each room. Gerald, upon hearing the news, sat a little straighter in his bed. \u201cReady,\u201d he repeated to himself, the syllables rolling off his tongue like a prayer. Mrs. Alvarez, too, seemed to find solace in the words, her grip on the photograph relaxing as she exhaled a long-held breath. Ana watched her mother, a flicker of understanding passing between them.\n\nEmily continued her rounds, the mantra of \u201cHow are you feeling today?\u201d now carrying a newfound resonance. She lingered in each room, her presence a balm. The word \u201chospice\u201d began to shift, its meaning evolving from a place of finality to one of quiet acceptance. It was still a space where life waned, but now it was also a place where life was honored, each moment cherished.\n\nIn the days that followed, Clara\u2019s words continued to echo, their impact profound. The patients and their families began to see the hospice not as an end, but as a space where love lingered, where memories were woven into the fabric of the walls. The staff noticed the change, too, their interactions with patients and families carrying a gentle warmth, a shared understanding of what it meant to be truly present.\n\nOne afternoon, as the sun dipped low on the horizon, casting long shadows through the hospice windows, Emily found herself sitting with Gerald. They talked of small things: the weather, the birds outside his window, the stories of his youth. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d Gerald said, his voice thoughtful. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m ready, too.\u201d His words were not of resignation, but of peace, a quiet acceptance of what was to come.\n\nIn another room, Mrs. Alvarez and Ana sat in silence, their hands entwined. \u201cIt\u2019s a place of peace,\u201d Ana whispered, her voice a tender caress. Her mother nodded, a soft smile playing on her lips. The photograph lay beside them, a testament to a life well-lived, to love enduring beyond the confines of time.\n\nAs Emily prepared to leave for the day, she paused in the hallway, her heart full. The hospice, with its quiet corridors and rooms filled with stories, had transformed. It was a place where hope had not vanished, but had simply taken on a new form, a gentler light that illuminated the path for those who found themselves within its walls.\n\nThe next morning, as Emily began her rounds, the familiar question fell from her lips with ease. \u201cHow are you feeling today?\u201d she asked, and the responses came, each one a testament to the journey they were all on together. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d they said, or \u201cI\u2019m at peace,\u201d or simply \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nIn the end, it was not about the destination, but the journey, the moments of connection that defined their days. The hospice was still a place of waiting, but now it was also a sanctuary, a haven where love and light intertwined, creating a tapestry of hope and acceptance.\n\nEmily moved from room to room, her heart a quiet drumbeat in the symphony of life that surrounded her. The word \u201chospice\u201d had become something more, a place not of endings, but of beginnings, each day a new chapter in the story of those who found themselves within its embrace.",

        "story_a": "When the word \"hospice\" is first spoken, it feels like the air itself changes, heavy with finality. The syllables linger in the room, almost visible, as if they have weight and shape, settling over the furniture, the bed, and the person lying in it. Clara hears it and feels an almost imperceptible shift in the universe, a closing door. It\u2019s her mother, Marjorie, who the doctor is addressing, but the word reverberates through Clara\u2019s own heart, a dull thud of inevitability.\n\nMarjorie stares at the doctor with a mix of resignation and defiance, her once-vibrant green eyes now clouded by the long battle with illness. She nods slowly, her lips pressed into a thin line, and then looks away, out the window where a soft autumn rain begins to fall. Clara watches her mother\u2019s profile, the sharp lines softened by the afternoon light, and feels a pang of something she cannot name.\n\nThey return home, the word \"hospice\" now a silent companion that follows them through the days. Clara finds herself moving through the motions of care with an urgency that surprises her. She arranges visits from the nurses, fills out forms, and talks in hushed tones with her mother\u2019s friends, who come bearing casseroles and quiet condolences.\n\nIn the evenings, after the house has settled into its own kind of weary quiet, Clara sits by her mother\u2019s bedside, reading aloud from old favorites\u2014books they had shared during long summer afternoons when she was a child. Marjorie listens with her eyes closed, a faint smile playing at the corners of her mouth, her breath shallow but steady. It is in these moments that Clara feels the weight of loss most acutely, the slow erosion of time slipping through their fingers.\n\nOne evening, as the fire in the hearth crackles and the shadows lengthen, Marjorie opens her eyes and reaches for Clara\u2019s hand. Her touch is light, almost ethereal, and Clara feels a sudden rush of tears she struggles to hold back.\n\n\u201cClara,\u201d Marjorie says softly, her voice barely a whisper. \u201cDo you remember the garden?\u201d\n\nClara nods, unable to speak. The garden had been Marjorie\u2019s sanctuary, a riot of color and life where she had spent countless hours tending to roses, tulips, and wildflowers. It had been Clara\u2019s playground, a place of wonder and discovery, where she had learned the names of plants and the rhythms of nature.\n\n\u201cI want to see it,\u201d Marjorie says, her eyes shining with a faint glimmer of the old spark. \u201cOne last time.\u201d\n\nClara hesitates, the practical part of her mind already listing the reasons why it might be impossible. But then she sees the determination in her mother\u2019s gaze, the unspoken plea, and she nods.\n\nThe next morning, Clara arranges for a wheelchair and blankets, wrapping Marjorie in layers to keep the chill at bay. She pushes her mother through the narrow hallway and out into the garden, where the late autumn sun bathes the world in a golden glow. The air is crisp, filled with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, and Clara feels a strange sense of peace settle over her.\n\nMarjorie breathes in deeply, her eyes scanning the familiar landscape. The garden is past its prime, the flowers wilted and the branches bare, but there is a beauty in the decay, a quiet dignity in the way the world prepares for winter.\n\nClara wheels her mother to the old wooden bench under the maple tree, its leaves a brilliant tapestry of reds and golds. She sits beside her, their hands still entwined, and they watch the world together, the silence between them filled with unspoken memories.\n\nFor a while, they sit in companionable silence, the only sounds the rustling of leaves and the distant chirping of birds. Clara feels a warmth spread through her, a sense of connection that transcends words. It is as if the garden itself is holding them, cradling them in its embrace, offering a kind of solace that she hadn\u2019t realized she needed.\n\nMarjorie turns to her, her eyes filled with a mixture of gratitude and sadness. \u201cThank you, Clara,\u201d she says, her voice trembling. \u201cFor everything.\u201d\n\nClara squeezes her mother\u2019s hand, her own heart aching with the weight of all the things she cannot say. She looks around the garden, taking in the details\u2014the way the sunlight filters through the leaves, the intricate patterns of the spider webs glistening with dew, the gentle sway of the grass in the breeze. It is a moment of clarity, a reminder that even in the face of loss, there is beauty and light.\n\nIn the days that follow, Clara finds herself drawn to the garden more and more. She spends hours there, tending to the plants, raking leaves, and preparing the soil for the winter. It becomes a ritual, a way to connect with her mother\u2019s spirit, to feel her presence in the place she had loved so deeply.\n\nMarjorie\u2019s decline is gradual but inevitable, and Clara feels the weight of each passing day. She continues to read to her mother, to sit by her side, and to hold her hand through the long nights. The word \"hospice\" no longer feels like a sentence but a gentle guide, leading them through the final chapter with grace.\n\nOne crisp morning, as the first frost dusts the garden in a delicate shimmer, Marjorie slips away. Clara is by her side, her hand still entwined with her mother\u2019s, and she feels a profound stillness settle over her. It is a moment of both grief and release, a quiet ending to a life well-lived.\n\nIn the weeks that follow, Clara finds herself returning to the garden, drawn to its quiet resilience. She plants new seeds, tending to them with care, and watches as they begin to sprout, tiny green shoots pushing through the cold earth. It is a reminder of the cycles of life, of the way hope can be found even in the darkest of times.\n\nAnd so, in the space where hope had seemed to vanish, Clara discovers a new kind of light\u2014a gentle, enduring presence that carries her forward, one day at a time. The garden becomes her sanctuary, a place of healing and remembrance, where the memory of her mother lives on in the whisper of the wind and the bloom of every flower.",
        "story_b": "\u201cHospice.\u201d The doctor\u2019s voice was soft, yet the word cut through the room like a chisel. Everyone stopped, the air itself seemed to halt, heavy with an unspoken understanding. The family sat in a semicircle, their expressions shifting from disbelief to acceptance, and then, slowly, settling into a quiet resolve. Mary, who had been dabbing her eyes with a tissue, felt the weight of the word settle in her chest, anchoring her to her chair.\n\nThe room, a small, sunlit corner of the hospital, suddenly felt suffocating. Outside, the world continued with its oblivious bustle, but inside, time seemed to pause. It was Mary\u2019s father, Harold, who broke the silence first. His voice was unexpectedly steady. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI suppose that\u2019s that, then.\u201d But his eyes, usually so sharp and mischievous, were now clouded with a mixture of fear and acceptance.\n\nThe doctor, a kind-faced woman with gentle hands and a calm demeanor, nodded. \u201cThere\u2019s still time, Mr. Thompson. Time for moments that matter. Hospice isn\u2019t the end; it\u2019s about the quality of life.\u201d\n\nMary wanted to believe her. She looked around the room, at her brothers who sat stoically, and her mother, who seemed to shrink into herself. The air was thick, but as the doctor spoke, Mary noticed a thin beam of sunlight filtering through the window, dust particles dancing in its glow. It was a gentle reminder that light could pierce even the heaviest of shadows.\n\nIn the days that followed, Mary found herself returning to that image, the sunlight breaking through. The hospice center, where her father was moved, was a place of serene acceptance. The corridors were quiet, filled with the soft hum of medical equipment, and the gentle rustle of curtains as they swayed with each passing breeze. There was a garden outside, vibrant with autumn colors, where Mary often found solace.\n\nHer father, despite the circumstances, retained his dry humor. \u201cLooks like I\u2019ve got a one-way ticket,\u201d he joked one afternoon, winking at Mary. She chuckled, albeit with tears in her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare make that your stand-up routine,\u201d she replied, her voice catching in her throat.\n\nThe nurses were a balm to her frayed nerves. One in particular, Nurse Jill, seemed to have a knack for lightening the atmosphere. She would come in with a story or a joke, her laughter bright and contagious. \u201cWhy did the scarecrow win an award?\u201d she asked one day, as she adjusted Harold\u2019s pillows. \u201cBecause he was outstanding in his field!\u201d Even Harold, who had heard it before, couldn\u2019t help but smile.\n\nMary marveled at how these small acts of kindness, these moments of levity, could lift the weight that had settled over them. The hospice was not just a place of endings, but also of unexpected beginnings\u2014connections and reflections that might never have happened otherwise.\n\nOne afternoon, as Mary sat by her father\u2019s bedside, he turned to her, his eyes clear and focused. \u201cDo you remember the summer we built that treehouse?\u201d he asked suddenly. Mary nodded, a smile tugging at her lips. \u201cYou insisted on painting it bright blue,\u201d she recalled. \u201cSaid it would match the sky.\u201d\n\nHarold chuckled, a soft, rasping sound. \u201cIt was the most crooked thing I ever built, but you loved it anyway.\u201d They sat in silence for a moment, the memory wrapping around them like a warm blanket. Outside, the garden shimmered in the late afternoon sun, the colors vivid and alive.\n\nAs the days passed, Mary found herself drawn to the garden more often. It was here that she encountered a scene that seemed almost magical. A patient, an elderly woman with silver hair, sat in her wheelchair, eyes closed, a serene smile on her lips. Around her, in her mind\u2019s eye, the garden transformed into a vibrant tapestry of colors and sounds. She imagined it alive with laughter and the voices of loved ones long gone.\n\nMary watched, entranced, as the woman\u2019s face lit up with an inner joy, untouched by the shadows of her surroundings. It was a moment that seemed to transcend reality, a reminder that even in the face of finality, there could be beauty and light.\n\nInspired, Mary began to bring small tokens of brightness into her father\u2019s room. She placed fresh flowers on the windowsill, their colors bright against the stark white of the walls. She brought books filled with his favorite stories, reading to him in the quiet hours of the afternoon. And always, there was music\u2014soft, soothing melodies that filled the room with warmth.\n\nHer father, too, found solace in these simple pleasures. He would listen intently as Mary read, his eyes closed, a faint smile on his lips. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d find peace here,\u201d he admitted one evening, \u201cbut somehow, I do.\u201d His words were a balm to Mary\u2019s aching heart, a testament to the power of light in the darkest of times.\n\nAs the days turned to weeks, the weight of the initial word\u2014hospice\u2014began to lift, replaced by a gentle acceptance. Mary learned to cherish the moments, the laughter, and even the tears, for they were a testament to the life her father had lived.\n\nOn a crisp autumn morning, as the leaves danced in the breeze outside the window, Harold took his last breath. The room was filled with a profound stillness, yet there was also a sense of peace. Mary sat beside him, holding his hand, feeling the warmth of the sun on her face. She knew, in that moment, that the light had not vanished but had simply transformed, leaving behind a glow that would guide her in the days to come.\n\nIn the quiet aftermath, as Mary stepped into the garden, she understood that hope was not a fleeting thing. It was a constant, like the sunlight that broke through the clouds, a gentle reminder that even in the shadow of loss, life continued in all its beauty and complexity.",

        "ground_truth": "\u201cHospice.\u201d\n\nOnce the word is uttered aloud, there is a seismic shift. You will feel it.\n\n\nLike a (very short) thread through the eye of a needle, swiftly in and swiftly out.\n\nThe air itself becomes thin, steely.\n\nAt the periphery of your vision, an immediate dimming. The penumbra begins to shrink. In time, it will become a tunnel. Ever diminishing. Until the remaining light is small enough to be cupped in two hands. And then it will be extinguished.\n\nFor when \u201chospice\u201d is spoken, the fact is at last acknowledged: There is no hope.\n\nNo hope. These words are obscene, unspeakable. To be without hope is to be without a future.\n\nWorse, by acknowledging that you are without a future, you have \u201cgiven up.\u201d\n\nAnd so when the word \u201chospice\u201d is first spoken\u2014carefully, cautiously, by a (female) palliative-care physician\u2014neither of you hears it. Or, if you hear it, you don\u2019t register that you have heard.\n\nA low-grade buzzing in the ears, a ringing, as of a distant alarm, an alarm in a shuttered room. That is all.\n\nFor if you don\u2019t hear, perhaps it has not (yet) been uttered.\n\nFor if neither of you hears, perhaps it will not (ever) be uttered.\n\nYet somehow it happens: \u201chospice\u201d comes to be more frequently spoken as the days pass.\n\nAnd somehow it happens that your husband, surprising himself, begins to speak of his \u201cfinal days.\u201d As in, \u201cI think these might be my final days.\u201d\n\nAs if shyly. On the phone very early one morning, when he calls, as he has been calling, immediately after the oncologist making rounds in the hospital has examined him.\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\nOn the phone, so that he is spared seeing your face. And you, his.\n\nA new shyness like the first, initial shyness. Finding some way to say I love you.\n\nFor some, an impossible statement\u2014I love you.\n\nBut your husband managed it, and you managed it, somehow: I love you.\n\nAnd now, years later, it is \u201cI think these might be my final days.\u201d\n\nThese words you hear over the phone distinctly, irrevocably, yet (you would claim) you have not heard them. No!\n\nBut, yes, you\u2019ve heard. Must have heard. For the walls of the room reel giddily around you, blood rushes out of your head, leaving you faint, sinking to your knees like a terrified child, stammering, \u201cWhat? What are you saying? That\u2019s ridiculous. Don\u2019t say such things! What on earth do you mean\u2014\u2018final days\u2019?\u201d\n\nYour voice rises wildly. You want to fling the cell phone from you.\n\nFor you can\u2019t bear it. You don\u2019t think so. Not knowing, at this time, the vast Sahara that lies ahead with all that you cannot bear, that nonetheless will be borne, and by you.\n\nFor always, each step of the way, you resist.\n\nIt is a steep uphill. It is natural to resist. Or, if you accept the steep climb, console yourself with the thought that it is only temporary. The plateau, the flatland to which you\u2019ve been accustomed, awaits you, both of you. You will return there. Soon.\n\nUntil a day, an hour\u2014always there is a day, an hour\u2014when you began to speak of hospice yourself.\n\nAt first, you, too, are shy, faltering. Your throat feels lacerated as if by metal filings.\n\nGradually, you learn to utter the two syllables clearly, bravely\u2014hos-pice.\n\nSoon after that, you begin to say these distinct, deliberate words: \u201cour hospice.\u201d\n\nSoon, you draw up your vows. Quaintly state to yourself, as if to God, a formal decree.\n\nIt is my hope: I will make of our hospice a honeymoon.\n\nMy vow is to make my husband as comfortable as humanly possible.\n\nTo make him happy. To make us both happy.\n\nTo fulfill whatever he wishes that is within the range of possibility.\n\nFirst: a new setting for him. NOT the Cancer Center. Our hospice will be in our home, which he loves.\n\nThe atrium flooded with morning light.\n\nThe foreshortened horizon\u2014for the house is surrounded by trees.\n\nThe flotillas of sculpted clouds.\n\nMy husband can lie on a sofa, staring at the tree line and at the sky. Comfortable on the sofa with pillows behind him and feet (in warm socks) elevated.\n\nOr, more likely, he can lie on a (rented) hospital bed, positioned in such a way that he can easily gaze out the window. And I can lie beside him, as I have done in the hospital.\n\nHolding hands. Of course, we will hold hands. His hands are still warm\u2014strong. His fingers, when squeezed, never fail to squeeze in return.\n\nAs his lips, when kissed, never fail to kiss in return.\n\nI will sleep beside my husband holding him in my arms, not strong arms, in fact, rather weak arms, which nonetheless can be made to behave as if they were strong.\n\nI will scatter seed on the redwood deck outside the window. Not ordinary seed but the more expensive \u201cwild bird seed\u201d my husband purchases.\n\nThrilling to watch the birds. Taking the time, undistracted, really watching, for once . . .\n\nAnd my husband loves music! I will bathe him in the most beautiful music through his waking hours. So long as it is not uncomfortable for him, I will lie on the bed beside him, holding him, listening with him to Beethoven\u2019s \u201cOde to Joy,\u201d Rachmaninoff\u2019s \u201cVespers.\u201d\n\n\nFalling asleep with him. Even during the day. Even with wan sunshine slanting through the window onto our faces. Head on the pillow beside his head.\n\nFrom the bookcases in the house, I will select art books, his favorite artists, books from his photography shelves\u2014Bruce Davidson, Edward Weston, Diane Arbus, Eliot Porter.

        "story_b": "In the hospice, days unfolded like pages in a tattered book, worn at the edges from the repeated turning of chapters that promised little change. The air, thick with antiseptic and whispered regrets, shifted subtly the first time the word \"hospice\" was spoken, as if the walls themselves absorbed its weight, bowing slightly inward, holding secrets of both despair and quiet resolve.\n\nAnother day, another round. Nurse Evelyn moved through the corridors with the practiced grace of one who had long since learned to navigate the tightrope of empathy and detachment. The hospice was a place of transitions, and she had witnessed many\u2014a last breath, a reconciliatory embrace, a tearful goodbye. Each room held its own story, and Evelyn was part keeper, part witness.\n\n\"How are we feeling today?\" she asked in a soft, rhythmic cadence as she entered Room 4, where Mr. Harper lay, his form barely disturbing the white expanse of the bed. His eyes, clouded with resignation yet flickering with a stubborn spark of hope, met hers. They had their routine, Mr. Harper and Evelyn. Each morning, she would ask, and each morning he would respond with the same wry smile, \"Still here.\"\n\nMr. Harper's son, David, visited every Sunday, his presence a reluctant duty wrapped in love and regret. He sat by the window, staring out at the garden that stretched beyond the glass, vibrant even in winter, as if mocking the sterility within. Evelyn had seen him there many times, his profile etched with a quiet determination, struggling to find words that wouldn\u2019t come.\n\nThe misunderstanding began with a silence\u2014Mr. Harper's silence. It was the previous Sunday when David, in a moment of frustration, had pleaded, \"Dad, do you want me to make arrangements? Is this what you want?\" And in the heavy quiet that followed, he had taken the silence as consent, as acceptance.\n\nBut Evelyn knew better. That evening, as she tidied the room, she found the letter\u2014hidden beneath a stack of well-worn books, its envelope yellowed with age. Inside, Mr. Harper had scrawled his desires, his fears, and his love in a shaky hand. \"I want to see the ocean again,\" it read. \"I want to feel the sand, hear the waves. I want to remember how it was to live.\"\n\nThe discovery of the letter became a turning point\u2014a moment when the routine shattered, revealing raw, unspoken truths. Evelyn held the letter in her hand, its weight surprisingly light yet burdened with Mr. Harper's unfulfilled dreams. She knew she had to act, to bring light into a place where hope seemed to have vanished.\n\nThe next Sunday, David arrived, his expression a mask of weary expectation. Evelyn approached him gently, the letter carefully tucked into her pocket. \"David,\" she began, \"there's something you should see.\" She led him to a quiet room where they could talk undisturbed.\n\nAs David unfolded the letter, his face transformed, the mask slipping away to reveal a mixture of shock and sorrow. \"I didn\u2019t know,\" he whispered, his voice cracking. \"I thought he had given up.\"\n\nEvelyn placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder. \"He hasn't,\" she said softly. \"There's still time.\"\n\nTogether, they devised a plan\u2014a final journey, a chance to fulfill Mr. Harper's wish. It was risky, perhaps even foolish, but David was resolute. Hope, once a distant memory, began to take shape, fragile yet persistent.\n\nOn a chilly morning, under a sky that promised rain, Evelyn and David wheeled Mr. Harper through the hospice doors, his frail body bundled in blankets. He watched the world unfold around him with a childlike wonder, his eyes wide with anticipation. The drive to the coast was long, the hours passing in a blur of conversation and silence, punctuated by the hum of the engine and the rhythmic beat of the windshield wipers.\n\nWhen they arrived, the sea stretched before them, vast and endless, its waves crashing against the shore with a ferocity that seemed to echo Mr. Harper's own struggle. David lifted his father from the wheelchair, supporting him as they made their way to the water's edge. Mr. Harper's feet sank into the sand, the grains cool and familiar.\n\nEvelyn watched from a distance, her heart swelling with an unfamiliar warmth. It was a rare moment of triumph, a reminder that even in places shrouded in darkness, light could be found.\n\nMr. Harper stood at the edge of the world, the ocean before him a testament to life\u2019s enduring beauty. The wind whipped through his hair, and he laughed\u2014a sound so full of joy that it startled even him. He turned to David, his eyes brimming with gratitude. \"Thank you,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"For everything.\"\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the water, Evelyn knew they had created something extraordinary\u2014a memory that would linger long after Mr. Harper was gone. In that moment, hope was not just an abstract concept but a tangible force, binding them together in a shared understanding of life's fragility and its fleeting joys.\n\nReturning to the hospice, the journey felt different. The routine would resume, the rounds and the questions, the quiet moments and the unsaid goodbyes. But something had changed. The air, once heavy with finality, now held a promise\u2014a whisper of hope, stubborn and enduring.\n\nIn the days that followed, Mr. Harper's condition worsened, the inevitable march of time relentless. Yet there was a peace about him, a contentment that had not been there before. He spoke often of the ocean, of the waves and the sand, recounting the experience to anyone who would listen.\n\nEvelyn continued her rounds, her presence a constant in the ever-changing landscape of the hospice. She learned to see the light in unexpected places\u2014a shared smile, a gentle touch, a moment of connection. In the hospice, where hope seemed to have vanished, she had discovered that it was never truly gone, only waiting to be rekindled.\n\nThe day Mr. Harper passed, the sky was overcast, the garden outside a riot of colors. David was there, holding his father's hand, the letter tucked safely in his pocket. Evelyn stood quietly at the door, her heart heavy yet uplifted, knowing they had done everything they could. In the hospice, where life and death danced closely together, light had found a way to shine through.",

You know...despite its hardships -deadly mutants trying to kill you, rival scavenger gangs trying to kill you, the Spice trying to kill you- it could be a *very* beautiful place during a sunset. The way the sun sinks beneath the horizon as you look out into the desert. The way the Spice in the air gives the orange and purple-tinted sky almost a....*magical* feeling! The mutant coyotes, somewhere in the distance, gently howling the song of their people. Sometimes, the sunset gets so peaceful and quiet that one would almost...forget...that they were in the Wasteland, where everything, even the sand itself, tries to kill you. Ah...the simple beauty in life... NOPE. **ACID RAIN.** Almost twice a year did it ever rain in West Virginia. And today was one of those days! And if you thought that rain in the Wasteland was anything like rain nearly 200 years ago, boy were you mistaken! The rain was...*acid rain*. Real...acid rain. Acid rain that if you dared to stick your naked, unprotected head under it, you were walking away without hair. And if you dared to look *up* or -Spice forbid- try to catch the *acid raindrops* onto your tongue, you're...basically walking away looking like the Joker. And where was our newly-formed, green in the gills, positively *itching* to start their pirate adventure, crew right now?? Bus stop. Thankfully the buildings, any coverings, and the bus stops, were made with lead (because *that* was safe!) to withstand the acid! So that's where the crew was. All stuffed into a smallish, lead-topped, glass-walled, graffiti'd, bus stop. Some sat on the grimy bench, others stood around or sat on the floor where the acid rain couldn't reach them. Their fearless captain, Petey Flynn, sat back, legs stretched out in front of him, on the far side of the bench. Next to his first mate, Voodood. Petey sighed and reached into his pocket, taking out a *centuries-old*, small, Nokia phone, in more or less pristine condition. He dialed a number and put it up to his ear. It picked up after a few rings. \"Heeeyyyy Genie-Bean!\", Petey crooned over the sounds of acid rain into the phone. \"Peter. Pinkie-Pie. Flynn.\", came, expectantly, from the other end of the line. And then Gina silently waited for the rest. It had only been a *week* since Petey set out on his 'Portal Gun pirate adventure', and has somehow, in one week, acquired a crew. They were set to depart *today morning*. So the fact that he was calling her could not *possibly* mean anything good. \"Soooo.....\", Petey continued after a glance over at Voodood, and then the rest of his crew,\"....we kiiiiinda....sorta.....*lost* the ship.\" \"YOU WHA--\" \"--It's okay! It's okay!\", Petey sat up, \"We *know* where it is! Or or...rather *who has it*! And it's....it's *Buster*. The Hermit Crabs took our ship. --Stole! *Stole* our ship.\" The *longest*, most drawn out sigh came from Gina's side of the line. \"Your....*pirate ship*...\", she clarified, \"....was....*pirated*...by the Hermit Crabs?\" \"Yeeahhhh. I mean if you really think about it, it was *such* a funny stor--\" **CLICK.** Petey blinked down at the phone. She hung up. He turned to rest of his crew, surprisingly *very* nonchalant about the whole thing. And gave them a shrug, sitting back once again. \"It's okay guys, she'll call back! I'm sure she's comin' up with a *plan* for us as we speak!\", he paused to look at each and every person at that bus stop, \"...Man, can you *believe* it's already been a week since we all met? Feels like *just yesterday* Dood saved me from that other time the Crabs jumped me....\" Seeming to quite literally be content with waiting for his sister to *maybe* call him back with a plan, Petey's eyes glazed over with recollection of that week during which they all met.",
        "story_a": "The sky wept with a venomous deluge, each raindrop hissing as it struck the cracked pavement. The acrid scent of burning chemicals permeated the air, mingling with the earthy odor of damp concrete. A cacophony of pattering rain and distant thunder reverberated through the graffiti-covered bus stop, where the remnants of the notorious pirate crew, the Storm Serpents, huddled together in a tenuous sanctuary.\n\nCaptain Sable, a woman whose commanding presence belied her petite stature, stood at the edge of the shelter, her dark eyes scanning the horizon with a mixture of fury and desperation. Her once pristine tricorn hat now drooped miserably, dripping with the noxious rain. She clenched a weathered Nokia phone in one hand, its ancient keypad slick with moisture. The screen glowed dimly, casting an eerie light on her determined face.\n\n\"We can\u2019t stay here forever,\" growled Flint, the burly first mate whose scarred visage looked even more menacing in the flickering light. He shifted restlessly, his broad shoulders barely fitting beneath the narrow awning. \"The Hermit Crabs have our ship. And if we don\u2019t act fast, they\u2019ll strip her down to the bones.\"\n\nAround them, the rest of the crew murmured in uneasy agreement. There was Marlowe, the lithe navigator with a penchant for getting lost in his own thoughts, and Lila, the sharp-tongued quartermaster whose quick wit was second only to her lethal aim. And then there was Jinx, the youngest and unluckiest of the lot, whose very presence seemed to attract misfortune like iron filings to a magnet.\n\nJinx shuffled his feet nervously, glancing up at the sky as if expecting it to rain fire next. \"But how do we even start looking for them?\" he asked, his voice trembling. \"We don\u2019t have any weapons, no transport, and that phone\u2019s older than dirt.\"\n\nCaptain Sable\u2019s grip tightened on the Nokia. \"This phone,\" she said, her voice steely, \"is our only lifeline. And we\u2019re going to use it to call in a favor.\"\n\nLila raised an eyebrow, her skepticism evident. \"A favor? From who? Most of our so-called friends would sooner slit our throats than help us.\"\n\nSable\u2019s lips curled into a tight smile. \"Not this one. There\u2019s a fence named Rook who owes me. Big time. If anyone knows the Hermit Crabs\u2019 movements, it\u2019s him.\"\n\nThe crew exchanged glances, a spark of hope igniting in their eyes. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was a start. Sable dialed the number with practiced fingers, the tone ringing out like a beacon in the storm. After an agonizing pause, the call connected.\n\n\"Sable,\" a gravelly voice answered, laced with suspicion. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Rook, I need information,\" Sable replied, her tone brooking no argument. \"The Hermit Crabs stole our ship. Where are they headed?\"\n\nThere was a rustle of papers, a muffled curse. \"You\u2019re in luck,\" Rook said grudgingly. \"They\u2019ve been laying low in the old shipyard by the docks. But you didn\u2019t hear it from me.\"\n\nSable ended the call, her eyes gleaming with renewed determination. \"To the docks, then,\" she declared. \"We\u2019ll take back what\u2019s ours.\"\n\nThe crew nodded, a newfound resolve settling over them. The acid rain continued to pour, but it couldn\u2019t extinguish the fire in their hearts. They moved as one, leaving the dilapidated bus stop behind, their silhouettes merging with the shadows of the storm.\n\nThe journey to the docks was fraught with peril. The city was a labyrinth of crumbling buildings and deserted streets, each step echoing with the threat of danger. But the Storm Serpents pressed on, driven by the promise of reclaiming their stolen ship.\n\nAs they neared the shipyard, Flint\u2019s keen eyes spotted movement. \"There,\" he whispered, pointing to a cluster of figures skulking around the rusted hulls. The Hermit Crabs, oblivious to their approach.\n\nSable signaled for silence, her mind racing with a plan. They had the element of surprise, and with it, a chance to turn the tide. \"On my mark,\" she breathed, her voice barely audible over the storm.\n\nThe crew tensed, every muscle coiled and ready. The moment stretched, the air thick with anticipation. And then, with a fierce cry, Sable led the charge, her crew following close behind.\n\nThe battle was swift and brutal, a clash of wills and desperation. The Hermit Crabs, caught off guard, fell back under the relentless assault. Sable\u2019s crew fought with the ferocity of those with nothing left to lose, reclaiming their ship inch by hard-fought inch.\n\nWhen the dust finally settled, the Storm Serpents stood victorious, their ship once more beneath their feet. The rain had begun to let up, the sky lightening with the promise of a new dawn. Sable looked around at her crew, battered but unbroken, and allowed herself a rare smile.\n\n\"Our adventure begins anew,\" she said, her voice ringing with triumph. \"Let\u2019s set sail.\"",
        "story_b": "\"Ain't no storm like an acid rainstorm to test a pirate's mettle, or so they say,\" Captain Barnacle grumbled, tugging the brim of his sodden hat down over his eyes. Around him, his crew of misfits huddled beneath the scant shelter of a graffiti-covered bus stop, trying vainly to dodge raindrops like cannonballs. The vibrant graffiti, depicting sea monsters and treasure maps, seemed to mock their current landlocked predicament.\n\n\"Blimey, this ain't no place for a pirate!\" wailed Salty Pete, the crew\u2019s grizzled navigator, who was futilely attempting to use his trusty sextant to chart a course through the rain. Each drop splattered off the brass device, and Pete squinted into the storm with a look of grim determination.\n\nNext to him, Mad Mabel, the ship\u2019s cook, was optimistically holding a pot out into the downpour. \"Soup\u2019s on, lads!\" she chirped, her apron now a soggy mess. \"Who knew acid rain could sting worse than a jellyfish?\"\n\nThe rest of the crew shuffled around, trying to keep spirits high despite their soggy situation. Meanwhile, Captain Barnacle paced, his boots sloshing in the growing puddle beneath the shelter. \"Where's me ship?\" he barked, glaring at the distant harbor now shrouded in a misty veil of rain. \"Who could\u2019ve made off with the Barnacle Beauty?\"\n\nIt was then that One-Eyed Jack, the lookout, pulled from his pocket an artifact of the modern age\u2014a Nokia phone, as ancient and indestructible as any pirate's cutlass. \"Cap\u2019n,\" he said, waving the phone like a treasure map, \"I found this where the Beauty was last anchored.\"\n\nBarnacle snatched the phone, peering at the glowing screen with suspicion. \"What sorcery be this?\" he muttered, poking at the buttons with a calloused finger. The screen lit up with a cryptic message from the Hermit Crabs. \n\n\"To the salty seadogs who dared park in our turf,\" it read, \"Your ship now belongs to the Hermit Crabs. We\u2019ll be waitin\u2019 at the Old Lighthouse. Come if you dare.\"\n\nThe crew erupted into a cacophony of disbelief and outrage. \"Hermit Crabs!\" Salty Pete spat. \"Those scallywags! Stealin' ships like it\u2019s a game!\"\n\n\"Speaking of games,\" piped up Gamer Gary, the youngest crew member, who was an avid fan of pirate-themed video games. \"I reckon we can use this here Nokia\u2019s map feature like in 'PlunderQuest'! We follow the dot to the lighthouse!\"\n\nBarnacle squinted at the pixelated map, which seemed to depict a route only slightly less confusing than a treasure map drawn by a drunken sailor. \"Right, lads and lass,\" he declared, attempting to exude confidence. \"Let\u2019s reclaim the Barnacle Beauty!\"\n\nWith renewed purpose, the crew sallied forth into the rain-soaked streets, sprinting through puddles like a pack of wet dogs. They followed the Nokia\u2019s map, though more than once they ended up down alleyways leading nowhere but to more graffiti and soggy cardboard boxes.\n\nFinally, after several wrong turns and a brief encounter with a very confused raccoon, they found themselves before the towering silhouette of the Old Lighthouse. The Hermit Crabs, a scrappy gang clad in mismatched rain gear, awaited them at the base, grinning with the smugness of those who think themselves victorious.\n\n\"Ye Hermit Crabs think ye can outwit us?\" Barnacle shouted, brandishing the Nokia as though it were a sword. \"We demand our ship returned!\"\n\nThe Hermit Crabs laughed, but before they could respond, Gamer Gary stepped forward. \"I challenge ye to a game!\" he declared, recalling a pivotal scene from his favorite video game. \"Winner takes the ship!\"\n\nThe Hermit Crabs, intrigued by this unexpected proposition, agreed, and thus began a game of wits and daring unlike any other. With a combination of pirate cunning, game strategy, and a bit of luck, the crew managed to outmaneuver the Hermit Crabs, reclaiming the Barnacle Beauty and sailing away into the stormy night, leaving behind the graffiti and the bus stop, and with them, one heck of a tale.",

        "story_b": "The sky was a bruised shade of purple, and the acid rain fell like a thousand tiny daggers, sizzling as they hit the pavement. Mother Nature seemed to be having a grand time drenching the ragtag pirate crew huddled under the decrepit, graffiti-covered bus stop. Captain Rumble, with his oversized hat and even larger ego, paced back and forth, narrowly avoiding the puddles of acidic doom. He clutched a Nokia phone like it was the Holy Grail, insisting it was their compass to salvation.\n\n\"Arr, this blasted rain's just a rival curse, mark me words!\" Captain Rumble declared, shaking his fist at the heavens. The crew, a motley group of dubious competence, nodded solemnly as if contemplating the wisdom of his words.\n\nFirst Mate Squawk, notorious for speaking exclusively in pirate-themed riddles, perched on a battered bench. \"When the sea's in the sky, and the ship's gone awry, what beast steals but has no claws?\" he mused cryptically, earning a chorus of groans from the crew.\n\nNavigator Nelly, whose sense of direction was as reliable as a broken compass\u2014her good luck charm\u2014grinned as she twirled it like a baton. \"Captain, the Nokia's got Snake on it. We could strategize like the days of old!\" she suggested with a mischievous glint.\n\n\"Snake, ye say?\" Captain Rumble's eyes lit up with the wild hope of a man who believed in the indestructibility of outdated technology. \"Aye, a game of strategy! Let\u2019s outwit them Hermit Crabs!\"\n\nThe crew, now marginally drier in their makeshift haven, began transforming the bus stop into a temporary pirate camp. The graffiti walls, a chaotic masterpiece of urban expression, became their map. One suspiciously detailed mural depicted a treasure map, which the crew enthusiastically adopted as their own.\n\n\"Look, Captain! X marks the spot right next to that...what is that, a sea monster or a cat?\" pondered Peg-Leg Pete, scratching his head.\n\n\"Aye, that be a cat, Pete. A fearsome feline, no doubt,\" Captain Rumble affirmed, squinting at the vibrant spray-painted creature. \"Navigator Nelly, plot us a course using yon map!\"\n\n\"Aye aye, Cap'n!\" Nelly saluted, her enthusiasm undampened by their dire circumstances. \"If the X be true, the Hermit Crabs' lair ain't too far.\"\n\nAs the crew debated tactics, Captain Rumble attempted to call the Hermit Crabs on the Nokia, convinced they could negotiate the return of their ship through sheer charm and outdated technology. \"Why is it always seagulls?\" he muttered, glaring at the persistent birds scavenging nearby.\n\n\"The birds know more than they let on, Captain,\" Squawk replied enigmatically, flapping an imaginary wing. \n\nWith the acid rain showing no signs of letting up, the crew decided it was time to reclaim their stolen vessel. Armed with umbrellas as makeshift cutlasses and a determination that bordered on absurd, they ventured out, leaving the safety of their bus stop sanctuary.\n\nTheir journey led them to a deserted beach, where they found the Hermit Crabs' hideout\u2014a rickety shack that looked like it had been assembled from shipwrecks and bad decisions. But as they prepared to storm the place, they were stopped in their tracks by a new challenge: a flock of aggressive seagulls, guarding the entrance like feathered sentinels.\n\n\"Blimey, them's the biggest seagulls I've ever seen,\" muttered Peg-Leg Pete, eyeing their beady eyes and sharp beaks with trepidation.\n\n\"Riddle me this, crew,\" Squawk began, \"when wings are your foe, what do you throw?\" His grin was as wide as the ocean as he revealed a stash of stale bread.\n\nWith a battle cry that echoed across the shore, the crew lobbed the bread, distracting the seagulls long enough to make their move. Yet, as they charged forward, Captain Rumble's voice rang out, \"Hold fast, mates! We've got a ship to reclaim, but first... who\u2019s got Snake on level ten?\"\n\nAnd with that, their adventure continued, uncertain and absurd, driven by questionable leadership and the indestructible spirit of a Nokia phone.",

        "prompt": "Stranded in a graffiti-covered bus stop during a rare acid rainstorm, your ragtag pirate crew faces a major setback: your ship has been stolen by a gang called the Hermit Crabs. Now, with nothing but a Nokia phone, questionable leadership, and a lot of bad luck, you must figure out how to reclaim your vessel and start your adventure.",
        "ground_truth": "# How (Not) to Start a Pirate Adventure [* Sunoco City, West Virginia, Wasteland. Sunset. You know...despite its hardships -deadly mutants trying to kill you, rival scavenger gangs trying to kill you, the Spice trying to kill you- it could be a *very* beautiful place during a sunset. The way the sun sinks beneath the horizon as you look out into the desert. The way the Spice in the air gives the orange and purple-tinted sky almost a....*magical* feeling! The mutant coyotes, somewhere in the distance, gently howling the song of their people. Sometimes, the sunset gets so peaceful and quiet that one would almost...forget...that they were in the Wasteland, where everything, even the sand itself, tries to kill you. Ah...the simple beauty in life... NOPE. **ACID RAIN.** Almost twice a year did it ever rain in West Virginia. And today was one of those days! And if you thought that rain in the Wasteland was anything like rain nearly 200 years ago, boy were you mistaken! The rain was...*acid rain*. Real...acid rain. Acid rain that if you dared to stick your naked, unprotected head under it, you were walking away without hair. And if you dared to look *up* or -Spice forbid- try to catch the *acid raindrops* onto your tongue, you're...basically walking away looking like the Joker. And where was our newly-formed, green in the gills, positively *itching* to start their pirate adventure, crew right now?? Bus stop. Thankfully the buildings, any coverings, and the bus stops, were made with lead (because *that* was safe!) to withstand the acid! So that's where the crew was. All stuffed into a smallish, lead-topped, glass-walled, graffiti'd, bus stop. Some sat on the grimy bench, others stood around or sat on the floor where the acid rain couldn't reach them. Their fearless captain, Petey Flynn, sat back, legs stretched out in front of him, on the far side of the bench. Next to his first mate, Voodood. Petey sighed and reached into his pocket, taking out a *centuries-old*, small, Nokia phone, in more or less pristine condition. He dialed a number and put it up to his ear. It picked up after a few rings. \"Heeeyyyy Genie-Bean!\", Petey crooned over the sounds of acid rain into the phone. \"Peter. Pinkie-Pie. Flynn.\", came, expectantly, from the other end of the line. And then Gina silently waited for the rest. It had only been a *week* since Petey set out on his 'Portal Gun pirate adventure', and has somehow, in one week, acquired a crew. They were set to depart *today morning*. So the fact that he was calling her could not *possibly* mean anything good. \"Soooo.....\", Petey continued after a glance over at Voodood, and then the rest of his crew,\"....we kiiiiinda....sorta.....*lost* the ship.\" \"YOU WHA--\" \"--It's okay! It's okay!\", Petey sat up, \"We *know* where it is! Or or...rather *who has it*! And it's....it's *Buster*. The Hermit Crabs took our ship. --Stole! *Stole* our ship.\" The *longest*, most drawn out sigh came from Gina's side of the line. \"Your....*pirate ship*...\", she clarified, \"....was....*pirated*...by the Hermit Crabs?\" \"Yeeahhhh. I mean if you really think about it, it was *such* a funny stor--\" **CLICK.** Petey blinked down at the phone. She hung up. He turned to rest of his crew, surprisingly *very* nonchalant about the whole thing. And gave them a shrug, sitting back once again. \"It's okay guys, she'll call back! I'm sure she's comin' up with a *plan* for us as we speak!\", he paused to look at each and every person at that bus stop, \"...Man, can you *believe* it's already been a week since we all met? Feels like *just yesterday* Dood saved me from that other time the Crabs jumped me....\" Seeming to quite literally be content with waiting for his sister to *maybe* call him back with a plan, Petey's eyes glazed over with recollection of that week during which they all met.",
        "story_a": "The sky wept with a venomous deluge, each raindrop hissing as it struck the cracked pavement. The acrid scent of burning chemicals permeated the air, mingling with the earthy odor of damp concrete. A cacophony of pattering rain and distant thunder reverberated through the graffiti-covered bus stop, where the remnants of the notorious pirate crew, the Storm Serpents, huddled together in a tenuous sanctuary.\n\nCaptain Sable, a woman whose commanding presence belied her petite stature, stood at the edge of the shelter, her dark eyes scanning the horizon with a mixture of fury and desperation. Her once pristine tricorn hat now drooped miserably, dripping with the noxious rain. She clenched a weathered Nokia phone in one hand, its ancient keypad slick with moisture. The screen glowed dimly, casting an eerie light on her determined face.\n\n\"We can\u2019t stay here forever,\" growled Flint, the burly first mate whose scarred visage looked even more menacing in the flickering light. He shifted restlessly, his broad shoulders barely fitting beneath the narrow awning. \"The Hermit Crabs have our ship. And if we don\u2019t act fast, they\u2019ll strip her down to the bones.\"\n\nAround them, the rest of the crew murmured in uneasy agreement. There was Marlowe, the lithe navigator with a penchant for getting lost in his own thoughts, and Lila, the sharp-tongued quartermaster whose quick wit was second only to her lethal aim. And then there was Jinx, the youngest and unluckiest of the lot, whose very presence seemed to attract misfortune like iron filings to a magnet.\n\nJinx shuffled his feet nervously, glancing up at the sky as if expecting it to rain fire next. \"But how do we even start looking for them?\" he asked, his voice trembling. \"We don\u2019t have any weapons, no transport, and that phone\u2019s older than dirt.\"\n\nCaptain Sable\u2019s grip tightened on the Nokia. \"This phone,\" she said, her voice steely, \"is our only lifeline. And we\u2019re going to use it to call in a favor.\"\n\nLila raised an eyebrow, her skepticism evident. \"A favor? From who? Most of our so-called friends would sooner slit our throats than help us.\"\n\nSable\u2019s lips curled into a tight smile. \"Not this one. There\u2019s a fence named Rook who owes me. Big time. If anyone knows the Hermit Crabs\u2019 movements, it\u2019s him.\"\n\nThe crew exchanged glances, a spark of hope igniting in their eyes. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was a start. Sable dialed the number with practiced fingers, the tone ringing out like a beacon in the storm. After an agonizing pause, the call connected.\n\n\"Sable,\" a gravelly voice answered, laced with suspicion. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Rook, I need information,\" Sable replied, her tone brooking no argument. \"The Hermit Crabs stole our ship. Where are they headed?\"\n\nThere was a rustle of papers, a muffled curse. \"You\u2019re in luck,\" Rook said grudgingly. \"They\u2019ve been laying low in the old shipyard by the docks. But you didn\u2019t hear it from me.\"\n\nSable ended the call, her eyes gleaming with renewed determination. \"To the docks, then,\" she declared. \"We\u2019ll take back what\u2019s ours.\"\n\nThe crew nodded, a newfound resolve settling over them. The acid rain continued to pour, but it couldn\u2019t extinguish the fire in their hearts. They moved as one, leaving the dilapidated bus stop behind, their silhouettes merging with the shadows of the storm.\n\nThe journey to the docks was fraught with peril. The city was a labyrinth of crumbling buildings and deserted streets, each step echoing with the threat of danger. But the Storm Serpents pressed on, driven by the promise of reclaiming their stolen ship.\n\nAs they neared the shipyard, Flint\u2019s keen eyes spotted movement. \"There,\" he whispered, pointing to a cluster of figures skulking around the rusted hulls. The Hermit Crabs, oblivious to their approach.\n\nSable signaled for silence, her mind racing with a plan. They had the element of surprise, and with it, a chance to turn the tide. \"On my mark,\" she breathed, her voice barely audible over the storm.\n\nThe crew tensed, every muscle coiled and ready. The moment stretched, the air thick with anticipation. And then, with a fierce cry, Sable led the charge, her crew following close behind.\n\nThe battle was swift and brutal, a clash of wills and desperation. The Hermit Crabs, caught off guard, fell back under the relentless assault. Sable\u2019s crew fought with the ferocity of those with nothing left to lose, reclaiming their ship inch by hard-fought inch.\n\nWhen the dust finally settled, the Storm Serpents stood victorious, their ship once more beneath their feet. The rain had begun to let up, the sky lightening with the promise of a new dawn. Sable looked around at her crew, battered but unbroken, and allowed herself a rare smile.\n\n\"Our adventure begins anew,\" she said, her voice ringing with triumph. \"Let\u2019s set sail.\"",
        "story_b": "Captain Redbeard squinted at the Nokia phone in his weathered hand, the acid rain pattering rhythmically on the bus stop's tin roof. The graffiti around them danced like a chaotic treasure map under the storm's relentless assault, and he could swear one of the scribbles looked suspiciously like a kraken. \"Blast it, this contraption's as useful as a compass in a whirlpool!\" he grumbled, shaking the phone as if it might suddenly reveal their ship's location.\n\nFirst Mate Sally, a paragon of pragmatism amidst the crew's motley chaos, peered over Redbeard's shoulder. \"Cap'n, maybe if we use it to call someone who knows about these Hermit Crabs, we might get a lead on the ship.\"\n\nRedbeard's eyes gleamed with a spark of hope. \"Aye, Sally, ye might be onto somethin'. But who in this blasted city would know about a bunch o' crusty thieves?\"\n\nMeanwhile, the crew huddled under the scant shelter, each member an embodiment of pirate lore clashing hilariously with urban life. Cannonball Carl, whose girth could rival a small cannon, was trying to decipher the graffiti, convinced it was an ancient pirate code. \"This here's gotta be a clue,\" he declared, tracing a finger over a particularly colorful mural. \"Or maybe directions to the nearest tavern.\"\n\n\"Or the loo,\" muttered Peggy Pegleg, who was tapping her wooden limb impatiently on the wet ground.\n\n\"Enough o' that!\" Redbeard commanded, the Nokia now aloft like a ceremonial sword. \"Let's figure out how this cursed thing works!\"\n\nDeckhand Jimmy, whose youthful exuberance often led to impulsive suggestions, piped up. \"Cap'n, what if we record a message and send it to the airwaves? Like a distress call!\"\n\nRedbeard nodded sagely, despite having no clue what airwaves were. \"Aye, Jimmy, get to it then! Make it known that we've been wronged by these Hermit Crabs!\"\n\nAs Jimmy fiddled with the phone, the crew fell into a heated debate about the best way to communicate with the Hermit Crabs. Suggestions ranged from sending a message in a bottle via the sewer drains to staging an elaborate puppet show.\n\nSally rolled her eyes and crossed her arms, leaning against a particularly vibrant depiction of a technicolor parrot. \"Or we could just try to call them directly,\" she interjected dryly. \"If only we had their number.\"\n\n\"Arr, but where's the adventure in that?\" Redbeard chuckled, patting her shoulder.\n\nMeanwhile, the rain continued its sizzling assault on the pavement, the acidic scent mingling with the aroma of city life\u2014a blend of exhaust and street food that seemed oddly fitting for a pirate crew marooned in modernity.\n\nFinally, Jimmy managed to dial a number, his voice crackling over the Nokia's tiny speaker. \"This is Captain Redbeard's crew, and we're demandin' the return of our ship! Ye Hermit Crabs best be hearin' this!\"\n\nThe voice on the other end was far from helpful. \"Welcome to Radio City, where your voice is our broadcast! You're live on air!\"\n\nSally slapped her forehead, while Carl let out a belly laugh that echoed across the bus stop.\n\n\"Well, now the whole city knows we're in a pickle,\" Peggy quipped, tapping her peg leg to a jaunty rhythm.\n\nBut then, a lightbulb moment struck Redbeard. \"On air, ye say? Then let's make this work for us!\"\n\nHe grabbed the phone and leaned in, his voice a commanding boom. \"To ye Hermit Crabs, we challenge ye to a duel of wits and strength! Meet us by the canal at dawn, and may the best crew reclaim the ship!\"\n\nThe crew cheered, their spirits buoyed by the captain's audacity. As the rain began to let up, they set off, the promise of adventure renewed in their hearts.\n\nIn the distance, the city canal awaited\u2014a maze of water and steel that would test their pirate mettle. And perhaps, just perhaps, it would lead them to their next grand escapade.",

Just tell me where he is!\u201d The strange man shouted, sending spit flying at my face as he did.\n\u201cFine. He\u2019s at work, the local Lidl,\u201d I answered, hoping he\u2019ll believe me.\n\u201cAre you stupid?! If I can track down his house I can track down his work. And he\u2019s not there!\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s where he said he\u2019d. If he\u2019s not there, then I don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\nThe man narrowed his eyes at me before lowering his gun. \u201cHe must\u2019ve known I was coming, made a break for it.\u201d As he left, he put his finger to his ear and spoke into what I assumed was a radio.

I\u2019d already found it while cleaning a couple months ago, but hadn\u2019t opened it, figuring it was a disaster survival pack or something, but with the new revelations, I had other ideas. I went to the floorboards and lifted them up to find a puzzle box that I already solved the first time I found it, so quickly solved again to pull out a bag.\n\nAnd viola, money, fake identities and, most importantly, a burner phone. I dialled my friend\u2019s number and waited. Once he answered I didn\u2019t give him time for his usual greetings.\n\n\u201cSome guy is looking for you.

What do you need?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat grab bag, take it to where I had my first birthday party.\u201d With that, he hung up. I furrowed my eyebrows. He\u2019d always told me he hadn\u2019t had a birthday party. So if it hadn\u2019t happened, it didn\u2019t happen anywhere, it happened nowhere. Ohhhh, I got it.\n\n30 minutes later, I found myself outside a pub a few miles outside of town. Normally you could get there in half the time, but I had to make sure I wasn\u2019t being followed. The pub was called Nowhere, people said it was because you could say to your spouse you were going \u2018nowhere\u2019 when they asked and not technically be lying.\n\nI handed my friend the bag, filled with some chocolate as an added treat before saying goodbye.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll miss you. Don\u2019t think the next roommate could replace you.\u201d But instead of agreeing, he shook his head.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be having another roommate. As long as they\u2019re coming after me, you\u2019re in danger. Go to this address,\u201d he handed me a small slip of paper, \u201cit\u2019s a safe house, you\u2019ll be safe there.\u201d\n\nNormally I\u2019d be disagreeing, I had a life and a job and family here, but being held at gunpoint still had me shaken, so I just nodded and we parted ways.\n\nI drove straight home, packing up quickly what I could and talking with the landlord. I told him I\u2019d recently inherited a house that came ready furnished, so I\u2019d be willing to sell him the furniture so he could rent the room as pre furnished. We came to a deal quickly and I walked away with some extra money in my account, that I immediately drained before driving.\n\nI didn\u2019t stop driving for almost 6 hours, not even for a toilet break, until I finally reached the address, somewhere in the middle of Scotland.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a modest house. 3 stories, as wide as my block of flats and a huge garden that I\u2019d have to measure in acres rather than metres.\n\nThe cupboards were wet stocked with non-perishables and a large amount of money, so I knew food wouldn\u2019t be an issue for a while. So I unpacked and settled into my new home, looking at the landline, wondering when the call would come in that I could go home.",
        "story_a": "\"Today\u2019s the day I tackle my taxes,\" I announced, plopping down at the kitchen table with a stack of forms and a mug of coffee. My roommate, Ethan, glanced up from his latest puzzle\u2014a 3D model of the Eiffel Tower made from matchsticks.\n\n\"Need any help?\" he asked, a glint of amusement in his eye.\n\nI waved him off. \"Nah, I got this. It's just numbers and boxes.\"\n\nEthan chuckled, returning to his intricate construction. He always had these weird hobbies. One week it was lock-picking, the next it was cryptography. I\u2019d always chalked it up to ADHD, figuring he was just a restless genius. But today, that perception was about to shatter.\n\nI was elbow-deep in deductions when the doorbell rang. Ethan\u2019s head snapped up, and for a moment, I saw something in his eyes\u2014something cold and calculating. He stood up, his movements fluid and silent, and walked to the door. I followed, curious.\n\nThe man on the other side was tall and imposing, with a hard face that screamed trouble. Ethan's demeanor shifted, becoming something entirely different\u2014controlled, intense. \n\n\"Long time, no see, Ethan,\" the man said, voice like gravel.\n\nEthan didn\u2019t respond. Instead, he stepped aside, letting the man in. My stomach churned with a mix of confusion and dread. \n\n\"Ethan, who is this?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.\n\nThe man ignored me, his eyes locked on Ethan. \"You\u2019ve been hard to find. The organization wants you back.\"\n\nEthan sighed, a sound filled with a weight I\u2019d never heard from him before. \"I told them, I'm out.\"\n\nThe man pulled a gun from his coat, pointing it directly at my face. \"And I told them, that's not an option.\"\n\nMy heart pounded, and a cold sweat broke out on my forehead. \"E-Ethan, what\u2019s going on?\"\n\nEthan\u2019s face was a mask of calm, but his eyes flickered with something fierce. \"I'm sorry, Jake. There's a lot I haven't told you.\"\n\n\"Yeah, like the fact you're an ex-assassin?\" The words tumbled out before I could stop them. It sounded absurd even as I said it.\n\nEthan's lips twitched into a small, humorless smile. \"Something like that.\"\n\nThe man with the gun cut in. \"Enough chit-chat. You\u2019re coming with me.\"\n\nEthan's eyes never left mine. \"Jake, trust me.\"\n\nI nodded, though every instinct screamed at me to run. Ethan moved faster than I thought possible. In a blur, he disarmed the man, twisting his wrist until the gun clattered to the floor. A swift kick to the chest sent the intruder sprawling.\n\nThe fight was over in seconds. Ethan stood over the man, breathing heavily, while I struggled to process what had just happened.\n\n\"Ethan, what the hell?\" I finally managed to say.\n\nHe ran a hand through his hair, looking suddenly weary. \"I was part of a... special operations group. We did things\u2014bad things. I got out, but they don't let people just leave.\"\n\nI glanced at the unconscious man on the floor. \"So, all those hobbies... they weren\u2019t just hobbies?\"\n\nEthan shook his head. \"No. They were skills I needed to survive.\"\n\nI sank into a chair, feeling the weight of it all settle on my shoulders. \"What happens now?\"\n\nEthan knelt beside the man, checking his pulse. \"We need to get out of here. They\u2019ll keep coming.\"\n\n\"Where will we go?\"\n\nHe stood up, determination hardening his features. \"Somewhere they can't find us. But first, we need to tie this guy up and figure out our next move.\"\n\nAs we worked together, a strange calm settled over me. This was Ethan\u2014my eccentric, puzzle-loving roommate. But he was also someone else, someone dangerous and skilled. And now, I was part of his world.\n\nBy the time we finished, the sun was setting, casting long shadows across the room. Ethan looked at me, his expression softened.\n\n\"Jake, I'm sorry you got dragged into this.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No turning back now, right?\"\n\nHe smiled, a real one this time. \"Right.\"\n\nIn that moment, I knew our lives had changed forever. The future was uncertain, filled with danger and questions. But as long as we faced it together, I felt a strange sense of hope.",
        "story_b": "I always thought Jake was just quirky. His strange hobbies seemed harmless, even if they were a bit unusual. Knowing how to pick locks, solve every puzzle and cipher by heart, or commit tax fraud\u2014these were just things that made him interesting. I never imagined they were skills from a darker past.\n\nToday, everything changed. I came home to find Jake standing in the middle of our living room, gun in hand, eyes wild with fear. \"Sit down, Alex,\" he ordered, voice trembling. \n\nI froze, my heart pounding. \"Jake, what the hell is going on?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady as I slowly lowered myself onto the couch.\n\nJake's hands were shaking, the gun wobbling as he tried to keep it pointed at me. \"I never wanted you to find out like this,\" he said, almost pleading. \"But I'm out of time.\"\n\nThe pieces started to fall into place. His late-night disappearances, the coded messages he received, the scars he tried to hide. Jake wasn't just quirky; he was an ex-assassin. \"This isn't what I wanted,\" I muttered, more to myself than to him. \"I didn't ask to be in this situation.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Jake replied, his voice breaking. \"But if word gets out that you know who I am, my life\u2014and yours\u2014will never be the same. My enemies will come for you, Alex. They don't leave loose ends.\"\n\nA cold shiver ran down my spine. Everything I had built\u2014my job, my friends, my life\u2014was at risk. \"What do you want from me?\" I asked, my voice barely a whisper.\n\n\"I need your help to disappear for good,\" Jake said, his eyes boring into mine. \"I never wanted to hurt you. I just need a way out.\"\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to steady my racing thoughts. \"And if I say no?\"\n\nJake's grip on the gun tightened. \"Then neither of us survives this.\"\n\nI might not survive this, but I'll make sure you don't get away with it either, I thought. But I couldn't just sit there and do nothing. \"Alright,\" I said finally. \"What do you need me to do?\"\n\nJake's relief was palpable. He lowered the gun slightly, his shoulders relaxing. \"I need you to help me gather some things. Documents, money, anything that can help me start a new life.\"\n\nAs we moved around the apartment, gathering the items Jake needed, I couldn't help but reflect on how much my past had shaped me. I had always thought I was just an ordinary person, trying to make a living. But now I realized how much my past\u2014my stubbornness, my resourcefulness\u2014had prepared me for this moment.\n\nWe worked in silence, the tension between us thick and heavy. My mind raced with questions. How could I reconcile the person I thought I knew with the reality of who Jake was? And more importantly, could I really trust him not to turn on me once he had what he needed?\n\nFinally, we had everything packed. Jake turned to me, his expression unreadable. \"Thank you, Alex,\" he said quietly. \"I know this isn't easy for you.\"\n\n\"Just promise me one thing,\" I replied, my voice hard. \"Promise me you'll never come back.\"\n\nJake nodded. \"I promise. This is the last you'll ever see of me.\"\n\nWith that, he slipped out the door and into the night, leaving me alone in the apartment that now felt so empty and unfamiliar. I sank onto the couch, my mind racing. Was it possible to truly escape one's past? Or are we all just running from our own shadows?\n\nAs the reality of what had just happened sank in, I felt a strange mix of emotions\u2014relief, fear, and a deep, gnawing uncertainty about the future. But one thing was clear: my life would never be the same. And maybe, just maybe, that wasn't such a bad thing after all.",

The pub was called Nowhere, people said it was because you could say to your spouse you were going \u2018nowhere\u2019 when they asked and not technically be lying.\n\nI handed my friend the bag, filled with some chocolate as an added treat before saying goodbye.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll miss you. Don\u2019t think the next roommate could replace you.\u201d But instead of agreeing, he shook his head.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be having another roommate. As long as they\u2019re coming after me, you\u2019re in danger. Go to this address,\u201d he handed me a small slip of paper, \u201cit\u2019s a safe house, you\u2019ll be safe there.\u201d\n\nNormally I\u2019d be disagreeing, I had a life and a job and family here, but being held at gunpoint still had me shaken, so I just nodded and we parted ways.\n\nI drove straight home, packing up quickly what I could and talking with the landlord. I told him I\u2019d recently inherited a house that came ready furnished, so I\u2019d be willing to sell him the furniture so he could rent the room as pre furnished. We came to a deal quickly and I walked away with some extra money in my account, that I immediately drained before driving.\n\nI didn\u2019t stop driving for almost 6 hours, not even for a toilet break, until I finally reached the address, somewhere in the middle of Scotland.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a modest house. 3 stories, as wide as my block of flats and a huge garden that I\u2019d have to measure in acres rather than metres.\n\nThe cupboards were wet stocked with non-perishables and a large amount of money, so I knew food wouldn\u2019t be an issue for a while. So I unpacked and settled into my new home, looking at the landline, wondering when the call would come in that I could go home.",
        "story_a": "\"Today\u2019s the day I tackle my taxes,\" I announced, plopping down at the kitchen table with a stack of forms and a mug of coffee. My roommate, Ethan, glanced up from his latest puzzle\u2014a 3D model of the Eiffel Tower made from matchsticks.\n\n\"Need any help?\" he asked, a glint of amusement in his eye.\n\nI waved him off. \"Nah, I got this. It's just numbers and boxes.\"\n\nEthan chuckled, returning to his intricate construction. He always had these weird hobbies. One week it was lock-picking, the next it was cryptography. I\u2019d always chalked it up to ADHD, figuring he was just a restless genius. But today, that perception was about to shatter.\n\nI was elbow-deep in deductions when the doorbell rang. Ethan\u2019s head snapped up, and for a moment, I saw something in his eyes\u2014something cold and calculating. He stood up, his movements fluid and silent, and walked to the door. I followed, curious.\n\nThe man on the other side was tall and imposing, with a hard face that screamed trouble. Ethan's demeanor shifted, becoming something entirely different\u2014controlled, intense. \n\n\"Long time, no see, Ethan,\" the man said, voice like gravel.\n\nEthan didn\u2019t respond. Instead, he stepped aside, letting the man in. My stomach churned with a mix of confusion and dread. \n\n\"Ethan, who is this?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.\n\nThe man ignored me, his eyes locked on Ethan. \"You\u2019ve been hard to find. The organization wants you back.\"\n\nEthan sighed, a sound filled with a weight I\u2019d never heard from him before. \"I told them, I'm out.\"\n\nThe man pulled a gun from his coat, pointing it directly at my face. \"And I told them, that's not an option.\"\n\nMy heart pounded, and a cold sweat broke out on my forehead. \"E-Ethan, what\u2019s going on?\"\n\nEthan\u2019s face was a mask of calm, but his eyes flickered with something fierce. \"I'm sorry, Jake. There's a lot I haven't told you.\"\n\n\"Yeah, like the fact you're an ex-assassin?\" The words tumbled out before I could stop them. It sounded absurd even as I said it.\n\nEthan's lips twitched into a small, humorless smile. \"Something like that.\"\n\nThe man with the gun cut in. \"Enough chit-chat. You\u2019re coming with me.\"\n\nEthan's eyes never left mine. \"Jake, trust me.\"\n\nI nodded, though every instinct screamed at me to run. Ethan moved faster than I thought possible. In a blur, he disarmed the man, twisting his wrist until the gun clattered to the floor. A swift kick to the chest sent the intruder sprawling.\n\nThe fight was over in seconds. Ethan stood over the man, breathing heavily, while I struggled to process what had just happened.\n\n\"Ethan, what the hell?\" I finally managed to say.\n\nHe ran a hand through his hair, looking suddenly weary. \"I was part of a... special operations group. We did things\u2014bad things. I got out, but they don't let people just leave.\"\n\nI glanced at the unconscious man on the floor. \"So, all those hobbies... they weren\u2019t just hobbies?\"\n\nEthan shook his head. \"No. They were skills I needed to survive.\"\n\nI sank into a chair, feeling the weight of it all settle on my shoulders. \"What happens now?\"\n\nEthan knelt beside the man, checking his pulse. \"We need to get out of here. They\u2019ll keep coming.\"\n\n\"Where will we go?\"\n\nHe stood up, determination hardening his features. \"Somewhere they can't find us. But first, we need to tie this guy up and figure out our next move.\"\n\nAs we worked together, a strange calm settled over me. This was Ethan\u2014my eccentric, puzzle-loving roommate. But he was also someone else, someone dangerous and skilled. And now, I was part of his world.\n\nBy the time we finished, the sun was setting, casting long shadows across the room. Ethan looked at me, his expression softened.\n\n\"Jake, I'm sorry you got dragged into this.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No turning back now, right?\"\n\nHe smiled, a real one this time. \"Right.\"\n\nIn that moment, I knew our lives had changed forever. The future was uncertain, filled with danger and questions. But as long as we faced it together, I felt a strange sense of hope.",
        "story_b": "I never thought I'd be staring down the barrel of a gun in my own living room, but here I was, my roommate's eyes cold and unrecognizable. The cozy apartment we shared, with its mismatched furniture and cluttered bookshelves, seemed like a surreal backdrop to this deadly standoff. The air was thick with tension, my heart pounding so loudly I was sure he could hear it.\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me?\" I demanded, my voice shaking with a mix of fear and betrayal. \"Would you have believed me?\" he shot back, his voice cold and steady. I always thought his quirks were just part of his charm. Turns out, they were skills honed for survival and death.\n\nHow had I missed the signs? The late-night disappearances, the scars he never explained. It all made sense now, but it was too late. My mind raced, trying to find a way out of this alive. Of all the ways I thought I'd die, being shot by my roommate wasn't even in the top ten. Shows what I know.\n\n\"Look,\" I said, trying to keep my voice calm, \"we don't have to do this. You don\u2019t have to do this.\" \n\nHe sighed, lowering the gun slightly but keeping his grip firm. \"You weren't supposed to find out. It was safer that way.\" He looked almost regretful. Almost.\n\n\"Safer for who?\" I asked, anger bubbling up inside me. \"For me or for you?\" \n\n\"Both of us,\" he replied, his eyes flickering with something I couldn't quite read. \"But now that you know, things have to change.\"\n\nAs he tightened his grip on the gun, I remembered the emergency button hidden under the coffee table. One press, and the room would be flooded with blinding light. It was a relic from my past, a past I had tried so hard to leave behind. I knew I had to act fast, even if it meant revealing my own secrets. I couldn't let him pull the trigger.\n\n\"I know what you did,\" I said, my voice low and steady. \"But you don't know everything about me either.\"\n\nHis eyes narrowed, the gun wavering slightly. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Do you remember that code you taught me?\" I asked, inching my hand closer to the button. \"The one you said was just for fun?\" \n\nHe nodded, suspicion growing in his eyes.\n\n\"It wasn't just for fun,\" I continued. \"It was a test. And I passed.\" \n\nJust as he was about to pull the trigger, I whispered the code word that only someone from my old life would know. His eyes widened in recognition, the gun lowering as the realization hit him.\n\n\"You... you're one of them,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\"Not anymore,\" I replied, pressing the button. The room was instantly flooded with blinding light, and I took my chance. Lunging forward, I knocked the gun from his hand and sent it skittering across the floor.\n\nWe stood there, panting and staring at each other, the weight of our shared past hanging heavy in the air. How had we both ended up here, trying to escape the same shadows?\n\n\"I never wanted this,\" he said, his voice breaking. \"I just wanted to be normal.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" I replied, my own voice trembling. \"But here we are.\"\n\nAs the light began to fade, I knew we had to make a choice. We could either continue living in fear, or we could find a way to trust each other. It was a risk, but one I was willing to take.\n\n\"Let's make a deal,\" I said, extending my hand. \"No more secrets. We help each other stay hidden, stay safe.\"\n\nHe looked at my hand, then back at me, the conflict clear in his eyes. Finally, he nodded, taking my hand in his.\n\n\"Deal,\" he said, a hint of a smile playing at the corners of his mouth.\n\nIn that moment, we both knew that survival would come at a cost. But for the first time, it felt like a cost we could bear together. The room, once filled with tension and fear, now held a fragile sense of hope. And as we stood there, two ex-assassins trying to find a new path, I realized that maybe, just maybe, we could find a way to live in the light, instead of hiding in the shadows.",

I\u2019d already found it while cleaning a couple months ago, but hadn\u2019t opened it, figuring it was a disaster survival pack or something, but with the new revelations, I had other ideas. I went to the floorboards and lifted them up to find a puzzle box that I already solved the first time I found it, so quickly solved again to pull out a bag.\n\nAnd viola, money, fake identities and, most importantly, a burner phone.

        "story_b": "I always thought his lock-picking skills were just a quirky hobby. Turns out, they were part of his \"previous employment.\" My heart pounded in my chest as I stared at the gun, its barrel staring back at me like a cold, unblinking eye. It was one of those moments when the universe decided to smack you in the face with a reality check, and I was the unlucky recipient.\n\n\"Really, Jason?\" I stammered, trying to mask my terror with sarcasm. \"All those times you 'joked' about disappearing people\u2014I thought you were just being dramatic!\"\n\nHis smirk was as sharp as ever, a deadly charm that had probably saved him countless times. \"You always were too curious for your own good,\" he replied, his voice as calm as if we were discussing the weather.\n\nI glanced around our cozy apartment, now a prison with its locked windows and heavy drapes. The eclectic mix of furniture and decor\u2014once a testament to our shared eccentric tastes\u2014felt like a collection of sinister props. His collection of exotic teas suddenly seemed less about taste and more about poisons.\n\n\"But a gun, Jason? Really? I thought we were past all this,\" I said, trying to buy time as my mind raced for a solution. \"You know, I'm not great at getting blood out of the carpet.\"\n\nHe chuckled, a sound that used to be comforting but now felt like the eerie soundtrack to my imminent demise. \"Don't worry, I have a guy for that.\"\n\nI always figured Jason's bizarre knowledge of ciphers and tax fraud was just his ADHD manifesting in weird ways. I had even joked about how he could crack the Da Vinci Code in his sleep. Now, those skills seemed less endearing and more menacing.\n\nThe tension in the air was as thick as a fog, and I knew I had to act fast. I might not be an assassin, but years of escape room challenges had to count for something, right? I remembered a trick from one of those games\u2014a distraction that could buy me some time.\n\n\"Wait, Jason!\" I blurted out, \"I have a riddle for you!\"\n\nHe raised an eyebrow, clearly intrigued despite himself. \"You know I can't resist a good puzzle.\"\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to steady my trembling hands. \"What has keys but can't open locks?\"\n\nHis gaze softened for a moment, and I saw a flicker of the friend I thought I knew. \"A piano,\" he answered, lowering the gun slightly.\n\n\"Right!\" I said, seizing the moment. \"And speaking of music, I think there's something you should hear.\" I reached for my phone, praying he wouldn't shoot first and ask questions later.\n\nTo my surprise, Jason's curiosity got the better of him. I quickly pulled up a song\u2014a shared favorite from our college days. The familiar notes filled the room, a melody that held memories of late-night study sessions and endless debates over the best movie villains.\n\nHis grip on the gun slackened, and I saw the tension in his shoulders ease. The music was our unspoken truce, a reminder of the bond we once shared. As the song played, I inched towards the window, my heart pounding with each step.\n\n\"Jason,\" I said softly, \"we've been through a lot together. This doesn\u2019t have to end badly.\"\n\nHe hesitated, the gun wavering in his hand. I could see the internal conflict etched on his face, the struggle between the killer he once was and the friend he had become.\n\nIn that moment, I made a decision. I might not have his skills, but I had my own. Years of mediating roommate disputes and navigating office politics had taught me how to find common ground.\n\n\"Let's talk this out,\" I suggested, trying to sound braver than I felt. \"Over some of that weird tea you love so much.\"\n\nHe laughed, a genuine, if reluctant, sound. \"You always knew how to get me to listen.\"\n\nAs he lowered the gun, I released a breath I hadn't realized I was holding. The immediate threat was gone, but I knew our conversation was far from over. Still, it was a start\u2014a chance to untangle the mess we found ourselves in.\n\nFor now, I was just grateful to still be standing, armed with nothing but my wits and a shared history that might just save us both.",

Amidst subtle glances, unspoken tensions, and a buttery apple turnover, their fates begin to intertwine\u2014will duty or desire prevail?",
        "ground_truth": "On the terraces of the Citadel, a gentle breeze wafted through the air. Low tables, large cushions, and thick carpets were arranged with care, the linen cloths embroidered with the symbols of Rohan, and the white muslin of Gondor reflected the sunlight. Upon them lay silver platters filled with simple yet delightful fare: savory pies, salads of fresh fruit, slices of seed bread dipped in Dol Amroth's oil, portions of roast with a crisp crust, and morsels of spiced meat. Carafes of refreshing juices, white and red wine, sweet ratafia, and sparkling mead glimmered in the sun. Some elvish silk drapes had been stretched between decorated poles adorned with ribbons and red vine tendrils to provide shade for the guests.\nNot long before, the Citadel had been animated by a grand parade of Gondorian warriors, their silver armor shining beneath the warm autumn sun, and their long pikes reflecting rays of light. The Rohirrim knights had demonstrated their valor in a jousting exhibition: their powerful and agile steeds moved with perfect precision and grace, while the riders showcased their legendary equestrian mastery. Following this, the elegant knights of Dol Amroth glided onto the scene, their capes billowing like sails, as some sailors from the maritime realm displayed their skill in knot and rigging games, throwing ceremonial ropes and nets into the air, amidst the admiring applause of the spectators.\nThroughout the ceremony, \u00c9omer had maintained a composed expression, befitting a King of the Mark. Yet, every so often, his gaze inevitably slipped towards the beautiful daughter of Imrahil. Her attire, rich as befitted a princess, was of refined simplicity. The silver and blue cloak fluttered lightly in the breeze, occasionally revealing the amber skin of her shoulders, and, Bema help him, a generous portion of her collarbones. But it was Loth\u00edriel's face that truly captured \u00c9omer's attention: her bright eyes and full lips seemed to hide a secret smile.\nLoth\u00edriel, for her part, did not fail to notice the fleeting yet fervent glances the King of Rohan cast her way. She felt flattered, intrigued by the contrast between his imposing presence and the apparent shyness that shone through his gestures. Gracefully, she offered him a few subtle smiles, hoping that \u00c9omer would grasp the message hidden behind her composure. He was no Boromir, of course, and she would never forget him. However, there was something about this warrior king that reminded her of him, and she was ready to give him a chance. Her father had hinted at a promise, and Loth\u00edriel, fully aware of the role she was meant to play from birth, intended to honor it to the best of her ability. If the sovereign she was destined for was to be that proud barbarian king, well, she would not be intimidated.\nLater, after the horses and their riders had been refreshed, the foot soldiers and sailors found respite, and every noble of the court had settled at the long, informal low tables prepared for the feast, \u00c9omer was called loudly by the Dol Amrothian brothers with whom he had forged a sincere friendship as well as a steadfast military alliance. With a nod of his head, King Elassar gave his consent, and so \u00c9omer found himself seated right next to Loth\u00edriel. Perhaps it was mere coincidence, or perhaps not: Imrahil's knowing smile did not entirely escape him, making him suspect that the princess's family had orchestrated the meeting. In any case, he preferred it this way: he felt more at ease among the jovial and witty knights of Dol Amroth than among the pompous and haughty nobles of Gondor. Not to mention, it had the undeniable advantage of sitting next to the princess. It mattered little if the prince\u2014her father\u2014had had a hand in it. He continued to watch her as she laughed and conversed animatedly with her brothers, revealing more of her sharp wit and undeniable beauty. Though distracted by the charms of his neighbor, \u00c9omer still managed, albeit with some difficulty, to respond to the jests of his newfound friends. At one point, one of the guests offered Loth\u00edriel another glass of ratafia, and before she could accept, \u00c9omer interjected in a measured tone:\n\u201cSurely the princess would prefer a glass of fresh spring water.\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel was taken aback and, without allowing the others to hear, whispered with a tone betraying her displeasure:\n\u201cI thank my lord for his concern, but you are not a relative to whom I must account for my libations.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, I am not your kin.\"\nA \u201c\nnot yet\n\u201d lingered between them for a moment, an unspoken tension that vibrated the air with unexpressed possibilities.

        "story_a": "The Great Hall of Meduseld was alive with laughter, the clinking of goblets, and the rich scent of roasted meats and freshly baked bread. The alliance between Rohan and Gondor had brought about a celebration the likes of which had not been seen in many years. Golden banners of the Rohirrim draped alongside the silver and white standards of Gondor, symbolizing the unity of the two great kingdoms.\n\n\u00c9omer, King of the Mark, sat at the head of the grand table, his eyes scanning the room with a mixture of pride and wariness. His gaze settled on the empty seat beside him, reserved for Loth\u00edriel, daughter of Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth. He had heard much about her\u2014her sharp mind, her beauty, and her tendency to speak her mind in ways that both intrigued and unsettled the courtiers of Gondor.\n\nAs if on cue, Loth\u00edriel entered the hall, her presence commanding immediate attention. Draped in a dress of deep blue, her dark hair fell in waves down her back, and her eyes sparkled with a mix of curiosity and mischief. She approached the table with a grace that spoke of her noble lineage, and \u00c9omer stood to greet her, his heart unexpectedly quickening.\n\n\"My lady,\" he said, offering her a polite bow.\n\n\"King \u00c9omer,\" she replied with a nod, her eyes meeting his with a boldness that caught him off guard. \"It is an honor to be seated beside you.\"\n\n\"The honor is mine,\" he said, motioning for her to sit. As they took their seats, the feast continued around them, the noise and merriment providing a backdrop to their burgeoning connection.\n\nFor a while, they exchanged pleasantries, discussing the success of the alliance and the future of their kingdoms. But there was an undercurrent to their conversation, a tension that neither could ignore. \u00c9omer found himself stealing glances at Loth\u00edriel, noting the way her eyes crinkled when she laughed and the way her fingers drummed lightly against the table when she was lost in thought.\n\nAt one point, a servant placed a platter of buttery apple turnovers before them, and Loth\u00edriel's eyes lit up with delight. \"These are my favorite,\" she confessed, reaching for one. \"My father always has the kitchens prepare them for special occasions.\"\n\n\u00c9omer smiled, taking one for himself. \"Then let us consider this a special occasion indeed,\" he said, his tone light but his gaze serious.\n\nAs they bit into the turnovers, the conversation turned more personal. Loth\u00edriel spoke of her childhood in Dol Amroth, of the sea and the freedom she felt when riding along the shores. \u00c9omer listened intently, captivated by her stories and the passion with which she told them. He shared tales of his own, of the rolling plains of Rohan and the bond between the Rohirrim and their horses.\n\n\"There is something about the open sky,\" Loth\u00edriel mused, \"that makes one feel truly alive.\"\n\n\u00c9omer nodded in agreement. \"It is the same for me. The wind in my hair, the land stretching out before me\u2014it is where I feel most at home.\"\n\nTheir eyes met, and for a moment, the rest of the hall seemed to fade away. \u00c9omer felt a pull, a connection that was more than just the alliance between their kingdoms. It was something deeper, something that neither duty nor distance could easily sever.\n\nBut as quickly as the moment came, it was interrupted by a call for a toast. \u00c9omer raised his goblet, his voice strong and clear as he spoke of the bond between Rohan and Gondor, and the hope for a future of peace and prosperity. The hall erupted in cheers, and the spell between him and Loth\u00edriel was momentarily broken.\n\nAs the night wore on, \u00c9omer and Loth\u00edriel found themselves drawn back to each other, their conversation flowing easily despite the interruptions. They spoke of dreams and fears, of the weight of their responsibilities and the desire for something more.\n\n\"Do you ever wish,\" Loth\u00edriel asked softly, \"that you could set aside the crown, even for a day, and just be yourself?\"\n\n\u00c9omer considered her question, his expression contemplative. \"There are times,\" he admitted, \"when the burden of kingship feels heavy. But it is a weight I bear willingly, for the sake of my people.\"\n\nLoth\u00edriel nodded, understanding in her eyes. \"It is the same for me. I love my family, my home, but there are moments when I long for freedom.\"\n\n\"In that, we are kindred spirits,\" \u00c9omer said, a smile tugging at his lips.\n\nAs the feast drew to a close, \u00c9omer escorted Loth\u00edriel to the doors of Meduseld. The night air was cool, and the stars shone brightly above them. They stood in silence for a moment, the weight of their unspoken feelings hanging between them.\n\n\"Thank you for a memorable evening, King \u00c9omer,\" Loth\u00edriel said, her voice soft.\n\n\"The pleasure was mine, Lady Loth\u00edriel,\" he replied, his hand lingering on hers for just a moment longer than necessary. \"Until we meet again.\"\n\n\"Until then,\" she said, her eyes holding a promise that made \u00c9omer's heart ache with a longing he could not deny.\n\nAs she walked away, \u00c9omer watched her go, knowing that their fates were now intertwined. Whether duty or desire would prevail, only time would tell. But for tonight, he allowed himself to hope.",
        "story_b": "The grand hall of Minas Tirith was ablaze with light, banners of Rohan and Gondor proudly displayed side by side, their colors vibrant under the flickering candles. The air was thick with the scents of roasted meats, spiced wine, and the gentle hum of laughter and conversation. It was a night of celebration, marking the enduring alliance between the two great realms, yet for \u00c9omer, King of the Mark, the feast was more a battlefield than a banquet.\n\nSeated beside him was Loth\u00edriel, daughter of Prince Imrahil. Her gown of deep blue silk shimmered under the candlelight, and her eyes, a striking shade of grey, sparkled with mischief. \u00c9omer found himself caught between his kingly duties and the unexpected pull of her presence. His heart was a battlefield of duty and desire, each glance at Loth\u00edriel a skirmish he struggled to win.\n\n\"Is the King of Rohan always so serious, or is it just the company?\" Loth\u00edriel teased, her voice a playful melody that cut through the din of the feast. She turned to him, a subtle smile playing on her lips, and \u00c9omer felt a warmth spread across his cheeks.\n\n\"I assure you, my lady, it is not the company,\" \u00c9omer replied, attempting to match her levity. \"But it is rare for me to sit idle while others hold swords.\"\n\nLoth\u00edriel laughed, a sound that seemed to dance across the room. \u00c9omer watched her, captivated, as she reached for a buttery apple turnover from the platter before them. She held it delicately, the flaky pastry glistening in the light.\n\n\"They say,\" she began, her tone conspiratorial, \"that sharing food at a feast brings good fortune and binds destinies.\" She broke the turnover in half and offered him a piece. \"Do you believe in such superstitions, my lord?\"\n\n\u00c9omer hesitated, recalling the old tales his people whispered by the firelight. He had always been one for practicality over omens, yet there was something in Loth\u00edriel's gaze that made him reconsider.\n\n\"I have heard such tales,\" he admitted, accepting the offering. \"But I find that fate often has a mind of its own, regardless of what we share.\"\n\nLoth\u00edriel tilted her head, considering his words. \"Perhaps,\" she replied, \"but sometimes it is the smallest gestures that set the course of our lives.\"\n\n\u00c9omer took a bite of the turnover, its sweetness a surprising delight, and allowed himself a moment of vulnerability. \"And what course do you wish to set, my lady?\"\n\nShe met his gaze, her expression softening. \"One where duty does not overshadow desire, where alliances are not just of lands but of hearts.\"\n\nHer words lingered in the air, weaving a spell that \u00c9omer found difficult to break. His thoughts were a storm of conflicting loyalties, the weight of his crown heavy upon his brow. Yet, as he watched Loth\u00edriel's laughter and felt the warmth of her presence, a new resolve began to form.\n\n\"Then let us carve such a path, together,\" he said, surprising even himself with the boldness of his declaration.\n\nLoth\u00edriel's eyes widened slightly, her surprise quickly replaced by a radiant smile. \"A daring proposal, King \u00c9omer. I should warn you, I am not easily swayed.\"\n\n\"Nor am I, Princess Loth\u00edriel,\" \u00c9omer replied, his voice steady. \"Yet here we are, contemplating more than just alliances.\"\n\nThe feast continued around them, the music and merriment a backdrop to the quiet exchange that had begun to change the course of their lives. \u00c9omer found himself drawn to Loth\u00edriel's wit, her spirit, and the promise of something beyond duty\u2014a shared destiny that might intertwine their fates in ways neither had foreseen.\n\nAs the night wore on, \u00c9omer could not shake the feeling that perhaps, amidst the laughter and the buttery apple turnover, he had found not just an ally, but a partner. The stars outside shone brightly over Minas Tirith, witnessing the beginning of a new bond forged not by obligation, but by choice\u2014a choice that would echo through the halls of both kingdoms for years to come.",

Low tables, large cushions, and thick carpets were arranged with care, the linen cloths embroidered with the symbols of Rohan, and the white muslin of Gondor reflected the sunlight. Upon them lay silver platters filled with simple yet delightful fare: savory pies, salads of fresh fruit, slices of seed bread dipped in Dol Amroth's oil, portions of roast with a crisp crust, and morsels of spiced meat. Carafes of refreshing juices, white and red wine, sweet ratafia, and sparkling mead glimmered in the sun. Some elvish silk drapes had been stretched between decorated poles adorned with ribbons and red vine tendrils to provide shade for the guests.\nNot long before, the Citadel had been animated by a grand parade of Gondorian warriors, their silver armor shining beneath the warm autumn sun, and their long pikes reflecting rays of light. The Rohirrim knights had demonstrated their valor in a jousting exhibition: their powerful and agile steeds moved with perfect precision and grace, while the riders showcased their legendary equestrian mastery. Following this, the elegant knights of Dol Amroth glided onto the scene, their capes billowing like sails, as some sailors from the maritime realm displayed their skill in knot and rigging games, throwing ceremonial ropes and nets into the air, amidst the admiring applause of the spectators.\nThroughout the ceremony, \u00c9omer had maintained a composed expression, befitting a King of the Mark. Yet, every so often, his gaze inevitably slipped towards the beautiful daughter of Imrahil. Her attire, rich as befitted a princess, was of refined simplicity. The silver and blue cloak fluttered lightly in the breeze, occasionally revealing the amber skin of her shoulders, and, Bema help him, a generous portion of her collarbones. But it was Loth\u00edriel's face that truly captured \u00c9omer's attention: her bright eyes and full lips seemed to hide a secret smile.\nLoth\u00edriel, for her part, did not fail to notice the fleeting yet fervent glances the King of Rohan cast her way. She felt flattered, intrigued by the contrast between his imposing presence and the apparent shyness that shone through his gestures. Gracefully, she offered him a few subtle smiles, hoping that \u00c9omer would grasp the message hidden behind her composure. He was no Boromir, of course, and she would never forget him. However, there was something about this warrior king that reminded her of him, and she was ready to give him a chance. Her father had hinted at a promise, and Loth\u00edriel, fully aware of the role she was meant to play from birth, intended to honor it to the best of her ability. If the sovereign she was destined for was to be that proud barbarian king, well, she would not be intimidated.\nLater, after the horses and their riders had been refreshed, the foot soldiers and sailors found respite, and every noble of the court had settled at the long, informal low tables prepared for the feast, \u00c9omer was called loudly by the Dol Amrothian brothers with whom he had forged a sincere friendship as well as a steadfast military alliance. With a nod of his head, King Elassar gave his consent, and so \u00c9omer found himself seated right next to Loth\u00edriel. Perhaps it was mere coincidence, or perhaps not: Imrahil's knowing smile did not entirely escape him, making him suspect that the princess's family had orchestrated the meeting. In any case, he preferred it this way: he felt more at ease among the jovial and witty knights of Dol Amroth than among the pompous and haughty nobles of Gondor.

        "story_b": "The Great Hall of Merethrond was alive with the glow of candlelight, casting a warm shimmer over polished silverware, while the rich aroma of roasted meats mingled with the sweet scent of apple turnovers. Banners of Rohan and Gondor hung side by side, their colors bright against the stone walls, symbolizing unity and shared purpose. Laughter and music wove through the air like a tapestry of celebration, binding the two realms in joyous harmony.\n\n\u00c9omer, King of Rohan, sat at the head table, his gaze occasionally drifting across the hall to where the laughter was loudest. Yet, his attention was repeatedly drawn back to the woman seated beside him\u2014Loth\u00edriel, daughter of Imrahil. Her presence was as captivating as the night sky, her wit as sharp as the stars that adorned it. As they shared the evening meal, subtle glances and unspoken tensions danced between them, weaving a tale of possibility beneath the surface of formality.\n\n\u00c9omer found himself both comforted and unnerved by Loth\u00edriel's presence. Her eyes, a stormy grey, met his with an intensity that was both challenging and inviting. He admired her poise, the way she engaged in conversation with those around her, her laughter like a melody that lingered in his thoughts. Yet, beneath his admiration lay a growing conflict, a tug-of-war between the duties of a king and the desires of a man.\n\nAs the meal progressed, \u00c9omer, with a gesture both hesitant and hopeful, offered Loth\u00edriel a buttery apple turnover. Her fingers brushed his as she accepted it, the touch sending a ripple through the air around them. \"A taste of Gondor's finest,\" he said, a slight smile tugging at the corners of his lips.\n\nLoth\u00edriel returned his smile, her eyes twinkling with a blend of mischief and understanding. \"I have always been fond of apple turnovers,\" she replied, her voice a soft melody amidst the clamor of the feast. \"They remind me of home, yet here they carry a hint of something new.\"\n\n\u00c9omer nodded, his thoughts drifting. \"The sweetness of apples, the complexity of spices\u2014a fitting symbol for our alliance, do you not think?\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Loth\u00edriel agreed, her gaze lingering on the turnover before her. \"A blend of flavors, much like the melding of our cultures. Yet one must wonder,\" she added, her eyes meeting his with a playful challenge, \"if the sweetness will endure.\"\n\nA silence fell between them, charged with the weight of unspoken words. \u00c9omer felt the pull of her question, the underlying inquiry of whether their personal fates, like the fates of their realms, could intertwine without conflict. He marveled at her ability to speak so much with so little, to challenge him with a mere glance or a simple phrase.\n\nThe hall around them seemed to fade, the laughter and music becoming a distant echo as \u00c9omer's thoughts turned inward. He was a king, bound by duty to his people, yet here beside him was a woman who stirred something deep within him. A desire for more than duty, a yearning for a connection that transcended politics and alliances.\n\nLoth\u00edriel watched him, her gaze softening as she sensed the turmoil within him. Her own heart was not immune to the conflict of duty and desire, the path laid before her by her father's ambitions, and the path she wished to carve for herself. Yet, in \u00c9omer's presence, she found a kindred spirit, a man who understood the weight of responsibility and the longing for something beyond it.\n\nAs the feast continued, their conversation flowed like a river, sometimes swift and playful, other times deep and contemplative. They spoke of their homes, their families, their hopes for the future. And all the while, the buttery apple turnover remained a symbol between them\u2014a reminder of what could be, if only they dared to reach for it.\n\nThe night wore on, and as the feast began to wane, \u00c9omer and Loth\u00edriel found themselves lingering in their shared moment, reluctant to let it end. The tension between duty and desire hung in the air, an unresolved chord that played softly in the background of their thoughts.\n\nAs the last notes of music faded and the hall began to empty, \u00c9omer rose, offering Loth\u00edriel his arm. \"Shall I escort you to your quarters, my lady?\"\n\nShe accepted with a graceful nod, her fingers light on his arm. \"I would be honored, my lord.\"\n\nTogether they walked through the echoing corridors of Minas Tirith, the world around them both vast and intimate. And in the quiet of the night, they pondered what the future might hold, each step a silent promise of what could be, if only they dared to follow the path of their hearts.",

Realizing he had overstepped, \u00c9omer made an embarrassed grimace and replied:\n\"Please forgive my intrusion.\u201d\nIt was for this reason that \u00c9omer, to ease the atmosphere, offered her a delicacy typical of Rohan: a buttery apple turnover.\n\u201cI recall you particularly enjoyed it when you had the chance to taste it.\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel immediately understood that it was a gesture of peace, a way to apologize and to convey that his attentions were sincere. She took a bite, and when \u00c9omer saw her tongue licking the filling from her lips, he felt a shiver run down his spine. He struggled to maintain his composure, but within him, he was nearly going mad: may Bema help him, that girl would be his undoing!",
        "story_a": "The Great Hall of Meduseld was alive with laughter, the clinking of goblets, and the rich scent of roasted meats and freshly baked bread. The alliance between Rohan and Gondor had brought about a celebration the likes of which had not been seen in many years. Golden banners of the Rohirrim draped alongside the silver and white standards of Gondor, symbolizing the unity of the two great kingdoms.\n\n\u00c9omer, King of the Mark, sat at the head of the grand table, his eyes scanning the room with a mixture of pride and wariness. His gaze settled on the empty seat beside him, reserved for Loth\u00edriel, daughter of Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth. He had heard much about her\u2014her sharp mind, her beauty, and her tendency to speak her mind in ways that both intrigued and unsettled the courtiers of Gondor.\n\nAs if on cue, Loth\u00edriel entered the hall, her presence commanding immediate attention. Draped in a dress of deep blue, her dark hair fell in waves down her back, and her eyes sparkled with a mix of curiosity and mischief. She approached the table with a grace that spoke of her noble lineage, and \u00c9omer stood to greet her, his heart unexpectedly quickening.\n\n\"My lady,\" he said, offering her a polite bow.\n\n\"King \u00c9omer,\" she replied with a nod, her eyes meeting his with a boldness that caught him off guard. \"It is an honor to be seated beside you.\"\n\n\"The honor is mine,\" he said, motioning for her to sit. As they took their seats, the feast continued around them, the noise and merriment providing a backdrop to their burgeoning connection.\n\nFor a while, they exchanged pleasantries, discussing the success of the alliance and the future of their kingdoms. But there was an undercurrent to their conversation, a tension that neither could ignore. \u00c9omer found himself stealing glances at Loth\u00edriel, noting the way her eyes crinkled when she laughed and the way her fingers drummed lightly against the table when she was lost in thought.\n\nAt one point, a servant placed a platter of buttery apple turnovers before them, and Loth\u00edriel's eyes lit up with delight. \"These are my favorite,\" she confessed, reaching for one. \"My father always has the kitchens prepare them for special occasions.\"\n\n\u00c9omer smiled, taking one for himself. \"Then let us consider this a special occasion indeed,\" he said, his tone light but his gaze serious.\n\nAs they bit into the turnovers, the conversation turned more personal. Loth\u00edriel spoke of her childhood in Dol Amroth, of the sea and the freedom she felt when riding along the shores. \u00c9omer listened intently, captivated by her stories and the passion with which she told them. He shared tales of his own, of the rolling plains of Rohan and the bond between the Rohirrim and their horses.\n\n\"There is something about the open sky,\" Loth\u00edriel mused, \"that makes one feel truly alive.\"\n\n\u00c9omer nodded in agreement. \"It is the same for me. The wind in my hair, the land stretching out before me\u2014it is where I feel most at home.\"\n\nTheir eyes met, and for a moment, the rest of the hall seemed to fade away. \u00c9omer felt a pull, a connection that was more than just the alliance between their kingdoms. It was something deeper, something that neither duty nor distance could easily sever.\n\nBut as quickly as the moment came, it was interrupted by a call for a toast. \u00c9omer raised his goblet, his voice strong and clear as he spoke of the bond between Rohan and Gondor, and the hope for a future of peace and prosperity. The hall erupted in cheers, and the spell between him and Loth\u00edriel was momentarily broken.\n\nAs the night wore on, \u00c9omer and Loth\u00edriel found themselves drawn back to each other, their conversation flowing easily despite the interruptions. They spoke of dreams and fears, of the weight of their responsibilities and the desire for something more.\n\n\"Do you ever wish,\" Loth\u00edriel asked softly, \"that you could set aside the crown, even for a day, and just be yourself?\"\n\n\u00c9omer considered her question, his expression contemplative. \"There are times,\" he admitted, \"when the burden of kingship feels heavy. But it is a weight I bear willingly, for the sake of my people.\"\n\nLoth\u00edriel nodded, understanding in her eyes. \"It is the same for me. I love my family, my home, but there are moments when I long for freedom.\"\n\n\"In that, we are kindred spirits,\" \u00c9omer said, a smile tugging at his lips.\n\nAs the feast drew to a close, \u00c9omer escorted Loth\u00edriel to the doors of Meduseld. The night air was cool, and the stars shone brightly above them. They stood in silence for a moment, the weight of their unspoken feelings hanging between them.\n\n\"Thank you for a memorable evening, King \u00c9omer,\" Loth\u00edriel said, her voice soft.\n\n\"The pleasure was mine, Lady Loth\u00edriel,\" he replied, his hand lingering on hers for just a moment longer than necessary. \"Until we meet again.\"\n\n\"Until then,\" she said, her eyes holding a promise that made \u00c9omer's heart ache with a longing he could not deny.\n\nAs she walked away, \u00c9omer watched her go, knowing that their fates were now intertwined. Whether duty or desire would prevail, only time would tell. But for tonight, he allowed himself to hope.",
        "story_b": "Golden goblets gleamed under the soft candlelight, casting a warm glow over the grand hall of Merethrond in Minas Tirith. The air was filled with the scent of roasted meats and the laughter of guests, a testament to the joyous occasion celebrating the alliance between Rohan and Gondor. Yet, amidst the revelry, \u00c9omer, King of the Mark, sat in reflective silence, his gaze occasionally drifting to the enchanting woman seated beside him\u2014Loth\u00edriel, the daughter of Prince Imrahil.\n\n\u00c9omer's mind wandered as he surveyed the opulent hall. The weight of kingship rested heavily on his shoulders, his duties to Rohan ever-present in his thoughts. Yet, here, in this moment of celebration, he found himself torn between the obligations of his title and a growing desire for something more personal, something he had not expected\u2014a connection with the sharp-witted maiden by his side.\n\nLoth\u00edriel, for her part, was not content to play the role of a mere spectator. Her eyes sparkled with intelligence and mischief as she engaged in the political discussions swirling around the feast. She challenged expectations with her insightful remarks, her voice a melody that cut through the more mundane conversations. Her presence was a breath of fresh air, and \u00c9omer couldn't help but be drawn to her.\n\nTheir eyes met briefly, a silent acknowledgment passing between them. \u00c9omer felt a tug at his heart, a nostalgic yearning for connection amidst the formalities and the pomp of the feast. He cleared his throat, attempting to break the ice with a comment about the sumptuous spread before them.\n\n\"It seems the cooks outdid themselves with this feast,\" he said, gesturing toward the array of dishes. \"Though I must admit, the buttery apple turnover is a personal favorite.\"\n\nLoth\u00edriel chuckled softly, a sound that seemed to lighten the very air around them. \"Ah, the famed apple turnover of Minas Tirith. I hear it has won many a heart, yet I suspect it is the company that makes it truly delightful.\"\n\n\u00c9omer's lips curled into a smile, appreciating her playful banter. \"Then I am fortunate indeed to have such company.\"\n\nTheir exchange, though lighthearted, carried a depth that neither could ignore. They continued to speak, their conversation weaving between topics of politics and personal aspirations. Loth\u00edriel shared her hopes for a future where Gondor and Rohan stood united, not just through alliances but through understanding and friendship.\n\n\u00c9omer listened intently, captivated by her eloquence and vision. He found himself sharing his own dreams for Rohan\u2014a land of rolling hills and fierce warriors, yet also a place of peace and prosperity. As they spoke, the flickering candlelight seemed to mirror \u00c9omer's flickering resolve, caught between duty and the desire to explore this newfound connection.\n\nThe feast continued around them, a tapestry of cultural vibrancy. The guests were adorned in traditional attire, the men in richly embroidered tunics and the women in gowns that shimmered like the stars above. Music filled the air, a harmonious blend of Rohan's robust melodies and Gondor's elegant symphonies.\n\nIn a moment of quiet, \u00c9omer turned to Loth\u00edriel, his voice softened by sincerity. \"I find myself at a crossroads, torn between what is expected of me as King and what my heart desires. Yet in your company, I see a path that could lead to both.\"\n\nLoth\u00edriel met his gaze, her eyes reflecting a similar longing. \"And I, too, find myself intrigued by a future where duty and desire need not be at odds.\"\n\nTheir conversation had evolved from playful exchanges to a deeper understanding, a shared acknowledgment of the potential that lay before them. In that moment, \u00c9omer and Loth\u00edriel found a sense of reconciliation, a mutual recognition of their burgeoning interest.\n\nAs the feast drew to a close, \u00c9omer knew that the path ahead was not without its challenges. Yet, with Loth\u00edriel by his side, he felt a renewed sense of hope. Together, they could forge a bond that transcended mere political alliances\u2014a bond built on friendship, respect, and perhaps something even greater.\n\nWith a final glance at the buttery apple turnover, \u00c9omer rose from his seat, offering Loth\u00edriel his hand. She accepted with grace, her touch a promise of things to come. And as they left the grand hall, the future stretched out before them, a dance of shadows and light, filled with the promise of a shared destiny.",

        "ground_truth": "Some days or weeks or months or years before Mom died, I got her laughing about the Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that bad,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat one guy had a bag of meth,\u201d I told her.\n\n\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t smoke it,\u201d she responded. \u201cHe kept it in his pocket.\u201d\n\nTrue. He didn\u2019t. But even if he did, I don\u2019t think the night could have been any worse.\n\nMom was living in a house with several apartments in Bangor, Maine, at the time. Before living there, she lived in the town next over for seven years, but due to her drinking and her temper, got evicted, which is how she ended up in Bangor\u2014in a housing complex for Native tenants only. Mom tried so hard\u2014so, so hard\u2014to stay sober. And she did, occasionally. Weeks and months would go by when I don\u2019t think she was drinking. Or if she was, she had learned to control her temper. And it was around the time of that Thanksgiving\u2014the Thanksgiving\u2014when she had been sober. Clearheaded. When she called me, she no longer asked for money, asked for rides, asked for a pack of cigarettes. I want to say she was loving and caring and motherly, but even when she drank, she was those things too. I suppose she was just better. And that\u2019s why, when she said she wanted to host Thanksgiving, I was excited. Jess, my sister, was getting out of prison\u2014she served a one-year sentence for theft, on top of priors. According to an article in the local paper, which Mom had cut out and taped on the fridge next to an article about an award I won, Jess had been one of \u201cthree arrested after chicken, potatoes, vodka stolen from grocer,\u201d and she would be there. I was busy with something the day before Thanksgiving when my sister was released, and I told Mom I couldn\u2019t go with her to get Jess at the bus stop, so I didn\u2019t get to see her take her first step off the bus into the free world. My sister and I had written once a month for the year she was in prison. The only thing I remembered from the letters was that my sister\u2019s walking partner was Roxanne Jeskey, a woman convicted of torturing and murdering her husband with a wooden towel rack with nails protruding, needle-nose pliers, and a metal broom handle. Jess said that Roxanne was a good lady. In a text I sent Jess\u2014to make sure I was right that this was true\u2014she wrote back: \u201cShe was a very sweet little old lady who encouraged me to walk with her outside every day to feel better! There I am only doing a year and super depressed and that poor lady had life!\u201d\n\nA very sweet little old lady!\n\nWhile I couldn\u2019t pick my sister up at the bus stop with my mom, I reassured her I\u2019d be at Thanksgiving. Mom was so excited to have her son and daughter together, and part of that excitement, I think, came from the fact that she was sober and so was my sister. Hell, that got me excited too\u2014the first Thanksgiving, far as I can remember, with a sober mother and a sober sister. I imagined it would be a quiet gathering. We\u2019d be in Mom\u2019s cluttered bedroom in her tiny apartment filled with stale cigarette smoke while we sat on the bed and ate turkey, scalloped potatoes, green beans, bread, and cranberry sauce, and along the way Mom would turn down her TV\u2014she\u2019d be watching The Real Housewives of some fucking county\u2014so we could hear each other chew and talk. And in between bites of food we\u2019d ask Jess about prison, and she\u2019d crack jokes, and eventually we would ask her what Roxanne was really like, and Jess would say, Yeah, she told me after she cut off her husband\u2019s penis that she held it over her head and spun it around, pretending to escape the police in a penis-propelled helicopter, and then we\u2019d all laugh and Jess would say, No, no, she was a very nice lady, always asked me how I was doing, and then Jess would get up and ask us if we wanted more cranberry sauce and while she was in the kitchen she\u2019d wonder why Mom never wrote to her.\n\nBut that\u2019s too perfect, right? At least for our family it is.\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day, I got to Mom\u2019s around four in the afternoon. The driveway, which dipped down into a hill, was slick and icy, and so when I parked, I pulled up my emergency brake. I got out and looked up at the second floor, where Mom\u2019s apartment was. A light was on, the window open, and I heard their voices.\n\nThe stairs to Mom\u2019s apartment were narrow and twisty\u2014it\u2019s hyperbole to compare them to the Stairs of Cirith Ungol, but I bet Mom would find that true since she had terrible arthritis and a rod in her leg and that climb was tough\u2014and I climbed them to the top. The door was locked, so I knocked. No answer, but I heard them talking and then laughing. I knocked again, louder, and when the door swung open there was Jess\u2019s ex-boyfriend, Dan. Dan was really good at dumpster diving. He lived in a tent behind Hobby Lobby, even in the winter. Jess lived there too sometimes.\n\nDan was nice. Or so he seemed. I suppose I can say he was one of the nicer men my sister dated, one of the nicer men my sister loved.\n\nHe smiled at me\u2014all but one tooth straight\u2014and he ushered me into the living room, where Mom stood with an apron on and an unlit cigarette between her fingers. Jess was on the floor, cans of Natty Daddies surrounding her like a wall, a fortress, and she got up and from the floor and gave me a beery hug.\n\n\u201cHi, honey,\u201d Mom said, and she told me to follow her into the small kitchen.\n\nMom stirred gravy on the stove. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019s drinking,\u201d she said. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Next to the stove was a cup with tinfoil folded over the top like a lid, a pink bendy straw pierced through it. Did Mom really not know we all knew that\u2019s how she drank? How she tried to hide it?\n\n\u201cRight when she got off the bus,\u201d Mom said, stirring, \u201cshe said she was going to get drunk. Whatever. She\u2019s a grown woman.\u201d\n\nShe drank from the cup with the straw.\n\nThe excitement I felt didn\u2019t immediately turn to disappointment. It was gradual. Sure, it started with seeing my sister\u2019s year of sobriety disappear, started by seeing Dan\u2014yeah, he was nice, but my sister could do better than a guy who lived in a tent behind Hobby Lobby\u2014started by seeing Mom pick up a drink. But the real disappointment came when more guests showed up.\n\nThree, to be exact.\n\nFirst there was Jeremy, a man in his thirties who my mom met at the methadone clinic (she always said she went for pain management, and in a way that\u2019s the truth).\n\n\u201cGod bless you,\u201d she said to him when he showed up with a can of cranberry sauce.\n\n\u201cThis your son?\u201d he asked.\n\nSecond, there was a tall older man, standing behind Jeremy. I can\u2019t remember who the hell he was. He was either a former priest or a pastor, but what I do know is that at that time, he was looking after Jeremy and his sobriety.\n\nThird and finally was the last person I expected: the schizophrenic woman who lived three houses down and who always\u2014and I mean always\u2014stood outside in the middle of the yard smoking.\n\n\u201cLiza, dear,\u201d Mom said. \u201cYou came.\u201d\n\nLiza\u2019s voice was raspy. \u201cYou got a cigarette?\u201d\n\nMom\u2019s apartment was already small to begin with, but just then it felt even smaller. In the living room, I stood while Jess and Dan drank and laughed on the floor, while Liza stood looking out the window, smoking, while Jeremy kept asking my mother if she needed help with anything in the kitchen, and while the priest smiled at us, all of us, a tribe of misfits and nutjobs and criminals and addicts and weirdos, myself included.\n\n\u201cBaby brother,\u201d my sister said, and I sat with her on the floor, even though she had that nasty booze breath, even though I was unhappy with her choices right then, because that\u2019s what you do when you love someone.\n\n\u201cDid you know,\u201d my sister said, not to me but to the room, \u201cdid you know that my baby brother wrote me all the time while I was in prison. And he sent me books and put money in my commissary.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust wonderful!\u201d the priest exclaimed. \u201cJust absolutely wonderful!\u201d\n\nMom cooked. Jess kept me on the floor with her and Dan. Liza continued to stand by the window. Jeremy moved between room and room, unable to commit to one place. And the priest kept on smiling.\n\nIt\u2019s moments like these, I realize now, with people like us, when the world and the lives within it are at their truest.\n\nEventually the food was ready, which Mom announced, that cigarette in her hand still unlit. But nobody moved. Jess and Dan stayed on the floor, drinking. Jeremy\u2014who had asked me more than once if I\u2019d seen a plastic bag filled with white glass beads\u2014couldn\u2019t stand still. Liza was no longer near the window but was in the middle of the living room, staring at Mom, who was in the hallway, waiting for people to come get food. The priest seemed the readiest to eat\u2014he was moving toward the kitchen with such conviction.\n\nThere was no line or anything\u2014we all just crammed ourselves into the kitchen, the very one Mom died hating because there was no sideboard space. It smelled like cooked meat and potatoes and the sweetness of warmed-up cranberry sauce and booze. Mom picked up a dull serrated blade.\n\n\u201cHappy Turkey Day,\u201d she said, and with the dull knife she tried to cut the turkey\u2019s tied feet. She drew the blade back and forth, back and forth, like the string was a giant log, the knife a bow saw, trying to get through it. My sister laughed. \u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Mom said, and then with such force she got the string cut and you\u2019d think tension would dissolve right then but it didn\u2019t and cooked bird juice and grease and fat flew and splattered all over the wall.\n\nMom licked turkey juice off her fingers and carved the turkey. \u201cHelp yourselves,\u201d she said. We all had plates except Liza. \u201cLiza, honey, do you want me to make you a plate?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got a cigarette?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Mom mumbled.\n\nAfter we all ate\u2014except for my mom, who always ate later, and for Liza, who just smoked her cigarette\u2014I told Mom I had to get going. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you down,\u201d she said, taking her apron off. My sister and I didn\u2019t say goodbye, because it wasn\u2019t goodbye for us\u2014we\u2019d see each other in a day or two or three.\n\nI helped Mom down the narrow and steep stairs, made sure she didn\u2019t fall, and outside she zipped up her jacket and lit a smoke. The sky was clear\u2014I remember that\u2014the night made brighter by the winter moon and stars burning so far away, a distance I sometimes felt with my mom but not right then.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe she drank,\u201d Mom was saying, and judging by the face I made she must have known I knew that she too drank. \u201cI had one drink,\u201d she confessed. \u201cBut I can have a drink, can\u2019t I?\u2019\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, lying, because one wouldn\u2019t be enough. But sometimes you know you just can\u2019t fight the person you love. Love. That\u2019s what that Thanksgiving was full of. Mom made sure I knew that years later, when one time we were again laughing about that night, she said to me, \u201cHoney, to those people, it was a good Thanksgiving, because they were invited. Because they had a place to be and they felt welcomed.\u201d\n\nThat night, in the driveway with her, getting ready to leave, that was what I felt, even though I couldn\u2019t name the feeling.\n\nWe stood there, Mom and I, and after I hugged her goodbye and thanked her for dinner\u2014to which she said, \u201cOf course, my honey\u201d\u2014she scraped her half-smoked cigarette across the icy snow, and I didn\u2019t leave the driveway until I saw she\u2019d made it safely back inside.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The scent of rosemary and thyme wafted through the air, mingling with the sharp tang of cranberry sauce and the buttery richness of mashed potatoes. The kitchen was a cacophony of clattering dishes, beeping timers, and the low hum of the oven. Amelia stood at the stove, stirring a pot of gravy with one hand while balancing a phone against her ear with the other.\n\n\"Yes, Mom, I know. I remember the recipe,\" she said, her voice strained but affectionate. \"I've made it a hundred times.\"\n\nHer mother\u2019s voice crackled through the line, insistent and slightly panicked. \"But don\u2019t forget the secret ingredient. Your father always loved it that way.\"\n\nAmelia sighed, glancing at the recipe card propped up against the backsplash. The familiar scrawl of her father's handwriting was both comforting and heart-wrenching. \"I won't forget, promise.\"\n\nShe hung up, setting the phone down on the counter, and took a deep breath. The house was filled with the noise of family, each room echoing with laughter, arguments, and the occasional burst of music from the living room where her younger cousins were attempting a dance-off. It was Thanksgiving, and the Daniels family was in full swing.\n\nAmelia\u2019s brother, Jake, appeared in the doorway, his hands laden with a tray of deviled eggs. \"Need any help in here?\" he asked, though his tone suggested he hoped the answer was no.\n\nShe gave him a wry smile. \"Always. Can you check on the turkey?\"\n\nJake set the tray down and moved to the oven, peering through the glass. \"Looks good. Smells even better.\"\n\nAs he straightened, their eyes met, and for a moment, the chaos around them faded. They had grown up in this house, the walls steeped in memories of holidays past. Their father\u2019s absence was a palpable void, but they had learned to fill it with new traditions, new laughter.\n\n\"How\u2019s Mom holding up?\" Jake asked, his voice softer now.\n\n\"She\u2019s... managing,\" Amelia replied. \"Called me three times already to remind me about the gravy.\"\n\nJake chuckled, but it was tinged with sadness. \"Some things never change.\"\n\nThey worked in tandem, the rhythm of their movements a testament to years of shared experience. Amelia finished the gravy, and Jake basted the turkey, their unspoken coordination a comfort amidst the noise.\n\nIn the living room, their cousin Lizzie was arguing with her husband, Mark, over the volume of the TV. \"I told you, it\u2019s too loud! Grandma can\u2019t hear herself think,\" Lizzie snapped, grabbing the remote from his hand.\n\nMark threw up his hands in exasperation. \"Fine! Turn it off, then. See if I care.\"\n\nTheir grandmother, seated in her favorite armchair, watched the exchange with mild amusement. \"Oh, let them be, Lizzie. It\u2019s a holiday. We\u2019re supposed to be having fun.\"\n\nLizzie huffed but relented, muting the TV and turning her attention back to her children, who were now engaged in a heated debate over the last piece of pumpkin pie.\n\nAmelia stepped into the room, wiping her hands on a dishtowel. \"Alright, everyone, dinner\u2019s almost ready. Can we try to get along for five minutes?\"\n\nHer plea was met with a chorus of good-natured grumbles and a few teasing remarks. She couldn\u2019t help but smile. This was her family, chaotic and dysfunctional, but undeniably bound by love.\n\nAs they gathered around the table, Amelia felt a pang of nostalgia. The seats were filled, but there was an emptiness that no amount of food or laughter could dispel. Her father\u2019s chair, now occupied by her mother, seemed to hold a silent vigil for the man who had once been the heart of these gatherings.\n\nHer mother raised her glass, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. \"To family,\" she said, her voice wavering but strong. \"And to those who are no longer with us, but whose love still fills this room.\"\n\nGlasses clinked, and for a moment, there was a hush, a collective breath held in remembrance. Then the spell was broken, and the room erupted into conversation and laughter once more.\n\nAmelia watched her family, her heart swelling with a mixture of pride and sorrow. They were messy, imperfect, but they were hers. In the midst of the noise and the arguments, the love that tied them together was unbreakable.\n\nAs the night wore on, the stories flowed as freely as the wine. Tales of childhood mischief, of triumphs and failures, of moments that had shaped them into who they were. Amelia listened, laughed, and shared, feeling the weight of the past and the promise of the future in every word.\n\nIt was late when the doorbell rang, a sharp, unexpected sound that cut through the merriment. Amelia frowned, exchanging a puzzled glance with Jake. \"Who could that be?\"\n\nShe rose from her seat, weaving through the crowded room to the front door. When she opened it, she found herself face to face with a young woman, her hair damp from the rain, a hesitant smile on her lips.\n\n\"Hi,\" the woman said, her voice soft but steady. \"I\u2019m sorry to intrude. My name is Emily. I think... I think I might be your sister.\"\n\nThe room behind Amelia fell silent, all eyes turning toward the door. She felt the world tilt beneath her feet, the ground shifting in ways she could not yet comprehend.\n\n\"Sister?\" she echoed, her mind racing. \"How...?\"\n\nEmily took a deep breath, her eyes searching Amelia\u2019s face. \"I was adopted. I\u2019ve been looking for my birth family for a while now. I didn\u2019t mean to just show up like this, but... it\u2019s Thanksgiving. And I didn\u2019t want to be alone.\"\n\nAmelia\u2019s heart ached at the vulnerability in Emily\u2019s voice, the quiet plea for connection. She glanced back at her family, seeing the shock and curiosity mirrored in their expressions. Her mother\u2019s hand covered her mouth, her eyes wide and brimming with tears.\n\n\"Come in,\" Amelia said, stepping aside to let Emily enter. \"You\u2019re not alone anymore.\"\n\nThe room seemed to hold its breath as Emily stepped inside, her eyes darting around, taking in the faces that were both familiar and strange. Jake was the first to move, crossing the room to offer a tentative smile.\n\n\"Hi, Emily,\" he said, his voice warm. \"I\u2019m Jake. Welcome to the family.\"\n\nOne by one, they introduced themselves, the initial shock giving way to a cautious curiosity. Emily\u2019s presence was a ripple in the fabric of their lives, a new thread woven into the tapestry of their story.\n\nAmelia watched as her mother approached Emily, her hands trembling. \"I... I never knew,\" she whispered, her voice breaking. \"I\u2019m so sorry.\"\n\nEmily shook her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. \"It\u2019s okay. I just... I wanted to know where I came from. To find my roots.\"\n\nHer mother pulled her into a tight embrace, the years of separation and silence dissolving in the warmth of that hug. Amelia felt her own tears spill over, the weight of the moment pressing down on her.\n\nThey gathered around the table once more, making room for Emily, who sat between Jake and their grandmother. The conversation resumed, tentative at first, but soon the laughter and the stories flowed again, now with a new participant.\n\nEmily shared her own story, of her search for her birth family, of the life she had built for herself. Her words were met with encouragement, with acceptance, with love. The Daniels family had always been a patchwork quilt of personalities and histories, and Emily was now a part of that intricate design.\n\nAs the night drew to a close, Amelia found herself standing on the porch, the cool night air a welcome respite from the warmth of the house. Emily joined her, her eyes reflecting the glow of the porch light.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Emily said quietly. \"For welcoming me.\"\n\nAmelia smiled, reaching out to squeeze her hand. \"You\u2019re family. That\u2019s what we do.\"\n\nThey stood in silence for a moment, the weight of the day settling around them. Amelia felt a sense of peace, a quiet certainty that, despite the chaos and the dysfunction, they had found something beautiful. Connection, belonging, love\u2014these were the threads that held them together, even in the most unexpected moments.\n\nAs they turned to go back inside, Amelia knew that this Thanksgiving would be one they would all remember. It was a reminder that family was not just about blood, but about the bonds they chose to forge, the love they chose to give.\n\nAnd in that chaotic, imperfect, wonderful gathering, they had found a deeper truth about what it meant to belong.",
        "story_b": "I realized I had forgotten my mother's birthday as I stepped into the kitchen, the scent of burnt toast and the shrill beep of a smoke detector greeting me like an unwelcome alarm clock. Panic set in as I scrambled to organize a last-minute family dinner, a frantic whirlwind of phone calls and hasty promises. My mother, bless her heart, pretended not to care, but I knew better. Birthdays were a big deal in our family, a tradition that, despite its imperfections, held us together like the glue on a hastily mended teacup.\n\nBy midday, the chaos had begun to unfold, each family member arriving with their own brand of eccentricity. The living room was a chaotic symphony of mismatched furniture and family photos, a nostalgia-tinged backdrop for what promised to be an evening of love and dysfunction.\n\nMy brother, Jake, was the first to arrive, his arms laden with grocery bags filled with everything but what we'd actually need. He grinned sheepishly, his eyes twinkling with mischief. \"I brought chips, dip, and...a pineapple?\" he said, holding up the spiky fruit like a trophy.\n\n\"Great, Jake. Exactly what we need for dinner,\" I replied, rolling my eyes but smiling despite myself. Jake had always been the joker, the one who could lighten any mood with his antics.\n\nNext came Aunt Linda, her perfume wafting in before she did, an overpowering floral scent that clung to everything it touched. She swept into the room like a force of nature, her voice a booming reminder of her presence. \"Happy birthday, dear sister!\" she exclaimed, enveloping my mother in a hug that looked more like a wrestling hold.\n\n\"Linda, you're crushing me,\" my mother gasped, patting her sister's back awkwardly.\n\n\"Oh, nonsense! You love my hugs,\" Linda declared, releasing her grip to inspect the room with a critical eye. \"I see you still haven't redecorated, dear. This couch is practically an antique!\"\n\n\"It's a family heirloom,\" my mother retorted, a hint of pride in her voice. The couch, with its faded floral print and sagging cushions, was indeed a relic of our family's past, a symbol of our imperfect but enduring bond.\n\nAs the afternoon wore on, more relatives trickled in, each one adding to the cacophony of voices and clinking dishes that filled the house. My cousin Sarah arrived with her newborn, a squalling bundle of joy who seemed determined to out-sing the smoke detector. My father shuffled in behind her, carrying a cake that looked suspiciously lopsided.\n\n\"Happy birthday, honey,\" he said, placing the cake on the kitchen counter. \"I might have hit a pothole on the way over.\"\n\n\"You think?\" I said, eyeing the cake, which now resembled the Leaning Tower of Pisa.\n\nDespite the mishaps, the gathering was starting to resemble a celebration, the living room buzzing with conversation and laughter. Jake had set up a makeshift bar in the corner, mixing drinks with the enthusiasm of a mad scientist. Aunt Linda was regaling anyone who'd listen with tales of her latest cruise, while my father attempted to salvage the cake with a liberal application of whipped cream.\n\nIt was during one of these moments, just as I was starting to feel the warmth of family envelop me like a cozy blanket, that the first real mishap occurred. Jake, in an attempt to showcase his bartending prowess, accidentally knocked over a bottle of red wine, the contents cascading over the tablecloth like a crimson waterfall.\n\n\"Oops,\" he said, looking genuinely apologetic for once.\n\n\"Jake!\" my mother exclaimed, rushing to blot the stain with napkins. \"This is your grandmother's tablecloth!\"\n\n\"Sorry, Mom. I'll fix it, I promise,\" Jake said, dabbing at the spill with little success.\n\nIn the midst of the chaos, I noticed my grandmother quietly observing from her usual spot by the window. Her eyes, sharp and discerning, missed nothing. She'd been a silent witness to our family's trials and triumphs, her presence a constant reminder of the generations that had come before us.\n\n\"Grandma,\" I said, sidling up to her. \"Are you okay?\"\n\nShe nodded, a soft smile playing on her lips. \"I'm fine, dear. Just watching you all. It's quite a show.\"\n\nI chuckled, taking her hand in mine. \"It always is, isn't it?\"\n\nThe evening progressed with its usual blend of humor and tension, each incident bringing out different family dynamics. At one point, Sarah attempted to pass her baby to Jake, who recoiled as if she'd handed him a ticking time bomb.\n\n\"Uh, no thanks, Sarah. I'm better with bottles,\" he quipped, gesturing to his makeshift bar.\n\n\"Typical,\" Sarah retorted, rolling her eyes but laughing nonetheless.\n\nAs the dinner hour approached, the kitchen became a hive of activity, each family member contributing to the meal in their own way. My mother fretted over the turkey, which seemed determined to remain stubbornly undercooked, while Aunt Linda hovered, offering unsolicited advice.\n\n\"You know, if you basted it with a bit of sherry, it would cook faster,\" she suggested, peering over my mother's shoulder.\n\n\"Linda, if you want sherry in your turkey, you're welcome to make your own,\" my mother replied, her patience wearing thin.\n\n\"Fine, fine. Just trying to help,\" Linda said, raising her hands in mock surrender.\n\nThe turkey eventually emerged from the oven, golden and steaming, a testament to my mother's culinary perseverance. We gathered around the table, a hodgepodge of chairs pulled from every corner of the house, the room filled with the scent of roasted meat and familial anticipation.\n\nAs the meal began, the conversations flowed freely, a tapestry of stories and laughter woven together over plates of food. Jake, emboldened by a few too many cocktails, stood to make a toast, his glass wobbling precariously in his hand.\n\n\"To Mom,\" he said, his voice slurring slightly. \"The best mom anyone could ask for, even if she does hold a grudge like nobody's business.\"\n\n\"Jake!\" my mother exclaimed, half-laughing, half-scolding.\n\n\"What? It's true!\" Jake protested, grinning unabashedly.\n\nThe toast, intended as a joke, revealed an underlying truth about our family. We loved fiercely, but our grudges were just as tenacious, a tangled web of love and resentment that both pulled us closer and pushed us apart.\n\nAs the meal wound down, my father disappeared into the kitchen, returning with the lopsided cake, now adorned with a haphazard array of candles. We sang \"Happy Birthday\" with gusto, our voices a joyful cacophony that echoed off the walls.\n\nThe cake, despite its appearance, was delicious, its sweetness a fitting end to the evening's festivities. As we settled into the living room, cups of coffee and tea in hand, the conversation turned to memories of past birthdays, each story a thread in the tapestry of our family's history.\n\nIt was then that my grandmother spoke, her voice soft but clear. \"Do you remember the year we went to the lake for your birthday?\" she asked my mother, a twinkle in her eye.\n\nMy mother laughed, nodding. \"How could I forget? Jake fell in and nearly drowned.\"\n\n\"I was pushed,\" Jake interjected, feigning indignation.\n\n\"You tripped over your own feet,\" Sarah countered, shaking her head.\n\nThe memory, like so many others, was a blend of humor and chaos, a reminder of the love that bound us despite our flaws. As the evening drew to a close, and the family began to disperse, I felt a sense of contentment settle over me, a warmth that lingered like the fading glow of the candles on my mother's cake.\n\nIn the aftermath of the gathering, as I surveyed the mess left behind, I realized that the evening's chaos had revealed something profound about our family. We were imperfect, a collection of mismatched pieces held together by love and shared history. Our gatherings, with all their mishaps and laughter, were a testament to our connection and belonging, a reminder that even in dysfunction, there was beauty.\n\nAs I began to clean up, my grandmother joined me, her presence a comforting balm against the quiet that had settled over the house.\n\n\"You did well, dear,\" she said, her voice gentle.\n\n\"Thanks, Grandma,\" I replied, feeling a swell of gratitude for her unwavering support.\n\nAs we worked together, I felt the weight of our family's legacy, a tapestry of memories and traditions that bound us together. The evening had been a symphony of chaos, but it was our chaos, a reflection of the love and dysfunction that defined us.\n\nIn the end, it was the unexpected moments, the spilled wine and the lopsided cake, that had revealed the deepest truths about our family. We were a tangled web of love and resentment, each thread pulling us closer and pushing us apart, but in that complexity, there was a beauty that was uniquely ours.\n\nAs the last dish was washed and the lights dimmed, I felt a sense of peace, a quiet understanding that despite the chaos, or perhaps because of it, I belonged. And in that belonging, there was love.",

        "ground_truth": "Some days or weeks or months or years before Mom died, I got her laughing about the Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that bad,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat one guy had a bag of meth,\u201d I told her.\n\n\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t smoke it,\u201d she responded. \u201cHe kept it in his pocket.\u201d\n\nTrue. He didn\u2019t. But even if he did, I don\u2019t think the night could have been any worse.\n\nMom was living in a house with several apartments in Bangor, Maine, at the time. Before living there, she lived in the town next over for seven years, but due to her drinking and her temper, got evicted, which is how she ended up in Bangor\u2014in a housing complex for Native tenants only. Mom tried so hard\u2014so, so hard\u2014to stay sober. And she did, occasionally. Weeks and months would go by when I don\u2019t think she was drinking. Or if she was, she had learned to control her temper. And it was around the time of that Thanksgiving\u2014the Thanksgiving\u2014when she had been sober. Clearheaded. When she called me, she no longer asked for money, asked for rides, asked for a pack of cigarettes. I want to say she was loving and caring and motherly, but even when she drank, she was those things too. I suppose she was just better. And that\u2019s why, when she said she wanted to host Thanksgiving, I was excited. Jess, my sister, was getting out of prison\u2014she served a one-year sentence for theft, on top of priors. According to an article in the local paper, which Mom had cut out and taped on the fridge next to an article about an award I won, Jess had been one of \u201cthree arrested after chicken, potatoes, vodka stolen from grocer,\u201d and she would be there. I was busy with something the day before Thanksgiving when my sister was released, and I told Mom I couldn\u2019t go with her to get Jess at the bus stop, so I didn\u2019t get to see her take her first step off the bus into the free world. My sister and I had written once a month for the year she was in prison. The only thing I remembered from the letters was that my sister\u2019s walking partner was Roxanne Jeskey, a woman convicted of torturing and murdering her husband with a wooden towel rack with nails protruding, needle-nose pliers, and a metal broom handle. Jess said that Roxanne was a good lady. In a text I sent Jess\u2014to make sure I was right that this was true\u2014she wrote back: \u201cShe was a very sweet little old lady who encouraged me to walk with her outside every day to feel better! There I am only doing a year and super depressed and that poor lady had life!\u201d\n\nA very sweet little old lady!\n\nWhile I couldn\u2019t pick my sister up at the bus stop with my mom, I reassured her I\u2019d be at Thanksgiving. Mom was so excited to have her son and daughter together, and part of that excitement, I think, came from the fact that she was sober and so was my sister. Hell, that got me excited too\u2014the first Thanksgiving, far as I can remember, with a sober mother and a sober sister. I imagined it would be a quiet gathering. We\u2019d be in Mom\u2019s cluttered bedroom in her tiny apartment filled with stale cigarette smoke while we sat on the bed and ate turkey, scalloped potatoes, green beans, bread, and cranberry sauce, and along the way Mom would turn down her TV\u2014she\u2019d be watching The Real Housewives of some fucking county\u2014so we could hear each other chew and talk. And in between bites of food we\u2019d ask Jess about prison, and she\u2019d crack jokes, and eventually we would ask her what Roxanne was really like, and Jess would say, Yeah, she told me after she cut off her husband\u2019s penis that she held it over her head and spun it around, pretending to escape the police in a penis-propelled helicopter, and then we\u2019d all laugh and Jess would say, No, no, she was a very nice lady, always asked me how I was doing, and then Jess would get up and ask us if we wanted more cranberry sauce and while she was in the kitchen she\u2019d wonder why Mom never wrote to her.\n\nBut that\u2019s too perfect, right? At least for our family it is.\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day, I got to Mom\u2019s around four in the afternoon. The driveway, which dipped down into a hill, was slick and icy, and so when I parked, I pulled up my emergency brake. I got out and looked up at the second floor, where Mom\u2019s apartment was. A light was on, the window open, and I heard their voices.\n\nThe stairs to Mom\u2019s apartment were narrow and twisty\u2014it\u2019s hyperbole to compare them to the Stairs of Cirith Ungol, but I bet Mom would find that true since she had terrible arthritis and a rod in her leg and that climb was tough\u2014and I climbed them to the top. The door was locked, so I knocked. No answer, but I heard them talking and then laughing. I knocked again, louder, and when the door swung open there was Jess\u2019s ex-boyfriend, Dan. Dan was really good at dumpster diving. He lived in a tent behind Hobby Lobby, even in the winter. Jess lived there too sometimes.\n\nDan was nice. Or so he seemed. I suppose I can say he was one of the nicer men my sister dated, one of the nicer men my sister loved.\n\nHe smiled at me\u2014all but one tooth straight\u2014and he ushered me into the living room, where Mom stood with an apron on and an unlit cigarette between her fingers. Jess was on the floor, cans of Natty Daddies surrounding her like a wall, a fortress, and she got up and from the floor and gave me a beery hug.\n\n\u201cHi, honey,\u201d Mom said, and she told me to follow her into the small kitchen.\n\nMom stirred gravy on the stove. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019s drinking,\u201d she said. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Next to the stove was a cup with tinfoil folded over the top like a lid, a pink bendy straw pierced through it. Did Mom really not know we all knew that\u2019s how she drank? How she tried to hide it?\n\n\u201cRight when she got off the bus,\u201d Mom said, stirring, \u201cshe said she was going to get drunk. Whatever. She\u2019s a grown woman.\u201d\n\nShe drank from the cup with the straw.\n\nThe excitement I felt didn\u2019t immediately turn to disappointment. It was gradual. Sure, it started with seeing my sister\u2019s year of sobriety disappear, started by seeing Dan\u2014yeah, he was nice, but my sister could do better than a guy who lived in a tent behind Hobby Lobby\u2014started by seeing Mom pick up a drink. But the real disappointment came when more guests showed up.\n\nThree, to be exact.\n\nFirst there was Jeremy, a man in his thirties who my mom met at the methadone clinic (she always said she went for pain management, and in a way that\u2019s the truth).\n\n\u201cGod bless you,\u201d she said to him when he showed up with a can of cranberry sauce.\n\n\u201cThis your son?\u201d he asked.\n\nSecond, there was a tall older man, standing behind Jeremy. I can\u2019t remember who the hell he was. He was either a former priest or a pastor, but what I do know is that at that time, he was looking after Jeremy and his sobriety.\n\nThird and finally was the last person I expected: the schizophrenic woman who lived three houses down and who always\u2014and I mean always\u2014stood outside in the middle of the yard smoking.\n\n\u201cLiza, dear,\u201d Mom said. \u201cYou came.\u201d\n\nLiza\u2019s voice was raspy. \u201cYou got a cigarette?\u201d\n\nMom\u2019s apartment was already small to begin with, but just then it felt even smaller. In the living room, I stood while Jess and Dan drank and laughed on the floor, while Liza stood looking out the window, smoking, while Jeremy kept asking my mother if she needed help with anything in the kitchen, and while the priest smiled at us, all of us, a tribe of misfits and nutjobs and criminals and addicts and weirdos, myself included.\n\n\u201cBaby brother,\u201d my sister said, and I sat with her on the floor, even though she had that nasty booze breath, even though I was unhappy with her choices right then, because that\u2019s what you do when you love someone.\n\n\u201cDid you know,\u201d my sister said, not to me but to the room, \u201cdid you know that my baby brother wrote me all the time while I was in prison. And he sent me books and put money in my commissary.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust wonderful!\u201d the priest exclaimed. \u201cJust absolutely wonderful!\u201d\n\nMom cooked. Jess kept me on the floor with her and Dan. Liza continued to stand by the window. Jeremy moved between room and room, unable to commit to one place. And the priest kept on smiling.\n\nIt\u2019s moments like these, I realize now, with people like us, when the world and the lives within it are at their truest.\n\nEventually the food was ready, which Mom announced, that cigarette in her hand still unlit. But nobody moved. Jess and Dan stayed on the floor, drinking. Jeremy\u2014who had asked me more than once if I\u2019d seen a plastic bag filled with white glass beads\u2014couldn\u2019t stand still. Liza was no longer near the window but was in the middle of the living room, staring at Mom, who was in the hallway, waiting for people to come get food. The priest seemed the readiest to eat\u2014he was moving toward the kitchen with such conviction.\n\nThere was no line or anything\u2014we all just crammed ourselves into the kitchen, the very one Mom died hating because there was no sideboard space. It smelled like cooked meat and potatoes and the sweetness of warmed-up cranberry sauce and booze. Mom picked up a dull serrated blade.\n\n\u201cHappy Turkey Day,\u201d she said, and with the dull knife she tried to cut the turkey\u2019s tied feet. She drew the blade back and forth, back and forth, like the string was a giant log, the knife a bow saw, trying to get through it. My sister laughed. \u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Mom said, and then with such force she got the string cut and you\u2019d think tension would dissolve right then but it didn\u2019t and cooked bird juice and grease and fat flew and splattered all over the wall.\n\nMom licked turkey juice off her fingers and carved the turkey. \u201cHelp yourselves,\u201d she said. We all had plates except Liza. \u201cLiza, honey, do you want me to make you a plate?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got a cigarette?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Mom mumbled.\n\nAfter we all ate\u2014except for my mom, who always ate later, and for Liza, who just smoked her cigarette\u2014I told Mom I had to get going. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you down,\u201d she said, taking her apron off. My sister and I didn\u2019t say goodbye, because it wasn\u2019t goodbye for us\u2014we\u2019d see each other in a day or two or three.\n\nI helped Mom down the narrow and steep stairs, made sure she didn\u2019t fall, and outside she zipped up her jacket and lit a smoke. The sky was clear\u2014I remember that\u2014the night made brighter by the winter moon and stars burning so far away, a distance I sometimes felt with my mom but not right then.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe she drank,\u201d Mom was saying, and judging by the face I made she must have known I knew that she too drank. \u201cI had one drink,\u201d she confessed. \u201cBut I can have a drink, can\u2019t I?\u2019\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, lying, because one wouldn\u2019t be enough. But sometimes you know you just can\u2019t fight the person you love. Love. That\u2019s what that Thanksgiving was full of. Mom made sure I knew that years later, when one time we were again laughing about that night, she said to me, \u201cHoney, to those people, it was a good Thanksgiving, because they were invited. Because they had a place to be and they felt welcomed.\u201d\n\nThat night, in the driveway with her, getting ready to leave, that was what I felt, even though I couldn\u2019t name the feeling.\n\nWe stood there, Mom and I, and after I hugged her goodbye and thanked her for dinner\u2014to which she said, \u201cOf course, my honey\u201d\u2014she scraped her half-smoked cigarette across the icy snow, and I didn\u2019t leave the driveway until I saw she\u2019d made it safely back inside.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The scent of rosemary and thyme wafted through the air, mingling with the sharp tang of cranberry sauce and the buttery richness of mashed potatoes. The kitchen was a cacophony of clattering dishes, beeping timers, and the low hum of the oven. Amelia stood at the stove, stirring a pot of gravy with one hand while balancing a phone against her ear with the other.\n\n\"Yes, Mom, I know. I remember the recipe,\" she said, her voice strained but affectionate. \"I've made it a hundred times.\"\n\nHer mother\u2019s voice crackled through the line, insistent and slightly panicked. \"But don\u2019t forget the secret ingredient. Your father always loved it that way.\"\n\nAmelia sighed, glancing at the recipe card propped up against the backsplash. The familiar scrawl of her father's handwriting was both comforting and heart-wrenching. \"I won't forget, promise.\"\n\nShe hung up, setting the phone down on the counter, and took a deep breath. The house was filled with the noise of family, each room echoing with laughter, arguments, and the occasional burst of music from the living room where her younger cousins were attempting a dance-off. It was Thanksgiving, and the Daniels family was in full swing.\n\nAmelia\u2019s brother, Jake, appeared in the doorway, his hands laden with a tray of deviled eggs. \"Need any help in here?\" he asked, though his tone suggested he hoped the answer was no.\n\nShe gave him a wry smile. \"Always. Can you check on the turkey?\"\n\nJake set the tray down and moved to the oven, peering through the glass. \"Looks good. Smells even better.\"\n\nAs he straightened, their eyes met, and for a moment, the chaos around them faded. They had grown up in this house, the walls steeped in memories of holidays past. Their father\u2019s absence was a palpable void, but they had learned to fill it with new traditions, new laughter.\n\n\"How\u2019s Mom holding up?\" Jake asked, his voice softer now.\n\n\"She\u2019s... managing,\" Amelia replied. \"Called me three times already to remind me about the gravy.\"\n\nJake chuckled, but it was tinged with sadness. \"Some things never change.\"\n\nThey worked in tandem, the rhythm of their movements a testament to years of shared experience. Amelia finished the gravy, and Jake basted the turkey, their unspoken coordination a comfort amidst the noise.\n\nIn the living room, their cousin Lizzie was arguing with her husband, Mark, over the volume of the TV. \"I told you, it\u2019s too loud! Grandma can\u2019t hear herself think,\" Lizzie snapped, grabbing the remote from his hand.\n\nMark threw up his hands in exasperation. \"Fine! Turn it off, then. See if I care.\"\n\nTheir grandmother, seated in her favorite armchair, watched the exchange with mild amusement. \"Oh, let them be, Lizzie. It\u2019s a holiday. We\u2019re supposed to be having fun.\"\n\nLizzie huffed but relented, muting the TV and turning her attention back to her children, who were now engaged in a heated debate over the last piece of pumpkin pie.\n\nAmelia stepped into the room, wiping her hands on a dishtowel. \"Alright, everyone, dinner\u2019s almost ready. Can we try to get along for five minutes?\"\n\nHer plea was met with a chorus of good-natured grumbles and a few teasing remarks. She couldn\u2019t help but smile. This was her family, chaotic and dysfunctional, but undeniably bound by love.\n\nAs they gathered around the table, Amelia felt a pang of nostalgia. The seats were filled, but there was an emptiness that no amount of food or laughter could dispel. Her father\u2019s chair, now occupied by her mother, seemed to hold a silent vigil for the man who had once been the heart of these gatherings.\n\nHer mother raised her glass, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. \"To family,\" she said, her voice wavering but strong. \"And to those who are no longer with us, but whose love still fills this room.\"\n\nGlasses clinked, and for a moment, there was a hush, a collective breath held in remembrance. Then the spell was broken, and the room erupted into conversation and laughter once more.\n\nAmelia watched her family, her heart swelling with a mixture of pride and sorrow. They were messy, imperfect, but they were hers. In the midst of the noise and the arguments, the love that tied them together was unbreakable.\n\nAs the night wore on, the stories flowed as freely as the wine. Tales of childhood mischief, of triumphs and failures, of moments that had shaped them into who they were. Amelia listened, laughed, and shared, feeling the weight of the past and the promise of the future in every word.\n\nIt was late when the doorbell rang, a sharp, unexpected sound that cut through the merriment. Amelia frowned, exchanging a puzzled glance with Jake. \"Who could that be?\"\n\nShe rose from her seat, weaving through the crowded room to the front door. When she opened it, she found herself face to face with a young woman, her hair damp from the rain, a hesitant smile on her lips.\n\n\"Hi,\" the woman said, her voice soft but steady. \"I\u2019m sorry to intrude. My name is Emily. I think... I think I might be your sister.\"\n\nThe room behind Amelia fell silent, all eyes turning toward the door. She felt the world tilt beneath her feet, the ground shifting in ways she could not yet comprehend.\n\n\"Sister?\" she echoed, her mind racing. \"How...?\"\n\nEmily took a deep breath, her eyes searching Amelia\u2019s face. \"I was adopted. I\u2019ve been looking for my birth family for a while now. I didn\u2019t mean to just show up like this, but... it\u2019s Thanksgiving. And I didn\u2019t want to be alone.\"\n\nAmelia\u2019s heart ached at the vulnerability in Emily\u2019s voice, the quiet plea for connection. She glanced back at her family, seeing the shock and curiosity mirrored in their expressions. Her mother\u2019s hand covered her mouth, her eyes wide and brimming with tears.\n\n\"Come in,\" Amelia said, stepping aside to let Emily enter. \"You\u2019re not alone anymore.\"\n\nThe room seemed to hold its breath as Emily stepped inside, her eyes darting around, taking in the faces that were both familiar and strange. Jake was the first to move, crossing the room to offer a tentative smile.\n\n\"Hi, Emily,\" he said, his voice warm. \"I\u2019m Jake. Welcome to the family.\"\n\nOne by one, they introduced themselves, the initial shock giving way to a cautious curiosity. Emily\u2019s presence was a ripple in the fabric of their lives, a new thread woven into the tapestry of their story.\n\nAmelia watched as her mother approached Emily, her hands trembling. \"I... I never knew,\" she whispered, her voice breaking. \"I\u2019m so sorry.\"\n\nEmily shook her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. \"It\u2019s okay. I just... I wanted to know where I came from. To find my roots.\"\n\nHer mother pulled her into a tight embrace, the years of separation and silence dissolving in the warmth of that hug. Amelia felt her own tears spill over, the weight of the moment pressing down on her.\n\nThey gathered around the table once more, making room for Emily, who sat between Jake and their grandmother. The conversation resumed, tentative at first, but soon the laughter and the stories flowed again, now with a new participant.\n\nEmily shared her own story, of her search for her birth family, of the life she had built for herself. Her words were met with encouragement, with acceptance, with love. The Daniels family had always been a patchwork quilt of personalities and histories, and Emily was now a part of that intricate design.\n\nAs the night drew to a close, Amelia found herself standing on the porch, the cool night air a welcome respite from the warmth of the house. Emily joined her, her eyes reflecting the glow of the porch light.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Emily said quietly. \"For welcoming me.\"\n\nAmelia smiled, reaching out to squeeze her hand. \"You\u2019re family. That\u2019s what we do.\"\n\nThey stood in silence for a moment, the weight of the day settling around them. Amelia felt a sense of peace, a quiet certainty that, despite the chaos and the dysfunction, they had found something beautiful. Connection, belonging, love\u2014these were the threads that held them together, even in the most unexpected moments.\n\nAs they turned to go back inside, Amelia knew that this Thanksgiving would be one they would all remember. It was a reminder that family was not just about blood, but about the bonds they chose to forge, the love they chose to give.\n\nAnd in that chaotic, imperfect, wonderful gathering, they had found a deeper truth about what it meant to belong.",
        "story_b": "The kitchen was alive with the sound of clattering pots and the rich aroma of spices. It was the annual Lopez family reunion, a gathering that oscillated between chaos and warmth like a well-tuned symphony teetering on the brink of cacophony. Every year, T\u00eda Carmen insisted on hosting it in her sprawling, albeit slightly dilapidated, home that stood at the end of a cul-de-sac lined with palm trees. Her house was a mishmash of vibrant colors and fading memories, with walls adorned with family portraits and traditional Mexican textiles that told stories of generations past.\n\nThis year was no different; the house was bursting at the seams. Cousins chased each other through the living room, their laughter mingling with the strains of mariachi music blaring from an ancient stereo system. In the corner, a group of aunts exchanged gossip in rapid Spanish, punctuated by the rhythmic chopping of vegetables. The dining room table was a masterpiece of culinary chaos, a long wooden expanse covered with dishes both savory and sweet, each one holding its own significance and flavor.\n\nAt the center of this storm stood Marisol, the one who always seemed to be both part of the family and yet slightly apart. She was T\u00eda Carmen's eldest niece, and her role had been unofficially assigned as the peacemaker, the one who stitched the frayed edges of family ties back together. This year, she had her own quest: to recreate Abuela Rosa's mole, a dish that had become more legend than recipe since her grandmother's passing five years ago.\n\nMarisol had spent countless hours poring over scribbled notes and vague instructions left behind by her grandmother. The mole was more than just a sauce; it was a connection to her roots, a way to bring back a piece of Abuela Rosa that the family sorely missed. Standing over the stove, she stirred the concoction with a wooden spoon, the kitchen's heat wrapping around her like a familiar embrace.\n\n\u201cMarisol, you\u2019re burning it!\u201d T\u00eda Carmen\u2019s voice sliced through the din, jolting Marisol from her reverie.\n\n\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ve got it,\u201d Marisol replied, hastily reducing the heat. She glanced at her aunt, who was expertly flipping tortillas on the comal. \u201cIt just needs a little more time.\u201d\n\nT\u00eda Carmen raised an eyebrow, her expression a blend of skepticism and affection. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not just the ingredients that make a good mole. It\u2019s the love you put into it.\u201d\n\nMarisol nodded, though the weight of those words pressed heavily on her shoulders. She stirred the pot again, the rich, earthy scent of chilies and chocolate rising with the steam, and thought about the last time she had made mole with Abuela Rosa. The memory was vivid\u2014her grandmother's hands, weathered yet gentle, guiding her through each step, whispering secrets about the balance of flavors.\n\nIn the living room, Marisol\u2019s younger brother, Diego, was trying to organize a game of loter\u00eda with the younger cousins, a task akin to herding cats. His voice rose above the chaos, tinged with frustration. \u201cOkay, okay, everyone listen! We need to start if we\u2019re ever going to finish before dinner!\u201d\n\n\u201cDiego, you\u2019re supposed to call the cards, not yell at us,\u201d taunted Sofia, their teenage cousin who always seemed to have a sarcastic remark at the ready.\n\nMarisol smiled at their antics, a familiar sense of nostalgia creeping in. Diego had always been the organizer, the one who tried to impose order on chaos, much like her but in a different, less introspective way.\n\nAs the mole simmered, Marisol found herself reflecting on her role within the family. She had always been the one to mediate arguments, to smooth over misunderstandings with a smile and a soft word. Yet, there was a part of her that wondered if she truly belonged, if her efforts to connect the family were a way to mask her own insecurities about fitting in.\n\nHer thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of her cousin, Javier, who sauntered into the kitchen with a mischievous grin. \u201cI hope you\u2019re not poisoning us with that mole, Mari,\u201d he teased, peering into the pot.\n\n\u201cOnly if you\u2019re the first to try it,\u201d she shot back, playfully swatting his arm with the spoon.\n\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d he laughed, grabbing a handful of freshly fried churros from a plate on the counter. \u201cBut seriously, I\u2019m impressed. Abuela would be proud.\u201d\n\nThe words warmed her more than the kitchen heat ever could. \u201cThanks, Javier. I just hope it tastes as good as hers.\u201d\n\nAs the afternoon wore on, the family settled into a rhythm. The younger children played outside, their shouts echoing through the open windows. The adults congregated around the kitchen and dining room, sipping on homemade horchata and reminiscing about past gatherings. It was a tapestry of love, loud and boisterous, each thread weaving a story of connection and belonging.\n\nFinally, it was time to serve the mole. Marisol, with the help of her cousins, set the table with mismatched plates and silverware, each piece carrying its own history. The family gathered around, a lively buzz of anticipation in the air. As the mole was passed around, Marisol held her breath, waiting for the verdict.\n\nThe first taste was met with silence, a pause that stretched for an eternity. Then, T\u00eda Carmen spoke, her voice thick with emotion. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect, Marisol. Just like Abuela\u2019s.\u201d\n\nA chorus of agreement followed, and Marisol felt a wave of relief and pride wash over her. She had done it. She had brought a piece of Abuela Rosa back to life, if only for an evening. The mole was a success, but more than that, it was a reminder of the ties that bound them all together.\n\nAs dinner progressed, stories flowed as freely as the wine. Marisol listened to her family\u2019s tales, each one more outrageous and heartfelt than the last. There was the time T\u00edo Juan had accidentally set fire to the grill, or when Sofia had secretly adopted a stray dog that had become a beloved family pet. Each story was a thread in their shared tapestry, a testament to their resilience and love.\n\nIt was during one of these stories that Marisol noticed Diego sitting quietly, his usual exuberance subdued. She nudged him gently. \u201cHey, what\u2019s up? You\u2019ve been awfully quiet.\u201d\n\nHe shrugged, a shadow passing over his face. \u201cJust thinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\nDiego hesitated, his eyes flicking to the rest of the family. \u201cI guess\u2026 about how I fit in all of this.\u201d\n\nMarisol\u2019s heart ached at the familiar sentiment. \u201cYou fit because you\u2019re you, Diego. We all have our place here.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we?\u201d He looked at her, his expression earnest. \u201cSometimes I feel like I\u2019m just a part of the background, you know?\u201d\n\nShe nodded, understanding all too well. \u201cI feel like that sometimes too. But maybe that\u2019s just part of being in a big family. We\u2019re all different, but that\u2019s what makes it work.\u201d\n\nDiego offered a small smile, the tension in his shoulders easing. \u201cThanks, Mari. I guess I needed to hear that.\u201d\n\nAs the evening wound down, the family gathered in the living room for one last tradition: the telling of family legends. It was a ritual as old as Marisol could remember, a way to pass down stories that were part truth, part myth. T\u00eda Carmen took the lead, her voice weaving tales of ancestors who had crossed mountains and rivers, who had faced adversity with courage and humor.\n\nMarisol watched her family, the way they leaned in, captivated by the stories that were both familiar and new with each telling. It was in these moments, surrounded by laughter and love, that she felt the deepest connection to them all. They were a family, flawed and beautiful, bound by history and hope.\n\nLater, as she helped T\u00eda Carmen clean up, Marisol found herself reflecting on the day. The chaos, the love, the unexpected moments that revealed so much about who they were. She realized that family wasn\u2019t about fitting perfectly into a mold, but about embracing the imperfections and finding belonging in the shared journey.\n\nT\u00eda Carmen caught her eye, a knowing smile playing on her lips. \u201cYou did good today, Marisol. Abuela would be proud.\u201d\n\nMarisol smiled back, feeling a warmth that had nothing to do with the kitchen. \u201cThanks, T\u00eda. It\u2019s just\u2026 nice to be reminded of what really matters.\u201d\n\nAs the last of the dishes were put away and the house settled into a peaceful silence, Marisol knew that the Lopez family would always be a blend of love and dysfunction, chaos and comfort. And in that beautiful mess, she found her place, her sense of belonging, as sure as the sun would rise again tomorrow.\n\nWith the kitchen finally quiet, Marisol stepped outside into the cool night, the sky a tapestry of stars. She took a deep breath, the scent of mole still lingering on her clothes. It was a reminder, a promise of connection and love, a legacy she would carry forward into the future.\n\nAnd in that moment, standing alone yet surrounded by the spirit of her family, Marisol felt at peace. She was part of something bigger, something that transcended the chaos of a single day. She was home.\n\nThe next morning, as the family slowly stirred awake, the house filled once again with the sounds of life. Breakfast was a simpler affair, a mix of leftover tamales and freshly brewed coffee. Marisol found herself in the kitchen once more, flipping tortillas as Diego shuffled in, his hair tousled from sleep.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d he mumbled, reaching for a mug.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d she replied, handing him a tortilla. \u201cSleep well?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, taking a bite. \u201cThanks for last night.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, understanding unspoken between them. \u201cAnytime.\u201d\n\nAs the day unfolded, the family prepared to say their goodbyes, hugs and promises of keeping in touch exchanged amidst the packing of bags. T\u00eda Carmen stood at the door, her arms open for one last embrace with each departing family member.\n\nWhen it was Marisol\u2019s turn, she held her aunt tightly. \u201cThank you for everything, T\u00eda.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, mija, for reminding us all of what\u2019s important,\u201d T\u00eda Carmen said, her voice thick with emotion.\n\nWith one last look at the house that had been the backdrop to so many memories, Marisol and Diego set off, the road stretching out before them. As they drove away, Marisol glanced in the rearview mirror, seeing the house grow smaller yet somehow more significant.\n\n\u201cReady for next year?\u201d Diego asked, a hint of teasing in his voice.\n\nMarisol laughed, the sound bright and full. \u201cAlways.\u201d\n\nAnd as they headed towards their own lives, the Lopez family reunion became another cherished memory, a testament to the enduring bonds of family. A reminder that in the collision of love and dysfunction, the deepest truths about connection and belonging could be found.",

        "ground_truth": "Some days or weeks or months or years before Mom died, I got her laughing about the Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that bad,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat one guy had a bag of meth,\u201d I told her.\n\n\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t smoke it,\u201d she responded. \u201cHe kept it in his pocket.\u201d\n\nTrue. He didn\u2019t. But even if he did, I don\u2019t think the night could have been any worse.\n\nMom was living in a house with several apartments in Bangor, Maine, at the time. Before living there, she lived in the town next over for seven years, but due to her drinking and her temper, got evicted, which is how she ended up in Bangor\u2014in a housing complex for Native tenants only. Mom tried so hard\u2014so, so hard\u2014to stay sober. And she did, occasionally. Weeks and months would go by when I don\u2019t think she was drinking. Or if she was, she had learned to control her temper. And it was around the time of that Thanksgiving\u2014the Thanksgiving\u2014when she had been sober. Clearheaded. When she called me, she no longer asked for money, asked for rides, asked for a pack of cigarettes. I want to say she was loving and caring and motherly, but even when she drank, she was those things too. I suppose she was just better. And that\u2019s why, when she said she wanted to host Thanksgiving, I was excited. Jess, my sister, was getting out of prison\u2014she served a one-year sentence for theft, on top of priors. According to an article in the local paper, which Mom had cut out and taped on the fridge next to an article about an award I won, Jess had been one of \u201cthree arrested after chicken, potatoes, vodka stolen from grocer,\u201d and she would be there. I was busy with something the day before Thanksgiving when my sister was released, and I told Mom I couldn\u2019t go with her to get Jess at the bus stop, so I didn\u2019t get to see her take her first step off the bus into the free world. My sister and I had written once a month for the year she was in prison. The only thing I remembered from the letters was that my sister\u2019s walking partner was Roxanne Jeskey, a woman convicted of torturing and murdering her husband with a wooden towel rack with nails protruding, needle-nose pliers, and a metal broom handle. Jess said that Roxanne was a good lady. In a text I sent Jess\u2014to make sure I was right that this was true\u2014she wrote back: \u201cShe was a very sweet little old lady who encouraged me to walk with her outside every day to feel better! There I am only doing a year and super depressed and that poor lady had life!\u201d\n\nA very sweet little old lady!\n\nWhile I couldn\u2019t pick my sister up at the bus stop with my mom, I reassured her I\u2019d be at Thanksgiving. Mom was so excited to have her son and daughter together, and part of that excitement, I think, came from the fact that she was sober and so was my sister. Hell, that got me excited too\u2014the first Thanksgiving, far as I can remember, with a sober mother and a sober sister. I imagined it would be a quiet gathering. We\u2019d be in Mom\u2019s cluttered bedroom in her tiny apartment filled with stale cigarette smoke while we sat on the bed and ate turkey, scalloped potatoes, green beans, bread, and cranberry sauce, and along the way Mom would turn down her TV\u2014she\u2019d be watching The Real Housewives of some fucking county\u2014so we could hear each other chew and talk. And in between bites of food we\u2019d ask Jess about prison, and she\u2019d crack jokes, and eventually we would ask her what Roxanne was really like, and Jess would say, Yeah, she told me after she cut off her husband\u2019s penis that she held it over her head and spun it around, pretending to escape the police in a penis-propelled helicopter, and then we\u2019d all laugh and Jess would say, No, no, she was a very nice lady, always asked me how I was doing, and then Jess would get up and ask us if we wanted more cranberry sauce and while she was in the kitchen she\u2019d wonder why Mom never wrote to her.\n\nBut that\u2019s too perfect, right? At least for our family it is.\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day, I got to Mom\u2019s around four in the afternoon. The driveway, which dipped down into a hill, was slick and icy, and so when I parked, I pulled up my emergency brake. I got out and looked up at the second floor, where Mom\u2019s apartment was. A light was on, the window open, and I heard their voices.\n\nThe stairs to Mom\u2019s apartment were narrow and twisty\u2014it\u2019s hyperbole to compare them to the Stairs of Cirith Ungol, but I bet Mom would find that true since she had terrible arthritis and a rod in her leg and that climb was tough\u2014and I climbed them to the top. The door was locked, so I knocked. No answer, but I heard them talking and then laughing. I knocked again, louder, and when the door swung open there was Jess\u2019s ex-boyfriend, Dan. Dan was really good at dumpster diving. He lived in a tent behind Hobby Lobby, even in the winter. Jess lived there too sometimes.\n\nDan was nice. Or so he seemed. I suppose I can say he was one of the nicer men my sister dated, one of the nicer men my sister loved.\n\nHe smiled at me\u2014all but one tooth straight\u2014and he ushered me into the living room, where Mom stood with an apron on and an unlit cigarette between her fingers. Jess was on the floor, cans of Natty Daddies surrounding her like a wall, a fortress, and she got up and from the floor and gave me a beery hug.\n\n\u201cHi, honey,\u201d Mom said, and she told me to follow her into the small kitchen.\n\nMom stirred gravy on the stove. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019s drinking,\u201d she said. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Next to the stove was a cup with tinfoil folded over the top like a lid, a pink bendy straw pierced through it. Did Mom really not know we all knew that\u2019s how she drank? How she tried to hide it?\n\n\u201cRight when she got off the bus,\u201d Mom said, stirring, \u201cshe said she was going to get drunk. Whatever. She\u2019s a grown woman.\u201d\n\nShe drank from the cup with the straw.\n\nThe excitement I felt didn\u2019t immediately turn to disappointment. It was gradual. Sure, it started with seeing my sister\u2019s year of sobriety disappear, started by seeing Dan\u2014yeah, he was nice, but my sister could do better than a guy who lived in a tent behind Hobby Lobby\u2014started by seeing Mom pick up a drink. But the real disappointment came when more guests showed up.\n\nThree, to be exact.\n\nFirst there was Jeremy, a man in his thirties who my mom met at the methadone clinic (she always said she went for pain management, and in a way that\u2019s the truth).\n\n\u201cGod bless you,\u201d she said to him when he showed up with a can of cranberry sauce.\n\n\u201cThis your son?\u201d he asked.\n\nSecond, there was a tall older man, standing behind Jeremy. I can\u2019t remember who the hell he was. He was either a former priest or a pastor, but what I do know is that at that time, he was looking after Jeremy and his sobriety.\n\nThird and finally was the last person I expected: the schizophrenic woman who lived three houses down and who always\u2014and I mean always\u2014stood outside in the middle of the yard smoking.\n\n\u201cLiza, dear,\u201d Mom said. \u201cYou came.\u201d\n\nLiza\u2019s voice was raspy. \u201cYou got a cigarette?\u201d\n\nMom\u2019s apartment was already small to begin with, but just then it felt even smaller. In the living room, I stood while Jess and Dan drank and laughed on the floor, while Liza stood looking out the window, smoking, while Jeremy kept asking my mother if she needed help with anything in the kitchen, and while the priest smiled at us, all of us, a tribe of misfits and nutjobs and criminals and addicts and weirdos, myself included.\n\n\u201cBaby brother,\u201d my sister said, and I sat with her on the floor, even though she had that nasty booze breath, even though I was unhappy with her choices right then, because that\u2019s what you do when you love someone.\n\n\u201cDid you know,\u201d my sister said, not to me but to the room, \u201cdid you know that my baby brother wrote me all the time while I was in prison. And he sent me books and put money in my commissary.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust wonderful!\u201d the priest exclaimed. \u201cJust absolutely wonderful!\u201d\n\nMom cooked. Jess kept me on the floor with her and Dan. Liza continued to stand by the window. Jeremy moved between room and room, unable to commit to one place. And the priest kept on smiling.\n\nIt\u2019s moments like these, I realize now, with people like us, when the world and the lives within it are at their truest.\n\nEventually the food was ready, which Mom announced, that cigarette in her hand still unlit. But nobody moved. Jess and Dan stayed on the floor, drinking. Jeremy\u2014who had asked me more than once if I\u2019d seen a plastic bag filled with white glass beads\u2014couldn\u2019t stand still. Liza was no longer near the window but was in the middle of the living room, staring at Mom, who was in the hallway, waiting for people to come get food. The priest seemed the readiest to eat\u2014he was moving toward the kitchen with such conviction.\n\nThere was no line or anything\u2014we all just crammed ourselves into the kitchen, the very one Mom died hating because there was no sideboard space. It smelled like cooked meat and potatoes and the sweetness of warmed-up cranberry sauce and booze. Mom picked up a dull serrated blade.\n\n\u201cHappy Turkey Day,\u201d she said, and with the dull knife she tried to cut the turkey\u2019s tied feet. She drew the blade back and forth, back and forth, like the string was a giant log, the knife a bow saw, trying to get through it. My sister laughed. \u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Mom said, and then with such force she got the string cut and you\u2019d think tension would dissolve right then but it didn\u2019t and cooked bird juice and grease and fat flew and splattered all over the wall.\n\nMom licked turkey juice off her fingers and carved the turkey. \u201cHelp yourselves,\u201d she said. We all had plates except Liza. \u201cLiza, honey, do you want me to make you a plate?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got a cigarette?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Mom mumbled.\n\nAfter we all ate\u2014except for my mom, who always ate later, and for Liza, who just smoked her cigarette\u2014I told Mom I had to get going. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you down,\u201d she said, taking her apron off. My sister and I didn\u2019t say goodbye, because it wasn\u2019t goodbye for us\u2014we\u2019d see each other in a day or two or three.\n\nI helped Mom down the narrow and steep stairs, made sure she didn\u2019t fall, and outside she zipped up her jacket and lit a smoke. The sky was clear\u2014I remember that\u2014the night made brighter by the winter moon and stars burning so far away, a distance I sometimes felt with my mom but not right then.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe she drank,\u201d Mom was saying, and judging by the face I made she must have known I knew that she too drank. \u201cI had one drink,\u201d she confessed. \u201cBut I can have a drink, can\u2019t I?\u2019\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, lying, because one wouldn\u2019t be enough. But sometimes you know you just can\u2019t fight the person you love. Love. That\u2019s what that Thanksgiving was full of. Mom made sure I knew that years later, when one time we were again laughing about that night, she said to me, \u201cHoney, to those people, it was a good Thanksgiving, because they were invited. Because they had a place to be and they felt welcomed.\u201d\n\nThat night, in the driveway with her, getting ready to leave, that was what I felt, even though I couldn\u2019t name the feeling.\n\nWe stood there, Mom and I, and after I hugged her goodbye and thanked her for dinner\u2014to which she said, \u201cOf course, my honey\u201d\u2014she scraped her half-smoked cigarette across the icy snow, and I didn\u2019t leave the driveway until I saw she\u2019d made it safely back inside.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The scent of rosemary and thyme wafted through the air, mingling with the sharp tang of cranberry sauce and the buttery richness of mashed potatoes. The kitchen was a cacophony of clattering dishes, beeping timers, and the low hum of the oven. Amelia stood at the stove, stirring a pot of gravy with one hand while balancing a phone against her ear with the other.\n\n\"Yes, Mom, I know. I remember the recipe,\" she said, her voice strained but affectionate. \"I've made it a hundred times.\"\n\nHer mother\u2019s voice crackled through the line, insistent and slightly panicked. \"But don\u2019t forget the secret ingredient. Your father always loved it that way.\"\n\nAmelia sighed, glancing at the recipe card propped up against the backsplash. The familiar scrawl of her father's handwriting was both comforting and heart-wrenching. \"I won't forget, promise.\"\n\nShe hung up, setting the phone down on the counter, and took a deep breath. The house was filled with the noise of family, each room echoing with laughter, arguments, and the occasional burst of music from the living room where her younger cousins were attempting a dance-off. It was Thanksgiving, and the Daniels family was in full swing.\n\nAmelia\u2019s brother, Jake, appeared in the doorway, his hands laden with a tray of deviled eggs. \"Need any help in here?\" he asked, though his tone suggested he hoped the answer was no.\n\nShe gave him a wry smile. \"Always. Can you check on the turkey?\"\n\nJake set the tray down and moved to the oven, peering through the glass. \"Looks good. Smells even better.\"\n\nAs he straightened, their eyes met, and for a moment, the chaos around them faded. They had grown up in this house, the walls steeped in memories of holidays past. Their father\u2019s absence was a palpable void, but they had learned to fill it with new traditions, new laughter.\n\n\"How\u2019s Mom holding up?\" Jake asked, his voice softer now.\n\n\"She\u2019s... managing,\" Amelia replied. \"Called me three times already to remind me about the gravy.\"\n\nJake chuckled, but it was tinged with sadness. \"Some things never change.\"\n\nThey worked in tandem, the rhythm of their movements a testament to years of shared experience. Amelia finished the gravy, and Jake basted the turkey, their unspoken coordination a comfort amidst the noise.\n\nIn the living room, their cousin Lizzie was arguing with her husband, Mark, over the volume of the TV. \"I told you, it\u2019s too loud! Grandma can\u2019t hear herself think,\" Lizzie snapped, grabbing the remote from his hand.\n\nMark threw up his hands in exasperation. \"Fine! Turn it off, then. See if I care.\"\n\nTheir grandmother, seated in her favorite armchair, watched the exchange with mild amusement. \"Oh, let them be, Lizzie. It\u2019s a holiday. We\u2019re supposed to be having fun.\"\n\nLizzie huffed but relented, muting the TV and turning her attention back to her children, who were now engaged in a heated debate over the last piece of pumpkin pie.\n\nAmelia stepped into the room, wiping her hands on a dishtowel. \"Alright, everyone, dinner\u2019s almost ready. Can we try to get along for five minutes?\"\n\nHer plea was met with a chorus of good-natured grumbles and a few teasing remarks. She couldn\u2019t help but smile. This was her family, chaotic and dysfunctional, but undeniably bound by love.\n\nAs they gathered around the table, Amelia felt a pang of nostalgia. The seats were filled, but there was an emptiness that no amount of food or laughter could dispel. Her father\u2019s chair, now occupied by her mother, seemed to hold a silent vigil for the man who had once been the heart of these gatherings.\n\nHer mother raised her glass, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. \"To family,\" she said, her voice wavering but strong. \"And to those who are no longer with us, but whose love still fills this room.\"\n\nGlasses clinked, and for a moment, there was a hush, a collective breath held in remembrance. Then the spell was broken, and the room erupted into conversation and laughter once more.\n\nAmelia watched her family, her heart swelling with a mixture of pride and sorrow. They were messy, imperfect, but they were hers. In the midst of the noise and the arguments, the love that tied them together was unbreakable.\n\nAs the night wore on, the stories flowed as freely as the wine. Tales of childhood mischief, of triumphs and failures, of moments that had shaped them into who they were. Amelia listened, laughed, and shared, feeling the weight of the past and the promise of the future in every word.\n\nIt was late when the doorbell rang, a sharp, unexpected sound that cut through the merriment. Amelia frowned, exchanging a puzzled glance with Jake. \"Who could that be?\"\n\nShe rose from her seat, weaving through the crowded room to the front door. When she opened it, she found herself face to face with a young woman, her hair damp from the rain, a hesitant smile on her lips.\n\n\"Hi,\" the woman said, her voice soft but steady. \"I\u2019m sorry to intrude. My name is Emily. I think... I think I might be your sister.\"\n\nThe room behind Amelia fell silent, all eyes turning toward the door. She felt the world tilt beneath her feet, the ground shifting in ways she could not yet comprehend.\n\n\"Sister?\" she echoed, her mind racing. \"How...?\"\n\nEmily took a deep breath, her eyes searching Amelia\u2019s face. \"I was adopted. I\u2019ve been looking for my birth family for a while now. I didn\u2019t mean to just show up like this, but... it\u2019s Thanksgiving. And I didn\u2019t want to be alone.\"\n\nAmelia\u2019s heart ached at the vulnerability in Emily\u2019s voice, the quiet plea for connection. She glanced back at her family, seeing the shock and curiosity mirrored in their expressions. Her mother\u2019s hand covered her mouth, her eyes wide and brimming with tears.\n\n\"Come in,\" Amelia said, stepping aside to let Emily enter. \"You\u2019re not alone anymore.\"\n\nThe room seemed to hold its breath as Emily stepped inside, her eyes darting around, taking in the faces that were both familiar and strange. Jake was the first to move, crossing the room to offer a tentative smile.\n\n\"Hi, Emily,\" he said, his voice warm. \"I\u2019m Jake. Welcome to the family.\"\n\nOne by one, they introduced themselves, the initial shock giving way to a cautious curiosity. Emily\u2019s presence was a ripple in the fabric of their lives, a new thread woven into the tapestry of their story.\n\nAmelia watched as her mother approached Emily, her hands trembling. \"I... I never knew,\" she whispered, her voice breaking. \"I\u2019m so sorry.\"\n\nEmily shook her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. \"It\u2019s okay. I just... I wanted to know where I came from. To find my roots.\"\n\nHer mother pulled her into a tight embrace, the years of separation and silence dissolving in the warmth of that hug. Amelia felt her own tears spill over, the weight of the moment pressing down on her.\n\nThey gathered around the table once more, making room for Emily, who sat between Jake and their grandmother. The conversation resumed, tentative at first, but soon the laughter and the stories flowed again, now with a new participant.\n\nEmily shared her own story, of her search for her birth family, of the life she had built for herself. Her words were met with encouragement, with acceptance, with love. The Daniels family had always been a patchwork quilt of personalities and histories, and Emily was now a part of that intricate design.\n\nAs the night drew to a close, Amelia found herself standing on the porch, the cool night air a welcome respite from the warmth of the house. Emily joined her, her eyes reflecting the glow of the porch light.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Emily said quietly. \"For welcoming me.\"\n\nAmelia smiled, reaching out to squeeze her hand. \"You\u2019re family. That\u2019s what we do.\"\n\nThey stood in silence for a moment, the weight of the day settling around them. Amelia felt a sense of peace, a quiet certainty that, despite the chaos and the dysfunction, they had found something beautiful. Connection, belonging, love\u2014these were the threads that held them together, even in the most unexpected moments.\n\nAs they turned to go back inside, Amelia knew that this Thanksgiving would be one they would all remember. It was a reminder that family was not just about blood, but about the bonds they chose to forge, the love they chose to give.\n\nAnd in that chaotic, imperfect, wonderful gathering, they had found a deeper truth about what it meant to belong.",
        "story_b": "The old house on Maple Street, with its creaky floorboards and faded wallpaper, stood like a relic of another time, cradling the sounds of the past within its walls. It was a place where voices echoed and memories lingered. As the early evening sun dipped below the horizon, the family began to gather, a motley crew of personalities and histories converging under one roof. It was Grandma Rosa\u2019s 80th birthday, and she insisted on celebrating at the house where she had raised her children, instilling in them a love for their roots and a fierce sense of independence.\n\nThe kitchen was a whirlwind of activity. The table was laden with dishes, an array of traditional foods that spoke of their heritage. There were tamales, mole, and arroz con pollo, each dish prepared with the kind of care and precision that only came from years of practice. The aroma of chiles and spices filled the air, mingling with the sound of laughter and clattering dishes.\n\nIn the midst of this culinary chaos, Carmen, the eldest daughter, was stirring a pot of beans, her brow furrowed with concentration. \u201cMira, Juan! You\u2019re burning the tortillas!\u201d she shouted across the kitchen to her brother, who was juggling a spatula and a phone, trying to balance his duties as a cook and a father. Juan glanced up, flashing a sheepish grin as he flipped the tortillas with a practiced flick of his wrist.\n\n\u201cRelax, hermana, I got this,\u201d he replied, though the slightly charred edges of the tortillas suggested otherwise.\n\nNearby, in the living room, the younger children were playing, their laughter a bright counterpoint to the adults\u2019 conversations. Little Ana, with her wild curls and gap-toothed smile, was trying to teach her cousin Diego how to dance, her small feet tapping out a rhythm on the wooden floor. The adults watched with a mixture of amusement and exasperation, their voices rising and falling like a tide.\n\nAs the clock ticked towards dinner, the tension in the house began to build. It was an unspoken tradition that at every family gathering, some argument would ignite, sparking a firestorm of opinions and emotions. This time, it was Uncle Roberto, his booming voice cutting through the chatter as he launched into a tirade about the family\u2019s reluctance to support local businesses. \u201cWe\u2019re losing our culture,\u201d he declared, gesturing emphatically with his glass of wine, \u201cbecause we\u2019re too busy buying everything from those big box stores!\u201d\n\nHis brother, Miguel, rolled his eyes, leaning back in his chair with a sigh. \u201cOh, here we go again,\u201d he muttered under his breath, exchanging a knowing glance with his wife, Maria. She shrugged, used to these outbursts, and continued setting the table.\n\nGrandma Rosa, seated at the head of the table, watched the exchange with a bemused smile. Her eyes, still sharp and bright despite her years, moved from one family member to the next, observing, absorbing. She was the anchor of this family, a repository of stories and wisdom, and she knew better than to intervene too soon. These arguments were as much a part of their gatherings as the food and laughter, a cathartic release of pent-up frustrations and grievances.\n\nAs the argument simmered, Carmen called everyone to the table, her voice slicing through the discord. \u201cDinner\u2019s ready!\u201d she announced, and slowly, reluctantly, the family gathered around, the lure of food momentarily quelling the storm.\n\nThey ate in a flurry of passing plates and clinking cutlery, the conversation ebbing and flowing, punctuated by bursts of laughter and the occasional sharp retort. As the meal wound down, Grandma Rosa cleared her throat, drawing all eyes to her. She had a story to tell, and when Grandma Rosa spoke, everyone listened.\n\n\u201cI remember,\u201d she began, her voice steady and warm, \u201ca family reunion when I was just a girl. It was just after the war, and times were hard. We didn\u2019t have much, but we had each other, and that was enough.\u201d\n\nHer story unfolded in the room like a tapestry, weaving together strands of memory and history. She spoke of a time when her family gathered in a small village in the mountains, where the air was thin and the nights were cold. They had come together to celebrate life, to dance and sing and remember those they had lost. It had been a chaotic affair, full of clashing personalities and old grievances, but in the midst of it all, there was a moment of profound connection\u2014a ceremonial dance that brought them together, transcending their differences.\n\nAs she spoke, the room seemed to hold its breath, the family drawn into the web of her words. They could see the flickering firelight, hear the music, feel the warmth of bodies moving in unison. It was a story of love and resilience, a reminder of the bonds that held them together even when everything else seemed to fall apart.\n\nWhen she finished, there was a moment of silence, a collective pause as the family absorbed the weight of her words. Then, slowly, the conversation resumed, softer now, more reflective. The argument had cooled, replaced by a sense of shared understanding.\n\nIn the quiet that followed, Carmen leaned back in her chair, her eyes drifting to the window. She thought of her own struggles, balancing her career with her responsibilities to her family, the constant push and pull between the life she wanted and the life she felt she owed to those who came before her. It was a struggle familiar to many at the table, a theme that ran through their family\u2019s history like a thread.\n\nShe glanced at her brother, Juan, who was trying to coax Ana into eating her vegetables. He caught her eye and grinned, a silent acknowledgment of their shared journey. They had been through so much together, weathered storms and celebrated triumphs, and through it all, they had remained connected, bound by blood and history.\n\nThe evening wore on, and as the moon rose high in the sky, the family began to disperse, drifting into smaller groups or slipping out into the night. The house grew quieter, the chaos of the day fading into a gentle hum.\n\nIn the kitchen, Carmen found Grandma Rosa, tidying up despite her protests that she should rest. \u201cAbuela, let me help you,\u201d she said, reaching for the plates.\n\nGrandma Rosa waved her off with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m not so old that I can\u2019t clean up my own kitchen,\u201d she replied, her voice firm but affectionate. \u201cBesides, I like to do it. It gives me time to think.\u201d\n\nCarmen hesitated, then nodded, understanding that her grandmother needed this time, this space. She left the kitchen and wandered outside, where the cool night air wrapped around her like a shawl. She stood on the porch, looking out at the familiar landscape, the trees swaying gently in the breeze.\n\nShe thought of the stories she had heard that night, the layers of history and memory that made up her family. She thought of the challenges they faced, the way they clung to their traditions even as the world changed around them. It was a delicate balance, a dance of love and dysfunction, but it was theirs.\n\nAs she stood there, she felt a hand on her shoulder. It was Juan, his expression soft and thoughtful. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, his voice low.\n\nShe nodded, leaning into him. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just thinking about everything.\u201d\n\nHe chuckled softly. \u201cYou\u2019re always thinking too much.\u201d\n\nShe smiled, nudging him playfully. \u201cAnd you\u2019re always thinking too little.\u201d\n\nThey stood there together, siblings united against the night, their breath mingling in the chill air. It was a moment of quiet connection, a reminder of the strength that came from being part of something larger than themselves.\n\nInside, the house was settling into silence, the echoes of the day fading into the walls. Grandma Rosa finished her tidying and turned off the lights, her heart full of gratitude and love. She knew that her family was far from perfect, that they would continue to clash and argue, to struggle and strive. But she also knew that they would always come back to this place, to the warmth and chaos of their shared history.\n\nAnd in that knowledge, she found peace.\n\nAs the stars twinkled overhead, the family drifted to their beds, the house enveloping them in its embrace. It was a place of love and dysfunction, of stories and secrets, and it was home.",

In a year, he will not be alive, whether I write or don\u2019t write this story about him. Except perhaps alive in the way stories live, or alive as people say people are alive in stories. People saying that as if they do not understand: dead once, dead forever. As if they don\u2019t know that once is all the time a person ever gets to be alive. As if they don\u2019t know that G.F. doesn\u2019t hear, doesn\u2019t desire mourning, clamor, and cries. As if they do not comprehend that their millions of bodies piled up or kneeling in prayer or prostrate in the street next to G.F. all weigh less than this sheet of paper on which I scribble, and that the commotion, agitation, exercise of their millions upon millions of hearts and minds will not summon a single breath of air when G.F. needs it.\n\nI will not pretend to bring G.F. to life. Nor pretend to bring life to him. G.F. gone for good. Won\u2019t return. No place for G.F. except the past. And the past is not even past, a wise man once declared. Same abyss behind and in front of us is what the wisecracker writer signifying, I believe, and, if I truly believe what he believed, where would I situate G.F. if presented with an opportunity to put him somewhere alive? Not here. Not here in this story where I know better.\n\nBetter to forget G.F. Better to let go, or simply leave G.F. alone, thank you, than attempt to invent the point of view of a person not here, not where I am, a person who somehow possesses the power to see G.F. breathing, moving around, to hear G.F.\u2019s thoughts. A person also able to observe me here, myself performing this grief, this terror and anger, this attempt to console myself and define and control and locate myself, establish myself as one who is offering a story about G.F., a true story confirming my suffering, my connection to him, a story about who he is, who I am, a story about myself, as if I am not here where I am and he is not where he is. As if the two of us not permanently separate as life from death. As dreams from objects dreamed.\n\nBetter to acknowledge impenetrable darkness surrounding G.F. and me, black darkness blinding me when I pretend I can speak with the authority of a being I imagine whose perspective absolutely reliable. Why write as if I can access the power such an angelic being might possess. As if I am able to employ that power to see, to enter G.F. Power to convince myself, or anybody who might be paying attention or reading or simply curious, that my feelings for G.F., my performance, my outrage, my rituals of claiming and disclaiming an unbreakable relationship to him are authentic. Serve some useful purpose. That my eyes, words reliable, convincing as words, eyes of that imaginary observer I proposed a few sentences ago. Why call upon some sort of supernatural observer to bear witness. Attempt to own that point of view. Imitating it to move closer to G.F. Move outside myself.\n\nI find each move unsatisfactory. A kind of presumption. Wishful thinking at best. Guilt and avoidance at worst. Pretending not to be here where I am, here with many millions of others upset over G.F., people who watch online, who march, throng avenues and streets, behind mikes, on TV, in front of TVs, assuming they may be rightfully, righteously blamed, perhaps, but also hoping to be spared, forgiven. Given another chance. Here in this place where I am, too. Whether or not I pretend I can inhabit some impossibly different space. A place elsewhere in which I am neither exactly dead nor alive, where I am suspended, invisible, yet able to observe myself and observe G.F. as neither living nor dead. Despite absolute darkness, to observe G.F. here, to observe myself here, despite or because we are not present here, but elsewhere, nowhere in fact, or wherever anybody chooses to imagine or not imagine she or he might be. Wherever I\u2019m pretending I am.\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\nFor example, pretending not to breathe. A cop knee pressing down on the neck. Choking, suffocating me.

Wonder what street. What city. Wonder how long dead while wondering.\n\nHow long. How long. How to make it real. Not to bid a victim, loved or unloved, adieu. Not to say farewell.

        "story_a": "Sylvia sat on the edge of her bed, the evening light casting long shadows through the curtains. The room was heavy with the scent of lavender, a remnant of her mother\u2019s daily ritual. She glanced at the photograph on her bedside table\u2014her parents on their wedding day, smiling with a brightness that seemed almost foreign now. She traced the silver frame with her fingers, feeling the cool metal beneath her touch. Remembering was not a passive act; it was an act of defiance.\n\nHer father\u2019s voice echoed in her mind: \u201cThe past is a teacher, not a tyrant.\u201d He had said this often, usually when Sylvia\u2019s mother urged him to let go of old grievances, to move forward. But her father, with his quiet resolve, held on to every detail. He kept journals, meticulously cataloged, filled with memories and reflections. It was his way of resisting a world that seemed eager to forget.\n\nSylvia\u2019s own memories of her father were fragmented, like pieces of a shattered mirror. He had died when she was thirteen, his heart giving out under the strain of too many unspoken words. She remembered the way he would sit at the kitchen table, his hands clasped around a cup of coffee, staring into the distance as if searching for something just out of reach. Those mornings were silent, the air thick with unvoiced thoughts.\n\nHer mother, in contrast, embraced the present with a fervor that left little room for the past. \u201cWe must live for today,\u201d she would say, her voice bright and insistent. Sylvia had always found this sentiment hollow, a denial of the weight that the past carried. It was as if her mother were running from something, a shadow that grew longer with each passing year.\n\nNow, at twenty-seven, Sylvia felt the pull of her father\u2019s legacy more acutely than ever. She had inherited his journals, each one a testament to the power of memory. She spent hours poring over them, the pages yellowed and brittle, the ink fading but still legible. They were filled with stories\u2014his childhood in a small coastal town, his first love, the birth of Sylvia herself. Each entry was a piece of a larger mosaic, a map of a life lived in defiance of forgetting.\n\nOne journal, in particular, held her attention. It was the last one he had written, the entries growing more sporadic as his health declined. There was a passage that Sylvia returned to often, a reflection on the nature of memory itself: \u201cTo remember is to resist the erasure of our existence. It is to hold on to the threads that bind us to each other, to the world.\u201d\n\nThese words resonated with Sylvia, a mantra that guided her through the labyrinth of her own memories. She thought of her father\u2019s voice, the way it would rise and fall like the tide, carrying with it the weight of history. She remembered his hands, calloused and strong, the way they would cradle her face when she was a child, anchoring her in a world that often felt adrift.\n\nSylvia\u2019s own memories were a patchwork quilt, stitched together with threads of joy and sorrow. She remembered the scent of pine from their family trips to the mountains, the sound of her father\u2019s laughter as they huddled around a campfire. She remembered the silence of the hospital room, the beeping of machines that marked the passing of time with a cold precision. These memories were her inheritance, a legacy that she carried with her like a sacred trust.\n\nHer mother, meanwhile, had moved on in a way that Sylvia found both admirable and troubling. She had remarried, a man named Peter who was kind but distant, his presence a buffer against the encroaching past. They lived in a house filled with light, the walls adorned with cheerful paintings and the air filled with the sound of classical music. It was a life that seemed untouched by the weight of memory, a fresh start that Sylvia could not bring herself to embrace.\n\nOne evening, as she sat in her apartment, Sylvia received a call from her mother. There was a hesitation in her voice, a vulnerability that Sylvia had not heard in years. \u201cI found something,\u201d her mother said, her words measured and careful. \u201cIt\u2019s a letter, from your father. I think you should see it.\u201d\n\nSylvia felt a tightening in her chest, a familiar ache that had become a part of her. She agreed to meet her mother the next day, the anticipation gnawing at her like a persistent itch. When she arrived at her mother\u2019s house, the air was thick with unspoken words. They sat in the living room, the afternoon light casting a warm glow over the room.\n\nHer mother handed her the letter, the envelope worn and yellowed with age. Sylvia\u2019s hands trembled as she opened it, her eyes scanning the familiar handwriting. The letter was addressed to both Sylvia and her mother, a final message from a man who had always believed in the power of memory.\n\n\u201cMy dearest Sylvia and Margaret,\u201d it began. \u201cAs I write this, I am acutely aware of the passage of time, of the moments that slip through our fingers like sand. I want you both to know that my love for you is boundless, that it transcends the boundaries of life and death. Remembering is not a burden, but a gift. It is a way of keeping the flame of our existence alive, even in the darkest of times.\u201d\n\nSylvia\u2019s eyes filled with tears as she read the words, her father\u2019s voice echoing in her mind. She felt a profound sense of connection, a thread that linked her to a past that was both painful and beautiful. Her mother sat beside her, her eyes moist with unshed tears. For the first time in years, they shared a moment of unspoken understanding, a recognition of the weight they both carried.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Sylvia found herself drawn to her father\u2019s journals with renewed vigor. She saw them not just as a record of the past, but as a guide for the future. She began to write her own reflections, capturing the moments that defined her life, the memories that shaped her existence. It was an act of resistance, a way of asserting her presence in a world that seemed intent on erasure.\n\nHer mother, too, began to embrace the past in a way she had not before. They spent hours reminiscing, sharing stories that had long been buried under the weight of time. It was a process of healing, a way of bridging the gap between them. In those quiet moments, Sylvia felt the presence of her father, his spirit woven into the fabric of their lives.\n\nAs the years passed, Sylvia continued to honor the legacy of memory.

        "story_b": "In the quiet hours of dawn, when the world seemed to hold its breath, I found myself wandering through the deserted streets of my childhood. The air was thick with the scent of lilacs, a fragrance so deeply woven into the fabric of my past that it stirred memories long buried beneath the sediment of years. I walked slowly, each step echoing in the stillness, as if the very ground was whispering stories of those who had walked before me.\n\nMemory is resistance. Resistance is memory. I repeated this mantra silently, a shield against the encroaching tide of forgetfulness. The lilacs were in full bloom, their delicate petals glowing softly in the early light, much like the spirits of my ancestors who lingered in every corner of this place. They were here, unseen but ever-present, their presence a testament to the enduring power of memory.\n\nAs I walked, I recalled a significant memory, one that refused to fade. It was a warm summer evening, many years ago, when my grandmother gathered us around her in the garden, her voice a gentle melody weaving stories of our lineage. She spoke of resilience, of battles fought and won, of love enduring beyond the confines of time. Her words were not mere stories but living memories, anchors in the storm of forgetfulness, holding fast against the tide of oblivion.\n\n\"Remember,\" she had said, her eyes burning with a fierce light, \"remembering is resisting. To forget is to surrender.\"\n\nThe weight of her words settled over me like a cloak, both heavy and comforting. Even now, I felt their gravity, pulling me back to that night, to the glow of fireflies dancing in the twilight, to the warmth of her hand as it clasped mine. Memories, like stories, are graves. Yet, in their weight, we find our strength to resist.\n\nI wandered further, drawn by an invisible thread to the heart of the town, where the library stood\u2014a sanctuary of forgotten stories, echoing with the whispers of resistance. Its doors were weathered, the wood worn smooth by generations of hands. As I pushed them open, the scent of old books enveloped me, a heady mix of dust and ink, of time captured and preserved.\n\nInside, the silence was profound, a palpable presence that filled the space between the shelves. The library was an extension of my mind's landscape, a labyrinth of thoughts and reflections, each aisle a corridor into the past. I moved through it with reverence, fingers trailing over the spines of books that held the collective memory of my people.\n\nMemory is resistance. Resistance is memory.\n\nI found my way to a corner where a single window framed the sky, now a tapestry of colors as the sun began its ascent. I sat there, the light casting long shadows, and let the memories wash over me. I thought of my grandfather, a quiet man whose silence spoke volumes, his life a testament to endurance. He had been a part of the civil rights movement, marching in solidarity, his voice one among many that rose in defiance against injustice.\n\nHis stories were etched in my mind, as vivid as the day he first shared them. He spoke of hope, of the unyielding spirit of those who refused to be silenced, who remembered when others sought to forget. \"Memory is our weapon,\" he had said, his voice a rumble of thunder, \"a torch we pass to those who come after, to light their way through the darkness.\"\n\nI closed my eyes, feeling the weight of his words settle deep within me. Remembering was not a passive act; it was a rebellion, a refusal to let the past be forgotten. The memories of my ancestors, of their struggles and triumphs, were woven into the very fabric of my being, shaping the person I had become.\n\nThe fluidity of time and the permanence of memory converged here, in this quiet corner of the library. Memories were not linear; they existed in a timeless space, a realm where past and present danced together in a delicate balance. I could feel it now, the presence of those who had come before, their voices a chorus that resonated within me.\n\nIs memory not the heart's rebellion against time's erasure? I pondered this question, the answer elusive yet tantalizingly close. Memories were like glowing threads, weaving through the tapestry of time, each a beacon of defiance against the darkness that sought to consume them. They were the essence of resistance, a reminder that the past was not to be forgotten but cherished, honored, and learned from.\n\nI opened my eyes, the library now bathed in the soft glow of morning light. The weight of memory was heavy, but it was a weight I bore with pride. It was the legacy of those who had come before, a testament to their strength and resilience. In their stories, I found my own, a narrative that stretched beyond the confines of time, connecting me to something greater than myself.\n\nAs I rose to leave, I felt a sense of peace settle over me, a calm certainty that the act of remembering was indeed a form of resistance. It was a defiance against the erasure of time, a commitment to preserving the past for future generations. I carried this thought with me as I stepped back into the world, the sun now high in the sky, casting its warm light over the town.\n\nI walked with purpose, each step a reaffirmation of my resolve. The streets were coming to life, people moving with the rhythm of the day, unaware of the quiet rebellion that unfolded within me. But I knew, and that was enough.\n\nI returned to the lilac-scented air, the memories of my ancestors a comforting presence at my side. Their stories were graves, perhaps, but they were also gardens, fertile with the seeds of resistance, waiting to bloom anew with each retelling. In their weight, I found my strength, my purpose, my place in the continuum of time.\n\nAnd so I walked, carrying their legacy forward, a torchbearer in the ceaseless march of history. The past was not forgotten, nor would it ever be, as long as there were those who remembered, who resisted, who refused to let the stories fade into oblivion.\n\nMemory is resistance. Resistance is memory.\n\nIn this mantra, I found my truth, my rebellion, my hope. And in the quiet hours of dawn, as the world held its breath, I knew that I would carry it with me always, a beacon of light in the shadowy depths of forgetfulness.",

Why call upon some sort of supernatural observer to bear witness. Attempt to own that point of view. Imitating it to move closer to G.F. Move outside myself.\n\nI find each move unsatisfactory.

Pretending not to be here where I am, here with many millions of others upset over G.F., people who watch online, who march, throng avenues and streets, behind mikes, on TV, in front of TVs, assuming they may be rightfully, righteously blamed, perhaps, but also hoping to be spared, forgiven.

        "story_a": "Sylvia sat on the edge of her bed, the evening light casting long shadows through the curtains. The room was heavy with the scent of lavender, a remnant of her mother\u2019s daily ritual. She glanced at the photograph on her bedside table\u2014her parents on their wedding day, smiling with a brightness that seemed almost foreign now. She traced the silver frame with her fingers, feeling the cool metal beneath her touch. Remembering was not a passive act; it was an act of defiance.\n\nHer father\u2019s voice echoed in her mind: \u201cThe past is a teacher, not a tyrant.\u201d He had said this often, usually when Sylvia\u2019s mother urged him to let go of old grievances, to move forward. But her father, with his quiet resolve, held on to every detail. He kept journals, meticulously cataloged, filled with memories and reflections. It was his way of resisting a world that seemed eager to forget.\n\nSylvia\u2019s own memories of her father were fragmented, like pieces of a shattered mirror. He had died when she was thirteen, his heart giving out under the strain of too many unspoken words. She remembered the way he would sit at the kitchen table, his hands clasped around a cup of coffee, staring into the distance as if searching for something just out of reach. Those mornings were silent, the air thick with unvoiced thoughts.\n\nHer mother, in contrast, embraced the present with a fervor that left little room for the past. \u201cWe must live for today,\u201d she would say, her voice bright and insistent. Sylvia had always found this sentiment hollow, a denial of the weight that the past carried. It was as if her mother were running from something, a shadow that grew longer with each passing year.\n\nNow, at twenty-seven, Sylvia felt the pull of her father\u2019s legacy more acutely than ever. She had inherited his journals, each one a testament to the power of memory. She spent hours poring over them, the pages yellowed and brittle, the ink fading but still legible. They were filled with stories\u2014his childhood in a small coastal town, his first love, the birth of Sylvia herself. Each entry was a piece of a larger mosaic, a map of a life lived in defiance of forgetting.\n\nOne journal, in particular, held her attention. It was the last one he had written, the entries growing more sporadic as his health declined. There was a passage that Sylvia returned to often, a reflection on the nature of memory itself: \u201cTo remember is to resist the erasure of our existence. It is to hold on to the threads that bind us to each other, to the world.\u201d\n\nThese words resonated with Sylvia, a mantra that guided her through the labyrinth of her own memories. She thought of her father\u2019s voice, the way it would rise and fall like the tide, carrying with it the weight of history. She remembered his hands, calloused and strong, the way they would cradle her face when she was a child, anchoring her in a world that often felt adrift.\n\nSylvia\u2019s own memories were a patchwork quilt, stitched together with threads of joy and sorrow. She remembered the scent of pine from their family trips to the mountains, the sound of her father\u2019s laughter as they huddled around a campfire. She remembered the silence of the hospital room, the beeping of machines that marked the passing of time with a cold precision. These memories were her inheritance, a legacy that she carried with her like a sacred trust.\n\nHer mother, meanwhile, had moved on in a way that Sylvia found both admirable and troubling. She had remarried, a man named Peter who was kind but distant, his presence a buffer against the encroaching past. They lived in a house filled with light, the walls adorned with cheerful paintings and the air filled with the sound of classical music. It was a life that seemed untouched by the weight of memory, a fresh start that Sylvia could not bring herself to embrace.\n\nOne evening, as she sat in her apartment, Sylvia received a call from her mother. There was a hesitation in her voice, a vulnerability that Sylvia had not heard in years. \u201cI found something,\u201d her mother said, her words measured and careful. \u201cIt\u2019s a letter, from your father. I think you should see it.\u201d\n\nSylvia felt a tightening in her chest, a familiar ache that had become a part of her. She agreed to meet her mother the next day, the anticipation gnawing at her like a persistent itch. When she arrived at her mother\u2019s house, the air was thick with unspoken words. They sat in the living room, the afternoon light casting a warm glow over the room.\n\nHer mother handed her the letter, the envelope worn and yellowed with age. Sylvia\u2019s hands trembled as she opened it, her eyes scanning the familiar handwriting. The letter was addressed to both Sylvia and her mother, a final message from a man who had always believed in the power of memory.\n\n\u201cMy dearest Sylvia and Margaret,\u201d it began. \u201cAs I write this, I am acutely aware of the passage of time, of the moments that slip through our fingers like sand. I want you both to know that my love for you is boundless, that it transcends the boundaries of life and death. Remembering is not a burden, but a gift. It is a way of keeping the flame of our existence alive, even in the darkest of times.\u201d\n\nSylvia\u2019s eyes filled with tears as she read the words, her father\u2019s voice echoing in her mind. She felt a profound sense of connection, a thread that linked her to a past that was both painful and beautiful. Her mother sat beside her, her eyes moist with unshed tears. For the first time in years, they shared a moment of unspoken understanding, a recognition of the weight they both carried.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Sylvia found herself drawn to her father\u2019s journals with renewed vigor. She saw them not just as a record of the past, but as a guide for the future. She began to write her own reflections, capturing the moments that defined her life, the memories that shaped her existence. It was an act of resistance, a way of asserting her presence in a world that seemed intent on erasure.\n\nHer mother, too, began to embrace the past in a way she had not before. They spent hours reminiscing, sharing stories that had long been buried under the weight of time. It was a process of healing, a way of bridging the gap between them. In those quiet moments, Sylvia felt the presence of her father, his spirit woven into the fabric of their lives.\n\nAs the years passed, Sylvia continued to honor the legacy of memory. She became a historian, dedicated to preserving the stories of those who had come before. Her work was a testament to the power of remembering, a way of resisting the erasure of existence. And in her own life, she found solace in the act of remembering, a way of keeping the flame of her father\u2019s love alive.\n\nIn the end, Sylvia understood that remembering was not just an act of defiance, but an affirmation of life itself. It was a way of holding on to the threads that bound her to the world, a testament to the enduring power of memory. And in that act of resistance, she found her own strength, a quiet resolve that carried her through the darkest of times.",
        "story_b": "The street is a canvas, each crack a line of history, each shadow a remnant of what was. Time flows here, unruffled by stops and starts, a river of echoes where past and present merge into a singular rhythm. On this familiar path, my steps fall into a cadence, a meditation, and the memories rise like mist from the asphalt, refusing to be forgotten.\n\nIn the act of remembering, we resist. In resistance, we remain.\n\nThe street stretches ahead, a corridor of remembrance. I walk, the soles of my shoes brushing against the pavement with a steady, deliberate beat, and I am both here and elsewhere. The present moment dissolves into memory, and I am a child again, skipping along this same path, the sun warm on my skin, the world vast and full of promise. But the present pulls me back, a tether I cannot sever, and I am here, now, an adult carrying the weight of all the yesterdays that have shaped me.\n\nThe glow of the streetlamps is soft in the early evening, their light blending with the encroaching twilight. They stand as sentinels, witnesses to the passage of time, their glow a reminder of the constancy of change. I pass beneath them, and their light casts long shadows that stretch behind me, echoes of the past that cling and whisper, \"Remember, resist, remain.\"\n\nMemory is a form of resistance. To remember is to defy the erasure of identity, to stand firm against the tide of oblivion that seeks to wash away the traces of what once was. Memory is a battleground, and I am a soldier, armed with recollections that refuse to fade, stories that demand to be told.\n\nAs I walk, the memories unfurl, a tapestry of moments woven together, each thread a connection to the past. I remember my grandmother, her hands worn and wise, her voice a melody of tales and truths. She taught me that stories are lifelines, that to forget is to lose oneself, that in the act of telling, we reclaim the fragments of our existence. Her words echo in my mind, a mantra of resilience: \"We are the stories we tell, the stories we keep alive.\"\n\nThe street narrows as I approach the old park, a place of laughter and innocence, where time seemed endless and the future a distant horizon. The swings creak in the breeze, their chains rusted but sturdy, a reminder that even the strongest of things bear the marks of time. I pause, my gaze lingering on the playground where I once played, where dreams were born and nurtured, where the future was a canvas yet to be painted.\n\nThe past is a presence, a silhouette of thoughts, crowned by the glow of remembered moments. It follows me, a shadow that does not wane, a companion that will not be cast aside. I carry it with me, in me, a testament to the lives that have touched mine, the stories that have shaped me.\n\nIn the act of remembering, we resist. In resistance, we remain.\n\nThe air is cool, carrying with it the scent of earth and leaves and the distant promise of rain. I breathe deeply, the air filling my lungs, grounding me in the present even as I drift through the corridors of memory. The street is alive with the voices of those who have walked it before me, their whispers a chorus that sings of love and loss, of hope and despair, of the indomitable spirit of humanity.\n\nTo remember is to bear witness, to honor the lives that came before, to refuse the silence that seeks to swallow the past. It is an act of defiance, a declaration that we are here, that we have been here, that we will not be erased.\n\nI turn the corner, and the street opens into the square, a space alive with light and movement. The fountain at its center dances with water, its spray catching the light and casting rainbows into the air. Children play around it, their laughter a symphony of joy, and I am reminded that the future is a story yet to be written, a canvas waiting to be filled.\n\nThe square is a meeting place, a convergence of paths and lives, a space where stories intersect and collide. I watch as people move through it, each carrying their own burdens of memory, their own tales of resistance and resilience. They are a tapestry of humanity, each thread unique yet part of the same grand design.\n\nI am drawn to a bench beneath a great oak, its branches reaching skyward, a testament to endurance and growth. I sit, the wood cool beneath me, and I close my eyes, letting the sounds of the square wash over me. The chatter of voices, the rustle of leaves, the distant hum of the city\u2014all blend into a symphony of life, a reminder that the world is vast and interconnected, that we are all part of something greater.\n\nThe weight of memory settles around me, a familiar cloak that I wear with pride. It is a burden and a gift, a reminder of the love and loss that have shaped me, the moments that have defined me. It is a testament to the lives that have touched mine, the stories that I carry with me, the stories that I refuse to forget.\n\nIn the act of remembering, we resist. In resistance, we remain.\n\nI open my eyes, and the world comes into focus, sharp and vibrant. The square is alive with color and motion, a kaleidoscope of existence, and I am part of it, a single thread in the tapestry of life. I rise, my steps steady and sure, and I move through the square, my heart a drumbeat of memory and resistance.\n\nThe street awaits, a path unfolding into the future, a canvas of echoes where past and present merge. I walk, the soles of my shoes brushing against the pavement with a steady, deliberate beat, and I am both here and elsewhere.

Given another chance. Here in this place where I am, too. Whether or not I pretend I can inhabit some impossibly different space. A place elsewhere in which I am neither exactly dead nor alive, where I am suspended, invisible, yet able to observe myself and observe G.F. as neither living nor dead. Despite absolute darkness, to observe G.F. here, to observe myself here, despite or because we are not present here, but elsewhere, nowhere in fact, or wherever anybody chooses to imagine or not imagine she or he might be. Wherever I\u2019m pretending I am.\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\nFor example, pretending not to breathe. A cop knee pressing down on the neck. Choking, suffocating me. How long. How long. Hands cuffed behind back. Cop body sits on my body pressing it down in a city street. Many shoes, boots shuffling too close to eyes. Wonder if they will stomp my eyes. Wonder what street. What city. Wonder how long dead while wondering.\n\nHow long. How long. How to make it real. Not to bid a victim, loved or unloved, adieu. Not to say farewell. Not leave-taking, not goody, good, goodbye. But return to scene of crime. Recount each blow like a senator on the Senate floor who produces cinema verit\u00e9 for his colleagues\u2014pounding rostrum POW-POW-POW-POW-POW\u2014fifty-six times in eighty-one seconds\u2014like cop fists, cop feet striking Rodney King\u2019s body fifty-six hard, loud times\u2014for eighty-one seconds\u2014ignite cities. Like the four hundred blows\u2014les quatre cents coups, as the French saying goes\u2014dirty tricks delivered blow after blow in a black-and-white movie for viewers to silently regard\u2014four hundred uncountable blows beating a boy to his knees. Different strokes for different folks in different countries. Same pain always. Whose. Whose blows. In whose language did the recorder hear Truffaut saying: I demand that a film either express the joy of making cinema or the agony of making cinema. I am not interested in anything in between.\n\nAs I read, I learn more about goodbyes, farewells to the dead, about narrative art, about protests, protesters, protestations, learn that the singer Esther Phillips, n\u00e9e Jones, born colored on December 23, 1935, in Galveston, Texas\u2014two days later and you could call her an Xmas present\u2014learn she recorded \u201cNo Headstone on My Grave,\u201d a Charlie Rich song, in 1962, eleven years before G.F. was born, with all his live years ahead of him before he\u2019s on his stomach on hard concrete or asphalt of a Minneapolis street begging for more breath, more life than he\u2019s going to get. Wondering how he hears, of all things, a blues/church-voiced woman singing words he can\u2019t quite make out, words gone quick as they come, quick as they go, but slow, too, and sad words, no doubt, very gotdamn sad brushing past, he whiffs thick sad on them, sad in a voice sad as blues and church, sad, slow, quick as a very last breath nobody ever hears anyway neck squeezed in a vise or not. . . .

        "story_a": "Sylvia sat on the edge of her bed, the evening light casting long shadows through the curtains. The room was heavy with the scent of lavender, a remnant of her mother\u2019s daily ritual. She glanced at the photograph on her bedside table\u2014her parents on their wedding day, smiling with a brightness that seemed almost foreign now. She traced the silver frame with her fingers, feeling the cool metal beneath her touch. Remembering was not a passive act; it was an act of defiance.\n\nHer father\u2019s voice echoed in her mind: \u201cThe past is a teacher, not a tyrant.\u201d He had said this often, usually when Sylvia\u2019s mother urged him to let go of old grievances, to move forward. But her father, with his quiet resolve, held on to every detail. He kept journals, meticulously cataloged, filled with memories and reflections. It was his way of resisting a world that seemed eager to forget.\n\nSylvia\u2019s own memories of her father were fragmented, like pieces of a shattered mirror. He had died when she was thirteen, his heart giving out under the strain of too many unspoken words. She remembered the way he would sit at the kitchen table, his hands clasped around a cup of coffee, staring into the distance as if searching for something just out of reach. Those mornings were silent, the air thick with unvoiced thoughts.\n\nHer mother, in contrast, embraced the present with a fervor that left little room for the past. \u201cWe must live for today,\u201d she would say, her voice bright and insistent. Sylvia had always found this sentiment hollow, a denial of the weight that the past carried. It was as if her mother were running from something, a shadow that grew longer with each passing year.\n\nNow, at twenty-seven, Sylvia felt the pull of her father\u2019s legacy more acutely than ever. She had inherited his journals, each one a testament to the power of memory. She spent hours poring over them, the pages yellowed and brittle, the ink fading but still legible. They were filled with stories\u2014his childhood in a small coastal town, his first love, the birth of Sylvia herself. Each entry was a piece of a larger mosaic, a map of a life lived in defiance of forgetting.\n\nOne journal, in particular, held her attention. It was the last one he had written, the entries growing more sporadic as his health declined. There was a passage that Sylvia returned to often, a reflection on the nature of memory itself: \u201cTo remember is to resist the erasure of our existence. It is to hold on to the threads that bind us to each other, to the world.\u201d\n\nThese words resonated with Sylvia, a mantra that guided her through the labyrinth of her own memories. She thought of her father\u2019s voice, the way it would rise and fall like the tide, carrying with it the weight of history. She remembered his hands, calloused and strong, the way they would cradle her face when she was a child, anchoring her in a world that often felt adrift.\n\nSylvia\u2019s own memories were a patchwork quilt, stitched together with threads of joy and sorrow. She remembered the scent of pine from their family trips to the mountains, the sound of her father\u2019s laughter as they huddled around a campfire. She remembered the silence of the hospital room, the beeping of machines that marked the passing of time with a cold precision. These memories were her inheritance, a legacy that she carried with her like a sacred trust.\n\nHer mother, meanwhile, had moved on in a way that Sylvia found both admirable and troubling. She had remarried, a man named Peter who was kind but distant, his presence a buffer against the encroaching past. They lived in a house filled with light, the walls adorned with cheerful paintings and the air filled with the sound of classical music. It was a life that seemed untouched by the weight of memory, a fresh start that Sylvia could not bring herself to embrace.\n\nOne evening, as she sat in her apartment, Sylvia received a call from her mother. There was a hesitation in her voice, a vulnerability that Sylvia had not heard in years. \u201cI found something,\u201d her mother said, her words measured and careful. \u201cIt\u2019s a letter, from your father. I think you should see it.\u201d\n\nSylvia felt a tightening in her chest, a familiar ache that had become a part of her. She agreed to meet her mother the next day, the anticipation gnawing at her like a persistent itch. When she arrived at her mother\u2019s house, the air was thick with unspoken words. They sat in the living room, the afternoon light casting a warm glow over the room.\n\nHer mother handed her the letter, the envelope worn and yellowed with age. Sylvia\u2019s hands trembled as she opened it, her eyes scanning the familiar handwriting. The letter was addressed to both Sylvia and her mother, a final message from a man who had always believed in the power of memory.\n\n\u201cMy dearest Sylvia and Margaret,\u201d it began. \u201cAs I write this, I am acutely aware of the passage of time, of the moments that slip through our fingers like sand. I want you both to know that my love for you is boundless, that it transcends the boundaries of life and death. Remembering is not a burden, but a gift. It is a way of keeping the flame of our existence alive, even in the darkest of times.\u201d\n\nSylvia\u2019s eyes filled with tears as she read the words, her father\u2019s voice echoing in her mind. She felt a profound sense of connection, a thread that linked her to a past that was both painful and beautiful. Her mother sat beside her, her eyes moist with unshed tears. For the first time in years, they shared a moment of unspoken understanding, a recognition of the weight they both carried.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Sylvia found herself drawn to her father\u2019s journals with renewed vigor. She saw them not just as a record of the past, but as a guide for the future. She began to write her own reflections, capturing the moments that defined her life, the memories that shaped her existence. It was an act of resistance, a way of asserting her presence in a world that seemed intent on erasure.\n\nHer mother, too, began to embrace the past in a way she had not before. They spent hours reminiscing, sharing stories that had long been buried under the weight of time. It was a process of healing, a way of bridging the gap between them. In those quiet moments, Sylvia felt the presence of her father, his spirit woven into the fabric of their lives.\n\nAs the years passed, Sylvia continued to honor the legacy of memory. She became a historian, dedicated to preserving the stories of those who had come before. Her work was a testament to the power of remembering, a way of resisting the erasure of existence. And in her own life, she found solace in the act of remembering, a way of keeping the flame of her father\u2019s love alive.\n\nIn the end, Sylvia understood that remembering was not just an act of defiance, but an affirmation of life itself. It was a way of holding on to the threads that bound her to the world, a testament to the enduring power of memory. And in that act of resistance, she found her own strength, a quiet resolve that carried her through the darkest of times.",
        "story_b": "The town of Elmwood was a place where stories lingered like the mist that rolled off the river at dawn, curling through the streets and slipping into the crevices of the old stone buildings. It was a town that refused to forget. Along Main Street, a mural stretched across the side of the library, a living tapestry of the town\u2019s tumultuous history. The mural was a gathering of faces, all watching, all remembering. It had been painted by generations, each adding their own brushstroke, a collective act of resistance against the fading of memory.\n\nAt the heart of Elmwood stood the Great Elm, its branches spreading wide like a grand storyteller weaving tales through the wind. Its roots delved deep, intertwining with the stories of those who gathered beneath it. Every year, on the first of May, the townspeople assembled around the Great Elm to recount the tale of the River Rebellion\u2014a series of events that authorities had long tried to erase from the annals of history.\n\nThe Rebellion had begun with whispers, a murmuring among the townsfolk that grew louder until it was a chorus of defiance. The river, once a source of life and prosperity, had been claimed by an outside corporation, its waters diverted for profit, leaving the town parched. But the people of Elmwood would not let their river be taken, nor their history washed away. They rose up, and though the struggle was hard-fought, they won back their river. The authorities tried to silence the story, but Elmwood remembered.\n\nMara, a woman whose lineage stretched back to the first settlers of Elmwood, was the keeper of the town's memories. She carried a locket around her neck, a small silver thing with a photograph of her great-grandmother, who had stood at the forefront of the Rebellion. Mara wore it as a talisman, a symbol of resistance and a reminder of where she came from. The scent of jasmine always lingered around her, a whisper of summers long past when her great-grandmother had tended to the garden by the river, the air thick with the sweet fragrance.\n\nMara's memories were not just her own; they were the town's, woven into her being. She often stood before the mural, tracing the faces with her fingertips, letting the rhythm of the past flow through her. The words of her great-grandmother echoed in her mind, \u201cWe remember, we resist, we endure.\u201d They were the heartbeat of the town, pulsing through every story told beneath the Great Elm.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the sky turned a deep indigo, Mara found herself wandering to the riverbank. The water shimmered under the moonlight, a silver thread stitching together past and present. She closed her eyes and let her thoughts drift, allowing memories to surface, like leaves floating to the surface of a pond.\n\nA flash of a childhood memory: her great-grandmother's voice, rich and warm, recounting the night the townspeople had gathered torches and marched to the river, a line of fire snaking through the darkness. They had stood shoulder to shoulder, their voices rising in song, a hymn of resistance that carried across the water, a promise that the river would flow free once more.\n\nAs Mara stood there, the past unfurled before her, not as a distant memory but as something vivid and alive. She imagined the faces of those who had fought, their determination etched into the landscape. She felt their resolve seep into her bones, a legacy of strength and defiance.\n\nHer reverie was broken by the sound of footsteps behind her. She turned to see a young boy, Simon, his eyes wide with curiosity. He was one of the newer members of the community, his family having moved to Elmwood just a year ago. Yet he had taken to the town's stories with a fervor that belied his age.\n\n\u201cMiss Mara,\u201d he said, his voice bright with the eagerness of youth, \u201cwill you tell me about the Rebellion again?\u201d\n\nMara smiled, gesturing for him to sit beside her on the bank. The memory of the Rebellion was a living thing, passed from one generation to the next, a thread connecting them all. As she spoke, the words flowed like the river, carrying with them the weight of the past, the promise of the future.\n\n\u201cThe river was ours,\u201d she began, the rhythm of her voice like a lullaby, \u201cand it was taken from us. But we didn\u2019t let it go.\u201d\n\nSimon listened, his eyes reflecting the moonlight, absorbing the history that was now part of his own. Mara's words painted images in the air, of nights filled with resolve, of the townspeople\u2019s unwavering spirit.\n\n\u201cWhy do they want us to forget?\u201d Simon asked, his brows furrowing in confusion.\n\n\u201cBecause remembering gives us power,\u201d Mara replied, her voice steady. \u201cWhen we remember, we resist. We hold onto what is ours. We endure.\u201d\n\nThe boy nodded, understanding settling over him like a mantle. He turned his gaze to the river, the water whispering its own stories, the tales of those who had come before and those yet to come.\n\nAs they sat in silence, the Great Elm loomed in the distance, its branches arching over the town like a guardian. It had witnessed generations, its roots entwined with the memories of Elmwood. Each ring of its trunk told a story, a testament to the resilience of the people who gathered beneath it.\n\nIn the days that followed, the town buzzed with preparations for the annual gathering. The mural was touched up, new faces added, their stories woven into the fabric of Elmwood\u2019s history. The scent of jasmine filled the air as Mara tended to the garden by the river, her great-grandmother\u2019s legacy living on in every bloom.\n\nOn the day of the gathering, the townspeople assembled beneath the Great Elm. The sun cast dappled shadows through its leaves, and the air hummed with anticipation. Mara stood at the forefront, the locket around her neck glinting in the light. She looked out at the faces before her, young and old, each carrying the weight of memory in their hearts.\n\nTogether, they began to speak, voices rising in a chorus of remembrance. They told of the River Rebellion, of the nights spent by the water, of the songs that had carried them through the darkness. They recounted the courage of those who had come before, whose stories were etched into the very soil of Elmwood.\n\nAs the sun set, the gathering drew to a close, but the memories lingered, woven into the fabric of the town, a tapestry of resistance and resilience. The Great Elm stood watch, its branches swaying gently in the breeze, a silent witness to the enduring power of memory.\n\nIn Elmwood, the past was never forgotten. It lived on in the stories told beneath the Great Elm, in the mural that stretched across the library, in the hearts of those who refused to let go. In remembering, they found strength. In resistance, they found unity. And in enduring, they found hope.",

        "ground_truth": "#Ghosts _It makes no difference what men think of war. War endures. As well ask men what they think of stone. War was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner. That is the way it was and will be. That way and not some other way._ Cormac McCarthy, Blood Meridian --- [Music: Deportation/Iguazu]( [Music: Alma]( --- The church stood mutely; shrouded yet in the long shadows of morning for the sun had not yet risen so high as to warm Sentinel just yet. But its light shone brilliant against the steep cliffs of the great Mesa beyond. Orange the color of burning phosphor descended slow and silent from the heights. It painted the rock and then the desert below that. Lit the world; made it glow. Lizards stalked among the rocks. Droning whir of windmill. No horse sounds. No hammer beats from the ferrier or blacksmith at his forges. No cluck of morning hens, no bray of donkeys or trundle of wagonwheels. A languid wind that withered as the sun came up. The town was empty. Abandoned. Sentinel was as improbable a place to settle as any in the southern New Mexico Territories in the 1850's. It was a desert town, with no railroad service and sat less than a days ride north of the border with Mexico. Once this had all been Apache land. It was taken by the Comanche who pushed them into northern Mexico and Texas and Arizona. Later Spaniards came and when they could not push out or defeat the natives, they sought to convert them. In consult with the Apache chiefs, the Spaniards were directed to build a Mission at the feet of a great Mesa and were guided by scouts to a site of spiritual importance. The Great Mesa. The monolith. The Sentinel. They built. But the priests didn't realize they had run afoul an Apache trick. These were Comanche lands the chiefs had instructed them to build on, and the Comanche sent a war party and they came in the night and slaughtered the priests and burned the mission. And the Comanche were emboldened by their victory and so began a campaign of incursions and depredations. For decades they raided up and down along the San Amarillas River, into northern Mexico and all along the borderlands. But from the night they scalped and bled those men of God, the Comanche had sealed their fate in the west, for they had brought the Spaniards into war with them, just as the Apache had planned and though the Comanche would expel them, they would not weather the years of strife that followed the arrival of European settlers as well. The Apache were able to return to their tribal lands and build settlements in the area again but it was not long before the Apache were once again forced from their lands, this time by the white man. The settlers built a church with a steeple over the old burned Spanish mission. New priests came. The graves of the Spaniards were buried over and their stone markers removed. That church with its bell tower stands in the Township of Sentinel still today. And it was the clang of its church bells, three rings of diminishing reverberation that woke the strangers in Sentinel that morning. That strange echo in the ears, that shudder of the ground. Above, raptors wheeled across the perfect blue of the sky and turned wide, lazy circles. Buzzards on the distant hills, a thin tendril of smoke visible behind the mesas spire. In the dusty town its streets lay bare and it's windows and doorways were haunted by expectant shadows. --- _Scene notes:_ _I've set the opening scene up so as to be a bit vague, where you each get to decide where in Sentinel your character awakens by selecting and playing a card against one of the Starting Location challenges.

        "story_a": "The first thing you notice upon awakening is the smell of dust\u2014ancient and pervasive, it clings to the dry air like a ghostly residue. You blink, your eyes adjusting to the dim light filtering through the cracked, stained-glass windows of what appears to be an old saloon. The bar, once polished to a warm sheen, now stands weathered and forgotten, its surface marred by time. Tables and chairs lie scattered in disarray, as if abandoned in haste, and a thick layer of dust covers every inch of the room.\n\nA sharp, metallic ringing pierces the silence, drawing your attention. The church bells. They toll with a haunting regularity, their echoes reverberating through the empty streets of Sentinel. The sound stirs something within you\u2014an elusive memory, half-formed and fleeting.\n\nYou sit up, wincing as a dull ache spreads through your limbs. Your clothes are worn but sturdy, a testament to long travels. A quick inventory of your possessions reveals a small leather satchel, a tarnished pocket watch, and a folded piece of parchment. You unfold the parchment with trembling fingers, revealing a rough map of the town. Sentinel. The name is scrawled in faded ink, accompanied by a series of cryptic symbols and notations.\n\nWhat brought you here? The question gnaws at the edges of your mind, but the answer remains just out of reach. You rise unsteadily to your feet, the floorboards creaking beneath your weight. The saloon door, hanging ajar on rusty hinges, beckons you into the unknown.\n\nOutside, the town of Sentinel lies shrouded in an eerie stillness. The buildings, once vibrant with life, now stand as hollow shells, their windows dark and empty. The main street stretches out before you, a desolate path flanked by crumbling facades. The mesa looms in the distance, its shadow casting a long, foreboding line across the town.\n\nYou hesitate, the oppressive silence pressing in from all sides. The church bells toll again, their mournful song urging you onward. With no other clear direction, you follow the sound, your footsteps echoing in the emptiness.\n\nAs you approach the church, you notice a figure standing in the doorway, cloaked in shadow. The figure watches you with an intensity that sends a shiver down your spine. You take a cautious step forward, and the figure steps out into the light\u2014a woman, her face etched with lines of worry and fatigue. Her eyes, however, are sharp and piercing, a stark contrast to the desolation around her.\n\n\"You're awake,\" she says, her voice tinged with relief and suspicion. \"I wasn't sure you would make it.\"\n\nYou frown, searching your fragmented memories for any recognition. \"Do I know you?\"\n\nShe shakes her head. \"Not yet. But we share a purpose, I think.\" She gestures for you to follow her inside the church. \"Come. There is much to discuss, and time is not on our side.\"\n\nInside the church, the air is cooler, the shadows deeper. The pews are empty, save for a few scattered personal items\u2014forgotten remnants of a congregation that once sought solace here. The woman leads you to the front, where a large, intricately carved altar stands. Behind it, a mural depicts a scene of both beauty and terror: a great mesa, with figures climbing its steep sides, reaching for the heavens while dark shapes lurk below.\n\nThe woman turns to face you, her expression grave. \"This town holds many secrets, but the most dangerous of all lies atop that mesa.\" She points to the mural. \"Something ancient and powerful slumbers there. It is our task to ensure it remains undisturbed.\"\n\nYou feel a chill run down your spine. \"Why me? Why am I here?\"\n\nShe studies you for a moment before answering. \"You were chosen, like many before you. Sentinel calls to those with a certain... connection to the past. Your arrival here is no accident.\"\n\nThe weight of her words settles heavily on your shoulders. The fragments of memory stir once more, elusive and tantalizingly close. \"What happens if we fail?\"\n\nThe woman\u2019s eyes darken. \"Then the town will be lost forever, and the darkness will spread beyond the mesa, consuming everything in its path.\"\n\nA sense of urgency grips you. Despite the gaps in your memory, you feel a deep-seated resolve. \"What do we need to do?\"\n\nShe smiles, a flicker of hope in her eyes. \"First, we must find the others. There are more like you\u2014scattered throughout the town, awakening to the same call. Together, we have a chance.\"\n\nWith that, she turns and leads you back outside, the church bells tolling once more. The sun hangs low in the sky, casting long shadows across the deserted streets. You glance at the map in your hand, the cryptic symbols taking on new meaning.\n\nAs you walk through the ghostly town, you can't shake the feeling that Sentinel is watching you, waiting. Each step brings a new discovery\u2014a locked door, a hidden passage, a whispered name carried on the wind. The town's secrets are many, and you sense that uncovering them will not be easy.\n\nYour path leads you to an old general store, its windows boarded up and its sign hanging precariously from a single nail. Inside, the air is thick with the smell of decay. Shelves stand empty, their contents long since pilfered or rotted away. You hear a faint rustling from the back room, and your heart quickens.\n\nPushing open the door, you find a young man crouched over a pile of dusty books, his face pale and drawn. He looks up, startled, as you enter.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he demands, his voice trembling with fear.\n\nYou hold up your hands in a gesture of peace. \"I'm here to help. We need to find the others.\"\n\nHe hesitates, then nods slowly. \"I thought I was alone. But if there are more of us...\"\n\nTogether, you leave the store and continue your search, your numbers growing as you find others\u2014each with their own story, their own fragments of memory. A sense of camaraderie forms, binding you together in your shared purpose.\n\nAs the sun sets, you gather in the town square, the shadow of the mesa looming ever larger. The woman from the church stands before you, her eyes shining with determination.\n\n\"We have much to do,\" she says, her voice strong. \"But together, we can protect Sentinel and uncover the truth of what brought us here.\"\n\nThe church bells toll once more, their echoes a haunting reminder of the task ahead. As you look around at the faces of your newfound companions, you feel a renewed sense of hope. The secrets of Sentinel are many, but you are no longer alone in facing them.\n\nAnd so, with the night closing in and the shadow of the mesa stretching ever wider, you take the first step on a journey that will test your courage, your resolve, and the very fabric of your soul. The town of Sentinel holds its breath, waiting to see if you will uncover its secrets or be consumed by them.",
        "story_b": "Sentinel lay still beneath the mesa, a ghostly tableau of forgotten dreams and whispered echoes. The sun, barely breaching the horizon, cast long shadows that stretched like spectral fingers across the cracked facades and dust-choked streets. The air was laden with the scent of dry earth and the faint tang of rust from the derelict vehicles abandoned in eternal vigil. A chill wind stirred, carrying with it the distant toll of church bells, their sound both mournful and eerily inviting, resonating through the emptiness with an unexplainable clarity.\n\nI awoke, disoriented, in what appeared to be an old saloon. The faded wallpaper peeled away from the wooden walls like layers of secrets long hidden. Dust motes danced in the shafts of pale light that filtered through the grimy windows, settling upon the bar where my few possessions lay scattered\u2014a worn leather satchel, a tarnished pocket watch, and a faded photograph of a face I couldn\u2019t quite recall.\n\nMy mind was a muddled landscape of fragmented memories, like pieces of a shattered mirror reflecting bits of a life I couldn\u2019t fully grasp. There was a sense of urgency, a feeling that something important lay just beyond the reach of conscious thought. But what was it? Why was I here in Sentinel, a place as empty and desolate as my own recollections?\n\nThe church bells tolled again, each chime a question echoing in the hollow cavity of my chest. I gathered my belongings, slipping the pocket watch into the pocket of my threadbare coat. The photograph I tucked carefully into the satchel, feeling a strange pull toward the eyes that gazed out from it, eyes that seemed to hold the key to whatever mystery enveloped me.\n\nStepping out into the street, I was struck by the town\u2019s eerie silence, a silence so profound it seemed alive, as though the very air held its breath in anticipation. Buildings leaned wearily against one another, their windows darkened like the eyes of the dead. The shadows of the mesa loomed over everything, shifting subtly as the sun climbed higher, their movement almost imperceptible yet undeniably real.\n\nAs I walked, my footsteps stirred the dust, leaving transient prints that the wind would soon erase. The church bells seemed to grow louder, their peals a constant, haunting companion. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that they were leading me, guiding me toward some revelation hidden within Sentinel\u2019s abandoned heart.\n\nPassing by what had once been a general store, its shelves barren and its sign swinging on rusted chains, I caught sight of a message scrawled in faded chalk on the board outside: \"The truth lies within.\" It was cryptic, yet I felt an inexplicable certainty that it was meant for me. But what truth? And why did it feel both ominous and strangely comforting?\n\nMy feet carried me inexorably toward the source of the bells, the old church standing sentinel at the edge of town. Its steeple reached skyward, a silhouette against the brightening sky. The doors, heavy and weathered, stood slightly ajar, as if inviting me to enter.\n\nInside, the air was cooler, the shadows deeper. The pews were empty, dust settled like a shroud upon them. At the front, a single candle flickered, its flame unwavering despite the drafts that whispered through the sanctuary. I moved toward it, drawn by an invisible thread that tugged at the corners of my mind.\n\nAs I approached the altar, my gaze fell upon a journal, its cover cracked and worn. Hesitantly, I picked it up, feeling the weight of untold stories within its pages. Opening it, I found entries written in a hand that seemed both familiar and foreign, the ink faded yet legible.\n\n_\"June 12th: They said Sentinel would prosper, a beacon beneath the mesa. But now, only shadows remain, and secrets buried deep.\"_\n\nThe words resonated, stirring echoes of recognition within me. I turned the pages, piecing together a narrative of hope turned to despair, of promises made and broken. Each entry felt like a step closer to understanding, yet the full picture remained elusive, tantalizingly out of reach.\n\n_\"August 5th: The bells ring, but no one comes. We are but ghosts now, lingering in the place we once called home.\"_\n\nThe bells tolled once more, their sound a constant reminder of the passage of time, of lives lived and lost. I closed the journal, my heart heavy with the weight of its revelations. Sentinel was more than a ghost town; it was a monument to forgotten dreams and unfulfilled destinies, its secrets entwined with my own fragmented past.\n\nAs I stood there, the shadows seemed to shift again, the light playing tricks upon the walls. I felt a presence, not malevolent but watchful, as if the town itself was aware, waiting for me to uncover what lay hidden in its silent streets.\n\nI left the church, stepping back into the light, the journal clutched in my hand like a lifeline. The bells had fallen silent, their echo lingering in the air. I knew there were answers to be found here, but also more questions, a labyrinth of mystery that I was only beginning to navigate.\n\nThe road stretched out before me, leading deeper into Sentinel\u2019s heart. With each step, the fragments of memory seemed to shift, rearranging themselves into a pattern I couldn\u2019t yet discern. But I would find the truth, piece by piece, in this town where past and present intertwined, where the shadows of the mesa whispered of secrets long buried.\n\nI walked on, into the unknown, driven by a purpose I couldn\u2019t yet name, in search of the life I had forgotten and the answers that awaited beneath Sentinel\u2019s watchful gaze.",

But its light shone brilliant against the steep cliffs of the great Mesa beyond. Orange the color of burning phosphor descended slow and silent from the heights. It painted the rock and then the desert below that. Lit the world; made it glow. Lizards stalked among the rocks. Droning whir of windmill. No horse sounds. No hammer beats from the ferrier or blacksmith at his forges. No cluck of morning hens, no bray of donkeys or trundle of wagonwheels. A languid wind that withered as the sun came up. The town was empty. Abandoned. Sentinel was as improbable a place to settle as any in the southern New Mexico Territories in the 1850's. It was a desert town, with no railroad service and sat less than a days ride north of the border with Mexico. Once this had all been Apache land. It was taken by the Comanche who pushed them into northern Mexico and Texas and Arizona. Later Spaniards came and when they could not push out or defeat the natives, they sought to convert them. In consult with the Apache chiefs, the Spaniards were directed to build a Mission at the feet of a great Mesa and were guided by scouts to a site of spiritual importance. The Great Mesa. The monolith. The Sentinel. They built. But the priests didn't realize they had run afoul an Apache trick. These were Comanche lands the chiefs had instructed them to build on, and the Comanche sent a war party and they came in the night and slaughtered the priests and burned the mission. And the Comanche were emboldened by their victory and so began a campaign of incursions and depredations. For decades they raided up and down along the San Amarillas River, into northern Mexico and all along the borderlands. But from the night they scalped and bled those men of God, the Comanche had sealed their fate in the west, for they had brought the Spaniards into war with them, just as the Apache had planned and though the Comanche would expel them, they would not weather the years of strife that followed the arrival of European settlers as well. The Apache were able to return to their tribal lands and build settlements in the area again but it was not long before the Apache were once again forced from their lands, this time by the white man. The settlers built a church with a steeple over the old burned Spanish mission. New priests came. The graves of the Spaniards were buried over and their stone markers removed. That church with its bell tower stands in the Township of Sentinel still today. And it was the clang of its church bells, three rings of diminishing reverberation that woke the strangers in Sentinel that morning. That strange echo in the ears, that shudder of the ground. Above, raptors wheeled across the perfect blue of the sky and turned wide, lazy circles. Buzzards on the distant hills, a thin tendril of smoke visible behind the mesas spire.

You blink, your eyes adjusting to the dim light filtering through the cracked, stained-glass windows of what appears to be an old saloon. The bar, once polished to a warm sheen, now stands weathered and forgotten, its surface marred by time. Tables and chairs lie scattered in disarray, as if abandoned in haste, and a thick layer of dust covers every inch of the room.\n\nA sharp, metallic ringing pierces the silence, drawing your attention. The church bells. They toll with a haunting regularity, their echoes reverberating through the empty streets of Sentinel. The sound stirs something within you\u2014an elusive memory, half-formed and fleeting.\n\nYou sit up, wincing as a dull ache spreads through your limbs. Your clothes are worn but sturdy, a testament to long travels. A quick inventory of your possessions reveals a small leather satchel, a tarnished pocket watch, and a folded piece of parchment. You unfold the parchment with trembling fingers, revealing a rough map of the town. Sentinel. The name is scrawled in faded ink, accompanied by a series of cryptic symbols and notations.\n\nWhat brought you here? The question gnaws at the edges of your mind, but the answer remains just out of reach. You rise unsteadily to your feet, the floorboards creaking beneath your weight. The saloon door, hanging ajar on rusty hinges, beckons you into the unknown.\n\nOutside, the town of Sentinel lies shrouded in an eerie stillness. The buildings, once vibrant with life, now stand as hollow shells, their windows dark and empty. The main street stretches out before you, a desolate path flanked by crumbling facades. The mesa looms in the distance, its shadow casting a long, foreboding line across the town.\n\nYou hesitate, the oppressive silence pressing in from all sides. The church bells toll again, their mournful song urging you onward. With no other clear direction, you follow the sound, your footsteps echoing in the emptiness.\n\nAs you approach the church, you notice a figure standing in the doorway, cloaked in shadow. The figure watches you with an intensity that sends a shiver down your spine. You take a cautious step forward, and the figure steps out into the light\u2014a woman, her face etched with lines of worry and fatigue. Her eyes, however, are sharp and piercing, a stark contrast to the desolation around her.\n\n\"You're awake,\" she says, her voice tinged with relief and suspicion. \"I wasn't sure you would make it.\"\n\nYou frown, searching your fragmented memories for any recognition. \"Do I know you?\"\n\nShe shakes her head. \"Not yet. But we share a purpose, I think.\" She gestures for you to follow her inside the church. \"Come. There is much to discuss, and time is not on our side.\"\n\nInside the church, the air is cooler, the shadows deeper. The pews are empty, save for a few scattered personal items\u2014forgotten remnants of a congregation that once sought solace here. The woman leads you to the front, where a large, intricately carved altar stands. Behind it, a mural depicts a scene of both beauty and terror: a great mesa, with figures climbing its steep sides, reaching for the heavens while dark shapes lurk below.\n\nThe woman turns to face you, her expression grave. \"This town holds many secrets, but the most dangerous of all lies atop that mesa.\" She points to the mural. \"Something ancient and powerful slumbers there. It is our task to ensure it remains undisturbed.\"\n\nYou feel a chill run down your spine. \"Why me? Why am I here?\"\n\nShe studies you for a moment before answering. \"You were chosen, like many before you. Sentinel calls to those with a certain... connection to the past. Your arrival here is no accident.\"\n\nThe weight of her words settles heavily on your shoulders. The fragments of memory stir once more, elusive and tantalizingly close. \"What happens if we fail?\"\n\nThe woman\u2019s eyes darken. \"Then the town will be lost forever, and the darkness will spread beyond the mesa, consuming everything in its path.\"\n\nA sense of urgency grips you. Despite the gaps in your memory, you feel a deep-seated resolve. \"What do we need to do?\"\n\nShe smiles, a flicker of hope in her eyes. \"First, we must find the others. There are more like you\u2014scattered throughout the town, awakening to the same call. Together, we have a chance.\"\n\nWith that, she turns and leads you back outside, the church bells tolling once more. The sun hangs low in the sky, casting long shadows across the deserted streets. You glance at the map in your hand, the cryptic symbols taking on new meaning.\n\nAs you walk through the ghostly town, you can't shake the feeling that Sentinel is watching you, waiting. Each step brings a new discovery\u2014a locked door, a hidden passage, a whispered name carried on the wind. The town's secrets are many, and you sense that uncovering them will not be easy.\n\nYour path leads you to an old general store, its windows boarded up and its sign hanging precariously from a single nail. Inside, the air is thick with the smell of decay. Shelves stand empty, their contents long since pilfered or rotted away. You hear a faint rustling from the back room, and your heart quickens.\n\nPushing open the door, you find a young man crouched over a pile of dusty books, his face pale and drawn. He looks up, startled, as you enter.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he demands, his voice trembling with fear.\n\nYou hold up your hands in a gesture of peace. \"I'm here to help. We need to find the others.\"\n\nHe hesitates, then nods slowly. \"I thought I was alone. But if there are more of us...\"\n\nTogether, you leave the store and continue your search, your numbers growing as you find others\u2014each with their own story, their own fragments of memory. A sense of camaraderie forms, binding you together in your shared purpose.\n\nAs the sun sets, you gather in the town square, the shadow of the mesa looming ever larger. The woman from the church stands before you, her eyes shining with determination.\n\n\"We have much to do,\" she says, her voice strong. \"But together, we can protect Sentinel and uncover the truth of what brought us here.\"\n\nThe church bells toll once more, their echoes a haunting reminder of the task ahead. As you look around at the faces of your newfound companions, you feel a renewed sense of hope. The secrets of Sentinel are many, but you are no longer alone in facing them.\n\nAnd so, with the night closing in and the shadow of the mesa stretching ever wider, you take the first step on a journey that will test your courage, your resolve, and the very fabric of your soul. The town of Sentinel holds its breath, waiting to see if you will uncover its secrets or be consumed by them.",
        "story_b": "The cold stone floor was the first sensation that pierced the fog of my consciousness, a chill leeching into my bones and drawing me awake. I lay still, the musty scent of neglect hanging heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of sagebrush that drifted through broken windows. As I opened my eyes, the dim light revealed a ceiling marred by cracks and water stains, a testament to years of abandonment. Sentinel, the name reverberated in my mind like a distant echo. I had heard of this place\u2014a ghost town shrouded in mystery and whispered legends.\n\nI pushed myself upright, my movements slow and deliberate as I took stock of my surroundings. Dust motes floated lazily in the shafts of light that filtered through the boarded-up windows, their dance a silent testament to the passage of time. The room was sparse, furnished only with a rickety chair and a table sagging under the weight of old newspapers and forgotten memories. A worn leather satchel lay at my side, its presence both reassuring and perplexing.\n\nRummaging through the bag, I found a few items: a tarnished silver locket, a faded photograph of a woman whose face was a blur of familiarity, and an old map with the edges frayed and yellowed with age. The map bore the name Sentinel, its streets and alleys sketched with meticulous detail. But it was the locket that stirred something deep within me\u2014a whisper of a memory, a fleeting image of a time and place I could not fully grasp.\n\nThe church bells tolled, their somber notes resonating through the silence, each peal sending a shiver down my spine. I rose to my feet, the weight of my uncertainty pressing down with every step. Each footfall was a question, each breath a search for answers. The emptiness of the town mirrored the void within me, a reflection of my fractured memories and the enigma of my presence here.\n\nThe streets of Sentinel lay before me, dusty and desolate, lined with crumbling facades that spoke of a forgotten past. The mesa loomed above, casting its shadow over the town, a silent guardian watching over its secrets. As I walked, the history of the place seemed to whisper from every crevice, the stories of its rise and fall etched into the very fabric of its being.\n\nI wandered past the old saloon, its windows shattered, the bar inside lined with dust-covered bottles and faded photographs that hinted at lives once vibrant and full. The wooden boards creaked under my weight, a sound that echoed through the hollow shell of the building. Each step felt like a gamble, a wager against the unknown, and yet something compelled me forward.\n\nThere was a pull towards the church, its weathered steeple piercing the sky, the bells now silent but their resonance lingering in the air. The door hung slightly ajar, inviting yet foreboding. I hesitated on the threshold, a wave of apprehension washing over me. But curiosity, the desperate need to piece together the puzzle of my existence, urged me onward.\n\nInside, the church was as I imagined: pews lined with dust, sunlight streaming through stained glass, casting fragmented rainbows onto the floor. The altar was bare, save for a lone candle whose wax had long since dried. It was here, in this place of quiet reverence, that I found the diary. Its leather cover was cracked with age, the pages yellowed and brittle. But the words within were clear, a chronicle of the town\u2019s life and, perhaps, its demise.\n\nThe diary belonged to a man named Samuel, a preacher who had come to Sentinel seeking solace and redemption. His words painted a picture of a town that had thrived once, only to crumble under the weight of its own secrets. There were tales of betrayal, of promises broken and truths buried beneath the mesa\u2019s shadow. But it was the final entry that caught my breath\u2014a mention of a stranger, a wanderer who had come seeking answers and left behind only questions.\n\nThe realization struck me like a thunderclap. Was I the stranger of Samuel\u2019s tale? Had I come to Sentinel searching for something lost, only to find myself ensnared by its mysteries? The diary offered no answers, only more questions, its pages now as silent as the town itself.\n\nAs I stepped out into the fading light, the sun dipping below the horizon, casting long shadows across the streets, I felt the weight of the locket around my neck. I opened it, the click of the clasp a finality that echoed in the silence. Inside was a picture of the woman from the photograph, her eyes holding a promise of familiarity, a connection I could not yet fathom.\n\nI stood there, at the crossroads of past and present, the town of Sentinel a testament to the passage of time and the secrets it held. I knew that the answers I sought were here, buried beneath the layers of history and my own fractured memories. The emptiness of the town was a mirror, reflecting the void within, but also the possibility of understanding and redemption.\n\nWith a deep breath, I turned towards the mesa, its shadow stretching long and dark across the landscape. The path ahead was uncertain, fraught with danger and discovery. But I would walk it, step by step, unraveling the threads of memory and uncovering the truth that Sentinel held in its silent embrace.",

The fragments of memory stir once more, elusive and tantalizingly close. \"What happens if we fail?\"\n\nThe woman\u2019s eyes darken. \"Then the town will be lost forever, and the darkness will spread beyond the mesa, consuming everything in its path.\"\n\nA sense of urgency grips you. Despite the gaps in your memory, you feel a deep-seated resolve. \"What do we need to do?\"\n\nShe smiles, a flicker of hope in her eyes. \"First, we must find the others. There are more like you\u2014scattered throughout the town, awakening to the same call. Together, we have a chance.\"\n\nWith that, she turns and leads you back outside, the church bells tolling once more. The sun hangs low in the sky, casting long shadows across the deserted streets. You glance at the map in your hand, the cryptic symbols taking on new meaning.\n\nAs you walk through the ghostly town, you can't shake the feeling that Sentinel is watching you, waiting. Each step brings a new discovery\u2014a locked door, a hidden passage, a whispered name carried on the wind. The town's secrets are many, and you sense that uncovering them will not be easy.\n\nYour path leads you to an old general store, its windows boarded up and its sign hanging precariously from a single nail. Inside, the air is thick with the smell of decay. Shelves stand empty, their contents long since pilfered or rotted away. You hear a faint rustling from the back room, and your heart quickens.\n\nPushing open the door, you find a young man crouched over a pile of dusty books, his face pale and drawn. He looks up, startled, as you enter.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he demands, his voice trembling with fear.\n\nYou hold up your hands in a gesture of peace. \"I'm here to help. We need to find the others.\"\n\nHe hesitates, then nods slowly. \"I thought I was alone. But if there are more of us...\"\n\nTogether, you leave the store and continue your search, your numbers growing as you find others\u2014each with their own story, their own fragments of memory. A sense of camaraderie forms, binding you together in your shared purpose.\n\nAs the sun sets, you gather in the town square, the shadow of the mesa looming ever larger. The woman from the church stands before you, her eyes shining with determination.\n\n\"We have much to do,\" she says, her voice strong. \"But together, we can protect Sentinel and uncover the truth of what brought us here.\"\n\nThe church bells toll once more, their echoes a haunting reminder of the task ahead. As you look around at the faces of your newfound companions, you feel a renewed sense of hope. The secrets of Sentinel are many, but you are no longer alone in facing them.\n\nAnd so, with the night closing in and the shadow of the mesa stretching ever wider, you take the first step on a journey that will test your courage, your resolve, and the very fabric of your soul. The town of Sentinel holds its breath, waiting to see if you will uncover its secrets or be consumed by them.",
        "story_b": "The chill of the morning air was the first sensation to claw its way through the fog of sleep, its bite sharp against the exposed skin of my arms. I shivered awake, eyes fluttering open to a bleak sky framed by the jagged silhouette of a crumbling window. Dust motes floated lazily in the weak sunlight that filtered through, casting ethereal patterns that danced across the warped floorboards. Somewhere in the distance, the solemn toll of church bells reverberated through the empty streets, their haunting melody echoing off the oppressive shadow of the great mesa that loomed like a sentinel over the town.\n\nI sat up gingerly, the ache in my limbs protesting the movement. The room around me was unfamiliar, a sepulchral chamber filled with the remnants of a life long forgotten. A faded locket hung heavy around my neck, its golden surface tarnished by time. Inside, a photograph so blurred and faded that the faces it once captured were now mere specters, ghosts of a past I couldn\u2019t recall. I clutched it tightly, a tangible connection to whatever thread of identity remained.\n\nThe air was thick with the scent of decay, mingling with the faint, acrid odor of charred wood. As I rose to my feet, the wooden floor creaked in protest, a mournful sigh that echoed through the desolate house. My mind was a fractured landscape, memories scattered like autumn leaves caught in a turbulent wind. Each one elusive, slipping away just as I reached for it.\n\nI stumbled through the doorway, out into the open maw of Sentinel\u2019s abandoned streets. The town lay in ruins, its once vibrant heart stilled by years of neglect. Buildings stood like sentinels themselves, their windows dark and hollow, watching with silent judgment. The pavement beneath my feet was cracked and uneven, weeds forcing their way through the jagged fissures, nature reclaiming what humanity had forsaken.\n\nA whisper of wind rustled through the trees, carrying with it the faintest hint of voices, murmurs that seemed to originate from the very stones of the town. I followed the sound, each step weighted with an inexplicable sense of purpose, as if I were being drawn inexorably toward something. Somewhere in the depths of my mind, fragments of a memory flickered\u2014a promise whispered in the dark, a vow to uncover the truth buried beneath Sentinel\u2019s dust-laden facade.\n\nThe church stood at the heart of the town, its steeple piercing the sky like a skeletal finger pointing accusingly at the heavens. The doors hung ajar, swinging gently in the breeze. I hesitated on the threshold, the echo of the bells still resonating in the hollow of my chest. As I stepped inside, the air grew cool, the shadows deepening into an almost tangible presence that wrapped around me like a shroud.\n\nPews lay overturned, splintered wood strewn across the floor in haphazard disarray. The altar stood intact, a solitary beacon in the gloom, its surface layered in a fine patina of dust. I traced a finger across its surface, disturbing the quiet sanctity, and as the dust swirled into the air, a memory unfurled in my mind\u2014a vision of faces, blurred and indistinct, gathered in solemn assembly beneath the vaulted ceiling.\n\nI turned away, eyes drawn to the stained glass windows that lined the walls, their vibrant colors dulled by neglect. Each pane depicted scenes from some forgotten story, their meaning lost to me. Yet as I stood there, bathed in the muted glow of fractured light, I felt an inexplicable connection to this place, as if the very essence of Sentinel were woven into the fabric of my being.\n\nThe memory faded, leaving in its wake a profound sense of loss. I retraced my steps, emerging once more into the sunlit street. The bells had fallen silent, leaving only the whisper of the wind as it danced through the empty town. I wandered aimlessly, drawn to the outskirts where the mesa cast its long shadow over all.\n\nAt the base of the mesa, I discovered a path, barely discernible beneath the tangle of weeds and brambles. It wound its way up the steep incline, a precarious trail that beckoned with the promise of revelation. I hesitated, the weight of uncertainty heavy on my shoulders. Yet something within me stirred, a yearning to understand the enigma of my presence in this forsaken place.\n\nThe climb was arduous, my breath coming in ragged gasps as I ascended. The sun hung low in the sky, casting the landscape in a warm golden glow that belied the town\u2019s cold desolation. As I reached the summit, I paused to catch my breath, the vista unfurling before me in breathtaking majesty. Sentinel lay spread out below, a patchwork quilt of shadows and light, its secrets hidden beneath layers of time and dust.\n\nI stood there, at the edge of the world, the wind whipping through my hair, carrying with it the faintest echoes of voices from the past. A sense of peace settled over me, the realization dawning that while the full truth might remain elusive, I was not alone. Sentinel was a part of me, its mysteries intertwined with my own.\n\nAnd as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of crimson and gold, I turned away, the path leading me back into the heart of the town. Sentinel's secrets were not mine to uncover in a single day, but the journey had begun. The locket lay heavy against my chest, a reminder of the path yet to be traveled, the stories yet to be told.\n\nIn the ghost town of Sentinel, beneath the watchful gaze of the great mesa, I had awakened. And though the past lay shrouded in mystery, the future stretched out before me, a tapestry waiting to be woven anew.",

        "story_a": "Luz floated in the In Between, the weightlessness of the void around her a stark contrast to the heavy finality of her last moments. She had given everything\u2014her magic, her life\u2014to save her friends, her family. And now, she was here, wherever here was.\n\n\"Hey, kiddo.\"\n\nThe voice was soft, achingly familiar. Luz turned, her heart leaping into her throat as she saw Eda, the Owl Lady, standing before her. The older witch's wild mane of white hair seemed to ripple with a life of its own, even in this strange, timeless place.\n\n\"Eda?\" Luz's voice trembled, a mixture of hope and disbelief. \"Is it really you?\"\n\nEda's golden eyes softened, a smile tugging at her lips. \"It's me, Luz. Or at least, a version of me. Guess you could say I'm your guide.\"\n\nLuz's eyes filled with tears, and she rushed forward, enveloping Eda in a tight hug. The warmth of the embrace felt real, grounding her in this surreal space.\n\n\"I missed you so much,\" Luz whispered, her voice breaking. \"I didn't think I'd see you again.\"\n\nEda chuckled softly, her hand gently patting Luz's back. \"Missed you too, kid. But this isn't about me. It's about you.\"\n\nLuz pulled back, wiping her tears with the back of her hand. \"Where are we? What's going on?\"\n\n\"The In Between,\" Eda explained, her tone gentle. \"A place between life and death. You're here because you need to find peace, to let go.\"\n\nLuz shook her head, her eyes wide with fear and confusion. \"But I can't! My friends\u2014they need me. I can't just leave them!\"\n\nEda's expression grew serious, her gaze piercing. \"You did everything you could for them, Luz. You saved them. But now, you need to save yourself.\"\n\nLuz's mind raced, memories of her final battle flashing before her eyes. She had stood against the darkness, fought with every ounce of strength she had, all for the people she loved. But the cost had been her life.\n\n\"Eda,\" Luz said, her voice barely above a whisper, \"I'm scared.\"\n\nEda's eyes softened again, and she took Luz's hands in hers. \"I know, Luz. Letting go isn't easy. But you're not alone. You've got me, and you'll always have the love of your friends and family. That doesn't go away, even if you're not physically with them.\"\n\nLuz's heart ached, the thought of leaving everything behind almost too much to bear. But as she looked into Eda's eyes, she saw a glimmer of hope, a promise of peace.\n\n\"Will it hurt?\" Luz asked, her voice trembling.\n\nEda shook her head, a gentle smile on her lips. \"No, Luz. It won't hurt. It'll be like falling asleep, and when you wake up, you'll be free.\"\n\nLuz took a deep breath, trying to steady herself. She had faced so many challenges, so many fears, but this\u2014this was the hardest of all.\n\n\"Okay,\" she said finally, her voice steadying. \"I'm ready.\"\n\nEda's smile widened, and she pulled Luz into another hug. \"That's my girl. You've always been so brave.\"\n\nAs the In Between began to fade, Luz felt a sense of calm wash over her, the weight of her sacrifice lifting.

        "story_b": "The In Between was everything and nothing at once. A swirling void of colors and shadows, yet somehow, it felt achingly familiar. Luz stood there, feeling the silence press heavily on her chest. \"What if I let go and lose everything?\" she thought, the question echoing around her like a restless ghost.\n\nHer feet moved without direction, each step sending ripples through the haze. \"Well, here goes nothing,\" she mumbled, her voice swallowed by the vastness. In the distance, a figure emerged, one she recognized instantly, despite the blurred outlines. Eda.\n\n\"Kid, you always were stubborn, even in the afterlife,\" Eda chuckled, her voice warm and teasing. Luz felt a pang of relief mixed with something sharper\u2014guilt, maybe. She'd given up everything, hadn't she? Her family, her friends, the world she'd fought so hard to protect.\n\n\"Eda, I\u2014\" Luz's voice cracked, the words heavy and unwieldy. \n\nEda held up a hand, her expression softening. \"I know, Luz. I know why you're here.\" \n\nThey walked together, each step taking them past memories\u2014windows into Luz's past. There was the time she'd first arrived in the Boiling Isles, eyes wide with wonder. Another showed her battling alongside her friends, a fierce grin on her face. And then, the moment of sacrifice\u2014a blinding light, her heart full and breaking all at once.\n\nLuz squeezed her eyes shut against the memory, feeling its weight anew. \"Am I truly ready to leave them behind?\" she whispered, more to herself than to Eda. \n\nEda stopped by a tranquil river, its surface reflecting an endless sky. \"You don't have to let go of everything,\" she said, sitting down and patting the ground beside her. \"It's about finding peace, kid.\"\n\nLuz sat, dipping her fingers into the water. It was cool, soothing. \"Peace,\" she repeated, tasting the word. It felt foreign on her tongue. \n\nThey sat in silence for a while, the river's gentle flow filling the gaps between them. Luz's mind was a storm, thoughts swirling and clashing. \"I just... I miss them,\" she admitted, her voice small.\n\nEda nodded, her gaze distant. \"That's the thing about love, Luz. It doesn't just disappear. It's part of you, always.\"\n\nLuz let the words settle, feeling their truth seep into her bones. She thought of her mom, of Amity, of King and Hooty and everyone else who'd made the Boiling Isles feel like home. \n\n\"In the vast emptiness, Luz felt the weight of her solitude,\" she mused, but with Eda beside her, it was less suffocating. Slowly, she turned to face Eda. \"How do I find peace?\" she asked, voice tinged with both fear and hope.\n\nEda grinned, a twinkle in her eye. \"You start by forgiving yourself, Luz. Trust me, it's worth it.\"\n\nLuz hesitated, then reached out, her hand hovering over Eda's. It was a small gesture, but it felt monumental. \"I guess this is it, huh?\" she said, her lips curving into a tentative smile.\n\nEda squeezed her hand, a promise of support. \"Yeah, kid. This is it.\"\n\nAs they sat together by the river, the In Between felt a little less daunting. Luz wasn't sure if she was entirely ready to move on, but with Eda's guidance, she could at least begin to find her way. And maybe, just maybe, that was enough.",

Hunter wouldn't exist if she hadn\u2019t come to the Boiling Isles. Amity would still be wrapped around her mothers finger. Willow would've never switched to the plant track. Gus (technically Agustus if she had just gone to camp) would be forever doubting himself with Willow as his only friend (and vice versa). Vee would still be trapped, she wouldn't be able to run forever. Matt would think he still had to prove himself. Eda would\u2019ve never opened up. King would keep living in denial. And the Collector, they would still be trapped with no way out (a fate he never deserved). The magic mixers (Jerbo, Viney and Barcus) would still be in the detention track. Luz smiled as she was lifted to the air, the Titan\u2019s power starting to leave her body.\n\u201cEda, King, thank you for being a part of my life.\u201d Luz said, before the Titan\u2019s spirit moved on and so did she.\nDeath was much more pleasant this time around. And she even smiled when she hit the strangely warm water in the In Between. She closed her eyes letting a few tears loose as she left the realm she loved. No one to pull her out of the water: she sank.\nLuz\u2019s eyes opened as she felt warmth. Not the all consuming warmth of the water but of love and the good feelings Luz missed. She looked in front of her.\n\u201cD\u2026. Dad?\u201d She said not quite believing it.\n\u201cHi Little Light.\u201d Manny said, opening his arms toward her.\nLuz ran towards him. A lifetime's worth of hug in one embrace. Luz cried happily wrapped in her father\u2019s warm hug.\n\u201cYou did so good Luz. My good witch.\u201d He said right in her ear neither breaking the hug.\nLuz agreed for the first time in a very long time. She had saved the realm she loved and the people she loved.\n\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Manny asked, pulling away and holding out his hand to Luz.\nLuz nodded, taking his hand. And the best part was she really was.",
        "story_a": "Luz floated in the In Between, the weightlessness of the void around her a stark contrast to the heavy finality of her last moments. She had given everything\u2014her magic, her life\u2014to save her friends, her family. And now, she was here, wherever here was.\n\n\"Hey, kiddo.\"\n\nThe voice was soft, achingly familiar. Luz turned, her heart leaping into her throat as she saw Eda, the Owl Lady, standing before her. The older witch's wild mane of white hair seemed to ripple with a life of its own, even in this strange, timeless place.\n\n\"Eda?\" Luz's voice trembled, a mixture of hope and disbelief. \"Is it really you?\"\n\nEda's golden eyes softened, a smile tugging at her lips. \"It's me, Luz. Or at least, a version of me. Guess you could say I'm your guide.\"\n\nLuz's eyes filled with tears, and she rushed forward, enveloping Eda in a tight hug. The warmth of the embrace felt real, grounding her in this surreal space.\n\n\"I missed you so much,\" Luz whispered, her voice breaking. \"I didn't think I'd see you again.\"\n\nEda chuckled softly, her hand gently patting Luz's back. \"Missed you too, kid. But this isn't about me. It's about you.\"\n\nLuz pulled back, wiping her tears with the back of her hand. \"Where are we? What's going on?\"\n\n\"The In Between,\" Eda explained, her tone gentle. \"A place between life and death. You're here because you need to find peace, to let go.\"\n\nLuz shook her head, her eyes wide with fear and confusion. \"But I can't! My friends\u2014they need me. I can't just leave them!\"\n\nEda's expression grew serious, her gaze piercing. \"You did everything you could for them, Luz. You saved them. But now, you need to save yourself.\"\n\nLuz's mind raced, memories of her final battle flashing before her eyes. She had stood against the darkness, fought with every ounce of strength she had, all for the people she loved. But the cost had been her life.\n\n\"Eda,\" Luz said, her voice barely above a whisper, \"I'm scared.\"\n\nEda's eyes softened again, and she took Luz's hands in hers. \"I know, Luz. Letting go isn't easy. But you're not alone. You've got me, and you'll always have the love of your friends and family. That doesn't go away, even if you're not physically with them.\"\n\nLuz's heart ached, the thought of leaving everything behind almost too much to bear. But as she looked into Eda's eyes, she saw a glimmer of hope, a promise of peace.\n\n\"Will it hurt?\" Luz asked, her voice trembling.\n\nEda shook her head, a gentle smile on her lips. \"No, Luz. It won't hurt. It'll be like falling asleep, and when you wake up, you'll be free.\"\n\nLuz took a deep breath, trying to steady herself. She had faced so many challenges, so many fears, but this\u2014this was the hardest of all.\n\n\"Okay,\" she said finally, her voice steadying. \"I'm ready.\"\n\nEda's smile widened, and she pulled Luz into another hug. \"That's my girl. You've always been so brave.\"\n\nAs the In Between began to fade, Luz felt a sense of calm wash over her, the weight of her sacrifice lifting. She was ready to let go, to find peace.\n\nAnd with Eda by her side, she knew she wouldn't be alone.",
        "story_b": "Luz stepped into the In Between, her feet sinking into a misty, color-shifting landscape that seemed both infinite and intimate. The air was cool, clinging to her skin like a gentle embrace, and a soft hum of distant music guided her uncertain steps. She felt lost, an ache in her chest where her heart was a tangled web of longing and release.\n\nThe world around her shimmered, shifting like the surface of a dream she couldn\u2019t quite grasp. Floating memories brushed past her, whispering echoes of past decisions. Here, a glimpse of Eda\u2019s laugh; there, King\u2019s tiny hand wrapped around hers. Luz reached out, trying to hold onto them, but they slipped through her fingers like grains of sand.\n\n\u201cLuz,\u201d a voice called, warm and familiar, pulling her attention from the kaleidoscope of memories. She turned to find a familiar face, one she\u2019d never thought to see again: her mother.\n\n\u201cMom?\u201d Luz\u2019s voice trembled, her eyes filling with unshed tears. Camila stood before her, ethereal and serene, a soft glow surrounding her like a halo.\n\n\u201cMi hija,\u201d Camila said, stepping forward and wrapping Luz in a hug that felt as real as any they\u2019d shared. \u201cYou\u2019ve been so brave.\u201d\n\nLuz clung to her mother, her fears and regrets spilling out in a rush of words. \u201cI\u2014I didn\u2019t mean to leave you. I just wanted to protect everyone. Was it worth it?\u201d\n\nCamila pulled back slightly, her eyes filled with understanding. \u201cYour heart has always been full of love, Luz. You\u2019ve done so much, given so much of yourself. But now, it\u2019s time to think about what you need.\u201d\n\nLuz turned, looking out at the shifting landscape. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can let go,\u201d she admitted. \u201cThere\u2019s so much I\u2019ll miss.\u201d\n\nA glowing path appeared beneath her feet, brightening as she spoke, as if urging her forward. Camila nodded, her expression gentle. \u201cAre you ready to find peace, or is there something still holding you back?\u201d\n\nLuz closed her eyes, listening to the soft hum of the music that seemed to echo her heartbeat. Memories fluttered around her, each one a testament to the life she\u2019d led, the love she\u2019d shared. She thought of Amity, her smile like sunlight breaking through clouds; of Gus and Willow, their unwavering friendship a constant light in the darkness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d Luz confessed, her voice barely above a whisper. \u201cWhat if I\u2019m not ready?\u201d\n\nCamila placed a hand on Luz\u2019s cheek, her touch cool and reassuring. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be scared. But you\u2019re not alone, Luz. I\u2019ll be with you, whatever you decide.\u201d\n\nLuz opened her eyes, meeting her mother\u2019s gaze. She took a deep breath, feeling the weight of her choices, the pull of the past and the promise of peace. Slowly, she reached out, her hand hovering over a glowing portal that pulsed with a warm, inviting light.\n\nThe portal seemed to breathe with her, a living thing that promised rest and renewal. Luz hesitated, her heart a storm of emotions. But as she stood there, she felt a sense of calm wash over her, a clarity she hadn\u2019t expected.\n\nWith a final glance at her mother, Luz stepped forward, her decision made. As her fingers brushed the portal\u2019s surface, the light enveloped her, carrying her toward something new, something beautiful.\n\nIn the In Between, Luz found her peace.",

        "prompt": "In a future where the Roman Empire never fell and now rules the stars, a small task group of warships is sent to intercept an unknown alien fleet near Pluto. Outnumbered and outgunned, the crew must face impossible odds while the Senate awaits news of their fate.",
        "ground_truth": "#Prologue: Aboard the Roman Imperial Ship Sicilia #Enroute to Intercept FROM: IMPERIAL FLEET HEADQUARTERS TO: IMPERIAL WARSHIP SICILIA SUBJ: EMERGENCY ORDERS PROCEED AT BEST SPEED VICINITY OF PLUTO. UNKNOWN SHIPS DETECTED. ASSUMED HOSTILE FORMIX INVESTIGATE. ENGAGE IF ID CONFIRMED. Primus Tertius Athanasius scoffed as he read the emergency orders flashed onto the comms panel. Orders confirmed, Captainfor what its worth. Sitting in the command chair, *Navis Praefectus* Ioannes Paulus glanced up from his own screen to regard his Executive Officer. Nothing we didnt already know, but at least now we have authority to engage. Time to intercept? Ninety minutes, Sir. Paulus did the math in his head. 90 minutes to intercept, 30 minutes to engagewho was he kidding? Theyd be lucky if they lasted ten minutes against them. Five hours for the light from the battle to reach Earth. He glanced at the chronometer. Theyd know in six and a half hours that Task Group 40 had died nobly for the Senate and People of Rome. Itd be around 0600 when the Junior Consul saw the results. Then hed have the singular privilege of briefing the battles outcome to the Senate when they convened promptly at 0900. He thought of his old roommate from the Imperial Star Academy. Tiberius Valerius Lupus hadnt graduated at the top of their class, but he had certainly proven himself when and where it counted. Lupus had always been a couple of steps ahead of the rest of them career-wise. First in their class to cruise to Proxima Centauri, first to become Primus aboard a warship, first get commandand sure as *hades* first in their class to achieve Senatorial rank, let alone the Consulship. *Well, old chum* Paulus thought to himself, *I shall be first to shake hands with the Ferryman. Ill have beaten you to something at last!* Paulus smiled sardonically to himself. Very few believed in the old religion of Republican Rome, lost in the mists of time before it had become the City of Peter and Paul. *First to the Pearly Gates* would have been a far more apt description, but the old vernacular had held on in Roman speech, even if the old pagan religion had faded. Selecting the *Loqui Inter Naves* (Talk Between Ships, or TBS), he waited a moment for the other two captains to join him on the circuit. Why do you think theyre here, Primus? In their minds, are they continuing the previous war, or has some genius at Proxima Centauri or beyond managed to kick open their anthill again? Athanasius shrugged. Ill make one last inspection of the weapons crews. Make sure theyre in fighting trim. Make it quick, Paulus said after him as he exited the bridge. Pressing the transmit button on TBS, he said, All ships, Task Group 40, this is *Sicilia,* over. *Liguria*, over. *Cisalpina,* over. *Sicilia,* the fifth ship in the *Trireme* class, was accompanied by two smaller *Bireme* class ships, the *Liguria* and *Cisalpina.* His task group was a versatile mix of ships well-suited to picket duty, but against a large force like this one, they had little chance of success. The task group was off-station, headed for a scheduled refueling evolution at Orbital Station Neptune, and had been just an hour away from docking when their sensors had picked up light announcing the arrival of the Formic fleet. There wasnt supposed to be a jump point in that portion of the Kuiper belt, so it hadnt been actively patrolled. They had already been in the Sol system three hours before Task Group 40 was even aware they were here. Paulus had turned the group around as soon as they had received the sensor data. Nine ships exhibiting strong blue shift. They were definitely headed toward the inner solar system. Task Group 40 had been on this intercept heading for nearly eleven hours now at a speed of 0.2c, or two tenths the speed of light. It didnt feel like they were traversing over 37,000 Roman miles every second, but space was vast. They were burning their fuel at an excessive rate; even if they survived the engagement they wouldnt have sufficient reserves for a direct burn back to Neptuneor anywhere. The best they could hope for would be to insert themselves into a long parabolic descent towards Jupiter in the hopes that tankers from Titan would rendezvous with them. *If they survived.* Task Group 40, standby for engagement orders. Johannes tapped a control which transmitted the combat formation theyd be using along with a set of pre-programmed maneuvers and firing commands. Things would happen too quickly at the merge, and the resulting clash would be over in a fraction of a second. Humans simply couldnt react swiftly enough; it had to be left to the computers. After the merge, hed assess the resulting geometry, damage dealt to the enemy, and the damage status of his own force. Hed then calculate a re-engage vector to bring them back around for another pass. Both ships acknowledged receipt. He continued, Right now our combined closure rate is 0.44c, way too fast to get any hits. Four minutes prior to the merge, well execute a swing ship maneuver, and brake down to 0.1c. If the Formix keep going, well get more hits on them but will have a devil of a time catching them in a tail chase. If the bugs decelerate as well, then well have a good fight on our hands. Athanasius was back on the bridge, listening to Paulus as he finished his transmission. Sounds like a solid battle plan, Captain, except for one thing. Oh really? Paulus could not conceal his annoyance. Whats that? Im not sure that the bugs even *have* hands. The tension on the bridge broke as several of the watch guffawed out loud. Paulus made a pantomime of hurling his data tablet at his executive officer, his scowl momentarily lifting as he did so. #THE PRAESIDIUM, ROME. #0604 HOURS. The huge imaging array which orbited Earth at a distance of 300,000 miles fed a constant stream of imagery back to the command center as the photons arrived. Despite being the best optics mankind had at its disposal, the participants in a battle which had commenced hours earlier were images large enough to identify as ships and ascertain their general class, but lacked much more detail than that. Digital encrypted datalinks from each ship in Task Group 40, arriving concurrent with the optical information, filled in the rest of the story. As the two groups of specks plunged towards each other in the optical feed, the datalinks provided detailed information on the enemy fleet as well as the status of each ship. At the merge, the optical feed had suddenly become cluttered with numerous bright flashes of light. A heartbeat later, the two groups of specks were opening again. Instead of 9 Formic ships, there were now 7. An expanding cloud of debris marked all that remained of Task Group 40. The datalinks had failed before the onboard computers could compute and transmit any significant enemy battle damage assessment. The Tribune of the Watch stared at the displays. *Deus misereatur eorum*, he muttered, crossing himself. Regaining his composure he began the task of analyzing the engagement in an attempt to learn as much from the battle as could be determined. The others in the room turned from the display and regarded the togate man standing among them. Consul Tiberius Valerius Lupus had seen enough. Nodding to those around him, he exited the command center. Outside, a car waited to take him to the Senate house. Sirens blaring and lights flashing, the Praetorian motorcycle guard cleared the traffic ahead of him as his sedan sped toward the Capitoline Hill.",
        "story_a": "The cold light of distant stars glinted off the sleek, metallic hulls of the Roman warships as they carved through the void near Pluto. The flagship, *Imperator Augustus*, led the formation. Its bronze and steel exterior bore the scars of countless battles, each one a testament to the enduring might of the Roman Empire. The insignia of the Senate and the People of Rome (SPQR) was emblazoned proudly on its side, a symbol of unbroken legacy and indomitable power.\n\nInside the command deck, the air buzzed with a tense hum. Centurion Lucius Marcellus stood at the helm, his chiseled features cast in the harsh light of the control panels. His eyes, sharp and calculating, scanned the holographic display before him. It showed the approaching alien fleet, an ominous swarm of unfamiliar vessels that dwarfed the Roman task group both in number and size.\n\n\"Status report,\" Lucius barked, his voice cutting through the murmured conversations of his officers.\n\nTribune Aelia Varro stepped forward, her expression as disciplined as her meticulously maintained uniform. \"The alien fleet is closing in, sir. Our scans indicate they have advanced shielding and weaponry far superior to our own. Estimated time to contact: fifteen minutes.\"\n\nLucius nodded, his mind racing. The Senate had dispatched them with little information, only a direct order to intercept and assess the alien threat. The task group, comprised of the *Imperator Augustus* and four smaller warships, was all that stood between the unknown intruders and the heart of Roman space.\n\n\"Prepare the ships for battle,\" he commanded. \"Activate all defensive systems and prime the weapon arrays.\"\n\nAs the crew moved with practiced efficiency, Lucius turned his gaze to the viewport. Beyond the cold expanse of space, Pluto's icy surface glimmered faintly, a silent witness to the impending conflict. He couldn't help but feel a pang of unease. The Roman Empire had faced countless enemies over the millennia, but this... this was different. The unknown was a foe they had yet to conquer.\n\nAelia's voice broke through his thoughts. \"Sir, incoming transmission from the alien fleet.\"\n\nLucius straightened, his eyes narrowing. \"Patch it through.\"\n\nThe holographic display flickered, then stabilized, revealing an alien figure. Its appearance was unlike anything Lucius had ever seen, with elongated limbs, a sleek, angular face, and eyes that glowed with an eerie luminescence. The creature spoke in a language that was at once melodic and unsettling, its words translated into Latin by the ship's advanced communication systems.\n\n\"Roman vessels, you are trespassing in our territory. Withdraw immediately, or face annihilation.\"\n\nLucius took a step forward, his voice steady and resolute. \"This is Centurion Lucius Marcellus of the Roman Empire. We are here to defend our space and our people. We will not retreat.\"\n\nThe alien's eyes seemed to bore into him, assessing, calculating. \"Your resistance is futile. Your empire is no match for our technology. This is your final warning.\"\n\nThe transmission ended abruptly, leaving a heavy silence in its wake. Lucius turned to Aelia, who met his gaze with unwavering determination.\n\n\"We fight,\" she said simply.\n\nLucius nodded. \"We fight.\"\n\nThe next few minutes passed in a blur of activity. Orders were given and executed with military precision, the crew moving as one cohesive unit. Lucius could feel the tension mounting, a palpable energy that thrummed through the ship. He took a deep breath, steeling himself for the battle to come.\n\nThe alien fleet loomed closer, their ships a dark, menacing presence against the backdrop of stars. The Romans held their formation, the *Imperator Augustus* at the forefront, its weapons primed and ready.\n\n\"All ships, fire at will,\" Lucius commanded, his voice ringing with authority.\n\nThe Roman warships unleashed a barrage of missiles and laser fire, their weapons lighting up the darkness of space. The alien vessels responded in kind, their advanced weaponry cutting through the void with deadly precision. The battle was fierce and unrelenting, a chaotic dance of destruction and survival.\n\nExplosions rocked the *Imperator Augustus*, the hull shuddering under the impact. Lucius gripped the edge of the control panel, his knuckles white. He could see the damage reports flooding in, the ship's systems struggling to keep up with the onslaught.\n\n\"Centurion, we're taking heavy fire!\" Aelia shouted over the din.\n\n\"Maintain formation!\" Lucius ordered. \"We cannot afford to break ranks.\"\n\nThe smaller Roman ships darted and weaved, their agility a stark contrast to the hulking alien vessels. They struck with precision, targeting weak points and exploiting vulnerabilities. But the aliens were relentless, their technology far surpassing anything the Romans had encountered.\n\nA sudden explosion rocked the ship, sending Lucius sprawling to the floor. He scrambled to his feet, his ears ringing. The command deck was a scene of chaos, smoke and sparks filling the air.\n\n\"Damage report!\" he demanded.\n\nAelia's voice was strained but steady. \"Shields are failing, and we've lost primary weapons control. Hull integrity is compromised.\"\n\nLucius clenched his jaw. They were outmatched and outgunned, their chances of victory slim. But retreat was not an option. The Senate awaited news of their fate, and the honor of Rome was at stake.\n\n\"Prepare for boarding action,\" he said, his voice grim. \"If we cannot defeat them in space, we will take the fight to them.\"\n\nThe crew moved with urgency, donning their exosuits and arming themselves with blasters and plasma swords. Lucius led the way, his heart pounding. The corridors of the *Imperator Augustus* were filled with the sounds of battle, the ship's systems straining under the relentless assault.\n\nThey reached the airlock, the hatch opening with a hiss. Beyond it, the alien vessel loomed, its sleek, angular design a stark contrast to the Roman warship. Lucius took a deep breath, his resolve hardening.\n\n\"For Rome,\" he said, and stepped into the void.\n\nThe boarding party launched themselves across the gap, their exosuits propelling them toward the alien ship. They landed with a jolt, their magnetic boots securing them to the hull. Lucius led the charge, his blaster at the ready.\n\nThe interior of the alien vessel was a labyrinth of smooth, metallic corridors, the air filled with an eerie hum. The Romans moved cautiously, their weapons trained on every shadow. They encountered little resistance at first, the corridors eerily empty.\n\nBut as they advanced deeper into the ship, the aliens struck. They emerged from hidden alcoves and shadowed corners, their weapons blazing. The Romans fought with fierce determination, their training and discipline giving them an edge.\n\nLucius moved with the precision of a seasoned warrior, his blaster cutting down alien after alien. Aelia was at his side, her plasma sword a blur of deadly light. They pressed forward, their goal the ship's control center.\n\nThe battle raged on, the corridors echoing with the sounds of combat. The Romans fought with everything they had, their determination fueled by the knowledge that their empire depended on them.\n\nFinally, they reached the control center. The doors slid open, revealing a room filled with alien technology. At its center stood the alien leader, its eyes glowing with a fierce intelligence.\n\nLucius raised his blaster, his voice ringing with authority. \"Surrender, and your lives will be spared.\"\n\nThe alien leader regarded him with a cold, calculating gaze. \"You fight bravely, Roman. But you are too late. Our fleet will overwhelm your empire. Your resistance is futile.\"\n\nLucius stepped forward, his blaster trained on the alien. \"We will never surrender. Rome will never fall.\"\n\nThe alien leader's eyes narrowed, and for a moment, Lucius saw something akin to respect in its gaze. Then, with a swift motion, the alien activated a control panel.\n\n\"Farewell, Roman,\" it said, and the room erupted in a blinding light.\n\nLucius felt a searing pain, and then darkness claimed him.\n\nWhen he awoke, he was back on the *Imperator Augustus*, the ship's medics hovering over him. The battle was over, the alien fleet retreating. They had survived, but at a great cost.\n\nLucius sat up, his body aching. Aelia stood beside him, her expression weary but determined.\n\n\"We did it,\" she said softly. \"We held the line.\"\n\nLucius nodded, a sense of grim satisfaction settling over him. They had faced impossible odds and emerged victorious. The Senate would hear of their bravery, and the Roman Empire would endure.\n\nBut as he looked out at the cold expanse of space, he couldn't shake the feeling that this was only the beginning. The alien threat was far from over, and the future of the empire was uncertain.\n\nFor now, though, they had won. And that was enough.\n\n\"Set course for home,\" Lucius ordered, his voice steady. \"We have a victory to report.\"\n\nThe *Imperator Augustus* turned, its engines flaring to life. The Roman warships began their journey back to the heart of the empire, their spirits lifted by the hard-fought victory.\n\nAs they sailed through the stars, Lucius knew that the challenges ahead would be great. But with the strength and determination of Rome behind them, they would face whatever came next.\n\nFor the glory of Rome, and the future of the empire.",
        "story_b": "**PROLOGUE. ABOARD THE IMPERIAL ROMAN WARSHIP *AURORA VICTRIX*, NEAR PLUTO.** \n\nThe icy void stretched infinitely around the Roman task group, a stark reminder of their isolation on the frontier of the Empire. Captain Marcus Julius Cassianus stood on the bridge, his gaze fixed upon the vastness of space as if seeking to pierce its mysteries. The grand ship, *Aurora Victrix*, bore the trappings of its heritage\u2014golden insignia of the eagle, columns etched into its hull, a fusion of ancient tradition and cutting-edge technology.\n\n\u201cImperator Cassianus,\u201d spoke a voice, formal and steady, breaking the silence. It was Tribune Lucius Antonius, young and eager, his eyes bright with ambition. \u201cThe alien fleet approaches. Our scouts report an armada, glinting with unknown metals and pulsating with eerie light.\u201d\n\nCassianus nodded, his expression unmoved, a mask of stoic resolve. He embodied the very essence of Roman valor, yet the burdens of command weighed heavily upon him. His duty was clear: protect the Empire from this enigmatic threat, whatever the cost. The Senate\u2019s decree, the *Senatus Consultum Ultimum*, left no room for failure.\n\n\u201cTribune, prepare the men,\u201d Cassianus ordered, his voice resonant with authority. \u201cWe shall meet this threat head-on, with the courage of our ancestors.\u201d\n\nAntonius saluted sharply, though a flicker of doubt crossed his features\u2014a shadow of the fear that lurked in the hearts of many. The young officer had harbored visions of glory, of proving himself in the eyes of Rome, yet now faced the daunting reality of their predicament.\n\n**THE BRIDGE OF *AURORA VICTRIX*.** \n\nThe command center was a marvel of engineering, its walls adorned with mosaics depicting the Empire\u2019s illustrious past. Holographic displays flickered with tactical data, casting a cool glow over the room. The crew moved with precision, each member a vital part of the intricate machine that was *Aurora Victrix*.\n\n\u201cImperator, the alien vessels are unlike any we have encountered,\u201d reported Decurion Tiberius Valens, his tone a mixture of awe and apprehension. \u201cTheir formation is... fluid, ever-shifting. Our sensors struggle to lock on.\u201d\n\nCassianus stared at the display, a kaleidoscope of unknown designs and energies. \u201cThen we shall adapt, as we have always done,\u201d he declared, yet even his words could not dispel the uncertainty that hung in the air.\n\nBeside him, Antonius spoke softly, \u201cDo you truly believe we can withstand them, Imperator?\u201d\n\nCassianus turned, meeting the young man\u2019s gaze with a steady one of his own. \u201cBelief is the foundation of victory, Tribune. We hold the legacy of Rome in our hands. We shall not falter.\u201d\n\n**THE SENATE HOUSE, ROME, EARTH.**\n\nFar from the cold reaches of Pluto, the Senate convened in the heart of the eternal city. Marble columns rose majestically, and the air buzzed with the fervor of debate. Senators in their togas engaged in heated discourse, their voices rising and falling like the tides of the Tiber.\n\n\u201cThe strategic importance of Pluto cannot be underestimated,\u201d proclaimed Senator Gaius Flavius, his voice carrying the weight of authority. \u201cIt is the gateway to the outer territories. We cannot allow an alien power to threaten our dominion.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut at what cost, Gaius?\u201d countered Senator Julia Antonia, her tone sharp and incisive. \u201cWe risk our finest warriors, our most advanced ships, on a venture with no certainty of success.\u201d\n\nThe Senate\u2019s envoy, Envoy Quintus Marcellus, stood quietly, absorbing the arguments. His presence aboard the task group had been intended as a show of support, yet he found himself torn between his duty to the Empire and the whispers of ambition that stirred within him.\n\n**THE BATTLE ABOVE PLUTO.**\n\nThe task group emerged from the shadow of Pluto, the alien fleet arrayed before them like a cosmic phalanx. Cassianus surveyed his forces, the *Aurora Victrix* at the forefront, flanked by her sister ships, the *Luna Invicta* and the *Stella Bellator*.\n\n\u201cHelm, bring us into formation,\u201d Cassianus commanded. \u201cWe shall meet them with the strength of Rome.\u201d\n\nThe ships maneuvered with the grace of dancers, their trireme-inspired hulls gleaming under the distant sun. Plasma engines roared to life, propelling them forward, a testament to the Empire\u2019s ingenuity.\n\n\u201cEnemy vessels closing,\u201d warned Valens. \u201cThey are within range.\u201d\n\n\u201cEngage,\u201d Cassianus ordered, a single word that sent a ripple of action through the bridge.\n\nThe Roman ships unleashed their fury, beams of energy lancing across the void. The alien fleet responded in kind, their weapons strange and unfamiliar, yet devastatingly effective. The battle was joined, a dance of destruction played out against the backdrop of the stars.\n\nAntonius watched, his heart pounding with a mix of fear and exhilaration. This was the crucible in which he would prove himself, or fall as so many had before.\n\n\u201cConcentrate fire on their flagship,\u201d Cassianus directed, his mind a whir of calculations and strategy. \u201cBreak their formation.\u201d\n\nThe Roman ships pressed the attack, their weapons systems straining under the intensity of battle. Yet the alien fleet adapted, their fluid movements confounding the Romans\u2019 efforts.\n\n\u201cThey are attempting to envelop us,\u201d Valens warned, his voice edged with urgency.\n\nCassianus\u2019s mind raced, seeking a way to turn the tide. \u201cTribune, prepare the cohort for boarding action. We shall take the fight to them.\u201d\n\nAntonius\u2019s eyes widened at the audacity of the plan, yet he nodded, his resolve hardening. \u201cYes, Imperator. For Rome.\u201d\n\n**THE BOARDING.**\n\nAs the battle raged outside, Antonius led his men through the airlock, their armor gleaming under the ship\u2019s artificial lighting. The boarding craft launched, hurtling toward the alien vessel, a spear aimed at the heart of the unknown.\n\nThey breached the alien hull, disembarking into a corridor of strange, pulsing light. The atmosphere was thick with tension, the alien architecture both wondrous and disorienting.\n\n\u201cStay close,\u201d Antonius instructed, his voice firm. \u201cWe shall find their command center and disable it.\u201d\n\nThe legionnaires advanced, their formation tight, their every step a testament to Roman discipline. They encountered resistance, alien warriors appearing from the shadows, their forms shifting and ethereal.\n\nAntonius fought with the ferocity of a cornered lion, his gladius flashing in the dim light. His men followed his lead, their training and resolve carrying them through the maelstrom.\n\nIn the heart of the ship, Antonius found the alien command center, a chamber of swirling energies and strange devices. He marveled at its complexity, yet he understood its significance.\n\n\u201cDisable it,\u201d he ordered, his voice resolute. \u201cWe shall cripple their command.\u201d\n\nAs his men moved to obey, Antonius took a moment to reflect on the journey that had brought him here. He had sought glory and found himself in the crucible of destiny, a fulcrum upon which the fate of the Empire balanced.\n\n**THE AFTERMATH.**\n\nThe battle above Pluto had reached its climax, the alien fleet retreating into the void, their strength broken. The Roman task group had held firm, their valor and ingenuity securing a hard-won victory.\n\nCassianus stood on the bridge, the tension of command giving way to the satisfaction of triumph. Yet he knew that the cost had been great, the scars of battle etched into the hulls of their ships and the hearts of their crew.\n\nAntonius returned, his armor scorched and battered, yet his eyes alight with the fire of accomplishment. \u201cImperator, the alien command is disabled. We have prevailed.\u201d\n\nCassianus nodded, a rare smile touching his lips. \u201cYou have done Rome proud, Tribune. Your courage has ensured our victory.\u201d\n\nAs the task group regrouped, a message was prepared, to be sent back to the Senate. It was a missive of triumph, yet tinged with the uncertainty of what lay ahead.\n\nThe alien fleet had retreated, yet their intentions remained a mystery. The task group\u2019s fate, and that of the Empire, hung in the balance, a question mark upon the horizon of history.\n\n\u201cFor Rome. For the stars. For our future,\u201d Cassianus intoned, his voice a rallying cry that echoed through the ship, a promise of hope in the vastness of space.",

UNKNOWN SHIPS DETECTED. ASSUMED HOSTILE FORMIX INVESTIGATE. ENGAGE IF ID CONFIRMED. Primus Tertius Athanasius scoffed as he read the emergency orders flashed onto the comms panel. Orders confirmed, Captainfor what its worth. Sitting in the command chair, *Navis Praefectus* Ioannes Paulus glanced up from his own screen to regard his Executive Officer. Nothing we didnt already know, but at least now we have authority to engage. Time to intercept? Ninety minutes, Sir. Paulus did the math in his head. 90 minutes to intercept, 30 minutes to engagewho was he kidding? Theyd be lucky if they lasted ten minutes against them. Five hours for the light from the battle to reach Earth. He glanced at the chronometer. Theyd know in six and a half hours that Task Group 40 had died nobly for the Senate and People of Rome. Itd be around 0600 when the Junior Consul saw the results. Then hed have the singular privilege of briefing the battles outcome to the Senate when they convened promptly at 0900. He thought of his old roommate from the Imperial Star Academy. Tiberius Valerius Lupus hadnt graduated at the top of their class, but he had certainly proven himself when and where it counted. Lupus had always been a couple of steps ahead of the rest of them career-wise. First in their class to cruise to Proxima Centauri, first to become Primus aboard a warship, first get commandand sure as *hades* first in their class to achieve Senatorial rank, let alone the Consulship. *Well, old chum* Paulus thought to himself, *I shall be first to shake hands with the Ferryman. Ill have beaten you to something at last!* Paulus smiled sardonically to himself. Very few believed in the old religion of Republican Rome, lost in the mists of time before it had become the City of Peter and Paul. *First to the Pearly Gates* would have been a far more apt description, but the old vernacular had held on in Roman speech, even if the old pagan religion had faded. Selecting the *Loqui Inter Naves* (Talk Between Ships, or TBS), he waited a moment for the other two captains to join him on the circuit. Why do you think theyre here, Primus? In their minds, are they continuing the previous war, or has some genius at Proxima Centauri or beyond managed to kick open their anthill again? Athanasius shrugged. Ill make one last inspection of the weapons crews. Make sure theyre in fighting trim. Make it quick, Paulus said after him as he exited the bridge. Pressing the transmit button on TBS, he said, All ships, Task Group 40, this is *Sicilia,* over. *Liguria*, over. *Cisalpina,* over. *Sicilia,* the fifth ship in the *Trireme* class, was accompanied by two smaller *Bireme* class ships, the *Liguria* and *Cisalpina.* His task group was a versatile mix of ships well-suited to picket duty, but against a large force like this one, they had little chance of success. The task group was off-station, headed for a scheduled refueling evolution at Orbital Station Neptune, and had been just an hour away from docking when their sensors had picked up light announcing the arrival of the Formic fleet. There wasnt supposed to be a jump point in that portion of the Kuiper belt, so it hadnt been actively patrolled. They had already been in the Sol system three hours before Task Group 40 was even aware they were here. Paulus had turned the group around as soon as they had received the sensor data. Nine ships exhibiting strong blue shift. They were definitely headed toward the inner solar system. Task Group 40 had been on this intercept heading for nearly eleven hours now at a speed of 0.2c, or two tenths the speed of light. It didnt feel like they were traversing over 37,000 Roman miles every second, but space was vast. They were burning their fuel at an excessive rate; even if they survived the engagement they wouldnt have sufficient reserves for a direct burn back to Neptuneor anywhere. The best they could hope for would be to insert themselves into a long parabolic descent towards Jupiter in the hopes that tankers from Titan would rendezvous with them. *If they survived.* Task Group 40, standby for engagement orders. Johannes tapped a control which transmitted the combat formation theyd be using along with a set of pre-programmed maneuvers and firing commands. Things would happen too quickly at the merge, and the resulting clash would be over in a fraction of a second. Humans simply couldnt react swiftly enough; it had to be left to the computers. After the merge, hed assess the resulting geometry, damage dealt to the enemy, and the damage status of his own force. Hed then calculate a re-engage vector to bring them back around for another pass. Both ships acknowledged receipt. He continued, Right now our combined closure rate is 0.44c, way too fast to get any hits. Four minutes prior to the merge, well execute a swing ship maneuver, and brake down to 0.1c. If the Formix keep going, well get more hits on them but will have a devil of a time catching them in a tail chase. If the bugs decelerate as well, then well have a good fight on our hands. Athanasius was back on the bridge, listening to Paulus as he finished his transmission. Sounds like a solid battle plan, Captain, except for one thing. Oh really? Paulus could not conceal his annoyance. Whats that? Im not sure that the bugs even *have* hands. The tension on the bridge broke as several of the watch guffawed out loud. Paulus made a pantomime of hurling his data tablet at his executive officer, his scowl momentarily lifting as he did so. #THE PRAESIDIUM, ROME. #0604 HOURS. The huge imaging array which orbited Earth at a distance of 300,000 miles fed a constant stream of imagery back to the command center as the photons arrived. Despite being the best optics mankind had at its disposal, the participants in a battle which had commenced hours earlier were images large enough to identify as ships and ascertain their general class, but lacked much more detail than that. Digital encrypted datalinks from each ship in Task Group 40, arriving concurrent with the optical information, filled in the rest of the story. As the two groups of specks plunged towards each other in the optical feed, the datalinks provided detailed information on the enemy fleet as well as the status of each ship. At the merge, the optical feed had suddenly become cluttered with numerous bright flashes of light. A heartbeat later, the two groups of specks were opening again. Instead of 9 Formic ships, there were now 7. An expanding cloud of debris marked all that remained of Task Group 40. The datalinks had failed before the onboard computers could compute and transmit any significant enemy battle damage assessment. The Tribune of the Watch stared at the displays. *Deus misereatur eorum*, he muttered, crossing himself. Regaining his composure he began the task of analyzing the engagement in an attempt to learn as much from the battle as could be determined. The others in the room turned from the display and regarded the togate man standing among them. Consul Tiberius Valerius Lupus had seen enough. Nodding to those around him, he exited the command center. Outside, a car waited to take him to the Senate house. Sirens blaring and lights flashing, the Praetorian motorcycle guard cleared the traffic ahead of him as his sedan sped toward the Capitoline Hill.",
        "story_a": "The cold light of distant stars glinted off the sleek, metallic hulls of the Roman warships as they carved through the void near Pluto. The flagship, *Imperator Augustus*, led the formation. Its bronze and steel exterior bore the scars of countless battles, each one a testament to the enduring might of the Roman Empire. The insignia of the Senate and the People of Rome (SPQR) was emblazoned proudly on its side, a symbol of unbroken legacy and indomitable power.\n\nInside the command deck, the air buzzed with a tense hum. Centurion Lucius Marcellus stood at the helm, his chiseled features cast in the harsh light of the control panels. His eyes, sharp and calculating, scanned the holographic display before him. It showed the approaching alien fleet, an ominous swarm of unfamiliar vessels that dwarfed the Roman task group both in number and size.\n\n\"Status report,\" Lucius barked, his voice cutting through the murmured conversations of his officers.\n\nTribune Aelia Varro stepped forward, her expression as disciplined as her meticulously maintained uniform. \"The alien fleet is closing in, sir. Our scans indicate they have advanced shielding and weaponry far superior to our own. Estimated time to contact: fifteen minutes.\"\n\nLucius nodded, his mind racing. The Senate had dispatched them with little information, only a direct order to intercept and assess the alien threat. The task group, comprised of the *Imperator Augustus* and four smaller warships, was all that stood between the unknown intruders and the heart of Roman space.\n\n\"Prepare the ships for battle,\" he commanded. \"Activate all defensive systems and prime the weapon arrays.\"\n\nAs the crew moved with practiced efficiency, Lucius turned his gaze to the viewport. Beyond the cold expanse of space, Pluto's icy surface glimmered faintly, a silent witness to the impending conflict. He couldn't help but feel a pang of unease. The Roman Empire had faced countless enemies over the millennia, but this... this was different. The unknown was a foe they had yet to conquer.\n\nAelia's voice broke through his thoughts. \"Sir, incoming transmission from the alien fleet.\"\n\nLucius straightened, his eyes narrowing. \"Patch it through.\"\n\nThe holographic display flickered, then stabilized, revealing an alien figure. Its appearance was unlike anything Lucius had ever seen, with elongated limbs, a sleek, angular face, and eyes that glowed with an eerie luminescence. The creature spoke in a language that was at once melodic and unsettling, its words translated into Latin by the ship's advanced communication systems.\n\n\"Roman vessels, you are trespassing in our territory. Withdraw immediately, or face annihilation.\"\n\nLucius took a step forward, his voice steady and resolute. \"This is Centurion Lucius Marcellus of the Roman Empire. We are here to defend our space and our people. We will not retreat.\"\n\nThe alien's eyes seemed to bore into him, assessing, calculating. \"Your resistance is futile. Your empire is no match for our technology. This is your final warning.\"\n\nThe transmission ended abruptly, leaving a heavy silence in its wake. Lucius turned to Aelia, who met his gaze with unwavering determination.\n\n\"We fight,\" she said simply.\n\nLucius nodded. \"We fight.\"\n\nThe next few minutes passed in a blur of activity. Orders were given and executed with military precision, the crew moving as one cohesive unit. Lucius could feel the tension mounting, a palpable energy that thrummed through the ship. He took a deep breath, steeling himself for the battle to come.\n\nThe alien fleet loomed closer, their ships a dark, menacing presence against the backdrop of stars. The Romans held their formation, the *Imperator Augustus* at the forefront, its weapons primed and ready.\n\n\"All ships, fire at will,\" Lucius commanded, his voice ringing with authority.\n\nThe Roman warships unleashed a barrage of missiles and laser fire, their weapons lighting up the darkness of space. The alien vessels responded in kind, their advanced weaponry cutting through the void with deadly precision. The battle was fierce and unrelenting, a chaotic dance of destruction and survival.\n\nExplosions rocked the *Imperator Augustus*, the hull shuddering under the impact. Lucius gripped the edge of the control panel, his knuckles white. He could see the damage reports flooding in, the ship's systems struggling to keep up with the onslaught.\n\n\"Centurion, we're taking heavy fire!\" Aelia shouted over the din.\n\n\"Maintain formation!\" Lucius ordered. \"We cannot afford to break ranks.\"\n\nThe smaller Roman ships darted and weaved, their agility a stark contrast to the hulking alien vessels. They struck with precision, targeting weak points and exploiting vulnerabilities. But the aliens were relentless, their technology far surpassing anything the Romans had encountered.\n\nA sudden explosion rocked the ship, sending Lucius sprawling to the floor. He scrambled to his feet, his ears ringing. The command deck was a scene of chaos, smoke and sparks filling the air.\n\n\"Damage report!\" he demanded.\n\nAelia's voice was strained but steady. \"Shields are failing, and we've lost primary weapons control. Hull integrity is compromised.\"\n\nLucius clenched his jaw. They were outmatched and outgunned, their chances of victory slim. But retreat was not an option. The Senate awaited news of their fate, and the honor of Rome was at stake.\n\n\"Prepare for boarding action,\" he said, his voice grim. \"If we cannot defeat them in space, we will take the fight to them.\"\n\nThe crew moved with urgency, donning their exosuits and arming themselves with blasters and plasma swords. Lucius led the way, his heart pounding. The corridors of the *Imperator Augustus* were filled with the sounds of battle, the ship's systems straining under the relentless assault.\n\nThey reached the airlock, the hatch opening with a hiss. Beyond it, the alien vessel loomed, its sleek, angular design a stark contrast to the Roman warship. Lucius took a deep breath, his resolve hardening.\n\n\"For Rome,\" he said, and stepped into the void.\n\nThe boarding party launched themselves across the gap, their exosuits propelling them toward the alien ship. They landed with a jolt, their magnetic boots securing them to the hull. Lucius led the charge, his blaster at the ready.\n\nThe interior of the alien vessel was a labyrinth of smooth, metallic corridors, the air filled with an eerie hum. The Romans moved cautiously, their weapons trained on every shadow. They encountered little resistance at first, the corridors eerily empty.\n\nBut as they advanced deeper into the ship, the aliens struck. They emerged from hidden alcoves and shadowed corners, their weapons blazing. The Romans fought with fierce determination, their training and discipline giving them an edge.\n\nLucius moved with the precision of a seasoned warrior, his blaster cutting down alien after alien. Aelia was at his side, her plasma sword a blur of deadly light. They pressed forward, their goal the ship's control center.\n\nThe battle raged on, the corridors echoing with the sounds of combat. The Romans fought with everything they had, their determination fueled by the knowledge that their empire depended on them.\n\nFinally, they reached the control center. The doors slid open, revealing a room filled with alien technology. At its center stood the alien leader, its eyes glowing with a fierce intelligence.\n\nLucius raised his blaster, his voice ringing with authority. \"Surrender, and your lives will be spared.\"\n\nThe alien leader regarded him with a cold, calculating gaze. \"You fight bravely, Roman. But you are too late. Our fleet will overwhelm your empire. Your resistance is futile.\"\n\nLucius stepped forward, his blaster trained on the alien. \"We will never surrender. Rome will never fall.\"\n\nThe alien leader's eyes narrowed, and for a moment, Lucius saw something akin to respect in its gaze. Then, with a swift motion, the alien activated a control panel.\n\n\"Farewell, Roman,\" it said, and the room erupted in a blinding light.\n\nLucius felt a searing pain, and then darkness claimed him.\n\nWhen he awoke, he was back on the *Imperator Augustus*, the ship's medics hovering over him. The battle was over, the alien fleet retreating. They had survived, but at a great cost.\n\nLucius sat up, his body aching. Aelia stood beside him, her expression weary but determined.\n\n\"We did it,\" she said softly. \"We held the line.\"\n\nLucius nodded, a sense of grim satisfaction settling over him. They had faced impossible odds and emerged victorious. The Senate would hear of their bravery, and the Roman Empire would endure.\n\nBut as he looked out at the cold expanse of space, he couldn't shake the feeling that this was only the beginning. The alien threat was far from over, and the future of the empire was uncertain.\n\nFor now, though, they had won. And that was enough.\n\n\"Set course for home,\" Lucius ordered, his voice steady. \"We have a victory to report.\"\n\nThe *Imperator Augustus* turned, its engines flaring to life. The Roman warships began their journey back to the heart of the empire, their spirits lifted by the hard-fought victory.\n\nAs they sailed through the stars, Lucius knew that the challenges ahead would be great. But with the strength and determination of Rome behind them, they would face whatever came next.\n\nFor the glory of Rome, and the future of the empire.",
        "story_b": "**I. IMPERIUM ROMANUM, SENATE CHAMBER, EARTH.**\n\nUnder the grand arches and splendid frescoes of the Roman Senate chamber, shadows danced across the marble columns, echoing the whispers of history. Senator Marcus Aurelius Verus sat in quiet contemplation, his gaze fixed on the mosaic of Jupiter overseeing the fate of mortals. The empire, vast and sprawling among the stars, now faced an existential threat. The whispers of an alien fleet, unknown and potentially hostile, had reached even the furthest corners of the empire. It was at moments like these that Verus pondered the weight of his office: to safeguard the empire's legacy and its future.\n\n\"Senator Verus,\" called a voice, interrupting his reverie. It was Senator Flavia, her features sharp and her tone urgent. \"The debate is about to commence. We must present a united front. The people need reassurance, especially with General Galerius's fleet heading to the outer rim.\"\n\nVerus nodded solemnly. \"Indeed, Flavia. But unity must not silence caution. We must understand what Galerius will find near Pluto before we can promise safety to our citizens.\"\n\nAs the senators took their places, Verus allowed himself a moment of introspection. The empire had thrived through millennia, its legions now patrolling the cosmos instead of the provinces of old Earth. Yet the principles remained unchanged: duty, honor, and sacrifice. \"In nomine Imperii,\" he whispered to himself, as the session began.\n\n**II. ABOARD THE FLAGSHIP *IMPERATOR AUGUSTUS*, NEAR PLUTO.**\n\nThe *Imperator Augustus* cut through the void with the precision of a gladius, her hull adorned with intricate mosaics of past victories. At the helm stood General Decimus Galerius, a man of experience and unwavering resolve. The cold metal of his armor was a comforting weight, a reminder of his duty to the empire and to his men.\n\n\"General,\" called Centurion Titus, interrupting Galerius's silent meditation. \"Our scouts report that the alien fleet has altered its trajectory. They are vectoring towards us. Estimated time to engagement: 30 minutes.\"\n\nGalerius glanced at the tactical display, the glowing dots representing both his task group and the approaching alien vessels. \"Prepare the men,\" he commanded. \"We may be outnumbered, but we are Romans. We will show them the might of the empire.\"\n\nThe general's mind was a whirl of strategic calculations and memories of past battles. He knew each decision he made would ripple through time, affecting not just the men under his command, but the entire empire. Yet, as always, his resolve was unwavering. \"This is our Rubicon,\" he thought. \"And I shall not falter.\"\n\n**III. SENATE CHAMBER, EARTH.**\n\n\"The empire is on the brink of a new era,\" Senator Verus announced, his voice echoing through the hallowed chamber. \"We face an unknown adversary at the edge of our dominion. We must stand resolute, for our ancestors who laid the foundations of this great empire, and for our descendants who shall inherit it.\"\n\nThe chamber was a sea of murmurs and nods, the senators weighing the gravity of the situation. Flavia rose to speak, her voice cutting through the tension like a clarion call. \"Let us not forget the courage of General Galerius and his men. They are the shield of our empire, and we must honor their sacrifice.\"\n\nAs the debate continued, Verus's mind wandered to the far reaches of the solar system, to the brave souls aboard the *Imperator Augustus*. In the end, he knew, it was not the Senate's words but the actions of those men that would decide the empire's fate.\n\n**IV. ABOARD THE FLAGSHIP *IMPERATOR AUGUSTUS*, NEAR PLUTO.**\n\n\"Enemy vessels detected,\" Centurion Titus reported. \"Shields at 70% capacity. Weapons systems primed.\"\n\nGeneral Galerius stood at the center of the command deck, his eyes fixed on the holographic display of the alien fleet. The tension in the room was palpable, yet the air crackled with determination. \"Initiate evasive maneuvers,\" he ordered. \"Prepare for engagement.\"\n\nThe *Imperator Augustus* moved with the grace of a seasoned gladiator, her engines roaring as she prepared to face the alien threat. Galerius allowed himself a fleeting moment of pride in his crew, their loyalty and skill as unwavering as his own resolve.\n\n\"General,\" Titus's voice broke through the silence. \"The enemy's technology is unlike anything we've encountered. Their weapons\u2014\"\n\n\"Steady, Titus,\" Galerius interrupted, his voice calm and commanding. \"Remember, we are Romans. We do not yield to fear.\"\n\nThe first volley of alien fire lit up the darkness, a cascade of energy that danced across the *Imperator Augustus's* shields. Galerius watched, his mind racing with calculations and countermeasures. \"Return fire,\" he ordered, his voice a steely edge. \"Show them our strength.\"\n\nAs the battle unfolded, Galerius's thoughts turned inward, to the legacy of the empire and his place within it. He thought of the Senate, of Verus and the others, waiting for news of their fate. \"In nomine Imperii,\" he whispered once more, feeling the weight of millennia upon his shoulders.\n\n**V. SENATE CHAMBER, EARTH.**\n\nSenator Verus stood at the center of the chamber, his mind a whirl of anticipation and dread. News from the outer rim was scarce, and the weight of the empire's gaze was heavy upon him. The fate of the fleet, and indeed the empire itself, hung in the balance.\n\nAs the senators debated and argued, Verus's thoughts returned to Galerius and his men, fighting valiantly at the edge of Roman space. \"May the gods watch over them,\" he murmured, a silent prayer for their safety and success.\n\n**VI. ABOARD THE FLAGSHIP *IMPERATOR AUGUSTUS*, NEAR PLUTO.**\n\nThe battle raged on, the *Imperator Augustus* and her sister ships locked in a deadly dance with the alien fleet. General Galerius stood firm, his mind a fortress of strategy and resolve. The odds were stacked against them, yet he refused to yield.\n\n\"General,\" Titus called out, his voice strained but determined. \"Our shields are failing. We cannot withstand another direct hit.\"\n\nGalerius nodded, his mind racing with possibilities. \"Prepare for a tactical withdrawal,\" he commanded, his decision as swift as it was calculated. \"We must regroup and assess their capabilities. We cannot afford to lose our ships here.\"\n\nAs the *Imperator Augustus* maneuvered away from the heart of the battle, Galerius's thoughts turned to the future. \"This is not a defeat,\" he reminded himself. \"This is a test of our resolve. We will learn from this, and we will prevail.\"\n\n**VII. SENATE CHAMBER, EARTH.**\n\nSenator Verus sat in silence, the weight of the empire's fate pressing down upon him. The Senate was a sea of speculation and uncertainty, the fate of the fleet unknown. Yet, in his heart, Verus held onto hope.\n\n\"The empire has faced many trials,\" he thought, his mind a tapestry of history and legacy. \"And we have always emerged stronger. This shall be no different.\"\n\nAs the Senate session drew to a close, Verus rose to speak, his voice a beacon of resolve. \"We are Romans,\" he declared, his words a rallying cry. \"We shall face whatever challenges come our way, and we shall triumph. For the glory of the empire, and for the future of all who call it home.\"\n\n**VIII. ABOARD THE FLAGSHIP *IMPERATOR AUGUSTUS*, NEAR PLUTO.**\n\nGeneral Galerius stood on the command deck, his gaze fixed on the stars. The battle had been fierce, yet the *Imperator Augustus* and her crew had survived. They had faced the unknown and emerged stronger for it.\n\n\"General,\" Titus said, his voice filled with respect and admiration. \"The men are ready for your orders.\"\n\nGalerius nodded, his mind clear and focused. \"We will regroup and prepare for the next encounter,\" he declared. \"We have much to learn, but we are Romans. And we shall not be defeated.\"\n\nAs the *Imperator Augustus* turned away from the battlefield, Galerius's thoughts turned to the future. The empire had been tested, and it would be tested again. But he knew, with unwavering certainty, that they would endure.\n\n**IX. SENATE CHAMBER, EARTH.**\n\nSenator Verus stood before the Senate, his mind a tapestry of hope and determination. The news from the outer rim had finally arrived: the fleet had survived, and the empire's future was secure.\n\n\"We have faced the unknown,\" Verus declared, his voice a chorus of triumph. \"And we have emerged victorious. Let this be a reminder to us all: the empire shall endure, no matter the challenges we face.\"\n\nAs the Senate erupted in cheers, Verus allowed himself a moment of reflection. The empire's legacy was secure, and its future was bright. \"In nomine Imperii,\" he thought, a silent vow to continue the work of those who had come before him.\n\nAnd so, under the watchful gaze of Jupiter, the Roman Empire continued its journey among the stars, its destiny intertwined with the vastness of the cosmos.",

Very few believed in the old religion of Republican Rome, lost in the mists of time before it had become the City of Peter and Paul. *First to the Pearly Gates* would have been a far more apt description, but the old vernacular had held on in Roman speech, even if the old pagan religion had faded. Selecting the *Loqui Inter Naves* (Talk Between Ships, or TBS), he waited a moment for the other two captains to join him on the circuit. Why do you think theyre here, Primus? In their minds, are they continuing the previous war, or has some genius at Proxima Centauri or beyond managed to kick open their anthill again? Athanasius shrugged. Ill make one last inspection of the weapons crews. Make sure theyre in fighting trim. Make it quick, Paulus said after him as he exited the bridge. Pressing the transmit button on TBS, he said, All ships, Task Group 40, this is *Sicilia,* over. *Liguria*, over. *Cisalpina,* over. *Sicilia,* the fifth ship in the *Trireme* class, was accompanied by two smaller *Bireme* class ships, the *Liguria* and *Cisalpina.* His task group was a versatile mix of ships well-suited to picket duty, but against a large force like this one, they had little chance of success. The task group was off-station, headed for a scheduled refueling evolution at Orbital Station Neptune, and had been just an hour away from docking when their sensors had picked up light announcing the arrival of the Formic fleet. There wasnt supposed to be a jump point in that portion of the Kuiper belt, so it hadnt been actively patrolled. They had already been in the Sol system three hours before Task Group 40 was even aware they were here. Paulus had turned the group around as soon as they had received the sensor data. Nine ships exhibiting strong blue shift. They were definitely headed toward the inner solar system. Task Group 40 had been on this intercept heading for nearly eleven hours now at a speed of 0.2c, or two tenths the speed of light. It didnt feel like they were traversing over 37,000 Roman miles every second, but space was vast. They were burning their fuel at an excessive rate; even if they survived the engagement they wouldnt have sufficient reserves for a direct burn back to Neptuneor anywhere. The best they could hope for would be to insert themselves into a long parabolic descent towards Jupiter in the hopes that tankers from Titan would rendezvous with them. *If they survived.* Task Group 40, standby for engagement orders. Johannes tapped a control which transmitted the combat formation theyd be using along with a set of pre-programmed maneuvers and firing commands. Things would happen too quickly at the merge, and the resulting clash would be over in a fraction of a second. Humans simply couldnt react swiftly enough; it had to be left to the computers. After the merge, hed assess the resulting geometry, damage dealt to the enemy, and the damage status of his own force. Hed then calculate a re-engage vector to bring them back around for another pass. Both ships acknowledged receipt. He continued, Right now our combined closure rate is 0.44c, way too fast to get any hits. Four minutes prior to the merge, well execute a swing ship maneuver, and brake down to 0.1c. If the Formix keep going, well get more hits on them but will have a devil of a time catching them in a tail chase. If the bugs decelerate as well, then well have a good fight on our hands. Athanasius was back on the bridge, listening to Paulus as he finished his transmission. Sounds like a solid battle plan, Captain, except for one thing. Oh really? Paulus could not conceal his annoyance. Whats that? Im not sure that the bugs even *have* hands. The tension on the bridge broke as several of the watch guffawed out loud. Paulus made a pantomime of hurling his data tablet at his executive officer, his scowl momentarily lifting as he did so. #THE PRAESIDIUM, ROME. #0604 HOURS. The huge imaging array which orbited Earth at a distance of 300,000 miles fed a constant stream of imagery back to the command center as the photons arrived. Despite being the best optics mankind had at its disposal, the participants in a battle which had commenced hours earlier were images large enough to identify as ships and ascertain their general class, but lacked much more detail than that. Digital encrypted datalinks from each ship in Task Group 40, arriving concurrent with the optical information, filled in the rest of the story. As the two groups of specks plunged towards each other in the optical feed, the datalinks provided detailed information on the enemy fleet as well as the status of each ship. At the merge, the optical feed had suddenly become cluttered with numerous bright flashes of light. A heartbeat later, the two groups of specks were opening again. Instead of 9 Formic ships, there were now 7. An expanding cloud of debris marked all that remained of Task Group 40. The datalinks had failed before the onboard computers could compute and transmit any significant enemy battle damage assessment. The Tribune of the Watch stared at the displays. *Deus misereatur eorum*, he muttered, crossing himself. Regaining his composure he began the task of analyzing the engagement in an attempt to learn as much from the battle as could be determined. The others in the room turned from the display and regarded the togate man standing among them. Consul Tiberius Valerius Lupus had seen enough. Nodding to those around him, he exited the command center. Outside, a car waited to take him to the Senate house. Sirens blaring and lights flashing, the Praetorian motorcycle guard cleared the traffic ahead of him as his sedan sped toward the Capitoline Hill.",
        "story_a": "The cold light of distant stars glinted off the sleek, metallic hulls of the Roman warships as they carved through the void near Pluto. The flagship, *Imperator Augustus*, led the formation. Its bronze and steel exterior bore the scars of countless battles, each one a testament to the enduring might of the Roman Empire. The insignia of the Senate and the People of Rome (SPQR) was emblazoned proudly on its side, a symbol of unbroken legacy and indomitable power.\n\nInside the command deck, the air buzzed with a tense hum. Centurion Lucius Marcellus stood at the helm, his chiseled features cast in the harsh light of the control panels. His eyes, sharp and calculating, scanned the holographic display before him. It showed the approaching alien fleet, an ominous swarm of unfamiliar vessels that dwarfed the Roman task group both in number and size.\n\n\"Status report,\" Lucius barked, his voice cutting through the murmured conversations of his officers.\n\nTribune Aelia Varro stepped forward, her expression as disciplined as her meticulously maintained uniform. \"The alien fleet is closing in, sir. Our scans indicate they have advanced shielding and weaponry far superior to our own. Estimated time to contact: fifteen minutes.\"\n\nLucius nodded, his mind racing. The Senate had dispatched them with little information, only a direct order to intercept and assess the alien threat. The task group, comprised of the *Imperator Augustus* and four smaller warships, was all that stood between the unknown intruders and the heart of Roman space.\n\n\"Prepare the ships for battle,\" he commanded. \"Activate all defensive systems and prime the weapon arrays.\"\n\nAs the crew moved with practiced efficiency, Lucius turned his gaze to the viewport. Beyond the cold expanse of space, Pluto's icy surface glimmered faintly, a silent witness to the impending conflict. He couldn't help but feel a pang of unease. The Roman Empire had faced countless enemies over the millennia, but this... this was different. The unknown was a foe they had yet to conquer.\n\nAelia's voice broke through his thoughts. \"Sir, incoming transmission from the alien fleet.\"\n\nLucius straightened, his eyes narrowing. \"Patch it through.\"\n\nThe holographic display flickered, then stabilized, revealing an alien figure. Its appearance was unlike anything Lucius had ever seen, with elongated limbs, a sleek, angular face, and eyes that glowed with an eerie luminescence. The creature spoke in a language that was at once melodic and unsettling, its words translated into Latin by the ship's advanced communication systems.\n\n\"Roman vessels, you are trespassing in our territory. Withdraw immediately, or face annihilation.\"\n\nLucius took a step forward, his voice steady and resolute. \"This is Centurion Lucius Marcellus of the Roman Empire. We are here to defend our space and our people. We will not retreat.\"\n\nThe alien's eyes seemed to bore into him, assessing, calculating. \"Your resistance is futile. Your empire is no match for our technology. This is your final warning.\"\n\nThe transmission ended abruptly, leaving a heavy silence in its wake. Lucius turned to Aelia, who met his gaze with unwavering determination.\n\n\"We fight,\" she said simply.\n\nLucius nodded. \"We fight.\"\n\nThe next few minutes passed in a blur of activity. Orders were given and executed with military precision, the crew moving as one cohesive unit. Lucius could feel the tension mounting, a palpable energy that thrummed through the ship. He took a deep breath, steeling himself for the battle to come.\n\nThe alien fleet loomed closer, their ships a dark, menacing presence against the backdrop of stars. The Romans held their formation, the *Imperator Augustus* at the forefront, its weapons primed and ready.\n\n\"All ships, fire at will,\" Lucius commanded, his voice ringing with authority.\n\nThe Roman warships unleashed a barrage of missiles and laser fire, their weapons lighting up the darkness of space. The alien vessels responded in kind, their advanced weaponry cutting through the void with deadly precision. The battle was fierce and unrelenting, a chaotic dance of destruction and survival.\n\nExplosions rocked the *Imperator Augustus*, the hull shuddering under the impact. Lucius gripped the edge of the control panel, his knuckles white. He could see the damage reports flooding in, the ship's systems struggling to keep up with the onslaught.\n\n\"Centurion, we're taking heavy fire!\" Aelia shouted over the din.\n\n\"Maintain formation!\" Lucius ordered. \"We cannot afford to break ranks.\"\n\nThe smaller Roman ships darted and weaved, their agility a stark contrast to the hulking alien vessels. They struck with precision, targeting weak points and exploiting vulnerabilities. But the aliens were relentless, their technology far surpassing anything the Romans had encountered.\n\nA sudden explosion rocked the ship, sending Lucius sprawling to the floor. He scrambled to his feet, his ears ringing. The command deck was a scene of chaos, smoke and sparks filling the air.\n\n\"Damage report!\" he demanded.\n\nAelia's voice was strained but steady. \"Shields are failing, and we've lost primary weapons control. Hull integrity is compromised.\"\n\nLucius clenched his jaw. They were outmatched and outgunned, their chances of victory slim. But retreat was not an option. The Senate awaited news of their fate, and the honor of Rome was at stake.\n\n\"Prepare for boarding action,\" he said, his voice grim. \"If we cannot defeat them in space, we will take the fight to them.\"\n\nThe crew moved with urgency, donning their exosuits and arming themselves with blasters and plasma swords. Lucius led the way, his heart pounding. The corridors of the *Imperator Augustus* were filled with the sounds of battle, the ship's systems straining under the relentless assault.\n\nThey reached the airlock, the hatch opening with a hiss. Beyond it, the alien vessel loomed, its sleek, angular design a stark contrast to the Roman warship. Lucius took a deep breath, his resolve hardening.\n\n\"For Rome,\" he said, and stepped into the void.\n\nThe boarding party launched themselves across the gap, their exosuits propelling them toward the alien ship. They landed with a jolt, their magnetic boots securing them to the hull. Lucius led the charge, his blaster at the ready.\n\nThe interior of the alien vessel was a labyrinth of smooth, metallic corridors, the air filled with an eerie hum. The Romans moved cautiously, their weapons trained on every shadow. They encountered little resistance at first, the corridors eerily empty.\n\nBut as they advanced deeper into the ship, the aliens struck. They emerged from hidden alcoves and shadowed corners, their weapons blazing. The Romans fought with fierce determination, their training and discipline giving them an edge.\n\nLucius moved with the precision of a seasoned warrior, his blaster cutting down alien after alien. Aelia was at his side, her plasma sword a blur of deadly light. They pressed forward, their goal the ship's control center.\n\nThe battle raged on, the corridors echoing with the sounds of combat. The Romans fought with everything they had, their determination fueled by the knowledge that their empire depended on them.\n\nFinally, they reached the control center. The doors slid open, revealing a room filled with alien technology. At its center stood the alien leader, its eyes glowing with a fierce intelligence.\n\nLucius raised his blaster, his voice ringing with authority. \"Surrender, and your lives will be spared.\"\n\nThe alien leader regarded him with a cold, calculating gaze. \"You fight bravely, Roman. But you are too late. Our fleet will overwhelm your empire. Your resistance is futile.\"\n\nLucius stepped forward, his blaster trained on the alien. \"We will never surrender. Rome will never fall.\"\n\nThe alien leader's eyes narrowed, and for a moment, Lucius saw something akin to respect in its gaze. Then, with a swift motion, the alien activated a control panel.\n\n\"Farewell, Roman,\" it said, and the room erupted in a blinding light.\n\nLucius felt a searing pain, and then darkness claimed him.\n\nWhen he awoke, he was back on the *Imperator Augustus*, the ship's medics hovering over him. The battle was over, the alien fleet retreating. They had survived, but at a great cost.\n\nLucius sat up, his body aching. Aelia stood beside him, her expression weary but determined.\n\n\"We did it,\" she said softly. \"We held the line.\"\n\nLucius nodded, a sense of grim satisfaction settling over him. They had faced impossible odds and emerged victorious. The Senate would hear of their bravery, and the Roman Empire would endure.\n\nBut as he looked out at the cold expanse of space, he couldn't shake the feeling that this was only the beginning. The alien threat was far from over, and the future of the empire was uncertain.\n\nFor now, though, they had won. And that was enough.\n\n\"Set course for home,\" Lucius ordered, his voice steady. \"We have a victory to report.\"\n\nThe *Imperator Augustus* turned, its engines flaring to life. The Roman warships began their journey back to the heart of the empire, their spirits lifted by the hard-fought victory.\n\nAs they sailed through the stars, Lucius knew that the challenges ahead would be great. But with the strength and determination of Rome behind them, they would face whatever came next.\n\nFor the glory of Rome, and the future of the empire.",
        "story_b": "**Chapter I: The Approach.**\n\nThe vastness of space lay before them, an eternal expanse of cold darkness punctuated by distant stars. Out here, near the dwarf planet Pluto, the cosmos felt even more desolate, a realm untouched by the light of the sun. It was in this inhospitable frontier that the task group \"Imperial Legions,\" under the command of Consul Marcus Fabius Maximus, was en route to intercept an enigmatic alien fleet. The Senate back on Terra waited with bated breath, their communications silent and watchful.\n\nInside the lead warship, *Imperator Augustus*, the tension was palpable. The Consul stood tall on the bridge, his armor gleaming under the artificial lights, a relic of Roman tradition blended seamlessly with the advanced technology of the Empire. His eyes, sharp and calculating, scanned the holographic display that projected the approaching alien vessels\u2014a formation of dark silhouettes, their technology unknown and their intentions unclear.\n\n\"Centurion Decimus, report,\" Maximus commanded, his voice steady and authoritative.\n\nThe seasoned centurion, Decimus Junius Brutus, stepped forward, his face etched with lines of experience and duty. \"Consul, the alien fleet maintains its course. They outnumber us five to one, with energy signatures suggesting weaponry far beyond our understanding. Our scouts have detected cloaking devices, making it difficult to ascertain their full strength.\"\n\nMaximus nodded, absorbing the information. \"And our task group?\"\n\n\"All ships report readiness, Consul. The *Imperator Augustus* leads, with *Legatus* and *Praetorian* flanking us. The men are prepared for engagement, though morale wanes in the face of such odds,\" Brutus replied, his voice a mixture of pride and underlying concern.\n\n\"By the gods, we stand firm,\" Maximus declared, his gaze sweeping over the bridge crew. \"This is not merely a battle for survival, but a testament to the strength and endurance of the Roman Empire. Remember your duty, and let no fear cloud your hearts.\"\n\nThe crew responded with a resounding \"Ave Imperator,\" their resolve solidified by the Consul's words. In the face of the unknown, their unity was their greatest strength.\n\n**Chapter II: The Briefing.**\n\nAs the task group closed in on the alien fleet, Maximus convened a briefing with his senior officers. The chamber was a fusion of ancient Roman architecture and futuristic design, marble columns contrasting with holographic displays that filled the air with tactical data.\n\nOptio Lucius Aurelius, a young engineer with a mind as sharp as his wit, began his report. \"Consul, our sensors indicate that the alien ships utilize some form of energy-based weaponry. The energy signatures are unlike anything in our archives. They could potentially disrupt our shields and hull integrity.\"\n\nMaximus considered this, his mind racing through possible strategies. \"Suggestions?\"\n\nLucius adjusted his stance, enthusiasm tempered by the gravity of their situation. \"We could use the asteroid field near Pluto as cover, Consul. It might provide us with a tactical advantage, allowing us to approach undetected.\"\n\nCenturion Decimus interjected, \"A sound plan, but it requires precise maneuvering. Our pilots must be at their best.\"\n\nMaximus nodded, weighing the risks and rewards. \"Very well. We shall use the asteroid field to our advantage. Prepare the fleet for evasive maneuvers. Centurion, ensure the pilots are briefed and ready.\"\n\nAs the officers departed to carry out their orders, Maximus lingered, his thoughts drifting back to the Senate on Terra. They had entrusted him with this mission, a task that could determine the fate of the Empire's expansion into the stars. Failure was not an option.\n\n**Chapter III: The Encounter.**\n\nThe task group slipped into the asteroid field, the massive rocks drifting silently through the void, casting shadows that danced across the hulls of the Roman warships. The crew held their breath as the ships weaved between the asteroids, engines humming with restrained power.\n\nMaximus stood at the helm, eyes fixed on the sensors. \"Steady, steady,\" he murmured, more to himself than anyone else. The alien fleet loomed ahead, a dark mass against the backdrop of stars.\n\n\"Consul, we're within range,\" Centurion Decimus announced, his voice low and tense.\n\n\"Prepare for engagement,\" Maximus commanded, his tone unyielding. \"All ships, execute the plan.\"\n\nThe Roman warships surged forward, emerging from the asteroid field with a suddenness that caught the alien fleet off guard. Energy beams lanced out from the *Imperator Augustus*, striking the nearest alien ship with precise fury.\n\nThe alien vessels responded, their weapons lighting up the darkness with bursts of incandescent energy. The Roman ships weaved and darted, using their maneuverability to evade the worst of the assault. But the enemy was relentless, their tactics unpredictable and their technology formidable.\n\nOn the bridge of the *Imperator Augustus*, the tension was a living thing, vibrating through the air. Maximus barked orders, directing the fleet with a strategist's precision. \"Focus fire on their flanks. Break their formation. By the gods, we will not falter.\"\n\nThe battle raged, a symphony of destruction played out against the canvas of space. Roman ships took damage, their hulls scarred by alien fire. Yet they pressed on, driven by the unyielding will of their Consul.\n\n**Chapter IV: The Sacrifice.**\n\nAs the conflict wore on, it became clear that the alien fleet's strength was overwhelming. For every ship the Romans disabled, two more seemed to take its place. The task group was being pushed to its limits, their numbers dwindling as the battle continued.\n\nIn a moment of clarity, Maximus realized the only way to turn the tide. \"Centurion Decimus, prepare to execute the Scorched Earth protocol,\" he ordered, his voice a grim testament to the decision he had made.\n\nDecimus hesitated, understanding the weight of the command. The Scorched Earth protocol was a last resort, a self-destruct sequence designed to take out as many enemies as possible in a final, devastating explosion.\n\n\"Consul, are you certain?\" Decimus asked, his loyalty battling with the instinct for self-preservation.\n\nMaximus met his gaze, unwavering. \"It is the only way. The Empire must be protected at all costs. Transmit my orders to the fleet.\"\n\nWith a nod, Decimus relayed the command. Across the Roman ships, the crew prepared for their final act of defiance. There was no fear, only the resolute acceptance of their duty.\n\nAs the alien fleet closed in, the Roman warships began their final charge, engines burning with the fury of a cornered beast. Energy beams and missiles flew in every direction, a last, desperate attempt to break the enemy lines.\n\n**Chapter V: The Uncertain Fate.**\n\nThe *Imperator Augustus* shuddered under the strain, alarms blaring as systems failed and fires broke out. Maximus stood firm, watching as the alien fleet loomed ever closer.\n\n\"By the gods, let this be enough,\" he whispered, a prayer to the ancient deities who had watched over Rome for millennia.\n\nThe Scorched Earth protocol activated, and the Roman ships erupted in a cascade of light and fire, a brilliant supernova that consumed everything in its path. The alien fleet, caught in the inferno, was torn apart, their cloaking devices and energy weapons no match for the raw power unleashed by the Romans.\n\nAs the light faded, the emptiness of space reclaimed the battlefield. The task group was gone, their sacrifice a testament to the resilience and tenacity of the Roman Empire.\n\nBack on Terra, the Senate waited, their screens dark and silent. The fate of the task group remained unknown, a question mark hanging over the Empire's expansion into the stars. Yet in the hearts of those who served, there was no doubt. They had faced the impossible and stood firm, their legacy written in the stars.\n\nAnd so, the Empire endured, its reach extending ever further into the cosmos, driven by the indomitable spirit of its people\u2014a spirit that would never fall.",

Under the brim of her straw hat her eyes are like peas in aspic. She has a dishcloth tucked into a pocket of her jeans. Georgia has never been married, but she is a better version of the wife I used to be. Her grocery lists say six damask plums where I would write fruit.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she says, taking the screen out of the window. \u201cI\u2019ll be gone by the time they get here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d I kiss her hand.\n\n\u201cIf you want to thank me, invite me to dinner tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say, but we both know I won\u2019t.\n\n\nColt arrives in tight jeans and a bolo tie, his father\u2019s old typewriter in his arms. He sets it on the kitchen table.\n\n\u201cYou guys can take my room. And yes, I put in the air conditioner.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know how you live without it.\u201d He takes his shoes off before he goes upstairs. That was one of his father\u2019s rules.\n\nI hold the front door open for my daughter-in-law and her suitcase. Her red hair is in a pompadour, left over from last night\u2019s party. When she kisses my cheek I smell coconut pomade.\n\n\u201cI asked him not to bring that,\u201d Vivian says, looking at the typewriter. \u201cHe could use a few days off from work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you like some juice? I have orange and pineapple.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thanks. Too much sugar.\u201d Vivian, all hip bones and rib cage, is afraid of sugar.\n\nI wait until she is upstairs before addressing the typewriter.\n\n\u201cGet out,\u201d I tell the well-worn keys. \u201cGet out.\u201d\n\n\nNothing that belongs to Oliver is allowed in my house. When he left me I held a tag sale on my front lawn. The first days passed without a single prospect. People were shy. They knew Oliver as the man who spread fireplace ashes on icy steps. They remembered when he cleared the road of tree branches after a hurricane. But I knew I could trust a free market. Was I really selling that guitar for five dollars? I was.\n\nI met Georgia at my sale, over a canvas bag of my wedding china. She\u2019d moved to the neighborhood a year before, and I knew as much about her as did everyone else on our street: she was a spinster who\u2019d made an enormous web of pulled cotton to cover her front windows at Halloween, and at Christmas she left icebox cookies in our mailboxes. She was wearing a souvenir T-shirt from Hollywood, and between her breasts a giant palm tree waved its sequined fronds.\n\n\u201cHow much for the china?\u201d she\u2019d said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anything for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much?\u201d\n\n\u201cZero dollars and zero cents.\u201d\n\nShe picked up a tempered-glass paperweight shaped like an abalone shell. \u201cI\u2019ll give you five dollars for this, and no less than fifty for the china.\u201d\n\nI was drinking a beer, which I set aside to count her change. \u201cThis isn\u2019t how bargaining usually works,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m stealing something,\u201d she said.\n\n\nColt comes downstairs with a copy of his novel in his hands.\n\n\u201cFound this by the tub. How far are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI started it.\u201d I unwrap a rack of spareribs and set them on a baking sheet. I regret, for a moment, that I sold Oliver\u2019s grill for a dime.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re offended by the title. I knew you\u2019d be offended.\u201d\n\nHe sits at the table and props one foot on a chair. This makes me miss his childhood. I kiss the top of his head.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say, \u201cthough I guess slut isn\u2019t one of my favorite words.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t bother me that Colt\u2019s book is called The Confessions of Slut Twenty-Three; nor does it bother me that Slut Twenty-Three, in the pages I\u2019ve skimmed, physically resembles Vivian. If what he writes is taken from their lives, Vivian randomly demands sex in parking lots, makes Colt wear her hosiery, and runs a blow-job clinic in the smoking garden of a local bar.\n\nI am not offended by his pedantic diagrams of sexual positions, or by the character named Mlle Fuck-You. It\u2019s the shrill, smug voice he picked up in college that I can\u2019t stand. His narrator, The-Man-in-Love-with-the-Slut, describes himself as \u201cyour average spoiled white kid from the suburbs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not a \u2018white kid from the suburbs,\u2019 \u201d I want to tell him. \u201cYou\u2019re from a small town nowhere near a city. You were raised to treat people decently. And your father and I never spoiled you.\u201d But I know\u2014I know, I know\u2014that this is not an autobiography.\n\nI believe Colt when he tells me that in certain circles he is famous. Once I suggested that those circles might be concentrated in Brooklyn, and my throat closed with guilt the moment I said it. Colt is my delight; he is my only child. For nine months I prayed for the healthy heart now beating under his shirt. As soon as I could hold him, heart and all, I sensed the futility of prayer. I knew that every time he was hurt it would be my fault.\n\n\nThey smoked a joint right before dinner while I picked green beans from the garden. Colt\u2019s elbows are on the table. He tells us, several times, that he would love it if some backwoods library in the Deep South banned his book.\n\n\u201cEnough about you,\u201d Vivian says.\n\n\u201cOkay. Tell Mom about your new business idea,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe have this dog park near our building, and the people are ridiculous. They dress the dogs in little quilted jackets. They give them the same kinds of names they give their kids: Jordan, Mason, Hunter, Taylor.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo ridiculous,\u201d Colt says.\n\n\u201cAnyway, there\u2019s a multilingual school down the street from the park. I thought maybe people would be into a multilingual class for dogs. Not like they think the dog is going to speak, but so a dog can follow commands in three or four languages.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am, but I\u2019m not. I think if we charged $75 per session, we might convince some people it\u2019s worth paying for. So that might be my project for the next six months.\u201d The look they exchange tells me this joke has been broken in, and that every time she tells it, Colt is charmed.\n\n\u201cWhat about you, Mom?\u201d he says. \u201cWhat do you see yourself doing in the next six months?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe some camping up in Acadia before it gets too cold.\u201d Georgia and I have been planning this trip for months.\n\n\u201cBut who would go with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, who would go with you?\u201d\n\nThey give me a pitying look. They think I am alone, and they think they are invincible. Vivian has no visible reaction to Colt\u2019s hand on the back of her neck. This is the smugness of having your lover beside you all the time. I want to tell her that being loved this much leaves no mark. If Colt rises from the table, she will look as lonely as I do.\n\n\nSometimes I wish Colt would find the whole thing abhorrent. Two women? Disgusting. His own mother? Disgusting. If he could back away from it, maybe I could tell him. But Colt and Viv would levitate with pleasure. They\u2019d sit there thinking they\u2019d finally figured me out: there\u2019s Mom, Judith, clear as an egg wash, a classic closet case. Maybe she\u2019s been waiting for Georgia her whole life.\n\nSurely Colt remembers the traffic jam. A westbound lane on the Sagamore Bridge, a cup of rum-raisin ice cream in his hand, his head out the window to watch the Cape Cod Canal churning with rain, traces of zinc oxide on his nose. He was eleven. He asked his parents, \u201cHave either of you ever been in love?\u201d\n\nOliver had just given me opal earrings for my birthday, suffered a lobster dinner on my behalf.\n\n\u201cOf course, son,\u201d he said, reaching back to tousle his hair.\n\nI couldn\u2019t stop wondering why Colt would ask us that.\n\n\u201cHe asks why we can\u2019t take vacation on a different planet. He asks why we can\u2019t drink saltwater. I wouldn\u2019t worry about this,\u201d Oliver said.\n\nWe were in the yard, the grass freshly mowed, mosquitoes biting freely as dusk unraveled. It was a Saturday, the night Oliver was allowed to get drunk. Colt was at a friend\u2019s house, observing marriages that were apparently stronger than mine.\n\n\u201cGive me a priss, kitty,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cStop worrying.\u201d\n\nI worried even more after that.\n\n\nI can see it now: Georgia in a souvenir T-shirt, a shade overweight, telling stories as if we\u2019ve been married for years. The three of them teasing me for voting Republican. \u201cI always knew there was a liberal in there somewhere,\u201d Colt will say. They will need a little less from me, a little more from each other; I in turn will need a little more from all of them.\n\nThey\u2019ll have cocktail hour while I drink club soda with lime. Georgia will mix vodka and grenadine, even though I\u2019ve told her it\u2019s tacky. She doesn\u2019t mind being teased, and she doesn\u2019t know how to be jealous, two of my favorite things about her. She indulges me when I need to talk about my married life. She knows how many buttons I had on my wedding dress. She knows that Oliver and I spent our wedding night at the Pioneer Hotel, with its misplaced neoclassical columns. The windows were jalousies, and there was only one towel in the bathroom. There was a folding screen, and I\u2019d felt obliged to change behind it, even though we\u2019d seen each other naked many times.\n\n\nI call Vivian to the bathroom after my shower. She is pleased. This is the kind of thing daughters-in-law do: they enter intimate spaces unflinchingly.\n\n\u201cTake a look at this mole,\u201d I tell her, pulling my robe away from my breast. \u201cI swear I didn\u2019t have it this morning.\u201d\n\nShe excuses herself to get her glasses from her handbag.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a mole, Judith. That\u2019s a tick.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like a mole.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s in there pretty deep.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, shit,\u201d I say. \u201cCan you get it out?\u201d\n\nFirst she tries tweezers, which I keep on a mirrored tray by the sink.\n\n\u201cThis fucker\u2019s really in there,\u201d she says.\n\nMy eyes are watery, my head hot.\n\n\u201cDo you think I might already have Lyme disease?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d she says, the first hint of a mother I\u2019ve ever seen in her.\n\nWhen Vivian worries the tweezers are making it worse, she asks Colt to bring matches. There are holes in the knees of her jeans, and her fingernails are painted gold. She has a scar on her arm from breaking a window when her father refused to give her his credit card. (She was, she has assured me, only twenty-two at the time.) This is the girl who holds a flame close to my skin.\n\nWhen she finally gets the tick out without starting a fire, I offer her fifty dollars. \u201cAn investment in your multilingual dog business.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust watch for a bull\u2019s-eye around the bite. If you see a bull\u2019s-eye, we\u2019ll need to go to the doctor in the morning,\u201d she says.\n\n\nI lie awake with all the lights on, watching for a bull\u2019s-eye.\n\nWhen Georgia can\u2019t sleep, I comb her hair. When I can\u2019t sleep, she tells me about her childhood. She has three older brothers. In their yard they had a set of dolphin-shaped swings that appeared to be caught by their chains. The Connecticut River sluiced the edge of their property. The swings were still there when Georgia drove me past the house this summer, but the place was dingy and run-down. One of the panes in the front door was sealed with a piece of cardboard, and someone had spray-painted the word keep on the side of the house.\n\n\u201cOh, well,\u201d Georgia said. \u201cMaybe some college students live there now.\u201d\n\nI could be that calm too, if I\u2019d never had to iron an impatient man\u2019s shirt or peel a soft-boiled egg for a screaming child. I am not the kind of woman who complains about the life she was meant to have: I was supposed to be handling shirts and eggs. My husband was supposed to be faithful.\n\nIn the years I was tending to Colt and Oliver, Georgia was serving her family as the quirky unmarried one. She drove her nieces and nephews to zoos. She bought them geodes and suspended prisms in their windows. If she ever meets my son, she will become his cheerful aunt. She\u2019s already read his novel twice.\n\n\u201cYou need to introduce me to Colt soon,\u201d she said recently. I was driving her home from the doctor\u2019s office. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of insulting.\u201d\n\n\u201cCould you turn the AC down? It\u2019s freezing in here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m too nice to give you a hard time about this, don\u2019t you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, but I laughed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, Judith. I\u2019m not afraid to piss you off.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t I know it,\u201d I said, but I am almost never mad at Georgia. It was Oliver who drew anger out of me. Oliver, capricious and unapologetic, a man who kept me guessing every day of our marriage.\n\nWhen we were first dating, I couldn\u2019t decide how to greet him. He never learned how to embrace. He let you press your body into his chest, but his arms were limp and useless. His firm handshake was so brief you couldn\u2019t tell if his skin was warm. That was me: choosing between one of his hands and two of his arms, weighing the trade-off, wanting more than I could get.\n\n",
        "story_a": "Judith had always found solace in routine. The morning light would filter through the lace curtains, casting delicate shadows on the kitchen floor as she brewed her coffee. The scent of freshly ground beans filled the air, mingling with the faint aroma of lavender from the garden. It was a small comfort, a daily ritual that anchored her amidst the chaos of a life recently upended by divorce.\n\nToday, as she stood by the window, cradling her mug, Judith watched the world outside with a sense of detachment. The oak tree in her front yard, its branches swaying gently in the autumn breeze, seemed to mock her with its steadfastness. She sipped her coffee, letting the warmth seep into her bones, and wondered how everything had changed so quickly.\n\nHer son, Ethan, had always been a quiet, introspective boy. Even now, as a grown man, there was an air of mystery about him that Judith could never quite penetrate. He had married young, to a woman named Lara, whose boldness and vivacity were a stark contrast to Ethan's reserved nature. Judith had never fully understood their dynamic, but she had accepted it, hoping that Lara's energy would draw Ethan out of his shell.\n\nIt was only after the divorce that Judith realized how little she truly knew her son. He had moved back in with her temporarily, bringing Lara with him. The house, once a sanctuary of calm, now buzzed with tension and unspoken words.\n\nJudith had never been one for confrontation, preferring to let things lie rather than stir the pot. But living with Ethan and Lara had forced her to confront the cracks in their relationship, cracks that mirrored her own failed marriage. She could see the strain in the way Lara's eyes darted away when Ethan spoke, the way Ethan's shoulders tensed whenever Lara entered the room.\n\nAnd then there was Georgia, the quirky neighbor who had moved in next door a few months ago. With her shock of curly red hair and penchant for eccentric clothing, Georgia was a breath of fresh air in Judith's otherwise staid existence. She had a way of seeing through Judith's carefully constructed facade, of piercing the veil of politeness that Judith wore like armor.\n\n\"Morning, Judith!\" Georgia called from her porch, waving a brightly colored scarf in greeting. Judith smiled and waved back, feeling a pang of gratitude for the woman's relentless cheerfulness.\n\nGeorgia had an uncanny ability to appear just when Judith needed her most. Whether it was a spontaneous invitation for tea or a quick chat over the garden fence, Georgia's presence was a balm to Judith's wounded soul.\n\n\"Got any plans for the day?\" Georgia asked, her voice carrying across the lawn.\n\nJudith shook her head. \"Just the usual, I suppose. Cleaning, cooking, trying to stay out of the way.\"\n\nGeorgia's eyes sparkled with mischief. \"Why don't you come over for a bit? I've got a new batch of herbal tea I want you to try. It's supposed to be great for stress.\"\n\nJudith hesitated, glancing back at the house. She could hear the faint murmur of Ethan and Lara's voices, muffled by the walls but still unmistakably strained. A part of her wanted to retreat, to bury herself in the familiar comfort of her routines. But another part, the part that had been slowly awakening since the divorce, urged her to step outside her comfort zone.\n\n\"Alright,\" she said, surprising herself with the firmness in her voice. \"I'll be over in a few minutes.\"\n\nGeorgia beamed. \"Great! I'll put the kettle on.\"\n\nAs Judith made her way next door, she couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation. It was a small thing, a simple visit to a neighbor, but it felt like a step toward something new, something different.\n\nGeorgia's house was a riot of color and eclectic decor, a stark contrast to Judith's own subdued home. The walls were adorned with vibrant tapestries and framed photographs, while the shelves overflowed with knick-knacks and mementos from Georgia's travels.\n\n\"Welcome to my humble abode,\" Georgia said with a flourish, leading Judith to the cozy kitchen nook. \"Sit, sit! I'll get the tea.\"\n\nJudith settled into a cushioned chair, taking in the whirlwind of sights and sounds around her. It was chaotic, but in a way that felt alive and invigorating.\n\n\"How are things at home?\" Georgia asked, setting a steaming cup of tea in front of Judith.\n\nJudith sighed, wrapping her hands around the warm mug. \"Complicated, as always. Ethan and Lara... I don't know. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around them.\"\n\nGeorgia nodded sympathetically. \"Relationships are tricky, aren't they? Sometimes it feels like no matter what you do, you can't get it right.\"\n\nJudith took a sip of the tea, savoring the soothing blend of herbs. \"I just wish I knew how to help them. How to fix things.\"\n\n\"Maybe it's not about fixing,\" Georgia said gently. \"Maybe it's about understanding. Sometimes, the best thing we can do is just be there, to listen and support without trying to solve everything.\"\n\nJudith pondered Georgia's words, feeling a flicker of hope. Perhaps she had been going about it all wrong, trying to mend what was broken instead of simply being present.\n\n\"You're right,\" she said softly. \"I've been so focused on trying to make things better that I haven't really been there for them.\"\n\nGeorgia smiled, reaching across the table to squeeze Judith's hand. \"It's never too late to start.\"\n\nJudith left Georgia's house with a renewed sense of purpose. She couldn't change the past, but she could be there for Ethan and Lara in the present. She could listen, support, and try to understand.\n\nThat evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Judith found herself in the kitchen, preparing dinner. The rhythmic chopping of vegetables was a soothing balm to her frayed nerves. She could hear Ethan and Lara in the living room, their voices low and strained.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Judith wiped her hands on a dish towel and made her way to the living room. Ethan looked up, surprise flickering in his eyes as she entered.\n\n\"Dinner will be ready soon,\" she said, her voice steady. \"But I was hoping we could talk for a bit first.\"\n\nLara glanced at Ethan, then back at Judith. \"Sure,\" she said cautiously.\n\nJudith sat down, feeling the weight of the moment. \"I know things have been difficult lately,\" she began, choosing her words carefully. \"And I know I haven't been the best at supporting you both. But I want to change that. I want to be here for you, to listen and understand.\"\n\nEthan's gaze softened, and for the first time in weeks, Judith saw a glimmer of the boy she had raised, the boy who had once confided in her about his hopes and fears.\n\n\"It's not easy,\" Ethan said quietly. \"Marriage, life... it's all so much harder than I thought it would be.\"\n\nLara nodded, her eyes filling with unshed tears. \"We've been struggling, trying to make things work, but it feels like we're just drifting further apart.\"\n\nJudith reached out, taking both their hands in hers. \"You're not alone in this. We can figure it out together.\"\n\nThey talked long into the night, sharing their fears, frustrations, and hopes. It was a beginning, a tentative step toward healing and understanding.\n\nIn the days that followed, Judith made a conscious effort to be more present, to truly listen and support without trying to fix everything. It wasn't always easy, and there were still moments of tension and uncertainty. But there was also a growing sense of connection, a fragile but genuine bond that began to form between them.\n\nOne afternoon, as Judith worked in her garden, she felt a presence beside her. Looking up, she saw Georgia, her ever-present smile lighting up her face.\n\n\"How's it going?\" Georgia asked, her eyes twinkling with curiosity.\n\nJudith wiped the sweat from her brow, feeling a sense of accomplishment. \"Better, I think. We're talking more, trying to understand each other. It's a slow process, but it feels like progress.\"\n\nGeorgia nodded approvingly. \"That's wonderful to hear. Sometimes, it's the small steps that make the biggest difference.\"\n\nJudith smiled, feeling a surge of gratitude for the woman who had become her friend and confidante. \"Thank you, Georgia. For everything.\"\n\nGeorgia waved off her thanks with a laugh. \"Oh, don't mention it. We're all just trying to figure this life thing out together, right?\"\n\nAs the weeks turned into months, Judith found herself growing more comfortable with the new rhythm of her life. She discovered strength she hadn't known she possessed, a resilience that carried her through the challenges she faced.\n\nEthan and Lara continued to navigate their own struggles, but there was a newfound openness between them. They began attending couples therapy, working through their issues with a determination that both impressed and humbled Judith.\n\nOne evening, as they sat around the dinner table, Lara reached for Judith's hand. \"Thank you,\" she said, her voice filled with sincerity. \"For being there for us, for believing in us.\"\n\nJudith felt a lump form in her throat, her heart swelling with emotion. \"I'm so proud of you both,\" she said, her voice trembling. \"You've come so far, and I know you'll continue to grow together.\"\n\nEthan squeezed her hand, his eyes shining with gratitude. \"We couldn't have done it without you, Mom.\"\n\nAs they shared a meal, laughter and conversation filling the air, Judith felt a sense of peace she hadn't known in a long time. The road ahead was still uncertain, but she knew they would face it together, with love and understanding guiding their way.\n\nLater that night, as she lay in bed, Judith reflected on the journey she had taken since her divorce. It had been a difficult and often painful path, but it had also been a journey of self-discovery and growth. She had found strength in herself and in the connections she had forged with those around her.\n\nAnd as she drifted off to sleep, the gentle rustle of the oak tree outside her window a comforting lullaby, Judith knew that she was exactly where she was meant to be.",
        "story_b": "The first time Judith saw Georgia after the divorce, she was standing knee-deep in the hydrangeas, a paintbrush in her hand, splattering blues and purples across a canvas that leaned against the fence separating their yards. Georgia looked up, grinned as if she\u2019d been expecting Judith\u2019s arrival all along, and waved her brush in a broad arc that sent droplets of color into the air.\n\n\u201cCareful!\u201d Judith called out instinctively, stepping onto the grass that separated her patio from the chaotic garden Georgia had cultivated over the years. It was a riot of color and life, untamed and unapologetic, much like Georgia herself.\n\n\u201cAh, let them fall where they may,\u201d Georgia replied, her voice a bright thread weaving through the soft afternoon air. \u201cIt\u2019s just paint. Besides, I always think a little mess is good for the soul.\u201d\n\nJudith hesitated, feeling a twinge of envy at Georgia\u2019s ease, her ability to embrace the unpredictable. It was a quality Judith had admired from afar, never quite daring to emulate. Her own garden was neatly trimmed, the roses pruned to perfection, a reflection of the order she\u2019d always tried to maintain in her life. But now, as she stood there, she couldn\u2019t help but feel that perhaps a little mess wouldn\u2019t be so bad after all.\n\n\u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d Georgia asked, setting the brush aside and stepping over the flowers to join Judith. Her gaze was direct, piercing, yet somehow comforting.\n\nJudith shrugged, a gesture that was meant to be nonchalant but felt heavy with the weight of everything she couldn\u2019t say. \u201cSurviving, I suppose. It\u2019s... different, being alone.\u201d\n\nGeorgia nodded, her expression softening. \u201cDifferent isn\u2019t always bad, you know. Sometimes it\u2019s exactly what we need.\u201d\n\nThey stood in silence for a moment, the sun casting long shadows across the grass. Judith watched as a bee hovered lazily over a cluster of daisies, its wings a blur of motion. A part of her wanted to swat it away, to maintain the pristine image of her garden, but another part\u2014the part that had walked into Georgia\u2019s garden\u2014wanted to let it be.\n\n\u201cHow about some tea?\u201d Georgia offered suddenly, breaking the spell. \u201cI\u2019ve got a new blend I\u2019ve been dying to try on someone.\u201d\n\nJudith hesitated, the familiar pull of routine tugging at her. But then she nodded, surprising herself. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d\n\nAs they made their way through the tangled pathway to Georgia\u2019s back porch, Judith felt an odd sense of anticipation, as if she were on the cusp of something yet undefined.\n\n---\n\nJudith\u2019s son, Ian, had been less enigmatic before the divorce, or perhaps Judith had simply been too distracted by her own unraveling marriage to notice. Now, he seemed a puzzle she couldn\u2019t quite piece together. He was thoughtful, often lost in his own world, and his wife, Emily, was his perfect foil\u2014bold, outspoken, and fiercely independent.\n\nThe three of them sat in Judith\u2019s living room, the air heavy with the kind of silence that follows an unanswered question. Emily was the first to break it, her voice slicing through the tension like a knife.\n\n\u201cHave you thought about what you want to do next?\u201d she asked, her tone direct but not unkind. It was a question Judith had been avoiding, preferring the hazy comfort of indecision to the stark reality of making choices.\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Judith admitted, her gaze flitting to Ian, who was studying a spot on the carpet with an intensity that suggested he was anywhere but there. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m still figuring it out.\u201d\n\nEmily nodded, her expression thoughtful. \u201cWell, whatever you decide, we\u2019re here for you. Right, Ian?\u201d\n\nIan nodded absently, his attention still elsewhere. Judith felt a pang of frustration mingled with affection. Her son, so like his father in some ways, was a mystery she yearned to understand but feared she never would.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Judith said, the word feeling inadequate but necessary. She appreciated Emily\u2019s straightforwardness, even if it sometimes rubbed her the wrong way. It was a trait she was learning to value more and more.\n\nAs the conversation drifted to safer topics\u2014Emily\u2019s new project at work, a book Ian had been reading\u2014Judith found herself thinking of Georgia and her garden. It was strange, this growing connection she felt, as if Georgia were a key to a door Judith hadn\u2019t realized was locked.\n\n---\n\nThe next time Judith visited Georgia, it was with a newfound sense of purpose. She brought a pair of gardening gloves and a sunhat, determined to dig into the earth and see what might grow.\n\nGeorgia greeted her with the same infectious grin, her eyes twinkling with unspoken understanding. \u201cReady to get your hands dirty?\u201d she asked, holding out a trowel.\n\nJudith nodded, feeling an unexpected thrill at the prospect. \u201cI think so,\u201d she replied, taking the trowel and kneeling beside a patch of bare soil.\n\nAs they worked side by side, Georgia shared stories of her travels, her laughter punctuating the air like the song of a bird. Judith listened, occasionally sharing her own tales, surprised at how easily the words came. There was something freeing about the rhythm of planting, the way it allowed her thoughts to flow unbidden, like a river breaking through a dam.\n\n\u201cWhat about your family?\u201d Judith asked at one point, realizing she knew little about Georgia\u2019s past.\n\nGeorgia paused, wiping her brow with the back of her hand. \u201cOh, they\u2019re scattered all over. I\u2019ve got a sister in Oregon, a brother in Texas. We\u2019re not particularly close, but we make it work.\u201d\n\nJudith nodded, thinking of her own family, the ties that bound them and the gaps that sometimes seemed insurmountable. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, isn\u2019t it? Staying connected.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Georgia agreed, her gaze drifting to the horizon. \u201cBut I think sometimes the connections we make outside of family can be just as important, if not more so.\u201d\n\nJudith pondered this, realizing with a jolt of clarity that Georgia was right. Family was important, but so were the bonds she was forming now, the friendships that were teaching her to see the world\u2014and herself\u2014in a new light.\n\n---\n\nThe days turned into weeks, and Judith found herself spending more and more time in Georgia\u2019s garden, cultivating not only plants but a sense of belonging she hadn\u2019t known she craved. She learned to appreciate the beauty in imperfection, the way a crooked stem could still produce a stunning bloom, how a patch of weeds could become a haven for butterflies.\n\nHer relationship with Ian and Emily continued to evolve, too, though not always smoothly. There were moments of tension, of misunderstanding, but also of warmth and laughter. Judith began to see her son in a different light, recognizing the complexities she had once overlooked. Emily, too, revealed layers Judith hadn\u2019t anticipated, her bold exterior masking a depth of compassion that sometimes caught Judith off guard.\n\nOne evening, as they sat around the dinner table, Emily broached the subject of Judith\u2019s future once more. \u201cHave you thought about traveling?\u201d she asked, her eyes bright with excitement. \u201cI know you\u2019ve always wanted to see Italy.\u201d\n\nJudith hesitated, the idea both thrilling and terrifying. She had dreamed of Italy for years, but the thought of venturing out alone was daunting.\n\n\u201cI have,\u201d she admitted, glancing at Ian, who was watching her with an expression of quiet support. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Emily pressed gently. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the time now, and it might be just what you need.\u201d\n\nJudith considered this, feeling the familiar tug of fear warring with a burgeoning desire for adventure. Georgia\u2019s words echoed in her mind: Different isn\u2019t always bad. Sometimes it\u2019s exactly what we need.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Judith said finally, a smile tugging at her lips. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\n---\n\nAs spring melted into summer, Judith and Georgia\u2019s garden flourished, a testament to their shared effort and growing friendship. It became a haven not only for them but for the neighborhood, a place where people gathered to admire the blooms and bask in the sense of community it fostered.\n\nOne evening, as they sat on the porch sipping iced tea, Georgia turned to Judith, her expression uncharacteristically serious. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d she began, \u201cabout what you said the other day, about family and connection.\u201d\n\nJudith nodded, curious. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d Georgia said, a soft smile playing on her lips. \u201cFamily is important, but so are the connections we choose. I\u2019ve found that here, with you.\u201d\n\nJudith felt a warmth spreading through her chest, a sense of gratitude and belonging she hadn\u2019t expected. \u201cI feel the same way,\u201d she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThey sat in companionable silence, the sun dipping below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of pink and orange. Judith felt a sense of peace she hadn\u2019t known in years, a quiet acceptance of where she was and where she might go.\n\n---\n\nIn the end, Judith\u2019s journey was far from over, but she had taken the first steps toward understanding herself and her place within her family. The garden she and Georgia had tended was a living symbol of growth and renewal, a reminder that life, like love, was a series of seasons, each with its own beauty and challenges.\n\nAs the summer days stretched on, Judith found herself contemplating the future with a sense of hope and possibility. Italy, once a distant dream, was now a tangible goal, a chance to explore not only a new country but a new chapter of her life.\n\nAnd so, as she stood on the porch, watching the fireflies dance in the twilight, Judith smiled, knowing that wherever her journey led, she was no longer afraid to follow.",

And yes, I put in the air conditioner.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know how you live without it.\u201d He takes his shoes off before he goes upstairs. That was one of his father\u2019s rules.\n\nI hold the front door open for my daughter-in-law and her suitcase. Her red hair is in a pompadour, left over from last night\u2019s party. When she kisses my cheek I smell coconut pomade.\n\n\u201cI asked him not to bring that,\u201d Vivian says, looking at the typewriter. \u201cHe could use a few days off from work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you like some juice? I have orange and pineapple.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thanks. Too much sugar.\u201d Vivian, all hip bones and rib cage, is afraid of sugar.\n\nI wait until she is upstairs before addressing the typewriter.\n\n\u201cGet out,\u201d I tell the well-worn keys. \u201cGet out.\u201d\n\n\nNothing that belongs to Oliver is allowed in my house. When he left me I held a tag sale on my front lawn. The first days passed without a single prospect. People were shy. They knew Oliver as the man who spread fireplace ashes on icy steps. They remembered when he cleared the road of tree branches after a hurricane. But I knew I could trust a free market. Was I really selling that guitar for five dollars? I was.\n\nI met Georgia at my sale, over a canvas bag of my wedding china. She\u2019d moved to the neighborhood a year before, and I knew as much about her as did everyone else on our street: she was a spinster who\u2019d made an enormous web of pulled cotton to cover her front windows at Halloween, and at Christmas she left icebox cookies in our mailboxes. She was wearing a souvenir T-shirt from Hollywood, and between her breasts a giant palm tree waved its sequined fronds.\n\n\u201cHow much for the china?\u201d she\u2019d said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anything for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much?\u201d\n\n\u201cZero dollars and zero cents.\u201d\n\nShe picked up a tempered-glass paperweight shaped like an abalone shell. \u201cI\u2019ll give you five dollars for this, and no less than fifty for the china.\u201d\n\nI was drinking a beer, which I set aside to count her change. \u201cThis isn\u2019t how bargaining usually works,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m stealing something,\u201d she said.\n\n\nColt comes downstairs with a copy of his novel in his hands.\n\n\u201cFound this by the tub. How far are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI started it.\u201d I unwrap a rack of spareribs and set them on a baking sheet. I regret, for a moment, that I sold Oliver\u2019s grill for a dime.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re offended by the title. I knew you\u2019d be offended.\u201d\n\nHe sits at the table and props one foot on a chair. This makes me miss his childhood. I kiss the top of his head.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say, \u201cthough I guess slut isn\u2019t one of my favorite words.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t bother me that Colt\u2019s book is called The Confessions of Slut Twenty-Three; nor does it bother me that Slut Twenty-Three, in the pages I\u2019ve skimmed, physically resembles Vivian. If what he writes is taken from their lives, Vivian randomly demands sex in parking lots, makes Colt wear her hosiery, and runs a blow-job clinic in the smoking garden of a local bar.\n\nI am not offended by his pedantic diagrams of sexual positions, or by the character named Mlle Fuck-You. It\u2019s the shrill, smug voice he picked up in college that I can\u2019t stand. His narrator, The-Man-in-Love-with-the-Slut, describes himself as \u201cyour average spoiled white kid from the suburbs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not a \u2018white kid from the suburbs,\u2019 \u201d I want to tell him. \u201cYou\u2019re from a small town nowhere near a city. You were raised to treat people decently. And your father and I never spoiled you.\u201d But I know\u2014I know, I know\u2014that this is not an autobiography.\n\nI believe Colt when he tells me that in certain circles he is famous. Once I suggested that those circles might be concentrated in Brooklyn, and my throat closed with guilt the moment I said it. Colt is my delight; he is my only child. For nine months I prayed for the healthy heart now beating under his shirt. As soon as I could hold him, heart and all, I sensed the futility of prayer. I knew that every time he was hurt it would be my fault.\n\n\nThey smoked a joint right before dinner while I picked green beans from the garden. Colt\u2019s elbows are on the table. He tells us, several times, that he would love it if some backwoods library in the Deep South banned his book.\n\n\u201cEnough about you,\u201d Vivian says.\n\n\u201cOkay. Tell Mom about your new business idea,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe have this dog park near our building, and the people are ridiculous. They dress the dogs in little quilted jackets. They give them the same kinds of names they give their kids: Jordan, Mason, Hunter, Taylor.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo ridiculous,\u201d Colt says.\n\n\u201cAnyway, there\u2019s a multilingual school down the street from the park. I thought maybe people would be into a multilingual class for dogs. Not like they think the dog is going to speak, but so a dog can follow commands in three or four languages.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am, but I\u2019m not. I think if we charged $75 per session, we might convince some people it\u2019s worth paying for. So that might be my project for the next six months.\u201d The look they exchange tells me this joke has been broken in, and that every time she tells it, Colt is charmed.\n\n\u201cWhat about you, Mom?\u201d he says. \u201cWhat do you see yourself doing in the next six months?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe some camping up in Acadia before it gets too cold.\u201d Georgia and I have been planning this trip for months.\n\n\u201cBut who would go with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, who would go with you?\u201d\n\nThey give me a pitying look. They think I am alone, and they think they are invincible. Vivian has no visible reaction to Colt\u2019s hand on the back of her neck. This is the smugness of having your lover beside you all the time. I want to tell her that being loved this much leaves no mark. If Colt rises from the table, she will look as lonely as I do.\n\n\nSometimes I wish Colt would find the whole thing abhorrent. Two women? Disgusting. His own mother? Disgusting. If he could back away from it, maybe I could tell him. But Colt and Viv would levitate with pleasure. They\u2019d sit there thinking they\u2019d finally figured me out: there\u2019s Mom, Judith, clear as an egg wash, a classic closet case. Maybe she\u2019s been waiting for Georgia her whole life.\n\nSurely Colt remembers the traffic jam. A westbound lane on the Sagamore Bridge, a cup of rum-raisin ice cream in his hand, his head out the window to watch the Cape Cod Canal churning with rain, traces of zinc oxide on his nose. He was eleven. He asked his parents, \u201cHave either of you ever been in love?\u201d\n\nOliver had just given me opal earrings for my birthday, suffered a lobster dinner on my behalf.\n\n\u201cOf course, son,\u201d he said, reaching back to tousle his hair.\n\nI couldn\u2019t stop wondering why Colt would ask us that.\n\n\u201cHe asks why we can\u2019t take vacation on a different planet. He asks why we can\u2019t drink saltwater. I wouldn\u2019t worry about this,\u201d Oliver said.\n\nWe were in the yard, the grass freshly mowed, mosquitoes biting freely as dusk unraveled. It was a Saturday, the night Oliver was allowed to get drunk. Colt was at a friend\u2019s house, observing marriages that were apparently stronger than mine.\n\n\u201cGive me a priss, kitty,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cStop worrying.\u201d\n\nI worried even more after that.\n\n\nI can see it now: Georgia in a souvenir T-shirt, a shade overweight, telling stories as if we\u2019ve been married for years. The three of them teasing me for voting Republican. \u201cI always knew there was a liberal in there somewhere,\u201d Colt will say. They will need a little less from me, a little more from each other; I in turn will need a little more from all of them.\n\nThey\u2019ll have cocktail hour while I drink club soda with lime. Georgia will mix vodka and grenadine, even though I\u2019ve told her it\u2019s tacky. She doesn\u2019t mind being teased, and she doesn\u2019t know how to be jealous, two of my favorite things about her. She indulges me when I need to talk about my married life. She knows how many buttons I had on my wedding dress. She knows that Oliver and I spent our wedding night at the Pioneer Hotel, with its misplaced neoclassical columns. The windows were jalousies, and there was only one towel in the bathroom. There was a folding screen, and I\u2019d felt obliged to change behind it, even though we\u2019d seen each other naked many times.\n\n\nI call Vivian to the bathroom after my shower. She is pleased. This is the kind of thing daughters-in-law do: they enter intimate spaces unflinchingly.\n\n\u201cTake a look at this mole,\u201d I tell her, pulling my robe away from my breast. \u201cI swear I didn\u2019t have it this morning.\u201d\n\nShe excuses herself to get her glasses from her handbag.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a mole, Judith. That\u2019s a tick.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like a mole.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s in there pretty deep.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, shit,\u201d I say. \u201cCan you get it out?\u201d\n\nFirst she tries tweezers, which I keep on a mirrored tray by the sink.\n\n\u201cThis fucker\u2019s really in there,\u201d she says.\n\nMy eyes are watery, my head hot.\n\n\u201cDo you think I might already have Lyme disease?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d she says, the first hint of a mother I\u2019ve ever seen in her.\n\nWhen Vivian worries the tweezers are making it worse, she asks Colt to bring matches. There are holes in the knees of her jeans, and her fingernails are painted gold. She has a scar on her arm from breaking a window when her father refused to give her his credit card. (She was, she has assured me, only twenty-two at the time.) This is the girl who holds a flame close to my skin.\n\nWhen she finally gets the tick out without starting a fire, I offer her fifty dollars. \u201cAn investment in your multilingual dog business.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust watch for a bull\u2019s-eye around the bite. If you see a bull\u2019s-eye, we\u2019ll need to go to the doctor in the morning,\u201d she says.\n\n\nI lie awake with all the lights on, watching for a bull\u2019s-eye.\n\nWhen Georgia can\u2019t sleep, I comb her hair. When I can\u2019t sleep, she tells me about her childhood. She has three older brothers. In their yard they had a set of dolphin-shaped swings that appeared to be caught by their chains. The Connecticut River sluiced the edge of their property. The swings were still there when Georgia drove me past the house this summer, but the place was dingy and run-down. One of the panes in the front door was sealed with a piece of cardboard, and someone had spray-painted the word keep on the side of the house.\n\n\u201cOh, well,\u201d Georgia said. \u201cMaybe some college students live there now.\u201d\n\nI could be that calm too, if I\u2019d never had to iron an impatient man\u2019s shirt or peel a soft-boiled egg for a screaming child. I am not the kind of woman who complains about the life she was meant to have: I was supposed to be handling shirts and eggs. My husband was supposed to be faithful.\n\nIn the years I was tending to Colt and Oliver, Georgia was serving her family as the quirky unmarried one. She drove her nieces and nephews to zoos. She bought them geodes and suspended prisms in their windows. If she ever meets my son, she will become his cheerful aunt. She\u2019s already read his novel twice.\n\n\u201cYou need to introduce me to Colt soon,\u201d she said recently. I was driving her home from the doctor\u2019s office. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of insulting.\u201d\n\n\u201cCould you turn the AC down? It\u2019s freezing in here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m too nice to give you a hard time about this, don\u2019t you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, but I laughed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, Judith. I\u2019m not afraid to piss you off.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t I know it,\u201d I said, but I am almost never mad at Georgia. It was Oliver who drew anger out of me. Oliver, capricious and unapologetic, a man who kept me guessing every day of our marriage.\n\nWhen we were first dating, I couldn\u2019t decide how to greet him. He never learned how to embrace. He let you press your body into his chest, but his arms were limp and useless. His firm handshake was so brief you couldn\u2019t tell if his skin was warm. That was me: choosing between one of his hands and two of his arms, weighing the trade-off, wanting more than I could get.\n\n",
        "story_a": "Judith had always found solace in routine. The morning light would filter through the lace curtains, casting delicate shadows on the kitchen floor as she brewed her coffee. The scent of freshly ground beans filled the air, mingling with the faint aroma of lavender from the garden. It was a small comfort, a daily ritual that anchored her amidst the chaos of a life recently upended by divorce.\n\nToday, as she stood by the window, cradling her mug, Judith watched the world outside with a sense of detachment. The oak tree in her front yard, its branches swaying gently in the autumn breeze, seemed to mock her with its steadfastness. She sipped her coffee, letting the warmth seep into her bones, and wondered how everything had changed so quickly.\n\nHer son, Ethan, had always been a quiet, introspective boy. Even now, as a grown man, there was an air of mystery about him that Judith could never quite penetrate. He had married young, to a woman named Lara, whose boldness and vivacity were a stark contrast to Ethan's reserved nature. Judith had never fully understood their dynamic, but she had accepted it, hoping that Lara's energy would draw Ethan out of his shell.\n\nIt was only after the divorce that Judith realized how little she truly knew her son. He had moved back in with her temporarily, bringing Lara with him. The house, once a sanctuary of calm, now buzzed with tension and unspoken words.\n\nJudith had never been one for confrontation, preferring to let things lie rather than stir the pot. But living with Ethan and Lara had forced her to confront the cracks in their relationship, cracks that mirrored her own failed marriage. She could see the strain in the way Lara's eyes darted away when Ethan spoke, the way Ethan's shoulders tensed whenever Lara entered the room.\n\nAnd then there was Georgia, the quirky neighbor who had moved in next door a few months ago. With her shock of curly red hair and penchant for eccentric clothing, Georgia was a breath of fresh air in Judith's otherwise staid existence. She had a way of seeing through Judith's carefully constructed facade, of piercing the veil of politeness that Judith wore like armor.\n\n\"Morning, Judith!\" Georgia called from her porch, waving a brightly colored scarf in greeting. Judith smiled and waved back, feeling a pang of gratitude for the woman's relentless cheerfulness.\n\nGeorgia had an uncanny ability to appear just when Judith needed her most. Whether it was a spontaneous invitation for tea or a quick chat over the garden fence, Georgia's presence was a balm to Judith's wounded soul.\n\n\"Got any plans for the day?\" Georgia asked, her voice carrying across the lawn.\n\nJudith shook her head. \"Just the usual, I suppose. Cleaning, cooking, trying to stay out of the way.\"\n\nGeorgia's eyes sparkled with mischief. \"Why don't you come over for a bit? I've got a new batch of herbal tea I want you to try. It's supposed to be great for stress.\"\n\nJudith hesitated, glancing back at the house. She could hear the faint murmur of Ethan and Lara's voices, muffled by the walls but still unmistakably strained. A part of her wanted to retreat, to bury herself in the familiar comfort of her routines. But another part, the part that had been slowly awakening since the divorce, urged her to step outside her comfort zone.\n\n\"Alright,\" she said, surprising herself with the firmness in her voice. \"I'll be over in a few minutes.\"\n\nGeorgia beamed. \"Great! I'll put the kettle on.\"\n\nAs Judith made her way next door, she couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation. It was a small thing, a simple visit to a neighbor, but it felt like a step toward something new, something different.\n\nGeorgia's house was a riot of color and eclectic decor, a stark contrast to Judith's own subdued home. The walls were adorned with vibrant tapestries and framed photographs, while the shelves overflowed with knick-knacks and mementos from Georgia's travels.\n\n\"Welcome to my humble abode,\" Georgia said with a flourish, leading Judith to the cozy kitchen nook. \"Sit, sit! I'll get the tea.\"\n\nJudith settled into a cushioned chair, taking in the whirlwind of sights and sounds around her. It was chaotic, but in a way that felt alive and invigorating.\n\n\"How are things at home?\" Georgia asked, setting a steaming cup of tea in front of Judith.\n\nJudith sighed, wrapping her hands around the warm mug. \"Complicated, as always. Ethan and Lara... I don't know. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around them.\"\n\nGeorgia nodded sympathetically. \"Relationships are tricky, aren't they? Sometimes it feels like no matter what you do, you can't get it right.\"\n\nJudith took a sip of the tea, savoring the soothing blend of herbs. \"I just wish I knew how to help them. How to fix things.\"\n\n\"Maybe it's not about fixing,\" Georgia said gently. \"Maybe it's about understanding. Sometimes, the best thing we can do is just be there, to listen and support without trying to solve everything.\"\n\nJudith pondered Georgia's words, feeling a flicker of hope. Perhaps she had been going about it all wrong, trying to mend what was broken instead of simply being present.\n\n\"You're right,\" she said softly. \"I've been so focused on trying to make things better that I haven't really been there for them.\"\n\nGeorgia smiled, reaching across the table to squeeze Judith's hand. \"It's never too late to start.\"\n\nJudith left Georgia's house with a renewed sense of purpose. She couldn't change the past, but she could be there for Ethan and Lara in the present. She could listen, support, and try to understand.\n\nThat evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Judith found herself in the kitchen, preparing dinner. The rhythmic chopping of vegetables was a soothing balm to her frayed nerves. She could hear Ethan and Lara in the living room, their voices low and strained.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Judith wiped her hands on a dish towel and made her way to the living room. Ethan looked up, surprise flickering in his eyes as she entered.\n\n\"Dinner will be ready soon,\" she said, her voice steady. \"But I was hoping we could talk for a bit first.\"\n\nLara glanced at Ethan, then back at Judith. \"Sure,\" she said cautiously.\n\nJudith sat down, feeling the weight of the moment. \"I know things have been difficult lately,\" she began, choosing her words carefully. \"And I know I haven't been the best at supporting you both. But I want to change that. I want to be here for you, to listen and understand.\"\n\nEthan's gaze softened, and for the first time in weeks, Judith saw a glimmer of the boy she had raised, the boy who had once confided in her about his hopes and fears.\n\n\"It's not easy,\" Ethan said quietly. \"Marriage, life... it's all so much harder than I thought it would be.\"\n\nLara nodded, her eyes filling with unshed tears. \"We've been struggling, trying to make things work, but it feels like we're just drifting further apart.\"\n\nJudith reached out, taking both their hands in hers. \"You're not alone in this. We can figure it out together.\"\n\nThey talked long into the night, sharing their fears, frustrations, and hopes. It was a beginning, a tentative step toward healing and understanding.\n\nIn the days that followed, Judith made a conscious effort to be more present, to truly listen and support without trying to fix everything. It wasn't always easy, and there were still moments of tension and uncertainty. But there was also a growing sense of connection, a fragile but genuine bond that began to form between them.\n\nOne afternoon, as Judith worked in her garden, she felt a presence beside her. Looking up, she saw Georgia, her ever-present smile lighting up her face.\n\n\"How's it going?\" Georgia asked, her eyes twinkling with curiosity.\n\nJudith wiped the sweat from her brow, feeling a sense of accomplishment. \"Better, I think. We're talking more, trying to understand each other. It's a slow process, but it feels like progress.\"\n\nGeorgia nodded approvingly. \"That's wonderful to hear. Sometimes, it's the small steps that make the biggest difference.\"\n\nJudith smiled, feeling a surge of gratitude for the woman who had become her friend and confidante. \"Thank you, Georgia. For everything.\"\n\nGeorgia waved off her thanks with a laugh. \"Oh, don't mention it. We're all just trying to figure this life thing out together, right?\"\n\nAs the weeks turned into months, Judith found herself growing more comfortable with the new rhythm of her life. She discovered strength she hadn't known she possessed, a resilience that carried her through the challenges she faced.\n\nEthan and Lara continued to navigate their own struggles, but there was a newfound openness between them. They began attending couples therapy, working through their issues with a determination that both impressed and humbled Judith.\n\nOne evening, as they sat around the dinner table, Lara reached for Judith's hand. \"Thank you,\" she said, her voice filled with sincerity. \"For being there for us, for believing in us.\"\n\nJudith felt a lump form in her throat, her heart swelling with emotion. \"I'm so proud of you both,\" she said, her voice trembling. \"You've come so far, and I know you'll continue to grow together.\"\n\nEthan squeezed her hand, his eyes shining with gratitude. \"We couldn't have done it without you, Mom.\"\n\nAs they shared a meal, laughter and conversation filling the air, Judith felt a sense of peace she hadn't known in a long time. The road ahead was still uncertain, but she knew they would face it together, with love and understanding guiding their way.\n\nLater that night, as she lay in bed, Judith reflected on the journey she had taken since her divorce. It had been a difficult and often painful path, but it had also been a journey of self-discovery and growth. She had found strength in herself and in the connections she had forged with those around her.\n\nAnd as she drifted off to sleep, the gentle rustle of the oak tree outside her window a comforting lullaby, Judith knew that she was exactly where she was meant to be.",
        "story_b": "Judith stood in the middle of her living room, surrounded by a sea of cardboard boxes, the scent of fresh paint lingering in the air. It was her first night in the new apartment, and the walls echoed with the unfamiliar emptiness of a space not yet lived in. She ran her fingers across the smooth surface of a nearby box labeled \"Kitchen,\" wondering if she had packed her favorite mug with the chipped handle that had seen her through countless cups of late-night tea.\n\nShe heard a knock at the door and hesitated for a moment, then opened it to find Georgia, her neighbor from down the hall, standing there with a bottle of wine and a slightly mischievous grin. Georgia was in her mid-fifties, with short, spiky hair and a collection of bangles clinking on her wrist. She always seemed to carry an air of unpredictability, like a summer storm that could break into sunshine at any moment.\n\n\"Thought you might need some company,\" Georgia said, waving the bottle. \"And maybe a break from unpacking. I know how daunting it can be.\"\n\nJudith stepped aside to let her in, feeling both grateful and apprehensive. Georgia's presence was a whirlwind, and Judith wasn't sure if she was ready for that kind of energy just yet. But as the night wore on, she found herself laughing more than she had in months, her worries temporarily swept away by the warmth of Georgia's laughter filling the room.\n\n\"So, what's the deal with your son and his wife?\" Georgia asked casually, refilling their glasses with a practiced hand.\n\nJudith sighed, the question bringing a familiar weight back to her chest. \"Evan's been...distant since the divorce. I think he's trying to find his own way of dealing with it, and Rachel, well, she's always been quite bold. She has this way of pushing boundaries that I'm still getting used to.\"\n\n\"Bold can be good,\" Georgia mused, swirling her wine. \"Sometimes it takes a bold move to see things differently, don't you think?\"\n\nJudith nodded slowly, thinking of all the times Rachel's straightforwardness had caught her off guard. Like the time Rachel had insisted on keeping the family tradition of Sunday dinners, despite Judith's reluctance to partake in something that reminded her so much of her married life.\n\nThe following Sunday, as Judith sat at the familiar dining table in Evan and Rachel's home, she felt the weight of tradition pressing down on her. The room was filled with the aroma of roast chicken and rosemary, and Judith watched as her son carved the bird with careful precision, a skill he had inherited from his father.\n\n\"Mom, why don't you say grace?\" Evan suggested, looking up with a hopeful smile.\n\nJudith hesitated, the words sticking in her throat. It was a simple request, yet it felt like a monumental task. This was the first time she had been asked to lead grace since the divorce, and the familiar prayer felt foreign on her tongue.\n\nRachel reached out and squeezed her hand. \"You don't have to if it makes you uncomfortable. We can start a new tradition.\"\n\nJudith looked at her daughter-in-law, surprised by the unexpected kindness. Rachel's eyes were earnest, and for the first time, Judith saw her not as the bold intruder but as someone who genuinely wanted to be part of the family, someone who understood the need for change.\n\n\"No, it's okay,\" Judith said finally, finding her voice. \"I think it's time for something new.\"\n\nAfter dinner, as the conversation flowed easily over dessert, Judith felt a sense of belonging that she hadn't anticipated. It wasn't the same as before, but it was something new, something that felt like growth.\n\nLater that evening, back in her own apartment, Judith sat on the balcony, the cool night air brushing against her skin. She thought of Georgia's words about boldness and seeing things differently. Maybe Georgia was right. Maybe it was time to embrace change rather than fear it.\n\nAs if summoned by her thoughts, Georgia appeared at the railing separating their balconies, holding two steaming mugs. \"Thought you might like some tea,\" she said, passing one over.\n\n\"How did you know?\" Judith asked, cradling the mug in her hands and inhaling the soothing aroma.\n\n\"Call it neighborly intuition,\" Georgia replied with a wink. \"Besides, you looked like you could use a friend.\"\n\nJudith smiled, feeling a warmth spread through her that had nothing to do with the tea. \"Thank you. For everything.\"\n\n\"Anytime, Judith. Just remember, life isn't about finding yourself. It's about creating yourself. So go on, create something beautiful.\"\n\nJudith took a sip of her tea, the steam rising in gentle swirls, and for the first time in a long time, she felt a flicker of hope. Maybe this new life, with all its complexities and challenges, could be beautiful after all. Maybe she just needed to be bold enough to see it.\n\nThe days turned into weeks, and Judith found herself falling into a new rhythm. She spent her mornings unpacking and arranging her apartment, each room slowly taking on a personality of its own. In the afternoons, she often found herself on her balcony, sharing stories and laughter with Georgia, whose free spirit was proving to be a balm to Judith\u2019s cautious heart.\n\nOne particular afternoon, as they sat watching the clouds drift lazily across the sky, Georgia nudged her. \"You know, you should come to one of my art classes.\"\n\nJudith raised an eyebrow. \"Art? I'm not sure I have the talent for that.\"\n\n\"It's not about talent,\" Georgia assured her. \"It's about expression. Besides, it's a great way to meet new people and maybe see things from a different perspective.\"\n\nJudith hesitated, the idea both intriguing and terrifying. But as she looked at Georgia, she felt a spark of something\u2014curiosity, perhaps, or the desire to try something completely out of her comfort zone.\n\n\"Okay,\" Judith agreed, surprising herself. \"I'll give it a try.\"\n\nThe art class was held in a sunlit studio, filled with easels and the smell of acrylic paint. Judith felt self-conscious at first, surrounded by strangers who seemed to know exactly what they were doing. But as she picked up a brush and let the colors flow onto the canvas, she began to lose herself in the rhythm of creation.\n\nIt was liberating, this act of painting without fear of judgment, allowing herself to explore emotions she had kept locked away for so long. The art became a silent conversation between her past and present, a way of reconciling who she was with who she was becoming.\n\nAs the class ended, Georgia walked over, looking at Judith's canvas with a smile. \"See? I knew you'd be great at this.\"\n\nJudith laughed, feeling a lightness she hadn't felt in years. \"I don't know about great, but it was...freeing.\"\n\n\"That's the point,\" Georgia said, clapping her on the back. \"Sometimes you just need to let go and see where the journey takes you.\"\n\nLater, as Judith returned to her apartment, she found a message from Evan on her phone. He wanted her to join them for dinner again, this time with a special announcement.\n\nCuriosity piqued, Judith agreed, wondering what news her son might have. She arrived at their home to find Rachel bustling around the kitchen, a nervous excitement in her movements.\n\nEvan greeted her with a hug, his smile wide and genuine. \"Mom, we have some great news. Rachel and I are expecting.\"\n\nJudith felt her heart swell with joy and surprise. \"Oh, Evan, that's wonderful!\" she exclaimed, pulling him into another embrace.\n\nAs they sat down to dinner, the atmosphere was filled with warmth and anticipation. Judith watched her son and daughter-in-law, their hands entwined, and felt a sense of peace settle over her. This new chapter in their lives, in her life, was unfolding with possibilities she hadn't dared to imagine.\n\nAfter dinner, as they lingered over coffee, Rachel turned to Judith with a soft smile. \"We were hoping you'd be involved, you know, in the baby's life. We want them to know their grandmother.\"\n\nJudith nodded, emotion welling up in her chest. \"I would love that,\" she said, her voice thick with gratitude.\n\nDriving home that night, Judith reflected on the changes that had come so swiftly. The divorce had been a turning point, a painful but necessary step toward rediscovering herself. And now, with Evan's growing family and her own burgeoning friendships, she felt a renewed sense of purpose.\n\nBack in her apartment, Judith reached for her phone, texting Georgia about the evening's news. Within minutes, Georgia was at her door, a bottle of champagne in hand.\n\n\"Let's celebrate,\" Georgia declared, popping the cork with a flourish. \"To new beginnings and the beautiful chaos of life.\"\n\nJudith laughed, toasting to the unexpected journey she was on. She had learned to embrace the unknown, to find beauty in the unraveling of plans and the forging of new paths.\n\nAs the night wore on, Judith and Georgia sat on the balcony, the city lights twinkling below them. Judith felt a sense of belonging, a contentment she hadn\u2019t thought possible after the upheaval of her divorce.\n\nGeorgia turned to her, her expression thoughtful. \"You know, Judith, it's okay to let go of what was and embrace what is. You're doing better than you think.\"\n\nJudith smiled, her heart full. She had found a friend in Georgia, a new understanding with her son and daughter-in-law, and a fresh sense of self. She was no longer defined by her past but by the choices she was making in the present.\n\nThe future was still uncertain, but Judith felt ready to face it, to create something beautiful out of the chaos. She was learning to redefine her identity, not as a divorced woman, but as a mother, a friend, an artist, and above all, as herself.\n\nAnd so, with the warmth of Georgia\u2019s friendship and the love of her family, Judith stepped boldly into the next chapter of her life, ready to embrace whatever came her way.",

        "ground_truth": "I have to call Georgia for help with the air conditioner. \u201cI thought I couldn\u2019t come over this weekend,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can lift it by myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d I can hear her washing dishes. \u201cSo I\u2019m allowed to come over if you need something.\u201d\n\nShe arrives within five minutes, as I knew she would. Under the brim of her straw hat her eyes are like peas in aspic. She has a dishcloth tucked into a pocket of her jeans. Georgia has never been married, but she is a better version of the wife I used to be. Her grocery lists say six damask plums where I would write fruit.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she says, taking the screen out of the window. \u201cI\u2019ll be gone by the time they get here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d I kiss her hand.\n\n\u201cIf you want to thank me, invite me to dinner tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say, but we both know I won\u2019t.\n\n\nColt arrives in tight jeans and a bolo tie, his father\u2019s old typewriter in his arms. He sets it on the kitchen table.\n\n\u201cYou guys can take my room. And yes, I put in the air conditioner.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know how you live without it.\u201d He takes his shoes off before he goes upstairs. That was one of his father\u2019s rules.\n\nI hold the front door open for my daughter-in-law and her suitcase. Her red hair is in a pompadour, left over from last night\u2019s party. When she kisses my cheek I smell coconut pomade.\n\n\u201cI asked him not to bring that,\u201d Vivian says, looking at the typewriter. \u201cHe could use a few days off from work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you like some juice? I have orange and pineapple.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thanks. Too much sugar.\u201d Vivian, all hip bones and rib cage, is afraid of sugar.\n\nI wait until she is upstairs before addressing the typewriter.\n\n\u201cGet out,\u201d I tell the well-worn keys. \u201cGet out.\u201d\n\n\nNothing that belongs to Oliver is allowed in my house. When he left me I held a tag sale on my front lawn. The first days passed without a single prospect. People were shy. They knew Oliver as the man who spread fireplace ashes on icy steps. They remembered when he cleared the road of tree branches after a hurricane. But I knew I could trust a free market. Was I really selling that guitar for five dollars? I was.\n\nI met Georgia at my sale, over a canvas bag of my wedding china. She\u2019d moved to the neighborhood a year before, and I knew as much about her as did everyone else on our street: she was a spinster who\u2019d made an enormous web of pulled cotton to cover her front windows at Halloween, and at Christmas she left icebox cookies in our mailboxes. She was wearing a souvenir T-shirt from Hollywood, and between her breasts a giant palm tree waved its sequined fronds.\n\n\u201cHow much for the china?\u201d she\u2019d said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anything for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much?\u201d\n\n\u201cZero dollars and zero cents.\u201d\n\nShe picked up a tempered-glass paperweight shaped like an abalone shell. \u201cI\u2019ll give you five dollars for this, and no less than fifty for the china.\u201d\n\nI was drinking a beer, which I set aside to count her change. \u201cThis isn\u2019t how bargaining usually works,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m stealing something,\u201d she said.\n\n\nColt comes downstairs with a copy of his novel in his hands.\n\n\u201cFound this by the tub. How far are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI started it.\u201d I unwrap a rack of spareribs and set them on a baking sheet. I regret, for a moment, that I sold Oliver\u2019s grill for a dime.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re offended by the title. I knew you\u2019d be offended.\u201d\n\nHe sits at the table and props one foot on a chair. This makes me miss his childhood. I kiss the top of his head.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say, \u201cthough I guess slut isn\u2019t one of my favorite words.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t bother me that Colt\u2019s book is called The Confessions of Slut Twenty-Three; nor does it bother me that Slut Twenty-Three, in the pages I\u2019ve skimmed, physically resembles Vivian. If what he writes is taken from their lives, Vivian randomly demands sex in parking lots, makes Colt wear her hosiery, and runs a blow-job clinic in the smoking garden of a local bar.\n\nI am not offended by his pedantic diagrams of sexual positions, or by the character named Mlle Fuck-You. It\u2019s the shrill, smug voice he picked up in college that I can\u2019t stand. His narrator, The-Man-in-Love-with-the-Slut, describes himself as \u201cyour average spoiled white kid from the suburbs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not a \u2018white kid from the suburbs,\u2019 \u201d I want to tell him. \u201cYou\u2019re from a small town nowhere near a city. You were raised to treat people decently. And your father and I never spoiled you.\u201d But I know\u2014I know, I know\u2014that this is not an autobiography.\n\nI believe Colt when he tells me that in certain circles he is famous. Once I suggested that those circles might be concentrated in Brooklyn, and my throat closed with guilt the moment I said it. Colt is my delight; he is my only child. For nine months I prayed for the healthy heart now beating under his shirt. As soon as I could hold him, heart and all, I sensed the futility of prayer. I knew that every time he was hurt it would be my fault.\n\n\nThey smoked a joint right before dinner while I picked green beans from the garden. Colt\u2019s elbows are on the table. He tells us, several times, that he would love it if some backwoods library in the Deep South banned his book.\n\n\u201cEnough about you,\u201d Vivian says.\n\n\u201cOkay. Tell Mom about your new business idea,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe have this dog park near our building, and the people are ridiculous. They dress the dogs in little quilted jackets. They give them the same kinds of names they give their kids: Jordan, Mason, Hunter, Taylor.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo ridiculous,\u201d Colt says.\n\n\u201cAnyway, there\u2019s a multilingual school down the street from the park. I thought maybe people would be into a multilingual class for dogs. Not like they think the dog is going to speak, but so a dog can follow commands in three or four languages.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am, but I\u2019m not. I think if we charged $75 per session, we might convince some people it\u2019s worth paying for. So that might be my project for the next six months.\u201d The look they exchange tells me this joke has been broken in, and that every time she tells it, Colt is charmed.\n\n\u201cWhat about you, Mom?\u201d he says. \u201cWhat do you see yourself doing in the next six months?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe some camping up in Acadia before it gets too cold.\u201d Georgia and I have been planning this trip for months.\n\n\u201cBut who would go with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, who would go with you?\u201d\n\nThey give me a pitying look. They think I am alone, and they think they are invincible. Vivian has no visible reaction to Colt\u2019s hand on the back of her neck. This is the smugness of having your lover beside you all the time. I want to tell her that being loved this much leaves no mark. If Colt rises from the table, she will look as lonely as I do.\n\n\nSometimes I wish Colt would find the whole thing abhorrent. Two women? Disgusting. His own mother? Disgusting. If he could back away from it, maybe I could tell him. But Colt and Viv would levitate with pleasure. They\u2019d sit there thinking they\u2019d finally figured me out: there\u2019s Mom, Judith, clear as an egg wash, a classic closet case. Maybe she\u2019s been waiting for Georgia her whole life.\n\nSurely Colt remembers the traffic jam. A westbound lane on the Sagamore Bridge, a cup of rum-raisin ice cream in his hand, his head out the window to watch the Cape Cod Canal churning with rain, traces of zinc oxide on his nose. He was eleven. He asked his parents, \u201cHave either of you ever been in love?\u201d\n\nOliver had just given me opal earrings for my birthday, suffered a lobster dinner on my behalf.\n\n\u201cOf course, son,\u201d he said, reaching back to tousle his hair.\n\nI couldn\u2019t stop wondering why Colt would ask us that.\n\n\u201cHe asks why we can\u2019t take vacation on a different planet. He asks why we can\u2019t drink saltwater. I wouldn\u2019t worry about this,\u201d Oliver said.\n\nWe were in the yard, the grass freshly mowed, mosquitoes biting freely as dusk unraveled. It was a Saturday, the night Oliver was allowed to get drunk. Colt was at a friend\u2019s house, observing marriages that were apparently stronger than mine.\n\n\u201cGive me a priss, kitty,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cStop worrying.\u201d\n\nI worried even more after that.\n\n\nI can see it now: Georgia in a souvenir T-shirt, a shade overweight, telling stories as if we\u2019ve been married for years. The three of them teasing me for voting Republican. \u201cI always knew there was a liberal in there somewhere,\u201d Colt will say. They will need a little less from me, a little more from each other; I in turn will need a little more from all of them.\n\nThey\u2019ll have cocktail hour while I drink club soda with lime. Georgia will mix vodka and grenadine, even though I\u2019ve told her it\u2019s tacky. She doesn\u2019t mind being teased, and she doesn\u2019t know how to be jealous, two of my favorite things about her. She indulges me when I need to talk about my married life. She knows how many buttons I had on my wedding dress. She knows that Oliver and I spent our wedding night at the Pioneer Hotel, with its misplaced neoclassical columns. The windows were jalousies, and there was only one towel in the bathroom. There was a folding screen, and I\u2019d felt obliged to change behind it, even though we\u2019d seen each other naked many times.\n\n\nI call Vivian to the bathroom after my shower. She is pleased. This is the kind of thing daughters-in-law do: they enter intimate spaces unflinchingly.\n\n\u201cTake a look at this mole,\u201d I tell her, pulling my robe away from my breast. \u201cI swear I didn\u2019t have it this morning.\u201d\n\nShe excuses herself to get her glasses from her handbag.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a mole, Judith. That\u2019s a tick.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like a mole.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s in there pretty deep.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, shit,\u201d I say. \u201cCan you get it out?\u201d\n\nFirst she tries tweezers, which I keep on a mirrored tray by the sink.\n\n\u201cThis fucker\u2019s really in there,\u201d she says.\n\nMy eyes are watery, my head hot.\n\n\u201cDo you think I might already have Lyme disease?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d she says, the first hint of a mother I\u2019ve ever seen in her.\n\nWhen Vivian worries the tweezers are making it worse, she asks Colt to bring matches. There are holes in the knees of her jeans, and her fingernails are painted gold. She has a scar on her arm from breaking a window when her father refused to give her his credit card. (She was, she has assured me, only twenty-two at the time.) This is the girl who holds a flame close to my skin.\n\nWhen she finally gets the tick out without starting a fire, I offer her fifty dollars. \u201cAn investment in your multilingual dog business.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust watch for a bull\u2019s-eye around the bite. If you see a bull\u2019s-eye, we\u2019ll need to go to the doctor in the morning,\u201d she says.\n\n\nI lie awake with all the lights on, watching for a bull\u2019s-eye.\n\nWhen Georgia can\u2019t sleep, I comb her hair. When I can\u2019t sleep, she tells me about her childhood. She has three older brothers. In their yard they had a set of dolphin-shaped swings that appeared to be caught by their chains. The Connecticut River sluiced the edge of their property. The swings were still there when Georgia drove me past the house this summer, but the place was dingy and run-down. One of the panes in the front door was sealed with a piece of cardboard, and someone had spray-painted the word keep on the side of the house.\n\n\u201cOh, well,\u201d Georgia said. \u201cMaybe some college students live there now.\u201d\n\nI could be that calm too, if I\u2019d never had to iron an impatient man\u2019s shirt or peel a soft-boiled egg for a screaming child. I am not the kind of woman who complains about the life she was meant to have: I was supposed to be handling shirts and eggs. My husband was supposed to be faithful.\n\nIn the years I was tending to Colt and Oliver, Georgia was serving her family as the quirky unmarried one. She drove her nieces and nephews to zoos. She bought them geodes and suspended prisms in their windows. If she ever meets my son, she will become his cheerful aunt. She\u2019s already read his novel twice.\n\n\u201cYou need to introduce me to Colt soon,\u201d she said recently. I was driving her home from the doctor\u2019s office. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of insulting.\u201d\n\n\u201cCould you turn the AC down? It\u2019s freezing in here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m too nice to give you a hard time about this, don\u2019t you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, but I laughed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, Judith. I\u2019m not afraid to piss you off.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t I know it,\u201d I said, but I am almost never mad at Georgia. It was Oliver who drew anger out of me. Oliver, capricious and unapologetic, a man who kept me guessing every day of our marriage.\n\nWhen we were first dating, I couldn\u2019t decide how to greet him. He never learned how to embrace. He let you press your body into his chest, but his arms were limp and useless. His firm handshake was so brief you couldn\u2019t tell if his skin was warm. That was me: choosing between one of his hands and two of his arms, weighing the trade-off, wanting more than I could get.\n\n",
        "story_a": "Judith had always found solace in routine. The morning light would filter through the lace curtains, casting delicate shadows on the kitchen floor as she brewed her coffee. The scent of freshly ground beans filled the air, mingling with the faint aroma of lavender from the garden. It was a small comfort, a daily ritual that anchored her amidst the chaos of a life recently upended by divorce.\n\nToday, as she stood by the window, cradling her mug, Judith watched the world outside with a sense of detachment. The oak tree in her front yard, its branches swaying gently in the autumn breeze, seemed to mock her with its steadfastness. She sipped her coffee, letting the warmth seep into her bones, and wondered how everything had changed so quickly.\n\nHer son, Ethan, had always been a quiet, introspective boy. Even now, as a grown man, there was an air of mystery about him that Judith could never quite penetrate. He had married young, to a woman named Lara, whose boldness and vivacity were a stark contrast to Ethan's reserved nature. Judith had never fully understood their dynamic, but she had accepted it, hoping that Lara's energy would draw Ethan out of his shell.\n\nIt was only after the divorce that Judith realized how little she truly knew her son. He had moved back in with her temporarily, bringing Lara with him. The house, once a sanctuary of calm, now buzzed with tension and unspoken words.\n\nJudith had never been one for confrontation, preferring to let things lie rather than stir the pot. But living with Ethan and Lara had forced her to confront the cracks in their relationship, cracks that mirrored her own failed marriage. She could see the strain in the way Lara's eyes darted away when Ethan spoke, the way Ethan's shoulders tensed whenever Lara entered the room.\n\nAnd then there was Georgia, the quirky neighbor who had moved in next door a few months ago. With her shock of curly red hair and penchant for eccentric clothing, Georgia was a breath of fresh air in Judith's otherwise staid existence. She had a way of seeing through Judith's carefully constructed facade, of piercing the veil of politeness that Judith wore like armor.\n\n\"Morning, Judith!\" Georgia called from her porch, waving a brightly colored scarf in greeting. Judith smiled and waved back, feeling a pang of gratitude for the woman's relentless cheerfulness.\n\nGeorgia had an uncanny ability to appear just when Judith needed her most. Whether it was a spontaneous invitation for tea or a quick chat over the garden fence, Georgia's presence was a balm to Judith's wounded soul.\n\n\"Got any plans for the day?\" Georgia asked, her voice carrying across the lawn.\n\nJudith shook her head. \"Just the usual, I suppose. Cleaning, cooking, trying to stay out of the way.\"\n\nGeorgia's eyes sparkled with mischief. \"Why don't you come over for a bit? I've got a new batch of herbal tea I want you to try. It's supposed to be great for stress.\"\n\nJudith hesitated, glancing back at the house. She could hear the faint murmur of Ethan and Lara's voices, muffled by the walls but still unmistakably strained. A part of her wanted to retreat, to bury herself in the familiar comfort of her routines. But another part, the part that had been slowly awakening since the divorce, urged her to step outside her comfort zone.\n\n\"Alright,\" she said, surprising herself with the firmness in her voice. \"I'll be over in a few minutes.\"\n\nGeorgia beamed. \"Great! I'll put the kettle on.\"\n\nAs Judith made her way next door, she couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation. It was a small thing, a simple visit to a neighbor, but it felt like a step toward something new, something different.\n\nGeorgia's house was a riot of color and eclectic decor, a stark contrast to Judith's own subdued home. The walls were adorned with vibrant tapestries and framed photographs, while the shelves overflowed with knick-knacks and mementos from Georgia's travels.\n\n\"Welcome to my humble abode,\" Georgia said with a flourish, leading Judith to the cozy kitchen nook. \"Sit, sit! I'll get the tea.\"\n\nJudith settled into a cushioned chair, taking in the whirlwind of sights and sounds around her. It was chaotic, but in a way that felt alive and invigorating.\n\n\"How are things at home?\" Georgia asked, setting a steaming cup of tea in front of Judith.\n\nJudith sighed, wrapping her hands around the warm mug. \"Complicated, as always. Ethan and Lara... I don't know. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around them.\"\n\nGeorgia nodded sympathetically. \"Relationships are tricky, aren't they? Sometimes it feels like no matter what you do, you can't get it right.\"\n\nJudith took a sip of the tea, savoring the soothing blend of herbs. \"I just wish I knew how to help them. How to fix things.\"\n\n\"Maybe it's not about fixing,\" Georgia said gently. \"Maybe it's about understanding. Sometimes, the best thing we can do is just be there, to listen and support without trying to solve everything.\"\n\nJudith pondered Georgia's words, feeling a flicker of hope. Perhaps she had been going about it all wrong, trying to mend what was broken instead of simply being present.\n\n\"You're right,\" she said softly. \"I've been so focused on trying to make things better that I haven't really been there for them.\"\n\nGeorgia smiled, reaching across the table to squeeze Judith's hand. \"It's never too late to start.\"\n\nJudith left Georgia's house with a renewed sense of purpose. She couldn't change the past, but she could be there for Ethan and Lara in the present. She could listen, support, and try to understand.\n\nThat evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Judith found herself in the kitchen, preparing dinner. The rhythmic chopping of vegetables was a soothing balm to her frayed nerves. She could hear Ethan and Lara in the living room, their voices low and strained.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Judith wiped her hands on a dish towel and made her way to the living room. Ethan looked up, surprise flickering in his eyes as she entered.\n\n\"Dinner will be ready soon,\" she said, her voice steady. \"But I was hoping we could talk for a bit first.\"\n\nLara glanced at Ethan, then back at Judith. \"Sure,\" she said cautiously.\n\nJudith sat down, feeling the weight of the moment. \"I know things have been difficult lately,\" she began, choosing her words carefully. \"And I know I haven't been the best at supporting you both. But I want to change that. I want to be here for you, to listen and understand.\"\n\nEthan's gaze softened, and for the first time in weeks, Judith saw a glimmer of the boy she had raised, the boy who had once confided in her about his hopes and fears.\n\n\"It's not easy,\" Ethan said quietly. \"Marriage, life... it's all so much harder than I thought it would be.\"\n\nLara nodded, her eyes filling with unshed tears. \"We've been struggling, trying to make things work, but it feels like we're just drifting further apart.\"\n\nJudith reached out, taking both their hands in hers. \"You're not alone in this. We can figure it out together.\"\n\nThey talked long into the night, sharing their fears, frustrations, and hopes. It was a beginning, a tentative step toward healing and understanding.\n\nIn the days that followed, Judith made a conscious effort to be more present, to truly listen and support without trying to fix everything. It wasn't always easy, and there were still moments of tension and uncertainty. But there was also a growing sense of connection, a fragile but genuine bond that began to form between them.\n\nOne afternoon, as Judith worked in her garden, she felt a presence beside her. Looking up, she saw Georgia, her ever-present smile lighting up her face.\n\n\"How's it going?\" Georgia asked, her eyes twinkling with curiosity.\n\nJudith wiped the sweat from her brow, feeling a sense of accomplishment. \"Better, I think. We're talking more, trying to understand each other. It's a slow process, but it feels like progress.\"\n\nGeorgia nodded approvingly. \"That's wonderful to hear. Sometimes, it's the small steps that make the biggest difference.\"\n\nJudith smiled, feeling a surge of gratitude for the woman who had become her friend and confidante. \"Thank you, Georgia. For everything.\"\n\nGeorgia waved off her thanks with a laugh. \"Oh, don't mention it. We're all just trying to figure this life thing out together, right?\"\n\nAs the weeks turned into months, Judith found herself growing more comfortable with the new rhythm of her life. She discovered strength she hadn't known she possessed, a resilience that carried her through the challenges she faced.\n\nEthan and Lara continued to navigate their own struggles, but there was a newfound openness between them. They began attending couples therapy, working through their issues with a determination that both impressed and humbled Judith.\n\nOne evening, as they sat around the dinner table, Lara reached for Judith's hand. \"Thank you,\" she said, her voice filled with sincerity. \"For being there for us, for believing in us.\"\n\nJudith felt a lump form in her throat, her heart swelling with emotion. \"I'm so proud of you both,\" she said, her voice trembling. \"You've come so far, and I know you'll continue to grow together.\"\n\nEthan squeezed her hand, his eyes shining with gratitude. \"We couldn't have done it without you, Mom.\"\n\nAs they shared a meal, laughter and conversation filling the air, Judith felt a sense of peace she hadn't known in a long time. The road ahead was still uncertain, but she knew they would face it together, with love and understanding guiding their way.\n\nLater that night, as she lay in bed, Judith reflected on the journey she had taken since her divorce. It had been a difficult and often painful path, but it had also been a journey of self-discovery and growth. She had found strength in herself and in the connections she had forged with those around her.\n\nAnd as she drifted off to sleep, the gentle rustle of the oak tree outside her window a comforting lullaby, Judith knew that she was exactly where she was meant to be.",
        "story_b": "Judith stood at the window, watching the early morning light pour over her garden. The garden was a recent endeavor, a patch of earth she could control and watch grow. The soil was rich and dark, a canvas upon which she could project her hopes and fears. Her heart, she mused, felt like a compass spinning wildly, seeking true north but never quite settling. It was still adjusting to the absence of her husband, the man who had been her constant companion for over thirty years.\n\nThe divorce had been amicable, as amicable as such things could be. They had simply grown apart, their lives diverging like two paths in the woods, each veering off into its own direction. Now, she was left to navigate the tangled web of her new life, her relationships unspooling in unexpected ways.\n\nHer son, David, and his wife, Claire, were her closest family. Yet, Judith often felt like an outsider in their vibrant world. Claire was bold, full of opinions and energy, her laughter echoing through their home like wind chimes in a storm. She challenged Judith's views on independence and family, sometimes with a sharpness that cut through Judith's carefully constructed defenses. But there was love there, too\u2014a fierce, protective love that Judith envied and admired.\n\nThen there was Georgia, the neighbor who had arrived shortly after the divorce, her entrance as sudden and colorful as a firework in the night sky. Georgia was everything Judith was not\u2014quirky, spontaneous, and unfiltered. She spoke in riddles and metaphors, her words a tapestry woven from dreams and reality. Despite\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014her eccentricities, Judith found comfort in Georgia\u2019s presence, a connection she hadn\u2019t realized she needed.\n\nJudith turned from the window, the scent of fresh paint mingling with the aroma of baked bread. She was renovating her home, stripping it down to its bones and rebuilding it, much like she was doing with her life. The walls echoed with the laughter of family gatherings past, a reminder of both comfort and confinement.\n\nThe doorbell rang, pulling Judith from her reverie. She opened the door to find David and Claire, their faces flushed from the cold. Claire carried a basket of fresh produce, her cheeks pink and her eyes alight with mischief.\n\n\u201cMom!\u201d David exclaimed, wrapping her in a warm embrace. His scent, a mix of pine and something distinctly him, filled her senses. \u201cWe brought some goodies from the market.\u201d\n\nJudith stepped aside, allowing them in. \u201cIt smells wonderful in here,\u201d Claire remarked, setting the basket on the counter. \u201cRenovations going well?\u201d\n\nJudith nodded, glancing around at the half-painted walls and the sheets covering the furniture. \u201cSlow but steady. It\u2019s a work in progress, just like me.\u201d\n\nClaire laughed, a sound like a bell. \u201cAren\u2019t we all?\u201d\n\nThey settled into the kitchen, the conversation flowing as easily as the coffee Judith poured. Yet, beneath the surface, Judith felt the familiar tug of isolation. It was as if she were standing on the edge of a family photograph, her presence acknowledged but somehow peripheral.\n\n\u201cHave you given any more thought to traveling with us this summer?\u201d David asked, breaking into her thoughts.\n\nJudith hesitated, the idea of joining them on their adventures both thrilling and terrifying. Claire\u2019s gaze was penetrating, as if she could see into Judith\u2019s very soul. \u201cIt could be fun,\u201d Claire suggested. \u201cA chance to explore and maybe even find a new direction.\u201d\n\nJudith forced a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d\n\nAfter they left, the silence of the house enveloped her. She wandered back to the window, her eyes drawn to the garden. A movement caught her attention\u2014Georgia, kneeling among the plants, her hands deep in the soil. Judith watched her for a moment, admiring the way Georgia seemed to converse with the earth, her touch gentle and knowing.\n\nJudith stepped outside, the crisp air carrying the scent of autumn. Georgia looked up, her face breaking into a wide grin. \u201cJudith! Come join me. The garden\u2019s got secrets to share today.\u201d\n\nJudith chuckled, kneeling beside her. \u201cWhat kind of secrets?\u201d\n\nGeorgia\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201cThe kind that grow in the dark and bloom in the light. Just like us, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\nThey worked in companionable silence, the soil cool and forgiving beneath their fingers. Judith found solace in the rhythm of planting, the act of nurturing life a balm for her restless heart.\n\n\u201cYour son and his wife seem lovely,\u201d Georgia remarked, her voice light but probing.\n\n\u201cThey are,\u201d Judith agreed, her mind drifting back to David and Claire. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026sometimes I feel like I\u2019m intruding in their lives. Like I\u2019m not quite sure where I fit anymore.\u201d\n\nGeorgia nodded, her expression thoughtful. \u201cFamilies are like gardens. They need tending, but they also need space to grow on their own. You\u2019ll find your place, Judith. Sometimes it just takes time.\u201d\n\nJudith pondered Georgia\u2019s words, the metaphor settling over her like a warm blanket. She had been so focused on what she had lost, she hadn\u2019t truly considered what she might gain.\n\nOver the following weeks, Judith found herself drawn more and more to her garden, and to Georgia. They shared stories and secrets, Georgia\u2019s quirky insights challenging Judith\u2019s long-held beliefs. It was in these moments that Judith felt a stirring of something new\u2014a sense of belonging not tethered to her past, but rooted in the present.\n\nOne stormy night, as rain lashed the windows and thunder rumbled overhead, Judith sat with Georgia in her cozy living room. The fire crackled, casting flickering shadows across the walls.\n\n\u201cThe sky\u2019s weeping with you,\u201d Georgia said softly, her gaze fixed on the storm outside. \u201cBut remember, Judith, every storm passes. And when it does, the air is clearer, the world refreshed.\u201d\n\nJudith nodded, her heart heavy with the weight of her emotions. \u201cI just feel so lost sometimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not lost,\u201d Georgia insisted. \u201cYou\u2019re exploring. And there\u2019s a difference.\u201d\n\nJudith let the words sink in, the truth of them resonating deep within her. She realized that her journey wasn\u2019t about finding her old self, but discovering who she was now\u2014beyond the roles of wife and mother, beyond the expectations she had set for herself.\n\nThe next morning, the storm had passed, leaving the world washed and new. Judith stood at her window, the garden glistening in the early sunlight. She felt a shift within her, a subtle realignment of priorities and desires.\n\nShe called David, her voice steady and clear. \u201cAbout that trip\u2026 I\u2019d like to join you and Claire this summer.\u201d\n\nHis response was immediate, his joy evident. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, Mom! It\u2019ll be an adventure.\u201d\n\nAfter the call, Judith stepped into the garden, her fingers brushing the leaves and petals, each touch grounding her in the here and now. She had spent so long feeling adrift, but now she sensed the solid earth beneath her feet, the promise of growth and renewal.\n\nHer heart, once a compass spinning wildly, had found its true north.\n\nAs summer approached, Judith embraced the changes in her life with a newfound confidence. Her relationship with David and Claire flourished, each interaction bringing them closer. She cherished the candid conversations they shared, the laughter and understanding that bridged the gaps between them.\n\nJudith\u2019s friendship with Georgia deepened as well, their time together a tapestry of shared wisdom and laughter. Georgia\u2019s garden became a sanctuary, a place where Judith could nurture both plants and her own evolving sense of self.\n\nOn the morning of their departure for the summer trip, Judith stood in her garden one last time, the sun warm on her skin. She felt a sense of peace, a quiet certainty that she was exactly where she needed to be.\n\nAs she joined David and Claire, their faces bright with anticipation, Judith realized that love and family were not defined by tradition, but by the connections they chose to nurture. She had found her place\u2014not as an outsider, but as an integral part of a vibrant, ever-evolving tapestry.\n\nAnd with each step she took, Judith embraced the promise of new beginnings, her heart open to the possibilities that lay ahead.",

See for us to qualify as terrorists we need to be using fear to enact change and we're just trying to kill that fake-ass not a king. We're not terrorists. We're assassins. Also your breath smells bad.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"...where are the other assassins?\\\" she asked, her hand didn't even twitch to check how rancid her breath smelled even though she must desperately want to.\\n\\n\\\"I've been here the last 2 days hanging out with you and the dumbass brigade who I have to say are not quite as smart as I thought they'd be, as a collective, I mean I knew they weren't always smart because the smart ones tend to get killed for figuring out leader McBitchyPissy the 3rd's antics. That being said, it's nice to know at least one of you has a heart.\\\"\\n\\nOh, she twitched at that.\\n\\n\\\"Which of the officers expressed sympathy at you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The one in uniform, of course. I mean really, it's more surprising you're not asking me about the little antics your boss gets-OH you help him! Oh, that's some real kinky shit, if it's true.

Probably because I think the terrorists don't care about infrastructure and assassins are really a lot more clean, even though there's definitely going to be a deadly civil war after we kill the king.

I know it's day but there's nothing wrong with catching a few extra hours so you can better topple a tyrant.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where do they feel safe enough to rest?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Probably nowhere if we're being honest.

Almost like it'd be easier to kill the king rather than leave the city. Hey! Look at that, I really do think that. I wasn't always sure but this is actually really helpful. I wonder if they could do this with therapy! It'd make things go so much faster. And let's face it, all the blood on my hands? I'll definitely need it. I assume you must take a hit of this every now and then, or does suppressing all the blood on your hands mean you can't? I'm sure you've killed at least a dozen, right?

        "story_a": "\"That was a simple curse for our interrogation, you can no longer lie.\"\n\nI blinked at the sorceress, feeling a twinge of panic. \"That is evil, especially because I lie so often, like when I said your shirt looked nice but I actually thought it was ugly as hell.\"\n\nShe raised an eyebrow, her lips curling into an amused smirk. \"Oversharing is not a part of the curse, that is just you.\"\n\nI grimaced, realizing that my mouth had a mind of its own now. The curse had stripped away the thin veil of social niceties I\u2019d always hidden behind, leaving me raw and exposed. I glanced around the dimly lit chamber, its stone walls adorned with flickering torches casting ominous shadows. The air smelled of dampness and old magic.\n\nThe sorceress, Elara, leaned closer, her eyes narrowing. \"Now, tell me, where is the Amulet of Aranthor?\"\n\nI felt a sharp pang of dread as the compulsion to speak the truth surged through me. \"I don\u2019t know.\"\n\nHer expression darkened. \"Lies won't work here, remember?\"\n\n\"I\u2019m not lying,\" I blurted out. \"I really don\u2019t know where it is. I was only hired to distract you while my partner retrieved it.\"\n\nElara's eyes widened slightly, a flicker of surprise crossing her face. She hadn\u2019t expected me to be so forthcoming, and honestly, neither had I. But the curse was relentless, dragging every morsel of honesty to the surface.\n\n\"And where is your partner now?\" she demanded.\n\nI sighed, my shoulders slumping. \"Probably halfway to the border by now. We had a plan to meet at the old mill just outside of town. I was supposed to stall you for as long as possible.\"\n\nElara\u2019s jaw tightened, her fingers drumming impatiently on the wooden table between us. \"Who is your partner? Give me a name.\"\n\n\"His name is Jareth,\" I said, feeling the words tumble out against my will. \"He\u2019s a master thief, much better at this than I am.\"\n\nHer eyes gleamed with satisfaction. \"Thank you for your cooperation. You\u2019ve been surprisingly helpful.\"\n\nMy face flushed with frustration and helplessness. \"I didn\u2019t want to help you. I hate this curse. It\u2019s like my brain and my mouth are disconnected.\"\n\nElara chuckled softly, standing up from her chair. \"Consider it a lesson. Perhaps you\u2019ll think twice before getting involved in matters beyond your understanding.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" I muttered, glancing down at the table. \"Just get it over with. I know what comes next.\"\n\nShe paused, her expression softening ever so slightly. \"Actually, I have another idea.\"\n\nI looked up, confusion etched on my face. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nElara walked around the table, her footsteps echoing in the chamber. \"You\u2019ve given me valuable information, and for that, I\u2019m willing to offer you a deal.\"\n\n\"A deal?\" I repeated skeptically. \"What kind of deal?\"\n\n\"I'll lift the curse,\" she said, her voice calm and measured. \"In return, you will help me retrieve the Amulet of Aranthor and bring Jareth to justice.\"\n\nI stared at her, my mind racing. Betraying Jareth wasn\u2019t part of the plan, but the thought of being free from this curse was tempting. \"And if I refuse?\"\n\n\"Then you\u2019ll remain cursed,\" she said simply, \"and I\u2019ll ensure that your life becomes very uncomfortable.\"\n\nI clenched my fists, weighing my options. There was no way I could live like this, constantly spilling my guts without control. I took a deep breath, feeling the weight of the decision. \"Fine. I\u2019ll help you.\"\n\nElara nodded, a faint smile playing on her lips. \"Good choice. Now, let\u2019s lift that curse.\"\n\nShe muttered an incantation, her hands weaving intricate patterns in the air. I felt a tingling sensation wash over me, and suddenly, the compulsion to speak the truth was gone. I sighed in relief, my mind finally at ease.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said, my voice steady. \"So, what\u2019s the plan?\"\n\nElara\u2019s eyes sparkled with determination. \"We\u2019ll head to the old mill and intercept Jareth. With your help, we\u2019ll retrieve the amulet and put an end to his schemes.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a sense of resolve building within me. \"Alright, let\u2019s do this.\"\n\nAs we left the chamber and made our way through the winding corridors of the castle, I couldn\u2019t help but feel a strange sense of camaraderie with Elara. Despite our initial confrontation, we were now bound by a common goal. The night was dark and full of uncertainties, but for the first time, I felt a glimmer of hope.\n\nWe reached the castle gates, the cool night air brushing against our faces. Elara glanced at me, her expression serious. \"Remember, this won\u2019t be easy. Jareth is cunning and dangerous.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I replied, determination in my voice. \"But we\u2019ll get that amulet back.\"\n\nWith that, we set off into the night, ready to face the challenges ahead. The path was uncertain, but I was no longer alone. Together, we would confront the lies and deceit, and perhaps, find a way to weave truth into the heart of our journey.",
        "story_b": "\u201cThat was a simple curse for our interrogation, you can no longer lie.\u201d\n\nI blinked, trying to process the words. \u201cThat is evil, especially because I lie so often, like when I said your shirt looked nice but I actually thought it was ugly as hell.\u201d\n\nThe interrogator raised an eyebrow. \u201cOversharing is not a part of the curse, that is just you.\u201d\n\nI groaned, feeling the weight of the curse settling in. The room around me was stark and clinical, the cold metal chair I was strapped to only adding to my discomfort. The fluorescent light above flickered intermittently, casting harsh shadows across the room. My mind raced, trying to find a way out of this mess.\n\n\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d I asked, my voice trembling slightly.\n\nThe interrogator, a tall man with a stern expression and piercing blue eyes, leaned forward. \u201cYou\u2019re here because you have information we need. Information you\u2019ve been hiding.\u201d\n\nI swallowed hard. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\n\u201cLies won\u2019t work on me anymore,\u201d he said, a cruel smile playing on his lips. \u201cSo, let\u2019s start with something simple. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\nI opened my mouth to lie, but the curse kicked in. \u201cEvelyn,\u201d I muttered, cursing myself internally. \n\n\u201cGood. Now, what were you doing at the docks last night?\u201d\n\nMy mind flashed back to the previous night, the clandestine meeting, the exchange of information. I tried to resist, but the curse forced the truth out of me. \u201cI was meeting with a contact. We were discussing plans for an upcoming operation.\u201d\n\nThe interrogator\u2019s smile widened. \u201cSee, that wasn\u2019t so hard, was it?\u201d\n\nI clenched my fists, the restraints biting into my skin. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re doing,\u201d I spat. \u201cThis curse... it\u2019s not just about lying. It\u2019s about control.\u201d\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, studying me. \u201cTell me more.\u201d\n\nI hesitated, but the words spilled out of me regardless. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that I can\u2019t lie. It\u2019s that I can\u2019t stop talking. Everything, every little thought, it just... comes out.\u201d\n\nHis eyes gleamed with interest. \u201cInteresting. So, you\u2019re saying that this curse not only prevents you from lying but also compels you to speak the truth at all times?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said through gritted teeth. \u201cAnd it\u2019s driving me insane.\u201d\n\nThe interrogator stood up and walked around the room, his footsteps echoing off the walls. \u201cWell, Evelyn, I think we\u2019re going to have a very productive session.\u201d\n\nI watched him warily as he approached a table covered in various interrogation tools. He picked up a small, silver device and turned it over in his hands. \u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d\n\nI shook my head, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\n\u201cThis is a truth serum,\u201d he said, holding it up for me to see. \u201cBut given your current predicament, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need it.\u201d\n\nHe set the device back down and returned to his chair. \u201cNow, let\u2019s get to the heart of the matter. Who are you working for?\u201d\n\nThe answer was on the tip of my tongue, but I fought to keep it in. The curse, however, had other plans. \u201cThe Resistance,\u201d I blurted out, feeling a surge of panic.\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d the interrogator said, leaning forward once more. \u201cAnd what is your role within the Resistance?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a strategist,\u201d I said, unable to stop myself. \u201cI plan operations, coordinate with other cells, gather intelligence.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, taking notes on a small pad of paper. \u201cAnd what are your current plans?\u201d\n\nI bit my lip, trying to hold back, but it was no use. \u201cWe\u2019re planning a raid on the government\u2019s weapons depot. We need supplies, and it\u2019s the only way to get them.\u201d\n\nThe interrogator\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhen is this raid supposed to take place?\u201d\n\nMy mind screamed at me to stop, but the curse forced the words out. \u201cTomorrow night. Midnight.\u201d\n\nHe smiled, satisfied with the information. \u201cThank you, Evelyn. You\u2019ve been very helpful.\u201d\n\nI slumped in my chair, feeling defeated. The curse had stripped me of my ability to resist, to protect my comrades. I had betrayed them all with my uncontrollable honesty.\n\nThe interrogator stood up and walked to the door, opening it slightly. \u201cGuards, take her back to her cell,\u201d he ordered.\n\nTwo burly guards entered the room and unstrapped me from the chair. They led me down a long, dimly lit corridor, the walls lined with doors leading to other interrogation rooms. I could hear the faint sounds of other prisoners being questioned, their cries of pain and desperation echoing through the hall.\n\nAs we walked, my mind raced, trying to come up with a plan. I couldn\u2019t let the Resistance\u2019s plans be thwarted because of me. I needed to warn them, to find a way to communicate the danger.\n\nThe guards threw me into a small, windowless cell and slammed the door shut. I sat on the cold, hard floor, my thoughts swirling in a chaotic mess. The silence was deafening, and my thoughts were my only company.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long I sat there, my mind drifting in and out of focus. Time seemed to stretch and warp, the minutes blending into hours. The curse weighed heavily on me, the compulsion to speak the truth gnawing at my sanity.\n\nJust when I thought I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, the door to my cell creaked open. A figure stepped inside, cloaked in shadow. I squinted, trying to make out their features.\n\n\u201cEvelyn,\u201d a familiar voice whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\n\nMy heart leaped in my chest. It was Marcus, one of my closest friends and a fellow member of the Resistance. \u201cMarcus, how did you find me?\u201d\n\nHe knelt beside me, his eyes filled with concern. \u201cWe have our ways. Are you okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted, feeling the curse compel me to speak. \u201cI\u2019m not okay. I told them everything, Marcus. The raid, our plans... everything.\u201d\n\nHe placed a reassuring hand on my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Evelyn. We know about the curse. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nI looked at him, hope flickering in my chest. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to get you out,\u201d he said, a determined glint in his eyes. \u201cAnd to stop the raid. We can\u2019t let them win.\u201d\n\nTears welled up in my eyes as I realized I wasn\u2019t alone. Despite the curse, despite my betrayal, my friends hadn\u2019t given up on me. \u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered.\n\nHe smiled, helping me to my feet. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We have work to do.\u201d\n\nAs we made our way out of the facility, I felt a renewed sense of purpose. The curse may have taken away my ability to lie, but it hadn\u2019t taken away my resolve. We would fight back, and we would win.\n\nAnd this time, I wouldn\u2019t let anything stand in our way.",

The curse had stripped away the thin veil of social niceties I\u2019d always hidden behind, leaving me raw and exposed. I glanced around the dimly lit chamber, its stone walls adorned with flickering torches casting ominous shadows. The air smelled of dampness and old magic.\n\nThe sorceress, Elara, leaned closer, her eyes narrowing. \"Now, tell me, where is the Amulet of Aranthor?\"\n\nI felt a sharp pang of dread as the compulsion to speak the truth surged through me. \"I don\u2019t know.\"\n\nHer expression darkened. \"Lies won't work here, remember?\"\n\n\"I\u2019m not lying,\" I blurted out. \"I really don\u2019t know where it is.

She hadn\u2019t expected me to be so forthcoming, and honestly, neither had I. But the curse was relentless, dragging every morsel of honesty to the surface.\n\n\"And where is your partner now?\" she demanded.\n\nI sighed, my shoulders slumping. \"Probably halfway to the border by now. We had a plan to meet at the old mill just outside of town. I was supposed to stall you for as long as possible.\"\n\nElara\u2019s jaw tightened, her fingers drumming impatiently on the wooden table between us. \"Who is your partner? Give me a name.\"\n\n\"His name is Jareth,\" I said, feeling the words tumble out against my will. \"He\u2019s a master thief, much better at this than I am.\"\n\nHer eyes gleamed with satisfaction. \"Thank you for your cooperation.

Perhaps you\u2019ll think twice before getting involved in matters beyond your understanding.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" I muttered, glancing down at the table. \"Just get it over with. I know what comes next.\"\n\nShe paused, her expression softening ever so slightly. \"Actually, I have another idea.\"\n\nI looked up, confusion etched on my face. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nElara walked around the table, her footsteps echoing in the chamber. \"You\u2019ve given me valuable information, and for that, I\u2019m willing to offer you a deal.\"\n\n\"A deal?\" I repeated skeptically. \"What kind of deal?\"\n\n\"I'll lift the curse,\" she said, her voice calm and measured. \"In return, you will help me retrieve the Amulet of Aranthor and bring Jareth to justice.\"\n\nI stared at her, my mind racing. Betraying Jareth wasn\u2019t part of the plan, but the thought of being free from this curse was tempting. \"And if I refuse?\"\n\n\"Then you\u2019ll remain cursed,\" she said simply, \"and I\u2019ll ensure that your life becomes very uncomfortable.\"\n\nI clenched my fists, weighing my options. There was no way I could live like this, constantly spilling my guts without control. I took a deep breath, feeling the weight of the decision. \"Fine.

Now, let\u2019s lift that curse.\"\n\nShe muttered an incantation, her hands weaving intricate patterns in the air. I felt a tingling sensation wash over me, and suddenly, the compulsion to speak the truth was gone. I sighed in relief, my mind finally at ease.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said, my voice steady. \"So, what\u2019s the plan?\"\n\nElara\u2019s eyes sparkled with determination. \"We\u2019ll head to the old mill and intercept Jareth. With your help, we\u2019ll retrieve the amulet and put an end to his schemes.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a sense of resolve building within me. \"Alright, let\u2019s do this.\"\n\nAs we left the chamber and made our way through the winding corridors of the castle, I couldn\u2019t help but feel a strange sense of camaraderie with Elara. Despite our initial confrontation, we were now bound by a common goal. The night was dark and full of uncertainties, but for the first time, I felt a glimmer of hope.\n\nWe reached the castle gates, the cool night air brushing against our faces. Elara glanced at me, her expression serious. \"Remember, this won\u2019t be easy. Jareth is cunning and dangerous.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I replied, determination in my voice. \"But we\u2019ll get that amulet back.\"\n\nWith that, we set off into the night, ready to face the challenges ahead. The path was uncertain, but I was no longer alone. Together, we would confront the lies and deceit, and perhaps, find a way to weave truth into the heart of our journey.",

The chair beneath me was cold, its metal biting into my flesh through the thin fabric of my clothes. The lights, harsh and unyielding, glared down on me, casting long shadows that seemed to mock my predicament.\n\nI couldn't lie. Not anymore. Not since they\u2019d slapped that curse on me, a curse that stripped away my most reliable defense. Honesty had never been my strong suit; lies were my armor, my survival strategy. Without them, I was exposed, vulnerable.\n\n\"Let's start with something simple,\" the interrogator said, leaning forward. His face was a mask of indifference, but his eyes gleamed with a predatory curiosity. \"Why did you do it?\"\n\nMy mind raced, searching for an acceptable version of the truth. \"I... I didn't mean to hurt anyone,\" I began, my voice trembling. \"It was just... necessary.\"\n\nThe interrogator raised an eyebrow. \"Necessary? Explain.\"\n\nI took a deep breath, the memory surfacing unbidden. It was three months ago, in a dimly lit bar on the outskirts of town. I was meeting with a contact, someone who had information I desperately needed. But the deal went south, and before I knew it, I was running, my heart pounding in my chest, the weight of my lies dragging me down.\n\n\"I needed information,\" I said, my voice steadier now. \"And the only way to get it was to lie. I told him I was someone else, someone trustworthy. It was the only way.\"\n\nThe interrogator nodded, jotting down notes. \"And what happened next?\"\n\n\"I panicked,\" I confessed. \"I got what I needed, but he realized I was lying. I had to run, and in the chaos, someone got hurt. I didn't mean for it to happen, but it did.\"\n\nThere it was, the truth laid bare. It felt like ripping off a bandage, the wound underneath raw and exposed. The interrogator seemed satisfied for now, but I knew there was more to come, more truths that would be dragged out of me, kicking and screaming.\n\n\"Let's talk about your past,\" he said, his tone casual, as if discussing the weather. \"Why do you lie so often?\"\n\nI sighed, the memories swirling in my mind like a dark cloud. \"It started when I was a kid,\" I admitted. \"My parents... they weren't exactly the nurturing type. Lies were a way to protect myself, to avoid their wrath. It became a habit, something I couldn't shake, even when I grew older.\"\n\nI remembered the sting of my father's belt, the cold indifference of my mother's gaze. Lies were my shield, the only thing that kept me safe. But now, stripped of that shield, I felt naked, exposed.\n\n\"And how has that affected your relationships?\" the interrogator asked, his voice probing.\n\nI laughed bitterly. \"What relationships? I've pushed everyone away. Friends, lovers, family... they're all gone. No one trusts a liar, and I don't blame them.\"\n\nThe interrogator scribbled more notes, his expression unreadable. \"Do you regret it?\" he asked, his voice softer now, almost gentle.\n\nI hesitated, the question hanging in the air. Did I regret it? The lies had cost me so much, but they'd also kept me alive. It was a double-edged sword, one that had cut me as deeply as it had protected me.\n\n\"Yes,\" I finally said, my voice barely above a whisper. \"I regret it. But I don't know how to live any other way.\"\n\nThe interrogator leaned back, his eyes boring into mine. \"This curse,\" he said slowly, \"it could be a blessing in disguise. A chance to start over, to be honest for once in your life.\"\n\nI snorted, the bitterness rising again. \"Honesty is overrated. People say they want the truth, but they can't handle it. Lies are what keep the world spinning, what keep us sane.\"\n\nThe interrogator's gaze softened, and for a moment, I saw a flicker of understanding. \"Perhaps,\" he said quietly. \"But now, you have no choice.\"\n\nThe silence that followed was oppressive, the weight of my confession hanging in the air. I could feel the curse pulsing within me, a constant reminder of my newfound honesty. It was a prison of my own making, one that I couldn't escape.\n\n\"What's next?\" I asked, my voice hollow.\n\nThe interrogator stood, gathering his notes. \"Next, you face the consequences,\" he said simply. \"But remember, this is also an opportunity. Use it wisely.\"\n\nHe left the room, the door closing with a finality that echoed in my soul. I was alone, the silence pressing in on me from all sides. The curse was a constant presence, a reminder that I could no longer hide behind my lies.\n\nI thought about my past, the web of deceit I'd woven to protect myself. Each lie had been a thread, binding me tighter and tighter until I could no longer breathe. Now, those threads were unraveling, leaving me exposed and vulnerable.\n\nBut maybe, just maybe, the interrogator was right. Perhaps this curse was a chance to start over, to face my demons and find a new way to live. It was a terrifying thought, one that filled me with both dread and hope.\n\nAs I sat in that sterile, cold room, I made a silent promise to myself. I would try. I would face the truth, no matter how painful it might be. The future was uncertain, and the path ahead was shrouded in darkness. But for the first time in my life, I would walk it with honesty, one step at a time.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, I would find a way to heal.",

        "story_b": "As soon as the words left the interrogator's lips, I felt a strange tingle in my throat, like a truth serum had just been injected into my veins. My eyes widened as the realization hit me\u2014this was going to be a disaster.\n\n\"That is evil, especially because I lie so often, like when I said your shirt looked nice but I actually thought it was ugly as hell.\" The words tumbled out before I could stop them, my mouth seemingly disconnected from my brain. The interrogator raised an eyebrow, a bemused smile playing on his lips.\n\n\"Oversharing is not a part of the curse, that is just you,\" he remarked, clearly enjoying my predicament. \n\nI groaned internally. My life was built on a carefully constructed web of little white lies. How was I supposed to navigate a world where honesty was my only option? My mind raced through the implications as I left the interrogation room, the door clicking shut behind me.\n\nThe first hurdle came almost immediately. I bumped into Karen, my overly inquisitive colleague, in the hallway. She was infamous for her daily barrage of questions about everything from work to my personal life.\n\n\"Hey! How was your weekend?\" she chirped, her eyes bright with curiosity.\n\nI opened my mouth to respond, and before I could even think, \"I spent the weekend binge-watching reality TV and eating an entire tub of ice cream,\" slipped out. My eyes widened as Karen giggled, a knowing smirk on her face.\n\n\"Oh, sounds productive,\" she teased, clearly relishing my discomfort.\n\nI hurried away, my face burning with embarrassment. This was only the beginning, I realized with a sinking feeling.\n\nBy lunchtime, the curse had already wreaked havoc. My friend Mike and I were sitting in the cafeteria, and he asked me what I thought of his new haircut. It was a disaster\u2014a lopsided mess of uneven strands that looked like it had been styled by a blindfolded toddler.\n\n\"It's terrible,\" I blurted out, my hand flying to my mouth in shock. Mike's face fell, and I scrambled to recover. \"But, uh, it's really... unique?\"\n\nMike chuckled, shaking his head. \"Well, at least you're honest,\" he said, though his eyes betrayed a hint of hurt.\n\nThe afternoon dragged on, each interaction a minefield of potential truth bombs. By the time I got home, I was exhausted from the effort of not speaking. I collapsed onto the couch, hoping for some respite from my newfound honesty.\n\nBut the universe had other plans. My phone buzzed with a text from my sister, asking me to babysit my nephew the next day. Normally, I would have concocted some excuse about being too busy, but now...\n\n\"Sure, I'd love to!\" I typed back, internally cursing myself for the enthusiastic punctuation. Babysitting was not my idea of a fun time, but the curse had left me no choice.\n\nThe next morning, I arrived at my sister's house, greeted by the chaos of a toddler's world. Toys were strewn across the floor, and my nephew, Max, was running around with boundless energy.\n\n\"Uncle!\" he squealed, barreling into my legs with a force that nearly toppled me over.\n\n\"Hey, buddy,\" I said, ruffling his hair. His wide-eyed innocence was a refreshing change from the tangled web of adult interactions.\n\nAs the day wore on, I found myself enjoying Max's company more than I expected. He had no need for lies or pretense, living in a world of pure, unfiltered truth. It was both terrifying and liberating.\n\n\"Why is your hair like that?\" Max asked suddenly, his tiny fingers pointing at my head.\n\nI laughed, the sound surprising me. \"Because I haven't had a chance to cut it,\" I admitted, realizing how freeing it felt to be honest with someone who didn't judge.\n\nBy the time my sister returned, I was sprawled on the floor, surrounded by toys and giggling uncontrollably with Max. She raised an eyebrow at the sight, clearly taken aback.\n\n\"Wow, I didn't expect you to be having so much fun,\" she remarked, a note of surprise in her voice.\n\nI grinned, the curse momentarily forgotten. \"Turns out, honesty isn't so bad when you're around someone who doesn't care about appearances.\"\n\nAs I drove home, the weight of the curse felt lighter, like I'd found a loophole in its strict grasp. Maybe there was something to be gained from this enforced honesty after all.\n\nThe following day, I walked into work with a newfound sense of clarity. The curse was still there, lurking beneath the surface, but I felt more equipped to handle its challenges.\n\nKaren accosted me again, her eyes twinkling with mischief. \"So, did you do anything exciting yesterday?\" she asked.\n\nI smiled, ready for her this time. \"I babysat my nephew, and it was actually... really fun,\" I replied, a genuine warmth in my voice.\n\nKaren's expression softened, and she nodded approvingly. \"See? Being honest isn't the end of the world.\"\n\nI continued through the day, navigating conversations with a mix of caution and curiosity. The curse had forced me to confront my own fears about honesty, peeling back layers of social niceties that had once felt necessary.\n\nBy the time I got home, I felt a strange sense of accomplishment. The curse hadn't disappeared, but I'd learned to live with it, embracing the chaos it brought. Maybe my life didn't need to be built on white lies and half-truths.\n\nAs I settled onto the couch, my phone buzzed with a message from Mike.\n\n\"Thanks for being honest about my haircut. I got it fixed today. Drinks on me?\"\n\nI chuckled, typing back a quick response. The curse had been a catalyst, forcing me to reassess what mattered and what didn't. In the end, I realized that honesty, while brutal, had its perks\u2014like finally getting my boss to admit he hated his own tie collection.",

They talk the politics you expect on the Upper West Side of New York, except when Ilka is talking to them about her cousin Frieda Fishgoppel, professor of philosophy, now emerita.\n\nIlka says, \u201cThe dream is something to do with our most recent reconciliation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy reconcile when you know that you will keep quarrelling?\u201d Farah asks.\n\n\u201cOur project,\u201d Ilka says, \u201cis to be reconciled to quarrelling.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why do you keep the argument going?\u201d asks Ruth, the bona-fide retired activist. \u201cYou disagree with everything she stands for and disbelieve what she believes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd believe,\u201d Ilka says, \u201cin her inalienable right to believe what I disagree with. It\u2019s in the nature, on my part certainly, of a demonstration, proof that we live in a democracy where people\u2014and people we love\u2014may have different, have wrong, opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she is game to let you keep disagreeing?\u201d asks Bridget.\n\n\u201cNnnnno,\u201d Ilka says rather slowly. \u201cBut I like, I love, the intelligible, passionate language in which she disagrees. Frieda is in love with her truths in a way I do not love mine. And you all know that she was my ticket to America\u2014my old ur-story.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell it again,\u201d the friends say, and settle themselves on their chairs.\n\n\u201cAfter the end of the war,\u201d Ilka says, \u201cFrieda searched for the western, Viennese branch of our family. The generation of the grandparents who weren\u2019t dead of old age had been killed in the camps, but there were cousins who had emigrated to Uruguay, to Paraguay, to the Dominican Republic, to Argentina. An uncle went to Canada. Frieda sent the visa for me to come to New York. She settled me in her funny little apartment in Washington Heights\u2014in the fifties, there were so many of us we called it Washingstein Heights. She handed me an Oxford English Dictionary and hurried back to New Haven for her exams. She would come in to see if I was O.K., bring me \u2018David Copperfield\u2019 or a Jane Austen. I had arrived speaking minimal English, but all the refugees were soon reading novels in English, though maybe not the Henry James that Frieda brought me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was her field?\u201d Ruth asks.\n\n\u201cFrieda\u2019s first Ph.D. was in literature, and her dissertation was about antisemitism in her favorite writings from\u2014I don\u2019t exactly remember\u2014was it \u2018Beowulf\u2019 to Eliot?\n\n\u201cFrieda and I still e-mail. If we don\u2019t hear from each other, we worry. \u2018The earth is flat and has four sharp corners,\u2019 she writes me. \u2018It\u2019s easy to drop off the edge.\u2019 She has not replied to my last, and so I promptly assume that she has fallen! She is in emergency! Or, this time, did I go too far?\u201d\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\n\u201cBut what about?\u2019\u2019 Bridget asks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to remember\u2014what were we saying on the bus in Jerusalem?\u201d Ilka muses. \u201cFrieda and I were travelling with a group of Americans\u2014that was in the eighties. We were sitting, talking, and she remembers that I got up and walked away and that I got off the bus. I remember that we did not talk for the last leg of the trip. We didn\u2019t get together back in New York until Lotte invited both of us to dinner. She left us in a room together with the door shut, and Frieda and I started to laugh. You and I, we said to each other, we don\u2019t have to go on doing this. You know what I will say, and I know what you are going to answer. But to this day we are still arguing the same opposing politics without having made a dent in each other\u2019s opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer wrong opinion, which leads her to vote on the wrong side,\u201d Ruth says.\n\n\u201cWhich she believes to be the right side as fully as she believes that yours and mine is wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you know the disastrous consequences of hers,\u201d Ruth says.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I walked off the bus, I suppose,\u201d says Ilka.\n\n\u201cBut you go on talking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe go on talking.\u201d\n\nBridget says, \u201cYou keep not telling us what you argue about.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I am more interested in the fact, the nature, of disagreement,\u201d Ilka says. \u201cAlso, it keeps the conversation from going to Israel, though Frieda says, correctly I think, that \u2018to not go there\u2019 is to silence speech.\u201d\n\nRuth asks, \u201cSo exactly what is the dispute?\u201d\n\nIlka says, \u201cOne way of putting it is that I choose to think of myself as a humanist, a child of Adam, where Frieda thinks of herself as a child of God-chosen Abraham. The DNA, as she says, will be the same.\n\n\u201cI search for what Isaac, the progenitor of Israel, has in common with his brother Ishmael, progenitor of Canaan: They both laugh if you tickle them and bleed when you prick them, which drives poor Frieda frantic. She says Shakespeare probably never met a Jew in his life. She challenges\u2014no, she demolishes\u2014my dearest belief, that it\u2019s the imagination which could save the world, that if we imagined our neighbor\u2019s griefs we would not do to him what we don\u2019t want him to do to us. Frieda says that, having imagined what it\u2019s like to be the abused Jew, Shakespeare confiscates half his fortune, hounds him ignominiously off the stage, and makes him convert.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to open a bottle of wine,\u201d Farah says. \u201cIlka, go on.\u201d\n\nIlka says, \u201cFrieda argues that the basis for our innate difference is my inclination for seeing sameness where hers is for seeing distinctions. Where I search for harmony in equality, she sees how one thing\u2014one people, history, ethos\u2014is distinct from another. Frieda says that for me distinctions spell the disruption of harmony; that, for her, harmony is a lie where distinction is present.\n\n\u201c \u2018Harmony?\u2019 I holler. \u2018What, me? Aren\u2019t I your favorite contrarian, your in-house skeptic who tests your every certainty by opposing my uncertainties? Do, please, notice,\u2019 I tell her, \u2018that I end with my universal question mark.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut then she asked if I and you\u2014my \u2018Lunch Ladies\u2019\u2014still vote on the left, and I said, \u2018You bet,\u2019 and we were back on the bus, you see. I e-mailed her: \u2018I\u2019m discouraged.\u2019 She answered, \u2018For the record (if there is a record) I feel terrible, not simply discouraged but terrible.\u2019\n\n\u201cI wrote her, \u2018I don\u2019t know if it will ease your distress, but I reconfirm my love and friendship if you will accept them with the acceptance also of our irreconcilable differences, which are totally unchanged after half a century\u2019s disputation.\n\n\u201cShe answered, \u2018Noted. Confirmed and renewed.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIlka says, \u201cAnd then I dreamed that there was something essential that has to be prevented.\u201d \u2666\n\n",
        "story_a": "In the liminal space between consciousness and oblivion, Maria found herself in a vast expanse of nothingness, a shimmering, dreamlike landscape where the air itself seemed to pulse with an otherworldly glow. She could feel her heart beating against her ribcage, a rhythmic drum that synchronized with the distant hum of the void. She looked around, trying to orient herself, but there was no horizon, no sky, no ground\u2014just an endless continuum of muted light and shadow.\n\nThen, she saw him. Samuel, her dearest friend, stood at a distance, his figure clear and sharp against the nebulous backdrop. He was waving at her, a frantic motion that spoke of urgency and desperation. She started towards him, her steps slow at first, but then quicker, more determined. But with each stride, the space between them seemed to stretch, an elastic chasm that refused to close.\n\n\"Maria!\" Samuel's voice cut through the silence, a plaintive cry that made her heart ache. \"I need to tell you something. It's important.\"\n\nShe tried to shout back, but her voice was swallowed by the vastness, her words dissipating into the ether. Frustration welled up inside her, a familiar companion in their recent conversations, where dialogues often turned into debates, and debates into arguments. They had once shared a singular vision of the world, a tapestry woven from shared experiences and dreams. But lately, their threads had frayed, pulled apart by the weight of their diverging beliefs.\n\nAn abyss yawned suddenly between them, a dark, gaping maw that seemed to absorb all light and sound. Maria hesitated at its edge, the chasm too wide, too deep to traverse. She could see Samuel on the other side, his face lined with worry, his eyes pleading.\n\n\"Maria, please!\" he called, his voice trembling. \"You have to listen.\"\n\nShe knew that she had to reach him, that something critical hinged on this message. But how? The abyss was impassable, a physical manifestation of the emotional distance that had grown between them. She took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and took a leap of faith. But instead of falling, she found herself suspended, floating weightlessly across the divide. When she landed on the other side, Samuel was there, his face a mixture of relief and apprehension.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said quietly, his voice raw with emotion. \"I didn't know if you'd come.\"\n\n\"Of course, I would,\" she replied, her tone softer than she intended. \"What is it, Samuel? What's so urgent?\"\n\nHe reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, crumpled piece of paper. \"It's about us,\" he said, handing it to her. \"About everything we've been through. I need you to understand.\"\n\nShe unfolded the paper, her eyes scanning the hastily written words. It was a letter, a confession of sorts, filled with memories of their shared past, moments of joy and sorrow, and a heartfelt plea for reconciliation. As she read, tears filled her eyes, blurring the ink on the page.\n\n\"Samuel,\" she whispered, her voice choked with emotion. \"Why didn't you just tell me this before?\"\n\n\"I tried,\" he said, his voice breaking. \"But every time I did, we ended up fighting. I didn't know how to bridge the gap between us.\"\n\nShe looked at him, her heart aching with a mixture of love and regret. \"I miss you,\" she said simply. \"I miss us.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" he replied, his eyes glistening. \"But we can't keep pretending that our differences don't matter. We have to find a way to coexist, to respect each other's beliefs, even if we can't agree on everything.\"\n\nMaria nodded, a heavy sigh escaping her lips. \"I know,\" she said. \"But it's so hard. Sometimes it feels like we're speaking different languages, like there's a wall between us that we can't break through.\"\n\nHe took her hand, his touch warm and reassuring. \"Then let's start by listening,\" he said. \"Really listening. Maybe if we understand where the other is coming from, we can find common ground.\"\n\nShe squeezed his hand, a small gesture that spoke volumes. \"I'll try,\" she said. \"I'll really try.\"\n\nThey stood there in silence, the abyss still present but somehow less daunting. It was as if the simple act of reaching out, of acknowledging their differences and their shared history, had shrunk the chasm, made it more manageable.\n\nIn that moment, the dream began to shift. The void around them shimmered and transformed, the edges of their reality blurring into a new landscape. They found themselves in a familiar place, the park where they had spent countless afternoons as children, their laughter echoing through the trees. The sky was a brilliant blue, the sun warm on their faces.\n\n\"Do you remember this?\" Samuel asked, his voice filled with nostalgia.\n\n\"How could I forget?\" Maria replied, a smile tugging at her lips. \"We used to race to that old oak tree every day after school.\"\n\nHe grinned, a boyish light in his eyes. \"You always won.\"\n\n\"Only because you let me,\" she said, nudging him playfully.\n\nThey walked together, the memories flooding back, each step a reminder of the bond they shared. The park was a symbol, a tangible representation of their friendship, a place where the walls between them had never existed.\n\nAs they reached the oak tree, they sat down beneath its sprawling branches, the shade cool and comforting. \"This is what we need,\" Samuel said softly. \"A place where we can be ourselves, where our differences don't divide us.\"\n\nMaria nodded, the weight of their recent conflicts lifting slightly. \"I think we can find that place,\" she said. \"But it will take effort, from both of us.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" he said, his voice firm. \"We'll take it one day at a time, one conversation at a time.\"\n\nThey sat in companionable silence, the rustle of leaves and the distant chirping of birds providing a soothing soundtrack. In the quiet moments, they found a new understanding, a tentative but hopeful beginning.\n\nAs the dream began to fade, the park dissolving into a soft haze, Maria felt a sense of peace. She knew that their journey was far from over, that the challenges they faced were real and daunting. But she also knew that they had taken the first step, that they had chosen to bridge the abyss and dismantle the wall, one brick at a time.\n\nWhen she awoke, the morning light filtering through her bedroom window, she felt a renewed sense of purpose. She picked up her phone, her fingers trembling slightly as she dialed Samuel's number. As it rang, she took a deep breath, ready to continue the conversation that had begun in their shared dream.\n\n\"Hello?\" His voice, groggy with sleep, came through the line.\n\n\"Samuel, it's Maria,\" she said, her voice steady. \"Can we talk?\"\n\nThere was a pause, and then, \"Of course,\" he replied, a note of hope in his voice. \"I'd like that.\"\n\nAnd so, they began anew, two friends bound by love, determined to bridge the divide, one conversation at a time.",
        "story_b": "In the twilight of a dreamscape, Claire and David stood on opposite sides of a vast abyss. The chasm was a swirling void, a tempest of past arguments and forgotten grievances, echoing with the ghosts of their shared history. Above them, the sky was a canvas of surreal colors\u2014violets mingling with oranges, as if dusk and dawn were perpetually entwined. \n\nDavid's voice resonated across the divide, a distant echo that seemed to drift on the mist of their unspoken words. \"If we could bridge this abyss, what would you say?\" he called, his tone carrying the weight of countless unresolved conversations.\n\nClaire hesitated, the surreal quality of the dream amplifying her introspection. She remembered a time when their voices had harmonized, not clashed. A memory unfolded\u2014a summer day when they had sat beneath a sprawling oak, debating everything and nothing. The laughter had come easily then, a counterpoint to their differences, each argument a playful sparring match rather than a wall.\n\nNow, in this dream, there was no oak, only the abyss, a manifestation of the chasm their beliefs had carved between them. The ground beneath her feet was cool and soft, a carpet of moss that seemed to breathe with her. Claire felt the urgency of the message she carried, a truth that was both a burden and a beacon. Yet, how to convey it across this divide?\n\nDavid's silhouette was stark against the horizon, a figure etched in longing. He gestured toward the abyss, his irony cutting through the dream's haze. \"I always knew our debates would lead to a chasm, but this is ridiculous.\"\n\nClaire smiled despite herself, the humor a balm for the tension. \"You think we overdid it?\" she retorted, her voice feather-light yet carrying the gravity of their shared past. \n\nIn a vignette of memory, she was transported to a moment years ago\u2014an argument in a caf\u00e9, the air thick with the aroma of freshly ground coffee and heated words. They had argued about politics, the environment, the very fabric of their reality. Yet beneath the surface, there was always the undercurrent of love, an unspoken acknowledgment of their bond. Now, the very debates that had once brought them closer had become a barrier.\n\nThe dream shifted, and they were both aware of a wall rising beside them, its surface etched with the scars of old debates. Each crack and crevice whispered secrets of forgotten times, a testament to the words that had built it. Claire reached out, her fingers brushing the cold stone, and felt the weight of her own beliefs pressing against her heart.\n\n\"Do you remember,\" David's voice was softer now, \"that time we tried to climb that ridiculous hill on our bikes, and you insisted on taking the scenic route?\" His laughter was a ripple in the air, a thread connecting the past to this surreal present.\n\nClaire nodded, the memory vivid\u2014a sunlit afternoon, the wind in her hair, and David's exasperated voice as they realized the scenic route was a cul-de-sac. They had laughed until tears streamed down their faces, the kind of laughter that erased all differences, if only for a moment.\n\n\"I thought I'd never get you to turn around,\" David continued, his tone laced with affection. \"You were so stubborn, Claire. Still are.\"\n\n\"Pot, meet kettle,\" Claire replied, her voice a gentle challenge. \n\nThey both knew the truth\u2014each was as entrenched in their beliefs as the other. The abyss yawned between them, a tangible reminder of their division. Yet, in the midst of this dream, Claire felt a thread of hope, a desire to reach across, to deliver her message.\n\nShe took a deep breath, the air thick with the scent of possibility. \"David, I have something to tell you,\" she began, her words a bridge she hoped would span the void. \"It's about... it's about why we argue. I think\u2014\"\n\nBut the abyss seemed to widen, the swirling void intensifying as if their differences fed its hunger. Claire's voice faltered, the urgency of her message overshadowed by the enormity of their divide.\n\nIn the dream's shifting landscape, David stepped closer to the edge, his presence solid and reassuring. \"Claire,\" he said, his voice an anchor, \"we need to find a way to meet in the middle.\"\n\nClaire nodded, her mind racing. The dream was a metaphor, she realized, a canvas painted with their introspections and fears. The abyss, the wall\u2014they were constructs of their own making, reflections of the barriers they had erected in their hearts. \n\nSuddenly, a rope appeared, suspended across the chasm, its fibers woven from threads of memory and shared history. It shimmered in the ethereal light, a lifeline of possibility. Claire and David both reached for it, their movements mirrored and tentative.\n\nAs her fingers closed around the rope, Claire felt the weight of the message lighten, its importance distilled into a simple truth. \"David,\" she called, her voice strong and clear, \"our beliefs don't have to separate us. They can be the bridge.\"\n\nDavid's grip tightened on the rope, his face a study in determination. \"I want to believe that,\" he replied, his voice carrying a tremor of vulnerability. \"But what if the rope breaks?\"\n\n\"Then we rebuild,\" Claire said, the certainty in her words a testament to the depth of their connection. \"Together.\"\n\nThe dream shifted once more, the abyss narrowing until it was a mere crack in the earth, the wall dissolving into mist. Claire and David stood side by side, the surreal landscape a reflection of their shared commitment to bridge the divide.\n\nIn the waking world, they would still face the challenge of their differences, the weight of their beliefs pressing against them. But in this dream, they had found a way to reach across the abyss, to deliver the message that mattered most\u2014the enduring power of their friendship, the love that transcended all divides.\n\nClaire awoke with the dawn, the dream's vivid colors fading into the light of day. The message lingered in her heart, a beacon guiding her path. She reached for her phone, her fingers finding David's number with the ease of familiarity. As she dialed, she knew the conversation they would have, the words they would share\u2014a bridge spanning the abyss, a testament to the bond that had always been, and always would be, unbreakable.",

The generation of the grandparents who weren\u2019t dead of old age had been killed in the camps, but there were cousins who had emigrated to Uruguay, to Paraguay, to the Dominican Republic, to Argentina. An uncle went to Canada. Frieda sent the visa for me to come to New York. She settled me in her funny little apartment in Washington Heights\u2014in the fifties, there were so many of us we called it Washingstein Heights. She handed me an Oxford English Dictionary and hurried back to New Haven for her exams. She would come in to see if I was O.K., bring me \u2018David Copperfield\u2019 or a Jane Austen.

We didn\u2019t get together back in New York until Lotte invited both of us to dinner. She left us in a room together with the door shut, and Frieda and I started to laugh. You and I, we said to each other, we don\u2019t have to go on doing this. You know what I will say, and I know what you are going to answer. But to this day we are still arguing the same opposing politics without having made a dent in each other\u2019s opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer wrong opinion, which leads her to vote on the wrong side,\u201d Ruth says.\n\n\u201cWhich she believes to be the right side as fully as she believes that yours and mine is wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you know the disastrous consequences of hers,\u201d Ruth says.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I walked off the bus, I suppose,\u201d says Ilka.\n\n\u201cBut you go on talking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe go on talking.\u201d\n\nBridget says, \u201cYou keep not telling us what you argue about.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I am more interested in the fact, the nature, of disagreement,\u201d Ilka says. \u201cAlso, it keeps the conversation from going to Israel, though Frieda says, correctly I think, that \u2018to not go there\u2019 is to silence speech.\u201d\n\nRuth asks, \u201cSo exactly what is the dispute?\u201d\n\nIlka says, \u201cOne way of putting it is that I choose to think of myself as a humanist, a child of Adam, where Frieda thinks of herself as a child of God-chosen Abraham. The DNA, as she says, will be the same.\n\n\u201cI search for what Isaac, the progenitor of Israel, has in common with his brother Ishmael, progenitor of Canaan: They both laugh if you tickle them and bleed when you prick them, which drives poor Frieda frantic. She says Shakespeare probably never met a Jew in his life. She challenges\u2014no, she demolishes\u2014my dearest belief, that it\u2019s the imagination which could save the world, that if we imagined our neighbor\u2019s griefs we would not do to him what we don\u2019t want him to do to us. Frieda says that, having imagined what it\u2019s like to be the abused Jew, Shakespeare confiscates half his fortune, hounds him ignominiously off the stage, and makes him convert.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to open a bottle of wine,\u201d Farah says. \u201cIlka, go on.\u201d\n\nIlka says, \u201cFrieda argues that the basis for our innate difference is my inclination for seeing sameness where hers is for seeing distinctions. Where I search for harmony in equality, she sees how one thing\u2014one people, history, ethos\u2014is distinct from another. Frieda says that for me distinctions spell the disruption of harmony; that, for her, harmony is a lie where distinction is present.\n\n\u201c \u2018Harmony?\u2019 I holler. \u2018What, me? Aren\u2019t I your favorite contrarian, your in-house skeptic who tests your every certainty by opposing my uncertainties? Do, please, notice,\u2019 I tell her, \u2018that I end with my universal question mark.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut then she asked if I and you\u2014my \u2018Lunch Ladies\u2019\u2014still vote on the left, and I said, \u2018You bet,\u2019 and we were back on the bus, you see. I e-mailed her: \u2018I\u2019m discouraged.\u2019 She answered, \u2018For the record (if there is a record) I feel terrible, not simply discouraged but terrible.\u2019\n\n\u201cI wrote her, \u2018I don\u2019t know if it will ease your distress, but I reconfirm my love and friendship if you will accept them with the acceptance also of our irreconcilable differences, which are totally unchanged after half a century\u2019s disputation.\n\n\u201cShe answered, \u2018Noted.

        "story_a": "In the liminal space between consciousness and oblivion, Maria found herself in a vast expanse of nothingness, a shimmering, dreamlike landscape where the air itself seemed to pulse with an otherworldly glow. She could feel her heart beating against her ribcage, a rhythmic drum that synchronized with the distant hum of the void. She looked around, trying to orient herself, but there was no horizon, no sky, no ground\u2014just an endless continuum of muted light and shadow.\n\nThen, she saw him. Samuel, her dearest friend, stood at a distance, his figure clear and sharp against the nebulous backdrop. He was waving at her, a frantic motion that spoke of urgency and desperation. She started towards him, her steps slow at first, but then quicker, more determined. But with each stride, the space between them seemed to stretch, an elastic chasm that refused to close.\n\n\"Maria!\" Samuel's voice cut through the silence, a plaintive cry that made her heart ache. \"I need to tell you something. It's important.\"\n\nShe tried to shout back, but her voice was swallowed by the vastness, her words dissipating into the ether. Frustration welled up inside her, a familiar companion in their recent conversations, where dialogues often turned into debates, and debates into arguments. They had once shared a singular vision of the world, a tapestry woven from shared experiences and dreams. But lately, their threads had frayed, pulled apart by the weight of their diverging beliefs.\n\nAn abyss yawned suddenly between them, a dark, gaping maw that seemed to absorb all light and sound. Maria hesitated at its edge, the chasm too wide, too deep to traverse. She could see Samuel on the other side, his face lined with worry, his eyes pleading.\n\n\"Maria, please!\" he called, his voice trembling. \"You have to listen.\"\n\nShe knew that she had to reach him, that something critical hinged on this message. But how? The abyss was impassable, a physical manifestation of the emotional distance that had grown between them. She took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and took a leap of faith. But instead of falling, she found herself suspended, floating weightlessly across the divide. When she landed on the other side, Samuel was there, his face a mixture of relief and apprehension.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said quietly, his voice raw with emotion. \"I didn't know if you'd come.\"\n\n\"Of course, I would,\" she replied, her tone softer than she intended. \"What is it, Samuel? What's so urgent?\"\n\nHe reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, crumpled piece of paper. \"It's about us,\" he said, handing it to her. \"About everything we've been through. I need you to understand.\"\n\nShe unfolded the paper, her eyes scanning the hastily written words. It was a letter, a confession of sorts, filled with memories of their shared past, moments of joy and sorrow, and a heartfelt plea for reconciliation. As she read, tears filled her eyes, blurring the ink on the page.\n\n\"Samuel,\" she whispered, her voice choked with emotion. \"Why didn't you just tell me this before?\"\n\n\"I tried,\" he said, his voice breaking. \"But every time I did, we ended up fighting. I didn't know how to bridge the gap between us.\"\n\nShe looked at him, her heart aching with a mixture of love and regret. \"I miss you,\" she said simply. \"I miss us.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" he replied, his eyes glistening. \"But we can't keep pretending that our differences don't matter. We have to find a way to coexist, to respect each other's beliefs, even if we can't agree on everything.\"\n\nMaria nodded, a heavy sigh escaping her lips. \"I know,\" she said. \"But it's so hard. Sometimes it feels like we're speaking different languages, like there's a wall between us that we can't break through.\"\n\nHe took her hand, his touch warm and reassuring. \"Then let's start by listening,\" he said. \"Really listening. Maybe if we understand where the other is coming from, we can find common ground.\"\n\nShe squeezed his hand, a small gesture that spoke volumes. \"I'll try,\" she said. \"I'll really try.\"\n\nThey stood there in silence, the abyss still present but somehow less daunting. It was as if the simple act of reaching out, of acknowledging their differences and their shared history, had shrunk the chasm, made it more manageable.\n\nIn that moment, the dream began to shift. The void around them shimmered and transformed, the edges of their reality blurring into a new landscape. They found themselves in a familiar place, the park where they had spent countless afternoons as children, their laughter echoing through the trees. The sky was a brilliant blue, the sun warm on their faces.\n\n\"Do you remember this?\" Samuel asked, his voice filled with nostalgia.\n\n\"How could I forget?\" Maria replied, a smile tugging at her lips. \"We used to race to that old oak tree every day after school.\"\n\nHe grinned, a boyish light in his eyes. \"You always won.\"\n\n\"Only because you let me,\" she said, nudging him playfully.\n\nThey walked together, the memories flooding back, each step a reminder of the bond they shared. The park was a symbol, a tangible representation of their friendship, a place where the walls between them had never existed.\n\nAs they reached the oak tree, they sat down beneath its sprawling branches, the shade cool and comforting. \"This is what we need,\" Samuel said softly. \"A place where we can be ourselves, where our differences don't divide us.\"\n\nMaria nodded, the weight of their recent conflicts lifting slightly. \"I think we can find that place,\" she said. \"But it will take effort, from both of us.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" he said, his voice firm. \"We'll take it one day at a time, one conversation at a time.\"\n\nThey sat in companionable silence, the rustle of leaves and the distant chirping of birds providing a soothing soundtrack. In the quiet moments, they found a new understanding, a tentative but hopeful beginning.\n\nAs the dream began to fade, the park dissolving into a soft haze, Maria felt a sense of peace. She knew that their journey was far from over, that the challenges they faced were real and daunting. But she also knew that they had taken the first step, that they had chosen to bridge the abyss and dismantle the wall, one brick at a time.\n\nWhen she awoke, the morning light filtering through her bedroom window, she felt a renewed sense of purpose. She picked up her phone, her fingers trembling slightly as she dialed Samuel's number. As it rang, she took a deep breath, ready to continue the conversation that had begun in their shared dream.\n\n\"Hello?\" His voice, groggy with sleep, came through the line.\n\n\"Samuel, it's Maria,\" she said, her voice steady. \"Can we talk?\"\n\nThere was a pause, and then, \"Of course,\" he replied, a note of hope in his voice. \"I'd like that.\"\n\nAnd so, they began anew, two friends bound by love, determined to bridge the divide, one conversation at a time.",
        "story_b": "In the dream, Daniel stood at the precipice of an abyss that seemed to stretch beyond the horizons of his imagination. The air was thick with anticipation, as if even the sky held its breath. He clutched the message\u2014a slip of paper upon which the words danced like flames, their urgency searing his palms. Across the gaping void, he saw Miriam, her figure a silhouette against the dim glow of the horizon, unreachable yet achingly near.\n\nThe abyss was not just a physical chasm; it was the embodiment of every silence that had grown between them, every conversation steered away from the dangerous terrain of their differences. Politics, faith, the very nature of truth\u2014these were fissures that had, over time, widened into this unbridgeable gulf. Yet, the message in his hand demanded delivery, a fragile bird of hope and desperation.\n\nDaniel took a deep breath, the air laced with the scent of memories. In the dream's fluidity, he remembered the laughter shared under summer skies, debates that once sparked with the joy of discovery rather than the bitterness of dissent. He longed to call out to her, to span the distance with words, but his voice was tethered by the weight of things unsaid.\n\nThe dream shifted, as dreams do, and suddenly he was at the edge of the abyss with a bridge forming beneath his feet\u2014a bridge not of stone or wood, but of memories. Each step was a vignette: the time they danced in the rain, the night they sat on the roof counting stars, the arguments that ended in promises of forever friendship. The bridge wavered, as if uncertain of its own solidity, reflecting the fragile nature of their bond.\n\nAs Daniel moved forward, the abyss below whispered echoes of past arguments, the words looping endlessly like a forgotten song. He paused, feeling the bridge shudder under the weight of an unresolved past. He looked across at Miriam, who stood unmoving, her expression a tapestry of hope and fear.\n\nThe dreamscape morphed again, and the bridge disappeared, replaced by a wall\u2014an immense, towering barrier that pulsated with a life of its own. It was constructed of shifting words and images, a collage of their conflicting beliefs. Political slogans and philosophical maxims wove in and out of each other, creating a living mural that writhed with tension.\n\nDaniel approached the wall, feeling its energy thrumming through his fingertips. Each section was a chapter of their shared history, each brick a decision point where paths had diverged. He could see Miriam on the other side, her fingers tracing the contours of their past, her eyes meeting his through the translucent stone.\n\n\"This wall,\" he thought, \"is not just stone and mortar, but the embodiment of every unspoken word and unresolved conflict between us.\" He pressed his hand against it, willing it to dissolve, to crumble under the weight of their shared humanity.\n\nIn the dream's strange logic, he saw his words transform into birds\u2014flocks of iridescent creatures that flew towards Miriam, only to be caught by the gusting winds, swirling back into the abyss. Each bird carried a message: an apology, a declaration, an acknowledgment of her truth. But the winds of their differences were relentless, scattering his words before they could reach her.\n\nMiriam watched the birds with a wistful smile, her eyes reflecting the kaleidoscope of their shared history. She too reached for the wall, her fingers brushing against the shifting images. In the silence, she heard Daniel's voice, not as it was now, but as it had been\u2014young, untainted by the scars of time.\n\nThe dream shifted once more, and Daniel found himself in a garden, lush and overgrown, where the wall had become a hedge of thorns. The air was heavy with the scent of roses and rain, an intoxicating blend of beauty and danger. He knew that somewhere within this maze lay the message's true destination\u2014a place where words could be spoken freely, where understanding might blossom.\n\nHe pushed through the thorns, feeling their bite against his skin. Each scratch was a reminder of the pain their differences had wrought, but he pressed on, driven by the urgency of the message. He could hear Miriam on the other side, her voice a song of longing and regret.\n\nAs he emerged into a clearing, he saw her waiting, her face lit by the soft glow of dreamlight. The hedge still separated them, but here, in this place of quiet reflection, the air was different\u2014calmer, imbued with the possibility of reconciliation.\n\n\"Miriam,\" he called out, his voice finally finding its strength. \"I have something to say.\"\n\nShe looked at him, her eyes weary yet hopeful. \"I\u2019m listening,\" she replied, the words a bridge in themselves.\n\nDaniel held the message aloft, letting it unfurl in the dream's gentle breeze. \"I don't know if we can ever truly reconcile our beliefs,\" he began, his voice steady. \"But I do know that our friendship means more to me than being right. Can we find a way to honor that?\"\n\nMiriam smiled, a soft, tentative smile that spoke of old wounds and new beginnings. \"I think we can try,\" she said, her voice a balm to the fractures between them.\n\nIn that moment, the hedge of thorns began to wither, its blooms falling away to reveal a path\u2014a path not of perfect unity, but of mutual respect, where their differences could coexist alongside their love.\n\nThe dream began to fade, the surreal landscape dissolving into the soft edges of waking. As Daniel drifted towards consciousness, he felt the message slip from his grasp, its urgency replaced by a quiet understanding that lingered in his heart.\n\nWhen he awoke, it was with the realization that dreams, like friendships, are not always about resolution. Sometimes they are about the journey, the willingness to reach across the void, to stand before the wall and see it not as a barrier, but as a shared history that can be rewritten.\n\nHe picked up the phone, dialing her number with a newfound resolve. The message had been delivered, not in words, but in the willingness to try again, to bridge the abyss with the strength of their bond. As the line connected, he knew that they would find a way, together, to navigate the labyrinth of their differences, to cherish the path they had chosen to walk side by side.",

Do, please, notice,\u2019 I tell her, \u2018that I end with my universal question mark.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut then she asked if I and you\u2014my \u2018Lunch Ladies\u2019\u2014still vote on the left, and I said, \u2018You bet,\u2019 and we were back on the bus, you see. I e-mailed her: \u2018I\u2019m discouraged.\u2019 She answered, \u2018For the record (if there is a record) I feel terrible, not simply discouraged but terrible.\u2019\n\n\u201cI wrote her, \u2018I don\u2019t know if it will ease your distress, but I reconfirm my love and friendship if you will accept them with the acceptance also of our irreconcilable differences, which are totally unchanged after half a century\u2019s disputation.\n\n\u201cShe answered, \u2018Noted. Confirmed and renewed.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIlka says, \u201cAnd then I dreamed that there was something essential that has to be prevented.\u201d \u2666\n\n",
        "story_a": "In the liminal space between consciousness and oblivion, Maria found herself in a vast expanse of nothingness, a shimmering, dreamlike landscape where the air itself seemed to pulse with an otherworldly glow. She could feel her heart beating against her ribcage, a rhythmic drum that synchronized with the distant hum of the void. She looked around, trying to orient herself, but there was no horizon, no sky, no ground\u2014just an endless continuum of muted light and shadow.\n\nThen, she saw him. Samuel, her dearest friend, stood at a distance, his figure clear and sharp against the nebulous backdrop. He was waving at her, a frantic motion that spoke of urgency and desperation. She started towards him, her steps slow at first, but then quicker, more determined. But with each stride, the space between them seemed to stretch, an elastic chasm that refused to close.\n\n\"Maria!\" Samuel's voice cut through the silence, a plaintive cry that made her heart ache. \"I need to tell you something. It's important.\"\n\nShe tried to shout back, but her voice was swallowed by the vastness, her words dissipating into the ether. Frustration welled up inside her, a familiar companion in their recent conversations, where dialogues often turned into debates, and debates into arguments. They had once shared a singular vision of the world, a tapestry woven from shared experiences and dreams. But lately, their threads had frayed, pulled apart by the weight of their diverging beliefs.\n\nAn abyss yawned suddenly between them, a dark, gaping maw that seemed to absorb all light and sound. Maria hesitated at its edge, the chasm too wide, too deep to traverse. She could see Samuel on the other side, his face lined with worry, his eyes pleading.\n\n\"Maria, please!\" he called, his voice trembling. \"You have to listen.\"\n\nShe knew that she had to reach him, that something critical hinged on this message. But how? The abyss was impassable, a physical manifestation of the emotional distance that had grown between them. She took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and took a leap of faith. But instead of falling, she found herself suspended, floating weightlessly across the divide. When she landed on the other side, Samuel was there, his face a mixture of relief and apprehension.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said quietly, his voice raw with emotion. \"I didn't know if you'd come.\"\n\n\"Of course, I would,\" she replied, her tone softer than she intended. \"What is it, Samuel? What's so urgent?\"\n\nHe reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, crumpled piece of paper. \"It's about us,\" he said, handing it to her. \"About everything we've been through. I need you to understand.\"\n\nShe unfolded the paper, her eyes scanning the hastily written words. It was a letter, a confession of sorts, filled with memories of their shared past, moments of joy and sorrow, and a heartfelt plea for reconciliation. As she read, tears filled her eyes, blurring the ink on the page.\n\n\"Samuel,\" she whispered, her voice choked with emotion. \"Why didn't you just tell me this before?\"\n\n\"I tried,\" he said, his voice breaking. \"But every time I did, we ended up fighting. I didn't know how to bridge the gap between us.\"\n\nShe looked at him, her heart aching with a mixture of love and regret. \"I miss you,\" she said simply. \"I miss us.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" he replied, his eyes glistening. \"But we can't keep pretending that our differences don't matter. We have to find a way to coexist, to respect each other's beliefs, even if we can't agree on everything.\"\n\nMaria nodded, a heavy sigh escaping her lips. \"I know,\" she said. \"But it's so hard. Sometimes it feels like we're speaking different languages, like there's a wall between us that we can't break through.\"\n\nHe took her hand, his touch warm and reassuring. \"Then let's start by listening,\" he said. \"Really listening. Maybe if we understand where the other is coming from, we can find common ground.\"\n\nShe squeezed his hand, a small gesture that spoke volumes. \"I'll try,\" she said. \"I'll really try.\"\n\nThey stood there in silence, the abyss still present but somehow less daunting. It was as if the simple act of reaching out, of acknowledging their differences and their shared history, had shrunk the chasm, made it more manageable.\n\nIn that moment, the dream began to shift. The void around them shimmered and transformed, the edges of their reality blurring into a new landscape. They found themselves in a familiar place, the park where they had spent countless afternoons as children, their laughter echoing through the trees. The sky was a brilliant blue, the sun warm on their faces.\n\n\"Do you remember this?\" Samuel asked, his voice filled with nostalgia.\n\n\"How could I forget?\" Maria replied, a smile tugging at her lips. \"We used to race to that old oak tree every day after school.\"\n\nHe grinned, a boyish light in his eyes. \"You always won.\"\n\n\"Only because you let me,\" she said, nudging him playfully.\n\nThey walked together, the memories flooding back, each step a reminder of the bond they shared. The park was a symbol, a tangible representation of their friendship, a place where the walls between them had never existed.\n\nAs they reached the oak tree, they sat down beneath its sprawling branches, the shade cool and comforting. \"This is what we need,\" Samuel said softly. \"A place where we can be ourselves, where our differences don't divide us.\"\n\nMaria nodded, the weight of their recent conflicts lifting slightly. \"I think we can find that place,\" she said. \"But it will take effort, from both of us.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" he said, his voice firm. \"We'll take it one day at a time, one conversation at a time.\"\n\nThey sat in companionable silence, the rustle of leaves and the distant chirping of birds providing a soothing soundtrack. In the quiet moments, they found a new understanding, a tentative but hopeful beginning.\n\nAs the dream began to fade, the park dissolving into a soft haze, Maria felt a sense of peace. She knew that their journey was far from over, that the challenges they faced were real and daunting. But she also knew that they had taken the first step, that they had chosen to bridge the abyss and dismantle the wall, one brick at a time.\n\nWhen she awoke, the morning light filtering through her bedroom window, she felt a renewed sense of purpose. She picked up her phone, her fingers trembling slightly as she dialed Samuel's number. As it rang, she took a deep breath, ready to continue the conversation that had begun in their shared dream.\n\n\"Hello?\" His voice, groggy with sleep, came through the line.\n\n\"Samuel, it's Maria,\" she said, her voice steady. \"Can we talk?\"\n\nThere was a pause, and then, \"Of course,\" he replied, a note of hope in his voice. \"I'd like that.\"\n\nAnd so, they began anew, two friends bound by love, determined to bridge the divide, one conversation at a time.",
        "story_b": "In the surreal dreamscape, the world stretched out in a hazy gradient of twilight hues. A vast abyss yawned between two figures standing on opposite edges, casting shadows that reached out like hands, eager to bridge the divide. The air was cool and damp, a whispering mist swirling around them, echoing with unspoken words and promises long past. To the left, a great wall rose with stones as ancient as their shared history, each brick etched with memories and arguments, standing testament to the years of their friendship.\n\nOn one side of the chasm stood Lena, her silhouette sharp against the murky backdrop, her heart heavy with urgency. She clutched a letter, its edges curling under the weight of her grasp. Across from her, on the other side, was Mark, his stance wary yet unyielding, eyes searching hers for a sign of the message she bore.\n\n\u201cLena, what is this place?\u201d Mark\u2019s voice carried over the abyss, laced with a mix of fear and curiosity.\n\n\u201cA dream, perhaps,\u201d Lena replied, her voice trembling slightly, \u201cor a nightmare. I need you to understand why this matters.\u201d\n\nMark laughed, a sound that was both familiar and foreign. \u201cYou always said our beliefs would tear us apart. Maybe this is the universe\u2019s way of proving you right.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe we should just build a bridge out of our stubbornness,\u201d Lena quipped, trying to inject humor into the heavy air, but the joke fell flat, swallowed by the chasm between them.\n\nAs they stood there, the dreamscape shifted, memories swirling in the mist like specters. Lena recalled a sunlit afternoon, years ago, when they had sat on a park bench, arguing over a book. She had been passionate, animated, insisting on her interpretation, while Mark had listened, nodding along, until he could no longer suppress his differing view. It had been a pivotal moment, a first glimpse into the chasm that would later grow between them.\n\n\u201cRemember that day in the park?\u201d Lena called out, her voice softer now, tinged with nostalgia. \u201cWe were so young, so sure of ourselves. It was the first time I realized we saw the world through different lenses.\u201d\n\nMark nodded slowly, his gaze distant as he too wandered back to that afternoon. \u201cI thought it was thrilling,\u201d he admitted, \u201cdebating with someone who challenged me. But I never imagined it would lead us here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been on opposite sides, haven\u2019t we?\u201d Lena mused, watching as the abyss seemed to narrow for a fleeting moment, a bridge of understanding almost forming before it vanished again.\n\nMark sighed, the sound resonating with the distant rumble of shifting earth. \u201cSometimes I wonder why I can\u2019t let this go. Why can\u2019t I accept that we\u2019re different?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it matters, Mark,\u201d Lena said, her voice firm. \u201cBecause these differences are not just in our heads; they\u2019re part of who we are.\u201d\n\nThe wall behind Lena shimmered, and figures began to emerge from its surface\u2014secondary characters from their past, living echoes of their shared journey. There was Hannah, their college friend, who had always been the peacekeeper, and Rob, the one who had introduced them all those years ago, his laughter still a faint memory in their minds.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Lena pointed, her eyes wide with surprise. \u201cThey\u2019re here. Do you remember what Hannah used to say?\u201d\n\nMark smiled, despite himself. \u201c\u2018Agree to disagree, but never stop listening.\u2019 She always believed we\u2019d find common ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe she was right,\u201d Lena said wistfully. \u201cOr maybe we\u2019ve just been too proud to see it.\u201d\n\nThe mist swirled thicker, and the figures faded back into the stone, leaving Lena and Mark alone once more, facing the expanse that separated them. The tension was palpable, each of them holding their beliefs close like shields, yet the letter in Lena\u2019s hand felt heavier than any conviction.\n\n\u201cLena, what\u2019s in the letter?\u201d Mark asked, his curiosity piqued.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s... a confession,\u201d Lena admitted, her voice barely a whisper. \u201cSomething I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you for a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy now?\u201d Mark pressed, his voice urgent.\n\n\u201cBecause this dream, this place, it\u2019s showing me how far apart we\u2019ve drifted. And I\u2019m scared, Mark. I\u2019m scared of losing you.\u201d\n\nThe abyss seemed to pulse with her words, and for a moment, it felt as though the earth beneath them trembled in response. Mark took a step closer to the edge, his heart pounding with an emotion he couldn\u2019t quite name.\n\n\u201cLena, I\u2019ve been scared too. Scared that one day, we\u2019d wake up and find ourselves strangers.\u201d\n\nLena nodded, tears glistening in her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ve let our beliefs build this wall, widen this abyss. But maybe, just maybe, we can find a way to understand each other.\u201d\n\nMark\u2019s eyes softened, his defenses crumbling ever so slightly. \u201cI\u2019ve missed this, Lena\u2014this honesty between us. I want to hear your confession.\u201d\n\nLena hesitated, then took a deep breath, the mist swirling around her like a protective cloak. \u201cI\u2019ve always admired you, Mark. Even when we fought, even when I thought I couldn\u2019t understand you. You\u2019ve made me question, challenge, and grow. And... I\u2019m sorry for the times I let my pride get in the way.\u201d\n\nThe abyss seemed to draw in a breath, the mist curling tighter around them, as if the dream itself was holding its breath for his response.\n\nMark smiled, a real smile this time, and nodded slowly. \u201cThank you, Lena. For saying that. For being brave enough to bridge this gap, even if just for a moment.\u201d\n\nThe dreamscape shimmered, the abyss narrowing ever so slightly, though the wall remained steadfast. It was clear that the divide would not close overnight, that their differences were too deeply ingrained. Yet, in that dream, there was a sense of peace, a mutual understanding that hadn\u2019t been there before.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d Lena said, her voice gentle, \u201cthat this message, this dream, was worth the risk.\u201d\n\nMark nodded, stepping back from the edge, his heart lighter. \u201cAnd maybe, when we wake, we can work on building that bridge. Out of more than just stubbornness.\u201d\n\nAs the dream began to dissolve, the mist reclaiming its hold over the landscape, Lena and Mark stood there, separated by the abyss but connected by something deeper\u2014a shared history, a love that transcended their differences, and the hope of a future where understanding could be their guide.\n\nIn the end, as the cool, damp air faded and the dream released them back to reality, Lena and Mark carried with them the knowledge that while the abyss remained, they had found a way to see each other across it, and perhaps, in time, they could learn to meet in the middle.",

        "ground_truth": "The flat is quiet when Obi-Wan manages to wrangle the door open through a mess of foliage and delicate string lights that throng their hallway. No need to worry about alarms or a security system when they had the normal mess and clutter of everyday life. She steps over Cody\u2019s work boots, placed into the same spot every day, and loosely toes her own shoes off next to them. The sole gapes wide as she does so, revealing the softer innards of fabric straining away from rubber, and she ignores it as best as she can.\nTape is a godsend and where tape wouldn\u2019t fix it, there is a small tube of superglue in one of the drawers she can ask Cody to try. The pads of Obi-Wan\u2019s fingers are still discoloured from her last attempt at trying to fix a pair of her shoes so she\u2019ll pass the problem to more capable hands. Her jacket is summarily discarded onto the back of the sofa and she lingers long enough to retrieve her lanyard and keys from the pocket, returning them to their forced exclusion into the small bowl on the counter for the next two days. The time off from work stretches luxuriously empty, free from any mandatory training or social obligations, and Obi-Wan skirts around the potential issue of their unique living arrangement as she flicks on the kettle, pulling one mug out of the cupboard, pausing and returning for another. Cody has the next couple of days off as well, a rarity with their opposite working schedules. Obi-Wan makes Cody\u2019s cup of coffee how she likes it, strong and sweet and a splash of milk first despite Obi-Wan\u2019s moral objections to the concept, and rifles through her small collection of tea. There is no caffeine in her immediate future if she wants to sleep for any part of the morning; another hidden delight of adulthood that\u2019s tripped her over and bruised up her face. She chews on the tip of her tongue as she draws a bag free, dropping it into her cup and chasing it with the boiling water.\nA door creaks further in the apartment and Obi-Wan rocks back onto her heels, a dozy prickle of contentment resting on the nape of her neck. Cody\u2019s steps are steady, sleep-slow and her slippers smack against the floor as she makes her way into the sitting room. Much of her isn\u2019t visible, a walking plaid blanket that hides her face and her curls, but the tattoo over her calf is clearly visible with one of her pyjama trouser legs drawn up over her knee while the other falls to the floor.\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Obi-Wan says, breaking into a yawn that she doesn\u2019t bother to hide behind her hand. Her manners are ingrained into her bones but even that runs thin and fallow after so long spent at work.\n\u201cG\u2019morning,\u201d Cody responds, her words muffled through fabric and sleep. Obi-Wan can picture her expression, her eyes still mostly closed and her gaze filtered through her impossibly long lashes and her grin easily worn in.\nObi-Wan follows her, both mugs in hand, and places them onto the clear spaces on their cluttered coffee table. She has options for seating, the low slouch of a battered armchair Obi-Wan carried to her student dorm, then flat, then four different flatshares before this one or the other end of the sofa that Cody has already claimed, piled high with blankets and a handful of cushions that Cody would claim as family heirlooms at the first hint of decluttering. She sits on Cody\u2019s legs stretched out over the seat before she wriggles backwards into the hollow created. Cody grunts, shifting her legs straighter before she reaches down to tug a section of the blanket free, pulling it over Obi-Wan.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in early,\u201d Cody mumbles. She\u2019s partially spilled out of the blanket now wrapped around her waist. She stretches and her shirt rises with the motion, everything about her solid and real and beautiful.\nObi-Wan hums in agreement, leaning sideways against Cody who absorbs the motion with a soft sound. She wraps an arm around Obi-Wan\u2019s shoulders, playing with the loose edge of her sleeve. \u201cMove your head up a bit? You\u2019re lying right on my tit.\u201d Obi-Wan does so, her face flushed but it\u2019s fine. It happens. Cody continues, her voice a little more structured as she wakes, \u201cFigured you\u2019d like the bed to sleep after your night shift so I came out here for the morning. It\u2019ll be nice having us both around the house, little human company to prove I\u2019m not just another cog in the machine.\u201d\nIf Cody is a cog, then she would be the best cog imaginable, something brimming with lots of interlocking teeth, a fundamental piece of the machinery. Obi-Wan tells her this because why wouldn\u2019t she? It makes perfect sense.\nCody tips her head back as she laughs, the sound vibrating through Obi-Wan like it would rattle all the broken pieces in her chest back together. She curls closer, crossing her legs one over the other and then swapping them back, and Cody rights herself carefully, smearing the heel of her palm across her eyes. She curls her hand around Obi-Wan\u2019s head, drawing her face upwards. The air hangs still and heavy, steam curling from their mugs nearly forgotten on the table, and Cody leans down, kissing Obi-Wan. She tastes like coffee and a stale tang of sleep and like home. Obi-Wan grins against her mouth, pressing herself closer, the mugs and sleep entirely forgotten.",
        "story_a": "Ahsoka Tano blinked awake to the gentle hum of Coruscant's never-sleeping cityscape, the early morning light filtering through the blinds of their modest apartment. For once, there was no alarm blaring, no urgent holocall summoning her to some far-off battlefield. Just the soft, serene quiet that only came with rare mornings like these.\n\nShe turned her head, a smile tugging at her lips as she took in the sight beside her. Padm\u00e9 Amidala was still fast asleep, her chest rising and falling with the steady rhythm of deep slumber. In the dim light, Ahsoka could make out the soft curve of Padm\u00e9's cheek, the way her hair splayed out across the pillow in a messy halo. It was a sight she cherished, one she didn't see nearly often enough.\n\nCareful not to disturb her, Ahsoka slipped out of bed, padding softly to the kitchen. Their apartment wasn't large, but it was cozy, filled with mementos from their adventures and trinkets that spoke of shared moments. On the fridge, a collection of holophotos captured snapshots of their lives: laughing faces at a Senate gala, candid shots from a picnic in the underlevels, a blurry image of Ahsoka mid-jump during a sparring match, taken by Padm\u00e9 with a mischievous grin.\n\nAs she set about making caf, Ahsoka couldn't help but smile at the clutter that spoke of their busy lives. A half-finished datapad report from Padm\u00e9's latest Senate mission sat next to Ahsoka's scattered training holos, a testament to their mismatched schedules and endless responsibilities. Yet, in the midst of the chaos, there was a sense of home.\n\nThe smell of brewing caf eventually roused Padm\u00e9, who shuffled into the kitchen, still wrapped in the warmth of sleep. Ahsoka turned, a cup of steaming caf in each hand, and met her partner's sleepy gaze with a soft smile.\n\n\"Good morning,\" she said, handing Padm\u00e9 a cup.\n\nPadm\u00e9 accepted it with a grateful hum, leaning into Ahsoka's side. \"Morning,\" she murmured, taking a tentative sip. \"Is it really morning? Or are we still dreaming?\"\n\nAhsoka chuckled, wrapping an arm around her waist. \"I think it's real. But if it is a dream, I don't want to wake up.\"\n\nThey stood there for a few moments, simply enjoying the quiet togetherness. It was these small, quiet moments that made the apartment feel like home, Ahsoka thought. The way Padm\u00e9's head fit perfectly against her shoulder, the warmth of her body against her side, the shared silence that spoke volumes.\n\n\"Let's make breakfast,\" Padm\u00e9 suggested, pulling away just enough to set her cup down and start rummaging through the cabinets. \"We never get to cook together anymore.\"\n\nAhsoka nodded, eager to prolong this rare morning. They moved around the kitchen with practiced ease, a dance of familiar steps and shared tasks. Ahsoka chopped vegetables while Padm\u00e9 whisked eggs, and together they created a simple, hearty meal.\n\nAs they sat down to eat, Ahsoka glanced out the window, watching the sunlight dance across the buildings of Coruscant. It was a city of endless activity, but in their little apartment, time seemed to slow, allowing them to savor each moment.\n\nPadm\u00e9 reached across the table, her fingers brushing against Ahsoka's. \"Thank you for this,\" she said softly, her eyes shining with affection. \"For being here. For making this feel like home.\"\n\nAhsoka squeezed her hand, her heart swelling with love. \"Always,\" she replied, her voice full of promise. \"I'll always be here for you, Padm\u00e9.\"\n\nThey finished breakfast, the conversation flowing easily, filled with laughter and shared stories. When the last of the dishes were cleared away, they found themselves back in the living room, the clutter of their lives a comforting backdrop.\n\nPadm\u00e9 settled onto the couch, pulling Ahsoka down with her. They curled up together, the warmth of their bodies a soothing balm. Ahsoka rested her head on Padm\u00e9's lap, feeling her fingers gently comb through her montrals.\n\n\"It's funny,\" Padm\u00e9 mused, her voice a soft murmur. \"We've been through so much, seen so many places. But it's these quiet mornings that I treasure the most.\"\n\nAhsoka closed her eyes, letting the feeling of Padm\u00e9's touch and the sound of her voice wash over her. \"Me too,\" she agreed. \"It's the little things that make it all worth it.\"\n\nThey stayed like that for a while, wrapped in the comfort of each other's presence. There was no rush, no pressing demands. Just the simple joy of being together, of sharing a morning that felt like a precious gift.\n\nIn the end, it was these small, quiet moments that made their apartment feel like home. The way they fit together, the shared laughter and tender touches, the knowledge that no matter how chaotic their lives became, they had this\u2014each other.\n\nAnd as the morning light continued to fill their cozy, cluttered apartment, Ahsoka knew that this was all she needed. This love, this home, this beautiful, imperfect life they had built together.",
        "story_b": "The morning light spills softly through the sheer curtains, casting gentle, shifting shadows on the cluttered shelves that line the living room. A soft breeze tugs at the edges of a quilt draped over the back of their well-worn couch, a testament to countless cozy evenings. Aayla Secura stretches, her muscles protesting from the residual tension of the week, and pads into the kitchen, her bare feet whispering against the cool tiles.\n\nThe kitchen is a snug space, filled with the paraphernalia of their lives together\u2014quirky mugs perched precariously on shelves, a collection of spices that spills over the counter, and a haphazard stack of cookbooks that neither of them have ever really used. Aayla smiles to herself as she reaches for a mug, its handle shaped like a lightsaber, a gift from Barriss that she treasures for its sheer ridiculousness.\n\nThe kettle hisses on the stove, a familiar lullaby in the quiet morning. Aayla pours steaming water over the coffee grounds, the aroma rising to fill the kitchen, curling around her like a warm embrace. She glances over her shoulder as she hears a soft rustling from the bedroom.\n\nBarriss Offee appears, her hair tousled and her steps slow, still caught in the hazy transition between sleep and wakefulness. She offers Aayla a sleepy smile, one that crinkles the corners of her eyes and makes Aayla's heart skip with a warmth that has nothing to do with the coffee. \"Morning,\" Barriss murmurs, her voice soft and husky.\n\n\"Morning, love,\" Aayla replies, handing her a mug that reads 'Jedi Master of Coffee,' another of their whimsical treasures. Barriss takes it with a quiet chuckle, her fingers brushing against Aayla's, a small, intimate connection that speaks volumes.\n\nThey settle into their usual spots at the tiny kitchen table, its surface marked with years of use and memories. The soft glow of the morning light bathes them in a gentle, golden hue. Aayla watches Barriss as she absently straightens a stack of bills and letters, a habit that Aayla finds endlessly endearing. It's these little quirks, the familiar rhythm of their lives, that make this space truly theirs.\n\n\"We should probably do something about that,\" Barriss muses, gesturing to the stack with a rueful smile.\n\nAayla grins, taking a sip of her coffee. \"Or we could just pretend it doesn't exist for another day,\" she suggests, the playful banter a comforting echo of countless mornings spent together.\n\nBarriss laughs, a sound that fills the room with warmth. \"You're incorrigible,\" she teases, but there's affection in her gaze as she reaches across the table to squeeze Aayla's hand.\n\nTheir fingers entwine, a silent promise of togetherness, and they sit in companionable silence, the world outside forgotten for a precious moment. The apartment is cluttered, a collection of their lives and the stories they\u2019ve woven together. A well-loved plant sits on the windowsill, its leaves stretching toward the sun, just as they stretch toward each other, seeking and finding solace in shared moments.\n\n\"Do you remember when we first moved in here?\" Barriss asks, her voice tinged with nostalgia.\n\nAayla nods, a smile playing on her lips. \"Of course. We barely had any furniture, and we ate takeout on the floor for weeks.\"\n\n\"And you tried to convince me that a stack of books was a perfectly acceptable substitute for a nightstand,\" Barriss adds, a teasing lilt to her voice.\n\nAayla laughs, the sound bright and joyful. \"Hey, it worked, didn\u2019t it?\" she defends, a playful glint in her eyes.\n\nThese are the moments that define them, the quiet rituals and shared laughter that create a sense of home and belonging. The cluttered shelves and mismatched mugs, the soft hum of the refrigerator, and the gentle glow of the morning light\u2014all of it weaves a tapestry of their life together, each thread a memory, a connection, a testament to their shared journey.\n\nAs the morning unfurls, they linger in their cocoon of warmth and contentment, savoring the rare luxury of time spent together. Aayla leans back in her chair, her gaze resting on Barriss as she sketches idle patterns on the tabletop with her finger, lost in thought.\n\n\"What are you thinking about?\" Aayla asks softly, her curiosity tinged with the simple desire to share in Barriss's world.\n\nBarriss looks up, a smile curving her lips. \"Just how lucky I am,\" she replies, her voice tender. \"To have this, to have you.\"\n\nAayla\u2019s heart swells with love, a feeling as vast and endless as the galaxy itself. She stands, moving around the table to join Barriss, wrapping her arms around her from behind. Barriss leans back against her, their silhouettes blending together, two parts of a whole.\n\nThe morning stretches before them, a canvas waiting to be filled with the quiet beauty of their everyday moments. For now, they are content to simply be, wrapped in the warmth of their shared space, the cozy clutter of their apartment a testament to the life they've built together. In this small, intimate cocoon, they find their home, a place where they belong, and the promise of countless mornings yet to come.",

        "ground_truth": "The flat is quiet when Obi-Wan manages to wrangle the door open through a mess of foliage and delicate string lights that throng their hallway. No need to worry about alarms or a security system when they had the normal mess and clutter of everyday life. She steps over Cody\u2019s work boots, placed into the same spot every day, and loosely toes her own shoes off next to them. The sole gapes wide as she does so, revealing the softer innards of fabric straining away from rubber, and she ignores it as best as she can.\nTape is a godsend and where tape wouldn\u2019t fix it, there is a small tube of superglue in one of the drawers she can ask Cody to try. The pads of Obi-Wan\u2019s fingers are still discoloured from her last attempt at trying to fix a pair of her shoes so she\u2019ll pass the problem to more capable hands. Her jacket is summarily discarded onto the back of the sofa and she lingers long enough to retrieve her lanyard and keys from the pocket, returning them to their forced exclusion into the small bowl on the counter for the next two days. The time off from work stretches luxuriously empty, free from any mandatory training or social obligations, and Obi-Wan skirts around the potential issue of their unique living arrangement as she flicks on the kettle, pulling one mug out of the cupboard, pausing and returning for another. Cody has the next couple of days off as well, a rarity with their opposite working schedules. Obi-Wan makes Cody\u2019s cup of coffee how she likes it, strong and sweet and a splash of milk first despite Obi-Wan\u2019s moral objections to the concept, and rifles through her small collection of tea. There is no caffeine in her immediate future if she wants to sleep for any part of the morning; another hidden delight of adulthood that\u2019s tripped her over and bruised up her face. She chews on the tip of her tongue as she draws a bag free, dropping it into her cup and chasing it with the boiling water.\nA door creaks further in the apartment and Obi-Wan rocks back onto her heels, a dozy prickle of contentment resting on the nape of her neck. Cody\u2019s steps are steady, sleep-slow and her slippers smack against the floor as she makes her way into the sitting room. Much of her isn\u2019t visible, a walking plaid blanket that hides her face and her curls, but the tattoo over her calf is clearly visible with one of her pyjama trouser legs drawn up over her knee while the other falls to the floor.\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Obi-Wan says, breaking into a yawn that she doesn\u2019t bother to hide behind her hand. Her manners are ingrained into her bones but even that runs thin and fallow after so long spent at work.\n\u201cG\u2019morning,\u201d Cody responds, her words muffled through fabric and sleep. Obi-Wan can picture her expression, her eyes still mostly closed and her gaze filtered through her impossibly long lashes and her grin easily worn in.\nObi-Wan follows her, both mugs in hand, and places them onto the clear spaces on their cluttered coffee table. She has options for seating, the low slouch of a battered armchair Obi-Wan carried to her student dorm, then flat, then four different flatshares before this one or the other end of the sofa that Cody has already claimed, piled high with blankets and a handful of cushions that Cody would claim as family heirlooms at the first hint of decluttering. She sits on Cody\u2019s legs stretched out over the seat before she wriggles backwards into the hollow created. Cody grunts, shifting her legs straighter before she reaches down to tug a section of the blanket free, pulling it over Obi-Wan.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in early,\u201d Cody mumbles. She\u2019s partially spilled out of the blanket now wrapped around her waist. She stretches and her shirt rises with the motion, everything about her solid and real and beautiful.\nObi-Wan hums in agreement, leaning sideways against Cody who absorbs the motion with a soft sound. She wraps an arm around Obi-Wan\u2019s shoulders, playing with the loose edge of her sleeve. \u201cMove your head up a bit? You\u2019re lying right on my tit.\u201d Obi-Wan does so, her face flushed but it\u2019s fine. It happens. Cody continues, her voice a little more structured as she wakes, \u201cFigured you\u2019d like the bed to sleep after your night shift so I came out here for the morning. It\u2019ll be nice having us both around the house, little human company to prove I\u2019m not just another cog in the machine.\u201d\nIf Cody is a cog, then she would be the best cog imaginable, something brimming with lots of interlocking teeth, a fundamental piece of the machinery. Obi-Wan tells her this because why wouldn\u2019t she? It makes perfect sense.\nCody tips her head back as she laughs, the sound vibrating through Obi-Wan like it would rattle all the broken pieces in her chest back together. She curls closer, crossing her legs one over the other and then swapping them back, and Cody rights herself carefully, smearing the heel of her palm across her eyes. She curls her hand around Obi-Wan\u2019s head, drawing her face upwards. The air hangs still and heavy, steam curling from their mugs nearly forgotten on the table, and Cody leans down, kissing Obi-Wan. She tastes like coffee and a stale tang of sleep and like home. Obi-Wan grins against her mouth, pressing herself closer, the mugs and sleep entirely forgotten.",
        "story_a": "Ahsoka Tano blinked awake to the gentle hum of Coruscant's never-sleeping cityscape, the early morning light filtering through the blinds of their modest apartment. For once, there was no alarm blaring, no urgent holocall summoning her to some far-off battlefield. Just the soft, serene quiet that only came with rare mornings like these.\n\nShe turned her head, a smile tugging at her lips as she took in the sight beside her. Padm\u00e9 Amidala was still fast asleep, her chest rising and falling with the steady rhythm of deep slumber. In the dim light, Ahsoka could make out the soft curve of Padm\u00e9's cheek, the way her hair splayed out across the pillow in a messy halo. It was a sight she cherished, one she didn't see nearly often enough.\n\nCareful not to disturb her, Ahsoka slipped out of bed, padding softly to the kitchen. Their apartment wasn't large, but it was cozy, filled with mementos from their adventures and trinkets that spoke of shared moments. On the fridge, a collection of holophotos captured snapshots of their lives: laughing faces at a Senate gala, candid shots from a picnic in the underlevels, a blurry image of Ahsoka mid-jump during a sparring match, taken by Padm\u00e9 with a mischievous grin.\n\nAs she set about making caf, Ahsoka couldn't help but smile at the clutter that spoke of their busy lives. A half-finished datapad report from Padm\u00e9's latest Senate mission sat next to Ahsoka's scattered training holos, a testament to their mismatched schedules and endless responsibilities. Yet, in the midst of the chaos, there was a sense of home.\n\nThe smell of brewing caf eventually roused Padm\u00e9, who shuffled into the kitchen, still wrapped in the warmth of sleep. Ahsoka turned, a cup of steaming caf in each hand, and met her partner's sleepy gaze with a soft smile.\n\n\"Good morning,\" she said, handing Padm\u00e9 a cup.\n\nPadm\u00e9 accepted it with a grateful hum, leaning into Ahsoka's side. \"Morning,\" she murmured, taking a tentative sip. \"Is it really morning? Or are we still dreaming?\"\n\nAhsoka chuckled, wrapping an arm around her waist. \"I think it's real. But if it is a dream, I don't want to wake up.\"\n\nThey stood there for a few moments, simply enjoying the quiet togetherness. It was these small, quiet moments that made the apartment feel like home, Ahsoka thought. The way Padm\u00e9's head fit perfectly against her shoulder, the warmth of her body against her side, the shared silence that spoke volumes.\n\n\"Let's make breakfast,\" Padm\u00e9 suggested, pulling away just enough to set her cup down and start rummaging through the cabinets. \"We never get to cook together anymore.\"\n\nAhsoka nodded, eager to prolong this rare morning. They moved around the kitchen with practiced ease, a dance of familiar steps and shared tasks. Ahsoka chopped vegetables while Padm\u00e9 whisked eggs, and together they created a simple, hearty meal.\n\nAs they sat down to eat, Ahsoka glanced out the window, watching the sunlight dance across the buildings of Coruscant. It was a city of endless activity, but in their little apartment, time seemed to slow, allowing them to savor each moment.\n\nPadm\u00e9 reached across the table, her fingers brushing against Ahsoka's. \"Thank you for this,\" she said softly, her eyes shining with affection. \"For being here. For making this feel like home.\"\n\nAhsoka squeezed her hand, her heart swelling with love. \"Always,\" she replied, her voice full of promise. \"I'll always be here for you, Padm\u00e9.\"\n\nThey finished breakfast, the conversation flowing easily, filled with laughter and shared stories. When the last of the dishes were cleared away, they found themselves back in the living room, the clutter of their lives a comforting backdrop.\n\nPadm\u00e9 settled onto the couch, pulling Ahsoka down with her. They curled up together, the warmth of their bodies a soothing balm. Ahsoka rested her head on Padm\u00e9's lap, feeling her fingers gently comb through her montrals.\n\n\"It's funny,\" Padm\u00e9 mused, her voice a soft murmur. \"We've been through so much, seen so many places. But it's these quiet mornings that I treasure the most.\"\n\nAhsoka closed her eyes, letting the feeling of Padm\u00e9's touch and the sound of her voice wash over her. \"Me too,\" she agreed. \"It's the little things that make it all worth it.\"\n\nThey stayed like that for a while, wrapped in the comfort of each other's presence. There was no rush, no pressing demands. Just the simple joy of being together, of sharing a morning that felt like a precious gift.\n\nIn the end, it was these small, quiet moments that made their apartment feel like home.

        "story_b": "The morning sun filtered softly through the curtains, casting gentle patterns across the cluttered apartment. A warmth settled in the room, the kind that felt like home, a feeling both women had yearned for amidst their hectic lives. Aayla Secura stretched languidly in the bed, turning to find Luminara Unduli already awake, her gaze soft and contemplative as she watched the morning unfold.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Aayla murmured, her voice husky with sleep. She reached out, brushing her fingers gently against Luminara\u2019s cheek.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Luminara replied, her lips curling into a smile that spoke of peace. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s been forever since we\u2019ve had a morning like this.\u201d\n\nAayla nodded, her thoughts drifting to the weeks of missions and responsibilities that had kept them apart, their schedules a tangle of duty and distance. But today, the galaxy seemed to pause just for them. A shared day, a quiet morning. It was a gift.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make us some coffee,\u201d Aayla said, reluctantly pulling away from the warmth of the bed. She padded softly across the wooden floor, the boards creaking familiarly beneath her feet, a comforting sound in the tranquil silence.\n\nIn the small kitchen, she moved with practiced ease, the ritual of making coffee a cherished one. She knew exactly how Luminara liked it\u2014a hint of spice, a touch of sweetness. As the aroma filled the air, Aayla glanced around the apartment, taking in its cozy clutter. It was a space filled with their lives, their memories. Books stacked haphazardly on shelves, a vibrant tapestry from Ryloth draped over the couch, and a small, potted plant Luminara had insisted on rescuing from the market.\n\nWith two steaming mugs in hand, Aayla returned to the bedroom, where Luminara had already begun to tidy the rumpled sheets. Their eyes met, and Aayla\u2019s heart swelled at the sight\u2014Luminara, here, now, in this shared sanctuary.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Luminara said, accepting the mug and taking a careful sip. \u201cPerfect, as always.\u201d\n\nThey settled together on the bed, the quiet punctuated by the soft clinks of their mugs and the distant hum of Coruscant\u2019s bustling cityscape. The city beyond their window was alive, but here, in this moment, it was just the two of them.\n\n\u201cDo you remember our first morning here?\u201d Luminara asked, her voice tinged with nostalgia.\n\nAayla chuckled softly, the memory vivid. \u201cHow could I forget? We barely had any furniture. Just that one rickety chair and a mattress on the floor.\u201d\n\nLuminara laughed, the sound bright and full. \u201cAnd you insisted on making breakfast, even though we had only one pan.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, those pancakes were passable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were burnt.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, fine, they were a little crispy.\u201d\n\nTheir laughter mingled with the morning light, a melody of shared history and affection. Aayla reached for Luminara\u2019s hand, their fingers interlocking easily, naturally. In the quiet, she could feel the heartbeat of their home, the steady rhythm of their lives intertwined.\n\n\u201cWhat do you dream about?\u201d Luminara asked softly, her thumb tracing circles on Aayla\u2019s hand.\n\nAayla paused, considering. \u201cI dream about this, about us. Having the time to just be.\u201d\n\nLuminara\u2019s eyes softened, her gaze holding a depth of understanding. \u201cI dream about finding peace, amidst everything. And you\u2019re always there, my anchor.\u201d\n\nA comfortable silence enveloped them, the truth of their words settling gently in the space between. Aayla leaned over, placing a gentle kiss on Luminara\u2019s temple, a silent promise of presence, of support.\n\nThe morning stretched on, a luxurious expanse of time unclaimed by duties or demands. They moved through their routines in tandem, a seamless dance of familiarity. Luminara made breakfast, her movements precise and graceful, while Aayla set the table, placing a single, vibrant flower in a small vase at the center\u2014a simple act of love, a symbol of appreciation.\n\nAs they sat down to eat, the sun climbed higher, casting a golden glow over everything. They shared stories, dreams, and laughter, weaving them into the fabric of their day. Each word, each gesture, a thread that strengthened the tapestry of their lives.\n\nLater, when the dishes were cleared and the warmth of the sun began to wane, they found themselves back on the couch, wrapped in the tapestry that held so many memories.\n\n\u201cI wish we could have more mornings like this,\u201d Aayla said, her voice a soft echo in the quiet room.\n\n\u201cWe will,\u201d Luminara replied, her words a gentle certainty. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way.\u201d\n\nAayla rested her head against Luminara\u2019s shoulder, closing her eyes and letting the peace of the moment wash over her. The world beyond their windows continued to spin, but here, in their cozy, cluttered apartment, they had found their home, their heart.\n\nAnd that was enough.",

The apartment was a comforting mess, a testament to their lives\u2014mismatched furniture, stacks of books threatening to topple over, and a collage of holophotos documenting their adventures, each frame capturing a moment of laughter or triumph. In the small kitchen area, she filled the kettle, the gentle sound of water pouring a soothing backdrop to her thoughts.\n\nAs the kettle boiled, she breathed in the aroma of freshly ground coffee, the scent mingling with the crisp morning air. It was rare to have a morning like this, where time seemed to stretch indulgently before her, promising hours not filled with missions or meetings.

Coffee\u2019s ready.\u201d\n\nBarriss sat up, the quilt slipping to her waist, and reached for the mug. \u201cYou\u2019re a lifesaver,\u201d she said, cradling the mug in her hands, letting the warmth seep into her skin.\n\nThey sat together on the bed, sipping their coffee in comfortable silence. Ahsoka watched the play of sunlight across Barriss\u2019s features, her mind wandering through the tapestry of their shared life. \u201cRemember our first apartment?\u201d she asked, a playful lilt to her voice.\n\nBarriss chuckled, nodding. \u201cHow could I forget? The heater was always broken, and the neighbors had a band practice at all hours.\u201d\n\nAhsoka laughed, the sound brightening the room. \u201cWe had to wear three layers just to stay warm.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we made it work,\u201d Barriss said, a soft smile gracing her lips. \u201cAnd look at us now.\u201d\n\nThe morning unfolded with a leisurely grace, each moment savored like a rare delicacy. They moved to the living room, the couch cushions worn but familiar beneath them. Ahsoka reached for a stack of laundry, the mundane task transformed into something comforting in its domesticity.\n\nBarriss joined her, sorting through the pile. \u201cI think this sock\u2019s mate was lost to hyperspace,\u201d she teased, holding up a lone blue sock.\n\nAhsoka grinned, shaking her head. \u201cIt\u2019s probably with all those missing data chips.\u201d\n\nTheir laughter filled the space, a melody of shared joy and history. The intimacy of folding laundry together, of teasing over mismatched socks, was its own kind of magic, weaving a tapestry of connection and warmth.\n\nLater, as they settled on the couch, Barriss leaned into Ahsoka, her head resting on her shoulder. Ahsoka threaded her fingers through Barriss\u2019s hair, gently brushing through the tangles. The quiet moment stretched between them, filled with unspoken understanding and the comfort of shared silence.\n\nAhsoka\u2019s thoughts drifted as she watched Barriss, who had drifted into a light doze. She marveled at the ease of their companionship, the way they fit together like pieces of a puzzle. The softness of the morning light, the warmth of their intertwined fingers, the simple act of being together\u2014it all felt like home.\n\nThe city outside continued its relentless pace, but within their cozy haven, time slowed, each second a gentle heartbeat in the rhythm of their lives. Ahsoka pressed a kiss to Barriss\u2019s temple, a silent vow of love and gratitude for these small, quiet moments.\n\nEventually, Barriss stirred, blinking sleepily. \u201cI must look a mess,\u201d she murmured, reaching up to smooth her hair.\n\nAhsoka chuckled, a teasing glint in her eyes. \u201cA beautiful mess, maybe.\u201d\n\nBarriss rolled her eyes, a playful smile tugging at her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re biased.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Ahsoka agreed, her voice soft with affection.\n\nAs the morning continued its lazy unfurling, they remained wrapped in the comfort of each other\u2019s presence. The world outside could wait. For now, it was just them, a rare morning off in their cozy, cluttered apartment\u2014a sanctuary of love built from the small, quiet moments that made it feel like home.",

        "ground_truth": "The Airship *Vent lger* was buffeted slightly by a crosswind and the Captain ably rebalanced the various brass propellers on each side of the large wooden brass hull. The journey felt, for most, to have been taking an age but the weather had held until recently blazing sun on most days and only the occasional windswept day to break the repetition. The launch party had been twenty days prior, the Emperor had made sure it was a hushed affair. He did not want to boast to the world that France was continuing to expand its influence in the Indian Ocean before the colony collapsed in failure and misery he would announce the success of the colony venture once he *knew* that the colony was flourishing. Whilst some local, Marseilles, press was allowed to interview and photograph some of the prominent guests aboard the *Vent lger*; the Emperor ensured that no one was there to see the convicts and exiles board the airship during the dead of night. Once aboard the ship, however, the convicts and exiles were not imprisoned in the brig or forced out of earshot this journey and colony would be their penance and their sentence they were now free amongst the other inhabitants of the *Vent lger* prior to the journey. It was plain to see that many distrusted or despised their new fellow colonists on the journey and many of the ex-convicts spent their time together towards the rear of the main cabin playing poker under the watchful eyes of the military trained aboard. Insurrection was always a threat and the Captain had reiterated after launch that any attempt to circumvent the Emperors will would lead to a swift execution. It was early afternoon, so most of the colonists were milling around the cavernous main cabin which stretched the length of the airship. The glass ceiling allowed them to see the hefty dirigible above them, connected by heavy copper cables to the main deck, and the Indian Sun illuminated the main cabin brightly. Katia Dufresne, the ships cook, was ably constructing the afternoon buffet in the far corner of the room her small but efficient kitchen emanating the delicious smell of bouillabaisse through the cabin. It seemed like all days previous had been an incoherent blur of orders from Mayor Berlioz and Captain Arceneaux to check, and then re-check, the limited supplies that the Emperor had given the expedition and assist with general maintenance of the aging airship. This blustery afternoon, however, the Captain and Mayor seemed predisposed to leave the colonists be and, for the first time on the airship, the colonists had more than a few rushed minutes to really introduce themselves and their hopes for the colony. Despite all the work, boredom was commonplace amongst the colonists also. The main cabin had some battered board games, cards and dice which the ex-convicts mainly used to crudely gamble and a vast collection of second-hand books for them to read, however, being trapped on the airship was soon becoming intolerable for many aboard. At the helm of the ship, where the glass ceiling curved downwards towards the hull to allow them a clear perspective of the route in front of them, stood the two most important figures aboard the *Vent lger*. Beside the brass ships wheel, Captain Arceneaux stood frowning down at the choppy sea that was barely obscured by a few wispy clouds. Captain Arceneaux was an intimidating figure, stood bolt upright with one of his aged hands firmly clasped around the ships wheel, he had a greying beard that that matched his precision haircut. He had seen battle many times in service of the French Empire and, it was plain to see, that being tasked with delivering a colonial mission was considerably beneath him. The legend of him evading Russian flak fire to drop bombs on St Petersburg had been the talk of France less than twenty years ago and now he found himself having to evade the faint wind that blew across the ocean. He was eager to return to France and prepare for the inevitable, as many at home saw it, war with Britain. Roughly eighteen hours til we reach our destination, the Emperor will be pleased, thats an entire day ahead of schedule. He spoke confidently, staring at his companion. Beside him, only slightly shorter than the Captain, Mayor Cyril Berlioz smiled broadly and pulled out a miniature telescope to comb the horizon with. This is most fortuitous news, Captain Arceneaux, Cyril said loudly as he collapsed the telescope once more, a little disappointed that the island was not yet in view. Cyril was a man filled confidence and spirit, the son of a well-respected and revered industrialist back in Marseille; Cyril has been ordained the task of establishing the colony by the Emperor a real chance to make his own name in the Empire. Cyril was, perhaps, a little ostentatious and arrogant in conversation but was a much more approachable character when compared to the indomitable Captain. Cyril turned to the bustling main cabin and announced Less than twenty-four hours colonists and our new lives commence!",
        "story_a": "The *Vent lger* groaned and creaked as it cut through the swirling mists of the Atlantic, its wooden hull a patchwork of repairs and reinforcements, a testament to countless voyages and the relentless passage of time. The airship, a grand relic of a bygone era, carried within its belly a disparate group of souls, each with their own dreams, fears, and secrets. The hum of the propellers was a constant reminder of the fragile thread that bound them to their destination, the uncharted island where they were to establish a new French colony.\n\nThe main deck was a bustling microcosm of the old world, a place where the hopes of the hopeful colonists intertwined with the wary glances of the ex-convicts who had been granted a second chance. The air was thick with the mingling scents of sweat, sea brine, and the faint, sweet aroma of the exotic spices that had been stowed away in the cargo hold. The sky above was a tumultuous canvas of grey and white, the sun a distant, hazy orb that offered little warmth.\n\nJean-Baptiste Leclerc, the ship's captain, stood at the helm, his weathered face etched with lines of determination and caution. His eyes, a piercing blue, scanned the horizon as if searching for any sign of the land that had eluded them for so long. His hand rested on the worn wooden wheel, fingers tapping out a rhythm that spoke of both impatience and resolve. He was a man of few words, but his presence commanded respect\u2014a necessary trait for maintaining order among such a volatile mix of passengers.\n\nAmong the colonists, Lucille Dubois stood out like a beacon of hope. Her auburn hair, tied back in a practical braid, framed a face that was both kind and resolute. She moved with a quiet grace, her hands busy with tasks that kept the community functioning\u2014mending clothes, tending to the small herb garden that she had insisted on bringing aboard, and offering a comforting word to those who needed it. Her eyes, a deep green, held a spark of determination that had inspired many of her fellow travelers to believe in the possibility of a new beginning.\n\nIn stark contrast, Pierre Lafitte, a former smuggler turned reluctant colonist, lurked in the shadows, his sharp eyes always watching, always calculating. His dark hair and beard gave him a rugged appearance, and the scar that traced a line from his temple to his jaw was a silent testament to a past filled with danger and deceit. He had been given a choice: rot in a French prison or join the expedition. He had chosen the latter, but his motivations were far from pure.\n\nAs the journey wore on, tensions simmered just below the surface. The close quarters and the uncertainty of their mission had begun to take their toll. Whispers of sabotage and hidden motives spread like wildfire, each rumor a spark that threatened to ignite the volatile mix of personalities. The ex-convicts were the first to be suspected, their pasts making them easy targets for mistrust. But as the days passed, it became clear that the seeds of discord had been sown more deeply than anyone had anticipated.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the sky in shades of crimson and gold, a sense of unease settled over the *Vent lger*. The passengers gathered in small groups, speaking in hushed tones, their eyes darting nervously about. Lucille, sensing the growing unrest, sought out Captain Leclerc. She found him on the aft deck, his silhouette a dark outline against the fading light.\n\n\"Captain,\" she began, her voice steady despite the anxiety that gnawed at her. \"The people are afraid. They speak of sabotage, of hidden agendas. We must do something to quell their fears.\"\n\nLeclerc turned to her, his expression unreadable. \"I am aware, Mademoiselle Dubois. But we must tread carefully. If there is a saboteur among us, we cannot afford to tip our hand too soon.\"\n\nLucille nodded, her mind racing. \"What do you suggest?\"\n\nBefore Leclerc could respond, a shout rang out from below decks. The sound of hurried footsteps followed, and soon a crowd had gathered around the entrance to the cargo hold. Lucille and Leclerc exchanged a glance and hurried to join the throng.\n\nIn the dim light of the hold, they found Pierre Lafitte standing over an open crate, its contents spilling onto the floor. The smell of gunpowder was unmistakable. \"What is the meaning of this?\" Leclerc demanded, his voice a low growl.\n\nPierre looked up, his expression one of feigned innocence. \"I was merely inspecting the cargo, Captain. It seems we have more than just spices and supplies aboard.\"\n\nThe murmurs of the crowd grew louder, fear and suspicion evident in their eyes. Lucille stepped forward, her voice clear and commanding. \"We must remain calm. This is precisely what the saboteur wants\u2014to sow discord among us. We must stand together if we are to succeed.\"\n\nLeclerc nodded in agreement. \"Search the ship. We will find whoever is responsible for this treachery. And when we do, they will answer for their actions.\"\n\nAs the passengers dispersed, the air was thick with tension and unspoken questions. Who among them could be trusted? What other dangers lay hidden within the aging airship? And would they ever reach their destination, or would their mission be doomed before it even began?\n\nThe *Vent lger* continued its journey, a fragile vessel carrying the hopes and fears of its passengers toward an uncertain future.",
        "story_b": "The airship *Vent L\u00e9ger* floated gracefully amidst the vast expanse of azure sky, its shadow a fleeting whisper upon the shimmering sea below. It was an impressive marvel of human ingenuity, yet the creaking of its wooden beams and the hum of its engines spoke of its age. Inside, a tapestry of lives entwined as hopeful colonists and wary ex-convicts shared the cramped quarters, each with their own dreams and demons.\n\nPreparation for the journey had been meticulous. The crew, seasoned and diligent, had inspected the gas cells with the utmost care, ensuring that every seam was sealed, every valve secure. Provisions were loaded, counted, and recounted, as each passenger clung to the knowledge that their survival depended on these supplies. The airship, a vessel of both hope and desperation, was their temporary home\u2014a floating microcosm of society with its communal dining areas and tightly packed sleeping quarters.\n\nJean, a man of rugged appearance and a shadowed past, moved quietly among the passengers. Once a convict, he now sought redemption in this new venture. His eyes, marked by years of hardship, softened as he watched a young family of colonists\u2014a mother, father, and their small daughter, Marie. He felt a stirring of purpose in helping them, a chance to rewrite his story and forge complex alliances that could protect them all.\n\nThe airship journeyed onward, the rhythmic sway of its flight a constant companion. From the observation deck, passengers could gaze at the panoramic views, the horizon a distant promise of new beginnings. Yet, within the confines of the *Vent L\u00e9ger*, whispers of sabotage began to ripple through the air like an unseen current. Unease settled among the passengers as unspoken fears lingered, casting long shadows on their collective hope.\n\nThe French colony mission was shrouded in secrecy, a venture driven by political motivations as intricate as the network of ropes and sails that held the airship aloft. For some, it was an escape from oppressive regimes, a chance to seek resources untapped and lives unbound by the constraints of their past. Yet, others saw it as a prison, a gilded cage carrying them to a fate unknown.\n\nIn the communal dining area, tensions simmered as passengers shared meals and stories. Jean sat across from the young family, his presence a reassuring anchor amid the uncertainty. \"We will make it,\" he assured them, his voice steady despite the tumult within. \"This journey is our chance to start anew.\"\n\nBut hidden motives lurked beneath the surface, and not all aboard shared the vision of unity. Conflicts emerged, fueled by past grievances and the strain of confinement. A murmur of discontent grew louder, as old alliances threatened to unravel and new ones formed in the crucible of necessity.\n\nAs the journey neared its end, the airship's crew faced challenges that tested their expertise. Aerodynamic lift required constant adjustments, navigation by celestial charts demanded precision, and ballast needed careful management to ensure their course remained true. The *Vent L\u00e9ger* was both a symbol of hope and a testament to human resilience, yet its fragile balance could be disrupted by the smallest of acts.\n\nJean, driven by a sense of urgency, began to unravel the threads of sabotage whispered among the passengers. He knew that the fate of the airship\u2014and all its souls\u2014depended on uncovering the truth hidden in plain sight. His search led him to the lower decks, where shadows danced among the machinery, and secrets lay in wait.\n\nThere, he discovered a plot to undermine the mission, a plan woven from the tangled webs of human ambition and fear. A group of ex-convicts, embittered by their pasts and distrustful of the future, sought to sabotage the airship, to steer their fate into their own hands. Jean's heart pounded with the weight of this revelation, a crossroads of choice laid before him.\n\nHe returned to the passengers, his resolve firm and voice unwavering. \"We must stand together,\" he declared, calling upon the strength of unity to counter the forces of division. \"Our survival depends on it.\"\n\nWith the cooperation of those he had come to trust, Jean managed to thwart the sabotage, restoring a fragile peace among the passengers. As the *Vent L\u00e9ger* approached the uncharted island, the tensions that had threatened to tear them apart began to subside, replaced by a shared sense of purpose.\n\nThe airship descended, its wooden beams groaning as it prepared to land. The colonists and ex-convicts, once disparate souls, now stood united by the trials they had faced. The island awaited them, a blank canvas upon which they could paint new lives, free from the shadows of their past.\n\nAs the first foot touched the ground, Jean felt the weight of redemption lift from his shoulders. The journey had tested them all, but they had emerged stronger, bound by the secrets and struggles that had defined their passage. Together, they would forge a future unknown, guided by the lessons of the sky.",

        "story_b": "The *Vent lger* creaked and groaned like an old man with each gust of wind, its patchwork sails billowing under the pale sky. Built decades ago, the airship was a testament to engineering prowess and human ambition, though time had etched its story into the wooden beams and brass fixtures with an indelible hand. As it sliced through the azure expanse, the salty sea air mingled with the constant hum of engines, weaving a tapestry of sound that was both familiar and foreboding to those aboard.\n\nAmong its diverse passengers, the hopeful colonists clung to dreams of new beginnings on the uncharted island promised by France, while the ex-convicts, shadows of past misdeeds, watched the horizon with wary eyes. Their disparate worlds collided within the narrow corridors and dimly lit cabins, creating an atmosphere thick with tension and unspoken fears.\n\n\"Watch where you step, Pierre!\" a gruff voice growled, as a burly ex-convict jostled a young colonist aside. The incident sparked a heated argument over the limited resources stowed in the cargo hold, revealing the simmering unrest beneath the surface. Whispers of sabotage spread like wildfire, igniting suspicion and paranoia among the passengers.\n\nThe airship was a labyrinth of cramped spaces and hidden corners, each turn revealing another layer of intrigue. In the dim glow of the mess hall, Claude, a wiry man with a sharp gaze, leaned toward his companion, his voice a conspiratorial whisper. \"Did you hear about the fire in the cargo hold last night? They say someone did it on purpose.\"\n\nHis companion, a woman with hopeful eyes and a resolute jaw, frowned, her mind racing with possibilities. \"But why? What could they gain from sabotaging our journey?\"\n\nClaude shrugged, his expression inscrutable. \"Who knows? Perhaps some don't want us to reach the island. Or maybe they have their own plans for when we get there.\"\n\nAs the days passed, mysterious events punctuated the voyage, each adding to the growing sense of unease. A navigational chart went missing, causing the crew to scramble and recalibrate their course. An essential piece of machinery was found dismantled, its parts scattered like breadcrumbs leading to an unseen hand.\n\nIn the belly of the ship, where the air was thick with oil and sweat, tensions flared anew. \"We can't trust them,\" a colonist murmured, nodding toward a group of ex-convicts huddled in the corner, their eyes flickering with silent communication.\n\nA convict, overhearing the remark, spat on the ground, his voice a low rumble. \"You think you're better than us, eh? Just because we made mistakes?\"\n\nThe colonist bristled, but before he could retort, a commanding voice cut through the air. \"Enough!\" Captain Leclerc stood tall, his presence demanding attention. \"We're all in this together. Petty squabbles will only lead to our ruin.\"\n\nYet even as the captain spoke of unity, the seeds of distrust had been sown deep, their roots intertwining with the passengers' hopes and fears. Each night, the airship's corridors echoed with whispered conversations, alliances forming and dissolving in the shadows.\n\nIn the quiet of her cabin, Marie, a young woman with a penchant for observation, stared out the small porthole, her mind a whirl of thoughts. She had seen the furtive exchanges, the glances heavy with unspoken intent. Hidden motives lurked beneath the surface, like predators waiting to strike.\n\nAs the island drew nearer, the airship's passengers found themselves at a crossroads. Would they stand together against the unknown, or would the fractures within their ranks widen into chasms too deep to bridge?\n\nThe evening before their anticipated arrival, Marie found herself in the ship's library, a sanctuary of sorts amidst the chaos. She thumbed through a well-worn atlas, the pages whispering secrets of lands undiscovered. Lost in thought, she didn't hear the approach of another until a shadow fell across the page.\n\n\"Do you think we'll make it?\" The voice was soft, hesitant, and Marie looked up to see Jacques, a fellow colonist, his brow furrowed with uncertainty.\n\n\"I hope so,\" Marie replied, her voice steady despite the doubt gnawing at her. \"But we must be vigilant. There are those among us who harbor secrets, and we can't let them endanger our future.\"\n\nJacques nodded, his resolve hardening. \"Then we'll watch each other's backs. We can't allow fear to divide us.\"\n\nAs the night deepened, the *Vent lger* sailed onward, its passengers united by a fragile thread of hope and determination. The uncharted island loomed on the horizon, a promise of new beginnings and untold challenges. Together, they would face whatever awaited them, for better or worse.",

        "prompt": "Aboard the aging airship *Vent lger*, a mix of hopeful colonists and ex-convicts hurtle toward an uncharted island to establish a secret French colony. As tensions rise and the journey nears its end, whispers of sabotage and hidden motives begin to spread\u2014what secrets are hidden among the passengers, and will they reach their destination unscathed?",
        "ground_truth": "The Airship *Vent lger* was buffeted slightly by a crosswind and the Captain ably rebalanced the various brass propellers on each side of the large wooden brass hull. The journey felt, for most, to have been taking an age but the weather had held until recently blazing sun on most days and only the occasional windswept day to break the repetition. The launch party had been twenty days prior, the Emperor had made sure it was a hushed affair. He did not want to boast to the world that France was continuing to expand its influence in the Indian Ocean before the colony collapsed in failure and misery he would announce the success of the colony venture once he *knew* that the colony was flourishing. Whilst some local, Marseilles, press was allowed to interview and photograph some of the prominent guests aboard the *Vent lger*; the Emperor ensured that no one was there to see the convicts and exiles board the airship during the dead of night. Once aboard the ship, however, the convicts and exiles were not imprisoned in the brig or forced out of earshot this journey and colony would be their penance and their sentence they were now free amongst the other inhabitants of the *Vent lger* prior to the journey. It was plain to see that many distrusted or despised their new fellow colonists on the journey and many of the ex-convicts spent their time together towards the rear of the main cabin playing poker under the watchful eyes of the military trained aboard. Insurrection was always a threat and the Captain had reiterated after launch that any attempt to circumvent the Emperors will would lead to a swift execution. It was early afternoon, so most of the colonists were milling around the cavernous main cabin which stretched the length of the airship. The glass ceiling allowed them to see the hefty dirigible above them, connected by heavy copper cables to the main deck, and the Indian Sun illuminated the main cabin brightly. Katia Dufresne, the ships cook, was ably constructing the afternoon buffet in the far corner of the room her small but efficient kitchen emanating the delicious smell of bouillabaisse through the cabin. It seemed like all days previous had been an incoherent blur of orders from Mayor Berlioz and Captain Arceneaux to check, and then re-check, the limited supplies that the Emperor had given the expedition and assist with general maintenance of the aging airship. This blustery afternoon, however, the Captain and Mayor seemed predisposed to leave the colonists be and, for the first time on the airship, the colonists had more than a few rushed minutes to really introduce themselves and their hopes for the colony. Despite all the work, boredom was commonplace amongst the colonists also. The main cabin had some battered board games, cards and dice which the ex-convicts mainly used to crudely gamble and a vast collection of second-hand books for them to read, however, being trapped on the airship was soon becoming intolerable for many aboard. At the helm of the ship, where the glass ceiling curved downwards towards the hull to allow them a clear perspective of the route in front of them, stood the two most important figures aboard the *Vent lger*. Beside the brass ships wheel, Captain Arceneaux stood frowning down at the choppy sea that was barely obscured by a few wispy clouds. Captain Arceneaux was an intimidating figure, stood bolt upright with one of his aged hands firmly clasped around the ships wheel, he had a greying beard that that matched his precision haircut. He had seen battle many times in service of the French Empire and, it was plain to see, that being tasked with delivering a colonial mission was considerably beneath him. The legend of him evading Russian flak fire to drop bombs on St Petersburg had been the talk of France less than twenty years ago and now he found himself having to evade the faint wind that blew across the ocean. He was eager to return to France and prepare for the inevitable, as many at home saw it, war with Britain. Roughly eighteen hours til we reach our destination, the Emperor will be pleased, thats an entire day ahead of schedule. He spoke confidently, staring at his companion. Beside him, only slightly shorter than the Captain, Mayor Cyril Berlioz smiled broadly and pulled out a miniature telescope to comb the horizon with. This is most fortuitous news, Captain Arceneaux, Cyril said loudly as he collapsed the telescope once more, a little disappointed that the island was not yet in view. Cyril was a man filled confidence and spirit, the son of a well-respected and revered industrialist back in Marseille; Cyril has been ordained the task of establishing the colony by the Emperor a real chance to make his own name in the Empire. Cyril was, perhaps, a little ostentatious and arrogant in conversation but was a much more approachable character when compared to the indomitable Captain. Cyril turned to the bustling main cabin and announced Less than twenty-four hours colonists and our new lives commence!",
        "story_a": "The *Vent lger* groaned and creaked as it cut through the swirling mists of the Atlantic, its wooden hull a patchwork of repairs and reinforcements, a testament to countless voyages and the relentless passage of time. The airship, a grand relic of a bygone era, carried within its belly a disparate group of souls, each with their own dreams, fears, and secrets. The hum of the propellers was a constant reminder of the fragile thread that bound them to their destination, the uncharted island where they were to establish a new French colony.\n\nThe main deck was a bustling microcosm of the old world, a place where the hopes of the hopeful colonists intertwined with the wary glances of the ex-convicts who had been granted a second chance. The air was thick with the mingling scents of sweat, sea brine, and the faint, sweet aroma of the exotic spices that had been stowed away in the cargo hold. The sky above was a tumultuous canvas of grey and white, the sun a distant, hazy orb that offered little warmth.\n\nJean-Baptiste Leclerc, the ship's captain, stood at the helm, his weathered face etched with lines of determination and caution. His eyes, a piercing blue, scanned the horizon as if searching for any sign of the land that had eluded them for so long. His hand rested on the worn wooden wheel, fingers tapping out a rhythm that spoke of both impatience and resolve. He was a man of few words, but his presence commanded respect\u2014a necessary trait for maintaining order among such a volatile mix of passengers.\n\nAmong the colonists, Lucille Dubois stood out like a beacon of hope. Her auburn hair, tied back in a practical braid, framed a face that was both kind and resolute. She moved with a quiet grace, her hands busy with tasks that kept the community functioning\u2014mending clothes, tending to the small herb garden that she had insisted on bringing aboard, and offering a comforting word to those who needed it. Her eyes, a deep green, held a spark of determination that had inspired many of her fellow travelers to believe in the possibility of a new beginning.\n\nIn stark contrast, Pierre Lafitte, a former smuggler turned reluctant colonist, lurked in the shadows, his sharp eyes always watching, always calculating. His dark hair and beard gave him a rugged appearance, and the scar that traced a line from his temple to his jaw was a silent testament to a past filled with danger and deceit. He had been given a choice: rot in a French prison or join the expedition. He had chosen the latter, but his motivations were far from pure.\n\nAs the journey wore on, tensions simmered just below the surface. The close quarters and the uncertainty of their mission had begun to take their toll. Whispers of sabotage and hidden motives spread like wildfire, each rumor a spark that threatened to ignite the volatile mix of personalities. The ex-convicts were the first to be suspected, their pasts making them easy targets for mistrust. But as the days passed, it became clear that the seeds of discord had been sown more deeply than anyone had anticipated.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the sky in shades of crimson and gold, a sense of unease settled over the *Vent lger*. The passengers gathered in small groups, speaking in hushed tones, their eyes darting nervously about. Lucille, sensing the growing unrest, sought out Captain Leclerc. She found him on the aft deck, his silhouette a dark outline against the fading light.\n\n\"Captain,\" she began, her voice steady despite the anxiety that gnawed at her. \"The people are afraid. They speak of sabotage, of hidden agendas. We must do something to quell their fears.\"\n\nLeclerc turned to her, his expression unreadable. \"I am aware, Mademoiselle Dubois. But we must tread carefully. If there is a saboteur among us, we cannot afford to tip our hand too soon.\"\n\nLucille nodded, her mind racing. \"What do you suggest?\"\n\nBefore Leclerc could respond, a shout rang out from below decks. The sound of hurried footsteps followed, and soon a crowd had gathered around the entrance to the cargo hold. Lucille and Leclerc exchanged a glance and hurried to join the throng.\n\nIn the dim light of the hold, they found Pierre Lafitte standing over an open crate, its contents spilling onto the floor. The smell of gunpowder was unmistakable. \"What is the meaning of this?\" Leclerc demanded, his voice a low growl.\n\nPierre looked up, his expression one of feigned innocence. \"I was merely inspecting the cargo, Captain. It seems we have more than just spices and supplies aboard.\"\n\nThe murmurs of the crowd grew louder, fear and suspicion evident in their eyes. Lucille stepped forward, her voice clear and commanding. \"We must remain calm. This is precisely what the saboteur wants\u2014to sow discord among us. We must stand together if we are to succeed.\"\n\nLeclerc nodded in agreement. \"Search the ship. We will find whoever is responsible for this treachery. And when we do, they will answer for their actions.\"\n\nAs the passengers dispersed, the air was thick with tension and unspoken questions. Who among them could be trusted? What other dangers lay hidden within the aging airship? And would they ever reach their destination, or would their mission be doomed before it even began?\n\nThe *Vent lger* continued its journey, a fragile vessel carrying the hopes and fears of its passengers toward an uncertain future.",
        "story_b": "The hull of the *Vent L\u00e9ger* groaned as the aging airship cut through the azure sky, its timbers echoing with each persistent gust of wind. Inside, the passengers jostled in the cramped quarters, a motley assembly of hopeful colonists and wary ex-convicts, each with their own dreams and demons. The air was thick with the smell of oil and sea, mingling with the faint scent of anticipation and unspoken fears.\n\nCaptain Duval, a stern yet fair leader, stood at the helm, his eyes scanning the horizon. His thoughts were as turbulent as the winds outside; he was entrusted with the monumental task of steering this ragtag group to an uncharted island, a mission shrouded in secrecy and the weight of France\u2019s imperial ambitions. The stakes were high, and the airship\u2019s creaking frame seemed to mirror the fragile hope of those aboard.\n\nAs the passengers settled into the long voyage, whispers began to snake through the narrow corridors, carrying rumors of sabotage. In the dimly lit hold, where shadows clung to the corners, suspicious glances were exchanged between the colonists and the ex-convicts, their histories as varied as the colors of the sunset beyond the portholes.\n\nPierre, a gaunt man with eyes as sharp as a hawk\u2019s, leaned against the railing, watching the interactions unfold. A former thief pardoned for this venture, his every instinct screamed of hidden motives and half-truths. He overheard a hushed conversation between two colonists, their voices tinged with anxiety.\n\n\u201cThey say someone\u2019s tampered with the engines,\u201d murmured one, casting a furtive glance over his shoulder.\n\n\u201cWho would do such a thing?\u201d the other replied, his voice barely above a whisper. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d\n\nPierre\u2019s lips curled into a knowing smile. \u201cTogether\u201d was a fragile word, easily shattered by the weight of past grievances and the promise of a new beginning. The ex-convicts, hardened by their crimes, were no strangers to betrayal, nor were they na\u00efve to the prejudices that clung to them like barnacles.\n\nMeanwhile, Captain Duval\u2019s thoughts turned inward, grappling with the enormity of the mission. He was a man driven by duty, yet the murmurs of discontent unsettled him. Could he trust the crew he commanded, or were there saboteurs among them, eager to see the mission fail?\n\nAs night descended, the airship\u2019s engines hummed a steady lullaby, and the passengers retreated into their thoughts. The air grew colder, and the stars above seemed distant, indifferent to the struggles below. In the dim glow of a lantern, Marie, a young woman with a fiery spirit, scribbled in her journal, her pen scratching against the paper. Her heart was torn between the excitement of a new life and the fear of the unknown.\n\nHer eyes drifted to Jean, a fellow colonist with a brooding demeanor. He sat alone, his gaze fixed on the horizon, as if trying to glimpse the island that promised salvation. Marie wondered about the secrets he carried, about the shadows that danced in his eyes.\n\nThe airship lurched suddenly, and a collective gasp rippled through the passengers. The engines faltered, sputtering like a dying flame. Panic spread like wildfire, igniting old tensions and new fears. Captain Duval barked orders, his voice a beacon of authority amidst the chaos.\n\n\u201cStay calm!\u201d he commanded, his tone brooking no argument. \u201cWe will find the cause.\u201d\n\nIn the ensuing silence, Pierre moved with stealthy purpose, his instincts guiding him toward the engine room. The air was heavy with the acrid smell of smoke, and his heart quickened as he neared the source of the disturbance. He could hear the frantic clinking of metal, the unmistakable sound of sabotage.\n\nHe found Jacques, a fellow ex-convict, hunched over the machinery, his hands working with desperate precision. Their eyes met, and for a moment, time seemed to freeze. Jacques\u2019 face was a mask of guilt and defiance, a man caught between redemption and ruin.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Pierre asked, his voice low and laden with disbelief.\n\nJacques\u2019 shoulders slumped, the weight of his actions pulling him down. \u201cI couldn\u2019t trust them,\u201d he confessed, his voice barely audible. \u201cThey\u2019d never let us start anew.\u201d\n\nPierre understood the fear that drove Jacques, the fear of being forever bound by the chains of the past. But he also saw the glimmer of hope, the chance for change that lay just beyond the horizon.\n\nTogether, they worked to repair the damage, their hands moving in tandem, driven by a shared resolve. The engines roared back to life, the airship steadying as it continued its journey. As dawn broke, the island appeared, a lush promise rising from the sea.\n\nCaptain Duval stood at the helm, a silent acknowledgment passing between him and his passengers. They had survived the turbulence, both within and without, and now the future beckoned, a blank slate upon which to etch their destinies.\n\nThe *Vent L\u00e9ger* sailed on, its timbers groaning in harmony with the hopes of those it carried, toward a new beginning on the uncharted shores.",

        "ground_truth": "We were in Jimmy\u2019s backyard playing Wiffle ball when the news broke that the shortstop had been traded.\n\nTraded? Jimmy said, turning to me. Him?\n\nWe ran up the little hill and slid open the screen door. On TV old clips played of the shortstop doing his trademark prepitch routine\u2014an odd, twitchy ritual we knew by heart. We watched him go through the well-known steps: batting gloves first, fingers waggling, then the tugged wristband, the tapped chest, hip, back pocket, belt, palm to the shining blue helmet, bat rapped gently on his left shoulder, then the toe taps, one foot and then the other, four taps in all, one, two, three, four.\n\nA four-team deal, they were saying on the TV. Two players coming back, both journeymen, their names faintly known. A first baseman and\u2014a shortstop.\n\nA shortstop, Jimmy said.\n\nI looked at the news anchor, watched his mouth shape the impossible words again and again: the shortstop, gone, and in return a shortstop who was not our shortstop, the only shortstop we\u2019d ever known.\n\nAfter a while Jimmy said: You know what? Good riddance. You heard them\u2014he\u2019s a clubhouse cancer. He wanted out. We can win without him. We don\u2019t need him anymore.\n\nI searched his face, looking for the joke, but his expression was hard and sealed off, closed to questioning. Studying him, all at once I understood that for us there would be no mourning the shortstop, no grief for a figure who, it must be said, had meant nearly everything to us for a very long time.\n\nHe was simply gone, and just as quickly the decree had come down: at fourteen, we were too grown up to care.\n\n\nYears later, during a winter break from college, Jimmy and I met for a long weekend at Disney World. Though too old for amusement parks, we\u2019d come anyway in an unspoken attempt to recover some of the easy childhood camaraderie that for so long had sustained us, to sew together bits of a friendship that, since we were far from home and surrounded by new friends with new interests and new jokes, had become badly frayed.\n\nThe first morning at the park, we were crossing Main Street when we noticed a group of girls clustered in front of a stage, watching a man and woman give a soccer demonstration. The woman was familiar to us: we\u2019d seen her many times on TV and on magazine covers. For a while we watched her kick and talk, kick and talk, her voice booming through the microphone clipped to her windbreaker. Most of her shots found their target, slipping past the outstretched arms of the goalie, who wore a golf shirt and a blue cap pulled low over his brow. Only when the demonstration ended and he lifted the cap did we realize it was the shortstop.\n\nWe stared as he stepped to the front of the stage. The gleaming black hair had gone slightly gray, and the gold chain we\u2019d marveled at in the famous shirtless cover photo was now dull and mostly hidden beneath his collar. Even his legs looked thin and unextraordinary where they disappeared into a pair of dorky running sneakers.\n\nHe gave a little wave and grinned\u2014that fabled grin!\u2014and then disappeared back into the shade behind his wife, who bent to sign autographs for the squealing girls. Watching him there, stooped in shadow, hands clasped at his back, it was hard to believe he was the same man who\u2019d nearly batted .400, who\u2019d once hit two grand slams in a single game.\n\nThat night Jimmy and I sat in our cramped motel room with a case of beer, sitting on adjacent beds drinking and watching a spring training game on the room\u2019s boxy TV. There\u2019d been some girls out by the pool, but they hadn\u2019t wanted to come back for a party, so we decided to just drink the beer ourselves.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much to say, I guess. But it was hard not to think about the shortstop, at least for me. I wished we hadn\u2019t seen him like that, gray-haired and paunchy, scrambling after loose balls in front of a bunch of kids who didn\u2019t even know who he was.\n\nAfter a while, feeling thoroughly buzzed, I stood and made my way unsteadily to the center of the room. From his spot on the bed Jimmy frowned up at me, cans gripped in both his hands.\n\nWhat are you doing? he said sharply. Seriously? Stop it.\n\nBut I\u2019d already begun. As he glared at me I reached down and from the stiff soiled rug brought up an invisible bat, laying it across my right shoulder, surprised at how natural it felt, how familiar, as if we\u2019d never left Jimmy\u2019s backyard. The old ritual came back easily, ingrained as an overhand toss: the tugged batting gloves, the wristband straightened along one arm. The touches\u2014forearm, hip, pocket, left shoulder, helmet, belt. Something consecrated about them, some bit of the sacrament in the solemn recurrent steps. And finally the toe taps, my bare feet digging into the tight weave of the rug: one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. Again. Again. Jimmy staring now, now smiling a little, now laughing in spite of himself, little snorts that burst from him like static from an ancient PA system as he rose suddenly and took a spot atop an invisible mound, bending into his windup, peering behind me for the pretend sign, squinting, shaking his head no, no, then nodding and rising into the set and beginning then to deliver the bright imagined ball into the space between us as on a diamond after the game, fans departed in a string of cars moving off into the night, their receding lights a fading memory, a necklace of winking gold.\n",
        "story_a": "The old ball field was smaller than they remembered. The chain-link fence sagged with age, and the once meticulous infield was now a patchwork of dirt and scraggly grass. The bleachers, where they had spent countless summer afternoons, were rusted and weather-beaten. Yet, standing here now, Tom and Eddie could almost hear the echoes of their past\u2014cheers, laughter, the crack of a bat meeting a ball.\n\nTom kicked at the dirt, sending up a small cloud of dust. \u201cCrazy how things change, huh?\u201d\n\nEddie nodded, his gaze fixed on the empty diamond. \u201cYeah. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been, what, twenty years?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwenty-three,\u201d Tom corrected, with a small smile. \u201cTwenty-three years since we saw Jackson play his last game here.\u201d\n\nJackson, the shortstop, their childhood hero. He was the reason they came to this field every day after school, the reason they practiced until the streetlights flickered on. Jackson had been traded to a big-league team in another city, and with his departure, something intangible had shifted for both of them.\n\nTom glanced at Eddie, who seemed lost in thought. The years had etched lines into Eddie\u2019s face, turning his boyish features into something sterner, more reflective. Tom wondered if his own face had changed as much. They had lost touch after high school, their lives diverging into different paths\u2014Tom into a corporate job that took him across the country, Eddie into the family business right here in their hometown.\n\n\u201cSo, how\u2019s life been treating you?\u201d Tom asked, breaking the silence.\n\nEddie shrugged. \u201cYou know, same old. Running the shop, taking care of Mom. She\u2019s not as spry as she used to be.\u201d\n\nTom nodded. \u201cI heard about your dad. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d Eddie\u2019s voice was gruff, but there was a softness in his eyes. \u201cWhat about you? Still chasing those big deals?\u201d\n\nTom chuckled. \u201cYeah, still chasing something. Lately, though, I\u2019ve been thinking about slowing down. Maybe coming back here, finding something more grounded.\u201d\n\nEddie raised an eyebrow. \u201cBack here? Really?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. I miss it,\u201d Tom admitted. \u201cMiss the simplicity, the community. Miss...well, this.\u201d He gestured to the field.\n\nEddie picked up a stray baseball that had been lying near the fence. He tossed it up and down, feeling its weight. \u201cRemember the time we tried to sneak into the dugout to meet Jackson?\u201d\n\nTom laughed, a genuine, hearty laugh that seemed to lift years off his shoulders. \u201cYeah, and we got caught by Coach Stevens. Man, he was furious.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Jackson was cool about it,\u201d Eddie said, a smile spreading across his face. \u201cHe gave us each a signed ball and told us to keep practicing. Said we had potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, he did,\u201d Tom said softly. \u201cI wonder what he\u2019d think if he saw us now.\u201d\n\nEddie\u2019s smile faded slightly. \u201cI think he\u2019d be proud. We\u2019ve both done okay, in our own ways.\u201d\n\nTom looked around the field, memories flooding back. \u201cWant to play a little catch? For old times\u2019 sake?\u201d\n\nEddie\u2019s face lit up. \u201cSure, why not?\u201d\n\nThey moved to opposite ends of the infield, the distance feeling both familiar and strange. Eddie wound up and threw the ball, and Tom caught it with ease. The rhythm of their throws, back and forth, was soothing, a dance they had perfected in their youth.\n\nAs they played, the sun dipped lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the field. The air was cool, carrying the scent of fresh-cut grass and distant barbecue smoke. Tom felt a sense of peace he hadn\u2019t known in years.\n\n\u201cDo you ever think about what could have been?\u201d Eddie asked, breaking the silence.\n\nTom caught the ball and paused, considering his words. \u201cSometimes. But mostly, I think about what is. We\u2019ve got our memories, and we\u2019ve got now. That\u2019s enough for me.\u201d\n\nEddie nodded, a thoughtful expression on his face. \u201cYeah. I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\nThey continued to play catch, their movements fluid and natural. It was as if no time had passed at all, as if they were still those boys dreaming of greatness.\n\nAfter a while, they sat down on the bleachers, the metal creaking under their weight. They watched the sky turn from orange to deep purple, the first stars beginning to twinkle.\n\n\u201cRemember the rituals we had before each game?\u201d Eddie asked, a nostalgic smile on his lips.\n\nTom grinned. \u201cHow could I forget? Tying our shoelaces the same way, tapping the bat on the ground three times, the secret handshake. We believed it all made a difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe it did,\u201d Eddie said quietly. \u201cMaybe it still does.\u201d\n\nTom looked at his friend, seeing not just the man he had become, but the boy he had been\u2014the boy who had shared his dreams, his fears, his hopes. \u201cThanks for coming out here today, Eddie. It means a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnytime, Tom,\u201d Eddie replied. \u201cLet\u2019s not wait another twenty-three years next time.\u201d\n\nTom smiled, feeling a warmth in his chest. \u201cDeal.\u201d\n\nAs they sat there, the night settling around them, they were no longer just two old friends reminiscing about the past. They were two men, grounded in the present, finding solace in the rituals of their youth and the enduring power of friendship.",
        "story_b": "The sun had just begun to dip beneath the horizon when Alex found himself standing at the foot of the old wooden porch, the familiar creak of the steps underfoot echoing like whispers of a bygone era. He hesitated before knocking, his hand hovering over the door's peeling paint. It had been years since he last stood here, a lanky teenager with a baseball cap tilted backwards, ready for another summer evening of dreams and dirt.\n\nHe took a breath and knocked, the sound resonating through the stillness of the twilight. Memories rushed back\u2014a childhood spent in the small town of Elmsford, where the world was no bigger than the baseball diamond at the edge of town. The door swung open, and there stood Jamie, his childhood friend, now with a few more lines on his face but the same bright spark in his eyes.\n\n\u201cAlex!\u201d Jamie exclaimed, pulling him into a warm embrace that spoke volumes of missed years and unspoken words. They stood there for a moment, the awkwardness melting away into familiarity.\n\n\u201cHey, Jamie,\u201d Alex replied, stepping back. His gaze drifted past Jamie, into the house that held echoes of their laughter and the soft thud of baseballs caught in well-worn gloves.\n\nThey settled into the cozy living room, where the smell of old books and the faint aroma of coffee lingered. Jamie had always been the more pragmatic one, the planner, while Alex was the dreamer, chasing sunsets and home runs.\n\n\u201cRemember those summers?\u201d Jamie asked, handing Alex a mug. \u201cIt was all about baseball and nothing else.\u201d\n\nAlex nodded, his mind drifting back to those endless days. \u201cAnd our hero, the shortstop,\u201d he said, a wistful note in his voice. \u201cWe all wanted to be like him.\u201d\n\nJamie grinned. \u201cUntil he got traded. Remember how crushed we were?\u201d\n\nThe memory was a sharp pang in Alex\u2019s chest. Their childhood hero, the shortstop, traded away in the prime of his career. It had been their first real taste of loss, a lesson that sometimes, the heroes you idolize can disappear just when you need them most.\n\nAs the evening wore on, the conversation ebbed and flowed like a tide, bringing with it stories and laughter. Then Jamie stood up suddenly. \u201cCome with me,\u201d he said, a mischievous glint in his eye.\n\nThey climbed the narrow stairs to the attic, a place they hadn\u2019t ventured together in years. Dust motes danced in the dim light filtering through a small window. Jamie rummaged through boxes until he pulled out a battered old baseball glove.\n\n\u201cLook at this,\u201d he said, tossing it to Alex.\n\nThe glove was worn and cracked, its leather softened by years of use. As Alex slipped it on, a flood of memories surged through him\u2014the feel of the ball smacking into the glove, the cheers of the crowd, the exhilaration of a perfect catch.\n\nAnd then something fell from the glove\u2019s pocket\u2014a yellowed envelope, folded and creased. They exchanged a curious glance before Alex carefully unfolded it. Inside was a letter, its ink faded but legible.\n\n\u201cDear Alex and Jamie,\u201d it began, and their hearts skipped a beat. It was from their childhood hero, the shortstop himself. The letter revealed a secret\u2014he hadn\u2019t wanted to be traded. Instead, he\u2019d been forced out by team politics and machinations, a pawn in a game beyond his control. He\u2019d written to them, two kids who idolized him, to share his gratitude for their unwavering support.\n\nReading the letter was like opening a time capsule, the years peeling away to reveal the raw emotions of their youth. It was a twist neither had expected, adding layers to their understanding of the past. Their hero had been human, fallible, and yet, his legacy had shaped their dreams.\n\nWith the letter in hand, they made their way to the old baseball field, now overgrown with weeds and time. The bases were worn, the diamond dusty, yet the echoes of their boyhood games lingered in the cool evening air. The sun cast long shadows over the field, painting it in hues of amber and gold.\n\nThey stood at home plate, the weight of the years between them and those summers suddenly lighter. \u201cWe lost him, but we didn\u2019t lose what he gave us,\u201d Jamie said, his voice steady.\n\nAlex nodded, the glove still in his hand. \u201cYeah, he taught us to dream.\u201d\n\nFor a while, they tossed a ball back and forth, the familiar rhythm of catch bringing a sense of peace. The ball arced between them, a tangible connection to the past and a testament to enduring friendship.\n\nAs the sun slipped below the horizon, casting the field in shadow, they knew that while much had changed, much also remained. The world had grown larger, their dreams had shifted, but the essence of those summers\u2014of friendship and baseball\u2014was still alive in their hearts.\n\nThey walked back home together, the letter tucked safely in Alex\u2019s pocket. It was a reminder that even heroes have their struggles, and that sometimes, what truly matters is not what is lost, but what remains. And as they laughed under the starlit sky, they knew they\u2019d carry those memories with them always, a legacy of youth that time could never trade away.",

        "ground_truth": "We were in Jimmy\u2019s backyard playing Wiffle ball when the news broke that the shortstop had been traded.\n\nTraded? Jimmy said, turning to me. Him?\n\nWe ran up the little hill and slid open the screen door. On TV old clips played of the shortstop doing his trademark prepitch routine\u2014an odd, twitchy ritual we knew by heart. We watched him go through the well-known steps: batting gloves first, fingers waggling, then the tugged wristband, the tapped chest, hip, back pocket, belt, palm to the shining blue helmet, bat rapped gently on his left shoulder, then the toe taps, one foot and then the other, four taps in all, one, two, three, four.\n\nA four-team deal, they were saying on the TV. Two players coming back, both journeymen, their names faintly known. A first baseman and\u2014a shortstop.\n\nA shortstop, Jimmy said.\n\nI looked at the news anchor, watched his mouth shape the impossible words again and again: the shortstop, gone, and in return a shortstop who was not our shortstop, the only shortstop we\u2019d ever known.\n\nAfter a while Jimmy said: You know what? Good riddance. You heard them\u2014he\u2019s a clubhouse cancer. He wanted out. We can win without him. We don\u2019t need him anymore.\n\nI searched his face, looking for the joke, but his expression was hard and sealed off, closed to questioning. Studying him, all at once I understood that for us there would be no mourning the shortstop, no grief for a figure who, it must be said, had meant nearly everything to us for a very long time.\n\nHe was simply gone, and just as quickly the decree had come down: at fourteen, we were too grown up to care.\n\n\nYears later, during a winter break from college, Jimmy and I met for a long weekend at Disney World. Though too old for amusement parks, we\u2019d come anyway in an unspoken attempt to recover some of the easy childhood camaraderie that for so long had sustained us, to sew together bits of a friendship that, since we were far from home and surrounded by new friends with new interests and new jokes, had become badly frayed.\n\nThe first morning at the park, we were crossing Main Street when we noticed a group of girls clustered in front of a stage, watching a man and woman give a soccer demonstration. The woman was familiar to us: we\u2019d seen her many times on TV and on magazine covers. For a while we watched her kick and talk, kick and talk, her voice booming through the microphone clipped to her windbreaker. Most of her shots found their target, slipping past the outstretched arms of the goalie, who wore a golf shirt and a blue cap pulled low over his brow. Only when the demonstration ended and he lifted the cap did we realize it was the shortstop.\n\nWe stared as he stepped to the front of the stage. The gleaming black hair had gone slightly gray, and the gold chain we\u2019d marveled at in the famous shirtless cover photo was now dull and mostly hidden beneath his collar. Even his legs looked thin and unextraordinary where they disappeared into a pair of dorky running sneakers.\n\nHe gave a little wave and grinned\u2014that fabled grin!\u2014and then disappeared back into the shade behind his wife, who bent to sign autographs for the squealing girls. Watching him there, stooped in shadow, hands clasped at his back, it was hard to believe he was the same man who\u2019d nearly batted .400, who\u2019d once hit two grand slams in a single game.\n\nThat night Jimmy and I sat in our cramped motel room with a case of beer, sitting on adjacent beds drinking and watching a spring training game on the room\u2019s boxy TV. There\u2019d been some girls out by the pool, but they hadn\u2019t wanted to come back for a party, so we decided to just drink the beer ourselves.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much to say, I guess. But it was hard not to think about the shortstop, at least for me. I wished we hadn\u2019t seen him like that, gray-haired and paunchy, scrambling after loose balls in front of a bunch of kids who didn\u2019t even know who he was.\n\nAfter a while, feeling thoroughly buzzed, I stood and made my way unsteadily to the center of the room. From his spot on the bed Jimmy frowned up at me, cans gripped in both his hands.\n\nWhat are you doing? he said sharply. Seriously? Stop it.\n\nBut I\u2019d already begun. As he glared at me I reached down and from the stiff soiled rug brought up an invisible bat, laying it across my right shoulder, surprised at how natural it felt, how familiar, as if we\u2019d never left Jimmy\u2019s backyard. The old ritual came back easily, ingrained as an overhand toss: the tugged batting gloves, the wristband straightened along one arm. The touches\u2014forearm, hip, pocket, left shoulder, helmet, belt. Something consecrated about them, some bit of the sacrament in the solemn recurrent steps. And finally the toe taps, my bare feet digging into the tight weave of the rug: one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. Again. Again. Jimmy staring now, now smiling a little, now laughing in spite of himself, little snorts that burst from him like static from an ancient PA system as he rose suddenly and took a spot atop an invisible mound, bending into his windup, peering behind me for the pretend sign, squinting, shaking his head no, no, then nodding and rising into the set and beginning then to deliver the bright imagined ball into the space between us as on a diamond after the game, fans departed in a string of cars moving off into the night, their receding lights a fading memory, a necklace of winking gold.\n",
        "story_a": "The old ball field was smaller than they remembered. The chain-link fence sagged with age, and the once meticulous infield was now a patchwork of dirt and scraggly grass. The bleachers, where they had spent countless summer afternoons, were rusted and weather-beaten. Yet, standing here now, Tom and Eddie could almost hear the echoes of their past\u2014cheers, laughter, the crack of a bat meeting a ball.\n\nTom kicked at the dirt, sending up a small cloud of dust. \u201cCrazy how things change, huh?\u201d\n\nEddie nodded, his gaze fixed on the empty diamond. \u201cYeah. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been, what, twenty years?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwenty-three,\u201d Tom corrected, with a small smile. \u201cTwenty-three years since we saw Jackson play his last game here.\u201d\n\nJackson, the shortstop, their childhood hero. He was the reason they came to this field every day after school, the reason they practiced until the streetlights flickered on. Jackson had been traded to a big-league team in another city, and with his departure, something intangible had shifted for both of them.\n\nTom glanced at Eddie, who seemed lost in thought. The years had etched lines into Eddie\u2019s face, turning his boyish features into something sterner, more reflective. Tom wondered if his own face had changed as much. They had lost touch after high school, their lives diverging into different paths\u2014Tom into a corporate job that took him across the country, Eddie into the family business right here in their hometown.\n\n\u201cSo, how\u2019s life been treating you?\u201d Tom asked, breaking the silence.\n\nEddie shrugged. \u201cYou know, same old. Running the shop, taking care of Mom. She\u2019s not as spry as she used to be.\u201d\n\nTom nodded. \u201cI heard about your dad. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d Eddie\u2019s voice was gruff, but there was a softness in his eyes. \u201cWhat about you? Still chasing those big deals?\u201d\n\nTom chuckled. \u201cYeah, still chasing something. Lately, though, I\u2019ve been thinking about slowing down. Maybe coming back here, finding something more grounded.\u201d\n\nEddie raised an eyebrow. \u201cBack here? Really?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. I miss it,\u201d Tom admitted. \u201cMiss the simplicity, the community. Miss...well, this.\u201d He gestured to the field.\n\nEddie picked up a stray baseball that had been lying near the fence. He tossed it up and down, feeling its weight. \u201cRemember the time we tried to sneak into the dugout to meet Jackson?\u201d\n\nTom laughed, a genuine, hearty laugh that seemed to lift years off his shoulders. \u201cYeah, and we got caught by Coach Stevens. Man, he was furious.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Jackson was cool about it,\u201d Eddie said, a smile spreading across his face. \u201cHe gave us each a signed ball and told us to keep practicing. Said we had potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, he did,\u201d Tom said softly. \u201cI wonder what he\u2019d think if he saw us now.\u201d\n\nEddie\u2019s smile faded slightly. \u201cI think he\u2019d be proud. We\u2019ve both done okay, in our own ways.\u201d\n\nTom looked around the field, memories flooding back. \u201cWant to play a little catch? For old times\u2019 sake?\u201d\n\nEddie\u2019s face lit up. \u201cSure, why not?\u201d\n\nThey moved to opposite ends of the infield, the distance feeling both familiar and strange. Eddie wound up and threw the ball, and Tom caught it with ease. The rhythm of their throws, back and forth, was soothing, a dance they had perfected in their youth.\n\nAs they played, the sun dipped lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the field. The air was cool, carrying the scent of fresh-cut grass and distant barbecue smoke. Tom felt a sense of peace he hadn\u2019t known in years.\n\n\u201cDo you ever think about what could have been?\u201d Eddie asked, breaking the silence.\n\nTom caught the ball and paused, considering his words. \u201cSometimes. But mostly, I think about what is. We\u2019ve got our memories, and we\u2019ve got now. That\u2019s enough for me.\u201d\n\nEddie nodded, a thoughtful expression on his face. \u201cYeah. I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\nThey continued to play catch, their movements fluid and natural. It was as if no time had passed at all, as if they were still those boys dreaming of greatness.\n\nAfter a while, they sat down on the bleachers, the metal creaking under their weight. They watched the sky turn from orange to deep purple, the first stars beginning to twinkle.\n\n\u201cRemember the rituals we had before each game?\u201d Eddie asked, a nostalgic smile on his lips.\n\nTom grinned. \u201cHow could I forget? Tying our shoelaces the same way, tapping the bat on the ground three times, the secret handshake. We believed it all made a difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe it did,\u201d Eddie said quietly. \u201cMaybe it still does.\u201d\n\nTom looked at his friend, seeing not just the man he had become, but the boy he had been\u2014the boy who had shared his dreams, his fears, his hopes. \u201cThanks for coming out here today, Eddie. It means a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnytime, Tom,\u201d Eddie replied. \u201cLet\u2019s not wait another twenty-three years next time.\u201d\n\nTom smiled, feeling a warmth in his chest. \u201cDeal.\u201d\n\nAs they sat there, the night settling around them, they were no longer just two old friends reminiscing about the past. They were two men, grounded in the present, finding solace in the rituals of their youth and the enduring power of friendship.",
        "story_b": "The baseball field lay bathed in the golden haze of late afternoon, its bleachers empty save for a pair of crows that cawed intermittently, their voices stark against the soft rustle of leaves. The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows over the diamond, where the bases gleamed like polished ivory. It was here, amidst the familiar scent of freshly cut grass and the distant echo of long-gone cheering crowds, that Jack and Tom stood, two silhouettes against the encroaching dusk.\n\nThe field hadn\u2019t changed much since their youth. The chain-link fence still rattled in the breeze, and the worn wooden benches whispered stories of scraped knees and stolen bases. Jack took a deep breath, letting the thick, earthy smell of leather and dust fill his lungs. He turned to Tom with a grin that seemed to belong more to the boy he once was than the man he had become. \"Remember that game when we thought we\u2019d make it to the majors?\" he asked, his voice touched with nostalgia.\n\nTom chuckled, the sound low and warm. \"You mean the game where we pretended to be our hero, Sammy James? You were always the shortstop, just like him.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Jack replied, his eyes scanning the field as if expecting to see the ghost of Sammy out there, pivoting on the infield dirt. \"I never understood why they traded him. It felt like losing a part of ourselves.\"\n\nThey fell silent, each lost in the web of memory, the air between them thick with unspoken thoughts. The loss of Sammy James from their local team had been a betrayal of sorts, an unexpected end to the summers of their childhood. His trade to a rival team had left a void, one that had resonated through the years, shaping their lives in ways they hadn\u2019t fully realized.\n\nTom kicked at the dirt with the toe of his shoe, scattering small clouds that lingered briefly before settling. \"Do you ever wonder what might have been if he\u2019d stayed?\"\n\nJack nodded, his gaze distant. \"I suppose we all have to move on eventually. But it\u2019s strange how some things stick with you, like the way he played or the way he made us believe we could be something more.\"\n\nAs the evening deepened, the two friends found themselves reliving the rituals of their youth. They tossed an imaginary ball back and forth, their movements instinctive and fluid, as if the years between had never existed. The crack of the bat seemed to echo in their minds, and the thrill of a stolen base pulsed through their veins once more.\n\nIt was during this silent, shared reverie that Tom suddenly stopped, a shadow crossing his face. \"Jack, there\u2019s something I need to tell you,\" he said, his voice tinged with an unease that belied the serenity of the setting.\n\nJack paused, the phantom ball slipping through his fingers, and turned to face his friend. \"What is it?\"\n\nTom hesitated, the words thick on his tongue. \"I was the one who wrote to the team, suggesting they trade Sammy.\"\n\nThe admission hung in the air between them, a specter of betrayal that seemed to dim the fading light. Jack's eyes widened, disbelief etched across his features. \"You did what?\"\n\n\"I was young and stupid,\" Tom said, his voice heavy with regret. \"I thought it would be better for him, a chance at something bigger. But I didn\u2019t realize what it would mean for us.\"\n\nJack turned away, his heart pounding in his chest. He looked out over the field, the memories of their shared past now tainted with this revelation. The sense of loss, once a dull ache, flared anew, sharp and raw. \"Why didn\u2019t you tell me before?\"\n\n\"I was afraid,\" Tom replied, stepping closer, his voice earnest. \"Afraid of what it would do to our friendship.\"\n\nThe quiet settled over them, broken only by the distant call of the crows and the whisper of the wind through the trees. Jack felt the weight of the years pressing down on him, a burden of regret and understanding mingled with the ghosts of their youth. Slowly, the anger ebbed, replaced by a weary acceptance. They had both lost something that day, something that had shaped them in ways they were only beginning to comprehend.\n\n\"I guess we all make mistakes,\" Jack said finally, his voice softer now, tinged with a bittersweet understanding. \"But we can\u2019t let them define us. Sammy taught us that, didn\u2019t he? To keep playing, no matter what.\"\n\nTom nodded, relief and gratitude mingling in his eyes. \"Yeah, he did.\"\n\nTogether, they turned back to the field, the last light of day casting it in a warm, forgiving glow. The shadows stretched long and thin, but the memories remained, woven into the very fabric of the place. As they stood side by side, the past and present melded into one, a testament to friendship and the enduring power of forgiveness.\n\nYears later, they would return to this field, old and gray, to watch a new generation play. And though the world had changed, the essence of those summer days lingered, a reminder of what was lost and what still remained.",

The rhythm of their throws, back and forth, was soothing, a dance they had perfected in their youth.\n\nAs they played, the sun dipped lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the field. The air was cool, carrying the scent of fresh-cut grass and distant barbecue smoke. Tom felt a sense of peace he hadn\u2019t known in years.\n\n\u201cDo you ever think about what could have been?\u201d Eddie asked, breaking the silence.\n\nTom caught the ball and paused, considering his words. \u201cSometimes. But mostly, I think about what is. We\u2019ve got our memories, and we\u2019ve got now. That\u2019s enough for me.\u201d\n\nEddie nodded, a thoughtful expression on his face. \u201cYeah. I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\nThey continued to play catch, their movements fluid and natural. It was as if no time had passed at all, as if they were still those boys dreaming of greatness.\n\nAfter a while, they sat down on the bleachers, the metal creaking under their weight. They watched the sky turn from orange to deep purple, the first stars beginning to twinkle.\n\n\u201cRemember the rituals we had before each game?\u201d Eddie asked, a nostalgic smile on his lips.\n\nTom grinned. \u201cHow could I forget? Tying our shoelaces the same way, tapping the bat on the ground three times, the secret handshake. We believed it all made a difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe it did,\u201d Eddie said quietly. \u201cMaybe it still does.\u201d\n\nTom looked at his friend, seeing not just the man he had become, but the boy he had been\u2014the boy who had shared his dreams, his fears, his hopes. \u201cThanks for coming out here today, Eddie. It means a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnytime, Tom,\u201d Eddie replied. \u201cLet\u2019s not wait another twenty-three years next time.\u201d\n\nTom smiled, feeling a warmth in his chest. \u201cDeal.\u201d\n\nAs they sat there, the night settling around them, they were no longer just two old friends reminiscing about the past. They were two men, grounded in the present, finding solace in the rituals of their youth and the enduring power of friendship.",
        "story_b": "The afternoon light slanted low across the old neighborhood baseball field, casting long shadows over the overgrown grass. Rusted bleachers loomed at one end, their paint chipped and peeling, whispering tales of games long since played. As Ethan stepped onto the field, he could almost hear the echoes of laughter, the crack of bat meeting ball, and the cheers that had once filled the air.\n\n\"Hey, you made it,\" a voice called from behind him. Ethan turned to see Jake, his childhood friend, approaching with a familiar swagger. Despite the years, Jake's grin was the same, wide and infectious. He carried two mitts and a baseball, symbols of a shared past that had brought them together once more.\n\n\"Wouldn't miss it,\" Ethan replied, taking in the sight of his old friend. They embraced briefly, the kind of hug that spoke of years of familiarity and unspoken understanding.\n\nJake tossed him one of the mitts, worn and frayed at the edges. \"Remember this?\" he asked, raising an eyebrow.\n\nEthan slipped it on, flexing his fingers within the soft, well-worn leather. \"How could I forget? We must've spent half our childhood right here.\"\n\nTogether, they walked to the center of the field. The grass brushed against their shins, and the air was thick with the scent of earth and nostalgia. It felt as if time had circled back on itself, pulling them into a simpler era.\n\n\"Shame about the old shortstop,\" Jake said, his voice carrying a hint of wistfulness. \"When they traded him, it felt like the end of everything.\"\n\nEthan nodded, the memory of their hero's abrupt departure still a tender spot. \"Yeah, it was like losing a part of our dreams. We thought he was invincible.\"\n\nThey began to toss the ball back and forth, the motions easy and rhythmic, like riding a bicycle after years away. With each throw, they shared memories of childhood games, of daring dreams to one day play professionally, fueled by the feats of their idol.\n\nJake laughed suddenly, a sound like music on the breeze. \"Remember when we tried to pull off that play he made against the Dodgers? You dove for the ball and ended up face-first in the dirt.\"\n\nEthan chuckled, shaking his head. \"You didn't do much better, trying to jump that fence afterward. I swear you still have a scar.\"\n\n\"Some things never change,\" Jake said with a shrug, a playful glint in his eyes. \"But some things do.\"\n\nTheir conversation ebbed and flowed, filled with both the warmth of their friendship and the bittersweet pangs of time passing. Ethan found himself reflecting on the paths their lives had taken. He'd become a successful businessman, the dream of playing baseball professionally left behind but never forgotten. Jake, on the other hand, had turned to teaching, finding fulfillment in mentoring young athletes.\n\n\"You know,\" Ethan said, catching the ball and holding it for a moment, \"seeing these kids you coach, it makes me think our dreams didn't really die. They just changed forms.\"\n\nJake nodded, thoughtful. \"I suppose they did. Watching those kids grow, it's like keeping the spirit of those dreams alive, even if in a different way.\"\n\nThe sun dipped lower, casting a golden hue across the field. They paused to take in the sight, the beauty of the moment mingling with the memories it evoked.\n\n\"Funny how this place hasn't changed much,\" Ethan remarked, gesturing to the field around them. \"It's like it's frozen in time, even if we're not.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Jake said, his gaze sweeping over the familiar landscape. \"It's comforting, in a way. Like the field holds the whispers of our youthful dreams.\"\n\nSilence settled between them, comfortable and reflective. In that quiet, Ethan considered how their hero's trade, once a source of heartbreak, had ultimately shaped them. It had marked the end of one era but had also propelled them toward new beginnings.\n\n\"You ever wonder what he's doing now?\" Jake asked suddenly, breaking the silence.\n\nEthan shrugged. \"Sometimes. But I think what matters is what he left us with. The inspiration, the memories\u2014those are things that stay.\"\n\nAs if on cue, a gentle breeze rustled the grass, carrying with it the sound of distant laughter and the distant crack of an imaginary bat. The friends smiled at each other, feeling the weight of the past lift, leaving only the lightness of shared history.\n\nWith a playful glint in his eyes, Jake tossed the ball high into the air. \"Let's see if you can still catch like you used to.\"\n\nEthan tracked the ball against the sky, his movements instinctive. As he caught it cleanly, laughter bubbled up between them, bright and unrestrained.\n\n\"Not bad for an old man,\" Jake teased, jogging over to clap Ethan on the back.\n\n\"Speak for yourself,\" Ethan retorted, a grin stretching wide across his face.\n\nThey continued their game of catch, the ball arcing back and forth, a tangible link to their past. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the field in a warm twilight glow, they lingered, reluctant to leave the place that had been a cradle for their dreams.\n\nFinally, as the chill of evening settled in, they headed toward the edge of the field, mitts slung over their shoulders. The world around them was quiet, save for the rustle of leaves and the soft rhythm of their footsteps.\n\n\"Let's not wait so long next time,\" Jake said, pausing to look back at the field one last time.\n\n\"Agreed,\" Ethan replied, feeling a profound sense of peace. \"There's always room for another game.\"\n\nWith a final shared glance, they turned away, stepping into the present with the past nestled comfortably in their hearts.",

        "story_a": "The castle loomed on the hill, an ancient sentinel carved from the bones of the earth itself. Its stone walls were weathered but unyielding, much like the man who inhabited it.

How could one man, a single solitary figure, defy an entire army?\n\n\u201cHe must have some kind of weapon,\u201d Lieutenant Graff suggested, breaking the silence that had draped over the command tent like a heavy fog.\n\n\u201cOr maybe he\u2019s a sorcerer,\u201d another soldier muttered, earning a chorus of uneasy chuckles.\n\nMarkov lowered the spyglass and turned to his men. \u201cWe\u2019ve faced worse odds before. This is no different. Today, we take that castle.\u201d\n\nAs they approached the hill, the ground beneath their feet seemed to hum with an eerie vibration, like the heartbeat of an ancient beast. The soldiers exchanged nervous glances, but their training kept them moving forward. The man in the castle, known only as the Keeper, watched from the highest tower, his eyes like ice chips glinting in the morning sun.\n\nThe first wave of soldiers reached the castle gates, their battering ram crashing against the wood with a thunderous boom. But the gates held firm. As the soldiers prepared for another strike, the air around them began to shimmer. The Keeper raised his hand, and suddenly, the ground erupted with a series of blinding flashes.\n\n\u201cFall back!\u201d Markov shouted, but it was too late. The front line of soldiers was thrown back, their bodies crumpling like rag dolls. The survivors scrambled to regroup, their faces pale with fear.\n\n\u201cWhat in the gods\u2019 names was that?\u201d Graff gasped, his eyes wide with disbelief.\n\nMarkov didn\u2019t answer. He didn\u2019t need to. The Keeper had shown his hand, and it was a powerful one. The army\u2019s resolve began to waver, doubts creeping into their minds like dark tendrils. But Markov was not a man to be easily deterred.\n\n\u201cArchers, ready your bows!\u201d he commanded.\n\nThe archers lined up, their arrows trained on the castle windows. At Markov\u2019s signal, they loosed their arrows in a deadly barrage. The sky darkened with the sheer number of projectiles, but as they neared the castle, they seemed to meet an invisible barrier. The arrows clattered to the ground harmlessly.\n\nThe Keeper stood at the window, a faint smile playing on his lips. His voice, amplified by some unseen force, echoed down to the soldiers below. \u201cYou cannot take what is not yours. Leave now, and I will spare your lives.\u201d\n\nMarkov\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cWe will not be cowed by tricks and illusions. Ready the siege engines!\u201d\n\nThe soldiers hurried to comply, wheeling massive trebuchets into position. The first boulder was loaded and fired, sailing through the air with a deafening roar. But as it neared the castle, it too was repelled by the same invisible force.\n\nThe Keeper\u2019s smile widened. \u201cYou do not understand. This castle is alive. It protects me, as I protect it. You cannot defeat it, just as you cannot defeat the will of the earth itself.\u201d\n\nMarkov\u2019s heart sank.

And the army, for all its might, had been humbled by one man and the living stone that guarded him.\n\nIn the end, it was not brute force or sheer numbers that determined victory, but the ancient, unyielding bond between the Keeper and his castle.",
        "story_b": "The ancient castle loomed atop the hill, its stone walls bathed in the eerie glow of the setting sun, as the lone figure stood resolute at the battlements. General Roderick, the leader of the besieging army, stared up at the fortress with a mixture of awe and frustration. His forces had been encamped around the hill for weeks, and yet the castle remained untaken, its solitary defender a mystery.\n\n\"General, the men are growing restless,\" Captain Elira reported, her voice tinged with concern. \"We've tried every tactic, and still, he repels us.\"\n\nRoderick sighed, his gaze never leaving the castle. \"It's as if the castle itself is alive, working against us.\"\n\nIndeed, the castle was no ordinary fortress. Its walls were lined with intricate runes that glowed with an otherworldly light, and mechanical defenses powered by ancient magic thwarted every assault. But it was the lone man within who truly baffled them.\n\n\"Bring me the prisoner,\" Roderick ordered. Moments later, a hooded figure was brought before him, chains clinking with every step.\n\nThe prisoner, an enemy scout captured days ago, looked up with defiant eyes. \"You won't take the castle,\" he spat. \"No one ever has.\"\n\nRoderick knelt to meet the scout's gaze. \"Tell me about him. The man inside.\"\n\nThe scout's lips curled into a mocking smile. \"They call him the Scholar. Once a brilliant strategist, he retreated to this castle after the war took everything from him. Now, he uses his vast knowledge to protect it.\"\n\n\"Knowledge?\" Elira scoffed. \"How can knowledge stop an army?\"\n\nThe scout's smile widened. \"He knows every inch of that castle, every secret passage and hidden chamber. He uses the terrain to his advantage, setting traps and creating illusions to confuse you. You'll never reach him.\"\n\nRoderick stood, deep in thought. \"Thank you for the information,\" he said, signaling for the scout to be taken away. \"Captain, gather the officers. We need a new plan.\"\n\nAs night fell, the officers assembled in Roderick's tent, maps and charts spread out before them. Roderick traced a finger along the castle's defenses. \"He's using his intellect, not brute force. We need to outthink him.\"\n\n\"What do you propose, General?\" Elira asked.\n\n\"We'll use deception,\" Roderick replied. \"Create a diversion at the main gate, but our true objective will be the hidden tunnel beneath the hill. It's risky, but if we can surprise him, we might have a chance.\"\n\nThe officers nodded, and the plan was set in motion. As dawn broke, the army launched a feigned assault on the castle's main gate, drawing the Scholar's attention. Meanwhile, a small team, led by Roderick and Elira, made their way to the hidden tunnel.\n\nInside the castle, the Scholar observed the diversion through a series of enchanted mirrors. His eyes narrowed as he sensed something amiss. \"They're learning,\" he muttered. \"But so am I.\"\n\nAs the team emerged from the tunnel, they found themselves in a labyrinth of corridors, each one more confusing than the last. \"Stay close,\" Roderick whispered. \"We can't afford to get lost.\"\n\nSuddenly, the walls shifted, and the team found themselves separated. Roderick cursed under his breath. \"Illusions,\" he realized. \"He's manipulating the very architecture.\"\n\nElira, now alone, pressed forward, determined to find the Scholar. She emerged into a grand library, its shelves filled with ancient tomes. At the center stood the Scholar, his eyes calm and calculating.\n\n\"You've come far,\" he said, his voice echoing through the chamber. \"But you'll go no further.\"\n\nElira drew her sword. \"Surrender, and this can end peacefully.\"\n\nThe Scholar shook his head. \"Peace? There is no peace in war. Only strategy and survival.\"\n\nWith a flick of his wrist, the room transformed, and Elira found herself back at the entrance, the Scholar nowhere to be seen.\n\nDefeated, the team retreated, the castle's defenses unbroken. As Roderick stared up at the fortress once more, he couldn't help but admire the lone figure who had outsmarted an entire army. The castle, and its enigmatic defender, remained an unsolved riddle, a testament to the power of intellect over force.",

        "story_b": "The castle on the hill stood defiantly, its ancient stones bathed in the pale light of the moon. General Korath gazed up at it, frustration etched into his face. \"It is one man, by himself, in a castle on a hill. How does an ENTIRE ARMY fail to take it???\" he roared, his voice echoing through the valley. His officers shifted uncomfortably, unable to meet his eyes.\n\nHigh above, in the fortress, Alaric watched the scene unfold. He could hear Korath's anger, even from this distance. A smirk played on his lips as he turned back to the task at hand. The hidden pitfalls in the courtyard had been reset, the strategically placed archery slits manned with crossbows, and the boiling oil readied. Every detail had been meticulously planned.\n\nAlaric was alone, but this castle was his home, and he would defend it to his last breath. He knew every stone, every crevice, every secret passage. The castle had been in his family for generations, and its defenses were second nature to him. As he moved through the dimly lit corridors, he reflected on the isolation of his task. \"I may be alone, but this castle is my home, and I will defend it to my last breath,\" he muttered to himself.\n\nThe first attack came at dawn. Korath's soldiers surged forward, a wave of steel and fury. Alaric watched from the battlements, his eyes cold and calculating. He let them come, waiting until they were within the outer courtyard before triggering the traps. Hidden pitfalls opened beneath their feet, swallowing men whole. Arrows rained down from the slits, finding gaps in armor and bringing down the attackers with deadly precision.\n\n\"Every step you take is a step closer to your doom,\" Alaric whispered, his voice lost in the chaos below. He had studied the art of war, but he relied on more than just brute force. Psychological warfare was his weapon of choice. As the soldiers faltered, unsure of where the next attack would come from, Alaric struck again. He used the secret passages to move unseen, launching surprise attacks that sowed confusion and fear.\n\nKorath watched in disbelief as his men were repelled time and again. He ordered another assault, this time with siege towers and battering rams. But Alaric was ready. He had reinforced the gates and walls, collapsing sections of the wall to trap invaders and using boiling oil from the battlements to turn the siege towers into infernos.\n\n\"You underestimate me, General,\" Alaric murmured, as he watched the flames consume the towers. \"This castle has stood for centuries, and it will not fall today.\"\n\nDays turned into weeks, and still the castle stood. Alaric's cunning and resourcefulness kept the army at bay. He used the terrain to his advantage, creating the illusion of a larger defending force. Shadows moved along the battlements, voices echoed through the halls, and the ancient runes carved into the walls seemed to glow with protective energy.\n\nKorath, desperate and exhausted, sent envoys to parley. Alaric met them at the gate, his eyes hard and unyielding. \"You think you can take this castle?\" he said, his voice steady. \"Every move you make, I see it coming. This castle is my domain.\"\n\nThe envoys returned to Korath, their faces pale. They spoke of the lone defender's confidence and the impregnable defenses. Korath knew then that he had lost. His men were demoralized, their numbers dwindling. The castle on the hill had become a symbol of their failure.\n\nAs the army retreated, Alaric stood atop the battlements, watching them go. He felt a surge of triumph, but also a pang of sorrow. The siege had taken its toll, but he had defended his home. \"I must stay vigilant,\" he told himself. \"Every moment counts in this battle of wits.\"\n\nThe ancient stones of the castle walls seemed to hum with a silent strength, a testament to the countless sieges it had withstood. Alaric knew that as long as he stood, the castle would never fall.",

        "ground_truth": "In an endless world, a plain the size of a planet was filled to the brim with tents.  \nIn the main tent, the generals of each legion, and the Marshal of the entire army gathered, shivering around the table, as a young man toyed with a knife.  \n\"So, tell me, how are we still here, and not in the lands of the Ancient Empire?\", he asked.  \n\"Prince...the pass through this side is guarded...and we can't surround, or overwhelm with number, due to the pass's width...and...\", before the general could finish, a knife flashed, and his head was rolling on the floor, no blood spilt, the knife back in the hand of the young man.  \n\"It is one man, by himself, in a castle on a hill, castle that has been there for tens of thousands of years...ancient...  \nHow does the entire Northern Army of my Empire fail to take it?\", he calmly asked, but this calmness made the battle-hardened individuals shiver.\n\n  \n\"Prince, he awakened a royal Asura bloodline.\", the Marshal said.  \nAt this, the Prince stopped playing with the knife.  \n\"Which one?\", he asked.  \n\"Six-Armed Steel King Ashverosa's line, if it is the same or a branch's version, or a mutated one, it is yet unknown.\", she said.  \n\"You are a Dragonling, still young, but yet given the position of Marshal, oh Princess of Fire...fire melts steel, doesn't it?\", the prince continued.  \nThe generals froze, while the Marshal just sighed.\n\n  \n\"Perfect weapon mastery, and water, earth and steel element manipulation is what we observed as of now.  \nHe has insights into the laws of War, elements, weapons, and...Death.\", she said.  \n\"One of the Supreme Laws, huh?  \nHave you sent our succubi to charm him? Our spirits to tempt him? Bribe him?\", the prince continued.  \nThe Marshal fidgeted...and for the first time, the prince laughed.  \n\"So it's true! A duchess of our Empire! A pureblooded young fire dragon...has offered to wed an enemy!  \nAnd was...refused.  \nTell me, Princess of Fire...just how strong is he, for you to lower yourself that much in front of him?\", he asked.  \n\"Take a look yourself, Your Highness, for our attacks are never-ending...and been so for eight months now...\", she said, leaving the tent.\n\n  \nThe Prince left with the Marshal, and both flew high, watching the castle on the hill that led towards the mountains...and the single safe path into the lands of the Ancient Empire.  \nThere a six-armed grey skin tall man sat on the walls, as his hands never stopped throwing rocks, and spears at the approaching army.  \nEvery now and then, he jumped off with some spears, and wrecked havoc amidst the enemy lines.  \nThe earth fell and rose under his steps, the metal of the weapons and armors of the enemy shifted by his will, and a thick mist followed him, hiding him.  \n\"That's a pureblooded Asura, or at least it will be soon, as he continues to drink the blood of my people.  \nOffer him yourself, and my youngest sister, and tell him that he shall become an Archduke, or even a King under my father, the Emperor, only answering to Him and nobody else, and if he doesn't accept...  \nLevel the mountain, or dig a tunnel through it,  that will be easier than to win a fight of attrition against an Asura.\", the Prince said, as he left in an awful mood.  \nThe Marshal nodded, and gathered the generals once more, to discuss how to handle this...once and for all.  \nFor failure was not an option.",
        "story_a": "The castle loomed on the hill, an ancient sentinel carved from the bones of the earth itself. Its stone walls were weathered but unyielding, much like the man who inhabited it. General Markov stared at the fortress through his spyglass, his brow furrowing in frustration. How could one man, a single solitary figure, defy an entire army?\n\n\u201cHe must have some kind of weapon,\u201d Lieutenant Graff suggested, breaking the silence that had draped over the command tent like a heavy fog.\n\n\u201cOr maybe he\u2019s a sorcerer,\u201d another soldier muttered, earning a chorus of uneasy chuckles.\n\nMarkov lowered the spyglass and turned to his men. \u201cWe\u2019ve faced worse odds before. This is no different. Today, we take that castle.\u201d\n\nAs they approached the hill, the ground beneath their feet seemed to hum with an eerie vibration, like the heartbeat of an ancient beast. The soldiers exchanged nervous glances, but their training kept them moving forward. The man in the castle, known only as the Keeper, watched from the highest tower, his eyes like ice chips glinting in the morning sun.\n\nThe first wave of soldiers reached the castle gates, their battering ram crashing against the wood with a thunderous boom. But the gates held firm. As the soldiers prepared for another strike, the air around them began to shimmer. The Keeper raised his hand, and suddenly, the ground erupted with a series of blinding flashes.\n\n\u201cFall back!\u201d Markov shouted, but it was too late. The front line of soldiers was thrown back, their bodies crumpling like rag dolls. The survivors scrambled to regroup, their faces pale with fear.\n\n\u201cWhat in the gods\u2019 names was that?\u201d Graff gasped, his eyes wide with disbelief.\n\nMarkov didn\u2019t answer. He didn\u2019t need to. The Keeper had shown his hand, and it was a powerful one. The army\u2019s resolve began to waver, doubts creeping into their minds like dark tendrils. But Markov was not a man to be easily deterred.\n\n\u201cArchers, ready your bows!\u201d he commanded.\n\nThe archers lined up, their arrows trained on the castle windows. At Markov\u2019s signal, they loosed their arrows in a deadly barrage. The sky darkened with the sheer number of projectiles, but as they neared the castle, they seemed to meet an invisible barrier. The arrows clattered to the ground harmlessly.\n\nThe Keeper stood at the window, a faint smile playing on his lips. His voice, amplified by some unseen force, echoed down to the soldiers below. \u201cYou cannot take what is not yours. Leave now, and I will spare your lives.\u201d\n\nMarkov\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cWe will not be cowed by tricks and illusions. Ready the siege engines!\u201d\n\nThe soldiers hurried to comply, wheeling massive trebuchets into position. The first boulder was loaded and fired, sailing through the air with a deafening roar. But as it neared the castle, it too was repelled by the same invisible force.\n\nThe Keeper\u2019s smile widened. \u201cYou do not understand. This castle is alive. It protects me, as I protect it. You cannot defeat it, just as you cannot defeat the will of the earth itself.\u201d\n\nMarkov\u2019s heart sank. He had heard tales of such places, ancient strongholds imbued with the power of the land. But he had never believed them until now. He turned to his men, seeing the fear and doubt in their eyes. This was not a battle they could win.\n\n\u201cFall back,\u201d he ordered, his voice heavy with defeat. \u201cWe leave the castle to its Keeper.\u201d\n\nAs they retreated, Markov cast one last glance at the fortress on the hill. The Keeper stood watching, his expression unreadable. The castle had held its ground, an unassailable bastion. And the army, for all its might, had been humbled by one man and the living stone that guarded him.\n\nIn the end, it was not brute force or sheer numbers that determined victory, but the ancient, unyielding bond between the Keeper and his castle.",
        "story_b": "The army stretched across the horizon, a sea of banners and armor glinting in the sun as they marched towards the solitary castle on the hill. Each soldier was a part of the vast machine of war, their footsteps a rhythmic drumbeat on the parched earth. The general, astride a proud steed, surveyed the fortress with a calculating eye. \"It is one man, by himself, in a castle on a hill,\" he muttered, disbelief lacing his words. \"How does an entire army fail to take it?\"\n\nAs they neared the castle, the scale of the task before them became clear. The castle loomed above the valley, its towers piercing the sky like jagged teeth, shrouded in mist and shadow. The air was thick with tension, the anticipation of battle palpable.\n\nWith a command, the general ordered the first assault. Soldiers surged forward, a tide of humanity crashing against the ancient walls. The battering ram, a monstrous construct of wood and iron, swung forward, its impact echoing like thunder. But as it struck the gate, a hidden mechanism released a torrent of boiling oil, forcing the soldiers to retreat in disarray, their screams of agony piercing the air.\n\nThe general cursed under his breath. \"How can one man hold us at bay? What sorcery is this?\" His eyes narrowed, determination hardening his features. \"Again!\" he commanded, his voice a whip cracking through the chaos.\n\nThe army regrouped, their resolve unbroken. Archers took position, their arrows a deadly rain upon the castle. Yet, as the projectiles neared the walls, they seemed to dissolve into nothingness, as if consumed by an invisible fire. The soldiers exchanged bewildered glances, whispers of magic and curses passing between them.\n\nInside the castle, the lone defender moved with a quiet confidence, his eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of weakness in the enemy's ranks. He was a figure shrouded in mystery, his motives as enigmatic as the defenses he wielded. The walls around him were lined with runes that glowed faintly, a testament to the ancient magic that fortified its stones.\n\nAs night fell, the general devised a new plan. Under the cover of darkness, a group of elite soldiers crept towards the castle, intent on scaling its walls and taking the defender by surprise. As they climbed, their fingers brushing the cold stone, they found themselves ensnared by invisible webs, their cries echoing in the night. The general watched helplessly as his finest men vanished into the shadows, their fates sealed by unseen forces.\n\nDesperation clawed at the general's heart. He had underestimated his foe, a mistake that had cost him dearly. Yet, he refused to concede defeat. With dawn's light, he rallied his men for one final assault, a last bid to breach the impenetrable fortress.\n\nThe clash of steel and the roar of battle filled the air, a cacophony that reverberated off the castle's ancient stones. But as the army surged forward, they were met with a blinding flash of light, a radiance that seemed to emanate from the very heart of the castle itself. The soldiers faltered, their courage wavering as the light washed over them, leaving only awe in its wake.\n\nIn the end, it was not just the traps or the man's skill, but a pact with an ancient spirit that protected the castle from harm. As the army retreated, the castle stood defiant, a silent guardian against the encroaching tide of war. The general, defeated but not broken, rode away with a newfound respect for the power that lay within those walls.\n\nAnd the lone defender watched them go, his eyes alight with the knowledge that he was not alone, that the spirit of the castle would always stand by his side.",

        "prompt": "After moving into their dream apartment, Romi witnesses a neighbor's tragic death, but as the days pass, she begins to suspect the act was somehow meant to shatter her own carefully constructed life.",
        "ground_truth": "Three days after they moved into their new apartment, the woman who lived above them, on the eighth floor, jumped out of her window. Romi was just coming back from the coffee shop, carrying two lattes, when the neighbor hit the sidewalk. Romi dropped the tray, spilling coffee all over herself, and her eyes locked in on the stains on her sweatpants so she wouldn\u2019t have to see anything else. She heard running, panting, and voices shouting. Within seconds, a crowd had gathered, and the sweaty guy who cleaned the lobby was calling an ambulance. Someone said that the woman\u2019s name was Rinat or Ronit, and someone else said that she\u2019d seen her crying in the elevator a few days earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s because of COVID,\u201d the cleaner said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s committing suicide these days. They were just talking about it on the news.\u201d\n\nThe distant sirens mingled with the vibration of Romi\u2019s cell. It was Daniel, but she didn\u2019t want to tell him anything over the phone. She touched her cheeks to make sure she wasn\u2019t crying, took a deep breath, and walked into the building. \u201cHey!\u201d she heard the cleaner calling after her, and, when she turned around, he yelled, \u201cLady, where d\u2019you think you\u2019re going? You\u2019re a witness.\u201d \u201cA witness to what?\u201d Romi asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d But the cleaner wouldn\u2019t back down. \u201cYou were the closest one!\u201d he shouted. \u201cLook\u2014her blood\u2019s all over your clothes!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not blood. It\u2019s coffee. I dropped my coffee,\u201d Romi said. \u201cWell, it looks like blood to me,\u201d the cleaner proclaimed. \u201cThe police should have a look at it.\u201d Romi froze for a moment, but, when her phone started vibrating again, she kept walking. \u201cHey!\u201d the cleaner yelled again, but then a different male voice said, \u201cPoor girl. Leave her alone.\u201d\n\nDaniel opened the door irritably. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering my calls?\u201d he asked, but, before she could explain, he saw the stains on her sweats and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Are you O.K.?\u201d Romi wanted to tell him about the neighbor who\u2019d jumped and about the bossy cleaner and about how the stains on her pants would probably never come out, but all she could manage was a strange whimper. Daniel gave her one of his feeble hugs in which he barely touched her. \u201cCome on, baby, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\nShe told him everything. She wanted to feel sorry for the neighbor and say how horrible it was and how she must have really been suffering, but all that came out was anger. They\u2019d plunked down 3.4 million shekels for this apartment. Daniel\u2019s mother had given them almost a million and a half, and they\u2019d taken out a twenty-three-year mortgage for the rest. Twenty-three years! If Daniel got her pregnant now, having post-traumatic sex, she thought, the kid would grow up, finish school, join the army, fight a war, and be discharged\u2014and she and Daniel would still be paying for the apartment every month. And every time he came home from kindergarten\u2014this kid who didn\u2019t even exist yet\u2014or from high school, or on leave from the army, he would step over the spot where that Rinat or Ronit woman\u2019s body now lay.\n\nThe sales pitch for their apartment building had been that it was for \u201cupwardly mobile young professionals.\u201d People who bought homes here wanted to improve their lives: they took out loans, they poured in blood, sweat, and tears, and for what? So that some Rinat or Ronit would jump out her window and crush the life out of them? Even if the woman was depressed, she could at least have acknowledged that she wasn\u2019t the only person in this world and had the decency to kill herself in her bed or in the bathroom. If she simply had to jump out a window, then why not do it at a hotel instead of onto her neighbor\u2019s head? \u201cI don\u2019t want this,\u201d Romi told Daniel. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live here anymore. I can\u2019t live in a building where people jump.\u201d \u201cCalm down, babe,\u201d Daniel said, lightly stroking her back. \u201cIt\u2019s not the building. It\u2019s one woman who jumped. Poor thing. It has nothing to do with us at all.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not a poor thing,\u201d Romi fumed. \u201cI\u2019m the poor thing! Me and you and your mom. For this she dipped into her pension? So some neighbor whose name we don\u2019t even know could commit suicide right on our heads?\u201d\n\nThe woman\u2019s name turned out to be Sarit, and the next day Daniel insisted that they go to the funeral. He said that they needed closure, and that, as far as he was concerned, it was either a funeral or couples therapy. Romi had no desire to go to the funeral, but therapy sounded even worse, like a cross between mud wrestling and divorce court. Daniel typed the cemetery\u2019s address into Waze, and they hardly spoke the whole way there. When they arrived, he insisted on buying flowers from some religious guy who was selling half-wilted bunches out of black buckets. There were maybe ten other people there, and the only one she recognized was the cleaner from the lobby, who hurried over and said that it was totally unacceptable that she\u2019d left before the police got there yesterday. Instead of standing by her and telling the cleaner to leave her alone, Daniel nodded and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re right,\u201d and the cleaner walked away and came back a minute later with an elderly couple whose eyes were puffy. \u201cYou see?\u201d he said, gesturing at Romi. \u201cThis is the neighbor I told you about, who saw your daughter fall.\u201d The elderly man nodded and held out his hand, and, even though Romi and Daniel were very strict about social distancing, they both shook his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Isaac,\u201d he said, \u201cand this is Shoshana.\u201d After a moment, perhaps because no one else said anything, he added, \u201cWe\u2019re Sarit\u2019s parents,\u201d and, as soon as he said that, Shoshana started crying. \u201cWhen she fell,\u201d Isaac asked Romi, \u201ccould you see her? Her face?\u201d Romi didn\u2019t answer. She didn\u2019t know what to say, and she hoped that, if she waited long enough, Daniel would say something to get her out of it. But Daniel was quiet, and they all stood in silence, except for the mother, who kept weeping.\n\nThat night, Daniel fell asleep instantly and started snoring. Romi lay awake in bed for almost an hour, and then she got up, rolled a joint, and went out onto the balcony. A friend of Daniel\u2019s had sold them the pot; it smelled like cookies and was really potent. Romi looked down over the railing and tried to find the spot where the Sarit woman had hit the ground. At the funeral, the cleaner had talked about how the gray sidewalk had been covered with blood, but now, from seven floors up, everything looked clean and fresh, and a young couple were standing there making out.\n\nWhen Romi had told Daniel that she was angry at the woman for deciding to kill herself right as she was walking up, Daniel said that she was self-centered and it was time for her to grasp that not everything in the world had to do with her. But now, as she watched the couple practically fucking on the neatly trimmed hedge in front of her building, she couldn\u2019t help thinking that it definitely did have something to do with her. And that maybe Sarit had once believed that the new smell coming from the walls and the gleaming white marble in the lobby would restart her life, and then, when she\u2019d looked out and seen Romi coming back from the coffee shop in her sweats, she\u2019d had the impression, from that high-up vantage point, that Romi was happy and living in a perfect marriage, that she and Daniel were as close as the two paper cups in her coffee carrier. And maybe Sarit couldn\u2019t take it anymore, so she\u2019d jumped out the window in order to ruin everything for Romi. Just as Romi was dying to plummet onto those moaning lovers and knock the lust out of them.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The apartment was a sanctuary of light. Sunlight spilled through the floor-to-ceiling windows, pooling onto the wide-plank oak floors and casting soft, dappled shadows across the walls. Romi had waited years for this\u2014an apartment with high ceilings, a balcony overlooking the park, and an airy, open layout that made her feel as though she were floating above the city.\n\nOn the first evening, Romi stood on the balcony, feeling the cool stone beneath her bare feet. She sipped a glass of Pinot Grigio and watched the thrumming city below. Her husband, Daniel, had gone to bed early, exhausted from the move. Romi lingered, appreciating the solitude, the quiet that seemed almost surreal in a city as bustling as theirs.\n\nIt was then that she saw her. The woman from the building across the street, standing on her own balcony, staring directly at Romi. There was something unsettling in the way the woman\u2019s gaze fixed on her, something almost invasive. Romi shifted her weight, feeling a prickle of discomfort.\n\nThe woman raised a hand, but it wasn\u2019t a wave. It was more a slow, deliberate gesture, a flick of the wrist as if dismissing an invisible speck of dust. Then, before Romi could react, the woman climbed onto the balcony\u2019s edge and, with an almost ethereal grace, stepped off.\n\nThe scream that tore through Romi\u2019s throat was swallowed by the city\u2019s cacophony. She stumbled backward, dropping her glass, which shattered on the balcony floor, the wine spreading like a bloodstain. For a moment, she stood frozen, her mind refusing to process what she had just witnessed.\n\n---\n\nIn the days that followed, the police came and went, their questions perfunctory and routine. \u201cDid you know her?\u201d \u201cHad you ever spoken to her?\u201d \u201cDid she seem distressed?\u201d Romi\u2019s answers were all no. She hadn\u2019t known the woman; she hadn\u2019t even known her name until the officers mentioned it in passing\u2014Elena. The investigation concluded quickly, the verdict an apparent suicide. There was no note, no clear motive, just a sad, abrupt end to a life that had briefly, violently intersected with Romi\u2019s.\n\nBut the unease lingered, a shadow that wouldn\u2019t lift. Romi found herself unable to sleep, her dreams invaded by the image of Elena\u2019s final, almost serene expression. She began to notice small, disquieting changes in her own life. Daniel seemed distant, preoccupied. He spent more time at the office, leaving early and returning late, his excuses perfunctory.\n\nOne evening, Romi found herself standing on the balcony again, her eyes drawn to the spot where Elena had fallen. The street below looked the same, indifferent to the tragedy that had unfolded. A movement in Elena\u2019s apartment caught her eye. A man stood by the window, his face obscured by the curtains. He seemed to be watching her, just as Elena had.\n\nRomi\u2019s pulse quickened. She turned away, retreating into the apartment. She closed the balcony door behind her, sliding the lock into place as if that could keep the strangeness at bay. She told herself it was paranoia, a natural response to witnessing something so horrific. But the feeling that Elena\u2019s death was somehow connected to her own life gnawed at her.\n\n---\n\nAs the weeks passed, Romi\u2019s unease deepened. She started to notice other things\u2014small, inexplicable disturbances. Her favorite coffee mug cracked, a hairline fracture that seemed to grow each day until it finally split in two. The plants she had carefully arranged on the balcony began to wither, their leaves turning brown and brittle despite her meticulous care.\n\nRomi confided in her friend Maya, who listened with a mix of concern and skepticism. \u201cIt\u2019s just the stress,\u201d Maya said gently. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through a lot. Moving is stressful enough without... without what you saw.\u201d\n\nBut Romi couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that there was more to it. She began to delve into Elena\u2019s life, searching for answers. She found out that Elena had been an artist, her work often described as dark and enigmatic. Elena\u2019s pieces were filled with abstract shapes and shadowy figures, a stark contrast to the light and airiness Romi had sought in her own space.\n\nOne evening, Romi attended an exhibition at a small gallery in the West Village that featured some of Elena\u2019s work. The paintings were haunting, filled with a sense of foreboding that made Romi\u2019s skin prickle. As she moved through the gallery, she felt a presence beside her. The man from Elena\u2019s apartment stood a few feet away, his eyes fixed on her.\n\nHe approached, introducing himself as Marcus, Elena\u2019s brother. \u201cShe mentioned you,\u201d he said, his voice low and measured. \u201cShe said you had just moved in, that she watched you sometimes.\u201d\n\nRomi felt a chill. \u201cI didn\u2019t know her. We never spoke.\u201d\n\nMarcus nodded, his expression unreadable. \u201cElena was... sensitive. She felt things deeply, saw connections where others didn\u2019t. She was convinced that her life was intertwined with yours, that there was some kind of... cosmic link.\u201d\n\nRomi\u2019s heart pounded. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nMarcus looked at her intently. \u201cElena believed that her death would set something in motion, something that would reveal a truth about your life.\u201d\n\nRomi recoiled. \u201cThat\u2019s absurd.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it?\u201d Marcus\u2019s gaze was unwavering. \u201cHave you noticed anything... unusual since she died?\u201d\n\nRomi didn\u2019t answer, but Marcus seemed to read her silence. \u201cElena\u2019s death was a catalyst. She believed it would force you to confront something you\u2019ve been avoiding.\u201d\n\nRomi left the gallery, her mind a whirl of confusion and fear. She couldn\u2019t shake Marcus\u2019s words, couldn\u2019t dismiss the sense that Elena\u2019s death had indeed set something in motion.\n\n---\n\nBack at the apartment, Romi found Daniel sitting on the couch, his face drawn and weary. \u201cWe need to talk,\u201d he said, his voice tinged with resignation.\n\nAs he spoke, Romi felt a sense of detachment, as if she were watching the scene unfold from a distance. Daniel confessed to an affair, a betrayal that had been simmering beneath the surface for months. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Romi. I didn\u2019t know how to tell you. I didn\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d\n\nRomi\u2019s world tilted. The carefully constructed life she had built, the dream apartment that had seemed like a fresh start, now felt like a fragile facade. She thought of Elena, of the strange, knowing look in her eyes before she stepped off the balcony.\n\nIn the days that followed, Romi found herself returning to the balcony, staring out at the city, searching for meaning in the chaos. She began to see Elena\u2019s death not as a random tragedy, but as a deliberate act, a message that had forced her to confront the cracks in her own life.\n\nThe apartment, once a sanctuary, now felt like a place of reckoning. Romi knew she couldn\u2019t stay, that she needed to find a new path, a new way to rebuild. She packed her things, the act of leaving both painful and liberating.\n\nAs she closed the door behind her for the last time, Romi felt a strange sense of gratitude toward Elena. In her own tragic way, Elena had shattered the illusion Romi had clung to, forcing her to face a truth she had long avoided. And in that truth, Romi found the strength to begin anew.",
        "story_b": "Romi stood in the center of her new apartment, breathing in the scent of fresh paint and polished wood. Sunlight streamed through the expansive windows, casting warm patterns on the floor. Her heart swelled with a sense of triumph and anticipation. This was her sanctuary, her dream woven into reality. She arranged her books on the shelves, each one a testament to the journey that had led her here. The apartment was a canvas, and she was the artist, crafting a world of comfort and security.\n\nThe tranquility was shattered one morning with the shrill scream that echoed through the building's corridors. Romi rushed out, her heart pounding, to find a crowd gathering outside the apartment across the hall. The lifeless form of her neighbor, Mr. Ellison, lay sprawled at the foot of the stairs, his body twisted at unnatural angles. She felt a cold chill seep into her bones, the warmth of her new home suddenly gone. In the chaos, a single detail caught her eye\u2014a small, familiar bracelet glinting in the sunlight, one she hadn't noticed was missing.\n\nDays passed, but the image of Mr. Ellison's body lingered in Romi's mind like a specter. She tried to dismiss it, to focus on the rhythm of her life, but the questions persisted. Why had he fallen? Or had he been pushed? Her mind spun with possibilities, each more sinister than the last. She found herself scrutinizing the faces of her neighbors, wondering who among them harbored secrets.\n\nRomi's partner, Alex, tried to reassure her. \"It's a tragic accident, Romi,\" he said, his voice a steady anchor in her storm of thoughts. \"You need to let it go.\"\n\nBut Romi couldn't. Late at night, when the apartment was cloaked in shadows, she heard whispers in the walls, the soft creak of footsteps that stopped just outside her door. The flickering hallway lights cast eerie shadows, twisting familiar shapes into menacing forms. Her sanctuary felt tainted, as if the very walls were conspiring against her.\n\nShe began to piece together fragments of conversations, snippets overheard in the laundry room or the lobby. There was talk of Mr. Ellison's debts, of a dispute with a shadowy figure who had been seen visiting him. Each clue added to the tapestry of her suspicion, pulling at the threads of her sanity.\n\nOne afternoon, as Romi returned from the market, she found a note slipped under her door. The paper was crisp, the handwriting elegant yet hurried: \"Watch yourself. You're not alone.\" Her pulse quickened, fear and paranoia coiling around her like a serpent. She glanced around the hallway, feeling the weight of unseen eyes.\n\nShe confided in her friend, Lila, hoping for understanding. But Lila dismissed her fears with a wave of her hand. \"You're just stressed from the move, Romi. You're imagining things.\"\n\nRomi wanted to believe her, to chalk it up to stress and exhaustion. But that night, as she lay in bed, the ceiling seemed to close in on her, her mind a kaleidoscope of fractured thoughts. She remembered Mr. Ellison's kind smile, the way he'd once helped her with her groceries. The bracelet, his death, the note\u2014all pieces of a puzzle she couldn't solve.\n\nThe apartment building, which had once felt like a fortress, was now a labyrinth of shadows and secrets. The oppressive silence of the hallways pressed down on her, the air thick with unspoken truths. Each creak of the floorboards was a whisper of betrayal, each flicker of the lights a reminder of her growing isolation.\n\nRomi's dreams were filled with images of shattered glass, the fragments glinting like stars in the darkness. She saw herself reflected in each piece, her face distorted, her life unraveling like the threads of a tapestry being pulled apart.\n\nThe days blurred into one another, a haze of fear and uncertainty. Romi began to avoid the other residents, her interactions reduced to nods and brief exchanges. She felt their eyes on her, judging, questioning. Alex grew distant, their conversations stilted and fraught with tension. He couldn't understand her fixation, her need to unravel the truth.\n\nThen, one evening, as she sat alone in the dim glow of her living room, Romi found a small key hidden beneath the cushions of her sofa. It was unfamiliar, yet she felt an inexplicable connection to it. Driven by a compulsion she couldn't explain, she slipped it into her pocket and ventured into the basement storage area, a place she had never been before.\n\nThe air was cool and damp, the concrete walls lined with rows of metal lockers. She wandered the aisles, her footsteps echoing in the silence, until she found a locker that matched the key. Her hands trembled as she turned the lock, the door creaking open to reveal a collection of personal items\u2014a photograph of Mr. Ellison, a diary, a small jewelry box.\n\nAs she rifled through the items, she found a note tucked inside the jewelry box. The handwriting was the same as the note left at her door, and her heart leapt to her throat as she read the words: \"They watch from the shadows, waiting for you to fall.\"\n\nA shiver ran down her spine, the basement suddenly colder, the shadows deeper. She couldn't shake the feeling that her every move was being orchestrated, that her life was a play and she was merely an actor, following a script she hadn't written.\n\nRomi returned to her apartment, clutching the note like a lifeline. She felt the weight of the building around her, the walls closing in. She glanced at the photograph of Mr. Ellison, his eyes staring back at her with a knowing gaze.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Romi's world continued to spiral. She moved through her days like a ghost, haunted by whispers and shadows. The apartment, her dream home, had become a prison of uncertainty and fear. Her friendships frayed, her relationship with Alex strained to the breaking point.\n\nOne night, as she lay in bed, she heard the familiar creak of footsteps outside her door. Her heart raced, but this time, she felt a strange sense of calm. She rose and approached the door, her hand hovering over the doorknob. She hesitated, then opened it to find nothing but the empty hallway, the lights flickering ominously.\n\nIn that moment, Romi understood that the truth was a fluid thing, shaped by perception and fear. She returned to her room, the darkness wrapping around her like a shroud. She clutched the photograph of Mr. Ellison, her thoughts a jumble of certainty and doubt.\n\nThe next morning, she found another note, this time on her kitchen counter. \"Trust no one,\" it read, and she couldn't tell if it was a warning or a taunt, or if she had imagined the whole thing in the depths of her paranoia.\n\nAs she stood by the window, the city stretching out beneath her, Romi felt a strange sense of peace wash over her. Perhaps the truth would always elude her, the line between reality and imagination forever blurred. Her life, her carefully constructed tapestry, had unraveled, yet in its destruction, she found a new kind of freedom.\n\nThe apartment, with its sunlit rooms and polished floors, was still her home. And though the shadows remained, she was no longer afraid to face them. In the silence, she heard her own heartbeat, steady and true.",

        "ground_truth": "Three days after they moved into their new apartment, the woman who lived above them, on the eighth floor, jumped out of her window. Romi was just coming back from the coffee shop, carrying two lattes, when the neighbor hit the sidewalk. Romi dropped the tray, spilling coffee all over herself, and her eyes locked in on the stains on her sweatpants so she wouldn\u2019t have to see anything else. She heard running, panting, and voices shouting. Within seconds, a crowd had gathered, and the sweaty guy who cleaned the lobby was calling an ambulance. Someone said that the woman\u2019s name was Rinat or Ronit, and someone else said that she\u2019d seen her crying in the elevator a few days earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s because of COVID,\u201d the cleaner said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s committing suicide these days. They were just talking about it on the news.\u201d\n\nThe distant sirens mingled with the vibration of Romi\u2019s cell. It was Daniel, but she didn\u2019t want to tell him anything over the phone. She touched her cheeks to make sure she wasn\u2019t crying, took a deep breath, and walked into the building. \u201cHey!\u201d she heard the cleaner calling after her, and, when she turned around, he yelled, \u201cLady, where d\u2019you think you\u2019re going? You\u2019re a witness.\u201d \u201cA witness to what?\u201d Romi asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d But the cleaner wouldn\u2019t back down. \u201cYou were the closest one!\u201d he shouted. \u201cLook\u2014her blood\u2019s all over your clothes!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not blood. It\u2019s coffee. I dropped my coffee,\u201d Romi said. \u201cWell, it looks like blood to me,\u201d the cleaner proclaimed. \u201cThe police should have a look at it.\u201d Romi froze for a moment, but, when her phone started vibrating again, she kept walking. \u201cHey!\u201d the cleaner yelled again, but then a different male voice said, \u201cPoor girl. Leave her alone.\u201d\n\nDaniel opened the door irritably. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering my calls?\u201d he asked, but, before she could explain, he saw the stains on her sweats and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Are you O.K.?\u201d Romi wanted to tell him about the neighbor who\u2019d jumped and about the bossy cleaner and about how the stains on her pants would probably never come out, but all she could manage was a strange whimper. Daniel gave her one of his feeble hugs in which he barely touched her. \u201cCome on, baby, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\nShe told him everything. She wanted to feel sorry for the neighbor and say how horrible it was and how she must have really been suffering, but all that came out was anger. They\u2019d plunked down 3.4 million shekels for this apartment. Daniel\u2019s mother had given them almost a million and a half, and they\u2019d taken out a twenty-three-year mortgage for the rest. Twenty-three years! If Daniel got her pregnant now, having post-traumatic sex, she thought, the kid would grow up, finish school, join the army, fight a war, and be discharged\u2014and she and Daniel would still be paying for the apartment every month. And every time he came home from kindergarten\u2014this kid who didn\u2019t even exist yet\u2014or from high school, or on leave from the army, he would step over the spot where that Rinat or Ronit woman\u2019s body now lay.\n\nThe sales pitch for their apartment building had been that it was for \u201cupwardly mobile young professionals.\u201d People who bought homes here wanted to improve their lives: they took out loans, they poured in blood, sweat, and tears, and for what? So that some Rinat or Ronit would jump out her window and crush the life out of them? Even if the woman was depressed, she could at least have acknowledged that she wasn\u2019t the only person in this world and had the decency to kill herself in her bed or in the bathroom. If she simply had to jump out a window, then why not do it at a hotel instead of onto her neighbor\u2019s head? \u201cI don\u2019t want this,\u201d Romi told Daniel. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live here anymore. I can\u2019t live in a building where people jump.\u201d \u201cCalm down, babe,\u201d Daniel said, lightly stroking her back. \u201cIt\u2019s not the building. It\u2019s one woman who jumped. Poor thing. It has nothing to do with us at all.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not a poor thing,\u201d Romi fumed. \u201cI\u2019m the poor thing! Me and you and your mom. For this she dipped into her pension? So some neighbor whose name we don\u2019t even know could commit suicide right on our heads?\u201d\n\nThe woman\u2019s name turned out to be Sarit, and the next day Daniel insisted that they go to the funeral. He said that they needed closure, and that, as far as he was concerned, it was either a funeral or couples therapy. Romi had no desire to go to the funeral, but therapy sounded even worse, like a cross between mud wrestling and divorce court. Daniel typed the cemetery\u2019s address into Waze, and they hardly spoke the whole way there. When they arrived, he insisted on buying flowers from some religious guy who was selling half-wilted bunches out of black buckets. There were maybe ten other people there, and the only one she recognized was the cleaner from the lobby, who hurried over and said that it was totally unacceptable that she\u2019d left before the police got there yesterday. Instead of standing by her and telling the cleaner to leave her alone, Daniel nodded and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re right,\u201d and the cleaner walked away and came back a minute later with an elderly couple whose eyes were puffy. \u201cYou see?\u201d he said, gesturing at Romi. \u201cThis is the neighbor I told you about, who saw your daughter fall.\u201d The elderly man nodded and held out his hand, and, even though Romi and Daniel were very strict about social distancing, they both shook his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Isaac,\u201d he said, \u201cand this is Shoshana.\u201d After a moment, perhaps because no one else said anything, he added, \u201cWe\u2019re Sarit\u2019s parents,\u201d and, as soon as he said that, Shoshana started crying. \u201cWhen she fell,\u201d Isaac asked Romi, \u201ccould you see her? Her face?\u201d Romi didn\u2019t answer. She didn\u2019t know what to say, and she hoped that, if she waited long enough, Daniel would say something to get her out of it. But Daniel was quiet, and they all stood in silence, except for the mother, who kept weeping.\n\nThat night, Daniel fell asleep instantly and started snoring. Romi lay awake in bed for almost an hour, and then she got up, rolled a joint, and went out onto the balcony. A friend of Daniel\u2019s had sold them the pot; it smelled like cookies and was really potent. Romi looked down over the railing and tried to find the spot where the Sarit woman had hit the ground. At the funeral, the cleaner had talked about how the gray sidewalk had been covered with blood, but now, from seven floors up, everything looked clean and fresh, and a young couple were standing there making out.\n\nWhen Romi had told Daniel that she was angry at the woman for deciding to kill herself right as she was walking up, Daniel said that she was self-centered and it was time for her to grasp that not everything in the world had to do with her. But now, as she watched the couple practically fucking on the neatly trimmed hedge in front of her building, she couldn\u2019t help thinking that it definitely did have something to do with her. And that maybe Sarit had once believed that the new smell coming from the walls and the gleaming white marble in the lobby would restart her life, and then, when she\u2019d looked out and seen Romi coming back from the coffee shop in her sweats, she\u2019d had the impression, from that high-up vantage point, that Romi was happy and living in a perfect marriage, that she and Daniel were as close as the two paper cups in her coffee carrier. And maybe Sarit couldn\u2019t take it anymore, so she\u2019d jumped out the window in order to ruin everything for Romi. Just as Romi was dying to plummet onto those moaning lovers and knock the lust out of them.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The apartment was a sanctuary of light. Sunlight spilled through the floor-to-ceiling windows, pooling onto the wide-plank oak floors and casting soft, dappled shadows across the walls. Romi had waited years for this\u2014an apartment with high ceilings, a balcony overlooking the park, and an airy, open layout that made her feel as though she were floating above the city.\n\nOn the first evening, Romi stood on the balcony, feeling the cool stone beneath her bare feet. She sipped a glass of Pinot Grigio and watched the thrumming city below. Her husband, Daniel, had gone to bed early, exhausted from the move. Romi lingered, appreciating the solitude, the quiet that seemed almost surreal in a city as bustling as theirs.\n\nIt was then that she saw her. The woman from the building across the street, standing on her own balcony, staring directly at Romi. There was something unsettling in the way the woman\u2019s gaze fixed on her, something almost invasive. Romi shifted her weight, feeling a prickle of discomfort.\n\nThe woman raised a hand, but it wasn\u2019t a wave. It was more a slow, deliberate gesture, a flick of the wrist as if dismissing an invisible speck of dust. Then, before Romi could react, the woman climbed onto the balcony\u2019s edge and, with an almost ethereal grace, stepped off.\n\nThe scream that tore through Romi\u2019s throat was swallowed by the city\u2019s cacophony. She stumbled backward, dropping her glass, which shattered on the balcony floor, the wine spreading like a bloodstain. For a moment, she stood frozen, her mind refusing to process what she had just witnessed.\n\n---\n\nIn the days that followed, the police came and went, their questions perfunctory and routine. \u201cDid you know her?\u201d \u201cHad you ever spoken to her?\u201d \u201cDid she seem distressed?\u201d Romi\u2019s answers were all no. She hadn\u2019t known the woman; she hadn\u2019t even known her name until the officers mentioned it in passing\u2014Elena. The investigation concluded quickly, the verdict an apparent suicide. There was no note, no clear motive, just a sad, abrupt end to a life that had briefly, violently intersected with Romi\u2019s.\n\nBut the unease lingered, a shadow that wouldn\u2019t lift. Romi found herself unable to sleep, her dreams invaded by the image of Elena\u2019s final, almost serene expression. She began to notice small, disquieting changes in her own life. Daniel seemed distant, preoccupied. He spent more time at the office, leaving early and returning late, his excuses perfunctory.\n\nOne evening, Romi found herself standing on the balcony again, her eyes drawn to the spot where Elena had fallen. The street below looked the same, indifferent to the tragedy that had unfolded. A movement in Elena\u2019s apartment caught her eye. A man stood by the window, his face obscured by the curtains. He seemed to be watching her, just as Elena had.\n\nRomi\u2019s pulse quickened. She turned away, retreating into the apartment. She closed the balcony door behind her, sliding the lock into place as if that could keep the strangeness at bay. She told herself it was paranoia, a natural response to witnessing something so horrific. But the feeling that Elena\u2019s death was somehow connected to her own life gnawed at her.\n\n---\n\nAs the weeks passed, Romi\u2019s unease deepened. She started to notice other things\u2014small, inexplicable disturbances. Her favorite coffee mug cracked, a hairline fracture that seemed to grow each day until it finally split in two. The plants she had carefully arranged on the balcony began to wither, their leaves turning brown and brittle despite her meticulous care.\n\nRomi confided in her friend Maya, who listened with a mix of concern and skepticism. \u201cIt\u2019s just the stress,\u201d Maya said gently. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through a lot. Moving is stressful enough without... without what you saw.\u201d\n\nBut Romi couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that there was more to it. She began to delve into Elena\u2019s life, searching for answers. She found out that Elena had been an artist, her work often described as dark and enigmatic. Elena\u2019s pieces were filled with abstract shapes and shadowy figures, a stark contrast to the light and airiness Romi had sought in her own space.\n\nOne evening, Romi attended an exhibition at a small gallery in the West Village that featured some of Elena\u2019s work. The paintings were haunting, filled with a sense of foreboding that made Romi\u2019s skin prickle. As she moved through the gallery, she felt a presence beside her. The man from Elena\u2019s apartment stood a few feet away, his eyes fixed on her.\n\nHe approached, introducing himself as Marcus, Elena\u2019s brother. \u201cShe mentioned you,\u201d he said, his voice low and measured. \u201cShe said you had just moved in, that she watched you sometimes.\u201d\n\nRomi felt a chill. \u201cI didn\u2019t know her. We never spoke.\u201d\n\nMarcus nodded, his expression unreadable. \u201cElena was... sensitive. She felt things deeply, saw connections where others didn\u2019t. She was convinced that her life was intertwined with yours, that there was some kind of... cosmic link.\u201d\n\nRomi\u2019s heart pounded. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nMarcus looked at her intently. \u201cElena believed that her death would set something in motion, something that would reveal a truth about your life.\u201d\n\nRomi recoiled. \u201cThat\u2019s absurd.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it?\u201d Marcus\u2019s gaze was unwavering. \u201cHave you noticed anything... unusual since she died?\u201d\n\nRomi didn\u2019t answer, but Marcus seemed to read her silence. \u201cElena\u2019s death was a catalyst. She believed it would force you to confront something you\u2019ve been avoiding.\u201d\n\nRomi left the gallery, her mind a whirl of confusion and fear. She couldn\u2019t shake Marcus\u2019s words, couldn\u2019t dismiss the sense that Elena\u2019s death had indeed set something in motion.\n\n---\n\nBack at the apartment, Romi found Daniel sitting on the couch, his face drawn and weary. \u201cWe need to talk,\u201d he said, his voice tinged with resignation.\n\nAs he spoke, Romi felt a sense of detachment, as if she were watching the scene unfold from a distance. Daniel confessed to an affair, a betrayal that had been simmering beneath the surface for months. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Romi. I didn\u2019t know how to tell you. I didn\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d\n\nRomi\u2019s world tilted. The carefully constructed life she had built, the dream apartment that had seemed like a fresh start, now felt like a fragile facade. She thought of Elena, of the strange, knowing look in her eyes before she stepped off the balcony.\n\nIn the days that followed, Romi found herself returning to the balcony, staring out at the city, searching for meaning in the chaos. She began to see Elena\u2019s death not as a random tragedy, but as a deliberate act, a message that had forced her to confront the cracks in her own life.\n\nThe apartment, once a sanctuary, now felt like a place of reckoning. Romi knew she couldn\u2019t stay, that she needed to find a new path, a new way to rebuild. She packed her things, the act of leaving both painful and liberating.\n\nAs she closed the door behind her for the last time, Romi felt a strange sense of gratitude toward Elena. In her own tragic way, Elena had shattered the illusion Romi had clung to, forcing her to face a truth she had long avoided. And in that truth, Romi found the strength to begin anew.",
        "story_b": "The apartment was everything Romi had ever imagined for herself. It was the kind of place that seemed to promise transformation, perched high above the city with its sprawling windows that captured the sunrise like a secret whispered just for her. The floors were a deep mahogany that gleamed under the soft light, and every corner was filled with the potential for new beginnings. She had moved in with her partner, Jonah, and together they had started to craft a life that felt both secure and expansive. It was, she believed, the culmination of every dream she'd had since childhood.\n\nBut a week into their new life, as Romi was arranging a line of succulents on the windowsill, it happened. The scream was piercing, cutting through the quiet morning air like a jagged shard of glass. She rushed to the window just in time to see the figure plummet, a blur of movement that ended in a sickening thud. It was the neighbor, Mrs. Gellar, from two floors above. The sound of her impact reverberated through Romi's bones, leaving a tremor that wouldn't dissipate.\n\nThe official word was that it was an accident\u2014Mrs. Gellar had lost her balance while cleaning her windows. But as Romi watched the paramedics and police mill about below, a seed of doubt took root. It was an accident, everyone said, yet the image of Mrs. Gellar's fall replayed in her mind, relentless and haunting.\n\nIn the days that followed, Romi found herself drawn into an uneasy obsession. She couldn't shake the feeling that the event was somehow connected to her own life, that it was meant to disrupt the fragile balance she had only just begun to establish. Jonah tried to reassure her, his voice a steady anchor, but Romi felt herself slipping into an eddy of suspicion and fear.\n\n\"Romi, you need to let it go,\" Jonah said one evening, his hand a comforting weight on her shoulder. They were sitting in the living room, the city sprawled out below them like a glittering tapestry. \"It was a tragic accident. It's horrible, but it has nothing to do with us.\"\n\nShe wanted to believe him, to sink into the warmth of his certainty, but the feeling gnawed at her, insistent and unyielding. It wasn't just the death\u2014it was everything that came after. The whispers she heard in the hallway, the way the light seemed to flicker at the edge of her vision, the constant sense of being watched.\n\nRomi began to search for answers, digging through old newspaper clippings and records at the local library. What she found only deepened her unease. The building had a history of strange occurrences\u2014a tenant who vanished without a trace, another who reportedly went mad and set fire to his apartment. It was as though the place itself was woven with threads of mystery and malevolence, each story a faint echo of Mrs. Gellar's tragic end.\n\nHer dreams were filled with images of the neighbor, a spectral figure who appeared at the foot of her bed, whispering warnings that dissolved into the night air before she could fully comprehend them. Sometimes Romi would awaken to find objects moved\u2014a book out of place, a chair slightly askew\u2014and she couldn't be sure if it was her own growing paranoia or something more sinister at work.\n\nJonah grew concerned, his attempts to comfort her tinged with a quiet desperation. \"It's all in your head, Romi,\" he said one night, pulling her close. She could feel the steady thrum of his heart against her cheek, a reminder of the world outside her spiraling thoughts. \"You're letting this consume you.\"\n\nBut Romi couldn't let it go. She felt a strange kinship with the apartment, as if it were alive and breathing, its walls whispering secrets meant only for her. The creaking of the floors became a language of its own, a series of codes and messages that she was determined to decipher.\n\nOne evening, after Jonah had gone to bed, Romi found herself standing in the hallway, staring at the door to Mrs. Gellar's apartment. It was ajar, a sliver of darkness inviting her in. Her heart pounded in her chest, a drumbeat of fear and curiosity, as she stepped inside.\n\nThe apartment was untouched, a time capsule of Mrs. Gellar's life. Everything was as it had been\u2014a cup of tea gone cold on the table, a book splayed open on the armrest of a chair. As Romi moved through the space, she felt the air shift around her, a subtle acknowledgment of her presence.\n\nIn the living room, she found a stack of old letters, their edges yellowed with age. She skimmed through them, her eyes catching on certain phrases\u2014words of longing, of unspoken fears. In one letter, Mrs. Gellar had written about the building, describing it as a place of shadows, where the walls seemed to close in and the air was thick with secrets.\n\nRomi felt a chill run down her spine, a validation of her suspicions. The apartment, the building\u2014it was all connected, a web of fate that had ensnared her in its threads. She backed away, her breath coming in shallow gasps, and fled down the stairs to her own apartment, the door slamming shut behind her.\n\nBack in her living room, Romi stood by the window, the city lights reflecting in her eyes like a thousand tiny stars. The night was quiet, the silence a soothing balm to her frayed nerves. As she gazed out at the sprawling cityscape, she saw her own reflection in the glass, a ghostly image that seemed to hover between reality and the surreal.\n\nShe thought of Mrs. Gellar, of the woman's final moments, and felt a pang of grief for a life interrupted. But there was also a strange sense of clarity, a recognition that her fears and obsessions were a reflection of her own insecurities, her need for control in a world that was inherently unpredictable.\n\nJonah joined her at the window, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. \"Are you okay?\" he asked softly, his voice a gentle reminder that she was not alone.\n\nRomi leaned into him, letting the warmth of his presence ground her. \"I think so,\" she replied, her voice barely above a whisper. \"I just...I needed to understand.\"\n\nThey stood together in silence, the weight of the apartment's mysteries settling into the background, a whisper rather than a roar. Romi realized that she could never fully control the world around her, nor could she unravel every thread of fate that intersected with her own life. But she could choose how to live within that uncertainty, to find strength in her vulnerability and embrace the fragile beauty of her constructed world.\n\nAs she looked out at the city, the first light of dawn breaking over the horizon, Romi felt a sense of peace settle over her. The apartment, with all its shadows and secrets, was still her sanctuary, a place where she could confront her fears and emerge, if not unscathed, then at least more whole.\n\nIn that moment, Romi understood that the true unraveling had been within her, a necessary dismantling of illusions that allowed her to rebuild, to breathe anew. And as she stood there, the soft glow of morning washing over her, she knew that she was ready to begin again.",

        "ground_truth": "Three days after they moved into their new apartment, the woman who lived above them, on the eighth floor, jumped out of her window. Romi was just coming back from the coffee shop, carrying two lattes, when the neighbor hit the sidewalk. Romi dropped the tray, spilling coffee all over herself, and her eyes locked in on the stains on her sweatpants so she wouldn\u2019t have to see anything else. She heard running, panting, and voices shouting. Within seconds, a crowd had gathered, and the sweaty guy who cleaned the lobby was calling an ambulance. Someone said that the woman\u2019s name was Rinat or Ronit, and someone else said that she\u2019d seen her crying in the elevator a few days earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s because of COVID,\u201d the cleaner said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s committing suicide these days. They were just talking about it on the news.\u201d\n\nThe distant sirens mingled with the vibration of Romi\u2019s cell. It was Daniel, but she didn\u2019t want to tell him anything over the phone. She touched her cheeks to make sure she wasn\u2019t crying, took a deep breath, and walked into the building. \u201cHey!\u201d she heard the cleaner calling after her, and, when she turned around, he yelled, \u201cLady, where d\u2019you think you\u2019re going? You\u2019re a witness.\u201d \u201cA witness to what?\u201d Romi asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d But the cleaner wouldn\u2019t back down. \u201cYou were the closest one!\u201d he shouted. \u201cLook\u2014her blood\u2019s all over your clothes!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not blood. It\u2019s coffee. I dropped my coffee,\u201d Romi said. \u201cWell, it looks like blood to me,\u201d the cleaner proclaimed. \u201cThe police should have a look at it.\u201d Romi froze for a moment, but, when her phone started vibrating again, she kept walking. \u201cHey!\u201d the cleaner yelled again, but then a different male voice said, \u201cPoor girl. Leave her alone.\u201d\n\nDaniel opened the door irritably. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering my calls?\u201d he asked, but, before she could explain, he saw the stains on her sweats and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Are you O.K.?\u201d Romi wanted to tell him about the neighbor who\u2019d jumped and about the bossy cleaner and about how the stains on her pants would probably never come out, but all she could manage was a strange whimper. Daniel gave her one of his feeble hugs in which he barely touched her. \u201cCome on, baby, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\nShe told him everything. She wanted to feel sorry for the neighbor and say how horrible it was and how she must have really been suffering, but all that came out was anger. They\u2019d plunked down 3.4 million shekels for this apartment. Daniel\u2019s mother had given them almost a million and a half, and they\u2019d taken out a twenty-three-year mortgage for the rest. Twenty-three years! If Daniel got her pregnant now, having post-traumatic sex, she thought, the kid would grow up, finish school, join the army, fight a war, and be discharged\u2014and she and Daniel would still be paying for the apartment every month. And every time he came home from kindergarten\u2014this kid who didn\u2019t even exist yet\u2014or from high school, or on leave from the army, he would step over the spot where that Rinat or Ronit woman\u2019s body now lay.\n\nThe sales pitch for their apartment building had been that it was for \u201cupwardly mobile young professionals.\u201d People who bought homes here wanted to improve their lives: they took out loans, they poured in blood, sweat, and tears, and for what? So that some Rinat or Ronit would jump out her window and crush the life out of them? Even if the woman was depressed, she could at least have acknowledged that she wasn\u2019t the only person in this world and had the decency to kill herself in her bed or in the bathroom. If she simply had to jump out a window, then why not do it at a hotel instead of onto her neighbor\u2019s head? \u201cI don\u2019t want this,\u201d Romi told Daniel. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live here anymore. I can\u2019t live in a building where people jump.\u201d \u201cCalm down, babe,\u201d Daniel said, lightly stroking her back. \u201cIt\u2019s not the building. It\u2019s one woman who jumped. Poor thing. It has nothing to do with us at all.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not a poor thing,\u201d Romi fumed. \u201cI\u2019m the poor thing! Me and you and your mom. For this she dipped into her pension? So some neighbor whose name we don\u2019t even know could commit suicide right on our heads?\u201d\n\nThe woman\u2019s name turned out to be Sarit, and the next day Daniel insisted that they go to the funeral. He said that they needed closure, and that, as far as he was concerned, it was either a funeral or couples therapy. Romi had no desire to go to the funeral, but therapy sounded even worse, like a cross between mud wrestling and divorce court. Daniel typed the cemetery\u2019s address into Waze, and they hardly spoke the whole way there. When they arrived, he insisted on buying flowers from some religious guy who was selling half-wilted bunches out of black buckets. There were maybe ten other people there, and the only one she recognized was the cleaner from the lobby, who hurried over and said that it was totally unacceptable that she\u2019d left before the police got there yesterday. Instead of standing by her and telling the cleaner to leave her alone, Daniel nodded and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re right,\u201d and the cleaner walked away and came back a minute later with an elderly couple whose eyes were puffy. \u201cYou see?\u201d he said, gesturing at Romi. \u201cThis is the neighbor I told you about, who saw your daughter fall.\u201d The elderly man nodded and held out his hand, and, even though Romi and Daniel were very strict about social distancing, they both shook his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Isaac,\u201d he said, \u201cand this is Shoshana.\u201d After a moment, perhaps because no one else said anything, he added, \u201cWe\u2019re Sarit\u2019s parents,\u201d and, as soon as he said that, Shoshana started crying. \u201cWhen she fell,\u201d Isaac asked Romi, \u201ccould you see her? Her face?\u201d Romi didn\u2019t answer. She didn\u2019t know what to say, and she hoped that, if she waited long enough, Daniel would say something to get her out of it. But Daniel was quiet, and they all stood in silence, except for the mother, who kept weeping.\n\nThat night, Daniel fell asleep instantly and started snoring. Romi lay awake in bed for almost an hour, and then she got up, rolled a joint, and went out onto the balcony. A friend of Daniel\u2019s had sold them the pot; it smelled like cookies and was really potent. Romi looked down over the railing and tried to find the spot where the Sarit woman had hit the ground. At the funeral, the cleaner had talked about how the gray sidewalk had been covered with blood, but now, from seven floors up, everything looked clean and fresh, and a young couple were standing there making out.\n\nWhen Romi had told Daniel that she was angry at the woman for deciding to kill herself right as she was walking up, Daniel said that she was self-centered and it was time for her to grasp that not everything in the world had to do with her. But now, as she watched the couple practically fucking on the neatly trimmed hedge in front of her building, she couldn\u2019t help thinking that it definitely did have something to do with her. And that maybe Sarit had once believed that the new smell coming from the walls and the gleaming white marble in the lobby would restart her life, and then, when she\u2019d looked out and seen Romi coming back from the coffee shop in her sweats, she\u2019d had the impression, from that high-up vantage point, that Romi was happy and living in a perfect marriage, that she and Daniel were as close as the two paper cups in her coffee carrier. And maybe Sarit couldn\u2019t take it anymore, so she\u2019d jumped out the window in order to ruin everything for Romi. Just as Romi was dying to plummet onto those moaning lovers and knock the lust out of them.\n\n",
        "story_a": "The apartment was a sanctuary of light. Sunlight spilled through the floor-to-ceiling windows, pooling onto the wide-plank oak floors and casting soft, dappled shadows across the walls. Romi had waited years for this\u2014an apartment with high ceilings, a balcony overlooking the park, and an airy, open layout that made her feel as though she were floating above the city.\n\nOn the first evening, Romi stood on the balcony, feeling the cool stone beneath her bare feet. She sipped a glass of Pinot Grigio and watched the thrumming city below. Her husband, Daniel, had gone to bed early, exhausted from the move. Romi lingered, appreciating the solitude, the quiet that seemed almost surreal in a city as bustling as theirs.\n\nIt was then that she saw her. The woman from the building across the street, standing on her own balcony, staring directly at Romi. There was something unsettling in the way the woman\u2019s gaze fixed on her, something almost invasive. Romi shifted her weight, feeling a prickle of discomfort.\n\nThe woman raised a hand, but it wasn\u2019t a wave. It was more a slow, deliberate gesture, a flick of the wrist as if dismissing an invisible speck of dust. Then, before Romi could react, the woman climbed onto the balcony\u2019s edge and, with an almost ethereal grace, stepped off.\n\nThe scream that tore through Romi\u2019s throat was swallowed by the city\u2019s cacophony. She stumbled backward, dropping her glass, which shattered on the balcony floor, the wine spreading like a bloodstain. For a moment, she stood frozen, her mind refusing to process what she had just witnessed.\n\n---\n\nIn the days that followed, the police came and went, their questions perfunctory and routine. \u201cDid you know her?\u201d \u201cHad you ever spoken to her?\u201d \u201cDid she seem distressed?\u201d Romi\u2019s answers were all no. She hadn\u2019t known the woman; she hadn\u2019t even known her name until the officers mentioned it in passing\u2014Elena. The investigation concluded quickly, the verdict an apparent suicide. There was no note, no clear motive, just a sad, abrupt end to a life that had briefly, violently intersected with Romi\u2019s.\n\nBut the unease lingered, a shadow that wouldn\u2019t lift. Romi found herself unable to sleep, her dreams invaded by the image of Elena\u2019s final, almost serene expression. She began to notice small, disquieting changes in her own life. Daniel seemed distant, preoccupied. He spent more time at the office, leaving early and returning late, his excuses perfunctory.\n\nOne evening, Romi found herself standing on the balcony again, her eyes drawn to the spot where Elena had fallen. The street below looked the same, indifferent to the tragedy that had unfolded. A movement in Elena\u2019s apartment caught her eye. A man stood by the window, his face obscured by the curtains. He seemed to be watching her, just as Elena had.\n\nRomi\u2019s pulse quickened. She turned away, retreating into the apartment. She closed the balcony door behind her, sliding the lock into place as if that could keep the strangeness at bay. She told herself it was paranoia, a natural response to witnessing something so horrific. But the feeling that Elena\u2019s death was somehow connected to her own life gnawed at her.\n\n---\n\nAs the weeks passed, Romi\u2019s unease deepened. She started to notice other things\u2014small, inexplicable disturbances. Her favorite coffee mug cracked, a hairline fracture that seemed to grow each day until it finally split in two. The plants she had carefully arranged on the balcony began to wither, their leaves turning brown and brittle despite her meticulous care.\n\nRomi confided in her friend Maya, who listened with a mix of concern and skepticism. \u201cIt\u2019s just the stress,\u201d Maya said gently. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through a lot. Moving is stressful enough without... without what you saw.\u201d\n\nBut Romi couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that there was more to it. She began to delve into Elena\u2019s life, searching for answers. She found out that Elena had been an artist, her work often described as dark and enigmatic. Elena\u2019s pieces were filled with abstract shapes and shadowy figures, a stark contrast to the light and airiness Romi had sought in her own space.\n\nOne evening, Romi attended an exhibition at a small gallery in the West Village that featured some of Elena\u2019s work. The paintings were haunting, filled with a sense of foreboding that made Romi\u2019s skin prickle. As she moved through the gallery, she felt a presence beside her. The man from Elena\u2019s apartment stood a few feet away, his eyes fixed on her.\n\nHe approached, introducing himself as Marcus, Elena\u2019s brother. \u201cShe mentioned you,\u201d he said, his voice low and measured. \u201cShe said you had just moved in, that she watched you sometimes.\u201d\n\nRomi felt a chill. \u201cI didn\u2019t know her. We never spoke.\u201d\n\nMarcus nodded, his expression unreadable. \u201cElena was... sensitive. She felt things deeply, saw connections where others didn\u2019t. She was convinced that her life was intertwined with yours, that there was some kind of... cosmic link.\u201d\n\nRomi\u2019s heart pounded. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nMarcus looked at her intently. \u201cElena believed that her death would set something in motion, something that would reveal a truth about your life.\u201d\n\nRomi recoiled. \u201cThat\u2019s absurd.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it?\u201d Marcus\u2019s gaze was unwavering. \u201cHave you noticed anything... unusual since she died?\u201d\n\nRomi didn\u2019t answer, but Marcus seemed to read her silence. \u201cElena\u2019s death was a catalyst. She believed it would force you to confront something you\u2019ve been avoiding.\u201d\n\nRomi left the gallery, her mind a whirl of confusion and fear. She couldn\u2019t shake Marcus\u2019s words, couldn\u2019t dismiss the sense that Elena\u2019s death had indeed set something in motion.\n\n---\n\nBack at the apartment, Romi found Daniel sitting on the couch, his face drawn and weary. \u201cWe need to talk,\u201d he said, his voice tinged with resignation.\n\nAs he spoke, Romi felt a sense of detachment, as if she were watching the scene unfold from a distance. Daniel confessed to an affair, a betrayal that had been simmering beneath the surface for months. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Romi. I didn\u2019t know how to tell you. I didn\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d\n\nRomi\u2019s world tilted. The carefully constructed life she had built, the dream apartment that had seemed like a fresh start, now felt like a fragile facade. She thought of Elena, of the strange, knowing look in her eyes before she stepped off the balcony.\n\nIn the days that followed, Romi found herself returning to the balcony, staring out at the city, searching for meaning in the chaos. She began to see Elena\u2019s death not as a random tragedy, but as a deliberate act, a message that had forced her to confront the cracks in her own life.\n\nThe apartment, once a sanctuary, now felt like a place of reckoning. Romi knew she couldn\u2019t stay, that she needed to find a new path, a new way to rebuild. She packed her things, the act of leaving both painful and liberating.\n\nAs she closed the door behind her for the last time, Romi felt a strange sense of gratitude toward Elena. In her own tragic way, Elena had shattered the illusion Romi had clung to, forcing her to face a truth she had long avoided. And in that truth, Romi found the strength to begin anew.",
        "story_b": "In this new chapter of my life, the ink is stained with questions and shadows. The apartment was supposed to be my sanctuary, a place where the light would always find me, where the walls would hold me safe and sound. But now, each shadow grows long and menacing, whispering secrets I am not prepared to hear.\n\nThe day we moved in, everything felt pristine, untouched by the chaos of the world. But the illusion shattered the night my neighbor fell. I was looking out the window, admiring the city lights, when she plummeted past, a silent scream etched onto her face. I froze, my breath stolen by the horror of it. People gathered below, their voices rising like a tide, but in my mind, a darker story began to form.\n\nEvery whisper in the hallway feels like a dagger aimed at my sanity now. The neighbors, with their polite smiles and empty eyes, all seem to know something I don't. Or maybe it's just me\u2014my mind playing tricks, conjuring conspiracies where none exist. I see their glances, hear their hushed conversations, and I wonder: was it an accident, or was it orchestrated? Was she their first, or am I next?\n\nThe last time I felt this way, I was standing in the ruins of my first home, watching it burn. The flames licked the sky, mocking my helplessness. That was the beginning of my anxiety, the first taste of fear that has since become a familiar companion. Now, it settles in again, thick and suffocating.\n\nI try to drown it out with my art. Each sketch of the apartment grows darker, the lines more frantic, as if the page itself is trying to scream. But the release is fleeting. The shadows creep back in, whispering their dreadful secrets.\n\nI imagine different scenarios of her death, each one more sinister than the last. In my mind, I see a shadowy figure, a hand reaching out, a scream cut short. The sound echoes through my dreams, where she stands at the foot of my bed, her eyes pleading, \"Beware the cracks in your foundation.\"\n\nI can't trust them. I can't even trust myself. My hands shake as I write this, the pen slipping between my fingers. I confront them, these neighbors with their secrets. \"I know you were there that night. What did you see?\" My voice is a blade, sharp and accusing, but they only look at me with pity, their answers hidden behind layers of deceit.\n\nThe apartment, once a comforting white, now seems to close in, suffocating in its silence. The walls echo with my growing desperation, every creak of the floorboards a countdown to my breaking point. This place was supposed to be my escape, not my nightmare.\n\nI sit in the living room, surrounded by the sketches that speak of my unraveling mind. The windows are dark now, the city lights dimmed. I think of her, the neighbor, and I wonder what she felt in those final moments. Was she afraid? Did she know she was falling?\n\nI hear a knock at the door and my heart leaps. It's one of them, I know it. I approach cautiously, my hand trembling as I turn the knob. It's Mrs. Carter, the kindly old woman from the floor below. Her eyes are soft, her voice gentle, but I can't help but see her as part of the conspiracy.\n\n\"Romi, dear, are you alright? You've been so quiet lately,\" she says, her concern genuine, but I only hear the lie.\n\n\"I'm fine,\" I lie, my voice betraying me. \"Just busy with work.\"\n\nShe nods, but her eyes linger on me a moment too long. \"If you need anything, I'm just downstairs,\" she offers, and I nod, watching as she retreats back into the shadows.\n\nThe apartment is quiet again, the silence a living thing, wrapping around me like a shroud. I pick up my journal, the pages stained with questions and shadows, and I write, hoping to find clarity in the chaos.\n\nIn my dreams, she visits me again. Her face is serene now, the fear replaced by something else\u2014understanding, perhaps. \"You mustn't be afraid,\" she whispers, her voice like a breeze. \"The truth will find you.\"\n\nBut what is the truth? Each day, I feel it slipping further away, hidden behind the smiles and whispers of those who surround me. I cannot shake the feeling that her death was meant to send a message, to unravel the careful life I have constructed.\n\nI think of confronting them again, demanding answers, but fear holds me back. What if I'm wrong? What if it's all in my head, just another spiral of paranoia born from my troubled past? Yet the suspicion lingers, a shadow that refuses to be banished.\n\nI try to lose myself in the art once more, the charcoal smudging my fingers as I draw. The lines are sharp and jagged, capturing the tension that thrums beneath my skin. The apartment emerges on the page, a dark silhouette against a stormy sky, each window a hollow eye watching me.\n\nI hear voices in the hallway again, the low murmur of conversation seeping through the walls. My heart races, my breath coming in shallow gasps as I press my ear to the door. They speak in hushed tones, the words indistinct, but I catch fragments, enough to fuel my fears.\n\n\"\u2014wasn't supposed to happen\u2014\"\n\n\"\u2014she knows\u2014\"\n\nI pull away, my heart pounding in my chest. They're talking about me, I'm sure of it. They know I'm close to uncovering their secret, and they won't stop until they've silenced me, too.\n\nBut I won't let them. I refuse to be a victim, to be another tragic story whispered about in the hallways. I will find the truth, no matter the cost.\n\nI arm myself with resolve, my heart hardened against the fear. I confront them, these neighbors who wear their smiles like masks. \"I know what you're hiding,\" I say, my voice steady and strong. \"And I won't stop until I find out why.\"\n\nThey look at me, their expressions unreadable, but I see the flicker of surprise, the crack in their facade. \"Romi, please,\" one of them begins, but I cut them off, my words a sharp blade.\n\n\"No more lies. No more secrets. I deserve to know the truth.\"\n\nThe confrontation hangs in the air, heavy with tension. They exchange glances, a silent conversation passing between them. And then, finally, they speak.\n\n\"It wasn't supposed to happen this way,\" one of them admits, their voice a whisper of regret. \"We didn't mean for anyone to get hurt.\"\n\nI listen, my heart a tumult of emotions as they unravel their story, a web of deceit spun from desperation and fear. It wasn't meant to shatter my life, they insist, but the damage is done, and the scars remain.\n\nI walk away, the truth a bitter taste in my mouth. The shadows still linger, the whispers still haunt me, but I've found a measure of peace in the chaos. The apartment is mine again, not a prison, but a place of healing.\n\nI sit at my desk, the journal open before me, and I write. The ink flows freely now, no longer stained with questions and shadows, but with hope and resilience. The truth has found me, and though it is not what I expected, it is enough.\n\nIn this new chapter of my life, the ink is no longer stained with fear. The shadows are still there, but they no longer hold the power they once did. And as I write, I know that I will find my way through the darkness, one word at a time.",
