# Human Annotation 

Annotation File Path: ```annotation_data/```

There are three durectories each named after a user on Reddit.
Each directory contains the following files:
1. ```*.txt``` corresponding to particular stories written by the user
2. ```annotation_sheet.csv``` - containing the claims for annotation
    * Annotate each claim based on its respective story on two aspects - coherence (is the claim a meaningful sentence by itself?), consistency (can the claim be inferred from the story?)

Annotation for both ```coherence``` and ```consistency``` is done on a Likert scale of 1-5 where 1 represents the least score and 5 the highest.
