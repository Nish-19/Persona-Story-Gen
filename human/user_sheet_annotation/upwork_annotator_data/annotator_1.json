        "writing_prompt": "After weeks of enduring Umbridge's cruel detentions, Harry's hand refuses to heal, and Snape unexpectedly takes notice. What happens when the professor's sharp tongue is paired with an uncharacteristic act of care?",
        "story": "In the stillness and silence of Umbridge's office, Harry sat writing his lines. All that could be heard was the scratching of the Quill and the occasional meowing of Umbridge's cat portraits. Harry almost felt like he was in a dream, about to wake up soon.\nAlmost. The pain in his hand stopped him from falling into the dreamlike state completely. A pity, as perhaps the time would pass faster.\n\u201cThat will do.\u201d\nHarry dropped the quill with a silent sigh of relief, resisting the urge to clutch his injured hand. Umbridge held out her hand for her usual inspection, and Harry offered it, eager to be done. His bed in the dorm was like a siren, calling him to fall into the nothingness it brought.\n\u201cSame time tomorrow,\u201d Umbridge said, and Harry had a sudden urge to punch the smile off her face permanently. Almost as If she could hear his thoughts, her smile widened. \u201cAfter all, it hasn't sunk in just yet, has it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Professor.\u201d\nFinally, his hand was released, and Harry grabbed his bag and dragged himself out of the office and to Gryffindor Tower.\n\u201cThere you are! She kept you for much longer than usual, didn't she?\u201d\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Harry said tiredly, dropping into a chair in front of the fire. The usual bowl of dittany sat on the table, and Harry soaked his hand gratefully. Hermione watched anxiously.\n\u201cIt's still not healing properly.\u201d\n\u201cBetter than nothing,\u201d Ron said. \u201cYou can't risk Snape again, Hermione.\u201d\n\u201cAgain?\u201d\nHermione turned pink. \u201cI wanted to see if there was something stronger than dittany in Professor Snape's stores, but\u2014 well, he caught me.\u201d\n\u201cOh no! What happened?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, actually. He told me that the only reason Dittany wouldn't be working was if something was preventing it, and\n\u2018I'd better not hear you have been using Dark Magic, Granger.\u2019\n\u201d\n\u201cNo detention?\u201d Harry asked disbelievingly.\nHermione shrugged. \u201cI still don't understand what is wrong with dittany. We know the quill is not the problem as it was healing before. Why isn't it now?\u201d\n\u201cIt works enough,\u201d Harry mumbled, eyes closed. \u201cEnough for me to be able to\u2026\u201d\nHe was asleep before he finished the sentence.\nWhen Harry woke up, the bowl of dittany had fallen to the floor and there was an awful crick in his neck. His hand was throbbing dully and he lifted it up to look at it with bleary eyes.\nThe words were swollen and disfigured, and Harry could only make them out because he knew what it said. Harry touched it slightly and hissed at the burn, dropping his hand. Firmly pushing it out of his mind, he picked up the bag that he'd dropped the night before and settled down to do his homework. He doubted he would manage to finish even one essay, but he couldn't bring himself to care.\nHe changed his mind later that morning as he looked up at Snape's angry eyes.\n\u201cDetention, Potter. After dinner.\u201d\n\u201cCan't,\u201d Harry said. \u201cGot detention with Umbridge.\u201d\nSnape's lips thinned. \u201cAfter, then. Or is that too late for Mr. Celebrity?\u201d\nHarry could have argued that he did need to sleep, but he just didn't have the energy. Instead, he just nodded and started on his potion, ignoring Hermione's furious inquiries.\nAfter dinner found Harry back in Umbridge's office. It had been two hours, and Harry was dreading the long detention still ahead of him when Umbridge spoke.\n\u201cThat will do.\u201d\nHarry looked up in surprise. Umbridge had a sour look on her face that reminded him of Aunt Petunia.\n\u201cProfessor Snape could not find any other time for your detention, but you\nwill\nmake it up to me, Mr. Potter.\u201d\nHarry squashed down his disgust. \u201cOf course, Professor.\u201d\nHardly believing his luck, Harry started the long trek to the dungeons. Why did Snape's office have to be so far away?\nFinally, Snape's door appeared, and Harry lifted a heavy hand to knock on it.\n\u201cCome in!\u201d\nHarry pushed the door open with considerable effort.\n\u201cYou are late, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cJust back from detention,\u201d Harry said, too tired to glare. There were a few dozen cauldrons stacked in the corner, and Harry headed for them, before Snape's voice stopped him in his tracks.\n\u201cDid I say you were to do cauldrons?\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry turned to Snape. \u201cWhat am I going to do then?\u201d\n\u201cLines.\u201d Snape smiled cruelly.\nHarry stared. Since when did Snape have him do lines?\n\u201cWell?\u201d Snape snapped. \u201cGet on with it.\u201d\nFeeling like he was dreaming again, Harry sat down on the chair. Thankfully, the quill besides the parchment was a regular quill.\n\u201cWhat should I write?\u201d\n\u201cWhat should I write, Sir?\u201d\n\u201cI must do my homework on time.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Harry bent down to begin his lines, but he could still feel Snape\u2019s eyes on him.\n\u201cWhat is wrong with your hand, Potter?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry asked, confused. \u201cNothing.\u201d\nHe put the quill down and held up his hand for emphasis.\nSnape's brow furrowed. \u201cDo you think me a fool? Other hand.\u201d\nHarry reluctantly opened the left hand towards Snape, palm up. Snape yanked at it and turned it over, and Harry winced.\nIt looked even worse than it had in the morning. The whole area was bright red so that the harsh words couldn't be seen anymore, and bright yellow splotches were visible.\n\u201cHave you tried dittany?\u201d\nHarry looked back at Snape\u2019s sharp voice. He looked even angrier than normal, which was saying something.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry shrugged. It worked in the beginning, but slowly it just\u2014 stopped.\u201d\n\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d Snape asked, summoning a jar. Harry caught sight of the label as it flew into Snape's hand \u2014\nAntibacterial Aloe Cream.\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Harry said. \u201cA month, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cAre you feeling cold? Or feverish?\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry muttered, looking at Snape's desk. He felt exposed, and if his hand hadn't been so tightly held by Snape, he might have run off.\nFinally, Snape released his hand and drew his wand. Harry tensed.\n\u201cA diagnostic Charm.\u201d\nSnape waved his wand and Harry felt a warmth spread through him, which left as quickly as it had come.\n\u201cHow shocking. You have an infection.

She kept you for much longer than usual, didn't she?\u201d\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Harry said tiredly, dropping into a chair in front of the fire. The usual bowl of dittany sat on the table, and Harry soaked his hand gratefully.

What happened?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, actually. He told me that the only reason Dittany wouldn't be working was if something was preventing it, and\n\u2018I'd better not hear you have been using Dark Magic, Granger.\u2019\n\u201d\n\u201cNo detention?\u201d Harry asked disbelievingly.\nHermione shrugged. \u201cI still don't understand what is wrong with dittany. We know the quill is not the problem as it was healing before. Why isn't it now?\u201d\n\u201cIt works enough,\u201d Harry mumbled, eyes closed. \u201cEnough for me to be able to\u2026\u201d\nHe was asleep before he finished the sentence.\nWhen Harry woke up, the bowl of dittany had fallen to the floor and there was an awful crick in his neck. His hand was throbbing dully and he lifted it up to look at it with bleary eyes.\nThe words were swollen and disfigured, and Harry could only make them out because he knew what it said. Harry touched it slightly and hissed at the burn, dropping his hand. Firmly pushing it out of his mind, he picked up the bag that he'd dropped the night before and settled down to do his homework. He doubted he would manage to finish even one essay, but he couldn't bring himself to care.\nHe changed his mind later that morning as he looked up at Snape's angry eyes.\n\u201cDetention, Potter. After dinner.\u201d\n\u201cCan't,\u201d Harry said. \u201cGot detention with Umbridge.\u201d\nSnape's lips thinned. \u201cAfter, then. Or is that too late for Mr. Celebrity?\u201d\nHarry could have argued that he did need to sleep, but he just didn't have the energy. Instead, he just nodded and started on his potion, ignoring Hermione's furious inquiries.\nAfter dinner found Harry back in Umbridge's office. It had been two hours, and Harry was dreading the long detention still ahead of him when Umbridge spoke.\n\u201cThat will do.\u201d\nHarry looked up in surprise. Umbridge had a sour look on her face that reminded him of Aunt Petunia.\n\u201cProfessor Snape could not find any other time for your detention, but you\nwill\nmake it up to me, Mr. Potter.\u201d\nHarry squashed down his disgust. \u201cOf course, Professor.\u201d\nHardly believing his luck, Harry started the long trek to the dungeons. Why did Snape's office have to be so far away?\nFinally, Snape's door appeared, and Harry lifted a heavy hand to knock on it.\n\u201cCome in!\u201d\nHarry pushed the door open with considerable effort.\n\u201cYou are late, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cJust back from detention,\u201d Harry said, too tired to glare. There were a few dozen cauldrons stacked in the corner, and Harry headed for them, before Snape's voice stopped him in his tracks.\n\u201cDid I say you were to do cauldrons?\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry turned to Snape. \u201cWhat am I going to do then?\u201d\n\u201cLines.\u201d Snape smiled cruelly.\nHarry stared. Since when did Snape have him do lines?\n\u201cWell?\u201d Snape snapped. \u201cGet on with it.\u201d\nFeeling like he was dreaming again, Harry sat down on the chair. Thankfully, the quill besides the parchment was a regular quill.\n\u201cWhat should I write?\u201d\n\u201cWhat should I write, Sir?\u201d\n\u201cI must do my homework on time.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Harry bent down to begin his lines, but he could still feel Snape\u2019s eyes on him.\n\u201cWhat is wrong with your hand, Potter?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry asked, confused. \u201cNothing.\u201d\nHe put the quill down and held up his hand for emphasis.\nSnape's brow furrowed. \u201cDo you think me a fool? Other hand.\u201d\nHarry reluctantly opened the left hand towards Snape, palm up. Snape yanked at it and turned it over, and Harry winced.\nIt looked even worse than it had in the morning. The whole area was bright red so that the harsh words couldn't be seen anymore, and bright yellow splotches were visible.\n\u201cHave you tried dittany?\u201d\nHarry looked back at Snape\u2019s sharp voice. He looked even angrier than normal, which was saying something.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry shrugged. It worked in the beginning, but slowly it just\u2014 stopped.\u201d\n\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d Snape asked, summoning a jar. Harry caught sight of the label as it flew into Snape's hand \u2014\nAntibacterial Aloe Cream.\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Harry said. \u201cA month, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cAre you feeling cold? Or feverish?\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry muttered, looking at Snape's desk. He felt exposed, and if his hand hadn't been so tightly held by Snape, he might have run off.\nFinally, Snape released his hand and drew his wand. Harry tensed.\n\u201cA diagnostic Charm.\u201d\nSnape waved his wand and Harry felt a warmth spread through him, which left as quickly as it had come.\n\u201cHow shocking. You have an infection. When did you last eat?\u201d\n\u201cDinner,\u201d Harry mumbled.\n\u201cLet me define eating, then. It refers to the act of putting food in your mouth, chewing, and swallowing it.

Other hand.\u201d\nHarry reluctantly opened the left hand towards Snape, palm up. Snape yanked at it and turned it over, and Harry winced.\nIt looked even worse than it had in the morning. The whole area was bright red so that the harsh words couldn't be seen anymore, and bright yellow splotches were visible.\n\u201cHave you tried dittany?\u201d\nHarry looked back at Snape\u2019s sharp voice. He looked even angrier than normal, which was saying something.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry shrugged. It worked in the beginning, but slowly it just\u2014 stopped.\u201d\n\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d Snape asked, summoning a jar. Harry caught sight of the label as it flew into Snape's hand \u2014\nAntibacterial Aloe Cream.\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Harry said. \u201cA month, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cAre you feeling cold? Or feverish?\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry muttered, looking at Snape's desk. He felt exposed, and if his hand hadn't been so tightly held by Snape, he might have run off.\nFinally, Snape released his hand and drew his wand. Harry tensed.\n\u201cA diagnostic Charm.\u201d\nSnape waved his wand and Harry felt a warmth spread through him, which left as quickly as it had come.\n\u201cHow shocking. You have an infection. When did you last eat?\u201d\n\u201cDinner,\u201d Harry mumbled.\n\u201cLet me define eating, then. It refers to the act of putting food in your mouth, chewing, and swallowing it. Keeping that in mind, when did you last eat?\u201d\nHarry shrugged, going red with embarrassment.\nSnape sighed. \u201cYou have detention every day \u2014\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d Harry protested, his anger flaring up. \u201cWhat for?!\u201d\n\u201c\u2014 After dinner,\u201d Snape continued, speaking over him. \u201cYou have been unnaturally disruptive, and this is the only time I can spare out of my busy day to oversee your detentions.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Oh,\u201d Harry said, understanding. \u201cAlright, thanks.\u201d\n\u201cDo not thank me, Potter. The Wizarding World would self-destruct if they were to lose their celebrity. It is entirely self-interest, I assure you.\u201d\nHarry stared. Harry might be feeling hazy, but he was sure Snape had just made a joke.\n\u201cNow,\u201d Snape said, summoning a vial. \u201cA mouthful every morning and evening. Now get to bed, immediately.\u201d\n\u201cThe detention,\u201d Harry protested.\nSnape raised an eyebrow. \u201cDo you want to write lines?\u201d\nHarry blushed. \u201cNot particularly.\u201d\n\u201cThen get out of my sight.\u201d\nHarry stood up and turned to leave.\n\u201cThe vial, Potter.\u201d\nToo embarrassed to look at Snape, Harry snatched the vial and fled.",

        "writing_prompt": "Erin has ventured beyond the forbidden five-mile marker, breaking the commune's rules, but as she surveys an abandoned cabin with a broken window and open door, she hears the sound of hoofbeats behind her\u2014someone from the commune has followed her. Who is it, and what will they do now that they\u2019ve found her?",
        "story": "Huddled in a damp and filthy jacket the lone girl rode slowly in the pre-dawn half light. There was a crispness in the fall air, clean and clear and the cold making each breath a cloud of vapor. Her ratty hood was down despite the warmth it would have provided her against the morning chill and her auburn hair was tied back in a ponytail. The chestnut quarter horse moved at an easy pace under her, following the rutted game trail, careful to pick up its hooves and place them so as to avoid the jutting roots and deadfall beneath the carpet of gold and ochre, red and yellow leaves. Erin sat deep in the saddle but hunched a bit, bow over her shoulder, arrows bundled into a sort of crude quiver made from a leather tool pouch strapped to her leg. Her eyes scanned the shadows along the crest of a low hill where they seemed to gather near the base of the white barked trees. She let her gaze linger on the darkness, confirming its vacancy. Pools of still water riffled black among the brush in the low places. Thin black branches protruded from the water. The edge of the pools fringed with reeds. The tall golden grasses made a hypnotizing sound like a whisper against the horses legs as she ascended the slope and she found her eyes getting heavy. Near the top she let out a short, sharp ho, more grunt than word and shifted her weight in the saddle. Gently she pulled back on the reins though the horse was already stopping. Red dot painted on the trunk of a tree. Nail in the center. A simple, easy to miss marker. Facing opposite the way strangers would come. She sat in the saddle eyeing it. Sniffed. Looked round. All was silent and still. Point of no return, hey Chess. Erin said to the horse and it twitched its ears and knickered as if in response. She rubbed its neck, let her bare hand rest against it a moment. This was the five mile marker. Five miles from home. She wasnt supposed to go past this point. It was forbidden. She wasnt supposed to leave the commune without someone with her either. Was never supposed to go out before dawn or after dusk. None of them were. She patted the horse's neck again. Nudged forward. The horse seemed at first hesitant to resume its earlier pace and instead went on more leisurely. Come on. she urged softly. Another nudge. He picked up the pace. Down the shaded side into the cold, the grasses here damp and high enough to wet her boots. Then up a steep dirt track past the edge of a field of tumbled down and moss-covered rocks. Before the path cut into tree cover she looked out over her right shoulder and could see the lake some miles distant. They called it Silver Lake because the old name had been forgotten and because of the way the shallows shone in the morning light. The sun was on it now, reflecting brilliantly but so near the shoulder of the mountains she rode still in shadow, the sun having not risen high enough yet to reach her. She wanted to stop and take it in longer but she reminded herself she wasnt sight-seeing this time and went on. At the crest of the hill she did stop though. From higher ground it was important to be still and to survey. After a time she dismounted and hitched the horse to a tree. The horses name was Chester; a name given to it by the Bowman's. An animal they had come to own when the trapper John Brannan had decided it was not suited to hunting and passed it along to them. It had ever been wary of the smell of guns and blood and was prone to bolt at the sound of a rifle shot. Taking her bow and arrows she whispered a reassurance to Chester, gave him another rub along his neck and then a pat before she walked out along the ridgeline, eyeing the ground. She watched for animals down in the wooded valley beyond, careful how she stepped, noting the direction of the wind. The hills were criss-crossed with wide cuts between the older, more densely packed forest here. These areas were choked with weeds, low, scraggly brush and stands of thin-trunked saplings. The remains of old ski-runs someone had told her. North of here stood an old place filled with burned out buildings that had once been a great lodge; a place for winter vacations they'd said. No-one went there now. The people that had lived there were all gone now. Nell said they had come to a bad end. The people who had stayed on _after_. Isaac had taken the girls there once, a long time after but the girls had been terrified of the place. There was a sort of superstitious fear of the place even now. Seeing nothing among the trees she crouched and waited. Waited for something like five minutes. Then, at last. _Movement._ Seventy five yards away at the edge of a clearing was movement. Something grey breaking from the dark. She felt her pulse quicken the way it always did. She had the arrow nocked but drew the string now. Raised the bow. Turned her head slightly to exhale, into the breeze not letting the vapor of her breath obscure her vision. It was a bighorn sheep, a ram judging by its wide, curving horns. It had clotted clumps of matted grey and a long white beard, it's alien eyes alert as it nosed the air. Too far away. Too much cover. She would spoil the shot and the noise would scare it off. She tried to remember what Emilie had said about their horns. How much of a curve they were supposed to have to legally hunt them back before the Fall. None of that mattered now of course, but her mind went there. She had always been interested in the way things were even if she sometimes thought Emilie and the others stretched the truth or exaggerated how easy life was by comparison. Erin knew bighorns didnt travel alone and since there was no shot to take, lowered her bow. She watched. There were four more. Tawny and pale. More animals meant more eyes to spot her, more ears to hear her. More noses to sniff her out of the air. With a bow, the best she could hope for was to take one of them. She watched them moving as they followed another trail through the trees up the face of another hill on the far side of the valley. God did she want to take one. That would make all this worth it. A quick run back, going light as she could. Then untying Chester and urging him along the ridge as fast as she dared go in the opposite direction of the big horns. She swung up onto the saddle and took him down a brush-covered defile which hid loose rocks and was more treacherous than she had expected. Chester nearly stumbled once but that was the worst of it and stayed up. Then she urged him back into a trot, angling up the hill back in the direction the sheep were travelling. Slowing as she neared it but riding along the top, trying to guess how far on she should need to ride. How far the animals might have moved. She couldn't be sure if the hill had been enough of a sound break to avoid detection but she doubted she could have gotten around them successfully without being heard. Still. When she judged she had reached roughly the right spot she pulled back on the reins and dropped from the horse's back, this time not tying the animal. Crouching she hurried up the ridge, soft boots quiet in the loamy earth. Skirting around an outcrop of rock she found a cutback and though steep she ascended it efficiently and with little sound. She slowed her breathing as she reached the summit. The bow was held high, string drawn, arrow nocked. She raised up, tried to gain a vantage point to see down the slope to the valley floor. She let out a breath, stopped. Below her on a rocky outcrop. Overgrown with weeds and surrounded by shade trees was an old, abandoned cabin. She recognized it as one of the cabins used by the trapper, though it was empty this time of year. It had once been an outbuilding built to house ski lodge equipment of some kind, or at least that's what Emilie had told her anyway. There was something odd about it though. Something out of place. She could just see the front door and window beside it from here, but the door was open instead of locked and chained closed. Also, the window appeared to have had its glass broken out. And that wasn't all... --- *I want one of you (you should collectively decide who, not just first come first serve) to have your character be out here and catch up to Erin at this point in the story. * *She is out alone, past the five mile marker on a horse that isn't hers.

When she judged she had reached roughly the right spot she pulled back on the reins and dropped from the horse's back, this time not tying the animal. Crouching she hurried up the ridge, soft boots quiet in the loamy earth. Skirting around an outcrop of rock she found a cutback and though steep she ascended it efficiently and with little sound. She slowed her breathing as she reached the summit. The bow was held high, string drawn, arrow nocked. She raised up, tried to gain a vantage point to see down the slope to the valley floor. She let out a breath, stopped. Below her on a rocky outcrop. Overgrown with weeds and surrounded by shade trees was an old, abandoned cabin. She recognized it as one of the cabins used by the trapper, though it was empty this time of year. It had once been an outbuilding built to house ski lodge equipment of some kind, or at least that's what Emilie had told her anyway. There was something odd about it though. Something out of place.

Who is it, and what will they do now that they\u2019ve found her?",
        "story": "Huddled in a damp and filthy jacket the lone girl rode slowly in the pre-dawn half light. There was a crispness in the fall air, clean and clear and the cold making each breath a cloud of vapor. Her ratty hood was down despite the warmth it would have provided her against the morning chill and her auburn hair was tied back in a ponytail. The chestnut quarter horse moved at an easy pace under her, following the rutted game trail, careful to pick up its hooves and place them so as to avoid the jutting roots and deadfall beneath the carpet of gold and ochre, red and yellow leaves. Erin sat deep in the saddle but hunched a bit, bow over her shoulder, arrows bundled into a sort of crude quiver made from a leather tool pouch strapped to her leg. Her eyes scanned the shadows along the crest of a low hill where they seemed to gather near the base of the white barked trees. She let her gaze linger on the darkness, confirming its vacancy. Pools of still water riffled black among the brush in the low places. Thin black branches protruded from the water. The edge of the pools fringed with reeds. The tall golden grasses made a hypnotizing sound like a whisper against the horses legs as she ascended the slope and she found her eyes getting heavy. Near the top she let out a short, sharp ho, more grunt than word and shifted her weight in the saddle. Gently she pulled back on the reins though the horse was already stopping. Red dot painted on the trunk of a tree. Nail in the center. A simple, easy to miss marker. Facing opposite the way strangers would come. She sat in the saddle eyeing it. Sniffed. Looked round. All was silent and still. Point of no return, hey Chess. Erin said to the horse and it twitched its ears and knickered as if in response. She rubbed its neck, let her bare hand rest against it a moment. This was the five mile marker. Five miles from home. She wasnt supposed to go past this point. It was forbidden. She wasnt supposed to leave the commune without someone with her either. Was never supposed to go out before dawn or after dusk. None of them were. She patted the horse's neck again. Nudged forward. The horse seemed at first hesitant to resume its earlier pace and instead went on more leisurely. Come on. she urged softly. Another nudge. He picked up the pace. Down the shaded side into the cold, the grasses here damp and high enough to wet her boots. Then up a steep dirt track past the edge of a field of tumbled down and moss-covered rocks. Before the path cut into tree cover she looked out over her right shoulder and could see the lake some miles distant. They called it Silver Lake because the old name had been forgotten and because of the way the shallows shone in the morning light. The sun was on it now, reflecting brilliantly but so near the shoulder of the mountains she rode still in shadow, the sun having not risen high enough yet to reach her. She wanted to stop and take it in longer but she reminded herself she wasnt sight-seeing this time and went on. At the crest of the hill she did stop though. From higher ground it was important to be still and to survey. After a time she dismounted and hitched the horse to a tree. The horses name was Chester; a name given to it by the Bowman's. An animal they had come to own when the trapper John Brannan had decided it was not suited to hunting and passed it along to them. It had ever been wary of the smell of guns and blood and was prone to bolt at the sound of a rifle shot. Taking her bow and arrows she whispered a reassurance to Chester, gave him another rub along his neck and then a pat before she walked out along the ridgeline, eyeing the ground. She watched for animals down in the wooded valley beyond, careful how she stepped, noting the direction of the wind. The hills were criss-crossed with wide cuts between the older, more densely packed forest here. These areas were choked with weeds, low, scraggly brush and stands of thin-trunked saplings. The remains of old ski-runs someone had told her. North of here stood an old place filled with burned out buildings that had once been a great lodge; a place for winter vacations they'd said. No-one went there now. The people that had lived there were all gone now. Nell said they had come to a bad end. The people who had stayed on _after_. Isaac had taken the girls there once, a long time after but the girls had been terrified of the place. There was a sort of superstitious fear of the place even now. Seeing nothing among the trees she crouched and waited. Waited for something like five minutes. Then, at last. _Movement._ Seventy five yards away at the edge of a clearing was movement. Something grey breaking from the dark. She felt her pulse quicken the way it always did. She had the arrow nocked but drew the string now. Raised the bow. Turned her head slightly to exhale, into the breeze not letting the vapor of her breath obscure her vision. It was a bighorn sheep, a ram judging by its wide, curving horns. It had clotted clumps of matted grey and a long white beard, it's alien eyes alert as it nosed the air. Too far away. Too much cover. She would spoil the shot and the noise would scare it off. She tried to remember what Emilie had said about their horns. How much of a curve they were supposed to have to legally hunt them back before the Fall. None of that mattered now of course, but her mind went there. She had always been interested in the way things were even if she sometimes thought Emilie and the others stretched the truth or exaggerated how easy life was by comparison. Erin knew bighorns didnt travel alone and since there was no shot to take, lowered her bow. She watched. There were four more. Tawny and pale. More animals meant more eyes to spot her, more ears to hear her. More noses to sniff her out of the air. With a bow, the best she could hope for was to take one of them. She watched them moving as they followed another trail through the trees up the face of another hill on the far side of the valley. God did she want to take one. That would make all this worth it. A quick run back, going light as she could. Then untying Chester and urging him along the ridge as fast as she dared go in the opposite direction of the big horns. She swung up onto the saddle and took him down a brush-covered defile which hid loose rocks and was more treacherous than she had expected. Chester nearly stumbled once but that was the worst of it and stayed up. Then she urged him back into a trot, angling up the hill back in the direction the sheep were travelling. Slowing as she neared it but riding along the top, trying to guess how far on she should need to ride. How far the animals might have moved. She couldn't be sure if the hill had been enough of a sound break to avoid detection but she doubted she could have gotten around them successfully without being heard. Still.

        "story": "The schoolmarm is playing poker in the town saloon. The stake is the saloon itself.

The sheriff likes to say that she\u2019s as pure as the spotless lily of the lake, though they have no lake, and there are no lilies in it. No damn lilies. The men cuss a lot\u2014in fact, all the time\u2014but never around the schoolmarm. Cussing doesn\u2019t go together with the schoolmarm.

The bar becomes an altar on Sundays, but there\u2019s no preacher, so the schoolmarm provides temperance lectures from it, which the men are obliged to attend. In their minds, it\u2019s still the old bar, the old saloon, so they carry along hip flasks and beef jerky to ease themselves through the unholy tedium, belching and snorting noisily.\nThe men are also obliged to take spelling and counting lessons on weekdays, using the signs on the saloon walls and the playing cards with numbers on them as their schoolbooks. The men learn that there are two \u201ct\u201ds in \u201cspitting,\u201d for example, and, when they forget or when they ignore the sign\u2019s admonition, they get their heads rapped with a wooden ruler. The schoolmarm also raps their heads for uncouth laughter, bad grammar, cigar smoking in class, and tardiness. This head-rapping hurts, and finally it\u2019s too much for them. They form a jury and condemn the schoolmarm to be hanged for her cruel city ways.\nThe schoolmarm insists that they discuss it first at their weekly meeting of the Deep Thinkers Club. The men associate deep thinking with deep drinking, so they welcome the opportunity. They\u2019ve been missing the old saloon since its unlucky conversion. They gather at their desks, as the schoolmarm calls them, feeling like they\u2019ve come home again.\nThe schoolmarm says that today, her last day, she wants them to think about justice and time, how little there is of either, and also about irony, which somehow relates to the same circumstances. The schoolmarm\u2019s just showing off again, making their brains ache, unrepentant criminal that she is. There is talk of getting on with the hanging, but the men are comfortable where they sit, sucking their teeth contentedly, so no one really wants to get up and go do it.\nThe sheriff, famous for his quick wit, says that time is what he never has enough of, but at least he\u2019s got more than the schoolmarm has. He laughs at his own little joke. The men think about it for a while, and then they laugh, too. The schoolmarm says that that\u2019s what she means by irony, and the sheriff says he\u2019s glad she explained it, because he couldn\u2019t figure out what the dang ironing had to do with anything. Neither could the others. They still can\u2019t, but they hoot and slap their desks just the same. The sheriff\u2019s a pal of theirs.\nOn the subject of justice, the sheriff considers himself something of an expert. He disagrees with the schoolmarm about there being little of it and reminds her that he himself has dealt out a potful. In deference to the schoolmarm, he doesn\u2019t say what sort of pot it was, but the men grunt knowingly. The sheriff then provides a discourse on law and order, which he says are birds of a feather. Blue, he says when someone asks, like a jay\u2019s. One of the men says he thought it was more yellowish, like a chicken hawk\u2019s. The sheriff says it depends on the color of the law that was broken, and at what time of day or night order got criminally disordered. On that subject, he explains to the Deep Thinkers that he prefers order to ordure, though they are more or less the same thing, only because \u201corder\u201d is easier to spell and don\u2019t sound so foreign.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound so foreign,\u201d the schoolmarm corrects.\n\u201cYes\u2019m, that\u2019s what I said,\u201d the sheriff says. \u201cI ain\u2019t completely stupid.\u201d The men applaud the sheriff\u2019s incomplete stupidity.\nThen the schoolmarm delivers a lecture on eternity. It is too long. Many of the men\u2019s heads are now on their desks. The schoolmarm\u2019s lecture cannot be heard over the snoring, so she walks among them, twisting their ears. This wakes up only one at a time, and meanwhile another head falls. It\u2019s a kind of dance of bouncing heads.\nHow to Live Longer, featuring Atul Gawande\nThe sheriff does not want to get his ear twisted, so while the men are dropping off he takes the schoolmarm out to hang her. On the way to the gallows, the sheriff says that sometimes, in shootouts with desperadoes or when wrestling cattle rustlers at the edge of a cliff, he suffers trepidations, and he wonders if the schoolmarm is feeling anything like that now? She isn\u2019t. Her unsentimental tough-mindedness is legendary. Self-pity, she says, is the lowest state to which a person\u2019s mind can fall. Other than lust and gluttony, of course. And indecency.\nWhen the sheriff leads the schoolmarm up onto the gallows, he says, \u201cI know you\u2019re sad about losing your life, ma\u2019am, but you gotta understand\u2014out here, life don\u2019t mean nothing. What only matters is rocks. Rocks and the un-effable, pardon the French.\u201d\n\u201cYour French loses something in the translation,\u201d the schoolmarm says, \u201cbut I suppose when you speak of the ineffable you are speaking of me.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2019m,\u201d the sheriff says. \u201cSure am.\u201d\n\u201cRocks have more to say,\u201d the schoolmarm says. \u201cThey express something profound about this place, this life, as I cannot. Language, even when grammatically correct, is simply inadequate. The situation is, in that sense, unspeakable. A landscape of rocks evokes a time before time, and the end-times as well, forcing us, while contemplating it, to live in all time at once, where words have nothing to attach themselves to.\u201d\nThe sheriff nods, but he doesn\u2019t know what the heck she\u2019s talking about. He fits the noose around her neck.\n\u201cOnly humans can experience time,\u201d the schoolmarm continues portentously, \u201cso time itself will not exist when life ends, as life inevitably must. Between the beginning of time and the end of it, there\u2019s relatively only an eyeblink, and without life there\u2019s no one to see that eyeblink or remember it. That is what rocks express. Though they are otherwise meaningless, they are, in this respect, the most meaningful thing we have, putting us in touch with oblivion. Which is the ineffablest thing of all.\u201d The schoolmarm smiles, having invented a new expression.\n\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am, ain\u2019t all this just a way of putting off what\u2019s got to happen?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes, sorry.

There is talk of getting on with the hanging, but the men are comfortable where they sit, sucking their teeth contentedly, so no one really wants to get up and go do it.\nThe sheriff, famous for his quick wit, says that time is what he never has enough of, but at least he\u2019s got more than the schoolmarm has. He laughs at his own little joke. The men think about it for a while, and then they laugh, too. The schoolmarm says that that\u2019s what she means by irony, and the sheriff says he\u2019s glad she explained it, because he couldn\u2019t figure out what the dang ironing had to do with anything. Neither could the others. They still can\u2019t, but they hoot and slap their desks just the same. The sheriff\u2019s a pal of theirs.\nOn the subject of justice, the sheriff considers himself something of an expert. He disagrees with the schoolmarm about there being little of it and reminds her that he himself has dealt out a potful. In deference to the schoolmarm, he doesn\u2019t say what sort of pot it was, but the men grunt knowingly. The sheriff then provides a discourse on law and order, which he says are birds of a feather. Blue, he says when someone asks, like a jay\u2019s. One of the men says he thought it was more yellowish, like a chicken hawk\u2019s. The sheriff says it depends on the color of the law that was broken, and at what time of day or night order got criminally disordered. On that subject, he explains to the Deep Thinkers that he prefers order to ordure, though they are more or less the same thing, only because \u201corder\u201d is easier to spell and don\u2019t sound so foreign.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound so foreign,\u201d the schoolmarm corrects.\n\u201cYes\u2019m, that\u2019s what I said,\u201d the sheriff says. \u201cI ain\u2019t completely stupid.\u201d The men applaud the sheriff\u2019s incomplete stupidity.\nThen the schoolmarm delivers a lecture on eternity. It is too long. Many of the men\u2019s heads are now on their desks. The schoolmarm\u2019s lecture cannot be heard over the snoring, so she walks among them, twisting their ears. This wakes up only one at a time, and meanwhile another head falls. It\u2019s a kind of dance of bouncing heads.\nHow to Live Longer, featuring Atul Gawande\nThe sheriff does not want to get his ear twisted, so while the men are dropping off he takes the schoolmarm out to hang her. On the way to the gallows, the sheriff says that sometimes, in shootouts with desperadoes or when wrestling cattle rustlers at the edge of a cliff, he suffers trepidations, and he wonders if the schoolmarm is feeling anything like that now? She isn\u2019t. Her unsentimental tough-mindedness is legendary. Self-pity, she says, is the lowest state to which a person\u2019s mind can fall. Other than lust and gluttony, of course. And indecency.\nWhen the sheriff leads the schoolmarm up onto the gallows, he says, \u201cI know you\u2019re sad about losing your life, ma\u2019am, but you gotta understand\u2014out here, life don\u2019t mean nothing. What only matters is rocks. Rocks and the un-effable, pardon the French.\u201d\n\u201cYour French loses something in the translation,\u201d the schoolmarm says, \u201cbut I suppose when you speak of the ineffable you are speaking of me.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2019m,\u201d the sheriff says. \u201cSure am.\u201d\n\u201cRocks have more to say,\u201d the schoolmarm says. \u201cThey express something profound about this place, this life, as I cannot. Language, even when grammatically correct, is simply inadequate. The situation is, in that sense, unspeakable. A landscape of rocks evokes a time before time, and the end-times as well, forcing us, while contemplating it, to live in all time at once, where words have nothing to attach themselves to.\u201d\nThe sheriff nods, but he doesn\u2019t know what the heck she\u2019s talking about. He fits the noose around her neck.\n\u201cOnly humans can experience time,\u201d the schoolmarm continues portentously, \u201cso time itself will not exist when life ends, as life inevitably must. Between the beginning of time and the end of it, there\u2019s relatively only an eyeblink, and without life there\u2019s no one to see that eyeblink or remember it. That is what rocks express. Though they are otherwise meaningless, they are, in this respect, the most meaningful thing we have, putting us in touch with oblivion. Which is the ineffablest thing of all.\u201d The schoolmarm smiles, having invented a new expression.\n\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am, ain\u2019t all this just a way of putting off what\u2019s got to happen?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes, sorry. I suppose it is. Give me a rock to hold.\u201d \u2666",

Perhaps she felt a strange giddy feeling when he did it, however brief.\n\"Greetings Amy.

She was adamant she wanted to keep every corner clean. Unwilling to be stopped by a simple lock, she entered the room to find rows upon rows of mannequins.\nThey were all so realistic, they seemed to breathe. Like those sci-fi movies, where humans were kept in suspended animation. Held up by long chains. Connected to long tubes that snaked around, except in this castle, the tubes were red.\nYup, the countess really loved red. And black. Typical gothic aesthetics of a rich noble family. Amy had many questions about these mannequins. But she wasn't paid to ask. She was paid to clean.\nSo, her first reaction when she accidentally broke a tube that began spraying red liquid onto the floor was to wipe the floor. The butler Vorg nagged about the waste of a perfectly preserved meal. Probably because the countess forced him to stop eating his dinner to help her out. That's what he said.\nShe likes Vorg. Even if his jokes are really weird and not funny. Like that time he joked about farming humans like cattle. Amy doesn't even see a farm anywhere near the castle grounds. But she appreciated any attempt to lighten the mood while they were working.\nAre rich people and the company they keep always this eccentric?\nTurns out, Countess Elizabeth has even more bizarre friends. Lord Elvari probably takes the cake. Dude claimed to be some kind of tentacle god. A very ancient one that can see a curse hanging over her head. Some spell by a witch who cursed people to think that supernatural entities are just strange humans who really are into this gothic Halloween look.\n\"[I've seen this curse in another woman](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/188r5lk/wp_youre_completely_oblivious_to_the_supernatural/kbntqef/), Amy,\" he spoke in a rather grave tone. \"I can remove the spell if you wish.\"\n\"No offense, my lord, but this is the third time you've said this same joke.

I'm telling you, he's the one under some magic that messed up his sense of humour.\"\n\"Perhaps you mean, sucked him dry of humour?\" The pale lord chuckled.\nAmy laughed at what was probably the first good joke she heard in the castle for a long time.\n\"What brings you here on this day?\" She couldn't resist asking.\nHe flashed her one of those charming smiles. \"I'm here to retrieve some mannequins. Don't tell Elizabeth, okay?\"\n\"Okay.\"\n**\n--\nElizabeth was screaming about the empty storeroom.

Will couldn\u2019t help but start laughing.\n\u201cIt does look like a duck!\u201d\nNico burst out laughing with him.\nIt took a few minutes but eventually they calmed down.\n\u201cOkay, we got the basics.\u201d Will caught his breath.\n\u201cWait but there\u2019s more right?\u201d Nico said. \u201cWhen people make out and stuff. They lick each other.\u201d\n\u201cOh my gods!\u201d Will was both cracking up and blushing hard enough he glowed.\n\u201cWhat? They lick each others\u2019 mouths and stuff.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I guess they lick each other.\u201d Will gasped for air.\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t they bite each other too? Eat each other?\u201d\nWill howled with laughter, rolling onto his side and clutching his stomach. Nico couldn\u2019t help but smile at the sight.\n\u201cWhat? What did I say?\u201d\nWill sat back up, a hand over his mouth to cover his laughter.\n\u201cOne last question, I promise,\u201d Nico implored. \u201cWhat do you do with your eyes?\u201d\n\u201cYou shut them,\u201d Will said. He closed his eyes for demonstration. When he opened them, Nico nodded thoughtfully.\nBefore Will could process it, Nico had shut his eyes, leaned forward and given him a brief but sweet kiss.\n\u201cLike that?\u201d Nico questioned nervously.\nWill\u2019s brain had stopped working. His mouth opened and closed aimlessly and his eyes were as wide as saucers.\n\u201cDid I get it wrong?\u201d\nWill shook his head. \u201cNo... You know, these things take practice.\u201d\nNico raised an eyebrow. \u201cReally? It\u2019s just mushing faces together. I think I did pretty good.\u201d\n\u201cYou did amazing,\u201d Will confirmed. \u201cBut there\u2019s other stuff too.\u201d\nHe shuffled closer, gazing into Nico\u2019s wide eyes. He raised his hands to cup Nico\u2019s face and tuck that bit of loose hair behind his ear.\n\u201cLike this?\u201d Nico lifted his hands to do the same to Will\u2019s face, brown eyes looking over every inch of it.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Will said quietly. \u201cThen you lean in.\u201d\nHe leaned in as he spoke until their lips were a breath away. He couldn\u2019t stop looking at how close they were.\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to close your eyes,\u201d Nico whispered. Will nodded.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nAnd he did.",

Halfway there it started to rain, so Roy ducked under a canopy in front of the entrance to an apartment building. A very tall, sturdily built blond lady wearing a thin black coat came out of the building.

Maybe I\u2019ll go when it stops raining.\u201d\nHe opened the refrigerator and took out a bottle of milk.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the leader of the Amazons called?\u201d Roy asked.\n\u201cA virago,\u201d said Pops.\n\u201cIs that the same as queen?\u201d\n\u201cYou need a king to have a queen, Roy. No, a virago is a termagant.\u201d\n\u201cTermagant?

In a rational world, she wouldn't be speeding around on a motorbike in spandex punching other spandex clad villains as they tried to take over the city. A no-nonsense person, she figured, would be filing their taxes in early March as opposed to fighting crime.\nSecond of all, she tried to have fun on the job. She was riding a motorcycle for goodness sake. Who could say that a motorcycle was the most practical form of transportation! If she weren't fun loving and self indulgent, she would be taking public transport around the city. That would be helping solve the falling ridership issue, and securing funding for public transit might be more critical to the city than punching any villain.\nIn, as far as Intricate understood, she was a fun-loving, nonsense filled hero, just as much as anyone else. Okay, maybe not as much as 'everyone else' but many of them were just plain unprofessional!\nAside from bristling against the no-nonsense label, Intricate had also found that it made her life, marginally harder.

They objectively were,  but they were more frantic than they were when they fought other heroes.\nShe'd seen videos of the famous showdowns, everyone had. The villains talked, they japed, they showed off. Intricate? Intricate got none of that. It was straight to business when she showed up.\nBack at the start, villains had tried talking through their fights, but, it'd literally fallen on deaf ears.\nMaybe that was what made people think she was no-nonsense. She couldn't take fun, after battle, interviews because there were rarely interpreters around after a fight. Logically they ran away once the building-chunks started flying.\nThat no-nonsense label was also why Intricate was sitting on her bed, in her 'Miranda' clothes considering whether she was going to get dressed for the day of crime fighting. She read the news. She understood how brand deals worked.\nShe liked protecting people, loved it even, it filled her with purpose, but at the same time... reading that the city you protect doesn't like you is never a good way to start the morning.\nBut she'd gotten the call, people needed help. So she'd get ready as she always did. One glove at a time, and in the peace and quiet.\n....\nBy the time Intricate reached the scene of the crime, chaos had already ensued, past tense. She was late. Now there were police scattered around the bank using their cruises as shields and keeping an eye on the main door. There was only one way in or out of the central bank. Whoever was in there would have to fight they way out.\nIntricate pulled up to the scene and hopped off her motorcycle. The first thing she caught in the corner of her eyes was someone rolling theirs. She frowned. Allowed herself an extended blink, then moved on. Marching toward the door without knowing what was going on inside.\nPerhaps that was part of her label as well, Intricate's armor was nigh-invincible, and means that she was able to simply walk at most threats. She started up the steps then turned and waved the police officers further back.\nThey didn't move.\nIntricate tried again with, what she feared, was too much enthusiasm. She wanted them to get to safe distance, not to think she was telling them to shoo.\nShe was too far in her head, it was probably fine.\nIntricate entered the bank, tossing the door open and marching into the foyer. In the dead centre of the room was a villain that she didn'tm recognize.\nMost cities had a rogue's gallery of a sort. Sure, they got locked away, but there were only so many powers in a population and keeping them in jail was a pain in the ass. That all to say, it was a rare novelty to see an unknown on a crime scene.\nThe woman, villain, opened her mouth and clearly said something. She was only wearing half a mask so Intricate, in theory, had a chance to read her lips, but she'd never been good at that. A second later, the woman stopped and scanned Intricate.\nShe was never, so Intricate gave her the moment to do so.\nThen another novelty.\n\"Intricate, it's a pleasure.\" the woman signed. Intricate stared for a moment. She knew the words enough to understand them, but was too distracted by what the hell was going on to process them. She only had the common response to this revelation.\n\"You sign?\" Intricate ask.\n\"Obviously.\" the woman retorted. The signs were somewhat hard to read, a mix of rough gestures and the multicolored costume contrasted with her dark skin. Too much extra visual noise.\n\"I'm going to stop you.\" Intricate signed back. She took a deep breath, but instead of moving right into a fight, the woman kept signing.\n\"You're going to stop me? How adorable. Don't you know how long I've planned this heist for?\"\n\"No?\"\n\"Months. Months I've been waiting to come onto the scene and fight you.

You don't need to sit there and listen to a monologue and--\" The villain, Intricate had never asked her name, stopped, she needed her hands for this.\nBut it was too late, Intricate was on top of her.\nThat villain was right, she didn't need to sit there and listen to a monologue, but she was wrong about Intricate.\nShe'd show her she was fun, hit by hit.",

The parchment balanced on your knee was half forgotten, the pot of ink and writing quill sitting on the windowsill as a mere figment, now. A storm must be brewing over the sea, and you wondered if you would experience it before night fell and sleep welcomed you with wide open arms.\nPrince Aemond was many things, on many occasions, for many people. He was calculating, yet\ntempered\n. Unforgiving, attentive.\nImpulsive\n, and intelligent. He was\nwild\n, yet subtlety - veiled or otherwise - had proven to be a quality that he had shown little interest in practicing. It was something he never seemed to regret, even if it meant spiraling petty feuds into further disarray, or simply tugging on fraying threads during family dinners that lead to hurled threats and slamming doors. It was a little cocoon of his own making, this calmly crafted life of controlled chaos.\nYet you were the exception - both you\nand\nHeleana - until, of course, it was only you that remained shielded no longer.\nYou were oblivious, in your daydreams, to the chaos raging fierce and strong in your own home - until the door to your rooms flew open to\ncrack\nsharply on the wall behind.\nAemond didn\u2019t expect to find you here. With the evening promising rain and fury, he assumed you\u2019d be enjoying the fresh air as long as time allowed,\nbut\n. He had come here to breathe, yet the irritation simmering slow and hot and vicious under his skin craved a release of any kind, as it always does.\nRegret\nwas hardly an intimate word for Aemond, yet it lingered, unyielding, clouding his mind once the red melted from his vision and his blackened heart returned to gold.\nThe way he\u2019d allowed his lack of care to send you slamming the door to your apartments as you left him -\nfuming\n, in the wake of your own reciprocated wrath - well. It left him feeling anything other than comfort.\nIt was a whirlwind in the flesh, truly, the tense words he had flung to bite at your heart. Cold, calm fury battered them aside, broke through the weakening shield Aemond held fast around himself in an excuse to project without circumstance. Without consequence. He hadn\u2019t been able to draw blood of course, you knew him too well to know it wasn\u2019t\nyou\nthat had cracked his everlasting dragonskin.\nYou, however, had always been a different story.\nArmed to the teeth with words that would puncture, pierce, cut to bleed and\ntwist\n, when pushed too hard, too far; a cloak of blame had been settled upon your shoulders, and it was not yours to bear. You tore it off with a simple tug, flourished the fabric in such a way that it clung to the Prince himself, the villain in this particular instance, but not a villain at heart.\nAemond was left staring where you had once been; a window that was open, brilliant view of the darkening sky echoing behind you, the sole outlet for the latest qualm that had been one push, one prod, one irrelevant instance too far - because,\nwell\n.\nAs collected as he usually was, there was always\nsomething\nthat would push anyone over the edge.\nRegardless, he had never once abandoned the training grounds to take his ire out on you. He sought only your company after all; a sun, a saint, an equal to temper what always tried to break through the rising tide.\nSeven\nfucking\nhells.\nIt wasn\u2019t a surprise, when he did not follow you through your rooms, or down the glowing hall.\nSconces were being lit as a false twilight fell, the sweet, early arrival of blue hour inspired haste in the servants lighting your way to the library. The shadows were chased away, one by one; yet the shadow that still enveloped your path was not of nature\u2019s doing, nor was it your own.\nWooden doors loomed before you, bracketed by torches bright and warm and welcoming. You had stalked all the way here you realized, swift and mindless in where your feet had been taking you. Anger still burned through your veins, when you pushed the door open with your whole body. Hinges groaned with the sudden movement jarring them awake.\nSilence engulfed you once the door fell shut. Familiarity took you into its arms under the soft light of candles guttering in the fresh stir of air - rarely, did anyone come here at this hour. The knowledge that you wouldn\u2019t be disturbed tempered your fire.\nThe sigh that left your lips was ragged. Shaken.\nHurt\n.\nThis was something new from Aemond - something that made you wonder\nwhat\nin the\nseven hells\njust\nhappened\n.\nYour feet carried you to the nearest window, and the breeze that met your skin was a soft caress tasting of salt and comfort - probably - since that was something you would not be receiving anytime soon, you imagined. Not from the one you wished, at least.\nHe made that\nquite fucking clear\n, actually.\nThe drawl of distant rumbling welcomed you as you journeyed farther into the room, fingers trailing along the old wooden tables in your wake. The emptiness was peaceful, the candlelight warm and soft in stark contrast with the scene you just left to simmer. You went to the windows, drawing them in tight, before the rain could intrude where it did not belong.\nAnger was a fickle thing,\nyou thought, turning a corner. The goal was to become lost in the maze of shelves piled high with long forgotten crumbling volumes. To find a tome that caught your eye in the looming shadows, then settle in with it while you tucked yourself up into one of the few window seats with the raging sea below as your steadfast companion.\nYou\u2019d stay here with your false peace until your eyes drifted closed and your head leaned against rain spattered glass. Unless, of course, you were confident that retracing your steps to venture back wouldn\u2019t reignite what brought you here in the first place. Perhaps then, you would be cooled enough to seek each other\u2019s company, as your heart so longed to do, even now.\nEven so, the distant rumbling grew louder with each page you turned. Rain crackled into the glass as the wind whipped past. The more you read, the pages became even more brown and stiff as they slowly shared with you their age.\nThe storm, once far out of your sight, seemed to be right on top of you now as it unleashed its fury hard and strong and fast as it battered itself again and again and\nagain\nagainst the city below, and punished the castle walls themselves.\nIt was because of this, that every sound coming from within was, of course, as good as silent.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d find you here.\u201d\nHis voice filled what little lull a storm of this magnitude could give. It slid over your skin, soft as silk, slipped in through the little cracks along with the rain and wind and thunder alike.\nPrince Aemond stood in the glow of torchlight, illuminated wholly in the warm caress of flickering flame. He remained some distance from you, mindful of the space you held both for yourself, and, more pressingly - the distance you created when he pushed you oh, so splendidly away earlier that evening.\n\u201cWell,\u201d your eyes slid away from the prince, to instead find the paragraph they had been pulled away from. Your next words were spoken idly, if not with remnants of\nferocity\ncoating them as you resumed reading. \u201cYou\ndo\nknow where I like to hide.\u201d\nAemond shifts his weight - it\u2019s caught out the corner of your eye - and a shadow promptly slips across you to blanket the words on the pages. It was, by design, a darkness you weren\u2019t able to see through, not with the storm outside batting aside the sun\u2019s dying rays with its gray clouds and veils of rain.\nIntentional\n.\n\u201cSo you\nare\nhiding from me.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018\nHide\n\u2019 is not the word I would use.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThe book snapped shut in your hands on a sigh dragged from the weary depths of your heart. They were both, unfortunately, swallowed by another rolling volley of thunder. The timing was so dramatic, so absolutely\nyou\n, that it wasn\u2019t Aemond\u2019s fault when it inspired a harsh roll of his eye.\nHe could be dramatic too, if only to distract you from the way his lips quirked, the flash of a smile threatening to show itself in the darkness, or in the shine of the firelight still kissing fragments of his skin. Aemond knew this wasn\u2019t the time for jokes, yet even he could appreciate the irony of the trap\nhe\nlaid, and, quite gracefully, stepped right into.\nLightning forked through the sky on another crash of thunder, the flash cold in contrast to the warmth of the library. It was jarring, how the harsh, white light exposed everything, always, quickly and quietly before it melted back into the safety of blowing rain and raging waves.\nAnd yet, it was enough. Enough to see the tension weaving its way through Prince Aemond\u2019s jaw, and the set of his shoulders. How he hid his hands behind his back, no doubt clasped and curled in an unbreakable grip. Aemond clearly found no comfort here tonight. He held himself wound tight - even more so, almost, than he did when all the eyes watched him while at court.\nYou, on the other hand, were relaxed, given the circumstances. Lounging comfortably in the window seat while allowing the peace and the stillness to wash over you in the place you felt safest in all of King\u2019s Landing.\nGuilt\n, you realized, still sitting in his shadow.\nThis was what his guilt looked like.\nYou had wondered if Aemond could even feel such a thing.\n\u201cNo,\u201d you answered his question slowly. Let the bite fade from your voice and fall into the storm. Let it melt back into nothing. \u201cI believe I would choose \u2018\nisolate\n\u2019. I assumed neither one of us wanted that conversation to continue while clawing at each other\u2019s throats, as we were.\u201d\nAemond took a breath, inhaled loud and sharp in time with a sheet of rain being pushed against the windowpane. He looked away as you watched him, your feet uncurling from their place on the seat, the volume slipping through your fingers to rest beside you.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d\nYou stepped from the shadows and went to him, still hiding in the safety of the dark. He longed to reach for you, longed to feel your skin, warm from the fire, warm from the peace you always seemed to carve for yourself - but his fingertips were cold from the time he spent solitary in your rooms after you had gone. The fires burned to ashes as he tempered himself, once again, into honed steel that the prince sheathed - if only so he could see you again, without drawing blood once more. Now that he found you, he feared you would find only ice under his touch, instead of comfort.\nIt made his heart\nache\n.\nAnd\nyou\n-\nAemond shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, when he found his fingers threaded through yours. A hand glided up to rest on his jaw, guiding it gently to face you. The fire was gone from your eyes, tension nowhere to be found in your body language. He could see in you, just how much you could read him, even when he said so little. Even when he said everything he didn\u2019t mean.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d you took a step backwards toward the entrance, tugging on his hand as you did so. The corners of your lips quirked, the prelude of a small smile illuminating the shadows Aemond still hid in. \u201cLet\u2019s go brew some tea and\u2026maybe we can talk.\u201d\nHis head dips in agreement, oddly silent since he last spoke. It was almost as if\u2026as if he wasn\u2019t sure the words that wanted to spill out would be the right ones.\nKind\nones. Instead, his chilled fingers finally curled gently around your own.\nAll he can bring himself to say is, \u201cLead on, darling.\u201d\nSo you do, leading him through gloomy shadows deepened by the storm, to hallways illuminated by torches, by lightning, by\nyou\n.",

The more you read, the pages became even more brown and stiff as they slowly shared with you their age.\nThe storm, once far out of your sight, seemed to be right on top of you now as it unleashed its fury hard and strong and fast as it battered itself again and again and\nagain\nagainst the city below, and punished the castle walls themselves.\nIt was because of this, that every sound coming from within was, of course, as good as silent.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d find you here.\u201d\nHis voice filled what little lull a storm of this magnitude could give. It slid over your skin, soft as silk, slipped in through the little cracks along with the rain and wind and thunder alike.\nPrince Aemond stood in the glow of torchlight, illuminated wholly in the warm caress of flickering flame. He remained some distance from you, mindful of the space you held both for yourself, and, more pressingly - the distance you created when he pushed you oh, so splendidly away earlier that evening.\n\u201cWell,\u201d your eyes slid away from the prince, to instead find the paragraph they had been pulled away from. Your next words were spoken idly, if not with remnants of\nferocity\ncoating them as you resumed reading. \u201cYou\ndo\nknow where I like to hide.\u201d\nAemond shifts his weight - it\u2019s caught out the corner of your eye - and a shadow promptly slips across you to blanket the words on the pages. It was, by design, a darkness you weren\u2019t able to see through, not with the storm outside batting aside the sun\u2019s dying rays with its gray clouds and veils of rain.\nIntentional\n.\n\u201cSo you\nare\nhiding from me.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018\nHide\n\u2019 is not the word I would use.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThe book snapped shut in your hands on a sigh dragged from the weary depths of your heart. They were both, unfortunately, swallowed by another rolling volley of thunder. The timing was so dramatic, so absolutely\nyou\n, that it wasn\u2019t Aemond\u2019s fault when it inspired a harsh roll of his eye.\nHe could be dramatic too, if only to distract you from the way his lips quirked, the flash of a smile threatening to show itself in the darkness, or in the shine of the firelight still kissing fragments of his skin. Aemond knew this wasn\u2019t the time for jokes, yet even he could appreciate the irony of the trap\nhe\nlaid, and, quite gracefully, stepped right into.\nLightning forked through the sky on another crash of thunder, the flash cold in contrast to the warmth of the library. It was jarring, how the harsh, white light exposed everything, always, quickly and quietly before it melted back into the safety of blowing rain and raging waves.\nAnd yet, it was enough. Enough to see the tension weaving its way through Prince Aemond\u2019s jaw, and the set of his shoulders. How he hid his hands behind his back, no doubt clasped and curled in an unbreakable grip. Aemond clearly found no comfort here tonight. He held himself wound tight - even more so, almost, than he did when all the eyes watched him while at court.\nYou, on the other hand, were relaxed, given the circumstances. Lounging comfortably in the window seat while allowing the peace and the stillness to wash over you in the place you felt safest in all of King\u2019s Landing.\nGuilt\n, you realized, still sitting in his shadow.\nThis was what his guilt looked like.\nYou had wondered if Aemond could even feel such a thing.\n\u201cNo,\u201d you answered his question slowly. Let the bite fade from your voice and fall into the storm. Let it melt back into nothing. \u201cI believe I would choose \u2018\nisolate\n\u2019. I assumed neither one of us wanted that conversation to continue while clawing at each other\u2019s throats, as we were.\u201d\nAemond took a breath, inhaled loud and sharp in time with a sheet of rain being pushed against the windowpane. He looked away as you watched him, your feet uncurling from their place on the seat, the volume slipping through your fingers to rest beside you.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d\nYou stepped from the shadows and went to him, still hiding in the safety of the dark. He longed to reach for you, longed to feel your skin, warm from the fire, warm from the peace you always seemed to carve for yourself - but his fingertips were cold from the time he spent solitary in your rooms after you had gone. The fires burned to ashes as he tempered himself, once again, into honed steel that the prince sheathed - if only so he could see you again, without drawing blood once more. Now that he found you, he feared you would find only ice under his touch, instead of comfort.\nIt made his heart\nache\n.\nAnd\nyou\n-\nAemond shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, when he found his fingers threaded through yours. A hand glided up to rest on his jaw, guiding it gently to face you. The fire was gone from your eyes, tension nowhere to be found in your body language. He could see in you, just how much you could read him, even when he said so little. Even when he said everything he didn\u2019t mean.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d you took a step backwards toward the entrance, tugging on his hand as you did so. The corners of your lips quirked, the prelude of a small smile illuminating the shadows Aemond still hid in. \u201cLet\u2019s go brew some tea and\u2026maybe we can talk.\u201d\nHis head dips in agreement, oddly silent since he last spoke. It was almost as if\u2026as if he wasn\u2019t sure the words that wanted to spill out would be the right ones.\nKind\nones. Instead, his chilled fingers finally curled gently around your own.\nAll he can bring himself to say is, \u201cLead on, darling.\u201d\nSo you do, leading him through gloomy shadows deepened by the storm, to hallways illuminated by torches, by lightning, by\nyou\n.",

        "story": "The afternoon air was thick with tension and dripping destruction, though you seemed to be none the wiser. So swept up were you, in the beauty of deep blue skies and the path of charcoal gray clouds as they passed by on the warm wind. The parchment balanced on your knee was half forgotten, the pot of ink and writing quill sitting on the windowsill as a mere figment, now. A storm must be brewing over the sea, and you wondered if you would experience it before night fell and sleep welcomed you with wide open arms.\nPrince Aemond was many things, on many occasions, for many people. He was calculating, yet\ntempered\n. Unforgiving, attentive.\nImpulsive\n, and intelligent. He was\nwild\n, yet subtlety - veiled or otherwise - had proven to be a quality that he had shown little interest in practicing. It was something he never seemed to regret, even if it meant spiraling petty feuds into further disarray, or simply tugging on fraying threads during family dinners that lead to hurled threats and slamming doors. It was a little cocoon of his own making, this calmly crafted life of controlled chaos.\nYet you were the exception - both you\nand\nHeleana - until, of course, it was only you that remained shielded no longer.\nYou were oblivious, in your daydreams, to the chaos raging fierce and strong in your own home - until the door to your rooms flew open to\ncrack\nsharply on the wall behind.\nAemond didn\u2019t expect to find you here. With the evening promising rain and fury, he assumed you\u2019d be enjoying the fresh air as long as time allowed,\nbut\n. He had come here to breathe, yet the irritation simmering slow and hot and vicious under his skin craved a release of any kind, as it always does.\nRegret\nwas hardly an intimate word for Aemond, yet it lingered, unyielding, clouding his mind once the red melted from his vision and his blackened heart returned to gold.\nThe way he\u2019d allowed his lack of care to send you slamming the door to your apartments as you left him -\nfuming\n, in the wake of your own reciprocated wrath - well. It left him feeling anything other than comfort.\nIt was a whirlwind in the flesh, truly, the tense words he had flung to bite at your heart. Cold, calm fury battered them aside, broke through the weakening shield Aemond held fast around himself in an excuse to project without circumstance. Without consequence. He hadn\u2019t been able to draw blood of course, you knew him too well to know it wasn\u2019t\nyou\nthat had cracked his everlasting dragonskin.\nYou, however, had always been a different story.\nArmed to the teeth with words that would puncture, pierce, cut to bleed and\ntwist\n, when pushed too hard, too far; a cloak of blame had been settled upon your shoulders, and it was not yours to bear. You tore it off with a simple tug, flourished the fabric in such a way that it clung to the Prince himself, the villain in this particular instance, but not a villain at heart.\nAemond was left staring where you had once been; a window that was open, brilliant view of the darkening sky echoing behind you, the sole outlet for the latest qualm that had been one push, one prod, one irrelevant instance too far - because,\nwell\n.\nAs collected as he usually was, there was always\nsomething\nthat would push anyone over the edge.\nRegardless, he had never once abandoned the training grounds to take his ire out on you. He sought only your company after all; a sun, a saint, an equal to temper what always tried to break through the rising tide.\nSeven\nfucking\nhells.\nIt wasn\u2019t a surprise, when he did not follow you through your rooms, or down the glowing hall.\nSconces were being lit as a false twilight fell, the sweet, early arrival of blue hour inspired haste in the servants lighting your way to the library. The shadows were chased away, one by one; yet the shadow that still enveloped your path was not of nature\u2019s doing, nor was it your own.\nWooden doors loomed before you, bracketed by torches bright and warm and welcoming. You had stalked all the way here you realized, swift and mindless in where your feet had been taking you. Anger still burned through your veins, when you pushed the door open with your whole body. Hinges groaned with the sudden movement jarring them awake.\nSilence engulfed you once the door fell shut. Familiarity took you into its arms under the soft light of candles guttering in the fresh stir of air - rarely, did anyone come here at this hour. The knowledge that you wouldn\u2019t be disturbed tempered your fire.\nThe sigh that left your lips was ragged. Shaken.\nHurt\n.\nThis was something new from Aemond - something that made you wonder\nwhat\nin the\nseven hells\njust\nhappened\n.\nYour feet carried you to the nearest window, and the breeze that met your skin was a soft caress tasting of salt and comfort - probably - since that was something you would not be receiving anytime soon, you imagined. Not from the one you wished, at least.\nHe made that\nquite fucking clear\n, actually.\nThe drawl of distant rumbling welcomed you as you journeyed farther into the room, fingers trailing along the old wooden tables in your wake. The emptiness was peaceful, the candlelight warm and soft in stark contrast with the scene you just left to simmer. You went to the windows, drawing them in tight, before the rain could intrude where it did not belong.\nAnger was a fickle thing,\nyou thought, turning a corner. The goal was to become lost in the maze of shelves piled high with long forgotten crumbling volumes. To find a tome that caught your eye in the looming shadows, then settle in with it while you tucked yourself up into one of the few window seats with the raging sea below as your steadfast companion.\nYou\u2019d stay here with your false peace until your eyes drifted closed and your head leaned against rain spattered glass. Unless, of course, you were confident that retracing your steps to venture back wouldn\u2019t reignite what brought you here in the first place. Perhaps then, you would be cooled enough to seek each other\u2019s company, as your heart so longed to do, even now.\nEven so, the distant rumbling grew louder with each page you turned. Rain crackled into the glass as the wind whipped past.

A hand glided up to rest on his jaw, guiding it gently to face you. The fire was gone from your eyes, tension nowhere to be found in your body language. He could see in you, just how much you could read him, even when he said so little. Even when he said everything he didn\u2019t mean.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d you took a step backwards toward the entrance, tugging on his hand as you did so. The corners of your lips quirked, the prelude of a small smile illuminating the shadows Aemond still hid in. \u201cLet\u2019s go brew some tea and\u2026maybe we can talk.\u201d\nHis head dips in agreement, oddly silent since he last spoke. It was almost as if\u2026as if he wasn\u2019t sure the words that wanted to spill out would be the right ones.\nKind\nones. Instead, his chilled fingers finally curled gently around your own.\nAll he can bring himself to say is, \u201cLead on, darling.\u201d\nSo you do, leading him through gloomy shadows deepened by the storm, to hallways illuminated by torches, by lightning, by\nyou\n.",

        "writing_prompt": "A storm rages outside, but the true tempest brews within the castle walls as Prince Aemond seeks you out, guilt and tension heavy in the air after a heated argument. Will the storm outside mirror the one between you, or will the calm finally break through?",
        "story": "The afternoon air was thick with tension and dripping destruction, though you seemed to be none the wiser. So swept up were you, in the beauty of deep blue skies and the path of charcoal gray clouds as they passed by on the warm wind. The parchment balanced on your knee was half forgotten, the pot of ink and writing quill sitting on the windowsill as a mere figment, now. A storm must be brewing over the sea, and you wondered if you would experience it before night fell and sleep welcomed you with wide open arms.\nPrince Aemond was many things, on many occasions, for many people. He was calculating, yet\ntempered\n. Unforgiving, attentive.\nImpulsive\n, and intelligent. He was\nwild\n, yet subtlety - veiled or otherwise - had proven to be a quality that he had shown little interest in practicing. It was something he never seemed to regret, even if it meant spiraling petty feuds into further disarray, or simply tugging on fraying threads during family dinners that lead to hurled threats and slamming doors. It was a little cocoon of his own making, this calmly crafted life of controlled chaos.\nYet you were the exception - both you\nand\nHeleana - until, of course, it was only you that remained shielded no longer.\nYou were oblivious, in your daydreams, to the chaos raging fierce and strong in your own home - until the door to your rooms flew open to\ncrack\nsharply on the wall behind.\nAemond didn\u2019t expect to find you here. With the evening promising rain and fury, he assumed you\u2019d be enjoying the fresh air as long as time allowed,\nbut\n. He had come here to breathe, yet the irritation simmering slow and hot and vicious under his skin craved a release of any kind, as it always does.\nRegret\nwas hardly an intimate word for Aemond, yet it lingered, unyielding, clouding his mind once the red melted from his vision and his blackened heart returned to gold.\nThe way he\u2019d allowed his lack of care to send you slamming the door to your apartments as you left him -\nfuming\n, in the wake of your own reciprocated wrath - well. It left him feeling anything other than comfort.\nIt was a whirlwind in the flesh, truly, the tense words he had flung to bite at your heart. Cold, calm fury battered them aside, broke through the weakening shield Aemond held fast around himself in an excuse to project without circumstance. Without consequence. He hadn\u2019t been able to draw blood of course, you knew him too well to know it wasn\u2019t\nyou\nthat had cracked his everlasting dragonskin.\nYou, however, had always been a different story.\nArmed to the teeth with words that would puncture, pierce, cut to bleed and\ntwist\n, when pushed too hard, too far; a cloak of blame had been settled upon your shoulders, and it was not yours to bear. You tore it off with a simple tug, flourished the fabric in such a way that it clung to the Prince himself, the villain in this particular instance, but not a villain at heart.\nAemond was left staring where you had once been; a window that was open, brilliant view of the darkening sky echoing behind you, the sole outlet for the latest qualm that had been one push, one prod, one irrelevant instance too far - because,\nwell\n.\nAs collected as he usually was, there was always\nsomething\nthat would push anyone over the edge.\nRegardless, he had never once abandoned the training grounds to take his ire out on you. He sought only your company after all; a sun, a saint, an equal to temper what always tried to break through the rising tide.\nSeven\nfucking\nhells.\nIt wasn\u2019t a surprise, when he did not follow you through your rooms, or down the glowing hall.\nSconces were being lit as a false twilight fell, the sweet, early arrival of blue hour inspired haste in the servants lighting your way to the library. The shadows were chased away, one by one; yet the shadow that still enveloped your path was not of nature\u2019s doing, nor was it your own.\nWooden doors loomed before you, bracketed by torches bright and warm and welcoming. You had stalked all the way here you realized, swift and mindless in where your feet had been taking you. Anger still burned through your veins, when you pushed the door open with your whole body. Hinges groaned with the sudden movement jarring them awake.\nSilence engulfed you once the door fell shut. Familiarity took you into its arms under the soft light of candles guttering in the fresh stir of air - rarely, did anyone come here at this hour. The knowledge that you wouldn\u2019t be disturbed tempered your fire.\nThe sigh that left your lips was ragged. Shaken.\nHurt\n.\nThis was something new from Aemond - something that made you wonder\nwhat\nin the\nseven hells\njust\nhappened\n.\nYour feet carried you to the nearest window, and the breeze that met your skin was a soft caress tasting of salt and comfort - probably - since that was something you would not be receiving anytime soon, you imagined. Not from the one you wished, at least.\nHe made that\nquite fucking clear\n, actually.\nThe drawl of distant rumbling welcomed you as you journeyed farther into the room, fingers trailing along the old wooden tables in your wake. The emptiness was peaceful, the candlelight warm and soft in stark contrast with the scene you just left to simmer. You went to the windows, drawing them in tight, before the rain could intrude where it did not belong.\nAnger was a fickle thing,\nyou thought, turning a corner. The goal was to become lost in the maze of shelves piled high with long forgotten crumbling volumes. To find a tome that caught your eye in the looming shadows, then settle in with it while you tucked yourself up into one of the few window seats with the raging sea below as your steadfast companion.\nYou\u2019d stay here with your false peace until your eyes drifted closed and your head leaned against rain spattered glass. Unless, of course, you were confident that retracing your steps to venture back wouldn\u2019t reignite what brought you here in the first place. Perhaps then, you would be cooled enough to seek each other\u2019s company, as your heart so longed to do, even now.\nEven so, the distant rumbling grew louder with each page you turned. Rain crackled into the glass as the wind whipped past. The more you read, the pages became even more brown and stiff as they slowly shared with you their age.\nThe storm, once far out of your sight, seemed to be right on top of you now as it unleashed its fury hard and strong and fast as it battered itself again and again and\nagain\nagainst the city below, and punished the castle walls themselves.\nIt was because of this, that every sound coming from within was, of course, as good as silent.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d find you here.\u201d\nHis voice filled what little lull a storm of this magnitude could give. It slid over your skin, soft as silk, slipped in through the little cracks along with the rain and wind and thunder alike.\nPrince Aemond stood in the glow of torchlight, illuminated wholly in the warm caress of flickering flame. He remained some distance from you, mindful of the space you held both for yourself, and, more pressingly - the distance you created when he pushed you oh, so splendidly away earlier that evening.\n\u201cWell,\u201d your eyes slid away from the prince, to instead find the paragraph they had been pulled away from. Your next words were spoken idly, if not with remnants of\nferocity\ncoating them as you resumed reading. \u201cYou\ndo\nknow where I like to hide.\u201d\nAemond shifts his weight - it\u2019s caught out the corner of your eye - and a shadow promptly slips across you to blanket the words on the pages. It was, by design, a darkness you weren\u2019t able to see through, not with the storm outside batting aside the sun\u2019s dying rays with its gray clouds and veils of rain.\nIntentional\n.\n\u201cSo you\nare\nhiding from me.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018\nHide\n\u2019 is not the word I would use.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThe book snapped shut in your hands on a sigh dragged from the weary depths of your heart. They were both, unfortunately, swallowed by another rolling volley of thunder. The timing was so dramatic, so absolutely\nyou\n, that it wasn\u2019t Aemond\u2019s fault when it inspired a harsh roll of his eye.\nHe could be dramatic too, if only to distract you from the way his lips quirked, the flash of a smile threatening to show itself in the darkness, or in the shine of the firelight still kissing fragments of his skin. Aemond knew this wasn\u2019t the time for jokes, yet even he could appreciate the irony of the trap\nhe\nlaid, and, quite gracefully, stepped right into.\nLightning forked through the sky on another crash of thunder, the flash cold in contrast to the warmth of the library. It was jarring, how the harsh, white light exposed everything, always, quickly and quietly before it melted back into the safety of blowing rain and raging waves.\nAnd yet, it was enough. Enough to see the tension weaving its way through Prince Aemond\u2019s jaw, and the set of his shoulders. How he hid his hands behind his back, no doubt clasped and curled in an unbreakable grip. Aemond clearly found no comfort here tonight. He held himself wound tight - even more so, almost, than he did when all the eyes watched him while at court.\nYou, on the other hand, were relaxed, given the circumstances. Lounging comfortably in the window seat while allowing the peace and the stillness to wash over you in the place you felt safest in all of King\u2019s Landing.\nGuilt\n, you realized, still sitting in his shadow.\nThis was what his guilt looked like.\nYou had wondered if Aemond could even feel such a thing.\n\u201cNo,\u201d you answered his question slowly. Let the bite fade from your voice and fall into the storm. Let it melt back into nothing. \u201cI believe I would choose \u2018\nisolate\n\u2019. I assumed neither one of us wanted that conversation to continue while clawing at each other\u2019s throats, as we were.\u201d\nAemond took a breath, inhaled loud and sharp in time with a sheet of rain being pushed against the windowpane. He looked away as you watched him, your feet uncurling from their place on the seat, the volume slipping through your fingers to rest beside you.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d\nYou stepped from the shadows and went to him, still hiding in the safety of the dark. He longed to reach for you, longed to feel your skin, warm from the fire, warm from the peace you always seemed to carve for yourself - but his fingertips were cold from the time he spent solitary in your rooms after you had gone. The fires burned to ashes as he tempered himself, once again, into honed steel that the prince sheathed - if only so he could see you again, without drawing blood once more. Now that he found you, he feared you would find only ice under his touch, instead of comfort.\nIt made his heart\nache\n.\nAnd\nyou\n-\nAemond shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, when he found his fingers threaded through yours. A hand glided up to rest on his jaw, guiding it gently to face you. The fire was gone from your eyes, tension nowhere to be found in your body language. He could see in you, just how much you could read him, even when he said so little. Even when he said everything he didn\u2019t mean.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d you took a step backwards toward the entrance, tugging on his hand as you did so. The corners of your lips quirked, the prelude of a small smile illuminating the shadows Aemond still hid in. \u201cLet\u2019s go brew some tea and\u2026maybe we can talk.\u201d\nHis head dips in agreement, oddly silent since he last spoke.

Unfortunately for the beggar, I saw that.\nHe was as dead as he was smiling, a moment earlier. Dad knew it was a trap. Of course, I knew it too - but that would distract the others.\nFor this was not our route. Our was a secret one, away from prying eyes. One that only we knew, deep down in the forest, for those who still knew which animals to greet, and which to avoid.\nOne full of traps that only the trained eye could see. Our trained eyes.\nSo we marched, without resting, to a new tomorrow, hearing the cries of whatever humanity became dying around us, victim of us, victim of themselves, succumbed to fear.\nWe still marched, for another centuries of exile. We marched, to hide, so that one day, humanity could flourish again - from tradition, farming, brass, and gunpowder.",

Thanks to a friend, Dr Curtis Connor, whom he had met because he was connected to his father, Richard Parker, Peter had recently gotten a job under Dr Otto Octavius, one of the greatest scientific minds of the 21st century. The man was a genius in what seemed every single field of science.\nIt was not long before Peter was overawed; he had always prided himself on his own knowledge, but that mostly came because he wasn't entirely sure why his parents had left him years ago, but he was positive that they had left because he was not good enough, and so he had worked hard, studied hard, and sacrificed so much just to be the best.\nOctavius had surprised him; when Peter had gotten the job, in his less enthusiastic moments he had wondered what it would be like working for the man, and he had pessimistically wondered if Octavius would simply have him clean up and get him and the other assistants coffees or something mundane like that, but it hadn't happened like that. Octavius had instead taken Peter and the others under his wing, and when Peter had met them, he knew they would not get along with the likes of Flash Thompson. All of them were like him in so many ways; socially inept and awkward, preferring books and computers to socialising, loved sci-fi movies, and found it hard to meet others to understand them.\nThanks to various science journals and articles, and documentaries on the internet, Peter had seen clips showing particle accelerators, labs aimed at piercing the mysteries of the universe and NASA's laboratories, but Octavius's laboratory was filled, seemingly, with computers and technology he had never dreamt of.\nBut he was despairing because he had yet to try to make a move towards Mary Jane Watson, and to be honest he doubted he could ever make the beautiful redhead girl like him. But the miracle was there were other girls here, and he had found he had more in common with them than he ever did with Mary Jane.\nOne of the girls was a blonde girl called Gwen Stacy; she was beautiful and despite being socially awkward, she had a sense of fashion that was both simple and elegant.\nIn the meantime, he was focusing on his job. Octavius was both a boss and a teacher, and he set tasks for advancing human science for all of the apprentices he had gathered.\nBut while he was awed by the technologies and the fact he was making his own future while kids like Harry had it handed over to him on a plate, and Flash and others like him were given scholarships for things as mundane as sports, Peter was left wondering if his personal life would be better, this job was helping pay many of the bills which was a relief.\n\"Be careful there, Peter,\" a soft voice spoke, and Peter nearly jumped when he realised Dr Octavius was right behind him, he turned on his seat and saw him there. \"I want that formula to be stable, not too explosive.\"\nPeter turned and to his horror and embarrassment he realised Octavius was right, he had been concentrating so hard on worrying about his woes that he had half forgotten what he was meant to be doing. \"I'm sorry, Doctor,\" he hastily corrected the formula, double-checking it to make sure it wasn't too dangerous.\nOctavius frowned as if Peter was a complex puzzle. \"Come with me, Peter, I want to talk to you,\" he said and while Peter hid his embarrassment and trepidation, he dutifully followed.

And before you say a word, I know you're not abused, but I think you are being bullied, yes?\"\nPeter was stunned that this genius, this titan of science, was able to read him so well when so many failed.\nFortunately, Octavius didn't expect an answer to such a sensitive question.

It had been a long, and hard, struggle to establish authority even in their own systems for the Galactic Council members. Fighting the twin snakes of piracy and autonomy that the Reaper invasion had spread had been an almost impossible task, considering the many systems and colonies of the galaxy. The non-council members faced worse isolation, the Quarians, Geth, Hanar, Drell, Krogan and Batarians were in an odd situation of stasis. Their home worlds were safe but the vast voids between them and the Citadel were still harbouring the many remaining threats to Galactic Security. Galactic Council Space was only a tenth of its pre-Reaper size and the Citadel Council fleet was at less than twenty-five percent of full strength. It was these stark facts, and the fact that the Galactic Council was now realising that that the monopoly of the Big Four was quickly eroding, that forced the Galactic Council to act. The SPECTRE program, the elite espionage and tactical arm of the Citadel, was opened to all races to allow feelings of galactic togetherness to flourish. The new SPECTRE program had been running for the past twenty years, with experienced tutors from all races encouraging a new breed of SPECTRE to combat the piracy and uncontrolled madness that the rebellious sectors bred.

        "story": "A deer came right through the windshield, her father says, and taps the stretch of glass in front of him. Came right through, and knocked the guy into the backseat.\nThe deer was dead on impact? she asks.\nCome on, he chuckles, pushing the car lighter in. What saved the guy was not wearing a seat belt. First thing, the car ran up onto the train tracks.\nOf course a train was coming.\nSomebody going the other way stopped and dragged him off just in time. If he\u2019d had that seat belt on, he would have been pinned inside.\nHis seat belt swings limply against the car wall, where it has been sprung from its buzzer. I rest my case, she says. I\u2019ll watch for deer instead.\nHe laughs and lights his cigar.\nWhat do they call those small white birds that sit on the backs of the cows? she asks.\nIbis, he says, between puffs. Just like in Africa.\nShe pulls idly at the dangling seat belt. I knew that, she says.\nHe drives past a windmill, the single perpendicular in any direction, its blades chopping the air in blurred circles. From inside the car, no other sign of wind is evident across the empty prairie except for the car\u2019s shuddering on the county correction curves. Look at those pretty polka-dot horses, he says, by way of staying awake.\nThat\u2019s what they call pinto, right? she says.\nAppaloosa. Pinto\u2019s for the beans. I grow beans. Those are pinto beans.\nHe sticks her free arm toward the scraggly rows that fight the brush. Some days I like growing beans better than judging. Judging gives me a stomachache.\nIn Africa, she says, all the cases come to you\u2014or else you get borne on a litter to the next one.\nWhat a good idea\u2014the weight of justice on the plaintiff\u2019s neck. He knocks ash off his cigar. That sure would shorten up a case or two.\nA small town reveals itself a mile off, signaled by a long stretch of fence posts covered, each one, by a cowboy boot. He slows when they come to the town\u2019s single intersection, turns down its one street, and parks in front of an old schoolhouse marked caf\u00e9.\nThis is what education\u2019s come to, he says. Or else they turn the schools into junk stores full of antiques\u2014this one\u2019s antique food.\nWhen they enter, the prosecuting attorney lifts his coffee spoon toward them from the first booth. You\u2019re late, he says, with a smile that looks easy.\nIf I\u2019m early, I have to pay the check, he says. My daughter, the one out of Africa.\nWelcome back, says the attorney, shaking hands. Not much of a tan.\nIt\u2019s been ten years, she says.\nA person gets marked, says her father. She\u2019s a marked woman.\nDad, she says. That\u2019s right out of the movies.\nA masculine blonde swings out two plastic-coated menus by way of a signal and herds them into the booth. The three of them turn their faces up to her as she pulls a green guest check out of her waistband. Nothing special today, she says.\nThey order, and the waitress writes nothing down.\nThe attorney sighs into his coffee cup. Did you know, my dear, that right here is the richest town per capita outside of Saudi Arabia. I mean it\u2014with the cattle market the way it is. And they can\u2019t even put together a decent lunch. Probably just like in Africa.\nIt wasn\u2019t hard to order lunch in Africa, she says. You ate what there was.\nThe attorney looks at her father. She sure is one of yours.\nShe\u2019s not around much anymore. I blame that on her trip. He smiles and pulls napkins out of the container. So who\u2019s done what to whom this week? What happened to the harassment?\nOut of court. They moved in with each other.\nAh, crime, her father says, rubbing his hands across the napkins. She files a complaint every time she\u2019s in season.\nAs regular as a bear, says the attorney. Pardon me, he says to her.\nWe\u2019re out of vegetables, interrupts the waitress, unloading her forearm of plates. How about crackers as a substitute? She offers sealed Saltines.\nWith pickle relish? says her father. That\u2019ll qualify.\nShe leaves six packets of crackers, and they eat slabs of meat and mounds of starch, and the attorney picks his teeth. I heard about you, he says. You worried your father.\nNot Dad, the guy who won\u2019t wear a seat belt.\nSeat belts? That\u2019s just another thing those car people make you pay for. You know his problem? The attorney points his toothpick at her father\u2019s forehead. He\u2019s got imagination. He\u2019s a soft-hearted bastard who gets bad dreams. Am I right, or what?\nHer father pats the ketchup off his face. I\u2019m just a farmer with opinions. That\u2019s why they elected me.\nRight. The attorney leans forward. Just one of the best lawyers in this part of the country. When are you going to stick this judging business and get back to some real law?\nThat\u2019s laying it on a little thick. Her father waves at the waitress and points at his cup.\nThe coffee\u2019s actually good, says the attorney.\nThe waitress pours three lukewarm cups, then, with great flourish, signs her name to the bottom of the check and places it onto the table.\nThe attorney picks it up.\nWhat? Paying for poison? Her father laughs. That\u2019s what I call influencing the judge. He slaps him on the shoulder and takes the check away.\nThey file out of the caf\u00e9 onto the half-buried cracked sidewalk and blink into the sun. So that was fine. Her father moves his belt a notch and retucks his shirt. See you next week.\nOh, there\u2019s just one little thing. The attorney finds a document he\u2019s stuck in the folds of his newspaper. They\u2019re in jail now if you want to have a talk with them.\nHer father glances at the paper, and then again, rubbing his eyes behind his glasses. A dog case? You need an autopsy for a dog case?\nHey, says the attorney. It could\u2019ve died in Kellen County and turned out to be somebody else\u2019s problem entirely.\nWith the attorney following them, they drive the three blocks to the county jail. How\u2019s your digestion? she asks.\nGuilty, he says. He turns the car onto the upgrade next to the sheriff\u2019s car. Three young men loiter under a tree in front.\nJust look at the silver on that one, she says. It\u2019s a wonder they can stand upright.\nRodeo awards, says her father. They make the buckles bigger every year.\nThey\u2019re friends of the accused, says the attorney, coming around to the jail door. There\u2019s a cow meet this afternoon, and we\u2019ve got the best wranglers inside.\nYou do have a little something, says her father.\nOh, boy, says the attorney, holding the door open for them.\nThe sheriff is asleep at his desk as if he\u2019s being paid to do it. They don\u2019t bother him, they walk through a door marked Open where a bare lightbulb dangles overhead and two chairs meet a table. Just look at this, says the attorney.\nA county section map is tacked to the wall behind him. Pinned to it is a cutout of a collie. Red string radiates from its belly fur in a crazy crisscross. Here\u2019s the gas station, he says, pointing to a green-headed pin. And here\u2019s where we found the body. He presses a black-headed pin a foot away.\nYou just don\u2019t have enough to fuss around with here, do you? says her father.\nWell, says the attorney, yes.\nThat sure is a long way for a tail to keep burning, her father says, tracing the string.\nThey put the nozzle into her and gassed her up. The attorney fiddles with a chair back. Somebody had a match. After she caught, she tried to bite her rear end. The way they do.\nI get it. Her father ducks his head as if avoiding the cruelty. You don\u2019t have to stick around here if you don\u2019t want to, he says to her.\nShe shakes her head.\nHe turns back to the attorney. So, who do you want me to talk to?\nActually, the parents. They just want to leave some money and have the whole thing dismissed. They can pay, believe me.\nThat\u2019s letting them off pretty easy, says her father, taking a Tums. The punishment should fit the crime I think. Like they do in Africa.\nI don\u2019t know, she says. An eye for an eye?\nPunishment? The attorney looks nervous. They\u2019ll fight it.\nHer father looks disgusted as if the attorney himself did the job on the dog. Let them go to the Supreme Court for all I care. Big deal. First off, collect the bail. You can make that big. Then they\u2019ll get to half-strangle calves in the rodeo and be happy. I\u2019ll come back in a week when it cools down a little and try them.\nIf you say so, says the attorney.\nHer father looks out the window at the rodeo contestants. And remember, this isn\u2019t settled out of court like your bear woman. This is the State versus a bunch of mean rich kids.\nThe attorney fools with his tie clip. I\u2019ll tell them.\nThey drive to the next outpost where at least there is a Dairy Queen, and drink malts leaned up against the hot car. I\u2019ll have each of them tied to a dog for a week, day and night, her father says. The first I hear of any abuse, they\u2019ll really pay.\nAh, civilization, she says.\nHe\u2019s fumbling around for a new cigar. You know, he says, my stomach feels better now that I\u2019ve decided on a sentence. Maybe I could get used to this judging.\nIn Africa where I went, if the judge turns out to be wrong, he has to serve the sentence.\nHe raises his eyebrows like he doesn\u2019t have to believe her. Why did I waste all that worry on you?\nYou never worry, she says, her straw making noise at the bottom of the cup.\nHe lit his cigar. Maybe. He looked at her over his puffing. But maybe I drive a little slower when I have you around.",

I knew that, she says.\nHe drives past a windmill, the single perpendicular in any direction, its blades chopping the air in blurred circles. From inside the car, no other sign of wind is evident across the empty prairie except for the car\u2019s shuddering on the county correction curves. Look at those pretty polka-dot horses, he says, by way of staying awake.\nThat\u2019s what they call pinto, right? she says.\nAppaloosa. Pinto\u2019s for the beans. I grow beans. Those are pinto beans.\nHe sticks her free arm toward the scraggly rows that fight the brush. Some days I like growing beans better than judging. Judging gives me a stomachache.\nIn Africa, she says, all the cases come to you\u2014or else you get borne on a litter to the next one.\nWhat a good idea\u2014the weight of justice on the plaintiff\u2019s neck. He knocks ash off his cigar. That sure would shorten up a case or two.\nA small town reveals itself a mile off, signaled by a long stretch of fence posts covered, each one, by a cowboy boot. He slows when they come to the town\u2019s single intersection, turns down its one street, and parks in front of an old schoolhouse marked caf\u00e9.\nThis is what education\u2019s come to, he says. Or else they turn the schools into junk stores full of antiques\u2014this one\u2019s antique food.\nWhen they enter, the prosecuting attorney lifts his coffee spoon toward them from the first booth. You\u2019re late, he says, with a smile that looks easy.\nIf I\u2019m early, I have to pay the check, he says. My daughter, the one out of Africa.\nWelcome back, says the attorney, shaking hands. Not much of a tan.\nIt\u2019s been ten years, she says.\nA person gets marked, says her father. She\u2019s a marked woman.\nDad, she says. That\u2019s right out of the movies.\nA masculine blonde swings out two plastic-coated menus by way of a signal and herds them into the booth. The three of them turn their faces up to her as she pulls a green guest check out of her waistband. Nothing special today, she says.\nThey order, and the waitress writes nothing down.\nThe attorney sighs into his coffee cup. Did you know, my dear, that right here is the richest town per capita outside of Saudi Arabia. I mean it\u2014with the cattle market the way it is. And they can\u2019t even put together a decent lunch. Probably just like in Africa.\nIt wasn\u2019t hard to order lunch in Africa, she says. You ate what there was.\nThe attorney looks at her father. She sure is one of yours.\nShe\u2019s not around much anymore. I blame that on her trip. He smiles and pulls napkins out of the container. So who\u2019s done what to whom this week? What happened to the harassment?\nOut of court. They moved in with each other.\nAh, crime, her father says, rubbing his hands across the napkins. She files a complaint every time she\u2019s in season.\nAs regular as a bear, says the attorney. Pardon me, he says to her.\nWe\u2019re out of vegetables, interrupts the waitress, unloading her forearm of plates. How about crackers as a substitute? She offers sealed Saltines.\nWith pickle relish? says her father. That\u2019ll qualify.\nShe leaves six packets of crackers, and they eat slabs of meat and mounds of starch, and the attorney picks his teeth. I heard about you, he says. You worried your father.\nNot Dad, the guy who won\u2019t wear a seat belt.\nSeat belts? That\u2019s just another thing those car people make you pay for. You know his problem? The attorney points his toothpick at her father\u2019s forehead. He\u2019s got imagination. He\u2019s a soft-hearted bastard who gets bad dreams. Am I right, or what?\nHer father pats the ketchup off his face. I\u2019m just a farmer with opinions. That\u2019s why they elected me.\nRight. The attorney leans forward. Just one of the best lawyers in this part of the country. When are you going to stick this judging business and get back to some real law?\nThat\u2019s laying it on a little thick. Her father waves at the waitress and points at his cup.\nThe coffee\u2019s actually good, says the attorney.\nThe waitress pours three lukewarm cups, then, with great flourish, signs her name to the bottom of the check and places it onto the table.\nThe attorney picks it up.\nWhat? Paying for poison? Her father laughs. That\u2019s what I call influencing the judge. He slaps him on the shoulder and takes the check away.\nThey file out of the caf\u00e9 onto the half-buried cracked sidewalk and blink into the sun. So that was fine. Her father moves his belt a notch and retucks his shirt. See you next week.\nOh, there\u2019s just one little thing. The attorney finds a document he\u2019s stuck in the folds of his newspaper. They\u2019re in jail now if you want to have a talk with them.\nHer father glances at the paper, and then again, rubbing his eyes behind his glasses. A dog case? You need an autopsy for a dog case?\nHey, says the attorney. It could\u2019ve died in Kellen County and turned out to be somebody else\u2019s problem entirely.\nWith the attorney following them, they drive the three blocks to the county jail. How\u2019s your digestion? she asks.\nGuilty, he says. He turns the car onto the upgrade next to the sheriff\u2019s car. Three young men loiter under a tree in front.\nJust look at the silver on that one, she says. It\u2019s a wonder they can stand upright.\nRodeo awards, says her father. They make the buckles bigger every year.\nThey\u2019re friends of the accused, says the attorney, coming around to the jail door. There\u2019s a cow meet this afternoon, and we\u2019ve got the best wranglers inside.\nYou do have a little something, says her father.\nOh, boy, says the attorney, holding the door open for them.\nThe sheriff is asleep at his desk as if he\u2019s being paid to do it. They don\u2019t bother him, they walk through a door marked Open where a bare lightbulb dangles overhead and two chairs meet a table. Just look at this, says the attorney.\nA county section map is tacked to the wall behind him. Pinned to it is a cutout of a collie. Red string radiates from its belly fur in a crazy crisscross. Here\u2019s the gas station, he says, pointing to a green-headed pin. And here\u2019s where we found the body. He presses a black-headed pin a foot away.\nYou just don\u2019t have enough to fuss around with here, do you? says her father.\nWell, says the attorney, yes.\nThat sure is a long way for a tail to keep burning, her father says, tracing the string.\nThey put the nozzle into her and gassed her up. The attorney fiddles with a chair back. Somebody had a match. After she caught, she tried to bite her rear end. The way they do.\nI get it. Her father ducks his head as if avoiding the cruelty. You don\u2019t have to stick around here if you don\u2019t want to, he says to her.\nShe shakes her head.\nHe turns back to the attorney. So, who do you want me to talk to?\nActually, the parents. They just want to leave some money and have the whole thing dismissed. They can pay, believe me.\nThat\u2019s letting them off pretty easy, says her father, taking a Tums. The punishment should fit the crime I think. Like they do in Africa.\nI don\u2019t know, she says. An eye for an eye?\nPunishment? The attorney looks nervous. They\u2019ll fight it.\nHer father looks disgusted as if the attorney himself did the job on the dog. Let them go to the Supreme Court for all I care. Big deal. First off, collect the bail. You can make that big. Then they\u2019ll get to half-strangle calves in the rodeo and be happy. I\u2019ll come back in a week when it cools down a little and try them.\nIf you say so, says the attorney.\nHer father looks out the window at the rodeo contestants. And remember, this isn\u2019t settled out of court like your bear woman. This is the State versus a bunch of mean rich kids.\nThe attorney fools with his tie clip. I\u2019ll tell them.\nThey drive to the next outpost where at least there is a Dairy Queen, and drink malts leaned up against the hot car. I\u2019ll have each of them tied to a dog for a week, day and night, her father says. The first I hear of any abuse, they\u2019ll really pay.\nAh, civilization, she says.\nHe\u2019s fumbling around for a new cigar. You know, he says, my stomach feels better now that I\u2019ve decided on a sentence. Maybe I could get used to this judging.\nIn Africa where I went, if the judge turns out to be wrong, he has to serve the sentence.\nHe raises his eyebrows like he doesn\u2019t have to believe her. Why did I waste all that worry on you?\nYou never worry, she says, her straw making noise at the bottom of the cup.\nHe lit his cigar. Maybe. He looked at her over his puffing. But maybe I drive a little slower when I have you around.",

        "story": "A deer came right through the windshield, her father says, and taps the stretch of glass in front of him. Came right through, and knocked the guy into the backseat.\nThe deer was dead on impact? she asks.\nCome on, he chuckles, pushing the car lighter in. What saved the guy was not wearing a seat belt.

I\u2019ll come back in a week when it cools down a little and try them.\nIf you say so, says the attorney.\nHer father looks out the window at the rodeo contestants. And remember, this isn\u2019t settled out of court like your bear woman. This is the State versus a bunch of mean rich kids.\nThe attorney fools with his tie clip. I\u2019ll tell them.\nThey drive to the next outpost where at least there is a Dairy Queen, and drink malts leaned up against the hot car. I\u2019ll have each of them tied to a dog for a week, day and night, her father says. The first I hear of any abuse, they\u2019ll really pay.\nAh, civilization, she says.\nHe\u2019s fumbling around for a new cigar. You know, he says, my stomach feels better now that I\u2019ve decided on a sentence. Maybe I could get used to this judging.\nIn Africa where I went, if the judge turns out to be wrong, he has to serve the sentence.\nHe raises his eyebrows like he doesn\u2019t have to believe her. Why did I waste all that worry on you?\nYou never worry, she says, her straw making noise at the bottom of the cup.\nHe lit his cigar. Maybe. He looked at her over his puffing. But maybe I drive a little slower when I have you around.",

        "story": "Kitty was suspicious of the escalator, or, more properly, the escalators, as there were two of them, one falling and one rising, anchored side by side in the middle of the main shopping floor. She disliked the push of the motor, and, under that, the light clacking sound of something she could not analyze. A chain perhaps, that ran loose, deep in the machine.\nThey were new. The space where they appeared had been boxed in for months, floor to ceiling, with cheap wooden panelling, painted blue. First, a hole was knocked in the floor, and then another in the ceiling above, she supposed. They worked at night, but even during the day men came out from behind the panelling, filthy and smiling, and went back in again: ordinary Dublin men who worked whenever, and installed escalators in the middle of the night. She wondered how much they were paid.\nKitty tried to take to them, but she couldn't. She was disturbed by the sight of them out among the merchandise. She disliked the way they talked to each other loudly and laughed as if they owned the shop. They interrupted the conversation, somehow. You'd be selling a bed, talking about springs, you'd be with a young couple, pushing into the mattress in a cozy sort of way, and who would stroll past but the lean blond one, maybe, with the dirty-looking tan, adjusting his zip on the way back from the loo.\nNot that she minded men. She had two grown sons at home, so she was used to it: the cheerfulness, the indifference, and the mess. Though sometimes she turned around in the kitchen and was shocked by the sheer size of them\u2014all that protein and carbohydrate, the muscle and milk of them, as though she had fed a couple of potted plants, and grown triffids.\nThen, one morning, she walked in and the men were gone. The place was perfect; the carpets fresh and new, the hoarding dissolved into thin air, and, in the middle of the floor, a pair of escalators, one going up and the other coming down. The steps tugged lightly at each other as they passed, snagging and loosening all day long. They ticked in the corner of her eye, making her feel balanced, or dizzy, depending on the light. They were so clean. The up escalator always mounting itself, stair over stair; the down escalator falling like syrup, burying itself slowly in the flatness of the floor.\nThey were beautiful, and they never stopped, and finally they got on her nerves. Nothing happened in the Bed Department. People bought a bed, or they did not buy a bed. Kitty used to like the open space, the hummocky slabs of mattress, the headboards like tombstones in a giant graveyard. \"Who's been sleeping in my bed?\" But all her satisfaction was gone now. The way people lay down and curled up, in the middle of the crowd. The old couples sitting on either side of the mattress and looking over their shoulders at each other in a way that was almost coy; the giggles and the silences. Most people buying a bed were in love, she used to think, or hopeful at least of finding love. Now they just bounced up and down or put their dirty feet up or looked like they could kill for a decent night's sleep.\nShe was at home one evening, washing the dishes, when the phone rang. It was a young man who said he was looking for a Kevin Daly. Kitty was listed as K. Daly in the phone book, and she didn't want to give too much away. She said that there was no Kevin Daly at that number, and the young man asked if she was sure. He said that he was looking for a Kevin Daly he used to know, a man who had gone to school in Malahide. \"I'm sorry,\" Kitty said, but they were talking to each other now. He told her that Kevin Daly was his brother, long out of touch. Then he said that Kevin Daly was actually his father, but that he did not know he was his father, or he did not know that he was his son. He said that he was looking for his father because his mother was sick and that was why she had given him his father's name, finally\u2014Kevin Daly, and the fact that he'd gone to school in Malahide. \"It was a schooltime romance,\" he said. Kitty just said \"Sorry\" a lot, the way you might say \"I see.\"\n\"Sorry,\" she said.\n\"So that's why\u2014you know?\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nHe asked did she have a brother called Kevin Daly, or a cousin, and she just said, \"No, sorry.\" But he was quite insistent, as though she might be harboring the man. \"No really, I'm sorry,\" she said, and put down the phone.\nThe next day, Kitty expected someone to float down the escalator into the Bed Department and call her by name. She did not know who it might be. A girl, maybe, with green eyes, or a slender young boy. She imagined a man in a perfect black suit\u2014something extra about him, anyway, like Cary Grant. A young man with curly red hair gazed at her\u2014or through her\u2014all the way from the floor above, and she wondered, bizarrely, if he was the person she was waiting for. Also what he might say to her, if he was.\nThen a figure did appear that made her heart turn, and it took a while before Kitty realized that it was her own mother, sailing down from Fabrics and Soft Furnishings like a queen.\nCritics at Large Live, featuring Julio Torres\n\"I didn't recognize you,\" Kitty said.\nHer mother was in town looking for a shower curtain and had thought she would pop in to say hello. But after that there was little enough to talk about. Kitty was used to seeing her at home; out in the open, she seemed surprisingly well dressed and mute.\n\"Well, you always know where to find me,\" Kitty said to her, with a stranger's smile.\nKitty ended up seducing a man from the local Drama Society, a little to his surprise. He had been courting her for months, but in an old-fashioned sort of way. He was sixty-plus, and Kitty was forty-plus; that was the kind of age gap you could expect, with two nearly grown sons. They were both in a production of \"Johnny Belinda,\" a play about a deaf-mute who gets pregnant, though it comes out right in the end. Kitty did the interval coffees and had a walk-on in the final scene; Tom, for that was the man's name, did the set. He was good with his hands, he said, as he bent over a sawhorse in the scene dock, and Kitty flicked a glance at him to see what he meant\u2014but all he meant was that he was good at making things. Nice. In a way. He drove her home after rehearsal most nights, and one evening they stopped out to eat. After which, Kitty asked him in for a drink.\nTom. He said all he needed was a couple of hours to fit two dimmers where the old light switch was, but she'd need to redecorate, after. He looked at the photos on her mantelpiece. He was recently bereaved. His daughter had told him to join the Drama Society, so there he was. In a moment, Kitty thought, he would tell her about his teeth, that they were all his own. Faded brown eyes, silver hair, a handsome where-did-it-all-go-wrong face. They were on the sofa, safe enough. Kitty's older son lumbered in from the pub, and stayed to be introduced. Her younger one was upstairs with his own TV. They were nice boys. They did not expect their mother to seduce old geezers in the front room, and neither did the geezer. It was awkward all the way through, and quite satisfying. Kitty did not tell him about her ex-husband, as he did not talk about his dead wife. She did not tell him that her husband had strayed, that she had done everything to keep him, up to and including porn videos in the bedroom, and that, when she finally left, the judge held that desertion against her and awarded him the house. She did not tell him how her husband had moved a woman in, two weeks after walking out of court. She did not tell him how the boys had followed her eventually to her bedsit and looked after her, as only young boys can, how together they had made their way here, to the outer suburbs and a decent life. Nor did she tell him that she was pregnant, when she realized that she was pregnant. She just let him, and the Drama Society, lapse, soon after the curtain had rung down on \"Johnny Belinda,\" and before anyone could be surprised.\nAt first, she thought it was the change of life. She stood in the Bed Department and waited for hot flashes. She did not mind growing old as long as it meant growing easy, but it did not seem to be working out that way. There was an agitation, a turbulence in her blood. She rode all the way up to Accounts to query her pay slip, and she landed back down in the Bed Department with a thump. She walked the floor and sat on the beds. She had a terrible need to lie down on one of them. One Monday evening, during stocktaking, she actually did lie down. She simply reclined. She let her back sink into a double-sprung Slumberland, and felt she might never rise again.\nIt was not until she bought three pots of apricot jam that the penny dropped. She did not even bother to take a test. She felt that swooping blankness she had felt with each of the boys, so delicious, like diving into a pool and finding you can breathe. The child was no bigger than a pip in the flesh of her stomach. She took it for walks and little outings. She gave it a go on the escalators and on a park swing, scuffing the coarse sand under her feet and feeling a little mad. What would she tell the boys? As for the people in the Bed Department\u2014Jackie, who shared the floor with her, and the customers who came in to look or buy\u2014they all looked empty to her, like husks. As though she were the only real thing left. It was like that film with the pods, and she wanted to run away somewhere, to a deserted lighthouse, or a shack by the beach, and sit in a shaft of light while her baby grew.\nTom rang. His voice was a shock.\n\"I just thought I'd check up on you.\" He sounded close, he sounded right inside her ear. Kitty had to remind herself that there were miles of cable between them, a maze of electricity and static.\n\"I'm fine,\" she said. \"How are things?\"\n\"Good. Good.\"\nIn the pause, she felt sorry for him. He wasn't used to this kind of thing.\n\"And yourself?\" he said.\n\"Oh, flying,\" she said. \"Flying form.\" And he took the hint and let it go.\nThen, one morning, the down elevator sighed and stopped. People clumped down the steps carefully, almost aslant, squinting at the lines that were strangely solid now, though they still seemed to shift beneath their feet. Kitty was glad she wasn't on the thing when it ground to a halt. It would make you look so foolish. As it happened, the escalators were empty, apart from a young woman on the other side, who seemed to surge suddenly up. Whoosh.\nKitty knew it didn't mean anything, but she feared for her baby, which was now just eleven weeks old. She could not bear the lopsided sight of the stalled steps; they were like someone endlessly limping at the other end of the shop floor. She took a very long lunch, and when she came back a man had taken the panel off the bottom of the broken side. She was right about the chain\u2014there it was, looping around the steps that were wedges, actually, when you looked at them side-on. They packed around the central pivot like big slices of metal pie, then separated out on the way up, dangling their triangular bases into space.\nThe escalator man glanced at her as she stared into the works, and then went back to his phase tester, tipping the metal gently here and there. He had hair on the backs of his hands, fine and light: one of those furry men with cushioned muscles and uncertain eyes. Kitty stood for a long time, making him uneasy. He glanced over his shoulder again, but he did not really see her\u2014which was fine.\nKitty lost the baby at thirteen weeks, or lost something, at any rate. She looked at the blood on the wad of toilet paper and wondered if she was in the change of life, after all. Perhaps she had imagined the baby, perhaps it had never been there in the first place. She called in sick and went to bed and could not cry.\nAt the weekend, she drove her younger son to his soccer game in the Fifteen Acres. She had to park a distance away, because he was embarrassed by the car. Also, he did not like having his mother on the sidelines anymore, so Kitty, amused, went for a walk instead. She thought she might look for the deer. And, almost as she thought it, there they were, a herd of does and their fawns, standing or lying, and all of them chewing, watching, as she now watched, a pair of children and their toy plane buzzing at the other end of the glen.\nShe felt sure now that it had been a baby\u2014that she had not been fooled. Her stomach was still warm and aching from it. The deer chewed on and did not mind her, while the toy plane buzzed and sputtered and fell to the ground.\nThe change of life.\nHer life was changing, that was for sure, though she seemed to be standing still. But up or down? she wondered. Up or down? The children threw the plane back into the air, and it circled again on the end of its wire. Kitty walked on. It had been a baby, she knew it. She had been visited. How could it be down, when she felt such joy. \u2666",

The place was perfect; the carpets fresh and new, the hoarding dissolved into thin air, and, in the middle of the floor, a pair of escalators, one going up and the other coming down. The steps tugged lightly at each other as they passed, snagging and loosening all day long. They ticked in the corner of her eye, making her feel balanced, or dizzy, depending on the light. They were so clean. The up escalator always mounting itself, stair over stair; the down escalator falling like syrup, burying itself slowly in the flatness of the floor.\nThey were beautiful, and they never stopped, and finally they got on her nerves. Nothing happened in the Bed Department. People bought a bed, or they did not buy a bed. Kitty used to like the open space, the hummocky slabs of mattress, the headboards like tombstones in a giant graveyard. \"Who's been sleeping in my bed?\" But all her satisfaction was gone now. The way people lay down and curled up, in the middle of the crowd. The old couples sitting on either side of the mattress and looking over their shoulders at each other in a way that was almost coy; the giggles and the silences. Most people buying a bed were in love, she used to think, or hopeful at least of finding love. Now they just bounced up and down or put their dirty feet up or looked like they could kill for a decent night's sleep.\nShe was at home one evening, washing the dishes, when the phone rang. It was a young man who said he was looking for a Kevin Daly. Kitty was listed as K. Daly in the phone book, and she didn't want to give too much away. She said that there was no Kevin Daly at that number, and the young man asked if she was sure. He said that he was looking for a Kevin Daly he used to know, a man who had gone to school in Malahide. \"I'm sorry,\" Kitty said, but they were talking to each other now. He told her that Kevin Daly was his brother, long out of touch. Then he said that Kevin Daly was actually his father, but that he did not know he was his father, or he did not know that he was his son. He said that he was looking for his father because his mother was sick and that was why she had given him his father's name, finally\u2014Kevin Daly, and the fact that he'd gone to school in Malahide. \"It was a schooltime romance,\" he said. Kitty just said \"Sorry\" a lot, the way you might say \"I see.\"\n\"Sorry,\" she said.\n\"So that's why\u2014you know?\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nHe asked did she have a brother called Kevin Daly, or a cousin, and she just said, \"No, sorry.\" But he was quite insistent, as though she might be harboring the man. \"No really, I'm sorry,\" she said, and put down the phone.\nThe next day, Kitty expected someone to float down the escalator into the Bed Department and call her by name. She did not know who it might be. A girl, maybe, with green eyes, or a slender young boy. She imagined a man in a perfect black suit\u2014something extra about him, anyway, like Cary Grant. A young man with curly red hair gazed at her\u2014or through her\u2014all the way from the floor above, and she wondered, bizarrely, if he was the person she was waiting for. Also what he might say to her, if he was.\nThen a figure did appear that made her heart turn, and it took a while before Kitty realized that it was her own mother, sailing down from Fabrics and Soft Furnishings like a queen.\nCritics at Large Live, featuring Julio Torres\n\"I didn't recognize you,\" Kitty said.\nHer mother was in town looking for a shower curtain and had thought she would pop in to say hello. But after that there was little enough to talk about. Kitty was used to seeing her at home; out in the open, she seemed surprisingly well dressed and mute.\n\"Well, you always know where to find me,\" Kitty said to her, with a stranger's smile.\nKitty ended up seducing a man from the local Drama Society, a little to his surprise. He had been courting her for months, but in an old-fashioned sort of way. He was sixty-plus, and Kitty was forty-plus; that was the kind of age gap you could expect, with two nearly grown sons. They were both in a production of \"Johnny Belinda,\" a play about a deaf-mute who gets pregnant, though it comes out right in the end. Kitty did the interval coffees and had a walk-on in the final scene; Tom, for that was the man's name, did the set. He was good with his hands, he said, as he bent over a sawhorse in the scene dock, and Kitty flicked a glance at him to see what he meant\u2014but all he meant was that he was good at making things. Nice. In a way. He drove her home after rehearsal most nights, and one evening they stopped out to eat. After which, Kitty asked him in for a drink.\nTom. He said all he needed was a couple of hours to fit two dimmers where the old light switch was, but she'd need to redecorate, after. He looked at the photos on her mantelpiece. He was recently bereaved. His daughter had told him to join the Drama Society, so there he was. In a moment, Kitty thought, he would tell her about his teeth, that they were all his own. Faded brown eyes, silver hair, a handsome where-did-it-all-go-wrong face. They were on the sofa, safe enough. Kitty's older son lumbered in from the pub, and stayed to be introduced. Her younger one was upstairs with his own TV. They were nice boys. They did not expect their mother to seduce old geezers in the front room, and neither did the geezer. It was awkward all the way through, and quite satisfying. Kitty did not tell him about her ex-husband, as he did not talk about his dead wife. She did not tell him that her husband had strayed, that she had done everything to keep him, up to and including porn videos in the bedroom, and that, when she finally left, the judge held that desertion against her and awarded him the house. She did not tell him how her husband had moved a woman in, two weeks after walking out of court. She did not tell him how the boys had followed her eventually to her bedsit and looked after her, as only young boys can, how together they had made their way here, to the outer suburbs and a decent life. Nor did she tell him that she was pregnant, when she realized that she was pregnant. She just let him, and the Drama Society, lapse, soon after the curtain had rung down on \"Johnny Belinda,\" and before anyone could be surprised.\nAt first, she thought it was the change of life. She stood in the Bed Department and waited for hot flashes. She did not mind growing old as long as it meant growing easy, but it did not seem to be working out that way. There was an agitation, a turbulence in her blood. She rode all the way up to Accounts to query her pay slip, and she landed back down in the Bed Department with a thump. She walked the floor and sat on the beds. She had a terrible need to lie down on one of them. One Monday evening, during stocktaking, she actually did lie down. She simply reclined. She let her back sink into a double-sprung Slumberland, and felt she might never rise again.\nIt was not until she bought three pots of apricot jam that the penny dropped. She did not even bother to take a test. She felt that swooping blankness she had felt with each of the boys, so delicious, like diving into a pool and finding you can breathe. The child was no bigger than a pip in the flesh of her stomach. She took it for walks and little outings. She gave it a go on the escalators and on a park swing, scuffing the coarse sand under her feet and feeling a little mad. What would she tell the boys? As for the people in the Bed Department\u2014Jackie, who shared the floor with her, and the customers who came in to look or buy\u2014they all looked empty to her, like husks. As though she were the only real thing left. It was like that film with the pods, and she wanted to run away somewhere, to a deserted lighthouse, or a shack by the beach, and sit in a shaft of light while her baby grew.\nTom rang. His voice was a shock.\n\"I just thought I'd check up on you.\" He sounded close, he sounded right inside her ear. Kitty had to remind herself that there were miles of cable between them, a maze of electricity and static.\n\"I'm fine,\" she said. \"How are things?\"\n\"Good. Good.\"\nIn the pause, she felt sorry for him. He wasn't used to this kind of thing.\n\"And yourself?\" he said.\n\"Oh, flying,\" she said. \"Flying form.\" And he took the hint and let it go.\nThen, one morning, the down elevator sighed and stopped. People clumped down the steps carefully, almost aslant, squinting at the lines that were strangely solid now, though they still seemed to shift beneath their feet. Kitty was glad she wasn't on the thing when it ground to a halt. It would make you look so foolish. As it happened, the escalators were empty, apart from a young woman on the other side, who seemed to surge suddenly up. Whoosh.\nKitty knew it didn't mean anything, but she feared for her baby, which was now just eleven weeks old. She could not bear the lopsided sight of the stalled steps; they were like someone endlessly limping at the other end of the shop floor. She took a very long lunch, and when she came back a man had taken the panel off the bottom of the broken side. She was right about the chain\u2014there it was, looping around the steps that were wedges, actually, when you looked at them side-on. They packed around the central pivot like big slices of metal pie, then separated out on the way up, dangling their triangular bases into space.\nThe escalator man glanced at her as she stared into the works, and then went back to his phase tester, tipping the metal gently here and there. He had hair on the backs of his hands, fine and light: one of those furry men with cushioned muscles and uncertain eyes. Kitty stood for a long time, making him uneasy. He glanced over his shoulder again, but he did not really see her\u2014which was fine.\nKitty lost the baby at thirteen weeks, or lost something, at any rate. She looked at the blood on the wad of toilet paper and wondered if she was in the change of life, after all. Perhaps she had imagined the baby, perhaps it had never been there in the first place. She called in sick and went to bed and could not cry.\nAt the weekend, she drove her younger son to his soccer game in the Fifteen Acres. She had to park a distance away, because he was embarrassed by the car. Also, he did not like having his mother on the sidelines anymore, so Kitty, amused, went for a walk instead. She thought she might look for the deer. And, almost as she thought it, there they were, a herd of does and their fawns, standing or lying, and all of them chewing, watching, as she now watched, a pair of children and their toy plane buzzing at the other end of the glen.\nShe felt sure now that it had been a baby\u2014that she had not been fooled. Her stomach was still warm and aching from it. The deer chewed on and did not mind her, while the toy plane buzzed and sputtered and fell to the ground.\nThe change of life.\nHer life was changing, that was for sure, though she seemed to be standing still. But up or down? she wondered. Up or down? The children threw the plane back into the air, and it circled again on the end of its wire. Kitty walked on. It had been a baby, she knew it. She had been visited. How could it be down, when she felt such joy. \u2666",

First, a hole was knocked in the floor, and then another in the ceiling above, she supposed.

She disliked the way they talked to each other loudly and laughed as if they owned the shop. They interrupted the conversation, somehow.

He had been courting her for months, but in an old-fashioned sort of way. He was sixty-plus, and Kitty was forty-plus; that was the kind of age gap you could expect, with two nearly grown sons. They were both in a production of \"Johnny Belinda,\" a play about a deaf-mute who gets pregnant, though it comes out right in the end. Kitty did the interval coffees and had a walk-on in the final scene; Tom, for that was the man's name, did the set. He was good with his hands, he said, as he bent over a sawhorse in the scene dock, and Kitty flicked a glance at him to see what he meant\u2014but all he meant was that he was good at making things. Nice. In a way. He drove her home after rehearsal most nights, and one evening they stopped out to eat. After which, Kitty asked him in for a drink.\nTom. He said all he needed was a couple of hours to fit two dimmers where the old light switch was, but she'd need to redecorate, after. He looked at the photos on her mantelpiece. He was recently bereaved. His daughter had told him to join the Drama Society, so there he was. In a moment, Kitty thought, he would tell her about his teeth, that they were all his own. Faded brown eyes, silver hair, a handsome where-did-it-all-go-wrong face. They were on the sofa, safe enough. Kitty's older son lumbered in from the pub, and stayed to be introduced. Her younger one was upstairs with his own TV. They were nice boys. They did not expect their mother to seduce old geezers in the front room, and neither did the geezer. It was awkward all the way through, and quite satisfying. Kitty did not tell him about her ex-husband, as he did not talk about his dead wife. She did not tell him that her husband had strayed, that she had done everything to keep him, up to and including porn videos in the bedroom, and that, when she finally left, the judge held that desertion against her and awarded him the house. She did not tell him how her husband had moved a woman in, two weeks after walking out of court. She did not tell him how the boys had followed her eventually to her bedsit and looked after her, as only young boys can, how together they had made their way here, to the outer suburbs and a decent life. Nor did she tell him that she was pregnant, when she realized that she was pregnant. She just let him, and the Drama Society, lapse, soon after the curtain had rung down on \"Johnny Belinda,\" and before anyone could be surprised.\nAt first, she thought it was the change of life. She stood in the Bed Department and waited for hot flashes. She did not mind growing old as long as it meant growing easy, but it did not seem to be working out that way. There was an agitation, a turbulence in her blood. She rode all the way up to Accounts to query her pay slip, and she landed back down in the Bed Department with a thump. She walked the floor and sat on the beds. She had a terrible need to lie down on one of them. One Monday evening, during stocktaking, she actually did lie down. She simply reclined. She let her back sink into a double-sprung Slumberland, and felt she might never rise again.\nIt was not until she bought three pots of apricot jam that the penny dropped. She did not even bother to take a test. She felt that swooping blankness she had felt with each of the boys, so delicious, like diving into a pool and finding you can breathe. The child was no bigger than a pip in the flesh of her stomach. She took it for walks and little outings. She gave it a go on the escalators and on a park swing, scuffing the coarse sand under her feet and feeling a little mad. What would she tell the boys? As for the people in the Bed Department\u2014Jackie, who shared the floor with her, and the customers who came in to look or buy\u2014they all looked empty to her, like husks. As though she were the only real thing left. It was like that film with the pods, and she wanted to run away somewhere, to a deserted lighthouse, or a shack by the beach, and sit in a shaft of light while her baby grew.\nTom rang. His voice was a shock.\n\"I just thought I'd check up on you.\" He sounded close, he sounded right inside her ear. Kitty had to remind herself that there were miles of cable between them, a maze of electricity and static.\n\"I'm fine,\" she said. \"How are things?\"\n\"Good. Good.\"\nIn the pause, she felt sorry for him. He wasn't used to this kind of thing.\n\"And yourself?\" he said.\n\"Oh, flying,\" she said. \"Flying form.\" And he took the hint and let it go.\nThen, one morning, the down elevator sighed and stopped. People clumped down the steps carefully, almost aslant, squinting at the lines that were strangely solid now, though they still seemed to shift beneath their feet. Kitty was glad she wasn't on the thing when it ground to a halt. It would make you look so foolish. As it happened, the escalators were empty, apart from a young woman on the other side, who seemed to surge suddenly up. Whoosh.\nKitty knew it didn't mean anything, but she feared for her baby, which was now just eleven weeks old. She could not bear the lopsided sight of the stalled steps; they were like someone endlessly limping at the other end of the shop floor. She took a very long lunch, and when she came back a man had taken the panel off the bottom of the broken side. She was right about the chain\u2014there it was, looping around the steps that were wedges, actually, when you looked at them side-on. They packed around the central pivot like big slices of metal pie, then separated out on the way up, dangling their triangular bases into space.\nThe escalator man glanced at her as she stared into the works, and then went back to his phase tester, tipping the metal gently here and there. He had hair on the backs of his hands, fine and light: one of those furry men with cushioned muscles and uncertain eyes. Kitty stood for a long time, making him uneasy. He glanced over his shoulder again, but he did not really see her\u2014which was fine.\nKitty lost the baby at thirteen weeks, or lost something, at any rate. She looked at the blood on the wad of toilet paper and wondered if she was in the change of life, after all. Perhaps she had imagined the baby, perhaps it had never been there in the first place. She called in sick and went to bed and could not cry.\nAt the weekend, she drove her younger son to his soccer game in the Fifteen Acres. She had to park a distance away, because he was embarrassed by the car. Also, he did not like having his mother on the sidelines anymore, so Kitty, amused, went for a walk instead. She thought she might look for the deer. And, almost as she thought it, there they were, a herd of does and their fawns, standing or lying, and all of them chewing, watching, as she now watched, a pair of children and their toy plane buzzing at the other end of the glen.\nShe felt sure now that it had been a baby\u2014that she had not been fooled. Her stomach was still warm and aching from it. The deer chewed on and did not mind her, while the toy plane buzzed and sputtered and fell to the ground.\nThe change of life.\nHer life was changing, that was for sure, though she seemed to be standing still. But up or down? she wondered. Up or down? The children threw the plane back into the air, and it circled again on the end of its wire. Kitty walked on. It had been a baby, she knew it. She had been visited. How could it be down, when she felt such joy. \u2666",

        "story": "Kitty was suspicious of the escalator, or, more properly, the escalators, as there were two of them, one falling and one rising, anchored side by side in the middle of the main shopping floor. She disliked the push of the motor, and, under that, the light clacking sound of something she could not analyze. A chain perhaps, that ran loose, deep in the machine.\nThey were new. The space where they appeared had been boxed in for months, floor to ceiling, with cheap wooden panelling, painted blue. First, a hole was knocked in the floor, and then another in the ceiling above, she supposed. They worked at night, but even during the day men came out from behind the panelling, filthy and smiling, and went back in again: ordinary Dublin men who worked whenever, and installed escalators in the middle of the night. She wondered how much they were paid.\nKitty tried to take to them, but she couldn't. She was disturbed by the sight of them out among the merchandise. She disliked the way they talked to each other loudly and laughed as if they owned the shop. They interrupted the conversation, somehow. You'd be selling a bed, talking about springs, you'd be with a young couple, pushing into the mattress in a cozy sort of way, and who would stroll past but the lean blond one, maybe, with the dirty-looking tan, adjusting his zip on the way back from the loo.\nNot that she minded men. She had two grown sons at home, so she was used to it: the cheerfulness, the indifference, and the mess. Though sometimes she turned around in the kitchen and was shocked by the sheer size of them\u2014all that protein and carbohydrate, the muscle and milk of them, as though she had fed a couple of potted plants, and grown triffids.\nThen, one morning, she walked in and the men were gone. The place was perfect; the carpets fresh and new, the hoarding dissolved into thin air, and, in the middle of the floor, a pair of escalators, one going up and the other coming down. The steps tugged lightly at each other as they passed, snagging and loosening all day long. They ticked in the corner of her eye, making her feel balanced, or dizzy, depending on the light. They were so clean. The up escalator always mounting itself, stair over stair; the down escalator falling like syrup, burying itself slowly in the flatness of the floor.\nThey were beautiful, and they never stopped, and finally they got on her nerves. Nothing happened in the Bed Department. People bought a bed, or they did not buy a bed. Kitty used to like the open space, the hummocky slabs of mattress, the headboards like tombstones in a giant graveyard. \"Who's been sleeping in my bed?\" But all her satisfaction was gone now. The way people lay down and curled up, in the middle of the crowd. The old couples sitting on either side of the mattress and looking over their shoulders at each other in a way that was almost coy; the giggles and the silences. Most people buying a bed were in love, she used to think, or hopeful at least of finding love. Now they just bounced up and down or put their dirty feet up or looked like they could kill for a decent night's sleep.\nShe was at home one evening, washing the dishes, when the phone rang. It was a young man who said he was looking for a Kevin Daly. Kitty was listed as K. Daly in the phone book, and she didn't want to give too much away. She said that there was no Kevin Daly at that number, and the young man asked if she was sure. He said that he was looking for a Kevin Daly he used to know, a man who had gone to school in Malahide. \"I'm sorry,\" Kitty said, but they were talking to each other now. He told her that Kevin Daly was his brother, long out of touch. Then he said that Kevin Daly was actually his father, but that he did not know he was his father, or he did not know that he was his son. He said that he was looking for his father because his mother was sick and that was why she had given him his father's name, finally\u2014Kevin Daly, and the fact that he'd gone to school in Malahide. \"It was a schooltime romance,\" he said. Kitty just said \"Sorry\" a lot, the way you might say \"I see.\"\n\"Sorry,\" she said.\n\"So that's why\u2014you know?\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nHe asked did she have a brother called Kevin Daly, or a cousin, and she just said, \"No, sorry.\" But he was quite insistent, as though she might be harboring the man. \"No really, I'm sorry,\" she said, and put down the phone.\nThe next day, Kitty expected someone to float down the escalator into the Bed Department and call her by name. She did not know who it might be. A girl, maybe, with green eyes, or a slender young boy. She imagined a man in a perfect black suit\u2014something extra about him, anyway, like Cary Grant. A young man with curly red hair gazed at her\u2014or through her\u2014all the way from the floor above, and she wondered, bizarrely, if he was the person she was waiting for. Also what he might say to her, if he was.\nThen a figure did appear that made her heart turn, and it took a while before Kitty realized that it was her own mother, sailing down from Fabrics and Soft Furnishings like a queen.\nCritics at Large Live, featuring Julio Torres\n\"I didn't recognize you,\" Kitty said.\nHer mother was in town looking for a shower curtain and had thought she would pop in to say hello. But after that there was little enough to talk about. Kitty was used to seeing her at home; out in the open, she seemed surprisingly well dressed and mute.\n\"Well, you always know where to find me,\" Kitty said to her, with a stranger's smile.\nKitty ended up seducing a man from the local Drama Society, a little to his surprise.

You were born and raised to be a weapon, and that's all you are meant to be. You don't get to change, sweetheart. That's not how human weapons work.\"",
        "story": "\u201cYou don\u2019t get to decide to have a heart now, sweetheart. That isn\u2019t how this program works. You were born and raised to be a weapon. There isn\u2019t even a full brain in your thick skull anymore. All that\u2019s left is a machine. You\u2019re nothing but a gun. Now stop jamming and fire.\u201d Lieutenant Gabby Ria ordered, pointing at the child across from her.\nWhile she shrieked out her orders, Era froze, unable to pull the trigger. The lieutenant was right; they were only a weapon. Yet memories were flooding into its mind, drowning out that robotic side that often took centre stage. Memories of a specific human it couldn\u2019t recognise, getting overwhelmed by their past.\nAcross from the pair, the girl, Jessica, remained curled behind a desk, gripping a stuffed bear. The paw of the bear once holding a tiny red balloon, one that had been torn off days ago. Even without the scraps she wore, she was a miserable sight. Tired eyes, constant shaking and a murmuring for help that only Era\u2019s hyper-detailed hearing could pick up. \u201cPlease, leave me alone.\u201d She begged.\nEra could never point its gun at a superior officer, so instead, it turned its face towards her, neck twisting eighty degrees to find her. They designed Era models to be basic, stripping them of all their unique features and traits. Giving them the same blank blue eyes, light brown hair, and voice chips. This making it harder for a lieutenant or any officer to see them as anything other than a disposable machine.\n\u201cWhy? Why can I think? I don\u2019t like this? I don\u2019t like thinking. Everything hurts, I\u2019m scared. It\u2019s dark in here. Gabby. You told me I wouldn\u2019t hurt. Why am I hurting?\u201d The tone remained robotic, with the blank face unable to express the sensations pulsing through its circuits.\nGabby retrieved her own pistol, gazing away from Era, turning her attention to the laboratory they stood in. They had bombed the place to hell. No, that didn\u2019t even do it justice. They had bombed the place to purgatory, leaving nothing but scorched land, a few desks and the remnants of glass and tubes. If one passed through this place, they would assume it had been an underground dumping facility, not the proud anti Era factory they had boasted about while it was still active.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t feel pain, and you can\u2019t think. There shouldn\u2019t even be a part of you that can think. It\u2019s blocked under our programing. Listen to me, Era.\u201d Gabby began.\n\u201cI\u2019M NOT ERA.\u201d They snapped. \u201cI\u2019m Nick. We know each other. Don\u2019t we?\u201d\nGabby\u2019s heart sank. This shouldn\u2019t be possible. No other Era model had recovered their memories before. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t even have that name saved to your chip.\u201d As she contemplated the information, she heard tiny footsteps near the table. Returning her gun to the girl, she fired a shot, trying to hit the monster before it could flee. When the gun fired, the girl ducked back behind the table. \u201cDon\u2019t move, monster. Is this your doing?\u201d\nEra looked at the weapon in their hands, tensing. \u201cYou said this program was for justice. Didn\u2019t you? That we would save people? Why are we doing this, then? You said this program would save me. Am I actually saved?\u201d You\u2019ve made me into a monster.\u201d\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have assigned you to me, Nick. None of this makes any sense. I never lied about anything. On your deathbed, I told you that this was the only way you could keep fighting. You wanted to fight. I was against this.\u201d Gabby kept her weapon pointed at the table, giving Era a side glance.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this. I\u2019m scared. Why did they need part of my brain? Can\u2019t they make robots?\u201d\n\u201cRobots are unreliable. They can be hacked, and their energy drains far too quickly. Allowing them to use part of a human brain allows their processes to save space and energy on the field. You should already know this. We\u2019ve had this conversation before, haven\u2019t we?\u201d Gabby stepped closer to the table, only to halt when she heard Era follow her.\n\u201cDon\u2019t kill her.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s only a kid.\u201d\nGabby sighed. \u201cYou know. Part of me wanted to believe that was actually you, Nick. That I could say a proper goodbye to my old friend. It\u2019s not. That creature\u2019s just pulling at memories, trying to find something that might weaken me. A creature like this killed you. You should know she isn\u2019t just a kid. its emotional manipulation, the same type you fell to. I\u2019m guessing you knew that too, monster. Or did you overlook that memory when you were sweeping through our files?\u201d\nJessica screeched, tossing the bear to the floor. She knew she was trapped, giving guttural growls as she tapped the table, shaking her only cover. Gabby remained still, not approaching the sound, nor firing a wasted shot. \u201cNick, if that is you in there, you\u2019ll take the shot.\u201d\nEra did nothing, and so Gabby reached into Era\u2019s hand, pulling the trigger on his weapon. When it fired, the monster popped out from its cover, assuming Gabby had fired her own gun. Thinking it had a chance to run, it lunged out of cover, only to get shot down by Gabby. The \u2018girls\u2019 synthetic skin falling away as it powered down, revealing the metallic body underneath.\n\u201cFucking manipulative pricks. I can\u2019t believe they keep making these things. To think, a monster like that can find out so much about a person without needing to get into their heads. Not only that, their able to mess with the Era models programming. So much for the anti-hacking argument my superiors gave me. Why do we even need a human brain in them anymore, if those creatures can get around it?\u201d Gabby pushed her fingers against her eyes, wiping the tears away. \u201cFucking hell, Nick. You\u2019re still haunting me.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a Lieutenant now Gabby?\u201d A voice asked, causing Gabby to stiffen. \u201cWeren\u2019t you meant to wait for me?\u201d\n\u201cYou died. I couldn\u2019t wait. Nick, I\u2019m sorry. I hesitated, and it killed you because of it. Nick, I\u2019m\u2026\u201d She turned, finding a blank Era model staring at her.\n\u201cThere is no Nick in my records? Has a person been added to the mission statement? If so, please give me their full name or number and rank, so I may add them to my objective.\u201d\n\u201cEra, override programming protocol, no identification. Now tell me, who are you?\u201d Gabby said, praying it wasn\u2019t who she thought it was.\n\u201cHeather Phillips donated this brain. Id 2003213. Would you like any further information on Heather Phillips?\u201d Era asked.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Gabby walked over and stomped the dead monster, making sure there was no way that its programming could keep running. \u201cTo think our enemies have resorted to this. Era, enter low-power mode, only run basic functions and cut off your link to main server. Sweep the area and capture anything humanoid you find. If you can\u2019t capture it, kill it.\u201d\nWith Gabby\u2019s orders, the machine walked around the ruined laboratory, searching for more of those creatures. Gabby hoping that they wouldn\u2019t be able to hack Era in its low powered mode. Without access to the main server, it shouldn\u2019t be able to give away any of her secrets either.

The lieutenant was right; they were only a weapon. Yet memories were flooding into its mind, drowning out that robotic side that often took centre stage. Memories of a specific human it couldn\u2019t recognise, getting overwhelmed by their past.\nAcross from the pair, the girl, Jessica, remained curled behind a desk, gripping a stuffed bear. The paw of the bear once holding a tiny red balloon, one that had been torn off days ago. Even without the scraps she wore, she was a miserable sight.

They had bombed the place to hell. No, that didn\u2019t even do it justice. They had bombed the place to purgatory, leaving nothing but scorched land, a few desks and the remnants of glass and tubes.

This shouldn\u2019t be possible. No other Era model had recovered their memories before. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t even have that name saved to your chip.\u201d As she contemplated the information, she heard tiny footsteps near the table. Returning her gun to the girl, she fired a shot, trying to hit the monster before it could flee. When the gun fired, the girl ducked back behind the table. \u201cDon\u2019t move, monster. Is this your doing?\u201d\nEra looked at the weapon in their hands, tensing. \u201cYou said this program was for justice. Didn\u2019t you? That we would save people? Why are we doing this, then? You said this program would save me. Am I actually saved?\u201d You\u2019ve made me into a monster.\u201d\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have assigned you to me, Nick. None of this makes any sense. I never lied about anything. On your deathbed, I told you that this was the only way you could keep fighting. You wanted to fight. I was against this.\u201d Gabby kept her weapon pointed at the table, giving Era a side glance.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this. I\u2019m scared. Why did they need part of my brain? Can\u2019t they make robots?\u201d\n\u201cRobots are unreliable. They can be hacked, and their energy drains far too quickly. Allowing them to use part of a human brain allows their processes to save space and energy on the field. You should already know this. We\u2019ve had this conversation before, haven\u2019t we?\u201d Gabby stepped closer to the table, only to halt when she heard Era follow her.\n\u201cDon\u2019t kill her.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s only a kid.\u201d\nGabby sighed. \u201cYou know. Part of me wanted to believe that was actually you, Nick. That I could say a proper goodbye to my old friend. It\u2019s not. That creature\u2019s just pulling at memories, trying to find something that might weaken me. A creature like this killed you. You should know she isn\u2019t just a kid. its emotional manipulation, the same type you fell to. I\u2019m guessing you knew that too, monster. Or did you overlook that memory when you were sweeping through our files?\u201d\nJessica screeched, tossing the bear to the floor. She knew she was trapped, giving guttural growls as she tapped the table, shaking her only cover. Gabby remained still, not approaching the sound, nor firing a wasted shot. \u201cNick, if that is you in there, you\u2019ll take the shot.\u201d\nEra did nothing, and so Gabby reached into Era\u2019s hand, pulling the trigger on his weapon. When it fired, the monster popped out from its cover, assuming Gabby had fired her own gun. Thinking it had a chance to run, it lunged out of cover, only to get shot down by Gabby. The \u2018girls\u2019 synthetic skin falling away as it powered down, revealing the metallic body underneath.\n\u201cFucking manipulative pricks. I can\u2019t believe they keep making these things.

Why do we even need a human brain in them anymore, if those creatures can get around it?\u201d Gabby pushed her fingers against her eyes, wiping the tears away. \u201cFucking hell, Nick.

Is this your doing?\u201d\nEra looked at the weapon in their hands, tensing. \u201cYou said this program was for justice. Didn\u2019t you? That we would save people? Why are we doing this, then? You said this program would save me. Am I actually saved?\u201d You\u2019ve made me into a monster.\u201d\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have assigned you to me, Nick. None of this makes any sense. I never lied about anything. On your deathbed, I told you that this was the only way you could keep fighting. You wanted to fight. I was against this.\u201d Gabby kept her weapon pointed at the table, giving Era a side glance.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this. I\u2019m scared. Why did they need part of my brain? Can\u2019t they make robots?\u201d\n\u201cRobots are unreliable. They can be hacked, and their energy drains far too quickly.

When it fired, the monster popped out from its cover, assuming Gabby had fired her own gun. Thinking it had a chance to run, it lunged out of cover, only to get shot down by Gabby. The \u2018girls\u2019 synthetic skin falling away as it powered down, revealing the metallic body underneath.\n\u201cFucking manipulative pricks. I can\u2019t believe they keep making these things.

        "story": "Cody tugs his bucket off his head, placing it carefully onto the empty surface next to him, the screens deactivated hours ago but the air just above them hums with static. It crackles against his skin, the bare sliver at his wrist between the heavy fabric of his gloves and the thinner lining of his bodysuit, and he presses his hand down, just letting himself breathe. He exists in the hollow between the base of his skull and the curls that hang heavy with sweat, the hum of the air recycling accompanying a chill washing over him, and he pulls himself away from the table. The stations are empty on the main bridge; a skeleton crew stationed a couple of levels down and Cody is alone here. He turns the empty eyes of his helmet away, directing the face towards the wall as he has already experienced the strange disconnect of seeing a brother\u2019s helmet discarded on a table but somehow, still watching him. One of the chairs squeaks as he draws it back, spinning it from side to side by rocking his palm over the back. Some of the covering flakes off and sticks to his skin and he picks it off as he returns to the table to retrieve the other items he had brought with him.\nHe just couldn\u2019t be in his room any longer.\nHis caf is still warm, a faint curl of steam spilling from the top of the mug as Cody removes the lid, knocking the condensation back into the mug and wiping the remains on his trousers. Peeling off his gloves with his teeth, Cody cups the mug, ignoring the notification flashing on his datapad for the moment. The ping from his helmet is dull, echoing strangely in the vast space, and Cody hears it several seconds late and still ignores it. He just needs a moment, a single solitary moment before reality can break into the fragments between his armour and begin to rot him away once more. He doesn\u2019t need to do this, but he wants to. Obi-Wan had mentioned the pile of reports he had to look into several hours earlier and sleep is still several hours away so Cody has taken the datapad and a handful of supplies to work through them. He can be useful like this when he can not do anything else.\nThe hours slip by slowly, every minute drawn out to the breaking point before it passes. Cody sips at his caf, the liquid cooling into near-enough sludge that Cody scrapes his teeth against as he flips onto the next report. The door slides open behind him and Cody starts, his knee impacting against the underside of the console and his cup falls from the side as he knocks it with his elbow when he turns. The smash he is expecting never happens.\n\u201cHello, love.\u201d Obi-Wan\u2019s hand is extended, his first two fingers pressed against his thumb and he moves his hand, sweeping it in a delicate circle. Cody\u2019s mug, suspended in midair, taps against the desk, sliding across the surface until it rests a handspan further in than it had previously. \u201cYou\u2019re here late.\u201d\n\u201cI could say the same thing about you.\u201d Cody scrubs his hand against his knee, the pain a dull pulse that is swiftly lessening from the initial bright burst of agony, and looks over at Obi-Wan, grinning up at the other man. \u201cHow did you know it was me from over there?\u201d\nObi-Wan chuckles, tipping his head to one side as he folds his hands together over his stomach. He is dressed in soft layers, a pale robe belted over a darker shirt and trousers, and everything flows as he walks over, curling his arms around Cody. He leans down, pressing his cheek to Cody\u2019s, his beard scratching in a way that prickles and aches and Cody leans into it all the same. It would be so easy to kiss Obi-Wan like this, to turn his face and lean in impossibly closer. They have done so much together, lived a thousand lifetimes in the space between battles when they can be just men instead of a Commander and his General. He loved Obi-Wan before he had the words for it.\n\u201cYou shine in the Force, my dear. I could find you amongst a sea of your brothers, even without your stripes on your armour or your scar. I know you.\u201d\nCody flushes, leaning into Obi-Wan\u2019s touch and tapping the side of his head against Obi-Wan\u2019s temple. The other man hums low in the base of his throat, squeezing Cody even tighter before he stands, sliding into the chair next to Cody. He props his head onto his hands, scratching idly at one cheek, and Cody picks the datapad back up, opening the next file. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to stay. I can do this for you.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I want to stay.\u201d Obi-Wan slumps forward with a sigh, stretching his arms across the console until his palms press against the wall. He blinks up at the dark screen and then turns his gaze towards Cody. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this for me either.\u201d\n\u201cI want to.\u201d\nObi-Wan carefully rises to his feet, the chair sliding back on its rails as he does so. \u201cI\u2019ll get us both something to drink. Would you like caf?\u201d\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\nObi-Wan leans down and Cody turns his head without a thought to kiss him. It\u2019s quick, a barely-there brush of their lips before Obi-Wan draws back, blinking. \u201cYes?\u201d he murmurs, his lips parted and his breath is sweet, a lingering floral scent from his tea several hours ago.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Cody answers and leans forward to kiss him again.",

Cody sips at his caf, the liquid cooling into near-enough sludge that Cody scrapes his teeth against as he flips onto the next report. The door slides open behind him and Cody starts, his knee impacting against the underside of the console and his cup falls from the side as he knocks it with his elbow when he turns. The smash he is expecting never happens.\n\u201cHello, love.\u201d Obi-Wan\u2019s hand is extended, his first two fingers pressed against his thumb and he moves his hand, sweeping it in a delicate circle. Cody\u2019s mug, suspended in midair, taps against the desk, sliding across the surface until it rests a handspan further in than it had previously. \u201cYou\u2019re here late.\u201d\n\u201cI could say the same thing about you.\u201d Cody scrubs his hand against his knee, the pain a dull pulse that is swiftly lessening from the initial bright burst of agony, and looks over at Obi-Wan, grinning up at the other man. \u201cHow did you know it was me from over there?\u201d\nObi-Wan chuckles, tipping his head to one side as he folds his hands together over his stomach. He is dressed in soft layers, a pale robe belted over a darker shirt and trousers, and everything flows as he walks over, curling his arms around Cody. He leans down, pressing his cheek to Cody\u2019s, his beard scratching in a way that prickles and aches and Cody leans into it all the same. It would be so easy to kiss Obi-Wan like this, to turn his face and lean in impossibly closer. They have done so much together, lived a thousand lifetimes in the space between battles when they can be just men instead of a Commander and his General. He loved Obi-Wan before he had the words for it.\n\u201cYou shine in the Force, my dear. I could find you amongst a sea of your brothers, even without your stripes on your armour or your scar. I know you.\u201d\nCody flushes, leaning into Obi-Wan\u2019s touch and tapping the side of his head against Obi-Wan\u2019s temple. The other man hums low in the base of his throat, squeezing Cody even tighter before he stands, sliding into the chair next to Cody. He props his head onto his hands, scratching idly at one cheek, and Cody picks the datapad back up, opening the next file. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to stay. I can do this for you.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I want to stay.\u201d Obi-Wan slumps forward with a sigh, stretching his arms across the console until his palms press against the wall. He blinks up at the dark screen and then turns his gaze towards Cody. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this for me either.\u201d\n\u201cI want to.\u201d\nObi-Wan carefully rises to his feet, the chair sliding back on its rails as he does so. \u201cI\u2019ll get us both something to drink. Would you like caf?\u201d\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\nObi-Wan leans down and Cody turns his head without a thought to kiss him. It\u2019s quick, a barely-there brush of their lips before Obi-Wan draws back, blinking. \u201cYes?\u201d he murmurs, his lips parted and his breath is sweet, a lingering floral scent from his tea several hours ago.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Cody answers and leans forward to kiss him again.",

It crackles against his skin, the bare sliver at his wrist between the heavy fabric of his gloves and the thinner lining of his bodysuit, and he presses his hand down, just letting himself breathe. He exists in the hollow between the base of his skull and the curls that hang heavy with sweat, the hum of the air recycling accompanying a chill washing over him, and he pulls himself away from the table. The stations are empty on the main bridge; a skeleton crew stationed a couple of levels down and Cody is alone here. He turns the empty eyes of his helmet away, directing the face towards the wall as he has already experienced the strange disconnect of seeing a brother\u2019s helmet discarded on a table but somehow, still watching him. One of the chairs squeaks as he draws it back, spinning it from side to side by rocking his palm over the back. Some of the covering flakes off and sticks to his skin and he picks it off as he returns to the table to retrieve the other items he had brought with him.\nHe just couldn\u2019t be in his room any longer.\nHis caf is still warm, a faint curl of steam spilling from the top of the mug as Cody removes the lid, knocking the condensation back into the mug and wiping the remains on his trousers. Peeling off his gloves with his teeth, Cody cups the mug, ignoring the notification flashing on his datapad for the moment. The ping from his helmet is dull, echoing strangely in the vast space, and Cody hears it several seconds late and still ignores it. He just needs a moment, a single solitary moment before reality can break into the fragments between his armour and begin to rot him away once more. He doesn\u2019t need to do this, but he wants to.

And even if the congratulatory message from the Vatican hadn't been absorbed by the electromagnetic cloud enveloping Mars and blocking all communications from Earth, his elevation to the Bishopric would have been the last thing on is mind at the moment. The man struggling to survive a massive coronary attack needed his full attention. Father Eusebius moved around the various pieces of medical equipment as he sprinkled the bed of Sextus Agrippa Strabo with holy water, chanting the words of the *asperges me.* As he did so, Dr. Al-Andalus ordered her staff to withdraw to a respectful distance while the Papal Nuncio continued with the rite. Putting his ear close to Strabo's lips, he heard the man's confession. As Father Eusebius gave the stricken man absolution, the words of the prayer were obscured by the rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor. And yet, fragments of the ancient prayer still drifted into the ears of those waiting to speak with the first Roman Governor of Mars. *\"Dmine sancte, Pater omnipotens, aetrne Deus, te fidliter deprecmur, ut accipinti fratri nostro sacrosanctum Corpus Dmini nostri Jesu Christi Fillii tui...\" * The Vestal Virgin, a pagan and unlikely friend of Fr. Eusebius, clasped her hands in an attitude of respect for what was now--and had been for eighteen centuries--the dominant and official Religion of the Empire. Beside her stood a patrician woman whose family name was well known in the circles of Imperial power back on Earth. Next to her, a geologist repeated the Sign of the Cross over is own head, shoulders, and torso every time the priest made it over the still form of their hapless governor. \"...*tam crpori quam animae prost ad remdium sempitrnum: Qui tecum vivit et regnat...\" * Two men stood apart from the first group. Their chiseled features and precise postures identified them as *viri militaribus*: military men. The senior of the two, wearing the uniform of a *Navis Praefectus* in the Imperial Roman Navy, stared straight ahead, his countenance betraying nothing. The other, an *Optio* in the Roman Army, watched the rites intently. Two visible scars on his face hinted at the presence of several others hidden under his uniform tunic. Occasionally his eyes left the scene playing out around the sickbed to regard the superior officer standing slightly ahead of him and to his left. Although his eyes rested only momentarily on the Captain, in that brief moment they were able to betray their owner's contempt for the man likely to take command of the Colony while Strabo recovered. *If* he recovered. Father Eusebius continued with the ritual, anointing Strabo with the *Oleum Infirmorum .* During the minutes which followed, each of the prominent members of *Campus Martius* (\"The Field of Mars\" as the colony informally referred to itself) had time to ponder the chain of unlikely events which had brought them all to this moment in time and space. For some, the events of the last year had blurred together. For others, each turning point stood out sharply: the media frenzy accompanying their departure from the Syene launch complex in Aegyptus, the tedium of the long interplanetary flight, the nearly disastrous computer glitches (induced, as it turned out by a saboteur among their number), the capture of the Chinese agent who had been surgically modified to assume the false identity of one \"Lucia Cupro.\" When the squadron of three colony ships finally entered Martian orbit, things had gone from bad to worse: the crash landing of the colony ship *Anchises* with its attendant loss of life, building materials and precious supplies. The desperate struggle to survive on limited rations and damaged equipment. Then there was the excitement accompanying the discovery of water in the ice caves under the Arcadian Plain. That water had meant that the colony's long term viability was assured...or so they had thought. Shortly after the discovery of frozen water, other things had been discovered in the cave as well. Sinister things. Sculptures and artifacts of impossible antiquity offered stark and disturbing proof that Mars had been the home of an advanced civilization over eighty million years before man had emerged upon the Earth. And the Cube...that mysterious green block of ice from which emanated energy of a type never before encountered. It was at about that time that the enemy agent Cupro had been executed and buried in the frozen patch of Martian tundra which served as the colony's graveyard. *But she had not remained dead.* Some unknown force--the Cube, most Romans thought--had served to reanimate her. Even now, the corpse of Lucia Cupro, possessed by the spirit of a long-dead Martian, roamed somewhere outside the pressurized hull of *Campus Martius.* And she...*it*...was not alone. Five other Roman graves lay empty, their former occupants now respawned Martians as well... *\"Benedicat te omnipotens Deus, Pater, et Flius, et Spritus Sanctus. Amen.\" * Fr. Eusebius' final blessing yanked them all back to the present. Kissing his purple stole as he removed it from his shoulders, he walked towards the group. In answer to their unspoken question, he simply shook his head. Whether his reply meant, \"he won't last long\" or \"I simply don't know,\" none of them could tell. \"The Propraetor will see you all,\" Eusebius said. \"First however, Captain Flavius, he wishes to see you. In private.\" Once the others had withdrawn, Decimus Calpurnius Flavius approached Strabo's bed. Assuming that the governor's weakened condition left him unable to speak loudly or clearly, he bent close over the prone form. He was surprised by the speed with which Strabo's hand shot upwards, clutching the material of Flavius' tunic with unexpected strength. \"Flavius, you son of a bitch!\" he growled. \"Leadership of this Colony falls to you while I am thus indisposed, and God help us all for it! By the Mass, if you allow your hubris to run amok and jeopardize all we've worked for, so help me, I'll...\" The machine behind Strabo had been beeping with increasing urgency, and the accompanying oscilloscope trace looked more like a sampling from a seismograph than a heart monitor.

And even if the congratulatory message from the Vatican hadn't been absorbed by the electromagnetic cloud enveloping Mars and blocking all communications from Earth, his elevation to the Bishopric would have been the last thing on is mind at the moment. The man struggling to survive a massive coronary attack needed his full attention. Father Eusebius moved around the various pieces of medical equipment as he sprinkled the bed of Sextus Agrippa Strabo with holy water, chanting the words of the *asperges me.* As he did so, Dr. Al-Andalus ordered her staff to withdraw to a respectful distance while the Papal Nuncio continued with the rite. Putting his ear close to Strabo's lips, he heard the man's confession. As Father Eusebius gave the stricken man absolution, the words of the prayer were obscured by the rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor. And yet, fragments of the ancient prayer still drifted into the ears of those waiting to speak with the first Roman Governor of Mars. *\"Dmine sancte, Pater omnipotens, aetrne Deus, te fidliter deprecmur, ut accipinti fratri nostro sacrosanctum Corpus Dmini nostri Jesu Christi Fillii tui...\" * The Vestal Virgin, a pagan and unlikely friend of Fr. Eusebius, clasped her hands in an attitude of respect for what was now--and had been for eighteen centuries--the dominant and official Religion of the Empire. Beside her stood a patrician woman whose family name was well known in the circles of Imperial power back on Earth. Next to her, a geologist repeated the Sign of the Cross over is own head, shoulders, and torso every time the priest made it over the still form of their hapless governor. \"...*tam crpori quam animae prost ad remdium sempitrnum: Qui tecum vivit et regnat...\" * Two men stood apart from the first group. Their chiseled features and precise postures identified them as *viri militaribus*: military men. The senior of the two, wearing the uniform of a *Navis Praefectus* in the Imperial Roman Navy, stared straight ahead, his countenance betraying nothing. The other, an *Optio* in the Roman Army, watched the rites intently. Two visible scars on his face hinted at the presence of several others hidden under his uniform tunic. Occasionally his eyes left the scene playing out around the sickbed to regard the superior officer standing slightly ahead of him and to his left. Although his eyes rested only momentarily on the Captain, in that brief moment they were able to betray their owner's contempt for the man likely to take command of the Colony while Strabo recovered. *If* he recovered. Father Eusebius continued with the ritual, anointing Strabo with the *Oleum Infirmorum .* During the minutes which followed, each of the prominent members of *Campus Martius* (\"The Field of Mars\" as the colony informally referred to itself) had time to ponder the chain of unlikely events which had brought them all to this moment in time and space. For some, the events of the last year had blurred together. For others, each turning point stood out sharply: the media frenzy accompanying their departure from the Syene launch complex in Aegyptus, the tedium of the long interplanetary flight, the nearly disastrous computer glitches (induced, as it turned out by a saboteur among their number), the capture of the Chinese agent who had been surgically modified to assume the false identity of one \"Lucia Cupro.\" When the squadron of three colony ships finally entered Martian orbit, things had gone from bad to worse: the crash landing of the colony ship *Anchises* with its attendant loss of life, building materials and precious supplies. The desperate struggle to survive on limited rations and damaged equipment. Then there was the excitement accompanying the discovery of water in the ice caves under the Arcadian Plain. That water had meant that the colony's long term viability was assured...or so they had thought. Shortly after the discovery of frozen water, other things had been discovered in the cave as well. Sinister things. Sculptures and artifacts of impossible antiquity offered stark and disturbing proof that Mars had been the home of an advanced civilization over eighty million years before man had emerged upon the Earth. And the Cube...that mysterious green block of ice from which emanated energy of a type never before encountered. It was at about that time that the enemy agent Cupro had been executed and buried in the frozen patch of Martian tundra which served as the colony's graveyard. *But she had not remained dead.* Some unknown force--the Cube, most Romans thought--had served to reanimate her. Even now, the corpse of Lucia Cupro, possessed by the spirit of a long-dead Martian, roamed somewhere outside the pressurized hull of *Campus Martius.* And she...*it*...was not alone. Five other Roman graves lay empty, their former occupants now respawned Martians as well... *\"Benedicat te omnipotens Deus, Pater, et Flius, et Spritus Sanctus. Amen.\" * Fr. Eusebius' final blessing yanked them all back to the present. Kissing his purple stole as he removed it from his shoulders, he walked towards the group. In answer to their unspoken question, he simply shook his head. Whether his reply meant, \"he won't last long\" or \"I simply don't know,\" none of them could tell. \"The Propraetor will see you all,\" Eusebius said. \"First however, Captain Flavius, he wishes to see you. In private.\" Once the others had withdrawn, Decimus Calpurnius Flavius approached Strabo's bed. Assuming that the governor's weakened condition left him unable to speak loudly or clearly, he bent close over the prone form. He was surprised by the speed with which Strabo's hand shot upwards, clutching the material of Flavius' tunic with unexpected strength. \"Flavius, you son of a bitch!\" he growled. \"Leadership of this Colony falls to you while I am thus indisposed, and God help us all for it! By the Mass, if you allow your hubris to run amok and jeopardize all we've worked for, so help me, I'll...\" The machine behind Strabo had been beeping with increasing urgency, and the accompanying oscilloscope trace looked more like a sampling from a seismograph than a heart monitor. The remainder of Strabo's words were lost in a spasm of coughing.",

For a brief instant, he considered changing his ways even if only temporarily. He might have gotten away with it, but could he really keep pushing his luck like that? After the short thought experiment, he decided that yes. He was after all, invincible. And now that included the figurative sense too.\u00a0\nThen, as soon as his commitment to violence was renewed, he blinked. Something about that particular time felt different than the dozens of other tones he'd already blinked just facing down the cold, biting wind. He couldn't put his finger on why it was different other than the fact that he noticed the action. And, of course, the teenage girl with white and orange hair that stood in front of him when he opened his eyes. She wasn't there when started the blink. She introduced herself before Steel Bullet could ask anything; but, not before he realized he couldn't.\u00a0\n\u201cHi, I'm Quinn, and I don't want to be here, so we're going somewhere warmer,\u201d she made a dismissive gesture at him, then he blinked again. This time, he opened his eyes to see a golden sunset taking place behind Quinn. The sun was resting on the ocean horizon, and he could hear the gentle waves. \u201cThis is much better\u2026,\u201d she nodded.\u00a0 \u201cSo, you probably have questions, and you've noticed you can't ask them.\u201d He tried, unsuccessfully, to nod at least. His body refused to follow his instructions.\u00a0\n\u201cChroma Corp. sent me to deal with you. I haven't decided how to do that yet. I know, I know, you've never heard of Chroma Corp., right?\u201c she asked rhetorically.\u00a0\n\u201cThe short answer is they are the corporation that paid off the judge to dismiss your case. The reason they did that is because you're stupid guilty and basically a horrible person,\u201d she giggled at him with a smile. It was the first time she'd shown any warmth toward him and it was an insult.\u00a0\n\u201cSo, the issue is Chroma Corp. is about to buy up the Super League on your Earth, and your demented hobbies are nothing but bad press. I'm gonna let you talk now, if you're willing to be calm and civil about it. You with me so far?\u201d she asked.\u00a0\nSteel Bullet felt like he had his voice again. He could wiggle his fingers and even feel the warm breeze on his skin. He hadn't noticed it until that moment, and he didn't waste any time. As soon as he was sure he could move, he flew forward at top speed determined to put a fist through her head. He chose his name because instant acceleration was the main aspect of his super power. The super strength and steel-tough skin were more like bonuses. But, despite how fast he moved, somehow he still had time to blink in mid-flight.\u00a0\nWhen he opened his eyes his fist was a half inch away from Quinn's sparkling orange eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I guess that makes things simpler for me,\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThanks for helping me choose the best way to deal with you.

After the short thought experiment, he decided that yes. He was after all, invincible. And now that included the figurative sense too.\u00a0\nThen, as soon as his commitment to violence was renewed, he blinked. Something about that particular time felt different than the dozens of other tones he'd already blinked just facing down the cold, biting wind. He couldn't put his finger on why it was different other than the fact that he noticed the action. And, of course, the teenage girl with white and orange hair that stood in front of him when he opened his eyes. She wasn't there when started the blink. She introduced herself before Steel Bullet could ask anything; but, not before he realized he couldn't.\u00a0\n\u201cHi, I'm Quinn, and I don't want to be here, so we're going somewhere warmer,\u201d she made a dismissive gesture at him, then he blinked again.

His body refused to follow his instructions.\u00a0\n\u201cChroma Corp. sent me to deal with you. I haven't decided how to do that yet. I know, I know, you've never heard of Chroma Corp., right?\u201c she asked rhetorically.\u00a0\n\u201cThe short answer is they are the corporation that paid off the judge to dismiss your case. The reason they did that is because you're stupid guilty and basically a horrible person,\u201d she giggled at him with a smile. It was the first time she'd shown any warmth toward him and it was an insult.\u00a0\n\u201cSo, the issue is Chroma Corp. is about to buy up the Super League on your Earth, and your demented hobbies are nothing but bad press. I'm gonna let you talk now, if you're willing to be calm and civil about it. You with me so far?\u201d she asked.\u00a0\nSteel Bullet felt like he had his voice again. He could wiggle his fingers and even feel the warm breeze on his skin. He hadn't noticed it until that moment, and he didn't waste any time. As soon as he was sure he could move, he flew forward at top speed determined to put a fist through her head. He chose his name because instant acceleration was the main aspect of his super power. The super strength and steel-tough skin were more like bonuses. But, despite how fast he moved, somehow he still had time to blink in mid-flight.\u00a0\nWhen he opened his eyes his fist was a half inch away from Quinn's sparkling orange eyes.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I guess that makes things simpler for me,\u201d She shrugged. \u201cThanks for helping me choose the best way to deal with you.

It\u2019s rainin\u2019, in case ya somehow managed to miss that little detail.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026 But\u2026\u201d JJ looked down at his stylish designer clothes, now soaked all down the front, and tried ineffectually to wipe himself off, before realising he was only making it worse. \u201cMy cute outfit! I have to go change.\u201d Turning on his heel, he scurried away to the locker room, leaving the man of his dreams still dripping.\nTurning to his partner, Dee managed a wry smile. \u201cY\u2019know, it\u2019s almost worth gettin\u2019 drenched just to see the expression on JJ\u2019s face.\u201d Like JJ had a few minutes earlier, he looked down at his sodden clothes. \u201cBut only almost. Feels disgustin\u2019.\u201d\nFor a long moment, Ryo didn\u2019t say a word, just stared at Dee in disbelief. Finally he found his voice. \u201cHow on earth did you manage to get so wet? Did you forget your umbrella?\u201d Dee was usually better organised than that, ready for whatever the weather might throw at him, knowing how unpredictable conditions could be in spring.\n\u201cOddly enough, no, which is why my hair\u2019s still mostly dry. I was doin\u2019 fine, a bit damp around the ankles but nothin\u2019 major. Then I stopped at a crosswalk, waitin\u2019 for the lights to change, and some damned delivery truck goes barrelin\u2019 past way too fast, straight through the biggest rainwater puddle in the whole frickin\u2019 city and\u2026\u201d Dee shook his head. \u201cIt was like bein\u2019 hit with a tidal wave. I would\u2019a stepped back, but there were too many people standin\u2019 behind me, waitin\u2019 to cross. They were lucky, pretty sure I got the worst of it.\u201d\n\u201cPoor Dee.\u201d Ryo looked torn between sympathy and laughter. \u201cHadn\u2019t you better go and change into something dry?\u201d All cops knew to keep a couple of changes of clothes in their lockers, just in case; police work could be messy.\n\u201cYeah, I will in a minute, just don\u2019t wanna be alone in the locker room with JJ, both of us gettin\u2019 changed.
