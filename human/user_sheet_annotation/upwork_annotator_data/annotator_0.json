        "writing_prompt": "After weeks of enduring Umbridge's cruel detentions, Harry's hand refuses to heal, and Snape unexpectedly takes notice. What happens when the professor's sharp tongue is paired with an uncharacteristic act of care?",
        "story": "In the stillness and silence of Umbridge's office, Harry sat writing his lines. All that could be heard was the scratching of the Quill and the occasional meowing of Umbridge's cat portraits. Harry almost felt like he was in a dream, about to wake up soon.\nAlmost. The pain in his hand stopped him from falling into the dreamlike state completely. A pity, as perhaps the time would pass faster.\n\u201cThat will do.\u201d\nHarry dropped the quill with a silent sigh of relief, resisting the urge to clutch his injured hand. Umbridge held out her hand for her usual inspection, and Harry offered it, eager to be done. His bed in the dorm was like a siren, calling him to fall into the nothingness it brought.\n\u201cSame time tomorrow,\u201d Umbridge said, and Harry had a sudden urge to punch the smile off her face permanently. Almost as If she could hear his thoughts, her smile widened. \u201cAfter all, it hasn't sunk in just yet, has it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Professor.\u201d\nFinally, his hand was released, and Harry grabbed his bag and dragged himself out of the office and to Gryffindor Tower.\n\u201cThere you are! She kept you for much longer than usual, didn't she?\u201d\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Harry said tiredly, dropping into a chair in front of the fire. The usual bowl of dittany sat on the table, and Harry soaked his hand gratefully. Hermione watched anxiously.\n\u201cIt's still not healing properly.\u201d\n\u201cBetter than nothing,\u201d Ron said. \u201cYou can't risk Snape again, Hermione.\u201d\n\u201cAgain?\u201d\nHermione turned pink. \u201cI wanted to see if there was something stronger than dittany in Professor Snape's stores, but\u2014 well, he caught me.\u201d\n\u201cOh no! What happened?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, actually. He told me that the only reason Dittany wouldn't be working was if something was preventing it, and\n\u2018I'd better not hear you have been using Dark Magic, Granger.\u2019\n\u201d\n\u201cNo detention?\u201d Harry asked disbelievingly.\nHermione shrugged. \u201cI still don't understand what is wrong with dittany. We know the quill is not the problem as it was healing before. Why isn't it now?\u201d\n\u201cIt works enough,\u201d Harry mumbled, eyes closed. \u201cEnough for me to be able to\u2026\u201d\nHe was asleep before he finished the sentence.\nWhen Harry woke up, the bowl of dittany had fallen to the floor and there was an awful crick in his neck. His hand was throbbing dully and he lifted it up to look at it with bleary eyes.\nThe words were swollen and disfigured, and Harry could only make them out because he knew what it said. Harry touched it slightly and hissed at the burn, dropping his hand. Firmly pushing it out of his mind, he picked up the bag that he'd dropped the night before and settled down to do his homework. He doubted he would manage to finish even one essay, but he couldn't bring himself to care.\nHe changed his mind later that morning as he looked up at Snape's angry eyes.\n\u201cDetention, Potter. After dinner.\u201d\n\u201cCan't,\u201d Harry said. \u201cGot detention with Umbridge.\u201d\nSnape's lips thinned. \u201cAfter, then. Or is that too late for Mr. Celebrity?\u201d\nHarry could have argued that he did need to sleep, but he just didn't have the energy. Instead, he just nodded and started on his potion, ignoring Hermione's furious inquiries.\nAfter dinner found Harry back in Umbridge's office. It had been two hours, and Harry was dreading the long detention still ahead of him when Umbridge spoke.\n\u201cThat will do.\u201d\nHarry looked up in surprise. Umbridge had a sour look on her face that reminded him of Aunt Petunia.\n\u201cProfessor Snape could not find any other time for your detention, but you\nwill\nmake it up to me, Mr. Potter.\u201d\nHarry squashed down his disgust. \u201cOf course, Professor.\u201d\nHardly believing his luck, Harry started the long trek to the dungeons. Why did Snape's office have to be so far away?\nFinally, Snape's door appeared, and Harry lifted a heavy hand to knock on it.\n\u201cCome in!\u201d\nHarry pushed the door open with considerable effort.\n\u201cYou are late, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cJust back from detention,\u201d Harry said, too tired to glare. There were a few dozen cauldrons stacked in the corner, and Harry headed for them, before Snape's voice stopped him in his tracks.\n\u201cDid I say you were to do cauldrons?\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry turned to Snape. \u201cWhat am I going to do then?\u201d\n\u201cLines.\u201d Snape smiled cruelly.\nHarry stared. Since when did Snape have him do lines?\n\u201cWell?\u201d Snape snapped. \u201cGet on with it.\u201d\nFeeling like he was dreaming again, Harry sat down on the chair. Thankfully, the quill besides the parchment was a regular quill.\n\u201cWhat should I write?\u201d\n\u201cWhat should I write, Sir?\u201d\n\u201cI must do my homework on time.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Harry bent down to begin his lines, but he could still feel Snape\u2019s eyes on him.\n\u201cWhat is wrong with your hand, Potter?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry asked, confused. \u201cNothing.\u201d\nHe put the quill down and held up his hand for emphasis.\nSnape's brow furrowed. \u201cDo you think me a fool? Other hand.\u201d\nHarry reluctantly opened the left hand towards Snape, palm up. Snape yanked at it and turned it over, and Harry winced.\nIt looked even worse than it had in the morning. The whole area was bright red so that the harsh words couldn't be seen anymore, and bright yellow splotches were visible.\n\u201cHave you tried dittany?\u201d\nHarry looked back at Snape\u2019s sharp voice. He looked even angrier than normal, which was saying something.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry shrugged. It worked in the beginning, but slowly it just\u2014 stopped.\u201d\n\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d Snape asked, summoning a jar. Harry caught sight of the label as it flew into Snape's hand \u2014\nAntibacterial Aloe Cream.\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Harry said. \u201cA month, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cAre you feeling cold? Or feverish?\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry muttered, looking at Snape's desk. He felt exposed, and if his hand hadn't been so tightly held by Snape, he might have run off.\nFinally, Snape released his hand and drew his wand. Harry tensed.\n\u201cA diagnostic Charm.\u201d\nSnape waved his wand and Harry felt a warmth spread through him, which left as quickly as it had come.\n\u201cHow shocking. You have an infection.

She kept you for much longer than usual, didn't she?\u201d\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Harry said tiredly, dropping into a chair in front of the fire. The usual bowl of dittany sat on the table, and Harry soaked his hand gratefully.

What happened?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, actually. He told me that the only reason Dittany wouldn't be working was if something was preventing it, and\n\u2018I'd better not hear you have been using Dark Magic, Granger.\u2019\n\u201d\n\u201cNo detention?\u201d Harry asked disbelievingly.\nHermione shrugged. \u201cI still don't understand what is wrong with dittany. We know the quill is not the problem as it was healing before. Why isn't it now?\u201d\n\u201cIt works enough,\u201d Harry mumbled, eyes closed. \u201cEnough for me to be able to\u2026\u201d\nHe was asleep before he finished the sentence.\nWhen Harry woke up, the bowl of dittany had fallen to the floor and there was an awful crick in his neck. His hand was throbbing dully and he lifted it up to look at it with bleary eyes.\nThe words were swollen and disfigured, and Harry could only make them out because he knew what it said. Harry touched it slightly and hissed at the burn, dropping his hand. Firmly pushing it out of his mind, he picked up the bag that he'd dropped the night before and settled down to do his homework. He doubted he would manage to finish even one essay, but he couldn't bring himself to care.\nHe changed his mind later that morning as he looked up at Snape's angry eyes.\n\u201cDetention, Potter. After dinner.\u201d\n\u201cCan't,\u201d Harry said. \u201cGot detention with Umbridge.\u201d\nSnape's lips thinned. \u201cAfter, then. Or is that too late for Mr. Celebrity?\u201d\nHarry could have argued that he did need to sleep, but he just didn't have the energy. Instead, he just nodded and started on his potion, ignoring Hermione's furious inquiries.\nAfter dinner found Harry back in Umbridge's office. It had been two hours, and Harry was dreading the long detention still ahead of him when Umbridge spoke.\n\u201cThat will do.\u201d\nHarry looked up in surprise. Umbridge had a sour look on her face that reminded him of Aunt Petunia.\n\u201cProfessor Snape could not find any other time for your detention, but you\nwill\nmake it up to me, Mr. Potter.\u201d\nHarry squashed down his disgust. \u201cOf course, Professor.\u201d\nHardly believing his luck, Harry started the long trek to the dungeons. Why did Snape's office have to be so far away?\nFinally, Snape's door appeared, and Harry lifted a heavy hand to knock on it.\n\u201cCome in!\u201d\nHarry pushed the door open with considerable effort.\n\u201cYou are late, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cJust back from detention,\u201d Harry said, too tired to glare. There were a few dozen cauldrons stacked in the corner, and Harry headed for them, before Snape's voice stopped him in his tracks.\n\u201cDid I say you were to do cauldrons?\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry turned to Snape. \u201cWhat am I going to do then?\u201d\n\u201cLines.\u201d Snape smiled cruelly.\nHarry stared. Since when did Snape have him do lines?\n\u201cWell?\u201d Snape snapped. \u201cGet on with it.\u201d\nFeeling like he was dreaming again, Harry sat down on the chair. Thankfully, the quill besides the parchment was a regular quill.\n\u201cWhat should I write?\u201d\n\u201cWhat should I write, Sir?\u201d\n\u201cI must do my homework on time.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Harry bent down to begin his lines, but he could still feel Snape\u2019s eyes on him.\n\u201cWhat is wrong with your hand, Potter?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry asked, confused. \u201cNothing.\u201d\nHe put the quill down and held up his hand for emphasis.\nSnape's brow furrowed. \u201cDo you think me a fool? Other hand.\u201d\nHarry reluctantly opened the left hand towards Snape, palm up. Snape yanked at it and turned it over, and Harry winced.\nIt looked even worse than it had in the morning. The whole area was bright red so that the harsh words couldn't be seen anymore, and bright yellow splotches were visible.\n\u201cHave you tried dittany?\u201d\nHarry looked back at Snape\u2019s sharp voice. He looked even angrier than normal, which was saying something.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry shrugged. It worked in the beginning, but slowly it just\u2014 stopped.\u201d\n\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d Snape asked, summoning a jar. Harry caught sight of the label as it flew into Snape's hand \u2014\nAntibacterial Aloe Cream.\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Harry said. \u201cA month, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cAre you feeling cold? Or feverish?\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry muttered, looking at Snape's desk. He felt exposed, and if his hand hadn't been so tightly held by Snape, he might have run off.\nFinally, Snape released his hand and drew his wand. Harry tensed.\n\u201cA diagnostic Charm.\u201d\nSnape waved his wand and Harry felt a warmth spread through him, which left as quickly as it had come.\n\u201cHow shocking. You have an infection. When did you last eat?\u201d\n\u201cDinner,\u201d Harry mumbled.\n\u201cLet me define eating, then. It refers to the act of putting food in your mouth, chewing, and swallowing it.

Other hand.\u201d\nHarry reluctantly opened the left hand towards Snape, palm up. Snape yanked at it and turned it over, and Harry winced.\nIt looked even worse than it had in the morning. The whole area was bright red so that the harsh words couldn't be seen anymore, and bright yellow splotches were visible.\n\u201cHave you tried dittany?\u201d\nHarry looked back at Snape\u2019s sharp voice. He looked even angrier than normal, which was saying something.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry shrugged. It worked in the beginning, but slowly it just\u2014 stopped.\u201d\n\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d Snape asked, summoning a jar. Harry caught sight of the label as it flew into Snape's hand \u2014\nAntibacterial Aloe Cream.\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Harry said. \u201cA month, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cAre you feeling cold? Or feverish?\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry muttered, looking at Snape's desk. He felt exposed, and if his hand hadn't been so tightly held by Snape, he might have run off.\nFinally, Snape released his hand and drew his wand. Harry tensed.\n\u201cA diagnostic Charm.\u201d\nSnape waved his wand and Harry felt a warmth spread through him, which left as quickly as it had come.\n\u201cHow shocking. You have an infection. When did you last eat?\u201d\n\u201cDinner,\u201d Harry mumbled.\n\u201cLet me define eating, then. It refers to the act of putting food in your mouth, chewing, and swallowing it. Keeping that in mind, when did you last eat?\u201d\nHarry shrugged, going red with embarrassment.\nSnape sighed. \u201cYou have detention every day \u2014\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d Harry protested, his anger flaring up. \u201cWhat for?!\u201d\n\u201c\u2014 After dinner,\u201d Snape continued, speaking over him. \u201cYou have been unnaturally disruptive, and this is the only time I can spare out of my busy day to oversee your detentions.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Oh,\u201d Harry said, understanding. \u201cAlright, thanks.\u201d\n\u201cDo not thank me, Potter. The Wizarding World would self-destruct if they were to lose their celebrity. It is entirely self-interest, I assure you.\u201d\nHarry stared. Harry might be feeling hazy, but he was sure Snape had just made a joke.\n\u201cNow,\u201d Snape said, summoning a vial. \u201cA mouthful every morning and evening. Now get to bed, immediately.\u201d\n\u201cThe detention,\u201d Harry protested.\nSnape raised an eyebrow. \u201cDo you want to write lines?\u201d\nHarry blushed. \u201cNot particularly.\u201d\n\u201cThen get out of my sight.\u201d\nHarry stood up and turned to leave.\n\u201cThe vial, Potter.\u201d\nToo embarrassed to look at Snape, Harry snatched the vial and fled.",

        "writing_prompt": "Erin has ventured beyond the forbidden five-mile marker, breaking the commune's rules, but as she surveys an abandoned cabin with a broken window and open door, she hears the sound of hoofbeats behind her\u2014someone from the commune has followed her. Who is it, and what will they do now that they\u2019ve found her?",
        "story": "Huddled in a damp and filthy jacket the lone girl rode slowly in the pre-dawn half light. There was a crispness in the fall air, clean and clear and the cold making each breath a cloud of vapor. Her ratty hood was down despite the warmth it would have provided her against the morning chill and her auburn hair was tied back in a ponytail. The chestnut quarter horse moved at an easy pace under her, following the rutted game trail, careful to pick up its hooves and place them so as to avoid the jutting roots and deadfall beneath the carpet of gold and ochre, red and yellow leaves. Erin sat deep in the saddle but hunched a bit, bow over her shoulder, arrows bundled into a sort of crude quiver made from a leather tool pouch strapped to her leg. Her eyes scanned the shadows along the crest of a low hill where they seemed to gather near the base of the white barked trees. She let her gaze linger on the darkness, confirming its vacancy. Pools of still water riffled black among the brush in the low places. Thin black branches protruded from the water. The edge of the pools fringed with reeds. The tall golden grasses made a hypnotizing sound like a whisper against the horses legs as she ascended the slope and she found her eyes getting heavy. Near the top she let out a short, sharp ho, more grunt than word and shifted her weight in the saddle. Gently she pulled back on the reins though the horse was already stopping. Red dot painted on the trunk of a tree. Nail in the center. A simple, easy to miss marker. Facing opposite the way strangers would come. She sat in the saddle eyeing it. Sniffed. Looked round. All was silent and still. Point of no return, hey Chess. Erin said to the horse and it twitched its ears and knickered as if in response. She rubbed its neck, let her bare hand rest against it a moment. This was the five mile marker. Five miles from home. She wasnt supposed to go past this point. It was forbidden. She wasnt supposed to leave the commune without someone with her either. Was never supposed to go out before dawn or after dusk. None of them were. She patted the horse's neck again. Nudged forward. The horse seemed at first hesitant to resume its earlier pace and instead went on more leisurely. Come on. she urged softly. Another nudge. He picked up the pace. Down the shaded side into the cold, the grasses here damp and high enough to wet her boots. Then up a steep dirt track past the edge of a field of tumbled down and moss-covered rocks. Before the path cut into tree cover she looked out over her right shoulder and could see the lake some miles distant. They called it Silver Lake because the old name had been forgotten and because of the way the shallows shone in the morning light. The sun was on it now, reflecting brilliantly but so near the shoulder of the mountains she rode still in shadow, the sun having not risen high enough yet to reach her. She wanted to stop and take it in longer but she reminded herself she wasnt sight-seeing this time and went on. At the crest of the hill she did stop though. From higher ground it was important to be still and to survey. After a time she dismounted and hitched the horse to a tree. The horses name was Chester; a name given to it by the Bowman's. An animal they had come to own when the trapper John Brannan had decided it was not suited to hunting and passed it along to them. It had ever been wary of the smell of guns and blood and was prone to bolt at the sound of a rifle shot. Taking her bow and arrows she whispered a reassurance to Chester, gave him another rub along his neck and then a pat before she walked out along the ridgeline, eyeing the ground. She watched for animals down in the wooded valley beyond, careful how she stepped, noting the direction of the wind. The hills were criss-crossed with wide cuts between the older, more densely packed forest here. These areas were choked with weeds, low, scraggly brush and stands of thin-trunked saplings. The remains of old ski-runs someone had told her. North of here stood an old place filled with burned out buildings that had once been a great lodge; a place for winter vacations they'd said. No-one went there now. The people that had lived there were all gone now. Nell said they had come to a bad end. The people who had stayed on _after_. Isaac had taken the girls there once, a long time after but the girls had been terrified of the place. There was a sort of superstitious fear of the place even now. Seeing nothing among the trees she crouched and waited. Waited for something like five minutes. Then, at last. _Movement._ Seventy five yards away at the edge of a clearing was movement. Something grey breaking from the dark. She felt her pulse quicken the way it always did. She had the arrow nocked but drew the string now. Raised the bow. Turned her head slightly to exhale, into the breeze not letting the vapor of her breath obscure her vision. It was a bighorn sheep, a ram judging by its wide, curving horns. It had clotted clumps of matted grey and a long white beard, it's alien eyes alert as it nosed the air. Too far away. Too much cover. She would spoil the shot and the noise would scare it off. She tried to remember what Emilie had said about their horns. How much of a curve they were supposed to have to legally hunt them back before the Fall. None of that mattered now of course, but her mind went there. She had always been interested in the way things were even if she sometimes thought Emilie and the others stretched the truth or exaggerated how easy life was by comparison. Erin knew bighorns didnt travel alone and since there was no shot to take, lowered her bow. She watched. There were four more. Tawny and pale. More animals meant more eyes to spot her, more ears to hear her. More noses to sniff her out of the air. With a bow, the best she could hope for was to take one of them. She watched them moving as they followed another trail through the trees up the face of another hill on the far side of the valley. God did she want to take one. That would make all this worth it. A quick run back, going light as she could. Then untying Chester and urging him along the ridge as fast as she dared go in the opposite direction of the big horns. She swung up onto the saddle and took him down a brush-covered defile which hid loose rocks and was more treacherous than she had expected. Chester nearly stumbled once but that was the worst of it and stayed up. Then she urged him back into a trot, angling up the hill back in the direction the sheep were travelling. Slowing as she neared it but riding along the top, trying to guess how far on she should need to ride. How far the animals might have moved. She couldn't be sure if the hill had been enough of a sound break to avoid detection but she doubted she could have gotten around them successfully without being heard. Still. When she judged she had reached roughly the right spot she pulled back on the reins and dropped from the horse's back, this time not tying the animal. Crouching she hurried up the ridge, soft boots quiet in the loamy earth. Skirting around an outcrop of rock she found a cutback and though steep she ascended it efficiently and with little sound. She slowed her breathing as she reached the summit. The bow was held high, string drawn, arrow nocked. She raised up, tried to gain a vantage point to see down the slope to the valley floor. She let out a breath, stopped. Below her on a rocky outcrop. Overgrown with weeds and surrounded by shade trees was an old, abandoned cabin. She recognized it as one of the cabins used by the trapper, though it was empty this time of year. It had once been an outbuilding built to house ski lodge equipment of some kind, or at least that's what Emilie had told her anyway. There was something odd about it though. Something out of place. She could just see the front door and window beside it from here, but the door was open instead of locked and chained closed. Also, the window appeared to have had its glass broken out. And that wasn't all... --- *I want one of you (you should collectively decide who, not just first come first serve) to have your character be out here and catch up to Erin at this point in the story. * *She is out alone, past the five mile marker on a horse that isn't hers.

When she judged she had reached roughly the right spot she pulled back on the reins and dropped from the horse's back, this time not tying the animal. Crouching she hurried up the ridge, soft boots quiet in the loamy earth. Skirting around an outcrop of rock she found a cutback and though steep she ascended it efficiently and with little sound. She slowed her breathing as she reached the summit. The bow was held high, string drawn, arrow nocked. She raised up, tried to gain a vantage point to see down the slope to the valley floor. She let out a breath, stopped. Below her on a rocky outcrop. Overgrown with weeds and surrounded by shade trees was an old, abandoned cabin. She recognized it as one of the cabins used by the trapper, though it was empty this time of year. It had once been an outbuilding built to house ski lodge equipment of some kind, or at least that's what Emilie had told her anyway. There was something odd about it though. Something out of place.

Who is it, and what will they do now that they\u2019ve found her?",
        "story": "Huddled in a damp and filthy jacket the lone girl rode slowly in the pre-dawn half light. There was a crispness in the fall air, clean and clear and the cold making each breath a cloud of vapor. Her ratty hood was down despite the warmth it would have provided her against the morning chill and her auburn hair was tied back in a ponytail. The chestnut quarter horse moved at an easy pace under her, following the rutted game trail, careful to pick up its hooves and place them so as to avoid the jutting roots and deadfall beneath the carpet of gold and ochre, red and yellow leaves. Erin sat deep in the saddle but hunched a bit, bow over her shoulder, arrows bundled into a sort of crude quiver made from a leather tool pouch strapped to her leg. Her eyes scanned the shadows along the crest of a low hill where they seemed to gather near the base of the white barked trees. She let her gaze linger on the darkness, confirming its vacancy. Pools of still water riffled black among the brush in the low places. Thin black branches protruded from the water. The edge of the pools fringed with reeds. The tall golden grasses made a hypnotizing sound like a whisper against the horses legs as she ascended the slope and she found her eyes getting heavy. Near the top she let out a short, sharp ho, more grunt than word and shifted her weight in the saddle. Gently she pulled back on the reins though the horse was already stopping. Red dot painted on the trunk of a tree. Nail in the center. A simple, easy to miss marker. Facing opposite the way strangers would come. She sat in the saddle eyeing it. Sniffed. Looked round. All was silent and still. Point of no return, hey Chess. Erin said to the horse and it twitched its ears and knickered as if in response. She rubbed its neck, let her bare hand rest against it a moment. This was the five mile marker. Five miles from home. She wasnt supposed to go past this point. It was forbidden. She wasnt supposed to leave the commune without someone with her either. Was never supposed to go out before dawn or after dusk. None of them were. She patted the horse's neck again. Nudged forward. The horse seemed at first hesitant to resume its earlier pace and instead went on more leisurely. Come on. she urged softly. Another nudge. He picked up the pace. Down the shaded side into the cold, the grasses here damp and high enough to wet her boots. Then up a steep dirt track past the edge of a field of tumbled down and moss-covered rocks. Before the path cut into tree cover she looked out over her right shoulder and could see the lake some miles distant. They called it Silver Lake because the old name had been forgotten and because of the way the shallows shone in the morning light. The sun was on it now, reflecting brilliantly but so near the shoulder of the mountains she rode still in shadow, the sun having not risen high enough yet to reach her. She wanted to stop and take it in longer but she reminded herself she wasnt sight-seeing this time and went on. At the crest of the hill she did stop though. From higher ground it was important to be still and to survey. After a time she dismounted and hitched the horse to a tree. The horses name was Chester; a name given to it by the Bowman's. An animal they had come to own when the trapper John Brannan had decided it was not suited to hunting and passed it along to them. It had ever been wary of the smell of guns and blood and was prone to bolt at the sound of a rifle shot. Taking her bow and arrows she whispered a reassurance to Chester, gave him another rub along his neck and then a pat before she walked out along the ridgeline, eyeing the ground. She watched for animals down in the wooded valley beyond, careful how she stepped, noting the direction of the wind. The hills were criss-crossed with wide cuts between the older, more densely packed forest here. These areas were choked with weeds, low, scraggly brush and stands of thin-trunked saplings. The remains of old ski-runs someone had told her. North of here stood an old place filled with burned out buildings that had once been a great lodge; a place for winter vacations they'd said. No-one went there now. The people that had lived there were all gone now. Nell said they had come to a bad end. The people who had stayed on _after_. Isaac had taken the girls there once, a long time after but the girls had been terrified of the place. There was a sort of superstitious fear of the place even now. Seeing nothing among the trees she crouched and waited. Waited for something like five minutes. Then, at last. _Movement._ Seventy five yards away at the edge of a clearing was movement. Something grey breaking from the dark. She felt her pulse quicken the way it always did. She had the arrow nocked but drew the string now. Raised the bow. Turned her head slightly to exhale, into the breeze not letting the vapor of her breath obscure her vision. It was a bighorn sheep, a ram judging by its wide, curving horns. It had clotted clumps of matted grey and a long white beard, it's alien eyes alert as it nosed the air. Too far away. Too much cover. She would spoil the shot and the noise would scare it off. She tried to remember what Emilie had said about their horns. How much of a curve they were supposed to have to legally hunt them back before the Fall. None of that mattered now of course, but her mind went there. She had always been interested in the way things were even if she sometimes thought Emilie and the others stretched the truth or exaggerated how easy life was by comparison. Erin knew bighorns didnt travel alone and since there was no shot to take, lowered her bow. She watched. There were four more. Tawny and pale. More animals meant more eyes to spot her, more ears to hear her. More noses to sniff her out of the air. With a bow, the best she could hope for was to take one of them. She watched them moving as they followed another trail through the trees up the face of another hill on the far side of the valley. God did she want to take one. That would make all this worth it. A quick run back, going light as she could. Then untying Chester and urging him along the ridge as fast as she dared go in the opposite direction of the big horns. She swung up onto the saddle and took him down a brush-covered defile which hid loose rocks and was more treacherous than she had expected. Chester nearly stumbled once but that was the worst of it and stayed up. Then she urged him back into a trot, angling up the hill back in the direction the sheep were travelling. Slowing as she neared it but riding along the top, trying to guess how far on she should need to ride. How far the animals might have moved. She couldn't be sure if the hill had been enough of a sound break to avoid detection but she doubted she could have gotten around them successfully without being heard. Still.

        "story": "The schoolmarm is playing poker in the town saloon. The stake is the saloon itself.

The sheriff likes to say that she\u2019s as pure as the spotless lily of the lake, though they have no lake, and there are no lilies in it. No damn lilies. The men cuss a lot\u2014in fact, all the time\u2014but never around the schoolmarm. Cussing doesn\u2019t go together with the schoolmarm.

The bar becomes an altar on Sundays, but there\u2019s no preacher, so the schoolmarm provides temperance lectures from it, which the men are obliged to attend. In their minds, it\u2019s still the old bar, the old saloon, so they carry along hip flasks and beef jerky to ease themselves through the unholy tedium, belching and snorting noisily.\nThe men are also obliged to take spelling and counting lessons on weekdays, using the signs on the saloon walls and the playing cards with numbers on them as their schoolbooks. The men learn that there are two \u201ct\u201ds in \u201cspitting,\u201d for example, and, when they forget or when they ignore the sign\u2019s admonition, they get their heads rapped with a wooden ruler. The schoolmarm also raps their heads for uncouth laughter, bad grammar, cigar smoking in class, and tardiness. This head-rapping hurts, and finally it\u2019s too much for them. They form a jury and condemn the schoolmarm to be hanged for her cruel city ways.\nThe schoolmarm insists that they discuss it first at their weekly meeting of the Deep Thinkers Club. The men associate deep thinking with deep drinking, so they welcome the opportunity. They\u2019ve been missing the old saloon since its unlucky conversion. They gather at their desks, as the schoolmarm calls them, feeling like they\u2019ve come home again.\nThe schoolmarm says that today, her last day, she wants them to think about justice and time, how little there is of either, and also about irony, which somehow relates to the same circumstances. The schoolmarm\u2019s just showing off again, making their brains ache, unrepentant criminal that she is. There is talk of getting on with the hanging, but the men are comfortable where they sit, sucking their teeth contentedly, so no one really wants to get up and go do it.\nThe sheriff, famous for his quick wit, says that time is what he never has enough of, but at least he\u2019s got more than the schoolmarm has. He laughs at his own little joke. The men think about it for a while, and then they laugh, too. The schoolmarm says that that\u2019s what she means by irony, and the sheriff says he\u2019s glad she explained it, because he couldn\u2019t figure out what the dang ironing had to do with anything. Neither could the others. They still can\u2019t, but they hoot and slap their desks just the same. The sheriff\u2019s a pal of theirs.\nOn the subject of justice, the sheriff considers himself something of an expert. He disagrees with the schoolmarm about there being little of it and reminds her that he himself has dealt out a potful. In deference to the schoolmarm, he doesn\u2019t say what sort of pot it was, but the men grunt knowingly. The sheriff then provides a discourse on law and order, which he says are birds of a feather. Blue, he says when someone asks, like a jay\u2019s. One of the men says he thought it was more yellowish, like a chicken hawk\u2019s. The sheriff says it depends on the color of the law that was broken, and at what time of day or night order got criminally disordered. On that subject, he explains to the Deep Thinkers that he prefers order to ordure, though they are more or less the same thing, only because \u201corder\u201d is easier to spell and don\u2019t sound so foreign.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound so foreign,\u201d the schoolmarm corrects.\n\u201cYes\u2019m, that\u2019s what I said,\u201d the sheriff says. \u201cI ain\u2019t completely stupid.\u201d The men applaud the sheriff\u2019s incomplete stupidity.\nThen the schoolmarm delivers a lecture on eternity. It is too long. Many of the men\u2019s heads are now on their desks. The schoolmarm\u2019s lecture cannot be heard over the snoring, so she walks among them, twisting their ears. This wakes up only one at a time, and meanwhile another head falls. It\u2019s a kind of dance of bouncing heads.\nHow to Live Longer, featuring Atul Gawande\nThe sheriff does not want to get his ear twisted, so while the men are dropping off he takes the schoolmarm out to hang her. On the way to the gallows, the sheriff says that sometimes, in shootouts with desperadoes or when wrestling cattle rustlers at the edge of a cliff, he suffers trepidations, and he wonders if the schoolmarm is feeling anything like that now? She isn\u2019t. Her unsentimental tough-mindedness is legendary. Self-pity, she says, is the lowest state to which a person\u2019s mind can fall. Other than lust and gluttony, of course. And indecency.\nWhen the sheriff leads the schoolmarm up onto the gallows, he says, \u201cI know you\u2019re sad about losing your life, ma\u2019am, but you gotta understand\u2014out here, life don\u2019t mean nothing. What only matters is rocks. Rocks and the un-effable, pardon the French.\u201d\n\u201cYour French loses something in the translation,\u201d the schoolmarm says, \u201cbut I suppose when you speak of the ineffable you are speaking of me.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2019m,\u201d the sheriff says. \u201cSure am.\u201d\n\u201cRocks have more to say,\u201d the schoolmarm says. \u201cThey express something profound about this place, this life, as I cannot. Language, even when grammatically correct, is simply inadequate. The situation is, in that sense, unspeakable. A landscape of rocks evokes a time before time, and the end-times as well, forcing us, while contemplating it, to live in all time at once, where words have nothing to attach themselves to.\u201d\nThe sheriff nods, but he doesn\u2019t know what the heck she\u2019s talking about. He fits the noose around her neck.\n\u201cOnly humans can experience time,\u201d the schoolmarm continues portentously, \u201cso time itself will not exist when life ends, as life inevitably must. Between the beginning of time and the end of it, there\u2019s relatively only an eyeblink, and without life there\u2019s no one to see that eyeblink or remember it. That is what rocks express. Though they are otherwise meaningless, they are, in this respect, the most meaningful thing we have, putting us in touch with oblivion. Which is the ineffablest thing of all.\u201d The schoolmarm smiles, having invented a new expression.\n\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am, ain\u2019t all this just a way of putting off what\u2019s got to happen?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes, sorry.

There is talk of getting on with the hanging, but the men are comfortable where they sit, sucking their teeth contentedly, so no one really wants to get up and go do it.\nThe sheriff, famous for his quick wit, says that time is what he never has enough of, but at least he\u2019s got more than the schoolmarm has. He laughs at his own little joke. The men think about it for a while, and then they laugh, too. The schoolmarm says that that\u2019s what she means by irony, and the sheriff says he\u2019s glad she explained it, because he couldn\u2019t figure out what the dang ironing had to do with anything. Neither could the others. They still can\u2019t, but they hoot and slap their desks just the same. The sheriff\u2019s a pal of theirs.\nOn the subject of justice, the sheriff considers himself something of an expert. He disagrees with the schoolmarm about there being little of it and reminds her that he himself has dealt out a potful. In deference to the schoolmarm, he doesn\u2019t say what sort of pot it was, but the men grunt knowingly. The sheriff then provides a discourse on law and order, which he says are birds of a feather. Blue, he says when someone asks, like a jay\u2019s. One of the men says he thought it was more yellowish, like a chicken hawk\u2019s. The sheriff says it depends on the color of the law that was broken, and at what time of day or night order got criminally disordered. On that subject, he explains to the Deep Thinkers that he prefers order to ordure, though they are more or less the same thing, only because \u201corder\u201d is easier to spell and don\u2019t sound so foreign.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound so foreign,\u201d the schoolmarm corrects.\n\u201cYes\u2019m, that\u2019s what I said,\u201d the sheriff says. \u201cI ain\u2019t completely stupid.\u201d The men applaud the sheriff\u2019s incomplete stupidity.\nThen the schoolmarm delivers a lecture on eternity. It is too long. Many of the men\u2019s heads are now on their desks. The schoolmarm\u2019s lecture cannot be heard over the snoring, so she walks among them, twisting their ears. This wakes up only one at a time, and meanwhile another head falls. It\u2019s a kind of dance of bouncing heads.\nHow to Live Longer, featuring Atul Gawande\nThe sheriff does not want to get his ear twisted, so while the men are dropping off he takes the schoolmarm out to hang her. On the way to the gallows, the sheriff says that sometimes, in shootouts with desperadoes or when wrestling cattle rustlers at the edge of a cliff, he suffers trepidations, and he wonders if the schoolmarm is feeling anything like that now? She isn\u2019t. Her unsentimental tough-mindedness is legendary. Self-pity, she says, is the lowest state to which a person\u2019s mind can fall. Other than lust and gluttony, of course. And indecency.\nWhen the sheriff leads the schoolmarm up onto the gallows, he says, \u201cI know you\u2019re sad about losing your life, ma\u2019am, but you gotta understand\u2014out here, life don\u2019t mean nothing. What only matters is rocks. Rocks and the un-effable, pardon the French.\u201d\n\u201cYour French loses something in the translation,\u201d the schoolmarm says, \u201cbut I suppose when you speak of the ineffable you are speaking of me.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2019m,\u201d the sheriff says. \u201cSure am.\u201d\n\u201cRocks have more to say,\u201d the schoolmarm says. \u201cThey express something profound about this place, this life, as I cannot. Language, even when grammatically correct, is simply inadequate. The situation is, in that sense, unspeakable. A landscape of rocks evokes a time before time, and the end-times as well, forcing us, while contemplating it, to live in all time at once, where words have nothing to attach themselves to.\u201d\nThe sheriff nods, but he doesn\u2019t know what the heck she\u2019s talking about. He fits the noose around her neck.\n\u201cOnly humans can experience time,\u201d the schoolmarm continues portentously, \u201cso time itself will not exist when life ends, as life inevitably must. Between the beginning of time and the end of it, there\u2019s relatively only an eyeblink, and without life there\u2019s no one to see that eyeblink or remember it. That is what rocks express. Though they are otherwise meaningless, they are, in this respect, the most meaningful thing we have, putting us in touch with oblivion. Which is the ineffablest thing of all.\u201d The schoolmarm smiles, having invented a new expression.\n\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am, ain\u2019t all this just a way of putting off what\u2019s got to happen?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes, sorry. I suppose it is. Give me a rock to hold.\u201d \u2666",

Perhaps she felt a strange giddy feeling when he did it, however brief.\n\"Greetings Amy.

She was adamant she wanted to keep every corner clean. Unwilling to be stopped by a simple lock, she entered the room to find rows upon rows of mannequins.\nThey were all so realistic, they seemed to breathe. Like those sci-fi movies, where humans were kept in suspended animation. Held up by long chains. Connected to long tubes that snaked around, except in this castle, the tubes were red.\nYup, the countess really loved red. And black. Typical gothic aesthetics of a rich noble family. Amy had many questions about these mannequins. But she wasn't paid to ask. She was paid to clean.\nSo, her first reaction when she accidentally broke a tube that began spraying red liquid onto the floor was to wipe the floor. The butler Vorg nagged about the waste of a perfectly preserved meal. Probably because the countess forced him to stop eating his dinner to help her out. That's what he said.\nShe likes Vorg. Even if his jokes are really weird and not funny. Like that time he joked about farming humans like cattle. Amy doesn't even see a farm anywhere near the castle grounds. But she appreciated any attempt to lighten the mood while they were working.\nAre rich people and the company they keep always this eccentric?\nTurns out, Countess Elizabeth has even more bizarre friends. Lord Elvari probably takes the cake. Dude claimed to be some kind of tentacle god. A very ancient one that can see a curse hanging over her head. Some spell by a witch who cursed people to think that supernatural entities are just strange humans who really are into this gothic Halloween look.\n\"[I've seen this curse in another woman](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/188r5lk/wp_youre_completely_oblivious_to_the_supernatural/kbntqef/), Amy,\" he spoke in a rather grave tone. \"I can remove the spell if you wish.\"\n\"No offense, my lord, but this is the third time you've said this same joke.

I'm telling you, he's the one under some magic that messed up his sense of humour.\"\n\"Perhaps you mean, sucked him dry of humour?\" The pale lord chuckled.\nAmy laughed at what was probably the first good joke she heard in the castle for a long time.\n\"What brings you here on this day?\" She couldn't resist asking.\nHe flashed her one of those charming smiles. \"I'm here to retrieve some mannequins. Don't tell Elizabeth, okay?\"\n\"Okay.\"\n**\n--\nElizabeth was screaming about the empty storeroom.

Will couldn\u2019t help but start laughing.\n\u201cIt does look like a duck!\u201d\nNico burst out laughing with him.\nIt took a few minutes but eventually they calmed down.\n\u201cOkay, we got the basics.\u201d Will caught his breath.\n\u201cWait but there\u2019s more right?\u201d Nico said. \u201cWhen people make out and stuff. They lick each other.\u201d\n\u201cOh my gods!\u201d Will was both cracking up and blushing hard enough he glowed.\n\u201cWhat? They lick each others\u2019 mouths and stuff.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I guess they lick each other.\u201d Will gasped for air.\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t they bite each other too? Eat each other?\u201d\nWill howled with laughter, rolling onto his side and clutching his stomach. Nico couldn\u2019t help but smile at the sight.\n\u201cWhat? What did I say?\u201d\nWill sat back up, a hand over his mouth to cover his laughter.\n\u201cOne last question, I promise,\u201d Nico implored. \u201cWhat do you do with your eyes?\u201d\n\u201cYou shut them,\u201d Will said. He closed his eyes for demonstration. When he opened them, Nico nodded thoughtfully.\nBefore Will could process it, Nico had shut his eyes, leaned forward and given him a brief but sweet kiss.\n\u201cLike that?\u201d Nico questioned nervously.\nWill\u2019s brain had stopped working. His mouth opened and closed aimlessly and his eyes were as wide as saucers.\n\u201cDid I get it wrong?\u201d\nWill shook his head. \u201cNo... You know, these things take practice.\u201d\nNico raised an eyebrow. \u201cReally? It\u2019s just mushing faces together. I think I did pretty good.\u201d\n\u201cYou did amazing,\u201d Will confirmed. \u201cBut there\u2019s other stuff too.\u201d\nHe shuffled closer, gazing into Nico\u2019s wide eyes. He raised his hands to cup Nico\u2019s face and tuck that bit of loose hair behind his ear.\n\u201cLike this?\u201d Nico lifted his hands to do the same to Will\u2019s face, brown eyes looking over every inch of it.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Will said quietly. \u201cThen you lean in.\u201d\nHe leaned in as he spoke until their lips were a breath away. He couldn\u2019t stop looking at how close they were.\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to close your eyes,\u201d Nico whispered. Will nodded.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nAnd he did.",

Halfway there it started to rain, so Roy ducked under a canopy in front of the entrance to an apartment building. A very tall, sturdily built blond lady wearing a thin black coat came out of the building.

Maybe I\u2019ll go when it stops raining.\u201d\nHe opened the refrigerator and took out a bottle of milk.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the leader of the Amazons called?\u201d Roy asked.\n\u201cA virago,\u201d said Pops.\n\u201cIs that the same as queen?\u201d\n\u201cYou need a king to have a queen, Roy. No, a virago is a termagant.\u201d\n\u201cTermagant?

In a rational world, she wouldn't be speeding around on a motorbike in spandex punching other spandex clad villains as they tried to take over the city. A no-nonsense person, she figured, would be filing their taxes in early March as opposed to fighting crime.\nSecond of all, she tried to have fun on the job. She was riding a motorcycle for goodness sake. Who could say that a motorcycle was the most practical form of transportation! If she weren't fun loving and self indulgent, she would be taking public transport around the city. That would be helping solve the falling ridership issue, and securing funding for public transit might be more critical to the city than punching any villain.\nIn, as far as Intricate understood, she was a fun-loving, nonsense filled hero, just as much as anyone else. Okay, maybe not as much as 'everyone else' but many of them were just plain unprofessional!\nAside from bristling against the no-nonsense label, Intricate had also found that it made her life, marginally harder.

They objectively were,  but they were more frantic than they were when they fought other heroes.\nShe'd seen videos of the famous showdowns, everyone had. The villains talked, they japed, they showed off. Intricate? Intricate got none of that. It was straight to business when she showed up.\nBack at the start, villains had tried talking through their fights, but, it'd literally fallen on deaf ears.\nMaybe that was what made people think she was no-nonsense. She couldn't take fun, after battle, interviews because there were rarely interpreters around after a fight. Logically they ran away once the building-chunks started flying.\nThat no-nonsense label was also why Intricate was sitting on her bed, in her 'Miranda' clothes considering whether she was going to get dressed for the day of crime fighting. She read the news. She understood how brand deals worked.\nShe liked protecting people, loved it even, it filled her with purpose, but at the same time... reading that the city you protect doesn't like you is never a good way to start the morning.\nBut she'd gotten the call, people needed help. So she'd get ready as she always did. One glove at a time, and in the peace and quiet.\n....\nBy the time Intricate reached the scene of the crime, chaos had already ensued, past tense. She was late. Now there were police scattered around the bank using their cruises as shields and keeping an eye on the main door. There was only one way in or out of the central bank. Whoever was in there would have to fight they way out.\nIntricate pulled up to the scene and hopped off her motorcycle. The first thing she caught in the corner of her eyes was someone rolling theirs. She frowned. Allowed herself an extended blink, then moved on. Marching toward the door without knowing what was going on inside.\nPerhaps that was part of her label as well, Intricate's armor was nigh-invincible, and means that she was able to simply walk at most threats. She started up the steps then turned and waved the police officers further back.\nThey didn't move.\nIntricate tried again with, what she feared, was too much enthusiasm. She wanted them to get to safe distance, not to think she was telling them to shoo.\nShe was too far in her head, it was probably fine.\nIntricate entered the bank, tossing the door open and marching into the foyer. In the dead centre of the room was a villain that she didn'tm recognize.\nMost cities had a rogue's gallery of a sort. Sure, they got locked away, but there were only so many powers in a population and keeping them in jail was a pain in the ass. That all to say, it was a rare novelty to see an unknown on a crime scene.\nThe woman, villain, opened her mouth and clearly said something. She was only wearing half a mask so Intricate, in theory, had a chance to read her lips, but she'd never been good at that. A second later, the woman stopped and scanned Intricate.\nShe was never, so Intricate gave her the moment to do so.\nThen another novelty.\n\"Intricate, it's a pleasure.\" the woman signed. Intricate stared for a moment. She knew the words enough to understand them, but was too distracted by what the hell was going on to process them. She only had the common response to this revelation.\n\"You sign?\" Intricate ask.\n\"Obviously.\" the woman retorted. The signs were somewhat hard to read, a mix of rough gestures and the multicolored costume contrasted with her dark skin. Too much extra visual noise.\n\"I'm going to stop you.\" Intricate signed back. She took a deep breath, but instead of moving right into a fight, the woman kept signing.\n\"You're going to stop me? How adorable. Don't you know how long I've planned this heist for?\"\n\"No?\"\n\"Months. Months I've been waiting to come onto the scene and fight you.

You don't need to sit there and listen to a monologue and--\" The villain, Intricate had never asked her name, stopped, she needed her hands for this.\nBut it was too late, Intricate was on top of her.\nThat villain was right, she didn't need to sit there and listen to a monologue, but she was wrong about Intricate.\nShe'd show her she was fun, hit by hit.",

The parchment balanced on your knee was half forgotten, the pot of ink and writing quill sitting on the windowsill as a mere figment, now. A storm must be brewing over the sea, and you wondered if you would experience it before night fell and sleep welcomed you with wide open arms.\nPrince Aemond was many things, on many occasions, for many people. He was calculating, yet\ntempered\n. Unforgiving, attentive.\nImpulsive\n, and intelligent. He was\nwild\n, yet subtlety - veiled or otherwise - had proven to be a quality that he had shown little interest in practicing. It was something he never seemed to regret, even if it meant spiraling petty feuds into further disarray, or simply tugging on fraying threads during family dinners that lead to hurled threats and slamming doors. It was a little cocoon of his own making, this calmly crafted life of controlled chaos.\nYet you were the exception - both you\nand\nHeleana - until, of course, it was only you that remained shielded no longer.\nYou were oblivious, in your daydreams, to the chaos raging fierce and strong in your own home - until the door to your rooms flew open to\ncrack\nsharply on the wall behind.\nAemond didn\u2019t expect to find you here. With the evening promising rain and fury, he assumed you\u2019d be enjoying the fresh air as long as time allowed,\nbut\n. He had come here to breathe, yet the irritation simmering slow and hot and vicious under his skin craved a release of any kind, as it always does.\nRegret\nwas hardly an intimate word for Aemond, yet it lingered, unyielding, clouding his mind once the red melted from his vision and his blackened heart returned to gold.\nThe way he\u2019d allowed his lack of care to send you slamming the door to your apartments as you left him -\nfuming\n, in the wake of your own reciprocated wrath - well. It left him feeling anything other than comfort.\nIt was a whirlwind in the flesh, truly, the tense words he had flung to bite at your heart. Cold, calm fury battered them aside, broke through the weakening shield Aemond held fast around himself in an excuse to project without circumstance. Without consequence. He hadn\u2019t been able to draw blood of course, you knew him too well to know it wasn\u2019t\nyou\nthat had cracked his everlasting dragonskin.\nYou, however, had always been a different story.\nArmed to the teeth with words that would puncture, pierce, cut to bleed and\ntwist\n, when pushed too hard, too far; a cloak of blame had been settled upon your shoulders, and it was not yours to bear. You tore it off with a simple tug, flourished the fabric in such a way that it clung to the Prince himself, the villain in this particular instance, but not a villain at heart.\nAemond was left staring where you had once been; a window that was open, brilliant view of the darkening sky echoing behind you, the sole outlet for the latest qualm that had been one push, one prod, one irrelevant instance too far - because,\nwell\n.\nAs collected as he usually was, there was always\nsomething\nthat would push anyone over the edge.\nRegardless, he had never once abandoned the training grounds to take his ire out on you. He sought only your company after all; a sun, a saint, an equal to temper what always tried to break through the rising tide.\nSeven\nfucking\nhells.\nIt wasn\u2019t a surprise, when he did not follow you through your rooms, or down the glowing hall.\nSconces were being lit as a false twilight fell, the sweet, early arrival of blue hour inspired haste in the servants lighting your way to the library. The shadows were chased away, one by one; yet the shadow that still enveloped your path was not of nature\u2019s doing, nor was it your own.\nWooden doors loomed before you, bracketed by torches bright and warm and welcoming. You had stalked all the way here you realized, swift and mindless in where your feet had been taking you. Anger still burned through your veins, when you pushed the door open with your whole body. Hinges groaned with the sudden movement jarring them awake.\nSilence engulfed you once the door fell shut. Familiarity took you into its arms under the soft light of candles guttering in the fresh stir of air - rarely, did anyone come here at this hour. The knowledge that you wouldn\u2019t be disturbed tempered your fire.\nThe sigh that left your lips was ragged. Shaken.\nHurt\n.\nThis was something new from Aemond - something that made you wonder\nwhat\nin the\nseven hells\njust\nhappened\n.\nYour feet carried you to the nearest window, and the breeze that met your skin was a soft caress tasting of salt and comfort - probably - since that was something you would not be receiving anytime soon, you imagined. Not from the one you wished, at least.\nHe made that\nquite fucking clear\n, actually.\nThe drawl of distant rumbling welcomed you as you journeyed farther into the room, fingers trailing along the old wooden tables in your wake. The emptiness was peaceful, the candlelight warm and soft in stark contrast with the scene you just left to simmer. You went to the windows, drawing them in tight, before the rain could intrude where it did not belong.\nAnger was a fickle thing,\nyou thought, turning a corner. The goal was to become lost in the maze of shelves piled high with long forgotten crumbling volumes. To find a tome that caught your eye in the looming shadows, then settle in with it while you tucked yourself up into one of the few window seats with the raging sea below as your steadfast companion.\nYou\u2019d stay here with your false peace until your eyes drifted closed and your head leaned against rain spattered glass. Unless, of course, you were confident that retracing your steps to venture back wouldn\u2019t reignite what brought you here in the first place. Perhaps then, you would be cooled enough to seek each other\u2019s company, as your heart so longed to do, even now.\nEven so, the distant rumbling grew louder with each page you turned. Rain crackled into the glass as the wind whipped past. The more you read, the pages became even more brown and stiff as they slowly shared with you their age.\nThe storm, once far out of your sight, seemed to be right on top of you now as it unleashed its fury hard and strong and fast as it battered itself again and again and\nagain\nagainst the city below, and punished the castle walls themselves.\nIt was because of this, that every sound coming from within was, of course, as good as silent.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d find you here.\u201d\nHis voice filled what little lull a storm of this magnitude could give. It slid over your skin, soft as silk, slipped in through the little cracks along with the rain and wind and thunder alike.\nPrince Aemond stood in the glow of torchlight, illuminated wholly in the warm caress of flickering flame. He remained some distance from you, mindful of the space you held both for yourself, and, more pressingly - the distance you created when he pushed you oh, so splendidly away earlier that evening.\n\u201cWell,\u201d your eyes slid away from the prince, to instead find the paragraph they had been pulled away from. Your next words were spoken idly, if not with remnants of\nferocity\ncoating them as you resumed reading. \u201cYou\ndo\nknow where I like to hide.\u201d\nAemond shifts his weight - it\u2019s caught out the corner of your eye - and a shadow promptly slips across you to blanket the words on the pages. It was, by design, a darkness you weren\u2019t able to see through, not with the storm outside batting aside the sun\u2019s dying rays with its gray clouds and veils of rain.\nIntentional\n.\n\u201cSo you\nare\nhiding from me.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018\nHide\n\u2019 is not the word I would use.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThe book snapped shut in your hands on a sigh dragged from the weary depths of your heart. They were both, unfortunately, swallowed by another rolling volley of thunder. The timing was so dramatic, so absolutely\nyou\n, that it wasn\u2019t Aemond\u2019s fault when it inspired a harsh roll of his eye.\nHe could be dramatic too, if only to distract you from the way his lips quirked, the flash of a smile threatening to show itself in the darkness, or in the shine of the firelight still kissing fragments of his skin. Aemond knew this wasn\u2019t the time for jokes, yet even he could appreciate the irony of the trap\nhe\nlaid, and, quite gracefully, stepped right into.\nLightning forked through the sky on another crash of thunder, the flash cold in contrast to the warmth of the library. It was jarring, how the harsh, white light exposed everything, always, quickly and quietly before it melted back into the safety of blowing rain and raging waves.\nAnd yet, it was enough. Enough to see the tension weaving its way through Prince Aemond\u2019s jaw, and the set of his shoulders. How he hid his hands behind his back, no doubt clasped and curled in an unbreakable grip. Aemond clearly found no comfort here tonight. He held himself wound tight - even more so, almost, than he did when all the eyes watched him while at court.\nYou, on the other hand, were relaxed, given the circumstances. Lounging comfortably in the window seat while allowing the peace and the stillness to wash over you in the place you felt safest in all of King\u2019s Landing.\nGuilt\n, you realized, still sitting in his shadow.\nThis was what his guilt looked like.\nYou had wondered if Aemond could even feel such a thing.\n\u201cNo,\u201d you answered his question slowly. Let the bite fade from your voice and fall into the storm. Let it melt back into nothing. \u201cI believe I would choose \u2018\nisolate\n\u2019. I assumed neither one of us wanted that conversation to continue while clawing at each other\u2019s throats, as we were.\u201d\nAemond took a breath, inhaled loud and sharp in time with a sheet of rain being pushed against the windowpane. He looked away as you watched him, your feet uncurling from their place on the seat, the volume slipping through your fingers to rest beside you.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d\nYou stepped from the shadows and went to him, still hiding in the safety of the dark. He longed to reach for you, longed to feel your skin, warm from the fire, warm from the peace you always seemed to carve for yourself - but his fingertips were cold from the time he spent solitary in your rooms after you had gone. The fires burned to ashes as he tempered himself, once again, into honed steel that the prince sheathed - if only so he could see you again, without drawing blood once more. Now that he found you, he feared you would find only ice under his touch, instead of comfort.\nIt made his heart\nache\n.\nAnd\nyou\n-\nAemond shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, when he found his fingers threaded through yours. A hand glided up to rest on his jaw, guiding it gently to face you. The fire was gone from your eyes, tension nowhere to be found in your body language. He could see in you, just how much you could read him, even when he said so little. Even when he said everything he didn\u2019t mean.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d you took a step backwards toward the entrance, tugging on his hand as you did so. The corners of your lips quirked, the prelude of a small smile illuminating the shadows Aemond still hid in. \u201cLet\u2019s go brew some tea and\u2026maybe we can talk.\u201d\nHis head dips in agreement, oddly silent since he last spoke. It was almost as if\u2026as if he wasn\u2019t sure the words that wanted to spill out would be the right ones.\nKind\nones. Instead, his chilled fingers finally curled gently around your own.\nAll he can bring himself to say is, \u201cLead on, darling.\u201d\nSo you do, leading him through gloomy shadows deepened by the storm, to hallways illuminated by torches, by lightning, by\nyou\n.",

The more you read, the pages became even more brown and stiff as they slowly shared with you their age.\nThe storm, once far out of your sight, seemed to be right on top of you now as it unleashed its fury hard and strong and fast as it battered itself again and again and\nagain\nagainst the city below, and punished the castle walls themselves.\nIt was because of this, that every sound coming from within was, of course, as good as silent.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d find you here.\u201d\nHis voice filled what little lull a storm of this magnitude could give. It slid over your skin, soft as silk, slipped in through the little cracks along with the rain and wind and thunder alike.\nPrince Aemond stood in the glow of torchlight, illuminated wholly in the warm caress of flickering flame. He remained some distance from you, mindful of the space you held both for yourself, and, more pressingly - the distance you created when he pushed you oh, so splendidly away earlier that evening.\n\u201cWell,\u201d your eyes slid away from the prince, to instead find the paragraph they had been pulled away from. Your next words were spoken idly, if not with remnants of\nferocity\ncoating them as you resumed reading. \u201cYou\ndo\nknow where I like to hide.\u201d\nAemond shifts his weight - it\u2019s caught out the corner of your eye - and a shadow promptly slips across you to blanket the words on the pages. It was, by design, a darkness you weren\u2019t able to see through, not with the storm outside batting aside the sun\u2019s dying rays with its gray clouds and veils of rain.\nIntentional\n.\n\u201cSo you\nare\nhiding from me.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018\nHide\n\u2019 is not the word I would use.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThe book snapped shut in your hands on a sigh dragged from the weary depths of your heart. They were both, unfortunately, swallowed by another rolling volley of thunder. The timing was so dramatic, so absolutely\nyou\n, that it wasn\u2019t Aemond\u2019s fault when it inspired a harsh roll of his eye.\nHe could be dramatic too, if only to distract you from the way his lips quirked, the flash of a smile threatening to show itself in the darkness, or in the shine of the firelight still kissing fragments of his skin. Aemond knew this wasn\u2019t the time for jokes, yet even he could appreciate the irony of the trap\nhe\nlaid, and, quite gracefully, stepped right into.\nLightning forked through the sky on another crash of thunder, the flash cold in contrast to the warmth of the library. It was jarring, how the harsh, white light exposed everything, always, quickly and quietly before it melted back into the safety of blowing rain and raging waves.\nAnd yet, it was enough. Enough to see the tension weaving its way through Prince Aemond\u2019s jaw, and the set of his shoulders. How he hid his hands behind his back, no doubt clasped and curled in an unbreakable grip. Aemond clearly found no comfort here tonight. He held himself wound tight - even more so, almost, than he did when all the eyes watched him while at court.\nYou, on the other hand, were relaxed, given the circumstances. Lounging comfortably in the window seat while allowing the peace and the stillness to wash over you in the place you felt safest in all of King\u2019s Landing.\nGuilt\n, you realized, still sitting in his shadow.\nThis was what his guilt looked like.\nYou had wondered if Aemond could even feel such a thing.\n\u201cNo,\u201d you answered his question slowly. Let the bite fade from your voice and fall into the storm. Let it melt back into nothing. \u201cI believe I would choose \u2018\nisolate\n\u2019. I assumed neither one of us wanted that conversation to continue while clawing at each other\u2019s throats, as we were.\u201d\nAemond took a breath, inhaled loud and sharp in time with a sheet of rain being pushed against the windowpane. He looked away as you watched him, your feet uncurling from their place on the seat, the volume slipping through your fingers to rest beside you.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d\nYou stepped from the shadows and went to him, still hiding in the safety of the dark. He longed to reach for you, longed to feel your skin, warm from the fire, warm from the peace you always seemed to carve for yourself - but his fingertips were cold from the time he spent solitary in your rooms after you had gone. The fires burned to ashes as he tempered himself, once again, into honed steel that the prince sheathed - if only so he could see you again, without drawing blood once more. Now that he found you, he feared you would find only ice under his touch, instead of comfort.\nIt made his heart\nache\n.\nAnd\nyou\n-\nAemond shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, when he found his fingers threaded through yours. A hand glided up to rest on his jaw, guiding it gently to face you. The fire was gone from your eyes, tension nowhere to be found in your body language. He could see in you, just how much you could read him, even when he said so little. Even when he said everything he didn\u2019t mean.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d you took a step backwards toward the entrance, tugging on his hand as you did so. The corners of your lips quirked, the prelude of a small smile illuminating the shadows Aemond still hid in. \u201cLet\u2019s go brew some tea and\u2026maybe we can talk.\u201d\nHis head dips in agreement, oddly silent since he last spoke. It was almost as if\u2026as if he wasn\u2019t sure the words that wanted to spill out would be the right ones.\nKind\nones. Instead, his chilled fingers finally curled gently around your own.\nAll he can bring himself to say is, \u201cLead on, darling.\u201d\nSo you do, leading him through gloomy shadows deepened by the storm, to hallways illuminated by torches, by lightning, by\nyou\n.",

        "story": "The afternoon air was thick with tension and dripping destruction, though you seemed to be none the wiser. So swept up were you, in the beauty of deep blue skies and the path of charcoal gray clouds as they passed by on the warm wind. The parchment balanced on your knee was half forgotten, the pot of ink and writing quill sitting on the windowsill as a mere figment, now. A storm must be brewing over the sea, and you wondered if you would experience it before night fell and sleep welcomed you with wide open arms.\nPrince Aemond was many things, on many occasions, for many people. He was calculating, yet\ntempered\n. Unforgiving, attentive.\nImpulsive\n, and intelligent. He was\nwild\n, yet subtlety - veiled or otherwise - had proven to be a quality that he had shown little interest in practicing. It was something he never seemed to regret, even if it meant spiraling petty feuds into further disarray, or simply tugging on fraying threads during family dinners that lead to hurled threats and slamming doors. It was a little cocoon of his own making, this calmly crafted life of controlled chaos.\nYet you were the exception - both you\nand\nHeleana - until, of course, it was only you that remained shielded no longer.\nYou were oblivious, in your daydreams, to the chaos raging fierce and strong in your own home - until the door to your rooms flew open to\ncrack\nsharply on the wall behind.\nAemond didn\u2019t expect to find you here. With the evening promising rain and fury, he assumed you\u2019d be enjoying the fresh air as long as time allowed,\nbut\n. He had come here to breathe, yet the irritation simmering slow and hot and vicious under his skin craved a release of any kind, as it always does.\nRegret\nwas hardly an intimate word for Aemond, yet it lingered, unyielding, clouding his mind once the red melted from his vision and his blackened heart returned to gold.\nThe way he\u2019d allowed his lack of care to send you slamming the door to your apartments as you left him -\nfuming\n, in the wake of your own reciprocated wrath - well. It left him feeling anything other than comfort.\nIt was a whirlwind in the flesh, truly, the tense words he had flung to bite at your heart. Cold, calm fury battered them aside, broke through the weakening shield Aemond held fast around himself in an excuse to project without circumstance. Without consequence. He hadn\u2019t been able to draw blood of course, you knew him too well to know it wasn\u2019t\nyou\nthat had cracked his everlasting dragonskin.\nYou, however, had always been a different story.\nArmed to the teeth with words that would puncture, pierce, cut to bleed and\ntwist\n, when pushed too hard, too far; a cloak of blame had been settled upon your shoulders, and it was not yours to bear. You tore it off with a simple tug, flourished the fabric in such a way that it clung to the Prince himself, the villain in this particular instance, but not a villain at heart.\nAemond was left staring where you had once been; a window that was open, brilliant view of the darkening sky echoing behind you, the sole outlet for the latest qualm that had been one push, one prod, one irrelevant instance too far - because,\nwell\n.\nAs collected as he usually was, there was always\nsomething\nthat would push anyone over the edge.\nRegardless, he had never once abandoned the training grounds to take his ire out on you. He sought only your company after all; a sun, a saint, an equal to temper what always tried to break through the rising tide.\nSeven\nfucking\nhells.\nIt wasn\u2019t a surprise, when he did not follow you through your rooms, or down the glowing hall.\nSconces were being lit as a false twilight fell, the sweet, early arrival of blue hour inspired haste in the servants lighting your way to the library. The shadows were chased away, one by one; yet the shadow that still enveloped your path was not of nature\u2019s doing, nor was it your own.\nWooden doors loomed before you, bracketed by torches bright and warm and welcoming. You had stalked all the way here you realized, swift and mindless in where your feet had been taking you. Anger still burned through your veins, when you pushed the door open with your whole body. Hinges groaned with the sudden movement jarring them awake.\nSilence engulfed you once the door fell shut. Familiarity took you into its arms under the soft light of candles guttering in the fresh stir of air - rarely, did anyone come here at this hour. The knowledge that you wouldn\u2019t be disturbed tempered your fire.\nThe sigh that left your lips was ragged. Shaken.\nHurt\n.\nThis was something new from Aemond - something that made you wonder\nwhat\nin the\nseven hells\njust\nhappened\n.\nYour feet carried you to the nearest window, and the breeze that met your skin was a soft caress tasting of salt and comfort - probably - since that was something you would not be receiving anytime soon, you imagined. Not from the one you wished, at least.\nHe made that\nquite fucking clear\n, actually.\nThe drawl of distant rumbling welcomed you as you journeyed farther into the room, fingers trailing along the old wooden tables in your wake. The emptiness was peaceful, the candlelight warm and soft in stark contrast with the scene you just left to simmer. You went to the windows, drawing them in tight, before the rain could intrude where it did not belong.\nAnger was a fickle thing,\nyou thought, turning a corner. The goal was to become lost in the maze of shelves piled high with long forgotten crumbling volumes. To find a tome that caught your eye in the looming shadows, then settle in with it while you tucked yourself up into one of the few window seats with the raging sea below as your steadfast companion.\nYou\u2019d stay here with your false peace until your eyes drifted closed and your head leaned against rain spattered glass. Unless, of course, you were confident that retracing your steps to venture back wouldn\u2019t reignite what brought you here in the first place. Perhaps then, you would be cooled enough to seek each other\u2019s company, as your heart so longed to do, even now.\nEven so, the distant rumbling grew louder with each page you turned. Rain crackled into the glass as the wind whipped past.

A hand glided up to rest on his jaw, guiding it gently to face you. The fire was gone from your eyes, tension nowhere to be found in your body language. He could see in you, just how much you could read him, even when he said so little. Even when he said everything he didn\u2019t mean.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d you took a step backwards toward the entrance, tugging on his hand as you did so. The corners of your lips quirked, the prelude of a small smile illuminating the shadows Aemond still hid in. \u201cLet\u2019s go brew some tea and\u2026maybe we can talk.\u201d\nHis head dips in agreement, oddly silent since he last spoke. It was almost as if\u2026as if he wasn\u2019t sure the words that wanted to spill out would be the right ones.\nKind\nones. Instead, his chilled fingers finally curled gently around your own.\nAll he can bring himself to say is, \u201cLead on, darling.\u201d\nSo you do, leading him through gloomy shadows deepened by the storm, to hallways illuminated by torches, by lightning, by\nyou\n.",

        "writing_prompt": "A storm rages outside, but the true tempest brews within the castle walls as Prince Aemond seeks you out, guilt and tension heavy in the air after a heated argument. Will the storm outside mirror the one between you, or will the calm finally break through?",
        "story": "The afternoon air was thick with tension and dripping destruction, though you seemed to be none the wiser. So swept up were you, in the beauty of deep blue skies and the path of charcoal gray clouds as they passed by on the warm wind. The parchment balanced on your knee was half forgotten, the pot of ink and writing quill sitting on the windowsill as a mere figment, now. A storm must be brewing over the sea, and you wondered if you would experience it before night fell and sleep welcomed you with wide open arms.\nPrince Aemond was many things, on many occasions, for many people. He was calculating, yet\ntempered\n. Unforgiving, attentive.\nImpulsive\n, and intelligent. He was\nwild\n, yet subtlety - veiled or otherwise - had proven to be a quality that he had shown little interest in practicing. It was something he never seemed to regret, even if it meant spiraling petty feuds into further disarray, or simply tugging on fraying threads during family dinners that lead to hurled threats and slamming doors. It was a little cocoon of his own making, this calmly crafted life of controlled chaos.\nYet you were the exception - both you\nand\nHeleana - until, of course, it was only you that remained shielded no longer.\nYou were oblivious, in your daydreams, to the chaos raging fierce and strong in your own home - until the door to your rooms flew open to\ncrack\nsharply on the wall behind.\nAemond didn\u2019t expect to find you here. With the evening promising rain and fury, he assumed you\u2019d be enjoying the fresh air as long as time allowed,\nbut\n. He had come here to breathe, yet the irritation simmering slow and hot and vicious under his skin craved a release of any kind, as it always does.\nRegret\nwas hardly an intimate word for Aemond, yet it lingered, unyielding, clouding his mind once the red melted from his vision and his blackened heart returned to gold.\nThe way he\u2019d allowed his lack of care to send you slamming the door to your apartments as you left him -\nfuming\n, in the wake of your own reciprocated wrath - well. It left him feeling anything other than comfort.\nIt was a whirlwind in the flesh, truly, the tense words he had flung to bite at your heart. Cold, calm fury battered them aside, broke through the weakening shield Aemond held fast around himself in an excuse to project without circumstance. Without consequence. He hadn\u2019t been able to draw blood of course, you knew him too well to know it wasn\u2019t\nyou\nthat had cracked his everlasting dragonskin.\nYou, however, had always been a different story.\nArmed to the teeth with words that would puncture, pierce, cut to bleed and\ntwist\n, when pushed too hard, too far; a cloak of blame had been settled upon your shoulders, and it was not yours to bear. You tore it off with a simple tug, flourished the fabric in such a way that it clung to the Prince himself, the villain in this particular instance, but not a villain at heart.\nAemond was left staring where you had once been; a window that was open, brilliant view of the darkening sky echoing behind you, the sole outlet for the latest qualm that had been one push, one prod, one irrelevant instance too far - because,\nwell\n.\nAs collected as he usually was, there was always\nsomething\nthat would push anyone over the edge.\nRegardless, he had never once abandoned the training grounds to take his ire out on you. He sought only your company after all; a sun, a saint, an equal to temper what always tried to break through the rising tide.\nSeven\nfucking\nhells.\nIt wasn\u2019t a surprise, when he did not follow you through your rooms, or down the glowing hall.\nSconces were being lit as a false twilight fell, the sweet, early arrival of blue hour inspired haste in the servants lighting your way to the library. The shadows were chased away, one by one; yet the shadow that still enveloped your path was not of nature\u2019s doing, nor was it your own.\nWooden doors loomed before you, bracketed by torches bright and warm and welcoming. You had stalked all the way here you realized, swift and mindless in where your feet had been taking you. Anger still burned through your veins, when you pushed the door open with your whole body. Hinges groaned with the sudden movement jarring them awake.\nSilence engulfed you once the door fell shut. Familiarity took you into its arms under the soft light of candles guttering in the fresh stir of air - rarely, did anyone come here at this hour. The knowledge that you wouldn\u2019t be disturbed tempered your fire.\nThe sigh that left your lips was ragged. Shaken.\nHurt\n.\nThis was something new from Aemond - something that made you wonder\nwhat\nin the\nseven hells\njust\nhappened\n.\nYour feet carried you to the nearest window, and the breeze that met your skin was a soft caress tasting of salt and comfort - probably - since that was something you would not be receiving anytime soon, you imagined. Not from the one you wished, at least.\nHe made that\nquite fucking clear\n, actually.\nThe drawl of distant rumbling welcomed you as you journeyed farther into the room, fingers trailing along the old wooden tables in your wake. The emptiness was peaceful, the candlelight warm and soft in stark contrast with the scene you just left to simmer. You went to the windows, drawing them in tight, before the rain could intrude where it did not belong.\nAnger was a fickle thing,\nyou thought, turning a corner. The goal was to become lost in the maze of shelves piled high with long forgotten crumbling volumes. To find a tome that caught your eye in the looming shadows, then settle in with it while you tucked yourself up into one of the few window seats with the raging sea below as your steadfast companion.\nYou\u2019d stay here with your false peace until your eyes drifted closed and your head leaned against rain spattered glass. Unless, of course, you were confident that retracing your steps to venture back wouldn\u2019t reignite what brought you here in the first place. Perhaps then, you would be cooled enough to seek each other\u2019s company, as your heart so longed to do, even now.\nEven so, the distant rumbling grew louder with each page you turned. Rain crackled into the glass as the wind whipped past. The more you read, the pages became even more brown and stiff as they slowly shared with you their age.\nThe storm, once far out of your sight, seemed to be right on top of you now as it unleashed its fury hard and strong and fast as it battered itself again and again and\nagain\nagainst the city below, and punished the castle walls themselves.\nIt was because of this, that every sound coming from within was, of course, as good as silent.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d find you here.\u201d\nHis voice filled what little lull a storm of this magnitude could give. It slid over your skin, soft as silk, slipped in through the little cracks along with the rain and wind and thunder alike.\nPrince Aemond stood in the glow of torchlight, illuminated wholly in the warm caress of flickering flame. He remained some distance from you, mindful of the space you held both for yourself, and, more pressingly - the distance you created when he pushed you oh, so splendidly away earlier that evening.\n\u201cWell,\u201d your eyes slid away from the prince, to instead find the paragraph they had been pulled away from. Your next words were spoken idly, if not with remnants of\nferocity\ncoating them as you resumed reading. \u201cYou\ndo\nknow where I like to hide.\u201d\nAemond shifts his weight - it\u2019s caught out the corner of your eye - and a shadow promptly slips across you to blanket the words on the pages. It was, by design, a darkness you weren\u2019t able to see through, not with the storm outside batting aside the sun\u2019s dying rays with its gray clouds and veils of rain.\nIntentional\n.\n\u201cSo you\nare\nhiding from me.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018\nHide\n\u2019 is not the word I would use.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThe book snapped shut in your hands on a sigh dragged from the weary depths of your heart. They were both, unfortunately, swallowed by another rolling volley of thunder. The timing was so dramatic, so absolutely\nyou\n, that it wasn\u2019t Aemond\u2019s fault when it inspired a harsh roll of his eye.\nHe could be dramatic too, if only to distract you from the way his lips quirked, the flash of a smile threatening to show itself in the darkness, or in the shine of the firelight still kissing fragments of his skin. Aemond knew this wasn\u2019t the time for jokes, yet even he could appreciate the irony of the trap\nhe\nlaid, and, quite gracefully, stepped right into.\nLightning forked through the sky on another crash of thunder, the flash cold in contrast to the warmth of the library. It was jarring, how the harsh, white light exposed everything, always, quickly and quietly before it melted back into the safety of blowing rain and raging waves.\nAnd yet, it was enough. Enough to see the tension weaving its way through Prince Aemond\u2019s jaw, and the set of his shoulders. How he hid his hands behind his back, no doubt clasped and curled in an unbreakable grip. Aemond clearly found no comfort here tonight. He held himself wound tight - even more so, almost, than he did when all the eyes watched him while at court.\nYou, on the other hand, were relaxed, given the circumstances. Lounging comfortably in the window seat while allowing the peace and the stillness to wash over you in the place you felt safest in all of King\u2019s Landing.\nGuilt\n, you realized, still sitting in his shadow.\nThis was what his guilt looked like.\nYou had wondered if Aemond could even feel such a thing.\n\u201cNo,\u201d you answered his question slowly. Let the bite fade from your voice and fall into the storm. Let it melt back into nothing. \u201cI believe I would choose \u2018\nisolate\n\u2019. I assumed neither one of us wanted that conversation to continue while clawing at each other\u2019s throats, as we were.\u201d\nAemond took a breath, inhaled loud and sharp in time with a sheet of rain being pushed against the windowpane. He looked away as you watched him, your feet uncurling from their place on the seat, the volume slipping through your fingers to rest beside you.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d\nYou stepped from the shadows and went to him, still hiding in the safety of the dark. He longed to reach for you, longed to feel your skin, warm from the fire, warm from the peace you always seemed to carve for yourself - but his fingertips were cold from the time he spent solitary in your rooms after you had gone. The fires burned to ashes as he tempered himself, once again, into honed steel that the prince sheathed - if only so he could see you again, without drawing blood once more. Now that he found you, he feared you would find only ice under his touch, instead of comfort.\nIt made his heart\nache\n.\nAnd\nyou\n-\nAemond shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, when he found his fingers threaded through yours.

The corners of your lips quirked, the prelude of a small smile illuminating the shadows Aemond still hid in. \u201cLet\u2019s go brew some tea and\u2026maybe we can talk.\u201d\nHis head dips in agreement, oddly silent since he last spoke. It was almost as if\u2026as if he wasn\u2019t sure the words that wanted to spill out would be the right ones.\nKind\nones.

My exile would not happen if I was human.\"\nThe cup of coffee was slammed on the table and the jail door thrown open as the sheriff stormed in. \"What does that mean, LIZARD?\" He bellowed at me while gripping the handle of his pistol tightly.\n\"What I did to be exiled is not a crime to you humans, but done by those who are well paid and respected.\" Sisst said just remaining in his seated position as he looked up at the furious man. \"I did what I did for love of my sister, if you would hear me out, I would explain.\"\n\"Then why not listen, Sheriff Calloway.\" The firm voice of a man shook the sheriff and made him spin. Standing at the door frame was an older human in a nice suit. \"Step out before you beat the lizard, and sit down.\" The sheriff looked ready to kick Sisst before he spun around and sat in the chair taking up his coffee. \"Now, what's your name and why are you here?\"\n\"I am Sisst, I have no tribe name after my exile. I saw a human town as I traveled for some place to live and tried here.\" Sisst, stood up and respectfully bowed to the new man.\n\"I'm Judge Walker. Why are you an exile?\" The man poured his own cup of coffee as he gave me a hard look.\n\"My sister, Hammu, grew ill and had something our people call the black lump. A growth that starts on the lungs and causes water breathing to be hampered if not impossible. It in time kills.\" Sisst just turned to pace a few steps in his cell. \"I took several trips into the swamp for specific ingredients to concoct a powerful sedative and healing potion.\"\n\"So you drugged your sister to death?\" The Sheriff said just ready to pounce like a cougar.\n\"No, I put her to sleep. With sharp knives and a steady hand I cut her body open, cut off the black lump and proceeded to sew her lung and scales shut. My crime is witchcraft and sorcery. My reason, was I wished to save my sister. Once she was awake, she recovered quite fast, but could do nothing to spare me as I did it without telling her first.\"\nThe judge just sipped his coffee a bit as he considered my story. \"Where did you learn all that you needed to do that?\"\n\"A book, I brought it with me but the Sheriff took it along with my few remaining possessions.\" Sisst said looking to the sheriff. A grumble and the man stood to grab the ragged leather sack that was Sisst's life. In it was a slightly ruined and damaged book. \"The first words sound so, good.\"\nThe judge read the first few lines aloud. \"By these teachings and in the eyes of the gods, I swear to never use my blade and teachings to cause undue harm and pain of others. I will freely give of my skill to the mending of body and healing of ills. I shall persevere to never abuse those under my care for any reason.\" Judge Walker than looked at several marked pages. \"Threads good for sewing up skin, knots and ties, even ways of cleaning a wound. It'sa medical textbook.\"\nThe sheriff just turned hearing that. \"He's no witch, but a doctor? Bull!!\"\n\"My sister lives, healed. I disobeyed my people to save her life. I do not regret it. I would obey my oath here too.\"\nThe judge just gave a soft scoff. \"The lizard doctor, Sisst. Might not be so bad. This town could use a doctor.\"",

        "story": "Thiten H\u00fbb began as a small fishing village, then became a charming trading port, and finally transformed into a delightful and exclusive holiday resort. Over the years, even the princes of Dol Amroth found refuge in this enchanting place with their families. It was situated in a small bay, well protected from stormy winds and waves that could erode its shores, as well as from the incursions of the pirates of Umbar. A villa of rough white stone, called B\u00e2r L\u00e1ranen, stood almost perched over the sea. Pink and violet bougainvillea climbed along its walls, and a row of olive trees, myrtles, and lemons surrounded and concealed it from view. A staircase carved into the rock led down to the small private cove, where a dock was built, and the princes' boats were always moored. These said princes, all young men between eighteen and twenty-five years of age, dressed in cool raw linen tunics and trousers rolled up to their ankles, were busy joking amongst themselves. They threw jests and colorful skeins of thread at each other and splashed water with their bare feet. Their laughter rose high into the light turquoise sky, rivaling the cries of the seagulls.\nNot far away, sitting with a discontented expression and her chin resting on her hand, Loth\u00edriel watched them with pouting lips. This particular year she felt more isolated than ever: during the winter she had given her first tribute as a woman and now could no longer participate in the rambunctious activities she loved to do with her brothers and cousins. She still remembered when just the year before, she could lift her skirts and walk barefoot around one of the boats while Elphir called her:\n\"Come, Looloo, help us prepare the nets!\"\n\"Alright, but I would like to come with you!\"\nErchirion had smiled and tousled her hair:\n\"You're too little for these things. Maybe next time.\"\nShe had turned her face away, annoyed, and had sighed in despair:\n\"Always next time...\"\nMeanwhile, the three brothers had boarded the boat, and as they moved away on the sparkling water, Amrothos had shouted back to her, laughing:\n\"Don't worry, Looloo. I'll teach you to fish next time. I promise!\"\nBut now that she was old enough to follow her brothers, that same condition prevented her from joining them. While the court at B\u00e2r L\u00e1ranen was small and life more relaxed, Loth\u00edriel found herself facing the new restrictions imposed by her transition to adulthood, making her even more annoyed and frustrated.\n\"Loth\u00edriel, straighten those shoulders and wear your hat.\"\nThe stern but gentle voice of her aunt Ivrinel cut through the air, her authoritative commands ringing clearly. Loth\u00edriel immediately straightened up, but in a tiny act of rebellion refused to wear the hat, letting the sun's glare hide her impending tears. She dearly loved her aunt, who had tried to be a guardian and affectionate companion since her mother's death, but she was not yet ready to yield to the impositions of her new condition.\nBored, she sat on the small woven straw chair and watched her aunt placidly weaving cotton thread. Amrothos noticed his sister's gaze and approached her quietly:\n\"Hey, Looloo, you could make yourself useful and learn as well: then you could weave our nets!\"\nLoth\u00edriel jumped and replied sharply:\n\"Don't call me that.\"\nShe tried to maintain her composure, and even though she adored her childhood nickname, it made her feel small and vulnerable. But Erchirion gave a complicit chuckle and supported his brother:\n\"And maybe you could wipe that gloomy expression off your face: you're making the sky darken!\"\n\"Ah, leave it be, Erchirion,\" Amrothos intervened, \"She's just upset because she can't play like a child anymore.\"\nShe glanced at her elder brother Elphir, who ignored her completely, focused on the fishing gear, making her feel even more invisible and isolated.\nAs every summer, the older cousins from Minas Tirith used to spend a few weeks at Thiten H\u00fbb as guests of their uncle, to rest from the exertions of academic studies and military training. Mostly, to escape the atmosphere of sadness and the suffocating pressure always present in the Steward's house.\nEven Faramir had approached her and smiled with an expression of pity in his eyes. This hurt her more than anything, but she stoically pressed her lips together. Faramir said gently:\n\"Don't fret too much, nethig: we will catch a fish for you. The fattest and tenderest, and we will roast it tonight with the most fragrant herbs in your honor.\"\n\"It's not the same.\"\nShe replied sullenly. He shrugged, being used to sharp responses and brusque manners since childhood. Even now, away from the pressure of Minas Tirith, Faramir maintained that patient calm he had learned as a child. He pulled back his hair and, with a little smile, went to confer with Elphir. Loth\u00edriel immediately regretted the rudeness she had shown to Faramir, hunched back over her chair, and bit her lip. At that moment, Boromir turned towards her, haloed by the sun's reflection. His long black hair waved in the breeze, and to her eyes, he appeared as one of those legendary heroes of ancient times: Beren or Tuor or even Elendil, whom she used to sigh over during her evening readings. Boromir, in turn, approached the young girl with an enchanting smile, and she immediately straightened up and tucked a dark curl behind her ear. If Faramir, with his sweetness and patience, was close to her heart as a brother, Boromir, with his charisma and imposing presence, represented everything she imagined in a hero. When he smiled at her, her heart began to beat faster, and Loth\u00edriel felt nervous and happy. For some time now, thinking about her cousin caused a sort of stir that made her agitated and euphoric at the same time, as if she had drunk a few drops too many of the sweet rose wine that Aunt Ivrinel hid in her dresser. Boromir addressed her playfully:\n\"So, little one, why don't you come fishing with us anymore?\"\nLoth\u00edriel squirmed in her chair as she felt the heat rise to her cheeks:\n\"It's just... that... I can't anymore.\"\nShe stammered, trying not to reveal too much. She was terribly embarrassed by her secret, yet she felt the need to appear mature and worthy in front of him, though somewhat intimidated by his presence. A flash of understanding crossed Boromir's blue eyes, so he crouched beside her and said in a warm, reassuring voice:\n\"Don't worry, Loth\u00edriel, we will find something fun to do together.\"\nBeing called by her full name made her feel special and important. She couldn't suppress a flirtatious smile as she asked:\n\"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really. Gweston!\"\nHe replied with a warm, enveloping laugh, placing a hand on his heart. Then he stood up and gave her a gentle pat on the head before joining the other boys. Loth\u00edriel watched him go, feeling the spot where he had touched her sizzle, her heart still in turmoil. She hoped he would keep his promise, and her lips curled into a satisfied smile.\n\"Loth\u00edriel, come help me with this thread.\"\nThe firm but gentle voice of her aunt called her back to reality.

As she walked over, she cast one last glance at the boys on the boat sailing away on the shimmering sea.

Maybe next time.\"\nShe had turned her face away, annoyed, and had sighed in despair:\n\"Always next time...\"\nMeanwhile, the three brothers had boarded the boat, and as they moved away on the sparkling water, Amrothos had shouted back to her, laughing:\n\"Don't worry, Looloo. I'll teach you to fish next time. I promise!\"\nBut now that she was old enough to follow her brothers, that same condition prevented her from joining them. While the court at B\u00e2r L\u00e1ranen was small and life more relaxed, Loth\u00edriel found herself facing the new restrictions imposed by her transition to adulthood, making her even more annoyed and frustrated.\n\"Loth\u00edriel, straighten those shoulders and wear your hat.\"\nThe stern but gentle voice of her aunt Ivrinel cut through the air, her authoritative commands ringing clearly. Loth\u00edriel immediately straightened up, but in a tiny act of rebellion refused to wear the hat, letting the sun's glare hide her impending tears. She dearly loved her aunt, who had tried to be a guardian and affectionate companion since her mother's death, but she was not yet ready to yield to the impositions of her new condition.\nBored, she sat on the small woven straw chair and watched her aunt placidly weaving cotton thread. Amrothos noticed his sister's gaze and approached her quietly:\n\"Hey, Looloo, you could make yourself useful and learn as well: then you could weave our nets!\"\nLoth\u00edriel jumped and replied sharply:\n\"Don't call me that.\"\nShe tried to maintain her composure, and even though she adored her childhood nickname, it made her feel small and vulnerable. But Erchirion gave a complicit chuckle and supported his brother:\n\"And maybe you could wipe that gloomy expression off your face: you're making the sky darken!\"\n\"Ah, leave it be, Erchirion,\" Amrothos intervened, \"She's just upset because she can't play like a child anymore.\"\nShe glanced at her elder brother Elphir, who ignored her completely, focused on the fishing gear, making her feel even more invisible and isolated.\nAs every summer, the older cousins from Minas Tirith used to spend a few weeks at Thiten H\u00fbb as guests of their uncle, to rest from the exertions of academic studies and military training. Mostly, to escape the atmosphere of sadness and the suffocating pressure always present in the Steward's house.\nEven Faramir had approached her and smiled with an expression of pity in his eyes. This hurt her more than anything, but she stoically pressed her lips together. Faramir said gently:\n\"Don't fret too much, nethig: we will catch a fish for you. The fattest and tenderest, and we will roast it tonight with the most fragrant herbs in your honor.\"\n\"It's not the same.\"\nShe replied sullenly. He shrugged, being used to sharp responses and brusque manners since childhood. Even now, away from the pressure of Minas Tirith, Faramir maintained that patient calm he had learned as a child. He pulled back his hair and, with a little smile, went to confer with Elphir. Loth\u00edriel immediately regretted the rudeness she had shown to Faramir, hunched back over her chair, and bit her lip. At that moment, Boromir turned towards her, haloed by the sun's reflection. His long black hair waved in the breeze, and to her eyes, he appeared as one of those legendary heroes of ancient times: Beren or Tuor or even Elendil, whom she used to sigh over during her evening readings. Boromir, in turn, approached the young girl with an enchanting smile, and she immediately straightened up and tucked a dark curl behind her ear. If Faramir, with his sweetness and patience, was close to her heart as a brother, Boromir, with his charisma and imposing presence, represented everything she imagined in a hero. When he smiled at her, her heart began to beat faster, and Loth\u00edriel felt nervous and happy. For some time now, thinking about her cousin caused a sort of stir that made her agitated and euphoric at the same time, as if she had drunk a few drops too many of the sweet rose wine that Aunt Ivrinel hid in her dresser. Boromir addressed her playfully:\n\"So, little one, why don't you come fishing with us anymore?\"\nLoth\u00edriel squirmed in her chair as she felt the heat rise to her cheeks:\n\"It's just... that... I can't anymore.\"\nShe stammered, trying not to reveal too much. She was terribly embarrassed by her secret, yet she felt the need to appear mature and worthy in front of him, though somewhat intimidated by his presence. A flash of understanding crossed Boromir's blue eyes, so he crouched beside her and said in a warm, reassuring voice:\n\"Don't worry, Loth\u00edriel, we will find something fun to do together.\"\nBeing called by her full name made her feel special and important. She couldn't suppress a flirtatious smile as she asked:\n\"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really. Gweston!\"\nHe replied with a warm, enveloping laugh, placing a hand on his heart. Then he stood up and gave her a gentle pat on the head before joining the other boys. Loth\u00edriel watched him go, feeling the spot where he had touched her sizzle, her heart still in turmoil. She hoped he would keep his promise, and her lips curled into a satisfied smile.\n\"Loth\u00edriel, come help me with this thread.\"\nThe firm but gentle voice of her aunt called her back to reality. Indeed, Ivrinel's attentive eyes had not missed the sighs and yearnings of her niece. Loth\u00edriel sighed slightly but obediently approached her aunt. As she walked over, she cast one last glance at the boys on the boat sailing away on the shimmering sea. With a sigh, she began to work alongside Ivrinel, but her mind kept returning to that smile and that promise. She vowed that one day she would find a way to spend time alone with Boromir, and that thought filled her heart with a sweet and eager anticipation.",

        "story": "Thiten H\u00fbb began as a small fishing village, then became a charming trading port, and finally transformed into a delightful and exclusive holiday resort. Over the years, even the princes of Dol Amroth found refuge in this enchanting place with their families. It was situated in a small bay, well protected from stormy winds and waves that could erode its shores, as well as from the incursions of the pirates of Umbar. A villa of rough white stone, called B\u00e2r L\u00e1ranen, stood almost perched over the sea. Pink and violet bougainvillea climbed along its walls, and a row of olive trees, myrtles, and lemons surrounded and concealed it from view. A staircase carved into the rock led down to the small private cove, where a dock was built, and the princes' boats were always moored. These said princes, all young men between eighteen and twenty-five years of age, dressed in cool raw linen tunics and trousers rolled up to their ankles, were busy joking amongst themselves. They threw jests and colorful skeins of thread at each other and splashed water with their bare feet. Their laughter rose high into the light turquoise sky, rivaling the cries of the seagulls.\nNot far away, sitting with a discontented expression and her chin resting on her hand, Loth\u00edriel watched them with pouting lips. This particular year she felt more isolated than ever: during the winter she had given her first tribute as a woman and now could no longer participate in the rambunctious activities she loved to do with her brothers and cousins. She still remembered when just the year before, she could lift her skirts and walk barefoot around one of the boats while Elphir called her:\n\"Come, Looloo, help us prepare the nets!\"\n\"Alright, but I would like to come with you!\"\nErchirion had smiled and tousled her hair:\n\"You're too little for these things.

        "writing_prompt": "A band of treasure hunters arrives in a desert town, claiming to have a map to the fabled Lost City\u2014a place shrouded in mystery, greed, and divine curses. But as whispers of their quest spread, the locals wonder: are they brave, foolish, or something far more dangerous?",
        "story": "The lust for gold lies within every heart, however well-hidden it may be. Or, at least, that is what the dwarves of the Ironside Mountains say. And, whatever the truth of this proverb in general, it was surely in the minds of the people of Ain-Qisam that evening, when they saw the motley collection of outsiders stumble into their little town. Judging from appearances, these strange folk were adventurers, which in the desert usually meant treasure hunters. Or perhaps grave robbers--though to the Ishkarim this was less an act of desecration and more an inevitable fact of life. Camels spat, sand stung your eyes, jackals looted tombs. In these more enlightened days they burned their dead anyway. So no one in Ain-Qisam paid much attention to the visitors, save to note that some were foreigners while others were not. The large golem that travelled with them raised a few eyebrowsbut, after all, the art of golemancy was not unknown or even very obscure. According to some of the better-educated townsfolk, it was a particularly impressive specimen, but even that was not sufficient to distract them from their own concerns. Their indifference did not last for long, however, once they had learned *why* this particular band of treasure hunters had come to their town. Fevered conversation gripped the marketplace as the locals packed away their wares: \"The Lost City? Are you deaf or are they insane?\" \"My ears are as good as ever they were, thank you. But yes, they seek the Lost City.\" A shrug, careless and dismissive. \"It is not the first time. It will not be the last. People will seek after anything that is lost.\" \"How else are things to be found?\" This from Jinan, the town's lone Priest of Naukar, whose opinion on such things was both predictable and hopelessly biased. \"The Lost City is lost by the will of the gods. Why do these fools believe they can find it?\" \"The will of the gods?\" A snort. \"No; it was *men* who decreed the city should be lost.

I wished the woman\u2019s head would fall deftly from her neck to the grass. A trophy for my trouble. I stood in the rosebush behind the stone wall in Stintino, witnessing the dismemberment of my childhood. The roses were pink, not red. The color of a kitten\u2019s nose, or cold chicken breast. The woman\u2019s body bore through its constraints so that the silk bloomed into creases, syrupy yellow like limoncello. Despite my callow rage, I leaned closer, thorns against my fingers, stomach melting into my thighs. When my father began to inch the yellow dress upward, I turned and ran up the path to my house.\nIt had happened twice before: my witnessing. Once earlier that same summer and another time the summer before. Always in the rose garden, my father traced the waistlines of strange women. Every incident, I thought of my mother: wiping her hands on her orange skirt, smelling of cilantro, laughing at a line in one of the sizable novels she read. I thought of how my father touched my mother\u2019s face, fingers trailing her jaw, mapping familiar territory. Something about that touch was different than with the women in the garden, though I couldn\u2019t say what. I was too young to understand the intricacies of possession. I thought of how my mother\u2019s mouth would fall into an injured O, how she might never again hold my chin and say, \u201cYou look so like your father,\u201d and I could not tell her about the garden. I worried that, like the window-flying white birds I sometimes found lying on our balcony, the ones my mother called her little soldiers, she would die.

From his forehead to his toenails, my father was perfect.\nThat last time I saw him in the garden, I heard him following me while I ran up the path. I have a theory that men walk with heavy footsteps. They don\u2019t care about disturbing the peace because the peace never occurred to them as important. Women, in my theory, walk with a tender footfall, toes kissing the ground. This generalization is based entirely on my parents. As I got older, I made an effort to think of my mother whenever my feet touched the earth. My tread grew light as a forest fox, out of respect for my mother and a conspiratorial urge to sneak up on my father. I fancied myself the secret police of my mother\u2019s regime. That summer night, I fled the scene barefoot, carrying my shoes, one in each hand. My father grabbed me by the collar at the base of an Aleppo pine and looked into my eyes, pointing a finger in my face.\n\u201cYou will not say anything to her.

The five women have grown old coming together, every other month or so for the last thirty or more years, around one another\u2019s table. Ruth, Bridget, Farah, Lotte, and Bessie are longtime New Yorkers; their origins in California, County Mayo, Tehran, Vienna, and the Bronx might have grounded them but do not in these days often surface.\nRuth was a retired lawyer. She said, \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten, of course, who it was said that there are four or five people in the world to whom we tell things, and that\u2019s us. Something happens and I think, I\u2019ll tell the next ladies\u2019 lunch.\u201d\n\u201cTrue! It\u2019s true,\u201d Lotte said. \u201cWhen I suddenly sat on my rear on the sidewalk outside my front door, I was looking forward to telling you.\u201d\nLotte had turned out to need a hip replacement. Dr. Goodman, the surgeon, was a furry man like a character in an Ed Koren cartoon, only jollier. He had promised Lotte, \u201cFrom here on it\u2019s all good.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m eighty-two years old,\u201d Lotte had said.\nGoodman told her, \u201cI\u2019m on my way to the ninety-second birthday of a patient whose knees I replaced eleven years ago.\u201d\nBessie said, \u201cAnd I told you, from my poor Colin\u2019s experience, that the recovery is not so much like Goodman\u2019s cheery projection.\u201d These days, it depended on the state of Colin\u2019s health and Colin\u2019s mood whether Bessie was able to take the train in from Old Rockingham.\n\u2022\nToday\u2019s lunch was at Bridget\u2019s, so she got to set the agenda: \u201c \u2018How to Prevent the Inevitable.\u2019 I mean any of the scenarios we would rather die than live in.\u201d Bridget was a writer who still spent mornings at her computer.\nRunning the New York City Marathon at Age Eighty-Six\nFarah, a recently retired doctor, said, \u201cThe old problem of shuffling off this mortal coil.\u201d\n\u201cOf shuffling off,\u201d Lotte said.\n\u201cAnd it was you who said you wanted to see it all, to see what would happen to the end,\u201d Farah reminded Lotte.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t counting on the twenty-four-hour caregiver or the heart-healthy diet,\u201d said Lotte. \u201cYou doctors need to do a study of the correlation between salt-free food and depression.\u201d\n\u201cYour Sarah seems pleasant enough,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d\n\u201cThat she\u2019s in my living room,\u201d Lotte said, \u201cwatching television; that she\u2019s in my kitchen eating her lunch, which she does standing up; that she\u2019s in my spare room asleep, and in my bathroom whenever I want to go in.\u201d\nRuth asked Lotte what Sarah did for her. \u201cDo you need a caregiver to help you dress?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lotte said.\n\u201cYou need a caregiver to help you shower?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lotte said.\n\u201cGet your meals?\u201d\n\u201cGod, _no! _\u201d\n\u201cSo what do you need help with?\u201d\n\u201cThe caregiver,\u201d Lotte said.\n\u201cGo away,\u201d she said to Sarah, who had come to take her home. The four friends\u2019 mouths dropped to see their friend raise her arm at the caregiver and slap the air.\n\u2022\nThey were of an age when they worried if one of them did not answer her telephone.\nBessie, Lotte\u2019s oldest friend, had known Sam since he was a baby. She called him from Connecticut. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the caregiver pick up Lotte\u2019s phone?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s gone. There was just too much abuse.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me! What? That nice Sarah? You\u2019re talking elder abuse?\u201d\n\u201cMore like caregiver abuse,\u201d Sam said.\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\u201cLike Mom would change the channel Sarah was watching on the TV. She\u2019d come into the kitchen and pack away the food Sarah was preparing for her lunch, and turn on the light when Sarah was asleep. It was getting bizarre. I\u2019m here waiting with her for the new woman.\u201d\n\u2022\nBessie e-mailed the friends in New York to look in on Lotte.\nBridget went to see Lotte. Bridget, Lotte, and Shareen, the new caregiver, sat looking out on Riverside Drive. Lotte said, \u201cShareen drives in from New Jersey. Shareen has a five-year-old who brushes his own teeth. Shareen told him that if he doesn\u2019t brush, a roach will grow in his mouth.\u201d\nBessie phoned Lotte. \u201cHow is the new caregiver?\u201d\n\u201cIntrusive,\u201d said Lotte.\nWhen Farah called Lotte, it was Sam who picked up the phone. \u201cShareen is gone. Mom locked her\u2014I can\u2019t make out if it was into or out of the bathroom, but it wasn\u2019t that. Shareen did not want to have to manhandle Mom to stop her eating sugar by the spoonfuls.\u201d\n\u201cLotte is angry,\u201d Farah said. \u201cAfter making your own decisions your life long, it must be hell having someone tell you what you can eat and when to shower and what to wear.\u201d\n\u201cBecause her own decisions are not tenable,\u201d Sam said. \u201cGreg is coming in from Chicago.\u201d Gregor was Lotte\u2019s younger son. \u201cWe\u2019re going to check out this nice assisted-living home. It sounds really nice. Upscale.\u201d\n\u201cSam? You\u2019re moving Lotte out of her apartment?\u201d\n\u201cTo a nice home in the country.\u201d\n\u201cA home in the country. You discussed this move with Lotte?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she has agreed?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes, she has. In a way,\u201d Sam said. \u201cShe said next year, maybe. Listen. Mom cannot deal with the round-the-clock caregivers. And believe me that she does not, does not, want to move in with Diana and me.\u201d\n\u2022\nBridget phoned Sam. \u201cSo, what\u2019s this place you want to move Lotte into?\u201d\n\u201cCalled Three Trees. It\u2019s in the Hudson Valley,\u201d Sam told her. \u201cMy brother will help me move Mom in, and move the stuff she\u2019s fond of\u2014the famous velvet sofa.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she will have an apartment of her own?\u201d\n\u201cA bedsitter, neat and convenient, with her own bathroom and a breakfast nook.\u201d\n\u201cHer own nook,\u201d Bridget said. \u201cWhat\u2019s outside the window?\u201d\n\u201cThe Hudson River view, unfortunately, is on the other side of the building. Trees. There\u2019s a little parking lot and lots of green. Listen. We know Mom would prefer Manhattan\u2014which would have been a hell of a lot more convenient for Diana and me to visit her\u2014but who can afford something nice in the city?\u201d\nBridget said, \u201cIt\u2019s that none of us drives these days. How are we going to visit?\u201d\n\u201cOne of the advantages is that there will always be people around.\u201d\n\u201cDoes Lotte think this is an advantage?\u201d\nSam said, \u201cI have never been in a situation where there hasn\u2019t been somebody to talk with.\u201d\n\u201cI have,\u201d said Bridget.\n\u201cAnd I would know she\u2019s getting three proper meals.\u201d\nGod. Poor Lotte, thought Bridget. And poor Sam. \u201cYou\u2019re not a happy camper,\u201d she said to him, wondering what the phrase came from.\n\u2022\nRuth, an old activist, had an idea. She said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Sam.\u201d\n\u201cHave you closed on the Hudson Valley place?\u201d she asked him.\n\u201cGreg and I are going up on Thursday.\u201d\nRuth said, \u201cWill you give us a couple of days to figure something out?\u201d\n\u201cBelieve me, there is nothing to . . . Yes, sure. O.K. But I need to get Mom and her stuff moved before Greg leaves for Chicago.\u201d\nRuth said, \u201cCould Lotte live alone if\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\u201cSam, wait. Could Lotte live alone if the four of us\u2014the three of us if Bessie can\u2019t come in\u2014take turns checking on Lotte, to see what she needs and if anything is wrong?\u201d\n\u201cMom would put sugar on her bread and butter.\u201d\n\u201cSounds delicious,\u201d Ruth said.\n\u201cShe would never change her clothes.\u201d\n\u201cProbably not.\u201d\n\u201cShe would have one shower a week. She would not shower.\u201d\n\u201cSam! So what!\u201d\n\u201cNot on my watch,\u201d Sam said. \u201cThings need to be done right.\u201d\n\u201cNo, they don\u2019t. Why do they need to be right?\u201d\n\u201cWhen Mom messed up her medicines, Greg and I had to rush her to Emergency. She might have died.\u201d\n\u201cYes. She might. Your mother might have died in her own bed, in sight of the Empire State Building and the George Washington Bridge. No, but Sam, we will go up and check on her. Let\u2019s try it\u2014a couple of days.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if she falls down again?\u201d\n\u201cShe falls down. Sam, I\u2019ll sleep over there tonight.\u201d\nRuth slept over at Lotte\u2019s, and Lotte fell going from her bed to the bathroom. Ruth called Sam, and Sam and Gregor came and took Lotte to Emergency.\n\u2022\nSamson and Gregor moved their mother, the sofa, and whatever else out of Lotte\u2019s ample apartment could be made to fit, into the bedsitter in the Hudson Valley. Greg flew back to Chicago.\n\u2022\nWhen the ladies\u2019 lunch met in Farah\u2019s apartment, the agenda was Lotte\u2019s rescue. Farah had a plan.\nThey brought each other up to date.\nLotte had phoned Ruth from Three Trees. Ruth said, \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize her voice. I mean, I knew that it was Lotte, but her voice sounded different, strangled, a new, strange voice.\u201d\n\u201cLotte is furious,\u201d Bessie said.\n\u201cYes, I know that voice,\u201d Bridget said. \u201cLotte called me. She remembered my sitting with her and Shareen. She wanted me to get Shareen\u2019s phone number. Shareen drives a car. Lotte wants Shareen to come and pick her up at Three Trees and drive her home to the apartment. Which is not going to happen.\u201d\n\u201cNow when I go abroad I tell everyone Im a Canadian goose.\u201d\n\u201cNow when I go abroad I tell everyone I\u2019m a Canadian goose.\u201d\nCopy link to cartoon\nLink copied\nShop\n\u201cLotte called me,\u201d reported Farah. \u201cShe wants us\u2014her and me\u2014to rent a car together. I told her I haven\u2019t renewed my license. I doubt if I could pass the eye test. Not a problem, Lotte said. She would drive.\u201d\n\u201cDoes she even have a license?\u201d\n\u201cLotte hasn\u2019t driven in ten years.\u201d\nBessie said, \u201cSam called me and he was fit to be tied. Wanted to know if I had something to do with Lotte buying a car. Buying a car! Me? I have never actually bought a car in my life. Lotte believes that she has bought a car and keeps calling this dealer to send her the keys.\u201d\nBessie had called Lotte and asked her, \u201cWhat\u2019s this about a car?\u201d Lotte said, \u201cIt\u2019s down there in the parking lot.\u201d \u201cWhat kind of a car is this?\u201d Bessie had asked her, and Lotte said, \u201cI\u2019m waiting till they send me the virtual key.\u201d\n\u2022\nFarah\u2019s plan: Farah had an eighteen-year-old grandson, Hami. He would have his license as soon as he passed his test. \u201cHe\u2019ll drive us to Three Trees, and we will bring Lotte back.\u201d\n\u201cBetter be soon,\u201d Bessie said. \u201cSam is putting Lotte\u2019s apartment on the market.\u201d\n\u201cThe test is this Monday.\u201d\nBut Hami failed his test.\n\u2022\nBridget phoned Lotte at Three Trees. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d\n\u201cNot good.\u201d\n\u201cHow is the food?\u201d\n\u201cSalt free.\u201d\n\u201cJudging from your voice, you\u2019re getting a little bit used to being there?\u201d\n\u201cCan you come and get me and take me back to my apartment?\u201d\n\u201cLotte, we just really wouldn\u2019t know how. For the moment, might it be a good idea to accommodate yourself?\u201d\n\u201cYes. But I need to go home,\u201d Lotte said.\n\u201cHave you found anyone to talk to?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Alana. She sits next to me in the dining room. Alana has three children and five grandchildren, the oldest nineteen, the twins age thirteen, and a nine- and a five-year-old. Would you like me to tell you what their names are?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\u201cWould you like me to tell you where each of them goes to school?\u201d\n\u201cLotte . . . \u201d\n\u201cMinnie Mansfield has a grandson. His name is Joel, and Joel has a friend whose name is Sam, like my Sam. Shall I tell you which colleges Sam and which colleges Joel are considering going to?\u201d\n\u201cLotte . . . \u201d\n\u201cMinnie\u2019s sister\u2019s granddaughter,\u201d said Lotte, \u201cis thinking of taking a gap year before she goes to Williams.\u201d\n\u201cLotte . . . \u201d\nLotte said, \u201cI have not told Alana or Minnie that I\u2019ve died. I thought awhile before telling Sam, but he was fine. He was really very good about it, my poor Sam.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean that you feel as if . . . \u201d Bridget hesitated between saying \u201cas if you have died\u201d and \u201cas if you are dead.\u201d\nLotte said, \u201cNo. I am dead. If I saw Dr. Goodman\u2014or any doctor\u2014he would look down my throat and see the four yellow spots dead people have. When you write the story, the question is whether, now that I am dead, I can die again, a second time, or is this what it is from here on.\u201d\n\u201cLotte, you want me to write your story?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already written how I got rid of Sarah and Shareen, and the roach in Shareen\u2019s five-year-old\u2019s mouth, and about Sam and Greg putting me here in the boonies.\u201d\n\u201cLotte,\u201d Bridget said, \u201cwe\u2019re mobilizing ourselves. We\u2019re trying to figure out how to come and visit you.\u201d\n\u201cGood! Oh, oh, good, good!\u201d Lotte said. She wanted them to give her enough lead time so she could arrange a ladies\u2019 lunch in the Three Trees dining room. \u201cThen I\u2019ll tell you how I lay down on my sofa\u2014this was last Friday\u2014just to take a nap, and when I woke up I knew that I was going to die, and I died.\u201d\n\u2022\nSam has taken time off twice this month to go and visit his mother. He feels that she is settling in. \u201cWhen she says that she has died she means died to the old New York life in order to pass into the new life at Three Trees.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you think she means?\u201d Bessie asks him.\n\u201cWhat else could she mean?\u201d\nBessie is silent a moment. She says, \u201cLotte has stopped calling me.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sam says. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t call me, and she doesn\u2019t return Diana\u2019s calls.\u201d\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t pick up her phone.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sam says.\n\u2022\nBessie is pretty much stuck in Old Rockingham. Colin seems to be on the decline. Poor Bridget didn\u2019t make it to the last ladies\u2019 lunch, because she had one of her frequent debilitating headaches, but she wants to come along if Ruth and Farah figure out how to go and visit Lotte.\nThe idea to hitch a ride with Sam when he drives up to Three Trees gets screwed up because Lotte does not return Farah\u2019s call. \u201cAnd then I guess I forgot to call her,\u201d Ruth says. \u201cIn any case, there wouldn\u2019t have really been time to change my doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d\n\u2022\nHami has got his license and has driven his new secondhand car to his first semester at Purchase.\n\u2022\nFarah and Bridget still mean to figure out some way to go up and see Lotte, maybe in the spring, when the weather is nicer. \u2666",

The four friends\u2019 mouths dropped to see their friend raise her arm at the caregiver and slap the air.\n\u2022\nThey were of an age when they worried if one of them did not answer her telephone.\nBessie, Lotte\u2019s oldest friend, had known Sam since he was a baby. She called him from Connecticut. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the caregiver pick up Lotte\u2019s phone?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s gone. There was just too much abuse.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me! What? That nice Sarah? You\u2019re talking elder abuse?\u201d\n\u201cMore like caregiver abuse,\u201d Sam said.\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\u201cLike Mom would change the channel Sarah was watching on the TV. She\u2019d come into the kitchen and pack away the food Sarah was preparing for her lunch, and turn on the light when Sarah was asleep. It was getting bizarre. I\u2019m here waiting with her for the new woman.\u201d\n\u2022\nBessie e-mailed the friends in New York to look in on Lotte.\nBridget went to see Lotte. Bridget, Lotte, and Shareen, the new caregiver, sat looking out on Riverside Drive. Lotte said, \u201cShareen drives in from New Jersey. Shareen has a five-year-old who brushes his own teeth. Shareen told him that if he doesn\u2019t brush, a roach will grow in his mouth.\u201d\nBessie phoned Lotte. \u201cHow is the new caregiver?\u201d\n\u201cIntrusive,\u201d said Lotte.\nWhen Farah called Lotte, it was Sam who picked up the phone. \u201cShareen is gone. Mom locked her\u2014I can\u2019t make out if it was into or out of the bathroom, but it wasn\u2019t that. Shareen did not want to have to manhandle Mom to stop her eating sugar by the spoonfuls.\u201d\n\u201cLotte is angry,\u201d Farah said. \u201cAfter making your own decisions your life long, it must be hell having someone tell you what you can eat and when to shower and what to wear.\u201d\n\u201cBecause her own decisions are not tenable,\u201d Sam said. \u201cGreg is coming in from Chicago.\u201d Gregor was Lotte\u2019s younger son. \u201cWe\u2019re going to check out this nice assisted-living home. It sounds really nice. Upscale.\u201d\n\u201cSam? You\u2019re moving Lotte out of her apartment?\u201d\n\u201cTo a nice home in the country.\u201d\n\u201cA home in the country. You discussed this move with Lotte?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she has agreed?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes, she has. In a way,\u201d Sam said. \u201cShe said next year, maybe. Listen. Mom cannot deal with the round-the-clock caregivers. And believe me that she does not, does not, want to move in with Diana and me.\u201d\n\u2022\nBridget phoned Sam. \u201cSo, what\u2019s this place you want to move Lotte into?\u201d\n\u201cCalled Three Trees. It\u2019s in the Hudson Valley,\u201d Sam told her. \u201cMy brother will help me move Mom in, and move the stuff she\u2019s fond of\u2014the famous velvet sofa.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she will have an apartment of her own?\u201d\n\u201cA bedsitter, neat and convenient, with her own bathroom and a breakfast nook.\u201d\n\u201cHer own nook,\u201d Bridget said. \u201cWhat\u2019s outside the window?\u201d\n\u201cThe Hudson River view, unfortunately, is on the other side of the building. Trees. There\u2019s a little parking lot and lots of green. Listen. We know Mom would prefer Manhattan\u2014which would have been a hell of a lot more convenient for Diana and me to visit her\u2014but who can afford something nice in the city?\u201d\nBridget said, \u201cIt\u2019s that none of us drives these days. How are we going to visit?\u201d\n\u201cOne of the advantages is that there will always be people around.\u201d\n\u201cDoes Lotte think this is an advantage?\u201d\nSam said, \u201cI have never been in a situation where there hasn\u2019t been somebody to talk with.\u201d\n\u201cI have,\u201d said Bridget.\n\u201cAnd I would know she\u2019s getting three proper meals.\u201d\nGod. Poor Lotte, thought Bridget. And poor Sam. \u201cYou\u2019re not a happy camper,\u201d she said to him, wondering what the phrase came from.\n\u2022\nRuth, an old activist, had an idea. She said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Sam.\u201d\n\u201cHave you closed on the Hudson Valley place?\u201d she asked him.\n\u201cGreg and I are going up on Thursday.\u201d\nRuth said, \u201cWill you give us a couple of days to figure something out?\u201d\n\u201cBelieve me, there is nothing to . . . Yes, sure. O.K. But I need to get Mom and her stuff moved before Greg leaves for Chicago.\u201d\nRuth said, \u201cCould Lotte live alone if\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\u201cSam, wait. Could Lotte live alone if the four of us\u2014the three of us if Bessie can\u2019t come in\u2014take turns checking on Lotte, to see what she needs and if anything is wrong?\u201d\n\u201cMom would put sugar on her bread and butter.\u201d\n\u201cSounds delicious,\u201d Ruth said.\n\u201cShe would never change her clothes.\u201d\n\u201cProbably not.\u201d\n\u201cShe would have one shower a week. She would not shower.\u201d\n\u201cSam! So what!\u201d\n\u201cNot on my watch,\u201d Sam said. \u201cThings need to be done right.\u201d\n\u201cNo, they don\u2019t. Why do they need to be right?\u201d\n\u201cWhen Mom messed up her medicines, Greg and I had to rush her to Emergency. She might have died.\u201d\n\u201cYes. She might. Your mother might have died in her own bed, in sight of the Empire State Building and the George Washington Bridge. No, but Sam, we will go up and check on her. Let\u2019s try it\u2014a couple of days.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if she falls down again?\u201d\n\u201cShe falls down. Sam, I\u2019ll sleep over there tonight.\u201d\nRuth slept over at Lotte\u2019s, and Lotte fell going from her bed to the bathroom. Ruth called Sam, and Sam and Gregor came and took Lotte to Emergency.\n\u2022\nSamson and Gregor moved their mother, the sofa, and whatever else out of Lotte\u2019s ample apartment could be made to fit, into the bedsitter in the Hudson Valley. Greg flew back to Chicago.\n\u2022\nWhen the ladies\u2019 lunch met in Farah\u2019s apartment, the agenda was Lotte\u2019s rescue. Farah had a plan.\nThey brought each other up to date.\nLotte had phoned Ruth from Three Trees. Ruth said, \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize her voice. I mean, I knew that it was Lotte, but her voice sounded different, strangled, a new, strange voice.\u201d\n\u201cLotte is furious,\u201d Bessie said.\n\u201cYes, I know that voice,\u201d Bridget said. \u201cLotte called me. She remembered my sitting with her and Shareen. She wanted me to get Shareen\u2019s phone number. Shareen drives a car. Lotte wants Shareen to come and pick her up at Three Trees and drive her home to the apartment. Which is not going to happen.\u201d\n\u201cNow when I go abroad I tell everyone Im a Canadian goose.\u201d\n\u201cNow when I go abroad I tell everyone I\u2019m a Canadian goose.\u201d\nCopy link to cartoon\nLink copied\nShop\n\u201cLotte called me,\u201d reported Farah. \u201cShe wants us\u2014her and me\u2014to rent a car together. I told her I haven\u2019t renewed my license. I doubt if I could pass the eye test. Not a problem, Lotte said. She would drive.\u201d\n\u201cDoes she even have a license?\u201d\n\u201cLotte hasn\u2019t driven in ten years.\u201d\nBessie said, \u201cSam called me and he was fit to be tied. Wanted to know if I had something to do with Lotte buying a car. Buying a car! Me? I have never actually bought a car in my life. Lotte believes that she has bought a car and keeps calling this dealer to send her the keys.\u201d\nBessie had called Lotte and asked her, \u201cWhat\u2019s this about a car?\u201d Lotte said, \u201cIt\u2019s down there in the parking lot.\u201d \u201cWhat kind of a car is this?\u201d Bessie had asked her, and Lotte said, \u201cI\u2019m waiting till they send me the virtual key.\u201d\n\u2022\nFarah\u2019s plan: Farah had an eighteen-year-old grandson, Hami. He would have his license as soon as he passed his test. \u201cHe\u2019ll drive us to Three Trees, and we will bring Lotte back.\u201d\n\u201cBetter be soon,\u201d Bessie said. \u201cSam is putting Lotte\u2019s apartment on the market.\u201d\n\u201cThe test is this Monday.\u201d\nBut Hami failed his test.\n\u2022\nBridget phoned Lotte at Three Trees. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d\n\u201cNot good.\u201d\n\u201cHow is the food?\u201d\n\u201cSalt free.\u201d\n\u201cJudging from your voice, you\u2019re getting a little bit used to being there?\u201d\n\u201cCan you come and get me and take me back to my apartment?\u201d\n\u201cLotte, we just really wouldn\u2019t know how. For the moment, might it be a good idea to accommodate yourself?\u201d\n\u201cYes. But I need to go home,\u201d Lotte said.\n\u201cHave you found anyone to talk to?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Alana. She sits next to me in the dining room. Alana has three children and five grandchildren, the oldest nineteen, the twins age thirteen, and a nine- and a five-year-old. Would you like me to tell you what their names are?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\u201cWould you like me to tell you where each of them goes to school?\u201d\n\u201cLotte . . . \u201d\n\u201cMinnie Mansfield has a grandson. His name is Joel, and Joel has a friend whose name is Sam, like my Sam. Shall I tell you which colleges Sam and which colleges Joel are considering going to?\u201d\n\u201cLotte . . . \u201d\n\u201cMinnie\u2019s sister\u2019s granddaughter,\u201d said Lotte, \u201cis thinking of taking a gap year before she goes to Williams.\u201d\n\u201cLotte . . . \u201d\nLotte said, \u201cI have not told Alana or Minnie that I\u2019ve died. I thought awhile before telling Sam, but he was fine. He was really very good about it, my poor Sam.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean that you feel as if . . . \u201d Bridget hesitated between saying \u201cas if you have died\u201d and \u201cas if you are dead.\u201d\nLotte said, \u201cNo. I am dead. If I saw Dr. Goodman\u2014or any doctor\u2014he would look down my throat and see the four yellow spots dead people have. When you write the story, the question is whether, now that I am dead, I can die again, a second time, or is this what it is from here on.\u201d\n\u201cLotte, you want me to write your story?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already written how I got rid of Sarah and Shareen, and the roach in Shareen\u2019s five-year-old\u2019s mouth, and about Sam and Greg putting me here in the boonies.\u201d\n\u201cLotte,\u201d Bridget said, \u201cwe\u2019re mobilizing ourselves. We\u2019re trying to figure out how to come and visit you.\u201d\n\u201cGood! Oh, oh, good, good!\u201d Lotte said. She wanted them to give her enough lead time so she could arrange a ladies\u2019 lunch in the Three Trees dining room. \u201cThen I\u2019ll tell you how I lay down on my sofa\u2014this was last Friday\u2014just to take a nap, and when I woke up I knew that I was going to die, and I died.\u201d\n\u2022\nSam has taken time off twice this month to go and visit his mother. He feels that she is settling in. \u201cWhen she says that she has died she means died to the old New York life in order to pass into the new life at Three Trees.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you think she means?\u201d Bessie asks him.\n\u201cWhat else could she mean?\u201d\nBessie is silent a moment. She says, \u201cLotte has stopped calling me.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sam says. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t call me, and she doesn\u2019t return Diana\u2019s calls.\u201d\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t pick up her phone.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sam says.\n\u2022\nBessie is pretty much stuck in Old Rockingham. Colin seems to be on the decline. Poor Bridget didn\u2019t make it to the last ladies\u2019 lunch, because she had one of her frequent debilitating headaches, but she wants to come along if Ruth and Farah figure out how to go and visit Lotte.\nThe idea to hitch a ride with Sam when he drives up to Three Trees gets screwed up because Lotte does not return Farah\u2019s call. \u201cAnd then I guess I forgot to call her,\u201d Ruth says. \u201cIn any case, there wouldn\u2019t have really been time to change my doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d\n\u2022\nHami has got his license and has driven his new secondhand car to his first semester at Purchase.\n\u2022\nFarah and Bridget still mean to figure out some way to go up and see Lotte, maybe in the spring, when the weather is nicer. \u2666",

On the velvet sofa in Lotte\u2019s living room, from which she could observe the Hudson River traffic as far as the George Washington Bridge, the caregiver sat watching television.\n\u201cGet rid of her,\u201d Lotte said.\nSamson dropped his voice, as if this might make his mother lower hers. \u201cAs soon as we find you a replacement.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll get rid of her,\u201d Lotte said.\nSam said, \u201cWe\u2019ll go on interviewing till we find you the right one.\u201d\n\u201cWho will let me eat my bread and butter?\u201d\n\u201cMom,\u201d Sam said, \u201cbread turns into sugar, as you know very well.\u201d\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t care,\u201d Lotte said.\n\u201cIf she lets you eat bread for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, she\u2019ll get fired.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Lotte.\n\u2022\n\u201cSarah,\u201d Sam said to the caregiver, \u201cI\u2019ll take my mother to her ladies\u2019 lunch if you\u2019ll pick her up at three-thirty?\u201d\n\u201cThat O.K. with you?\u201d Sarah asked Lotte.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Lotte.\n\u2022\n\u201cLadies\u2019 lunch\u201d is pronounced in quotation marks.

Something happens and I think, I\u2019ll tell the next ladies\u2019 lunch.\u201d\n\u201cTrue!

You discussed this move with Lotte?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she has agreed?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes, she has. In a way,\u201d Sam said. \u201cShe said next year, maybe. Listen. Mom cannot deal with the round-the-clock caregivers. And believe me that she does not, does not, want to move in with Diana and me.\u201d\n\u2022\nBridget phoned Sam. \u201cSo, what\u2019s this place you want to move Lotte into?\u201d\n\u201cCalled Three Trees. It\u2019s in the Hudson Valley,\u201d Sam told her. \u201cMy brother will help me move Mom in, and move the stuff she\u2019s fond of\u2014the famous velvet sofa.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she will have an apartment of her own?\u201d\n\u201cA bedsitter, neat and convenient, with her own bathroom and a breakfast nook.\u201d\n\u201cHer own nook,\u201d Bridget said. \u201cWhat\u2019s outside the window?\u201d\n\u201cThe Hudson River view, unfortunately, is on the other side of the building. Trees. There\u2019s a little parking lot and lots of green. Listen. We know Mom would prefer Manhattan\u2014which would have been a hell of a lot more convenient for Diana and me to visit her\u2014but who can afford something nice in the city?\u201d\nBridget said, \u201cIt\u2019s that none of us drives these days. How are we going to visit?\u201d\n\u201cOne of the advantages is that there will always be people around.\u201d\n\u201cDoes Lotte think this is an advantage?\u201d\nSam said, \u201cI have never been in a situation where there hasn\u2019t been somebody to talk with.\u201d\n\u201cI have,\u201d said Bridget.\n\u201cAnd I would know she\u2019s getting three proper meals.\u201d\nGod. Poor Lotte, thought Bridget. And poor Sam. \u201cYou\u2019re not a happy camper,\u201d she said to him, wondering what the phrase came from.\n\u2022\nRuth, an old activist, had an idea. She said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Sam.\u201d\n\u201cHave you closed on the Hudson Valley place?\u201d she asked him.\n\u201cGreg and I are going up on Thursday.\u201d\nRuth said, \u201cWill you give us a couple of days to figure something out?\u201d\n\u201cBelieve me, there is nothing to . . . Yes, sure. O.K. But I need to get Mom and her stuff moved before Greg leaves for Chicago.\u201d\nRuth said, \u201cCould Lotte live alone if\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\u201cSam, wait. Could Lotte live alone if the four of us\u2014the three of us if Bessie can\u2019t come in\u2014take turns checking on Lotte, to see what she needs and if anything is wrong?\u201d\n\u201cMom would put sugar on her bread and butter.\u201d\n\u201cSounds delicious,\u201d Ruth said.\n\u201cShe would never change her clothes.\u201d\n\u201cProbably not.\u201d\n\u201cShe would have one shower a week. She would not shower.\u201d\n\u201cSam! So what!\u201d\n\u201cNot on my watch,\u201d Sam said. \u201cThings need to be done right.\u201d\n\u201cNo, they don\u2019t. Why do they need to be right?\u201d\n\u201cWhen Mom messed up her medicines, Greg and I had to rush her to Emergency. She might have died.\u201d\n\u201cYes. She might. Your mother might have died in her own bed, in sight of the Empire State Building and the George Washington Bridge. No, but Sam, we will go up and check on her. Let\u2019s try it\u2014a couple of days.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if she falls down again?\u201d\n\u201cShe falls down. Sam, I\u2019ll sleep over there tonight.\u201d\nRuth slept over at Lotte\u2019s, and Lotte fell going from her bed to the bathroom. Ruth called Sam, and Sam and Gregor came and took Lotte to Emergency.\n\u2022\nSamson and Gregor moved their mother, the sofa, and whatever else out of Lotte\u2019s ample apartment could be made to fit, into the bedsitter in the Hudson Valley. Greg flew back to Chicago.\n\u2022\nWhen the ladies\u2019 lunch met in Farah\u2019s apartment, the agenda was Lotte\u2019s rescue. Farah had a plan.\nThey brought each other up to date.\nLotte had phoned Ruth from Three Trees. Ruth said, \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize her voice. I mean, I knew that it was Lotte, but her voice sounded different, strangled, a new, strange voice.\u201d\n\u201cLotte is furious,\u201d Bessie said.\n\u201cYes, I know that voice,\u201d Bridget said. \u201cLotte called me. She remembered my sitting with her and Shareen. She wanted me to get Shareen\u2019s phone number. Shareen drives a car. Lotte wants Shareen to come and pick her up at Three Trees and drive her home to the apartment. Which is not going to happen.\u201d\n\u201cNow when I go abroad I tell everyone Im a Canadian goose.\u201d\n\u201cNow when I go abroad I tell everyone I\u2019m a Canadian goose.\u201d\nCopy link to cartoon\nLink copied\nShop\n\u201cLotte called me,\u201d reported Farah. \u201cShe wants us\u2014her and me\u2014to rent a car together. I told her I haven\u2019t renewed my license. I doubt if I could pass the eye test. Not a problem, Lotte said. She would drive.\u201d\n\u201cDoes she even have a license?\u201d\n\u201cLotte hasn\u2019t driven in ten years.\u201d\nBessie said, \u201cSam called me and he was fit to be tied. Wanted to know if I had something to do with Lotte buying a car. Buying a car! Me? I have never actually bought a car in my life. Lotte believes that she has bought a car and keeps calling this dealer to send her the keys.\u201d\nBessie had called Lotte and asked her, \u201cWhat\u2019s this about a car?\u201d Lotte said, \u201cIt\u2019s down there in the parking lot.\u201d \u201cWhat kind of a car is this?\u201d Bessie had asked her, and Lotte said, \u201cI\u2019m waiting till they send me the virtual key.\u201d\n\u2022\nFarah\u2019s plan: Farah had an eighteen-year-old grandson, Hami. He would have his license as soon as he passed his test. \u201cHe\u2019ll drive us to Three Trees, and we will bring Lotte back.\u201d\n\u201cBetter be soon,\u201d Bessie said. \u201cSam is putting Lotte\u2019s apartment on the market.\u201d\n\u201cThe test is this Monday.\u201d\nBut Hami failed his test.\n\u2022\nBridget phoned Lotte at Three Trees. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d\n\u201cNot good.\u201d\n\u201cHow is the food?\u201d\n\u201cSalt free.\u201d\n\u201cJudging from your voice, you\u2019re getting a little bit used to being there?\u201d\n\u201cCan you come and get me and take me back to my apartment?\u201d\n\u201cLotte, we just really wouldn\u2019t know how. For the moment, might it be a good idea to accommodate yourself?\u201d\n\u201cYes. But I need to go home,\u201d Lotte said.\n\u201cHave you found anyone to talk to?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Alana. She sits next to me in the dining room. Alana has three children and five grandchildren, the oldest nineteen, the twins age thirteen, and a nine- and a five-year-old. Would you like me to tell you what their names are?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\u201cWould you like me to tell you where each of them goes to school?\u201d\n\u201cLotte . . . \u201d\n\u201cMinnie Mansfield has a grandson. His name is Joel, and Joel has a friend whose name is Sam, like my Sam. Shall I tell you which colleges Sam and which colleges Joel are considering going to?\u201d\n\u201cLotte . . . \u201d\n\u201cMinnie\u2019s sister\u2019s granddaughter,\u201d said Lotte, \u201cis thinking of taking a gap year before she goes to Williams.\u201d\n\u201cLotte . . . \u201d\nLotte said, \u201cI have not told Alana or Minnie that I\u2019ve died. I thought awhile before telling Sam, but he was fine. He was really very good about it, my poor Sam.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean that you feel as if . . . \u201d Bridget hesitated between saying \u201cas if you have died\u201d and \u201cas if you are dead.\u201d\nLotte said, \u201cNo. I am dead. If I saw Dr. Goodman\u2014or any doctor\u2014he would look down my throat and see the four yellow spots dead people have. When you write the story, the question is whether, now that I am dead, I can die again, a second time, or is this what it is from here on.\u201d\n\u201cLotte, you want me to write your story?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already written how I got rid of Sarah and Shareen, and the roach in Shareen\u2019s five-year-old\u2019s mouth, and about Sam and Greg putting me here in the boonies.\u201d\n\u201cLotte,\u201d Bridget said, \u201cwe\u2019re mobilizing ourselves. We\u2019re trying to figure out how to come and visit you.\u201d\n\u201cGood! Oh, oh, good, good!\u201d Lotte said. She wanted them to give her enough lead time so she could arrange a ladies\u2019 lunch in the Three Trees dining room. \u201cThen I\u2019ll tell you how I lay down on my sofa\u2014this was last Friday\u2014just to take a nap, and when I woke up I knew that I was going to die, and I died.\u201d\n\u2022\nSam has taken time off twice this month to go and visit his mother. He feels that she is settling in. \u201cWhen she says that she has died she means died to the old New York life in order to pass into the new life at Three Trees.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you think she means?\u201d Bessie asks him.\n\u201cWhat else could she mean?\u201d\nBessie is silent a moment. She says, \u201cLotte has stopped calling me.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sam says. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t call me, and she doesn\u2019t return Diana\u2019s calls.\u201d\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t pick up her phone.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sam says.\n\u2022\nBessie is pretty much stuck in Old Rockingham. Colin seems to be on the decline. Poor Bridget didn\u2019t make it to the last ladies\u2019 lunch, because she had one of her frequent debilitating headaches, but she wants to come along if Ruth and Farah figure out how to go and visit Lotte.\nThe idea to hitch a ride with Sam when he drives up to Three Trees gets screwed up because Lotte does not return Farah\u2019s call. \u201cAnd then I guess I forgot to call her,\u201d Ruth says. \u201cIn any case, there wouldn\u2019t have really been time to change my doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d\n\u2022\nHami has got his license and has driven his new secondhand car to his first semester at Purchase.\n\u2022\nFarah and Bridget still mean to figure out some way to go up and see Lotte, maybe in the spring, when the weather is nicer. \u2666",

        "story": "It mattered that Lotte\u2019s apartment was commodious. Lotte liked to boast that when she lay in bed and looked past the two closest water towers, past the architectural follies and oddities few people notice on Manhattan\u2019s rooftops, she saw all the way to the Empire State Building. On the velvet sofa in Lotte\u2019s living room, from which she could observe the Hudson River traffic as far as the George Washington Bridge, the caregiver sat watching television.\n\u201cGet rid of her,\u201d Lotte said.\nSamson dropped his voice, as if this might make his mother lower hers. \u201cAs soon as we find you a replacement.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll get rid of her,\u201d Lotte said.\nSam said, \u201cWe\u2019ll go on interviewing till we find you the right one.\u201d\n\u201cWho will let me eat my bread and butter?\u201d\n\u201cMom,\u201d Sam said, \u201cbread turns into sugar, as you know very well.\u201d\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t care,\u201d Lotte said.\n\u201cIf she lets you eat bread for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, she\u2019ll get fired.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Lotte.\n\u2022\n\u201cSarah,\u201d Sam said to the caregiver, \u201cI\u2019ll take my mother to her ladies\u2019 lunch if you\u2019ll pick her up at three-thirty?\u201d\n\u201cThat O.K. with you?\u201d Sarah asked Lotte.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Lotte.\n\u2022\n\u201cLadies\u2019 lunch\u201d is pronounced in quotation marks. The five women have grown old coming together, every other month or so for the last thirty or more years, around one another\u2019s table. Ruth, Bridget, Farah, Lotte, and Bessie are longtime New Yorkers; their origins in California, County Mayo, Tehran, Vienna, and the Bronx might have grounded them but do not in these days often surface.\nRuth was a retired lawyer. She said, \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten, of course, who it was said that there are four or five people in the world to whom we tell things, and that\u2019s us. Something happens and I think, I\u2019ll tell the next ladies\u2019 lunch.\u201d\n\u201cTrue! It\u2019s true,\u201d Lotte said. \u201cWhen I suddenly sat on my rear on the sidewalk outside my front door, I was looking forward to telling you.\u201d\nLotte had turned out to need a hip replacement. Dr. Goodman, the surgeon, was a furry man like a character in an Ed Koren cartoon, only jollier. He had promised Lotte, \u201cFrom here on it\u2019s all good.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m eighty-two years old,\u201d Lotte had said.\nGoodman told her, \u201cI\u2019m on my way to the ninety-second birthday of a patient whose knees I replaced eleven years ago.\u201d\nBessie said, \u201cAnd I told you, from my poor Colin\u2019s experience, that the recovery is not so much like Goodman\u2019s cheery projection.\u201d These days, it depended on the state of Colin\u2019s health and Colin\u2019s mood whether Bessie was able to take the train in from Old Rockingham.\n\u2022\nToday\u2019s lunch was at Bridget\u2019s, so she got to set the agenda: \u201c \u2018How to Prevent the Inevitable.\u2019 I mean any of the scenarios we would rather die than live in.\u201d Bridget was a writer who still spent mornings at her computer.\nRunning the New York City Marathon at Age Eighty-Six\nFarah, a recently retired doctor, said, \u201cThe old problem of shuffling off this mortal coil.\u201d\n\u201cOf shuffling off,\u201d Lotte said.\n\u201cAnd it was you who said you wanted to see it all, to see what would happen to the end,\u201d Farah reminded Lotte.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t counting on the twenty-four-hour caregiver or the heart-healthy diet,\u201d said Lotte. \u201cYou doctors need to do a study of the correlation between salt-free food and depression.\u201d\n\u201cYour Sarah seems pleasant enough,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d\n\u201cThat she\u2019s in my living room,\u201d Lotte said, \u201cwatching television; that she\u2019s in my kitchen eating her lunch, which she does standing up; that she\u2019s in my spare room asleep, and in my bathroom whenever I want to go in.\u201d\nRuth asked Lotte what Sarah did for her. \u201cDo you need a caregiver to help you dress?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lotte said.\n\u201cYou need a caregiver to help you shower?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lotte said.\n\u201cGet your meals?\u201d\n\u201cGod, _no! _\u201d\n\u201cSo what do you need help with?\u201d\n\u201cThe caregiver,\u201d Lotte said.\n\u201cGo away,\u201d she said to Sarah, who had come to take her home. The four friends\u2019 mouths dropped to see their friend raise her arm at the caregiver and slap the air.\n\u2022\nThey were of an age when they worried if one of them did not answer her telephone.\nBessie, Lotte\u2019s oldest friend, had known Sam since he was a baby. She called him from Connecticut. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the caregiver pick up Lotte\u2019s phone?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s gone. There was just too much abuse.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me! What? That nice Sarah? You\u2019re talking elder abuse?\u201d\n\u201cMore like caregiver abuse,\u201d Sam said.\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\u201cLike Mom would change the channel Sarah was watching on the TV. She\u2019d come into the kitchen and pack away the food Sarah was preparing for her lunch, and turn on the light when Sarah was asleep. It was getting bizarre. I\u2019m here waiting with her for the new woman.\u201d\n\u2022\nBessie e-mailed the friends in New York to look in on Lotte.\nBridget went to see Lotte. Bridget, Lotte, and Shareen, the new caregiver, sat looking out on Riverside Drive. Lotte said, \u201cShareen drives in from New Jersey. Shareen has a five-year-old who brushes his own teeth. Shareen told him that if he doesn\u2019t brush, a roach will grow in his mouth.\u201d\nBessie phoned Lotte. \u201cHow is the new caregiver?\u201d\n\u201cIntrusive,\u201d said Lotte.\nWhen Farah called Lotte, it was Sam who picked up the phone. \u201cShareen is gone. Mom locked her\u2014I can\u2019t make out if it was into or out of the bathroom, but it wasn\u2019t that. Shareen did not want to have to manhandle Mom to stop her eating sugar by the spoonfuls.\u201d\n\u201cLotte is angry,\u201d Farah said. \u201cAfter making your own decisions your life long, it must be hell having someone tell you what you can eat and when to shower and what to wear.\u201d\n\u201cBecause her own decisions are not tenable,\u201d Sam said. \u201cGreg is coming in from Chicago.\u201d Gregor was Lotte\u2019s younger son. \u201cWe\u2019re going to check out this nice assisted-living home. It sounds really nice. Upscale.\u201d\n\u201cSam? You\u2019re moving Lotte out of her apartment?\u201d\n\u201cTo a nice home in the country.\u201d\n\u201cA home in the country. You discussed this move with Lotte?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she has agreed?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes, she has. In a way,\u201d Sam said. \u201cShe said next year, maybe. Listen. Mom cannot deal with the round-the-clock caregivers. And believe me that she does not, does not, want to move in with Diana and me.\u201d\n\u2022\nBridget phoned Sam. \u201cSo, what\u2019s this place you want to move Lotte into?\u201d\n\u201cCalled Three Trees. It\u2019s in the Hudson Valley,\u201d Sam told her. \u201cMy brother will help me move Mom in, and move the stuff she\u2019s fond of\u2014the famous velvet sofa.\u201d\n\u201cAnd she will have an apartment of her own?\u201d\n\u201cA bedsitter, neat and convenient, with her own bathroom and a breakfast nook.\u201d\n\u201cHer own nook,\u201d Bridget said. \u201cWhat\u2019s outside the window?\u201d\n\u201cThe Hudson River view, unfortunately, is on the other side of the building. Trees. There\u2019s a little parking lot and lots of green. Listen. We know Mom would prefer Manhattan\u2014which would have been a hell of a lot more convenient for Diana and me to visit her\u2014but who can afford something nice in the city?\u201d\nBridget said, \u201cIt\u2019s that none of us drives these days. How are we going to visit?\u201d\n\u201cOne of the advantages is that there will always be people around.\u201d\n\u201cDoes Lotte think this is an advantage?\u201d\nSam said, \u201cI have never been in a situation where there hasn\u2019t been somebody to talk with.\u201d\n\u201cI have,\u201d said Bridget.\n\u201cAnd I would know she\u2019s getting three proper meals.\u201d\nGod. Poor Lotte, thought Bridget. And poor Sam. \u201cYou\u2019re not a happy camper,\u201d she said to him, wondering what the phrase came from.\n\u2022\nRuth, an old activist, had an idea. She said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Sam.\u201d\n\u201cHave you closed on the Hudson Valley place?\u201d she asked him.\n\u201cGreg and I are going up on Thursday.\u201d\nRuth said, \u201cWill you give us a couple of days to figure something out?\u201d\n\u201cBelieve me, there is nothing to . . . Yes, sure. O.K. But I need to get Mom and her stuff moved before Greg leaves for Chicago.\u201d\nRuth said, \u201cCould Lotte live alone if\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\u201cSam, wait. Could Lotte live alone if the four of us\u2014the three of us if Bessie can\u2019t come in\u2014take turns checking on Lotte, to see what she needs and if anything is wrong?\u201d\n\u201cMom would put sugar on her bread and butter.\u201d\n\u201cSounds delicious,\u201d Ruth said.\n\u201cShe would never change her clothes.\u201d\n\u201cProbably not.\u201d\n\u201cShe would have one shower a week. She would not shower.\u201d\n\u201cSam! So what!\u201d\n\u201cNot on my watch,\u201d Sam said. \u201cThings need to be done right.\u201d\n\u201cNo, they don\u2019t. Why do they need to be right?\u201d\n\u201cWhen Mom messed up her medicines, Greg and I had to rush her to Emergency. She might have died.\u201d\n\u201cYes. She might. Your mother might have died in her own bed, in sight of the Empire State Building and the George Washington Bridge. No, but Sam, we will go up and check on her. Let\u2019s try it\u2014a couple of days.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if she falls down again?\u201d\n\u201cShe falls down. Sam, I\u2019ll sleep over there tonight.\u201d\nRuth slept over at Lotte\u2019s, and Lotte fell going from her bed to the bathroom. Ruth called Sam, and Sam and Gregor came and took Lotte to Emergency.\n\u2022\nSamson and Gregor moved their mother, the sofa, and whatever else out of Lotte\u2019s ample apartment could be made to fit, into the bedsitter in the Hudson Valley. Greg flew back to Chicago.\n\u2022\nWhen the ladies\u2019 lunch met in Farah\u2019s apartment, the agenda was Lotte\u2019s rescue. Farah had a plan.\nThey brought each other up to date.\nLotte had phoned Ruth from Three Trees. Ruth said, \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize her voice. I mean, I knew that it was Lotte, but her voice sounded different, strangled, a new, strange voice.\u201d\n\u201cLotte is furious,\u201d Bessie said.\n\u201cYes, I know that voice,\u201d Bridget said. \u201cLotte called me. She remembered my sitting with her and Shareen. She wanted me to get Shareen\u2019s phone number. Shareen drives a car. Lotte wants Shareen to come and pick her up at Three Trees and drive her home to the apartment. Which is not going to happen.\u201d\n\u201cNow when I go abroad I tell everyone Im a Canadian goose.\u201d\n\u201cNow when I go abroad I tell everyone I\u2019m a Canadian goose.\u201d\nCopy link to cartoon\nLink copied\nShop\n\u201cLotte called me,\u201d reported Farah. \u201cShe wants us\u2014her and me\u2014to rent a car together. I told her I haven\u2019t renewed my license. I doubt if I could pass the eye test. Not a problem, Lotte said. She would drive.\u201d\n\u201cDoes she even have a license?\u201d\n\u201cLotte hasn\u2019t driven in ten years.\u201d\nBessie said, \u201cSam called me and he was fit to be tied. Wanted to know if I had something to do with Lotte buying a car. Buying a car! Me? I have never actually bought a car in my life. Lotte believes that she has bought a car and keeps calling this dealer to send her the keys.\u201d\nBessie had called Lotte and asked her, \u201cWhat\u2019s this about a car?\u201d Lotte said, \u201cIt\u2019s down there in the parking lot.\u201d \u201cWhat kind of a car is this?\u201d Bessie had asked her, and Lotte said, \u201cI\u2019m waiting till they send me the virtual key.\u201d\n\u2022\nFarah\u2019s plan: Farah had an eighteen-year-old grandson, Hami. He would have his license as soon as he passed his test. \u201cHe\u2019ll drive us to Three Trees, and we will bring Lotte back.\u201d\n\u201cBetter be soon,\u201d Bessie said. \u201cSam is putting Lotte\u2019s apartment on the market.\u201d\n\u201cThe test is this Monday.\u201d\nBut Hami failed his test.\n\u2022\nBridget phoned Lotte at Three Trees. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d\n\u201cNot good.\u201d\n\u201cHow is the food?\u201d\n\u201cSalt free.\u201d\n\u201cJudging from your voice, you\u2019re getting a little bit used to being there?\u201d\n\u201cCan you come and get me and take me back to my apartment?\u201d\n\u201cLotte, we just really wouldn\u2019t know how. For the moment, might it be a good idea to accommodate yourself?\u201d\n\u201cYes. But I need to go home,\u201d Lotte said.\n\u201cHave you found anyone to talk to?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Alana. She sits next to me in the dining room. Alana has three children and five grandchildren, the oldest nineteen, the twins age thirteen, and a nine- and a five-year-old. Would you like me to tell you what their names are?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\u201cWould you like me to tell you where each of them goes to school?\u201d\n\u201cLotte . . . \u201d\n\u201cMinnie Mansfield has a grandson. His name is Joel, and Joel has a friend whose name is Sam, like my Sam. Shall I tell you which colleges Sam and which colleges Joel are considering going to?\u201d\n\u201cLotte . . . \u201d\n\u201cMinnie\u2019s sister\u2019s granddaughter,\u201d said Lotte, \u201cis thinking of taking a gap year before she goes to Williams.\u201d\n\u201cLotte . . . \u201d\nLotte said, \u201cI have not told Alana or Minnie that I\u2019ve died. I thought awhile before telling Sam, but he was fine. He was really very good about it, my poor Sam.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean that you feel as if . . . \u201d Bridget hesitated between saying \u201cas if you have died\u201d and \u201cas if you are dead.\u201d\nLotte said, \u201cNo. I am dead. If I saw Dr. Goodman\u2014or any doctor\u2014he would look down my throat and see the four yellow spots dead people have. When you write the story, the question is whether, now that I am dead, I can die again, a second time, or is this what it is from here on.\u201d\n\u201cLotte, you want me to write your story?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already written how I got rid of Sarah and Shareen, and the roach in Shareen\u2019s five-year-old\u2019s mouth, and about Sam and Greg putting me here in the boonies.\u201d\n\u201cLotte,\u201d Bridget said, \u201cwe\u2019re mobilizing ourselves. We\u2019re trying to figure out how to come and visit you.\u201d\n\u201cGood! Oh, oh, good, good!\u201d Lotte said. She wanted them to give her enough lead time so she could arrange a ladies\u2019 lunch in the Three Trees dining room. \u201cThen I\u2019ll tell you how I lay down on my sofa\u2014this was last Friday\u2014just to take a nap, and when I woke up I knew that I was going to die, and I died.\u201d\n\u2022\nSam has taken time off twice this month to go and visit his mother. He feels that she is settling in. \u201cWhen she says that she has died she means died to the old New York life in order to pass into the new life at Three Trees.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you think she means?\u201d Bessie asks him.\n\u201cWhat else could she mean?\u201d\nBessie is silent a moment. She says, \u201cLotte has stopped calling me.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sam says. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t call me, and she doesn\u2019t return Diana\u2019s calls.\u201d\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t pick up her phone.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sam says.\n\u2022\nBessie is pretty much stuck in Old Rockingham. Colin seems to be on the decline. Poor Bridget didn\u2019t make it to the last ladies\u2019 lunch, because she had one of her frequent debilitating headaches, but she wants to come along if Ruth and Farah figure out how to go and visit Lotte.\nThe idea to hitch a ride with Sam when he drives up to Three Trees gets screwed up because Lotte does not return Farah\u2019s call. \u201cAnd then I guess I forgot to call her,\u201d Ruth says. \u201cIn any case, there wouldn\u2019t have really been time to change my doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d\n\u2022\nHami has got his license and has driven his new secondhand car to his first semester at Purchase.\n\u2022\nFarah and Bridget still mean to figure out some way to go up and see Lotte, maybe in the spring, when the weather is nicer. \u2666",

A mind of evil.\nA great intelligence.\n\u201cYou going to stay and stare, or are you going to release me from the molecular bondage?\u201d The Doctor asked.\nRogue stood there slack jawed, for a spell, then gathered himself and did as he was requested.\n\u201cSorry, your story checks out...all your stories, it\u2019s funny, and you...suddenly act like it\u2019s all so new to you\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s still all new to me love and I don\u2019t want to contemplate what could be in store next for me if one of those faces on the scan proves true...\u201d\n\u201cWhy? What\u2019s the significance of it?\u201d Rogue asked.\n\u201cThere is an intelligence on this planet that is trying to kill me across all of time and space, I couldn\u2019t stop it, but a friend of mine did, her name was Clara Oswald, and there is a good possibility an echo of her exists here, in this century, on these very grounds, on the patch of green we walked across on route to your ship, she is out there, fighting for every breath you make and every step you, and I, take\u201d\n\u201cAnd seeing one of your faces convinces you of all that?\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious Rogue? I wear that face, it isn\u2019t just appearing there to mark what will become of me, it is what I become. I become that intelligence, a being of sheer indomitable will, the ability to control and kill whenever and however I please. My people, lords one and all, spoke once of ascending beyond all demand for physical presence in the universe, they wished to bring about the end of linear time and become free of cause and effect. What if I achieve it? My god Rogue...what if that is my calling? It was said I would have many names before the end...beast, storm, Valeyard...and now...Intelligence\u201d\nRogue walked up to The Doctor and gently placed his hand on his.\n\u201cYou have an illness; your friend sounds like a good reliever of it\u201d\n\u201cSome illnesses you can\u2019t cure\u201d The Doctor admitted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to tow the line between present and future without a little bit of knowledge, but if you know yourself, then you know how to shape that future into something better to come\"\n\u201c\u201cI\u2019m a devil in scarlet and black, what would I know?\u201d The Doctor asked.\nRogue smiled and played another bopping track across the com speakers.\n\u2018\u2019Say you won't leave me no more\nI'll take you back again\nNo more excuses, no, no\n'Cause I've heard them all before\nA hundred times or more\nI'll forgive and forget\nIf you say you'll never go\n'Cause it's true what they say\nIt's better the devil you know (better the devil)\n(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)\u2019\u2019\nAnd just like that, The Doctor\u2019s spirits suddenly rose.",

The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.* &nbsp; -Found among the papers of the late Francis Wayland Thurston, of Boston --- ***Harry, Jeremy, Ruth, Walter-*** The telegram had been terse, but it carried two important pieces of information: Firstly, that Jackson had information--*new* information--about the Carlyle Expedition. The lure of such a claim was obvious; the Expedition had been news simply for happening, and its importance only grew as the tale unfolded. Even years later, if someone could uncover what had happened...fame, credit, and certainly fortune followed. Jackson could hardly be blamed for wanting to pursue it. Hed certainly pursued more cryptic leads for lesser promise of reward--though it was curious. Jackson was *notoriously* secretive about his previous projects while they were underway. What could drive him to break his silence now? The second piece of information was that hed said he needed an investigative *team.* And yet, there had been no instructions to gather associates or reach out to a contact. The conclusion was simple: Jackson had already reached out to others. An expedition of his own, perhaps. There was some time between receipt of Jacksons telegram and the date of the meeting. Plenty of opportunity for a bit of preparation--ensuring affairs were in order for travel, preparing probable gear, but most importantly, brushing up on the Carlyle Expedition itself. Not a difficult task. Any worthwhile periodical--and many of the more salacious rags--ran stories on the Expedition while it had occurred. It simply took a bit of perusal and perhaps a phone call or three to the right people to turn up archival copies. BIG APPLE DATELINE April 4, 1919--ROGER CARLYLE, the playboy whom everybody knows--or knows about--is quietly leaving New Yawk tomorrow to check out the tombs of Egypt! Youve seen the cuties ROGER has found in the nightspots. Who can doubt hell dig up someone--er, something--equally fabulous from the Egyptian sands? --- CARLYLE EXPEDITION EMBARKS FOR ENGLAND April 5, 1919--Led by the fabulously wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle, the Carlyle Expedition departed this morning for Southampton aboard the crack British steamship Imperial Standard. Contrary to earlier reports, the expedition will perform researches in London under the auspices of the Penhew Foundation before continuing to Egypt next month. Readers may recall the enormous party which Mr. Carlyle, now 24, gave at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel upon reaching his majority. Since then, scandals and indelicate behavior have become Carlyles trademark, but he never has become tarnished in the eyes of Manhattanites. Members of the expedition have been reluctant to reveal their purpose in Egypt. OTHER EXPEDITION MEMBERS--Renowned Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew is assistant leader of the team, and in charge of excavations. Dr. Robert Huston, a fashionable Freudian psychologist, accompanies the expedition to pursue parallel researches into ancient pictographs. Miss Hypatia Masters, linked in the past to Carlyle, will act as photographer and archivist. Mr. Jack Brady, intimate to Mr. Carlyle, accompanies the group as general factotum. Additional members may be secured while in London. --- CARLYLE DEPARTS EGYPT July 3, 1919--CAIRO (AP)--Sir Aubrey Penhew, temporary spokesman for the Carlyle Expedition, indicated Monday that the leaders are taking ship to East Africa for a well-earned rest. Sir Aubrey debunked rumors that the expedition had discovered clues to the legendary wealth of the lost mines of King Solomon, maintaining that the party was going on safari in respite from our sandy labors. Roger Carlyle, wealthy New York leader of the expedition, was unavailable for comment, still suffering from his recent sunstroke. Discussing that unfortunate incident, local experts declared Egypt entirely too hot for Anglo-Saxons at this time of year, and suggested that the young American had not been well-served by his democratic enthusiasm, rumored to have led him to personally wield pick and shovel. --- IMPORTANT VISITORS July 24, 1919--MOMBASA (Reuters)--Leading members of an American archaeological expedition arrived here on holiday from digs in Egypts Nile Valley. Our Under-Secretary, Mr. Royston Whittingdon, held a welcoming dinner for them at Collingswood House, where the wit of Sir Aubrey Penhew, expedition co-leader, was much in evidence. Accompanying Sir Aubrey are two Americans, youthful financier Roger Carlyle and medical doctor Robert Huston. The party leaves inland tomorrow, for Nairobi and hunting. --- CARLYLE EXPEDITION FEARED LOST Oct. 15, 1919--MOMBASA (Reuters)--Uplands police representatives today asked for public assistance concerning the disappearance of the Carlyle Expedition. No word of the party has been received in nearly two months. The group includes wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle and three other American citizens, as well as respected Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew of the United Kingdom. The expedition left Nairobi on August 3, ostensibly on camera safari, but rumor insisted that they actually were after legendary Biblical treasures. Carlyle and his party reportedly intended to explore portions of the Great Rift Valley, to the northwest of Nairobi. --- ERICA CARLYLE ARRIVES IN AFRICA March 11, 1920--MOMBASA (Reuters)--In response to clues, Miss Erica Carlyle, sister to the American leader of the lost Carlyle Expedition, arrived in port today aboard the Egyptian vessel Fount of Life. Several Kikuyu-villager reports recently have been received concerning the putative massacre of unnamed whites near Aberdare Forest. Miss Carlyle declared her intention to find her brother, regardless of the effort needed. She brought with her the nucleus of a large expedition. Detailing agents to coordinate supply and other activities with Colony representatives, Miss Carlyle and the remainder of her party depart for Nairobi tomorrow. Her companion, Mrs. Victoria Post, indirectly emphasized Miss Carlyles purposefulness by recounting the rigors of the voyage aboard the Semite ship. --- CARLYLE MASSACRE CONFIRMED May 24, 1920--NAIROBI (Reuters)--The massacre of the long-missing Carlyle expedition was confirmed today by district police representatives. Roger Carlyle, New Yorks rollicking playboy, is counted among the missing. Authorities blame hostile Nandi tribesmen for the shocking murders. Remains of at least two dozen expedition members and bearers are thought found in several concealed grave sites. Erica Carlyle, Roger Carlyles sister and apparent heiress to the Carlyle family fortune, led the dangerous search for her brother and his party. She credited Kikuyu tribesmen for the discovery, though police actually found the site. Among other expedition members believed lost are Sir Aubrey Penhew, noted Egyptologist; New York socialite Hypatia Masters, and Dr. Robert Huston. Many bearers also are reported dead. --- MURDERERS HANGED June 19. 1920--NAIROBI (Reuters)--Five Nandi tribesmen, convicted ringleaders of the vicious Carlyle Expedition massacre, were executed this morning after a short, expertly-conducted trial. To the end, the tribesmen steadfastly refused to reveal where they had hidden the bodies of the white leaders of the expedition. Mr. Harvis, acting for the Colony, cleverly implied throughout the trial that the massacre was racial in motivation, and that the fair-skinned victims were taken to a secret location, there to suffer the most savage treatment. Miss Erica Carlyle, defeated in her efforts to rescue her brother, left several weeks ago, but is surely comforted now by the triumph of justice. --- And so, armed with this bit of foreknowledge and any other preparations, the only thing left to do was to wait. Sure enough, on January 15th, Jackson phoned each member of his would-be investigative team: 8 p.m. at the Chelsea Hotel, Room 410. But the conversation was curt and uninformative; not even *cordial.* Jackson was brusque and nervous, very unlike himself; something was amiss. The man wouldnt say what, though; he begged off all further discussion until the meeting, when he could tell it all once, for all to hear. --- ***Shane-*** Shane received the letter late last year, long before the telegram reached him. It was simple, but eloquent, in Jacksons precise hand--the same Shane had seen in his fathers correspondences, perhaps as often as hed seen the man himself. Much like Jackson, Shanes father had always been gallivanting across the globe on some adventure or another, hunting down anything that had the slightest whiff of the occult. Hed come back all too briefly, speaking endlessly of the wonder he uncovered, and then, scarcely before hed finished the telling of his latest escapade hed be off again, for months at a time, pursuing the next. And so it went: out abroad, giving only letters of his progress; then back home for a fleeting time. Then out, and back, and out, and on, and on Until he *didnt* come back. It had been years now since Shane had heard from his father. He was presumed dead, of course; theyd even held a farce of a funeral with an empty casket, his mother a bawling wreck the whole time. Elias hadnt even appeared for the funeral; hed been too busy researching his next book. He sent his condolences, of course--as did all the other wayward vagabonds who formed his fathers boys club of neer-do-well adventurers. And that had been the last theyd heard from Jackson or any of the others. Until now. The request was simple; straightforward. Jackson wanted his fathers Australia notes, the letter said. He offered to pay for them, and share credit in any discovery that might result. Generous terms, really--not that Shane or his mother needed the money. His father mightve been negligent, but he never failed to provide in funds. Still, credit. That might be worth something. Better still, if it was related to work his father had been doing, perhaps Jackson could provide some clue as to what *happened* to him. Perhaps hed learned something. His father had been heading to Australia--or so he claimed. The notes were painstakingly crafted copies, backups in case something were lost in the field. His father hadnt expected to lose himself, but perhaps...perhaps he could be found. Whatever his condition. Dead. Surely, dead. He couldnt be alive after all this time...could he? Damn it all. When Jackson called on the 15th, Shane found himself agreeing to be there. It was just as well that the author hung up quickly. --- ***Andrew-*** Andrew knew by now that listening to the voices this time may have been a mistake. Theyd told him things before, impossible things--sometimes useful things. But boarding the freighter Hed barely even penned a note for Elizabeth before he slipped away. Surely hed be back, though. She would have to understand when he explained it to her properly. If he could explain it. The voices told him about the man hed followed, too. Jackson Elias. An author, and though Andrew had never read his books, their names were whispered hauntingly in his head anyway: *Skulls Along the River. Masters of the Black Arts. The Way of Terror. The Smoking Heart. Sons of Death. Witch Cults of England. The Black Power.* Charming titles, really. Whatever he tried, though, Andrew couldnt catch the man alone to speak with him. Andrew had managed to pay enough and offer a hand to help in order to board, but Elias had secured passage some other way. Friend of the captain, perhaps. This the voices said nothing about. But it was clear that Elias wanted to keep to himself and speak with as few people as possible. When they landed, Andrew lost him again. Andrew wandered, for a time; there was trouble, briefly. But a reasonably respectable British man abroad in America had little to fear, and soon the voices gave him what he needed: Chelsea. Not a name, but a place. *Eight arrive at eight. Be there. Meet them,* the womans voice implored. *Watch them,* the mans voice countered. The whispers trailed off. --- ***Elizabeth-*** It had felt wrong to hire that private investigator, but just now, Elizabeth was proving herself wise for having done so. *New York!* Just what was Andrew thinking? At least it was on a slow-moving freighter. Shed have ample time to settle affairs *properly* before pursuing him across the Atlantic. Elizabeth didnt much fancy the cost of a passenger ticket, but there werent many other options available. Well. She could let him go, she supposed. *If she were mad.* Her investigator had a colleague in New York, and Elizabeth enlisted the mans services to watch for Andrews arrival. Unfortunately, upon her arrival, Elizabeth learned of certain setbacks in that regard. Andrew had been difficult to track; unexpectedly so. But eventually the investigator did find him--apparently hed been picked up by the police while wandering Harlem in the middle of the night. Theyd released him soon enough, but it had left enough of an impression that word had reached the investigator. Which meant it had reached Elizabeth. Her latest piece of information was that he was enroute to the Chelsea Hotel for God knows what. It didnt matter. This time, Elizabeth would catch him, face-to-face, and get to the bottom of his aberrant behavior. She paid the investigator and dismissed him, and resolved to handle this meeting on her own. --- ***Goldie-*** Harry thought he could give her the slip. Well, not this time. Goldie couldnt just let the mook skate out on his debts. Word would get around. That would be bad for business. A couple of the boys tailed him to some ritzy joint, the Chelsea. No kind of place for the likes of Harry, that was for sure. No kind of place for the boys, either, as it happened. Too many fancy eyes. *Not* too ritzy for Goldie, though, maybe All right, if Harry was heading into a place like this, he must have some high-rolling pal in there, too. Someone who could pay off old Harrys debts with the right*persuasion.* Thatd be best for everyone. Goldie would get paid, Harry would get to keep his dainty fingers, and this friend--whoever they were--would get to feel like a real swell person. Hell, maybe theyd just plug Harry once she was done. Not her business. But one way or another, Goldie was gonna get paid tonight.",
        "claim": "The author integrates historical elements and fictionalized documents to create a rich, immersive narrative.",
        "evidence": "In the story regarding \"a cryptic meeting at the Chelsea Hotel,\" the author includes detailed fictional newspaper articles about the Carlyle Expedition, such as \"CARLYLE EXPEDITION FEARED LOST\" and \"MURDERERS HANGED,\" which add layers of historical intrigue and authenticity to the plot."

The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.* &nbsp; -Found among the papers of the late Francis Wayland Thurston, of Boston --- ***Harry, Jeremy, Ruth, Walter-*** The telegram had been terse, but it carried two important pieces of information: Firstly, that Jackson had information--*new* information--about the Carlyle Expedition. The lure of such a claim was obvious; the Expedition had been news simply for happening, and its importance only grew as the tale unfolded. Even years later, if someone could uncover what had happened...fame, credit, and certainly fortune followed. Jackson could hardly be blamed for wanting to pursue it. Hed certainly pursued more cryptic leads for lesser promise of reward--though it was curious. Jackson was *notoriously* secretive about his previous projects while they were underway. What could drive him to break his silence now? The second piece of information was that hed said he needed an investigative *team.* And yet, there had been no instructions to gather associates or reach out to a contact. The conclusion was simple: Jackson had already reached out to others. An expedition of his own, perhaps. There was some time between receipt of Jacksons telegram and the date of the meeting. Plenty of opportunity for a bit of preparation--ensuring affairs were in order for travel, preparing probable gear, but most importantly, brushing up on the Carlyle Expedition itself. Not a difficult task. Any worthwhile periodical--and many of the more salacious rags--ran stories on the Expedition while it had occurred. It simply took a bit of perusal and perhaps a phone call or three to the right people to turn up archival copies. BIG APPLE DATELINE April 4, 1919--ROGER CARLYLE, the playboy whom everybody knows--or knows about--is quietly leaving New Yawk tomorrow to check out the tombs of Egypt! Youve seen the cuties ROGER has found in the nightspots. Who can doubt hell dig up someone--er, something--equally fabulous from the Egyptian sands? --- CARLYLE EXPEDITION EMBARKS FOR ENGLAND April 5, 1919--Led by the fabulously wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle, the Carlyle Expedition departed this morning for Southampton aboard the crack British steamship Imperial Standard. Contrary to earlier reports, the expedition will perform researches in London under the auspices of the Penhew Foundation before continuing to Egypt next month. Readers may recall the enormous party which Mr. Carlyle, now 24, gave at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel upon reaching his majority. Since then, scandals and indelicate behavior have become Carlyles trademark, but he never has become tarnished in the eyes of Manhattanites. Members of the expedition have been reluctant to reveal their purpose in Egypt. OTHER EXPEDITION MEMBERS--Renowned Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew is assistant leader of the team, and in charge of excavations. Dr. Robert Huston, a fashionable Freudian psychologist, accompanies the expedition to pursue parallel researches into ancient pictographs. Miss Hypatia Masters, linked in the past to Carlyle, will act as photographer and archivist. Mr. Jack Brady, intimate to Mr. Carlyle, accompanies the group as general factotum. Additional members may be secured while in London. --- CARLYLE DEPARTS EGYPT July 3, 1919--CAIRO (AP)--Sir Aubrey Penhew, temporary spokesman for the Carlyle Expedition, indicated Monday that the leaders are taking ship to East Africa for a well-earned rest. Sir Aubrey debunked rumors that the expedition had discovered clues to the legendary wealth of the lost mines of King Solomon, maintaining that the party was going on safari in respite from our sandy labors. Roger Carlyle, wealthy New York leader of the expedition, was unavailable for comment, still suffering from his recent sunstroke. Discussing that unfortunate incident, local experts declared Egypt entirely too hot for Anglo-Saxons at this time of year, and suggested that the young American had not been well-served by his democratic enthusiasm, rumored to have led him to personally wield pick and shovel. --- IMPORTANT VISITORS July 24, 1919--MOMBASA (Reuters)--Leading members of an American archaeological expedition arrived here on holiday from digs in Egypts Nile Valley. Our Under-Secretary, Mr. Royston Whittingdon, held a welcoming dinner for them at Collingswood House, where the wit of Sir Aubrey Penhew, expedition co-leader, was much in evidence. Accompanying Sir Aubrey are two Americans, youthful financier Roger Carlyle and medical doctor Robert Huston. The party leaves inland tomorrow, for Nairobi and hunting. --- CARLYLE EXPEDITION FEARED LOST Oct. 15, 1919--MOMBASA (Reuters)--Uplands police representatives today asked for public assistance concerning the disappearance of the Carlyle Expedition. No word of the party has been received in nearly two months. The group includes wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle and three other American citizens, as well as respected Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew of the United Kingdom. The expedition left Nairobi on August 3, ostensibly on camera safari, but rumor insisted that they actually were after legendary Biblical treasures. Carlyle and his party reportedly intended to explore portions of the Great Rift Valley, to the northwest of Nairobi. --- ERICA CARLYLE ARRIVES IN AFRICA March 11, 1920--MOMBASA (Reuters)--In response to clues, Miss Erica Carlyle, sister to the American leader of the lost Carlyle Expedition, arrived in port today aboard the Egyptian vessel Fount of Life. Several Kikuyu-villager reports recently have been received concerning the putative massacre of unnamed whites near Aberdare Forest. Miss Carlyle declared her intention to find her brother, regardless of the effort needed. She brought with her the nucleus of a large expedition. Detailing agents to coordinate supply and other activities with Colony representatives, Miss Carlyle and the remainder of her party depart for Nairobi tomorrow. Her companion, Mrs. Victoria Post, indirectly emphasized Miss Carlyles purposefulness by recounting the rigors of the voyage aboard the Semite ship. --- CARLYLE MASSACRE CONFIRMED May 24, 1920--NAIROBI (Reuters)--The massacre of the long-missing Carlyle expedition was confirmed today by district police representatives. Roger Carlyle, New Yorks rollicking playboy, is counted among the missing. Authorities blame hostile Nandi tribesmen for the shocking murders. Remains of at least two dozen expedition members and bearers are thought found in several concealed grave sites. Erica Carlyle, Roger Carlyles sister and apparent heiress to the Carlyle family fortune, led the dangerous search for her brother and his party. She credited Kikuyu tribesmen for the discovery, though police actually found the site. Among other expedition members believed lost are Sir Aubrey Penhew, noted Egyptologist; New York socialite Hypatia Masters, and Dr. Robert Huston. Many bearers also are reported dead. --- MURDERERS HANGED June 19. 1920--NAIROBI (Reuters)--Five Nandi tribesmen, convicted ringleaders of the vicious Carlyle Expedition massacre, were executed this morning after a short, expertly-conducted trial. To the end, the tribesmen steadfastly refused to reveal where they had hidden the bodies of the white leaders of the expedition. Mr. Harvis, acting for the Colony, cleverly implied throughout the trial that the massacre was racial in motivation, and that the fair-skinned victims were taken to a secret location, there to suffer the most savage treatment. Miss Erica Carlyle, defeated in her efforts to rescue her brother, left several weeks ago, but is surely comforted now by the triumph of justice. --- And so, armed with this bit of foreknowledge and any other preparations, the only thing left to do was to wait. Sure enough, on January 15th, Jackson phoned each member of his would-be investigative team: 8 p.m. at the Chelsea Hotel, Room 410. But the conversation was curt and uninformative; not even *cordial.* Jackson was brusque and nervous, very unlike himself; something was amiss. The man wouldnt say what, though; he begged off all further discussion until the meeting, when he could tell it all once, for all to hear. --- ***Shane-*** Shane received the letter late last year, long before the telegram reached him. It was simple, but eloquent, in Jacksons precise hand--the same Shane had seen in his fathers correspondences, perhaps as often as hed seen the man himself. Much like Jackson, Shanes father had always been gallivanting across the globe on some adventure or another, hunting down anything that had the slightest whiff of the occult. Hed come back all too briefly, speaking endlessly of the wonder he uncovered, and then, scarcely before hed finished the telling of his latest escapade hed be off again, for months at a time, pursuing the next. And so it went: out abroad, giving only letters of his progress; then back home for a fleeting time. Then out, and back, and out, and on, and on Until he *didnt* come back. It had been years now since Shane had heard from his father. He was presumed dead, of course; theyd even held a farce of a funeral with an empty casket, his mother a bawling wreck the whole time. Elias hadnt even appeared for the funeral; hed been too busy researching his next book. He sent his condolences, of course--as did all the other wayward vagabonds who formed his fathers boys club of neer-do-well adventurers. And that had been the last theyd heard from Jackson or any of the others. Until now. The request was simple; straightforward. Jackson wanted his fathers Australia notes, the letter said. He offered to pay for them, and share credit in any discovery that might result. Generous terms, really--not that Shane or his mother needed the money. His father mightve been negligent, but he never failed to provide in funds. Still, credit. That might be worth something. Better still, if it was related to work his father had been doing, perhaps Jackson could provide some clue as to what *happened* to him. Perhaps hed learned something. His father had been heading to Australia--or so he claimed. The notes were painstakingly crafted copies, backups in case something were lost in the field. His father hadnt expected to lose himself, but perhaps...perhaps he could be found. Whatever his condition. Dead. Surely, dead. He couldnt be alive after all this time...could he? Damn it all. When Jackson called on the 15th, Shane found himself agreeing to be there. It was just as well that the author hung up quickly. --- ***Andrew-*** Andrew knew by now that listening to the voices this time may have been a mistake. Theyd told him things before, impossible things--sometimes useful things. But boarding the freighter Hed barely even penned a note for Elizabeth before he slipped away. Surely hed be back, though. She would have to understand when he explained it to her properly. If he could explain it. The voices told him about the man hed followed, too. Jackson Elias. An author, and though Andrew had never read his books, their names were whispered hauntingly in his head anyway: *Skulls Along the River. Masters of the Black Arts. The Way of Terror. The Smoking Heart. Sons of Death. Witch Cults of England. The Black Power.* Charming titles, really. Whatever he tried, though, Andrew couldnt catch the man alone to speak with him. Andrew had managed to pay enough and offer a hand to help in order to board, but Elias had secured passage some other way. Friend of the captain, perhaps. This the voices said nothing about. But it was clear that Elias wanted to keep to himself and speak with as few people as possible. When they landed, Andrew lost him again. Andrew wandered, for a time; there was trouble, briefly. But a reasonably respectable British man abroad in America had little to fear, and soon the voices gave him what he needed: Chelsea. Not a name, but a place. *Eight arrive at eight. Be there. Meet them,* the womans voice implored. *Watch them,* the mans voice countered. The whispers trailed off. --- ***Elizabeth-*** It had felt wrong to hire that private investigator, but just now, Elizabeth was proving herself wise for having done so. *New York!* Just what was Andrew thinking? At least it was on a slow-moving freighter. Shed have ample time to settle affairs *properly* before pursuing him across the Atlantic. Elizabeth didnt much fancy the cost of a passenger ticket, but there werent many other options available. Well. She could let him go, she supposed. *If she were mad.* Her investigator had a colleague in New York, and Elizabeth enlisted the mans services to watch for Andrews arrival. Unfortunately, upon her arrival, Elizabeth learned of certain setbacks in that regard. Andrew had been difficult to track; unexpectedly so. But eventually the investigator did find him--apparently hed been picked up by the police while wandering Harlem in the middle of the night. Theyd released him soon enough, but it had left enough of an impression that word had reached the investigator. Which meant it had reached Elizabeth. Her latest piece of information was that he was enroute to the Chelsea Hotel for God knows what. It didnt matter. This time, Elizabeth would catch him, face-to-face, and get to the bottom of his aberrant behavior. She paid the investigator and dismissed him, and resolved to handle this meeting on her own. --- ***Goldie-*** Harry thought he could give her the slip. Well, not this time. Goldie couldnt just let the mook skate out on his debts. Word would get around. That would be bad for business. A couple of the boys tailed him to some ritzy joint, the Chelsea. No kind of place for the likes of Harry, that was for sure. No kind of place for the boys, either, as it happened.

Year ten there was a global pandemic, but year ten was also the end of the remediation period, so construction had to start. The contractor hosted a virtual meeting to explain the many phases of the process. The slide show had several typos. \u201cDemolition\u201d became \u201cdemonition\u201d; no apartment number was listed correctly. How disruptive would all this be, the dance professor asked, and the cherub-faced blond contractor\u2019s spokesman answered politely, \u201cVery much so, ma\u2019am.\u201d Then the chemistry professor chimed in about particulates. If the entire brick fa\u00e7ade was being torn off, what was being done about air-quality control? The chemistry professor had small children. Small children had small lungs. The blond man said that they would tape over everyone\u2019s windows. They would tape over the vents of everyone\u2019s A.C.s. \u201cSo, no A.C.s or windows?\u201d another professor asked. \u201cAll through summer, no opening windows or running A.C.s?\u201d This professor, who taught biology and kept on the building\u2019s rooftop a colony of honeybees, was not known to repeat himself. The blond man said that that was correct. And that the rooftop would be closed to accommodate the rigging, so the bee colony would have to be moved.\nTo better address the concerns of the tenants, a second virtual meeting was called, and predictably it went much worse.\nThe third virtual meeting was cancelled, and, a day later, scaffolding went up. Spaghetti-like ropes encased the building, and men in orange vests carrying hammer drills appeared on skinny platform lifts. Windows were covered with a neon-blue film that turned every room into an aquarium and gave tenants headaches. \u201cNo one\u2019s complained about the blue film before,\u201d the contractor said, though he then admitted to never having worked on an occupied building before. Clear film was procured four days later, the windows retaped.\nThe contractor did boast about having an on-site hygienist, a woman who was copied on e-mails but whom no one had met.\nFor three weeks, the noise level was terrible, from nine to five, Monday through Friday, with no pause. The new writing professor was trying to finish a novel but could only write things like \u201cSo this is what it must feel like to live inside a tooth that a dentist is trying to drill.\u201d The tooth occupied her thoughts nightly. She hadn\u2019t gone to the dentist in years. Red dust coated the window film; plumes of smoke were seen. The religion professor brought up the plumes, how, from her red-tinted window, they seemed cloudlike even. The contractor replied immediately, copying the hygienist, to clarify that what the professor saw was not a plume or anything close to a cloud but a puff of smoke being aggrandized by the wind.\nEach morning, there was an e-mail update explaining which units would be most directly affected that day, though the apartment numbers were still incorrect. So, to figure out if you were truly going to be affected, you had to watch for where the huge mechanical pulley on the roof was dropping lifts. Glancing up at the building from the outside, the ceramics professor was reminded of his childhood, and that unwinnable arcade game with a bin of plush toys and a slippery claw. He was on the corner waiting for Mister Softee. He was waiting for Mister Softee because his three boys, who were inside, had told him to text them when the truck was in sight.\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\nThe technical term for what was missing was flashing\u2014an embedded sheet of metal that prevents moisture from penetrating a building\u2019s walls. Flashing is particularly important at junctions, around windows, vent pipes, etc. No one thought anymore of the word\u2019s other meanings\u2014committing indecent exposure, for example, running buck naked across a green field in a Superman cape, as the six-year-old son of the dance professor had done during his first soccer game.\nInclement weather set in one weekend, a hurricane muscling through from the south. Rain fell for three days and nights, and the history professor, whose apartment was right below the pulley, said it sounded as if it were raining within the walls. Could there be a leak? He sent the company an audio clip. The company responded a minute later. Leaks were impossible. They had sealed all the leaks because that was what they were here to do. Below the history professor lived a math professor, who all weekend had been collecting the water that had funnelled into her office through the ceiling. She used a one-gallon bucket, and she\u2019d emptied the bucket into the bathtub five times. The math professor was married to the East Asian Studies professor. Not that ironically, the former was Asian and the latter white. Between gallons three and four, the former had drafted an angry e-mail to the school, but then stared at her unnuanced message. She worried about being the squeaky wheel, when she and her husband had upcoming third-year reviews. Still, she asked if he could rewrite and send the e-mail, given both his nuance skills and the fact that the administration might take him more seriously. That would be taking advantage of his privilege, he thought, and shook his head, but encouraged her to send the e-mail, since she should feel empowered to and he was never going to stand in her way. A quarrel about feminism followed. No e-mail was sent.\nOver text, some tenants hatched a plan. They would implore the one tenured resident\u2014an economics professor\u2014to declare war by sending the e-mail and hiring a lawyer who would then launch the war by suing the school. But the economics professor was away. He\u2019d left for Crete at the start of the construction, on a private jet owned by one of his friends.\nWithin the building, the audio clip went viral and was forwarded anonymously to the project\u2019s architect. The architect soon replied in an e-mail about how a pulley system of that weight might have shifted the building\u2019s foundation, creating fractures, but this problem was, unfortunately, beyond the company\u2019s scope. They dealt only with fa\u00e7ades. Another company did foundations.\nThe next weekend, another storm front came through. Seven gallons, the math professor counted. In the history professor\u2019s bedroom, a paint bubble, the height and width of a man, appeared on the wall overnight. He poked the bubble, afraid that it might actually be a person, like his department chair, and was sprayed, drenched, in brown water.\nThe professors lamented in the laundry room. What kind of collective e-mail to send, and in what tone? A seven-hundred-word one was drafted, with bulleted questions for further discussion. The e-mail was edited down to three hundred words, then ballooned again to a thousand.\n\u201cWe must withhold rent,\u201d the ethics professor said\u2014a thought that gave the non-activist professors palpitations.\nThe walls of the water-filled units now felt spongy, and eventually a two-hundred-word e-mail was sent, signed by all the untenured professors, and ending with the sentence \u201cWe demand immediate action.\u201d Within an hour, a fit young man arrived and handed everyone he met a business card. The card said that he was the vice-president of the company. The man noted the places where water was still seeping in. He said that there would likely be mold growth, and, should the mold be the color of soot, coal, or volcanic ash, they would need to call in the hygienist to culture it. Not all strains are toxic, he informed them. Some were perfectly O.K. In addition, he\u2019d gone up to the roof and found no visible faults around the pulley system, so perhaps the leak was a pre\u00ebxisting condition that had suddenly, coincidentally, got worse. \u201cThings like this do happen,\u201d he insisted, and added that, once the scaffolding was removed, the foundation would naturally rise up, against gravity, to its previous position. Then he tipped his hard hat at the professors and wished them a good day.\nSo construction went on unimpeded, and more storms came through, and more gallons were collected. Spores grew in the wet areas, none whose colors were quite right to be cultured. Rent was paid reliably; no more complaints were filed. In time, the professors all arrived at the same conclusion. Was the leak really that bad? On good days, it sounded like living next to a waterfall. Push through it, the way you did in grad school; then, once you get tenure, you can fly to Crete. \u2666",

The new writing professor was trying to finish a novel but could only write things like \u201cSo this is what it must feel like to live inside a tooth that a dentist is trying to drill.\u201d The tooth occupied her thoughts nightly. She hadn\u2019t gone to the dentist in years. Red dust coated the window film; plumes of smoke were seen. The religion professor brought up the plumes, how, from her red-tinted window, they seemed cloudlike even. The contractor replied immediately, copying the hygienist, to clarify that what the professor saw was not a plume or anything close to a cloud but a puff of smoke being aggrandized by the wind.\nEach morning, there was an e-mail update explaining which units would be most directly affected that day, though the apartment numbers were still incorrect. So, to figure out if you were truly going to be affected, you had to watch for where the huge mechanical pulley on the roof was dropping lifts. Glancing up at the building from the outside, the ceramics professor was reminded of his childhood, and that unwinnable arcade game with a bin of plush toys and a slippery claw. He was on the corner waiting for Mister Softee. He was waiting for Mister Softee because his three boys, who were inside, had told him to text them when the truck was in sight.\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\nThe technical term for what was missing was flashing\u2014an embedded sheet of metal that prevents moisture from penetrating a building\u2019s walls. Flashing is particularly important at junctions, around windows, vent pipes, etc. No one thought anymore of the word\u2019s other meanings\u2014committing indecent exposure, for example, running buck naked across a green field in a Superman cape, as the six-year-old son of the dance professor had done during his first soccer game.\nInclement weather set in one weekend, a hurricane muscling through from the south. Rain fell for three days and nights, and the history professor, whose apartment was right below the pulley, said it sounded as if it were raining within the walls. Could there be a leak? He sent the company an audio clip. The company responded a minute later. Leaks were impossible. They had sealed all the leaks because that was what they were here to do. Below the history professor lived a math professor, who all weekend had been collecting the water that had funnelled into her office through the ceiling. She used a one-gallon bucket, and she\u2019d emptied the bucket into the bathtub five times. The math professor was married to the East Asian Studies professor. Not that ironically, the former was Asian and the latter white. Between gallons three and four, the former had drafted an angry e-mail to the school, but then stared at her unnuanced message. She worried about being the squeaky wheel, when she and her husband had upcoming third-year reviews. Still, she asked if he could rewrite and send the e-mail, given both his nuance skills and the fact that the administration might take him more seriously. That would be taking advantage of his privilege, he thought, and shook his head, but encouraged her to send the e-mail, since she should feel empowered to and he was never going to stand in her way. A quarrel about feminism followed. No e-mail was sent.\nOver text, some tenants hatched a plan. They would implore the one tenured resident\u2014an economics professor\u2014to declare war by sending the e-mail and hiring a lawyer who would then launch the war by suing the school. But the economics professor was away. He\u2019d left for Crete at the start of the construction, on a private jet owned by one of his friends.\nWithin the building, the audio clip went viral and was forwarded anonymously to the project\u2019s architect. The architect soon replied in an e-mail about how a pulley system of that weight might have shifted the building\u2019s foundation, creating fractures, but this problem was, unfortunately, beyond the company\u2019s scope. They dealt only with fa\u00e7ades. Another company did foundations.\nThe next weekend, another storm front came through. Seven gallons, the math professor counted. In the history professor\u2019s bedroom, a paint bubble, the height and width of a man, appeared on the wall overnight. He poked the bubble, afraid that it might actually be a person, like his department chair, and was sprayed, drenched, in brown water.\nThe professors lamented in the laundry room. What kind of collective e-mail to send, and in what tone? A seven-hundred-word one was drafted, with bulleted questions for further discussion. The e-mail was edited down to three hundred words, then ballooned again to a thousand.\n\u201cWe must withhold rent,\u201d the ethics professor said\u2014a thought that gave the non-activist professors palpitations.\nThe walls of the water-filled units now felt spongy, and eventually a two-hundred-word e-mail was sent, signed by all the untenured professors, and ending with the sentence \u201cWe demand immediate action.\u201d Within an hour, a fit young man arrived and handed everyone he met a business card. The card said that he was the vice-president of the company. The man noted the places where water was still seeping in. He said that there would likely be mold growth, and, should the mold be the color of soot, coal, or volcanic ash, they would need to call in the hygienist to culture it. Not all strains are toxic, he informed them. Some were perfectly O.K. In addition, he\u2019d gone up to the roof and found no visible faults around the pulley system, so perhaps the leak was a pre\u00ebxisting condition that had suddenly, coincidentally, got worse. \u201cThings like this do happen,\u201d he insisted, and added that, once the scaffolding was removed, the foundation would naturally rise up, against gravity, to its previous position. Then he tipped his hard hat at the professors and wished them a good day.\nSo construction went on unimpeded, and more storms came through, and more gallons were collected. Spores grew in the wet areas, none whose colors were quite right to be cultured. Rent was paid reliably; no more complaints were filed. In time, the professors all arrived at the same conclusion. Was the leak really that bad? On good days, it sounded like living next to a waterfall. Push through it, the way you did in grad school; then, once you get tenure, you can fly to Crete. \u2666",
