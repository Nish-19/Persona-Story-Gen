        "writing_prompt": "After weeks of enduring Umbridge's cruel detentions, Harry's hand refuses to heal, and Snape unexpectedly takes notice. What happens when the professor's sharp tongue is paired with an uncharacteristic act of care?",
        "story": "In the stillness and silence of Umbridge's office, Harry sat writing his lines. All that could be heard was the scratching of the Quill and the occasional meowing of Umbridge's cat portraits. Harry almost felt like he was in a dream, about to wake up soon.\nAlmost. The pain in his hand stopped him from falling into the dreamlike state completely. A pity, as perhaps the time would pass faster.\n\u201cThat will do.\u201d\nHarry dropped the quill with a silent sigh of relief, resisting the urge to clutch his injured hand. Umbridge held out her hand for her usual inspection, and Harry offered it, eager to be done. His bed in the dorm was like a siren, calling him to fall into the nothingness it brought.\n\u201cSame time tomorrow,\u201d Umbridge said, and Harry had a sudden urge to punch the smile off her face permanently. Almost as If she could hear his thoughts, her smile widened. \u201cAfter all, it hasn't sunk in just yet, has it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Professor.\u201d\nFinally, his hand was released, and Harry grabbed his bag and dragged himself out of the office and to Gryffindor Tower.\n\u201cThere you are! She kept you for much longer than usual, didn't she?\u201d\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Harry said tiredly, dropping into a chair in front of the fire. The usual bowl of dittany sat on the table, and Harry soaked his hand gratefully. Hermione watched anxiously.\n\u201cIt's still not healing properly.\u201d\n\u201cBetter than nothing,\u201d Ron said. \u201cYou can't risk Snape again, Hermione.\u201d\n\u201cAgain?\u201d\nHermione turned pink. \u201cI wanted to see if there was something stronger than dittany in Professor Snape's stores, but\u2014 well, he caught me.\u201d\n\u201cOh no! What happened?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, actually. He told me that the only reason Dittany wouldn't be working was if something was preventing it, and\n\u2018I'd better not hear you have been using Dark Magic, Granger.\u2019\n\u201d\n\u201cNo detention?\u201d Harry asked disbelievingly.\nHermione shrugged. \u201cI still don't understand what is wrong with dittany. We know the quill is not the problem as it was healing before. Why isn't it now?\u201d\n\u201cIt works enough,\u201d Harry mumbled, eyes closed. \u201cEnough for me to be able to\u2026\u201d\nHe was asleep before he finished the sentence.\nWhen Harry woke up, the bowl of dittany had fallen to the floor and there was an awful crick in his neck. His hand was throbbing dully and he lifted it up to look at it with bleary eyes.\nThe words were swollen and disfigured, and Harry could only make them out because he knew what it said. Harry touched it slightly and hissed at the burn, dropping his hand. Firmly pushing it out of his mind, he picked up the bag that he'd dropped the night before and settled down to do his homework. He doubted he would manage to finish even one essay, but he couldn't bring himself to care.\nHe changed his mind later that morning as he looked up at Snape's angry eyes.\n\u201cDetention, Potter. After dinner.\u201d\n\u201cCan't,\u201d Harry said. \u201cGot detention with Umbridge.\u201d\nSnape's lips thinned. \u201cAfter, then. Or is that too late for Mr. Celebrity?\u201d\nHarry could have argued that he did need to sleep, but he just didn't have the energy. Instead, he just nodded and started on his potion, ignoring Hermione's furious inquiries.\nAfter dinner found Harry back in Umbridge's office. It had been two hours, and Harry was dreading the long detention still ahead of him when Umbridge spoke.\n\u201cThat will do.\u201d\nHarry looked up in surprise. Umbridge had a sour look on her face that reminded him of Aunt Petunia.\n\u201cProfessor Snape could not find any other time for your detention, but you\nwill\nmake it up to me, Mr. Potter.\u201d\nHarry squashed down his disgust. \u201cOf course, Professor.\u201d\nHardly believing his luck, Harry started the long trek to the dungeons. Why did Snape's office have to be so far away?\nFinally, Snape's door appeared, and Harry lifted a heavy hand to knock on it.\n\u201cCome in!\u201d\nHarry pushed the door open with considerable effort.\n\u201cYou are late, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cJust back from detention,\u201d Harry said, too tired to glare. There were a few dozen cauldrons stacked in the corner, and Harry headed for them, before Snape's voice stopped him in his tracks.\n\u201cDid I say you were to do cauldrons?\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry turned to Snape. \u201cWhat am I going to do then?\u201d\n\u201cLines.\u201d Snape smiled cruelly.\nHarry stared. Since when did Snape have him do lines?\n\u201cWell?\u201d Snape snapped. \u201cGet on with it.\u201d\nFeeling like he was dreaming again, Harry sat down on the chair. Thankfully, the quill besides the parchment was a regular quill.\n\u201cWhat should I write?\u201d\n\u201cWhat should I write, Sir?\u201d\n\u201cI must do my homework on time.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Harry bent down to begin his lines, but he could still feel Snape\u2019s eyes on him.\n\u201cWhat is wrong with your hand, Potter?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry asked, confused. \u201cNothing.\u201d\nHe put the quill down and held up his hand for emphasis.\nSnape's brow furrowed. \u201cDo you think me a fool? Other hand.\u201d\nHarry reluctantly opened the left hand towards Snape, palm up. Snape yanked at it and turned it over, and Harry winced.\nIt looked even worse than it had in the morning. The whole area was bright red so that the harsh words couldn't be seen anymore, and bright yellow splotches were visible.\n\u201cHave you tried dittany?\u201d\nHarry looked back at Snape\u2019s sharp voice. He looked even angrier than normal, which was saying something.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry shrugged. It worked in the beginning, but slowly it just\u2014 stopped.\u201d\n\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d Snape asked, summoning a jar. Harry caught sight of the label as it flew into Snape's hand \u2014\nAntibacterial Aloe Cream.\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Harry said. \u201cA month, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cAre you feeling cold? Or feverish?\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry muttered, looking at Snape's desk. He felt exposed, and if his hand hadn't been so tightly held by Snape, he might have run off.\nFinally, Snape released his hand and drew his wand. Harry tensed.\n\u201cA diagnostic Charm.\u201d\nSnape waved his wand and Harry felt a warmth spread through him, which left as quickly as it had come.\n\u201cHow shocking. You have an infection.

She kept you for much longer than usual, didn't she?\u201d\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Harry said tiredly, dropping into a chair in front of the fire. The usual bowl of dittany sat on the table, and Harry soaked his hand gratefully.

What happened?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, actually. He told me that the only reason Dittany wouldn't be working was if something was preventing it, and\n\u2018I'd better not hear you have been using Dark Magic, Granger.\u2019\n\u201d\n\u201cNo detention?\u201d Harry asked disbelievingly.\nHermione shrugged. \u201cI still don't understand what is wrong with dittany. We know the quill is not the problem as it was healing before. Why isn't it now?\u201d\n\u201cIt works enough,\u201d Harry mumbled, eyes closed. \u201cEnough for me to be able to\u2026\u201d\nHe was asleep before he finished the sentence.\nWhen Harry woke up, the bowl of dittany had fallen to the floor and there was an awful crick in his neck. His hand was throbbing dully and he lifted it up to look at it with bleary eyes.\nThe words were swollen and disfigured, and Harry could only make them out because he knew what it said. Harry touched it slightly and hissed at the burn, dropping his hand. Firmly pushing it out of his mind, he picked up the bag that he'd dropped the night before and settled down to do his homework. He doubted he would manage to finish even one essay, but he couldn't bring himself to care.\nHe changed his mind later that morning as he looked up at Snape's angry eyes.\n\u201cDetention, Potter. After dinner.\u201d\n\u201cCan't,\u201d Harry said. \u201cGot detention with Umbridge.\u201d\nSnape's lips thinned. \u201cAfter, then. Or is that too late for Mr. Celebrity?\u201d\nHarry could have argued that he did need to sleep, but he just didn't have the energy. Instead, he just nodded and started on his potion, ignoring Hermione's furious inquiries.\nAfter dinner found Harry back in Umbridge's office. It had been two hours, and Harry was dreading the long detention still ahead of him when Umbridge spoke.\n\u201cThat will do.\u201d\nHarry looked up in surprise. Umbridge had a sour look on her face that reminded him of Aunt Petunia.\n\u201cProfessor Snape could not find any other time for your detention, but you\nwill\nmake it up to me, Mr. Potter.\u201d\nHarry squashed down his disgust. \u201cOf course, Professor.\u201d\nHardly believing his luck, Harry started the long trek to the dungeons. Why did Snape's office have to be so far away?\nFinally, Snape's door appeared, and Harry lifted a heavy hand to knock on it.\n\u201cCome in!\u201d\nHarry pushed the door open with considerable effort.\n\u201cYou are late, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cJust back from detention,\u201d Harry said, too tired to glare. There were a few dozen cauldrons stacked in the corner, and Harry headed for them, before Snape's voice stopped him in his tracks.\n\u201cDid I say you were to do cauldrons?\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry turned to Snape. \u201cWhat am I going to do then?\u201d\n\u201cLines.\u201d Snape smiled cruelly.\nHarry stared. Since when did Snape have him do lines?\n\u201cWell?\u201d Snape snapped. \u201cGet on with it.\u201d\nFeeling like he was dreaming again, Harry sat down on the chair. Thankfully, the quill besides the parchment was a regular quill.\n\u201cWhat should I write?\u201d\n\u201cWhat should I write, Sir?\u201d\n\u201cI must do my homework on time.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Harry bent down to begin his lines, but he could still feel Snape\u2019s eyes on him.\n\u201cWhat is wrong with your hand, Potter?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry asked, confused. \u201cNothing.\u201d\nHe put the quill down and held up his hand for emphasis.\nSnape's brow furrowed. \u201cDo you think me a fool? Other hand.\u201d\nHarry reluctantly opened the left hand towards Snape, palm up. Snape yanked at it and turned it over, and Harry winced.\nIt looked even worse than it had in the morning. The whole area was bright red so that the harsh words couldn't be seen anymore, and bright yellow splotches were visible.\n\u201cHave you tried dittany?\u201d\nHarry looked back at Snape\u2019s sharp voice. He looked even angrier than normal, which was saying something.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry shrugged. It worked in the beginning, but slowly it just\u2014 stopped.\u201d\n\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d Snape asked, summoning a jar. Harry caught sight of the label as it flew into Snape's hand \u2014\nAntibacterial Aloe Cream.\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Harry said. \u201cA month, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cAre you feeling cold? Or feverish?\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry muttered, looking at Snape's desk. He felt exposed, and if his hand hadn't been so tightly held by Snape, he might have run off.\nFinally, Snape released his hand and drew his wand. Harry tensed.\n\u201cA diagnostic Charm.\u201d\nSnape waved his wand and Harry felt a warmth spread through him, which left as quickly as it had come.\n\u201cHow shocking. You have an infection. When did you last eat?\u201d\n\u201cDinner,\u201d Harry mumbled.\n\u201cLet me define eating, then. It refers to the act of putting food in your mouth, chewing, and swallowing it.

Other hand.\u201d\nHarry reluctantly opened the left hand towards Snape, palm up. Snape yanked at it and turned it over, and Harry winced.\nIt looked even worse than it had in the morning. The whole area was bright red so that the harsh words couldn't be seen anymore, and bright yellow splotches were visible.\n\u201cHave you tried dittany?\u201d\nHarry looked back at Snape\u2019s sharp voice. He looked even angrier than normal, which was saying something.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry shrugged. It worked in the beginning, but slowly it just\u2014 stopped.\u201d\n\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d Snape asked, summoning a jar. Harry caught sight of the label as it flew into Snape's hand \u2014\nAntibacterial Aloe Cream.\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Harry said. \u201cA month, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cAre you feeling cold? Or feverish?\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry muttered, looking at Snape's desk. He felt exposed, and if his hand hadn't been so tightly held by Snape, he might have run off.\nFinally, Snape released his hand and drew his wand. Harry tensed.\n\u201cA diagnostic Charm.\u201d\nSnape waved his wand and Harry felt a warmth spread through him, which left as quickly as it had come.\n\u201cHow shocking. You have an infection. When did you last eat?\u201d\n\u201cDinner,\u201d Harry mumbled.\n\u201cLet me define eating, then. It refers to the act of putting food in your mouth, chewing, and swallowing it. Keeping that in mind, when did you last eat?\u201d\nHarry shrugged, going red with embarrassment.\nSnape sighed. \u201cYou have detention every day \u2014\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d Harry protested, his anger flaring up. \u201cWhat for?!\u201d\n\u201c\u2014 After dinner,\u201d Snape continued, speaking over him. \u201cYou have been unnaturally disruptive, and this is the only time I can spare out of my busy day to oversee your detentions.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Oh,\u201d Harry said, understanding. \u201cAlright, thanks.\u201d\n\u201cDo not thank me, Potter. The Wizarding World would self-destruct if they were to lose their celebrity. It is entirely self-interest, I assure you.\u201d\nHarry stared. Harry might be feeling hazy, but he was sure Snape had just made a joke.\n\u201cNow,\u201d Snape said, summoning a vial. \u201cA mouthful every morning and evening. Now get to bed, immediately.\u201d\n\u201cThe detention,\u201d Harry protested.\nSnape raised an eyebrow. \u201cDo you want to write lines?\u201d\nHarry blushed. \u201cNot particularly.\u201d\n\u201cThen get out of my sight.\u201d\nHarry stood up and turned to leave.\n\u201cThe vial, Potter.\u201d\nToo embarrassed to look at Snape, Harry snatched the vial and fled.",

        "writing_prompt": "Erin has ventured beyond the forbidden five-mile marker, breaking the commune's rules, but as she surveys an abandoned cabin with a broken window and open door, she hears the sound of hoofbeats behind her\u2014someone from the commune has followed her. Who is it, and what will they do now that they\u2019ve found her?",
        "story": "Huddled in a damp and filthy jacket the lone girl rode slowly in the pre-dawn half light. There was a crispness in the fall air, clean and clear and the cold making each breath a cloud of vapor. Her ratty hood was down despite the warmth it would have provided her against the morning chill and her auburn hair was tied back in a ponytail. The chestnut quarter horse moved at an easy pace under her, following the rutted game trail, careful to pick up its hooves and place them so as to avoid the jutting roots and deadfall beneath the carpet of gold and ochre, red and yellow leaves. Erin sat deep in the saddle but hunched a bit, bow over her shoulder, arrows bundled into a sort of crude quiver made from a leather tool pouch strapped to her leg. Her eyes scanned the shadows along the crest of a low hill where they seemed to gather near the base of the white barked trees. She let her gaze linger on the darkness, confirming its vacancy. Pools of still water riffled black among the brush in the low places. Thin black branches protruded from the water. The edge of the pools fringed with reeds. The tall golden grasses made a hypnotizing sound like a whisper against the horses legs as she ascended the slope and she found her eyes getting heavy. Near the top she let out a short, sharp ho, more grunt than word and shifted her weight in the saddle. Gently she pulled back on the reins though the horse was already stopping. Red dot painted on the trunk of a tree. Nail in the center. A simple, easy to miss marker. Facing opposite the way strangers would come. She sat in the saddle eyeing it. Sniffed. Looked round. All was silent and still. Point of no return, hey Chess. Erin said to the horse and it twitched its ears and knickered as if in response. She rubbed its neck, let her bare hand rest against it a moment. This was the five mile marker. Five miles from home. She wasnt supposed to go past this point. It was forbidden. She wasnt supposed to leave the commune without someone with her either. Was never supposed to go out before dawn or after dusk. None of them were. She patted the horse's neck again. Nudged forward. The horse seemed at first hesitant to resume its earlier pace and instead went on more leisurely. Come on. she urged softly. Another nudge. He picked up the pace. Down the shaded side into the cold, the grasses here damp and high enough to wet her boots. Then up a steep dirt track past the edge of a field of tumbled down and moss-covered rocks. Before the path cut into tree cover she looked out over her right shoulder and could see the lake some miles distant. They called it Silver Lake because the old name had been forgotten and because of the way the shallows shone in the morning light. The sun was on it now, reflecting brilliantly but so near the shoulder of the mountains she rode still in shadow, the sun having not risen high enough yet to reach her. She wanted to stop and take it in longer but she reminded herself she wasnt sight-seeing this time and went on. At the crest of the hill she did stop though. From higher ground it was important to be still and to survey. After a time she dismounted and hitched the horse to a tree. The horses name was Chester; a name given to it by the Bowman's. An animal they had come to own when the trapper John Brannan had decided it was not suited to hunting and passed it along to them. It had ever been wary of the smell of guns and blood and was prone to bolt at the sound of a rifle shot. Taking her bow and arrows she whispered a reassurance to Chester, gave him another rub along his neck and then a pat before she walked out along the ridgeline, eyeing the ground. She watched for animals down in the wooded valley beyond, careful how she stepped, noting the direction of the wind. The hills were criss-crossed with wide cuts between the older, more densely packed forest here. These areas were choked with weeds, low, scraggly brush and stands of thin-trunked saplings. The remains of old ski-runs someone had told her. North of here stood an old place filled with burned out buildings that had once been a great lodge; a place for winter vacations they'd said. No-one went there now. The people that had lived there were all gone now. Nell said they had come to a bad end. The people who had stayed on _after_. Isaac had taken the girls there once, a long time after but the girls had been terrified of the place. There was a sort of superstitious fear of the place even now. Seeing nothing among the trees she crouched and waited. Waited for something like five minutes. Then, at last. _Movement._ Seventy five yards away at the edge of a clearing was movement. Something grey breaking from the dark. She felt her pulse quicken the way it always did. She had the arrow nocked but drew the string now. Raised the bow. Turned her head slightly to exhale, into the breeze not letting the vapor of her breath obscure her vision. It was a bighorn sheep, a ram judging by its wide, curving horns. It had clotted clumps of matted grey and a long white beard, it's alien eyes alert as it nosed the air. Too far away. Too much cover. She would spoil the shot and the noise would scare it off. She tried to remember what Emilie had said about their horns. How much of a curve they were supposed to have to legally hunt them back before the Fall. None of that mattered now of course, but her mind went there. She had always been interested in the way things were even if she sometimes thought Emilie and the others stretched the truth or exaggerated how easy life was by comparison. Erin knew bighorns didnt travel alone and since there was no shot to take, lowered her bow. She watched. There were four more. Tawny and pale. More animals meant more eyes to spot her, more ears to hear her. More noses to sniff her out of the air. With a bow, the best she could hope for was to take one of them. She watched them moving as they followed another trail through the trees up the face of another hill on the far side of the valley. God did she want to take one. That would make all this worth it. A quick run back, going light as she could. Then untying Chester and urging him along the ridge as fast as she dared go in the opposite direction of the big horns. She swung up onto the saddle and took him down a brush-covered defile which hid loose rocks and was more treacherous than she had expected. Chester nearly stumbled once but that was the worst of it and stayed up. Then she urged him back into a trot, angling up the hill back in the direction the sheep were travelling. Slowing as she neared it but riding along the top, trying to guess how far on she should need to ride. How far the animals might have moved. She couldn't be sure if the hill had been enough of a sound break to avoid detection but she doubted she could have gotten around them successfully without being heard. Still. When she judged she had reached roughly the right spot she pulled back on the reins and dropped from the horse's back, this time not tying the animal. Crouching she hurried up the ridge, soft boots quiet in the loamy earth. Skirting around an outcrop of rock she found a cutback and though steep she ascended it efficiently and with little sound. She slowed her breathing as she reached the summit. The bow was held high, string drawn, arrow nocked. She raised up, tried to gain a vantage point to see down the slope to the valley floor. She let out a breath, stopped. Below her on a rocky outcrop. Overgrown with weeds and surrounded by shade trees was an old, abandoned cabin. She recognized it as one of the cabins used by the trapper, though it was empty this time of year. It had once been an outbuilding built to house ski lodge equipment of some kind, or at least that's what Emilie had told her anyway. There was something odd about it though. Something out of place. She could just see the front door and window beside it from here, but the door was open instead of locked and chained closed. Also, the window appeared to have had its glass broken out. And that wasn't all... --- *I want one of you (you should collectively decide who, not just first come first serve) to have your character be out here and catch up to Erin at this point in the story. * *She is out alone, past the five mile marker on a horse that isn't hers.

When she judged she had reached roughly the right spot she pulled back on the reins and dropped from the horse's back, this time not tying the animal. Crouching she hurried up the ridge, soft boots quiet in the loamy earth. Skirting around an outcrop of rock she found a cutback and though steep she ascended it efficiently and with little sound. She slowed her breathing as she reached the summit. The bow was held high, string drawn, arrow nocked. She raised up, tried to gain a vantage point to see down the slope to the valley floor. She let out a breath, stopped. Below her on a rocky outcrop. Overgrown with weeds and surrounded by shade trees was an old, abandoned cabin. She recognized it as one of the cabins used by the trapper, though it was empty this time of year. It had once been an outbuilding built to house ski lodge equipment of some kind, or at least that's what Emilie had told her anyway. There was something odd about it though. Something out of place.

Who is it, and what will they do now that they\u2019ve found her?",
        "story": "Huddled in a damp and filthy jacket the lone girl rode slowly in the pre-dawn half light. There was a crispness in the fall air, clean and clear and the cold making each breath a cloud of vapor. Her ratty hood was down despite the warmth it would have provided her against the morning chill and her auburn hair was tied back in a ponytail. The chestnut quarter horse moved at an easy pace under her, following the rutted game trail, careful to pick up its hooves and place them so as to avoid the jutting roots and deadfall beneath the carpet of gold and ochre, red and yellow leaves. Erin sat deep in the saddle but hunched a bit, bow over her shoulder, arrows bundled into a sort of crude quiver made from a leather tool pouch strapped to her leg. Her eyes scanned the shadows along the crest of a low hill where they seemed to gather near the base of the white barked trees. She let her gaze linger on the darkness, confirming its vacancy. Pools of still water riffled black among the brush in the low places. Thin black branches protruded from the water. The edge of the pools fringed with reeds. The tall golden grasses made a hypnotizing sound like a whisper against the horses legs as she ascended the slope and she found her eyes getting heavy. Near the top she let out a short, sharp ho, more grunt than word and shifted her weight in the saddle. Gently she pulled back on the reins though the horse was already stopping. Red dot painted on the trunk of a tree. Nail in the center. A simple, easy to miss marker. Facing opposite the way strangers would come. She sat in the saddle eyeing it. Sniffed. Looked round. All was silent and still. Point of no return, hey Chess. Erin said to the horse and it twitched its ears and knickered as if in response. She rubbed its neck, let her bare hand rest against it a moment. This was the five mile marker. Five miles from home. She wasnt supposed to go past this point. It was forbidden. She wasnt supposed to leave the commune without someone with her either. Was never supposed to go out before dawn or after dusk. None of them were. She patted the horse's neck again. Nudged forward. The horse seemed at first hesitant to resume its earlier pace and instead went on more leisurely. Come on. she urged softly. Another nudge. He picked up the pace. Down the shaded side into the cold, the grasses here damp and high enough to wet her boots. Then up a steep dirt track past the edge of a field of tumbled down and moss-covered rocks. Before the path cut into tree cover she looked out over her right shoulder and could see the lake some miles distant. They called it Silver Lake because the old name had been forgotten and because of the way the shallows shone in the morning light. The sun was on it now, reflecting brilliantly but so near the shoulder of the mountains she rode still in shadow, the sun having not risen high enough yet to reach her. She wanted to stop and take it in longer but she reminded herself she wasnt sight-seeing this time and went on. At the crest of the hill she did stop though. From higher ground it was important to be still and to survey. After a time she dismounted and hitched the horse to a tree. The horses name was Chester; a name given to it by the Bowman's. An animal they had come to own when the trapper John Brannan had decided it was not suited to hunting and passed it along to them. It had ever been wary of the smell of guns and blood and was prone to bolt at the sound of a rifle shot. Taking her bow and arrows she whispered a reassurance to Chester, gave him another rub along his neck and then a pat before she walked out along the ridgeline, eyeing the ground. She watched for animals down in the wooded valley beyond, careful how she stepped, noting the direction of the wind. The hills were criss-crossed with wide cuts between the older, more densely packed forest here. These areas were choked with weeds, low, scraggly brush and stands of thin-trunked saplings. The remains of old ski-runs someone had told her. North of here stood an old place filled with burned out buildings that had once been a great lodge; a place for winter vacations they'd said. No-one went there now. The people that had lived there were all gone now. Nell said they had come to a bad end. The people who had stayed on _after_. Isaac had taken the girls there once, a long time after but the girls had been terrified of the place. There was a sort of superstitious fear of the place even now. Seeing nothing among the trees she crouched and waited. Waited for something like five minutes. Then, at last. _Movement._ Seventy five yards away at the edge of a clearing was movement. Something grey breaking from the dark. She felt her pulse quicken the way it always did. She had the arrow nocked but drew the string now. Raised the bow. Turned her head slightly to exhale, into the breeze not letting the vapor of her breath obscure her vision. It was a bighorn sheep, a ram judging by its wide, curving horns. It had clotted clumps of matted grey and a long white beard, it's alien eyes alert as it nosed the air. Too far away. Too much cover. She would spoil the shot and the noise would scare it off. She tried to remember what Emilie had said about their horns. How much of a curve they were supposed to have to legally hunt them back before the Fall. None of that mattered now of course, but her mind went there. She had always been interested in the way things were even if she sometimes thought Emilie and the others stretched the truth or exaggerated how easy life was by comparison. Erin knew bighorns didnt travel alone and since there was no shot to take, lowered her bow. She watched. There were four more. Tawny and pale. More animals meant more eyes to spot her, more ears to hear her. More noses to sniff her out of the air. With a bow, the best she could hope for was to take one of them. She watched them moving as they followed another trail through the trees up the face of another hill on the far side of the valley. God did she want to take one. That would make all this worth it. A quick run back, going light as she could. Then untying Chester and urging him along the ridge as fast as she dared go in the opposite direction of the big horns. She swung up onto the saddle and took him down a brush-covered defile which hid loose rocks and was more treacherous than she had expected. Chester nearly stumbled once but that was the worst of it and stayed up. Then she urged him back into a trot, angling up the hill back in the direction the sheep were travelling. Slowing as she neared it but riding along the top, trying to guess how far on she should need to ride. How far the animals might have moved. She couldn't be sure if the hill had been enough of a sound break to avoid detection but she doubted she could have gotten around them successfully without being heard. Still.

        "story": "The schoolmarm is playing poker in the town saloon. The stake is the saloon itself.

The sheriff likes to say that she\u2019s as pure as the spotless lily of the lake, though they have no lake, and there are no lilies in it. No damn lilies. The men cuss a lot\u2014in fact, all the time\u2014but never around the schoolmarm. Cussing doesn\u2019t go together with the schoolmarm.

The bar becomes an altar on Sundays, but there\u2019s no preacher, so the schoolmarm provides temperance lectures from it, which the men are obliged to attend. In their minds, it\u2019s still the old bar, the old saloon, so they carry along hip flasks and beef jerky to ease themselves through the unholy tedium, belching and snorting noisily.\nThe men are also obliged to take spelling and counting lessons on weekdays, using the signs on the saloon walls and the playing cards with numbers on them as their schoolbooks. The men learn that there are two \u201ct\u201ds in \u201cspitting,\u201d for example, and, when they forget or when they ignore the sign\u2019s admonition, they get their heads rapped with a wooden ruler. The schoolmarm also raps their heads for uncouth laughter, bad grammar, cigar smoking in class, and tardiness. This head-rapping hurts, and finally it\u2019s too much for them. They form a jury and condemn the schoolmarm to be hanged for her cruel city ways.\nThe schoolmarm insists that they discuss it first at their weekly meeting of the Deep Thinkers Club. The men associate deep thinking with deep drinking, so they welcome the opportunity. They\u2019ve been missing the old saloon since its unlucky conversion. They gather at their desks, as the schoolmarm calls them, feeling like they\u2019ve come home again.\nThe schoolmarm says that today, her last day, she wants them to think about justice and time, how little there is of either, and also about irony, which somehow relates to the same circumstances. The schoolmarm\u2019s just showing off again, making their brains ache, unrepentant criminal that she is. There is talk of getting on with the hanging, but the men are comfortable where they sit, sucking their teeth contentedly, so no one really wants to get up and go do it.\nThe sheriff, famous for his quick wit, says that time is what he never has enough of, but at least he\u2019s got more than the schoolmarm has. He laughs at his own little joke. The men think about it for a while, and then they laugh, too. The schoolmarm says that that\u2019s what she means by irony, and the sheriff says he\u2019s glad she explained it, because he couldn\u2019t figure out what the dang ironing had to do with anything. Neither could the others. They still can\u2019t, but they hoot and slap their desks just the same. The sheriff\u2019s a pal of theirs.\nOn the subject of justice, the sheriff considers himself something of an expert. He disagrees with the schoolmarm about there being little of it and reminds her that he himself has dealt out a potful. In deference to the schoolmarm, he doesn\u2019t say what sort of pot it was, but the men grunt knowingly. The sheriff then provides a discourse on law and order, which he says are birds of a feather. Blue, he says when someone asks, like a jay\u2019s. One of the men says he thought it was more yellowish, like a chicken hawk\u2019s. The sheriff says it depends on the color of the law that was broken, and at what time of day or night order got criminally disordered. On that subject, he explains to the Deep Thinkers that he prefers order to ordure, though they are more or less the same thing, only because \u201corder\u201d is easier to spell and don\u2019t sound so foreign.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound so foreign,\u201d the schoolmarm corrects.\n\u201cYes\u2019m, that\u2019s what I said,\u201d the sheriff says. \u201cI ain\u2019t completely stupid.\u201d The men applaud the sheriff\u2019s incomplete stupidity.\nThen the schoolmarm delivers a lecture on eternity. It is too long. Many of the men\u2019s heads are now on their desks. The schoolmarm\u2019s lecture cannot be heard over the snoring, so she walks among them, twisting their ears. This wakes up only one at a time, and meanwhile another head falls. It\u2019s a kind of dance of bouncing heads.\nHow to Live Longer, featuring Atul Gawande\nThe sheriff does not want to get his ear twisted, so while the men are dropping off he takes the schoolmarm out to hang her. On the way to the gallows, the sheriff says that sometimes, in shootouts with desperadoes or when wrestling cattle rustlers at the edge of a cliff, he suffers trepidations, and he wonders if the schoolmarm is feeling anything like that now? She isn\u2019t. Her unsentimental tough-mindedness is legendary. Self-pity, she says, is the lowest state to which a person\u2019s mind can fall. Other than lust and gluttony, of course. And indecency.\nWhen the sheriff leads the schoolmarm up onto the gallows, he says, \u201cI know you\u2019re sad about losing your life, ma\u2019am, but you gotta understand\u2014out here, life don\u2019t mean nothing. What only matters is rocks. Rocks and the un-effable, pardon the French.\u201d\n\u201cYour French loses something in the translation,\u201d the schoolmarm says, \u201cbut I suppose when you speak of the ineffable you are speaking of me.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2019m,\u201d the sheriff says. \u201cSure am.\u201d\n\u201cRocks have more to say,\u201d the schoolmarm says. \u201cThey express something profound about this place, this life, as I cannot. Language, even when grammatically correct, is simply inadequate. The situation is, in that sense, unspeakable. A landscape of rocks evokes a time before time, and the end-times as well, forcing us, while contemplating it, to live in all time at once, where words have nothing to attach themselves to.\u201d\nThe sheriff nods, but he doesn\u2019t know what the heck she\u2019s talking about. He fits the noose around her neck.\n\u201cOnly humans can experience time,\u201d the schoolmarm continues portentously, \u201cso time itself will not exist when life ends, as life inevitably must. Between the beginning of time and the end of it, there\u2019s relatively only an eyeblink, and without life there\u2019s no one to see that eyeblink or remember it. That is what rocks express. Though they are otherwise meaningless, they are, in this respect, the most meaningful thing we have, putting us in touch with oblivion. Which is the ineffablest thing of all.\u201d The schoolmarm smiles, having invented a new expression.\n\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am, ain\u2019t all this just a way of putting off what\u2019s got to happen?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes, sorry.

There is talk of getting on with the hanging, but the men are comfortable where they sit, sucking their teeth contentedly, so no one really wants to get up and go do it.\nThe sheriff, famous for his quick wit, says that time is what he never has enough of, but at least he\u2019s got more than the schoolmarm has. He laughs at his own little joke. The men think about it for a while, and then they laugh, too. The schoolmarm says that that\u2019s what she means by irony, and the sheriff says he\u2019s glad she explained it, because he couldn\u2019t figure out what the dang ironing had to do with anything. Neither could the others. They still can\u2019t, but they hoot and slap their desks just the same. The sheriff\u2019s a pal of theirs.\nOn the subject of justice, the sheriff considers himself something of an expert. He disagrees with the schoolmarm about there being little of it and reminds her that he himself has dealt out a potful. In deference to the schoolmarm, he doesn\u2019t say what sort of pot it was, but the men grunt knowingly. The sheriff then provides a discourse on law and order, which he says are birds of a feather. Blue, he says when someone asks, like a jay\u2019s. One of the men says he thought it was more yellowish, like a chicken hawk\u2019s. The sheriff says it depends on the color of the law that was broken, and at what time of day or night order got criminally disordered. On that subject, he explains to the Deep Thinkers that he prefers order to ordure, though they are more or less the same thing, only because \u201corder\u201d is easier to spell and don\u2019t sound so foreign.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound so foreign,\u201d the schoolmarm corrects.\n\u201cYes\u2019m, that\u2019s what I said,\u201d the sheriff says. \u201cI ain\u2019t completely stupid.\u201d The men applaud the sheriff\u2019s incomplete stupidity.\nThen the schoolmarm delivers a lecture on eternity. It is too long. Many of the men\u2019s heads are now on their desks. The schoolmarm\u2019s lecture cannot be heard over the snoring, so she walks among them, twisting their ears. This wakes up only one at a time, and meanwhile another head falls. It\u2019s a kind of dance of bouncing heads.\nHow to Live Longer, featuring Atul Gawande\nThe sheriff does not want to get his ear twisted, so while the men are dropping off he takes the schoolmarm out to hang her. On the way to the gallows, the sheriff says that sometimes, in shootouts with desperadoes or when wrestling cattle rustlers at the edge of a cliff, he suffers trepidations, and he wonders if the schoolmarm is feeling anything like that now? She isn\u2019t. Her unsentimental tough-mindedness is legendary. Self-pity, she says, is the lowest state to which a person\u2019s mind can fall. Other than lust and gluttony, of course. And indecency.\nWhen the sheriff leads the schoolmarm up onto the gallows, he says, \u201cI know you\u2019re sad about losing your life, ma\u2019am, but you gotta understand\u2014out here, life don\u2019t mean nothing. What only matters is rocks. Rocks and the un-effable, pardon the French.\u201d\n\u201cYour French loses something in the translation,\u201d the schoolmarm says, \u201cbut I suppose when you speak of the ineffable you are speaking of me.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2019m,\u201d the sheriff says. \u201cSure am.\u201d\n\u201cRocks have more to say,\u201d the schoolmarm says. \u201cThey express something profound about this place, this life, as I cannot. Language, even when grammatically correct, is simply inadequate. The situation is, in that sense, unspeakable. A landscape of rocks evokes a time before time, and the end-times as well, forcing us, while contemplating it, to live in all time at once, where words have nothing to attach themselves to.\u201d\nThe sheriff nods, but he doesn\u2019t know what the heck she\u2019s talking about. He fits the noose around her neck.\n\u201cOnly humans can experience time,\u201d the schoolmarm continues portentously, \u201cso time itself will not exist when life ends, as life inevitably must. Between the beginning of time and the end of it, there\u2019s relatively only an eyeblink, and without life there\u2019s no one to see that eyeblink or remember it. That is what rocks express. Though they are otherwise meaningless, they are, in this respect, the most meaningful thing we have, putting us in touch with oblivion. Which is the ineffablest thing of all.\u201d The schoolmarm smiles, having invented a new expression.\n\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am, ain\u2019t all this just a way of putting off what\u2019s got to happen?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes, sorry. I suppose it is. Give me a rock to hold.\u201d \u2666",

Perhaps she felt a strange giddy feeling when he did it, however brief.\n\"Greetings Amy.

She was adamant she wanted to keep every corner clean. Unwilling to be stopped by a simple lock, she entered the room to find rows upon rows of mannequins.\nThey were all so realistic, they seemed to breathe. Like those sci-fi movies, where humans were kept in suspended animation. Held up by long chains. Connected to long tubes that snaked around, except in this castle, the tubes were red.\nYup, the countess really loved red. And black. Typical gothic aesthetics of a rich noble family. Amy had many questions about these mannequins. But she wasn't paid to ask. She was paid to clean.\nSo, her first reaction when she accidentally broke a tube that began spraying red liquid onto the floor was to wipe the floor. The butler Vorg nagged about the waste of a perfectly preserved meal. Probably because the countess forced him to stop eating his dinner to help her out. That's what he said.\nShe likes Vorg. Even if his jokes are really weird and not funny. Like that time he joked about farming humans like cattle. Amy doesn't even see a farm anywhere near the castle grounds. But she appreciated any attempt to lighten the mood while they were working.\nAre rich people and the company they keep always this eccentric?\nTurns out, Countess Elizabeth has even more bizarre friends. Lord Elvari probably takes the cake. Dude claimed to be some kind of tentacle god. A very ancient one that can see a curse hanging over her head. Some spell by a witch who cursed people to think that supernatural entities are just strange humans who really are into this gothic Halloween look.\n\"[I've seen this curse in another woman](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/188r5lk/wp_youre_completely_oblivious_to_the_supernatural/kbntqef/), Amy,\" he spoke in a rather grave tone. \"I can remove the spell if you wish.\"\n\"No offense, my lord, but this is the third time you've said this same joke.

I'm telling you, he's the one under some magic that messed up his sense of humour.\"\n\"Perhaps you mean, sucked him dry of humour?\" The pale lord chuckled.\nAmy laughed at what was probably the first good joke she heard in the castle for a long time.\n\"What brings you here on this day?\" She couldn't resist asking.\nHe flashed her one of those charming smiles. \"I'm here to retrieve some mannequins. Don't tell Elizabeth, okay?\"\n\"Okay.\"\n**\n--\nElizabeth was screaming about the empty storeroom.

Will couldn\u2019t help but start laughing.\n\u201cIt does look like a duck!\u201d\nNico burst out laughing with him.\nIt took a few minutes but eventually they calmed down.\n\u201cOkay, we got the basics.\u201d Will caught his breath.\n\u201cWait but there\u2019s more right?\u201d Nico said. \u201cWhen people make out and stuff. They lick each other.\u201d\n\u201cOh my gods!\u201d Will was both cracking up and blushing hard enough he glowed.\n\u201cWhat? They lick each others\u2019 mouths and stuff.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I guess they lick each other.\u201d Will gasped for air.\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t they bite each other too? Eat each other?\u201d\nWill howled with laughter, rolling onto his side and clutching his stomach. Nico couldn\u2019t help but smile at the sight.\n\u201cWhat? What did I say?\u201d\nWill sat back up, a hand over his mouth to cover his laughter.\n\u201cOne last question, I promise,\u201d Nico implored. \u201cWhat do you do with your eyes?\u201d\n\u201cYou shut them,\u201d Will said. He closed his eyes for demonstration. When he opened them, Nico nodded thoughtfully.\nBefore Will could process it, Nico had shut his eyes, leaned forward and given him a brief but sweet kiss.\n\u201cLike that?\u201d Nico questioned nervously.\nWill\u2019s brain had stopped working. His mouth opened and closed aimlessly and his eyes were as wide as saucers.\n\u201cDid I get it wrong?\u201d\nWill shook his head. \u201cNo... You know, these things take practice.\u201d\nNico raised an eyebrow. \u201cReally? It\u2019s just mushing faces together. I think I did pretty good.\u201d\n\u201cYou did amazing,\u201d Will confirmed. \u201cBut there\u2019s other stuff too.\u201d\nHe shuffled closer, gazing into Nico\u2019s wide eyes. He raised his hands to cup Nico\u2019s face and tuck that bit of loose hair behind his ear.\n\u201cLike this?\u201d Nico lifted his hands to do the same to Will\u2019s face, brown eyes looking over every inch of it.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Will said quietly. \u201cThen you lean in.\u201d\nHe leaned in as he spoke until their lips were a breath away. He couldn\u2019t stop looking at how close they were.\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to close your eyes,\u201d Nico whispered. Will nodded.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nAnd he did.",

Halfway there it started to rain, so Roy ducked under a canopy in front of the entrance to an apartment building. A very tall, sturdily built blond lady wearing a thin black coat came out of the building.

Maybe I\u2019ll go when it stops raining.\u201d\nHe opened the refrigerator and took out a bottle of milk.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the leader of the Amazons called?\u201d Roy asked.\n\u201cA virago,\u201d said Pops.\n\u201cIs that the same as queen?\u201d\n\u201cYou need a king to have a queen, Roy. No, a virago is a termagant.\u201d\n\u201cTermagant?

In a rational world, she wouldn't be speeding around on a motorbike in spandex punching other spandex clad villains as they tried to take over the city. A no-nonsense person, she figured, would be filing their taxes in early March as opposed to fighting crime.\nSecond of all, she tried to have fun on the job. She was riding a motorcycle for goodness sake. Who could say that a motorcycle was the most practical form of transportation! If she weren't fun loving and self indulgent, she would be taking public transport around the city. That would be helping solve the falling ridership issue, and securing funding for public transit might be more critical to the city than punching any villain.\nIn, as far as Intricate understood, she was a fun-loving, nonsense filled hero, just as much as anyone else. Okay, maybe not as much as 'everyone else' but many of them were just plain unprofessional!\nAside from bristling against the no-nonsense label, Intricate had also found that it made her life, marginally harder.

They objectively were,  but they were more frantic than they were when they fought other heroes.\nShe'd seen videos of the famous showdowns, everyone had. The villains talked, they japed, they showed off. Intricate? Intricate got none of that. It was straight to business when she showed up.\nBack at the start, villains had tried talking through their fights, but, it'd literally fallen on deaf ears.\nMaybe that was what made people think she was no-nonsense. She couldn't take fun, after battle, interviews because there were rarely interpreters around after a fight. Logically they ran away once the building-chunks started flying.\nThat no-nonsense label was also why Intricate was sitting on her bed, in her 'Miranda' clothes considering whether she was going to get dressed for the day of crime fighting. She read the news. She understood how brand deals worked.\nShe liked protecting people, loved it even, it filled her with purpose, but at the same time... reading that the city you protect doesn't like you is never a good way to start the morning.\nBut she'd gotten the call, people needed help. So she'd get ready as she always did. One glove at a time, and in the peace and quiet.\n....\nBy the time Intricate reached the scene of the crime, chaos had already ensued, past tense. She was late. Now there were police scattered around the bank using their cruises as shields and keeping an eye on the main door. There was only one way in or out of the central bank. Whoever was in there would have to fight they way out.\nIntricate pulled up to the scene and hopped off her motorcycle. The first thing she caught in the corner of her eyes was someone rolling theirs. She frowned. Allowed herself an extended blink, then moved on. Marching toward the door without knowing what was going on inside.\nPerhaps that was part of her label as well, Intricate's armor was nigh-invincible, and means that she was able to simply walk at most threats. She started up the steps then turned and waved the police officers further back.\nThey didn't move.\nIntricate tried again with, what she feared, was too much enthusiasm. She wanted them to get to safe distance, not to think she was telling them to shoo.\nShe was too far in her head, it was probably fine.\nIntricate entered the bank, tossing the door open and marching into the foyer. In the dead centre of the room was a villain that she didn'tm recognize.\nMost cities had a rogue's gallery of a sort. Sure, they got locked away, but there were only so many powers in a population and keeping them in jail was a pain in the ass. That all to say, it was a rare novelty to see an unknown on a crime scene.\nThe woman, villain, opened her mouth and clearly said something. She was only wearing half a mask so Intricate, in theory, had a chance to read her lips, but she'd never been good at that. A second later, the woman stopped and scanned Intricate.\nShe was never, so Intricate gave her the moment to do so.\nThen another novelty.\n\"Intricate, it's a pleasure.\" the woman signed. Intricate stared for a moment. She knew the words enough to understand them, but was too distracted by what the hell was going on to process them. She only had the common response to this revelation.\n\"You sign?\" Intricate ask.\n\"Obviously.\" the woman retorted. The signs were somewhat hard to read, a mix of rough gestures and the multicolored costume contrasted with her dark skin. Too much extra visual noise.\n\"I'm going to stop you.\" Intricate signed back. She took a deep breath, but instead of moving right into a fight, the woman kept signing.\n\"You're going to stop me? How adorable. Don't you know how long I've planned this heist for?\"\n\"No?\"\n\"Months. Months I've been waiting to come onto the scene and fight you.

You don't need to sit there and listen to a monologue and--\" The villain, Intricate had never asked her name, stopped, she needed her hands for this.\nBut it was too late, Intricate was on top of her.\nThat villain was right, she didn't need to sit there and listen to a monologue, but she was wrong about Intricate.\nShe'd show her she was fun, hit by hit.",

The parchment balanced on your knee was half forgotten, the pot of ink and writing quill sitting on the windowsill as a mere figment, now. A storm must be brewing over the sea, and you wondered if you would experience it before night fell and sleep welcomed you with wide open arms.\nPrince Aemond was many things, on many occasions, for many people. He was calculating, yet\ntempered\n. Unforgiving, attentive.\nImpulsive\n, and intelligent. He was\nwild\n, yet subtlety - veiled or otherwise - had proven to be a quality that he had shown little interest in practicing. It was something he never seemed to regret, even if it meant spiraling petty feuds into further disarray, or simply tugging on fraying threads during family dinners that lead to hurled threats and slamming doors. It was a little cocoon of his own making, this calmly crafted life of controlled chaos.\nYet you were the exception - both you\nand\nHeleana - until, of course, it was only you that remained shielded no longer.\nYou were oblivious, in your daydreams, to the chaos raging fierce and strong in your own home - until the door to your rooms flew open to\ncrack\nsharply on the wall behind.\nAemond didn\u2019t expect to find you here. With the evening promising rain and fury, he assumed you\u2019d be enjoying the fresh air as long as time allowed,\nbut\n. He had come here to breathe, yet the irritation simmering slow and hot and vicious under his skin craved a release of any kind, as it always does.\nRegret\nwas hardly an intimate word for Aemond, yet it lingered, unyielding, clouding his mind once the red melted from his vision and his blackened heart returned to gold.\nThe way he\u2019d allowed his lack of care to send you slamming the door to your apartments as you left him -\nfuming\n, in the wake of your own reciprocated wrath - well. It left him feeling anything other than comfort.\nIt was a whirlwind in the flesh, truly, the tense words he had flung to bite at your heart. Cold, calm fury battered them aside, broke through the weakening shield Aemond held fast around himself in an excuse to project without circumstance. Without consequence. He hadn\u2019t been able to draw blood of course, you knew him too well to know it wasn\u2019t\nyou\nthat had cracked his everlasting dragonskin.\nYou, however, had always been a different story.\nArmed to the teeth with words that would puncture, pierce, cut to bleed and\ntwist\n, when pushed too hard, too far; a cloak of blame had been settled upon your shoulders, and it was not yours to bear. You tore it off with a simple tug, flourished the fabric in such a way that it clung to the Prince himself, the villain in this particular instance, but not a villain at heart.\nAemond was left staring where you had once been; a window that was open, brilliant view of the darkening sky echoing behind you, the sole outlet for the latest qualm that had been one push, one prod, one irrelevant instance too far - because,\nwell\n.\nAs collected as he usually was, there was always\nsomething\nthat would push anyone over the edge.\nRegardless, he had never once abandoned the training grounds to take his ire out on you. He sought only your company after all; a sun, a saint, an equal to temper what always tried to break through the rising tide.\nSeven\nfucking\nhells.\nIt wasn\u2019t a surprise, when he did not follow you through your rooms, or down the glowing hall.\nSconces were being lit as a false twilight fell, the sweet, early arrival of blue hour inspired haste in the servants lighting your way to the library. The shadows were chased away, one by one; yet the shadow that still enveloped your path was not of nature\u2019s doing, nor was it your own.\nWooden doors loomed before you, bracketed by torches bright and warm and welcoming. You had stalked all the way here you realized, swift and mindless in where your feet had been taking you. Anger still burned through your veins, when you pushed the door open with your whole body. Hinges groaned with the sudden movement jarring them awake.\nSilence engulfed you once the door fell shut. Familiarity took you into its arms under the soft light of candles guttering in the fresh stir of air - rarely, did anyone come here at this hour. The knowledge that you wouldn\u2019t be disturbed tempered your fire.\nThe sigh that left your lips was ragged. Shaken.\nHurt\n.\nThis was something new from Aemond - something that made you wonder\nwhat\nin the\nseven hells\njust\nhappened\n.\nYour feet carried you to the nearest window, and the breeze that met your skin was a soft caress tasting of salt and comfort - probably - since that was something you would not be receiving anytime soon, you imagined. Not from the one you wished, at least.\nHe made that\nquite fucking clear\n, actually.\nThe drawl of distant rumbling welcomed you as you journeyed farther into the room, fingers trailing along the old wooden tables in your wake. The emptiness was peaceful, the candlelight warm and soft in stark contrast with the scene you just left to simmer. You went to the windows, drawing them in tight, before the rain could intrude where it did not belong.\nAnger was a fickle thing,\nyou thought, turning a corner. The goal was to become lost in the maze of shelves piled high with long forgotten crumbling volumes. To find a tome that caught your eye in the looming shadows, then settle in with it while you tucked yourself up into one of the few window seats with the raging sea below as your steadfast companion.\nYou\u2019d stay here with your false peace until your eyes drifted closed and your head leaned against rain spattered glass. Unless, of course, you were confident that retracing your steps to venture back wouldn\u2019t reignite what brought you here in the first place. Perhaps then, you would be cooled enough to seek each other\u2019s company, as your heart so longed to do, even now.\nEven so, the distant rumbling grew louder with each page you turned. Rain crackled into the glass as the wind whipped past. The more you read, the pages became even more brown and stiff as they slowly shared with you their age.\nThe storm, once far out of your sight, seemed to be right on top of you now as it unleashed its fury hard and strong and fast as it battered itself again and again and\nagain\nagainst the city below, and punished the castle walls themselves.\nIt was because of this, that every sound coming from within was, of course, as good as silent.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d find you here.\u201d\nHis voice filled what little lull a storm of this magnitude could give. It slid over your skin, soft as silk, slipped in through the little cracks along with the rain and wind and thunder alike.\nPrince Aemond stood in the glow of torchlight, illuminated wholly in the warm caress of flickering flame. He remained some distance from you, mindful of the space you held both for yourself, and, more pressingly - the distance you created when he pushed you oh, so splendidly away earlier that evening.\n\u201cWell,\u201d your eyes slid away from the prince, to instead find the paragraph they had been pulled away from. Your next words were spoken idly, if not with remnants of\nferocity\ncoating them as you resumed reading. \u201cYou\ndo\nknow where I like to hide.\u201d\nAemond shifts his weight - it\u2019s caught out the corner of your eye - and a shadow promptly slips across you to blanket the words on the pages. It was, by design, a darkness you weren\u2019t able to see through, not with the storm outside batting aside the sun\u2019s dying rays with its gray clouds and veils of rain.\nIntentional\n.\n\u201cSo you\nare\nhiding from me.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018\nHide\n\u2019 is not the word I would use.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThe book snapped shut in your hands on a sigh dragged from the weary depths of your heart. They were both, unfortunately, swallowed by another rolling volley of thunder. The timing was so dramatic, so absolutely\nyou\n, that it wasn\u2019t Aemond\u2019s fault when it inspired a harsh roll of his eye.\nHe could be dramatic too, if only to distract you from the way his lips quirked, the flash of a smile threatening to show itself in the darkness, or in the shine of the firelight still kissing fragments of his skin. Aemond knew this wasn\u2019t the time for jokes, yet even he could appreciate the irony of the trap\nhe\nlaid, and, quite gracefully, stepped right into.\nLightning forked through the sky on another crash of thunder, the flash cold in contrast to the warmth of the library. It was jarring, how the harsh, white light exposed everything, always, quickly and quietly before it melted back into the safety of blowing rain and raging waves.\nAnd yet, it was enough. Enough to see the tension weaving its way through Prince Aemond\u2019s jaw, and the set of his shoulders. How he hid his hands behind his back, no doubt clasped and curled in an unbreakable grip. Aemond clearly found no comfort here tonight. He held himself wound tight - even more so, almost, than he did when all the eyes watched him while at court.\nYou, on the other hand, were relaxed, given the circumstances. Lounging comfortably in the window seat while allowing the peace and the stillness to wash over you in the place you felt safest in all of King\u2019s Landing.\nGuilt\n, you realized, still sitting in his shadow.\nThis was what his guilt looked like.\nYou had wondered if Aemond could even feel such a thing.\n\u201cNo,\u201d you answered his question slowly. Let the bite fade from your voice and fall into the storm. Let it melt back into nothing. \u201cI believe I would choose \u2018\nisolate\n\u2019. I assumed neither one of us wanted that conversation to continue while clawing at each other\u2019s throats, as we were.\u201d\nAemond took a breath, inhaled loud and sharp in time with a sheet of rain being pushed against the windowpane. He looked away as you watched him, your feet uncurling from their place on the seat, the volume slipping through your fingers to rest beside you.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d\nYou stepped from the shadows and went to him, still hiding in the safety of the dark. He longed to reach for you, longed to feel your skin, warm from the fire, warm from the peace you always seemed to carve for yourself - but his fingertips were cold from the time he spent solitary in your rooms after you had gone. The fires burned to ashes as he tempered himself, once again, into honed steel that the prince sheathed - if only so he could see you again, without drawing blood once more. Now that he found you, he feared you would find only ice under his touch, instead of comfort.\nIt made his heart\nache\n.\nAnd\nyou\n-\nAemond shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, when he found his fingers threaded through yours. A hand glided up to rest on his jaw, guiding it gently to face you. The fire was gone from your eyes, tension nowhere to be found in your body language. He could see in you, just how much you could read him, even when he said so little. Even when he said everything he didn\u2019t mean.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d you took a step backwards toward the entrance, tugging on his hand as you did so. The corners of your lips quirked, the prelude of a small smile illuminating the shadows Aemond still hid in. \u201cLet\u2019s go brew some tea and\u2026maybe we can talk.\u201d\nHis head dips in agreement, oddly silent since he last spoke. It was almost as if\u2026as if he wasn\u2019t sure the words that wanted to spill out would be the right ones.\nKind\nones. Instead, his chilled fingers finally curled gently around your own.\nAll he can bring himself to say is, \u201cLead on, darling.\u201d\nSo you do, leading him through gloomy shadows deepened by the storm, to hallways illuminated by torches, by lightning, by\nyou\n.",

The more you read, the pages became even more brown and stiff as they slowly shared with you their age.\nThe storm, once far out of your sight, seemed to be right on top of you now as it unleashed its fury hard and strong and fast as it battered itself again and again and\nagain\nagainst the city below, and punished the castle walls themselves.\nIt was because of this, that every sound coming from within was, of course, as good as silent.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d find you here.\u201d\nHis voice filled what little lull a storm of this magnitude could give. It slid over your skin, soft as silk, slipped in through the little cracks along with the rain and wind and thunder alike.\nPrince Aemond stood in the glow of torchlight, illuminated wholly in the warm caress of flickering flame. He remained some distance from you, mindful of the space you held both for yourself, and, more pressingly - the distance you created when he pushed you oh, so splendidly away earlier that evening.\n\u201cWell,\u201d your eyes slid away from the prince, to instead find the paragraph they had been pulled away from. Your next words were spoken idly, if not with remnants of\nferocity\ncoating them as you resumed reading. \u201cYou\ndo\nknow where I like to hide.\u201d\nAemond shifts his weight - it\u2019s caught out the corner of your eye - and a shadow promptly slips across you to blanket the words on the pages. It was, by design, a darkness you weren\u2019t able to see through, not with the storm outside batting aside the sun\u2019s dying rays with its gray clouds and veils of rain.\nIntentional\n.\n\u201cSo you\nare\nhiding from me.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018\nHide\n\u2019 is not the word I would use.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThe book snapped shut in your hands on a sigh dragged from the weary depths of your heart. They were both, unfortunately, swallowed by another rolling volley of thunder. The timing was so dramatic, so absolutely\nyou\n, that it wasn\u2019t Aemond\u2019s fault when it inspired a harsh roll of his eye.\nHe could be dramatic too, if only to distract you from the way his lips quirked, the flash of a smile threatening to show itself in the darkness, or in the shine of the firelight still kissing fragments of his skin. Aemond knew this wasn\u2019t the time for jokes, yet even he could appreciate the irony of the trap\nhe\nlaid, and, quite gracefully, stepped right into.\nLightning forked through the sky on another crash of thunder, the flash cold in contrast to the warmth of the library. It was jarring, how the harsh, white light exposed everything, always, quickly and quietly before it melted back into the safety of blowing rain and raging waves.\nAnd yet, it was enough. Enough to see the tension weaving its way through Prince Aemond\u2019s jaw, and the set of his shoulders. How he hid his hands behind his back, no doubt clasped and curled in an unbreakable grip. Aemond clearly found no comfort here tonight. He held himself wound tight - even more so, almost, than he did when all the eyes watched him while at court.\nYou, on the other hand, were relaxed, given the circumstances. Lounging comfortably in the window seat while allowing the peace and the stillness to wash over you in the place you felt safest in all of King\u2019s Landing.\nGuilt\n, you realized, still sitting in his shadow.\nThis was what his guilt looked like.\nYou had wondered if Aemond could even feel such a thing.\n\u201cNo,\u201d you answered his question slowly. Let the bite fade from your voice and fall into the storm. Let it melt back into nothing. \u201cI believe I would choose \u2018\nisolate\n\u2019. I assumed neither one of us wanted that conversation to continue while clawing at each other\u2019s throats, as we were.\u201d\nAemond took a breath, inhaled loud and sharp in time with a sheet of rain being pushed against the windowpane. He looked away as you watched him, your feet uncurling from their place on the seat, the volume slipping through your fingers to rest beside you.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d\nYou stepped from the shadows and went to him, still hiding in the safety of the dark. He longed to reach for you, longed to feel your skin, warm from the fire, warm from the peace you always seemed to carve for yourself - but his fingertips were cold from the time he spent solitary in your rooms after you had gone. The fires burned to ashes as he tempered himself, once again, into honed steel that the prince sheathed - if only so he could see you again, without drawing blood once more. Now that he found you, he feared you would find only ice under his touch, instead of comfort.\nIt made his heart\nache\n.\nAnd\nyou\n-\nAemond shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, when he found his fingers threaded through yours. A hand glided up to rest on his jaw, guiding it gently to face you. The fire was gone from your eyes, tension nowhere to be found in your body language. He could see in you, just how much you could read him, even when he said so little. Even when he said everything he didn\u2019t mean.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d you took a step backwards toward the entrance, tugging on his hand as you did so. The corners of your lips quirked, the prelude of a small smile illuminating the shadows Aemond still hid in. \u201cLet\u2019s go brew some tea and\u2026maybe we can talk.\u201d\nHis head dips in agreement, oddly silent since he last spoke. It was almost as if\u2026as if he wasn\u2019t sure the words that wanted to spill out would be the right ones.\nKind\nones. Instead, his chilled fingers finally curled gently around your own.\nAll he can bring himself to say is, \u201cLead on, darling.\u201d\nSo you do, leading him through gloomy shadows deepened by the storm, to hallways illuminated by torches, by lightning, by\nyou\n.",

        "story": "The afternoon air was thick with tension and dripping destruction, though you seemed to be none the wiser. So swept up were you, in the beauty of deep blue skies and the path of charcoal gray clouds as they passed by on the warm wind. The parchment balanced on your knee was half forgotten, the pot of ink and writing quill sitting on the windowsill as a mere figment, now. A storm must be brewing over the sea, and you wondered if you would experience it before night fell and sleep welcomed you with wide open arms.\nPrince Aemond was many things, on many occasions, for many people. He was calculating, yet\ntempered\n. Unforgiving, attentive.\nImpulsive\n, and intelligent. He was\nwild\n, yet subtlety - veiled or otherwise - had proven to be a quality that he had shown little interest in practicing. It was something he never seemed to regret, even if it meant spiraling petty feuds into further disarray, or simply tugging on fraying threads during family dinners that lead to hurled threats and slamming doors. It was a little cocoon of his own making, this calmly crafted life of controlled chaos.\nYet you were the exception - both you\nand\nHeleana - until, of course, it was only you that remained shielded no longer.\nYou were oblivious, in your daydreams, to the chaos raging fierce and strong in your own home - until the door to your rooms flew open to\ncrack\nsharply on the wall behind.\nAemond didn\u2019t expect to find you here. With the evening promising rain and fury, he assumed you\u2019d be enjoying the fresh air as long as time allowed,\nbut\n. He had come here to breathe, yet the irritation simmering slow and hot and vicious under his skin craved a release of any kind, as it always does.\nRegret\nwas hardly an intimate word for Aemond, yet it lingered, unyielding, clouding his mind once the red melted from his vision and his blackened heart returned to gold.\nThe way he\u2019d allowed his lack of care to send you slamming the door to your apartments as you left him -\nfuming\n, in the wake of your own reciprocated wrath - well. It left him feeling anything other than comfort.\nIt was a whirlwind in the flesh, truly, the tense words he had flung to bite at your heart. Cold, calm fury battered them aside, broke through the weakening shield Aemond held fast around himself in an excuse to project without circumstance. Without consequence. He hadn\u2019t been able to draw blood of course, you knew him too well to know it wasn\u2019t\nyou\nthat had cracked his everlasting dragonskin.\nYou, however, had always been a different story.\nArmed to the teeth with words that would puncture, pierce, cut to bleed and\ntwist\n, when pushed too hard, too far; a cloak of blame had been settled upon your shoulders, and it was not yours to bear. You tore it off with a simple tug, flourished the fabric in such a way that it clung to the Prince himself, the villain in this particular instance, but not a villain at heart.\nAemond was left staring where you had once been; a window that was open, brilliant view of the darkening sky echoing behind you, the sole outlet for the latest qualm that had been one push, one prod, one irrelevant instance too far - because,\nwell\n.\nAs collected as he usually was, there was always\nsomething\nthat would push anyone over the edge.\nRegardless, he had never once abandoned the training grounds to take his ire out on you. He sought only your company after all; a sun, a saint, an equal to temper what always tried to break through the rising tide.\nSeven\nfucking\nhells.\nIt wasn\u2019t a surprise, when he did not follow you through your rooms, or down the glowing hall.\nSconces were being lit as a false twilight fell, the sweet, early arrival of blue hour inspired haste in the servants lighting your way to the library. The shadows were chased away, one by one; yet the shadow that still enveloped your path was not of nature\u2019s doing, nor was it your own.\nWooden doors loomed before you, bracketed by torches bright and warm and welcoming. You had stalked all the way here you realized, swift and mindless in where your feet had been taking you. Anger still burned through your veins, when you pushed the door open with your whole body. Hinges groaned with the sudden movement jarring them awake.\nSilence engulfed you once the door fell shut. Familiarity took you into its arms under the soft light of candles guttering in the fresh stir of air - rarely, did anyone come here at this hour. The knowledge that you wouldn\u2019t be disturbed tempered your fire.\nThe sigh that left your lips was ragged. Shaken.\nHurt\n.\nThis was something new from Aemond - something that made you wonder\nwhat\nin the\nseven hells\njust\nhappened\n.\nYour feet carried you to the nearest window, and the breeze that met your skin was a soft caress tasting of salt and comfort - probably - since that was something you would not be receiving anytime soon, you imagined. Not from the one you wished, at least.\nHe made that\nquite fucking clear\n, actually.\nThe drawl of distant rumbling welcomed you as you journeyed farther into the room, fingers trailing along the old wooden tables in your wake. The emptiness was peaceful, the candlelight warm and soft in stark contrast with the scene you just left to simmer. You went to the windows, drawing them in tight, before the rain could intrude where it did not belong.\nAnger was a fickle thing,\nyou thought, turning a corner. The goal was to become lost in the maze of shelves piled high with long forgotten crumbling volumes. To find a tome that caught your eye in the looming shadows, then settle in with it while you tucked yourself up into one of the few window seats with the raging sea below as your steadfast companion.\nYou\u2019d stay here with your false peace until your eyes drifted closed and your head leaned against rain spattered glass. Unless, of course, you were confident that retracing your steps to venture back wouldn\u2019t reignite what brought you here in the first place. Perhaps then, you would be cooled enough to seek each other\u2019s company, as your heart so longed to do, even now.\nEven so, the distant rumbling grew louder with each page you turned. Rain crackled into the glass as the wind whipped past.

A hand glided up to rest on his jaw, guiding it gently to face you. The fire was gone from your eyes, tension nowhere to be found in your body language. He could see in you, just how much you could read him, even when he said so little. Even when he said everything he didn\u2019t mean.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d you took a step backwards toward the entrance, tugging on his hand as you did so. The corners of your lips quirked, the prelude of a small smile illuminating the shadows Aemond still hid in. \u201cLet\u2019s go brew some tea and\u2026maybe we can talk.\u201d\nHis head dips in agreement, oddly silent since he last spoke. It was almost as if\u2026as if he wasn\u2019t sure the words that wanted to spill out would be the right ones.\nKind\nones. Instead, his chilled fingers finally curled gently around your own.\nAll he can bring himself to say is, \u201cLead on, darling.\u201d\nSo you do, leading him through gloomy shadows deepened by the storm, to hallways illuminated by torches, by lightning, by\nyou\n.",

        "writing_prompt": "A storm rages outside, but the true tempest brews within the castle walls as Prince Aemond seeks you out, guilt and tension heavy in the air after a heated argument. Will the storm outside mirror the one between you, or will the calm finally break through?",
        "story": "The afternoon air was thick with tension and dripping destruction, though you seemed to be none the wiser. So swept up were you, in the beauty of deep blue skies and the path of charcoal gray clouds as they passed by on the warm wind. The parchment balanced on your knee was half forgotten, the pot of ink and writing quill sitting on the windowsill as a mere figment, now. A storm must be brewing over the sea, and you wondered if you would experience it before night fell and sleep welcomed you with wide open arms.\nPrince Aemond was many things, on many occasions, for many people. He was calculating, yet\ntempered\n. Unforgiving, attentive.\nImpulsive\n, and intelligent. He was\nwild\n, yet subtlety - veiled or otherwise - had proven to be a quality that he had shown little interest in practicing. It was something he never seemed to regret, even if it meant spiraling petty feuds into further disarray, or simply tugging on fraying threads during family dinners that lead to hurled threats and slamming doors. It was a little cocoon of his own making, this calmly crafted life of controlled chaos.\nYet you were the exception - both you\nand\nHeleana - until, of course, it was only you that remained shielded no longer.\nYou were oblivious, in your daydreams, to the chaos raging fierce and strong in your own home - until the door to your rooms flew open to\ncrack\nsharply on the wall behind.\nAemond didn\u2019t expect to find you here. With the evening promising rain and fury, he assumed you\u2019d be enjoying the fresh air as long as time allowed,\nbut\n. He had come here to breathe, yet the irritation simmering slow and hot and vicious under his skin craved a release of any kind, as it always does.\nRegret\nwas hardly an intimate word for Aemond, yet it lingered, unyielding, clouding his mind once the red melted from his vision and his blackened heart returned to gold.\nThe way he\u2019d allowed his lack of care to send you slamming the door to your apartments as you left him -\nfuming\n, in the wake of your own reciprocated wrath - well. It left him feeling anything other than comfort.\nIt was a whirlwind in the flesh, truly, the tense words he had flung to bite at your heart. Cold, calm fury battered them aside, broke through the weakening shield Aemond held fast around himself in an excuse to project without circumstance. Without consequence. He hadn\u2019t been able to draw blood of course, you knew him too well to know it wasn\u2019t\nyou\nthat had cracked his everlasting dragonskin.\nYou, however, had always been a different story.\nArmed to the teeth with words that would puncture, pierce, cut to bleed and\ntwist\n, when pushed too hard, too far; a cloak of blame had been settled upon your shoulders, and it was not yours to bear. You tore it off with a simple tug, flourished the fabric in such a way that it clung to the Prince himself, the villain in this particular instance, but not a villain at heart.\nAemond was left staring where you had once been; a window that was open, brilliant view of the darkening sky echoing behind you, the sole outlet for the latest qualm that had been one push, one prod, one irrelevant instance too far - because,\nwell\n.\nAs collected as he usually was, there was always\nsomething\nthat would push anyone over the edge.\nRegardless, he had never once abandoned the training grounds to take his ire out on you. He sought only your company after all; a sun, a saint, an equal to temper what always tried to break through the rising tide.\nSeven\nfucking\nhells.\nIt wasn\u2019t a surprise, when he did not follow you through your rooms, or down the glowing hall.\nSconces were being lit as a false twilight fell, the sweet, early arrival of blue hour inspired haste in the servants lighting your way to the library. The shadows were chased away, one by one; yet the shadow that still enveloped your path was not of nature\u2019s doing, nor was it your own.\nWooden doors loomed before you, bracketed by torches bright and warm and welcoming. You had stalked all the way here you realized, swift and mindless in where your feet had been taking you. Anger still burned through your veins, when you pushed the door open with your whole body. Hinges groaned with the sudden movement jarring them awake.\nSilence engulfed you once the door fell shut. Familiarity took you into its arms under the soft light of candles guttering in the fresh stir of air - rarely, did anyone come here at this hour. The knowledge that you wouldn\u2019t be disturbed tempered your fire.\nThe sigh that left your lips was ragged. Shaken.\nHurt\n.\nThis was something new from Aemond - something that made you wonder\nwhat\nin the\nseven hells\njust\nhappened\n.\nYour feet carried you to the nearest window, and the breeze that met your skin was a soft caress tasting of salt and comfort - probably - since that was something you would not be receiving anytime soon, you imagined. Not from the one you wished, at least.\nHe made that\nquite fucking clear\n, actually.\nThe drawl of distant rumbling welcomed you as you journeyed farther into the room, fingers trailing along the old wooden tables in your wake. The emptiness was peaceful, the candlelight warm and soft in stark contrast with the scene you just left to simmer. You went to the windows, drawing them in tight, before the rain could intrude where it did not belong.\nAnger was a fickle thing,\nyou thought, turning a corner. The goal was to become lost in the maze of shelves piled high with long forgotten crumbling volumes. To find a tome that caught your eye in the looming shadows, then settle in with it while you tucked yourself up into one of the few window seats with the raging sea below as your steadfast companion.\nYou\u2019d stay here with your false peace until your eyes drifted closed and your head leaned against rain spattered glass. Unless, of course, you were confident that retracing your steps to venture back wouldn\u2019t reignite what brought you here in the first place. Perhaps then, you would be cooled enough to seek each other\u2019s company, as your heart so longed to do, even now.\nEven so, the distant rumbling grew louder with each page you turned. Rain crackled into the glass as the wind whipped past. The more you read, the pages became even more brown and stiff as they slowly shared with you their age.\nThe storm, once far out of your sight, seemed to be right on top of you now as it unleashed its fury hard and strong and fast as it battered itself again and again and\nagain\nagainst the city below, and punished the castle walls themselves.\nIt was because of this, that every sound coming from within was, of course, as good as silent.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d find you here.\u201d\nHis voice filled what little lull a storm of this magnitude could give. It slid over your skin, soft as silk, slipped in through the little cracks along with the rain and wind and thunder alike.\nPrince Aemond stood in the glow of torchlight, illuminated wholly in the warm caress of flickering flame. He remained some distance from you, mindful of the space you held both for yourself, and, more pressingly - the distance you created when he pushed you oh, so splendidly away earlier that evening.\n\u201cWell,\u201d your eyes slid away from the prince, to instead find the paragraph they had been pulled away from. Your next words were spoken idly, if not with remnants of\nferocity\ncoating them as you resumed reading. \u201cYou\ndo\nknow where I like to hide.\u201d\nAemond shifts his weight - it\u2019s caught out the corner of your eye - and a shadow promptly slips across you to blanket the words on the pages. It was, by design, a darkness you weren\u2019t able to see through, not with the storm outside batting aside the sun\u2019s dying rays with its gray clouds and veils of rain.\nIntentional\n.\n\u201cSo you\nare\nhiding from me.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018\nHide\n\u2019 is not the word I would use.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThe book snapped shut in your hands on a sigh dragged from the weary depths of your heart. They were both, unfortunately, swallowed by another rolling volley of thunder. The timing was so dramatic, so absolutely\nyou\n, that it wasn\u2019t Aemond\u2019s fault when it inspired a harsh roll of his eye.\nHe could be dramatic too, if only to distract you from the way his lips quirked, the flash of a smile threatening to show itself in the darkness, or in the shine of the firelight still kissing fragments of his skin. Aemond knew this wasn\u2019t the time for jokes, yet even he could appreciate the irony of the trap\nhe\nlaid, and, quite gracefully, stepped right into.\nLightning forked through the sky on another crash of thunder, the flash cold in contrast to the warmth of the library. It was jarring, how the harsh, white light exposed everything, always, quickly and quietly before it melted back into the safety of blowing rain and raging waves.\nAnd yet, it was enough. Enough to see the tension weaving its way through Prince Aemond\u2019s jaw, and the set of his shoulders. How he hid his hands behind his back, no doubt clasped and curled in an unbreakable grip. Aemond clearly found no comfort here tonight. He held himself wound tight - even more so, almost, than he did when all the eyes watched him while at court.\nYou, on the other hand, were relaxed, given the circumstances. Lounging comfortably in the window seat while allowing the peace and the stillness to wash over you in the place you felt safest in all of King\u2019s Landing.\nGuilt\n, you realized, still sitting in his shadow.\nThis was what his guilt looked like.\nYou had wondered if Aemond could even feel such a thing.\n\u201cNo,\u201d you answered his question slowly. Let the bite fade from your voice and fall into the storm. Let it melt back into nothing. \u201cI believe I would choose \u2018\nisolate\n\u2019. I assumed neither one of us wanted that conversation to continue while clawing at each other\u2019s throats, as we were.\u201d\nAemond took a breath, inhaled loud and sharp in time with a sheet of rain being pushed against the windowpane. He looked away as you watched him, your feet uncurling from their place on the seat, the volume slipping through your fingers to rest beside you.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d\nYou stepped from the shadows and went to him, still hiding in the safety of the dark. He longed to reach for you, longed to feel your skin, warm from the fire, warm from the peace you always seemed to carve for yourself - but his fingertips were cold from the time he spent solitary in your rooms after you had gone. The fires burned to ashes as he tempered himself, once again, into honed steel that the prince sheathed - if only so he could see you again, without drawing blood once more. Now that he found you, he feared you would find only ice under his touch, instead of comfort.\nIt made his heart\nache\n.\nAnd\nyou\n-\nAemond shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, when he found his fingers threaded through yours.

He could see in you, just how much you could read him, even when he said so little.

The corners of your lips quirked, the prelude of a small smile illuminating the shadows Aemond still hid in. \u201cLet\u2019s go brew some tea and\u2026maybe we can talk.\u201d\nHis head dips in agreement, oddly silent since he last spoke. It was almost as if\u2026as if he wasn\u2019t sure the words that wanted to spill out would be the right ones.\nKind\nones. Instead, his chilled fingers finally curled gently around your own.\nAll he can bring himself to say is, \u201cLead on, darling.\u201d\nSo you do, leading him through gloomy shadows deepened by the storm, to hallways illuminated by torches, by lightning, by\nyou\n.",

For most of his life, he\u2019d expected to be a working royal, technically Erik\u2019s heir until such time as Erik had children of his own, so unlikely to ever have to actually take the throne. Then when Erik died, Wilhelm had known that his destiny lay somewhere else entirely, that he was to take the throne in Erik\u2019s place. Now he\u2019s made the choice to be honest with his family, to say that he doesn\u2019t want to be Crown Prince any more, that he\u2019s chosen Simon, he no longer knows what lies in store.\nHe doesn\u2019t know where he\u2019s going to be going to school for the next academic year; while he knows that Hillerska\u2019s closure is being appealed, he\u2019s not sure how successful that\u2019s going to be. Yes, everyone involved in the initiation will have gone, yes, the school will be under new management, but will that be enough for the appeal to be successful? Wilhelm knows that if the attempt to appeal the closure does fail, his parents could always choose to send him back to his old school from before he started Hillerska, or find somewhere else altogether, but he\u2019s not sure whether he would want that now, to be at a school without Simon, Felice and Sara.\nAugust\u2019s called, thanking Wilhelm for speaking to his parents about making him the heir to the Swedish throne. Wilhelm\u2019s not sure how their relationship will be in the future; although they are family, until recently they had never been friends, and there\u2019s still enough water under the bridge that he\u2019s not sure how easy it will be for them ever to really be close. At one point, he hadn\u2019t thought he could forgive August for the sex tape, and more recently August\u2019s shattering of Wilhelm\u2019s illusions about Erik by revealing Erik\u2019s role in the initiation had driven a wedge between them; yet a part of Wilhelm actually thinks he wouldn\u2019t mind now talking about Erik with August, since August had reassured Wilhelm that Erik would have loved him. They\u2019ll still see each other again as cousins; after all this time of disliking August, Wilhelm considers the idea that they could become something closer to friends.\nWilhelm\u2019s never thought about the idea of a career. Why would he? Until now, he\u2019d never expected to have any choice in the matter; whether as Crown Prince or another working royal, heir to Erik, the choice had already been set in stone for Wilhelm. For Simon and Sara and Felice, Rosh and Ayub, even August\u2019s friends, futures not fixed in the same way, they had always expected to have some kind of career; Wilhelm knew Simon had wanted a career in music, although he had never been sure that it would actually happen. If he\u2019s honest with himself, he has to admit that he\u2019ll never truly leave the public eye; even though he has taken the step back from the throne, he\u2019s still well enough known that he\u2019ll always be recognised as a member of the royal family, never able to blend into the background and live a truly normal life in the way that his friends can. Will anyone even take him seriously when he does apply for a job, or will they decide that the downsides of the media attention outweigh the benefits of hiring him, or think he\u2019s just playing at being a regular person before going back to the Bank of Mama and Papa, back to the royal family? They would have no worries on that score; Wilhelm knows he doesn\u2019t want to go back to that life, was never really happy even as he went through the motions of the public appearances. And once the news is officially out there that he has abdicated as Crown Prince, Wilhelm knows that in the short term at least, he\u2019ll be getting lots of media attention as Sweden processes the news (he\u2019s already thought that he\u2019d better suggest to Simon that he avoids looking at social media for at least the first few weeks, to avoid the comments from idiots.) Although August did say when they spoke that hopefully, as new Crown Prince, he\u2019ll be able to turn at least some of the media focus to himself, take it off Wilhelm and Simon.\nBut a lot of this is either out of his hands anyway (the future of the school), or things that Wilhelm can take time to make a decision about rather than having to commit to anything straight away (any future career); Wilhelm doesn\u2019t know what the future holds for him, but maybe right now he doesn\u2019t need to.

Now he\u2019s made the choice to be honest with his family, to say that he doesn\u2019t want to be Crown Prince any more, that he\u2019s chosen Simon, he no longer knows what lies in store.\nHe doesn\u2019t know where he\u2019s going to be going to school for the next academic year; while he knows that Hillerska\u2019s closure is being appealed, he\u2019s not sure how successful that\u2019s going to be. Yes, everyone involved in the initiation will have gone, yes, the school will be under new management, but will that be enough for the appeal to be successful? Wilhelm knows that if the attempt to appeal the closure does fail, his parents could always choose to send him back to his old school from before he started Hillerska, or find somewhere else altogether, but he\u2019s not sure whether he would want that now, to be at a school without Simon, Felice and Sara.\nAugust\u2019s called, thanking Wilhelm for speaking to his parents about making him the heir to the Swedish throne. Wilhelm\u2019s not sure how their relationship will be in the future; although they are family, until recently they had never been friends, and there\u2019s still enough water under the bridge that he\u2019s not sure how easy it will be for them ever to really be close. At one point, he hadn\u2019t thought he could forgive August for the sex tape, and more recently August\u2019s shattering of Wilhelm\u2019s illusions about Erik by revealing Erik\u2019s role in the initiation had driven a wedge between them; yet a part of Wilhelm actually thinks he wouldn\u2019t mind now talking about Erik with August, since August had reassured Wilhelm that Erik would have loved him. They\u2019ll still see each other again as cousins; after all this time of disliking August, Wilhelm considers the idea that they could become something closer to friends.\nWilhelm\u2019s never thought about the idea of a career. Why would he? Until now, he\u2019d never expected to have any choice in the matter; whether as Crown Prince or another working royal, heir to Erik, the choice had already been set in stone for Wilhelm. For Simon and Sara and Felice, Rosh and Ayub, even August\u2019s friends, futures not fixed in the same way, they had always expected to have some kind of career; Wilhelm knew Simon had wanted a career in music, although he had never been sure that it would actually happen. If he\u2019s honest with himself, he has to admit that he\u2019ll never truly leave the public eye; even though he has taken the step back from the throne, he\u2019s still well enough known that he\u2019ll always be recognised as a member of the royal family, never able to blend into the background and live a truly normal life in the way that his friends can. Will anyone even take him seriously when he does apply for a job, or will they decide that the downsides of the media attention outweigh the benefits of hiring him, or think he\u2019s just playing at being a regular person before going back to the Bank of Mama and Papa, back to the royal family? They would have no worries on that score; Wilhelm knows he doesn\u2019t want to go back to that life, was never really happy even as he went through the motions of the public appearances. And once the news is officially out there that he has abdicated as Crown Prince, Wilhelm knows that in the short term at least, he\u2019ll be getting lots of media attention as Sweden processes the news (he\u2019s already thought that he\u2019d better suggest to Simon that he avoids looking at social media for at least the first few weeks, to avoid the comments from idiots.) Although August did say when they spoke that hopefully, as new Crown Prince, he\u2019ll be able to turn at least some of the media focus to himself, take it off Wilhelm and Simon.\nBut a lot of this is either out of his hands anyway (the future of the school), or things that Wilhelm can take time to make a decision about rather than having to commit to anything straight away (any future career); Wilhelm doesn\u2019t know what the future holds for him, but maybe right now he doesn\u2019t need to. He can enjoy this summer with his friends, with Simon.",

It is the Lord's work that we do, and have the courage to do. And difficult as the path may be, at the end of it lies the redemption of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\" The rhythm of the conversation was familiar to both men. It was the master's role to doubt, and the priest's duty to reassure. \"Thanks be to God.\" Master Galien turned and met the priest's eyes. \"I will send my summons. After supper.

They were to proceed to the Master's council room immediately after supper, for reasons that Bertrand did not explain, or appear to know. Some of them were not terribly bothered. Three pilgrims currently occupied the lodgings set aside for that purpose; likely they had concluded their penances and required an escort back to the main road.

Could it be that they had been found out? The Gospel reading at supper, delivered as always by Brother Tancred, was recognizable to the educated among them as the temptation of Jesus in the desert and the calling of the Apostle Peter.

Each chest bore the privileged device to which none of them were entitled: a lock. None of \"them\"? It appeared that the summons given to each man had gone to others as well.

        "story": "Winter, and I walked the sidewalk at night along banks of hard snow. I\u2019d just come from Rab\u2019s apartment off the reservation. Rab\u2014this white guy with a wide mouth and eyes that closed up when he laughed\u2014sold pot. He was smart too\u2014I had asked for a gram, and after he weighed it and put it in a plastic baggie, he didn\u2019t believe me when I reached into my pants and jacket pockets looking for the cash among the cigarette wrappers and pocketknife, and when I acted the part and kept saying, \u201cShit shit shit, it must\u2019ve fell out on the walk over here,\u201d he shook his head, took the weed out of the baggie, and put it back into his Mason jar. \u201cI ain\u2019t smokin\u2019 you up,\u201d he said, and so then I said, \u201cFuck you, Rab, I really did lose the money, you\u2019ll see, watch when I come back here in thirty minutes with the money I dropped, you\u2019ll feel stupid then.\u201d He shrugged a Sorry, man, and I slammed his door shut as I left.\nAt the bridge to the reservation, the river was still frozen, ice shining white-blue under a full moon. The sidewalk on the bridge hadn\u2019t been shoveled since the last nor\u2019easter crapped snow in November, and I walked in the boot prints everyone made who walked the walk to Overtown to get pot or catch the bus to wherever it was us Indians had to go, which really wasn\u2019t anywhere because everything we needed\u2014except pot\u2014was on the rez. Well, except the grocery store or Best Buy or Bed Bath & Beyond, but those natives who bought 4K Ultra DVDs or fresh white doilies had cars, wouldn\u2019t be taking the bus like me or Fellis did each day to the methadone clinic. That was another thing the rez didn\u2019t have: a methadone clinic. But we had sacred grounds where sweats and peyote ceremonies happened once a month, except since I had chosen to take methadone, I was ineligible to participate in native spiritual practice, according to the doc on the rez.\nNatives damning natives.\nThe roads on the rez were quiet, trees bending under the weight of snow, and when I passed the frozen swamp a voice moaned out. I stopped walking. Nothing, so I kept on going on the sparkly road until I heard it again.\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d I yelled. The moan came again. It was a man, somewhere in the swamp. I got closer, listening. There it was: low and breathy, and I followed after the noise.\nThe swamp was frozen solid, the snow blown in piles, and so I slid over the ice, looking for the source of the noise. Moonlight through bare tree limbs lit the swamp, and caught there among the tree stumps and solid snow was a person sprawled out on the ground. He was trying to sit up but kept falling back, like he\u2019d just done one thousand crunches and was too sore to do just one more.\nI got close, stood over him. It was Fellis.\n\u201cFellis,\u201d I said. \u201cIs that you?\u201d\nFellis tried to sit up, but something pulled him back down. \u201cFuck you,\u201d he said. \u201cHelp me.\u201d He groaned, shivered.\nHe didn\u2019t say how to help him, so I had to squat down and look at him. I flicked my lighter and his purple lip quivered.\n\u201cHurry,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFellis,\u201d I said. I stood up. \u201cI can\u2019t help you if I don\u2019t know what\u2019s a matter with you.\u201d\n\u201cMy hair,\u201d he said.\nI crouched back down and looked at his hair. \u201cHoly,\u201d I said, and I laughed. He kept his hair braided all the time, but it was undone, his long black hair frozen into the snow.\n\u201cGet me out, Dee,\u201d he said. \u201cDee, get me out.\u201d\nAt first I tried to pull the hair out from the snow, tried to chip the snow away, but his hair wouldn\u2019t come loose. And then I yanked real hard, and Fellis screamed.\n\u201cLift your head up,\u201d I said. I opened my pocketknife, grabbed his hair in a fistful, and cut. When I got through the last bit of hair, Fellis rolled over and away from where he\u2019d been stuck. He rubbed his head like he just woke up.\nI helped him stand, and we slipped all over the ice on our way out of the swamp. Through dry heaves, Fellis said he missed the bus this morning to the methadone clinic\u2014\u201cNo shit,\u201d I said, because I didn\u2019t see him there\u2014and he thought some booze would be good before he got sick from not having any methadone. He had just a bit of booze left when he decided to go see Rab to get some pot, and on the way he stopped off in the swamp to feel the quiet that came with too much drinking, and when he plopped down in the snow he dozed right off. When he woke up, his hair was frozen in the snow.\nI got him to his mom\u2019s, where he lived.

He fumbled in his pocket for his house key.\n\u201cYou wanna smoke?\u201d I said.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you listen? I didn\u2019t make it to Rab\u2019s.\u201d He unlocked the door.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go for you,\u201d I said. \u201cGive me the cash.\u201d\nFellis looked at me.\n\u201cTwenty minutes,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll run there and back while you warm up your pretty bald head.\u201d\nHe gave me thirty bucks, and I didn\u2019t ask where he got it from. Yesterday he said he didn\u2019t have any money.\n\u201cTwenty bag,\u201d Fellis said. \u201cAnd stop at Jim\u2019s and get some tall boys and a bag of chips. Any kind but Humpty Dumpty chips. Too damn salty, and my stomach hurts.\u201d\nDown Fellis\u2019s driveway I thought about the look on Rab\u2019s face when he saw I had the money. What I tell you? How about that gram?\n\u201cDee!\u201d Fellis yelled. \u201cBring me my hair, so we can burn it! Don\u2019t want spirits after us.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re damned anyway,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I guess I\u2019ll get your hair.\u201d\nI kept going, wondering, Hair or pot first? Pot made the most sense. It would look strange having to set the hair and ice down like a soaked mop on the counter at Jim\u2019s while I reached in my pocket for Fellis\u2019s money. Jim\u2014that old wood booger\u2014would say, \u201cWe don\u2019t take those anymore.\u201d I\u2019d look him square in his sagging face and say,\u201cI ain\u2019t trading no hair, you old fucker,\u201d and I\u2019d smack down on the counter a ten-dollar bill for the tall boys and chips. With the change jingling in my pocket, I\u2019d walk to Rab\u2019s and he\u2019d say, \u201cGet that hair out of here, it\u2019s dripping on my floor,\u201dand I\u2019d have to plop the hair on the muddy white floor in the hallway while Rab reweighed the same nugs he weighed earlier for me.\nNo\u2014I\u2019d grab Fellis\u2019s hair from the swamp on my way home. With Fellis on his unmade bed, me on a torn beanbag in the corner, each of us with a tall boy and the pot smoke hazing gray the room, we\u2019d keep poking and squeezing the hair, waiting for it to dry, waiting to burn it.",

        "story": "Winter, and I walked the sidewalk at night along banks of hard snow. I\u2019d just come from Rab\u2019s apartment off the reservation. Rab\u2014this white guy with a wide mouth and eyes that closed up when he laughed\u2014sold pot. He was smart too\u2014I had asked for a gram, and after he weighed it and put it in a plastic baggie, he didn\u2019t believe me when I reached into my pants and jacket pockets looking for the cash among the cigarette wrappers and pocketknife, and when I acted the part and kept saying, \u201cShit shit shit, it must\u2019ve fell out on the walk over here,\u201d he shook his head, took the weed out of the baggie, and put it back into his Mason jar. \u201cI ain\u2019t smokin\u2019 you up,\u201d he said, and so then I said, \u201cFuck you, Rab, I really did lose the money, you\u2019ll see, watch when I come back here in thirty minutes with the money I dropped, you\u2019ll feel stupid then.\u201d He shrugged a Sorry, man, and I slammed his door shut as I left.\nAt the bridge to the reservation, the river was still frozen, ice shining white-blue under a full moon. The sidewalk on the bridge hadn\u2019t been shoveled since the last nor\u2019easter crapped snow in November, and I walked in the boot prints everyone made who walked the walk to Overtown to get pot or catch the bus to wherever it was us Indians had to go, which really wasn\u2019t anywhere because everything we needed\u2014except pot\u2014was on the rez. Well, except the grocery store or Best Buy or Bed Bath & Beyond, but those natives who bought 4K Ultra DVDs or fresh white doilies had cars, wouldn\u2019t be taking the bus like me or Fellis did each day to the methadone clinic. That was another thing the rez didn\u2019t have: a methadone clinic. But we had sacred grounds where sweats and peyote ceremonies happened once a month, except since I had chosen to take methadone, I was ineligible to participate in native spiritual practice, according to the doc on the rez.\nNatives damning natives.\nThe roads on the rez were quiet, trees bending under the weight of snow, and when I passed the frozen swamp a voice moaned out. I stopped walking. Nothing, so I kept on going on the sparkly road until I heard it again.\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d I yelled. The moan came again. It was a man, somewhere in the swamp. I got closer, listening. There it was: low and breathy, and I followed after the noise.\nThe swamp was frozen solid, the snow blown in piles, and so I slid over the ice, looking for the source of the noise. Moonlight through bare tree limbs lit the swamp, and caught there among the tree stumps and solid snow was a person sprawled out on the ground. He was trying to sit up but kept falling back, like he\u2019d just done one thousand crunches and was too sore to do just one more.\nI got close, stood over him. It was Fellis.\n\u201cFellis,\u201d I said. \u201cIs that you?\u201d\nFellis tried to sit up, but something pulled him back down. \u201cFuck you,\u201d he said. \u201cHelp me.\u201d He groaned, shivered.\nHe didn\u2019t say how to help him, so I had to squat down and look at him. I flicked my lighter and his purple lip quivered.\n\u201cHurry,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFellis,\u201d I said. I stood up. \u201cI can\u2019t help you if I don\u2019t know what\u2019s a matter with you.\u201d\n\u201cMy hair,\u201d he said.\nI crouched back down and looked at his hair. \u201cHoly,\u201d I said, and I laughed. He kept his hair braided all the time, but it was undone, his long black hair frozen into the snow.\n\u201cGet me out, Dee,\u201d he said. \u201cDee, get me out.\u201d\nAt first I tried to pull the hair out from the snow, tried to chip the snow away, but his hair wouldn\u2019t come loose. And then I yanked real hard, and Fellis screamed.\n\u201cLift your head up,\u201d I said. I opened my pocketknife, grabbed his hair in a fistful, and cut. When I got through the last bit of hair, Fellis rolled over and away from where he\u2019d been stuck. He rubbed his head like he just woke up.\nI helped him stand, and we slipped all over the ice on our way out of the swamp. Through dry heaves, Fellis said he missed the bus this morning to the methadone clinic\u2014\u201cNo shit,\u201d I said, because I didn\u2019t see him there\u2014and he thought some booze would be good before he got sick from not having any methadone. He had just a bit of booze left when he decided to go see Rab to get some pot, and on the way he stopped off in the swamp to feel the quiet that came with too much drinking, and when he plopped down in the snow he dozed right off. When he woke up, his hair was frozen in the snow.\nI got him to his mom\u2019s, where he lived. He walked fine by himself to the door, but I walked with him up the steps.\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d scalp a fellow tribal member,\u201d I said.\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d he said.

Yesterday he said he didn\u2019t have any money.\n\u201cTwenty bag,\u201d Fellis said. \u201cAnd stop at Jim\u2019s and get some tall boys and a bag of chips. Any kind but Humpty Dumpty chips. Too damn salty, and my stomach hurts.\u201d\nDown Fellis\u2019s driveway I thought about the look on Rab\u2019s face when he saw I had the money. What I tell you? How about that gram?\n\u201cDee!\u201d Fellis yelled. \u201cBring me my hair, so we can burn it! Don\u2019t want spirits after us.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re damned anyway,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I guess I\u2019ll get your hair.\u201d\nI kept going, wondering, Hair or pot first? Pot made the most sense. It would look strange having to set the hair and ice down like a soaked mop on the counter at Jim\u2019s while I reached in my pocket for Fellis\u2019s money. Jim\u2014that old wood booger\u2014would say, \u201cWe don\u2019t take those anymore.\u201d I\u2019d look him square in his sagging face and say,\u201cI ain\u2019t trading no hair, you old fucker,\u201d and I\u2019d smack down on the counter a ten-dollar bill for the tall boys and chips. With the change jingling in my pocket, I\u2019d walk to Rab\u2019s and he\u2019d say, \u201cGet that hair out of here, it\u2019s dripping on my floor,\u201dand I\u2019d have to plop the hair on the muddy white floor in the hallway while Rab reweighed the same nugs he weighed earlier for me.\nNo\u2014I\u2019d grab Fellis\u2019s hair from the swamp on my way home. With Fellis on his unmade bed, me on a torn beanbag in the corner, each of us with a tall boy and the pot smoke hazing gray the room, we\u2019d keep poking and squeezing the hair, waiting for it to dry, waiting to burn it.",
        "claim": "The author structures the plot around a journey that intertwines personal and cultural elements.",
        "evidence": "In the story regarding \"a frozen swamp rescue and ceremonial burning,\" the protagonist's journey involves not only rescuing Fellis but also navigating the socio-cultural landscape of the reservation."

        "writing_prompt": "In a world where people can split themselves into two younger versions at any point in their lives, one woman refuses to split, defying societal norms. What happens when her choice begins to unravel the delicate balance of this strange society?",
        "story": "The first story Maya wrote was about a world in which people split themselves in two instead of reproducing. In that world, every person could, at any given moment, turn into two beings, each one half his/her age. Some chose to do this when they were young; for instance, an eighteen-year-old might split into two nine-year-olds. Others would wait until they\u2019d established themselves professionally and financially and go for it only in middle age. The heroine of Maya\u2019s story was splitless. She had reached the age of eighty and, despite constant social pressure, insisted on not splitting. At the end of the story, she died.\nIt was a good story, except for the ending. There was something depressing about that part, Aviad thought. Depressing and predictable. But Maya, in the writing workshop she had signed up for, actually got a lot of compliments on the ending. The instructor, who was supposed to be this well-known writer, even though Aviad had never heard of him, told her that there was something soul-piercing about the banality of the ending, or some other piece of crap. Aviad saw how happy that compliment made Maya. She was very excited when she told him about it. She recited what the writer had said to her the way people recite a verse from the Bible. And Aviad, who had originally tried to suggest a different ending, backpedalled and said that it was all a matter of taste and that he really didn\u2019t understand much about it.\nIt had been her mother\u2019s idea that she should go to a creative-writing workshop. She\u2019d said that a friend\u2019s daughter had attended one and enjoyed it very much. Aviad also thought that it would be good for Maya to get out more, to do something with herself. He could always bury himself in work, but, since the miscarriage, she never left the house. Whenever he came home, he found her in the living room, sitting up straight on the couch. Not reading, not watching TV, not even crying. When Maya hesitated about the course, Aviad knew how to persuade her. \u201cGo once, give it a try,\u201d he said, \u201cthe way a kid goes to day camp.\u201d Later, he realized that it had been a little insensitive of him to use a child as an example, after what they\u2019d been through two months before. But Maya actually smiled and said that day camp might be just what she needed.\nThe second story she wrote was about a world in which you could see only the people you loved. The protagonist was a married man in love with his wife. One day, his wife walked right into him in the hallway and the glass he was holding fell and shattered on the floor. A few days later, she sat down on him as he was dozing in an armchair. Both times, she wriggled out of it with an excuse: she\u2019d had something else on her mind; she hadn\u2019t been looking when she sat down. But the husband started to suspect that she didn\u2019t love him anymore. To test his theory, he decided to do something drastic: he shaved off the left side of his mustache. He came home with half a mustache, clutching a bouquet of anemones. His wife thanked him for the flowers and smiled. He could sense her groping the air as she tried to give him a kiss. Maya called the story \u201cHalf a Mustache,\u201d and told Aviad that when she\u2019d read it aloud in the workshop some people had cried. Aviad said, \u201cWow,\u201d and kissed her on the forehead. That night, they fought about some stupid little thing. She\u2019d forgotten to pass on a message or something like that, and he yelled at her. He was to blame, and in the end he apologized. \u201cI had a hellish day at work,\u201d he said and stroked her leg, trying to make up for his outburst. \u201cDo you forgive me?\u201d She forgave him.\nThe workshop instructor had published a novel and a collection of short stories. Neither had been much of a success, but they\u2019d had a few good reviews. At least, that\u2019s what the saleswoman at a bookstore near Aviad\u2019s office told him. The novel was very thick, six hundred and twenty-four pages. Aviad bought the book of short stories. He kept it in his desk and tried to read a little during lunch breaks. Each story in the collection took place in a different foreign country. It was a kind of gimmick. The blurb on the back cover said that the writer had worked for years as a tour guide in Cuba and Africa and that his travels had influenced his writing. There was also a small black-and-white photograph of him. In it, he had the kind of smug smile of someone who feels lucky to be who he is. The writer had told Maya, she said to Aviad, that when the workshop was over he\u2019d send her stories to his editor. And, although she shouldn\u2019t get her hopes up, publishers these days were desperate for new talent.\nHer third story started out funny. It was about a woman who gave birth to a cat. The hero of the story was the husband, who suspected that the cat wasn\u2019t his. A fat ginger tomcat that slept on the lid of the dumpster right below the window of the couple\u2019s bedroom gave the husband a condescending look every time he went downstairs to throw out the garbage. In the end, there was a violent clash between the husband and the cat. The husband threw a stone at the cat, which countered with bites and scratches. The injured husband, his wife, and the kitten she was breastfeeding went to the clinic for him to get a rabies shot. He was humiliated and in pain but tried not to cry while they were waiting. The kitten, sensing his suffering, uncurled itself from its mother\u2019s embrace, went over to him, and licked his face tenderly, offering a consoling \u201cMeow.\u201d \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d the mother asked emotionally. \u201cHe said \u2018Daddy.\u2019 \u201d At that point, the husband could no longer hold back his tears. And, when Aviad read that passage, he had to try hard not to cry, too. Maya said that she\u2019d started writing the story even before she knew she was pregnant again. \u201cIsn\u2019t it weird,\u201d she asked, \u201chow my brain didn\u2019t know yet, but my subconscious did?\u201d\nA Family Reckons with a Father\u2019s Wish to Be Preserved Using Cryonics in \u201cEternal Father\u201d\nThe next Tuesday, when Aviad was supposed to pick her up after the workshop, he arrived half an hour early, parked his car in the lot, and went to find her. Maya was surprised to see him in the classroom, and he insisted that she introduce him to the writer. The writer reeked of body lotion. He shook Aviad\u2019s hand limply and told him that if Maya had chosen him for a husband he must be a very special person.\nThree weeks later, Aviad signed up for a beginners\u2019 creative-writing class. He didn\u2019t say anything about it to Maya, and, to be on the safe side, he told his secretary that if he had any calls from home she should say that he was in an important meeting and couldn\u2019t be disturbed. The other members of the class were mostly elderly women, who gave him dirty looks. The thin young instructor wore a head scarf, and the women in the class gossiped about her, saying that she lived in a settlement in the occupied territories and had cancer. She asked everyone to do an exercise in automatic writing. \u201cWrite whatever comes into your head,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t think, just write.\u201d Aviad tried to stop thinking. It was very hard. The old women around him wrote with nervous speed, like students racing to finish an exam before the teacher tells them to put their pens down, and after a few minutes he began writing, too.\nThe story he wrote was about a fish that was swimming happily along in the sea when a wicked witch turned it into a man. The fish couldn\u2019t come to terms with his transformation and decided to chase down the wicked witch and make her turn him back into a fish. Since he was an especially quick and enterprising fish, he managed to get married while he was pursuing her, and even to establish a small company that imported plastic products from the Far East. With the help of the enormous knowledge he had gained as a fish who had crossed the seven seas, the company began to thrive and even went public. Meanwhile, the wicked witch, who was a little tired after all her years of wickedness, decided to find all the people and creatures she\u2019d cast spells on, apologize to them, and restore them to their natural state. At one point, she even went to see the fish she had turned into a man. The fish\u2019s secretary asked her to wait until he\u2019d finished a satellite meeting with his partners in Taiwan. At that stage in his life, the fish could hardly remember that he was in fact a fish, and his company now controlled half the world. The witch waited several hours, but when she saw that the meeting wouldn\u2019t be ending any time soon she climbed onto her broom and flew off. The fish kept doing better and better, until one day, when he was really old, he looked out the window of one of the dozens of huge shoreline buildings he\u2019d purchased in a smart real-estate deal, and saw the sea. And suddenly he remembered that he was a fish. A very rich fish who controlled many subsidiary companies that were traded on stock markets around the world, but still a fish. A fish who, for years, had not tasted the salt of the sea.\nWhen the instructor saw that Aviad had put down his pen, she gave him an inquiring look. \u201cI don\u2019t have an ending,\u201d he whispered apologetically, keeping his voice down so as not to disturb the old ladies who were still writing. \u2666",

Maya said that she\u2019d started writing the story even before she knew she was pregnant again. \u201cIsn\u2019t it weird,\u201d she asked, \u201chow my brain didn\u2019t know yet, but my subconscious did?\u201d\nA Family Reckons with a Father\u2019s Wish to Be Preserved Using Cryonics in \u201cEternal Father\u201d\nThe next Tuesday, when Aviad was supposed to pick her up after the workshop, he arrived half an hour early, parked his car in the lot, and went to find her. Maya was surprised to see him in the classroom, and he insisted that she introduce him to the writer. The writer reeked of body lotion. He shook Aviad\u2019s hand limply and told him that if Maya had chosen him for a husband he must be a very special person.\nThree weeks later, Aviad signed up for a beginners\u2019 creative-writing class. He didn\u2019t say anything about it to Maya, and, to be on the safe side, he told his secretary that if he had any calls from home she should say that he was in an important meeting and couldn\u2019t be disturbed. The other members of the class were mostly elderly women, who gave him dirty looks. The thin young instructor wore a head scarf, and the women in the class gossiped about her, saying that she lived in a settlement in the occupied territories and had cancer. She asked everyone to do an exercise in automatic writing. \u201cWrite whatever comes into your head,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t think, just write.\u201d Aviad tried to stop thinking. It was very hard. The old women around him wrote with nervous speed, like students racing to finish an exam before the teacher tells them to put their pens down, and after a few minutes he began writing, too.\nThe story he wrote was about a fish that was swimming happily along in the sea when a wicked witch turned it into a man. The fish couldn\u2019t come to terms with his transformation and decided to chase down the wicked witch and make her turn him back into a fish. Since he was an especially quick and enterprising fish, he managed to get married while he was pursuing her, and even to establish a small company that imported plastic products from the Far East. With the help of the enormous knowledge he had gained as a fish who had crossed the seven seas, the company began to thrive and even went public. Meanwhile, the wicked witch, who was a little tired after all her years of wickedness, decided to find all the people and creatures she\u2019d cast spells on, apologize to them, and restore them to their natural state. At one point, she even went to see the fish she had turned into a man. The fish\u2019s secretary asked her to wait until he\u2019d finished a satellite meeting with his partners in Taiwan. At that stage in his life, the fish could hardly remember that he was in fact a fish, and his company now controlled half the world. The witch waited several hours, but when she saw that the meeting wouldn\u2019t be ending any time soon she climbed onto her broom and flew off. The fish kept doing better and better, until one day, when he was really old, he looked out the window of one of the dozens of huge shoreline buildings he\u2019d purchased in a smart real-estate deal, and saw the sea. And suddenly he remembered that he was a fish. A very rich fish who controlled many subsidiary companies that were traded on stock markets around the world, but still a fish. A fish who, for years, had not tasted the salt of the sea.\nWhen the instructor saw that Aviad had put down his pen, she gave him an inquiring look. \u201cI don\u2019t have an ending,\u201d he whispered apologetically, keeping his voice down so as not to disturb the old ladies who were still writing. \u2666",

        "writing_prompt": "In a world where people can split themselves into two younger versions at any point in their lives, one woman refuses to split, defying societal norms. What happens when her choice begins to unravel the delicate balance of this strange society?",
        "story": "The first story Maya wrote was about a world in which people split themselves in two instead of reproducing. In that world, every person could, at any given moment, turn into two beings, each one half his/her age. Some chose to do this when they were young; for instance, an eighteen-year-old might split into two nine-year-olds. Others would wait until they\u2019d established themselves professionally and financially and go for it only in middle age. The heroine of Maya\u2019s story was splitless. She had reached the age of eighty and, despite constant social pressure, insisted on not splitting. At the end of the story, she died.\nIt was a good story, except for the ending. There was something depressing about that part, Aviad thought. Depressing and predictable. But Maya, in the writing workshop she had signed up for, actually got a lot of compliments on the ending. The instructor, who was supposed to be this well-known writer, even though Aviad had never heard of him, told her that there was something soul-piercing about the banality of the ending, or some other piece of crap. Aviad saw how happy that compliment made Maya. She was very excited when she told him about it. She recited what the writer had said to her the way people recite a verse from the Bible. And Aviad, who had originally tried to suggest a different ending, backpedalled and said that it was all a matter of taste and that he really didn\u2019t understand much about it.\nIt had been her mother\u2019s idea that she should go to a creative-writing workshop. She\u2019d said that a friend\u2019s daughter had attended one and enjoyed it very much. Aviad also thought that it would be good for Maya to get out more, to do something with herself. He could always bury himself in work, but, since the miscarriage, she never left the house. Whenever he came home, he found her in the living room, sitting up straight on the couch. Not reading, not watching TV, not even crying. When Maya hesitated about the course, Aviad knew how to persuade her. \u201cGo once, give it a try,\u201d he said, \u201cthe way a kid goes to day camp.\u201d Later, he realized that it had been a little insensitive of him to use a child as an example, after what they\u2019d been through two months before. But Maya actually smiled and said that day camp might be just what she needed.\nThe second story she wrote was about a world in which you could see only the people you loved. The protagonist was a married man in love with his wife. One day, his wife walked right into him in the hallway and the glass he was holding fell and shattered on the floor. A few days later, she sat down on him as he was dozing in an armchair. Both times, she wriggled out of it with an excuse: she\u2019d had something else on her mind; she hadn\u2019t been looking when she sat down. But the husband started to suspect that she didn\u2019t love him anymore. To test his theory, he decided to do something drastic: he shaved off the left side of his mustache. He came home with half a mustache, clutching a bouquet of anemones. His wife thanked him for the flowers and smiled. He could sense her groping the air as she tried to give him a kiss. Maya called the story \u201cHalf a Mustache,\u201d and told Aviad that when she\u2019d read it aloud in the workshop some people had cried. Aviad said, \u201cWow,\u201d and kissed her on the forehead. That night, they fought about some stupid little thing. She\u2019d forgotten to pass on a message or something like that, and he yelled at her. He was to blame, and in the end he apologized. \u201cI had a hellish day at work,\u201d he said and stroked her leg, trying to make up for his outburst. \u201cDo you forgive me?\u201d She forgave him.\nThe workshop instructor had published a novel and a collection of short stories. Neither had been much of a success, but they\u2019d had a few good reviews. At least, that\u2019s what the saleswoman at a bookstore near Aviad\u2019s office told him. The novel was very thick, six hundred and twenty-four pages. Aviad bought the book of short stories. He kept it in his desk and tried to read a little during lunch breaks. Each story in the collection took place in a different foreign country. It was a kind of gimmick. The blurb on the back cover said that the writer had worked for years as a tour guide in Cuba and Africa and that his travels had influenced his writing. There was also a small black-and-white photograph of him. In it, he had the kind of smug smile of someone who feels lucky to be who he is. The writer had told Maya, she said to Aviad, that when the workshop was over he\u2019d send her stories to his editor. And, although she shouldn\u2019t get her hopes up, publishers these days were desperate for new talent.\nHer third story started out funny. It was about a woman who gave birth to a cat. The hero of the story was the husband, who suspected that the cat wasn\u2019t his. A fat ginger tomcat that slept on the lid of the dumpster right below the window of the couple\u2019s bedroom gave the husband a condescending look every time he went downstairs to throw out the garbage. In the end, there was a violent clash between the husband and the cat. The husband threw a stone at the cat, which countered with bites and scratches. The injured husband, his wife, and the kitten she was breastfeeding went to the clinic for him to get a rabies shot. He was humiliated and in pain but tried not to cry while they were waiting. The kitten, sensing his suffering, uncurled itself from its mother\u2019s embrace, went over to him, and licked his face tenderly, offering a consoling \u201cMeow.\u201d \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d the mother asked emotionally. \u201cHe said \u2018Daddy.\u2019 \u201d At that point, the husband could no longer hold back his tears. And, when Aviad read that passage, he had to try hard not to cry, too.

Until she got a kiss from her true love her kingdom would not prosper. Now the kingdom wasn\u2019t failing by any means, but it was far from doing well. \u2018Just scraping by\u2019 as the advisors had put it. Unfortunately, \u2018just scraping by\u2019 was not enough to protect us from war. So the king and queen had called out for dam near every prince in the land to kiss her. They called for single kings and polyamorous ones. The summoned nobles from all over but still nothing. She must have been kissing a hundred men a day at one point. Her lips were chapped and her mood was lower than ever. And most of these men weren\u2019t even gracious enough to make the kiss small. A simple peck would do by the wording of the curse, but no. They had to make it a full make out session. They had to get handsy and they just had to go to far. Almost every time I would have to pull them off and send them running. The king and queen were getting so desperate they had started calling on the lower class. But I knew all this would be in vain, you see, she didn\u2019t like men. The princess was into women yet we all knew how that would end up. Enough princesses had been abandoned and rejected to tell us that revealing that secret would be a bad idea. But I couldn\u2019t watch my kingdom suffer in fear of the war to come. Other kingdoms were becoming emboldened and our allies were becoming distant. If we couldn\u2019t help them, why should they help us. It was only a matter of time, so I put out my own call. Albeit quieter than the other one. I put out a call to all the lost princesses. Together, the princess and I would sneak out of the castle every night to meet one of them. They would talk, get to know one another and if there was a spark, they would kiss. The curse had still not been lifted, but the princess\u2019 mood had already lifted. She had hope, we both did. And we were making life long friendships along the way. She was also very happy to be kissing a tonne of beautiful, respectful women instead of hideous men. But where the true love\u2019s kiss came from was a shock to us all.\nIt was another evening.

Let me bring you up to the house.\u201d Fleur stood up and held out her hand to help her up.\nHermione tried to get up but collapsed into Fleur\u2019s body due to her weakened state. \u201cBloody hell.\u201d\n\u201cI got you.\u201d Fleur swept her up into her arms and held her lightly so she wouldn\u2019t feel trapped. \u201cI am going to take you to the bedroom so you can have the comfy bed.\u201d Fleur swiftly walked into the cottage. \u201cBill, I need the med box and everyone out of the bedroom.\u201d\n\u201cGot it, Fleur.\u201d Bill ran into the kitchen to get the box and yelled, \u201cRonald, get back down here.\u201d\n\u201cBut-\u201d Ron tried to object.\n\u201cRon, Hermione needs tending to, and Fleur needs privacy in order to do it.\u201d Bill used his big brother's voice. \u201cStay down here.\u201d Bill started to go up when he noticed Luna nursing her arm. \u201cLuna, this way.\u201d\n\u201cShut it, Ron.\u201d Harry snarled when he saw him open his mouth.\nLuna scrambled up the stairs and joined the other three. \u201cYes, Bill?\u201d\n\u201cLet me look at your arm while Fleur is bandaging Hermione up.\u201d Bill patted the bed.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Luna hopped up.\nBill and Fleur worked in tandem, giving aid to the two ladies.\n\u201cAlright, Hermione, slip into bed and Luna next to her, please,\u201d Fleur spoke firmly. \u201cHermione, I want Luna with you because I have a feeling there\u2019s going to be nightmares and aftershocks ahead.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Hermione threw off the heavy covers. \u201cJust the sheet, please.\u201d Hermione tried to get comfortable as Luna slipped in on the other side.\n\u201cHermione, let me hold you. It took Dean to hold me to stop the shaking when I was in the dungeons.\u201d Luna softly encouraged her by opening her arms.\nHermione debated it for a moment but decided to see if she felt safe with her. She carefully slid into her arms. Luna held her loosely. Hermione sighed at the warm cocoon.\nFleur covered them both with a sheet before ushering her husband out. \u201cCall me if you need anything.\u201d\n\u201cI think you will know.\u201d Luna sadly whispered.\n\u201cD\u2019accord.\u201d Fleur left with the door ajar.\n\u201cTry to sleep, Hermione, while you can.\u201d Luna placed Hermione\u2019s head on her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Hermione sighed as she tried to stop twitching into a fitful sleep.\nLuna started to sing her lullaby, and she felt Hermione calm and go into a more restful sleep.

She had arrived here under her own steam to do her own little bit of detective work - and was delighted to learn that Mr Carver himself was actually here, in town, in person! She made it her business to find out where he was, so that they might compare notes. As she looked around the town, she noticed the particular characteristics of the local architecture. In the case of many buildings, low-cost homes occupied the ground floor. Above these, there was often a shop, or a business of some sort. On top of that was a level for parking. Ramps enabled the local cars to be driven up and parked; then little steps lead between the walkways on each level. Sometimes there was another home or office on the same level as the parking, depending on the size of the block and how much parking was needed. Above the parking layer was a very nice-looking home. Sometimes it was a single story apartment, other times it went up two, or even three levels. And above all of *that* was a fancy roof-garden! It was considered a status symbol to own one of those grand apartments. The rent from the shop and lower cost housing helped pay for the whole block. It gave a new meaning to the phrase property ladder! If one could afford to invest in such a block, although it was an expensive outlay at the start, it was a regular income that paid for itself over time. It *did* mean that shopping was disjointed, with one or two shops in every block. Larger dedicated shopping blocks did exist, but they were frowned upon and seen as common.

Earths contribution to the Galactic community was not as fantastic as they sometimes allowed themselves to believe. Human sneakiness sometimes gave them an edge over the wisdom or inventiveness of other species, and allowed them to circumnavigate the will of brute aggression. But of course that by no means meant that everything they did with their influence was uncompromisingly beneficial. Quite possibly why their Empire eventually fell. --- --- The Galactic Federation rose from the ashes of the Earth Empire as a way for the peoples of the Galaxy to support one another in their mutual interests, and deter aggressors. This brought new opportunities. Opportunities to tackle old problems. And even the opportunity to profit from facilitating the actions which were agreed upon. One thing looked certain. In some form or another, the Galactic Federation would form its own space navy. Andertenna was keen to lend its shipyards to the task. Ice Warriors and others were lined up to provide troops or training. And the Sigma system, lead by **Sigma19**, was anxious to provide a generous and affordable finance package. Of course each planet would have to play its part, putting up some of the wealth; but Sigma19 would underwrite the undertaking, and provide the initial cash flow; and provide certain guarantees and security to ensure the project would not flounder and nor would any individual planet find themselves in difficulty. A generous package indeed it was - but one surely they would also benefit from. Quite how was unclear. However, that was not the primary concern of our heroes. Prior to the Conference which had lead to the Galactic Navy being mooted, strange deaths had been reported on Sigma19. Reported and covered by one **James Carver** - acclaimed journalist. Unexplained deaths. Seemingly random. Cause unidentified. That much was fairly common knowledge in these parts. What was less well known is that around that time, little red flowers had been very popular. And James friends rather suspected these were related to the deaths. Indeed, they had seen the same flowers around when they had investigated deaths at the Galactic Federation conference. Now **K9** had recovered his stewardship of his TARDIS. He was relieved. For some time, Mr Wolf - a strange, unpredictable AI construct - had rather dominated the consol. He brought **James** and **Tatti** back to Sigma19. James was interested in following up on his former girlfriend, who seemed to have got involved with a criminal gang. Involved, in the sense that she had become its leader. Tatti was interested in following up on the strange deaths they had noted before. And they were all interested in ensuring the danger-hogs they had seen off previously were gone and had not caused any lasting damage. They were also curious to look into the activities of the current President, who was up for election, and seemed to be rather embroiled in intergalactic intrigue - if not directly involved in the said deaths. --- **Cass Willams** meanwhile was visiting Sigma19 for not entirely unrelated reasons. She followed the work of James Carver - and had been fascinated by what he had to say about the strange deaths on the planet. She had arrived here under her own steam to do her own little bit of detective work - and was delighted to learn that Mr Carver himself was actually here, in town, in person! She made it her business to find out where he was, so that they might compare notes. As she looked around the town, she noticed the particular characteristics of the local architecture. In the case of many buildings, low-cost homes occupied the ground floor. Above these, there was often a shop, or a business of some sort. On top of that was a level for parking. Ramps enabled the local cars to be driven up and parked; then little steps lead between the walkways on each level. Sometimes there was another home or office on the same level as the parking, depending on the size of the block and how much parking was needed. Above the parking layer was a very nice-looking home. Sometimes it was a single story apartment, other times it went up two, or even three levels. And above all of *that* was a fancy roof-garden! It was considered a status symbol to own one of those grand apartments. The rent from the shop and lower cost housing helped pay for the whole block. It gave a new meaning to the phrase property ladder! If one could afford to invest in such a block, although it was an expensive outlay at the start, it was a regular income that paid for itself over time. It *did* mean that shopping was disjointed, with one or two shops in every block. Larger dedicated shopping blocks did exist, but they were frowned upon and seen as common. And the roof gardens were a sight to behold! --- In an opulent anteroom, Kirts sat. He insisted on being called Kirts. No title, no surname or forename. Just Kirts. He was the head of the Sigma19 diplomatic party. He was not happy. Krovon Muruch, the President of Sigma19, was unpredictable. Very difficult to lead a diplomatic mission with such an unpredictable leader. And this, of course, was a lose-lose. If Muruch messed up, that was on Kirts. But if Muruch did well, Kirts could claim no glory. **Jeb Richardson** stood before him. He was a military man, but he seemed to have some spark about him. Im on the security detail for Madiba Mandela, he explained. Oh yes. Madiba Mandela. The enigmatic, calm yet magnetic Earth delegate. A member of *his* party had Kirts respect. Now the conference is over, Richardson went on, I have been commissioned to travel with you, to officially represent Earths diplomatic concern with regards to the creation of the Galactic Navy. This seemed like a good move. Earth was taking Sigma19 seriously enough to send specific staff for the embassy to deal with Sigmas interest in the construction of the fleet. The direct approach indicated good faith. And handed Kirts a golden opportunity to build up a sound rapport. And so it was.

I, a Fae, have spent LITERAL CENTURIES studying the subtle arts of deception, glamour, deceit, and misdirection, and you, a mere human, can just stand there and say things that are untrue?!\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s about right.\u201d\nVoss paused as he went back to reading the small glass case he kept in his pocket. Words and images scrolling by blindly as he went. She reached at the thing to smash it and regain her control.\nBut Shay simply pulled his hands out of reach and kept reading. A slight turn to put her at angle to his hip and not straight on.\n\"Surely you jest.\" Voss said as she hovered over now. Her wings vibrating the air similar to a hummingbird.\n\"Nope. Lying is easy.\" Shay flatly reacted. \"It's the truest truth that's ever been told about people that's true. We lie all the time.\"\nHe realized the woman was hovered several inches from his temple and absently swatted as her so she'd make some room. She landed and stomped her foot a little at the gesture, the wings giving off an iridescent shine as they readjusted.\n\"But why?\" She asked next.\nShay stopped texting and glanced up. \"Because fuck you, that's why.\"\n\"That's not an answer!\"\n\"Yes it is. That's my point.\"\nThe woman angrily glared at him. Then at the gorgon seated nearby. \"You. Lizard. Surely you know a good reason for his insolence.\"\nAmal pushed her sunglasses back on the bridge of her nose. \"Shay? He's always like this.\"\nThere it was. A name. A sharp grin crossed Voss' face. She would make this puny man's life a living hell.\n\"My dearest Shay is it not? I gift thee with-\"\n\"-That is not my real name. That's my nickname.\"\n\"Your *what?*\"\n\"Yeah?\" He looked up again, first at Amal, then at her.\n\"A nickname?\"\n\"They don't have pet names in Middle Earth?\" Shay asked her. \"You don't shorten anything, or give people  names after random shit in life?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Sounds complicated.\"\n\"She lied to me.\" Voss pointed. Amal's hair wrap moved, and hissing could be heard.\n\"No, that's what I've always known him as. That's what everybody calls him.\"\n\"You lie about your own name?\" Voss turned to Shay now.\nShay finally put the phone away. \"Duh! Like I'mma sit here and let someone put a curse on me like it's just something to do. I got more sense than that.\"\nVoss quickly hovered around to be in front of him again. Wriggling her fingers in his face like she was scolding a dog.\n\"You are scared of my power.\"\n\"I'm scared of violating my probation.\"\n\"You're still doing that?\" Amal interrupted.\n\"Like two and a half years.\" He noted.\nAmal took a sip of her thermos. \"The kingdoms don't mess around these days.\"\n\"Hello?\" Voss redirected, knocking on his forehead with a fist. \"Are you in there?\"\nShay swatted her away again. \"Yes.\"\n\"Lie to me.\" Voss leaned back in. \"Lie to me. Let's hear it.\"\nShay looked around the room. Then at Amal. She simply shrugged and continued drinking coffee. He glanced at the fae as she continued staring at him, and quietly considering the quickest way to perhaps remove his heart. And so, he took a deep breath, palmed his forehead and began.\n\"The moon is made of cheese. Magic isn't real. Gravity is a myth. You can use aluminium foil in the microwave. Water is inherently poisonous. Fentanyl is a great part of a balanced breakfast. This place is Venezuela on steroids. I'm white.\"\nAmal choked for a second nearby.\n\"Radiation is great for your skin. Dogs can't look up. The Moon landing was fake.\"\n\"...Didn't you just say the moon was cheese?\"\n\"We landed on that muthafucka' though... The Brooklyn Bridge is for sale. Milk and Orange Juice go great together. I cannot believe it's not butter. Birds aren't real. This handgun is fake.\"\n\"You're on probation.\" The gorgon spoke.\nHe wrapped his hands around her shoulders and gently shook her. \"Is this working yet? Have I gotten through to you?\"\n\"It's not fair.\" Voss stammered.\n\"Fair only works in weather and maidens, and there aren't enough maidens to go around.\"\nAmal slapped the table at this one. \"Oh my God.\"\nVoss finally shrank down after he let go. She seemed satisfied, yet disappointed. Shay was still staring her in the face as if she'd ruined his entire day. Which, knowing Shay, she actually might have.\n\"Is that enough? Are you happy?\"\nShe threw her arms over his shoulders. \"...Marry me?\"\n\"Huh?\"\nShe fluttered her wings and hiked herself up to wrap him with her legs. Amal stood up in case she needed to free him from her grasp.\n\"Uhhhh, time for some truth.\" Shay reacted. He held up one of hands to show a ring \"I'm taken.\"\n\"...Wow that's kinky.\" Amal frowned.\n---\nSo you successfully seduced a fae? Roll for Charisma?",

The flames cast dancing shadows across the room, creating an ambiance of warmth and intimacy.\nT\u00farin sat cross-legged on the rug before the hearth, his back propped against a stack of cushions, his eyes fixed on the flickering flames. Beleg was sprawled out beside him, his head resting in T\u00farin's lap. His silvery hair, a stark contrast to the rich tones of the rug, flowed like a river of moonlight.\nT\u00farin's fingers idly traced patterns through Beleg's hair, combing through the silken strands. It was a soothing ritual, one that had become second nature to them. Beleg closed his eyes, a contented sigh escaping his lips as he relished in the sensation.\nThe night beyond the windows was cold and dark, but within their hut, a cocoon of warmth and affection enveloped them. The hearth crackled and popped, radiating a gentle heat that banished the chill from the room.\n\"Tell me a story,\" T\u00farin whispered, his voice soft like the rustling leaves in a gentle breeze. \"Please?\"\nBeleg's lips curved into a smile even though his eyes remained closed. \"Very well. What kind of story would you like to hear tonight, my love?\"\nT\u00farin's fingers continued their rhythmic dance through Beleg's hair as he contemplated. \"Tell me of a great adventure, one where heroes rise against insurmountable odds.\"\n\"So it shall be,\" Beleg began, his voice a soothing murmur. \"Once upon a time, in a land not so different from our own, there lived a valiant hero named\u2026 T\u00farin. He was known throughout the realm for his bravery and unyielding spirit, even though he was a bit stubborn and reckless.\"\nT\u00farin chuckled softly. \"Go on.\"\n\"Yet, even the bravest of heroes have their moments of doubt,\" Beleg continued. \"And so it was that T\u00farin found himself facing a formidable foe, a dragon of immense size and power.\"\nT\u00farin's fingers stilled in Beleg's hair, his eyes focused on the imaginary world his lover was weaving with his words. \"How did he defeat the dragon?\"\n\"Ah, patience. That is the heart of the tale,\" Beleg replied. \"T\u00farin knew that he could not conquer the dragon through strength alone. So, he embarked on a quest to find the dragon's secret weakness, a vulnerability that even the mightiest of beasts possessed.\"\nAs Beleg's storytelling continued, the room seemed to fade away, and T\u00farin found himself immersed in the adventure. He listened with rapt attention, his mind painting vivid images of the hero's journey, the dragon, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil.\nOutside, the wind whispered secrets to the trees, but within their hut, Beleg's voice was the only sound that mattered. The flames in the hearth danced to the rhythm of the story, casting ever-shifting shadows on the walls.\nAs Beleg's tale neared its conclusion, T\u00farin felt a profound sense of contentment wash over him. The world beyond their walls could be chaotic and unforgiving, but here, in their little haven, it wouldn\u2019t reach them.\n\"And so,\" Beleg concluded, \"T\u00farin, armed with the knowledge of the dragon's weakness, faced the beast one final time.

We do not know if or when Morgoth will let his worms loose against us.\"\nLeaning down, T\u00farin captured Beleg's lips in a gentle kiss, a testament to the love that bound them together. Their lips met with a soft and lingering sweetness, like the taste of honey on a crisp autumn morning.\n\"Then we will meet those creatures head on and rise triumphant, just how the hero in your story did,\" T\u00farin whispered against his lover's lips.\nAs they pulled away, T\u00farin settled back against the cushions, his fingers resuming their gentle caresses through Beleg's hair.
