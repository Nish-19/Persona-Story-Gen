#### Story ####
I am on the side of the heroes, though most would prefer to distance themselves from me. When decency, diplomacy, and nonlethal force have failed, I am who they call. I am the one they send when they're out of options. I am the last resort, the ace in the deck. The Executioner.

I am kept on retainer, with bonuses for every job I perform. I am expensive, but ensuring I continue to serve them, and have no incentive to become a villain myself, is also a strong motivator. Today, I am called on once more. The dossier is about a being, more monster than human. Many civilian deaths, enough power to apply significant pressure to local government and law enforcement. And, most recently, several heroes have been added to the list of those he has killed. He refers to himself as Kane.

I ride there quietly preparing myself physically and mentally. The man driving the unmarked van is scared of me, I can feel it. My transporters usually are. Cleaning my guns, snapping my fingers to crush soda cans. I am dressed in black, wearing the mask I always wear to jobs. The mouth grins, but the eyes have tears in them.

I am deployed ten miles away from Kane's compound. My foot falls are silent. He has a staff, including a round the clock guard. His henchmen are fair targets, he has scared my bosses enough that I am permitted to use maximum lethality on any of Kane's minions.

I drop a man from a thousand meters, and continue to advance. He will be found, but they will soon know I am here regardless. At fifty meters, I can feel the electrical systems. They run off the grid. They think it is safe and stable, but with a flick of my fingers, their whole grid is overloaded. All goes dark, and it is in darkness that I thrive.

Dead eye precision, augmented by the ability to make heads explode. Popping people with my powers is energy intensive, which is why I still use guns and other weapons. Through darkened hallways, hearing the sounds of guards panicking. They know what the overload means. Despite efforts to keep me secret, the infamous Executioner is whispered about in the underworld.

Bullets through eyes, a trail of bodies. I have a map of the compound memorized, but I am not sure where Kane is. Fear is everywhere. But then I feel it. A mind that takes pleasure in this all, in a visceral way. I enjoy my work, I am good at it and it feels good to be a master of my trade. But this, this is different. An almost worrying amount of pleasure. Someone who lives for an avatar of death to arrive in the night, seeking to destroy them. It can only be Kane.

He is not alone. I prepare myself, then roll a blinding flash into the room. In three seconds, it pops, and I charge in gun blazing. In five seconds, all but one is bleeding on the ground. I unload my clip, but the bullets stop in the air. Apparently Kane has a means of protecting himself from projectiles.

He is physically intimidating, even to me. He must still be blind, but he charges in my direction. I roll to the side, narrowly avoiding him. I try to pop his head, but there is a wall of some force that stops it. I might be able to break through, but it would leave me exhausted, and it might not work. After fifteen successful missions, dying here would be shameful.

His vision will return, I need to leverage his blindness while I can. I draw my knives, and launch myself. His shielding stops them, but I give a burst of power to my right and punch through. It slices open his side. He bellows, and a powerful fist grazes my cheek. He can see now, or at least see well enough to know my location.

The melee continues. He has tremendous physical strength, but no formal martial arts training. Repeatedly, I get inside his guard, land a blow, then dance away. The floor is already slick with blood. He has the berserker strength, but even the scariest warrior can run out of blood. I make my move, popping another directional flash. He recoils from the burst of light, and in less than a second, I bury my knife deep in his chest. Even he could not survive a significant hole in his aorta.

He falls, already fading, weakly swinging around him as blood fountains from his chest. I watch, letting time do its work. I make sure he is thoroughly dead, then leave. My exfiltration is unimpeded, and I ride home covered in the blood of my enemies. The driver is even more scared than he was before. Sixteen successful missions, now.
