When Dr. John Watson orders two self-assembly desks for their cottage, he quickly realizes that building furniture with the world's least patient consulting detective, Sherlock Holmes, might be a greater challenge than any case they've faced.


#### Story ####
Dr John Watson was actually very proud of his idea for their new desks for the cottage.
Ha! These newfangled ideas were a life safer for men like them who really at times tended to spend a lot of time on end at their desk.
This solution was indeed perfect for them, two desks, the same model and colours on tone with the wall against which each desk rested, the high of the tabletop adjustable with a simple button, truly the marvels of Misters Swan and Edison as they would have once said so many years ago, and so, so much space for all the trinkets they had accumulated in more than a century of existence, space to manage properly all the electric cords this new century was bringing to their life, in a word: it was perfect.
There was, looking carefully, a downside.
The price was not as high as they had expected because they were to assemble them themselves.
That was simply the recipe for disaster.
And if the perspective of having to assemble anything with the least patient consulting detective in the world wasnt enough, on the day they expected the delivery they also had plumbing issues.
At least his leg wasnt acting up, hot as that summer was.
The desk arrived just as they were mopping up the disaster in the kitchen, they had panicked and had outlandish idea of closing the water from the control centre only after getting soaked so much that they mightve as well grown gills.
Luckily they were well organized men and knew how to work in team, Watson sprinted to the door to get the desks and Holmes handled the damage control.
They decided for assembling the desks that very afternoon, and if one took into count that otherwise they would have only had to wait for the plumber it was a sound and good plan.
They mopped everything and had a quick lunch, moved their old desks so to create a working space and set to it.
Watson took charge with little resistance from the detective who had decided to only stay with a fresh pair of pijama trousers after soaking his favourite one that morning.
Holmes!  Called the doctor.  Get here, old man, I need a hand.
I thought you had taken charge, Captain. Chuckled Holmes as he approached and stole a kiss from his lips.
Dont distract me you fiend. Help me with the instructions.
Holmes snickered again. Watson, that booklet is basically only drawings! He exclaimed, outraged, then he took it up to study it.
He started again. I suppose This  He turned the booklet sideways.  Yes, Id say that you mounted well this bar uniting the legs. Now you should connect this bar?
Yes, we finished this part. Now Oh no. Holmes, theres text. Its over. Commented the doctor as he set to read.
Put the glasses on, old boy.  Murmured the detective handing him some thin, gold rimmed glasses he had been wearing since 1895.  Im sure we can pull it off. Let me see.
The detective took up the instructions book with a smug expression which fell as soon as he put his eyes on the actual text.
He shushed Watsons chuckle and set to read it.
So now. Take the piece number 7? Alright and fit it into the hexagonal hole
Do help me!
Watson, you have to put it into the hole, the point is getting the hole.
Are you listening to yourself? Come here and hold it as I fix the other end.
Holmes grinned. Of course I do, old man. Now what? he asked as the doctor fixed the knob.
Now we need to get the pieces from one to four, it says.
Said pieces turned out to be what constituted the tabletop, and Holmes would have been glad to lend a hand in assembling it, if the plumber hadnt rung the bell in that very minute.
The detective rose, telling his husband that he would be the one to care for it, threw on a dressing gown after the doctors laughing suggestion, jumped over the couch and opened the door ready to handle yet another human contact.
When the workman had dealt with the issue on hand and he taken his leave, Holmes returned to the other task on end.
He found that Watson had assembled both tabletops and also the other part of the second desk and was only waiting for his help.
Watson directed him to turn the legs of the table on to the underside of the tabletop and aligning the holes for the screws and then, Allen key in hand, to tighten all twenty-one of them for each table.
The doctor snickered as Holmes plopped down in his favourite cross-legged sitting and started to move to fix the screws by crawling on the floor.
The job was an easy one, and few minutes later they only had to turn the table back on and fix the electric parts.
As soon as the desks were finished, Watson approached his husband, leaning up to kiss him.
Holmes answered the kiss with sweetness and passion, deepening it and circling his husbands waist.
Now what, dearest man? He asked as the kiss was broken.
Now, old man, - Watsons right hand climbed from his waist in a little caress up to his sternum where he just laid the hand for a moment before poking his partner.  now we need to tidy up. He grinned.
Holmes groaned, as always annoyed by such duties. Cant we postpone it for a bit, my dear? I do feel like we both deserve a treat for having managed it so quickly.  He smiled, cupping Watsons cheek.  And Im rather sure I have a nice little treat just right here.
Watson laughed and kissed his partner again. Your suggestion
does
have merits Holmes. Maybe we could take a nap He grinned steering his partner toward their bedroom.
A nap! You have always the most wonderful ideas, my Watson! Grinned Holmes, hugging his husband as well.
