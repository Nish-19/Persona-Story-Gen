#### Writing Prompt ####
At Coffee Nutz, a quirky café doubling as a front for its owner's illicit dealings, the staff juggles muffins, Russian lessons, and suspiciously heavy sacks of "sugar." But when a mysterious figure from Kyoto begins searching for a legendary weapon, the café's quiet chaos might just collide with something far more dangerous.


#### Story ####
It was a chilly early autumn morning as the new and improved Coffee Nutz opened its doors and prepared for the day. The Coffee Nutz crew this week consisted of the Russian and perpetually angry-looking [**Sonya**]( the totally not high or anything college dropout [**Stevie**]( and of course the new owner Nathan "Nate" (or Mr. Gray) himself. Nate was currently in the back, going over his *other* store's supply, y'know, the illegal, *more* addicting kind? The other two employees were well aware of Coffee Nutz moonlighting as Nate's personal drug ring. Sonya didn't exactly approve of it, but she didn't exactly care enough to raise objections. And Stevie? Well lets just say that half of Stevie's paycheck was not in the form of *money*... Sonya was preparing the first batches for the bakery all while trying to teach poor Stevie some Russian while he stacked cups and prepped the coffee machines. Nate was finishing up packing all the little baggies and pills deep into their respective sacks of coffee, sugar and the like. Away from any prying eyes. "No. No you say *dobroe utro*", Sonya enunciated every word as she stacked muffins behind the counter glass. "D-dobe...roy....", Stevie actually had to put down the pack of coffee he was feeding the machine to focus up, "Dobroy....Oot....what was it?" The Russian woman gave a resolute sigh. "Why do I bozer?", she muttered to herself, "You like my hasband. In ze one ear. Out of ze ozer. *Dob*. *Roe*. *Ut*. *Ro*." Stevie gave a whine. If he honestly cared about learning things, he would've stayed in college instead of pursuing a career in ethical hacking. "Dobe..." Meanwhile in the storage room near the back, Nate paused near one of the boxes he was packing as he heard a muffled crash come from outside, followed by a light string of curses. It was too early for customers. Front *or* back ones... He walked out through the back door and peeked around the corner, leaning his forearms on the door frame. Oh. It was only *Leon*...again. What a surprise! "Oy!", Nate called out to him, "Freeloader! Stop messin' with my trash cans and make yerself useful, yes? Might score ya a free coffee and muffin!" Nate tossed Leon a broom. "Go sweep the front. Look pretty.", with a grin and a wink, Nate disappeared back inside. As Nate joined his team up front in opening the cafe, Sonya gave their boss a weary look. "How many *narcos* we get zis time, Gray?", she said with a raised eyebrow as Stevie took his rightful place at the register. "With *my* luck?", Nate looked over as he perched on one of the back tables while picking at a freshly made muffin, "The whole bloody *lot* of 'em!" ----------------- ## Meanwhile in Kyoto, Japan. ## High up in a secluded temple. [**Leo**]( the current leader of The Ministry, soundlessly took a seat on the floor next to his sensei. "She *will* be a part of us once again, Sensei. That I assure you. And the weapon will be passed on to its *rightful* owner. But it will not be an easy task.", Leo spoke quietly with his eyes closed, keeping to the same quiet and meditative atmosphere as his master. "Nothing is ever absolute", came the answer from the old man, "But there is something to easy your path, something that could...guide your way in your endeavors. That sword, it is not without a partner. *Yin and yang*. There exists another weapon. A sword of *light* to balance out the dark. An opposite to *Life Drainer*." Leo tensed up but did not let his surprise show any further than that. He remained silent as the sensei gave a smile. "In time, my student, you will learn all that you need to know." --- *edit: Leo's pic changed.*
