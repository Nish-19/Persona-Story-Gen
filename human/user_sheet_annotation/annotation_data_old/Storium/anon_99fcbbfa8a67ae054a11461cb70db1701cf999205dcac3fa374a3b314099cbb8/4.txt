In a frigid northern city where titans have mysteriously begun to appear, two young hunters, constantly shadowed by surgeons to keep their inner wraiths in check, must uncover the truth behind the attacks before the town expels themâ€”or worse, the titans strike again.


#### Story ####
Shlossheim was one of the Northernmost cities in the known world. It had longer winters than almost anywhere else and as the hunt strolled down the wide center street, it was clear that the locals built their city with this in mind. Even though Schhlossheim was not a city accustomed to war, homes were build like little stone fortresses, or rather, little ceramic fortresses as many of the chimneys had ceramic tiles about them, to make sure they retained the escaping heat from inner fires. Each of the hunting party had experienced the large ceramic stoves and how effectively they heated a room as well as they had been put up for the past 3 days by the townsfolk. Titans carved out enormous territories, and yet the many beasts of the colder North did not go anywhere near this city. It had been that way in Capulan, Storp, and Gilgrim as well right before the sudden appearances of some of the most powerful titans the hunters had seen in a long time. What was more was that the titans werent any of the many hundred that were known, and many had died, not only of the hapless populace, but even the hunters when they arrived as the bizarre powers of the beasts proved to be nasty, and lethal surprises for everyone involved. They were searching for evidence of titan territorial markings, the presence of nearby titans, or even simply a sighting, but if something didnt happen soon, they were probably going to be expelled from the town, it wasnt safe to have beacons around, and hunters, two of them no less, were even worse. The hunters in question, two younger men, hadnt received the same dignified treatment the others had and stayed with a young surgeon named Hamon, along with his mentor. It wasnt a game, hunters were no less dangerous than the titans and a surgeon needed to be ready at all times to quell the influence of an acrimonious wraith to make sure the hunters behaved themselves. Hamon had been told he had to deal with only one wraith, so the fact that he was dealing with two hunters definitely surprised him. He worked twelve-hour shifts with a colleague and they were never more than 10 feet away from the young men, and as for the young men and their wraith, they might have chafed at the tight control, and if they were chafing, some of that was definitely due to their own inner demon, who was urging them constantly that they wouldnt enjoy themselves unless they ditched the wet blanket surgeons. The others however, had a rare bit of comfort with local families and were given free room and board wherever they decided to stay. The Huntmaster would soon have to deal with the mayor, and the beacons were simply to take brief constitutionals around the streets, just in case some invisible titan was watching. There had been invisible titans before, and maybe that was the secret of the sudden attacks on the cities. Even so, the hunting party had a definite break from hardtack and jerk meat and the many annoyances of the road.
