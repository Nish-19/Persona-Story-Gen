#### Story ####
Short story about a woman who marries an ice man... I married an ice man. I first met him in a hotel at a ski resort. "Look, that's an ice man," my friend whispered. The iceman was tall, and he seemed to be young, but his fingers were rimed with a white frost that looked as if it would never melt. Something about him pierced me to the heart. I made up some excuse not to go out, and stayed in the hotel. I felt compelled to talk to the ice man no matter what. "I don't ski," he said. "I just like to sit here and read and look at the snow. You're interested in me, aren't you? You want to know what an ice man is." I held back from asking personal questions. Instead, the iceman talked about me. Somehow, he knew all about me. "How do you know so much about me?" "I can't read minds or anything. I just know." Eventually we started dating. We always sat on a bench in the park and talked." "Why don't you talk about yourself? How did you come to be an ice man?" "I don't know. I don't even know if I had parents." I fell seriously in love with this ice man. The ice man loved me just as I was√≥in the present. My mother and my older sister were strongly opposed to my marrying the ice man. "You don't know a thing about his background." So we got married. Nobody blessed the wedding, and no friends or relatives were happy for us. We rented a tiny apartment, and the ice man made a living by working at a cold-storage meat facility The two of us lived a happy life together, without bothering or being bothered by anyone. I even started to love having sex with the ice man. We wanted to have a child but that didn't seem to be possible. It may have been that human genes and ice-man genes didn't combine easily. I found myself with time on my hands. I would finish up all the housework, and then having nothing to do. I was still young, and doing the same thing day after day. "How would it be if the two of us went away on a trip somewhere, just for a change?" "Well, if you really want to go on a trip so badly, I don't have anything against it." "How about visiting the South Pole?" It seemed as soon as I spoke the words "South Pole," something changed inside him. I had a premonition that if we went to the South Pole something would happen to us, but I couldn't find a good reason to cancel the trip. When we stepped off onto the ground of the South Pole I felt my husbands body lurch. something inside the ice man had been secretly violently shaken. He walked enthusiastically from place to place as if he couldn't get enough of it. He learned the local language quickly. I felt as though my husband had betrayed me and left me to care for myself. I eventually lost my strength. The airplane that had brought us there wad long since gone, and the runway was covered with ice. "Winter has come It looks as though we'll have to stay here until next spring." About three months after we arrived, I realized I was pregnant. The child would be a little ice man. I could feel its chill inside me, Our new family would never again set foot outside the South Pole. I am lonelier than anyone else in the world.
