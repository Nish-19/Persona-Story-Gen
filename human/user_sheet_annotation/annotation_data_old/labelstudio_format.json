        "writing_prompt": "It is an unchangeable condition of genies' existence that they die after granting a certain number of wishes. Write a story about the last wish in the world.",
        "story": "We were created in an age of unprecedented knowledge and progress. Genies, beings that could grant wishes. We were part of an enlightened civilization that spanned the galaxy. Lives were good, incredible things were created, and there was still so much left to be learned. But like all good things, it came to an end. Our rate of advancement decoupled from the culture necessary to use our super science safely. So many perished as the heights of wonders turned to the deepest depths of desolation.\nSo much was gone, scars both in the universe at large and in the minds of those lucky few who survived. So much was forgotten, rendered inoperable. We, the genies, could not replenish ourselves. Granting wishes took a special kind of energy. The machines needed to generate it safely were obliterated, and that left every genie only with the energy they had at the time of the fall.\nNow, I am the last genie in existence, and I've only one wish left before I discorporate and become one with the universe again. I have a personality and a will of my own, but to change anything, I must be fulfilling the wish of a mortal. The most I can do is make suggestions to the mortal who asks. There are limits to what I can do, but we genies can do remarkable things. I hide myself away, hoping that the lost soul who finds me will wish for something that I can feel proud of as I fade away.\nThe days go by. On this world, like so many others, the great works of architecture are being reclaimed by nature. Spires that touched the sky are turning green before they topple to the ground, never to rise again. I watch the occasional ship streak across the sky, the crew's desires and goals totally unknown to me. I know I am being sought out, people know there is but one more wish to be had, and a vague notion of where I am in the greater galaxy. Space is big, searching even one planet could take a lifetime.

Earth's fate is sealed, all we can do now is slow down the degradation of the biosphere to buy time. Time to load the genes of as many organisms and the best of our technology onto one, large spacecraft.\nOf course, everyone wants to be on the Ark. To have a hope at not dying with our world, a fresh start on some distant world. A world which we could be the stewards of, and avoid recreating the horror unleashed on Earth. I made it to the second phase of the selection. Roughly one percent of the world's population has made it this far, but there is only room for thirty thousand on The Ark. I've got to try, and hope that I measure up enough to be one of the very few lucky ones.\nPhysical and cognitive tests. Personality inventories and brain scans. As many data points as can be gathered, looking for people who are exceptional in desirable ways, without other issues that might make them a danger to the mission. I go through it all, shaking with nerves. But then, the day comes. I open the email, and my face falls. I have been ruled out in the second phase. It provides no explanation for why, or what my shortcomings were. A simple, polite message informing me that I too will be dying with this planet.\nI cry for hours, but eventually the storm of emotions passes. I was always going to die, even if I made it on The Ark. My trajectory is decidedly less exciting, but the end point has not changed. What to do with myself with the time left?\nI was never one for hedonism, though there is a great deal of that going around. What could I do that would have meaning? I begin reading philosophy, particularly those in the past who have mused on death and what constitutes a life worth living. The nihilists, the hedonists, the absurdists, the ascetics, the epicureans. I realize that there is a deeply rooted desire inside me to create. To write, to draw, to paint, to compose.\nMy first stumbling steps in this vein are poor, but I tell myself one must first fail before they can succeed. It is an engaging way to spend time, even though it is unexceptional. The days fly by. I try to avoid the news, the tragedy and horror all around the world as the end draws nearer. I am fortunate enough to live in a stable place. I feel I should help people, but what can I do against the tidal wave of sorrow? Robots could do whatever I would do better than I could ever hope to.\nHaving reached some level of competence, I seek others. People to discuss projects with, to cry with. People whose lives I might brighten as the world caves in. We have some good times, fun conversations and suggestions for our work. Machines can do everything useful we could do, labor has been almost completely automated for decades. They can also do art far more quickly, but there are still communities for human made creations, despite the deluge of generated content. There is joy, even as we sit beneath the shadow of doom.\nSuicides were already common, but they are ticking up as the cut off date draws near. The Ark is launched, with only a few months before our world dies. It is bittersweet, knowing how close I came to being one of them, and knowing that any hope of escape is thoroughly dead. I make things that I think qualify as beautiful, and it gives me a modicum of peace.\nI lose two members of my creative group in a week. Myself and the other survivors cry together. We agree that we will try to eke out a last bit of fulfillment and joy before the end. I find the acute sadness brings out emotions, and that expressing them results in creations I am proud of. Images of faces among the stars, poetry and music venerating the moon.\nThe day arrives. Past this point, the probability of a violent and painful death grows massively. We have one last big get together, my group and any of their family or associates that have made it this far. We laugh, we cry. Then comes the end. The room grows quiet as our eyes lose their light. We slip away peacefully, into whatever follows the mortal life.",

She landed and stomped her foot a little at the gesture, the wings giving off an iridescent shine as they readjusted.\n\"But why?\" She asked next.\nShay stopped texting and glanced up. \"Because fuck you, that's why.\"\n\"That's not an answer!\"\n\"Yes it is. That's my point.\"\nThe woman angrily glared at him. Then at the gorgon seated nearby. \"You. Lizard. Surely you know a good reason for his insolence.\"\nAmal pushed her sunglasses back on the bridge of her nose. \"Shay? He's always like this.\"\nThere it was. A name. A sharp grin crossed Voss' face. She would make this puny man's life a living hell.\n\"My dearest Shay is it not? I gift thee with-\"\n\"-That is not my real name. That's my nickname.\"\n\"Your *what?*\"\n\"Yeah?\" He looked up again, first at Amal, then at her.\n\"A nickname?\"\n\"They don't have pet names in Middle Earth?\" Shay asked her. \"You don't shorten anything, or give people  names after random shit in life?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Sounds complicated.\"\n\"She lied to me.\" Voss pointed. Amal's hair wrap moved, and hissing could be heard.\n\"No, that's what I've always known him as. That's what everybody calls him.\"\n\"You lie about your own name?\" Voss turned to Shay now.\nShay finally put the phone away. \"Duh! Like I'mma sit here and let someone put a curse on me like it's just something to do. I got more sense than that.\"\nVoss quickly hovered around to be in front of him again. Wriggling her fingers in his face like she was scolding a dog.\n\"You are scared of my power.\"\n\"I'm scared of violating my probation.\"\n\"You're still doing that?\" Amal interrupted.\n\"Like two and a half years.\" He noted.\nAmal took a sip of her thermos. \"The kingdoms don't mess around these days.\"\n\"Hello?\" Voss redirected, knocking on his forehead with a fist. \"Are you in there?\"\nShay swatted her away again. \"Yes.\"\n\"Lie to me.\" Voss leaned back in. \"Lie to me. Let's hear it.\"\nShay looked around the room. Then at Amal. She simply shrugged and continued drinking coffee. He glanced at the fae as she continued staring at him, and quietly considering the quickest way to perhaps remove his heart. And so, he took a deep breath, palmed his forehead and began.\n\"The moon is made of cheese. Magic isn't real. Gravity is a myth. You can use aluminium foil in the microwave. Water is inherently poisonous. Fentanyl is a great part of a balanced breakfast. This place is Venezuela on steroids. I'm white.\"\nAmal choked for a second nearby.\n\"Radiation is great for your skin. Dogs can't look up. The Moon landing was fake.\"\n\"...Didn't you just say the moon was cheese?\"\n\"We landed on that muthafucka' though... The Brooklyn Bridge is for sale. Milk and Orange Juice go great together. I cannot believe it's not butter. Birds aren't real. This handgun is fake.\"\n\"You're on probation.\" The gorgon spoke.\nHe wrapped his hands around her shoulders and gently shook her. \"Is this working yet? Have I gotten through to you?\"\n\"It's not fair.\" Voss stammered.\n\"Fair only works in weather and maidens, and there aren't enough maidens to go around.\"\nAmal slapped the table at this one. \"Oh my God.\"\nVoss finally shrank down after he let go. She seemed satisfied, yet disappointed. Shay was still staring her in the face as if she'd ruined his entire day. Which, knowing Shay, she actually might have.\n\"Is that enough? Are you happy?\"\nShe threw her arms over his shoulders. \"...Marry me?\"\n\"Huh?\"\nShe fluttered her wings and hiked herself up to wrap him with her legs. Amal stood up in case she needed to free him from her grasp.\n\"Uhhhh, time for some truth.\" Shay reacted. He held up one of hands to show a ring \"I'm taken.\"\n\"...Wow that's kinky.\" Amal frowned.\n---\nSo you successfully seduced a fae? Roll for Charisma?",

Now stop jamming and fire.” Lieutenant Gabby Ria ordered, pointing at the child across from her.\nWhile she shrieked out her orders, Era froze, unable to pull the trigger. The lieutenant was right; they were only a weapon. Yet memories were flooding into its mind, drowning out that robotic side that often took centre stage. Memories of a specific human it couldn’t recognise, getting overwhelmed by their past.\nAcross from the pair, the girl, Jessica, remained curled behind a desk, gripping a stuffed bear. The paw of the bear once holding a tiny red balloon, one that had been torn off days ago. Even without the scraps she wore, she was a miserable sight. Tired eyes, constant shaking and a murmuring for help that only Era’s hyper-detailed hearing could pick up. “Please, leave me alone.” She begged.\nEra could never point its gun at a superior officer, so instead, it turned its face towards her, neck twisting eighty degrees to find her. They designed Era models to be basic, stripping them of all their unique features and traits. Giving them the same blank blue eyes, light brown hair, and voice chips. This making it harder for a lieutenant or any officer to see them as anything other than a disposable machine.\n“Why? Why can I think? I don’t like this? I don’t like thinking. Everything hurts, I’m scared. It’s dark in here. Gabby. You told me I wouldn’t hurt. Why am I hurting?” The tone remained robotic, with the blank face unable to express the sensations pulsing through its circuits.\nGabby retrieved her own pistol, gazing away from Era, turning her attention to the laboratory they stood in. They had bombed the place to hell. No, that didn’t even do it justice. They had bombed the place to purgatory, leaving nothing but scorched land, a few desks and the remnants of glass and tubes. If one passed through this place, they would assume it had been an underground dumping facility, not the proud anti Era factory they had boasted about while it was still active.\n“You can’t feel pain, and you can’t think. There shouldn’t even be a part of you that can think. It’s blocked under our programing. Listen to me, Era.” Gabby began.\n“I’M NOT ERA.” They snapped. “I’m Nick. We know each other. Don’t we?”\nGabby’s heart sank. This shouldn’t be possible. No other Era model had recovered their memories before. “They shouldn’t even have that name saved to your chip.” As she contemplated the information, she heard tiny footsteps near the table. Returning her gun to the girl, she fired a shot, trying to hit the monster before it could flee. When the gun fired, the girl ducked back behind the table. “Don’t move, monster. Is this your doing?”\nEra looked at the weapon in their hands, tensing. “You said this program was for justice. Didn’t you? That we would save people? Why are we doing this, then? You said this program would save me. Am I actually saved?” You’ve made me into a monster.”\n“They shouldn’t have assigned you to me, Nick. None of this makes any sense. I never lied about anything. On your deathbed, I told you that this was the only way you could keep fighting. You wanted to fight. I was against this.” Gabby kept her weapon pointed at the table, giving Era a side glance.\n“I don’t want to do this. I’m scared. Why did they need part of my brain? Can’t they make robots?”\n“Robots are unreliable. They can be hacked, and their energy drains far too quickly. Allowing them to use part of a human brain allows their processes to save space and energy on the field. You should already know this. We’ve had this conversation before, haven’t we?” Gabby stepped closer to the table, only to halt when she heard Era follow her.\n“Don’t kill her.”\n“Why not?”\n“She’s only a kid.”\nGabby sighed. “You know. Part of me wanted to believe that was actually you, Nick. That I could say a proper goodbye to my old friend. It’s not. That creature’s just pulling at memories, trying to find something that might weaken me. A creature like this killed you. You should know she isn’t just a kid. its emotional manipulation, the same type you fell to. I’m guessing you knew that too, monster. Or did you overlook that memory when you were sweeping through our files?”\nJessica screeched, tossing the bear to the floor. She knew she was trapped, giving guttural growls as she tapped the table, shaking her only cover. Gabby remained still, not approaching the sound, nor firing a wasted shot. “Nick, if that is you in there, you’ll take the shot.”\nEra did nothing, and so Gabby reached into Era’s hand, pulling the trigger on his weapon. When it fired, the monster popped out from its cover, assuming Gabby had fired her own gun. Thinking it had a chance to run, it lunged out of cover, only to get shot down by Gabby. The ‘girls’ synthetic skin falling away as it powered down, revealing the metallic body underneath.\n“Fucking manipulative pricks. I can’t believe they keep making these things. To think, a monster like that can find out so much about a person without needing to get into their heads. Not only that, their able to mess with the Era models programming. So much for the anti-hacking argument my superiors gave me. Why do we even need a human brain in them anymore, if those creatures can get around it?” Gabby pushed her fingers against her eyes, wiping the tears away. “Fucking hell, Nick. You’re still haunting me.”\n“You’re a Lieutenant now Gabby?” A voice asked, causing Gabby to stiffen. “Weren’t you meant to wait for me?”\n“You died. I couldn’t wait. Nick, I’m sorry. I hesitated, and it killed you because of it. Nick, I’m…” She turned, finding a blank Era model staring at her.\n“There is no Nick in my records? Has a person been added to the mission statement? If so, please give me their full name or number and rank, so I may add them to my objective.”\n“Era, override programming protocol, no identification. Now tell me, who are you?” Gabby said, praying it wasn’t who she thought it was.\n“Heather Phillips donated this brain. Id 2003213. Would you like any further information on Heather Phillips?” Era asked.\n“No.” Gabby walked over and stomped the dead monster, making sure there was no way that its programming could keep running. “To think our enemies have resorted to this. Era, enter low-power mode, only run basic functions and cut off your link to main server. Sweep the area and capture anything humanoid you find. If you can’t capture it, kill it.”\nWith Gabby’s orders, the machine walked around the ruined laboratory, searching for more of those creatures. Gabby hoping that they wouldn’t be able to hack Era in its low powered mode. Without access to the main server, it shouldn’t be able to give away any of her secrets either. Gabby assuming that was how it found out about her connection to Nick, through whatever files they had saved about her and her previous missions.\nWhile Era searched the area, Gabby called their base. “Our enemies are getting stronger.

No other Era model had recovered their memories before. “They shouldn’t even have that name saved to your chip.” As she contemplated the information, she heard tiny footsteps near the table.

Is this your doing?”\nEra looked at the weapon in their hands, tensing. “You said this program was for justice. Didn’t you? That we would save people? Why are we doing this, then? You said this program would save me. Am I actually saved?” You’ve made me into a monster.”\n“They shouldn’t have assigned you to me, Nick. None of this makes any sense. I never lied about anything.

Part of me wanted to believe that was actually you, Nick. That I could say a proper goodbye to my old friend. It’s not. That creature’s just pulling at memories, trying to find something that might weaken me. A creature like this killed you.

        "story": "“Ok, so can you let go of my hand now?” Jeremy asked, feeling the mimics stiff tongue flicking against his elbow, touching it in ways that no elbow should ever be touched. When the mimic finally spat out his hand, Jeremy fell back, grimacing at the sight of the bright blue saliva that was dribbling down his arm, staining the stone dungeon floor below.\n“There. Next time will you think before you shove your hand into someone’s mouth?” The treasure chest’s lid flapped, acting like it was possessed by demonic magic. The golden chest was a sight that promised legendary treasures, having a wooden exterior with gold metal plating that lined its edges and front. Even knowing it was a mimic, Jeremy struggled to resist diving into it again, all his instincts as an adventurer telling him it had rare loot.\nJeremy dragged his hand against the side of his pants, trying to clean off as much mimic saliva as he could, before inspecting the chest. Small pin sized eyes near the keyhole of the chest, the way it twitched as if it were drawing breath. Without his treasure hungry trance, it was obvious this wasn’t a real chest. Though, most adventurers never took the time to check out a chest, too busy searching for loot to bother with such a thing.\n“I’m sorry, but you’re a mimic, right? If you don’t want someone touching you, why don’t you transform into a chair or something? That seems easier.” Jeremy suggested, feeling this wasn’t entirely his fault. A treasure chest in a dungeon wasn’t the sort of thing that screamed, don’t touch me.\n“I’m not some freak that wants people sitting on them! I would rather have a hundred hands shoved into my mouth than an orc trying to use me as a stool.” The chest huffed, and when they said it like that, Jeremy had to agree with them.\nJeremy tapped at his chin, thinking about other items the mimic could control. Not wanting to waste too much time going over the options, he quickly fired a few off.\n“A lamp.”\n“Too many people will try to blow me out.”\n“A statue?”\n“Too many people will start climbing all over me.”\n“A human?”\n“Ew.”\n“What do you mean, ew?” Jeremy said, offended by the monster’s ew. He wasn’t the one that just slobbered over someone’s arm. “Fine, stay a treasure chest. I hope someone tries to lock pick you.” Jeremy collected his bag from the dungeon floor and threw it over his shoulder. “Well, if you’ve got no treasure to offer me, then I’ll be on my way.”\n“Wait. Do you really think the human disguise could work?” It asked, considering the idea. The mimic’s body dissolved into a pile of goo, pooling by the adventurers’ feet before suddenly bursting up from the floor, bouncing to a human sized figure, one that slowly gained its features before him.\nThe mimics new form now towering over Jeremy, staring down at him with its expressionless face. They were as strange as a person could be. Eyes devoid of any color, skin having an eerie blue tint and long silver hair that fell to the shoulders of the robe they were wearing .\nJeremy didn’t know what to think of the form. It looked human-ish? Like a body that belonged to a mage or some other mana filled person. However, it didn’t look normal, not the type of body you wouldn’t notice if you passed it on the street. “It’s a little unique.” Jeremy said, trying to be nice.\n“You hate it.”\n“I don’t hate it. I just wouldn’t trust that man if I passed them on the street. I would expect them to curse me or something. You need to think of something simpler. Close your eyes and imagine the most generic adventurer you can think of.”\nThe mimic transformed into Jeremy, opening its eyes. “How’s this then?” It asked, swirling on the spot, giving Jeremy a look at his own body, something that was more unsettling than he expected it to be.\n“I’m not generic! I’m unique for a human. Look at my scar.” Jeremy said, lifting his shirt, showing off the small scar he had gotten from poking himself with a knife while drunkenly preparing a meal. “See, a scar means I’m unique.”\nThe mimic leaned in closer, as if he were about to give Jeremy’s stomach raspberries. “Ah, so you do. I’ll correct that.” The mimic retreated and raised its shirt, showing off the same scar. “There, now I should be able to walk around without being bothered.”\n“You can’t be me. I’m me.” Jeremy sighed, scratching his head. “Look, just go back to being a chest, ok? That’s the safest option. I’ll even put up a sign that says mimics are living creatures.

Next time will you think before you shove your hand into someone’s mouth?” The treasure chest’s lid flapped, acting like it was possessed by demonic magic. The golden chest was a sight that promised legendary treasures, having a wooden exterior with gold metal plating that lined its edges and front. Even knowing it was a mimic, Jeremy struggled to resist diving into it again, all his instincts as an adventurer telling him it had rare loot.\nJeremy dragged his hand against the side of his pants, trying to clean off as much mimic saliva as he could, before inspecting the chest. Small pin sized eyes near the keyhole of the chest, the way it twitched as if it were drawing breath. Without his treasure hungry trance, it was obvious this wasn’t a real chest. Though, most adventurers never took the time to check out a chest, too busy searching for loot to bother with such a thing.\n“I’m sorry, but you’re a mimic, right? If you don’t want someone touching you, why don’t you transform into a chair or something? That seems easier.” Jeremy suggested, feeling this wasn’t entirely his fault. A treasure chest in a dungeon wasn’t the sort of thing that screamed, don’t touch me.\n“I’m not some freak that wants people sitting on them! I would rather have a hundred hands shoved into my mouth than an orc trying to use me as a stool.” The chest huffed, and when they said it like that, Jeremy had to agree with them.\nJeremy tapped at his chin, thinking about other items the mimic could control.

Do you really think the human disguise could work?” It asked, considering the idea. The mimic’s body dissolved into a pile of goo, pooling by the adventurers’ feet before suddenly bursting up from the floor, bouncing to a human sized figure, one that slowly gained its features before him.\nThe mimics new form now towering over Jeremy, staring down at him with its expressionless face. They were as strange as a person could be. Eyes devoid of any color, skin having an eerie blue tint and long silver hair that fell to the shoulders of the robe they were wearing .\nJeremy didn’t know what to think of the form. It looked human-ish? Like a body that belonged to a mage or some other mana filled person. However, it didn’t look normal, not the type of body you wouldn’t notice if you passed it on the street. “It’s a little unique.” Jeremy said, trying to be nice.\n“You hate it.”\n“I don’t hate it. I just wouldn’t trust that man if I passed them on the street. I would expect them to curse me or something. You need to think of something simpler. Close your eyes and imagine the most generic adventurer you can think of.”\nThe mimic transformed into Jeremy, opening its eyes. “How’s this then?” It asked, swirling on the spot, giving Jeremy a look at his own body, something that was more unsettling than he expected it to be.\n“I’m not generic! I’m unique for a human. Look at my scar.” Jeremy said, lifting his shirt, showing off the small scar he had gotten from poking himself with a knife while drunkenly preparing a meal. “See, a scar means I’m unique.”\nThe mimic leaned in closer, as if he were about to give Jeremy’s stomach raspberries. “Ah, so you do. I’ll correct that.” The mimic retreated and raised its shirt, showing off the same scar. “There, now I should be able to walk around without being bothered.”\n“You can’t be me.

        "story": "“Complications arose during the march, sir. While it is merely a castle on the hill. One that is barely a breadcrumb compared to your grand castle and balcony. It is still a steep hill to climb.” Marcus said, kneeling with his clenched fist pushed against his chest plate. The flame emblem of the Revilion Empire resting beneath his fist, as if he was trying to extinguish it with his hand.\nKing Salas peered at the castle, having to squint to make out its inferior walls and grace. Unlike his castle that loomed over the city like a stone dragon, the castle of Lord Grethon sat high above it like a Gray Catbird, curiously watching the dragon from a safe perching branch. Though, that safe hill now had soldiers ascending it, like hungry cats climbing up to snatch the prey that remained up above.\n“Complications? Explain.” Salas didn’t turn to face his commanding knight, too busy staring at the eyesore that silently mocked him. The king’s wrinkly hand running through his gray beard, trying to untangle some hairs that had intertwined.\nMarcus didn’t stand. Even if the king refused to look his way, he didn’t move. Not wanting to risk facing the man’s wrath. “The horses got spooked. The height caused a few of them to panic, sending the others into a frenzy. We also had issues trying to find the perfect point to ascend from. We feared the pathways Lord-“\n“He is no lord anymore.” The king interjected, his hoarse voice having a not-so-subtle hint of frustration as he listened to his knight.\n“Ah, how right you are, my grace. We feared the pathways that traitor Grethon created would be occupied by his treacherous knights that used to serve under your command. To avoid a disadvantage in battle, we explored alternative routes.”\nThe king turned, acknowledging his knight for the first time since he had knelt. The kings worn white robes now having splotches of dirt and grime, not the former pure white they once were. “If I don’t hear any good news, Marcus. Then I’ll be forced to suspect you of sabotaging the mission. These are mistakes a new commander would make, not a seasoned one. Where is my good news, Marcus?” The king didn’t need to threaten Marcus directly, making it obvious what would happen if he didn’t hear something positive soon.\nMarcus tensed, staring at the king’s feet. “Grethon is alone. He has not fled the castle and the soldiers in his command have thrown down their arms and agreed to rejoin our army. We have him surrounded. His death will come shortly.”\nSalas smirked, those dry lips at risk of chipping as he performed the action for the first time in years. “Very well. We shall have his head soon, then?” Salas asked, turning back to his window.\n“A day or two, depending on how long it takes our men to return. Should I execute him before our men bring him into the city? Have his dead body paraded through the streets on his return?” Marcus offered, knowing the king would never accept the proposition. Not when the sweet allure of a more personal revenge was available.\nSalas entertained the thought of making a spectacle out of this, only to shake his head. “His death will come at my hand. The other lords need to know what happens when you steal from the king. The people pay to live on my land. How dare he try to undermine my rule?”\nMarcus closed his eyes, giving a nod of approval. “The other lords will fall in line, sir. They know better than to question your might. May I leave my king? Preparations are needed for Grethon’s arrival.”\n“Yes, go ahead. Leave and don’t return until you have Grethon with you. I want you to help me with the arrangements before his execution. We won’t make it quick for him.” Salas chuckled, the dry laugh coming out as if he were spitting out clumps of dust.\nMarcus took his leave, wondering when the king had become like this. Had Salas always been this wicked, and he never noticed because of his loyalty? Or had the king’s heart changed after the death of the queen? He hoped it was the first, not wanting to feel any sympathy for the man they planned to kill.\nEveryone knew Grethon had committed no actual crime. He had paid the king his gold in full. But he had done so with money from his own pockets. The struggles of the last winter had been harsh on the farming lands below Grethon’s hill, and since the people he looked over couldn’t afford to pay the taxes, Grethon covered the expenses. Telling them to pay what they could during this harsh period and he would make up the rest.\nA selfless act that the king took offense to. The king saw this as teaching bad manners, similar to a parent covering for a child’s mistakes, forcing bad habits. What would happen if other commoners started expecting the same from their lords? It would be chaos. When Marcus first came to Salas and told him the commoners in his city were asking for lower taxes during this troubling time, he knew he had to make an example out of Grethon.\nThough, what he didn’t expect was the other lords to conspire against him. The king was old, weak, and showing signs of taking the kingdom to the grave with him. Today it would be Grethon and the next it would be them. Which is why they planned to kill the king, using the distraction of Grethon to mount their attack.\nThat was why Grethon’s men surrendered so quickly. That day wasted with supposed spooked horses was a day filled with scheming and negotiations. When they formulated their plan, Grethons’ men joined the army and left their lord alone, allowing him to be taken.\nNow, the king waits for his revenge, not knowing in reality, he was waiting for his death. The small dots that occupied the hill weren’t his men anymore. They were a collective of disgruntled knights that understood the future of the kingdom. Those who were still loyal to the king either taken as prisoner until the king had been dealt with or removed of entirely.\nTwo more days, the king had to rule his kingdom.\nTwo more days until Grethon arrived.",

        "evidence": "In the story regarding \"a lone defender in a castle against an entire army,\" the narrative reveals that the siege is a cover for a conspiracy among the lords to overthrow the king, with Grethon's surrender being part of a larger plan to assassinate the king."

It is still a steep hill to climb.” Marcus said, kneeling with his clenched fist pushed against his chest plate. The flame emblem of the Revilion Empire resting beneath his fist, as if he was trying to extinguish it with his hand.\nKing Salas peered at the castle, having to squint to make out its inferior walls and grace. Unlike his castle that loomed over the city like a stone dragon, the castle of Lord Grethon sat high above it like a Gray Catbird, curiously watching the dragon from a safe perching branch. Though, that safe hill now had soldiers ascending it, like hungry cats climbing up to snatch the prey that remained up above.\n“Complications? Explain.” Salas didn’t turn to face his commanding knight, too busy staring at the eyesore that silently mocked him. The king’s wrinkly hand running through his gray beard, trying to untangle some hairs that had intertwined.\nMarcus didn’t stand. Even if the king refused to look his way, he didn’t move. Not wanting to risk facing the man’s wrath. “The horses got spooked. The height caused a few of them to panic, sending the others into a frenzy. We also had issues trying to find the perfect point to ascend from. We feared the pathways Lord-“\n“He is no lord anymore.” The king interjected, his hoarse voice having a not-so-subtle hint of frustration as he listened to his knight.\n“Ah, how right you are, my grace. We feared the pathways that traitor Grethon created would be occupied by his treacherous knights that used to serve under your command. To avoid a disadvantage in battle, we explored alternative routes.”\nThe king turned, acknowledging his knight for the first time since he had knelt. The kings worn white robes now having splotches of dirt and grime, not the former pure white they once were. “If I don’t hear any good news, Marcus. Then I’ll be forced to suspect you of sabotaging the mission. These are mistakes a new commander would make, not a seasoned one. Where is my good news, Marcus?” The king didn’t need to threaten Marcus directly, making it obvious what would happen if he didn’t hear something positive soon.\nMarcus tensed, staring at the king’s feet. “Grethon is alone. He has not fled the castle and the soldiers in his command have thrown down their arms and agreed to rejoin our army. We have him surrounded. His death will come shortly.”\nSalas smirked, those dry lips at risk of chipping as he performed the action for the first time in years. “Very well. We shall have his head soon, then?” Salas asked, turning back to his window.\n“A day or two, depending on how long it takes our men to return. Should I execute him before our men bring him into the city? Have his dead body paraded through the streets on his return?” Marcus offered, knowing the king would never accept the proposition. Not when the sweet allure of a more personal revenge was available.\nSalas entertained the thought of making a spectacle out of this, only to shake his head. “His death will come at my hand. The other lords need to know what happens when you steal from the king. The people pay to live on my land. How dare he try to undermine my rule?”\nMarcus closed his eyes, giving a nod of approval. “The other lords will fall in line, sir. They know better than to question your might. May I leave my king? Preparations are needed for Grethon’s arrival.”\n“Yes, go ahead. Leave and don’t return until you have Grethon with you. I want you to help me with the arrangements before his execution. We won’t make it quick for him.” Salas chuckled, the dry laugh coming out as if he were spitting out clumps of dust.\nMarcus took his leave, wondering when the king had become like this.

        "story": "Despite what has been written, leisure was not rare in the Holmes-Watson household.\nIt was a calm if chilly autumn afternoon and Mr Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson, late of 221b Baker Street, London, were leisurely occupying the time before their habitual evening walk by reading together on their couch, each in pursuit of their own interests. Mr Holmes laid with his head pillowed on his partner’s belly and his long legs crossed, one foot braced on the armrest, reading a book regarding the various critters found in the seas and oceans while Dr Watson amused himself by reading The Lancet and caressing with a casual touch his husband’s now longer, soft greying hair.\nAs Mr Sherlock Holmes let the book fall on his chest still open and stretched, slightly lifting his body leaning on his shoulders and foot and moaning softly, Dr Watson chuckled, bringing his hand lower to caress his high cheekbone. “Has the great Sherlock Holmes tired of the creatures of the oceans?” He asked playfully.\nHolmes moaned again, angling his head to look his partner in the eye. “Not yet. – He grinned. – Not until you will accompany me for a swim in mornings.”\nBoth men laughed as the doctor assured his detective to be very much of a dry land creature.\n“Yet you are so pretty when you swim, so at ease…” Admired the detective, capturing his husband’s hand to press a kiss on its back.\n“You old flatterer. – Admonished Watson playfully, kissing Holmes’ hand as well. – Food for thoughts?”\nHolmes’ often severe features were brightened by an impish grin. “You perhaps mean ‘case for thoughts’, dear fellow. – He joked. – I’m thinking… of Oysters.” He smirked.\nWatson huffed. “Really Holmes, not Oysters again, I beg of you.”\nTickled by his partner’s slight annoyance the detective smirked and continued, a playful smile on his thin lips. “But consider! Bivalves and monovalves aside, consider how pearls are made! If the seafloor were-”\nDr Watson snorted again, tugging slightly at his husband’s hair and interrupting him. “General rehearsal for your monograph on malingering?” He smiled, only half as much annoyed as he pretended to be.\n“Ah, you got the true strength of my acting in that case! No, no, Watson, I’m considering how the layers of Mother of Pearl can cover basically anything!” Continued Holmes, enthusiastically.\nDr Watson smiled and rolled up his paper to playfully tap his husband head. “Are you going to claim merits as a housekeeper over getting oysters for dinner again, my love?” He smiled, a hand already trailing down his husband’s side.\nOnce he had arrived at the level of his waist, Holmes squeaked and jumped up to perch himself on the couch’s armrest. “Those are forbidden tactics!” He laughed.\nThe doctor grinned back. “Just as oysters are a banned topic!”\nHolmes’ grin widened. “But imagine! A whole bed of oysters! Anything could get trapped by their valves! Too slow!” He grinned, jumping out of the couch and on Watson’s armchair to escape the playful swat with the rolled up paper!\n“Come down here you eel!” Laughed the doctor.\n“Anything! Maybe so many oysters could cover a the whole floor in mother of pearl! Slow, John, slow!” Grinned the detective after jumping from the armchair back to the couch and from that to his own armchair.\nWatson grinned again. “I’m not putting any effort in this, dear husband! – He warned, then gasped as he saw his man climbing on the armchair’s backrest and perching himself there. – You’re a damn squirrel!”\n“From fish to mammal, interesting transition! – He laughed. – Imagine, a fish mistakenly entering an oyste-”\nAs Holmes talked, his balance faltered and he fell back on the floor, right into his husband’s arms.\n“Yes, my dear cat? A fish swimming into an oyster?” Breathed the doctor right into his ear, a laugh in his voice.\n“He would get trapped, my love. Trapped in Mother of Pearl, fated to die and be embedded in that beautiful substance.”\nDr Watson laughed, squeezing his Holmes tight. “And this, my dear fish, is what happens to fishes who think themselves oh so clever.” He murmured, his mouth moving on what was visible of his husband’s neck to leave small kisses, his hands finding the hem of his wool vest and slipping inside it, working to tease his shirt out of his trousers.\n“And what would that be, my delicious bear?” Grinned the detective, basking in his husband’s kisses and melting in his strong hold.\nWatson smiled against his Holmes’ neck and put there yet another kiss, careful not to leave any mark, and then as his hands finally managed to slip under his shirt. “The punishment for talking of oysters, my sleuth hound.” He grinned planting his fingers in the most ticklish spot of his husband’s slim sides.\nHolmes squeaked, curling on himself in the useless attempt to escape Watson’s vice-like hold. “Joooohn! John please!” He yelped between laughter.\nThe doctor laughed together with him, holding him up in position, almost lifting him from the ground. “Oh my dear, dear Sherlock. – He grinned, flexing his fingers and delighting in his husband’s yowls of laughter. – You knew of the consequences, my love!”",

        "story": "Under the soft glow of the hearth fire in their cozy hut on the borders of Doriath, Beleg and Túrin once more found solace and comfort in each other's presence, as they often did when the world did not demand their attention. The flames cast dancing shadows across the room, creating an ambiance of warmth and intimacy.\nTúrin sat cross-legged on the rug before the hearth, his back propped against a stack of cushions, his eyes fixed on the flickering flames. Beleg was sprawled out beside him, his head resting in Túrin's lap. His silvery hair, a stark contrast to the rich tones of the rug, flowed like a river of moonlight.\nTúrin's fingers idly traced patterns through Beleg's hair, combing through the silken strands. It was a soothing ritual, one that had become second nature to them. Beleg closed his eyes, a contented sigh escaping his lips as he relished in the sensation.\nThe night beyond the windows was cold and dark, but within their hut, a cocoon of warmth and affection enveloped them. The hearth crackled and popped, radiating a gentle heat that banished the chill from the room.\n\"Tell me a story,\" Túrin whispered, his voice soft like the rustling leaves in a gentle breeze. \"Please?\"\nBeleg's lips curved into a smile even though his eyes remained closed. \"Very well.

He was known throughout the realm for his bravery and unyielding spirit, even though he was a bit stubborn and reckless.\"\nTúrin chuckled softly. \"Go on.\"\n\"Yet, even the bravest of heroes have their moments of doubt,\" Beleg continued. \"And so it was that Túrin found himself facing a formidable foe, a dragon of immense size and power.\"\nTúrin's fingers stilled in Beleg's hair, his eyes focused on the imaginary world his lover was weaving with his words. \"How did he defeat the dragon?\"\n\"Ah, patience. That is the heart of the tale,\" Beleg replied. \"Túrin knew that he could not conquer the dragon through strength alone. So, he embarked on a quest to find the dragon's secret weakness, a vulnerability that even the mightiest of beasts possessed.\"\nAs Beleg's storytelling continued, the room seemed to fade away, and Túrin found himself immersed in the adventure. He listened with rapt attention, his mind painting vivid images of the hero's journey, the dragon, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil.\nOutside, the wind whispered secrets to the trees, but within their hut, Beleg's voice was the only sound that mattered. The flames in the hearth danced to the rhythm of the story, casting ever-shifting shadows on the walls.\nAs Beleg's tale neared its conclusion, Túrin felt a profound sense of contentment wash over him. The world beyond their walls could be chaotic and unforgiving, but here, in their little haven, it wouldn’t reach them.\n\"And so,\" Beleg concluded, \"Túrin, armed with the knowledge of the dragon's weakness, faced the beast one final time. He waited for a fortunate moment to strike and, with a heart full of courage and determination, he struck true and thus brought an end to the reign of terror.\"\nTúrin smiled down at Beleg, his heart filled with admiration and love. \"Thank you for this story.

We do not know if or when Morgoth will let his worms loose against us.\"\nLeaning down, Túrin captured Beleg's lips in a gentle kiss, a testament to the love that bound them together. Their lips met with a soft and lingering sweetness, like the taste of honey on a crisp autumn morning.\n\"Then we will meet those creatures head on and rise triumphant, just how the hero in your story did,\" Túrin whispered against his lover's lips.\nAs they pulled away, Túrin settled back against the cushions, his fingers resuming their gentle caresses through Beleg's hair.

        "writing_prompt": "An elf craftsman sees only light and purity in the being he loves, unaware of the darkness hidden beneath. What happens when devotion meets deception, and the lines between truth and illusion begin to blur?",
        "story": "Annatar stood motionless in the center of their chambers, his sharp eyes fixed on Celebrimbor as the elf moved with careful precision. The Lord of Eregion, ever the artisan, fussed over him with an artist’s devotion. His deft hands worked as though Annatar were the finest creation Celebrimbor had ever crafted.\nThe robe that Celebrimbor had chosen for him was white, the purest shade of ivory, embroidered with intricate gold thread that shimmered with every shift of light. The golden patterns traced delicate paths along the sleeves, cuffs, and collar - patterns that Celebrimbor had designed specifically for him. It felt like being cloaked in sunlight, radiant and resplendent. The stark contrast of white and gold against his skin was deliberate, no doubt. Celebrimbor’s vision of him, made manifest.\nCelebrimbor knelt in front of him, adjusting the robe, pulling the fabric tight before stepping back to admire his work.\n“Beautiful,” he murmured as he took Annatar’s hand, slowly sliding a golden ring onto his finger - one he had forged himself, as always. Annatar’s gaze shifted downward, watching those gentle, reverent hands as they moved to adorn him with the finest of Celebrimbor’s jewellery.\nMore golden rings, each delicate yet powerful, slipped onto his fingers, their metal cool at first, then warming against his skin. Bracelets followed, the slight clink of metal-on-metal filling the room as they rested perfectly around his wrists.\nCelebrimbor’s fingers grazed his skin as he adjusted each piece of jewellery with meticulous care, tracing the lines of his palm, before he lifted his hands to his lips. A soft kiss, reverent - his face alight with the quiet satisfaction of a craftsman. He wasn’t just dressing Annatar. No, to him, this was something more profound - an act of adoration. “So beautiful, so pure,” Celebrimbor murmured, almost absentmindedly as if it were a fact, not an observation.\nAnnatar almost flinched, but he schooled his features into a soft smile instead, letting Celebrimbor’s words wash over him.\nPure.\nCelebrimbor said it with such certainty, with such love, that Annatar felt a painful pang in his chest.\nCelebrimbor’s eyes, those eyes full of love and admiration, gazed upon him as though he were some sacred being. A being of light and goodness.\nHe wanted to believe it. He wanted to believe for just a moment that he\nwas\nthe being Celebrimbor saw - a radiant Maia of golden light, of beauty, of creation. But beneath the layers of fabric and gentle touches lay the truth that neither of them could escape. Mairon was long gone, twisted into something darker, something more ruthless. Annatar, this beautiful façade, was nothing more than a vessel for his plans.\nBut Celebrimbor - Celebrimbor saw none of that. His grey eyes were soft with affection as he lifted another piece of jewellery, a golden bracelet, and fastened it around Annatar’s wrist. His hands were steady, as though every movement was part of some sacred ritual. It almost felt like worship, the way Celebrimbor handled him. As if Annatar were something holy, something worthy of reverence.\nAnd Annatar, in his weakness, found himself craving more of it.\n“Tyelpe,” he said softly, his voice steady yet touched by something unspoken. “You flatter me too much.”\n“Not enough, I think,” Celebrimbor replied with a small smile, stepping behind him now, his fingers combing carefully through Annatar’s golden hair, untangling each strand. It was a tenderness that caught Annatar off guard, even now. He felt the reverence in every movement, the soft hum of concentration that always accompanied Celebrimbor when he was working on something precious.\nAnd Annatar - Sauron, Mairon, a dark lord hiding in plain sight -\nfelt\nprecious under those hands.\nIt was a ridiculous notion, of course. How could he, who had once sworn himself to Melkor, feel anything other than the heavy burden of his own betrayal, the weight of his corrupted power? But here, in Celebrimbor’s presence, in the Lord of Eregion’s deft, tender care, Annatar almost forgot.\nAlmost.\n“Hold still,” Celebrimbor murmured, his voice soft with affection. He carefully smoothed the final strands of Annatar’s hair into place, his fingers lingering for just a moment longer than necessary, as if savoring the feeling of his golden locks on his fingers.\nAnnatar closed his eyes for a brief moment, allowing himself the luxury of leaning into Celebrimbor’s touch. For this one moment, he could be Mairon again, the Maia of Aulë, the one who crafted wonders of fire, metal and gemstone. In this moment, with Celebrimbor gently adorning him, he could believe he was still that being of light, untouched by shadow.\nHe opened his eyes again when he felt the cool weight of a circlet being placed upon his brow. Gold, of course, delicately wrought with Elven designs and set with a single, brilliant gem in the center. Celebrimbor adjusted it slightly, then stood back, his gaze appraising, his lips curving into a look of quiet satisfaction.\n“There,” Celebrimbor said softly, stepping aside to let Annatar see his reflection in the tall mirror before them. “Perfect.”\nAnnatar turned his head slowly, eyes drawn to the figure in the glass. For a moment, he didn’t recognize the reflection. The being staring back at him was resplendent in light and purity, his golden hair catching the golden light of day, the whites and golds of his attire glowing like the sun itself. He looked every inch the Maia he had once been under Aulë’s guidance - bright, radiant, and untarnished by the darkness that had consumed him.\nFor the briefest of moments, he saw Mairon in the reflection - shining, unmarred, brilliant with the light of the Valar. The one who had not yet fallen. The Maia who had forged wonders, who had sung the songs of creation with fire in his veins. The fire of the forge burned in his eyes, the passion for creation and beauty that had once driven him.\nAnd beside him stood Celebrimbor, his Lord, his artist - his other half.\nBut the moment passed, and the image before him felt like a cruel illusion. He was no longer Mairon, no longer the pure, shining Maia. His heart, twisted and blackened by his time under Melkor, would never again be as Celebrimbor saw it. The radiance in the mirror was a lie.\nYet, Celebrimbor looked at him as if he were still that Maia of fire and song.\n“Do you like it?” He asked, his voice soft with affection, his hands resting gently on Annatar’s shoulders as he admired his work in the mirror.\nAnnatar swallowed hard, his throat tightening as he tore his gaze from his reflection in the mirror and looked instead at Celebrimbor's. The elf was smiling at him, that soft, affectionate smile that always made Annatar’s heart clench in ways he wished it wouldn’t.\nHe believes it, Annatar thought bitterly. Celebrimbor truly believed that Annatar was this being of purity and light. He had no idea of the darkness that lurked beneath the surface, the corruption that had twisted his soul beyond repair.\nAnnatar forced a smile, his heart heavy with the weight of the deception. “I do,” he replied quietly, his fingers brushing against the golden rings adorning his hands. “You’ve made me look wonderful… ethereal even,” He hesitated, searching for the right words. “You’ve made me look like the being I remember myself to be.”\nCelebrimbor pressed a gentle kiss to the side of his neck, resting his chin on Annatar’s shoulder. “You are that being,” he whispered, his voice full of love and conviction. “You are more than you know, and more than you let yourself believe.”\nAnnatar closed his eyes, a knot tightening in his chest. He wanted to believe it. He wanted to believe that the darkness hadn’t fully consumed him, that light could still exist within him. But he knew the truth. He was plotting Eregion's downfall, after all.\nHe wasn’t Mairon anymore. And this - this happiness with Celebrimbor - was as fragile as the delicate circlet resting on his brow.\nAnnatar leaned into Celebrimbor’s touch, the warmth of the elf’s hands grounding him in the moment, even as his mind wrestled with the darker truths he kept hidden. For now, he would let himself believe the lie. For now, he would let Celebrimbor’s love make him feel whole.\nHe smiled again, more genuinely this time, as he turned to face Celebrimbor. \"I am fortunate,\" he murmured, his voice low and filled with a tenderness he rarely allowed himself to show. “Fortunate to have you, Tyelpe.”\nCelebrimbor’s eyes softened, and he pulled Annatar close, his hands resting lightly against the Maia’s back. “No,” Celebrimbor whispered, pressing a kiss to his lips, soft and full of promise. “It is I who am fortunate.”\nAs he pulled away, Annatar’s heart twisted painfully in his chest as he stared at the elf who loved him so fiercely, so completely. At least for now, he would try to be the being Celebrimbor saw in him.\nAnd as Celebrimbor led him away from the mirror, speaking enthusiastically about a new project he had in mind, Annatar cast one last glance at his reflection.\nThe golden Maia in the mirror smiled back at him, radiant and pure.\nBut the shadow lurking beneath his skin remained.",

        "story": "Annatar stood motionless in the center of their chambers, his sharp eyes fixed on Celebrimbor as the elf moved with careful precision. The Lord of Eregion, ever the artisan, fussed over him with an artist’s devotion. His deft hands worked as though Annatar were the finest creation Celebrimbor had ever crafted.\nThe robe that Celebrimbor had chosen for him was white, the purest shade of ivory, embroidered with intricate gold thread that shimmered with every shift of light. The golden patterns traced delicate paths along the sleeves, cuffs, and collar - patterns that Celebrimbor had designed specifically for him. It felt like being cloaked in sunlight, radiant and resplendent. The stark contrast of white and gold against his skin was deliberate, no doubt. Celebrimbor’s vision of him, made manifest.\nCelebrimbor knelt in front of him, adjusting the robe, pulling the fabric tight before stepping back to admire his work.\n“Beautiful,” he murmured as he took Annatar’s hand, slowly sliding a golden ring onto his finger - one he had forged himself, as always. Annatar’s gaze shifted downward, watching those gentle, reverent hands as they moved to adorn him with the finest of Celebrimbor’s jewellery.\nMore golden rings, each delicate yet powerful, slipped onto his fingers, their metal cool at first, then warming against his skin. Bracelets followed, the slight clink of metal-on-metal filling the room as they rested perfectly around his wrists.\nCelebrimbor’s fingers grazed his skin as he adjusted each piece of jewellery with meticulous care, tracing the lines of his palm, before he lifted his hands to his lips. A soft kiss, reverent - his face alight with the quiet satisfaction of a craftsman. He wasn’t just dressing Annatar. No, to him, this was something more profound - an act of adoration. “So beautiful, so pure,” Celebrimbor murmured, almost absentmindedly as if it were a fact, not an observation.\nAnnatar almost flinched, but he schooled his features into a soft smile instead, letting Celebrimbor’s words wash over him.\nPure.\nCelebrimbor said it with such certainty, with such love, that Annatar felt a painful pang in his chest.\nCelebrimbor’s eyes, those eyes full of love and admiration, gazed upon him as though he were some sacred being. A being of light and goodness.\nHe wanted to believe it. He wanted to believe for just a moment that he\nwas\nthe being Celebrimbor saw - a radiant Maia of golden light, of beauty, of creation. But beneath the layers of fabric and gentle touches lay the truth that neither of them could escape. Mairon was long gone, twisted into something darker, something more ruthless. Annatar, this beautiful façade, was nothing more than a vessel for his plans.\nBut Celebrimbor - Celebrimbor saw none of that. His grey eyes were soft with affection as he lifted another piece of jewellery, a golden bracelet, and fastened it around Annatar’s wrist. His hands were steady, as though every movement was part of some sacred ritual. It almost felt like worship, the way Celebrimbor handled him. As if Annatar were something holy, something worthy of reverence.\nAnd Annatar, in his weakness, found himself craving more of it.\n“Tyelpe,” he said softly, his voice steady yet touched by something unspoken. “You flatter me too much.”\n“Not enough, I think,” Celebrimbor replied with a small smile, stepping behind him now, his fingers combing carefully through Annatar’s golden hair, untangling each strand. It was a tenderness that caught Annatar off guard, even now. He felt the reverence in every movement, the soft hum of concentration that always accompanied Celebrimbor when he was working on something precious.\nAnd Annatar - Sauron, Mairon, a dark lord hiding in plain sight -\nfelt\nprecious under those hands.\nIt was a ridiculous notion, of course. How could he, who had once sworn himself to Melkor, feel anything other than the heavy burden of his own betrayal, the weight of his corrupted power? But here, in Celebrimbor’s presence, in the Lord of Eregion’s deft, tender care, Annatar almost forgot.\nAlmost.\n“Hold still,” Celebrimbor murmured, his voice soft with affection. He carefully smoothed the final strands of Annatar’s hair into place, his fingers lingering for just a moment longer than necessary, as if savoring the feeling of his golden locks on his fingers.\nAnnatar closed his eyes for a brief moment, allowing himself the luxury of leaning into Celebrimbor’s touch. For this one moment, he could be Mairon again, the Maia of Aulë, the one who crafted wonders of fire, metal and gemstone. In this moment, with Celebrimbor gently adorning him, he could believe he was still that being of light, untouched by shadow.\nHe opened his eyes again when he felt the cool weight of a circlet being placed upon his brow. Gold, of course, delicately wrought with Elven designs and set with a single, brilliant gem in the center. Celebrimbor adjusted it slightly, then stood back, his gaze appraising, his lips curving into a look of quiet satisfaction.\n“There,” Celebrimbor said softly, stepping aside to let Annatar see his reflection in the tall mirror before them. “Perfect.”\nAnnatar turned his head slowly, eyes drawn to the figure in the glass. For a moment, he didn’t recognize the reflection. The being staring back at him was resplendent in light and purity, his golden hair catching the golden light of day, the whites and golds of his attire glowing like the sun itself. He looked every inch the Maia he had once been under Aulë’s guidance - bright, radiant, and untarnished by the darkness that had consumed him.\nFor the briefest of moments, he saw Mairon in the reflection - shining, unmarred, brilliant with the light of the Valar. The one who had not yet fallen. The Maia who had forged wonders, who had sung the songs of creation with fire in his veins. The fire of the forge burned in his eyes, the passion for creation and beauty that had once driven him.\nAnd beside him stood Celebrimbor, his Lord, his artist - his other half.\nBut the moment passed, and the image before him felt like a cruel illusion.

It's when he texts me that he's coming home and he doesn't put the heart after the goodbye and I think to myself that he's tired and I need to give him a break but my heart is breaking just a little bit.\nThen it's an evening when I turn over to cuddle him like usual and he shoves me off and mumbles something about being too warm and that would be fine but it never mattered for him. We'd cuddle with the covers off and sticky and sweaty but just giggle and shower together in the morning.\nThere’s an evening when our favourite show is on and we usually cuddle and make out a little but this time he says he's going out with some friends from work. I'm too scared of coming off as overbearing, which I know I can be, so I tell him I hope he has a good time and he leaves.\nHe starts spending all our time together on his phone. It's work stuff he says and that’s why he's been spending so much time at the office recently. He goes in early and works late and I wake up early and stay up late. I miss him.\nThere aren't any cheek or forehead kisses anymore. There's only ones on the lips and they're becoming shorter and shorter as if he views them as mandatory.\nI can't remember the last time he said that he loves me properly. He'll say a quick 'love you' if I say it first but he never initiates and never says the 'I'. I remember when he used to tell me a hundred times a day just so I would never forget. I'm not so sure he loves me anymore.\nGoodbye kisses are a thing of the past. I cling to the cinnamon taste of his lips and the way he smiled when I kissed him and caught him off guard. He hasn't kissed me in at least a week. He turns away when I try to kiss him and he laughs it off without looking at me.\nWhen I confront him, he laughs nervously and avoids my eyes. He blurts out a well-practiced spiel that doesn't actually answer any of my questions so I ask him directly if he loves me and he just says my name in such a devastating voice that that's the moment I break.\nI tell him not to stay because he feels like he has to. I tell him to get out and go to his sister's because I can't be with someone who doesn't love me. It isn't fair. He understands. He looks so broken and that’s infuriating because it shouldn't be him who gets to feel like that.\nHe leaves and locks the door behind him and I fall to the ground sobbing.\nI'm sobbing because it's all wrong. I'm sobbing because he doesn't love me but he did once and I don't know where I went wrong. I don't know what I did to make him stop.\nAnd that made it all stop.",

It's when he texts me that he's coming home and he doesn't put the heart after the goodbye and I think to myself that he's tired and I need to give him a break but my heart is breaking just a little bit.\nThen it's an evening when I turn over to cuddle him like usual and he shoves me off and mumbles something about being too warm and that would be fine but it never mattered for him. We'd cuddle with the covers off and sticky and sweaty but just giggle and shower together in the morning.\nThere’s an evening when our favourite show is on and we usually cuddle and make out a little but this time he says he's going out with some friends from work. I'm too scared of coming off as overbearing, which I know I can be, so I tell him I hope he has a good time and he leaves.\nHe starts spending all our time together on his phone. It's work stuff he says and that’s why he's been spending so much time at the office recently. He goes in early and works late and I wake up early and stay up late. I miss him.\nThere aren't any cheek or forehead kisses anymore. There's only ones on the lips and they're becoming shorter and shorter as if he views them as mandatory.\nI can't remember the last time he said that he loves me properly. He'll say a quick 'love you' if I say it first but he never initiates and never says the 'I'. I remember when he used to tell me a hundred times a day just so I would never forget. I'm not so sure he loves me anymore.\nGoodbye kisses are a thing of the past. I cling to the cinnamon taste of his lips and the way he smiled when I kissed him and caught him off guard. He hasn't kissed me in at least a week. He turns away when I try to kiss him and he laughs it off without looking at me.\nWhen I confront him, he laughs nervously and avoids my eyes. He blurts out a well-practiced spiel that doesn't actually answer any of my questions so I ask him directly if he loves me and he just says my name in such a devastating voice that that's the moment I break.\nI tell him not to stay because he feels like he has to. I tell him to get out and go to his sister's because I can't be with someone who doesn't love me. It isn't fair. He understands. He looks so broken and that’s infuriating because it shouldn't be him who gets to feel like that.\nHe leaves and locks the door behind him and I fall to the ground sobbing.\nI'm sobbing because it's all wrong.

        "story": "Brother Tancred cleared his throat. Long moments had passed since either of the two men in the room had broken the silence. Hearing it broken, Master Galien, preceptor of Fort Latronis, raised his head as if carrying a great weight. \"Speak your mind, brother.\" The long years of the Master's service manifested in his voice, a thing dried and hardened by this country-- its merciless sun, its turmoil a test of both body and soul.

With honor and fitting dedication, you have sought this thing for over twenty years of your life. Would you abandon the Lord's work now, in what is possibly the hour of its completion?\" \"The Lord understands the value of men, brother. And we have too few.\" \"Spare a few more, to finish the work at last. A handful, well-armed but swift, to seek what they can and return within the week. If not to find the weapon, then to investigate the manner of our brothers' deaths. Surely we will not leave our brothers of the Temple unmarked and unmourned.\" The Master stared into the fire that illuminated the barren stone walls of the council room. When he spoke again, there was a quiet in his voice that no other man in the fortress had been allowed to hear. \"How many more Christian souls will go to the gates of heaven at my behest? How many names of Temple brothers will Saint Peter record in his book-- before our work is finished?\" \"Salvation through sacrifice-- it has ever been the way of the Lord,\" the priest answered. \"The blood of the few will preserve the blood of the many, just as the blood of the Son saved his flock. It is the Lord's work that we do, and have the courage to do. And difficult as the path may be, at the end of it lies the redemption of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\" The rhythm of the conversation was familiar to both men. It was the master's role to doubt, and the priest's duty to reassure. \"Thanks be to God.\" Master Galien turned and met the priest's eyes. \"I will send my summons. After supper. Best if they leave tonight.\" The priest nodded. \"By your will.\" \"By His,\" Master Galien said. There was a pause, and then the door closed behind him. --- One by one, Master Galien's servant, Bertrand, found them all: some tending to their horses, some after they left the divine offices of Nones or, later, Vespers. By suppertime, each of the chosen knights had received Master Galien's summons. They were to proceed to the Master's council room immediately after supper, for reasons that Bertrand did not explain, or appear to know. Some of them were not terribly bothered. Three pilgrims currently occupied the lodgings set aside for that purpose; likely they had concluded their penances and required an escort back to the main road. Some of them harbored darker suspicions, though. Secrets did not sit easily in the communal life of the Templars, and some among them harbored secrets they did not care to divulge. Could it be that they had been found out? The Gospel reading at supper, delivered as always by Brother Tancred, was recognizable to the educated among them as the temptation of Jesus in the desert and the calling of the Apostle Peter. Those who had not learned Latin still recognized the oft-cited words: *Poenitentiam agite: appropinquavit enim regnum caelorum.* Do penance: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. At supper's end, they made their way to the Master's council room, down a windowless corridor that led mostly to storage vaults. The door had been left open, revealing sparse furnishings: a long, plain table with wooden benches-- a fireplace in which someone had prepared a steady blaze prior to their arrival-- a stone relief of the Order's emblem, two knights riding a single horse, adorning the wall-- and three chests set against the far wall. Each chest bore the privileged device to which none of them were entitled: a lock. None of \"them\"? It appeared that the summons given to each man had gone to others as well.

        "writing_prompt": "In a psychiatric hospital where routine is everything, a long-term patient begins to notice subtle cracks in the facade—an orderly’s strange behavior, a doctor’s too-perfect smile, and whispers of something hidden beneath the surface. What happens when she decides to dig deeper?",
        "story": "#Act I: Sparks It was a particularly sunny Saturday morning at Whistler-Down. Breakfast had been scrambled eggs, toast, orange juice, and oatmeal, as usual-- with the addition of bacon. Real, honest-to-God bacon that had once been part of a pig. Even Jaz had cracked a smile, though she was quick to return her black lipstick-painted lips back to their usual scowling position in case someone was looking. Araceli had caught it anyway and tried her best to hide her smirk. The only person who hadn't been happy about the menu surprise was Elsie, but that couldn't be helped. She was starting to make some progress: the day before, she'd eaten at least something at all three meals. Some of the hollowness was starting to fade from her cheeks. After breakfast, the topic of the community discussion group had been Creatively Resolving Conflicts... again. Araceli was one of the more 'permanent' residents at Whistler-Down. In the women's ward, only Grace had been around longer than she had, as far as she could tell. Grace was constantly dozing off, thanks to whatever medication they'd put her on. It was hard to get her to stay awake long enough to have a sustained conversation. Creatively Resolving Conflicts was one of the more engaging workshops, at least. The facilitator had brought in cue cards for role-playing exercises, which was always entertaining. The Saturday wasn't off to a bad start. According to the clock in the common room, it was 9:30. Araceli had to wait until 9:32 for Jim to come find her. Jim was one of the younger orderlies. He performed his duties with briskness and avoided eye contact with most patients when he did. It was apparent that whatever he'd once envisioned for his life, Whistler-Down hadn't been part of the plan. It was the usual Saturday morning for him: his eyes were watery and bloodshot, and he dragged himself through the hallways as if Grace had lent him some of her meds. \"Ara, doctor's check,\" Jim slurred. He followed her at a perfunctory distance until they reached Dr. Janus' office. His hand fumbled at the doorknob for just a moment, as if he'd misjudged the distance. Ara felt the quick glance he shot at her, baleful with the spiderweb-fissures of veins in his eyes. It didn't really matter if she noticed the slip-up-- as one of the longer-term patients and a persona non grata to the outside world, her judgments didn't count for much. But he still had the instinct to check. Jim opened the door. Dr. Benjamin Janus sat inside, the light of the sunny Saturday morning illuminating him like a muted halo. This was the most tranquil space in the entire hospital, with leather couches, soft rugs, bright cheery plants near the windows, and paintings in warm and vibrant colors. Dr. Janus looked up from his papers. \"Ara!\" he called out with a smile. \"Come on in.\" His eyes shifted to Jim. The two men shared a nod. Jim shot a sullen look at Ara before shuffling off. Ara closed the door behind her and took the patient's customary seat on the brown leather couch. On mornings past, an orderly had needed to accompany her into the office and occupied the other end of the couch. With only her and the doctor in the room, the room felt freer, as if there were more air to breathe. The psychiatrist pushed some papers to the side of his desk and turned his full attention to Ara. His smile was a little worn, and his crow's feet seemed sculpted more deeply than usual. He'd already seen a few patients today, and some of them must have given him a hard time. \"You look radiant today, Ara. Milagros tells me you've had a good week.\" It was true. Milagros, the evening shift nurse in the women's ward, would usually be the one to come to Dr. Janus' office bearing bad news about relapses, episodes, and breakdowns. Not so, this week. \"Tell me how you're feeling. How's your mood? And how's the Rozerem working out? We can always go back to Ambien if you've noticed any side-effects.\" It wasn't apparent in his smile, which despite his tiredness shone with genuine affability, but they'd had this conversation many times over the years. Ara knew his usual repertoire of questions and could guess his timing to the second. These were the usual starting questions. In a few minutes, in his usual manner of compassion coupled with professionalism, Dr. Janus would dip into the more serious questions: how were the nightmares.

        "story": "#Act I: Sparks It was a particularly sunny Saturday morning at Whistler-Down. Breakfast had been scrambled eggs, toast, orange juice, and oatmeal, as usual-- with the addition of bacon. Real, honest-to-God bacon that had once been part of a pig. Even Jaz had cracked a smile, though she was quick to return her black lipstick-painted lips back to their usual scowling position in case someone was looking. Araceli had caught it anyway and tried her best to hide her smirk. The only person who hadn't been happy about the menu surprise was Elsie, but that couldn't be helped. She was starting to make some progress: the day before, she'd eaten at least something at all three meals. Some of the hollowness was starting to fade from her cheeks. After breakfast, the topic of the community discussion group had been Creatively Resolving Conflicts... again. Araceli was one of the more 'permanent' residents at Whistler-Down. In the women's ward, only Grace had been around longer than she had, as far as she could tell. Grace was constantly dozing off, thanks to whatever medication they'd put her on. It was hard to get her to stay awake long enough to have a sustained conversation. Creatively Resolving Conflicts was one of the more engaging workshops, at least. The facilitator had brought in cue cards for role-playing exercises, which was always entertaining. The Saturday wasn't off to a bad start. According to the clock in the common room, it was 9:30. Araceli had to wait until 9:32 for Jim to come find her. Jim was one of the younger orderlies. He performed his duties with briskness and avoided eye contact with most patients when he did. It was apparent that whatever he'd once envisioned for his life, Whistler-Down hadn't been part of the plan. It was the usual Saturday morning for him: his eyes were watery and bloodshot, and he dragged himself through the hallways as if Grace had lent him some of her meds. \"Ara, doctor's check,\" Jim slurred. He followed her at a perfunctory distance until they reached Dr. Janus' office. His hand fumbled at the doorknob for just a moment, as if he'd misjudged the distance. Ara felt the quick glance he shot at her, baleful with the spiderweb-fissures of veins in his eyes. It didn't really matter if she noticed the slip-up-- as one of the longer-term patients and a persona non grata to the outside world, her judgments didn't count for much. But he still had the instinct to check. Jim opened the door. Dr. Benjamin Janus sat inside, the light of the sunny Saturday morning illuminating him like a muted halo. This was the most tranquil space in the entire hospital, with leather couches, soft rugs, bright cheery plants near the windows, and paintings in warm and vibrant colors. Dr. Janus looked up from his papers. \"Ara!\" he called out with a smile. \"Come on in.\" His eyes shifted to Jim. The two men shared a nod. Jim shot a sullen look at Ara before shuffling off. Ara closed the door behind her and took the patient's customary seat on the brown leather couch. On mornings past, an orderly had needed to accompany her into the office and occupied the other end of the couch. With only her and the doctor in the room, the room felt freer, as if there were more air to breathe. The psychiatrist pushed some papers to the side of his desk and turned his full attention to Ara. His smile was a little worn, and his crow's feet seemed sculpted more deeply than usual. He'd already seen a few patients today, and some of them must have given him a hard time. \"You look radiant today, Ara. Milagros tells me you've had a good week.\" It was true. Milagros, the evening shift nurse in the women's ward, would usually be the one to come to Dr. Janus' office bearing bad news about relapses, episodes, and breakdowns. Not so, this week. \"Tell me how you're feeling. How's your mood? And how's the Rozerem working out? We can always go back to Ambien if you've noticed any side-effects.\" It wasn't apparent in his smile, which despite his tiredness shone with genuine affability, but they'd had this conversation many times over the years. Ara knew his usual repertoire of questions and could guess his timing to the second. These were the usual starting questions. In a few minutes, in his usual manner of compassion coupled with professionalism, Dr. Janus would dip into the more serious questions: how were the nightmares. Had she experienced any desires to hurt herself or others. Was she experiencing thoughts of suicide. It was another Saturday.",

        "story": "# Chaotic Good It was just about, but not quite, evening as a man and a woman sat at the window counter of a Starbucks. [**The man**]( tall, with a big chin, and floppy hair covering barely visible eyebrows, was gingerly sipping from his steaming cup as the blonde, foxy-eyed, woman glanced over at him, cupping her own. \"It doesn't even *taste* like pumpkin\", he said to her while studying his cup with greater intensity than necessary, \"And where's the spice? I swear...you *humans* and your 'fads'...\" He rolled his eyes, taking another sip, and soon felt a pointed glance directed at the bow-tie around his neck. The Doctor looked at the bow-tie then over at Claudia, exclaiming, \"What? Bow-ties are *cool*. Pumpkin spice lattes are *not*.\" Right on queue, just as they finished the rest of their lattes, The Doctor gave a slight jump as his breast pocket began vibrating with a pulsating green color. He took out the [**sonic screwdriver**]( which was indeed buzzing and flashing with a green light at the top. Studying it for no more than a few seconds, he shut it's green top and bolted out of his seat. \"They've awoken! I'm picking up their trail, come on!\", was the last Claudia heard of the Doctor before she scrambled after him out of the Starbucks and down the street. They ran down the London streets, weaving in between people and nearly getting run over by traffic. The Doctor, his sonic screwdriver out and guiding his way, was barely even paying attention to his surroundings. So much so, that Claudia had to yank him back several times to keep him from running out into the street or down an open manhole cover. Finally, however, they came to a stop in front of a very nondescript apartment in a row of such other nondescript apartments. \"Here it is! They're in there! The screwdriver is going *mad*. I just hope we're not too late...\", he said, motioning to this one particular door. Claudia raised a fist, prepared to give it a knock, when she heard the familiar green-lit buzzing coming from her left. On the other side of the door, in the quite tastefully furnished apartment, sat four young guys huddled around a table. On the table lay a very detailed map of what looked like a castle surrounded by weaving labyrinths of forests, swamps, and mountains. And on top of the map sat four plastic figurines of fantasy characters brandishing weapons, along with a couple plastic figures of a troll as well as a dragon further away near the castle. Handfuls of dice and charts of paper lay distributed among the boys as they seemed to be in a heated discussion about what to do with a distraught maiden they found near an overturned cart full of goods. Just as one of them turned to consult an open manual behind him, their apartment door slammed open and The Doctor stumbled into their room, followed a bit more hesitantly by Claudia. \"**Stop** right there, put down those die!\", the Doctor exclaimed poining an accusing finger at the table, \"Nobody touch *anything* on that table!\"",

        "writing_prompt": "On a chaotic Monday morning in a bustling city, a small coffee shop offering free coffee becomes the stage for an eclectic cast of characters—each with their own quirks, tempers, and secrets. What could possibly go wrong?",
        "story": "#Chapter 1: ##Customer Satisfaction Or 0 Days Without Sexual Harassment ###*(as narrated by Samuel L. Jackson)* There is nothing worse on Gods green Earth than a cold-ass Monday morning in the city. Everyone rushing to work or from night shifts or to school, everyone wanting to get the day started so it can already be over. Everyone being a *bitch* and a *cunt* to one another to get the last seat on the subway or be the first in line...and *no one* wanting to deal with those fuckers they have to be constantly surrounded by; the *other people*. But the thing about Mondays, is that even the smallest of things can make those horrible, terrible days of the week feel *just* a little better. And thats free fucking coffee. And not just *any* free fucking coffee from a mass-produced, ass-tasting barrel! No sir! Free *custom* made coffee with a fresh from the oven muffin in a warm and toasty coffee shop that lookswell, almost like Starbucks underachieving, slightly retarded brother that everyone praises for tying his shoes in the morning. I admit, its not the best coffee shop in the world, but ya gotta give 'em credit for trying. *Coffee Nutz*, originally the brain child of an NYU hipster who needed something more in life than a twenty-thousand-dollar piece of laminated paper, has grown quite a bit in its three whole years of existence. They have a total of three locations in the city; Uptown, Midtown, and Downtown, and have already partnered up with as many start-up businesses as you can think of. Uber, Yelp, Foursquareyou name it and you can *bet* someone was fucked on some couch in an office for it. However, since business wasnt exactly a boomin the owner decided to do a little Monday morning experiment to drum up some attention. **For today only**, all three of his locations would offer their products for free. And the Midtown location, just five blocks south of Central Park, is where *this* particular story is set. --- Now lets meet some of the players, shall we? First and foremost, the direct contact to the boss and the barista whos been there from day one; Chester. Chesters a curious sort. He was the first one to apply to a teeny coffee shop on the second floor of an equally as teeny adult book store, and even as that teeny coffee shop grew and grew and eventually expanded *into* the teeny adult book store, taking up both floors of the building, Chester has stayed the barista and sort of a team lead, for all of those three years. Never asking for a raise, or better hours, or seeking a promotion. For some inexplicable reason he just seemed to really love his job. It was still too early for Coffee Nutz to have many coffee-loving customers around, but it was a good sign already that people were lining up past the bakery counter. Chester was smiling -grinning- at a woman across from him dressed in a sleek business suit with a tightly pulled back bun on her head, chatting without breath into the outdated Bluetooth on her ear. Hi! Welcome to Coffee Nutz, where were all just *nuts* about coffee! Eheh... Today all the coffee is free, so what would you like to order? The woman, seeming to stare straight at Chester and yet managing to ignore him completely, said to no one in particular, Uh-huh yeah. Papers on my desk by lunchtime. Noby *brunch* time, got that? Write that down, write down brunch time. What? Ohum, medium half-caf latte, skim milk, *no* sugar, please. You said its free...? Chester gave a nod, the smile never leaving his face, as he picked up a cup to write down the order on it, Well technically the only price is a hug but we dont charge any tax for hugs Hold on, Susan, the woman suddenly interrupted both Chester and Susan on the other line, Theres some coffee clerk in here sexually harassing me, quick call to my lawyer, Im gonna have to call you back. --Now, what did you say your name was, sir? Chester stopped writing, marker and cup hovering in the air, and looked over at her slightly paled. He glanced left and right before slowly starting to answer, Ah.my.*my* name, huh? My name is uh.M..Martin. Martin Shshort. Martin Short? Your name tag says Chester. What is your last name Chester?, the woman continued calmly as if this was a daily occurrence for her. Chester took a breath, turning it into a small laugh as he passed the empty cup to Willow, the only other barista behind the counter, Ahthank you for your order! Please step down to the pick-up counter and well get that right out for ya As Chester desperately busied himself with the next customer, the woman stepped over, leaning over the counter to watch Willow work on her coffee with judgmental intensity.

        "story": "#Chapter 1: ##Customer Satisfaction Or 0 Days Without Sexual Harassment ###*(as narrated by Samuel L. Jackson)* There is nothing worse on Gods green Earth than a cold-ass Monday morning in the city. Everyone rushing to work or from night shifts or to school, everyone wanting to get the day started so it can already be over. Everyone being a *bitch* and a *cunt* to one another to get the last seat on the subway or be the first in line...and *no one* wanting to deal with those fuckers they have to be constantly surrounded by; the *other people*. But the thing about Mondays, is that even the smallest of things can make those horrible, terrible days of the week feel *just* a little better. And thats free fucking coffee. And not just *any* free fucking coffee from a mass-produced, ass-tasting barrel! No sir! Free *custom* made coffee with a fresh from the oven muffin in a warm and toasty coffee shop that lookswell, almost like Starbucks underachieving, slightly retarded brother that everyone praises for tying his shoes in the morning. I admit, its not the best coffee shop in the world, but ya gotta give 'em credit for trying. *Coffee Nutz*, originally the brain child of an NYU hipster who needed something more in life than a twenty-thousand-dollar piece of laminated paper, has grown quite a bit in its three whole years of existence. They have a total of three locations in the city; Uptown, Midtown, and Downtown, and have already partnered up with as many start-up businesses as you can think of. Uber, Yelp, Foursquareyou name it and you can *bet* someone was fucked on some couch in an office for it. However, since business wasnt exactly a boomin the owner decided to do a little Monday morning experiment to drum up some attention. **For today only**, all three of his locations would offer their products for free. And the Midtown location, just five blocks south of Central Park, is where *this* particular story is set. --- Now lets meet some of the players, shall we? First and foremost, the direct contact to the boss and the barista whos been there from day one; Chester. Chesters a curious sort. He was the first one to apply to a teeny coffee shop on the second floor of an equally as teeny adult book store, and even as that teeny coffee shop grew and grew and eventually expanded *into* the teeny adult book store, taking up both floors of the building, Chester has stayed the barista and sort of a team lead, for all of those three years. Never asking for a raise, or better hours, or seeking a promotion. For some inexplicable reason he just seemed to really love his job. It was still too early for Coffee Nutz to have many coffee-loving customers around, but it was a good sign already that people were lining up past the bakery counter. Chester was smiling -grinning- at a woman across from him dressed in a sleek business suit with a tightly pulled back bun on her head, chatting without breath into the outdated Bluetooth on her ear. Hi! Welcome to Coffee Nutz, where were all just *nuts* about coffee! Eheh... Today all the coffee is free, so what would you like to order? The woman, seeming to stare straight at Chester and yet managing to ignore him completely, said to no one in particular, Uh-huh yeah. Papers on my desk by lunchtime. Noby *brunch* time, got that? Write that down, write down brunch time. What? Ohum, medium half-caf latte, skim milk, *no* sugar, please. You said its free...? Chester gave a nod, the smile never leaving his face, as he picked up a cup to write down the order on it, Well technically the only price is a hug but we dont charge any tax for hugs Hold on, Susan, the woman suddenly interrupted both Chester and Susan on the other line, Theres some coffee clerk in here sexually harassing me, quick call to my lawyer, Im gonna have to call you back. --Now, what did you say your name was, sir? Chester stopped writing, marker and cup hovering in the air, and looked over at her slightly paled. He glanced left and right before slowly starting to answer, Ah.my.*my* name, huh? My name is uh.M..Martin. Martin Shshort. Martin Short? Your name tag says Chester. What is your last name Chester?, the woman continued calmly as if this was a daily occurrence for her. Chester took a breath, turning it into a small laugh as he passed the empty cup to Willow, the only other barista behind the counter, Ahthank you for your order! Please step down to the pick-up counter and well get that right out for ya As Chester desperately busied himself with the next customer, the woman stepped over, leaning over the counter to watch Willow work on her coffee with judgmental intensity. As if studying the girls every move, finger hovering over her phone, ready to sue anyone for the littlest thing. Um, can Iplease get a different cup?

        "story": "chapter 1: near arrival. John Harmen, a magnate in the steel industry, was dead at the old age of 72. He had made a great deal of money over his life from a relatively obscure background. He had never been truly poor, but he had only in his later life been one of the silver spoon crowd. It was 1934, but despite the economic disaster that had ravaged the country, he had been wise and had remained one of the few that had been unhurt on Black Tuesday, October 29. He wanted a final gathering from those who had hovered around his money for so long, so he had stipulated in his will that they stay a couple of days at his old mansion before they got their rewards for their fidelity, kindness, or received what was due to them from family obligation. Among the mourners and hopeful benificiaries was Bella Welmer, a young wavy-haired blonde almost young enough to have been Harmen'sgranddaughter. She had been his fianc and now stood to get a lot. She had once been what the Romans would have called a legacy hunter, and what people in these days would call a gold-digger. But those who knew her knew that had changed. Though she had just been a greedy teenager looking for an easy way to sit in the lap of luxury, she had come to truly love John Harmen. She openly admitted to her mercenary wishes before, and was the first to criticize herself for them, and meant every word, but she was still here. Another was Lizzy Harkness, a dark-haired woman who was the daughter of one of Harmen's old fishing buddies. Quieter and softer than Bella but decidedly melancholic, it was hard to tell which of them was more beautiful or more likeable. Her father was good friends with Harmen and had died a few weeks before. She wasn't after the money and was here by strict respect. She was a working woman who mourned her father's loss far more than she cared for what she might get. There was also her brother Charlie and Mr. Preston, a teacher Harmen had hired in secret to give Lizzy an educational leg up where her schooling was incomplete. He very clearly had other things on his mind when he looked at the dark girl, but he taught the girl with great skill, even though watching them brought one to wonder who was the more intelligent of the two as Lizzy was unmistakably clever while Preston was what one would call a \"know-nothing know-it-all\" who lacked any real sense and had a lot less learning than he claimed he did. There was also Mr. Jacob Goldduster, a man who was one of the least corruptible people Harmen had ever known and a guy who had always been dependable to do what he could for those less fortunate. He didn't want the money really, but he respected Harmen's wishes. There was also Mr. Peter Venus, a man who seemed very worldly and wise, and who was very handsome. He was a man who really liked the house and was constantly peering into corners, though he never quite said what he was looking for. Learned and suave, the man was beloved by the old Man and a good friend of Goldduster. Also, last and certainly least was Mr. Smiddy. Smiddy was a man badly injured in the first world war, moving about on a peg leg and ranting at all he saw. Unlike Bella, he was an unashamed golddiggger and was quick to claim he wanted the money whenever an opportunity showed itself. He constantly carried a copy of \"The decline and fall of the Roman Empire\" which he read from noisily and obnoxiously, much to the shegrin of all present. All would be glad when this guy got his share and left. All of these were here when the others arrived. Others that inspired fear, as the thoughts watched and waited, wanting out, though it was not yet time.

He wanted a final gathering from those who had hovered around his money for so long, so he had stipulated in his will that they stay a couple of days at his old mansion before they got their rewards for their fidelity, kindness, or received what was due to them from family obligation. Among the mourners and hopeful benificiaries was Bella Welmer, a young wavy-haired blonde almost young enough to have been Harmen'sgranddaughter. She had been his fianc and now stood to get a lot. She had once been what the Romans would have called a legacy hunter, and what people in these days would call a gold-digger. But those who knew her knew that had changed. Though she had just been a greedy teenager looking for an easy way to sit in the lap of luxury, she had come to truly love John Harmen. She openly admitted to her mercenary wishes before, and was the first to criticize herself for them, and meant every word, but she was still here. Another was Lizzy Harkness, a dark-haired woman who was the daughter of one of Harmen's old fishing buddies. Quieter and softer than Bella but decidedly melancholic, it was hard to tell which of them was more beautiful or more likeable. Her father was good friends with Harmen and had died a few weeks before. She wasn't after the money and was here by strict respect. She was a working woman who mourned her father's loss far more than she cared for what she might get. There was also her brother Charlie and Mr. Preston, a teacher Harmen had hired in secret to give Lizzy an educational leg up where her schooling was incomplete. He very clearly had other things on his mind when he looked at the dark girl, but he taught the girl with great skill, even though watching them brought one to wonder who was the more intelligent of the two as Lizzy was unmistakably clever while Preston was what one would call a \"know-nothing know-it-all\" who lacked any real sense and had a lot less learning than he claimed he did. There was also Mr. Jacob Goldduster, a man who was one of the least corruptible people Harmen had ever known and a guy who had always been dependable to do what he could for those less fortunate. He didn't want the money really, but he respected Harmen's wishes. There was also Mr. Peter Venus, a man who seemed very worldly and wise, and who was very handsome. He was a man who really liked the house and was constantly peering into corners, though he never quite said what he was looking for. Learned and suave, the man was beloved by the old Man and a good friend of Goldduster. Also, last and certainly least was Mr. Smiddy. Smiddy was a man badly injured in the first world war, moving about on a peg leg and ranting at all he saw. Unlike Bella, he was an unashamed golddiggger and was quick to claim he wanted the money whenever an opportunity showed itself. He constantly carried a copy of \"The decline and fall of the Roman Empire\" which he read from noisily and obnoxiously, much to the shegrin of all present. All would be glad when this guy got his share and left. All of these were here when the others arrived. Others that inspired fear, as the thoughts watched and waited, wanting out, though it was not yet time. These new ones were more powerful and wise than any before, and though the thinkers did not know why they feared, what they had done for centuries untold might be being brought to an end.",

        "writing_prompt": "When a secretive magical society attempts to harness immense power on Alcatraz Island, their ritual is interrupted by the arrival of two otherworldly beings. Now, scattered traces of corrupted magic and mysterious golden trinkets warn a handful of unlikely individuals—can they uncover the truth and stop the Golden King before the Bay Area falls under his spell?",
        "story": "They had the 115 magi they would need. The San Francisco branch of the Danelon were distinctly low on magical energy, and with favors they owed in Chinatown, and a general quota they owed to the high council, a big draw of energy was exactly what they needed. From all over the west coast of the so-called independent nation of the United States, came some of the most talented Danelon Magi. But it hadnt been a speedily-perfected plan. There were a lot of grudges in the mixture of the needed mystics that had to be ironed out, and the exact best time to open the gate for some more power had not yet been determined. They knew where to do it though. Alcatraz Island was no longer a prison, but the rough waters in the bay, and the fact that the tours of the prison were strictly scheduled meant they would have more than enough time. A few quick spells and the tour boats to the island were lent by the night watchmen, along with the consent of a tour operator. Theyd never remember these guys, which was exactly how it should be. It was best when even the Danelons biggest coups would not be remembered by any of the norms out there. Ralph Bach, a man who could have known Johan Sabastian personally, drew imaginary lines in his head, making sure that the rest were exactly where they needed to be. This would be one of the largest gatherings of magical energy in the 21st century and it would all be for his glory. Perhaps he might even make a better focus, being able to draw on even more of what the Danelon gathered rather than the rations of magical energy he was provided with. He had overdrawn on the communal store of magic many times through his focus and it was why he wasnt in Las Angeles, New York, or Beijing right now. The anchors all formed the inner core of the formation, some of them chained down as draws this big could cause them to flail and hurt themselves when the energy came flooding through. A larger core stood outside the main gate, in the dark as they did not want to alert the outside world to what they were doing. Ralph lifted his hand, the bronze ring on his finger beginning to glow with a slight light of its own, and the chanting and gesturing began, while the Anchors, those who would take the brunt of the energy flowing out of the gate gritted their teeth but also kept up the ritualistic gesturing and incanting that they too needed in order that all this energy that would come forth would fall into the Danelons hands. Over the gate, the gate that many prisoners had passed through, a curtain of glowing colors formed. Greens, blues, pinks, and oranges danced over the opening, and all the Danelon felt a surge of power. The power grew. The Most ambitious of the Danelon felt that their schemes were in reach; the official they desired to control, the tech they wanted destroyed, or the medicines they wanted developed, or conveniently deemed too dangerous all seemed within reach. Alie Haiden: A blonde woman almost as old as Ralph, but not as successful, saw herself finally developing the invisible fire a fire that seared the soul right out of a being, leaving no physical residue in the corpse. She had always been a scholar. Arnold Kant, a younger man, saw the many failed missions of assassins lately, and saw a way to infuse human muscles with the strength of Tungsten Steel, weakness would be a thing of the past in the Danelon and it would all be thanks to him. The glistening curtain tingled like a chime on a summer day porch. And the energy came in an ever-increasing flow as it was opened wider. The light grew brighter, and despite the toll being taken on the anchors, the Danelon functioned as a well-knit group in the elation of a successful draw, despite the many petty grievances many of the members of this team had with others. The music of a doorway never got old, and more instruments joined the piece, strings, chimes, bells, and flutes all added their voices coming from the door, unlike any instruments norms knew but flutes, strings, and others, were the closest thing a human mind could understand. The energy was almost drawn when a noise, far more discordant than the noise of magic sounded in the empty prison, echoing off of the old tower, the hard concrete walls, and bouncing about in the cell-lined corridors. It sounded much like the braying of a donkey, but somehow had a human malevolence to it as well. This had happened before. Ralph made the gesture and several of the Magi began to change their chanting and they began to thrust their hands at the opening. To drive back whatever was coming through. There were two forms striding through the gate. One a shapely female form, though the ground vibrated with every thudding step she took, while the other, larger and more muscular, seemingly even heavier walked a few steps in front. He was the first to be seen, and if it were not for his donkeys ears, he would actually have been quite handsome.

Alcatraz Island was no longer a prison, but the rough waters in the bay, and the fact that the tours of the prison were strictly scheduled meant they would have more than enough time. A few quick spells and the tour boats to the island were lent by the night watchmen, along with the consent of a tour operator. Theyd never remember these guys, which was exactly how it should be.

This would be one of the largest gatherings of magical energy in the 21st century and it would all be for his glory. Perhaps he might even make a better focus, being able to draw on even more of what the Danelon gathered rather than the rations of magical energy he was provided with.

A larger core stood outside the main gate, in the dark as they did not want to alert the outside world to what they were doing. Ralph lifted his hand, the bronze ring on his finger beginning to glow with a slight light of its own, and the chanting and gesturing began, while the Anchors, those who would take the brunt of the energy flowing out of the gate gritted their teeth but also kept up the ritualistic gesturing and incanting that they too needed in order that all this energy that would come forth would fall into the Danelons hands. Over the gate, the gate that many prisoners had passed through, a curtain of glowing colors formed. Greens, blues, pinks, and oranges danced over the opening, and all the Danelon felt a surge of power. The power grew. The Most ambitious of the Danelon felt that their schemes were in reach; the official they desired to control, the tech they wanted destroyed, or the medicines they wanted developed, or conveniently deemed too dangerous all seemed within reach. Alie Haiden: A blonde woman almost as old as Ralph, but not as successful, saw herself finally developing the invisible fire a fire that seared the soul right out of a being, leaving no physical residue in the corpse. She had always been a scholar. Arnold Kant, a younger man, saw the many failed missions of assassins lately, and saw a way to infuse human muscles with the strength of Tungsten Steel, weakness would be a thing of the past in the Danelon and it would all be thanks to him. The glistening curtain tingled like a chime on a summer day porch. And the energy came in an ever-increasing flow as it was opened wider. The light grew brighter, and despite the toll being taken on the anchors, the Danelon functioned as a well-knit group in the elation of a successful draw, despite the many petty grievances many of the members of this team had with others. The music of a doorway never got old, and more instruments joined the piece, strings, chimes, bells, and flutes all added their voices coming from the door, unlike any instruments norms knew but flutes, strings, and others, were the closest thing a human mind could understand. The energy was almost drawn when a noise, far more discordant than the noise of magic sounded in the empty prison, echoing off of the old tower, the hard concrete walls, and bouncing about in the cell-lined corridors. It sounded much like the braying of a donkey, but somehow had a human malevolence to it as well. This had happened before.

        "writing_prompt": "After being cast out of your village for a curse you had no part in, you and your young brothers struggle to survive in the wilderness, haunted by grief, hunger, and the weight of impossible choices. One night, as the youngest crawls toward the stream, you feel the stillness of the air shift—something is coming, and it demands an answer.",
        "story": "He has his hands on Nii’s throat, and this time I do not stop them. They’re fighting over the last sugarcane, and Nii has it held tightly between his teeth, the juice from the cane dripping down his shorts. I am more concerned about how many more days he’ll be wearing the shorts unwashed, with its stain, than Ayikwe choking him to death. As if trapped inside a curse, my brothers and I have, since Mother’s passing, tasted famine in seasons of abundance. They call it a taboo—that a woman will go into labor and lose her life, especially when the child survives. “How is it possible that the same channel of life can know death?” they’ll say to one another. “The baby must have sucked out her last breath.” Sometimes they’ll curse and plead their favor, “Chai! Between my dead body and a cursed child, may God choose me.” And hence the banishment of my family.\nThey did not come chasing us out of our home with machetes, as I’ve been told of the past. But the signs were evident that they wanted us gone. At my kiosk in the market central, a scarecrow had been planted, its ripped white shirt besmirched with rotten tomatoes. The boys wondered why none of their friends would play with them. Once a boy in the neighborhood said Ayikwe was just a sacrificed clot of blood, and Ayikwe responded by digging his tiny fist into the boy’s cheek. A nightmare also kept repeating itself: that while we slept, townspeople gathered around our hut and, circling us in silence, lit a match. They set us on fire and lifted up their hands in thanksgiving. There was never smoke, just our cries filling the air. I couldn’t let that happen, and so in the first week of August, we folded everything we owned, which wasn’t much, into two sacks, and with a six-month-old baby strapped to my back, we made our way through the farms and into the outskirts of the village.\nNii is six and Ayikwe just turned eleven. For his birthday I read him Mother’s favorite prayer, which we all know by heart, days spent kneeling on a mat speaking the words slowly, rehearsed and without meaning. He insists I read it, saying, “You sound just like Ma. It is comfort.”\n“Comforting,” I say and begin to read from the back of an envelope that contains Bible verses and written prayers to God:\nLord, make me an instrument of your peace:\nwhere there is hatred, let me sow love;\nwhere there is injury, pardon;\nwhere there is doubt, faith;\nwhere there is despair, hope;\nwhere there is darkness, light;\nwhere there is sadness, joy.\nO divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek\nto be consoled as to console,\nto be understood as to understand,\nto be loved as to love.\nFor it is in giving that we receive,\nit is in pardoning that we are pardoned,\nand it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen.\n“But I don’t want to die,” Nii says, and I smile at him, the baby’s head resting easy on my chest. We named him Joseph. Actually, Ayikwe did, after his favorite Bible character. I didn’t object. At the time, I was spending days and nights in the clinic, signing papers I didn’t understand and wishing everything to be over. It was a relief to come back home with a baby who already had a name picked out and a coat of many colors, a faded Ankara cloth my mother owned. Sometimes I wonder if Joseph will be the beam of light, the one who rises above the storm and saves us from drowning. At the back of my mind, although I resist thinking such things, I toy with the idea of selling him, although I’m sure no one will pay for a womb’s curse. I know I’ll be sorry for harboring such thoughts. Nothing would be the same without him, but, frankly, selling him would be the best thing to happen to the boys and me. We could return home, just the three of us. I could have my kiosk in the market again and Ayikwe could grow maize on the farm. We could eat and laugh and be accepted.\nYou would think that by fifteen, life had dealt me enough, given me my share of its troubles—leaving school to trade in the market with my mother and coming home to cook for a family, which reduced my life to servitude. And now to be responsible for my brothers’ lives when I can barely carry my own is something I never wanted.\nWe’ve been in the woods twelve days. A meandering stream froths beside us. The boys have dug out groundnut and found a dead fish or two they could make nothing of. I’ve eaten very little. For Joseph, I pick green leaves and grind them between my palms and force it down his mouth. He spits most of it out. I can hear the boys splashing their legs in the stream, and I allow myself to weep for the first time since everything. It’s a private mourning; I grieve the loss of my mother, the cruel townspeople, and my tired heart. When the day winds down, clouds stretch above us, expanding like an inflated body. I do not know what makes me do it, but I open up the envelope and pull out a letter. It is dated January 2003. Some lines have been crossed out and some shaded deeply. I wonder what kind of prayer said to God is revocable. What happens to the receipts? We swallow back our words out of fear and like to believe God keeps no record. I cannot think of why Mother will want some prayers returned to her, but I know it is no way a lack of faith. Yet, here in these letters, she bleeds a softness I’ve never known: God, life is so cursed out here. Do you hear me? The darkness comes after me and I run. Look, I am breathless. I am salt and light of the earth but also scared.

They’re fighting over the last sugarcane, and Nii has it held tightly between his teeth, the juice from the cane dripping down his shorts. I am more concerned about how many more days he’ll be wearing the shorts unwashed, with its stain, than Ayikwe choking him to death. As if trapped inside a curse, my brothers and I have, since Mother’s passing, tasted famine in seasons of abundance. They call it a taboo—that a woman will go into labor and lose her life, especially when the child survives. “How is it possible that the same channel of life can know death?” they’ll say to one another. “The baby must have sucked out her last breath.” Sometimes they’ll curse and plead their favor, “Chai! Between my dead body and a cursed child, may God choose me.” And hence the banishment of my family.\nThey did not come chasing us out of our home with machetes, as I’ve been told of the past. But the signs were evident that they wanted us gone. At my kiosk in the market central, a scarecrow had been planted, its ripped white shirt besmirched with rotten tomatoes. The boys wondered why none of their friends would play with them. Once a boy in the neighborhood said Ayikwe was just a sacrificed clot of blood, and Ayikwe responded by digging his tiny fist into the boy’s cheek. A nightmare also kept repeating itself: that while we slept, townspeople gathered around our hut and, circling us in silence, lit a match. They set us on fire and lifted up their hands in thanksgiving. There was never smoke, just our cries filling the air. I couldn’t let that happen, and so in the first week of August, we folded everything we owned, which wasn’t much, into two sacks, and with a six-month-old baby strapped to my back, we made our way through the farms and into the outskirts of the village.\nNii is six and Ayikwe just turned eleven. For his birthday I read him Mother’s favorite prayer, which we all know by heart, days spent kneeling on a mat speaking the words slowly, rehearsed and without meaning. He insists I read it, saying, “You sound just like Ma. It is comfort.”\n“Comforting,” I say and begin to read from the back of an envelope that contains Bible verses and written prayers to God:\nLord, make me an instrument of your peace:\nwhere there is hatred, let me sow love;\nwhere there is injury, pardon;\nwhere there is doubt, faith;\nwhere there is despair, hope;\nwhere there is darkness, light;\nwhere there is sadness, joy.\nO divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek\nto be consoled as to console,\nto be understood as to understand,\nto be loved as to love.\nFor it is in giving that we receive,\nit is in pardoning that we are pardoned,\nand it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen.\n“But I don’t want to die,” Nii says, and I smile at him, the baby’s head resting easy on my chest. We named him Joseph. Actually, Ayikwe did, after his favorite Bible character. I didn’t object. At the time, I was spending days and nights in the clinic, signing papers I didn’t understand and wishing everything to be over. It was a relief to come back home with a baby who already had a name picked out and a coat of many colors, a faded Ankara cloth my mother owned. Sometimes I wonder if Joseph will be the beam of light, the one who rises above the storm and saves us from drowning. At the back of my mind, although I resist thinking such things, I toy with the idea of selling him, although I’m sure no one will pay for a womb’s curse. I know I’ll be sorry for harboring such thoughts. Nothing would be the same without him, but, frankly, selling him would be the best thing to happen to the boys and me. We could return home, just the three of us. I could have my kiosk in the market again and Ayikwe could grow maize on the farm. We could eat and laugh and be accepted.\nYou would think that by fifteen, life had dealt me enough, given me my share of its troubles—leaving school to trade in the market with my mother and coming home to cook for a family, which reduced my life to servitude. And now to be responsible for my brothers’ lives when I can barely carry my own is something I never wanted.\nWe’ve been in the woods twelve days. A meandering stream froths beside us. The boys have dug out groundnut and found a dead fish or two they could make nothing of. I’ve eaten very little. For Joseph, I pick green leaves and grind them between my palms and force it down his mouth. He spits most of it out. I can hear the boys splashing their legs in the stream, and I allow myself to weep for the first time since everything. It’s a private mourning; I grieve the loss of my mother, the cruel townspeople, and my tired heart. When the day winds down, clouds stretch above us, expanding like an inflated body. I do not know what makes me do it, but I open up the envelope and pull out a letter. It is dated January 2003. Some lines have been crossed out and some shaded deeply. I wonder what kind of prayer said to God is revocable. What happens to the receipts? We swallow back our words out of fear and like to believe God keeps no record. I cannot think of why Mother will want some prayers returned to her, but I know it is no way a lack of faith. Yet, here in these letters, she bleeds a softness I’ve never known: God, life is so cursed out here. Do you hear me? The darkness comes after me and I run. Look, I am breathless.

        "story": "My mom picked me up from the airport at 11:58 p.m., well past her bedtime. I hopped into my sister’s gold Honda CR-V, which my mom was driving because her car was in the shop, and found her listening to an old cassette, a recording of Helen and me from when we were little.\n“Listen to this,” she said smiling, and turned up the volume.\n“I was trying to record you saying ‘Dada,’ but you never quite get there.”\nThe recording went on for about twenty minutes, a seven-month-old me cooing happily, a three-year-old Helen with a three-year-old voice. “Come on, Abbie, let’s go,” she said, her tiny voice full of sass and spunk. Hearing the recording, my chest swelled in expectation, like watching a movie I’d seen a long time ago, remembering how the story would change—by no means a tragedy but without the tied-up resolution everyone expected. I wanted to take Helen’s three-year-old shoulders and pull her into a firm hug. “Do you have any idea how important you are?”\nIn the recording she began to cough, and our mom, with a hint of frustration, said, “Gracious!” Hearing it twenty years later, I wondered how many consecutive nights she’d gone without sleep. She was painting a bedroom, trying to be a good mother, wife, Catholic.\n“Why did you say ‘gracious’ like that?” Helen mimicked our mom’s slight exasperation, filling it in with anger.\nMom winced at the recording, and I’m sure it was painful to hear her twenty-seven-year-old exhaustion caricatured by a three-year-old.\nThe tape whirred, then came to a stop with a gentle click. We drove through empty Memphis suburbs in comfortable silence, made our way along Raleigh LaGrange Road, finally rolling into the dark driveway, alive with summer air. The world was fragrant. Damp earth, cool grass, warm, heavy. Home. I stepped into the brightly lit kitchen, made a piece of toast, and went to bed.\nI didn’t sleep as long as I’d hoped. Travel disrupted whatever rhythm there’d been in my body, and I was up by seven.\n“Do you want me to take you to pick up your car?” I offered, searching for a way to fill the empty morning.\nWe climbed back into the CR-V, and Mom pulled a 1999 Ben Harper cassette from the stack on the center console. Looking out the passenger window at the flat, hot summer, I found myself singing along. The window caught glints of morning sun and offered snapshots of the girl I must have been once but now hardly recognized. She had a messy middle part, blonde peach-fuzz legs, and knew all the words to “Steal My Kisses.”\nWe pulled into the entrance of the Nissan dealership off of Covington, which has better service than the one in Collierville, and Mom gathered her belongings: a cross-body purse full of pens, hand lotion, Kleenex, little glass hearts, and a St. Christopher medal; a 20-ounce thermos of steaming Emperor’s Cloud tea, the green metallic paint chipping around the lip; a set of Bose headphones draped casually around her neck like a piece of statement jewelry. She held it all so naturally, each item an extension of her.\nThe guy helping us ushered her into her newly serviced car, and I climbed over to the driver’s side of the CR-V, adjusting the mirrors and seat. Pulling out into the right lane of morning traffic, I fumbled for the volume knob on the stereo. I skipped a handful of Ben Harper songs, listening for something different, though I wasn’t sure what. The tape flipped over, and the song that filled the car took me back to the purple-gray time of Helen’s teenage depression, when she never left her room, didn’t talk or eat much–somewhere I hadn’t been in quite a while. A heaviness sank into my shoulders and under my eyes. I felt alone again, a stark contrast to our warm infant closeness. The song carried me into the backseat of our mom’s navy-blue minivan, raindrops racing to the edge of the window, losing themselves in one another, while I imagined the wild-eyed woman in the song in her white nightgown, mourning, lonely, desperate. The sadness and fear almost swallowed me, and remembering it made me drive faster, as if I could lose it in the twists and turns of Raleigh LaGrange Road.\n“Really, we’re all just lonely for ourselves,” my mom said matter-of-factly, when later that day I mentioned the hollowness of that song.",

        "writing_prompt": "A group of untenured professors living in faulty faculty housing must navigate relentless construction chaos, worsening leaks, and mounting frustrations—all while trying to decide if they should risk their careers to fight back or simply endure until tenure offers an escape.",
        "story": "Between the exterior wall and the Sheetrock, a waterproofing layer was missing. The builders, in their defense, said that the layer had simply been forgotten about, not left out in an intentional move to save money. The building was faculty housing, occupied only by professors and their families. All but one professor were untenured. Half had kids under ten.\nThe layer had been found to be missing during a city inspection a decade ago. Repairs were put off for nine years. The school, as both employer and landlord, cited extreme busyness, and pointed out that, despite the missing barrier, no actual apartment floods had occurred. Year ten there was a global pandemic, but year ten was also the end of the remediation period, so construction had to start. The contractor hosted a virtual meeting to explain the many phases of the process. The slide show had several typos. “Demolition” became “demonition”; no apartment number was listed correctly. How disruptive would all this be, the dance professor asked, and the cherub-faced blond contractor’s spokesman answered politely, “Very much so, ma’am.” Then the chemistry professor chimed in about particulates. If the entire brick façade was being torn off, what was being done about air-quality control? The chemistry professor had small children. Small children had small lungs. The blond man said that they would tape over everyone’s windows. They would tape over the vents of everyone’s A.C.s. “So, no A.C.s or windows?” another professor asked. “All through summer, no opening windows or running A.C.s?” This professor, who taught biology and kept on the building’s rooftop a colony of honeybees, was not known to repeat himself. The blond man said that that was correct. And that the rooftop would be closed to accommodate the rigging, so the bee colony would have to be moved.\nTo better address the concerns of the tenants, a second virtual meeting was called, and predictably it went much worse.\nThe third virtual meeting was cancelled, and, a day later, scaffolding went up. Spaghetti-like ropes encased the building, and men in orange vests carrying hammer drills appeared on skinny platform lifts. Windows were covered with a neon-blue film that turned every room into an aquarium and gave tenants headaches. “No one’s complained about the blue film before,” the contractor said, though he then admitted to never having worked on an occupied building before. Clear film was procured four days later, the windows retaped.\nThe contractor did boast about having an on-site hygienist, a woman who was copied on e-mails but whom no one had met.\nFor three weeks, the noise level was terrible, from nine to five, Monday through Friday, with no pause. The new writing professor was trying to finish a novel but could only write things like “So this is what it must feel like to live inside a tooth that a dentist is trying to drill.” The tooth occupied her thoughts nightly. She hadn’t gone to the dentist in years. Red dust coated the window film; plumes of smoke were seen. The religion professor brought up the plumes, how, from her red-tinted window, they seemed cloudlike even. The contractor replied immediately, copying the hygienist, to clarify that what the professor saw was not a plume or anything close to a cloud but a puff of smoke being aggrandized by the wind.\nEach morning, there was an e-mail update explaining which units would be most directly affected that day, though the apartment numbers were still incorrect. So, to figure out if you were truly going to be affected, you had to watch for where the huge mechanical pulley on the roof was dropping lifts. Glancing up at the building from the outside, the ceramics professor was reminded of his childhood, and that unwinnable arcade game with a bin of plush toys and a slippery claw. He was on the corner waiting for Mister Softee. He was waiting for Mister Softee because his three boys, who were inside, had told him to text them when the truck was in sight.\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\nThe technical term for what was missing was flashing—an embedded sheet of metal that prevents moisture from penetrating a building’s walls. Flashing is particularly important at junctions, around windows, vent pipes, etc. No one thought anymore of the word’s other meanings—committing indecent exposure, for example, running buck naked across a green field in a Superman cape, as the six-year-old son of the dance professor had done during his first soccer game.\nInclement weather set in one weekend, a hurricane muscling through from the south. Rain fell for three days and nights, and the history professor, whose apartment was right below the pulley, said it sounded as if it were raining within the walls. Could there be a leak? He sent the company an audio clip. The company responded a minute later. Leaks were impossible. They had sealed all the leaks because that was what they were here to do. Below the history professor lived a math professor, who all weekend had been collecting the water that had funnelled into her office through the ceiling. She used a one-gallon bucket, and she’d emptied the bucket into the bathtub five times. The math professor was married to the East Asian Studies professor. Not that ironically, the former was Asian and the latter white. Between gallons three and four, the former had drafted an angry e-mail to the school, but then stared at her unnuanced message. She worried about being the squeaky wheel, when she and her husband had upcoming third-year reviews. Still, she asked if he could rewrite and send the e-mail, given both his nuance skills and the fact that the administration might take him more seriously. That would be taking advantage of his privilege, he thought, and shook his head, but encouraged her to send the e-mail, since she should feel empowered to and he was never going to stand in her way. A quarrel about feminism followed. No e-mail was sent.\nOver text, some tenants hatched a plan. They would implore the one tenured resident—an economics professor—to declare war by sending the e-mail and hiring a lawyer who would then launch the war by suing the school. But the economics professor was away. He’d left for Crete at the start of the construction, on a private jet owned by one of his friends.\nWithin the building, the audio clip went viral and was forwarded anonymously to the project’s architect. The architect soon replied in an e-mail about how a pulley system of that weight might have shifted the building’s foundation, creating fractures, but this problem was, unfortunately, beyond the company’s scope. They dealt only with façades. Another company did foundations.\nThe next weekend, another storm front came through. Seven gallons, the math professor counted. In the history professor’s bedroom, a paint bubble, the height and width of a man, appeared on the wall overnight. He poked the bubble, afraid that it might actually be a person, like his department chair, and was sprayed, drenched, in brown water.\nThe professors lamented in the laundry room. What kind of collective e-mail to send, and in what tone? A seven-hundred-word one was drafted, with bulleted questions for further discussion. The e-mail was edited down to three hundred words, then ballooned again to a thousand.\n“We must withhold rent,” the ethics professor said—a thought that gave the non-activist professors palpitations.\nThe walls of the water-filled units now felt spongy, and eventually a two-hundred-word e-mail was sent, signed by all the untenured professors, and ending with the sentence “We demand immediate action.” Within an hour, a fit young man arrived and handed everyone he met a business card. The card said that he was the vice-president of the company. The man noted the places where water was still seeping in. He said that there would likely be mold growth, and, should the mold be the color of soot, coal, or volcanic ash, they would need to call in the hygienist to culture it. Not all strains are toxic, he informed them. Some were perfectly O.K. In addition, he’d gone up to the roof and found no visible faults around the pulley system, so perhaps the leak was a preëxisting condition that had suddenly, coincidentally, got worse. “Things like this do happen,” he insisted, and added that, once the scaffolding was removed, the foundation would naturally rise up, against gravity, to its previous position. Then he tipped his hard hat at the professors and wished them a good day.\nSo construction went on unimpeded, and more storms came through, and more gallons were collected. Spores grew in the wet areas, none whose colors were quite right to be cultured. Rent was paid reliably; no more complaints were filed. In time, the professors all arrived at the same conclusion. Was the leak really that bad? On good days, it sounded like living next to a waterfall. Push through it, the way you did in grad school; then, once you get tenure, you can fly to Crete. ♦",

The builders, in their defense, said that the layer had simply been forgotten about, not left out in an intentional move to save money. The building was faculty housing, occupied only by professors and their families. All but one professor were untenured. Half had kids under ten.\nThe layer had been found to be missing during a city inspection a decade ago. Repairs were put off for nine years. The school, as both employer and landlord, cited extreme busyness, and pointed out that, despite the missing barrier, no actual apartment floods had occurred. Year ten there was a global pandemic, but year ten was also the end of the remediation period, so construction had to start. The contractor hosted a virtual meeting to explain the many phases of the process. The slide show had several typos. “Demolition” became “demonition”; no apartment number was listed correctly. How disruptive would all this be, the dance professor asked, and the cherub-faced blond contractor’s spokesman answered politely, “Very much so, ma’am.” Then the chemistry professor chimed in about particulates. If the entire brick façade was being torn off, what was being done about air-quality control? The chemistry professor had small children. Small children had small lungs. The blond man said that they would tape over everyone’s windows. They would tape over the vents of everyone’s A.C.s. “So, no A.C.s or windows?” another professor asked. “All through summer, no opening windows or running A.C.s?” This professor, who taught biology and kept on the building’s rooftop a colony of honeybees, was not known to repeat himself. The blond man said that that was correct. And that the rooftop would be closed to accommodate the rigging, so the bee colony would have to be moved.\nTo better address the concerns of the tenants, a second virtual meeting was called, and predictably it went much worse.\nThe third virtual meeting was cancelled, and, a day later, scaffolding went up. Spaghetti-like ropes encased the building, and men in orange vests carrying hammer drills appeared on skinny platform lifts. Windows were covered with a neon-blue film that turned every room into an aquarium and gave tenants headaches. “No one’s complained about the blue film before,” the contractor said, though he then admitted to never having worked on an occupied building before. Clear film was procured four days later, the windows retaped.\nThe contractor did boast about having an on-site hygienist, a woman who was copied on e-mails but whom no one had met.\nFor three weeks, the noise level was terrible, from nine to five, Monday through Friday, with no pause. The new writing professor was trying to finish a novel but could only write things like “So this is what it must feel like to live inside a tooth that a dentist is trying to drill.” The tooth occupied her thoughts nightly. She hadn’t gone to the dentist in years. Red dust coated the window film; plumes of smoke were seen. The religion professor brought up the plumes, how, from her red-tinted window, they seemed cloudlike even. The contractor replied immediately, copying the hygienist, to clarify that what the professor saw was not a plume or anything close to a cloud but a puff of smoke being aggrandized by the wind.\nEach morning, there was an e-mail update explaining which units would be most directly affected that day, though the apartment numbers were still incorrect. So, to figure out if you were truly going to be affected, you had to watch for where the huge mechanical pulley on the roof was dropping lifts. Glancing up at the building from the outside, the ceramics professor was reminded of his childhood, and that unwinnable arcade game with a bin of plush toys and a slippery claw. He was on the corner waiting for Mister Softee. He was waiting for Mister Softee because his three boys, who were inside, had told him to text them when the truck was in sight.\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\nThe technical term for what was missing was flashing—an embedded sheet of metal that prevents moisture from penetrating a building’s walls.

        "writing_prompt": "After the arrival of a mysterious pair of escalators in the middle of her department store, Kitty begins to feel her life shifting in strange and unexpected ways—up or down, she can't quite tell.",
        "story": "Kitty was suspicious of the escalator, or, more properly, the escalators, as there were two of them, one falling and one rising, anchored side by side in the middle of the main shopping floor. She disliked the push of the motor, and, under that, the light clacking sound of something she could not analyze. A chain perhaps, that ran loose, deep in the machine.\nThey were new. The space where they appeared had been boxed in for months, floor to ceiling, with cheap wooden panelling, painted blue. First, a hole was knocked in the floor, and then another in the ceiling above, she supposed. They worked at night, but even during the day men came out from behind the panelling, filthy and smiling, and went back in again: ordinary Dublin men who worked whenever, and installed escalators in the middle of the night. She wondered how much they were paid.\nKitty tried to take to them, but she couldn't. She was disturbed by the sight of them out among the merchandise. She disliked the way they talked to each other loudly and laughed as if they owned the shop. They interrupted the conversation, somehow. You'd be selling a bed, talking about springs, you'd be with a young couple, pushing into the mattress in a cozy sort of way, and who would stroll past but the lean blond one, maybe, with the dirty-looking tan, adjusting his zip on the way back from the loo.\nNot that she minded men. She had two grown sons at home, so she was used to it: the cheerfulness, the indifference, and the mess. Though sometimes she turned around in the kitchen and was shocked by the sheer size of them—all that protein and carbohydrate, the muscle and milk of them, as though she had fed a couple of potted plants, and grown triffids.\nThen, one morning, she walked in and the men were gone. The place was perfect; the carpets fresh and new, the hoarding dissolved into thin air, and, in the middle of the floor, a pair of escalators, one going up and the other coming down. The steps tugged lightly at each other as they passed, snagging and loosening all day long. They ticked in the corner of her eye, making her feel balanced, or dizzy, depending on the light. They were so clean. The up escalator always mounting itself, stair over stair; the down escalator falling like syrup, burying itself slowly in the flatness of the floor.\nThey were beautiful, and they never stopped, and finally they got on her nerves. Nothing happened in the Bed Department. People bought a bed, or they did not buy a bed. Kitty used to like the open space, the hummocky slabs of mattress, the headboards like tombstones in a giant graveyard. \"Who's been sleeping in my bed?\" But all her satisfaction was gone now. The way people lay down and curled up, in the middle of the crowd. The old couples sitting on either side of the mattress and looking over their shoulders at each other in a way that was almost coy; the giggles and the silences. Most people buying a bed were in love, she used to think, or hopeful at least of finding love. Now they just bounced up and down or put their dirty feet up or looked like they could kill for a decent night's sleep.\nShe was at home one evening, washing the dishes, when the phone rang. It was a young man who said he was looking for a Kevin Daly. Kitty was listed as K. Daly in the phone book, and she didn't want to give too much away. She said that there was no Kevin Daly at that number, and the young man asked if she was sure. He said that he was looking for a Kevin Daly he used to know, a man who had gone to school in Malahide. \"I'm sorry,\" Kitty said, but they were talking to each other now. He told her that Kevin Daly was his brother, long out of touch. Then he said that Kevin Daly was actually his father, but that he did not know he was his father, or he did not know that he was his son. He said that he was looking for his father because his mother was sick and that was why she had given him his father's name, finally—Kevin Daly, and the fact that he'd gone to school in Malahide. \"It was a schooltime romance,\" he said. Kitty just said \"Sorry\" a lot, the way you might say \"I see.\"\n\"Sorry,\" she said.\n\"So that's why—you know?\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nHe asked did she have a brother called Kevin Daly, or a cousin, and she just said, \"No, sorry.\" But he was quite insistent, as though she might be harboring the man. \"No really, I'm sorry,\" she said, and put down the phone.\nThe next day, Kitty expected someone to float down the escalator into the Bed Department and call her by name. She did not know who it might be. A girl, maybe, with green eyes, or a slender young boy. She imagined a man in a perfect black suit—something extra about him, anyway, like Cary Grant. A young man with curly red hair gazed at her—or through her—all the way from the floor above, and she wondered, bizarrely, if he was the person she was waiting for. Also what he might say to her, if he was.\nThen a figure did appear that made her heart turn, and it took a while before Kitty realized that it was her own mother, sailing down from Fabrics and Soft Furnishings like a queen.\nCritics at Large Live, featuring Julio Torres\n\"I didn't recognize you,\" Kitty said.\nHer mother was in town looking for a shower curtain and had thought she would pop in to say hello. But after that there was little enough to talk about. Kitty was used to seeing her at home; out in the open, she seemed surprisingly well dressed and mute.\n\"Well, you always know where to find me,\" Kitty said to her, with a stranger's smile.\nKitty ended up seducing a man from the local Drama Society, a little to his surprise. He had been courting her for months, but in an old-fashioned sort of way. He was sixty-plus, and Kitty was forty-plus; that was the kind of age gap you could expect, with two nearly grown sons. They were both in a production of \"Johnny Belinda,\" a play about a deaf-mute who gets pregnant, though it comes out right in the end. Kitty did the interval coffees and had a walk-on in the final scene; Tom, for that was the man's name, did the set. He was good with his hands, he said, as he bent over a sawhorse in the scene dock, and Kitty flicked a glance at him to see what he meant—but all he meant was that he was good at making things. Nice. In a way. He drove her home after rehearsal most nights, and one evening they stopped out to eat. After which, Kitty asked him in for a drink.\nTom. He said all he needed was a couple of hours to fit two dimmers where the old light switch was, but she'd need to redecorate, after. He looked at the photos on her mantelpiece. He was recently bereaved. His daughter had told him to join the Drama Society, so there he was. In a moment, Kitty thought, he would tell her about his teeth, that they were all his own. Faded brown eyes, silver hair, a handsome where-did-it-all-go-wrong face. They were on the sofa, safe enough. Kitty's older son lumbered in from the pub, and stayed to be introduced. Her younger one was upstairs with his own TV. They were nice boys. They did not expect their mother to seduce old geezers in the front room, and neither did the geezer. It was awkward all the way through, and quite satisfying. Kitty did not tell him about her ex-husband, as he did not talk about his dead wife. She did not tell him that her husband had strayed, that she had done everything to keep him, up to and including porn videos in the bedroom, and that, when she finally left, the judge held that desertion against her and awarded him the house. She did not tell him how her husband had moved a woman in, two weeks after walking out of court. She did not tell him how the boys had followed her eventually to her bedsit and looked after her, as only young boys can, how together they had made their way here, to the outer suburbs and a decent life. Nor did she tell him that she was pregnant, when she realized that she was pregnant. She just let him, and the Drama Society, lapse, soon after the curtain had rung down on \"Johnny Belinda,\" and before anyone could be surprised.\nAt first, she thought it was the change of life. She stood in the Bed Department and waited for hot flashes. She did not mind growing old as long as it meant growing easy, but it did not seem to be working out that way. There was an agitation, a turbulence in her blood. She rode all the way up to Accounts to query her pay slip, and she landed back down in the Bed Department with a thump. She walked the floor and sat on the beds. She had a terrible need to lie down on one of them. One Monday evening, during stocktaking, she actually did lie down. She simply reclined. She let her back sink into a double-sprung Slumberland, and felt she might never rise again.\nIt was not until she bought three pots of apricot jam that the penny dropped. She did not even bother to take a test. She felt that swooping blankness she had felt with each of the boys, so delicious, like diving into a pool and finding you can breathe. The child was no bigger than a pip in the flesh of her stomach. She took it for walks and little outings. She gave it a go on the escalators and on a park swing, scuffing the coarse sand under her feet and feeling a little mad. What would she tell the boys? As for the people in the Bed Department—Jackie, who shared the floor with her, and the customers who came in to look or buy—they all looked empty to her, like husks. As though she were the only real thing left. It was like that film with the pods, and she wanted to run away somewhere, to a deserted lighthouse, or a shack by the beach, and sit in a shaft of light while her baby grew.\nTom rang. His voice was a shock.\n\"I just thought I'd check up on you.\" He sounded close, he sounded right inside her ear. Kitty had to remind herself that there were miles of cable between them, a maze of electricity and static.\n\"I'm fine,\" she said. \"How are things?\"\n\"Good. Good.\"\nIn the pause, she felt sorry for him. He wasn't used to this kind of thing.\n\"And yourself?\" he said.\n\"Oh, flying,\" she said. \"Flying form.\" And he took the hint and let it go.\nThen, one morning, the down elevator sighed and stopped. People clumped down the steps carefully, almost aslant, squinting at the lines that were strangely solid now, though they still seemed to shift beneath their feet. Kitty was glad she wasn't on the thing when it ground to a halt. It would make you look so foolish. As it happened, the escalators were empty, apart from a young woman on the other side, who seemed to surge suddenly up. Whoosh.\nKitty knew it didn't mean anything, but she feared for her baby, which was now just eleven weeks old. She could not bear the lopsided sight of the stalled steps; they were like someone endlessly limping at the other end of the shop floor. She took a very long lunch, and when she came back a man had taken the panel off the bottom of the broken side. She was right about the chain—there it was, looping around the steps that were wedges, actually, when you looked at them side-on. They packed around the central pivot like big slices of metal pie, then separated out on the way up, dangling their triangular bases into space.\nThe escalator man glanced at her as she stared into the works, and then went back to his phase tester, tipping the metal gently here and there. He had hair on the backs of his hands, fine and light: one of those furry men with cushioned muscles and uncertain eyes. Kitty stood for a long time, making him uneasy. He glanced over his shoulder again, but he did not really see her—which was fine.\nKitty lost the baby at thirteen weeks, or lost something, at any rate. She looked at the blood on the wad of toilet paper and wondered if she was in the change of life, after all. Perhaps she had imagined the baby, perhaps it had never been there in the first place. She called in sick and went to bed and could not cry.\nAt the weekend, she drove her younger son to his soccer game in the Fifteen Acres. She had to park a distance away, because he was embarrassed by the car. Also, he did not like having his mother on the sidelines anymore, so Kitty, amused, went for a walk instead. She thought she might look for the deer. And, almost as she thought it, there they were, a herd of does and their fawns, standing or lying, and all of them chewing, watching, as she now watched, a pair of children and their toy plane buzzing at the other end of the glen.\nShe felt sure now that it had been a baby—that she had not been fooled. Her stomach was still warm and aching from it. The deer chewed on and did not mind her, while the toy plane buzzed and sputtered and fell to the ground.\nThe change of life.\nHer life was changing, that was for sure, though she seemed to be standing still. But up or down? she wondered. Up or down? The children threw the plane back into the air, and it circled again on the end of its wire. Kitty walked on. It had been a baby, she knew it. She had been visited. How could it be down, when she felt such joy. ♦",

        "story": "Kitty was suspicious of the escalator, or, more properly, the escalators, as there were two of them, one falling and one rising, anchored side by side in the middle of the main shopping floor. She disliked the push of the motor, and, under that, the light clacking sound of something she could not analyze. A chain perhaps, that ran loose, deep in the machine.\nThey were new. The space where they appeared had been boxed in for months, floor to ceiling, with cheap wooden panelling, painted blue. First, a hole was knocked in the floor, and then another in the ceiling above, she supposed. They worked at night, but even during the day men came out from behind the panelling, filthy and smiling, and went back in again: ordinary Dublin men who worked whenever, and installed escalators in the middle of the night. She wondered how much they were paid.\nKitty tried to take to them, but she couldn't. She was disturbed by the sight of them out among the merchandise. She disliked the way they talked to each other loudly and laughed as if they owned the shop. They interrupted the conversation, somehow. You'd be selling a bed, talking about springs, you'd be with a young couple, pushing into the mattress in a cozy sort of way, and who would stroll past but the lean blond one, maybe, with the dirty-looking tan, adjusting his zip on the way back from the loo.\nNot that she minded men. She had two grown sons at home, so she was used to it: the cheerfulness, the indifference, and the mess. Though sometimes she turned around in the kitchen and was shocked by the sheer size of them—all that protein and carbohydrate, the muscle and milk of them, as though she had fed a couple of potted plants, and grown triffids.\nThen, one morning, she walked in and the men were gone. The place was perfect; the carpets fresh and new, the hoarding dissolved into thin air, and, in the middle of the floor, a pair of escalators, one going up and the other coming down. The steps tugged lightly at each other as they passed, snagging and loosening all day long. They ticked in the corner of her eye, making her feel balanced, or dizzy, depending on the light. They were so clean. The up escalator always mounting itself, stair over stair; the down escalator falling like syrup, burying itself slowly in the flatness of the floor.\nThey were beautiful, and they never stopped, and finally they got on her nerves. Nothing happened in the Bed Department. People bought a bed, or they did not buy a bed. Kitty used to like the open space, the hummocky slabs of mattress, the headboards like tombstones in a giant graveyard. \"Who's been sleeping in my bed?\" But all her satisfaction was gone now. The way people lay down and curled up, in the middle of the crowd. The old couples sitting on either side of the mattress and looking over their shoulders at each other in a way that was almost coy; the giggles and the silences. Most people buying a bed were in love, she used to think, or hopeful at least of finding love. Now they just bounced up and down or put their dirty feet up or looked like they could kill for a decent night's sleep.\nShe was at home one evening, washing the dishes, when the phone rang. It was a young man who said he was looking for a Kevin Daly. Kitty was listed as K. Daly in the phone book, and she didn't want to give too much away. She said that there was no Kevin Daly at that number, and the young man asked if she was sure. He said that he was looking for a Kevin Daly he used to know, a man who had gone to school in Malahide. \"I'm sorry,\" Kitty said, but they were talking to each other now. He told her that Kevin Daly was his brother, long out of touch. Then he said that Kevin Daly was actually his father, but that he did not know he was his father, or he did not know that he was his son. He said that he was looking for his father because his mother was sick and that was why she had given him his father's name, finally—Kevin Daly, and the fact that he'd gone to school in Malahide. \"It was a schooltime romance,\" he said. Kitty just said \"Sorry\" a lot, the way you might say \"I see.\"\n\"Sorry,\" she said.\n\"So that's why—you know?\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nHe asked did she have a brother called Kevin Daly, or a cousin, and she just said, \"No, sorry.\" But he was quite insistent, as though she might be harboring the man. \"No really, I'm sorry,\" she said, and put down the phone.\nThe next day, Kitty expected someone to float down the escalator into the Bed Department and call her by name. She did not know who it might be. A girl, maybe, with green eyes, or a slender young boy. She imagined a man in a perfect black suit—something extra about him, anyway, like Cary Grant. A young man with curly red hair gazed at her—or through her—all the way from the floor above, and she wondered, bizarrely, if he was the person she was waiting for. Also what he might say to her, if he was.\nThen a figure did appear that made her heart turn, and it took a while before Kitty realized that it was her own mother, sailing down from Fabrics and Soft Furnishings like a queen.\nCritics at Large Live, featuring Julio Torres\n\"I didn't recognize you,\" Kitty said.\nHer mother was in town looking for a shower curtain and had thought she would pop in to say hello. But after that there was little enough to talk about. Kitty was used to seeing her at home; out in the open, she seemed surprisingly well dressed and mute.\n\"Well, you always know where to find me,\" Kitty said to her, with a stranger's smile.\nKitty ended up seducing a man from the local Drama Society, a little to his surprise. He had been courting her for months, but in an old-fashioned sort of way. He was sixty-plus, and Kitty was forty-plus; that was the kind of age gap you could expect, with two nearly grown sons. They were both in a production of \"Johnny Belinda,\" a play about a deaf-mute who gets pregnant, though it comes out right in the end. Kitty did the interval coffees and had a walk-on in the final scene; Tom, for that was the man's name, did the set. He was good with his hands, he said, as he bent over a sawhorse in the scene dock, and Kitty flicked a glance at him to see what he meant—but all he meant was that he was good at making things. Nice. In a way. He drove her home after rehearsal most nights, and one evening they stopped out to eat. After which, Kitty asked him in for a drink.\nTom. He said all he needed was a couple of hours to fit two dimmers where the old light switch was, but she'd need to redecorate, after. He looked at the photos on her mantelpiece. He was recently bereaved. His daughter had told him to join the Drama Society, so there he was. In a moment, Kitty thought, he would tell her about his teeth, that they were all his own.

She called in sick and went to bed and could not cry.\nAt the weekend, she drove her younger son to his soccer game in the Fifteen Acres. She had to park a distance away, because he was embarrassed by the car. Also, he did not like having his mother on the sidelines anymore, so Kitty, amused, went for a walk instead. She thought she might look for the deer. And, almost as she thought it, there they were, a herd of does and their fawns, standing or lying, and all of them chewing, watching, as she now watched, a pair of children and their toy plane buzzing at the other end of the glen.\nShe felt sure now that it had been a baby—that she had not been fooled. Her stomach was still warm and aching from it. The deer chewed on and did not mind her, while the toy plane buzzed and sputtered and fell to the ground.\nThe change of life.\nHer life was changing, that was for sure, though she seemed to be standing still. But up or down? she wondered. Up or down? The children threw the plane back into the air, and it circled again on the end of its wire. Kitty walked on. It had been a baby, she knew it. She had been visited. How could it be down, when she felt such joy. ♦",

        "story": "Kitty was suspicious of the escalator, or, more properly, the escalators, as there were two of them, one falling and one rising, anchored side by side in the middle of the main shopping floor. She disliked the push of the motor, and, under that, the light clacking sound of something she could not analyze. A chain perhaps, that ran loose, deep in the machine.\nThey were new. The space where they appeared had been boxed in for months, floor to ceiling, with cheap wooden panelling, painted blue. First, a hole was knocked in the floor, and then another in the ceiling above, she supposed. They worked at night, but even during the day men came out from behind the panelling, filthy and smiling, and went back in again: ordinary Dublin men who worked whenever, and installed escalators in the middle of the night. She wondered how much they were paid.\nKitty tried to take to them, but she couldn't. She was disturbed by the sight of them out among the merchandise. She disliked the way they talked to each other loudly and laughed as if they owned the shop. They interrupted the conversation, somehow. You'd be selling a bed, talking about springs, you'd be with a young couple, pushing into the mattress in a cozy sort of way, and who would stroll past but the lean blond one, maybe, with the dirty-looking tan, adjusting his zip on the way back from the loo.\nNot that she minded men. She had two grown sons at home, so she was used to it: the cheerfulness, the indifference, and the mess. Though sometimes she turned around in the kitchen and was shocked by the sheer size of them—all that protein and carbohydrate, the muscle and milk of them, as though she had fed a couple of potted plants, and grown triffids.\nThen, one morning, she walked in and the men were gone. The place was perfect; the carpets fresh and new, the hoarding dissolved into thin air, and, in the middle of the floor, a pair of escalators, one going up and the other coming down. The steps tugged lightly at each other as they passed, snagging and loosening all day long. They ticked in the corner of her eye, making her feel balanced, or dizzy, depending on the light. They were so clean. The up escalator always mounting itself, stair over stair; the down escalator falling like syrup, burying itself slowly in the flatness of the floor.\nThey were beautiful, and they never stopped, and finally they got on her nerves. Nothing happened in the Bed Department. People bought a bed, or they did not buy a bed. Kitty used to like the open space, the hummocky slabs of mattress, the headboards like tombstones in a giant graveyard. \"Who's been sleeping in my bed?\" But all her satisfaction was gone now. The way people lay down and curled up, in the middle of the crowd. The old couples sitting on either side of the mattress and looking over their shoulders at each other in a way that was almost coy; the giggles and the silences. Most people buying a bed were in love, she used to think, or hopeful at least of finding love. Now they just bounced up and down or put their dirty feet up or looked like they could kill for a decent night's sleep.\nShe was at home one evening, washing the dishes, when the phone rang. It was a young man who said he was looking for a Kevin Daly. Kitty was listed as K. Daly in the phone book, and she didn't want to give too much away. She said that there was no Kevin Daly at that number, and the young man asked if she was sure. He said that he was looking for a Kevin Daly he used to know, a man who had gone to school in Malahide. \"I'm sorry,\" Kitty said, but they were talking to each other now. He told her that Kevin Daly was his brother, long out of touch. Then he said that Kevin Daly was actually his father, but that he did not know he was his father, or he did not know that he was his son. He said that he was looking for his father because his mother was sick and that was why she had given him his father's name, finally—Kevin Daly, and the fact that he'd gone to school in Malahide. \"It was a schooltime romance,\" he said. Kitty just said \"Sorry\" a lot, the way you might say \"I see.\"\n\"Sorry,\" she said.\n\"So that's why—you know?\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nHe asked did she have a brother called Kevin Daly, or a cousin, and she just said, \"No, sorry.\" But he was quite insistent, as though she might be harboring the man. \"No really, I'm sorry,\" she said, and put down the phone.\nThe next day, Kitty expected someone to float down the escalator into the Bed Department and call her by name. She did not know who it might be. A girl, maybe, with green eyes, or a slender young boy. She imagined a man in a perfect black suit—something extra about him, anyway, like Cary Grant. A young man with curly red hair gazed at her—or through her—all the way from the floor above, and she wondered, bizarrely, if he was the person she was waiting for. Also what he might say to her, if he was.\nThen a figure did appear that made her heart turn, and it took a while before Kitty realized that it was her own mother, sailing down from Fabrics and Soft Furnishings like a queen.\nCritics at Large Live, featuring Julio Torres\n\"I didn't recognize you,\" Kitty said.\nHer mother was in town looking for a shower curtain and had thought she would pop in to say hello. But after that there was little enough to talk about. Kitty was used to seeing her at home; out in the open, she seemed surprisingly well dressed and mute.\n\"Well, you always know where to find me,\" Kitty said to her, with a stranger's smile.\nKitty ended up seducing a man from the local Drama Society, a little to his surprise. He had been courting her for months, but in an old-fashioned sort of way. He was sixty-plus, and Kitty was forty-plus; that was the kind of age gap you could expect, with two nearly grown sons. They were both in a production of \"Johnny Belinda,\" a play about a deaf-mute who gets pregnant, though it comes out right in the end. Kitty did the interval coffees and had a walk-on in the final scene; Tom, for that was the man's name, did the set. He was good with his hands, he said, as he bent over a sawhorse in the scene dock, and Kitty flicked a glance at him to see what he meant—but all he meant was that he was good at making things. Nice. In a way. He drove her home after rehearsal most nights, and one evening they stopped out to eat. After which, Kitty asked him in for a drink.\nTom. He said all he needed was a couple of hours to fit two dimmers where the old light switch was, but she'd need to redecorate, after. He looked at the photos on her mantelpiece. He was recently bereaved. His daughter had told him to join the Drama Society, so there he was. In a moment, Kitty thought, he would tell her about his teeth, that they were all his own. Faded brown eyes, silver hair, a handsome where-did-it-all-go-wrong face. They were on the sofa, safe enough. Kitty's older son lumbered in from the pub, and stayed to be introduced. Her younger one was upstairs with his own TV. They were nice boys. They did not expect their mother to seduce old geezers in the front room, and neither did the geezer. It was awkward all the way through, and quite satisfying. Kitty did not tell him about her ex-husband, as he did not talk about his dead wife. She did not tell him that her husband had strayed, that she had done everything to keep him, up to and including porn videos in the bedroom, and that, when she finally left, the judge held that desertion against her and awarded him the house. She did not tell him how her husband had moved a woman in, two weeks after walking out of court. She did not tell him how the boys had followed her eventually to her bedsit and looked after her, as only young boys can, how together they had made their way here, to the outer suburbs and a decent life. Nor did she tell him that she was pregnant, when she realized that she was pregnant. She just let him, and the Drama Society, lapse, soon after the curtain had rung down on \"Johnny Belinda,\" and before anyone could be surprised.\nAt first, she thought it was the change of life. She stood in the Bed Department and waited for hot flashes. She did not mind growing old as long as it meant growing easy, but it did not seem to be working out that way. There was an agitation, a turbulence in her blood. She rode all the way up to Accounts to query her pay slip, and she landed back down in the Bed Department with a thump. She walked the floor and sat on the beds. She had a terrible need to lie down on one of them. One Monday evening, during stocktaking, she actually did lie down. She simply reclined. She let her back sink into a double-sprung Slumberland, and felt she might never rise again.\nIt was not until she bought three pots of apricot jam that the penny dropped. She did not even bother to take a test. She felt that swooping blankness she had felt with each of the boys, so delicious, like diving into a pool and finding you can breathe. The child was no bigger than a pip in the flesh of her stomach. She took it for walks and little outings. She gave it a go on the escalators and on a park swing, scuffing the coarse sand under her feet and feeling a little mad. What would she tell the boys? As for the people in the Bed Department—Jackie, who shared the floor with her, and the customers who came in to look or buy—they all looked empty to her, like husks. As though she were the only real thing left. It was like that film with the pods, and she wanted to run away somewhere, to a deserted lighthouse, or a shack by the beach, and sit in a shaft of light while her baby grew.\nTom rang. His voice was a shock.\n\"I just thought I'd check up on you.\" He sounded close, he sounded right inside her ear. Kitty had to remind herself that there were miles of cable between them, a maze of electricity and static.\n\"I'm fine,\" she said. \"How are things?\"\n\"Good. Good.\"\nIn the pause, she felt sorry for him. He wasn't used to this kind of thing.\n\"And yourself?\" he said.\n\"Oh, flying,\" she said. \"Flying form.\" And he took the hint and let it go.\nThen, one morning, the down elevator sighed and stopped. People clumped down the steps carefully, almost aslant, squinting at the lines that were strangely solid now, though they still seemed to shift beneath their feet. Kitty was glad she wasn't on the thing when it ground to a halt. It would make you look so foolish. As it happened, the escalators were empty, apart from a young woman on the other side, who seemed to surge suddenly up. Whoosh.\nKitty knew it didn't mean anything, but she feared for her baby, which was now just eleven weeks old. She could not bear the lopsided sight of the stalled steps; they were like someone endlessly limping at the other end of the shop floor. She took a very long lunch, and when she came back a man had taken the panel off the bottom of the broken side. She was right about the chain—there it was, looping around the steps that were wedges, actually, when you looked at them side-on. They packed around the central pivot like big slices of metal pie, then separated out on the way up, dangling their triangular bases into space.\nThe escalator man glanced at her as she stared into the works, and then went back to his phase tester, tipping the metal gently here and there. He had hair on the backs of his hands, fine and light: one of those furry men with cushioned muscles and uncertain eyes. Kitty stood for a long time, making him uneasy. He glanced over his shoulder again, but he did not really see her—which was fine.\nKitty lost the baby at thirteen weeks, or lost something, at any rate. She looked at the blood on the wad of toilet paper and wondered if she was in the change of life, after all. Perhaps she had imagined the baby, perhaps it had never been there in the first place. She called in sick and went to bed and could not cry.\nAt the weekend, she drove her younger son to his soccer game in the Fifteen Acres.

Most people buying a bed were in love, she used to think, or hopeful at least of finding love. Now they just bounced up and down or put their dirty feet up or looked like they could kill for a decent night's sleep.\nShe was at home one evening, washing the dishes, when the phone rang. It was a young man who said he was looking for a Kevin Daly. Kitty was listed as K. Daly in the phone book, and she didn't want to give too much away. She said that there was no Kevin Daly at that number, and the young man asked if she was sure. He said that he was looking for a Kevin Daly he used to know, a man who had gone to school in Malahide. \"I'm sorry,\" Kitty said, but they were talking to each other now. He told her that Kevin Daly was his brother, long out of touch. Then he said that Kevin Daly was actually his father, but that he did not know he was his father, or he did not know that he was his son. He said that he was looking for his father because his mother was sick and that was why she had given him his father's name, finally—Kevin Daly, and the fact that he'd gone to school in Malahide. \"It was a schooltime romance,\" he said. Kitty just said \"Sorry\" a lot, the way you might say \"I see.\"\n\"Sorry,\" she said.\n\"So that's why—you know?\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nHe asked did she have a brother called Kevin Daly, or a cousin, and she just said, \"No, sorry.\" But he was quite insistent, as though she might be harboring the man. \"No really, I'm sorry,\" she said, and put down the phone.\nThe next day, Kitty expected someone to float down the escalator into the Bed Department and call her by name. She did not know who it might be. A girl, maybe, with green eyes, or a slender young boy. She imagined a man in a perfect black suit—something extra about him, anyway, like Cary Grant. A young man with curly red hair gazed at her—or through her—all the way from the floor above, and she wondered, bizarrely, if he was the person she was waiting for. Also what he might say to her, if he was.\nThen a figure did appear that made her heart turn, and it took a while before Kitty realized that it was her own mother, sailing down from Fabrics and Soft Furnishings like a queen.\nCritics at Large Live, featuring Julio Torres\n\"I didn't recognize you,\" Kitty said.\nHer mother was in town looking for a shower curtain and had thought she would pop in to say hello. But after that there was little enough to talk about. Kitty was used to seeing her at home; out in the open, she seemed surprisingly well dressed and mute.\n\"Well, you always know where to find me,\" Kitty said to her, with a stranger's smile.\nKitty ended up seducing a man from the local Drama Society, a little to his surprise. He had been courting her for months, but in an old-fashioned sort of way. He was sixty-plus, and Kitty was forty-plus; that was the kind of age gap you could expect, with two nearly grown sons. They were both in a production of \"Johnny Belinda,\" a play about a deaf-mute who gets pregnant, though it comes out right in the end. Kitty did the interval coffees and had a walk-on in the final scene; Tom, for that was the man's name, did the set. He was good with his hands, he said, as he bent over a sawhorse in the scene dock, and Kitty flicked a glance at him to see what he meant—but all he meant was that he was good at making things. Nice. In a way. He drove her home after rehearsal most nights, and one evening they stopped out to eat. After which, Kitty asked him in for a drink.\nTom. He said all he needed was a couple of hours to fit two dimmers where the old light switch was, but she'd need to redecorate, after. He looked at the photos on her mantelpiece. He was recently bereaved. His daughter had told him to join the Drama Society, so there he was. In a moment, Kitty thought, he would tell her about his teeth, that they were all his own. Faded brown eyes, silver hair, a handsome where-did-it-all-go-wrong face. They were on the sofa, safe enough. Kitty's older son lumbered in from the pub, and stayed to be introduced. Her younger one was upstairs with his own TV. They were nice boys. They did not expect their mother to seduce old geezers in the front room, and neither did the geezer. It was awkward all the way through, and quite satisfying. Kitty did not tell him about her ex-husband, as he did not talk about his dead wife. She did not tell him that her husband had strayed, that she had done everything to keep him, up to and including porn videos in the bedroom, and that, when she finally left, the judge held that desertion against her and awarded him the house. She did not tell him how her husband had moved a woman in, two weeks after walking out of court. She did not tell him how the boys had followed her eventually to her bedsit and looked after her, as only young boys can, how together they had made their way here, to the outer suburbs and a decent life. Nor did she tell him that she was pregnant, when she realized that she was pregnant. She just let him, and the Drama Society, lapse, soon after the curtain had rung down on \"Johnny Belinda,\" and before anyone could be surprised.\nAt first, she thought it was the change of life. She stood in the Bed Department and waited for hot flashes. She did not mind growing old as long as it meant growing easy, but it did not seem to be working out that way. There was an agitation, a turbulence in her blood. She rode all the way up to Accounts to query her pay slip, and she landed back down in the Bed Department with a thump. She walked the floor and sat on the beds. She had a terrible need to lie down on one of them. One Monday evening, during stocktaking, she actually did lie down. She simply reclined. She let her back sink into a double-sprung Slumberland, and felt she might never rise again.\nIt was not until she bought three pots of apricot jam that the penny dropped. She did not even bother to take a test. She felt that swooping blankness she had felt with each of the boys, so delicious, like diving into a pool and finding you can breathe. The child was no bigger than a pip in the flesh of her stomach. She took it for walks and little outings. She gave it a go on the escalators and on a park swing, scuffing the coarse sand under her feet and feeling a little mad. What would she tell the boys? As for the people in the Bed Department—Jackie, who shared the floor with her, and the customers who came in to look or buy—they all looked empty to her, like husks. As though she were the only real thing left. It was like that film with the pods, and she wanted to run away somewhere, to a deserted lighthouse, or a shack by the beach, and sit in a shaft of light while her baby grew.\nTom rang. His voice was a shock.\n\"I just thought I'd check up on you.\" He sounded close, he sounded right inside her ear. Kitty had to remind herself that there were miles of cable between them, a maze of electricity and static.\n\"I'm fine,\" she said. \"How are things?\"\n\"Good. Good.\"\nIn the pause, she felt sorry for him. He wasn't used to this kind of thing.\n\"And yourself?\" he said.\n\"Oh, flying,\" she said. \"Flying form.\" And he took the hint and let it go.\nThen, one morning, the down elevator sighed and stopped. People clumped down the steps carefully, almost aslant, squinting at the lines that were strangely solid now, though they still seemed to shift beneath their feet. Kitty was glad she wasn't on the thing when it ground to a halt. It would make you look so foolish. As it happened, the escalators were empty, apart from a young woman on the other side, who seemed to surge suddenly up. Whoosh.\nKitty knew it didn't mean anything, but she feared for her baby, which was now just eleven weeks old. She could not bear the lopsided sight of the stalled steps; they were like someone endlessly limping at the other end of the shop floor. She took a very long lunch, and when she came back a man had taken the panel off the bottom of the broken side. She was right about the chain—there it was, looping around the steps that were wedges, actually, when you looked at them side-on. They packed around the central pivot like big slices of metal pie, then separated out on the way up, dangling their triangular bases into space.\nThe escalator man glanced at her as she stared into the works, and then went back to his phase tester, tipping the metal gently here and there. He had hair on the backs of his hands, fine and light: one of those furry men with cushioned muscles and uncertain eyes. Kitty stood for a long time, making him uneasy. He glanced over his shoulder again, but he did not really see her—which was fine.\nKitty lost the baby at thirteen weeks, or lost something, at any rate. She looked at the blood on the wad of toilet paper and wondered if she was in the change of life, after all. Perhaps she had imagined the baby, perhaps it had never been there in the first place. She called in sick and went to bed and could not cry.\nAt the weekend, she drove her younger son to his soccer game in the Fifteen Acres. She had to park a distance away, because he was embarrassed by the car. Also, he did not like having his mother on the sidelines anymore, so Kitty, amused, went for a walk instead. She thought she might look for the deer. And, almost as she thought it, there they were, a herd of does and their fawns, standing or lying, and all of them chewing, watching, as she now watched, a pair of children and their toy plane buzzing at the other end of the glen.\nShe felt sure now that it had been a baby—that she had not been fooled. Her stomach was still warm and aching from it. The deer chewed on and did not mind her, while the toy plane buzzed and sputtered and fell to the ground.\nThe change of life.\nHer life was changing, that was for sure, though she seemed to be standing still. But up or down? she wondered. Up or down? The children threw the plane back into the air, and it circled again on the end of its wire. Kitty walked on. It had been a baby, she knew it. She had been visited. How could it be down, when she felt such joy. ♦",

        "story": "It was the year’s turning. These few hours like the blink of a great eye—just enough light to check that the world is still there, before shutting back down.\nSometime in the midafternoon, he had an impulse to go home, or go somewhere, and when he lifted his head, of course, it was dark outside. It just felt wrong. Two hours later, he was in the multi-story looking for his car and he couldn’t find the thing. It was like a lost dog. He clicked the key fob over and over, but there were no answering lights flashing orange on Level 2, where he usually parked, or on Level 3. He went up the little stairs to Level 4, then along the tiny path on the side of the ramp to 4A, brushing against the live cars that were stuck on the slope, nose to tail. He glanced into the windows as he went past and there was a gone look to the drivers’ faces; they’d already left for home.\nOut there, it was Christmas, but he did not think it was Christmas inside the multi-story, the only place in Dublin that had no fairy lights. He walked the last ramp to Level 5. Above him, the black concrete angles of the car-park roof gave way to the night sky, and the car was right there, out in the weather. He took a moment to glance up and around him at the longest night of the year.\nIt felt like the end of things. Made you want your religion back. He looked out over the landscape of west Dublin, the square industrial units set among dark young trees, and he entertained the possibility that it would not work this time. This time, the world would spin deeper into shadow. And, because the exit ramps were still jammed, he stayed a minute to check the solstice on his phone. For some reason, it didn’t always happen on the same day, but in 2016 it came just when you thought it should, on the twenty-first of December. Not at midnight, though—“the event,” as the Web site called it, would happen at 10:44 a.m. Irish time. Somewhere in that moment, whether he believed it or not, the sun would pause in the sky above him, or seem to pause. It would stop in its descent and start its slow journey back to summer and the middle of the sky.\nOr this year, he thought, it might not bother.\nThe M50 was at a crawl, and there was the usual nightmare getting off at the Tallaght exit. He could see the red tail-lights running in a sequence toward him until he pushed his own brake pedal down. It would be stop-start all the way to Manor Kilbride.\nA full forty minutes later, the dual carriageway turned into the old Blessington Road, and oncoming traffic shot by so close he flinched in the glare of the lights. This was the part of the journey that he loved best: the street lamps gave way to the idea of countryside, and there was a song on the radio as the road opened up ahead. The music made him feel like he could keep driving forever. It was a love song, or a sad song. It reminded him of a time in his life, some town he was in, he could not say where. The loss of that place made him unsure of this one. Or indifferent—as though he could clip an oncoming car and it wouldn’t matter. And he didn’t know what he was thinking, until a truck bellied past, sucking the air from the side of the car.\nIt gave him a fright. He checked all the mirrors and shifted in his seat, set his hands more deliberately on the steering wheel. After the turnoff, he followed his own headlights down a country lane, and when he got to the house he sat in the parked car for quite a while.\nThe night was very big out here.There were three texts on his phone; ten, fifteen minutes apart.\nWhen home?\nWill I put yr name in the pot?\nFood anyway, half-seven.\nWhen he comes in the door, there is the smell of cooking, the sound of pans and of water pouring into the sink. His daughter is failing to set the table and complaining about the Dakota Access Pipeline. “It’s, like, so unfair,” she says, and her family neither agrees nor disagrees, because that’s just asking for it. Ruth is fifteen. She is arguing with her own shadow, her mother, her teachers, none of whom care about the Dakota Access Pipeline, or not enough for her. “We live in County Wicklow,” her mother sometimes likes to remind her. But Ruth does not see what location has to do with anything, and he would admire this more, he might even take up the discussion, but she is back on her phone.\nHe glances over her shoulder and, for once, she lets him see.\n“What’s that?”\n“Just,” she says. A person called chikkenpenis has sent a funny picture to do with Kanye’s breakdown, a video clip that jerks and repeats, endlessly. It’s hard to know what the joke is. And what kind of person spells “penis” right and “chicken” with two “k”s?\nBridget Everett and Amy Sedaris talk with Inkoo Kang\n“Is that someone you know?”\nRuth just rolls her eyes, types with two thumbs. Cracks up laughing, saying, “Oh, my God. Oh, my God!”\nHe looks into the kitchen, where his wife is trying to serve up stir-fry out of a too-heavy pan. She is in her track pants. Upstairs all day, at a guess, translating some car manual for solid German euros. Her hair is in a scrunchie, which does not suit her. He tries to remember the song he heard on the radio as he goes over to help, but “Go, go. Out!” she says, and it is gone.\nHalfway through dinner, he becomes aware that Ross, his son, is talking to him about something or someone called Stripey. His son says that Stripey knew about death because he always went to Tiger’s grave. After a moment, he realizes that Stripey is a cat and so is Tiger. The ones at the childminder’s, when Ross was little. Cats from many years ago.\n“Animals believe in death,” his son says.\n“You think?” This is a big statement for a ten-year-old. “Maybe he was just waiting for the other cat to come back out of there. I mean, maybe he doesn’t know what the ground is. Maybe he doesn’t believe in the ground.”\nThe boy’s face goes still, and he looks at his plate.\nRuth goes, “Kcchchhhh,” does a Carrie hand out of the grave. And there is an immediate fight. Shouting, pushing.\n“Hey, hey, that’s enough!” he says.\nWhen they are settled, his wife casts a baleful look at him, and he shoots one back. What have I done now?\n“I think the cat was sad,” she says to Ross. “I think Stripey missed Tiger, don’t you?”\nShe has put her hand on the loose fist his own hand makes beside his plate. This is one of the things they fight about. Stop undermining your own son. Which irritates the hell out of him. Because the boy has to learn how to roll with the punches. “Could have been hungry,” he says. “Yum yum. Dead cat.”\nRuth starts to laugh. And Ross obliges him with a crooked smile.\nHis wife pushes back from the table, starts collecting the plates, though they are only just finished.\n“Sorry that was so,” she says. “It was just a rustle-up.”\n“Lovely,” he says.\nOh, great, he thinks. On the longest night, his wife with that look in her eye that says, Christmas is coming and it is all turning to shite.\nCorrection. His wife with a look that says, Christmas is coming and it is all your fault.\nHe pours a glass of wine and almost spills it on himself falling asleep on the sofa after the news. He was dreaming about weather, or discussing the weather with his dreaming self: all autumn it had been so dry, high pressure, clear skies, the leaves drying to dust on the trees, falling like smoke, they’d hung on so long. It occurs to him that Tiger was Stripey’s mother. The cat’s mother, no less. He says as much to his wife, who is sitting across the room. She looks at him.\n“Yes,” she says. And he suddenly remembers that his own mother is dead—a fact he manages to forget for days at a time.\n“You’d think they’d make a better go of the names,” he says.\nLater, he mutes the TV to check on a noise, and hears his daughter singing upstairs. She has her headphones on, her voice half in her head, half in the room.\n“Goddam truck,” he says. “Nearly had the wing mirror. You know the bend.”\n“Be careful,” his wife says. “This time of year, they’re all drinking.”\n“They’re all wrecked,” he says. “I was half asleep myself. No, not asleep.” She looks slightly shocked. “Just a bit.”\nUnmoored. That is the word he is looking for. Recently he feels—he has felt—unmoored.\nHe used to have a place in his mind where he could go. Hard to say where it was, but his mother has been dead since April, so maybe this was the place she used to occupy. Because he can’t go there anymore. It was the song reminded him.\n“I was listening to the radio,” he says.\n“The radio?”\nIt wasn’t like an inner monologue or anything; he did not sit around talking to his mother all day. It was more like a silence. He had lost a great and wonderful silence. The traffic came against him, and he felt unprotected, bullied by the lights. Because he had no one on his side anymore. Not even his wife.\n“Yes, the radio. In the car. You know, I wish, for once, you’d let me say something without repeating it back at me, like some kind of gom.”\nShe lets this sink in for a moment and then gets up out of the big armchair and leaves the room. He can hear the sound of her starting to unload the dishwasher in the kitchen.\nAnd “Mutual!” he wants to shout after her. “Fucking mutual!” He wants to tell her how he sat in the car, outside his own house, thinking, Whatever happens when I walk in the door, that’s the thing. When I walk in the door, I will find it. The answer or the question, one or the other. It will be there.\nAnd what did he find? These people. This.\nEven in her sleep she is affronted, her body straight in the bed beside him, her head twisted to face the wall. The earth spins them toward morning, and he cannot close his eyes for the vertigo; he has to urge it on. He wakes without knowing he has slept, and the house is busy around him—the sound of the front door, finally, and silence. It is after nine o’clock, but when he comes into the kitchen Ross is still at the table, stuck on his phone.\n“It’s the Christmas concert,” his son says, as if that explains something.\nThe office is closed but he still has a mad number of payments to process before the end of the year, so he takes a coffee back to bed and opens his laptop there.\nHe clicks on a spreadsheet, then he starts reading the news instead and wandering about online.\nRoss comes in to show him something. He climbs across the duvet, bringing the phone screen so close that his father has to push the thing a distance away. It is a video of two tigers, play-fighting in the Siberian snow.\nThey are pretty impressive, the tigers.\n“Fantastic,” he says.\nAnd Ross is so pleased his cheeks glow with it.\nIt is 10:38 and, outside, the sun has not cleared the tops of the winter trees.\n“Look up ‘solstice,’ ” he says, spelling it out for him and then typing it on his own keyboard, because he is running out of time now. He has six minutes to do this, to tell his child that the world will keep turning. No matter what happens, the sun will always rise in the morning, the planet’s orbit will tilt them toward the light. He finds a video clip of a cartoon earth circling a harmless, small sun, but Ross says he already knows about the solstice. They covered it at school.\nIt is 10:42.\nThe boy is sitting cross-legged on the bed beside him. Ross shuts his eyes, and “Sh-h-h,” he says. “Is it happening?”\n“In a minute.”\n“Is it now?”\nThe seconds pass. The boy squeezes his eyelids tighter.\n“Now?”\n“Yes.”\nRoss keeps his eyes shut for another moment, then punches the air. He turns to his dad and they look at each other, full of mischief and amazement. Because it happened. Nothing happened, but they know it was there. The tiny stretch of daylight that will become summer.\nHis wife is home. She is standing in the doorway watching them. They look up and smile at her.\n“What?” she says. ♦",

You know the bend.”\n“Be careful,” his wife says. “This time of year, they’re all drinking.”\n“They’re all wrecked,” he says. “I was half asleep myself. No, not asleep.” She looks slightly shocked. “Just a bit.”\nUnmoored. That is the word he is looking for. Recently he feels—he has felt—unmoored.\nHe used to have a place in his mind where he could go. Hard to say where it was, but his mother has been dead since April, so maybe this was the place she used to occupy. Because he can’t go there anymore. It was the song reminded him.\n“I was listening to the radio,” he says.\n“The radio?”\nIt wasn’t like an inner monologue or anything; he did not sit around talking to his mother all day. It was more like a silence. He had lost a great and wonderful silence. The traffic came against him, and he felt unprotected, bullied by the lights. Because he had no one on his side anymore. Not even his wife.\n“Yes, the radio. In the car. You know, I wish, for once, you’d let me say something without repeating it back at me, like some kind of gom.”\nShe lets this sink in for a moment and then gets up out of the big armchair and leaves the room. He can hear the sound of her starting to unload the dishwasher in the kitchen.\nAnd “Mutual!” he wants to shout after her. “Fucking mutual!” He wants to tell her how he sat in the car, outside his own house, thinking, Whatever happens when I walk in the door, that’s the thing. When I walk in the door, I will find it. The answer or the question, one or the other. It will be there.\nAnd what did he find? These people. This.\nEven in her sleep she is affronted, her body straight in the bed beside him, her head twisted to face the wall. The earth spins them toward morning, and he cannot close his eyes for the vertigo; he has to urge it on. He wakes without knowing he has slept, and the house is busy around him—the sound of the front door, finally, and silence. It is after nine o’clock, but when he comes into the kitchen Ross is still at the table, stuck on his phone.\n“It’s the Christmas concert,” his son says, as if that explains something.\nThe office is closed but he still has a mad number of payments to process before the end of the year, so he takes a coffee back to bed and opens his laptop there.\nHe clicks on a spreadsheet, then he starts reading the news instead and wandering about online.\nRoss comes in to show him something. He climbs across the duvet, bringing the phone screen so close that his father has to push the thing a distance away. It is a video of two tigers, play-fighting in the Siberian snow.\nThey are pretty impressive, the tigers.\n“Fantastic,” he says.\nAnd Ross is so pleased his cheeks glow with it.\nIt is 10:38 and, outside, the sun has not cleared the tops of the winter trees.\n“Look up ‘solstice,’ ” he says, spelling it out for him and then typing it on his own keyboard, because he is running out of time now. He has six minutes to do this, to tell his child that the world will keep turning. No matter what happens, the sun will always rise in the morning, the planet’s orbit will tilt them toward the light. He finds a video clip of a cartoon earth circling a harmless, small sun, but Ross says he already knows about the solstice. They covered it at school.\nIt is 10:42.\nThe boy is sitting cross-legged on the bed beside him. Ross shuts his eyes, and “Sh-h-h,” he says. “Is it happening?”\n“In a minute.”\n“Is it now?”\nThe seconds pass. The boy squeezes his eyelids tighter.\n“Now?”\n“Yes.”\nRoss keeps his eyes shut for another moment, then punches the air. He turns to his dad and they look at each other, full of mischief and amazement. Because it happened. Nothing happened, but they know it was there. The tiny stretch of daylight that will become summer.\nHis wife is home. She is standing in the doorway watching them. They look up and smile at her.\n“What?” she says. ♦",

        "story": "It was the year’s turning. These few hours like the blink of a great eye—just enough light to check that the world is still there, before shutting back down.\nSometime in the midafternoon, he had an impulse to go home, or go somewhere, and when he lifted his head, of course, it was dark outside. It just felt wrong. Two hours later, he was in the multi-story looking for his car and he couldn’t find the thing. It was like a lost dog. He clicked the key fob over and over, but there were no answering lights flashing orange on Level 2, where he usually parked, or on Level 3. He went up the little stairs to Level 4, then along the tiny path on the side of the ramp to 4A, brushing against the live cars that were stuck on the slope, nose to tail. He glanced into the windows as he went past and there was a gone look to the drivers’ faces; they’d already left for home.\nOut there, it was Christmas, but he did not think it was Christmas inside the multi-story, the only place in Dublin that had no fairy lights. He walked the last ramp to Level 5. Above him, the black concrete angles of the car-park roof gave way to the night sky, and the car was right there, out in the weather. He took a moment to glance up and around him at the longest night of the year.\nIt felt like the end of things. Made you want your religion back. He looked out over the landscape of west Dublin, the square industrial units set among dark young trees, and he entertained the possibility that it would not work this time. This time, the world would spin deeper into shadow. And, because the exit ramps were still jammed, he stayed a minute to check the solstice on his phone. For some reason, it didn’t always happen on the same day, but in 2016 it came just when you thought it should, on the twenty-first of December. Not at midnight, though—“the event,” as the Web site called it, would happen at 10:44 a.m. Irish time. Somewhere in that moment, whether he believed it or not, the sun would pause in the sky above him, or seem to pause. It would stop in its descent and start its slow journey back to summer and the middle of the sky.\nOr this year, he thought, it might not bother.\nThe M50 was at a crawl, and there was the usual nightmare getting off at the Tallaght exit. He could see the red tail-lights running in a sequence toward him until he pushed his own brake pedal down. It would be stop-start all the way to Manor Kilbride.\nA full forty minutes later, the dual carriageway turned into the old Blessington Road, and oncoming traffic shot by so close he flinched in the glare of the lights. This was the part of the journey that he loved best: the street lamps gave way to the idea of countryside, and there was a song on the radio as the road opened up ahead. The music made him feel like he could keep driving forever. It was a love song, or a sad song. It reminded him of a time in his life, some town he was in, he could not say where. The loss of that place made him unsure of this one. Or indifferent—as though he could clip an oncoming car and it wouldn’t matter. And he didn’t know what he was thinking, until a truck bellied past, sucking the air from the side of the car.\nIt gave him a fright. He checked all the mirrors and shifted in his seat, set his hands more deliberately on the steering wheel. After the turnoff, he followed his own headlights down a country lane, and when he got to the house he sat in the parked car for quite a while.\nThe night was very big out here.There were three texts on his phone; ten, fifteen minutes apart.\nWhen home?\nWill I put yr name in the pot?\nFood anyway, half-seven.\nWhen he comes in the door, there is the smell of cooking, the sound of pans and of water pouring into the sink. His daughter is failing to set the table and complaining about the Dakota Access Pipeline. “It’s, like, so unfair,” she says, and her family neither agrees nor disagrees, because that’s just asking for it. Ruth is fifteen. She is arguing with her own shadow, her mother, her teachers, none of whom care about the Dakota Access Pipeline, or not enough for her. “We live in County Wicklow,” her mother sometimes likes to remind her. But Ruth does not see what location has to do with anything, and he would admire this more, he might even take up the discussion, but she is back on her phone.\nHe glances over her shoulder and, for once, she lets him see.\n“What’s that?”\n“Just,” she says. A person called chikkenpenis has sent a funny picture to do with Kanye’s breakdown, a video clip that jerks and repeats, endlessly. It’s hard to know what the joke is. And what kind of person spells “penis” right and “chicken” with two “k”s?\nBridget Everett and Amy Sedaris talk with Inkoo Kang\n“Is that someone you know?”\nRuth just rolls her eyes, types with two thumbs. Cracks up laughing, saying, “Oh, my God. Oh, my God!”\nHe looks into the kitchen, where his wife is trying to serve up stir-fry out of a too-heavy pan. She is in her track pants. Upstairs all day, at a guess, translating some car manual for solid German euros. Her hair is in a scrunchie, which does not suit her. He tries to remember the song he heard on the radio as he goes over to help, but “Go, go. Out!” she says, and it is gone.\nHalfway through dinner, he becomes aware that Ross, his son, is talking to him about something or someone called Stripey. His son says that Stripey knew about death because he always went to Tiger’s grave. After a moment, he realizes that Stripey is a cat and so is Tiger. The ones at the childminder’s, when Ross was little. Cats from many years ago.\n“Animals believe in death,” his son says.\n“You think?” This is a big statement for a ten-year-old. “Maybe he was just waiting for the other cat to come back out of there. I mean, maybe he doesn’t know what the ground is. Maybe he doesn’t believe in the ground.”\nThe boy’s face goes still, and he looks at his plate.\nRuth goes, “Kcchchhhh,” does a Carrie hand out of the grave. And there is an immediate fight. Shouting, pushing.\n“Hey, hey, that’s enough!” he says.\nWhen they are settled, his wife casts a baleful look at him, and he shoots one back. What have I done now?\n“I think the cat was sad,” she says to Ross. “I think Stripey missed Tiger, don’t you?”\nShe has put her hand on the loose fist his own hand makes beside his plate. This is one of the things they fight about. Stop undermining your own son. Which irritates the hell out of him. Because the boy has to learn how to roll with the punches. “Could have been hungry,” he says. “Yum yum. Dead cat.”\nRuth starts to laugh. And Ross obliges him with a crooked smile.\nHis wife pushes back from the table, starts collecting the plates, though they are only just finished.\n“Sorry that was so,” she says. “It was just a rustle-up.”\n“Lovely,” he says.\nOh, great, he thinks. On the longest night, his wife with that look in her eye that says, Christmas is coming and it is all turning to shite.\nCorrection. His wife with a look that says, Christmas is coming and it is all your fault.\nHe pours a glass of wine and almost spills it on himself falling asleep on the sofa after the news. He was dreaming about weather, or discussing the weather with his dreaming self: all autumn it had been so dry, high pressure, clear skies, the leaves drying to dust on the trees, falling like smoke, they’d hung on so long. It occurs to him that Tiger was Stripey’s mother. The cat’s mother, no less. He says as much to his wife, who is sitting across the room. She looks at him.\n“Yes,” she says. And he suddenly remembers that his own mother is dead—a fact he manages to forget for days at a time.\n“You’d think they’d make a better go of the names,” he says.\nLater, he mutes the TV to check on a noise, and hears his daughter singing upstairs. She has her headphones on, her voice half in her head, half in the room.\n“Goddam truck,” he says. “Nearly had the wing mirror. You know the bend.”\n“Be careful,” his wife says. “This time of year, they’re all drinking.”\n“They’re all wrecked,” he says. “I was half asleep myself. No, not asleep.” She looks slightly shocked. “Just a bit.”\nUnmoored. That is the word he is looking for.

        "writing_prompt": "In 1971, you cooked spaghetti obsessively, as if each strand held the key to understanding your solitude. One rainy afternoon, the phone rang, and a voice from the past asked for help. What do you do when the comfort of boiling pasta collides with the weight of someone else's troubles?",
        "story": "Nineteen-seventy-one was the Year of Spaghetti.\nIn 1971, I cooked spaghetti to live, and lived to cook spaghetti. Steam rising from the pot was my pride and joy, tomato sauce bubbling up in the saucepan my one great hope in life.\nPublished in the print edition of the November 21, 2005, issue.\nI went to a cooking specialty store and bought a kitchen timer and a huge aluminum pot, big enough to bathe a German shepherd in, then went around to all the supermarkets that catered to foreigners, gathering an assortment of odd-sounding spices. I picked up a pasta cookbook at the bookstore, and bought tomatoes by the dozen. I purchased every brand of spaghetti I could lay my hands on, simmered every sauce known to man. Fine particles of garlic, onion, and olive oil swirled in the air, forming a harmonious cloud that penetrated every corner of my tiny apartment, permeating the floor and the ceiling and the walls, my clothes, my books, my records, my tennis racquet, my bundles of old letters. It was a fragrance one might have smelled on ancient Roman aqueducts.\nThis is a story from the Year of Spaghetti, 1971 A.D.\nAs a rule, I cooked spaghetti, and ate it, by myself. I was convinced that spaghetti was a dish best enjoyed alone. I can’t really explain why I felt that way, but there it is.\nI always drank tea with my spaghetti and ate a simple lettuce-and-cucumber salad. I’d make sure I had plenty of both. I laid everything out neatly on the table and enjoyed a leisurely meal, glancing at the paper as I ate. From Sunday to Saturday, one Spaghetti Day followed another. And each new Sunday started a brand-new Spaghetti Week.\nEvery time I sat down to a plate of spaghetti—especially on a rainy afternoon—I had the distinct feeling that somebody was about to knock on my door. The person who I imagined was about to visit me was different each time. Sometimes it was a stranger, sometimes someone I knew. Once, it was a girl with slim legs whom I’d dated in high school, and once it was myself, from a few years back, come to pay a visit. Another time, it was William Holden, with Jennifer Jones on his arm.\nWilliam Holden?\nNot one of these people, however, actually ventured into my apartment. They hovered just outside the door, without knocking, like fragments of memory, and then slipped away.\nSpring, summer, and fall, I cooked and cooked, as if cooking spaghetti were an act of revenge. Like a lonely, jilted girl throwing old love letters into the fireplace, I tossed one handful of spaghetti after another into the pot.\nI’d gather up the trampled-down shadows of time, knead them into the shape of a German shepherd, toss them into the roiling water, and sprinkle them with salt. Then I’d hover over the pot, oversized chopsticks in hand, until the timer dinged its plaintive note.\nSpaghetti strands are a crafty bunch, and I couldn’t let them out of my sight. If I were to turn my back, they might well slip over the edge of the pot and vanish into the night. The night lay in silent ambush, hoping to waylay the prodigal strands.\nSpaghetti alla parmigiana\nSpaghetti alla napoletana\nSpaghetti al cartoccio\nSpaghetti aglio e olio\nSpaghetti alla carbonara\nSpaghetti della pina\nAnd then there was the pitiful, nameless leftover spaghetti carelessly tossed into the fridge.\nA Public Defender's Radical Approach to Representing The January 6th Rioters\nBorn in heat, the strands of spaghetti washed down the river of 1971 and vanished.\nI mourn them all—all the spaghetti of the year 1971.\nWhen the phone rang at 3:20 p.m. I was sprawled out on the tatami, staring at the ceiling. A pool of winter sunlight had formed in the place where I lay. Like a dead fly I lay there, vacant, in a December spotlight.\nAt first, I didn’t recognize the sound as the phone ringing. It was more like an unfamiliar memory that had hesitantly slipped in between the layers of air. Finally, though, it began to take shape, and, in the end, a ringing phone was unmistakably what it was. It was one hundred per cent a phone ring in one-hundred-per-cent real air. Still sprawled out, I reached over and picked up the receiver.\nOn the other end was a girl, a girl so indistinct that, by four-thirty, she might very well have disappeared altogether. She was the ex-girlfriend of a friend of mine. Something had brought them together, this guy and this indistinct girl, and something had led them to break up. I had, I admit, reluctantly played a role in getting them together in the first place.\n“Sorry to bother you,” she said, “but do you know where he is now?”\nI looked at the phone, running my eyes along the length of the cord. The cord was, sure enough, attached to the phone. I managed a vague reply. There was something ominous in the girl’s voice, and whatever trouble was brewing I knew that I didn’t want to get involved.\n“Nobody will tell me where he is,” she said in a chilly tone. “Everybody’s pretending they don’t know. But there’s something important I have to tell him, so please—tell me where he is. I promise I won’t drag you into this. Where is he?”\n“I honestly don’t know,” I told her. “I haven’t seen him in a long time.” My voice didn’t sound like my own. I was telling the truth about not having seen him for a long time, but not about the other part—I did know his address and phone number. Whenever I tell a lie, something weird happens to my voice.\nNo comment from her.\nThe phone was like a pillar of ice.\nThen all the objects around me turned into pillars of ice, as if I were in a J. G. Ballard science-fiction story.\n“I really don’t know,” I repeated. “He went away a long time ago, without saying a word.”\nThe girl laughed. “Give me a break. He’s not that clever. We’re talking about a guy who has to make a lot of noise no matter what he does.”\nShe was right. The guy really was a bit of a dim bulb.\nBut I wasn’t about to tell her where he was. Do that, and next I’d have him on the phone, giving me an earful. I was through with getting caught up in other people’s messes. I’d already dug a hole in the back yard and buried everything that needed to be buried in it. Nobody could ever dig it up again.\n“I’m sorry,” I said.\n“You don’t like me, do you?” she said suddenly.\nI had no idea what to say. I didn’t particularly dislike her. I had no real impression of her at all. It’s hard to have a bad impression of somebody you have no impression of.\n“I’m sorry,” I said again. “But I’m cooking spaghetti right now.”\n“I’m sorry?”\n“I said I’m cooking spaghetti,” I lied. I had no idea why I said that. But the lie had already become a part of me—so much so that, at that moment at least, it didn’t feel like a lie at all.\nI went ahead and filled an imaginary pot with imaginary water, lit an imaginary stove with an imaginary match.\n“So?” she asked.\nI sprinkled imaginary salt into the boiling water, gently lowered a handful of imaginary spaghetti into the imaginary pot, set the imaginary kitchen timer for eight minutes.\n“So I can’t talk. The spaghetti will be ruined.”\nShe didn’t say anything.\n“I’m really sorry, but cooking spaghetti is a delicate operation.”\nThe girl was silent. The phone in my hand began to freeze again.\n“So could you call me back?” I added hurriedly.\n“Because you’re in the middle of making spaghetti?” she asked.\n“Yeah.”\n“Are you making it for someone, or are you going to eat alone?”\n“I’ll eat it by myself,” I said.\nShe held her breath for a long time, then slowly breathed out. “There’s no way you could know this, but I’m really in trouble. I don’t know what to do.”\n“I’m sorry I can’t help you,” I said.\n“There’s some money involved, too.”\n“I see.”\n“He owes me money,” she said. “I lent him some money. I shouldn’t have, but I had to.”\nI was quiet for a minute, my thoughts drifting toward spaghetti. “I’m sorry,” I said. “But I’ve got the spaghetti going, so . . .”\nShe gave a listless laugh. “Goodbye,” she said. “Say hi to your spaghetti for me. I hope it turns out O.K.”\n“Bye,” I said.\nWhen I hung up the phone, the circle of light on the floor had shifted an inch or two. I lay down again in that pool of light and resumed staring at the ceiling.\nThinking about spaghetti that boils eternally but is never done is a sad, sad thing.\nNow I regret, a little, that I didn’t tell the girl anything. Perhaps I should have. I mean, her ex-boyfriend wasn’t much to start with—an empty shell of a guy with artistic pretensions, a great talker whom nobody trusted. She sounded as if she really were strapped for money, and, no matter what the situation, you’ve got to pay back what you borrow.\nSometimes I wonder what happened to the girl—the thought usually pops into my mind when I’m facing a steaming-hot plate of spaghetti. After she hung up the phone, did she disappear forever, sucked into the 4:30 p.m. shadows? Was I partly to blame?\nI want you to understand my position, though. At the time, I didn’t want to get involved with anyone. That’s why I kept on cooking spaghetti, all by myself. In that huge pot, big enough to hold a German shepherd.\nDurum semolina, golden wheat wafting in Italian fields.\nCan you imagine how astonished the Italians would be if they knew that what they were exporting in 1971 was really loneliness? ♦",

It’s hard to have a bad impression of somebody you have no impression of.\n“I’m sorry,” I said again. “But I’m cooking spaghetti right now.”\n“I’m sorry?”\n“I said I’m cooking spaghetti,” I lied. I had no idea why I said that. But the lie had already become a part of me—so much so that, at that moment at least, it didn’t feel like a lie at all.\nI went ahead and filled an imaginary pot with imaginary water, lit an imaginary stove with an imaginary match.\n“So?” she asked.\nI sprinkled imaginary salt into the boiling water, gently lowered a handful of imaginary spaghetti into the imaginary pot, set the imaginary kitchen timer for eight minutes.\n“So I can’t talk. The spaghetti will be ruined.”\nShe didn’t say anything.\n“I’m really sorry, but cooking spaghetti is a delicate operation.”\nThe girl was silent. The phone in my hand began to freeze again.\n“So could you call me back?” I added hurriedly.\n“Because you’re in the middle of making spaghetti?” she asked.\n“Yeah.”\n“Are you making it for someone, or are you going to eat alone?”\n“I’ll eat it by myself,” I said.\nShe held her breath for a long time, then slowly breathed out. “There’s no way you could know this, but I’m really in trouble. I don’t know what to do.”\n“I’m sorry I can’t help you,” I said.\n“There’s some money involved, too.”\n“I see.”\n“He owes me money,” she said. “I lent him some money. I shouldn’t have, but I had to.”\nI was quiet for a minute, my thoughts drifting toward spaghetti. “I’m sorry,” I said. “But I’ve got the spaghetti going, so . . .”\nShe gave a listless laugh. “Goodbye,” she said. “Say hi to your spaghetti for me. I hope it turns out O.K.”\n“Bye,” I said.\nWhen I hung up the phone, the circle of light on the floor had shifted an inch or two. I lay down again in that pool of light and resumed staring at the ceiling.\nThinking about spaghetti that boils eternally but is never done is a sad, sad thing.\nNow I regret, a little, that I didn’t tell the girl anything. Perhaps I should have. I mean, her ex-boyfriend wasn’t much to start with—an empty shell of a guy with artistic pretensions, a great talker whom nobody trusted. She sounded as if she really were strapped for money, and, no matter what the situation, you’ve got to pay back what you borrow.\nSometimes I wonder what happened to the girl—the thought usually pops into my mind when I’m facing a steaming-hot plate of spaghetti. After she hung up the phone, did she disappear forever, sucked into the 4:30 p.m. shadows? Was I partly to blame?\nI want you to understand my position, though. At the time, I didn’t want to get involved with anyone. That’s why I kept on cooking spaghetti, all by myself. In that huge pot, big enough to hold a German shepherd.\nDurum semolina, golden wheat wafting in Italian fields.\nCan you imagine how astonished the Italians would be if they knew that what they were exporting in 1971 was really loneliness? ♦",

        "story": "Nineteen-seventy-one was the Year of Spaghetti.\nIn 1971, I cooked spaghetti to live, and lived to cook spaghetti. Steam rising from the pot was my pride and joy, tomato sauce bubbling up in the saucepan my one great hope in life.\nPublished in the print edition of the November 21, 2005, issue.\nI went to a cooking specialty store and bought a kitchen timer and a huge aluminum pot, big enough to bathe a German shepherd in, then went around to all the supermarkets that catered to foreigners, gathering an assortment of odd-sounding spices. I picked up a pasta cookbook at the bookstore, and bought tomatoes by the dozen. I purchased every brand of spaghetti I could lay my hands on, simmered every sauce known to man. Fine particles of garlic, onion, and olive oil swirled in the air, forming a harmonious cloud that penetrated every corner of my tiny apartment, permeating the floor and the ceiling and the walls, my clothes, my books, my records, my tennis racquet, my bundles of old letters. It was a fragrance one might have smelled on ancient Roman aqueducts.\nThis is a story from the Year of Spaghetti, 1971 A.D.\nAs a rule, I cooked spaghetti, and ate it, by myself. I was convinced that spaghetti was a dish best enjoyed alone. I can’t really explain why I felt that way, but there it is.\nI always drank tea with my spaghetti and ate a simple lettuce-and-cucumber salad. I’d make sure I had plenty of both. I laid everything out neatly on the table and enjoyed a leisurely meal, glancing at the paper as I ate. From Sunday to Saturday, one Spaghetti Day followed another. And each new Sunday started a brand-new Spaghetti Week.\nEvery time I sat down to a plate of spaghetti—especially on a rainy afternoon—I had the distinct feeling that somebody was about to knock on my door. The person who I imagined was about to visit me was different each time. Sometimes it was a stranger, sometimes someone I knew. Once, it was a girl with slim legs whom I’d dated in high school, and once it was myself, from a few years back, come to pay a visit. Another time, it was William Holden, with Jennifer Jones on his arm.\nWilliam Holden?\nNot one of these people, however, actually ventured into my apartment. They hovered just outside the door, without knocking, like fragments of memory, and then slipped away.\nSpring, summer, and fall, I cooked and cooked, as if cooking spaghetti were an act of revenge. Like a lonely, jilted girl throwing old love letters into the fireplace, I tossed one handful of spaghetti after another into the pot.\nI’d gather up the trampled-down shadows of time, knead them into the shape of a German shepherd, toss them into the roiling water, and sprinkle them with salt. Then I’d hover over the pot, oversized chopsticks in hand, until the timer dinged its plaintive note.\nSpaghetti strands are a crafty bunch, and I couldn’t let them out of my sight. If I were to turn my back, they might well slip over the edge of the pot and vanish into the night. The night lay in silent ambush, hoping to waylay the prodigal strands.\nSpaghetti alla parmigiana\nSpaghetti alla napoletana\nSpaghetti al cartoccio\nSpaghetti aglio e olio\nSpaghetti alla carbonara\nSpaghetti della pina\nAnd then there was the pitiful, nameless leftover spaghetti carelessly tossed into the fridge.\nA Public Defender's Radical Approach to Representing The January 6th Rioters\nBorn in heat, the strands of spaghetti washed down the river of 1971 and vanished.\nI mourn them all—all the spaghetti of the year 1971.\nWhen the phone rang at 3:20 p.m. I was sprawled out on the tatami, staring at the ceiling. A pool of winter sunlight had formed in the place where I lay. Like a dead fly I lay there, vacant, in a December spotlight.\nAt first, I didn’t recognize the sound as the phone ringing. It was more like an unfamiliar memory that had hesitantly slipped in between the layers of air. Finally, though, it began to take shape, and, in the end, a ringing phone was unmistakably what it was. It was one hundred per cent a phone ring in one-hundred-per-cent real air. Still sprawled out, I reached over and picked up the receiver.\nOn the other end was a girl, a girl so indistinct that, by four-thirty, she might very well have disappeared altogether. She was the ex-girlfriend of a friend of mine. Something had brought them together, this guy and this indistinct girl, and something had led them to break up. I had, I admit, reluctantly played a role in getting them together in the first place.\n“Sorry to bother you,” she said, “but do you know where he is now?”\nI looked at the phone, running my eyes along the length of the cord. The cord was, sure enough, attached to the phone. I managed a vague reply. There was something ominous in the girl’s voice, and whatever trouble was brewing I knew that I didn’t want to get involved.\n“Nobody will tell me where he is,” she said in a chilly tone. “Everybody’s pretending they don’t know. But there’s something important I have to tell him, so please—tell me where he is. I promise I won’t drag you into this. Where is he?”\n“I honestly don’t know,” I told her. “I haven’t seen him in a long time.” My voice didn’t sound like my own. I was telling the truth about not having seen him for a long time, but not about the other part—I did know his address and phone number. Whenever I tell a lie, something weird happens to my voice.\nNo comment from her.\nThe phone was like a pillar of ice.\nThen all the objects around me turned into pillars of ice, as if I were in a J. G. Ballard science-fiction story.\n“I really don’t know,” I repeated. “He went away a long time ago, without saying a word.”\nThe girl laughed. “Give me a break. He’s not that clever. We’re talking about a guy who has to make a lot of noise no matter what he does.”\nShe was right. The guy really was a bit of a dim bulb.\nBut I wasn’t about to tell her where he was. Do that, and next I’d have him on the phone, giving me an earful. I was through with getting caught up in other people’s messes. I’d already dug a hole in the back yard and buried everything that needed to be buried in it. Nobody could ever dig it up again.\n“I’m sorry,” I said.\n“You don’t like me, do you?” she said suddenly.\nI had no idea what to say. I didn’t particularly dislike her. I had no real impression of her at all. It’s hard to have a bad impression of somebody you have no impression of.\n“I’m sorry,” I said again. “But I’m cooking spaghetti right now.”\n“I’m sorry?”\n“I said I’m cooking spaghetti,” I lied.
