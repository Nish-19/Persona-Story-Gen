#### Writing Prompt ####
On their seven-year anniversary, Will and Nico build a snowman named Edgar, share hot chocolate, and settle in for a cozy night of cheesy holiday movies—but something about Edgar in the backyard feels... oddly alive.


#### Story ####
Outside the snow fell steadily, softly blanketing the ground with crystals. The cold nipped at Will’s skin, the snowflakes dancing around him and settling in his hair. His cheeks were flushes and his eyes sparkled with excitement.
Nico stood (with one of Will’s jumpers on under a large coat, his ears hidden by a beanie and enormous boots leaving patterned footprints) observing his snowmen and adding the finishing touches whilst Will adored from behind him. The snowman was about an inch taller than Nico with onions for eyes, celery for a nose, pebble buttons and a crooked, pebble smile. Two arms sticking in different directions were buried in the snowman's sides and a red scarf hung around its neck.
Nico turned to Will, eyes bright and a grin on his pinkened face.
"What shall we call it?" he asked, taking a step back and leaning into Will’s side. It was a natural action by now after seven years of bliss and three years building snowmen in a backgarden they actually owned. Will thought for a moment.
"Edgar."
"Edgar?" Nico snorted. Will jabbed his side playfully.
"Hey, don't be rude to Edgar!"
Nico rolled his eyes with a quiet chuckle. "Edgar it is now shall we go inside? It's freezing."
Will nodded and they hurried into the warmth, leaving Edgar to enjoy his newfound life. They took off their coats and boots and Will sent Nico to set a film up whilst he made hot chocolate with marshmallows and whipped cream.
Whilst he made the drinks, Will thought of his mother. They were going to see her on Christmas Eve and sleep over. They'd spend half of Christmas Day with her and the other half visiting Hazel, Frank and Reyna. On Boxing Day was the annual Camp Halfblood feast that all demigods were invited to so they'd get to see their friends. Nico and Will hadn't seen them for a while and of course they were looking forward to seeing Chiron and Mr. D too.
Will set the mugs on a tray and carried it through. Nico sat curled up on the sofa drowning in several frayed blankets and flicking through the options on TV. Will smiled and set down the drinks on the coffee table, kissing Nico’s head and sitting beside him whilst taking some of the blankets for his own. Nico automatically turned to curl into Will and Will’s arms automatically wrapped around his shoulders to bring him closer. They merged close enough to almost become one.
"Which cheesy movie today?" Nico pondered. "A Christmas Carol?"
Will perked up in interest. "Can we watched the Muppet version?"
Nico rolled his eyes affectionately and kissed Will’s collarbone chastely.
"Sure, tesoro."
As the movie started playing, Will kissed Nico’s head again and used a finger to guide Nico’s jaw up so that their eyes could meet.
"Happy seven year anniversary, darlin'," he said.
"And to you, Doc." Nico grinned, leaning up for a kiss.
The rest of the night was filled with movies, marshmallows and making out. It couldn't have been a better anniversary.
