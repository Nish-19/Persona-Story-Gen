#### Story ####
Despite what has been written, leisure was not rare in the Holmes-Watson household.
It was a calm if chilly autumn afternoon and Mr Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson, late of 221b Baker Street, London, were leisurely occupying the time before their habitual evening walk by reading together on their couch, each in pursuit of their own interests. Mr Holmes laid with his head pillowed on his partner’s belly and his long legs crossed, one foot braced on the armrest, reading a book regarding the various critters found in the seas and oceans while Dr Watson amused himself by reading The Lancet and caressing with a casual touch his husband’s now longer, soft greying hair.
As Mr Sherlock Holmes let the book fall on his chest still open and stretched, slightly lifting his body leaning on his shoulders and foot and moaning softly, Dr Watson chuckled, bringing his hand lower to caress his high cheekbone. “Has the great Sherlock Holmes tired of the creatures of the oceans?” He asked playfully.
Holmes moaned again, angling his head to look his partner in the eye. “Not yet. – He grinned. – Not until you will accompany me for a swim in mornings.”
Both men laughed as the doctor assured his detective to be very much of a dry land creature.
“Yet you are so pretty when you swim, so at ease…” Admired the detective, capturing his husband’s hand to press a kiss on its back.
“You old flatterer. – Admonished Watson playfully, kissing Holmes’ hand as well. – Food for thoughts?”
Holmes’ often severe features were brightened by an impish grin. “You perhaps mean ‘case for thoughts’, dear fellow. – He joked. – I’m thinking… of Oysters.” He smirked.
Watson huffed. “Really Holmes, not Oysters again, I beg of you.”
Tickled by his partner’s slight annoyance the detective smirked and continued, a playful smile on his thin lips. “But consider! Bivalves and monovalves aside, consider how pearls are made! If the seafloor were-”
Dr Watson snorted again, tugging slightly at his husband’s hair and interrupting him. “General rehearsal for your monograph on malingering?” He smiled, only half as much annoyed as he pretended to be.
“Ah, you got the true strength of my acting in that case! No, no, Watson, I’m considering how the layers of Mother of Pearl can cover basically anything!” Continued Holmes, enthusiastically.
Dr Watson smiled and rolled up his paper to playfully tap his husband head. “Are you going to claim merits as a housekeeper over getting oysters for dinner again, my love?” He smiled, a hand already trailing down his husband’s side.
Once he had arrived at the level of his waist, Holmes squeaked and jumped up to perch himself on the couch’s armrest. “Those are forbidden tactics!” He laughed.
The doctor grinned back. “Just as oysters are a banned topic!”
Holmes’ grin widened. “But imagine! A whole bed of oysters! Anything could get trapped by their valves! Too slow!” He grinned, jumping out of the couch and on Watson’s armchair to escape the playful swat with the rolled up paper!
“Come down here you eel!” Laughed the doctor.
“Anything! Maybe so many oysters could cover a the whole floor in mother of pearl! Slow, John, slow!” Grinned the detective after jumping from the armchair back to the couch and from that to his own armchair.
Watson grinned again. “I’m not putting any effort in this, dear husband! – He warned, then gasped as he saw his man climbing on the armchair’s backrest and perching himself there. – You’re a damn squirrel!”
“From fish to mammal, interesting transition! – He laughed. – Imagine, a fish mistakenly entering an oyste-”
As Holmes talked, his balance faltered and he fell back on the floor, right into his husband’s arms.
“Yes, my dear cat? A fish swimming into an oyster?” Breathed the doctor right into his ear, a laugh in his voice.
“He would get trapped, my love. Trapped in Mother of Pearl, fated to die and be embedded in that beautiful substance.”
Dr Watson laughed, squeezing his Holmes tight. “And this, my dear fish, is what happens to fishes who think themselves oh so clever.” He murmured, his mouth moving on what was visible of his husband’s neck to leave small kisses, his hands finding the hem of his wool vest and slipping inside it, working to tease his shirt out of his trousers.
“And what would that be, my delicious bear?” Grinned the detective, basking in his husband’s kisses and melting in his strong hold.
Watson smiled against his Holmes’ neck and put there yet another kiss, careful not to leave any mark, and then as his hands finally managed to slip under his shirt. “The punishment for talking of oysters, my sleuth hound.” He grinned planting his fingers in the most ticklish spot of his husband’s slim sides.
Holmes squeaked, curling on himself in the useless attempt to escape Watson’s vice-like hold. “Joooohn! John please!” He yelped between laughter.
The doctor laughed together with him, holding him up in position, almost lifting him from the ground. “Oh my dear, dear Sherlock. – He grinned, flexing his fingers and delighting in his husband’s yowls of laughter. – You knew of the consequences, my love!”
