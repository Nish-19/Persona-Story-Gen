#### Writing Prompt ####
You’re driving home at dawn after a sleepless night with old friends, the quiet hum of the road and the soft blue sunrise stirring memories of someone beside you who feels both distant and achingly familiar. What do you say, or leave unsaid?


#### Story ####
You have always seemed important to me. Always the tall one, the quiet tall one. The thoughtful tall one. Eyes honest and blue, sometimes overwhelming like the stormy Pacific; hair disheveled, honey-gold, like the light that comes just before sunset; freckles spattered across face and shoulders like stars that have been carefully counted and then forgotten, left to their own rambunctious devices to build constellations. These were not the things I first noticed about you.
Rather, I took notice of the way you talked. An almost Southern accent that you reined in just before a remnant of Georgia or Alabama slid off the tongue; the way you never seemed to feel the need to fill the empty space with meaningless conversation; the way you sometimes leaned forward onto countertops, propping your chin on the heel of your hand, level with whoever had provoked your slight side smile.
I took notice of how it felt to be near you, of the way that you drove, the music you played in your car, how you took your coffee. I noticed the books that you read, the stories with which you chose to fill your mind. You made me remember the smell of damp moss and Robin Hood. The little lost prince, and sunlit trees.
I liked remembering these things. Somehow I felt like I’d known you before. I still feel like I’ve known you before—somewhere in the distant past, fifty years or eons ago. Your soul feels old and familiar like a book that opens to my favorite pages.
Once I drove your car home after an entire night spent in the dark—a group of us trudging along to the top of a mountain at what must have been a vertical incline. We made it, although the only view awaiting us at the peak was that of the stars in the night sky, which we could have seen just as well at sea level. We laughed at how ridiculous we had been and ate dark chocolate dipped in peanut butter and shielded our faces from the wind.
We hadn’t slept, the handful of us. I was the most awake, so I drove us all home. It was 5:00 a.m. and the sun had just started stirring, verging on getting up and starting the day, on waking the world with a quiet peek over the mountains. We were fifty miles away from home and we were in your car. You sat shotgun, the other two asleep in the back seat.
I remember the stillness, the quietness, the blueness, the haziness. The whole world seemed groggy eyed, gentle; maybe asking for five more minutes of darkness. I remember feeling you beside me and how normal it seemed; I’d learned your rhythms long ago and found them easy. Beside you, I felt like I was home again after spending too long abroad. I had a feeling of déjà vu, like you were an old soul from eons ago who had returned to me once before in a similar way. I could have cried because you were so close to me.
The asphalt stretched out before us, swallowed up by the mountains in the distance. I made slow sweeping turns and gentle stops, watching heads lulling in the rearview mirror, and sometimes I stole glances over at you.
“How are you?” I wanted to know, and something about the dewy world around us made me feel like we could start fresh with honest and sincere questions. How are you, since we haven’t really spoken in over a year, since you used to be relevant to my life and I to yours, since I still miss you. And what I really want to know is if you ever think about that time when we at least pretended to be close to one another, and whether you were faking it, and whether I was faking it. And what I want to know even more is if you think you will ever allow me to know you again, and whether you will ever want to know me again.
“I’m good.” You almost said more but stopped yourself.
You looked over at me, and I smiled because I recognized something in your eyes. You had grown older and taller, your shoulders broader, your hair longer, but your eyes were the same. And then I played a song that I knew you’d recognize. Maybe it was a bit unfair—you hadn’t asked for a trip down memory lane—but I was prompted by the blue sunrise and all the things I wanted to say but couldn’t.
“I like when you can see the layers of mountains—I can count seven,” you said.
I turned the music down, gripped the steering wheel a bit tighter, and responded, “I count nine—wait no, maybe just seven. I’m not sure, really; I’ve never tried counting them before. I like how some of them are almost transparent, like smoke.”
“Me too—I like the colors.”
I waited for you to elaborate, to say something vaguely poetic, introspective, important, anything.
“Can you believe he has to work today?” you asked, gesturing with your eyes to one of the heads dozed off in the backseat. Just like that, our moment passed. The next song came on.
We drove the rest of the way home in relatively comfortable silence. I wondered if the blue sunrise was just a product of global warming.
As I rolled into my driveway, rocks crunched beneath the tires, usually a welcome sound, but now it made me ache. I sat back and took a deep breath. Then I collected my things and opened the door.
“Drive safe,” I said, stepping out of the car. I avoided your eyes as I swung the door shut. “Let me know you make it home safely.”
“Will do.”
I watched as you slid over to the driver’s seat and adjusted the mirrors and radio. As you slowly swung out of the driveway, the sunglasses hanging from your rearview mirror swayed in time to the song stuck in my head, and sunshine glinted off the silver of your wheels. I stood there, my hand held in a half wave, then turned toward the back door of the big blue house.
