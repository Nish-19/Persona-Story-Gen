After the loss of her daughter, Virginia Rothery struggles to reconcile her grief with her faith, surrounded by a congregation offering comfort she’s not sure she can accept. What happens when belief collides with unbearable loss?


#### Story ####
Raised a Jehovah’s Witness, Virginia Rothery has never had a birthday cake. Today, in memoriam of her daughter, her congregation arrives with Lord and Lady Baltimores, with red velvets, black forests, and hummingbirds.
Today the Rotherys’ ranch house is so crowded that Roger opens every window, despite Virginia’s head cold. There is some debate, anyway, about whether her nose is streaming from illness or from grief.
Leslie Jean Rothery, born two weeks early, had a habit of what Roger called roughhousing. She was anemically pale. Her blond hair was thin and tentative, an afterthought of her body. At school she was called L.J. At school she was mocked for her religious principles—she could not attend the Christmas play, she could not drop eggs in blue dye each spring—but she was admired for her athleticism, which brimmed frustratingly throughout math and science, which burst beautifully in sprints and double Dutch. Roger made her learn to sew when she was nine, the last year of her life, because she tore almost all the clothing she owned. Roughhousing.
Perhaps this is how Roger remembers Leslie: foxglove blooms of blood on her elbows and knees, face contorting at the sight of fruit salad, howling when her spider costume was dismembered on the night of Halloween. Leslie had received the costume from a school friend. Clipping the acrylic legs with shears, Roger had said, “Don’t you understand that Halloween is a pagan practice?”
No, Leslie did not understand.
As for Virginia, the only image she can recall is that of her daughter asleep and unsuspecting in the backseat of the car, a car soon to receive a heavy steel blow from a purple pickup with Idaho plates, map on the dash, its driver lost—again—this time in Lake of the Meek, Montana. A single woman still getting used to a shift stick, bleary with beer and divorce, driving straight into the intersection of Thoroughfare and Locust Road.
That wasn’t the end. The ambulance, the kind paramedics, calling Leslie sweetheart, asking her questions, all of which she answered: Leslie Jean Rothery. No, my head doesn’t hurt. Yes, I can lift this arm. I live at 37 Thistle Bend. Then she was out. That wasn’t the end, either.
A macaroon appears with such proximity to Virginia’s mouth that she eats it, even though she hates coconut. All the shoes in her house glisten with cemetery mud. She cries for several minutes before Carol Truitt, one of the sisters from the congregation, comes over with a wad of tissues. The tissues must have come from Carol’s purse, because Virginia doesn’t buy the scented pastel kind. She buys discount brands, in bulk. It is expensive to raise even one child.
When she spills sherry down the front of her dress, Virginia knows what to do: she goes to the bathroom, which is cleaner than it has ever been. The faucets sparkle in the cold sunshine. Someone washed this faucet; someone buffed the water taps. Virginia weeps in gratitude for a minute before she begins to unhook the shower curtain, thinking, Isn’t this what I came in here for? On the sink, Leslie’s toothbrush is upside down in the holder. Virginia brings it to her lips. She brings it with her down the hall, into her bedroom, and into her bed. She waves it angrily when Carol Truitt comes in and tries to pull back the quilt.
“How about a walk outside?” Carol says. “Some fresh air?”
Virginia turns her head to look out the window, maple branches against the sky like cracks in a glazed plate.
“Just a quick walk down to the lake?”
“No.”
Carol lies down on the bed. She puts her arm around Virginia’s waist, bringing her frosted hair to the pillow, grains of nut from a cookie between her teeth.
Virginia surprises herself: she wants this warmth. She wants skin and breath. She allows her back to be scratched, her hair to be smoothed. She decides to be Leslie instead of herself. No one will notice.
“Virginia?”
“I said no. I’m not going outside.”
“I know.” Then Carol says, “The hardest part must be what that doctor told you.”
Virginia opens her eyes, reentering the childless world, the sheets with their smell of husband, the ranch house built for four, holding fifty, soon to be holding two. The hardest part must be what the doctor told you. Of course Carol knows. The whole congregation knows that Dr. Hagan said he could help Leslie easily with a blood transfusion. With only a moment’s hesitation, Roger said no, handing Dr. Hagan tracts and brochures about Jehovah’s Witnesses and their stance on blood. To Jehovah, blood is as loathsome as war, as untruths, as plastic spider limbs. Roger told Virginia that to allow Leslie a blood transfusion would destroy their chance for a life in paradise. He told her this in the hospital gift shop, toying with a sequined sock that Virginia recognized as a Christmas ornament. If Roger had looked at the thing in his hand he would have dropped it, and he would have washed his hands to rid them of sinful traces.
“Just thank God you had her,” Carol says now. “Thank God you had her at all.”
Yes: thank God. Thank God you have a whole congregation in your dim ranch house with a useless, empty bedroom, where you will later find Leslie’s hidden drawings of unicorns, which Roger disallows because they are supernormal creatures and suggest a way of thinking that supersedes Witness doctrine. Thank God you know that you will see Leslie again, you will, when she is resurrected after Armageddon, when the world returns to its original, perfect state.
