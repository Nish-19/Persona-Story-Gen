#### Story ####
# Chaotic Good It was just about, but not quite, evening as a man and a woman sat at the window counter of a Starbucks. [**The man**]( tall, with a big chin, and floppy hair covering barely visible eyebrows, was gingerly sipping from his steaming cup as the blonde, foxy-eyed, woman glanced over at him, cupping her own. "It doesn't even *taste* like pumpkin", he said to her while studying his cup with greater intensity than necessary, "And where's the spice? I swear...you *humans* and your 'fads'..." He rolled his eyes, taking another sip, and soon felt a pointed glance directed at the bow-tie around his neck. The Doctor looked at the bow-tie then over at Claudia, exclaiming, "What? Bow-ties are *cool*. Pumpkin spice lattes are *not*." Right on queue, just as they finished the rest of their lattes, The Doctor gave a slight jump as his breast pocket began vibrating with a pulsating green color. He took out the [**sonic screwdriver**]( which was indeed buzzing and flashing with a green light at the top. Studying it for no more than a few seconds, he shut it's green top and bolted out of his seat. "They've awoken! I'm picking up their trail, come on!", was the last Claudia heard of the Doctor before she scrambled after him out of the Starbucks and down the street. They ran down the London streets, weaving in between people and nearly getting run over by traffic. The Doctor, his sonic screwdriver out and guiding his way, was barely even paying attention to his surroundings. So much so, that Claudia had to yank him back several times to keep him from running out into the street or down an open manhole cover. Finally, however, they came to a stop in front of a very nondescript apartment in a row of such other nondescript apartments. "Here it is! They're in there! The screwdriver is going *mad*. I just hope we're not too late...", he said, motioning to this one particular door. Claudia raised a fist, prepared to give it a knock, when she heard the familiar green-lit buzzing coming from her left. On the other side of the door, in the quite tastefully furnished apartment, sat four young guys huddled around a table. On the table lay a very detailed map of what looked like a castle surrounded by weaving labyrinths of forests, swamps, and mountains. And on top of the map sat four plastic figurines of fantasy characters brandishing weapons, along with a couple plastic figures of a troll as well as a dragon further away near the castle. Handfuls of dice and charts of paper lay distributed among the boys as they seemed to be in a heated discussion about what to do with a distraught maiden they found near an overturned cart full of goods. Just as one of them turned to consult an open manual behind him, their apartment door slammed open and The Doctor stumbled into their room, followed a bit more hesitantly by Claudia. "**Stop** right there, put down those die!", the Doctor exclaimed poining an accusing finger at the table, "Nobody touch *anything* on that table!"
