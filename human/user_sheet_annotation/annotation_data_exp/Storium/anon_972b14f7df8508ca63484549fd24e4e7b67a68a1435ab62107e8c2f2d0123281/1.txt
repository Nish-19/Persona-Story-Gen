#### Story ####
#Chapter 1: ##Customer Satisfaction Or 0 Days Without Sexual Harassment ###*(as narrated by Samuel L. Jackson)* There is nothing worse on Gods green Earth than a cold-ass Monday morning in the city. Everyone rushing to work or from night shifts or to school, everyone wanting to get the day started so it can already be over. Everyone being a *bitch* and a *cunt* to one another to get the last seat on the subway or be the first in line...and *no one* wanting to deal with those fuckers they have to be constantly surrounded by; the *other people*. But the thing about Mondays, is that even the smallest of things can make those horrible, terrible days of the week feel *just* a little better. And thats free fucking coffee. And not just *any* free fucking coffee from a mass-produced, ass-tasting barrel! No sir! Free *custom* made coffee with a fresh from the oven muffin in a warm and toasty coffee shop that lookswell, almost like Starbucks underachieving, slightly retarded brother that everyone praises for tying his shoes in the morning. I admit, its not the best coffee shop in the world, but ya gotta give 'em credit for trying. *Coffee Nutz*, originally the brain child of an NYU hipster who needed something more in life than a twenty-thousand-dollar piece of laminated paper, has grown quite a bit in its three whole years of existence. They have a total of three locations in the city; Uptown, Midtown, and Downtown, and have already partnered up with as many start-up businesses as you can think of. Uber, Yelp, Foursquareyou name it and you can *bet* someone was fucked on some couch in an office for it. However, since business wasnt exactly a boomin the owner decided to do a little Monday morning experiment to drum up some attention. **For today only**, all three of his locations would offer their products for free. And the Midtown location, just five blocks south of Central Park, is where *this* particular story is set. --- Now lets meet some of the players, shall we? First and foremost, the direct contact to the boss and the barista whos been there from day one; Chester. Chesters a curious sort. He was the first one to apply to a teeny coffee shop on the second floor of an equally as teeny adult book store, and even as that teeny coffee shop grew and grew and eventually expanded *into* the teeny adult book store, taking up both floors of the building, Chester has stayed the barista and sort of a team lead, for all of those three years. Never asking for a raise, or better hours, or seeking a promotion. For some inexplicable reason he just seemed to really love his job. It was still too early for Coffee Nutz to have many coffee-loving customers around, but it was a good sign already that people were lining up past the bakery counter. Chester was smiling -grinning- at a woman across from him dressed in a sleek business suit with a tightly pulled back bun on her head, chatting without breath into the outdated Bluetooth on her ear. Hi! Welcome to Coffee Nutz, where were all just *nuts* about coffee! Eheh... Today all the coffee is free, so what would you like to order? The woman, seeming to stare straight at Chester and yet managing to ignore him completely, said to no one in particular, Uh-huh yeah. Papers on my desk by lunchtime. Noby *brunch* time, got that? Write that down, write down brunch time. What? Ohum, medium half-caf latte, skim milk, *no* sugar, please. You said its free...? Chester gave a nod, the smile never leaving his face, as he picked up a cup to write down the order on it, Well technically the only price is a hug but we dont charge any tax for hugs Hold on, Susan, the woman suddenly interrupted both Chester and Susan on the other line, Theres some coffee clerk in here sexually harassing me, quick call to my lawyer, Im gonna have to call you back. --Now, what did you say your name was, sir? Chester stopped writing, marker and cup hovering in the air, and looked over at her slightly paled. He glanced left and right before slowly starting to answer, Ah.my.*my* name, huh? My name is uh.M..Martin. Martin Shshort. Martin Short? Your name tag says Chester. What is your last name Chester?, the woman continued calmly as if this was a daily occurrence for her. Chester took a breath, turning it into a small laugh as he passed the empty cup to Willow, the only other barista behind the counter, Ahthank you for your order! Please step down to the pick-up counter and well get that right out for ya As Chester desperately busied himself with the next customer, the woman stepped over, leaning over the counter to watch Willow work on her coffee with judgmental intensity. As if studying the girls every move, finger hovering over her phone, ready to sue anyone for the littlest thing. Um, can Iplease get a different cup? I think that coffee clerk might have *dirtied* that one. *Thank you*!, the business woman chimed at Willow before taking another call on her Bluetooth again. --- Meanwhile, the business bitch wasnt the only rude customer on a phone in that coffee shop. A little further down the line of people, stood a big man in an equally as expensive suit with rings peppering his fingers and a chain around his neck. He held a phone up to his ear as he stood, from time to time checking out his big expensive watch. Well you can tell *Wallace* -verbatim- tell him I said this, tell him Im saying this *exactly*. I will *break* both his big toes and make him run, barefoot, to that Seven Eleven six blocks away to get me a twix bar. *Twix bar*, not a fucking Snickers, not those caramel peanut butter *horse cocks*, a goddamn *Twix* bar that he will pay for *out of pocket* and then run back to me *on* his broken toes. And when he gets back here with my Twix bar, tell him I will break three fingers on each of his hands and make him type up my daughters school report due tomorrow. And it better be fucking *perfect*, he better have read goddamn To Kill a Mockingbird. Because if I dont see any clear cut similarities between fucking Boo Radley and Finch in there, *then* I will shoot him in the head. Got that? You got all that? If he doesnt have the money by the time I get back, that will happen. Tell him that will happen, alright?, he hung up the phone and shook his head, speaking to whoever was in line behind him, "Assholes, huh? No respect for ya. No ones got any respect anymore. Fuck... And as the sun was still barely peeking through the skyscrapers during this early morning and as two hapless baristas tried to serve the slowly growing number of people, more and more of our storys main characters started flooding into the coffee shop.
