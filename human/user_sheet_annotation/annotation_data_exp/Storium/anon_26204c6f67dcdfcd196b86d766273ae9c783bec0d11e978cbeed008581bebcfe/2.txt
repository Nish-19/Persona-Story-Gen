When a mysterious amusement park company begins buying up land in your quiet town, you’re sent to a private luncheon to hear their plans—but something about their rapid expansion and secretive dealings feels far from entertaining.

#Act I: Earth and Water The GPS said the approximate arrival time would be 11:02 AM. Not bad, Alcippe thought, and remembered to relax her iron grip on the steering wheel. She liked being punctual. In her mind, punctuality meant showing up at least half an hour early and getting a feel for the environment and the situation before the Powers That Be appeared with their plastic smiles and slick presentations. Better to lay down the foundations of understanding herself before someone tried to shove their own biased version down her throat. "Oh my God," the chipper voice in the passenger seat said, and Alcippe's fingers clamped down around the steering wheel reflexively. She had to consciously will her fingers to loosen again. The voice belonged to Cynthia Brower. Twenty-eight years old and armed with a seemingly endless wardrobe of cute yet professional work attire, Cynthia was the cheery bane of Sophono's Department of Transportation. She carried herself like the more naive interns, full of incessant cheer and helpfulness. To be fair, though, she knew how to do her job and she always came prepared. That's why Alcippe hadn't objected too strongly when Cynthia was selected to accompany her on this little venture. *On a Saturday,* her mind couldn't help but add with a touch of bitterness. Brimo Amusements, the company was called. They'd steadily bought up the land around Sophono through a series of real estate deals, some above-board, some a bit... 'mysterious,' for the past two years. Now, they had reached out to Sophono's stakeholders with an invitation to a private luncheon, where they apparently planned to divulge their proposals for land development. They'd rented conference space at the Hyatt. Alcippe wasn't sure what she should expect: a cramped, tiny boardroom full of sweaty middle-aged men in business suits? A lavish affair in the ballroom, complete with fondue fountains and ice sculptures? The ride to the Hyatt wasn't long, but Cynthia had taken the opportunity to regale Alcippe with all of the notes she'd taken on Brimo Amusements' properties and history. The eager young woman had flooded the car with a prattling series of facts and figures that never seemed to end. Cynthia was talking again. "This Alexander Brimo guy, he owns *seven* other properties across the tri-state area. There's a-- hm, hold on. No, I don't want to buy your whiskey. *Gawd*, why do they always show you alcohol ads in everything? Do I *look* like an alchie? Hello. ...okay, right, seven properties, looks like we've got... a branch of American Amusements, a go-kart place, a... mini-golf place? Or a water park? Or water-mini-golf? I don't even know what this is-- wow. And he wants to bring this new park to *our* neighborhood. He must be a busy man." Cynthia laughed. No-- no, that wasn't the right word. She *tittered* like a small bird. "Gosh. Isn't this exciting? Maybe this place will put Sophono on the map! I mean, the extra traffic from all the tourism might put some strain on our infrastructure, the hospitality industry, things like that, but. The economy. Imagine how much money could come pouring in, huh?" Alcippe didn't need to look at the younger woman; she could hear the grin in Cynthia's voice. They still had some time before they arrived. Maybe it was worth talking shop, laying out the facts so they could present a common front at the meeting. Or maybe, she should just push Cynthia out into the road and speed off down the Thruway. At least she'd be able to enjoy a little silence on her Saturday morning before schmoozing time.
