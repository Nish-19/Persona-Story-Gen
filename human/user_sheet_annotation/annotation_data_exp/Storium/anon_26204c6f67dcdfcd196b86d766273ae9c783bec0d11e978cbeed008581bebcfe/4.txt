Summoned to the Master's council room after supper, a group of Templar knights—each harboring their own secrets—find themselves gathered before three locked chests and a blazing fire. What mission, judgment, or revelation awaits them in the flickering light of the Master's arrival?


#### Story ####
Brother Tancred cleared his throat. Long moments had passed since either of the two men in the room had broken the silence. Hearing it broken, Master Galien, preceptor of Fort Latronis, raised his head as if carrying a great weight. "Speak your mind, brother." The long years of the Master's service manifested in his voice, a thing dried and hardened by this country-- its merciless sun, its turmoil a test of both body and soul. The commandery chaplain took a step forward. "Master-- I would counsel against the abandonment of our great task. With honor and fitting dedication, you have sought this thing for over twenty years of your life. Would you abandon the Lord's work now, in what is possibly the hour of its completion?" "The Lord understands the value of men, brother. And we have too few." "Spare a few more, to finish the work at last. A handful, well-armed but swift, to seek what they can and return within the week. If not to find the weapon, then to investigate the manner of our brothers' deaths. Surely we will not leave our brothers of the Temple unmarked and unmourned." The Master stared into the fire that illuminated the barren stone walls of the council room. When he spoke again, there was a quiet in his voice that no other man in the fortress had been allowed to hear. "How many more Christian souls will go to the gates of heaven at my behest? How many names of Temple brothers will Saint Peter record in his book-- before our work is finished?" "Salvation through sacrifice-- it has ever been the way of the Lord," the priest answered. "The blood of the few will preserve the blood of the many, just as the blood of the Son saved his flock. It is the Lord's work that we do, and have the courage to do. And difficult as the path may be, at the end of it lies the redemption of the Kingdom of Jerusalem." The rhythm of the conversation was familiar to both men. It was the master's role to doubt, and the priest's duty to reassure. "Thanks be to God." Master Galien turned and met the priest's eyes. "I will send my summons. After supper. Best if they leave tonight." The priest nodded. "By your will." "By His," Master Galien said. There was a pause, and then the door closed behind him. --- One by one, Master Galien's servant, Bertrand, found them all: some tending to their horses, some after they left the divine offices of Nones or, later, Vespers. By suppertime, each of the chosen knights had received Master Galien's summons. They were to proceed to the Master's council room immediately after supper, for reasons that Bertrand did not explain, or appear to know. Some of them were not terribly bothered. Three pilgrims currently occupied the lodgings set aside for that purpose; likely they had concluded their penances and required an escort back to the main road. Some of them harbored darker suspicions, though. Secrets did not sit easily in the communal life of the Templars, and some among them harbored secrets they did not care to divulge. Could it be that they had been found out? The Gospel reading at supper, delivered as always by Brother Tancred, was recognizable to the educated among them as the temptation of Jesus in the desert and the calling of the Apostle Peter. Those who had not learned Latin still recognized the oft-cited words: *Poenitentiam agite: appropinquavit enim regnum caelorum.* Do penance: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. At supper's end, they made their way to the Master's council room, down a windowless corridor that led mostly to storage vaults. The door had been left open, revealing sparse furnishings: a long, plain table with wooden benches-- a fireplace in which someone had prepared a steady blaze prior to their arrival-- a stone relief of the Order's emblem, two knights riding a single horse, adorning the wall-- and three chests set against the far wall. Each chest bore the privileged device to which none of them were entitled: a lock. None of "them"? It appeared that the summons given to each man had gone to others as well. Who was the Master gathering here-- allies, accusers? To what purpose? And how were they to conduct themselves as they awaited his arrival?
