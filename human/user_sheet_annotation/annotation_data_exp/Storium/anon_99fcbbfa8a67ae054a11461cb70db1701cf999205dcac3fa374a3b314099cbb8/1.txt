#### Story ####
chapter 1: near arrival. John Harmen, a magnate in the steel industry, was dead at the old age of 72. He had made a great deal of money over his life from a relatively obscure background. He had never been truly poor, but he had only in his later life been one of the silver spoon crowd. It was 1934, but despite the economic disaster that had ravaged the country, he had been wise and had remained one of the few that had been unhurt on Black Tuesday, October 29. He wanted a final gathering from those who had hovered around his money for so long, so he had stipulated in his will that they stay a couple of days at his old mansion before they got their rewards for their fidelity, kindness, or received what was due to them from family obligation. Among the mourners and hopeful benificiaries was Bella Welmer, a young wavy-haired blonde almost young enough to have been Harmen'sgranddaughter. She had been his fianc and now stood to get a lot. She had once been what the Romans would have called a legacy hunter, and what people in these days would call a gold-digger. But those who knew her knew that had changed. Though she had just been a greedy teenager looking for an easy way to sit in the lap of luxury, she had come to truly love John Harmen. She openly admitted to her mercenary wishes before, and was the first to criticize herself for them, and meant every word, but she was still here. Another was Lizzy Harkness, a dark-haired woman who was the daughter of one of Harmen's old fishing buddies. Quieter and softer than Bella but decidedly melancholic, it was hard to tell which of them was more beautiful or more likeable. Her father was good friends with Harmen and had died a few weeks before. She wasn't after the money and was here by strict respect. She was a working woman who mourned her father's loss far more than she cared for what she might get. There was also her brother Charlie and Mr. Preston, a teacher Harmen had hired in secret to give Lizzy an educational leg up where her schooling was incomplete. He very clearly had other things on his mind when he looked at the dark girl, but he taught the girl with great skill, even though watching them brought one to wonder who was the more intelligent of the two as Lizzy was unmistakably clever while Preston was what one would call a "know-nothing know-it-all" who lacked any real sense and had a lot less learning than he claimed he did. There was also Mr. Jacob Goldduster, a man who was one of the least corruptible people Harmen had ever known and a guy who had always been dependable to do what he could for those less fortunate. He didn't want the money really, but he respected Harmen's wishes. There was also Mr. Peter Venus, a man who seemed very worldly and wise, and who was very handsome. He was a man who really liked the house and was constantly peering into corners, though he never quite said what he was looking for. Learned and suave, the man was beloved by the old Man and a good friend of Goldduster. Also, last and certainly least was Mr. Smiddy. Smiddy was a man badly injured in the first world war, moving about on a peg leg and ranting at all he saw. Unlike Bella, he was an unashamed golddiggger and was quick to claim he wanted the money whenever an opportunity showed itself. He constantly carried a copy of "The decline and fall of the Roman Empire" which he read from noisily and obnoxiously, much to the shegrin of all present. All would be glad when this guy got his share and left. All of these were here when the others arrived. Others that inspired fear, as the thoughts watched and waited, wanting out, though it was not yet time. These new ones were more powerful and wise than any before, and though the thinkers did not know why they feared, what they had done for centuries untold might be being brought to an end.
