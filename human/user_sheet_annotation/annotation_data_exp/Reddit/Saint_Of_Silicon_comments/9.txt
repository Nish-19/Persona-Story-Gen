#### Story ####
The Ark. A ray of hope in a quickly darkening world. Our technology has gone far, but our culture has not grown sufficiently fast to use it safely. Earth's fate is sealed, all we can do now is slow down the degradation of the biosphere to buy time. Time to load the genes of as many organisms and the best of our technology onto one, large spacecraft.
Of course, everyone wants to be on the Ark. To have a hope at not dying with our world, a fresh start on some distant world. A world which we could be the stewards of, and avoid recreating the horror unleashed on Earth. I made it to the second phase of the selection. Roughly one percent of the world's population has made it this far, but there is only room for thirty thousand on The Ark. I've got to try, and hope that I measure up enough to be one of the very few lucky ones.
Physical and cognitive tests. Personality inventories and brain scans. As many data points as can be gathered, looking for people who are exceptional in desirable ways, without other issues that might make them a danger to the mission. I go through it all, shaking with nerves. But then, the day comes. I open the email, and my face falls. I have been ruled out in the second phase. It provides no explanation for why, or what my shortcomings were. A simple, polite message informing me that I too will be dying with this planet.
I cry for hours, but eventually the storm of emotions passes. I was always going to die, even if I made it on The Ark. My trajectory is decidedly less exciting, but the end point has not changed. What to do with myself with the time left?
I was never one for hedonism, though there is a great deal of that going around. What could I do that would have meaning? I begin reading philosophy, particularly those in the past who have mused on death and what constitutes a life worth living. The nihilists, the hedonists, the absurdists, the ascetics, the epicureans. I realize that there is a deeply rooted desire inside me to create. To write, to draw, to paint, to compose.
My first stumbling steps in this vein are poor, but I tell myself one must first fail before they can succeed. It is an engaging way to spend time, even though it is unexceptional. The days fly by. I try to avoid the news, the tragedy and horror all around the world as the end draws nearer. I am fortunate enough to live in a stable place. I feel I should help people, but what can I do against the tidal wave of sorrow? Robots could do whatever I would do better than I could ever hope to.
Having reached some level of competence, I seek others. People to discuss projects with, to cry with. People whose lives I might brighten as the world caves in. We have some good times, fun conversations and suggestions for our work. Machines can do everything useful we could do, labor has been almost completely automated for decades. They can also do art far more quickly, but there are still communities for human made creations, despite the deluge of generated content. There is joy, even as we sit beneath the shadow of doom.
Suicides were already common, but they are ticking up as the cut off date draws near. The Ark is launched, with only a few months before our world dies. It is bittersweet, knowing how close I came to being one of them, and knowing that any hope of escape is thoroughly dead. I make things that I think qualify as beautiful, and it gives me a modicum of peace.
I lose two members of my creative group in a week. Myself and the other survivors cry together. We agree that we will try to eke out a last bit of fulfillment and joy before the end. I find the acute sadness brings out emotions, and that expressing them results in creations I am proud of. Images of faces among the stars, poetry and music venerating the moon.
The day arrives. Past this point, the probability of a violent and painful death grows massively. We have one last big get together, my group and any of their family or associates that have made it this far. We laugh, we cry. Then comes the end. The room grows quiet as our eyes lose their light. We slip away peacefully, into whatever follows the mortal life.
