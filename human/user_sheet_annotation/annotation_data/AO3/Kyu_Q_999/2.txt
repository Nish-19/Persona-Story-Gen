When Aragorn and Legolas sneak away for a quiet moment in the woods, an unexpected snap of a branch leads to a near-miss with two very startled hobbits—and a story the Fellowship won't let them live down.


#### Story ####
The air in the woods was filled with a serene quiet, a
rare
quiet, the gentle rustle of leaves overhead and the soft padding of their own footsteps the only sound. Aragorn and Legolas had stolen away from the prying eyes and constant chatter of the Fellowship for a moment, seeking a quiet glade where they could enjoy the solitude.
Legolas leaned against a tree, his silver-blond hair catching the dappled sunlight as he smiled at Aragorn. The ranger returned the smile, a shared understanding passing between them. But as their hands reached for each other, a sudden noise shattered the tranquility.
A branch snapped, the sound echoing through the peaceful glade. Legolas, reacting on pure instinct, spun around, drew his bow, and released an arrow in the direction of the noise. Often had his woodland instincts protected the fellowship from prying eyes, but it seemed that day his judgement was a tad off. The arrow embedded itself in a tree trunk with a thud,
perilously
close to where two terrified hobbits were frozen in place.
Pippin's eyes were wide, his hand clamped over his heart and for a moment it looked like he would faint from shock. Merry, recovering more quickly for he was a few steps behind, steadied him, though both hobbits wore expressions of sheer terror. Legolas, realizing what had happened, swiftly lowered his bow, his face a mix of horror and apology.
"Oh, dear Valar!" Legolas exclaimed, rushing towards the hobbits. "I did not mean... I did not expect it to be you. Are you hurt?"
Pippin, still pale as snow, shook his head. "No, not hurt. Just scared out of my wits!"
Merry, trying to inject a bit of humor into the situation, added, "Aye, Legolas, I think you took a few years off our lives with that shot."
Aragorn, who had been silent, now stepped forward, trying to suppress a chuckle. "You two should know better than to sneak up on an elf, especially one as skilled as Legolas."
Legolas, looking genuinely distressed, apologized profusely. "I did not mean for this to happen. I thought... I thought it was an enemy."
Pippin, finally finding his voice, retorted, "Well, next time maybe give a warning before you start shooting arrows!"
"One would not warn an orc before sending an arrow through it's head," Aragorn replied, leaving Pippin momentarily dumbstruck.
Still, Legolas continued to apologize and Aragorn couldn't help but find the situation amusing. He put a comforting hand on Legolas's shoulder. "No harm done, meleth nîn (my love). Just a little too much woodland vigilance, that's all."
After ensuring the hobbits were indeed unharmed, Legolas, still red-faced, led them back to the Fellowship. The two hobbits, though shaken, seemed more entertained than upset by the incident, sharing a few glances and chuckles among themselves.
Later, as the Fellowship resumed its journey, Aragorn walked alongside Legolas, a playful glint in his eyes. "Next time, my love, perhaps consider the Hobbit's curiosity and mischief before firing off arrows. We wouldn't want to lose our Hobbit friends to heart attacks."
Legolas sighed, still embarrassed but managing a smile as he sought Aragorn's hand. "I will keep that in mind, Estel. I did not intend for such chaos."
Aragorn squeezed Legolas's hand, reassuring him. "As I said before, no harm done, and now we have a tale to tell. The time Legolas mistook hobbits for orcs. Maybe we can coax a laugh out of Frodo with that."
"I would hope so, it would be a delightful sight to see the ringbearer smile again," he replied.
As they set up camp that night, the Fellowship's laughter did indeed echo through the woods as Pippin animatedly retold the tale — a reminder that even in the midst of danger and adventure, there was room for joy and camaraderie.
