An elf craftsman sees only light and purity in the being he loves, unaware of the darkness hidden beneath. What happens when devotion meets deception, and the lines between truth and illusion begin to blur?


#### Story ####
Annatar stood motionless in the center of their chambers, his sharp eyes fixed on Celebrimbor as the elf moved with careful precision. The Lord of Eregion, ever the artisan, fussed over him with an artist’s devotion. His deft hands worked as though Annatar were the finest creation Celebrimbor had ever crafted.
The robe that Celebrimbor had chosen for him was white, the purest shade of ivory, embroidered with intricate gold thread that shimmered with every shift of light. The golden patterns traced delicate paths along the sleeves, cuffs, and collar - patterns that Celebrimbor had designed specifically for him. It felt like being cloaked in sunlight, radiant and resplendent. The stark contrast of white and gold against his skin was deliberate, no doubt. Celebrimbor’s vision of him, made manifest.
Celebrimbor knelt in front of him, adjusting the robe, pulling the fabric tight before stepping back to admire his work.
“Beautiful,” he murmured as he took Annatar’s hand, slowly sliding a golden ring onto his finger - one he had forged himself, as always. Annatar’s gaze shifted downward, watching those gentle, reverent hands as they moved to adorn him with the finest of Celebrimbor’s jewellery.
More golden rings, each delicate yet powerful, slipped onto his fingers, their metal cool at first, then warming against his skin. Bracelets followed, the slight clink of metal-on-metal filling the room as they rested perfectly around his wrists.
Celebrimbor’s fingers grazed his skin as he adjusted each piece of jewellery with meticulous care, tracing the lines of his palm, before he lifted his hands to his lips. A soft kiss, reverent - his face alight with the quiet satisfaction of a craftsman. He wasn’t just dressing Annatar. No, to him, this was something more profound - an act of adoration. “So beautiful, so pure,” Celebrimbor murmured, almost absentmindedly as if it were a fact, not an observation.
Annatar almost flinched, but he schooled his features into a soft smile instead, letting Celebrimbor’s words wash over him.
Pure.
Celebrimbor said it with such certainty, with such love, that Annatar felt a painful pang in his chest.
Celebrimbor’s eyes, those eyes full of love and admiration, gazed upon him as though he were some sacred being. A being of light and goodness.
He wanted to believe it. He wanted to believe for just a moment that he
was
the being Celebrimbor saw - a radiant Maia of golden light, of beauty, of creation. But beneath the layers of fabric and gentle touches lay the truth that neither of them could escape. Mairon was long gone, twisted into something darker, something more ruthless. Annatar, this beautiful façade, was nothing more than a vessel for his plans.
But Celebrimbor - Celebrimbor saw none of that. His grey eyes were soft with affection as he lifted another piece of jewellery, a golden bracelet, and fastened it around Annatar’s wrist. His hands were steady, as though every movement was part of some sacred ritual. It almost felt like worship, the way Celebrimbor handled him. As if Annatar were something holy, something worthy of reverence.
And Annatar, in his weakness, found himself craving more of it.
“Tyelpe,” he said softly, his voice steady yet touched by something unspoken. “You flatter me too much.”
“Not enough, I think,” Celebrimbor replied with a small smile, stepping behind him now, his fingers combing carefully through Annatar’s golden hair, untangling each strand. It was a tenderness that caught Annatar off guard, even now. He felt the reverence in every movement, the soft hum of concentration that always accompanied Celebrimbor when he was working on something precious.
And Annatar - Sauron, Mairon, a dark lord hiding in plain sight -
felt
precious under those hands.
It was a ridiculous notion, of course. How could he, who had once sworn himself to Melkor, feel anything other than the heavy burden of his own betrayal, the weight of his corrupted power? But here, in Celebrimbor’s presence, in the Lord of Eregion’s deft, tender care, Annatar almost forgot.
Almost.
“Hold still,” Celebrimbor murmured, his voice soft with affection. He carefully smoothed the final strands of Annatar’s hair into place, his fingers lingering for just a moment longer than necessary, as if savoring the feeling of his golden locks on his fingers.
Annatar closed his eyes for a brief moment, allowing himself the luxury of leaning into Celebrimbor’s touch. For this one moment, he could be Mairon again, the Maia of Aulë, the one who crafted wonders of fire, metal and gemstone. In this moment, with Celebrimbor gently adorning him, he could believe he was still that being of light, untouched by shadow.
He opened his eyes again when he felt the cool weight of a circlet being placed upon his brow. Gold, of course, delicately wrought with Elven designs and set with a single, brilliant gem in the center. Celebrimbor adjusted it slightly, then stood back, his gaze appraising, his lips curving into a look of quiet satisfaction.
“There,” Celebrimbor said softly, stepping aside to let Annatar see his reflection in the tall mirror before them. “Perfect.”
Annatar turned his head slowly, eyes drawn to the figure in the glass. For a moment, he didn’t recognize the reflection. The being staring back at him was resplendent in light and purity, his golden hair catching the golden light of day, the whites and golds of his attire glowing like the sun itself. He looked every inch the Maia he had once been under Aulë’s guidance - bright, radiant, and untarnished by the darkness that had consumed him.
For the briefest of moments, he saw Mairon in the reflection - shining, unmarred, brilliant with the light of the Valar. The one who had not yet fallen. The Maia who had forged wonders, who had sung the songs of creation with fire in his veins. The fire of the forge burned in his eyes, the passion for creation and beauty that had once driven him.
And beside him stood Celebrimbor, his Lord, his artist - his other half.
But the moment passed, and the image before him felt like a cruel illusion. He was no longer Mairon, no longer the pure, shining Maia. His heart, twisted and blackened by his time under Melkor, would never again be as Celebrimbor saw it. The radiance in the mirror was a lie.
Yet, Celebrimbor looked at him as if he were still that Maia of fire and song.
“Do you like it?” He asked, his voice soft with affection, his hands resting gently on Annatar’s shoulders as he admired his work in the mirror.
Annatar swallowed hard, his throat tightening as he tore his gaze from his reflection in the mirror and looked instead at Celebrimbor's. The elf was smiling at him, that soft, affectionate smile that always made Annatar’s heart clench in ways he wished it wouldn’t.
He believes it, Annatar thought bitterly. Celebrimbor truly believed that Annatar was this being of purity and light. He had no idea of the darkness that lurked beneath the surface, the corruption that had twisted his soul beyond repair.
Annatar forced a smile, his heart heavy with the weight of the deception. “I do,” he replied quietly, his fingers brushing against the golden rings adorning his hands. “You’ve made me look wonderful… ethereal even,” He hesitated, searching for the right words. “You’ve made me look like the being I remember myself to be.”
Celebrimbor pressed a gentle kiss to the side of his neck, resting his chin on Annatar’s shoulder. “You are that being,” he whispered, his voice full of love and conviction. “You are more than you know, and more than you let yourself believe.”
Annatar closed his eyes, a knot tightening in his chest. He wanted to believe it. He wanted to believe that the darkness hadn’t fully consumed him, that light could still exist within him. But he knew the truth. He was plotting Eregion's downfall, after all.
He wasn’t Mairon anymore. And this - this happiness with Celebrimbor - was as fragile as the delicate circlet resting on his brow.
Annatar leaned into Celebrimbor’s touch, the warmth of the elf’s hands grounding him in the moment, even as his mind wrestled with the darker truths he kept hidden. For now, he would let himself believe the lie. For now, he would let Celebrimbor’s love make him feel whole.
He smiled again, more genuinely this time, as he turned to face Celebrimbor. "I am fortunate," he murmured, his voice low and filled with a tenderness he rarely allowed himself to show. “Fortunate to have you, Tyelpe.”
Celebrimbor’s eyes softened, and he pulled Annatar close, his hands resting lightly against the Maia’s back. “No,” Celebrimbor whispered, pressing a kiss to his lips, soft and full of promise. “It is I who am fortunate.”
As he pulled away, Annatar’s heart twisted painfully in his chest as he stared at the elf who loved him so fiercely, so completely. At least for now, he would try to be the being Celebrimbor saw in him.
And as Celebrimbor led him away from the mirror, speaking enthusiastically about a new project he had in mind, Annatar cast one last glance at his reflection.
The golden Maia in the mirror smiled back at him, radiant and pure.
But the shadow lurking beneath his skin remained.
