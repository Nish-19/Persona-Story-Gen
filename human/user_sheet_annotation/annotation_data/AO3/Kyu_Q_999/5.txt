During a friendly sparring match, Celebrimbor begins to realize that Annatar's skill with a blade—and his unsettling ease with a concealed dagger—hints at a past far more dangerous than he lets on. What other secrets might Annatar be hiding?


#### Story ####
The air in the practice yard of Eregion’s stronghold was crisp, carrying with it the faint scent of iron and the distant clang of metal from the nearby forges. Celebrimbor stood opposite Annatar, practice sword in hand, a curious expression on his face as he studied his companion.
“Are you sure about this, Annatar? I wouldn’t wanna force you.” Celebrimbor asked, a hint of uncertainty in his voice. He had suggested the friendly spar on a whim, as a way to pass the time and perhaps even gauge Annatar’s proficiency with combat, considering his expertise in crafting weapons and armor.
Annatar, however, seemed unfazed by the prospect, a confident smirk playing at the corners of his lips. “Of course, Tyelpe,” he replied picking up a practice sword, his tone laced with amusement. “I’m always up for a challenge.”
With a nod, Celebrimbor took a step back, readying himself for the bout to come. He had sparred with many skilled warriors in his time, but there was something about facing off against Annatar that set his nerves on edge.
As they circled each other, their movements fluid and precise, Celebrimbor couldn’t shake the feeling of unease that prickled at the back of his mind. There was an intensity in Annatar’s gaze, a determination that belied his usual easygoing demeanor.
The clang of practice swords echoed through the empty yard as Celebrimbor and Annatar faced off against each other. Celebrimbor couldn’t help but marvel at Annatar’s grace and agility - he moved with a dancer’s finesse, his every movement calculated and deliberate, darting in and out of his reach as he sought to land a blow.
Celebrimbor, on the other hand, relied more on his years of formal training and experience, parrying Annatar’s attacks with ease and countering with lightning-fast strikes of his own.
Suddenly, Annatar lunged forward, his practice sword flashing in the sunlight as he aimed a swift strike at Celebrimbor’s side. Reacting on instinct, Celebrimbor deflected the blow with his own sword, the shrill clash of metal ringing out through the yard.
They continued to exchange blows, each trying to anticipate the next steps. Mingled with an inexplicable hint of panic, Celebrimbor felt a surge of admiration and respect for Annatar’s skill and prowess, despite a seeming lack of formal training.
But just as Celebrimbor began to let his guard down, thinking he had figured out Annatar’s approach to combat, the Maia's expression shifted, a mischievous glint dancing in his golden eyes. Without warning, he dropped his practice sword, reaching instead for a dagger concealed at his waist.
Celebrimbor’s eyes widened in alarm as Annatar closed the distance between them, the dagger flashing in the sunlight as it arced toward him. Instinctively, he raised his own sword to block the attack, but Annatar’s movements were too quick, too precise.
In the blink of an eye, Celebrimbor found himself staring down the length of the dagger, its edge hovering dangerously close to his throat. He froze, his breath catching in his throat as he realized the gravity of the situation - if Annatar had desired it, he could have struck him down without hesitation.
For a moment, there was silence, broken only by the sound of their labored breathing. Then, to Celebrimbor’s surprise, Annatar let out a hearty laugh, the tension melting away as quickly as it had appeared.
“Well, that was unexpected,” Celebrimbor managed to say, his voice shaky with adrenaline.
Annatar grinned, twirling the dagger between his fingers with practiced ease. “Did I frighten you?” he replied, his tone teasing. “I have to admit, I do have a few tricks up my sleeve,” he added, his tone casual as if they were discussing the weather.
Celebrimbor couldn’t help but chuckle, shaking his head in disbelief. “I suppose I should have known better than to underestimate you,” he admitted.
Annatar’s grin widened, his eyes sparkling with mischief. “Don’t worry, Tyelpe dear,” he said, his voice low and conspiratorial. “I promise to only use my combat skills for your protection, should the need arise.”
Despite the jest, Celebrimbor couldn’t shake the lingering sense of unease that lingered in the back of his mind. He now knew that Annatar was more than capable of defending himself – and others – should he wish to. But there was something about the ease with which he concealed and wielded the dagger that left him unsettled.
Pushing aside his concerns for the moment, Celebrimbor offered Annatar a wry smile. “I’ll hold you to that,” he said, his voice tinged with amusement.
With a nod of agreement, Annatar picked up and returned his practice sword to its sheath, the tension of the spar dissipating like the morning mist. As they made their way back to the forges, Celebrimbor couldn’t help but wonder what other surprises Annatar had up his sleeve – and whether he
