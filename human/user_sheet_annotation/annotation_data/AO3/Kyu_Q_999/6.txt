#### Story ####
Under the soft glow of the hearth fire in their cozy hut on the borders of Doriath, Beleg and Túrin once more found solace and comfort in each other's presence, as they often did when the world did not demand their attention. The flames cast dancing shadows across the room, creating an ambiance of warmth and intimacy.
Túrin sat cross-legged on the rug before the hearth, his back propped against a stack of cushions, his eyes fixed on the flickering flames. Beleg was sprawled out beside him, his head resting in Túrin's lap. His silvery hair, a stark contrast to the rich tones of the rug, flowed like a river of moonlight.
Túrin's fingers idly traced patterns through Beleg's hair, combing through the silken strands. It was a soothing ritual, one that had become second nature to them. Beleg closed his eyes, a contented sigh escaping his lips as he relished in the sensation.
The night beyond the windows was cold and dark, but within their hut, a cocoon of warmth and affection enveloped them. The hearth crackled and popped, radiating a gentle heat that banished the chill from the room.
"Tell me a story," Túrin whispered, his voice soft like the rustling leaves in a gentle breeze. "Please?"
Beleg's lips curved into a smile even though his eyes remained closed. "Very well. What kind of story would you like to hear tonight, my love?"
Túrin's fingers continued their rhythmic dance through Beleg's hair as he contemplated. "Tell me of a great adventure, one where heroes rise against insurmountable odds."
"So it shall be," Beleg began, his voice a soothing murmur. "Once upon a time, in a land not so different from our own, there lived a valiant hero named… Túrin. He was known throughout the realm for his bravery and unyielding spirit, even though he was a bit stubborn and reckless."
Túrin chuckled softly. "Go on."
"Yet, even the bravest of heroes have their moments of doubt," Beleg continued. "And so it was that Túrin found himself facing a formidable foe, a dragon of immense size and power."
Túrin's fingers stilled in Beleg's hair, his eyes focused on the imaginary world his lover was weaving with his words. "How did he defeat the dragon?"
"Ah, patience. That is the heart of the tale," Beleg replied. "Túrin knew that he could not conquer the dragon through strength alone. So, he embarked on a quest to find the dragon's secret weakness, a vulnerability that even the mightiest of beasts possessed."
As Beleg's storytelling continued, the room seemed to fade away, and Túrin found himself immersed in the adventure. He listened with rapt attention, his mind painting vivid images of the hero's journey, the dragon, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil.
Outside, the wind whispered secrets to the trees, but within their hut, Beleg's voice was the only sound that mattered. The flames in the hearth danced to the rhythm of the story, casting ever-shifting shadows on the walls.
As Beleg's tale neared its conclusion, Túrin felt a profound sense of contentment wash over him. The world beyond their walls could be chaotic and unforgiving, but here, in their little haven, it wouldn’t reach them.
"And so," Beleg concluded, "Túrin, armed with the knowledge of the dragon's weakness, faced the beast one final time. He waited for a fortunate moment to strike and, with a heart full of courage and determination, he struck true and thus brought an end to the reign of terror."
Túrin smiled down at Beleg, his heart filled with admiration and love. "Thank you for this story. Though I think it would do Túrin good if he had someone to rely on by his side, perhaps someone called Beleg?"
Beleg opened his eyes and gazed at Túrin with a tender expression, though worry was beginning to creep in. "Then you might as well make this story a future prediction. We do not know if or when Morgoth will let his worms loose against us."
Leaning down, Túrin captured Beleg's lips in a gentle kiss, a testament to the love that bound them together. Their lips met with a soft and lingering sweetness, like the taste of honey on a crisp autumn morning.
"Then we will meet those creatures head on and rise triumphant, just how the hero in your story did," Túrin whispered against his lover's lips.
As they pulled away, Túrin settled back against the cushions, his fingers resuming their gentle caresses through Beleg's hair. The fire continued to burn brightly, casting a warm and inviting glow over their sanctuary.
Finally, another undisturbed evening that was theirs alone to enjoy.
