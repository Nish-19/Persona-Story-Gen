#### Writing Prompt ####
Back in London, surrounded by familiar rain and proper tea, he can't shake the feeling that something—or someone—is missing. When his mother casually mentions how his eyes light up at the mention of Camille, he begins to wonder if the island he left behind holds more than just sunshine and work.


#### Story ####
He cannot begin to express what a feeling it is to be back in London again. There is finally proper tea around every corner, as opposed to just one place on an entire island that serves it (not that he would ever say so out loud on saint Marie, catherine must never know), it rains (real rain, cold, wet, terrible rain) and he can walk down the streets without being assaulted by colours everywhere (although eh will admit that he doesn’t mind the colours too much, all things considered. They are… well, they liven up a place, he is ready to admit that if only to himself).
Although at the same time… something is missing, and he just can’t put his finger on it, which frustrates him because it’s basically his job to do just that.
He’ll figure it out eventually, he tells himself, because he always does. He doesn’t mention it to anyone, of course, because it is ridiculous.
Plus, it’s not like anyone could actually help him in this regard (or so he thinks). After all, he doesn’t really have friends (if he doesn’t count Camille and his team on Saint Marie) and when it comes to his parents.. well… they are not.. that close (like Camille and Catherine, for example). And he’s not in the habit of making small talk anyway (although dad called him a chatterbox not long ago because he was describing the market on the island and got carried away).
But really, if he were to review his stay in London so far, eh would say that all has been going rather well. The lats few days especially, when he was wrapping everything up and working through when he can return to Saint maire, which will be in five days time, not that he is counting.
And then Mum jumps on him the second he enters their house, telling him she’s made tea, and at first he doesn’t understand why she seems so eager, and then –
“So you say Saint Marie is lovely at this time of the year?”
“Hot. As always”.
She tuts. “I bet your colleagues don’t mind it.”
“They grew up there” he explains. “They’re used to it. And Camille specially –“ And then he’s off explaining again that she is after him to install an A/C, but that it would be a waste in his shack.
After he falls silent, Mum seems to think about something or other, so he searches fort a topic of conversation and has started asking after old Mrs. Webster from next door, when –
“I saw your eyes light up” his mother then declares in one of those non-sequiturs she loves, and Richar is once again lost.
“I beg your pardon?”
She shakes her head. “When you mentioned Camille. I saw your eyes light up.”
“I – what does that even mean?” Eyes do not light up. He is aware it’s used metaphorically, of course, but even so, he could never quite understand what people meant by it.
She gives him a look he remembers from his teen years when he dared try and smoke cigarettes in his room – alright, one cigarette, one afternoon, and that expression put a stop to it immediately. But he’s no longer a child, so –
“Tell me more about Camille” she then demands, and he can’t really say anything against that because she is his second in command, and he likes to imagine a friend, even if he would dispute the fact as he did already once before when she seemed to suggest such.
Ade so, he talks about Camille and how she made him agree to small talk in the mornings and spending time at la Kaz after the day is done and that she likes to show up and drag him out of his “monastic cell” as she insists on calling it and that he usually goes with her because it’s easier… undoubtedly Mum, who has always appreciated her own company too, otherwise she would hardly have married his father, who can be even more silent than Richard on any given occasion, will understand that it can be frustrating for him –
But for some reason, she just keeps smiling, and he keeps talking and…
He forces himself to stop because certainly no one should know this much about a colleague, but Mum simply smiles again and pats his hand. “I’m sure your differences are not all that great, dearest. It will all work out.”
He’s not quite sure what she means, but instead focuses back on what he has to pack.
Mum will tell him, she usually does.
As she indeed does, five years later when she convinces Dad to move to Saint Marie once and for all so they can watch their grandchildren grow up, Camille more than happy to help her parents-in-law settle in.
