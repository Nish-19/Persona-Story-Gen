#### Writing Prompt ####
Late at night on the empty bridge, Cody finds solace in the quiet hum of the ship, only to be interrupted by Obi-Wan, whose presence brings warmth, understanding, and a moment of stolen tenderness amidst the chaos of war.


#### Story ####
Cody tugs his bucket off his head, placing it carefully onto the empty surface next to him, the screens deactivated hours ago but the air just above them hums with static. It crackles against his skin, the bare sliver at his wrist between the heavy fabric of his gloves and the thinner lining of his bodysuit, and he presses his hand down, just letting himself breathe. He exists in the hollow between the base of his skull and the curls that hang heavy with sweat, the hum of the air recycling accompanying a chill washing over him, and he pulls himself away from the table. The stations are empty on the main bridge; a skeleton crew stationed a couple of levels down and Cody is alone here. He turns the empty eyes of his helmet away, directing the face towards the wall as he has already experienced the strange disconnect of seeing a brother’s helmet discarded on a table but somehow, still watching him. One of the chairs squeaks as he draws it back, spinning it from side to side by rocking his palm over the back. Some of the covering flakes off and sticks to his skin and he picks it off as he returns to the table to retrieve the other items he had brought with him.
He just couldn’t be in his room any longer.
His caf is still warm, a faint curl of steam spilling from the top of the mug as Cody removes the lid, knocking the condensation back into the mug and wiping the remains on his trousers. Peeling off his gloves with his teeth, Cody cups the mug, ignoring the notification flashing on his datapad for the moment. The ping from his helmet is dull, echoing strangely in the vast space, and Cody hears it several seconds late and still ignores it. He just needs a moment, a single solitary moment before reality can break into the fragments between his armour and begin to rot him away once more. He doesn’t need to do this, but he wants to. Obi-Wan had mentioned the pile of reports he had to look into several hours earlier and sleep is still several hours away so Cody has taken the datapad and a handful of supplies to work through them. He can be useful like this when he can not do anything else.
The hours slip by slowly, every minute drawn out to the breaking point before it passes. Cody sips at his caf, the liquid cooling into near-enough sludge that Cody scrapes his teeth against as he flips onto the next report. The door slides open behind him and Cody starts, his knee impacting against the underside of the console and his cup falls from the side as he knocks it with his elbow when he turns. The smash he is expecting never happens.
“Hello, love.” Obi-Wan’s hand is extended, his first two fingers pressed against his thumb and he moves his hand, sweeping it in a delicate circle. Cody’s mug, suspended in midair, taps against the desk, sliding across the surface until it rests a handspan further in than it had previously. “You’re here late.”
“I could say the same thing about you.” Cody scrubs his hand against his knee, the pain a dull pulse that is swiftly lessening from the initial bright burst of agony, and looks over at Obi-Wan, grinning up at the other man. “How did you know it was me from over there?”
Obi-Wan chuckles, tipping his head to one side as he folds his hands together over his stomach. He is dressed in soft layers, a pale robe belted over a darker shirt and trousers, and everything flows as he walks over, curling his arms around Cody. He leans down, pressing his cheek to Cody’s, his beard scratching in a way that prickles and aches and Cody leans into it all the same. It would be so easy to kiss Obi-Wan like this, to turn his face and lean in impossibly closer. They have done so much together, lived a thousand lifetimes in the space between battles when they can be just men instead of a Commander and his General. He loved Obi-Wan before he had the words for it.
“You shine in the Force, my dear. I could find you amongst a sea of your brothers, even without your stripes on your armour or your scar. I know you.”
Cody flushes, leaning into Obi-Wan’s touch and tapping the side of his head against Obi-Wan’s temple. The other man hums low in the base of his throat, squeezing Cody even tighter before he stands, sliding into the chair next to Cody. He props his head onto his hands, scratching idly at one cheek, and Cody picks the datapad back up, opening the next file. “You don’t need to stay. I can do this for you.”
“No. I want to stay.” Obi-Wan slumps forward with a sigh, stretching his arms across the console until his palms press against the wall. He blinks up at the dark screen and then turns his gaze towards Cody. “You don’t have to do this for me either.”
“I want to.”
Obi-Wan carefully rises to his feet, the chair sliding back on its rails as he does so. “I’ll get us both something to drink. Would you like caf?”
“Please.”
Obi-Wan leans down and Cody turns his head without a thought to kiss him. It’s quick, a barely-there brush of their lips before Obi-Wan draws back, blinking. “Yes?” he murmurs, his lips parted and his breath is sweet, a lingering floral scent from his tea several hours ago.
“Yes,” Cody answers and leans forward to kiss him again.
