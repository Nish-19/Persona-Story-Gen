#### Writing Prompt ####
After weeks of enduring Umbridge's cruel detentions, Harry's hand refuses to heal, and Snape unexpectedly takes notice. What happens when the professor's sharp tongue is paired with an uncharacteristic act of care?


#### Story ####
In the stillness and silence of Umbridge's office, Harry sat writing his lines. All that could be heard was the scratching of the Quill and the occasional meowing of Umbridge's cat portraits. Harry almost felt like he was in a dream, about to wake up soon.
Almost. The pain in his hand stopped him from falling into the dreamlike state completely. A pity, as perhaps the time would pass faster.
“That will do.”
Harry dropped the quill with a silent sigh of relief, resisting the urge to clutch his injured hand. Umbridge held out her hand for her usual inspection, and Harry offered it, eager to be done. His bed in the dorm was like a siren, calling him to fall into the nothingness it brought.
“Same time tomorrow,” Umbridge said, and Harry had a sudden urge to punch the smile off her face permanently. Almost as If she could hear his thoughts, her smile widened. “After all, it hasn't sunk in just yet, has it?”
“No, Professor.”
Finally, his hand was released, and Harry grabbed his bag and dragged himself out of the office and to Gryffindor Tower.
“There you are! She kept you for much longer than usual, didn't she?”
“Dunno,” Harry said tiredly, dropping into a chair in front of the fire. The usual bowl of dittany sat on the table, and Harry soaked his hand gratefully. Hermione watched anxiously.
“It's still not healing properly.”
“Better than nothing,” Ron said. “You can't risk Snape again, Hermione.”
“Again?”
Hermione turned pink. “I wanted to see if there was something stronger than dittany in Professor Snape's stores, but— well, he caught me.”
“Oh no! What happened?”
“Nothing, actually. He told me that the only reason Dittany wouldn't be working was if something was preventing it, and
‘I'd better not hear you have been using Dark Magic, Granger.’
”
“No detention?” Harry asked disbelievingly.
Hermione shrugged. “I still don't understand what is wrong with dittany. We know the quill is not the problem as it was healing before. Why isn't it now?”
“It works enough,” Harry mumbled, eyes closed. “Enough for me to be able to…”
He was asleep before he finished the sentence.
When Harry woke up, the bowl of dittany had fallen to the floor and there was an awful crick in his neck. His hand was throbbing dully and he lifted it up to look at it with bleary eyes.
The words were swollen and disfigured, and Harry could only make them out because he knew what it said. Harry touched it slightly and hissed at the burn, dropping his hand. Firmly pushing it out of his mind, he picked up the bag that he'd dropped the night before and settled down to do his homework. He doubted he would manage to finish even one essay, but he couldn't bring himself to care.
He changed his mind later that morning as he looked up at Snape's angry eyes.
“Detention, Potter. After dinner.”
“Can't,” Harry said. “Got detention with Umbridge.”
Snape's lips thinned. “After, then. Or is that too late for Mr. Celebrity?”
Harry could have argued that he did need to sleep, but he just didn't have the energy. Instead, he just nodded and started on his potion, ignoring Hermione's furious inquiries.
After dinner found Harry back in Umbridge's office. It had been two hours, and Harry was dreading the long detention still ahead of him when Umbridge spoke.
“That will do.”
Harry looked up in surprise. Umbridge had a sour look on her face that reminded him of Aunt Petunia.
“Professor Snape could not find any other time for your detention, but you
will
make it up to me, Mr. Potter.”
Harry squashed down his disgust. “Of course, Professor.”
Hardly believing his luck, Harry started the long trek to the dungeons. Why did Snape's office have to be so far away?
Finally, Snape's door appeared, and Harry lifted a heavy hand to knock on it.
“Come in!”
Harry pushed the door open with considerable effort.
“You are late, Potter.”
“Just back from detention,” Harry said, too tired to glare. There were a few dozen cauldrons stacked in the corner, and Harry headed for them, before Snape's voice stopped him in his tracks.
“Did I say you were to do cauldrons?”
“Sorry,” Harry turned to Snape. “What am I going to do then?”
“Lines.” Snape smiled cruelly.
Harry stared. Since when did Snape have him do lines?
“Well?” Snape snapped. “Get on with it.”
Feeling like he was dreaming again, Harry sat down on the chair. Thankfully, the quill besides the parchment was a regular quill.
“What should I write?”
“What should I write, Sir?”
“I must do my homework on time.”
“Right.” Harry bent down to begin his lines, but he could still feel Snape’s eyes on him.
“What is wrong with your hand, Potter?”
“What?” Harry asked, confused. “Nothing.”
He put the quill down and held up his hand for emphasis.
Snape's brow furrowed. “Do you think me a fool? Other hand.”
Harry reluctantly opened the left hand towards Snape, palm up. Snape yanked at it and turned it over, and Harry winced.
It looked even worse than it had in the morning. The whole area was bright red so that the harsh words couldn't be seen anymore, and bright yellow splotches were visible.
“Have you tried dittany?”
Harry looked back at Snape’s sharp voice. He looked even angrier than normal, which was saying something.
“Yeah,” Harry shrugged. It worked in the beginning, but slowly it just— stopped.”
“How long has this been going on?” Snape asked, summoning a jar. Harry caught sight of the label as it flew into Snape's hand —
Antibacterial Aloe Cream.
“Dunno,” Harry said. “A month, maybe.”
“Are you feeling cold? Or feverish?
“Yeah,” Harry muttered, looking at Snape's desk. He felt exposed, and if his hand hadn't been so tightly held by Snape, he might have run off.
Finally, Snape released his hand and drew his wand. Harry tensed.
“A diagnostic Charm.”
Snape waved his wand and Harry felt a warmth spread through him, which left as quickly as it had come.
“How shocking. You have an infection. When did you last eat?”
“Dinner,” Harry mumbled.
“Let me define eating, then. It refers to the act of putting food in your mouth, chewing, and swallowing it. Keeping that in mind, when did you last eat?”
Harry shrugged, going red with embarrassment.
Snape sighed. “You have detention every day —”
“Hey!” Harry protested, his anger flaring up. “What for?!”
“— After dinner,” Snape continued, speaking over him. “You have been unnaturally disruptive, and this is the only time I can spare out of my busy day to oversee your detentions.”
“Oh. Oh,” Harry said, understanding. “Alright, thanks.”
“Do not thank me, Potter. The Wizarding World would self-destruct if they were to lose their celebrity. It is entirely self-interest, I assure you.”
Harry stared. Harry might be feeling hazy, but he was sure Snape had just made a joke.
“Now,” Snape said, summoning a vial. “A mouthful every morning and evening. Now get to bed, immediately.”
“The detention,” Harry protested.
Snape raised an eyebrow. “Do you want to write lines?”
Harry blushed. “Not particularly.”
“Then get out of my sight.”
Harry stood up and turned to leave.
“The vial, Potter.”
Too embarrassed to look at Snape, Harry snatched the vial and fled.
