#### Story ####
Thiten Hûb began as a small fishing village, then became a charming trading port, and finally transformed into a delightful and exclusive holiday resort. Over the years, even the princes of Dol Amroth found refuge in this enchanting place with their families. It was situated in a small bay, well protected from stormy winds and waves that could erode its shores, as well as from the incursions of the pirates of Umbar. A villa of rough white stone, called Bâr Láranen, stood almost perched over the sea. Pink and violet bougainvillea climbed along its walls, and a row of olive trees, myrtles, and lemons surrounded and concealed it from view. A staircase carved into the rock led down to the small private cove, where a dock was built, and the princes' boats were always moored. These said princes, all young men between eighteen and twenty-five years of age, dressed in cool raw linen tunics and trousers rolled up to their ankles, were busy joking amongst themselves. They threw jests and colorful skeins of thread at each other and splashed water with their bare feet. Their laughter rose high into the light turquoise sky, rivaling the cries of the seagulls.
Not far away, sitting with a discontented expression and her chin resting on her hand, Lothíriel watched them with pouting lips. This particular year she felt more isolated than ever: during the winter she had given her first tribute as a woman and now could no longer participate in the rambunctious activities she loved to do with her brothers and cousins. She still remembered when just the year before, she could lift her skirts and walk barefoot around one of the boats while Elphir called her:
"Come, Looloo, help us prepare the nets!"
"Alright, but I would like to come with you!"
Erchirion had smiled and tousled her hair:
"You're too little for these things. Maybe next time."
She had turned her face away, annoyed, and had sighed in despair:
"Always next time..."
Meanwhile, the three brothers had boarded the boat, and as they moved away on the sparkling water, Amrothos had shouted back to her, laughing:
"Don't worry, Looloo. I'll teach you to fish next time. I promise!"
But now that she was old enough to follow her brothers, that same condition prevented her from joining them. While the court at Bâr Láranen was small and life more relaxed, Lothíriel found herself facing the new restrictions imposed by her transition to adulthood, making her even more annoyed and frustrated.
"Lothíriel, straighten those shoulders and wear your hat."
The stern but gentle voice of her aunt Ivrinel cut through the air, her authoritative commands ringing clearly. Lothíriel immediately straightened up, but in a tiny act of rebellion refused to wear the hat, letting the sun's glare hide her impending tears. She dearly loved her aunt, who had tried to be a guardian and affectionate companion since her mother's death, but she was not yet ready to yield to the impositions of her new condition.
Bored, she sat on the small woven straw chair and watched her aunt placidly weaving cotton thread. Amrothos noticed his sister's gaze and approached her quietly:
"Hey, Looloo, you could make yourself useful and learn as well: then you could weave our nets!"
Lothíriel jumped and replied sharply:
"Don't call me that."
She tried to maintain her composure, and even though she adored her childhood nickname, it made her feel small and vulnerable. But Erchirion gave a complicit chuckle and supported his brother:
"And maybe you could wipe that gloomy expression off your face: you're making the sky darken!"
"Ah, leave it be, Erchirion," Amrothos intervened, "She's just upset because she can't play like a child anymore."
She glanced at her elder brother Elphir, who ignored her completely, focused on the fishing gear, making her feel even more invisible and isolated.
As every summer, the older cousins from Minas Tirith used to spend a few weeks at Thiten Hûb as guests of their uncle, to rest from the exertions of academic studies and military training. Mostly, to escape the atmosphere of sadness and the suffocating pressure always present in the Steward's house.
Even Faramir had approached her and smiled with an expression of pity in his eyes. This hurt her more than anything, but she stoically pressed her lips together. Faramir said gently:
"Don't fret too much, nethig: we will catch a fish for you. The fattest and tenderest, and we will roast it tonight with the most fragrant herbs in your honor."
"It's not the same."
She replied sullenly. He shrugged, being used to sharp responses and brusque manners since childhood. Even now, away from the pressure of Minas Tirith, Faramir maintained that patient calm he had learned as a child. He pulled back his hair and, with a little smile, went to confer with Elphir. Lothíriel immediately regretted the rudeness she had shown to Faramir, hunched back over her chair, and bit her lip. At that moment, Boromir turned towards her, haloed by the sun's reflection. His long black hair waved in the breeze, and to her eyes, he appeared as one of those legendary heroes of ancient times: Beren or Tuor or even Elendil, whom she used to sigh over during her evening readings. Boromir, in turn, approached the young girl with an enchanting smile, and she immediately straightened up and tucked a dark curl behind her ear. If Faramir, with his sweetness and patience, was close to her heart as a brother, Boromir, with his charisma and imposing presence, represented everything she imagined in a hero. When he smiled at her, her heart began to beat faster, and Lothíriel felt nervous and happy. For some time now, thinking about her cousin caused a sort of stir that made her agitated and euphoric at the same time, as if she had drunk a few drops too many of the sweet rose wine that Aunt Ivrinel hid in her dresser. Boromir addressed her playfully:
"So, little one, why don't you come fishing with us anymore?"
Lothíriel squirmed in her chair as she felt the heat rise to her cheeks:
"It's just... that... I can't anymore."
She stammered, trying not to reveal too much. She was terribly embarrassed by her secret, yet she felt the need to appear mature and worthy in front of him, though somewhat intimidated by his presence. A flash of understanding crossed Boromir's blue eyes, so he crouched beside her and said in a warm, reassuring voice:
"Don't worry, Lothíriel, we will find something fun to do together."
Being called by her full name made her feel special and important. She couldn't suppress a flirtatious smile as she asked:
"Really?"
"Yes, really. Gweston!"
He replied with a warm, enveloping laugh, placing a hand on his heart. Then he stood up and gave her a gentle pat on the head before joining the other boys. Lothíriel watched him go, feeling the spot where he had touched her sizzle, her heart still in turmoil. She hoped he would keep his promise, and her lips curled into a satisfied smile.
"Lothíriel, come help me with this thread."
The firm but gentle voice of her aunt called her back to reality. Indeed, Ivrinel's attentive eyes had not missed the sighs and yearnings of her niece. Lothíriel sighed slightly but obediently approached her aunt. As she walked over, she cast one last glance at the boys on the boat sailing away on the shimmering sea. With a sigh, she began to work alongside Ivrinel, but her mind kept returning to that smile and that promise. She vowed that one day she would find a way to spend time alone with Boromir, and that thought filled her heart with a sweet and eager anticipation.
