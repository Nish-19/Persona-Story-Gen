#### Writing Prompt ####
As Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson settle into retirement, they face their greatest challenge yet: organizing decades of case files, photographs, and memories from their detective adventures. But amidst the chaos of scrapbooks and nostalgia, they uncover more than just old cases—reminders of love, loss, and the journeys still to come.


#### Story ####
As much as they might desire to find calm and relaxation in their retirement, both Dr Watson and Mr Holmes were keenly aware of how much work the moving would take. In view of this, they had taken their measures: Mr Holmes had moved two months earlier than the doctor, accomplishing both to give time to the doctor to say all his private goodbyes and to start preparing the cottage and roughly tidying up their belongings in smaller solutions making it much easier and much less of a gruelling job, Dr Watson visited regularly and regularly shipped parts of their things. Despite all their preparations and planning, none of them had imagined even in their worst nightmares what would have been to transport their archive.
The archive was the collection of their 20-and-change years of detective and writing activity, it was composed by the Index, the commonplace books, the scrapbooks, Watson’s and Holmes’ separate notes on the cases and Watson’s drafts and writings. It was massive.
In early march 1904, while making the plan, they decided that it would be shipped in several properly labelled trunks by Doctor Watson and left alone until the last trunk hadn’t been received and only then they would re-organize it together.
It had taken five trunks filled to the brim and three weeks to ship it all and now the trunks had been sitting in their new sitting room for two weekly visits from Watson already, and, as much as the doctor put the blame of it on his husband, no jury would have declared him innocent.
It was a pleasantly warm Saturday morning toward the end of May that the two men swallowed their fear of the trunks and decided to tackle the beast.
The two of them wearing only a pair of comfortable trousers and their shirt, a pot full of black coffee and one full of tea to serve for their nerves, the bookshelves scrubbed clean of any dust and the boxes labelled and ready to be used. The detective and the doctor moved the trunks so that they could all be accessed comfortably and then set to begin.
They unloaded the first trunk completely and set to reclassify their oldest cases, Holmes sitting on the carpet and Watson organizing them in the boxes he had designed so many years earlier.
“1883, Holmes. Careful, they should be ordered already.” He asked, adjusting the pipe in his mouth.
“They are, but you should also include the two scrapbooks of that year, I believe. – Answered the detective handing him the files of the cases while keeping the scrapbook open on his knees. – Look here, so many things. There’s a photograph of us too.” He smiled.
The doctor grinned as well. “Look at those young chaps, how much time it passed. Anyway, no Holmes, the scrapbooks and commonplace books go in the boxes under the shelf. First we organize the cases, then the books.”
The detective laughed, dragging his husband down to steal a kiss. “As captain orders.”
It took them until lunchtime to organize all the cases, then after a light meal and some more coffee they set to reorganize the scrapbooks, Holmes still sitting on the carpet but the doctor relocating on the couch.
“What a journey it is, Sherlock.” Smiled the doctor, nostalgic.
“Indeed, through time. – Purred the detective as his husband ruffled his hair even more, making some strands fall over his eyes. – Do you know this pretty chap in a military uniform? I believe he would still look dashing with it.” He showed the photograph to his partner, who laughed.
“Oh, I really don’t believe it to be the case, my love. That chap was at least ten years younger than I am now...”
“But you look just as handsome now as you did back then. This goes in my private ‘Watson’ folder.”
“Shouldn’t it go on the mantel?” Chuckled the doctor.
“No, no. I have other photographs of yours for the mantelpiece.”
“Not the other ones we took in ‘95, I hope.” He grinned.
“Oh John, where you bring me in my memory. No, those are also in my private folder.”
“As yours are in my own. This is the 1895 one?”
“No, the 1886. One of the two I filled, I don’t know how your photograph ended up here. I believe because we also have your photograph with your comrades from the army here, also uniformed.” He showed another picture of a yet younger Watson.
“So much time…”
“As you said, a journey through memory. Let’s get the 1887-8 book. Few things happened that year, I only needed one book.”
“Don’t you have portraits of Mrs Norton?” Informed himself the doctor.
“No, my dear fellow. But I have yours, one photograph of you and Mrs Watson and one of us three together. You looked really handsome in that waistcoat.”
“As you did with that suit, my lovely. Mary was beautiful as well.” Watson’s sentence ended up barely louder than a whisper and the detective reached up to pat his arm in comfort.
“She was, beloved. She truly was.”
“It’s how these journeys are, is it not? Beautiful stretches and some less pleasant ones.”
“Indeed. We should have a trip, my love. A grand tour after we retire.” Proposed Holmes.
“Around the world?"
"Indeed. I should like to visit India with you.”
“Then let’s finish this journey, let’s move properly and then let us set for a less metaphorical one.”
“It’s a beautiful plan, my love. I like it.” Laughed the detective.
Watson smiled, then sighed, determined. “Now let’s start again with the work, my love. We need to finish, so we can spend tomorrow lazying in bed.”
“You scintillate today, my dear fellow! Yet another excellent plan.” Grinned Holmes, making Watson laugh.
