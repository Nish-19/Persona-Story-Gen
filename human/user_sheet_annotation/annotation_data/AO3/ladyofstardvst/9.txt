#### Writing Prompt ####
A storm rages outside, but the true tempest brews within the castle walls as Prince Aemond seeks you out, guilt and tension heavy in the air after a heated argument. Will the storm outside mirror the one between you, or will the calm finally break through?


#### Story ####
The afternoon air was thick with tension and dripping destruction, though you seemed to be none the wiser. So swept up were you, in the beauty of deep blue skies and the path of charcoal gray clouds as they passed by on the warm wind. The parchment balanced on your knee was half forgotten, the pot of ink and writing quill sitting on the windowsill as a mere figment, now. A storm must be brewing over the sea, and you wondered if you would experience it before night fell and sleep welcomed you with wide open arms.
Prince Aemond was many things, on many occasions, for many people. He was calculating, yet
tempered
. Unforgiving, attentive.
Impulsive
, and intelligent. He was
wild
, yet subtlety - veiled or otherwise - had proven to be a quality that he had shown little interest in practicing. It was something he never seemed to regret, even if it meant spiraling petty feuds into further disarray, or simply tugging on fraying threads during family dinners that lead to hurled threats and slamming doors. It was a little cocoon of his own making, this calmly crafted life of controlled chaos.
Yet you were the exception - both you
and
Heleana - until, of course, it was only you that remained shielded no longer.
You were oblivious, in your daydreams, to the chaos raging fierce and strong in your own home - until the door to your rooms flew open to
crack
sharply on the wall behind.
Aemond didn’t expect to find you here. With the evening promising rain and fury, he assumed you’d be enjoying the fresh air as long as time allowed,
but
. He had come here to breathe, yet the irritation simmering slow and hot and vicious under his skin craved a release of any kind, as it always does.
Regret
was hardly an intimate word for Aemond, yet it lingered, unyielding, clouding his mind once the red melted from his vision and his blackened heart returned to gold.
The way he’d allowed his lack of care to send you slamming the door to your apartments as you left him -
fuming
, in the wake of your own reciprocated wrath - well. It left him feeling anything other than comfort.
It was a whirlwind in the flesh, truly, the tense words he had flung to bite at your heart. Cold, calm fury battered them aside, broke through the weakening shield Aemond held fast around himself in an excuse to project without circumstance. Without consequence. He hadn’t been able to draw blood of course, you knew him too well to know it wasn’t
you
that had cracked his everlasting dragonskin.
You, however, had always been a different story.
Armed to the teeth with words that would puncture, pierce, cut to bleed and
twist
, when pushed too hard, too far; a cloak of blame had been settled upon your shoulders, and it was not yours to bear. You tore it off with a simple tug, flourished the fabric in such a way that it clung to the Prince himself, the villain in this particular instance, but not a villain at heart.
Aemond was left staring where you had once been; a window that was open, brilliant view of the darkening sky echoing behind you, the sole outlet for the latest qualm that had been one push, one prod, one irrelevant instance too far - because,
well
.
As collected as he usually was, there was always
something
that would push anyone over the edge.
Regardless, he had never once abandoned the training grounds to take his ire out on you. He sought only your company after all; a sun, a saint, an equal to temper what always tried to break through the rising tide.
Seven
fucking
hells.
It wasn’t a surprise, when he did not follow you through your rooms, or down the glowing hall.
Sconces were being lit as a false twilight fell, the sweet, early arrival of blue hour inspired haste in the servants lighting your way to the library. The shadows were chased away, one by one; yet the shadow that still enveloped your path was not of nature’s doing, nor was it your own.
Wooden doors loomed before you, bracketed by torches bright and warm and welcoming. You had stalked all the way here you realized, swift and mindless in where your feet had been taking you. Anger still burned through your veins, when you pushed the door open with your whole body. Hinges groaned with the sudden movement jarring them awake.
Silence engulfed you once the door fell shut. Familiarity took you into its arms under the soft light of candles guttering in the fresh stir of air - rarely, did anyone come here at this hour. The knowledge that you wouldn’t be disturbed tempered your fire.
The sigh that left your lips was ragged. Shaken.
Hurt
.
This was something new from Aemond - something that made you wonder
what
in the
seven hells
just
happened
.
Your feet carried you to the nearest window, and the breeze that met your skin was a soft caress tasting of salt and comfort - probably - since that was something you would not be receiving anytime soon, you imagined. Not from the one you wished, at least.
He made that
quite fucking clear
, actually.
The drawl of distant rumbling welcomed you as you journeyed farther into the room, fingers trailing along the old wooden tables in your wake. The emptiness was peaceful, the candlelight warm and soft in stark contrast with the scene you just left to simmer. You went to the windows, drawing them in tight, before the rain could intrude where it did not belong.
Anger was a fickle thing,
you thought, turning a corner. The goal was to become lost in the maze of shelves piled high with long forgotten crumbling volumes. To find a tome that caught your eye in the looming shadows, then settle in with it while you tucked yourself up into one of the few window seats with the raging sea below as your steadfast companion.
You’d stay here with your false peace until your eyes drifted closed and your head leaned against rain spattered glass. Unless, of course, you were confident that retracing your steps to venture back wouldn’t reignite what brought you here in the first place. Perhaps then, you would be cooled enough to seek each other’s company, as your heart so longed to do, even now.
Even so, the distant rumbling grew louder with each page you turned. Rain crackled into the glass as the wind whipped past. The more you read, the pages became even more brown and stiff as they slowly shared with you their age.
The storm, once far out of your sight, seemed to be right on top of you now as it unleashed its fury hard and strong and fast as it battered itself again and again and
again
against the city below, and punished the castle walls themselves.
It was because of this, that every sound coming from within was, of course, as good as silent.
“I thought I’d find you here.”
His voice filled what little lull a storm of this magnitude could give. It slid over your skin, soft as silk, slipped in through the little cracks along with the rain and wind and thunder alike.
Prince Aemond stood in the glow of torchlight, illuminated wholly in the warm caress of flickering flame. He remained some distance from you, mindful of the space you held both for yourself, and, more pressingly - the distance you created when he pushed you oh, so splendidly away earlier that evening.
“Well,” your eyes slid away from the prince, to instead find the paragraph they had been pulled away from. Your next words were spoken idly, if not with remnants of
ferocity
coating them as you resumed reading. “You
do
know where I like to hide.”
Aemond shifts his weight - it’s caught out the corner of your eye - and a shadow promptly slips across you to blanket the words on the pages. It was, by design, a darkness you weren’t able to see through, not with the storm outside batting aside the sun’s dying rays with its gray clouds and veils of rain.
Intentional
.
“So you
are
hiding from me.”
“‘
Hide
’ is not the word I would use.”
“Isn’t it?”
The book snapped shut in your hands on a sigh dragged from the weary depths of your heart. They were both, unfortunately, swallowed by another rolling volley of thunder. The timing was so dramatic, so absolutely
you
, that it wasn’t Aemond’s fault when it inspired a harsh roll of his eye.
He could be dramatic too, if only to distract you from the way his lips quirked, the flash of a smile threatening to show itself in the darkness, or in the shine of the firelight still kissing fragments of his skin. Aemond knew this wasn’t the time for jokes, yet even he could appreciate the irony of the trap
he
laid, and, quite gracefully, stepped right into.
Lightning forked through the sky on another crash of thunder, the flash cold in contrast to the warmth of the library. It was jarring, how the harsh, white light exposed everything, always, quickly and quietly before it melted back into the safety of blowing rain and raging waves.
And yet, it was enough. Enough to see the tension weaving its way through Prince Aemond’s jaw, and the set of his shoulders. How he hid his hands behind his back, no doubt clasped and curled in an unbreakable grip. Aemond clearly found no comfort here tonight. He held himself wound tight - even more so, almost, than he did when all the eyes watched him while at court.
You, on the other hand, were relaxed, given the circumstances. Lounging comfortably in the window seat while allowing the peace and the stillness to wash over you in the place you felt safest in all of King’s Landing.
Guilt
, you realized, still sitting in his shadow.
This was what his guilt looked like.
You had wondered if Aemond could even feel such a thing.
“No,” you answered his question slowly. Let the bite fade from your voice and fall into the storm. Let it melt back into nothing. “I believe I would choose ‘
isolate
’. I assumed neither one of us wanted that conversation to continue while clawing at each other’s throats, as we were.”
Aemond took a breath, inhaled loud and sharp in time with a sheet of rain being pushed against the windowpane. He looked away as you watched him, your feet uncurling from their place on the seat, the volume slipping through your fingers to rest beside you.
“No,” he says, “I suppose you’re right.”
You stepped from the shadows and went to him, still hiding in the safety of the dark. He longed to reach for you, longed to feel your skin, warm from the fire, warm from the peace you always seemed to carve for yourself - but his fingertips were cold from the time he spent solitary in your rooms after you had gone. The fires burned to ashes as he tempered himself, once again, into honed steel that the prince sheathed - if only so he could see you again, without drawing blood once more. Now that he found you, he feared you would find only ice under his touch, instead of comfort.
It made his heart
ache
.
And
you
-
Aemond shouldn’t have been surprised, when he found his fingers threaded through yours. A hand glided up to rest on his jaw, guiding it gently to face you. The fire was gone from your eyes, tension nowhere to be found in your body language. He could see in you, just how much you could read him, even when he said so little. Even when he said everything he didn’t mean.
“Come on,” you took a step backwards toward the entrance, tugging on his hand as you did so. The corners of your lips quirked, the prelude of a small smile illuminating the shadows Aemond still hid in. “Let’s go brew some tea and…maybe we can talk.”
His head dips in agreement, oddly silent since he last spoke. It was almost as if…as if he wasn’t sure the words that wanted to spill out would be the right ones.
Kind
ones. Instead, his chilled fingers finally curled gently around your own.
All he can bring himself to say is, “Lead on, darling.”
So you do, leading him through gloomy shadows deepened by the storm, to hallways illuminated by torches, by lightning, by
you
.
