After escaping a harrowing ordeal, Hermione struggles to find safety in the arms of her friends, but the scars of her experience run deep, and healing proves to be as much about trust as it is about time.


#### Story ####
Hermione felt herself disappear from the Malfoy Manor and ended up on the ground somewhere near the water.
“Hermione!” She heard Harry yell for her as he scrambled to her.
“NO! GET AWAY FROM ME!” Hermione screeched as she batted him away.
“It’s me, Harry.” He tried again but to no avail.
“ ’arry?” Fleur softly called out to him. “Are you okay?”
“I’m fine, but Hermione isn’t. Can you help her? She won’t let us near her.” Harry looked up at the blonde witch.
“Certainly,” Fleur carefully stepped forward, “Please move, ‘arry.”
Harry moved out of the way along with Dobby’s body. “Bellatrix tortured her.”
Fleur gasped at the news as she ran a diagnostic spell over her. “She has some bleeding on her arm, and it’s going to take time for her to recover from this.”
“Bleeding?” Harry glanced over.
“I’m bleeding?” Hermione started to itch her arm. “Get this off me.” She started to rock.
Fleur carefully laid her hand on her shoulder. “It’s me, Fleur, mon ami.”
Hermione felt something warm on her shoulder and turned her head. She burst into tears at the sight of Fleur. “Help me.”
“I will. Let me bring you up to the house.” Fleur stood up and held out her hand to help her up.
Hermione tried to get up but collapsed into Fleur’s body due to her weakened state. “Bloody hell.”
“I got you.” Fleur swept her up into her arms and held her lightly so she wouldn’t feel trapped. “I am going to take you to the bedroom so you can have the comfy bed.” Fleur swiftly walked into the cottage. “Bill, I need the med box and everyone out of the bedroom.”
“Got it, Fleur.” Bill ran into the kitchen to get the box and yelled, “Ronald, get back down here.”
“But-” Ron tried to object.
“Ron, Hermione needs tending to, and Fleur needs privacy in order to do it.” Bill used his big brother's voice. “Stay down here.” Bill started to go up when he noticed Luna nursing her arm. “Luna, this way.”
“Shut it, Ron.” Harry snarled when he saw him open his mouth.
Luna scrambled up the stairs and joined the other three. “Yes, Bill?”
“Let me look at your arm while Fleur is bandaging Hermione up.” Bill patted the bed.
“Okay.” Luna hopped up.
Bill and Fleur worked in tandem, giving aid to the two ladies.
“Alright, Hermione, slip into bed and Luna next to her, please,” Fleur spoke firmly. “Hermione, I want Luna with you because I have a feeling there’s going to be nightmares and aftershocks ahead.”
“Okay.” Hermione threw off the heavy covers. “Just the sheet, please.” Hermione tried to get comfortable as Luna slipped in on the other side.
“Hermione, let me hold you. It took Dean to hold me to stop the shaking when I was in the dungeons.” Luna softly encouraged her by opening her arms.
Hermione debated it for a moment but decided to see if she felt safe with her. She carefully slid into her arms. Luna held her loosely. Hermione sighed at the warm cocoon.
Fleur covered them both with a sheet before ushering her husband out. “Call me if you need anything.”
“I think you will know.” Luna sadly whispered.
“D’accord.” Fleur left with the door ajar.
“Try to sleep, Hermione, while you can.” Luna placed Hermione’s head on her shoulder. “I’ve got you.”
“Okay.” Hermione sighed as she tried to stop twitching into a fitful sleep.
Luna started to sing her lullaby, and she felt Hermione calm and go into a more restful sleep. She stayed up that night to watch over her.
