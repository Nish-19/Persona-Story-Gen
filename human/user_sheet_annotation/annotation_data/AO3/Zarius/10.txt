#### Writing Prompt ####
The Doctor discovers a new face among his future selves, one tied to a dark and impossible destiny—what if he becomes the very enemy he's spent lifetimes fighting?


#### Story ####
The Doctor’s head was spinning around. Were he able to break free of the molecular bondage, it would best deemed fit to move out of his way, he just couldn’t get the song out of his head.
Nevertheless, Rogue would persist with the full body scan, and what he unearthed proved most interesting.
Not just to him, but to The Doctor himself.
As the scans unveiled their results, The Doctor found the faces were the same as they’d always been, wise, ancient, forever.
He knew he could revisit any of them, if destiny deemed it fit and proper, if a story hadn’t as yet ended.
But The Doctor noticed something else amongst them, something that greatly unsettled him, and seemed to intrigue Rogue also.
There was a new face.
And a distant, dormant memory awoke within him.
Memories of a time spent on Trenzalore, the prelude to a wider war to come, a battle to preserve his presence in the universe as a predatory being cut through the strands of his carefully woven web in creation. A mind of evil.
A great intelligence.
“You going to stay and stare, or are you going to release me from the molecular bondage?” The Doctor asked.
Rogue stood there slack jawed, for a spell, then gathered himself and did as he was requested.
“Sorry, your story checks out...all your stories, it’s funny, and you...suddenly act like it’s all so new to you”
“It’s still all new to me love and I don’t want to contemplate what could be in store next for me if one of those faces on the scan proves true...”
“Why? What’s the significance of it?” Rogue asked.
“There is an intelligence on this planet that is trying to kill me across all of time and space, I couldn’t stop it, but a friend of mine did, her name was Clara Oswald, and there is a good possibility an echo of her exists here, in this century, on these very grounds, on the patch of green we walked across on route to your ship, she is out there, fighting for every breath you make and every step you, and I, take”
“And seeing one of your faces convinces you of all that?”
“Isn’t it obvious Rogue? I wear that face, it isn’t just appearing there to mark what will become of me, it is what I become. I become that intelligence, a being of sheer indomitable will, the ability to control and kill whenever and however I please. My people, lords one and all, spoke once of ascending beyond all demand for physical presence in the universe, they wished to bring about the end of linear time and become free of cause and effect. What if I achieve it? My god Rogue...what if that is my calling? It was said I would have many names before the end...beast, storm, Valeyard...and now...Intelligence”
Rogue walked up to The Doctor and gently placed his hand on his.
“You have an illness; your friend sounds like a good reliever of it”
“Some illnesses you can’t cure” The Doctor admitted.
“It’s impossible to tow the line between present and future without a little bit of knowledge, but if you know yourself, then you know how to shape that future into something better to come"
““I’m a devil in scarlet and black, what would I know?” The Doctor asked.
Rogue smiled and played another bopping track across the com speakers.
‘’Say you won't leave me no more
I'll take you back again
No more excuses, no, no
'Cause I've heard them all before
A hundred times or more
I'll forgive and forget
If you say you'll never go
'Cause it's true what they say
It's better the devil you know (better the devil)
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)’’
And just like that, The Doctor’s spirits suddenly rose.
