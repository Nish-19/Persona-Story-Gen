Can old wounds heal in the face of shared worry, or will their differences keep them divided?


#### Story ####
Thomas had contemplated the idea of sending a note to Congress to tell them he was ill but decided against it. Jemmy was right, The Assumption Bill debate was too important to skip. He didn’t feel much like debating (or rather arguing) with Hamilton today.
By the time he arrived at Federal Hall, Hamilton was sitting only a few seats away from his own chair. The Treasury Secretary sat with a pensive and melancholic expression. His head rested in his hand as he gazed into a fixed spot in the corner of the room, lost in his own contemplation.
Thomas coughed lightly, avoiding direct eye contact as he greeted, "Secretary Hamilton, good morning." He settled into his regular chair, purposefully averting his gaze from the vacant seat next to him that belonged to Jemmy.
He clasped his hands and furrowed his eyebrows at Hamilton’s distant expression. No doubt the Treasury Secretary had also considered skipping today’s session.
“Secretary Hamilton?” Jefferson called to Hamilton before sitting.
Alexander started and glanced over to him slightly surprised. “Secretary Jefferson.”  he said politely acknowledging him.
The silence was telling as they both couldn’t come to grips with the empty seat between them.
Alexander folded his hands on his own desk and stared ahead. “H-have you seen Jemmy today?”
Thomas nodded silently, “Last night. He was still unconscious.”
“Oh….” Alexander said quietly, looking everywhere but at Thomas.
Now Thomas furrowed his eyebrows at the Treasury Secretary. “Haven’t you gone to see him?”
Alexander sadly shook his head, "Unfortunately, Jemmy...James and I drifted apart as friends a while back, mainly because of our differing views on the South."
Thomas looked at Alexander with concern. “But he’s still your friend, isn’t he?”
Alexander sighed heavily.
“He was, but I fear it may be too late to mend our friendship now. And seeing him in that state, it just brings back memories of what we used to be.” He looked away. “There were days when he was sick, but he still wanted to work.”
“Then if you can’t be friends, at least be there for him.” Thomas said, echoing the words Alexander had said to him on that terrible day. “Maybe it’s not too late for you to patch up your friendship.”
Alexander nodded. “Yeah. I-I’ll do that. Thanks...Thomas.”
I’ll come with you to see Jemmy...if you’d like.” Jefferson remarked.
Alexander looked grateful for the offer and nodded. “I’d appreciate that.”
Had he really taken advice from Thomas Jefferson?

They walked together in silence for a while, Thomas' cane tapping on the pavement as they journeyed to the Madison's residence. The sky above was cloudy and reflected the mood of the two men.
Thomas broke the silence by asking, "How long have you known James?"
Alexander nonchalantly shrugged his shoulders, a wistful smile playing on his lips. "Back in the early days of the republic, we were united by our shared vision at the first Continental Congress. Together, we penned the Federalist Papers along with John Jay. However, when I proposed the Assumption Bill, our paths diverged, and our friendship dissolved.”
Thomas nodded, understanding the weight of their shared history and the complexities that had since pulled them apart. Alexander's words painted a picture of a friendship once strong and unbreakable, now marred by differences in ideology and politics.
Alexander hesitated as they reached the door of the Madison’s residence. They were greeted by Dolley Madison, who wore a sad smile. “Good day, Mr. Jefferson.” Confusion clouded her expression as she glanced over at Alexander. "Mr. Hamilton?"  She ushered them into the foyer.  “I’m glad you’re here. I think Jemmy could do with some company.”
As they followed Dolley into the parlor, Alexander couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia. The room was filled with memories of the time spent here with James, debating ideas, and crafting their arguments for the Federalist Papers.
Thomas glanced over to his fellow secretary and cleared his throat. “Hamilton, why don’t you go see James first? Go...talk to him, so to speak.”
Alexander hesitated, then with a kind nod agree quietly. “Thank you, Mrs. Madison...Mr. Jefferson.”
He glided quietly into the room where James Madison lay in his sickbed. Alexander's mouth was dry, he wondered what to say to his former friend. Would Jemmy even hear him as he was unconscious?
“Hello, James. It’s Alexander.” He sat heavily in the armchair near the bed. Looking to the bedside table, he saw a book and read its spine. It was James' favorite book on Philosophy by John Locke. Alexander’s mouth gaped slightly. Had Jefferson been reading this to James these last two weeks?
Reluctantly, he reached out and gently grasped his friend's wrist, noticing the faint scars left behind by the lightning strike. He took a deep breath and spoke. “James, you’re not allowed to die, do you hear me? You’re- you were my friend. Politics tore our friendship apart and I regret it every day. Even when you side with Jefferson and taunt me. Just-” his words were shaky now. “You have to wake up, Jemmy. Your poor wife is worried, Jefferson is worried. I’m...I’m worried. I don’t want to lose you as a colleague and a f-friend. You’re too brilliant to lose.”
Tears welled up in Alexander’s eyes as he poured out his heart to his unconscious friend. He sat there for what seemed like hours, lost in his thoughts and memories of their happier past meetings. Eventually, he gently squeezed James’ hand and stood up, wiping away his tears.
His words spent, he picked up the book and flipped through the pages. “Shall I read to you?” He took a breath and began to read. “...t
hus we may conceive how words, which were by nature so well adapted to that purpose, came to be made use of by men, as the signs of their ideas.

Four days had passed since he'd seen Jemmy. He had made a point of going over to see him every day to either talk or read to him. On a sunny day, a sudden, urgent knock echoed through the door. Eliza's brow knitted in confusion, for it was a rare occurrence to have Alexander's undivided attention on his day off. Instead of his usual writing, he found solace in watching their children gleefully playing on the floor.
Glancing away from the book in his hands, he let out a small sigh before placing it on the table. "I'll go check who it is, my love. It seems quite urgent."
Eliza frowned. “If it’s a political matter…” she began with a hand on her hip.
Alexander raised a hand as if to shoo away the worry as he went to the door. Opening it, he found Thomas Jefferson, standing on the stoop, who looked in unusual disarray. His hair was even wilder than normal, and the Virginian’s eyes were puffy and bloodshot. Yet, as he glanced at Alexander, a smile spread across his face.  “Alexander, it’s Jemmy. He’s awake.”
Alexander's heart skipped a beat as his eyes widened. "He's awake? Jemmy's alive?" He hesitated for a moment, resisting the urge to embrace his rival.  He called over his shoulder, “Eliza!” Then he returned his attention to the Secretary of State. “How is he? I mean, is he-?”
Thomas’ shoulders rose. “He seems fine? The lightning doesn’t seem to have had any permanent effects.  The doctors are baffled. He’s still going to need some time to recover though.”
Instantly, Eliza appeared with a puzzled expression. ‘What is it Alexander? Why on earth are you yelling so?”
He turned and took her shoulders. “Jemmy’s awake, Eliza! He pulled through!” He exclaimed, kissing her on the cheek. “Honey, I should go see him. I’ll be home later, alright?”
Eliza’s face was one of love. “Of course, sweetheart. Please give my best wishes to Dolley and wish Mr. Madison a speedy recovery for me?” She pecked him on the cheek.
Alexander gave a firm nod and swiftly exited the house, brimming with anticipation to mend his friendship and extend his unwavering support while Jemmy was on the mend.
