#### Writing Prompt ####
Biana has always been overshadowed by her perfect family, her struggles unnoticed and her voice unheard. But when the relentless whispers of self-doubt become too much, she reaches out to the one person who might truly see her—what happens next could change everything.


#### Story ####
Biana came home crying not that anyone would notice. Her father Alden was working with Fitz on something and her mother Della was too busy spying on her father for the Council. No one really cared about Biana. When she came to them they told her to go away. Fitz would call her a crybaby. Alden would pay her no mind. And Della would do the worst. She would chat with Biana but never really listened to her.
She ran up to her room. Another person, another one! Revealed that they only wanted to be friends with Biana because she was related to Fitz.
“I’m not worth anything.” A voice inside her head whispered. “No one would want to be with me.”
Biana pressed her head against her pillow trying to silence the voice.
“I’m not beautiful. I’m a mistake.”
Biana screamed and threw her heels into the wall.
“No matter how hard you try, no one will love you or care for you.” The voice continued to answer. Biana jumped up and ran. She ran outside of the house and ran laps around it. Running had been the only thing that stopped the voices. Leaving her too exhausted to think.
She walked back inside. She went to the pantry and grabbed some Prattles. No one invited her down for dinner as per usual. Biana walked to her room and just munched on Prattles. She set the box down on her nightstand and got started on changing. She threw off her sweaty uniform and pulled on a plain black tunic and her softest gray leggings. She skipped her shower and just got into bed. Tears leaked back down her face. She heard the rest of her family eating dinner and no one remembered the youngest Vacker.
“They will never love you.” The voice crept back in.
Biana woke and groaned. It was Saturday she was stuck in Everglen. She didn’t have any friends besides the ones who just wanted a look at her brother. She pulled on a teal tunic with flower embroidery and kept her gray leggins on. She didn’t bother to do her hair.
“Morning sweetie!” Della sang.
Biana shrugged and made herself a breakfast salad. Fitz walked down and said nothing to Biana. He just grabbed a single piece of fruit then leaped away. Alden came down next but again said nothing to Biana, grabbed a single piece of fruit and went back to his office.
Biana started hearing the voice again, “You’re worthless. You're ugly.” Biana pressed her hands to her ears and dropped the knife she was using to cut the fruit. Della pid it no mind. Biana crouched down and grabbed the knife. She finished making her salad and sat down. Della had already left. She ate alone again.
“No matter what you do you’ll always be worthless.” The voice said.
Biana let herself cry. No one would care, they never did.
She put her dish in the sink and went to her favorite spot. She grabbed her book and her running shoes and went to a blooming purple tree. She sat beneath it and started to read. When the voice stirred she pulled on her shoes and ran. She ran a total of 30 laps that day trying to avoid the voice it still crept in.
“Why hide it when you know you're a mistake?” The voice whispered. She ran inside, grabbed some mallowmelt and ran to her room. She ate slowly at the slices, tears streaming down her face. The voice was relentless. When she finished her last slice she ripped off her tunic and leggings and turned on the shower. She looked into the mirror as the water heated up. The girl looking back at her had tear stained cheeks, her teal eyes looked slightly bloodshot. Her dark bags under her eyes could rival Edaline’s. And her chocolate brown hair was tangled. She stepped under the colorful spray of water and tried so hard to think good things about herself but the voice always won.
Biana got into bed once she was done with her shower and layed down. The glittering stars hanging from her canopy glittered a teal light. It was supposed to be calming but it just reminded her about her ‘perfect’ family and unrealistic expectations.
“You're worthless. You're a mistake. No one will love you!” The voice shouted.
Biana jumped out of bed ready to run again but instead she walked over to her desk and grabbed her imparter. She let out a shaky breath and hailed Elwin.
“Hi Biana.” He said, “What did you need?”
Biana’s tears spilled over as she told him about the voice and how neglected she’d been feeling,
“Have you told your parents?” He asked, turning away to wipe his own tears.
“I’ve tried.. . but Della doesn’t listen and Alsen and Fitz don’t talk to me.” She said as tears doubled over.
“Leap to Foxfire now.” Elwin said before he turned off the imparter.
Biana walked to the Leapmaster, 10,000, shouted, “Foxfire!” Then walked onto campus grounds. Elwin was waiting in the healing center.
“Elwin.” She said.
“Ah, Biana, come here.” Elwin replied.
Biana did so.
“What you told me matches with symptoms of severe depression so I whipped up something that should help a little.” He said as he placed a small container into Biana’s hand.
Biana’s voice failed so she walked over and wrapped Elwin in a hug.
“T.. . . Thank you.” She managed to get out.
Elwin hugged back and said it was nothing. But he didn’t know how much it meant to Biana. She had been neglected and alone for most of her life and the fact that someone cared was something huge.
