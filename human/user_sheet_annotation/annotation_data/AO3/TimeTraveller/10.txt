#### Story ####
-8-
Peter Parker was both in awe and yet despair. Thanks to a friend, Dr Curtis Connor, whom he had met because he was connected to his father, Richard Parker, Peter had recently gotten a job under Dr Otto Octavius, one of the greatest scientific minds of the 21st century. The man was a genius in what seemed every single field of science.
It was not long before Peter was overawed; he had always prided himself on his own knowledge, but that mostly came because he wasn't entirely sure why his parents had left him years ago, but he was positive that they had left because he was not good enough, and so he had worked hard, studied hard, and sacrificed so much just to be the best.
Octavius had surprised him; when Peter had gotten the job, in his less enthusiastic moments he had wondered what it would be like working for the man, and he had pessimistically wondered if Octavius would simply have him clean up and get him and the other assistants coffees or something mundane like that, but it hadn't happened like that. Octavius had instead taken Peter and the others under his wing, and when Peter had met them, he knew they would not get along with the likes of Flash Thompson. All of them were like him in so many ways; socially inept and awkward, preferring books and computers to socialising, loved sci-fi movies, and found it hard to meet others to understand them.
Thanks to various science journals and articles, and documentaries on the internet, Peter had seen clips showing particle accelerators, labs aimed at piercing the mysteries of the universe and NASA's laboratories, but Octavius's laboratory was filled, seemingly, with computers and technology he had never dreamt of.
But he was despairing because he had yet to try to make a move towards Mary Jane Watson, and to be honest he doubted he could ever make the beautiful redhead girl like him. But the miracle was there were other girls here, and he had found he had more in common with them than he ever did with Mary Jane.
One of the girls was a blonde girl called Gwen Stacy; she was beautiful and despite being socially awkward, she had a sense of fashion that was both simple and elegant.
In the meantime, he was focusing on his job. Octavius was both a boss and a teacher, and he set tasks for advancing human science for all of the apprentices he had gathered.
But while he was awed by the technologies and the fact he was making his own future while kids like Harry had it handed over to him on a plate, and Flash and others like him were given scholarships for things as mundane as sports, Peter was left wondering if his personal life would be better, this job was helping pay many of the bills which was a relief.
"Be careful there, Peter," a soft voice spoke, and Peter nearly jumped when he realised Dr Octavius was right behind him, he turned on his seat and saw him there. "I want that formula to be stable, not too explosive."
Peter turned and to his horror and embarrassment he realised Octavius was right, he had been concentrating so hard on worrying about his woes that he had half forgotten what he was meant to be doing. "I'm sorry, Doctor," he hastily corrected the formula, double-checking it to make sure it wasn't too dangerous.
Octavius frowned as if Peter was a complex puzzle. "Come with me, Peter, I want to talk to you," he said and while Peter hid his embarrassment and trepidation, he dutifully followed. When they were in Octavius's office, the scientist came out with it.
"I'm not angry with you, Peter, nor Curt. You're a damn good scientist with an impressive scientific mind. But you remind me of myself, do you know why?"
Realising it wasn't a rhetorical question, Peter quickly shook his head, "No."
"I was abused as a child, Peter. My father was a hard man who didn't care about me, my education, or my interests unlike my mother," Octavius made a face as he thought about his father, "and more than once I would get distracted in my work until someone shook me out of it. And before you say a word, I know you're not abused, but I think you are being bullied, yes?"
Peter was stunned that this genius, this titan of science, was able to read him so well when so many failed.
Fortunately, Octavius didn't expect an answer to such a sensitive question. He leaned forward, "Peter, you have something special within yourself. You have a brain, and I want to see it well used and I want to see you do well. Forget the people who tormented you. I forgot my father, and yet he has not even changed. I haven't looked back on him once, but I make sure my mother and sisters receive a good income. Focus on what's important to you, don't worry about anything else. Do you understand what I mean?"
Peter replayed the other man's advice, and he had to admit he liked what he was hearing.
Dr Octavius was right, why should he care what happened to Flash and the others? Okay, so he wanted to date Mary Jane, but was she truly attainable, or was he wasting his time there?
