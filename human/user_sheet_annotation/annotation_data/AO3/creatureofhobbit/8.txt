After stepping away from the throne and choosing love over duty, a young former Crown Prince faces an uncertain future—what does life look like when the path ahead is no longer set in stone?


#### Story ####
It’s the first time in a long time that Wilhelm has no clue what’s around the corner for him. For most of his life, he’d expected to be a working royal, technically Erik’s heir until such time as Erik had children of his own, so unlikely to ever have to actually take the throne. Then when Erik died, Wilhelm had known that his destiny lay somewhere else entirely, that he was to take the throne in Erik’s place. Now he’s made the choice to be honest with his family, to say that he doesn’t want to be Crown Prince any more, that he’s chosen Simon, he no longer knows what lies in store.
He doesn’t know where he’s going to be going to school for the next academic year; while he knows that Hillerska’s closure is being appealed, he’s not sure how successful that’s going to be. Yes, everyone involved in the initiation will have gone, yes, the school will be under new management, but will that be enough for the appeal to be successful? Wilhelm knows that if the attempt to appeal the closure does fail, his parents could always choose to send him back to his old school from before he started Hillerska, or find somewhere else altogether, but he’s not sure whether he would want that now, to be at a school without Simon, Felice and Sara.
August’s called, thanking Wilhelm for speaking to his parents about making him the heir to the Swedish throne. Wilhelm’s not sure how their relationship will be in the future; although they are family, until recently they had never been friends, and there’s still enough water under the bridge that he’s not sure how easy it will be for them ever to really be close. At one point, he hadn’t thought he could forgive August for the sex tape, and more recently August’s shattering of Wilhelm’s illusions about Erik by revealing Erik’s role in the initiation had driven a wedge between them; yet a part of Wilhelm actually thinks he wouldn’t mind now talking about Erik with August, since August had reassured Wilhelm that Erik would have loved him. They’ll still see each other again as cousins; after all this time of disliking August, Wilhelm considers the idea that they could become something closer to friends.
Wilhelm’s never thought about the idea of a career. Why would he? Until now, he’d never expected to have any choice in the matter; whether as Crown Prince or another working royal, heir to Erik, the choice had already been set in stone for Wilhelm. For Simon and Sara and Felice, Rosh and Ayub, even August’s friends, futures not fixed in the same way, they had always expected to have some kind of career; Wilhelm knew Simon had wanted a career in music, although he had never been sure that it would actually happen. If he’s honest with himself, he has to admit that he’ll never truly leave the public eye; even though he has taken the step back from the throne, he’s still well enough known that he’ll always be recognised as a member of the royal family, never able to blend into the background and live a truly normal life in the way that his friends can. Will anyone even take him seriously when he does apply for a job, or will they decide that the downsides of the media attention outweigh the benefits of hiring him, or think he’s just playing at being a regular person before going back to the Bank of Mama and Papa, back to the royal family? They would have no worries on that score; Wilhelm knows he doesn’t want to go back to that life, was never really happy even as he went through the motions of the public appearances. And once the news is officially out there that he has abdicated as Crown Prince, Wilhelm knows that in the short term at least, he’ll be getting lots of media attention as Sweden processes the news (he’s already thought that he’d better suggest to Simon that he avoids looking at social media for at least the first few weeks, to avoid the comments from idiots.) Although August did say when they spoke that hopefully, as new Crown Prince, he’ll be able to turn at least some of the media focus to himself, take it off Wilhelm and Simon.
But a lot of this is either out of his hands anyway (the future of the school), or things that Wilhelm can take time to make a decision about rather than having to commit to anything straight away (any future career); Wilhelm doesn’t know what the future holds for him, but maybe right now he doesn’t need to. He can enjoy this summer with his friends, with Simon.
