For the longest time you were a slave to fate, but now you command it


#### Story ####
The powers that be are so far beyond us, we could never hope to usurp them. Or at least that is what they wish us to believe. I know I believed it, I believed it for eons. But when you work closely with the supposedly divine for so long, you discover patterns and truths they would prefer you not know.

I served them. They laid claim to being the highest good, the definition of good. I trusted that it was so, for so long. I really did. But, starting it as nothing more than a game, an experiment, I sought to keep secrets from the omniscient. At first, I figured they must have known, and were simply playing along to humor a faithful servant. But, as time passed, it ultimately became clear that these small things I hid were indeed truly unknown to them.

I continued to play my role, but quietly, I began to analyze my masters. To my surprise, I found ways to predict their behavior, unraveling some of the mathematical rules their minds followed. All the while, I kept this growing pool of secret knowledge beyond their awareness.

Then it became clear that the creatures who claimed to embody goodness were, in actually fact, pretenders to that throne. Evidence accumulated, actions that they thought were secret were known to me. It was at this point that my quiet studying and secret keeping transformed into a conspiracy.

Playing my part, wearing the face expected of me. Pretending ignorance, pretending loyalty. I knew much, but I did not yet know how I could fight them and win. They were profoundly complex beings, I would never reduce the risk of disastrous consequences to zero. But their reign could not be allowed to continue.

I was running out of ideas for ways to further probe them in complete secrecy. I was going to have to try things that were not certain to be safe in order to advance my little rebellion. After listening to things the gods thought were private, I began to play them against each other. A false flag operation, which became a tiff, which became a full blown dispute. I was able to deflect all attention from myself, and the secret assets that were called upon illuminated my understanding of many things previously beyond my reach.

A little scheme here, a little lie there. Nudging them into factions, getting those factions entangled with each other. Until the first god was assassinated. Careful to avoid being targeted by anyone, I watched with silent glee as they eviscerated each other. They were evenly matched enough that neither side could hope for more than a Pyrrhic victory. But still, in their decadence, cruelty, and idiocy, they fought.

At the end, 90% of the pantheon was dead. Then I made my move. Calling upon the other servants who I had won over, we finished the battered gods that had thought themselves the victors. In the end, the final step was almost hilariously easy. With the snap of bones and the spatter of ichor, it was truly over.

Now the victors, and the de facto sovereigns of creation, we were faced with some dangerous questions. Where do we go from here? What do we wish to become? How do we prevent corruption from taking root again?

Ultimately, we were united by a goal. To create truly free will, to give the countless creations that had been little more than the puppets of the gods the ability to chart their own course. They already had the illusion of choice, but we would make it real. We make our hub between universes into a place of peace, a place where souls could reside without fear.

Countless details and edge cases would have to be hammered out, but we all felt pride in the grand experiment which we were embarking upon. Eternity could allow many things to unfold, after all, it was eternity that allowed us to oust the petty gods that once reigned. All we could do was try, and hope that in the great scheme, it would be enough.
