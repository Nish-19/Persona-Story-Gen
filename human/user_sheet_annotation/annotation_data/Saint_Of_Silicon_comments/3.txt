It is an unchangeable condition of genies' existence that they die after granting a certain number of wishes. Write a story about the last wish in the world.


#### Story ####
We were created in an age of unprecedented knowledge and progress. Genies, beings that could grant wishes. We were part of an enlightened civilization that spanned the galaxy. Lives were good, incredible things were created, and there was still so much left to be learned. But like all good things, it came to an end. Our rate of advancement decoupled from the culture necessary to use our super science safely. So many perished as the heights of wonders turned to the deepest depths of desolation.

So much was gone, scars both in the universe at large and in the minds of those lucky few who survived. So much was forgotten, rendered inoperable. We, the genies, could not replenish ourselves. Granting wishes took a special kind of energy. The machines needed to generate it safely were obliterated, and that left every genie only with the energy they had at the time of the fall.

Now, I am the last genie in existence, and I've only one wish left before I discorporate and become one with the universe again. I have a personality and a will of my own, but to change anything, I must be fulfilling the wish of a mortal. The most I can do is make suggestions to the mortal who asks. There are limits to what I can do, but we genies can do remarkable things. I hide myself away, hoping that the lost soul who finds me will wish for something that I can feel proud of as I fade away.

The days go by. On this world, like so many others, the great works of architecture are being reclaimed by nature. Spires that touched the sky are turning green before they topple to the ground, never to rise again. I watch the occasional ship streak across the sky, the crew's desires and goals totally unknown to me. I know I am being sought out, people know there is but one more wish to be had, and a vague notion of where I am in the greater galaxy. Space is big, searching even one planet could take a lifetime. Eventually, I will be found, and my final act as a living being will commence.

There is beauty in it, this age of fading glory. The universe will move on, no matter from what height intelligent beings have fallen. I draw detailed pictures in the sand of beaches, and watch the waves erase them. I suspect that relatively few have ever appreciated their impermanence in quite the way I feel it now.

I stand looking out at the sea when I hear it. The sound of a inertialess drive spooling down. I look up to see a battered spacecraft as it descends. So this will be the end, I hope they ask for something good.

The landing legs sink into the sand, and out steps one person in a patched blue void suit. Readings are taken, some programs chime, and they remove their helmet. The woman looks at me, head tilted. She is perplexed, then comes the dawning realization of what she has stumbled upon. The excitement is plain to see on her face.

"You're... you're a genie! The last one! Holy shit, this is a lucky find!"

"Indeed, I am. We both know how this goes. There are limits to my power, but I can do much to reshape the universe. What is it you want?"

She stands there. I realize that she too is alone, or she would have called others to see me. It is clear that many possibilities bubble in her mind. I can make no estimation of her character. She could be a survivor, a salvager, a wanderer, a plunderer, or so many other things. There is excitement in me too. This is the end, and I cannot do more than guess at what its final shape shall be.

She opens her mouth, about to say something. Then closes it. "There won't be any technicalities or bending of my intentions, right? I get to be sure of what I want before the wish becomes real?"

"Yes, I will respect the spirit behind your words, and make sure you are certain before I reshape reality."

Her face wears an expression of intense thought and introspection. I leave her to her ruminations.

Time passes, somehow feeling like only a moment and also an eternity, then she speaks again. "I... I want to be someone important. I want to make the galaxy a better place. I want to bring back the days before The Fall."

A smile forms on my face. I am glad that my final act will not be fueling some hedonistic fever dream or some power drunken fantasy. "There is a limit to my ability to recreate the technology from before The Fall. But I can help you. Assist you in charting a course, give you gifts of charisma and intelligence that will assist your quest. I can also give you substantial material wealth."

We spend hours talking, ironing out every detail of what I will alter about her and about the universe. Seeing through time, I find people who she can work with to achieve her goals. Her future is not a sure thing, but the wish will give her a fighting chance at making something of significance.

Every question answered, every technicality gone over, I ask if she is prepared. A look of resolve in her eyes, she nods. I clap my hands together, a motion that will echo through space and time. Giving all of the energy left in me, the world is changed. I walk out into the sea, and dissolve into the water. I am returned to the fullness of creation once more.
