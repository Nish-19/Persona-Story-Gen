#### Story ####
**Prologue** The Citadel Tower was still in the midst of its repairs when the SPECTRE candidates were summoned to the councils private chambers. Keepers continued to flit between the panels on the walls, to maintain air pressure, humidity and a variety of other atmospheric variables, to the many areas that were still under active construction. Crews from all across the galactic community were converging on the Citadel in a show of galactic togetherness and workmanship. The Citadel may have been moved to Earth during the desperate final fight between the Reapers and the galactic alliance but it was now restored to its rightful place in Widow and everyone who had benefitted from the end of the Reaper purge, nearly everyone, was happy to assist in the Citadels restoration. It had been forty-five years since the last known sighting of Commander Shepard, she had vanished through the Beta relay with a stern warning of Do Not Follow before she obliterated the relay with a charge. Many myths and legends had circulated the galactic community whilst the rebuilding continued over the next forty years. Had she been corrupted by the power of the Reapers? Was she sealing them out a last resort to stop them returning? Was she merely building power, hidden behind the destroyed relay? No one dared venture near to her vanishing point, especially at this time of turmoil. The rebuilding phase may have been a galactic, communal effort on the Citadel but all of the home systems in the galaxy were left to fend for themselves. It had been a long, and hard, struggle to establish authority even in their own systems for the Galactic Council members. Fighting the twin snakes of piracy and autonomy that the Reaper invasion had spread had been an almost impossible task, considering the many systems and colonies of the galaxy. The non-council members faced worse isolation, the Quarians, Geth, Hanar, Drell, Krogan and Batarians were in an odd situation of stasis. Their home worlds were safe but the vast voids between them and the Citadel were still harbouring the many remaining threats to Galactic Security. Galactic Council Space was only a tenth of its pre-Reaper size and the Citadel Council fleet was at less than twenty-five percent of full strength. It was these stark facts, and the fact that the Galactic Council was now realising that that the monopoly of the Big Four was quickly eroding, that forced the Galactic Council to act. The SPECTRE program, the elite espionage and tactical arm of the Citadel, was opened to all races to allow feelings of galactic togetherness to flourish. The new SPECTRE program had been running for the past twenty years, with experienced tutors from all races encouraging a new breed of SPECTRE to combat the piracy and uncontrolled madness that the rebellious sectors bred. One month ago, the Galactic Council summoned some of the best and brightest prospects within the organisation to a special dinner at the Citadel Tower. The four heads of the Galactic Council were assembled at the top table; the room was bustling with high level diplomats, soldiers, tutors and reporters. The announcement would be made soon but, for now, all you have to do is mingle
