#### Story ####
The Boundary is not an aesthetic structure. It's ugly, made of dull concrete that rises forty feet. It is topped with rolls of razor wire. It wasn't made to be an elegant piece of architecture. It was made to keep the House Wars within House territory, and for that purpose it suffices. The north gate is the most popular transit route between the city and House territory. Despite this fact, it's still heavily fortified. It's manned at all hours by security teams of tenfive men on the House side, five men on the other. Travel through this gate is heartily discouraged by city officials, particularly where civilians are concerned. However, it is still permitted; it is not the duty of the guards to protect individuals from their own stupidity. Supplies are routinely trucked through the north gate. People who dwell in House territorymainly members of the Houses themselvesoften conduct business in the city. There are no real services in House territory save that of the makeshift medical and cybernetics clinics that are strewn throughout. For every other service, the Houses must venture beyond the Boundary. People often gather at the north gate. Tourists flock to it, hoping to catch a glimpse of House activity. Aquarius' news channels station reporters are there often when they catch wind of a skirmish brewing. And then there are the travellers, those willing to pass through the gate into streets left damaged and abandoned by the intensity of the House Wars. These travellers are sometimes just thrill seekers. Some are members of the city's military. Some have legitimate business with the Houses. Some are attending to business that is not in any way legitimate. It is a busy evening now at the north gate. There is a steady stream of vehicles and pedestrians passing through. Sergeant Marek How, officer in charge of the current guard team, is busy checking the papers of a moving van driven by woman whose facial implants give her a decidedly villainous feel. He is used to the sounds of a transient population, motors and horns and the vocal complaints of drivers. What he hears now is different from all of those. It is the high pitched whine of moving machinery, and it is approaching the gate from the House side. Sergeant How instantly has a bad feeling. He turns to stare through the gate, at the line of traffic hoping to exit into the city. The sound is louder now. He ducks his head to speak into the radio attached to his collar, "Narris, what the hell is that noi" The last part of his question is drowned out by the sound of gun fire. There is a simultaneous explosion on the other side of the gate. Immediately the sounds of chaos ensue. Drivers on the city side struggle to get out of the gridlock they're encased in. Drivers on the House side are trying to surge forward, through the barricade. And beyond them Sergeant How sees fire and smoke. *What the fuck?* He thinks, backing away, waving to the other guards on his side of the gate. There is no hope of controlling traffic now; all they can do is get themselves out of the way until law enforcement arrives. He steps off the road, narrowly avoiding being struck by a speeding van that has broken through the barricade. He yells a question into his radio and his met by static. The sounds of destruction are much closer now. And then he sees it, the cause of all this. He watches wide-eyed as it wheels into view, crushing vehicles in its path. It is larger than most any other vehicle he has seen. It rolls on three huge wheels with monstrous treads. Through the haze of smoke and fire, Sergeant How sees that it is oddly shaped, sleekly curved and made of pale grey metal. As it passes him he hears the smooth whisper of the wheels, accompanied by the mechanic whine he heard earlier. He also sees something that worries him. He sees the emblem of the House of Kyle painted on its side. He knows instantly what it is. It halts on the city side of the gate. It begins to change shape. The axles are shifting, the wheels rising into the air, and it steadies itself on a tripod of metal appendages. Its round shape splits apart with the sound of hydraulics and the same high whine. It begins to look vaguely man shaped. The small, round nob that has appeared like a head has one glowing blue band across its surfacea sensor strip. More metal appendages are unfolding from within it with an odd grace, and Sergeant How sees that they are not arms. They are massive cannons. Over the radio, the men under his control are screaming questions at him. He fumbles for his radio and gives his answer. "It's a war machine." Everyone has heard about UA's newest military prototype. Nobody to date has seen one, not even the most persistent outlets of the city's media. But the prototype is what is before him now, swivelling on its stand, locating targets and preparing to fire. Sergeant How is no longer thinking about damage control. He is thinking, as the prototype begins to fire weapons that are clearly energy based, that he is not paid nearly enough to deal with shit like this. He is thinking that when all this is over and the dead are being tallied, that UA will deny having sold the prototype to the House of Kyleno, instead, UA will claim it was stolen. The House of Kyle will deny ownership, even though it bears the Kyle emblem. There will be no way for authorities to prove that this attack was intentional, no paper trail, no money to follow. And worst of all, Sergeant How is thinking that the slaughter that is commencing is no accident. It is a trial. The prototype is test firing. The sergeant is now thinking that he needs to get his ass across the street, to the armored barracks where he and his men are stationed when not on duty at the gate. He is thinking that if they were smart, everyone else out in the open would be headed there too. That is the last thought he has. Seconds later he is dead, caught in one of the first shots fired by the UA prototype war machine. It's up to everyone else here to survive.
