#### Writing Prompt ####
As the crew of the SF Spectrum awakens from cryogenic sleep, they prepare to dock with Starbase 4012-B, a self-sustaining city in space that has been mysteriously silent for three monthsâ€”what secrets await them in the void?


#### Story ####
The SF Spectrum continued to scythe silently through the vast chasm of space on its constant bearing. The Miami class frigate was near the pinnacle of Sol Federation technology and was pride of place amongst the new wave of ships being sent further and further into unknown space. Starbase 4012-B was on the outermost cusp of federation space, the first of its kind in self-sustainable, long-term habitable space stations that the federation hoped would become the standard for galactic expansion. Until humanity cracked the code that allowed for faster than light travel, cryogenics and self-sustainable vessels were the only options to conquer the titanic distances of the void. The SF Spectrum was a relatively small vessel by tonnage comprising of the main crew deck, a small medical and research lab, command section and hull. The hull was currently filled with a wide variety of Sol Federation standard replacement parts and numerous crates of supplies. The SF Spectrum continued on its set course due to the careful diligence of the ships artificial intelligence, codenamed Kelvin, who had ensured the ships safe passage next to the Ghaziabad neutron star. The electrically blue and white star bathed the ship in brilliant light and danced off the many metallic panels on the outer hull of the SF Spectrum. The missions goal, Starbase 4012-B, was currently seventy-two hours away so, as per protocol, Kelvin began the process of awakening the crew. Within the white and blue cyrochamber, the silence was broken by a loud metallic hiss as the various chemicals and nutrients flooded the cyrotubes to awaken the crew. The small, white tiled room adjoined the medical labs and was dominated by the six cylindrical tubes that housed the crew in stasis. Seventy-two hours had been allocated by the Sol Federation to allow the crew to re-acclimatise to the Spectrum and reassess changes to mission parameters since they entered into stasis two months earlier. Starbase 4012-B was a fully functioning city in space essentially, complete with water reclamation, botanic gardens, self-sustaining economic and industrial bases to allow a population of nearly three thousand to easily survive so far away from the comfort of Earth. It was also designed to be used as a staging centre for further colonial ventures to nearby terran-friendly planets in the sector. Starbase 4012-B, like all Sol Federation starbases, followed a strict code of law despite being entirely self-sufficient. In an era of unknowns, especially the eternal fear of extra-terrestrial contact, each starbase was required to send a broadcast back to Gaia with the latest updates and situational reports. Starbase 4012-B had now been silent for three months and tensions were fraying within federation command, no-one knew or wanted to guess what could have happened this far away from the centre of humanity. Starbase 4012-B had been a hot bed of scientific and political gossip since its establishment. Multiple reports had been filed acknowledging several habitable planets within its sensor range and that early mining expeditions to the numerous asteroids and gas giants had found bountiful supplies for future expansion. It was a vital asset and the crew, now dozily awakening from cryogenic slumber, had been assembled from the best in the federation. Each was uniquely suited to their role on-board and, despite only having a brief introductory meeting and mission overview before cryogenic sleep, knew each other on reputation alone. The white and aluminium cryogenic pods slowly ascended into a vertical position on the wall, essential to save space on the ship, and icy fog cascaded out of the seam around the glass observational port. The glass and aluminium panel slid up and each of the crew stepped nervously out onto the grated floor, clothed only in a modesty-saving medical gown. In the main crew hall, which was dominated by a computer console in a pentagonal shape covered in dials and screens, a stack of the latest updates and reports from the Sol Federation were stacked neatly. Good Afternoon, a polite British accent filled the air, it had been decided by Sol Federation regulations that British was the politest announcing voice, Crew of the Spectrum, it currently sixteen forty-five galactic standard time. We are on track and on course for docking with Starbase 4012-B in seventy one hours and forty minutes. All correspondence from the Sol Federation is prepared in the crew hall, are there any ill effects from the cryogenics?
