Decades after Skull Island was abandoned and left to legend, a new expedition sets out to rediscover its secretsâ€”but as the island looms on the horizon, the crew begins to wonder if some mysteries are better left buried.


#### Story ####
In 1933, Carl Denham shocked the world when he unveiled King Kong to a stunned crowd at the Alhambra Theatre The twenty-five-foot tall ape delivered the scientific community a one-two punch that sent it reeling with the impact of this incredible discovery and subsequent tragic loss. But Kong was just the beginning. An entire island, bursting with prehistoric wonders, existed. If Kong had shocked the scientific world, Skull Islands emergence fro m the shroud of legend into reality shocked it to its core. Not since Columbus's discovery of the New World had mankind been offered such an opportunity to explore a land trapped in time. Kong's chest beating roar at the summit of the Empire State Building heralded the greatest discovery of the century-arguably the millennium. In the wake of the islands unveiling, universities and private organizations across the planet fumbled to dispatch teams to investigate and catalogue its wonders. The race of the century was on. Rival expeditions fought for exclusivity and justification, each asserting its own legal standing to be first on the island. Only a handful of the two dozen expeditions successfully made landfall and-of those-half were woefully unprepared for the terrors that awaited them. Skull Island ate expeditions with all the appetite of the full grown *V.Rexes*that ruled the landmass in Kong's absence. After a year of disastrous excursions and tragic loss of life, a properly prepared, jointly managed and financed effort was finally organized by the three biggest interested concerns. Lead by Carl Denham himself(just off several dozen lawsuits for damages and needing the money), this three month expedition set out to systemically explore and document the island. *Project Legacy*-as it was called, suffered its own set of mishaps and attrition, but it was a far cry from the earlier ill-founded attempts. The most important realization of this 1935 trip was that Skull Island was too new, too strange and, above all, too dangerous to study in such a short space of time.With countless discovery of new species and new behaviours every day, it became clear that decades of study *might*scrape the surface of what the island may have hidden from the world for so long. *Project Legacy*was expanded to a long-term study, with annual expeditions, the long term goal of which was to establish a permanent base of operations on the Island. It was during the second incursion in 1936 that the truth of Skull Island's geological fragility became clear. A huge earthquake sank one part of the island, killing five team members. After careful exploration by a team of geologists, the expedition realized that Skull Island was a doomed oddity, a scab on the earth's crust that would eventually be scratched off. All plans to make a permanent base on the island were halted and, in 1941, as the US finally joined the cause in World War 2, Skull Island and any plans towards discovery of all it had to offer was forgotten. *************************************** Elizabeth, Oliver: A group of five, scientists, doctors and the like stood around the table where the map lay. Captain Daniel Colton stood on the other side of the table, arms across his chest as he regarded them, dark eyes focused on them under the brim of his cap. "Almost three months we've been travelling. Are you sure those coordinates are right?" Everett Hunter, the head of the operation, nodded. "Denham said its not the original, but he read the original so many times that it burned into his brain. He remembered." "Why so jumpy?" Weston Marks, a cryptozoologist, asked. "My men are going to be helping you. Weapons, food, all being provided for. Are you going to be able to pay the rest of the money at the end?" "Afraid of losing your investment?"Everett said, only half joking. Colton shrugged. "If you're eaten in the jungle, it makes little difference to me. However, I am providing manpower to aid you and keep you alive. If THEY die as well, it'll be a real thorn in my side." *************************************** Amie: "Miss Winthorpe? Miss WINTHORPE?!" Amie raised her head from where she stood by the railing, wondering if she looked as green as she felt, wiping her mouth. Liam, one of the younger sailors, was looking at her with some concern. "You don't look so good Miss Winthorpe." He said, pushing his cap back on his head. He had an accent that she recognized as Dublin by the lilt in it. "I'm fine. The cooks food doesn't...oof....doesn't really sit right." She said, managing a little smile. Barely. But it was more than that. Months on this tramp steamer that should have been decommissioned a decade ago and sometimes the vestiges of seasickness rose up. And the food....while every fortnight she could get something that seemed halfway edible, the rest of the time they ate what they had. A week ago, she had some Cherry Blossom meat which, she realized too late, was raw horse. The most recent was tuna eyeballs in porridge. But things were tough all over and she shouldn't complain. This year, rationing had gone into effect for several foods and canned meat, butter and the like had been added to the list. Still, she had made sure everything she ate was at least warm enough to burn, hoping it would kill any pathogens. Not that it did her stomach any good. *This is your own fault.* She reproached herself for the fiftieth time that day. *One word. You only had to remember one damn word.* Nolan Strauss, the Editor-In-Chief of the *New York Times*had told her to get onto the ship, the *Atlas*. While she had her doubts when she had first boarded, she had figured he had a very good reason for sending her here. She had figured it was something connected to the army base article she was supposed to cover. Instead, she had discovered a few days into the journey where they were going. A straight shot West of Sumatra, far away from anything connected to the war or any interest pieces. The Captain, a handsome middle aged man named Colton, while sympathetic to her plight, assured her that accommodations would be provided to her and she had been given a cabin. However, heading back or diverting was out of the question, would put the Expedition to the Island back a few weeks, something that he couldn't allow. He promised that if they encountered another ship, he would allow her to get off his own and go with the other to its final destination. They had encountered no other ships. Of course not. What kind of ship used steam nowadays? Hadn't most ships switched to fuel? "Here, come on." Liam said, leading her across the deck by the arm. Passing an old seaplane (which was set for emergency search and rescue)to just outside the galley, returning with some small crackers. "Old trick. Just nibble some of these." The crackers tasted a little stale, but they tasted far better than the food she was used to. "So, you've been here for a while. What do you think of the ship?" Liam smiled. "And what are you going to do when we get...there?" He added. She didn't need to ask where "there"was. *************************************** Harold: Harold woke to the feeling of hard stone under his face and soaked clothes, the scent of seawater in his nostrils. Pushing his face from the stone, he felt himself looking into a screaming face. Had he been a child and not a veteran of a war, he would have jumped, startled. But he faced the silent face, the ancient carving of some civilization or another jutting out of the sea. Looking about, he saw what he had feared since he had awoken. His ship, smashed to kindling on the rocks. After the fog had rolled in and the storm had blown them off course, he had feared as much. But something niggled at him as he rose to his feet. Oscar. Where was he? Gauging by what he could see, it had been a while since he had been knocked out. Surely Oscar, if he had been dead, would have washed up too? Unless he had washed up elsewhere.This ancient spar of rocky cove was the only place that someone could safely climb ashore. There, ahead. He could see a pathway up the rocks, along a crumbled causeway. Skull Island awaited.
