#### Story ####
#The Curious Cases of Sigma19 ###It was late 3038. The Earth Empire had crumbled as a cohesive political force. In its wake came a certain freedom. But also uncertainty. Earths contribution to the Galactic community was not as fantastic as they sometimes allowed themselves to believe. Human sneakiness sometimes gave them an edge over the wisdom or inventiveness of other species, and allowed them to circumnavigate the will of brute aggression. But of course that by no means meant that everything they did with their influence was uncompromisingly beneficial. Quite possibly why their Empire eventually fell. --- --- The Galactic Federation rose from the ashes of the Earth Empire as a way for the peoples of the Galaxy to support one another in their mutual interests, and deter aggressors. This brought new opportunities. Opportunities to tackle old problems. And even the opportunity to profit from facilitating the actions which were agreed upon. One thing looked certain. In some form or another, the Galactic Federation would form its own space navy. Andertenna was keen to lend its shipyards to the task. Ice Warriors and others were lined up to provide troops or training. And the Sigma system, lead by **Sigma19**, was anxious to provide a generous and affordable finance package. Of course each planet would have to play its part, putting up some of the wealth; but Sigma19 would underwrite the undertaking, and provide the initial cash flow; and provide certain guarantees and security to ensure the project would not flounder and nor would any individual planet find themselves in difficulty. A generous package indeed it was - but one surely they would also benefit from. Quite how was unclear. However, that was not the primary concern of our heroes. Prior to the Conference which had lead to the Galactic Navy being mooted, strange deaths had been reported on Sigma19. Reported and covered by one **James Carver** - acclaimed journalist. Unexplained deaths. Seemingly random. Cause unidentified. That much was fairly common knowledge in these parts. What was less well known is that around that time, little red flowers had been very popular. And James friends rather suspected these were related to the deaths. Indeed, they had seen the same flowers around when they had investigated deaths at the Galactic Federation conference. Now **K9** had recovered his stewardship of his TARDIS. He was relieved. For some time, Mr Wolf - a strange, unpredictable AI construct - had rather dominated the consol. He brought **James** and **Tatti** back to Sigma19. James was interested in following up on his former girlfriend, who seemed to have got involved with a criminal gang. Involved, in the sense that she had become its leader. Tatti was interested in following up on the strange deaths they had noted before. And they were all interested in ensuring the danger-hogs they had seen off previously were gone and had not caused any lasting damage. They were also curious to look into the activities of the current President, who was up for election, and seemed to be rather embroiled in intergalactic intrigue - if not directly involved in the said deaths. --- **Cass Willams** meanwhile was visiting Sigma19 for not entirely unrelated reasons. She followed the work of James Carver - and had been fascinated by what he had to say about the strange deaths on the planet. She had arrived here under her own steam to do her own little bit of detective work - and was delighted to learn that Mr Carver himself was actually here, in town, in person! She made it her business to find out where he was, so that they might compare notes. As she looked around the town, she noticed the particular characteristics of the local architecture. In the case of many buildings, low-cost homes occupied the ground floor. Above these, there was often a shop, or a business of some sort. On top of that was a level for parking. Ramps enabled the local cars to be driven up and parked; then little steps lead between the walkways on each level. Sometimes there was another home or office on the same level as the parking, depending on the size of the block and how much parking was needed. Above the parking layer was a very nice-looking home. Sometimes it was a single story apartment, other times it went up two, or even three levels. And above all of *that* was a fancy roof-garden! It was considered a status symbol to own one of those grand apartments. The rent from the shop and lower cost housing helped pay for the whole block. It gave a new meaning to the phrase property ladder! If one could afford to invest in such a block, although it was an expensive outlay at the start, it was a regular income that paid for itself over time. It *did* mean that shopping was disjointed, with one or two shops in every block. Larger dedicated shopping blocks did exist, but they were frowned upon and seen as common. And the roof gardens were a sight to behold! --- In an opulent anteroom, Kirts sat. He insisted on being called Kirts. No title, no surname or forename. Just Kirts. He was the head of the Sigma19 diplomatic party. He was not happy. Krovon Muruch, the President of Sigma19, was unpredictable. Very difficult to lead a diplomatic mission with such an unpredictable leader. And this, of course, was a lose-lose. If Muruch messed up, that was on Kirts. But if Muruch did well, Kirts could claim no glory. **Jeb Richardson** stood before him. He was a military man, but he seemed to have some spark about him. Im on the security detail for Madiba Mandela, he explained. Oh yes. Madiba Mandela. The enigmatic, calm yet magnetic Earth delegate. A member of *his* party had Kirts respect. Now the conference is over, Richardson went on, I have been commissioned to travel with you, to officially represent Earths diplomatic concern with regards to the creation of the Galactic Navy. This seemed like a good move. Earth was taking Sigma19 seriously enough to send specific staff for the embassy to deal with Sigmas interest in the construction of the fleet. The direct approach indicated good faith. And handed Kirts a golden opportunity to build up a sound rapport. And so it was. Jeb Richardson travelled back to Sigma19, to take a desk at Earths embassy there
