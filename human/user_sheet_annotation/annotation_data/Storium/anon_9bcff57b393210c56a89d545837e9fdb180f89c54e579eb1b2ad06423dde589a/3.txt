#### Writing Prompt ####
Five strangers receive a cryptic wake-up call in their hotel rooms, urging them to find someone named Del Salazar inside a nearby auditorium. The seminar hasn’t started yet, the doors are locked, and none of them know each other—but something about the message feels impossible to ignore.


#### Story ####
Thomas Garland is alone in a room. The lights are off. Yet there is just barely enough light by which he can see, a faint blue glow. He's sitting on a couch, the upholstery frayed, colour faded from black to gray. In front of him is an Ottoman, faux-leather with scratches and tears from years of hard use. On the Ottoman is a small box, dark wood, lacquered with something exquisitely slick. Plain, little more than a cube with a few small spheres for feet. The blue glow comes from a barely visible crack around the top of the box. Thomas Garland is looking at the box, eyes never moving from it. The only other object on the Ottoman is an old cellular phone, the kind that flips. This is Thomas Garland's house, and it is not Thomas Garland's house. This is Thomas Garland. And he is not Thomas Garland. Thomas Garland knows what will be inside the box when he opens it. And he knows what will happen when he opens the box. Worse, he thinks to himself, is that he knows what will happen if he doesn't. For a heartbeat's length there is a figure standing before him, all pale skin and dead, rolling eyes. Thomas Garland blinks, and it is gone. This is Thomas Garland. And Thomas Garland opens the box. --- DeWitt, Midwest United States. DeWitt is an oddity of a town. Small enough that most of the locals know each other, big enough that someone who knows what they're doing can hide. Modern conveniences but a kind of late 70s aesthetic. Just off a few major highways but still not really on the way to anywhere. Nice place. Nice people. It's the kind of place Enzo Ciaretti hates. Enzo Ciaretti is from New York, and frankly, any place with a population density lower than Times Square wigs him out. A childhood among the skyscrapers and smokestacks of midtown New York have given him a touch of agoraphobia, and he can feel the sweat beading on his forehead as he looks out at the unoccupied street ahead of him. It doesn't help that today hasn't been off to a great start. Garland isn't answering his phone, and the seminar is due to begin in less than three hours. Greg went to fish Tom out of his place and drag him over, only Greg hasn't come back yet. And Greg isn't picking up his phone either. To be blunt, Enzo is starting to get nervous. He does his best to swallow it- Greg has handled this sort of situation before, he knows what he's doing. All Enzo has to do is keep people out of the auditorium until an hour before the performance, and check tickets as they come in. He nods, folds his hands behind his back, and takes a long, deep breath. --- This brings us to the five travellers, just checking into their rooms at the Cygnus Hotel in DeWitt. Bags are left on the coarse carpet, beds are tested in the customary ways following a long day of travel. Plastic is removed from bars of hotel soap, complimentary mints are eaten. Each realizes that from their hotel room, they can see the auditorium where Garland's seminar is to take place in a little less than three hours. Then, the phone rings. Each of the five responds in their own way, but each realizes that the headaches, the nosebleeds, the inexplicable pain that accompanies **those** calls is absent, so, slowly, each picks up the phone. Static fuzzes the line, but the words are clear enough. "This is a wake-up call, Patient Dawn. It's a sharp-edged universe and you've caught your sleeve on it. I won't pretend I can help you, but help can't be found by looking. Head to the auditorium, find Del Salazar. He's inside." The line clicks dead. Each of the five looks out their window at the auditorium- it's still early, so there's no line, but they probably aren't letting people in this early. But if this 'Del Salazar' can help, it just might be worth it to find a way in...
