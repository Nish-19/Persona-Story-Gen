A bounty hunting crew crash-lands near a pirate hideout after their plan goes awry, facing a rocket-wielding demolitions expert, a reckless pilot on a weaponized cycle, and a stealthy hacker lurking in the shadows. How do they turn the tables before itâ€™s too late?


#### Story ####
It was supposed to be an easy job. The crew of the *Albatross* had gotten a very promising tip from an old contact that owed one of them a favor. He knew where to find the Red Star Gang, a trio of small time smugglers recently turned to piracy. According to their source, they'd set up a hideout in the ruins of a crashed Eridani Dominion battlecrusier in the dunes of Ayao, a sparsely inhabited and lawless desert world outside the borders of any major galactic government. The Eridani authorities were offering reasonably hefty bounties for all three of the Red Star Gang: fifty thousand NuCreds apiece, plus an additional fifty thousand as a bonus if all three were brought in alive. That kind of payday could keep the crew fed and the ship fueled for the better part of a solar year. They came up with a simple plan: swoop down out of orbit right above the derelict ship, disable the pirates' own spacecraft with a few quick shots from the *Albatross'* dorsal autocannon, then threaten the entire gang into surrendering without a fight. Easy. Sadly, the tipster neglected to mention that the Red Star Gang had gotten some of the old wrecked battlecruiser's ship-to-ship weapons back online. The *Albatross* had barely entered Ayao's atmosphere when a powerful plasma bolt ripped through the hull. It was hardly the worst damage the ship had suffered in its troubled existence, but it was enough to take the autocannon offline and force an emergency landing about half a kilometer from the pirate base. The crew was lucky enough to endure the bumpy landing with nothing worse than a few bruises and scrapes. The Red Star Gang didn't seem inclined to let the *Albatross* get away with minor damage. Only a few seconds after the landing, a deafeningly loud explosion rang out just a few dozen meters from the craft, blasting a new crater into the dunes and spraying the hull with a shower of sand. The explosion was followed by crazed laughter from one of their targets: Bartholomew Reinoff, better known as 'Bloody Bart', one of the Red Star Gang. A former mercenary demolitions expert, he was toting some sort of massive rocket launcher that looked like it was originally meant to be strapped to a vehicle rather than wielded by a single individual. He was shouting something that was probably some sort of taunt or threat, but was impossible to hear over the din of the explosion. The noise only grew worse as some sort of heavily modified UltraCycle tore out of the hideout hangar, making a beeline for the *Albatross* seated atop it was their second target: Carlotta Enkov, 'Crazy Carly'. Carly was a former military scout, now serving as pilot for the gang. Ignoring the explosions ringing out throughout the dunes, she sped forward towards the *Albatross* and began wildly firing bullets from her cycle-mounted submachine gun, aiming for structural weaknesses in the downed craft. There was as of yet no sign of Ayako Kasumi, the supposed leader of the gang. That wasn't surprising, but it was worrying. 'Shadow' was their infiltration specialist, a stealthy hacker rumored to have previously been employed as a spy for one military agency or another. She was probably relying on the other two to serve as a distraction while she got in position to do real damage. The *Albatross* had lost the element of surprise and the use of their most powerful weapon, but they still had their wits and numerical superiority. They'd make it through this okay. Right?
