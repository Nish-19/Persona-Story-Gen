#### Writing Prompt ####
A band of treasure hunters arrives in a desert town, claiming to have a map to the fabled Lost Cityâ€”a place shrouded in mystery, greed, and divine curses. But as whispers of their quest spread, the locals wonder: are they brave, foolish, or something far more dangerous?


#### Story ####
The lust for gold lies within every heart, however well-hidden it may be. Or, at least, that is what the dwarves of the Ironside Mountains say. And, whatever the truth of this proverb in general, it was surely in the minds of the people of Ain-Qisam that evening, when they saw the motley collection of outsiders stumble into their little town. Judging from appearances, these strange folk were adventurers, which in the desert usually meant treasure hunters. Or perhaps grave robbers--though to the Ishkarim this was less an act of desecration and more an inevitable fact of life. Camels spat, sand stung your eyes, jackals looted tombs. In these more enlightened days they burned their dead anyway. So no one in Ain-Qisam paid much attention to the visitors, save to note that some were foreigners while others were not. The large golem that travelled with them raised a few eyebrowsbut, after all, the art of golemancy was not unknown or even very obscure. According to some of the better-educated townsfolk, it was a particularly impressive specimen, but even that was not sufficient to distract them from their own concerns. Their indifference did not last for long, however, once they had learned *why* this particular band of treasure hunters had come to their town. Fevered conversation gripped the marketplace as the locals packed away their wares: "The Lost City? Are you deaf or are they insane?" "My ears are as good as ever they were, thank you. But yes, they seek the Lost City." A shrug, careless and dismissive. "It is not the first time. It will not be the last. People will seek after anything that is lost." "How else are things to be found?" This from Jinan, the town's lone Priest of Naukar, whose opinion on such things was both predictable and hopelessly biased. "The Lost City is lost by the will of the gods. Why do these fools believe they can find it?" "The will of the gods?" A snort. "No; it was *men* who decreed the city should be lost. Though I will not say that they were wrong, for it was a place of wickedness and greed." "Did you see? The man is one of *them*. Who knows what *they* might seek there?" "The treasures of his ancestors?" The speaker let out a hoarse guffaw. "Don't be a fool." Some more pragmatic soul spoke next. "They have a map, I believe." "A map!" This was greeted with some scorn. "Anyone could draw such a thing, to profit from ignorant foreigners. *I* could have done so." "And have done in the past, I would imagine." This speaker was a young woman, clad in light chainmail, a shamshir at her belt. "Well. Perhaps they know the true path. Perhaps not. If you will excuse me, *sudiqan*, I would see these travellers and their map for myself." --- In the meantime, the subjects of this conversation had settled in the public room of Ain-Qisam's caravanserai. Refreshments had been ordered, and they were now sampling the local delicacies, including what passed for beer in this part of the world. It was a strange brew, thick and sweet, almost a gruel in its unfiltered state--but for all that it was not unpleasant, and even those who were unfamiliar with it seemed to like it well enough. (Atru, of course, could not drink it at all, though perhaps he wished he could.) In any case, they each had more important things with which to occupy their minds; food and drink ranked a poor second to the task ahead of them. Ain-Qisam was the last marker on their map that could be called at all civilised. When they left on the morrow, they were to strike south and east across untracked lands, at the mercy of the merciless desert.
