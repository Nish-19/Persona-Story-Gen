#### Writing Prompt ####
Erin has ventured beyond the forbidden five-mile marker, breaking the commune's rules, but as she surveys an abandoned cabin with a broken window and open door, she hears the sound of hoofbeats behind her—someone from the commune has followed her. Who is it, and what will they do now that they’ve found her?


#### Story ####
Huddled in a damp and filthy jacket the lone girl rode slowly in the pre-dawn half light. There was a crispness in the fall air, clean and clear and the cold making each breath a cloud of vapor. Her ratty hood was down despite the warmth it would have provided her against the morning chill and her auburn hair was tied back in a ponytail. The chestnut quarter horse moved at an easy pace under her, following the rutted game trail, careful to pick up its hooves and place them so as to avoid the jutting roots and deadfall beneath the carpet of gold and ochre, red and yellow leaves. Erin sat deep in the saddle but hunched a bit, bow over her shoulder, arrows bundled into a sort of crude quiver made from a leather tool pouch strapped to her leg. Her eyes scanned the shadows along the crest of a low hill where they seemed to gather near the base of the white barked trees. She let her gaze linger on the darkness, confirming its vacancy. Pools of still water riffled black among the brush in the low places. Thin black branches protruded from the water. The edge of the pools fringed with reeds. The tall golden grasses made a hypnotizing sound like a whisper against the horses legs as she ascended the slope and she found her eyes getting heavy. Near the top she let out a short, sharp ho, more grunt than word and shifted her weight in the saddle. Gently she pulled back on the reins though the horse was already stopping. Red dot painted on the trunk of a tree. Nail in the center. A simple, easy to miss marker. Facing opposite the way strangers would come. She sat in the saddle eyeing it. Sniffed. Looked round. All was silent and still. Point of no return, hey Chess. Erin said to the horse and it twitched its ears and knickered as if in response. She rubbed its neck, let her bare hand rest against it a moment. This was the five mile marker. Five miles from home. She wasnt supposed to go past this point. It was forbidden. She wasnt supposed to leave the commune without someone with her either. Was never supposed to go out before dawn or after dusk. None of them were. She patted the horse's neck again. Nudged forward. The horse seemed at first hesitant to resume its earlier pace and instead went on more leisurely. Come on. she urged softly. Another nudge. He picked up the pace. Down the shaded side into the cold, the grasses here damp and high enough to wet her boots. Then up a steep dirt track past the edge of a field of tumbled down and moss-covered rocks. Before the path cut into tree cover she looked out over her right shoulder and could see the lake some miles distant. They called it Silver Lake because the old name had been forgotten and because of the way the shallows shone in the morning light. The sun was on it now, reflecting brilliantly but so near the shoulder of the mountains she rode still in shadow, the sun having not risen high enough yet to reach her. She wanted to stop and take it in longer but she reminded herself she wasnt sight-seeing this time and went on. At the crest of the hill she did stop though. From higher ground it was important to be still and to survey. After a time she dismounted and hitched the horse to a tree. The horses name was Chester; a name given to it by the Bowman's. An animal they had come to own when the trapper John Brannan had decided it was not suited to hunting and passed it along to them. It had ever been wary of the smell of guns and blood and was prone to bolt at the sound of a rifle shot. Taking her bow and arrows she whispered a reassurance to Chester, gave him another rub along his neck and then a pat before she walked out along the ridgeline, eyeing the ground. She watched for animals down in the wooded valley beyond, careful how she stepped, noting the direction of the wind. The hills were criss-crossed with wide cuts between the older, more densely packed forest here. These areas were choked with weeds, low, scraggly brush and stands of thin-trunked saplings. The remains of old ski-runs someone had told her. North of here stood an old place filled with burned out buildings that had once been a great lodge; a place for winter vacations they'd said. No-one went there now. The people that had lived there were all gone now. Nell said they had come to a bad end. The people who had stayed on _after_. Isaac had taken the girls there once, a long time after but the girls had been terrified of the place. There was a sort of superstitious fear of the place even now. Seeing nothing among the trees she crouched and waited. Waited for something like five minutes. Then, at last. _Movement._ Seventy five yards away at the edge of a clearing was movement. Something grey breaking from the dark. She felt her pulse quicken the way it always did. She had the arrow nocked but drew the string now. Raised the bow. Turned her head slightly to exhale, into the breeze not letting the vapor of her breath obscure her vision. It was a bighorn sheep, a ram judging by its wide, curving horns. It had clotted clumps of matted grey and a long white beard, it's alien eyes alert as it nosed the air. Too far away. Too much cover. She would spoil the shot and the noise would scare it off. She tried to remember what Emilie had said about their horns. How much of a curve they were supposed to have to legally hunt them back before the Fall. None of that mattered now of course, but her mind went there. She had always been interested in the way things were even if she sometimes thought Emilie and the others stretched the truth or exaggerated how easy life was by comparison. Erin knew bighorns didnt travel alone and since there was no shot to take, lowered her bow. She watched. There were four more. Tawny and pale. More animals meant more eyes to spot her, more ears to hear her. More noses to sniff her out of the air. With a bow, the best she could hope for was to take one of them. She watched them moving as they followed another trail through the trees up the face of another hill on the far side of the valley. God did she want to take one. That would make all this worth it. A quick run back, going light as she could. Then untying Chester and urging him along the ridge as fast as she dared go in the opposite direction of the big horns. She swung up onto the saddle and took him down a brush-covered defile which hid loose rocks and was more treacherous than she had expected. Chester nearly stumbled once but that was the worst of it and stayed up. Then she urged him back into a trot, angling up the hill back in the direction the sheep were travelling. Slowing as she neared it but riding along the top, trying to guess how far on she should need to ride. How far the animals might have moved. She couldn't be sure if the hill had been enough of a sound break to avoid detection but she doubted she could have gotten around them successfully without being heard. Still. When she judged she had reached roughly the right spot she pulled back on the reins and dropped from the horse's back, this time not tying the animal. Crouching she hurried up the ridge, soft boots quiet in the loamy earth. Skirting around an outcrop of rock she found a cutback and though steep she ascended it efficiently and with little sound. She slowed her breathing as she reached the summit. The bow was held high, string drawn, arrow nocked. She raised up, tried to gain a vantage point to see down the slope to the valley floor. She let out a breath, stopped. Below her on a rocky outcrop. Overgrown with weeds and surrounded by shade trees was an old, abandoned cabin. She recognized it as one of the cabins used by the trapper, though it was empty this time of year. It had once been an outbuilding built to house ski lodge equipment of some kind, or at least that's what Emilie had told her anyway. There was something odd about it though. Something out of place. She could just see the front door and window beside it from here, but the door was open instead of locked and chained closed. Also, the window appeared to have had its glass broken out. And that wasn't all... --- *I want one of you (you should collectively decide who, not just first come first serve) to have your character be out here and catch up to Erin at this point in the story. * *She is out alone, past the five mile marker on a horse that isn't hers. She's breaking rules and is going to be reprimanded when she gets back.* *Most likely situation is when Erin reaches the crest of the hill she sees an approaching rider which is your character. Maybe you went out in search of her not knowing where she went after finding her and/or the horse she took missing. Maybe you saw her go and followed her. Do others know you left? Are you breaking any rules by going? You could be planning to bring her back and try to cover for her, or maybe as a disciplinary figure.* *Whoever it is that goes should establish some sort of deeper relationship with Erin in this scene.* *Please play against the Erin challenge in one post, and we will follow with the cabin after if you opt to do so. Note the cabin has not been recently explored by either Erin or your character and is a mystery to you both why the door is open and the window broken out. There is no reason for anyone to be at the shack, plus all are accounted for at the commune except Erin.* *I would like to establish this scene with a few posts before I open it up for everyone who isn't out looking for her. I will let you know when it's wide open for free-for-all posting again.*
