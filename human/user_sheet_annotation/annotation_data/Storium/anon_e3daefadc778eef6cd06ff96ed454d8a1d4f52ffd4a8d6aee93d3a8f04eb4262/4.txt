As the Four Dragon Festival approaches, masters of martial arts, thieves, and travelers converge on the Imperial city, each with their own purpose. Will you face rival practitioners in duels of honor, navigate the treacherous Qing-Long river crossings, or brave the bandit-infested western roads?


#### Story ####
The day began with heat, perhaps uncharacteristically so, and then with dirt. Many speculated the heat was a sign the festival would be a time of great change, while some said it was a warning. To those on the day, it was dry. The roads were thick with people. Some were entourages of masters looking to try their luck, others simple spectators. In between, beggars and thieves moved but spirits were high enough no one noticed. High spirits did not kill the rivalries between styles though, and every few steps a new duel began. When such happened, those with more time or investment stopped to watch. --- It was just such an occasion, on the road from the South Coast to the Imperial city, that two masters looked to duel. They strolled off the path onto the grass, the sun beating down on their heads, and took five paces between them. To those in the know, these two masters would instantly be recognisable. The first, a taller man rolling his sleeves back, was Sifu Fu Chao Wu. A strong contender to be head of the Eight Palms, his service record was as long as the trail on his sleeves. The second, a young woman with fire in her eyes, was Dong-Geun Eun. She who knows a thousand kicks, and daughter of the chair to The Way of the Foot. It has been some time since I fought a Southern practitioner. Fu Chao smiled as he slid his feet together, and rolled his shoulders. I had thought you all died out. If we had it would be for the stupidity of the Northern barbarians. Dong-Geun replied, stretching her legs. But worry not, I shall ensure not to send you away with your tail between your legs. They faced each other and, fist to palm, bowed. Please they spoke in unison. --- Elsewhere, many had reached the Qing-Long river. This great body of water was the final boundary between the North and the Imperial city. It was a place of life, but taken lightly it was a place of death too. Its current was strong, and it led all the way to the Eastern Coast. To ford this river the Emperor built two major crossings. First was the Emperors own bridge; a place staffed and audited by the Imperial Guard. The second was the ancient bridge at the Serpents Tongue where the river was divided in two. Due to the nature of those traveling to the festival people packed onto both bridges. The waits to cross would be hours if not days. Camps appeared for those who could afford to wait and boats for those who weren't. But like with all gatherings of people, these areas were tense and not without their problems. With far too many to contain, the Imperial Guard could not stop every crime or intercede in every duel. --- For those taking the western roads though there was an altogether different problem. Long had the poorer western lands been plagued by banditry. Their trade routes plundered and their highways ransacked. Anyone travelling here would need a strong arm and a tough heart. Though many ventured beyond their walls, few reached their destination. The bandits had little interest in the festival. They saw it as a waste of time brought on by those who had too much money. The mountain clans of this mind stalked down to patrol roads and set up toll posts. To a brave practitioner they may be little challenge, but to those not so strong they would prove a deadly. No journey in these parts could end without blood. --- Such was the Four Dragon Festival, that really began long before the day the festival started.
