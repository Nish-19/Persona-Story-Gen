#### Story ####
#Act I: A Handful of Dust Daniel came early to the wake. The funeral home's parking lot was mainly empty, except for a small scattering of vehicles. Two were parked in the spaces closest to the back door, likely the designated spots of the funeral home staff. There were three or four other cars he didn't recognize, and one that he did: a 1998 Toyota Camry, the "Torture Is a Moral Issue" bumper sticker still plastered to the back, faded but stubbornly legible. His grandparents hadn't exactly adjusted well to change, as long as he'd known them. He had been sitting in the car for ten minutes. Something kept him in the driver's seat, staring through the windshield at the trees lining the parking lot. It was a sunny Saturday morning, and the leaves made gold-green kaleidoscopes on the sidewalk. The manicured shrubs hinted that a loving hand had directed the landscaping here. The inside would probably be like that, too: extravagant bouquets of flowers, carefully color-coordinated curtains, neat arrangements of chairs, memorial wreaths, photo collages, sympathy cards, guestbooks. The dead body itself, sculpted with formaldehyde, plaster, mortician's makeup, bathed and stuffed and hooked and shaped. They might as well rig it with animatronics and sell it to Universal Studios. Daniel rubbed his eyes and sighed. It wasn't right to think this way about his grandfather, but discomfort lodged in his esophagus, made him want to sulk and tell terrible jokes about the Holocaust and dead babies, made him stay in the car when he knew his grandma was inside and probably needed him. Lung cancer, for God's sake. Eighty-nine years, most of them spent working for the IRS or dodging Japanese bullets in the Pacific theater during World War II, and it was the Marlboros that finally closed out his accounts. Still. As Daniel knew, there were far worse ways to go. In a moment of decision, he jerked himself out of the car, locked up, and walked through the door of Rosenberg Funeral Home. The walls were softly lit and lined with grandmother-pink wallpaper. *Maternal* was the word for it. Daniel looked around the empty hallways. Nothing but chairs lined up outside walls and open doors to empty rooms. He chose a direction, turned the corner, and saw his grandmother standing with her hands clasped to her chest. She was speaking with a tall man who had sympathetic eyes and a crown of wispy white hair surrounding an oddly reflective bald spot. Grandma's eyes wandered, found his, and she stopped. So did Daniel. For a moment, they stood and looked at each other. How many years had it been? She seemed to wonder the same thing. Her eyes were more tired than he remembered. He saw the light of recognition dawning in them, and she unclasped her hands and opened her arms. "Daniel. Oh. Daniel. You made it here." "Grandma." Daniel closed the distance and wrapped his arms around her shoulders. It felt like hugging a baby bird. Grandma ended the hug and looked up at him with her palms against his shoulders. She was smiling, but her eyes had a certain flatness. Was it a hint of anger? "It's good to have you here, Daniel." The tall man shuffled his weight slightly, and Grandma backed away to include him in their confidence. "Daniel, this is Arthur. He owns the funeral home here." "Pleased to meet you, Daniel," Arthur said, turning his kind eyes on Daniel and extending his hand to shake. "Your grandfather was a friend of mine, going a long way back. I'm happy to do anything I can for the Spanners." "Thank you," Daniel said. His mind had chilled a bit after seeing the look in Grandma's eyes, and automatic politeness came out of his mouth. "I appreciate that." Arthur smiled. "Well, I know you've come quite a ways to get here. I'm sure you'd like some privacy, before the guests arrive for the viewing. If you need me," he said, inclining his head toward Grandma almost as if bowing, "I'll be in my office." "Bless your heart, Arthur," Grandma said. "You've been so kind." Arthur left them in the hallway, and Grandma watched him for a few moments. When he disappeared from sight, she sighed and her shoulders seemed to sag. "It's good to see you," she said. "It's good to see you, too," Daniel said. She looked at him, and there was a cold spark in her eyes, even through the grief and exhaustion of the past few days' arrangements. "It's been a long time, Daniel." An edge had crept into her voice, and it hung in the air between them.
