#### Writing Prompt ####
In a psychiatric hospital where routine is everything, a long-term patient begins to notice subtle cracks in the facade—an orderly’s strange behavior, a doctor’s too-perfect smile, and whispers of something hidden beneath the surface. What happens when she decides to dig deeper?


#### Story ####
#Act I: Sparks It was a particularly sunny Saturday morning at Whistler-Down. Breakfast had been scrambled eggs, toast, orange juice, and oatmeal, as usual-- with the addition of bacon. Real, honest-to-God bacon that had once been part of a pig. Even Jaz had cracked a smile, though she was quick to return her black lipstick-painted lips back to their usual scowling position in case someone was looking. Araceli had caught it anyway and tried her best to hide her smirk. The only person who hadn't been happy about the menu surprise was Elsie, but that couldn't be helped. She was starting to make some progress: the day before, she'd eaten at least something at all three meals. Some of the hollowness was starting to fade from her cheeks. After breakfast, the topic of the community discussion group had been Creatively Resolving Conflicts... again. Araceli was one of the more 'permanent' residents at Whistler-Down. In the women's ward, only Grace had been around longer than she had, as far as she could tell. Grace was constantly dozing off, thanks to whatever medication they'd put her on. It was hard to get her to stay awake long enough to have a sustained conversation. Creatively Resolving Conflicts was one of the more engaging workshops, at least. The facilitator had brought in cue cards for role-playing exercises, which was always entertaining. The Saturday wasn't off to a bad start. According to the clock in the common room, it was 9:30. Araceli had to wait until 9:32 for Jim to come find her. Jim was one of the younger orderlies. He performed his duties with briskness and avoided eye contact with most patients when he did. It was apparent that whatever he'd once envisioned for his life, Whistler-Down hadn't been part of the plan. It was the usual Saturday morning for him: his eyes were watery and bloodshot, and he dragged himself through the hallways as if Grace had lent him some of her meds. "Ara, doctor's check," Jim slurred. He followed her at a perfunctory distance until they reached Dr. Janus' office. His hand fumbled at the doorknob for just a moment, as if he'd misjudged the distance. Ara felt the quick glance he shot at her, baleful with the spiderweb-fissures of veins in his eyes. It didn't really matter if she noticed the slip-up-- as one of the longer-term patients and a persona non grata to the outside world, her judgments didn't count for much. But he still had the instinct to check. Jim opened the door. Dr. Benjamin Janus sat inside, the light of the sunny Saturday morning illuminating him like a muted halo. This was the most tranquil space in the entire hospital, with leather couches, soft rugs, bright cheery plants near the windows, and paintings in warm and vibrant colors. Dr. Janus looked up from his papers. "Ara!" he called out with a smile. "Come on in." His eyes shifted to Jim. The two men shared a nod. Jim shot a sullen look at Ara before shuffling off. Ara closed the door behind her and took the patient's customary seat on the brown leather couch. On mornings past, an orderly had needed to accompany her into the office and occupied the other end of the couch. With only her and the doctor in the room, the room felt freer, as if there were more air to breathe. The psychiatrist pushed some papers to the side of his desk and turned his full attention to Ara. His smile was a little worn, and his crow's feet seemed sculpted more deeply than usual. He'd already seen a few patients today, and some of them must have given him a hard time. "You look radiant today, Ara. Milagros tells me you've had a good week." It was true. Milagros, the evening shift nurse in the women's ward, would usually be the one to come to Dr. Janus' office bearing bad news about relapses, episodes, and breakdowns. Not so, this week. "Tell me how you're feeling. How's your mood? And how's the Rozerem working out? We can always go back to Ambien if you've noticed any side-effects." It wasn't apparent in his smile, which despite his tiredness shone with genuine affability, but they'd had this conversation many times over the years. Ara knew his usual repertoire of questions and could guess his timing to the second. These were the usual starting questions. In a few minutes, in his usual manner of compassion coupled with professionalism, Dr. Janus would dip into the more serious questions: how were the nightmares. Had she experienced any desires to hurt herself or others. Was she experiencing thoughts of suicide. It was another Saturday.
