On a struggling Roman colony on Mars, where ancient Martian artifacts have awakened sinister forces, a newly appointed bishop must navigate political tensions, alien threats, and his own unexpected rise to powerâ€”all while trying to keep the colony from tearing itself apart.


#### Story ####
He didn't know that Rome had made him a bishop. And even if the congratulatory message from the Vatican hadn't been absorbed by the electromagnetic cloud enveloping Mars and blocking all communications from Earth, his elevation to the Bishopric would have been the last thing on is mind at the moment. The man struggling to survive a massive coronary attack needed his full attention. Father Eusebius moved around the various pieces of medical equipment as he sprinkled the bed of Sextus Agrippa Strabo with holy water, chanting the words of the *asperges me.* As he did so, Dr. Al-Andalus ordered her staff to withdraw to a respectful distance while the Papal Nuncio continued with the rite. Putting his ear close to Strabo's lips, he heard the man's confession. As Father Eusebius gave the stricken man absolution, the words of the prayer were obscured by the rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor. And yet, fragments of the ancient prayer still drifted into the ears of those waiting to speak with the first Roman Governor of Mars. *"Dmine sancte, Pater omnipotens, aetrne Deus, te fidliter deprecmur, ut accipinti fratri nostro sacrosanctum Corpus Dmini nostri Jesu Christi Fillii tui..." * The Vestal Virgin, a pagan and unlikely friend of Fr. Eusebius, clasped her hands in an attitude of respect for what was now--and had been for eighteen centuries--the dominant and official Religion of the Empire. Beside her stood a patrician woman whose family name was well known in the circles of Imperial power back on Earth. Next to her, a geologist repeated the Sign of the Cross over is own head, shoulders, and torso every time the priest made it over the still form of their hapless governor. "...*tam crpori quam animae prost ad remdium sempitrnum: Qui tecum vivit et regnat..." * Two men stood apart from the first group. Their chiseled features and precise postures identified them as *viri militaribus*: military men. The senior of the two, wearing the uniform of a *Navis Praefectus* in the Imperial Roman Navy, stared straight ahead, his countenance betraying nothing. The other, an *Optio* in the Roman Army, watched the rites intently. Two visible scars on his face hinted at the presence of several others hidden under his uniform tunic. Occasionally his eyes left the scene playing out around the sickbed to regard the superior officer standing slightly ahead of him and to his left. Although his eyes rested only momentarily on the Captain, in that brief moment they were able to betray their owner's contempt for the man likely to take command of the Colony while Strabo recovered. *If* he recovered. Father Eusebius continued with the ritual, anointing Strabo with the *Oleum Infirmorum .* During the minutes which followed, each of the prominent members of *Campus Martius* ("The Field of Mars" as the colony informally referred to itself) had time to ponder the chain of unlikely events which had brought them all to this moment in time and space. For some, the events of the last year had blurred together. For others, each turning point stood out sharply: the media frenzy accompanying their departure from the Syene launch complex in Aegyptus, the tedium of the long interplanetary flight, the nearly disastrous computer glitches (induced, as it turned out by a saboteur among their number), the capture of the Chinese agent who had been surgically modified to assume the false identity of one "Lucia Cupro." When the squadron of three colony ships finally entered Martian orbit, things had gone from bad to worse: the crash landing of the colony ship *Anchises* with its attendant loss of life, building materials and precious supplies. The desperate struggle to survive on limited rations and damaged equipment. Then there was the excitement accompanying the discovery of water in the ice caves under the Arcadian Plain. That water had meant that the colony's long term viability was assured...or so they had thought. Shortly after the discovery of frozen water, other things had been discovered in the cave as well. Sinister things. Sculptures and artifacts of impossible antiquity offered stark and disturbing proof that Mars had been the home of an advanced civilization over eighty million years before man had emerged upon the Earth. And the Cube...that mysterious green block of ice from which emanated energy of a type never before encountered. It was at about that time that the enemy agent Cupro had been executed and buried in the frozen patch of Martian tundra which served as the colony's graveyard. *But she had not remained dead.* Some unknown force--the Cube, most Romans thought--had served to reanimate her. Even now, the corpse of Lucia Cupro, possessed by the spirit of a long-dead Martian, roamed somewhere outside the pressurized hull of *Campus Martius.* And she...*it*...was not alone. Five other Roman graves lay empty, their former occupants now respawned Martians as well... *"Benedicat te omnipotens Deus, Pater, et Flius, et Spritus Sanctus. Amen." * Fr. Eusebius' final blessing yanked them all back to the present. Kissing his purple stole as he removed it from his shoulders, he walked towards the group. In answer to their unspoken question, he simply shook his head. Whether his reply meant, "he won't last long" or "I simply don't know," none of them could tell. "The Propraetor will see you all," Eusebius said. "First however, Captain Flavius, he wishes to see you. In private." Once the others had withdrawn, Decimus Calpurnius Flavius approached Strabo's bed. Assuming that the governor's weakened condition left him unable to speak loudly or clearly, he bent close over the prone form. He was surprised by the speed with which Strabo's hand shot upwards, clutching the material of Flavius' tunic with unexpected strength. "Flavius, you son of a bitch!" he growled. "Leadership of this Colony falls to you while I am thus indisposed, and God help us all for it! By the Mass, if you allow your hubris to run amok and jeopardize all we've worked for, so help me, I'll..." The machine behind Strabo had been beeping with increasing urgency, and the accompanying oscilloscope trace looked more like a sampling from a seismograph than a heart monitor. The remainder of Strabo's words were lost in a spasm of coughing.
