#### Story ####
They had the 115 magi they would need. The San Francisco branch of the Danelon were distinctly low on magical energy, and with favors they owed in Chinatown, and a general quota they owed to the high council, a big draw of energy was exactly what they needed. From all over the west coast of the so-called independent nation of the United States, came some of the most talented Danelon Magi. But it hadnt been a speedily-perfected plan. There were a lot of grudges in the mixture of the needed mystics that had to be ironed out, and the exact best time to open the gate for some more power had not yet been determined. They knew where to do it though. Alcatraz Island was no longer a prison, but the rough waters in the bay, and the fact that the tours of the prison were strictly scheduled meant they would have more than enough time. A few quick spells and the tour boats to the island were lent by the night watchmen, along with the consent of a tour operator. Theyd never remember these guys, which was exactly how it should be. It was best when even the Danelons biggest coups would not be remembered by any of the norms out there. Ralph Bach, a man who could have known Johan Sabastian personally, drew imaginary lines in his head, making sure that the rest were exactly where they needed to be. This would be one of the largest gatherings of magical energy in the 21st century and it would all be for his glory. Perhaps he might even make a better focus, being able to draw on even more of what the Danelon gathered rather than the rations of magical energy he was provided with. He had overdrawn on the communal store of magic many times through his focus and it was why he wasnt in Las Angeles, New York, or Beijing right now. The anchors all formed the inner core of the formation, some of them chained down as draws this big could cause them to flail and hurt themselves when the energy came flooding through. A larger core stood outside the main gate, in the dark as they did not want to alert the outside world to what they were doing. Ralph lifted his hand, the bronze ring on his finger beginning to glow with a slight light of its own, and the chanting and gesturing began, while the Anchors, those who would take the brunt of the energy flowing out of the gate gritted their teeth but also kept up the ritualistic gesturing and incanting that they too needed in order that all this energy that would come forth would fall into the Danelons hands. Over the gate, the gate that many prisoners had passed through, a curtain of glowing colors formed. Greens, blues, pinks, and oranges danced over the opening, and all the Danelon felt a surge of power. The power grew. The Most ambitious of the Danelon felt that their schemes were in reach; the official they desired to control, the tech they wanted destroyed, or the medicines they wanted developed, or conveniently deemed too dangerous all seemed within reach. Alie Haiden: A blonde woman almost as old as Ralph, but not as successful, saw herself finally developing the invisible fire a fire that seared the soul right out of a being, leaving no physical residue in the corpse. She had always been a scholar. Arnold Kant, a younger man, saw the many failed missions of assassins lately, and saw a way to infuse human muscles with the strength of Tungsten Steel, weakness would be a thing of the past in the Danelon and it would all be thanks to him. The glistening curtain tingled like a chime on a summer day porch. And the energy came in an ever-increasing flow as it was opened wider. The light grew brighter, and despite the toll being taken on the anchors, the Danelon functioned as a well-knit group in the elation of a successful draw, despite the many petty grievances many of the members of this team had with others. The music of a doorway never got old, and more instruments joined the piece, strings, chimes, bells, and flutes all added their voices coming from the door, unlike any instruments norms knew but flutes, strings, and others, were the closest thing a human mind could understand. The energy was almost drawn when a noise, far more discordant than the noise of magic sounded in the empty prison, echoing off of the old tower, the hard concrete walls, and bouncing about in the cell-lined corridors. It sounded much like the braying of a donkey, but somehow had a human malevolence to it as well. This had happened before. Ralph made the gesture and several of the Magi began to change their chanting and they began to thrust their hands at the opening. To drive back whatever was coming through. There were two forms striding through the gate. One a shapely female form, though the ground vibrated with every thudding step she took, while the other, larger and more muscular, seemingly even heavier walked a few steps in front. He was the first to be seen, and if it were not for his donkeys ears, he would actually have been quite handsome. Again the strange Braying laugh, and a quick gesture and the gate behind the man closed, several of the Danelon Anchors fell unconscious, and the strange, golden creature looked around. This will simply not do. The strange donkey-eared man said. With the magic collection suddenly ended, bits of the magic, corrupted by the two creatures spread out into the bay Area, the only clues that would warn those who could stop the Golden king with his magic touch. A few hours later, each would find something a bit odd, a trinket of silver or gold, that would let them know that something was wrong. Whether assassin, Danelon exile, or even a simple amateur journalist, they would hear the warnings, and if they didnt, the Bay, and perhaps even more would be in danger.
