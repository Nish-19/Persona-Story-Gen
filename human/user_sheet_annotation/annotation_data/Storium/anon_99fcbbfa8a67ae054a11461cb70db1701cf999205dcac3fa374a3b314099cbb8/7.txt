As Circus Europa sets up in the smog-filled port of Marseilles, tensions rise not just from the shifting alliances of nations, but from the enigmatic decisions of its grizzled manager, Eduardo Menindez. What secrets lie beneath the circus's dazzling performances, and why do they linger in some towns far longer than others?


#### Story ####
The Circus was headed into Marseilles, and the port city looked like it could really use the cheer of a circus. The city was an industrial center and clouds of smog filled the skies, giving the sky a nasty brown color, or at least orange on a good day. The market square, at the center of the harbor district would be the site of the performances for the next 4 days. It was hard to figure out how long the circus would be at any one point. The children had spent only 18 hours in Lyons and then for some reason, squatted down and put on full performances for 3 solid weeks in a little town in wine country that had fewer villagers than could possibly have been profitable. The circus staff on that stop had actually more than doubled the towns population. But you didnt question the manager on such things .Menindez made you afraid to ask about what was going on, except in the odd cases where he got mad if you didnt. It was hard to peg Old Ed, as a couple of the English and American performers called Eduardo Menindez, the grizzled 65-year-old manager who could pass for 45 most of the time. He was the real one that kept the circus running, but even in business affairs, he usually used the ring mistress, Clara Poe, an American who did triple duty as public face of the Circus Europa, Ring Mistress, and trick shooter. The little Dark-haired woman of about 40 was sometimes called clairpow playfully by many at the circus, and the name was used when there were enough English people in the crowd to like the onomatopoeia. Even when she wasnt doing her act, she carried a number of guns on her person, most of them with flashy ammunition or even comical attachment or noises involved, because her act was often quite comical. But as they looked at the harbor, there was the mix of people that had made Marseilles a hotbed of activity, both good and bad, since pre-Roman times. As a Mediterranean port, the city was part of the known world since before writing, and people from Africa, Asia, and all over Europe had gathered there for trade, intermingling, and at times, violence. Clara had announced that morning that England had changed its tune again and now was praising Germany to the heavens. Unfortunately, Germany had just decided that France was its closest ally. The circus had learned from her reports that the uneasy situation between the three countries changed almost every couple of weeks, though it was becoming more unstable. But life went on in Circus Europa, and the brilliant performing children were still at work preparing for the afternoons performance. Whether they worked in the sideshows, or would be in the center ring, the kids always had extensive training exercises each day and although they were paid and treated well, they were worked hard as well. Now each one was putting the finishing touches on preparing what they would do today.
