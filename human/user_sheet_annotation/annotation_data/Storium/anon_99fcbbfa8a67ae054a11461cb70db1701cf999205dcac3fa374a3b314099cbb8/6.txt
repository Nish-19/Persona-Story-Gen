#### Writing Prompt ####
On a sweltering summer night in the shadowy streets of Mousehole, a lone officer is sent to break up a fight at the local park pool, knowing the heat has everyone on edge and the line between order and chaos is razor-thin. What awaits in the dark corners of the neighborhood tonight?


#### Story ####
It was a very hot summer in Rootgold, and even at night, when most of the animals came out of hiding, the air remained stifling and hot. The chirping of insects almost brought to a low roar by the high heat and humidity was the only natural sound. It was too hot for the night birds to come out of hiding, and they probably wouldnt seek food until just before sunrise, when the temperature might drop below 95 and perhaps a bit of dew would give everyone something to drink. Everyone would have something to drink tonight, except about half of the Mousehole. Over the past week, water mains had broken in 5 different places and now far too many had no clean drinking water. The convenience stores had bottled water, but most couldnt afford to get enough, even if the prices werent suddenly raised to absurd levels. The Cathouse, the name the neighborhood used to refer to their station, had cracked down on gougers as much as they could, but there werent enough cops in Mousehole to make sure that the prices stayed reasonable. There also wasnt enough space in the small station jail to lock up every criminal they found. But it was hot, thirsty weather, which always produced hot, thirsty, and angry people. The violence would spike tonight for sure. It was well past 10, and the sun had gone down. Most of the city of Rootgold was still lit up, with artificial lighting, and it was the bane to stargazers throughout the area, but Mousehole was pretty dark. There werent as many street lights, and as every parent knew, people were a lot like children, and they were more likely to misbehave when they thought they couldnt be seen. Of the few lights Mousehole did have, about a quarter didnt work at all or had been broken and never repaired. It wasnt uncommon for a beat cop to come upon people in the dark and not see them until they were only a few feet away. Almost every cop had gotten skunked before and it wasnt uncommon to have a run-in with a coyote, coydog, or raccoon every once in a while. Police were always on edge here, partially because the neighborhood was very spooky, even to experienced cops, filled with the sounds of humanity and animals while they walked, nearly blind along the streets. Sometimes it was loud, and sometimes it was disturbingly quiet. Where the cops could only hear their own breathing and the clomping sound of their own bootsteps. There were the usual faire of night travelers in the Mousehole, you had the two gangs: the foxes in their red and white, and the eagles in their gold and black, women, and sometimes men, of the night, drug dealers, and what every cop learned quickly, mostly just everyday people going about their business: needing that one last thing at the store or going to see someone who could use their help. An officer got a call as he walked alongChekovsky Avenue. Theres been a fight at the Roberto Park pool, get there and put an end to it. Were running low on space in the jail tonight, so only arrest someone who really causes trouble. Came the voice of the captain Vera Fife, one of the best officers in the force. People joked that the Hispanic woman had risen through the ranks so fast because she grew tired of being called Deputy Fife, but she knew how to handle a gun and knew how to handle police work with both skill and subtlety. She gave the lone officer the directions and waited for his response, though he was already making his way towards Roberta Park.
