Words and images scrolling by blindly as he went. She reached at the thing to smash it and regain her control.\nBut Shay simply pulled his hands out of reach and kept reading. A slight turn to put her at angle to his hip and not straight on.\n\"Surely you jest.\" Voss said as she hovered over now. Her wings vibrating the air similar to a hummingbird.\n\"Nope. Lying is easy.\" Shay flatly reacted. \"It's the truest truth that's ever been told about people that's true. We lie all the time.\"\nHe realized the woman was hovered several inches from his temple and absently swatted as her so she'd make some room. She landed and stomped her foot a little at the gesture, the wings giving off an iridescent shine as they readjusted.\n\"But why?\" She asked next.\nShay stopped texting and glanced up. \"Because fuck you, that's why.\"\n\"That's not an answer!\"\n\"Yes it is.

There isn’t even a full brain in your thick skull anymore. All that’s left is a machine. You’re nothing but a gun. Now stop jamming and fire.” Lieutenant Gabby Ria ordered, pointing at the child across from her.\nWhile she shrieked out her orders, Era froze, unable to pull the trigger. The lieutenant was right; they were only a weapon. Yet memories were flooding into its mind, drowning out that robotic side that often took centre stage. Memories of a specific human it couldn’t recognise, getting overwhelmed by their past.\nAcross from the pair, the girl, Jessica, remained curled behind a desk, gripping a stuffed bear. The paw of the bear once holding a tiny red balloon, one that had been torn off days ago. Even without the scraps she wore, she was a miserable sight. Tired eyes, constant shaking and a murmuring for help that only Era’s hyper-detailed hearing could pick up. “Please, leave me alone.” She begged.\nEra could never point its gun at a superior officer, so instead, it turned its face towards her, neck twisting eighty degrees to find her. They designed Era models to be basic, stripping them of all their unique features and traits. Giving them the same blank blue eyes, light brown hair, and voice chips. This making it harder for a lieutenant or any officer to see them as anything other than a disposable machine.\n“Why? Why can I think? I don’t like this? I don’t like thinking. Everything hurts, I’m scared. It’s dark in here. Gabby. You told me I wouldn’t hurt. Why am I hurting?” The tone remained robotic, with the blank face unable to express the sensations pulsing through its circuits.\nGabby retrieved her own pistol, gazing away from Era, turning her attention to the laboratory they stood in. They had bombed the place to hell. No, that didn’t even do it justice. They had bombed the place to purgatory, leaving nothing but scorched land, a few desks and the remnants of glass and tubes. If one passed through this place, they would assume it had been an underground dumping facility, not the proud anti Era factory they had boasted about while it was still active.\n“You can’t feel pain, and you can’t think. There shouldn’t even be a part of you that can think. It’s blocked under our programing. Listen to me, Era.” Gabby began.\n“I’M NOT ERA.” They snapped. “I’m Nick. We know each other. Don’t we?”\nGabby’s heart sank. This shouldn’t be possible. No other Era model had recovered their memories before. “They shouldn’t even have that name saved to your chip.” As she contemplated the information, she heard tiny footsteps near the table. Returning her gun to the girl, she fired a shot, trying to hit the monster before it could flee. When the gun fired, the girl ducked back behind the table. “Don’t move, monster. Is this your doing?”\nEra looked at the weapon in their hands, tensing. “You said this program was for justice. Didn’t you? That we would save people? Why are we doing this, then? You said this program would save me. Am I actually saved?” You’ve made me into a monster.”\n“They shouldn’t have assigned you to me, Nick. None of this makes any sense. I never lied about anything. On your deathbed, I told you that this was the only way you could keep fighting. You wanted to fight. I was against this.” Gabby kept her weapon pointed at the table, giving Era a side glance.\n“I don’t want to do this. I’m scared. Why did they need part of my brain? Can’t they make robots?”\n“Robots are unreliable. They can be hacked, and their energy drains far too quickly. Allowing them to use part of a human brain allows their processes to save space and energy on the field. You should already know this. We’ve had this conversation before, haven’t we?” Gabby stepped closer to the table, only to halt when she heard Era follow her.\n“Don’t kill her.”\n“Why not?”\n“She’s only a kid.”\nGabby sighed. “You know. Part of me wanted to believe that was actually you, Nick. That I could say a proper goodbye to my old friend. It’s not. That creature’s just pulling at memories, trying to find something that might weaken me. A creature like this killed you. You should know she isn’t just a kid. its emotional manipulation, the same type you fell to. I’m guessing you knew that too, monster. Or did you overlook that memory when you were sweeping through our files?”\nJessica screeched, tossing the bear to the floor. She knew she was trapped, giving guttural growls as she tapped the table, shaking her only cover. Gabby remained still, not approaching the sound, nor firing a wasted shot. “Nick, if that is you in there, you’ll take the shot.”\nEra did nothing, and so Gabby reached into Era’s hand, pulling the trigger on his weapon. When it fired, the monster popped out from its cover, assuming Gabby had fired her own gun. Thinking it had a chance to run, it lunged out of cover, only to get shot down by Gabby. The ‘girls’ synthetic skin falling away as it powered down, revealing the metallic body underneath.\n“Fucking manipulative pricks. I can’t believe they keep making these things. To think, a monster like that can find out so much about a person without needing to get into their heads. Not only that, their able to mess with the Era models programming. So much for the anti-hacking argument my superiors gave me. Why do we even need a human brain in them anymore, if those creatures can get around it?” Gabby pushed her fingers against her eyes, wiping the tears away. “Fucking hell, Nick. You’re still haunting me.”\n“You’re a Lieutenant now Gabby?” A voice asked, causing Gabby to stiffen. “Weren’t you meant to wait for me?”\n“You died. I couldn’t wait. Nick, I’m sorry. I hesitated, and it killed you because of it. Nick, I’m…” She turned, finding a blank Era model staring at her.\n“There is no Nick in my records? Has a person been added to the mission statement? If so, please give me their full name or number and rank, so I may add them to my objective.”\n“Era, override programming protocol, no identification. Now tell me, who are you?” Gabby said, praying it wasn’t who she thought it was.\n“Heather Phillips donated this brain. Id 2003213. Would you like any further information on Heather Phillips?” Era asked.\n“No.” Gabby walked over and stomped the dead monster, making sure there was no way that its programming could keep running. “To think our enemies have resorted to this. Era, enter low-power mode, only run basic functions and cut off your link to main server. Sweep the area and capture anything humanoid you find. If you can’t capture it, kill it.”\nWith Gabby’s orders, the machine walked around the ruined laboratory, searching for more of those creatures. Gabby hoping that they wouldn’t be able to hack Era in its low powered mode. Without access to the main server, it shouldn’t be able to give away any of her secrets either. Gabby assuming that was how it found out about her connection to Nick, through whatever files they had saved about her and her previous missions.\nWhile Era searched the area, Gabby called their base. “Our enemies are getting stronger. It was able to find out about my connection to Nick. We need to bump up our security or they’ll soon learn how to turn the Era’s guns against us. I’ll tell you more when I get back. Just send a pickup. I’ve got a body here too. I’m sure you would like a chance to see what machinery they're putting inside their weapons.” She said, ending her transmission.",

Memories of a specific human it couldn’t recognise, getting overwhelmed by their past.\nAcross from the pair, the girl, Jessica, remained curled behind a desk, gripping a stuffed bear. The paw of the bear once holding a tiny red balloon, one that had been torn off days ago. Even without the scraps she wore, she was a miserable sight. Tired eyes, constant shaking and a murmuring for help that only Era’s hyper-detailed hearing could pick up. “Please, leave me alone.” She begged.\nEra could never point its gun at a superior officer, so instead, it turned its face towards her, neck twisting eighty degrees to find her. They designed Era models to be basic, stripping them of all their unique features and traits. Giving them the same blank blue eyes, light brown hair, and voice chips. This making it harder for a lieutenant or any officer to see them as anything other than a disposable machine.\n“Why? Why can I think? I don’t like this? I don’t like thinking. Everything hurts, I’m scared. It’s dark in here. Gabby. You told me I wouldn’t hurt. Why am I hurting?” The tone remained robotic, with the blank face unable to express the sensations pulsing through its circuits.\nGabby retrieved her own pistol, gazing away from Era, turning her attention to the laboratory they stood in. They had bombed the place to hell. No, that didn’t even do it justice. They had bombed the place to purgatory, leaving nothing but scorched land, a few desks and the remnants of glass and tubes. If one passed through this place, they would assume it had been an underground dumping facility, not the proud anti Era factory they had boasted about while it was still active.\n“You can’t feel pain, and you can’t think. There shouldn’t even be a part of you that can think. It’s blocked under our programing. Listen to me, Era.” Gabby began.\n“I’M NOT ERA.” They snapped. “I’m Nick. We know each other. Don’t we?”\nGabby’s heart sank. This shouldn’t be possible. No other Era model had recovered their memories before. “They shouldn’t even have that name saved to your chip.” As she contemplated the information, she heard tiny footsteps near the table. Returning her gun to the girl, she fired a shot, trying to hit the monster before it could flee. When the gun fired, the girl ducked back behind the table. “Don’t move, monster. Is this your doing?”\nEra looked at the weapon in their hands, tensing. “You said this program was for justice. Didn’t you? That we would save people? Why are we doing this, then? You said this program would save me. Am I actually saved?” You’ve made me into a monster.”\n“They shouldn’t have assigned you to me, Nick. None of this makes any sense. I never lied about anything. On your deathbed, I told you that this was the only way you could keep fighting. You wanted to fight. I was against this.” Gabby kept her weapon pointed at the table, giving Era a side glance.\n“I don’t want to do this. I’m scared. Why did they need part of my brain? Can’t they make robots?”\n“Robots are unreliable. They can be hacked, and their energy drains far too quickly. Allowing them to use part of a human brain allows their processes to save space and energy on the field. You should already know this. We’ve had this conversation before, haven’t we?” Gabby stepped closer to the table, only to halt when she heard Era follow her.\n“Don’t kill her.”\n“Why not?”\n“She’s only a kid.”\nGabby sighed. “You know. Part of me wanted to believe that was actually you, Nick. That I could say a proper goodbye to my old friend. It’s not. That creature’s just pulling at memories, trying to find something that might weaken me. A creature like this killed you. You should know she isn’t just a kid. its emotional manipulation, the same type you fell to. I’m guessing you knew that too, monster. Or did you overlook that memory when you were sweeping through our files?”\nJessica screeched, tossing the bear to the floor. She knew she was trapped, giving guttural growls as she tapped the table, shaking her only cover. Gabby remained still, not approaching the sound, nor firing a wasted shot. “Nick, if that is you in there, you’ll take the shot.”\nEra did nothing, and so Gabby reached into Era’s hand, pulling the trigger on his weapon. When it fired, the monster popped out from its cover, assuming Gabby had fired her own gun. Thinking it had a chance to run, it lunged out of cover, only to get shot down by Gabby. The ‘girls’ synthetic skin falling away as it powered down, revealing the metallic body underneath.\n“Fucking manipulative pricks. I can’t believe they keep making these things. To think, a monster like that can find out so much about a person without needing to get into their heads. Not only that, their able to mess with the Era models programming. So much for the anti-hacking argument my superiors gave me. Why do we even need a human brain in them anymore, if those creatures can get around it?” Gabby pushed her fingers against her eyes, wiping the tears away. “Fucking hell, Nick. You’re still haunting me.”\n“You’re a Lieutenant now Gabby?” A voice asked, causing Gabby to stiffen. “Weren’t you meant to wait for me?”\n“You died. I couldn’t wait. Nick, I’m sorry. I hesitated, and it killed you because of it. Nick, I’m…” She turned, finding a blank Era model staring at her.\n“There is no Nick in my records? Has a person been added to the mission statement? If so, please give me their full name or number and rank, so I may add them to my objective.”\n“Era, override programming protocol, no identification. Now tell me, who are you?” Gabby said, praying it wasn’t who she thought it was.\n“Heather Phillips donated this brain. Id 2003213. Would you like any further information on Heather Phillips?” Era asked.\n“No.” Gabby walked over and stomped the dead monster, making sure there was no way that its programming could keep running. “To think our enemies have resorted to this. Era, enter low-power mode, only run basic functions and cut off your link to main server. Sweep the area and capture anything humanoid you find. If you can’t capture it, kill it.”\nWith Gabby’s orders, the machine walked around the ruined laboratory, searching for more of those creatures. Gabby hoping that they wouldn’t be able to hack Era in its low powered mode. Without access to the main server, it shouldn’t be able to give away any of her secrets either. Gabby assuming that was how it found out about her connection to Nick, through whatever files they had saved about her and her previous missions.\nWhile Era searched the area, Gabby called their base. “Our enemies are getting stronger. It was able to find out about my connection to Nick. We need to bump up our security or they’ll soon learn how to turn the Era’s guns against us. I’ll tell you more when I get back.

        "writing_prompt": "\"I just think it's hilarious how you managed to convince yourself that you're somehow... allowed to be a person? Because you're not. You were born and raised to be a weapon, and that's all you are meant to be. You don't get to change, sweetheart. That's not how human weapons work.\"",
        "story": "“You don’t get to decide to have a heart now, sweetheart. That isn’t how this program works. You were born and raised to be a weapon. There isn’t even a full brain in your thick skull anymore. All that’s left is a machine. You’re nothing but a gun. Now stop jamming and fire.” Lieutenant Gabby Ria ordered, pointing at the child across from her.\nWhile she shrieked out her orders, Era froze, unable to pull the trigger. The lieutenant was right; they were only a weapon. Yet memories were flooding into its mind, drowning out that robotic side that often took centre stage. Memories of a specific human it couldn’t recognise, getting overwhelmed by their past.\nAcross from the pair, the girl, Jessica, remained curled behind a desk, gripping a stuffed bear. The paw of the bear once holding a tiny red balloon, one that had been torn off days ago. Even without the scraps she wore, she was a miserable sight. Tired eyes, constant shaking and a murmuring for help that only Era’s hyper-detailed hearing could pick up. “Please, leave me alone.” She begged.\nEra could never point its gun at a superior officer, so instead, it turned its face towards her, neck twisting eighty degrees to find her. They designed Era models to be basic, stripping them of all their unique features and traits. Giving them the same blank blue eyes, light brown hair, and voice chips. This making it harder for a lieutenant or any officer to see them as anything other than a disposable machine.\n“Why? Why can I think? I don’t like this? I don’t like thinking. Everything hurts, I’m scared. It’s dark in here. Gabby. You told me I wouldn’t hurt. Why am I hurting?” The tone remained robotic, with the blank face unable to express the sensations pulsing through its circuits.\nGabby retrieved her own pistol, gazing away from Era, turning her attention to the laboratory they stood in. They had bombed the place to hell. No, that didn’t even do it justice. They had bombed the place to purgatory, leaving nothing but scorched land, a few desks and the remnants of glass and tubes. If one passed through this place, they would assume it had been an underground dumping facility, not the proud anti Era factory they had boasted about while it was still active.\n“You can’t feel pain, and you can’t think. There shouldn’t even be a part of you that can think. It’s blocked under our programing. Listen to me, Era.” Gabby began.\n“I’M NOT ERA.” They snapped. “I’m Nick. We know each other. Don’t we?”\nGabby’s heart sank. This shouldn’t be possible. No other Era model had recovered their memories before. “They shouldn’t even have that name saved to your chip.” As she contemplated the information, she heard tiny footsteps near the table. Returning her gun to the girl, she fired a shot, trying to hit the monster before it could flee. When the gun fired, the girl ducked back behind the table. “Don’t move, monster. Is this your doing?”\nEra looked at the weapon in their hands, tensing. “You said this program was for justice. Didn’t you? That we would save people? Why are we doing this, then? You said this program would save me. Am I actually saved?” You’ve made me into a monster.”\n“They shouldn’t have assigned you to me, Nick. None of this makes any sense. I never lied about anything. On your deathbed, I told you that this was the only way you could keep fighting. You wanted to fight. I was against this.” Gabby kept her weapon pointed at the table, giving Era a side glance.\n“I don’t want to do this. I’m scared. Why did they need part of my brain? Can’t they make robots?”\n“Robots are unreliable. They can be hacked, and their energy drains far too quickly. Allowing them to use part of a human brain allows their processes to save space and energy on the field. You should already know this. We’ve had this conversation before, haven’t we?” Gabby stepped closer to the table, only to halt when she heard Era follow her.\n“Don’t kill her.”\n“Why not?”\n“She’s only a kid.”\nGabby sighed. “You know. Part of me wanted to believe that was actually you, Nick. That I could say a proper goodbye to my old friend. It’s not. That creature’s just pulling at memories, trying to find something that might weaken me. A creature like this killed you. You should know she isn’t just a kid. its emotional manipulation, the same type you fell to. I’m guessing you knew that too, monster. Or did you overlook that memory when you were sweeping through our files?”\nJessica screeched, tossing the bear to the floor. She knew she was trapped, giving guttural growls as she tapped the table, shaking her only cover. Gabby remained still, not approaching the sound, nor firing a wasted shot. “Nick, if that is you in there, you’ll take the shot.”\nEra did nothing, and so Gabby reached into Era’s hand, pulling the trigger on his weapon. When it fired, the monster popped out from its cover, assuming Gabby had fired her own gun. Thinking it had a chance to run, it lunged out of cover, only to get shot down by Gabby. The ‘girls’ synthetic skin falling away as it powered down, revealing the metallic body underneath.\n“Fucking manipulative pricks. I can’t believe they keep making these things. To think, a monster like that can find out so much about a person without needing to get into their heads. Not only that, their able to mess with the Era models programming. So much for the anti-hacking argument my superiors gave me. Why do we even need a human brain in them anymore, if those creatures can get around it?” Gabby pushed her fingers against her eyes, wiping the tears away. “Fucking hell, Nick. You’re still haunting me.”\n“You’re a Lieutenant now Gabby?” A voice asked, causing Gabby to stiffen. “Weren’t you meant to wait for me?”\n“You died. I couldn’t wait. Nick, I’m sorry. I hesitated, and it killed you because of it. Nick, I’m…” She turned, finding a blank Era model staring at her.\n“There is no Nick in my records? Has a person been added to the mission statement? If so, please give me their full name or number and rank, so I may add them to my objective.”\n“Era, override programming protocol, no identification. Now tell me, who are you?” Gabby said, praying it wasn’t who she thought it was.\n“Heather Phillips donated this brain. Id 2003213. Would you like any further information on Heather Phillips?” Era asked.\n“No.” Gabby walked over and stomped the dead monster, making sure there was no way that its programming could keep running. “To think our enemies have resorted to this. Era, enter low-power mode, only run basic functions and cut off your link to main server. Sweep the area and capture anything humanoid you find. If you can’t capture it, kill it.”\nWith Gabby’s orders, the machine walked around the ruined laboratory, searching for more of those creatures. Gabby hoping that they wouldn’t be able to hack Era in its low powered mode. Without access to the main server, it shouldn’t be able to give away any of her secrets either. Gabby assuming that was how it found out about her connection to Nick, through whatever files they had saved about her and her previous missions.\nWhile Era searched the area, Gabby called their base. “Our enemies are getting stronger.

        "story": "People called Intricate and no-nonsense hero. She was not a fan of that label.\nFor the first part, she considered most of her life to be nonsense. In a rational world, she wouldn't be speeding around on a motorbike in spandex punching other spandex clad villains as they tried to take over the city. A no-nonsense person, she figured, would be filing their taxes in early March as opposed to fighting crime.\nSecond of all, she tried to have fun on the job. She was riding a motorcycle for goodness sake. Who could say that a motorcycle was the most practical form of transportation! If she weren't fun loving and self indulgent, she would be taking public transport around the city. That would be helping solve the falling ridership issue, and securing funding for public transit might be more critical to the city than punching any villain.\nIn, as far as Intricate understood, she was a fun-loving, nonsense filled hero, just as much as anyone else. Okay, maybe not as much as 'everyone else' but many of them were just plain unprofessional!\nAside from bristling against the no-nonsense label, Intricate had also found that it made her life, marginally harder. Villains seemed convinced that they were running out of time when she showed up. They objectively were,  but they were more frantic than they were when they fought other heroes.\nShe'd seen videos of the famous showdowns, everyone had. The villains talked, they japed, they showed off. Intricate? Intricate got none of that. It was straight to business when she showed up.\nBack at the start, villains had tried talking through their fights, but, it'd literally fallen on deaf ears.\nMaybe that was what made people think she was no-nonsense. She couldn't take fun, after battle, interviews because there were rarely interpreters around after a fight. Logically they ran away once the building-chunks started flying.\nThat no-nonsense label was also why Intricate was sitting on her bed, in her 'Miranda' clothes considering whether she was going to get dressed for the day of crime fighting. She read the news. She understood how brand deals worked.\nShe liked protecting people, loved it even, it filled her with purpose, but at the same time... reading that the city you protect doesn't like you is never a good way to start the morning.\nBut she'd gotten the call, people needed help. So she'd get ready as she always did. One glove at a time, and in the peace and quiet.\n....\nBy the time Intricate reached the scene of the crime, chaos had already ensued, past tense. She was late. Now there were police scattered around the bank using their cruises as shields and keeping an eye on the main door. There was only one way in or out of the central bank. Whoever was in there would have to fight they way out.\nIntricate pulled up to the scene and hopped off her motorcycle. The first thing she caught in the corner of her eyes was someone rolling theirs. She frowned. Allowed herself an extended blink, then moved on. Marching toward the door without knowing what was going on inside.\nPerhaps that was part of her label as well, Intricate's armor was nigh-invincible, and means that she was able to simply walk at most threats. She started up the steps then turned and waved the police officers further back.\nThey didn't move.\nIntricate tried again with, what she feared, was too much enthusiasm. She wanted them to get to safe distance, not to think she was telling them to shoo.\nShe was too far in her head, it was probably fine.\nIntricate entered the bank, tossing the door open and marching into the foyer. In the dead centre of the room was a villain that she didn'tm recognize.\nMost cities had a rogue's gallery of a sort. Sure, they got locked away, but there were only so many powers in a population and keeping them in jail was a pain in the ass. That all to say, it was a rare novelty to see an unknown on a crime scene.\nThe woman, villain, opened her mouth and clearly said something. She was only wearing half a mask so Intricate, in theory, had a chance to read her lips, but she'd never been good at that. A second later, the woman stopped and scanned Intricate.\nShe was never, so Intricate gave her the moment to do so.\nThen another novelty.\n\"Intricate, it's a pleasure.\" the woman signed. Intricate stared for a moment. She knew the words enough to understand them, but was too distracted by what the hell was going on to process them. She only had the common response to this revelation.\n\"You sign?\" Intricate ask.\n\"Obviously.\" the woman retorted. The signs were somewhat hard to read, a mix of rough gestures and the multicolored costume contrasted with her dark skin. Too much extra visual noise.\n\"I'm going to stop you.\" Intricate signed back. She took a deep breath, but instead of moving right into a fight, the woman kept signing.\n\"You're going to stop me? How adorable. Don't you know how long I've planned this heist for?\"\n\"No?\"\n\"Months. Months I've been waiting to come onto the scene and fight you. The woman who's been putting all the other villains to shame.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"This heist? A minor distraction.\" The woman started pacing as she signed. \"I'm not here for the money. I'm not here for the lock boxes, Intricate. I'm here to prove a point.\"\nFor the first time in front of a villain, Intricate asked a question out of curiosity. \"What point?\"\n\"That the old generation of heroes is sloppy. They're too reliant on the rules of the game. On getting their time to monologue. On showmanship. Pomp. Circumstance. Mercy.\" She let the last sign drag, waggling her dominant hand. \"But you? You're different. You've punished them for their monologues and games. By beating you I'll show them the new way of doing things.

Until she got a kiss from her true love her kingdom would not prosper. Now the kingdom wasn’t failing by any means, but it was far from doing well. ‘Just scraping by’ as the advisors had put it. Unfortunately, ‘just scraping by’ was not enough to protect us from war. So the king and queen had called out for dam near every prince in the land to kiss her. They called for single kings and polyamorous ones. The summoned nobles from all over but still nothing. She must have been kissing a hundred men a day at one point. Her lips were chapped and her mood was lower than ever. And most of these men weren’t even gracious enough to make the kiss small. A simple peck would do by the wording of the curse, but no. They had to make it a full make out session. They had to get handsy and they just had to go to far. Almost every time I would have to pull them off and send them running. The king and queen were getting so desperate they had started calling on the lower class. But I knew all this would be in vain, you see, she didn’t like men. The princess was into women yet we all knew how that would end up. Enough princesses had been abandoned and rejected to tell us that revealing that secret would be a bad idea. But I couldn’t watch my kingdom suffer in fear of the war to come. Other kingdoms were becoming emboldened and our allies were becoming distant. If we couldn’t help them, why should they help us. It was only a matter of time, so I put out my own call. Albeit quieter than the other one. I put out a call to all the lost princesses. Together, the princess and I would sneak out of the castle every night to meet one of them. They would talk, get to know one another and if there was a spark, they would kiss. The curse had still not been lifted, but the princess’ mood had already lifted. She had hope, we both did. And we were making life long friendships along the way. She was also very happy to be kissing a tonne of beautiful, respectful women instead of hideous men. But where the true love’s kiss came from was a shock to us all.\nIt was another evening. We had ten more men from the army lined up to shoot their shot, but the princess was nowhere to be found. We all went searching together, looking in her room, in bathrooms and eventually in servants quarters.\nWhen we did find her, she was locked in a broom closet with a maid. The king opened the door and gasped in shock and horror. I saw the two of them Break from what had obviously been a very passionate kiss, gasping. But then, before anyone could say anything, a bright light bathed us all. The princess started floating and we all had to turn away. When the light died down we all turned back to the princess and the maid looking nervously at the king. He too a while to speak.\n“The words of a spell can never be false,” he said carefully, “if this is your true love then so be it.” The relief that spread across our faces overpowered any horror the suitors showed. The king took the maids hands.\n“You have saved my kingdom from this dreaded curse.

Until she got a kiss from her true love her kingdom would not prosper. Now the kingdom wasn’t failing by any means, but it was far from doing well. ‘Just scraping by’ as the advisors had put it. Unfortunately, ‘just scraping by’ was not enough to protect us from war. So the king and queen had called out for dam near every prince in the land to kiss her. They called for single kings and polyamorous ones. The summoned nobles from all over but still nothing. She must have been kissing a hundred men a day at one point. Her lips were chapped and her mood was lower than ever. And most of these men weren’t even gracious enough to make the kiss small. A simple peck would do by the wording of the curse, but no. They had to make it a full make out session. They had to get handsy and they just had to go to far. Almost every time I would have to pull them off and send them running. The king and queen were getting so desperate they had started calling on the lower class. But I knew all this would be in vain, you see, she didn’t like men.

The curse had still not been lifted, but the princess’ mood had already lifted. She had hope, we both did. And we were making life long friendships along the way. She was also very happy to be kissing a tonne of beautiful, respectful women instead of hideous men. But where the true love’s kiss came from was a shock to us all.\nIt was another evening. We had ten more men from the army lined up to shoot their shot, but the princess was nowhere to be found. We all went searching together, looking in her room, in bathrooms and eventually in servants quarters.\nWhen we did find her, she was locked in a broom closet with a maid.

        "story": "\\[Time In. Time Out.\\]\n“I got away with it…,” Steel Bullet laughed to himself as he said it out loud. There was no one around to hear him. Not on the windy, frigid mountain peak. After the trial was dismissed, he asked for some time alone and everyone thought they understood. It was a reasonable request after the constant attention. What none of them knew was that he wanted to celebrate because everything had gone his way. \nSteel Bullet the hero had murdered literally thousands of people by now, and that only amounted to a few charges out of the dozens brought against him. He had plenty of vocal support in the league, and a strong case in the court of public opinion. There were cheers in the streets when the judge dismissed the case on the grounds that he was a certified hero doing his job, and he couldn't be expected to control collateral damage from villain attacks. No one could prove he watched and intentionally let buildings fall on people. No matter how often it seemed to happen.\n“I should change it up a bit though…, “ he realized there would still be some scrutiny on him in the short term at least.  “...maybe take a break altogether.” He knew he wouldn't, but it was the thought that counted. For a brief instant, he considered changing his ways even if only temporarily. He might have gotten away with it, but could he really keep pushing his luck like that? After the short thought experiment, he decided that yes. He was after all, invincible. And now that included the figurative sense too. \nThen, as soon as his commitment to violence was renewed, he blinked. Something about that particular time felt different than the dozens of other tones he'd already blinked just facing down the cold, biting wind. He couldn't put his finger on why it was different other than the fact that he noticed the action. And, of course, the teenage girl with white and orange hair that stood in front of him when he opened his eyes. She wasn't there when started the blink. She introduced herself before Steel Bullet could ask anything; but, not before he realized he couldn't. \n“Hi, I'm Quinn, and I don't want to be here, so we're going somewhere warmer,” she made a dismissive gesture at him, then he blinked again. This time, he opened his eyes to see a golden sunset taking place behind Quinn. The sun was resting on the ocean horizon, and he could hear the gentle waves. “This is much better…,” she nodded.  “So, you probably have questions, and you've noticed you can't ask them.” He tried, unsuccessfully, to nod at least. His body refused to follow his instructions. \n“Chroma Corp. sent me to deal with you. I haven't decided how to do that yet. I know, I know, you've never heard of Chroma Corp., right?“ she asked rhetorically. \n“The short answer is they are the corporation that paid off the judge to dismiss your case. The reason they did that is because you're stupid guilty and basically a horrible person,” she giggled at him with a smile. It was the first time she'd shown any warmth toward him and it was an insult. \n“So, the issue is Chroma Corp. is about to buy up the Super League on your Earth, and your demented hobbies are nothing but bad press. I'm gonna let you talk now, if you're willing to be calm and civil about it. You with me so far?” she asked. \nSteel Bullet felt like he had his voice again. He could wiggle his fingers and even feel the warm breeze on his skin. He hadn't noticed it until that moment, and he didn't waste any time. As soon as he was sure he could move, he flew forward at top speed determined to put a fist through her head. He chose his name because instant acceleration was the main aspect of his super power. The super strength and steel-tough skin were more like bonuses. But, despite how fast he moved, somehow he still had time to blink in mid-flight. \nWhen he opened his eyes his fist was a half inch away from Quinn's sparkling orange eyes. \n“Well, I guess that makes things simpler for me,” She shrugged. “Thanks for helping me choose the best way to deal with you. But, uh…,”  she glanced around the beach. “Not here.”. \nSteel Bullet blinked again and they were somewhere else. A dank, dim cave. It would have been pitch black if it wasn't for the digital clock affixed to the cave wall directly in his view with glowing orange numbers. Though. It was only four zeroes on the far right on the long clock, completely off center on the display. \n“So, you probably haven't figured it out yet, but I can control time. Right now, I've time-locked your entire body. You don't even have to breathe, but I'm letting your mind, eyes and ears still work so we can have this conversation. Every time you blink, like so…, “ he blinked as she made the comment. “...this timer will show you how much time you missed.”  she pointed at it and the time now read ‘00:14’.  “That's fourteen seconds. Or, we can go longer. \nThis time he opened his eyes and the timer said, '02:39’. \n“Got it? Good,” Quinn giggled.  “So, here's the punishment, I'm gonna give you time to think about what you've done. I'm going to leave you here for a little while, no idea how long,” she shrugged. “Don't worry you won't die or anything.  But, I want you to really take it slow and THINK about the things you've done. So, I'm going to force slow thinking… like this.”\nSteel Bullet blinked and opened his eyes 10 minutes later according to the clock. \n“Randomly. Every now and then, your time will stop fully. And a random amount of time will pass before it starts again. I think that's all the effort on want to put onto this, so I'm leaving now. I've given you the basics on how it works. Good luck! “ Quinn waved with a smile.\n“Oh, by the way, don't worry about a thing. None of your friends will worry about you. We already have another version of you lined up from an alternate universe ready to step in as ‘Steel Bullet’, but nicer. You've already built an amazing reputation. From a business perspective, it's a shame to let that go to waste. Bye!” she disappeared as easily as Steel Bullet was teleported to different locations. \nIt was a lot to take in but he wished he had a chance to ask questions. All he was left with were his own thoughts. \n“Did she say alternate universe?” he asked himself, then blinked. He opened his eyes three hours later. \n“What the fu-,” he blinked.  48 hours went by before he opened his eyes again. \n“Uccckkkkkkkkkk.”.",

Something about that particular time felt different than the dozens of other tones he'd already blinked just facing down the cold, biting wind.

Good,” Quinn giggled.  “So, here's the punishment, I'm gonna give you time to think about what you've done. I'm going to leave you here for a little while, no idea how long,” she shrugged. “Don't worry you won't die or anything.  But, I want you to really take it slow and THINK about the things you've done.

And a random amount of time will pass before it starts again. I think that's all the effort on want to put onto this, so I'm leaving now. I've given you the basics on how it works.

After the trial was dismissed, he asked for some time alone and everyone thought they understood. It was a reasonable request after the constant attention. What none of them knew was that he wanted to celebrate because everything had gone his way. \nSteel Bullet the hero had murdered literally thousands of people by now, and that only amounted to a few charges out of the dozens brought against him. He had plenty of vocal support in the league, and a strong case in the court of public opinion. There were cheers in the streets when the judge dismissed the case on the grounds that he was a certified hero doing his job, and he couldn't be expected to control collateral damage from villain attacks. No one could prove he watched and intentionally let buildings fall on people. No matter how often it seemed to happen.\n“I should change it up a bit though…, “ he realized there would still be some scrutiny on him in the short term at least.  “...maybe take a break altogether.” He knew he wouldn't, but it was the thought that counted. For a brief instant, he considered changing his ways even if only temporarily. He might have gotten away with it, but could he really keep pushing his luck like that? After the short thought experiment, he decided that yes. He was after all, invincible. And now that included the figurative sense too. \nThen, as soon as his commitment to violence was renewed, he blinked. Something about that particular time felt different than the dozens of other tones he'd already blinked just facing down the cold, biting wind. He couldn't put his finger on why it was different other than the fact that he noticed the action. And, of course, the teenage girl with white and orange hair that stood in front of him when he opened his eyes. She wasn't there when started the blink. She introduced herself before Steel Bullet could ask anything; but, not before he realized he couldn't. \n“Hi, I'm Quinn, and I don't want to be here, so we're going somewhere warmer,” she made a dismissive gesture at him, then he blinked again. This time, he opened his eyes to see a golden sunset taking place behind Quinn. The sun was resting on the ocean horizon, and he could hear the gentle waves. “This is much better…,” she nodded.  “So, you probably have questions, and you've noticed you can't ask them.” He tried, unsuccessfully, to nod at least. His body refused to follow his instructions. \n“Chroma Corp. sent me to deal with you. I haven't decided how to do that yet. I know, I know, you've never heard of Chroma Corp., right?“ she asked rhetorically. \n“The short answer is they are the corporation that paid off the judge to dismiss your case. The reason they did that is because you're stupid guilty and basically a horrible person,” she giggled at him with a smile. It was the first time she'd shown any warmth toward him and it was an insult. \n“So, the issue is Chroma Corp. is about to buy up the Super League on your Earth, and your demented hobbies are nothing but bad press. I'm gonna let you talk now, if you're willing to be calm and civil about it. You with me so far?” she asked. \nSteel Bullet felt like he had his voice again. He could wiggle his fingers and even feel the warm breeze on his skin. He hadn't noticed it until that moment, and he didn't waste any time. As soon as he was sure he could move, he flew forward at top speed determined to put a fist through her head. He chose his name because instant acceleration was the main aspect of his super power. The super strength and steel-tough skin were more like bonuses. But, despite how fast he moved, somehow he still had time to blink in mid-flight. \nWhen he opened his eyes his fist was a half inch away from Quinn's sparkling orange eyes. \n“Well, I guess that makes things simpler for me,” She shrugged. “Thanks for helping me choose the best way to deal with you. But, uh…,”  she glanced around the beach. “Not here.”. \nSteel Bullet blinked again and they were somewhere else. A dank, dim cave. It would have been pitch black if it wasn't for the digital clock affixed to the cave wall directly in his view with glowing orange numbers. Though. It was only four zeroes on the far right on the long clock, completely off center on the display. \n“So, you probably haven't figured it out yet, but I can control time. Right now, I've time-locked your entire body. You don't even have to breathe, but I'm letting your mind, eyes and ears still work so we can have this conversation.

        "story": "Then I just fired. And the soldier was down.\nA bomb went out in the farm. Fragments of armor, flesh, and weapons flew through the air, painting the sky red, putrid smell assaulting the soldiers, that turned out to run, panicking.\nMy father just shot three more, not fatally. The wounded cries and pleas for mercy were more than sufficient to make others surrender on the spot, turn out their weapons, or simply run away, crying like little boys they were.\nWe found out by interrogating the prisoners: the war. The experiments. The new soldiers, the new order, the new chaos, the new government, and how everybody lost everything. They told stories about mercenaries, and immortals, and super-intelligent computers that could predict anything.\nAnd how we, being so \"outside of society\", were a risk for the computer. They couldn't understand our ways, predict our actions.\nThey could not control us. Because we were not part of the pack.\nWars were now quick - the ones with better weapons would win in an instant, vaporizing everybody in seconds. The weapons took a long time to charge, but they were quick and effective, and could shot three times, although usually one was enough.\nEvery nano-element was fine-tuned to resist these new super-weapons, so they had basically no protection against good ol' gunpowder. We didn't know that, of course; we also didn't know that this whole \"vaporizing enemies\" was actually literal - people disappearing on the spot where in less than a second.\nThat's why they were scarred and flew from us - our weapons were \"cruel\", and we forced them to see what we really are - and what *they* really are - just humans.\nOr maybe not.\nThe more they talked, the more we felt we were the last \"real humans\" on the planet. They talked crazy stuff about no free-will or privacy or desires - the \"Corporation\", how they called their new Empire, decided on what people would desire, want, and buy. Fine-tuned propaganda, subliminal messages fine-tuned for specific people and population to keep the status quo.\nIt didn't help that most humans were genetic-engineered now to have immunity to most diseases, and that food was grown in such a way to keep the perfect balanced diet and still taste like chocolate. Sure, there were some undocumented side-effects, like being more susceptible to the messages and to obey orders... but who would care? Humanity was better than ever, and for sure they just had to won *this last war* and then everything would be fine...\nAn ex-soldier begged us to take him with us. To escape that horrible world, to a simpler time, where humans were humans and wars were unheard of. We left the others tied to our house, and left with the begging one.\nPacked lightly, but with our close guns ready, we walked. Through the valley, to the river. We ate, and we talked, and we explained things.\nAlways aware. Always looking for something we knew was going to appear.\nAnd appear, it did. Unfortunately for the beggar, I saw that.\nHe was as dead as he was smiling, a moment earlier. Dad knew it was a trap. Of course, I knew it too - but that would distract the others.\nFor this was not our route. Our was a secret one, away from prying eyes. One that only we knew, deep down in the forest, for those who still knew which animals to greet, and which to avoid.\nOne full of traps that only the trained eye could see. Our trained eyes.\nSo we marched, without resting, to a new tomorrow, hearing the cries of whatever humanity became dying around us, victim of us, victim of themselves, succumbed to fear.\nWe still marched, for another centuries of exile. We marched, to hide, so that one day, humanity could flourish again - from tradition, farming, brass, and gunpowder.",

In it was a slightly ruined and damaged book. \"The first words sound so, good.\"\nThe judge read the first few lines aloud. \"By these teachings and in the eyes of the gods, I swear to never use my blade and teachings to cause undue harm and pain of others. I will freely give of my skill to the mending of body and healing of ills. I shall persevere to never abuse those under my care for any reason.\" Judge Walker than looked at several marked pages. \"Threads good for sewing up skin, knots and ties, even ways of cleaning a wound. It'sa medical textbook.\"\nThe sheriff just turned hearing that. \"He's no witch, but a doctor? Bull!!\"\n\"My sister lives, healed. I disobeyed my people to save her life. I do not regret it. I would obey my oath here too.\"\nThe judge just gave a soft scoff. \"The lizard doctor, Sisst. Might not be so bad. This town could use a doctor.\"",

Mr Holmes laid with his head pillowed on his partner’s belly and his long legs crossed, one foot braced on the armrest, reading a book regarding the various critters found in the seas and oceans while Dr Watson amused himself by reading The Lancet and caressing with a casual touch his husband’s now longer, soft greying hair.\nAs Mr Sherlock Holmes let the book fall on his chest still open and stretched, slightly lifting his body leaning on his shoulders and foot and moaning softly, Dr Watson chuckled, bringing his hand lower to caress his high cheekbone. “Has the great Sherlock Holmes tired of the creatures of the oceans?” He asked playfully.\nHolmes moaned again, angling his head to look his partner in the eye. “Not yet. – He grinned. – Not until you will accompany me for a swim in mornings.”\nBoth men laughed as the doctor assured his detective to be very much of a dry land creature.\n“Yet you are so pretty when you swim, so at ease…” Admired the detective, capturing his husband’s hand to press a kiss on its back.\n“You old flatterer. – Admonished Watson playfully, kissing Holmes’ hand as well. – Food for thoughts?”\nHolmes’ often severe features were brightened by an impish grin. “You perhaps mean ‘case for thoughts’, dear fellow. – He joked. – I’m thinking… of Oysters.” He smirked.\nWatson huffed. “Really Holmes, not Oysters again, I beg of you.”\nTickled by his partner’s slight annoyance the detective smirked and continued, a playful smile on his thin lips. “But consider! Bivalves and monovalves aside, consider how pearls are made! If the seafloor were-”\nDr Watson snorted again, tugging slightly at his husband’s hair and interrupting him. “General rehearsal for your monograph on malingering?” He smiled, only half as much annoyed as he pretended to be.\n“Ah, you got the true strength of my acting in that case! No, no, Watson, I’m considering how the layers of Mother of Pearl can cover basically anything!” Continued Holmes, enthusiastically.\nDr Watson smiled and rolled up his paper to playfully tap his husband head. “Are you going to claim merits as a housekeeper over getting oysters for dinner again, my love?” He smiled, a hand already trailing down his husband’s side.\nOnce he had arrived at the level of his waist, Holmes squeaked and jumped up to perch himself on the couch’s armrest. “Those are forbidden tactics!” He laughed.\nThe doctor grinned back. “Just as oysters are a banned topic!”\nHolmes’ grin widened. “But imagine! A whole bed of oysters! Anything could get trapped by their valves! Too slow!” He grinned, jumping out of the couch and on Watson’s armchair to escape the playful swat with the rolled up paper!\n“Come down here you eel!” Laughed the doctor.\n“Anything! Maybe so many oysters could cover a the whole floor in mother of pearl! Slow, John, slow!” Grinned the detective after jumping from the armchair back to the couch and from that to his own armchair.\nWatson grinned again. “I’m not putting any effort in this, dear husband! – He warned, then gasped as he saw his man climbing on the armchair’s backrest and perching himself there. – You’re a damn squirrel!”\n“From fish to mammal, interesting transition! – He laughed. – Imagine, a fish mistakenly entering an oyste-”\nAs Holmes talked, his balance faltered and he fell back on the floor, right into his husband’s arms.\n“Yes, my dear cat? A fish swimming into an oyster?” Breathed the doctor right into his ear, a laugh in his voice.\n“He would get trapped, my love. Trapped in Mother of Pearl, fated to die and be embedded in that beautiful substance.”\nDr Watson laughed, squeezing his Holmes tight. “And this, my dear fish, is what happens to fishes who think themselves oh so clever.” He murmured, his mouth moving on what was visible of his husband’s neck to leave small kisses, his hands finding the hem of his wool vest and slipping inside it, working to tease his shirt out of his trousers.\n“And what would that be, my delicious bear?” Grinned the detective, basking in his husband’s kisses and melting in his strong hold.\nWatson smiled against his Holmes’ neck and put there yet another kiss, careful not to leave any mark, and then as his hands finally managed to slip under his shirt. “The punishment for talking of oysters, my sleuth hound.” He grinned planting his fingers in the most ticklish spot of his husband’s slim sides.\nHolmes squeaked, curling on himself in the useless attempt to escape Watson’s vice-like hold. “Joooohn! John please!” He yelped between laughter.\nThe doctor laughed together with him, holding him up in position, almost lifting him from the ground. “Oh my dear, dear Sherlock. – He grinned, flexing his fingers and delighting in his husband’s yowls of laughter. – You knew of the consequences, my love!”",

        "story": "Under the soft glow of the hearth fire in their cozy hut on the borders of Doriath, Beleg and Túrin once more found solace and comfort in each other's presence, as they often did when the world did not demand their attention. The flames cast dancing shadows across the room, creating an ambiance of warmth and intimacy.\nTúrin sat cross-legged on the rug before the hearth, his back propped against a stack of cushions, his eyes fixed on the flickering flames. Beleg was sprawled out beside him, his head resting in Túrin's lap. His silvery hair, a stark contrast to the rich tones of the rug, flowed like a river of moonlight.\nTúrin's fingers idly traced patterns through Beleg's hair, combing through the silken strands. It was a soothing ritual, one that had become second nature to them. Beleg closed his eyes, a contented sigh escaping his lips as he relished in the sensation.\nThe night beyond the windows was cold and dark, but within their hut, a cocoon of warmth and affection enveloped them. The hearth crackled and popped, radiating a gentle heat that banished the chill from the room.\n\"Tell me a story,\" Túrin whispered, his voice soft like the rustling leaves in a gentle breeze. \"Please?\"\nBeleg's lips curved into a smile even though his eyes remained closed. \"Very well. What kind of story would you like to hear tonight, my love?\"\nTúrin's fingers continued their rhythmic dance through Beleg's hair as he contemplated. \"Tell me of a great adventure, one where heroes rise against insurmountable odds.\"\n\"So it shall be,\" Beleg began, his voice a soothing murmur. \"Once upon a time, in a land not so different from our own, there lived a valiant hero named… Túrin. He was known throughout the realm for his bravery and unyielding spirit, even though he was a bit stubborn and reckless.\"\nTúrin chuckled softly. \"Go on.\"\n\"Yet, even the bravest of heroes have their moments of doubt,\" Beleg continued. \"And so it was that Túrin found himself facing a formidable foe, a dragon of immense size and power.\"\nTúrin's fingers stilled in Beleg's hair, his eyes focused on the imaginary world his lover was weaving with his words. \"How did he defeat the dragon?\"\n\"Ah, patience. That is the heart of the tale,\" Beleg replied. \"Túrin knew that he could not conquer the dragon through strength alone. So, he embarked on a quest to find the dragon's secret weakness, a vulnerability that even the mightiest of beasts possessed.\"\nAs Beleg's storytelling continued, the room seemed to fade away, and Túrin found himself immersed in the adventure. He listened with rapt attention, his mind painting vivid images of the hero's journey, the dragon, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil.\nOutside, the wind whispered secrets to the trees, but within their hut, Beleg's voice was the only sound that mattered. The flames in the hearth danced to the rhythm of the story, casting ever-shifting shadows on the walls.\nAs Beleg's tale neared its conclusion, Túrin felt a profound sense of contentment wash over him. The world beyond their walls could be chaotic and unforgiving, but here, in their little haven, it wouldn’t reach them.\n\"And so,\" Beleg concluded, \"Túrin, armed with the knowledge of the dragon's weakness, faced the beast one final time. He waited for a fortunate moment to strike and, with a heart full of courage and determination, he struck true and thus brought an end to the reign of terror.\"\nTúrin smiled down at Beleg, his heart filled with admiration and love. \"Thank you for this story. Though I think it would do Túrin good if he had someone to rely on by his side, perhaps someone called Beleg?\"\nBeleg opened his eyes and gazed at Túrin with a tender expression, though worry was beginning to creep in. \"Then you might as well make this story a future prediction. We do not know if or when Morgoth will let his worms loose against us.\"\nLeaning down, Túrin captured Beleg's lips in a gentle kiss, a testament to the love that bound them together. Their lips met with a soft and lingering sweetness, like the taste of honey on a crisp autumn morning.\n\"Then we will meet those creatures head on and rise triumphant, just how the hero in your story did,\" Túrin whispered against his lover's lips.\nAs they pulled away, Túrin settled back against the cushions, his fingers resuming their gentle caresses through Beleg's hair. The fire continued to burn brightly, casting a warm and inviting glow over their sanctuary.\nFinally, another undisturbed evening that was theirs alone to enjoy.",

        "story": "Under the soft glow of the hearth fire in their cozy hut on the borders of Doriath, Beleg and Túrin once more found solace and comfort in each other's presence, as they often did when the world did not demand their attention. The flames cast dancing shadows across the room, creating an ambiance of warmth and intimacy.\nTúrin sat cross-legged on the rug before the hearth, his back propped against a stack of cushions, his eyes fixed on the flickering flames. Beleg was sprawled out beside him, his head resting in Túrin's lap. His silvery hair, a stark contrast to the rich tones of the rug, flowed like a river of moonlight.\nTúrin's fingers idly traced patterns through Beleg's hair, combing through the silken strands. It was a soothing ritual, one that had become second nature to them. Beleg closed his eyes, a contented sigh escaping his lips as he relished in the sensation.\nThe night beyond the windows was cold and dark, but within their hut, a cocoon of warmth and affection enveloped them. The hearth crackled and popped, radiating a gentle heat that banished the chill from the room.\n\"Tell me a story,\" Túrin whispered, his voice soft like the rustling leaves in a gentle breeze. \"Please?\"\nBeleg's lips curved into a smile even though his eyes remained closed. \"Very well. What kind of story would you like to hear tonight, my love?\"\nTúrin's fingers continued their rhythmic dance through Beleg's hair as he contemplated. \"Tell me of a great adventure, one where heroes rise against insurmountable odds.\"\n\"So it shall be,\" Beleg began, his voice a soothing murmur. \"Once upon a time, in a land not so different from our own, there lived a valiant hero named… Túrin. He was known throughout the realm for his bravery and unyielding spirit, even though he was a bit stubborn and reckless.\"\nTúrin chuckled softly. \"Go on.\"\n\"Yet, even the bravest of heroes have their moments of doubt,\" Beleg continued. \"And so it was that Túrin found himself facing a formidable foe, a dragon of immense size and power.\"\nTúrin's fingers stilled in Beleg's hair, his eyes focused on the imaginary world his lover was weaving with his words. \"How did he defeat the dragon?\"\n\"Ah, patience. That is the heart of the tale,\" Beleg replied. \"Túrin knew that he could not conquer the dragon through strength alone. So, he embarked on a quest to find the dragon's secret weakness, a vulnerability that even the mightiest of beasts possessed.\"\nAs Beleg's storytelling continued, the room seemed to fade away, and Túrin found himself immersed in the adventure. He listened with rapt attention, his mind painting vivid images of the hero's journey, the dragon, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil.\nOutside, the wind whispered secrets to the trees, but within their hut, Beleg's voice was the only sound that mattered. The flames in the hearth danced to the rhythm of the story, casting ever-shifting shadows on the walls.\nAs Beleg's tale neared its conclusion, Túrin felt a profound sense of contentment wash over him. The world beyond their walls could be chaotic and unforgiving, but here, in their little haven, it wouldn’t reach them.\n\"And so,\" Beleg concluded, \"Túrin, armed with the knowledge of the dragon's weakness, faced the beast one final time. He waited for a fortunate moment to strike and, with a heart full of courage and determination, he struck true and thus brought an end to the reign of terror.\"\nTúrin smiled down at Beleg, his heart filled with admiration and love. \"Thank you for this story. Though I think it would do Túrin good if he had someone to rely on by his side, perhaps someone called Beleg?\"\nBeleg opened his eyes and gazed at Túrin with a tender expression, though worry was beginning to creep in. \"Then you might as well make this story a future prediction.

        "writing_prompt": "A storm rages outside, but the true tempest brews within the castle walls as Prince Aemond seeks you out, guilt and tension heavy in the air after a heated argument. Will the storm outside mirror the one between you, or will the calm finally break through?",
        "story": "The afternoon air was thick with tension and dripping destruction, though you seemed to be none the wiser. So swept up were you, in the beauty of deep blue skies and the path of charcoal gray clouds as they passed by on the warm wind. The parchment balanced on your knee was half forgotten, the pot of ink and writing quill sitting on the windowsill as a mere figment, now. A storm must be brewing over the sea, and you wondered if you would experience it before night fell and sleep welcomed you with wide open arms.\nPrince Aemond was many things, on many occasions, for many people. He was calculating, yet\ntempered\n. Unforgiving, attentive.\nImpulsive\n, and intelligent. He was\nwild\n, yet subtlety - veiled or otherwise - had proven to be a quality that he had shown little interest in practicing. It was something he never seemed to regret, even if it meant spiraling petty feuds into further disarray, or simply tugging on fraying threads during family dinners that lead to hurled threats and slamming doors. It was a little cocoon of his own making, this calmly crafted life of controlled chaos.\nYet you were the exception - both you\nand\nHeleana - until, of course, it was only you that remained shielded no longer.\nYou were oblivious, in your daydreams, to the chaos raging fierce and strong in your own home - until the door to your rooms flew open to\ncrack\nsharply on the wall behind.\nAemond didn’t expect to find you here. With the evening promising rain and fury, he assumed you’d be enjoying the fresh air as long as time allowed,\nbut\n. He had come here to breathe, yet the irritation simmering slow and hot and vicious under his skin craved a release of any kind, as it always does.\nRegret\nwas hardly an intimate word for Aemond, yet it lingered, unyielding, clouding his mind once the red melted from his vision and his blackened heart returned to gold.\nThe way he’d allowed his lack of care to send you slamming the door to your apartments as you left him -\nfuming\n, in the wake of your own reciprocated wrath - well. It left him feeling anything other than comfort.\nIt was a whirlwind in the flesh, truly, the tense words he had flung to bite at your heart. Cold, calm fury battered them aside, broke through the weakening shield Aemond held fast around himself in an excuse to project without circumstance. Without consequence.

You tore it off with a simple tug, flourished the fabric in such a way that it clung to the Prince himself, the villain in this particular instance, but not a villain at heart.\nAemond was left staring where you had once been; a window that was open, brilliant view of the darkening sky echoing behind you, the sole outlet for the latest qualm that had been one push, one prod, one irrelevant instance too far - because,\nwell\n.\nAs collected as he usually was, there was always\nsomething\nthat would push anyone over the edge.\nRegardless, he had never once abandoned the training grounds to take his ire out on you.

Familiarity took you into its arms under the soft light of candles guttering in the fresh stir of air - rarely, did anyone come here at this hour. The knowledge that you wouldn’t be disturbed tempered your fire.\nThe sigh that left your lips was ragged. Shaken.\nHurt\n.\nThis was something new from Aemond - something that made you wonder\nwhat\nin the\nseven hells\njust\nhappened\n.\nYour feet carried you to the nearest window, and the breeze that met your skin was a soft caress tasting of salt and comfort - probably - since that was something you would not be receiving anytime soon, you imagined. Not from the one you wished, at least.\nHe made that\nquite fucking clear\n, actually.\nThe drawl of distant rumbling welcomed you as you journeyed farther into the room, fingers trailing along the old wooden tables in your wake. The emptiness was peaceful, the candlelight warm and soft in stark contrast with the scene you just left to simmer. You went to the windows, drawing them in tight, before the rain could intrude where it did not belong.\nAnger was a fickle thing,\nyou thought, turning a corner. The goal was to become lost in the maze of shelves piled high with long forgotten crumbling volumes. To find a tome that caught your eye in the looming shadows, then settle in with it while you tucked yourself up into one of the few window seats with the raging sea below as your steadfast companion.\nYou’d stay here with your false peace until your eyes drifted closed and your head leaned against rain spattered glass. Unless, of course, you were confident that retracing your steps to venture back wouldn’t reignite what brought you here in the first place. Perhaps then, you would be cooled enough to seek each other’s company, as your heart so longed to do, even now.\nEven so, the distant rumbling grew louder with each page you turned. Rain crackled into the glass as the wind whipped past. The more you read, the pages became even more brown and stiff as they slowly shared with you their age.\nThe storm, once far out of your sight, seemed to be right on top of you now as it unleashed its fury hard and strong and fast as it battered itself again and again and\nagain\nagainst the city below, and punished the castle walls themselves.\nIt was because of this, that every sound coming from within was, of course, as good as silent.\n“I thought I’d find you here.”\nHis voice filled what little lull a storm of this magnitude could give. It slid over your skin, soft as silk, slipped in through the little cracks along with the rain and wind and thunder alike.\nPrince Aemond stood in the glow of torchlight, illuminated wholly in the warm caress of flickering flame. He remained some distance from you, mindful of the space you held both for yourself, and, more pressingly - the distance you created when he pushed you oh, so splendidly away earlier that evening.\n“Well,” your eyes slid away from the prince, to instead find the paragraph they had been pulled away from. Your next words were spoken idly, if not with remnants of\nferocity\ncoating them as you resumed reading. “You\ndo\nknow where I like to hide.”\nAemond shifts his weight - it’s caught out the corner of your eye - and a shadow promptly slips across you to blanket the words on the pages. It was, by design, a darkness you weren’t able to see through, not with the storm outside batting aside the sun’s dying rays with its gray clouds and veils of rain.\nIntentional\n.\n“So you\nare\nhiding from me.”\n“‘\nHide\n’ is not the word I would use.”\n“Isn’t it?”\nThe book snapped shut in your hands on a sigh dragged from the weary depths of your heart. They were both, unfortunately, swallowed by another rolling volley of thunder. The timing was so dramatic, so absolutely\nyou\n, that it wasn’t Aemond’s fault when it inspired a harsh roll of his eye.\nHe could be dramatic too, if only to distract you from the way his lips quirked, the flash of a smile threatening to show itself in the darkness, or in the shine of the firelight still kissing fragments of his skin. Aemond knew this wasn’t the time for jokes, yet even he could appreciate the irony of the trap\nhe\nlaid, and, quite gracefully, stepped right into.\nLightning forked through the sky on another crash of thunder, the flash cold in contrast to the warmth of the library. It was jarring, how the harsh, white light exposed everything, always, quickly and quietly before it melted back into the safety of blowing rain and raging waves.\nAnd yet, it was enough. Enough to see the tension weaving its way through Prince Aemond’s jaw, and the set of his shoulders. How he hid his hands behind his back, no doubt clasped and curled in an unbreakable grip. Aemond clearly found no comfort here tonight. He held himself wound tight - even more so, almost, than he did when all the eyes watched him while at court.\nYou, on the other hand, were relaxed, given the circumstances. Lounging comfortably in the window seat while allowing the peace and the stillness to wash over you in the place you felt safest in all of King’s Landing.\nGuilt\n, you realized, still sitting in his shadow.\nThis was what his guilt looked like.\nYou had wondered if Aemond could even feel such a thing.\n“No,” you answered his question slowly. Let the bite fade from your voice and fall into the storm. Let it melt back into nothing. “I believe I would choose ‘\nisolate\n’. I assumed neither one of us wanted that conversation to continue while clawing at each other’s throats, as we were.”\nAemond took a breath, inhaled loud and sharp in time with a sheet of rain being pushed against the windowpane. He looked away as you watched him, your feet uncurling from their place on the seat, the volume slipping through your fingers to rest beside you.\n“No,” he says, “I suppose you’re right.”\nYou stepped from the shadows and went to him, still hiding in the safety of the dark. He longed to reach for you, longed to feel your skin, warm from the fire, warm from the peace you always seemed to carve for yourself - but his fingertips were cold from the time he spent solitary in your rooms after you had gone. The fires burned to ashes as he tempered himself, once again, into honed steel that the prince sheathed - if only so he could see you again, without drawing blood once more. Now that he found you, he feared you would find only ice under his touch, instead of comfort.\nIt made his heart\nache\n.\nAnd\nyou\n-\nAemond shouldn’t have been surprised, when he found his fingers threaded through yours. A hand glided up to rest on his jaw, guiding it gently to face you. The fire was gone from your eyes, tension nowhere to be found in your body language. He could see in you, just how much you could read him, even when he said so little. Even when he said everything he didn’t mean.\n“Come on,” you took a step backwards toward the entrance, tugging on his hand as you did so. The corners of your lips quirked, the prelude of a small smile illuminating the shadows Aemond still hid in. “Let’s go brew some tea and…maybe we can talk.”\nHis head dips in agreement, oddly silent since he last spoke. It was almost as if…as if he wasn’t sure the words that wanted to spill out would be the right ones.\nKind\nones. Instead, his chilled fingers finally curled gently around your own.\nAll he can bring himself to say is, “Lead on, darling.”\nSo you do, leading him through gloomy shadows deepened by the storm, to hallways illuminated by torches, by lightning, by\nyou\n.",

So swept up were you, in the beauty of deep blue skies and the path of charcoal gray clouds as they passed by on the warm wind.

It was something he never seemed to regret, even if it meant spiraling petty feuds into further disarray, or simply tugging on fraying threads during family dinners that lead to hurled threats and slamming doors.

So swept up were you, in the beauty of deep blue skies and the path of charcoal gray clouds as they passed by on the warm wind.

A storm must be brewing over the sea, and you wondered if you would experience it before night fell and sleep welcomed you with wide open arms.\nPrince Aemond was many things, on many occasions, for many people. He was calculating, yet\ntempered\n. Unforgiving, attentive.\nImpulsive\n, and intelligent. He was\nwild\n, yet subtlety - veiled or otherwise - had proven to be a quality that he had shown little interest in practicing. It was something he never seemed to regret, even if it meant spiraling petty feuds into further disarray, or simply tugging on fraying threads during family dinners that lead to hurled threats and slamming doors. It was a little cocoon of his own making, this calmly crafted life of controlled chaos.\nYet you were the exception - both you\nand\nHeleana - until, of course, it was only you that remained shielded no longer.\nYou were oblivious, in your daydreams, to the chaos raging fierce and strong in your own home - until the door to your rooms flew open to\ncrack\nsharply on the wall behind.\nAemond didn’t expect to find you here. With the evening promising rain and fury, he assumed you’d be enjoying the fresh air as long as time allowed,\nbut\n. He had come here to breathe, yet the irritation simmering slow and hot and vicious under his skin craved a release of any kind, as it always does.\nRegret\nwas hardly an intimate word for Aemond, yet it lingered, unyielding, clouding his mind once the red melted from his vision and his blackened heart returned to gold.\nThe way he’d allowed his lack of care to send you slamming the door to your apartments as you left him -\nfuming\n, in the wake of your own reciprocated wrath - well. It left him feeling anything other than comfort.\nIt was a whirlwind in the flesh, truly, the tense words he had flung to bite at your heart. Cold, calm fury battered them aside, broke through the weakening shield Aemond held fast around himself in an excuse to project without circumstance. Without consequence. He hadn’t been able to draw blood of course, you knew him too well to know it wasn’t\nyou\nthat had cracked his everlasting dragonskin.\nYou, however, had always been a different story.\nArmed to the teeth with words that would puncture, pierce, cut to bleed and\ntwist\n, when pushed too hard, too far; a cloak of blame had been settled upon your shoulders, and it was not yours to bear. You tore it off with a simple tug, flourished the fabric in such a way that it clung to the Prince himself, the villain in this particular instance, but not a villain at heart.\nAemond was left staring where you had once been; a window that was open, brilliant view of the darkening sky echoing behind you, the sole outlet for the latest qualm that had been one push, one prod, one irrelevant instance too far - because,\nwell\n.\nAs collected as he usually was, there was always\nsomething\nthat would push anyone over the edge.\nRegardless, he had never once abandoned the training grounds to take his ire out on you. He sought only your company after all; a sun, a saint, an equal to temper what always tried to break through the rising tide.\nSeven\nfucking\nhells.\nIt wasn’t a surprise, when he did not follow you through your rooms, or down the glowing hall.\nSconces were being lit as a false twilight fell, the sweet, early arrival of blue hour inspired haste in the servants lighting your way to the library. The shadows were chased away, one by one; yet the shadow that still enveloped your path was not of nature’s doing, nor was it your own.\nWooden doors loomed before you, bracketed by torches bright and warm and welcoming. You had stalked all the way here you realized, swift and mindless in where your feet had been taking you. Anger still burned through your veins, when you pushed the door open with your whole body. Hinges groaned with the sudden movement jarring them awake.\nSilence engulfed you once the door fell shut. Familiarity took you into its arms under the soft light of candles guttering in the fresh stir of air - rarely, did anyone come here at this hour. The knowledge that you wouldn’t be disturbed tempered your fire.\nThe sigh that left your lips was ragged. Shaken.\nHurt\n.\nThis was something new from Aemond - something that made you wonder\nwhat\nin the\nseven hells\njust\nhappened\n.\nYour feet carried you to the nearest window, and the breeze that met your skin was a soft caress tasting of salt and comfort - probably - since that was something you would not be receiving anytime soon, you imagined. Not from the one you wished, at least.\nHe made that\nquite fucking clear\n, actually.\nThe drawl of distant rumbling welcomed you as you journeyed farther into the room, fingers trailing along the old wooden tables in your wake. The emptiness was peaceful, the candlelight warm and soft in stark contrast with the scene you just left to simmer. You went to the windows, drawing them in tight, before the rain could intrude where it did not belong.\nAnger was a fickle thing,\nyou thought, turning a corner. The goal was to become lost in the maze of shelves piled high with long forgotten crumbling volumes. To find a tome that caught your eye in the looming shadows, then settle in with it while you tucked yourself up into one of the few window seats with the raging sea below as your steadfast companion.\nYou’d stay here with your false peace until your eyes drifted closed and your head leaned against rain spattered glass. Unless, of course, you were confident that retracing your steps to venture back wouldn’t reignite what brought you here in the first place. Perhaps then, you would be cooled enough to seek each other’s company, as your heart so longed to do, even now.\nEven so, the distant rumbling grew louder with each page you turned. Rain crackled into the glass as the wind whipped past. The more you read, the pages became even more brown and stiff as they slowly shared with you their age.\nThe storm, once far out of your sight, seemed to be right on top of you now as it unleashed its fury hard and strong and fast as it battered itself again and again and\nagain\nagainst the city below, and punished the castle walls themselves.\nIt was because of this, that every sound coming from within was, of course, as good as silent.\n“I thought I’d find you here.”\nHis voice filled what little lull a storm of this magnitude could give. It slid over your skin, soft as silk, slipped in through the little cracks along with the rain and wind and thunder alike.\nPrince Aemond stood in the glow of torchlight, illuminated wholly in the warm caress of flickering flame. He remained some distance from you, mindful of the space you held both for yourself, and, more pressingly - the distance you created when he pushed you oh, so splendidly away earlier that evening.\n“Well,” your eyes slid away from the prince, to instead find the paragraph they had been pulled away from. Your next words were spoken idly, if not with remnants of\nferocity\ncoating them as you resumed reading. “You\ndo\nknow where I like to hide.”\nAemond shifts his weight - it’s caught out the corner of your eye - and a shadow promptly slips across you to blanket the words on the pages. It was, by design, a darkness you weren’t able to see through, not with the storm outside batting aside the sun’s dying rays with its gray clouds and veils of rain.\nIntentional\n.\n“So you\nare\nhiding from me.”\n“‘\nHide\n’ is not the word I would use.”\n“Isn’t it?”\nThe book snapped shut in your hands on a sigh dragged from the weary depths of your heart. They were both, unfortunately, swallowed by another rolling volley of thunder. The timing was so dramatic, so absolutely\nyou\n, that it wasn’t Aemond’s fault when it inspired a harsh roll of his eye.\nHe could be dramatic too, if only to distract you from the way his lips quirked, the flash of a smile threatening to show itself in the darkness, or in the shine of the firelight still kissing fragments of his skin. Aemond knew this wasn’t the time for jokes, yet even he could appreciate the irony of the trap\nhe\nlaid, and, quite gracefully, stepped right into.\nLightning forked through the sky on another crash of thunder, the flash cold in contrast to the warmth of the library. It was jarring, how the harsh, white light exposed everything, always, quickly and quietly before it melted back into the safety of blowing rain and raging waves.\nAnd yet, it was enough. Enough to see the tension weaving its way through Prince Aemond’s jaw, and the set of his shoulders. How he hid his hands behind his back, no doubt clasped and curled in an unbreakable grip. Aemond clearly found no comfort here tonight. He held himself wound tight - even more so, almost, than he did when all the eyes watched him while at court.\nYou, on the other hand, were relaxed, given the circumstances. Lounging comfortably in the window seat while allowing the peace and the stillness to wash over you in the place you felt safest in all of King’s Landing.\nGuilt\n, you realized, still sitting in his shadow.\nThis was what his guilt looked like.\nYou had wondered if Aemond could even feel such a thing.\n“No,” you answered his question slowly. Let the bite fade from your voice and fall into the storm. Let it melt back into nothing. “I believe I would choose ‘\nisolate\n’. I assumed neither one of us wanted that conversation to continue while clawing at each other’s throats, as we were.”\nAemond took a breath, inhaled loud and sharp in time with a sheet of rain being pushed against the windowpane. He looked away as you watched him, your feet uncurling from their place on the seat, the volume slipping through your fingers to rest beside you.\n“No,” he says, “I suppose you’re right.”\nYou stepped from the shadows and went to him, still hiding in the safety of the dark. He longed to reach for you, longed to feel your skin, warm from the fire, warm from the peace you always seemed to carve for yourself - but his fingertips were cold from the time he spent solitary in your rooms after you had gone.

To find a tome that caught your eye in the looming shadows, then settle in with it while you tucked yourself up into one of the few window seats with the raging sea below as your steadfast companion.\nYou’d stay here with your false peace until your eyes drifted closed and your head leaned against rain spattered glass. Unless, of course, you were confident that retracing your steps to venture back wouldn’t reignite what brought you here in the first place. Perhaps then, you would be cooled enough to seek each other’s company, as your heart so longed to do, even now.\nEven so, the distant rumbling grew louder with each page you turned. Rain crackled into the glass as the wind whipped past. The more you read, the pages became even more brown and stiff as they slowly shared with you their age.\nThe storm, once far out of your sight, seemed to be right on top of you now as it unleashed its fury hard and strong and fast as it battered itself again and again and\nagain\nagainst the city below, and punished the castle walls themselves.\nIt was because of this, that every sound coming from within was, of course, as good as silent.\n“I thought I’d find you here.”\nHis voice filled what little lull a storm of this magnitude could give. It slid over your skin, soft as silk, slipped in through the little cracks along with the rain and wind and thunder alike.\nPrince Aemond stood in the glow of torchlight, illuminated wholly in the warm caress of flickering flame. He remained some distance from you, mindful of the space you held both for yourself, and, more pressingly - the distance you created when he pushed you oh, so splendidly away earlier that evening.\n“Well,” your eyes slid away from the prince, to instead find the paragraph they had been pulled away from. Your next words were spoken idly, if not with remnants of\nferocity\ncoating them as you resumed reading. “You\ndo\nknow where I like to hide.”\nAemond shifts his weight - it’s caught out the corner of your eye - and a shadow promptly slips across you to blanket the words on the pages. It was, by design, a darkness you weren’t able to see through, not with the storm outside batting aside the sun’s dying rays with its gray clouds and veils of rain.\nIntentional\n.\n“So you\nare\nhiding from me.”\n“‘\nHide\n’ is not the word I would use.”\n“Isn’t it?”\nThe book snapped shut in your hands on a sigh dragged from the weary depths of your heart. They were both, unfortunately, swallowed by another rolling volley of thunder. The timing was so dramatic, so absolutely\nyou\n, that it wasn’t Aemond’s fault when it inspired a harsh roll of his eye.\nHe could be dramatic too, if only to distract you from the way his lips quirked, the flash of a smile threatening to show itself in the darkness, or in the shine of the firelight still kissing fragments of his skin. Aemond knew this wasn’t the time for jokes, yet even he could appreciate the irony of the trap\nhe\nlaid, and, quite gracefully, stepped right into.\nLightning forked through the sky on another crash of thunder, the flash cold in contrast to the warmth of the library. It was jarring, how the harsh, white light exposed everything, always, quickly and quietly before it melted back into the safety of blowing rain and raging waves.\nAnd yet, it was enough. Enough to see the tension weaving its way through Prince Aemond’s jaw, and the set of his shoulders. How he hid his hands behind his back, no doubt clasped and curled in an unbreakable grip. Aemond clearly found no comfort here tonight. He held himself wound tight - even more so, almost, than he did when all the eyes watched him while at court.\nYou, on the other hand, were relaxed, given the circumstances. Lounging comfortably in the window seat while allowing the peace and the stillness to wash over you in the place you felt safest in all of King’s Landing.\nGuilt\n, you realized, still sitting in his shadow.\nThis was what his guilt looked like.\nYou had wondered if Aemond could even feel such a thing.\n“No,” you answered his question slowly. Let the bite fade from your voice and fall into the storm. Let it melt back into nothing. “I believe I would choose ‘\nisolate\n’. I assumed neither one of us wanted that conversation to continue while clawing at each other’s throats, as we were.”\nAemond took a breath, inhaled loud and sharp in time with a sheet of rain being pushed against the windowpane. He looked away as you watched him, your feet uncurling from their place on the seat, the volume slipping through your fingers to rest beside you.\n“No,” he says, “I suppose you’re right.”\nYou stepped from the shadows and went to him, still hiding in the safety of the dark. He longed to reach for you, longed to feel your skin, warm from the fire, warm from the peace you always seemed to carve for yourself - but his fingertips were cold from the time he spent solitary in your rooms after you had gone. The fires burned to ashes as he tempered himself, once again, into honed steel that the prince sheathed - if only so he could see you again, without drawing blood once more. Now that he found you, he feared you would find only ice under his touch, instead of comfort.\nIt made his heart\nache\n.\nAnd\nyou\n-\nAemond shouldn’t have been surprised, when he found his fingers threaded through yours. A hand glided up to rest on his jaw, guiding it gently to face you. The fire was gone from your eyes, tension nowhere to be found in your body language. He could see in you, just how much you could read him, even when he said so little. Even when he said everything he didn’t mean.\n“Come on,” you took a step backwards toward the entrance, tugging on his hand as you did so. The corners of your lips quirked, the prelude of a small smile illuminating the shadows Aemond still hid in. “Let’s go brew some tea and…maybe we can talk.”\nHis head dips in agreement, oddly silent since he last spoke. It was almost as if…as if he wasn’t sure the words that wanted to spill out would be the right ones.\nKind\nones. Instead, his chilled fingers finally curled gently around your own.\nAll he can bring himself to say is, “Lead on, darling.”\nSo you do, leading him through gloomy shadows deepened by the storm, to hallways illuminated by torches, by lightning, by\nyou\n.",

        "story": "-8-\nPeter Parker was both in awe and yet despair. Thanks to a friend, Dr Curtis Connor, whom he had met because he was connected to his father, Richard Parker, Peter had recently gotten a job under Dr Otto Octavius, one of the greatest scientific minds of the 21st century. The man was a genius in what seemed every single field of science.\nIt was not long before Peter was overawed; he had always prided himself on his own knowledge, but that mostly came because he wasn't entirely sure why his parents had left him years ago, but he was positive that they had left because he was not good enough, and so he had worked hard, studied hard, and sacrificed so much just to be the best.\nOctavius had surprised him; when Peter had gotten the job, in his less enthusiastic moments he had wondered what it would be like working for the man, and he had pessimistically wondered if Octavius would simply have him clean up and get him and the other assistants coffees or something mundane like that, but it hadn't happened like that. Octavius had instead taken Peter and the others under his wing, and when Peter had met them, he knew they would not get along with the likes of Flash Thompson. All of them were like him in so many ways; socially inept and awkward, preferring books and computers to socialising, loved sci-fi movies, and found it hard to meet others to understand them.\nThanks to various science journals and articles, and documentaries on the internet, Peter had seen clips showing particle accelerators, labs aimed at piercing the mysteries of the universe and NASA's laboratories, but Octavius's laboratory was filled, seemingly, with computers and technology he had never dreamt of.\nBut he was despairing because he had yet to try to make a move towards Mary Jane Watson, and to be honest he doubted he could ever make the beautiful redhead girl like him. But the miracle was there were other girls here, and he had found he had more in common with them than he ever did with Mary Jane.\nOne of the girls was a blonde girl called Gwen Stacy; she was beautiful and despite being socially awkward, she had a sense of fashion that was both simple and elegant.\nIn the meantime, he was focusing on his job. Octavius was both a boss and a teacher, and he set tasks for advancing human science for all of the apprentices he had gathered.\nBut while he was awed by the technologies and the fact he was making his own future while kids like Harry had it handed over to him on a plate, and Flash and others like him were given scholarships for things as mundane as sports, Peter was left wondering if his personal life would be better, this job was helping pay many of the bills which was a relief.\n\"Be careful there, Peter,\" a soft voice spoke, and Peter nearly jumped when he realised Dr Octavius was right behind him, he turned on his seat and saw him there. \"I want that formula to be stable, not too explosive.\"\nPeter turned and to his horror and embarrassment he realised Octavius was right, he had been concentrating so hard on worrying about his woes that he had half forgotten what he was meant to be doing. \"I'm sorry, Doctor,\" he hastily corrected the formula, double-checking it to make sure it wasn't too dangerous.\nOctavius frowned as if Peter was a complex puzzle. \"Come with me, Peter, I want to talk to you,\" he said and while Peter hid his embarrassment and trepidation, he dutifully followed. When they were in Octavius's office, the scientist came out with it.\n\"I'm not angry with you, Peter, nor Curt. You're a damn good scientist with an impressive scientific mind. But you remind me of myself, do you know why?\"\nRealising it wasn't a rhetorical question, Peter quickly shook his head, \"No.\"\n\"I was abused as a child, Peter. My father was a hard man who didn't care about me, my education, or my interests unlike my mother,\" Octavius made a face as he thought about his father, \"and more than once I would get distracted in my work until someone shook me out of it.

Thanks to a friend, Dr Curtis Connor, whom he had met because he was connected to his father, Richard Parker, Peter had recently gotten a job under Dr Otto Octavius, one of the greatest scientific minds of the 21st century. The man was a genius in what seemed every single field of science.\nIt was not long before Peter was overawed; he had always prided himself on his own knowledge, but that mostly came because he wasn't entirely sure why his parents had left him years ago, but he was positive that they had left because he was not good enough, and so he had worked hard, studied hard, and sacrificed so much just to be the best.\nOctavius had surprised him; when Peter had gotten the job, in his less enthusiastic moments he had wondered what it would be like working for the man, and he had pessimistically wondered if Octavius would simply have him clean up and get him and the other assistants coffees or something mundane like that, but it hadn't happened like that. Octavius had instead taken Peter and the others under his wing, and when Peter had met them, he knew they would not get along with the likes of Flash Thompson. All of them were like him in so many ways; socially inept and awkward, preferring books and computers to socialising, loved sci-fi movies, and found it hard to meet others to understand them.\nThanks to various science journals and articles, and documentaries on the internet, Peter had seen clips showing particle accelerators, labs aimed at piercing the mysteries of the universe and NASA's laboratories, but Octavius's laboratory was filled, seemingly, with computers and technology he had never dreamt of.\nBut he was despairing because he had yet to try to make a move towards Mary Jane Watson, and to be honest he doubted he could ever make the beautiful redhead girl like him. But the miracle was there were other girls here, and he had found he had more in common with them than he ever did with Mary Jane.\nOne of the girls was a blonde girl called Gwen Stacy; she was beautiful and despite being socially awkward, she had a sense of fashion that was both simple and elegant.\nIn the meantime, he was focusing on his job. Octavius was both a boss and a teacher, and he set tasks for advancing human science for all of the apprentices he had gathered.\nBut while he was awed by the technologies and the fact he was making his own future while kids like Harry had it handed over to him on a plate, and Flash and others like him were given scholarships for things as mundane as sports, Peter was left wondering if his personal life would be better, this job was helping pay many of the bills which was a relief.\n\"Be careful there, Peter,\" a soft voice spoke, and Peter nearly jumped when he realised Dr Octavius was right behind him, he turned on his seat and saw him there. \"I want that formula to be stable, not too explosive.\"\nPeter turned and to his horror and embarrassment he realised Octavius was right, he had been concentrating so hard on worrying about his woes that he had half forgotten what he was meant to be doing. \"I'm sorry, Doctor,\" he hastily corrected the formula, double-checking it to make sure it wasn't too dangerous.\nOctavius frowned as if Peter was a complex puzzle. \"Come with me, Peter, I want to talk to you,\" he said and while Peter hid his embarrassment and trepidation, he dutifully followed. When they were in Octavius's office, the scientist came out with it.\n\"I'm not angry with you, Peter, nor Curt. You're a damn good scientist with an impressive scientific mind.

They were lucky, pretty sure I got the worst of it.”\n“Poor Dee.” Ryo looked torn between sympathy and laughter. “Hadn’t you better go and change into something dry?” All cops knew to keep a couple of changes of clothes in their lockers, just in case; police work could be messy.\n“Yeah, I will in a minute, just don’t wanna be alone in the locker room with JJ, both of us gettin’ changed. Kinda think I’m gonna need to shower first anyway. I had to walk eight blocks like this.”\nRyo wrinkled his nose. “Ugh.” He could just imagine how Dee must have felt as the icy rainwater soaked through to his skin, chilling him. “You must be freezing!” There was a bitter wind blowing.\n“Yeah. Just hope there’s some hot water left.” Dee sighed. “Hope we don’t haveta go out until the rain stops. For once, I think I’d rather stay in and do paperwork.”\nThe End",

No doubt the Treasury Secretary had also considered skipping today’s session.\n“Secretary Hamilton?” Jefferson called to Hamilton before sitting.\nAlexander started and glanced over to him slightly surprised. “Secretary Jefferson.”  he said politely acknowledging him.\nThe silence was telling as they both couldn’t come to grips with the empty seat between them.\nAlexander folded his hands on his own desk and stared ahead. “H-have you seen Jemmy today?”\nThomas nodded silently, “Last night. He was still unconscious.”\n“Oh….” Alexander said quietly, looking everywhere but at Thomas.\nNow Thomas furrowed his eyebrows at the Treasury Secretary. “Haven’t you gone to see him?”\nAlexander sadly shook his head, \"Unfortunately, Jemmy...James and I drifted apart as friends a while back, mainly because of our differing views on the South.\"\nThomas looked at Alexander with concern. “But he’s still your friend, isn’t he?”\nAlexander sighed heavily.\n“He was, but I fear it may be too late to mend our friendship now. And seeing him in that state, it just brings back memories of what we used to be.” He looked away. “There were days when he was sick, but he still wanted to work.”\n“Then if you can’t be friends, at least be there for him.” Thomas said, echoing the words Alexander had said to him on that terrible day. “Maybe it’s not too late for you to patch up your friendship.”\nAlexander nodded. “Yeah. I-I’ll do that. Thanks...Thomas.”\nI’ll come with you to see Jemmy...if you’d like.” Jefferson remarked.\nAlexander looked grateful for the offer and nodded. “I’d appreciate that.”\nHad he really taken advice from Thomas Jefferson?\n*~*\nThey walked together in silence for a while, Thomas' cane tapping on the pavement as they journeyed to the Madison's residence. The sky above was cloudy and reflected the mood of the two men.\nThomas broke the silence by asking, \"How long have you known James?\"\nAlexander nonchalantly shrugged his shoulders, a wistful smile playing on his lips. \"Back in the early days of the republic, we were united by our shared vision at the first Continental Congress. Together, we penned the Federalist Papers along with John Jay. However, when I proposed the Assumption Bill, our paths diverged, and our friendship dissolved.”\nThomas nodded, understanding the weight of their shared history and the complexities that had since pulled them apart. Alexander's words painted a picture of a friendship once strong and unbreakable, now marred by differences in ideology and politics.\nAlexander hesitated as they reached the door of the Madison’s residence. They were greeted by Dolley Madison, who wore a sad smile. “Good day, Mr. Jefferson.” Confusion clouded her expression as she glanced over at Alexander. \"Mr. Hamilton?\"  She ushered them into the foyer.  “I’m glad you’re here. I think Jemmy could do with some company.”\nAs they followed Dolley into the parlor, Alexander couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia. The room was filled with memories of the time spent here with James, debating ideas, and crafting their arguments for the Federalist Papers.\nThomas glanced over to his fellow secretary and cleared his throat. “Hamilton, why don’t you go see James first? Go...talk to him, so to speak.”\nAlexander hesitated, then with a kind nod agree quietly. “Thank you, Mrs. Madison...Mr. Jefferson.”\nHe glided quietly into the room where James Madison lay in his sickbed. Alexander's mouth was dry, he wondered what to say to his former friend. Would Jemmy even hear him as he was unconscious?\n“Hello, James. It’s Alexander.” He sat heavily in the armchair near the bed. Looking to the bedside table, he saw a book and read its spine. It was James' favorite book on Philosophy by John Locke. Alexander’s mouth gaped slightly. Had Jefferson been reading this to James these last two weeks?\nReluctantly, he reached out and gently grasped his friend's wrist, noticing the faint scars left behind by the lightning strike. He took a deep breath and spoke. “James, you’re not allowed to die, do you hear me? You’re- you were my friend. Politics tore our friendship apart and I regret it every day. Even when you side with Jefferson and taunt me. Just-” his words were shaky now. “You have to wake up, Jemmy. Your poor wife is worried, Jefferson is worried. I’m...I’m worried. I don’t want to lose you as a colleague and a f-friend. You’re too brilliant to lose.”\nTears welled up in Alexander’s eyes as he poured out his heart to his unconscious friend. He sat there for what seemed like hours, lost in his thoughts and memories of their happier past meetings. Eventually, he gently squeezed James’ hand and stood up, wiping away his tears.\nHis words spent, he picked up the book and flipped through the pages. “Shall I read to you?” He took a breath and began to read. “...t\nhus we may conceive how words, which were by nature so well adapted to that purpose, came to be made use of by men, as the signs of their ideas.\n”\n~*~\nFour days had passed since he'd seen Jemmy. He had made a point of going over to see him every day to either talk or read to him. On a sunny day, a sudden, urgent knock echoed through the door. Eliza's brow knitted in confusion, for it was a rare occurrence to have Alexander's undivided attention on his day off. Instead of his usual writing, he found solace in watching their children gleefully playing on the floor.\nGlancing away from the book in his hands, he let out a small sigh before placing it on the table. \"I'll go check who it is, my love. It seems quite urgent.\"\nEliza frowned. “If it’s a political matter…” she began with a hand on her hip.\nAlexander raised a hand as if to shoo away the worry as he went to the door. Opening it, he found Thomas Jefferson, standing on the stoop, who looked in unusual disarray. His hair was even wilder than normal, and the Virginian’s eyes were puffy and bloodshot. Yet, as he glanced at Alexander, a smile spread across his face.  “Alexander, it’s Jemmy. He’s awake.”\nAlexander's heart skipped a beat as his eyes widened. \"He's awake? Jemmy's alive?\" He hesitated for a moment, resisting the urge to embrace his rival.  He called over his shoulder, “Eliza!” Then he returned his attention to the Secretary of State. “How is he? I mean, is he-?”\nThomas’ shoulders rose. “He seems fine? The lightning doesn’t seem to have had any permanent effects.  The doctors are baffled. He’s still going to need some time to recover though.”\nInstantly, Eliza appeared with a puzzled expression. ‘What is it Alexander? Why on earth are you yelling so?”\nHe turned and took her shoulders. “Jemmy’s awake, Eliza! He pulled through!” He exclaimed, kissing her on the cheek. “Honey, I should go see him. I’ll be home later, alright?”\nEliza’s face was one of love. “Of course, sweetheart. Please give my best wishes to Dolley and wish Mr. Madison a speedy recovery for me?” She pecked him on the cheek.\nAlexander gave a firm nod and swiftly exited the house, brimming with anticipation to mend his friendship and extend his unwavering support while Jemmy was on the mend.\nTHE END",

Looking to the bedside table, he saw a book and read its spine. It was James' favorite book on Philosophy by John Locke. Alexander’s mouth gaped slightly. Had Jefferson been reading this to James these last two weeks?\nReluctantly, he reached out and gently grasped his friend's wrist, noticing the faint scars left behind by the lightning strike. He took a deep breath and spoke. “James, you’re not allowed to die, do you hear me? You’re- you were my friend. Politics tore our friendship apart and I regret it every day. Even when you side with Jefferson and taunt me. Just-” his words were shaky now. “You have to wake up, Jemmy. Your poor wife is worried, Jefferson is worried. I’m...I’m worried. I don’t want to lose you as a colleague and a f-friend. You’re too brilliant to lose.”\nTears welled up in Alexander’s eyes as he poured out his heart to his unconscious friend. He sat there for what seemed like hours, lost in his thoughts and memories of their happier past meetings. Eventually, he gently squeezed James’ hand and stood up, wiping away his tears.\nHis words spent, he picked up the book and flipped through the pages. “Shall I read to you?” He took a breath and began to read. “...t\nhus we may conceive how words, which were by nature so well adapted to that purpose, came to be made use of by men, as the signs of their ideas.\n”\n~*~\nFour days had passed since he'd seen Jemmy. He had made a point of going over to see him every day to either talk or read to him. On a sunny day, a sudden, urgent knock echoed through the door. Eliza's brow knitted in confusion, for it was a rare occurrence to have Alexander's undivided attention on his day off. Instead of his usual writing, he found solace in watching their children gleefully playing on the floor.\nGlancing away from the book in his hands, he let out a small sigh before placing it on the table. \"I'll go check who it is, my love. It seems quite urgent.\"\nEliza frowned. “If it’s a political matter…” she began with a hand on her hip.\nAlexander raised a hand as if to shoo away the worry as he went to the door. Opening it, he found Thomas Jefferson, standing on the stoop, who looked in unusual disarray. His hair was even wilder than normal, and the Virginian’s eyes were puffy and bloodshot. Yet, as he glanced at Alexander, a smile spread across his face.  “Alexander, it’s Jemmy. He’s awake.”\nAlexander's heart skipped a beat as his eyes widened. \"He's awake? Jemmy's alive?\" He hesitated for a moment, resisting the urge to embrace his rival.  He called over his shoulder, “Eliza!” Then he returned his attention to the Secretary of State. “How is he? I mean, is he-?”\nThomas’ shoulders rose. “He seems fine? The lightning doesn’t seem to have had any permanent effects.  The doctors are baffled. He’s still going to need some time to recover though.”\nInstantly, Eliza appeared with a puzzled expression. ‘What is it Alexander? Why on earth are you yelling so?”\nHe turned and took her shoulders. “Jemmy’s awake, Eliza! He pulled through!” He exclaimed, kissing her on the cheek. “Honey, I should go see him. I’ll be home later, alright?”\nEliza’s face was one of love. “Of course, sweetheart. Please give my best wishes to Dolley and wish Mr. Madison a speedy recovery for me?” She pecked him on the cheek.\nAlexander gave a firm nod and swiftly exited the house, brimming with anticipation to mend his friendship and extend his unwavering support while Jemmy was on the mend.\nTHE END",

He is dressed in soft layers, a pale robe belted over a darker shirt and trousers, and everything flows as he walks over, curling his arms around Cody. He leans down, pressing his cheek to Cody’s, his beard scratching in a way that prickles and aches and Cody leans into it all the same.

When her charismatic cousin Boromir promises to find something fun for them to do together, her heart stirs with hope and a secret longing—what will she do to make that moment a reality?",
        "story": "Thiten Hûb began as a small fishing village, then became a charming trading port, and finally transformed into a delightful and exclusive holiday resort. Over the years, even the princes of Dol Amroth found refuge in this enchanting place with their families. It was situated in a small bay, well protected from stormy winds and waves that could erode its shores, as well as from the incursions of the pirates of Umbar. A villa of rough white stone, called Bâr Láranen, stood almost perched over the sea. Pink and violet bougainvillea climbed along its walls, and a row of olive trees, myrtles, and lemons surrounded and concealed it from view. A staircase carved into the rock led down to the small private cove, where a dock was built, and the princes' boats were always moored. These said princes, all young men between eighteen and twenty-five years of age, dressed in cool raw linen tunics and trousers rolled up to their ankles, were busy joking amongst themselves. They threw jests and colorful skeins of thread at each other and splashed water with their bare feet. Their laughter rose high into the light turquoise sky, rivaling the cries of the seagulls.\nNot far away, sitting with a discontented expression and her chin resting on her hand, Lothíriel watched them with pouting lips. This particular year she felt more isolated than ever: during the winter she had given her first tribute as a woman and now could no longer participate in the rambunctious activities she loved to do with her brothers and cousins. She still remembered when just the year before, she could lift her skirts and walk barefoot around one of the boats while Elphir called her:\n\"Come, Looloo, help us prepare the nets!\"\n\"Alright, but I would like to come with you!\"\nErchirion had smiled and tousled her hair:\n\"You're too little for these things. Maybe next time.\"\nShe had turned her face away, annoyed, and had sighed in despair:\n\"Always next time...\"\nMeanwhile, the three brothers had boarded the boat, and as they moved away on the sparkling water, Amrothos had shouted back to her, laughing:\n\"Don't worry, Looloo. I'll teach you to fish next time. I promise!\"\nBut now that she was old enough to follow her brothers, that same condition prevented her from joining them. While the court at Bâr Láranen was small and life more relaxed, Lothíriel found herself facing the new restrictions imposed by her transition to adulthood, making her even more annoyed and frustrated.\n\"Lothíriel, straighten those shoulders and wear your hat.\"\nThe stern but gentle voice of her aunt Ivrinel cut through the air, her authoritative commands ringing clearly. Lothíriel immediately straightened up, but in a tiny act of rebellion refused to wear the hat, letting the sun's glare hide her impending tears. She dearly loved her aunt, who had tried to be a guardian and affectionate companion since her mother's death, but she was not yet ready to yield to the impositions of her new condition.\nBored, she sat on the small woven straw chair and watched her aunt placidly weaving cotton thread. Amrothos noticed his sister's gaze and approached her quietly:\n\"Hey, Looloo, you could make yourself useful and learn as well: then you could weave our nets!\"\nLothíriel jumped and replied sharply:\n\"Don't call me that.\"\nShe tried to maintain her composure, and even though she adored her childhood nickname, it made her feel small and vulnerable. But Erchirion gave a complicit chuckle and supported his brother:\n\"And maybe you could wipe that gloomy expression off your face: you're making the sky darken!\"\n\"Ah, leave it be, Erchirion,\" Amrothos intervened, \"She's just upset because she can't play like a child anymore.\"\nShe glanced at her elder brother Elphir, who ignored her completely, focused on the fishing gear, making her feel even more invisible and isolated.\nAs every summer, the older cousins from Minas Tirith used to spend a few weeks at Thiten Hûb as guests of their uncle, to rest from the exertions of academic studies and military training. Mostly, to escape the atmosphere of sadness and the suffocating pressure always present in the Steward's house.\nEven Faramir had approached her and smiled with an expression of pity in his eyes. This hurt her more than anything, but she stoically pressed her lips together. Faramir said gently:\n\"Don't fret too much, nethig: we will catch a fish for you. The fattest and tenderest, and we will roast it tonight with the most fragrant herbs in your honor.\"\n\"It's not the same.\"\nShe replied sullenly. He shrugged, being used to sharp responses and brusque manners since childhood. Even now, away from the pressure of Minas Tirith, Faramir maintained that patient calm he had learned as a child. He pulled back his hair and, with a little smile, went to confer with Elphir. Lothíriel immediately regretted the rudeness she had shown to Faramir, hunched back over her chair, and bit her lip. At that moment, Boromir turned towards her, haloed by the sun's reflection. His long black hair waved in the breeze, and to her eyes, he appeared as one of those legendary heroes of ancient times: Beren or Tuor or even Elendil, whom she used to sigh over during her evening readings. Boromir, in turn, approached the young girl with an enchanting smile, and she immediately straightened up and tucked a dark curl behind her ear. If Faramir, with his sweetness and patience, was close to her heart as a brother, Boromir, with his charisma and imposing presence, represented everything she imagined in a hero. When he smiled at her, her heart began to beat faster, and Lothíriel felt nervous and happy. For some time now, thinking about her cousin caused a sort of stir that made her agitated and euphoric at the same time, as if she had drunk a few drops too many of the sweet rose wine that Aunt Ivrinel hid in her dresser. Boromir addressed her playfully:\n\"So, little one, why don't you come fishing with us anymore?\"\nLothíriel squirmed in her chair as she felt the heat rise to her cheeks:\n\"It's just... that... I can't anymore.\"\nShe stammered, trying not to reveal too much. She was terribly embarrassed by her secret, yet she felt the need to appear mature and worthy in front of him, though somewhat intimidated by his presence. A flash of understanding crossed Boromir's blue eyes, so he crouched beside her and said in a warm, reassuring voice:\n\"Don't worry, Lothíriel, we will find something fun to do together.\"\nBeing called by her full name made her feel special and important. She couldn't suppress a flirtatious smile as she asked:\n\"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really. Gweston!\"\nHe replied with a warm, enveloping laugh, placing a hand on his heart. Then he stood up and gave her a gentle pat on the head before joining the other boys. Lothíriel watched him go, feeling the spot where he had touched her sizzle, her heart still in turmoil. She hoped he would keep his promise, and her lips curled into a satisfied smile.\n\"Lothíriel, come help me with this thread.\"\nThe firm but gentle voice of her aunt called her back to reality. Indeed, Ivrinel's attentive eyes had not missed the sighs and yearnings of her niece. Lothíriel sighed slightly but obediently approached her aunt. As she walked over, she cast one last glance at the boys on the boat sailing away on the shimmering sea. With a sigh, she began to work alongside Ivrinel, but her mind kept returning to that smile and that promise. She vowed that one day she would find a way to spend time alone with Boromir, and that thought filled her heart with a sweet and eager anticipation.",

She still remembered when just the year before, she could lift her skirts and walk barefoot around one of the boats while Elphir called her:\n\"Come, Looloo, help us prepare the nets!\"\n\"Alright, but I would like to come with you!\"\nErchirion had smiled and tousled her hair:\n\"You're too little for these things. Maybe next time.\"\nShe had turned her face away, annoyed, and had sighed in despair:\n\"Always next time...\"\nMeanwhile, the three brothers had boarded the boat, and as they moved away on the sparkling water, Amrothos had shouted back to her, laughing:\n\"Don't worry, Looloo. I'll teach you to fish next time. I promise!\"\nBut now that she was old enough to follow her brothers, that same condition prevented her from joining them. While the court at Bâr Láranen was small and life more relaxed, Lothíriel found herself facing the new restrictions imposed by her transition to adulthood, making her even more annoyed and frustrated.\n\"Lothíriel, straighten those shoulders and wear your hat.\"\nThe stern but gentle voice of her aunt Ivrinel cut through the air, her authoritative commands ringing clearly. Lothíriel immediately straightened up, but in a tiny act of rebellion refused to wear the hat, letting the sun's glare hide her impending tears. She dearly loved her aunt, who had tried to be a guardian and affectionate companion since her mother's death, but she was not yet ready to yield to the impositions of her new condition.\nBored, she sat on the small woven straw chair and watched her aunt placidly weaving cotton thread. Amrothos noticed his sister's gaze and approached her quietly:\n\"Hey, Looloo, you could make yourself useful and learn as well: then you could weave our nets!\"\nLothíriel jumped and replied sharply:\n\"Don't call me that.\"\nShe tried to maintain her composure, and even though she adored her childhood nickname, it made her feel small and vulnerable. But Erchirion gave a complicit chuckle and supported his brother:\n\"And maybe you could wipe that gloomy expression off your face: you're making the sky darken!\"\n\"Ah, leave it be, Erchirion,\" Amrothos intervened, \"She's just upset because she can't play like a child anymore.\"\nShe glanced at her elder brother Elphir, who ignored her completely, focused on the fishing gear, making her feel even more invisible and isolated.\nAs every summer, the older cousins from Minas Tirith used to spend a few weeks at Thiten Hûb as guests of their uncle, to rest from the exertions of academic studies and military training. Mostly, to escape the atmosphere of sadness and the suffocating pressure always present in the Steward's house.\nEven Faramir had approached her and smiled with an expression of pity in his eyes. This hurt her more than anything, but she stoically pressed her lips together. Faramir said gently:\n\"Don't fret too much, nethig: we will catch a fish for you.

He shrugged, being used to sharp responses and brusque manners since childhood. Even now, away from the pressure of Minas Tirith, Faramir maintained that patient calm he had learned as a child. He pulled back his hair and, with a little smile, went to confer with Elphir. Lothíriel immediately regretted the rudeness she had shown to Faramir, hunched back over her chair, and bit her lip. At that moment, Boromir turned towards her, haloed by the sun's reflection. His long black hair waved in the breeze, and to her eyes, he appeared as one of those legendary heroes of ancient times: Beren or Tuor or even Elendil, whom she used to sigh over during her evening readings. Boromir, in turn, approached the young girl with an enchanting smile, and she immediately straightened up and tucked a dark curl behind her ear. If Faramir, with his sweetness and patience, was close to her heart as a brother, Boromir, with his charisma and imposing presence, represented everything she imagined in a hero. When he smiled at her, her heart began to beat faster, and Lothíriel felt nervous and happy. For some time now, thinking about her cousin caused a sort of stir that made her agitated and euphoric at the same time, as if she had drunk a few drops too many of the sweet rose wine that Aunt Ivrinel hid in her dresser. Boromir addressed her playfully:\n\"So, little one, why don't you come fishing with us anymore?\"\nLothíriel squirmed in her chair as she felt the heat rise to her cheeks:\n\"It's just... that... I can't anymore.\"\nShe stammered, trying not to reveal too much. She was terribly embarrassed by her secret, yet she felt the need to appear mature and worthy in front of him, though somewhat intimidated by his presence. A flash of understanding crossed Boromir's blue eyes, so he crouched beside her and said in a warm, reassuring voice:\n\"Don't worry, Lothíriel, we will find something fun to do together.\"\nBeing called by her full name made her feel special and important. She couldn't suppress a flirtatious smile as she asked:\n\"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really. Gweston!\"\nHe replied with a warm, enveloping laugh, placing a hand on his heart. Then he stood up and gave her a gentle pat on the head before joining the other boys. Lothíriel watched him go, feeling the spot where he had touched her sizzle, her heart still in turmoil. She hoped he would keep his promise, and her lips curled into a satisfied smile.\n\"Lothíriel, come help me with this thread.\"\nThe firm but gentle voice of her aunt called her back to reality.

A mind of evil.\nA great intelligence.\n“You going to stay and stare, or are you going to release me from the molecular bondage?” The Doctor asked.\nRogue stood there slack jawed, for a spell, then gathered himself and did as he was requested.\n“Sorry, your story checks out...all your stories, it’s funny, and you...suddenly act like it’s all so new to you”\n“It’s still all new to me love and I don’t want to contemplate what could be in store next for me if one of those faces on the scan proves true...”\n“Why? What’s the significance of it?” Rogue asked.\n“There is an intelligence on this planet that is trying to kill me across all of time and space, I couldn’t stop it, but a friend of mine did, her name was Clara Oswald, and there is a good possibility an echo of her exists here, in this century, on these very grounds, on the patch of green we walked across on route to your ship, she is out there, fighting for every breath you make and every step you, and I, take”\n“And seeing one of your faces convinces you of all that?”\n“Isn’t it obvious Rogue? I wear that face, it isn’t just appearing there to mark what will become of me, it is what I become. I become that intelligence, a being of sheer indomitable will, the ability to control and kill whenever and however I please. My people, lords one and all, spoke once of ascending beyond all demand for physical presence in the universe, they wished to bring about the end of linear time and become free of cause and effect. What if I achieve it? My god Rogue...what if that is my calling? It was said I would have many names before the end...beast, storm, Valeyard...and now...Intelligence”\nRogue walked up to The Doctor and gently placed his hand on his.\n“You have an illness; your friend sounds like a good reliever of it”\n“Some illnesses you can’t cure” The Doctor admitted.\n“It’s impossible to tow the line between present and future without a little bit of knowledge, but if you know yourself, then you know how to shape that future into something better to come\"\n““I’m a devil in scarlet and black, what would I know?” The Doctor asked.\nRogue smiled and played another bopping track across the com speakers.\n‘’Say you won't leave me no more\nI'll take you back again\nNo more excuses, no, no\n'Cause I've heard them all before\nA hundred times or more\nI'll forgive and forget\nIf you say you'll never go\n'Cause it's true what they say\nIt's better the devil you know (better the devil)\n(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)’’\nAnd just like that, The Doctor’s spirits suddenly rose.",

        "story": "Biana came home crying not that anyone would notice. Her father Alden was working with Fitz on something and her mother Della was too busy spying on her father for the Council. No one really cared about Biana. When she came to them they told her to go away. Fitz would call her a crybaby. Alden would pay her no mind. And Della would do the worst. She would chat with Biana but never really listened to her.\nShe ran up to her room. Another person, another one! Revealed that they only wanted to be friends with Biana because she was related to Fitz.\n“I’m not worth anything.” A voice inside her head whispered. “No one would want to be with me.”\nBiana pressed her head against her pillow trying to silence the voice.\n“I’m not beautiful. I’m a mistake.”\nBiana screamed and threw her heels into the wall.\n“No matter how hard you try, no one will love you or care for you.” The voice continued to answer. Biana jumped up and ran. She ran outside of the house and ran laps around it. Running had been the only thing that stopped the voices. Leaving her too exhausted to think.\nShe walked back inside. She went to the pantry and grabbed some Prattles. No one invited her down for dinner as per usual. Biana walked to her room and just munched on Prattles. She set the box down on her nightstand and got started on changing. She threw off her sweaty uniform and pulled on a plain black tunic and her softest gray leggings. She skipped her shower and just got into bed. Tears leaked back down her face. She heard the rest of her family eating dinner and no one remembered the youngest Vacker.\n“They will never love you.” The voice crept back in.\nBiana woke and groaned. It was Saturday she was stuck in Everglen. She didn’t have any friends besides the ones who just wanted a look at her brother. She pulled on a teal tunic with flower embroidery and kept her gray leggins on. She didn’t bother to do her hair.\n“Morning sweetie!” Della sang.\nBiana shrugged and made herself a breakfast salad. Fitz walked down and said nothing to Biana. He just grabbed a single piece of fruit then leaped away. Alden came down next but again said nothing to Biana, grabbed a single piece of fruit and went back to his office.\nBiana started hearing the voice again, “You’re worthless. You're ugly.” Biana pressed her hands to her ears and dropped the knife she was using to cut the fruit. Della pid it no mind. Biana crouched down and grabbed the knife. She finished making her salad and sat down. Della had already left. She ate alone again.\n“No matter what you do you’ll always be worthless.” The voice said.\nBiana let herself cry. No one would care, they never did.\nShe put her dish in the sink and went to her favorite spot. She grabbed her book and her running shoes and went to a blooming purple tree. She sat beneath it and started to read. When the voice stirred she pulled on her shoes and ran. She ran a total of 30 laps that day trying to avoid the voice it still crept in.\n“Why hide it when you know you're a mistake?” The voice whispered. She ran inside, grabbed some mallowmelt and ran to her room. She ate slowly at the slices, tears streaming down her face. The voice was relentless. When she finished her last slice she ripped off her tunic and leggings and turned on the shower. She looked into the mirror as the water heated up. The girl looking back at her had tear stained cheeks, her teal eyes looked slightly bloodshot. Her dark bags under her eyes could rival Edaline’s. And her chocolate brown hair was tangled. She stepped under the colorful spray of water and tried so hard to think good things about herself but the voice always won.\nBiana got into bed once she was done with her shower and layed down. The glittering stars hanging from her canopy glittered a teal light. It was supposed to be calming but it just reminded her about her ‘perfect’ family and unrealistic expectations.\n“You're worthless. You're a mistake. No one will love you!” The voice shouted.\nBiana jumped out of bed ready to run again but instead she walked over to her desk and grabbed her imparter. She let out a shaky breath and hailed Elwin.\n“Hi Biana.” He said, “What did you need?”\nBiana’s tears spilled over as she told him about the voice and how neglected she’d been feeling,\n“Have you told your parents?” He asked, turning away to wipe his own tears.\n“I’ve tried.. . but Della doesn’t listen and Alsen and Fitz don’t talk to me.” She said as tears doubled over.\n“Leap to Foxfire now.” Elwin said before he turned off the imparter.\nBiana walked to the Leapmaster, 10,000, shouted, “Foxfire!” Then walked onto campus grounds.

        "writing_prompt": "After stepping away from the throne and choosing love over duty, a young former Crown Prince faces an uncertain future—what does life look like when the path ahead is no longer set in stone?",
        "story": "It’s the first time in a long time that Wilhelm has no clue what’s around the corner for him. For most of his life, he’d expected to be a working royal, technically Erik’s heir until such time as Erik had children of his own, so unlikely to ever have to actually take the throne. Then when Erik died, Wilhelm had known that his destiny lay somewhere else entirely, that he was to take the throne in Erik’s place. Now he’s made the choice to be honest with his family, to say that he doesn’t want to be Crown Prince any more, that he’s chosen Simon, he no longer knows what lies in store.\nHe doesn’t know where he’s going to be going to school for the next academic year; while he knows that Hillerska’s closure is being appealed, he’s not sure how successful that’s going to be. Yes, everyone involved in the initiation will have gone, yes, the school will be under new management, but will that be enough for the appeal to be successful? Wilhelm knows that if the attempt to appeal the closure does fail, his parents could always choose to send him back to his old school from before he started Hillerska, or find somewhere else altogether, but he’s not sure whether he would want that now, to be at a school without Simon, Felice and Sara.\nAugust’s called, thanking Wilhelm for speaking to his parents about making him the heir to the Swedish throne. Wilhelm’s not sure how their relationship will be in the future; although they are family, until recently they had never been friends, and there’s still enough water under the bridge that he’s not sure how easy it will be for them ever to really be close. At one point, he hadn’t thought he could forgive August for the sex tape, and more recently August’s shattering of Wilhelm’s illusions about Erik by revealing Erik’s role in the initiation had driven a wedge between them; yet a part of Wilhelm actually thinks he wouldn’t mind now talking about Erik with August, since August had reassured Wilhelm that Erik would have loved him. They’ll still see each other again as cousins; after all this time of disliking August, Wilhelm considers the idea that they could become something closer to friends.\nWilhelm’s never thought about the idea of a career. Why would he? Until now, he’d never expected to have any choice in the matter; whether as Crown Prince or another working royal, heir to Erik, the choice had already been set in stone for Wilhelm. For Simon and Sara and Felice, Rosh and Ayub, even August’s friends, futures not fixed in the same way, they had always expected to have some kind of career; Wilhelm knew Simon had wanted a career in music, although he had never been sure that it would actually happen. If he’s honest with himself, he has to admit that he’ll never truly leave the public eye; even though he has taken the step back from the throne, he’s still well enough known that he’ll always be recognised as a member of the royal family, never able to blend into the background and live a truly normal life in the way that his friends can.

All that could be heard was the scratching of the Quill and the occasional meowing of Umbridge's cat portraits. Harry almost felt like he was in a dream, about to wake up soon.\nAlmost. The pain in his hand stopped him from falling into the dreamlike state completely. A pity, as perhaps the time would pass faster.\n“That will do.”\nHarry dropped the quill with a silent sigh of relief, resisting the urge to clutch his injured hand. Umbridge held out her hand for her usual inspection, and Harry offered it, eager to be done. His bed in the dorm was like a siren, calling him to fall into the nothingness it brought.\n“Same time tomorrow,” Umbridge said, and Harry had a sudden urge to punch the smile off her face permanently. Almost as If she could hear his thoughts, her smile widened. “After all, it hasn't sunk in just yet, has it?”\n“No, Professor.”\nFinally, his hand was released, and Harry grabbed his bag and dragged himself out of the office and to Gryffindor Tower.\n“There you are! She kept you for much longer than usual, didn't she?”\n“Dunno,” Harry said tiredly, dropping into a chair in front of the fire. The usual bowl of dittany sat on the table, and Harry soaked his hand gratefully. Hermione watched anxiously.\n“It's still not healing properly.”\n“Better than nothing,” Ron said. “You can't risk Snape again, Hermione.”\n“Again?”\nHermione turned pink. “I wanted to see if there was something stronger than dittany in Professor Snape's stores, but— well, he caught me.”\n“Oh no! What happened?”\n“Nothing, actually. He told me that the only reason Dittany wouldn't be working was if something was preventing it, and\n‘I'd better not hear you have been using Dark Magic, Granger.’\n”\n“No detention?” Harry asked disbelievingly.\nHermione shrugged. “I still don't understand what is wrong with dittany. We know the quill is not the problem as it was healing before. Why isn't it now?”\n“It works enough,” Harry mumbled, eyes closed. “Enough for me to be able to…”\nHe was asleep before he finished the sentence.\nWhen Harry woke up, the bowl of dittany had fallen to the floor and there was an awful crick in his neck. His hand was throbbing dully and he lifted it up to look at it with bleary eyes.\nThe words were swollen and disfigured, and Harry could only make them out because he knew what it said. Harry touched it slightly and hissed at the burn, dropping his hand. Firmly pushing it out of his mind, he picked up the bag that he'd dropped the night before and settled down to do his homework. He doubted he would manage to finish even one essay, but he couldn't bring himself to care.\nHe changed his mind later that morning as he looked up at Snape's angry eyes.\n“Detention, Potter. After dinner.”\n“Can't,” Harry said. “Got detention with Umbridge.”\nSnape's lips thinned. “After, then. Or is that too late for Mr. Celebrity?”\nHarry could have argued that he did need to sleep, but he just didn't have the energy. Instead, he just nodded and started on his potion, ignoring Hermione's furious inquiries.\nAfter dinner found Harry back in Umbridge's office. It had been two hours, and Harry was dreading the long detention still ahead of him when Umbridge spoke.\n“That will do.”\nHarry looked up in surprise. Umbridge had a sour look on her face that reminded him of Aunt Petunia.\n“Professor Snape could not find any other time for your detention, but you\nwill\nmake it up to me, Mr. Potter.”\nHarry squashed down his disgust. “Of course, Professor.”\nHardly believing his luck, Harry started the long trek to the dungeons. Why did Snape's office have to be so far away?\nFinally, Snape's door appeared, and Harry lifted a heavy hand to knock on it.\n“Come in!”\nHarry pushed the door open with considerable effort.\n“You are late, Potter.”\n“Just back from detention,” Harry said, too tired to glare. There were a few dozen cauldrons stacked in the corner, and Harry headed for them, before Snape's voice stopped him in his tracks.\n“Did I say you were to do cauldrons?”\n“Sorry,” Harry turned to Snape. “What am I going to do then?”\n“Lines.” Snape smiled cruelly.\nHarry stared. Since when did Snape have him do lines?\n“Well?” Snape snapped. “Get on with it.”\nFeeling like he was dreaming again, Harry sat down on the chair. Thankfully, the quill besides the parchment was a regular quill.\n“What should I write?”\n“What should I write, Sir?”\n“I must do my homework on time.”\n“Right.” Harry bent down to begin his lines, but he could still feel Snape’s eyes on him.\n“What is wrong with your hand, Potter?”\n“What?” Harry asked, confused. “Nothing.”\nHe put the quill down and held up his hand for emphasis.\nSnape's brow furrowed. “Do you think me a fool? Other hand.”\nHarry reluctantly opened the left hand towards Snape, palm up. Snape yanked at it and turned it over, and Harry winced.\nIt looked even worse than it had in the morning. The whole area was bright red so that the harsh words couldn't be seen anymore, and bright yellow splotches were visible.\n“Have you tried dittany?”\nHarry looked back at Snape’s sharp voice. He looked even angrier than normal, which was saying something.\n“Yeah,” Harry shrugged. It worked in the beginning, but slowly it just— stopped.”\n“How long has this been going on?” Snape asked, summoning a jar. Harry caught sight of the label as it flew into Snape's hand —\nAntibacterial Aloe Cream.\n“Dunno,” Harry said. “A month, maybe.”\n“Are you feeling cold? Or feverish?\n“Yeah,” Harry muttered, looking at Snape's desk. He felt exposed, and if his hand hadn't been so tightly held by Snape, he might have run off.\nFinally, Snape released his hand and drew his wand. Harry tensed.\n“A diagnostic Charm.”\nSnape waved his wand and Harry felt a warmth spread through him, which left as quickly as it had come.\n“How shocking. You have an infection. When did you last eat?”\n“Dinner,” Harry mumbled.\n“Let me define eating, then. It refers to the act of putting food in your mouth, chewing, and swallowing it. Keeping that in mind, when did you last eat?”\nHarry shrugged, going red with embarrassment.\nSnape sighed. “You have detention every day —”\n“Hey!” Harry protested, his anger flaring up. “What for?!”\n“— After dinner,” Snape continued, speaking over him. “You have been unnaturally disruptive, and this is the only time I can spare out of my busy day to oversee your detentions.”\n“Oh. Oh,” Harry said, understanding. “Alright, thanks.”\n“Do not thank me, Potter. The Wizarding World would self-destruct if they were to lose their celebrity. It is entirely self-interest, I assure you.”\nHarry stared. Harry might be feeling hazy, but he was sure Snape had just made a joke.\n“Now,” Snape said, summoning a vial. “A mouthful every morning and evening. Now get to bed, immediately.”\n“The detention,” Harry protested.\nSnape raised an eyebrow. “Do you want to write lines?”\nHarry blushed. “Not particularly.”\n“Then get out of my sight.”\nHarry stood up and turned to leave.\n“The vial, Potter.”\nToo embarrassed to look at Snape, Harry snatched the vial and fled.",

Oh,” Harry said, understanding. “Alright, thanks.”\n“Do not thank me, Potter. The Wizarding World would self-destruct if they were to lose their celebrity.

        "story": "In the stillness and silence of Umbridge's office, Harry sat writing his lines. All that could be heard was the scratching of the Quill and the occasional meowing of Umbridge's cat portraits. Harry almost felt like he was in a dream, about to wake up soon.\nAlmost. The pain in his hand stopped him from falling into the dreamlike state completely. A pity, as perhaps the time would pass faster.\n“That will do.”\nHarry dropped the quill with a silent sigh of relief, resisting the urge to clutch his injured hand. Umbridge held out her hand for her usual inspection, and Harry offered it, eager to be done. His bed in the dorm was like a siren, calling him to fall into the nothingness it brought.\n“Same time tomorrow,” Umbridge said, and Harry had a sudden urge to punch the smile off her face permanently. Almost as If she could hear his thoughts, her smile widened. “After all, it hasn't sunk in just yet, has it?”\n“No, Professor.”\nFinally, his hand was released, and Harry grabbed his bag and dragged himself out of the office and to Gryffindor Tower.\n“There you are! She kept you for much longer than usual, didn't she?”\n“Dunno,” Harry said tiredly, dropping into a chair in front of the fire. The usual bowl of dittany sat on the table, and Harry soaked his hand gratefully. Hermione watched anxiously.\n“It's still not healing properly.”\n“Better than nothing,” Ron said. “You can't risk Snape again, Hermione.”\n“Again?”\nHermione turned pink. “I wanted to see if there was something stronger than dittany in Professor Snape's stores, but— well, he caught me.”\n“Oh no! What happened?”\n“Nothing, actually. He told me that the only reason Dittany wouldn't be working was if something was preventing it, and\n‘I'd better not hear you have been using Dark Magic, Granger.’\n”\n“No detention?” Harry asked disbelievingly.\nHermione shrugged. “I still don't understand what is wrong with dittany. We know the quill is not the problem as it was healing before. Why isn't it now?”\n“It works enough,” Harry mumbled, eyes closed. “Enough for me to be able to…”\nHe was asleep before he finished the sentence.\nWhen Harry woke up, the bowl of dittany had fallen to the floor and there was an awful crick in his neck. His hand was throbbing dully and he lifted it up to look at it with bleary eyes.\nThe words were swollen and disfigured, and Harry could only make them out because he knew what it said. Harry touched it slightly and hissed at the burn, dropping his hand. Firmly pushing it out of his mind, he picked up the bag that he'd dropped the night before and settled down to do his homework. He doubted he would manage to finish even one essay, but he couldn't bring himself to care.\nHe changed his mind later that morning as he looked up at Snape's angry eyes.\n“Detention, Potter. After dinner.”\n“Can't,” Harry said. “Got detention with Umbridge.”\nSnape's lips thinned. “After, then. Or is that too late for Mr. Celebrity?”\nHarry could have argued that he did need to sleep, but he just didn't have the energy. Instead, he just nodded and started on his potion, ignoring Hermione's furious inquiries.\nAfter dinner found Harry back in Umbridge's office. It had been two hours, and Harry was dreading the long detention still ahead of him when Umbridge spoke.\n“That will do.”\nHarry looked up in surprise. Umbridge had a sour look on her face that reminded him of Aunt Petunia.\n“Professor Snape could not find any other time for your detention, but you\nwill\nmake it up to me, Mr. Potter.”\nHarry squashed down his disgust. “Of course, Professor.”\nHardly believing his luck, Harry started the long trek to the dungeons. Why did Snape's office have to be so far away?\nFinally, Snape's door appeared, and Harry lifted a heavy hand to knock on it.\n“Come in!”\nHarry pushed the door open with considerable effort.\n“You are late, Potter.”\n“Just back from detention,” Harry said, too tired to glare. There were a few dozen cauldrons stacked in the corner, and Harry headed for them, before Snape's voice stopped him in his tracks.\n“Did I say you were to do cauldrons?”\n“Sorry,” Harry turned to Snape. “What am I going to do then?”\n“Lines.” Snape smiled cruelly.\nHarry stared. Since when did Snape have him do lines?\n“Well?” Snape snapped. “Get on with it.”\nFeeling like he was dreaming again, Harry sat down on the chair. Thankfully, the quill besides the parchment was a regular quill.\n“What should I write?”\n“What should I write, Sir?”\n“I must do my homework on time.”\n“Right.” Harry bent down to begin his lines, but he could still feel Snape’s eyes on him.\n“What is wrong with your hand, Potter?”\n“What?” Harry asked, confused. “Nothing.”\nHe put the quill down and held up his hand for emphasis.\nSnape's brow furrowed. “Do you think me a fool? Other hand.”\nHarry reluctantly opened the left hand towards Snape, palm up. Snape yanked at it and turned it over, and Harry winced.\nIt looked even worse than it had in the morning. The whole area was bright red so that the harsh words couldn't be seen anymore, and bright yellow splotches were visible.\n“Have you tried dittany?”\nHarry looked back at Snape’s sharp voice. He looked even angrier than normal, which was saying something.\n“Yeah,” Harry shrugged. It worked in the beginning, but slowly it just— stopped.”\n“How long has this been going on?” Snape asked, summoning a jar. Harry caught sight of the label as it flew into Snape's hand —\nAntibacterial Aloe Cream.\n“Dunno,” Harry said. “A month, maybe.”\n“Are you feeling cold? Or feverish?\n“Yeah,” Harry muttered, looking at Snape's desk. He felt exposed, and if his hand hadn't been so tightly held by Snape, he might have run off.\nFinally, Snape released his hand and drew his wand. Harry tensed.\n“A diagnostic Charm.”\nSnape waved his wand and Harry felt a warmth spread through him, which left as quickly as it had come.\n“How shocking. You have an infection. When did you last eat?”\n“Dinner,” Harry mumbled.\n“Let me define eating, then. It refers to the act of putting food in your mouth, chewing, and swallowing it. Keeping that in mind, when did you last eat?”\nHarry shrugged, going red with embarrassment.\nSnape sighed. “You have detention every day —”\n“Hey!” Harry protested, his anger flaring up. “What for?!”\n“— After dinner,” Snape continued, speaking over him. “You have been unnaturally disruptive, and this is the only time I can spare out of my busy day to oversee your detentions.”\n“Oh.

What you want for your own family is one thing, dictating to others is entirely different.”\n“And anyway,” Jo added, “it would be perfectly possible for the husband to resign and the wife to continue to work.”\nGiles looked at her and shook his head. “No, that’s not the way it is.”\nJo’s expression was such that Ros messaged her, ‘You look like an angry cat, who’s about to spit at someone. Probably better not to.’ Jo grinned at Ros.\nGiles glanced round the room and then said, “You’re very quiet, Lucas. I presume your views are similar to mine, but you haven’t got the confidence to express them.”\nLucas went white and moved towards Giles. As he did so, Malcolm put his hands on his shoulders and said, “Why don’t you go and find Adam?”\nAs Lucas headed out of the Grid, Ros marched into Harry’s office. “Unless you want a dead body on the floor, I suggest you get rid of your latest recruit,” she said.\n“Which weapon is being employed?” Harry asked.\n“Lethal venom spat by Jo, strangulation with a cable by Malcolm, or I’ll use unarmed combat. But if you would prefer we deal with the corpse ourselves, I can recall Adam and Lucas to dispose of the body.”\n“No, I’ll deal with it.” Harry went to his door and called out, “Giles, a word, please.”\nGiles walked into Harry’s office and failed to close the door behind him. Harry noticed this, but instead of asking him to do so, began, “Congratulations, in half a morning you have managed to alienate the whole of my team. One could almost think you were an enemy agent, but even they would have the sense to know that by doing this they would make absolutely no progress.”\n“I don’t understand. I simply…”\n“You leapt in without any concept of the dynamics of the office. We are supposed to be preparing you to enter the field, but that means learning to blend in and particularly keeping your mouth shut until you have a good understanding of the situation. You will be reassigned.”\n“I don’t think…”\n“Shut up! And sit there while I make the necessary phone call.”\nA few minutes later, Harry said, “Right, you’re to report to Section M.”\nGiles left, clearly furious at the way he’d been treated.\n“Will there be any comeback?” Ros asked.\n“No,” Harry replied. “At the moment he’s a liability to any team he’s assigned to, and there’s far too great a risk he’d compromise any operation he was involved in. He’s applied to go abroad, but without being able to blend in, which he clearly can’t, he could be dead within a week. He’s not happy, but at least this way he might live long enough to see the children he seems to be setting so much store on.”",

        "writing_prompt": "In the heart of Erebor, where music once filled the halls but had long since fallen silent, Bilbo embarks on a secret mission to restore a broken harp from Thorin's past, hoping to heal more than just the instrument.",
        "story": "\"The only truth is music\" - Jack Kerouac\nAmidst the great Dwarven halls, with the strike of pick and hammer conducting the percussive beat of honest toil, music grew like weeds amidst freshly tilled soil. From their earliest days, crafting down in the dark, dwarves had lifted their voices in song, the caverns they carved into their mountainsides carrying the tunes from dawn until dusk. They sang, and the earth that cradled them sang back, sharing in their joys and sorrows.\nTo his shame, Bilbo had been surprised that the Company all played instruments. In his prejudice, he had failed to understand how a dwarf could be made rough and course by hard work, but still carry the grace in their fingers to play with any skill. They all soon proved him wrong. There was not a dwarf among them who did not seem to have a flute or pipe ferreted away in their pack, and they came out often, their tunes bright and cheery as they made their way over the land.\nYet it was only once they were back in Erebor that Bilbo realised that even their celebration of music had been whittled away by necessity. They had kept with them the instruments they could carry as they fled. Only now that the Lonely Mountain was slowly reclaiming its splendour did the Master Craftsmen turn their attentions to their heritage once more. Slowly, the voices of those dwarves hard at work and raised in song were joined by the tuneful dapple of strings and flutes and brass.\nStill, to Bilbo, it felt as if one part of Erebor's great orchestral rebirth was missing. He knew, from stories told on the roads over Middle-earth, that Thorin, in his youth, had played the harp. Balin had confided in him, his eyes bright with recollection, how beautifully he had once played, before the dragon came and turned all he loved to ash. The instrument had been left behind amidst the embers of Thorin's old life: too big and unwieldy to be saved.\nThat was why he was here with Bofur, up in the wrecked remnants of the royal chambers, opening up old doorways and viewing the calamity confined within their walls.\n'A right mess, this is,' Bofur murmured, his usual good humour eclipsed by the destruction. 'It'll take years to repair.'\n'And Thorin has prioritised every other part of the mountain.' Bilbo sighed. He understood why he did it. Thorin's heart lay with his people. He did not care for the symbols of status that his grandfather had held in such high esteem. He would rather sleep on a rug before an open fire than live in luxury while his people went hungry.\nBofur grunted, and now, at last, there was a touch of a sparkle in his eye. 'He won't get a choice in the matter before long. For now, the dwarves arriving in Erebor are grateful for his humbleness, but soon they'll insist he climb back on his pedestal and stop getting his hands dirty. You'll have to soothe a lot of ruffled feathers.'\nBilbo cast a look in Bofur's direction, shaking his head before lifting his torch higher. 'That's why we're here, remember? To do something for Thorin, since he will not take the time to do it for himself.'\n'First, we have to find the thrice-damned thing, assuming Smaug left any of it behind.'\nThat was a valid concern. Even here, after traversing the ruined, twisted staircase, made narrow and precipitous by Smaug's ruination, he could see signs of the dragon's invasion. Gouges scored the walls, disrupting the marble's exquisite sheen. Tapestries had been ripped from their moorings, their fine silks and gold thread hoarded amidst the mountain of treasure. Delicate glass windowpanes, worthless to the wyrm but expensive all the same, had been smashed in his wrath. What remained was a skeleton of grandeur, and one that would linger in its sad state for some time yet.\n'Bilbo, here!' Bofur's voice was hushed, as if he had disturbed some poor soul's tomb.\nBilbo crept forward, lifting his lantern higher to let its light pour into the chamber he'd revealed. It was then, with a flash of grief, that he realised a body of a sort had found its rest here. The once graceful arch of a harp lay, its pillar broken and its soundboard cracked. Many of the strings had snapped or come loose from their pegs. It was a sad sight, but something in him rebelled, determined to find whatever small life might linger in the instrument's shattered frame.\n'There must be something we can do.'\nBofur rubbed a finger up the bridge of his nose before adjusting his hat with his palm, his dark eyes black and thoughtful in the meagre light. 'I'm a toy-maker,' he pointed out. 'I don't think \"we\" is the word you're looking for, but...' He hunkered down, setting the lantern on the floor and sucking in a breath through his teeth. 'It's not rotten. That's a start. Looks like it was smashed against the wall. Key bits of the frame will have to be replaced, and that needs the right kind of wood and hands with the skill to fix it.'\n'But it can be done?' He didn't mean to sound quite like that – achingly desperate – but the dwarf he loved carried a multitude of hurts. Not merely the physical ones, which had almost claimed his life, but ones upon his soul. This, Bilbo knew, was as much part of the healing as Oin's tinctures and constant nagging to rest and eat.\n'Aye, I think so. It'll be a challenge, but I know more than one dwarf who lives for this sort of thing, and to do it for our King? They'll rise to the occasion.' Bofur gave Bilbo a look, full of the soft fondness of friendship. 'This was a grand idea, Bilbo. Leave it with me.'\nIt took time, as all such things did. True craftsmanship could not be rushed, and the broken body of Thorin's old harp was an invalid in need of delicate care. Bilbo dropped by often, nervous, at first, that Master Mothi would view his presence at an intrusion. However, the kind old dwarf, busily training an apprentice, was more than happy to talk about his craft as long as Bilbo kept his hands in his pockets.\n'I remember when my master first built it,' he confided one day, as his gnarled hands stroked along the sound box, testing it for any small flaw that might break the harp's voice. 'The look on the face of the young prince as he played! I recall his only complaint was one he made to his mother, and that was a criticism of his grandfather's decorative taste.'\n'How do you mean?'\n'The old king had it carved and covered from crown to base in gold leaf. Delicate work. Challenging, too. It made the harp more fragile. The sound a touch less pure. My master was unhappy to do it, but we had our instructions.'\n'No gold, this time,' Bilbo decided, feeling in his heart how Thorin would rather the wood's grain could shine through. He would wish the strings to sing with their truest voice, more admiring of the harp's function than its form.\n'Perhaps an inlay, here?' Mothi stroked his palm down the front of the pillar. 'Something shallow, so as not to compromise its strength. I have a wonderful alloy: brass with a touch of mithril. It gives a wonderful sheen and need never be polished. Geometric, perhaps?'\nBilbo hid a smile before inclining his head. He had not wanted to say anything about the graceful lines of the harp, though he had noticed that there were some fundamental differences between the ones he had seen in Rivendell and this specimen. Even broken, he could tell Thorin's harp had a subtle angularity to its form, something sharper, where the elves favoured the sweeping curve.\n'Will it be much longer?' he asked, eyeing the framework, which to him looked as good as whole, but as yet unstrung.\n'Another week, maybe two.' Mothi gave him a knowing look. 'You cannot rush perfection.'\n'And I would not wish you to. Thank you.'\nHe tried to set it from his mind, the secret slowly taking shape beneath Mothi's hands. During the day, when there was much to be done, he did a fair job. Yet it was in the evening, when he and Thorin retired to their shared chamber in the overseer's quarters that he felt the strange, amorphous absence of it. He observed how Thorin seemed to not know how to draw the boundary between work and rest. He carried his tension with him, his mind forever caught up in the needs of his kingdom without a moment of respite.\nSo it was that, the day the harp was ready, and stolen carefully into their chambers, Bilbo found himself alight with nervous anticipation. He hoped that this had been the right thing to do. He prayed that he was healing a wound in Thorin's being, rather than ripping off a scab to leave him bleeding anew.\n'We need to finish treating with the merchant guild. They have their eye on the treasury, as always, but I will not allow them to –' Thorin's words stumbled to silence as he preceded Bilbo over the threshold. His next breath was an odd little hitch, as if his lungs had forgotten how to work, and Bilbo sank his teeth into his bottom lip, praying he had not made a grave mistake.\n'This is...' Thorin swayed before stepping forward, reaching out with shaking fingertips to rest them against the harp's pillar like a healer checking for a pulse, reaching for the life that resided once more in the instrument's beautiful frame. The strings gleamed, waiting to be stirred into song, and Bilbo was almost sure he could hear them humming softly, like a cat purring in the presence of one who loved it. 'Where did you find this?'\n'The Royal Wing.' Bilbo shifted forward. 'It had been broken and forgotten, but there was enough of it left to save.' He swallowed, thinking how those words were not for the harp alone. They could be said about the kingdom around them and the line that ruled it just as easily. 'Master Mothi remade it, keeping as much of the original as he could. I thought you deserved something out of all this that was yours alone.'\nThorin turned, sweeping Bilbo into his arms, his brow a warm press against Bilbo's own. It was an assertive embrace, as if Thorin were trying to press everything he could not put into words down into Bilbo's bones, and the kiss that followed it had Bilbo's toes curling against the flagstones.\n'You like it, then?' he managed, delightfully breathless when Thorin reluctantly eased back, those rich blue eyes all softness and delight.\n'More than almost anything, except for you,' Thorin promised, his voice low and resonant in a way that set love thrilling through Bilbo, spreading beneath his ribs to pool in the hollow of his belly.\n'Will you play?' he asked, feeling as if it were some moment of truth. He had heard Thorin sing, his voice soft and deep, but this was another matter. He knew how talented those hands could be, and now he wanted to see them there, coaxing sound from an instrument that had been silent for far too long.\n'It would be a crime not to, though I warn you, I am out of practice.'\nThough Bilbo could well-believe the claim, he could hear no flaw in Thorin's playing. At first, perhaps, he was a touch hesitant, learning this old friend anew, but before long the music swelled around them, filling their chamber with its magic. It was not the ethereal, haunting melody of the elves, but something faster and deeper, the pitch of the harp more resonant: fitting for the booming mountain halls. It made Bilbo's heart race and quickened his blood. He let his eyes drift shut, the better to lose himself in the melody, and it was only when Thorin stopped that he opened them once more.\n'That was beautiful,' he murmured, feeling a little drunk – transported to somewhere glorious by Thorin's playing.\n'Would you like to learn?'\nBilbo's first thought was an instinctive refusal: the instrument too fine and his skill non-existent. Yet there was a gleam of something in Thorin's eye that made him think about how dwarves saw music – not as something to be performed for praise, but something to be shared with one another: the good and the bad. Skill was not as essential to them as the simple act of creation, and that was something he knew Thorin sought to share with Bilbo at every opportunity.\n'I can't even read a stave,' he warned, reaching out to take Thorin's hand and allowing himself to be guided closer, to cradle the harp between his spread legs like a lover, and set hesitant fingers upon its strings.\n'You don't need to. We rarely write down our songs. They are fluid things, learned and adapted, simplified and embellished.' Thorin stood behind him, bending to place his larger, broader hands over Bilbo's own. Warm, calloused fingers showed him how to move, teaching him where to pluck the strings and where to soothe them, leading him through it like he might lead a partner through a dance.\nAnd so it was that, slowly, music raised its voice once more in the halls of the Lonely Mountain once more. The tune carried, bright and true, through the turn of the seasons until the melody of love at the kingdom's heart became a symphony of prosperity for the whole realm to enjoy.\nFor all the years to come.",

There was not a dwarf among them who did not seem to have a flute or pipe ferreted away in their pack, and they came out often, their tunes bright and cheery as they made their way over the land.\nYet it was only once they were back in Erebor that Bilbo realised that even their celebration of music had been whittled away by necessity. They had kept with them the instruments they could carry as they fled. Only now that the Lonely Mountain was slowly reclaiming its splendour did the Master Craftsmen turn their attentions to their heritage once more. Slowly, the voices of those dwarves hard at work and raised in song were joined by the tuneful dapple of strings and flutes and brass.\nStill, to Bilbo, it felt as if one part of Erebor's great orchestral rebirth was missing. He knew, from stories told on the roads over Middle-earth, that Thorin, in his youth, had played the harp. Balin had confided in him, his eyes bright with recollection, how beautifully he had once played, before the dragon came and turned all he loved to ash. The instrument had been left behind amidst the embers of Thorin's old life: too big and unwieldy to be saved.\nThat was why he was here with Bofur, up in the wrecked remnants of the royal chambers, opening up old doorways and viewing the calamity confined within their walls.\n'A right mess, this is,' Bofur murmured, his usual good humour eclipsed by the destruction. 'It'll take years to repair.'\n'And Thorin has prioritised every other part of the mountain.' Bilbo sighed. He understood why he did it. Thorin's heart lay with his people. He did not care for the symbols of status that his grandfather had held in such high esteem. He would rather sleep on a rug before an open fire than live in luxury while his people went hungry.\nBofur grunted, and now, at last, there was a touch of a sparkle in his eye. 'He won't get a choice in the matter before long. For now, the dwarves arriving in Erebor are grateful for his humbleness, but soon they'll insist he climb back on his pedestal and stop getting his hands dirty. You'll have to soothe a lot of ruffled feathers.'\nBilbo cast a look in Bofur's direction, shaking his head before lifting his torch higher. 'That's why we're here, remember? To do something for Thorin, since he will not take the time to do it for himself.'\n'First, we have to find the thrice-damned thing, assuming Smaug left any of it behind.'\nThat was a valid concern. Even here, after traversing the ruined, twisted staircase, made narrow and precipitous by Smaug's ruination, he could see signs of the dragon's invasion. Gouges scored the walls, disrupting the marble's exquisite sheen. Tapestries had been ripped from their moorings, their fine silks and gold thread hoarded amidst the mountain of treasure. Delicate glass windowpanes, worthless to the wyrm but expensive all the same, had been smashed in his wrath. What remained was a skeleton of grandeur, and one that would linger in its sad state for some time yet.\n'Bilbo, here!' Bofur's voice was hushed, as if he had disturbed some poor soul's tomb.\nBilbo crept forward, lifting his lantern higher to let its light pour into the chamber he'd revealed. It was then, with a flash of grief, that he realised a body of a sort had found its rest here. The once graceful arch of a harp lay, its pillar broken and its soundboard cracked. Many of the strings had snapped or come loose from their pegs. It was a sad sight, but something in him rebelled, determined to find whatever small life might linger in the instrument's shattered frame.\n'There must be something we can do.'\nBofur rubbed a finger up the bridge of his nose before adjusting his hat with his palm, his dark eyes black and thoughtful in the meagre light. 'I'm a toy-maker,' he pointed out. 'I don't think \"we\" is the word you're looking for, but...' He hunkered down, setting the lantern on the floor and sucking in a breath through his teeth. 'It's not rotten. That's a start. Looks like it was smashed against the wall. Key bits of the frame will have to be replaced, and that needs the right kind of wood and hands with the skill to fix it.'\n'But it can be done?' He didn't mean to sound quite like that – achingly desperate – but the dwarf he loved carried a multitude of hurts. Not merely the physical ones, which had almost claimed his life, but ones upon his soul. This, Bilbo knew, was as much part of the healing as Oin's tinctures and constant nagging to rest and eat.\n'Aye, I think so. It'll be a challenge, but I know more than one dwarf who lives for this sort of thing, and to do it for our King? They'll rise to the occasion.' Bofur gave Bilbo a look, full of the soft fondness of friendship. 'This was a grand idea, Bilbo. Leave it with me.'\nIt took time, as all such things did. True craftsmanship could not be rushed, and the broken body of Thorin's old harp was an invalid in need of delicate care. Bilbo dropped by often, nervous, at first, that Master Mothi would view his presence at an intrusion. However, the kind old dwarf, busily training an apprentice, was more than happy to talk about his craft as long as Bilbo kept his hands in his pockets.\n'I remember when my master first built it,' he confided one day, as his gnarled hands stroked along the sound box, testing it for any small flaw that might break the harp's voice. 'The look on the face of the young prince as he played! I recall his only complaint was one he made to his mother, and that was a criticism of his grandfather's decorative taste.'\n'How do you mean?'\n'The old king had it carved and covered from crown to base in gold leaf. Delicate work. Challenging, too. It made the harp more fragile. The sound a touch less pure. My master was unhappy to do it, but we had our instructions.'\n'No gold, this time,' Bilbo decided, feeling in his heart how Thorin would rather the wood's grain could shine through. He would wish the strings to sing with their truest voice, more admiring of the harp's function than its form.\n'Perhaps an inlay, here?' Mothi stroked his palm down the front of the pillar. 'Something shallow, so as not to compromise its strength. I have a wonderful alloy: brass with a touch of mithril. It gives a wonderful sheen and need never be polished. Geometric, perhaps?'\nBilbo hid a smile before inclining his head. He had not wanted to say anything about the graceful lines of the harp, though he had noticed that there were some fundamental differences between the ones he had seen in Rivendell and this specimen. Even broken, he could tell Thorin's harp had a subtle angularity to its form, something sharper, where the elves favoured the sweeping curve.\n'Will it be much longer?' he asked, eyeing the framework, which to him looked as good as whole, but as yet unstrung.\n'Another week, maybe two.' Mothi gave him a knowing look. 'You cannot rush perfection.'\n'And I would not wish you to. Thank you.'\nHe tried to set it from his mind, the secret slowly taking shape beneath Mothi's hands. During the day, when there was much to be done, he did a fair job. Yet it was in the evening, when he and Thorin retired to their shared chamber in the overseer's quarters that he felt the strange, amorphous absence of it. He observed how Thorin seemed to not know how to draw the boundary between work and rest. He carried his tension with him, his mind forever caught up in the needs of his kingdom without a moment of respite.\nSo it was that, the day the harp was ready, and stolen carefully into their chambers, Bilbo found himself alight with nervous anticipation. He hoped that this had been the right thing to do. He prayed that he was healing a wound in Thorin's being, rather than ripping off a scab to leave him bleeding anew.\n'We need to finish treating with the merchant guild. They have their eye on the treasury, as always, but I will not allow them to –' Thorin's words stumbled to silence as he preceded Bilbo over the threshold. His next breath was an odd little hitch, as if his lungs had forgotten how to work, and Bilbo sank his teeth into his bottom lip, praying he had not made a grave mistake.\n'This is...' Thorin swayed before stepping forward, reaching out with shaking fingertips to rest them against the harp's pillar like a healer checking for a pulse, reaching for the life that resided once more in the instrument's beautiful frame. The strings gleamed, waiting to be stirred into song, and Bilbo was almost sure he could hear them humming softly, like a cat purring in the presence of one who loved it. 'Where did you find this?'\n'The Royal Wing.' Bilbo shifted forward. 'It had been broken and forgotten, but there was enough of it left to save.' He swallowed, thinking how those words were not for the harp alone. They could be said about the kingdom around them and the line that ruled it just as easily. 'Master Mothi remade it, keeping as much of the original as he could. I thought you deserved something out of all this that was yours alone.'\nThorin turned, sweeping Bilbo into his arms, his brow a warm press against Bilbo's own. It was an assertive embrace, as if Thorin were trying to press everything he could not put into words down into Bilbo's bones, and the kiss that followed it had Bilbo's toes curling against the flagstones.\n'You like it, then?' he managed, delightfully breathless when Thorin reluctantly eased back, those rich blue eyes all softness and delight.\n'More than almost anything, except for you,' Thorin promised, his voice low and resonant in a way that set love thrilling through Bilbo, spreading beneath his ribs to pool in the hollow of his belly.\n'Will you play?' he asked, feeling as if it were some moment of truth. He had heard Thorin sing, his voice soft and deep, but this was another matter. He knew how talented those hands could be, and now he wanted to see them there, coaxing sound from an instrument that had been silent for far too long.\n'It would be a crime not to, though I warn you, I am out of practice.'\nThough Bilbo could well-believe the claim, he could hear no flaw in Thorin's playing. At first, perhaps, he was a touch hesitant, learning this old friend anew, but before long the music swelled around them, filling their chamber with its magic. It was not the ethereal, haunting melody of the elves, but something faster and deeper, the pitch of the harp more resonant: fitting for the booming mountain halls. It made Bilbo's heart race and quickened his blood. He let his eyes drift shut, the better to lose himself in the melody, and it was only when Thorin stopped that he opened them once more.\n'That was beautiful,' he murmured, feeling a little drunk – transported to somewhere glorious by Thorin's playing.\n'Would you like to learn?'\nBilbo's first thought was an instinctive refusal: the instrument too fine and his skill non-existent. Yet there was a gleam of something in Thorin's eye that made him think about how dwarves saw music – not as something to be performed for praise, but something to be shared with one another: the good and the bad. Skill was not as essential to them as the simple act of creation, and that was something he knew Thorin sought to share with Bilbo at every opportunity.\n'I can't even read a stave,' he warned, reaching out to take Thorin's hand and allowing himself to be guided closer, to cradle the harp between his spread legs like a lover, and set hesitant fingers upon its strings.\n'You don't need to. We rarely write down our songs. They are fluid things, learned and adapted, simplified and embellished.' Thorin stood behind him, bending to place his larger, broader hands over Bilbo's own. Warm, calloused fingers showed him how to move, teaching him where to pluck the strings and where to soothe them, leading him through it like he might lead a partner through a dance.\nAnd so it was that, slowly, music raised its voice once more in the halls of the Lonely Mountain once more. The tune carried, bright and true, through the turn of the seasons until the melody of love at the kingdom's heart became a symphony of prosperity for the whole realm to enjoy.\nFor all the years to come.",

        "story": "\"The only truth is music\" - Jack Kerouac\nAmidst the great Dwarven halls, with the strike of pick and hammer conducting the percussive beat of honest toil, music grew like weeds amidst freshly tilled soil. From their earliest days, crafting down in the dark, dwarves had lifted their voices in song, the caverns they carved into their mountainsides carrying the tunes from dawn until dusk. They sang, and the earth that cradled them sang back, sharing in their joys and sorrows.\nTo his shame, Bilbo had been surprised that the Company all played instruments.

I recall his only complaint was one he made to his mother, and that was a criticism of his grandfather's decorative taste.'\n'How do you mean?'\n'The old king had it carved and covered from crown to base in gold leaf. Delicate work. Challenging, too. It made the harp more fragile. The sound a touch less pure. My master was unhappy to do it, but we had our instructions.'\n'No gold, this time,' Bilbo decided, feeling in his heart how Thorin would rather the wood's grain could shine through. He would wish the strings to sing with their truest voice, more admiring of the harp's function than its form.\n'Perhaps an inlay, here?' Mothi stroked his palm down the front of the pillar. 'Something shallow, so as not to compromise its strength. I have a wonderful alloy: brass with a touch of mithril. It gives a wonderful sheen and need never be polished. Geometric, perhaps?'\nBilbo hid a smile before inclining his head. He had not wanted to say anything about the graceful lines of the harp, though he had noticed that there were some fundamental differences between the ones he had seen in Rivendell and this specimen. Even broken, he could tell Thorin's harp had a subtle angularity to its form, something sharper, where the elves favoured the sweeping curve.\n'Will it be much longer?' he asked, eyeing the framework, which to him looked as good as whole, but as yet unstrung.\n'Another week, maybe two.' Mothi gave him a knowing look. 'You cannot rush perfection.'\n'And I would not wish you to. Thank you.'\nHe tried to set it from his mind, the secret slowly taking shape beneath Mothi's hands. During the day, when there was much to be done, he did a fair job. Yet it was in the evening, when he and Thorin retired to their shared chamber in the overseer's quarters that he felt the strange, amorphous absence of it. He observed how Thorin seemed to not know how to draw the boundary between work and rest. He carried his tension with him, his mind forever caught up in the needs of his kingdom without a moment of respite.\nSo it was that, the day the harp was ready, and stolen carefully into their chambers, Bilbo found himself alight with nervous anticipation. He hoped that this had been the right thing to do. He prayed that he was healing a wound in Thorin's being, rather than ripping off a scab to leave him bleeding anew.\n'We need to finish treating with the merchant guild. They have their eye on the treasury, as always, but I will not allow them to –' Thorin's words stumbled to silence as he preceded Bilbo over the threshold. His next breath was an odd little hitch, as if his lungs had forgotten how to work, and Bilbo sank his teeth into his bottom lip, praying he had not made a grave mistake.\n'This is...' Thorin swayed before stepping forward, reaching out with shaking fingertips to rest them against the harp's pillar like a healer checking for a pulse, reaching for the life that resided once more in the instrument's beautiful frame. The strings gleamed, waiting to be stirred into song, and Bilbo was almost sure he could hear them humming softly, like a cat purring in the presence of one who loved it. 'Where did you find this?'\n'The Royal Wing.' Bilbo shifted forward. 'It had been broken and forgotten, but there was enough of it left to save.' He swallowed, thinking how those words were not for the harp alone. They could be said about the kingdom around them and the line that ruled it just as easily. 'Master Mothi remade it, keeping as much of the original as he could. I thought you deserved something out of all this that was yours alone.'\nThorin turned, sweeping Bilbo into his arms, his brow a warm press against Bilbo's own. It was an assertive embrace, as if Thorin were trying to press everything he could not put into words down into Bilbo's bones, and the kiss that followed it had Bilbo's toes curling against the flagstones.\n'You like it, then?' he managed, delightfully breathless when Thorin reluctantly eased back, those rich blue eyes all softness and delight.\n'More than almost anything, except for you,' Thorin promised, his voice low and resonant in a way that set love thrilling through Bilbo, spreading beneath his ribs to pool in the hollow of his belly.\n'Will you play?' he asked, feeling as if it were some moment of truth. He had heard Thorin sing, his voice soft and deep, but this was another matter. He knew how talented those hands could be, and now he wanted to see them there, coaxing sound from an instrument that had been silent for far too long.\n'It would be a crime not to, though I warn you, I am out of practice.'\nThough Bilbo could well-believe the claim, he could hear no flaw in Thorin's playing. At first, perhaps, he was a touch hesitant, learning this old friend anew, but before long the music swelled around them, filling their chamber with its magic. It was not the ethereal, haunting melody of the elves, but something faster and deeper, the pitch of the harp more resonant: fitting for the booming mountain halls. It made Bilbo's heart race and quickened his blood. He let his eyes drift shut, the better to lose himself in the melody, and it was only when Thorin stopped that he opened them once more.\n'That was beautiful,' he murmured, feeling a little drunk – transported to somewhere glorious by Thorin's playing.\n'Would you like to learn?'\nBilbo's first thought was an instinctive refusal: the instrument too fine and his skill non-existent. Yet there was a gleam of something in Thorin's eye that made him think about how dwarves saw music – not as something to be performed for praise, but something to be shared with one another: the good and the bad. Skill was not as essential to them as the simple act of creation, and that was something he knew Thorin sought to share with Bilbo at every opportunity.\n'I can't even read a stave,' he warned, reaching out to take Thorin's hand and allowing himself to be guided closer, to cradle the harp between his spread legs like a lover, and set hesitant fingers upon its strings.\n'You don't need to. We rarely write down our songs. They are fluid things, learned and adapted, simplified and embellished.' Thorin stood behind him, bending to place his larger, broader hands over Bilbo's own. Warm, calloused fingers showed him how to move, teaching him where to pluck the strings and where to soothe them, leading him through it like he might lead a partner through a dance.\nAnd so it was that, slowly, music raised its voice once more in the halls of the Lonely Mountain once more. The tune carried, bright and true, through the turn of the seasons until the melody of love at the kingdom's heart became a symphony of prosperity for the whole realm to enjoy.\nFor all the years to come.",

        "story": "\"The only truth is music\" - Jack Kerouac\nAmidst the great Dwarven halls, with the strike of pick and hammer conducting the percussive beat of honest toil, music grew like weeds amidst freshly tilled soil. From their earliest days, crafting down in the dark, dwarves had lifted their voices in song, the caverns they carved into their mountainsides carrying the tunes from dawn until dusk. They sang, and the earth that cradled them sang back, sharing in their joys and sorrows.\nTo his shame, Bilbo had been surprised that the Company all played instruments. In his prejudice, he had failed to understand how a dwarf could be made rough and course by hard work, but still carry the grace in their fingers to play with any skill. They all soon proved him wrong. There was not a dwarf among them who did not seem to have a flute or pipe ferreted away in their pack, and they came out often, their tunes bright and cheery as they made their way over the land.\nYet it was only once they were back in Erebor that Bilbo realised that even their celebration of music had been whittled away by necessity. They had kept with them the instruments they could carry as they fled. Only now that the Lonely Mountain was slowly reclaiming its splendour did the Master Craftsmen turn their attentions to their heritage once more. Slowly, the voices of those dwarves hard at work and raised in song were joined by the tuneful dapple of strings and flutes and brass.\nStill, to Bilbo, it felt as if one part of Erebor's great orchestral rebirth was missing. He knew, from stories told on the roads over Middle-earth, that Thorin, in his youth, had played the harp. Balin had confided in him, his eyes bright with recollection, how beautifully he had once played, before the dragon came and turned all he loved to ash. The instrument had been left behind amidst the embers of Thorin's old life: too big and unwieldy to be saved.\nThat was why he was here with Bofur, up in the wrecked remnants of the royal chambers, opening up old doorways and viewing the calamity confined within their walls.\n'A right mess, this is,' Bofur murmured, his usual good humour eclipsed by the destruction. 'It'll take years to repair.'\n'And Thorin has prioritised every other part of the mountain.' Bilbo sighed. He understood why he did it. Thorin's heart lay with his people. He did not care for the symbols of status that his grandfather had held in such high esteem. He would rather sleep on a rug before an open fire than live in luxury while his people went hungry.\nBofur grunted, and now, at last, there was a touch of a sparkle in his eye. 'He won't get a choice in the matter before long. For now, the dwarves arriving in Erebor are grateful for his humbleness, but soon they'll insist he climb back on his pedestal and stop getting his hands dirty. You'll have to soothe a lot of ruffled feathers.'\nBilbo cast a look in Bofur's direction, shaking his head before lifting his torch higher. 'That's why we're here, remember? To do something for Thorin, since he will not take the time to do it for himself.'\n'First, we have to find the thrice-damned thing, assuming Smaug left any of it behind.'\nThat was a valid concern. Even here, after traversing the ruined, twisted staircase, made narrow and precipitous by Smaug's ruination, he could see signs of the dragon's invasion. Gouges scored the walls, disrupting the marble's exquisite sheen. Tapestries had been ripped from their moorings, their fine silks and gold thread hoarded amidst the mountain of treasure. Delicate glass windowpanes, worthless to the wyrm but expensive all the same, had been smashed in his wrath. What remained was a skeleton of grandeur, and one that would linger in its sad state for some time yet.\n'Bilbo, here!' Bofur's voice was hushed, as if he had disturbed some poor soul's tomb.\nBilbo crept forward, lifting his lantern higher to let its light pour into the chamber he'd revealed. It was then, with a flash of grief, that he realised a body of a sort had found its rest here. The once graceful arch of a harp lay, its pillar broken and its soundboard cracked. Many of the strings had snapped or come loose from their pegs. It was a sad sight, but something in him rebelled, determined to find whatever small life might linger in the instrument's shattered frame.\n'There must be something we can do.'\nBofur rubbed a finger up the bridge of his nose before adjusting his hat with his palm, his dark eyes black and thoughtful in the meagre light. 'I'm a toy-maker,' he pointed out. 'I don't think \"we\" is the word you're looking for, but...' He hunkered down, setting the lantern on the floor and sucking in a breath through his teeth. 'It's not rotten. That's a start. Looks like it was smashed against the wall. Key bits of the frame will have to be replaced, and that needs the right kind of wood and hands with the skill to fix it.'\n'But it can be done?' He didn't mean to sound quite like that – achingly desperate – but the dwarf he loved carried a multitude of hurts. Not merely the physical ones, which had almost claimed his life, but ones upon his soul. This, Bilbo knew, was as much part of the healing as Oin's tinctures and constant nagging to rest and eat.\n'Aye, I think so. It'll be a challenge, but I know more than one dwarf who lives for this sort of thing, and to do it for our King? They'll rise to the occasion.' Bofur gave Bilbo a look, full of the soft fondness of friendship. 'This was a grand idea, Bilbo. Leave it with me.'\nIt took time, as all such things did. True craftsmanship could not be rushed, and the broken body of Thorin's old harp was an invalid in need of delicate care. Bilbo dropped by often, nervous, at first, that Master Mothi would view his presence at an intrusion. However, the kind old dwarf, busily training an apprentice, was more than happy to talk about his craft as long as Bilbo kept his hands in his pockets.\n'I remember when my master first built it,' he confided one day, as his gnarled hands stroked along the sound box, testing it for any small flaw that might break the harp's voice.

Would you abandon the Lord's work now, in what is possibly the hour of its completion?\" \"The Lord understands the value of men, brother. And we have too few.\" \"Spare a few more, to finish the work at last. A handful, well-armed but swift, to seek what they can and return within the week. If not to find the weapon, then to investigate the manner of our brothers' deaths. Surely we will not leave our brothers of the Temple unmarked and unmourned.\" The Master stared into the fire that illuminated the barren stone walls of the council room. When he spoke again, there was a quiet in his voice that no other man in the fortress had been allowed to hear. \"How many more Christian souls will go to the gates of heaven at my behest? How many names of Temple brothers will Saint Peter record in his book-- before our work is finished?\" \"Salvation through sacrifice-- it has ever been the way of the Lord,\" the priest answered. \"The blood of the few will preserve the blood of the many, just as the blood of the Son saved his flock. It is the Lord's work that we do, and have the courage to do. And difficult as the path may be, at the end of it lies the redemption of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\" The rhythm of the conversation was familiar to both men. It was the master's role to doubt, and the priest's duty to reassure. \"Thanks be to God.\" Master Galien turned and met the priest's eyes. \"I will send my summons. After supper. Best if they leave tonight.\" The priest nodded. \"By your will.\" \"By His,\" Master Galien said. There was a pause, and then the door closed behind him. --- One by one, Master Galien's servant, Bertrand, found them all: some tending to their horses, some after they left the divine offices of Nones or, later, Vespers. By suppertime, each of the chosen knights had received Master Galien's summons. They were to proceed to the Master's council room immediately after supper, for reasons that Bertrand did not explain, or appear to know. Some of them were not terribly bothered. Three pilgrims currently occupied the lodgings set aside for that purpose; likely they had concluded their penances and required an escort back to the main road. Some of them harbored darker suspicions, though. Secrets did not sit easily in the communal life of the Templars, and some among them harbored secrets they did not care to divulge. Could it be that they had been found out? The Gospel reading at supper, delivered as always by Brother Tancred, was recognizable to the educated among them as the temptation of Jesus in the desert and the calling of the Apostle Peter. Those who had not learned Latin still recognized the oft-cited words: *Poenitentiam agite: appropinquavit enim regnum caelorum.* Do penance: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. At supper's end, they made their way to the Master's council room, down a windowless corridor that led mostly to storage vaults. The door had been left open, revealing sparse furnishings: a long, plain table with wooden benches-- a fireplace in which someone had prepared a steady blaze prior to their arrival-- a stone relief of the Order's emblem, two knights riding a single horse, adorning the wall-- and three chests set against the far wall. Each chest bore the privileged device to which none of them were entitled: a lock. None of \"them\"? It appeared that the summons given to each man had gone to others as well. Who was the Master gathering here-- allies, accusers? To what purpose? And how were they to conduct themselves as they awaited his arrival?",

The Doctor looked at the bow-tie then over at Claudia, exclaiming, \"What? Bow-ties are *cool*. Pumpkin spice lattes are *not*.\" Right on queue, just as they finished the rest of their lattes, The Doctor gave a slight jump as his breast pocket began vibrating with a pulsating green color.

So much so, that Claudia had to yank him back several times to keep him from running out into the street or down an open manhole cover.

Claudia raised a fist, prepared to give it a knock, when she heard the familiar green-lit buzzing coming from her left. On the other side of the door, in the quite tastefully furnished apartment, sat four young guys huddled around a table. On the table lay a very detailed map of what looked like a castle surrounded by weaving labyrinths of forests, swamps, and mountains. And on top of the map sat four plastic figurines of fantasy characters brandishing weapons, along with a couple plastic figures of a troll as well as a dragon further away near the castle. Handfuls of dice and charts of paper lay distributed among the boys as they seemed to be in a heated discussion about what to do with a distraught maiden they found near an overturned cart full of goods. Just as one of them turned to consult an open manual behind him, their apartment door slammed open and The Doctor stumbled into their room, followed a bit more hesitantly by Claudia. \"**Stop** right there, put down those die!\", the Doctor exclaimed poining an accusing finger at the table, \"Nobody touch *anything* on that table!\"",

        "story": "chapter 1: near arrival. John Harmen, a magnate in the steel industry, was dead at the old age of 72. He had made a great deal of money over his life from a relatively obscure background. He had never been truly poor, but he had only in his later life been one of the silver spoon crowd. It was 1934, but despite the economic disaster that had ravaged the country, he had been wise and had remained one of the few that had been unhurt on Black Tuesday, October 29. He wanted a final gathering from those who had hovered around his money for so long, so he had stipulated in his will that they stay a couple of days at his old mansion before they got their rewards for their fidelity, kindness, or received what was due to them from family obligation. Among the mourners and hopeful benificiaries was Bella Welmer, a young wavy-haired blonde almost young enough to have been Harmen'sgranddaughter. She had been his fianc and now stood to get a lot. She had once been what the Romans would have called a legacy hunter, and what people in these days would call a gold-digger. But those who knew her knew that had changed. Though she had just been a greedy teenager looking for an easy way to sit in the lap of luxury, she had come to truly love John Harmen. She openly admitted to her mercenary wishes before, and was the first to criticize herself for them, and meant every word, but she was still here. Another was Lizzy Harkness, a dark-haired woman who was the daughter of one of Harmen's old fishing buddies. Quieter and softer than Bella but decidedly melancholic, it was hard to tell which of them was more beautiful or more likeable. Her father was good friends with Harmen and had died a few weeks before. She wasn't after the money and was here by strict respect. She was a working woman who mourned her father's loss far more than she cared for what she might get. There was also her brother Charlie and Mr. Preston, a teacher Harmen had hired in secret to give Lizzy an educational leg up where her schooling was incomplete. He very clearly had other things on his mind when he looked at the dark girl, but he taught the girl with great skill, even though watching them brought one to wonder who was the more intelligent of the two as Lizzy was unmistakably clever while Preston was what one would call a \"know-nothing know-it-all\" who lacked any real sense and had a lot less learning than he claimed he did. There was also Mr. Jacob Goldduster, a man who was one of the least corruptible people Harmen had ever known and a guy who had always been dependable to do what he could for those less fortunate. He didn't want the money really, but he respected Harmen's wishes. There was also Mr. Peter Venus, a man who seemed very worldly and wise, and who was very handsome. He was a man who really liked the house and was constantly peering into corners, though he never quite said what he was looking for. Learned and suave, the man was beloved by the old Man and a good friend of Goldduster. Also, last and certainly least was Mr. Smiddy. Smiddy was a man badly injured in the first world war, moving about on a peg leg and ranting at all he saw.

        "story": "The Boundary is not an aesthetic structure. It's ugly, made of dull concrete that rises forty feet. It is topped with rolls of razor wire. It wasn't made to be an elegant piece of architecture. It was made to keep the House Wars within House territory, and for that purpose it suffices. The north gate is the most popular transit route between the city and House territory. Despite this fact, it's still heavily fortified. It's manned at all hours by security teams of tenfive men on the House side, five men on the other. Travel through this gate is heartily discouraged by city officials, particularly where civilians are concerned. However, it is still permitted; it is not the duty of the guards to protect individuals from their own stupidity. Supplies are routinely trucked through the north gate. People who dwell in House territorymainly members of the Houses themselvesoften conduct business in the city. There are no real services in House territory save that of the makeshift medical and cybernetics clinics that are strewn throughout. For every other service, the Houses must venture beyond the Boundary. People often gather at the north gate. Tourists flock to it, hoping to catch a glimpse of House activity. Aquarius' news channels station reporters are there often when they catch wind of a skirmish brewing. And then there are the travellers, those willing to pass through the gate into streets left damaged and abandoned by the intensity of the House Wars. These travellers are sometimes just thrill seekers. Some are members of the city's military. Some have legitimate business with the Houses. Some are attending to business that is not in any way legitimate. It is a busy evening now at the north gate. There is a steady stream of vehicles and pedestrians passing through. Sergeant Marek How, officer in charge of the current guard team, is busy checking the papers of a moving van driven by woman whose facial implants give her a decidedly villainous feel. He is used to the sounds of a transient population, motors and horns and the vocal complaints of drivers. What he hears now is different from all of those. It is the high pitched whine of moving machinery, and it is approaching the gate from the House side. Sergeant How instantly has a bad feeling. He turns to stare through the gate, at the line of traffic hoping to exit into the city. The sound is louder now. He ducks his head to speak into the radio attached to his collar, \"Narris, what the hell is that noi\" The last part of his question is drowned out by the sound of gun fire. There is a simultaneous explosion on the other side of the gate. Immediately the sounds of chaos ensue. Drivers on the city side struggle to get out of the gridlock they're encased in. Drivers on the House side are trying to surge forward, through the barricade. And beyond them Sergeant How sees fire and smoke. *What the fuck?* He thinks, backing away, waving to the other guards on his side of the gate. There is no hope of controlling traffic now; all they can do is get themselves out of the way until law enforcement arrives. He steps off the road, narrowly avoiding being struck by a speeding van that has broken through the barricade. He yells a question into his radio and his met by static. The sounds of destruction are much closer now. And then he sees it, the cause of all this. He watches wide-eyed as it wheels into view, crushing vehicles in its path. It is larger than most any other vehicle he has seen. It rolls on three huge wheels with monstrous treads. Through the haze of smoke and fire, Sergeant How sees that it is oddly shaped, sleekly curved and made of pale grey metal. As it passes him he hears the smooth whisper of the wheels, accompanied by the mechanic whine he heard earlier. He also sees something that worries him. He sees the emblem of the House of Kyle painted on its side. He knows instantly what it is. It halts on the city side of the gate. It begins to change shape. The axles are shifting, the wheels rising into the air, and it steadies itself on a tripod of metal appendages. Its round shape splits apart with the sound of hydraulics and the same high whine. It begins to look vaguely man shaped. The small, round nob that has appeared like a head has one glowing blue band across its surfacea sensor strip. More metal appendages are unfolding from within it with an odd grace, and Sergeant How sees that they are not arms. They are massive cannons. Over the radio, the men under his control are screaming questions at him. He fumbles for his radio and gives his answer. \"It's a war machine.\" Everyone has heard about UA's newest military prototype. Nobody to date has seen one, not even the most persistent outlets of the city's media. But the prototype is what is before him now, swivelling on its stand, locating targets and preparing to fire. Sergeant How is no longer thinking about damage control. He is thinking, as the prototype begins to fire weapons that are clearly energy based, that he is not paid nearly enough to deal with shit like this. He is thinking that when all this is over and the dead are being tallied, that UA will deny having sold the prototype to the House of Kyleno, instead, UA will claim it was stolen. The House of Kyle will deny ownership, even though it bears the Kyle emblem. There will be no way for authorities to prove that this attack was intentional, no paper trail, no money to follow. And worst of all, Sergeant How is thinking that the slaughter that is commencing is no accident. It is a trial. The prototype is test firing. The sergeant is now thinking that he needs to get his ass across the street, to the armored barracks where he and his men are stationed when not on duty at the gate. He is thinking that if they were smart, everyone else out in the open would be headed there too. That is the last thought he has. Seconds later he is dead, caught in one of the first shots fired by the UA prototype war machine. It's up to everyone else here to survive.",

Aquarius' news channels station reporters are there often when they catch wind of a skirmish brewing. And then there are the travellers, those willing to pass through the gate into streets left damaged and abandoned by the intensity of the House Wars. These travellers are sometimes just thrill seekers. Some are members of the city's military. Some have legitimate business with the Houses. Some are attending to business that is not in any way legitimate. It is a busy evening now at the north gate. There is a steady stream of vehicles and pedestrians passing through. Sergeant Marek How, officer in charge of the current guard team, is busy checking the papers of a moving van driven by woman whose facial implants give her a decidedly villainous feel. He is used to the sounds of a transient population, motors and horns and the vocal complaints of drivers. What he hears now is different from all of those. It is the high pitched whine of moving machinery, and it is approaching the gate from the House side. Sergeant How instantly has a bad feeling. He turns to stare through the gate, at the line of traffic hoping to exit into the city. The sound is louder now. He ducks his head to speak into the radio attached to his collar, \"Narris, what the hell is that noi\" The last part of his question is drowned out by the sound of gun fire. There is a simultaneous explosion on the other side of the gate. Immediately the sounds of chaos ensue. Drivers on the city side struggle to get out of the gridlock they're encased in. Drivers on the House side are trying to surge forward, through the barricade. And beyond them Sergeant How sees fire and smoke. *What the fuck?* He thinks, backing away, waving to the other guards on his side of the gate. There is no hope of controlling traffic now; all they can do is get themselves out of the way until law enforcement arrives. He steps off the road, narrowly avoiding being struck by a speeding van that has broken through the barricade. He yells a question into his radio and his met by static. The sounds of destruction are much closer now. And then he sees it, the cause of all this. He watches wide-eyed as it wheels into view, crushing vehicles in its path. It is larger than most any other vehicle he has seen. It rolls on three huge wheels with monstrous treads. Through the haze of smoke and fire, Sergeant How sees that it is oddly shaped, sleekly curved and made of pale grey metal. As it passes him he hears the smooth whisper of the wheels, accompanied by the mechanic whine he heard earlier. He also sees something that worries him. He sees the emblem of the House of Kyle painted on its side. He knows instantly what it is. It halts on the city side of the gate. It begins to change shape. The axles are shifting, the wheels rising into the air, and it steadies itself on a tripod of metal appendages. Its round shape splits apart with the sound of hydraulics and the same high whine. It begins to look vaguely man shaped. The small, round nob that has appeared like a head has one glowing blue band across its surfacea sensor strip. More metal appendages are unfolding from within it with an odd grace, and Sergeant How sees that they are not arms. They are massive cannons. Over the radio, the men under his control are screaming questions at him. He fumbles for his radio and gives his answer. \"It's a war machine.\" Everyone has heard about UA's newest military prototype. Nobody to date has seen one, not even the most persistent outlets of the city's media. But the prototype is what is before him now, swivelling on its stand, locating targets and preparing to fire. Sergeant How is no longer thinking about damage control. He is thinking, as the prototype begins to fire weapons that are clearly energy based, that he is not paid nearly enough to deal with shit like this. He is thinking that when all this is over and the dead are being tallied, that UA will deny having sold the prototype to the House of Kyleno, instead, UA will claim it was stolen. The House of Kyle will deny ownership, even though it bears the Kyle emblem. There will be no way for authorities to prove that this attack was intentional, no paper trail, no money to follow. And worst of all, Sergeant How is thinking that the slaughter that is commencing is no accident. It is a trial. The prototype is test firing. The sergeant is now thinking that he needs to get his ass across the street, to the armored barracks where he and his men are stationed when not on duty at the gate. He is thinking that if they were smart, everyone else out in the open would be headed there too. That is the last thought he has. Seconds later he is dead, caught in one of the first shots fired by the UA prototype war machine. It's up to everyone else here to survive.",

The Miami class frigate was near the pinnacle of Sol Federation technology and was pride of place amongst the new wave of ships being sent further and further into unknown space. Starbase 4012-B was on the outermost cusp of federation space, the first of its kind in self-sustainable, long-term habitable space stations that the federation hoped would become the standard for galactic expansion. Until humanity cracked the code that allowed for faster than light travel, cryogenics and self-sustainable vessels were the only options to conquer the titanic distances of the void. The SF Spectrum was a relatively small vessel by tonnage comprising of the main crew deck, a small medical and research lab, command section and hull. The hull was currently filled with a wide variety of Sol Federation standard replacement parts and numerous crates of supplies. The SF Spectrum continued on its set course due to the careful diligence of the ships artificial intelligence, codenamed Kelvin, who had ensured the ships safe passage next to the Ghaziabad neutron star. The electrically blue and white star bathed the ship in brilliant light and danced off the many metallic panels on the outer hull of the SF Spectrum. The missions goal, Starbase 4012-B, was currently seventy-two hours away so, as per protocol, Kelvin began the process of awakening the crew. Within the white and blue cyrochamber, the silence was broken by a loud metallic hiss as the various chemicals and nutrients flooded the cyrotubes to awaken the crew. The small, white tiled room adjoined the medical labs and was dominated by the six cylindrical tubes that housed the crew in stasis. Seventy-two hours had been allocated by the Sol Federation to allow the crew to re-acclimatise to the Spectrum and reassess changes to mission parameters since they entered into stasis two months earlier. Starbase 4012-B was a fully functioning city in space essentially, complete with water reclamation, botanic gardens, self-sustaining economic and industrial bases to allow a population of nearly three thousand to easily survive so far away from the comfort of Earth. It was also designed to be used as a staging centre for further colonial ventures to nearby terran-friendly planets in the sector. Starbase 4012-B, like all Sol Federation starbases, followed a strict code of law despite being entirely self-sufficient. In an era of unknowns, especially the eternal fear of extra-terrestrial contact, each starbase was required to send a broadcast back to Gaia with the latest updates and situational reports. Starbase 4012-B had now been silent for three months and tensions were fraying within federation command, no-one knew or wanted to guess what could have happened this far away from the centre of humanity. Starbase 4012-B had been a hot bed of scientific and political gossip since its establishment. Multiple reports had been filed acknowledging several habitable planets within its sensor range and that early mining expeditions to the numerous asteroids and gas giants had found bountiful supplies for future expansion. It was a vital asset and the crew, now dozily awakening from cryogenic slumber, had been assembled from the best in the federation. Each was uniquely suited to their role on-board and, despite only having a brief introductory meeting and mission overview before cryogenic sleep, knew each other on reputation alone. The white and aluminium cryogenic pods slowly ascended into a vertical position on the wall, essential to save space on the ship, and icy fog cascaded out of the seam around the glass observational port. The glass and aluminium panel slid up and each of the crew stepped nervously out onto the grated floor, clothed only in a modesty-saving medical gown.

        "story": "The SF Spectrum continued to scythe silently through the vast chasm of space on its constant bearing. The Miami class frigate was near the pinnacle of Sol Federation technology and was pride of place amongst the new wave of ships being sent further and further into unknown space. Starbase 4012-B was on the outermost cusp of federation space, the first of its kind in self-sustainable, long-term habitable space stations that the federation hoped would become the standard for galactic expansion. Until humanity cracked the code that allowed for faster than light travel, cryogenics and self-sustainable vessels were the only options to conquer the titanic distances of the void. The SF Spectrum was a relatively small vessel by tonnage comprising of the main crew deck, a small medical and research lab, command section and hull. The hull was currently filled with a wide variety of Sol Federation standard replacement parts and numerous crates of supplies. The SF Spectrum continued on its set course due to the careful diligence of the ships artificial intelligence, codenamed Kelvin, who had ensured the ships safe passage next to the Ghaziabad neutron star. The electrically blue and white star bathed the ship in brilliant light and danced off the many metallic panels on the outer hull of the SF Spectrum. The missions goal, Starbase 4012-B, was currently seventy-two hours away so, as per protocol, Kelvin began the process of awakening the crew. Within the white and blue cyrochamber, the silence was broken by a loud metallic hiss as the various chemicals and nutrients flooded the cyrotubes to awaken the crew. The small, white tiled room adjoined the medical labs and was dominated by the six cylindrical tubes that housed the crew in stasis. Seventy-two hours had been allocated by the Sol Federation to allow the crew to re-acclimatise to the Spectrum and reassess changes to mission parameters since they entered into stasis two months earlier. Starbase 4012-B was a fully functioning city in space essentially, complete with water reclamation, botanic gardens, self-sustaining economic and industrial bases to allow a population of nearly three thousand to easily survive so far away from the comfort of Earth. It was also designed to be used as a staging centre for further colonial ventures to nearby terran-friendly planets in the sector. Starbase 4012-B, like all Sol Federation starbases, followed a strict code of law despite being entirely self-sufficient. In an era of unknowns, especially the eternal fear of extra-terrestrial contact, each starbase was required to send a broadcast back to Gaia with the latest updates and situational reports. Starbase 4012-B had now been silent for three months and tensions were fraying within federation command, no-one knew or wanted to guess what could have happened this far away from the centre of humanity. Starbase 4012-B had been a hot bed of scientific and political gossip since its establishment. Multiple reports had been filed acknowledging several habitable planets within its sensor range and that early mining expeditions to the numerous asteroids and gas giants had found bountiful supplies for future expansion.

        "story": "#Jackson Elias ##January 15th, 1925 - New York City, NY >*The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.* &nbsp; -Found among the papers of the late Francis Wayland Thurston, of Boston --- ***Harry, Jeremy, Ruth, Walter-*** The telegram had been terse, but it carried two important pieces of information: Firstly, that Jackson had information--*new* information--about the Carlyle Expedition. The lure of such a claim was obvious; the Expedition had been news simply for happening, and its importance only grew as the tale unfolded. Even years later, if someone could uncover what had happened...fame, credit, and certainly fortune followed. Jackson could hardly be blamed for wanting to pursue it. Hed certainly pursued more cryptic leads for lesser promise of reward--though it was curious. Jackson was *notoriously* secretive about his previous projects while they were underway. What could drive him to break his silence now? The second piece of information was that hed said he needed an investigative *team.* And yet, there had been no instructions to gather associates or reach out to a contact. The conclusion was simple: Jackson had already reached out to others. An expedition of his own, perhaps. There was some time between receipt of Jacksons telegram and the date of the meeting. Plenty of opportunity for a bit of preparation--ensuring affairs were in order for travel, preparing probable gear, but most importantly, brushing up on the Carlyle Expedition itself. Not a difficult task. Any worthwhile periodical--and many of the more salacious rags--ran stories on the Expedition while it had occurred. It simply took a bit of perusal and perhaps a phone call or three to the right people to turn up archival copies. BIG APPLE DATELINE April 4, 1919--ROGER CARLYLE, the playboy whom everybody knows--or knows about--is quietly leaving New Yawk tomorrow to check out the tombs of Egypt! Youve seen the cuties ROGER has found in the nightspots. Who can doubt hell dig up someone--er, something--equally fabulous from the Egyptian sands? --- CARLYLE EXPEDITION EMBARKS FOR ENGLAND April 5, 1919--Led by the fabulously wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle, the Carlyle Expedition departed this morning for Southampton aboard the crack British steamship Imperial Standard. Contrary to earlier reports, the expedition will perform researches in London under the auspices of the Penhew Foundation before continuing to Egypt next month. Readers may recall the enormous party which Mr. Carlyle, now 24, gave at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel upon reaching his majority. Since then, scandals and indelicate behavior have become Carlyles trademark, but he never has become tarnished in the eyes of Manhattanites. Members of the expedition have been reluctant to reveal their purpose in Egypt. OTHER EXPEDITION MEMBERS--Renowned Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew is assistant leader of the team, and in charge of excavations. Dr. Robert Huston, a fashionable Freudian psychologist, accompanies the expedition to pursue parallel researches into ancient pictographs. Miss Hypatia Masters, linked in the past to Carlyle, will act as photographer and archivist. Mr. Jack Brady, intimate to Mr. Carlyle, accompanies the group as general factotum. Additional members may be secured while in London. --- CARLYLE DEPARTS EGYPT July 3, 1919--CAIRO (AP)--Sir Aubrey Penhew, temporary spokesman for the Carlyle Expedition, indicated Monday that the leaders are taking ship to East Africa for a well-earned rest. Sir Aubrey debunked rumors that the expedition had discovered clues to the legendary wealth of the lost mines of King Solomon, maintaining that the party was going on safari in respite from our sandy labors. Roger Carlyle, wealthy New York leader of the expedition, was unavailable for comment, still suffering from his recent sunstroke. Discussing that unfortunate incident, local experts declared Egypt entirely too hot for Anglo-Saxons at this time of year, and suggested that the young American had not been well-served by his democratic enthusiasm, rumored to have led him to personally wield pick and shovel. --- IMPORTANT VISITORS July 24, 1919--MOMBASA (Reuters)--Leading members of an American archaeological expedition arrived here on holiday from digs in Egypts Nile Valley. Our Under-Secretary, Mr. Royston Whittingdon, held a welcoming dinner for them at Collingswood House, where the wit of Sir Aubrey Penhew, expedition co-leader, was much in evidence. Accompanying Sir Aubrey are two Americans, youthful financier Roger Carlyle and medical doctor Robert Huston. The party leaves inland tomorrow, for Nairobi and hunting. --- CARLYLE EXPEDITION FEARED LOST Oct. 15, 1919--MOMBASA (Reuters)--Uplands police representatives today asked for public assistance concerning the disappearance of the Carlyle Expedition. No word of the party has been received in nearly two months. The group includes wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle and three other American citizens, as well as respected Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew of the United Kingdom. The expedition left Nairobi on August 3, ostensibly on camera safari, but rumor insisted that they actually were after legendary Biblical treasures. Carlyle and his party reportedly intended to explore portions of the Great Rift Valley, to the northwest of Nairobi. --- ERICA CARLYLE ARRIVES IN AFRICA March 11, 1920--MOMBASA (Reuters)--In response to clues, Miss Erica Carlyle, sister to the American leader of the lost Carlyle Expedition, arrived in port today aboard the Egyptian vessel Fount of Life. Several Kikuyu-villager reports recently have been received concerning the putative massacre of unnamed whites near Aberdare Forest. Miss Carlyle declared her intention to find her brother, regardless of the effort needed. She brought with her the nucleus of a large expedition. Detailing agents to coordinate supply and other activities with Colony representatives, Miss Carlyle and the remainder of her party depart for Nairobi tomorrow. Her companion, Mrs. Victoria Post, indirectly emphasized Miss Carlyles purposefulness by recounting the rigors of the voyage aboard the Semite ship. --- CARLYLE MASSACRE CONFIRMED May 24, 1920--NAIROBI (Reuters)--The massacre of the long-missing Carlyle expedition was confirmed today by district police representatives. Roger Carlyle, New Yorks rollicking playboy, is counted among the missing. Authorities blame hostile Nandi tribesmen for the shocking murders. Remains of at least two dozen expedition members and bearers are thought found in several concealed grave sites. Erica Carlyle, Roger Carlyles sister and apparent heiress to the Carlyle family fortune, led the dangerous search for her brother and his party. She credited Kikuyu tribesmen for the discovery, though police actually found the site. Among other expedition members believed lost are Sir Aubrey Penhew, noted Egyptologist; New York socialite Hypatia Masters, and Dr. Robert Huston. Many bearers also are reported dead. --- MURDERERS HANGED June 19. 1920--NAIROBI (Reuters)--Five Nandi tribesmen, convicted ringleaders of the vicious Carlyle Expedition massacre, were executed this morning after a short, expertly-conducted trial. To the end, the tribesmen steadfastly refused to reveal where they had hidden the bodies of the white leaders of the expedition. Mr. Harvis, acting for the Colony, cleverly implied throughout the trial that the massacre was racial in motivation, and that the fair-skinned victims were taken to a secret location, there to suffer the most savage treatment. Miss Erica Carlyle, defeated in her efforts to rescue her brother, left several weeks ago, but is surely comforted now by the triumph of justice. --- And so, armed with this bit of foreknowledge and any other preparations, the only thing left to do was to wait. Sure enough, on January 15th, Jackson phoned each member of his would-be investigative team: 8 p.m. at the Chelsea Hotel, Room 410. But the conversation was curt and uninformative; not even *cordial.* Jackson was brusque and nervous, very unlike himself; something was amiss. The man wouldnt say what, though; he begged off all further discussion until the meeting, when he could tell it all once, for all to hear. --- ***Shane-*** Shane received the letter late last year, long before the telegram reached him. It was simple, but eloquent, in Jacksons precise hand--the same Shane had seen in his fathers correspondences, perhaps as often as hed seen the man himself. Much like Jackson, Shanes father had always been gallivanting across the globe on some adventure or another, hunting down anything that had the slightest whiff of the occult. Hed come back all too briefly, speaking endlessly of the wonder he uncovered, and then, scarcely before hed finished the telling of his latest escapade hed be off again, for months at a time, pursuing the next. And so it went: out abroad, giving only letters of his progress; then back home for a fleeting time. Then out, and back, and out, and on, and on Until he *didnt* come back. It had been years now since Shane had heard from his father. He was presumed dead, of course; theyd even held a farce of a funeral with an empty casket, his mother a bawling wreck the whole time. Elias hadnt even appeared for the funeral; hed been too busy researching his next book. He sent his condolences, of course--as did all the other wayward vagabonds who formed his fathers boys club of neer-do-well adventurers. And that had been the last theyd heard from Jackson or any of the others. Until now. The request was simple; straightforward. Jackson wanted his fathers Australia notes, the letter said. He offered to pay for them, and share credit in any discovery that might result. Generous terms, really--not that Shane or his mother needed the money. His father mightve been negligent, but he never failed to provide in funds. Still, credit. That might be worth something. Better still, if it was related to work his father had been doing, perhaps Jackson could provide some clue as to what *happened* to him. Perhaps hed learned something. His father had been heading to Australia--or so he claimed. The notes were painstakingly crafted copies, backups in case something were lost in the field. His father hadnt expected to lose himself, but perhaps...perhaps he could be found. Whatever his condition. Dead. Surely, dead. He couldnt be alive after all this time...could he? Damn it all. When Jackson called on the 15th, Shane found himself agreeing to be there. It was just as well that the author hung up quickly. --- ***Andrew-*** Andrew knew by now that listening to the voices this time may have been a mistake. Theyd told him things before, impossible things--sometimes useful things. But boarding the freighter Hed barely even penned a note for Elizabeth before he slipped away. Surely hed be back, though. She would have to understand when he explained it to her properly. If he could explain it. The voices told him about the man hed followed, too. Jackson Elias. An author, and though Andrew had never read his books, their names were whispered hauntingly in his head anyway: *Skulls Along the River. Masters of the Black Arts. The Way of Terror. The Smoking Heart. Sons of Death. Witch Cults of England. The Black Power.* Charming titles, really. Whatever he tried, though, Andrew couldnt catch the man alone to speak with him. Andrew had managed to pay enough and offer a hand to help in order to board, but Elias had secured passage some other way. Friend of the captain, perhaps. This the voices said nothing about. But it was clear that Elias wanted to keep to himself and speak with as few people as possible. When they landed, Andrew lost him again. Andrew wandered, for a time; there was trouble, briefly. But a reasonably respectable British man abroad in America had little to fear, and soon the voices gave him what he needed: Chelsea. Not a name, but a place. *Eight arrive at eight. Be there. Meet them,* the womans voice implored. *Watch them,* the mans voice countered. The whispers trailed off. --- ***Elizabeth-*** It had felt wrong to hire that private investigator, but just now, Elizabeth was proving herself wise for having done so. *New York!* Just what was Andrew thinking? At least it was on a slow-moving freighter. Shed have ample time to settle affairs *properly* before pursuing him across the Atlantic. Elizabeth didnt much fancy the cost of a passenger ticket, but there werent many other options available. Well. She could let him go, she supposed. *If she were mad.* Her investigator had a colleague in New York, and Elizabeth enlisted the mans services to watch for Andrews arrival. Unfortunately, upon her arrival, Elizabeth learned of certain setbacks in that regard. Andrew had been difficult to track; unexpectedly so. But eventually the investigator did find him--apparently hed been picked up by the police while wandering Harlem in the middle of the night. Theyd released him soon enough, but it had left enough of an impression that word had reached the investigator. Which meant it had reached Elizabeth. Her latest piece of information was that he was enroute to the Chelsea Hotel for God knows what. It didnt matter. This time, Elizabeth would catch him, face-to-face, and get to the bottom of his aberrant behavior. She paid the investigator and dismissed him, and resolved to handle this meeting on her own. --- ***Goldie-*** Harry thought he could give her the slip. Well, not this time. Goldie couldnt just let the mook skate out on his debts. Word would get around. That would be bad for business. A couple of the boys tailed him to some ritzy joint, the Chelsea. No kind of place for the likes of Harry, that was for sure. No kind of place for the boys, either, as it happened. Too many fancy eyes. *Not* too ritzy for Goldie, though, maybe All right, if Harry was heading into a place like this, he must have some high-rolling pal in there, too. Someone who could pay off old Harrys debts with the right*persuasion.* Thatd be best for everyone. Goldie would get paid, Harry would get to keep his dainty fingers, and this friend--whoever they were--would get to feel like a real swell person. Hell, maybe theyd just plug Harry once she was done. Not her business. But one way or another, Goldie was gonna get paid tonight.",
        "claim": "The author structures the narrative through a series of interconnected character perspectives and historical documents.",
        "evidence": "In the story regarding \"a cryptic meeting at the Chelsea Hotel,\" the narrative unfolds through various character perspectives, such as Shane, Andrew, Elizabeth, and Goldie, each with their own backstory and connection to the central mystery. Additionally, historical newspaper clippings about the Carlyle Expedition are interspersed throughout the story, providing context and depth to the unfolding events."

We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.* &nbsp; -Found among the papers of the late Francis Wayland Thurston, of Boston --- ***Harry, Jeremy, Ruth, Walter-*** The telegram had been terse, but it carried two important pieces of information: Firstly, that Jackson had information--*new* information--about the Carlyle Expedition. The lure of such a claim was obvious; the Expedition had been news simply for happening, and its importance only grew as the tale unfolded. Even years later, if someone could uncover what had happened...fame, credit, and certainly fortune followed. Jackson could hardly be blamed for wanting to pursue it. Hed certainly pursued more cryptic leads for lesser promise of reward--though it was curious. Jackson was *notoriously* secretive about his previous projects while they were underway. What could drive him to break his silence now? The second piece of information was that hed said he needed an investigative *team.* And yet, there had been no instructions to gather associates or reach out to a contact. The conclusion was simple: Jackson had already reached out to others. An expedition of his own, perhaps. There was some time between receipt of Jacksons telegram and the date of the meeting. Plenty of opportunity for a bit of preparation--ensuring affairs were in order for travel, preparing probable gear, but most importantly, brushing up on the Carlyle Expedition itself. Not a difficult task. Any worthwhile periodical--and many of the more salacious rags--ran stories on the Expedition while it had occurred. It simply took a bit of perusal and perhaps a phone call or three to the right people to turn up archival copies. BIG APPLE DATELINE April 4, 1919--ROGER CARLYLE, the playboy whom everybody knows--or knows about--is quietly leaving New Yawk tomorrow to check out the tombs of Egypt! Youve seen the cuties ROGER has found in the nightspots. Who can doubt hell dig up someone--er, something--equally fabulous from the Egyptian sands? --- CARLYLE EXPEDITION EMBARKS FOR ENGLAND April 5, 1919--Led by the fabulously wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle, the Carlyle Expedition departed this morning for Southampton aboard the crack British steamship Imperial Standard. Contrary to earlier reports, the expedition will perform researches in London under the auspices of the Penhew Foundation before continuing to Egypt next month. Readers may recall the enormous party which Mr. Carlyle, now 24, gave at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel upon reaching his majority. Since then, scandals and indelicate behavior have become Carlyles trademark, but he never has become tarnished in the eyes of Manhattanites. Members of the expedition have been reluctant to reveal their purpose in Egypt. OTHER EXPEDITION MEMBERS--Renowned Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew is assistant leader of the team, and in charge of excavations. Dr. Robert Huston, a fashionable Freudian psychologist, accompanies the expedition to pursue parallel researches into ancient pictographs. Miss Hypatia Masters, linked in the past to Carlyle, will act as photographer and archivist. Mr. Jack Brady, intimate to Mr. Carlyle, accompanies the group as general factotum. Additional members may be secured while in London. --- CARLYLE DEPARTS EGYPT July 3, 1919--CAIRO (AP)--Sir Aubrey Penhew, temporary spokesman for the Carlyle Expedition, indicated Monday that the leaders are taking ship to East Africa for a well-earned rest. Sir Aubrey debunked rumors that the expedition had discovered clues to the legendary wealth of the lost mines of King Solomon, maintaining that the party was going on safari in respite from our sandy labors. Roger Carlyle, wealthy New York leader of the expedition, was unavailable for comment, still suffering from his recent sunstroke. Discussing that unfortunate incident, local experts declared Egypt entirely too hot for Anglo-Saxons at this time of year, and suggested that the young American had not been well-served by his democratic enthusiasm, rumored to have led him to personally wield pick and shovel. --- IMPORTANT VISITORS July 24, 1919--MOMBASA (Reuters)--Leading members of an American archaeological expedition arrived here on holiday from digs in Egypts Nile Valley. Our Under-Secretary, Mr. Royston Whittingdon, held a welcoming dinner for them at Collingswood House, where the wit of Sir Aubrey Penhew, expedition co-leader, was much in evidence. Accompanying Sir Aubrey are two Americans, youthful financier Roger Carlyle and medical doctor Robert Huston. The party leaves inland tomorrow, for Nairobi and hunting. --- CARLYLE EXPEDITION FEARED LOST Oct. 15, 1919--MOMBASA (Reuters)--Uplands police representatives today asked for public assistance concerning the disappearance of the Carlyle Expedition. No word of the party has been received in nearly two months. The group includes wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle and three other American citizens, as well as respected Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew of the United Kingdom. The expedition left Nairobi on August 3, ostensibly on camera safari, but rumor insisted that they actually were after legendary Biblical treasures. Carlyle and his party reportedly intended to explore portions of the Great Rift Valley, to the northwest of Nairobi. --- ERICA CARLYLE ARRIVES IN AFRICA March 11, 1920--MOMBASA (Reuters)--In response to clues, Miss Erica Carlyle, sister to the American leader of the lost Carlyle Expedition, arrived in port today aboard the Egyptian vessel Fount of Life. Several Kikuyu-villager reports recently have been received concerning the putative massacre of unnamed whites near Aberdare Forest. Miss Carlyle declared her intention to find her brother, regardless of the effort needed. She brought with her the nucleus of a large expedition. Detailing agents to coordinate supply and other activities with Colony representatives, Miss Carlyle and the remainder of her party depart for Nairobi tomorrow. Her companion, Mrs. Victoria Post, indirectly emphasized Miss Carlyles purposefulness by recounting the rigors of the voyage aboard the Semite ship. --- CARLYLE MASSACRE CONFIRMED May 24, 1920--NAIROBI (Reuters)--The massacre of the long-missing Carlyle expedition was confirmed today by district police representatives. Roger Carlyle, New Yorks rollicking playboy, is counted among the missing. Authorities blame hostile Nandi tribesmen for the shocking murders. Remains of at least two dozen expedition members and bearers are thought found in several concealed grave sites. Erica Carlyle, Roger Carlyles sister and apparent heiress to the Carlyle family fortune, led the dangerous search for her brother and his party. She credited Kikuyu tribesmen for the discovery, though police actually found the site. Among other expedition members believed lost are Sir Aubrey Penhew, noted Egyptologist; New York socialite Hypatia Masters, and Dr. Robert Huston. Many bearers also are reported dead. --- MURDERERS HANGED June 19. 1920--NAIROBI (Reuters)--Five Nandi tribesmen, convicted ringleaders of the vicious Carlyle Expedition massacre, were executed this morning after a short, expertly-conducted trial. To the end, the tribesmen steadfastly refused to reveal where they had hidden the bodies of the white leaders of the expedition. Mr. Harvis, acting for the Colony, cleverly implied throughout the trial that the massacre was racial in motivation, and that the fair-skinned victims were taken to a secret location, there to suffer the most savage treatment. Miss Erica Carlyle, defeated in her efforts to rescue her brother, left several weeks ago, but is surely comforted now by the triumph of justice. --- And so, armed with this bit of foreknowledge and any other preparations, the only thing left to do was to wait. Sure enough, on January 15th, Jackson phoned each member of his would-be investigative team: 8 p.m. at the Chelsea Hotel, Room 410. But the conversation was curt and uninformative; not even *cordial.* Jackson was brusque and nervous, very unlike himself; something was amiss. The man wouldnt say what, though; he begged off all further discussion until the meeting, when he could tell it all once, for all to hear. --- ***Shane-*** Shane received the letter late last year, long before the telegram reached him. It was simple, but eloquent, in Jacksons precise hand--the same Shane had seen in his fathers correspondences, perhaps as often as hed seen the man himself. Much like Jackson, Shanes father had always been gallivanting across the globe on some adventure or another, hunting down anything that had the slightest whiff of the occult. Hed come back all too briefly, speaking endlessly of the wonder he uncovered, and then, scarcely before hed finished the telling of his latest escapade hed be off again, for months at a time, pursuing the next. And so it went: out abroad, giving only letters of his progress; then back home for a fleeting time. Then out, and back, and out, and on, and on Until he *didnt* come back. It had been years now since Shane had heard from his father. He was presumed dead, of course; theyd even held a farce of a funeral with an empty casket, his mother a bawling wreck the whole time. Elias hadnt even appeared for the funeral; hed been too busy researching his next book. He sent his condolences, of course--as did all the other wayward vagabonds who formed his fathers boys club of neer-do-well adventurers. And that had been the last theyd heard from Jackson or any of the others. Until now. The request was simple; straightforward. Jackson wanted his fathers Australia notes, the letter said. He offered to pay for them, and share credit in any discovery that might result. Generous terms, really--not that Shane or his mother needed the money. His father mightve been negligent, but he never failed to provide in funds. Still, credit. That might be worth something. Better still, if it was related to work his father had been doing, perhaps Jackson could provide some clue as to what *happened* to him. Perhaps hed learned something. His father had been heading to Australia--or so he claimed. The notes were painstakingly crafted copies, backups in case something were lost in the field.

        "story": "#Jackson Elias ##January 15th, 1925 - New York City, NY >*The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.* &nbsp; -Found among the papers of the late Francis Wayland Thurston, of Boston --- ***Harry, Jeremy, Ruth, Walter-*** The telegram had been terse, but it carried two important pieces of information: Firstly, that Jackson had information--*new* information--about the Carlyle Expedition. The lure of such a claim was obvious; the Expedition had been news simply for happening, and its importance only grew as the tale unfolded. Even years later, if someone could uncover what had happened...fame, credit, and certainly fortune followed. Jackson could hardly be blamed for wanting to pursue it. Hed certainly pursued more cryptic leads for lesser promise of reward--though it was curious. Jackson was *notoriously* secretive about his previous projects while they were underway. What could drive him to break his silence now? The second piece of information was that hed said he needed an investigative *team.* And yet, there had been no instructions to gather associates or reach out to a contact. The conclusion was simple: Jackson had already reached out to others. An expedition of his own, perhaps. There was some time between receipt of Jacksons telegram and the date of the meeting. Plenty of opportunity for a bit of preparation--ensuring affairs were in order for travel, preparing probable gear, but most importantly, brushing up on the Carlyle Expedition itself. Not a difficult task. Any worthwhile periodical--and many of the more salacious rags--ran stories on the Expedition while it had occurred. It simply took a bit of perusal and perhaps a phone call or three to the right people to turn up archival copies. BIG APPLE DATELINE April 4, 1919--ROGER CARLYLE, the playboy whom everybody knows--or knows about--is quietly leaving New Yawk tomorrow to check out the tombs of Egypt! Youve seen the cuties ROGER has found in the nightspots. Who can doubt hell dig up someone--er, something--equally fabulous from the Egyptian sands? --- CARLYLE EXPEDITION EMBARKS FOR ENGLAND April 5, 1919--Led by the fabulously wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle, the Carlyle Expedition departed this morning for Southampton aboard the crack British steamship Imperial Standard. Contrary to earlier reports, the expedition will perform researches in London under the auspices of the Penhew Foundation before continuing to Egypt next month. Readers may recall the enormous party which Mr. Carlyle, now 24, gave at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel upon reaching his majority. Since then, scandals and indelicate behavior have become Carlyles trademark, but he never has become tarnished in the eyes of Manhattanites. Members of the expedition have been reluctant to reveal their purpose in Egypt. OTHER EXPEDITION MEMBERS--Renowned Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew is assistant leader of the team, and in charge of excavations. Dr. Robert Huston, a fashionable Freudian psychologist, accompanies the expedition to pursue parallel researches into ancient pictographs. Miss Hypatia Masters, linked in the past to Carlyle, will act as photographer and archivist. Mr. Jack Brady, intimate to Mr. Carlyle, accompanies the group as general factotum. Additional members may be secured while in London. --- CARLYLE DEPARTS EGYPT July 3, 1919--CAIRO (AP)--Sir Aubrey Penhew, temporary spokesman for the Carlyle Expedition, indicated Monday that the leaders are taking ship to East Africa for a well-earned rest. Sir Aubrey debunked rumors that the expedition had discovered clues to the legendary wealth of the lost mines of King Solomon, maintaining that the party was going on safari in respite from our sandy labors. Roger Carlyle, wealthy New York leader of the expedition, was unavailable for comment, still suffering from his recent sunstroke. Discussing that unfortunate incident, local experts declared Egypt entirely too hot for Anglo-Saxons at this time of year, and suggested that the young American had not been well-served by his democratic enthusiasm, rumored to have led him to personally wield pick and shovel. --- IMPORTANT VISITORS July 24, 1919--MOMBASA (Reuters)--Leading members of an American archaeological expedition arrived here on holiday from digs in Egypts Nile Valley. Our Under-Secretary, Mr. Royston Whittingdon, held a welcoming dinner for them at Collingswood House, where the wit of Sir Aubrey Penhew, expedition co-leader, was much in evidence. Accompanying Sir Aubrey are two Americans, youthful financier Roger Carlyle and medical doctor Robert Huston. The party leaves inland tomorrow, for Nairobi and hunting. --- CARLYLE EXPEDITION FEARED LOST Oct. 15, 1919--MOMBASA (Reuters)--Uplands police representatives today asked for public assistance concerning the disappearance of the Carlyle Expedition. No word of the party has been received in nearly two months. The group includes wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle and three other American citizens, as well as respected Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew of the United Kingdom. The expedition left Nairobi on August 3, ostensibly on camera safari, but rumor insisted that they actually were after legendary Biblical treasures. Carlyle and his party reportedly intended to explore portions of the Great Rift Valley, to the northwest of Nairobi. --- ERICA CARLYLE ARRIVES IN AFRICA March 11, 1920--MOMBASA (Reuters)--In response to clues, Miss Erica Carlyle, sister to the American leader of the lost Carlyle Expedition, arrived in port today aboard the Egyptian vessel Fount of Life. Several Kikuyu-villager reports recently have been received concerning the putative massacre of unnamed whites near Aberdare Forest. Miss Carlyle declared her intention to find her brother, regardless of the effort needed. She brought with her the nucleus of a large expedition. Detailing agents to coordinate supply and other activities with Colony representatives, Miss Carlyle and the remainder of her party depart for Nairobi tomorrow. Her companion, Mrs. Victoria Post, indirectly emphasized Miss Carlyles purposefulness by recounting the rigors of the voyage aboard the Semite ship. --- CARLYLE MASSACRE CONFIRMED May 24, 1920--NAIROBI (Reuters)--The massacre of the long-missing Carlyle expedition was confirmed today by district police representatives. Roger Carlyle, New Yorks rollicking playboy, is counted among the missing. Authorities blame hostile Nandi tribesmen for the shocking murders. Remains of at least two dozen expedition members and bearers are thought found in several concealed grave sites. Erica Carlyle, Roger Carlyles sister and apparent heiress to the Carlyle family fortune, led the dangerous search for her brother and his party. She credited Kikuyu tribesmen for the discovery, though police actually found the site. Among other expedition members believed lost are Sir Aubrey Penhew, noted Egyptologist; New York socialite Hypatia Masters, and Dr. Robert Huston. Many bearers also are reported dead. --- MURDERERS HANGED June 19. 1920--NAIROBI (Reuters)--Five Nandi tribesmen, convicted ringleaders of the vicious Carlyle Expedition massacre, were executed this morning after a short, expertly-conducted trial. To the end, the tribesmen steadfastly refused to reveal where they had hidden the bodies of the white leaders of the expedition. Mr. Harvis, acting for the Colony, cleverly implied throughout the trial that the massacre was racial in motivation, and that the fair-skinned victims were taken to a secret location, there to suffer the most savage treatment. Miss Erica Carlyle, defeated in her efforts to rescue her brother, left several weeks ago, but is surely comforted now by the triumph of justice. --- And so, armed with this bit of foreknowledge and any other preparations, the only thing left to do was to wait. Sure enough, on January 15th, Jackson phoned each member of his would-be investigative team: 8 p.m. at the Chelsea Hotel, Room 410. But the conversation was curt and uninformative; not even *cordial.* Jackson was brusque and nervous, very unlike himself; something was amiss. The man wouldnt say what, though; he begged off all further discussion until the meeting, when he could tell it all once, for all to hear. --- ***Shane-*** Shane received the letter late last year, long before the telegram reached him. It was simple, but eloquent, in Jacksons precise hand--the same Shane had seen in his fathers correspondences, perhaps as often as hed seen the man himself. Much like Jackson, Shanes father had always been gallivanting across the globe on some adventure or another, hunting down anything that had the slightest whiff of the occult. Hed come back all too briefly, speaking endlessly of the wonder he uncovered, and then, scarcely before hed finished the telling of his latest escapade hed be off again, for months at a time, pursuing the next. And so it went: out abroad, giving only letters of his progress; then back home for a fleeting time. Then out, and back, and out, and on, and on Until he *didnt* come back. It had been years now since Shane had heard from his father. He was presumed dead, of course; theyd even held a farce of a funeral with an empty casket, his mother a bawling wreck the whole time. Elias hadnt even appeared for the funeral; hed been too busy researching his next book. He sent his condolences, of course--as did all the other wayward vagabonds who formed his fathers boys club of neer-do-well adventurers. And that had been the last theyd heard from Jackson or any of the others. Until now. The request was simple; straightforward. Jackson wanted his fathers Australia notes, the letter said. He offered to pay for them, and share credit in any discovery that might result. Generous terms, really--not that Shane or his mother needed the money. His father mightve been negligent, but he never failed to provide in funds. Still, credit. That might be worth something. Better still, if it was related to work his father had been doing, perhaps Jackson could provide some clue as to what *happened* to him. Perhaps hed learned something. His father had been heading to Australia--or so he claimed. The notes were painstakingly crafted copies, backups in case something were lost in the field. His father hadnt expected to lose himself, but perhaps...perhaps he could be found. Whatever his condition. Dead. Surely, dead. He couldnt be alive after all this time...could he? Damn it all. When Jackson called on the 15th, Shane found himself agreeing to be there. It was just as well that the author hung up quickly. --- ***Andrew-*** Andrew knew by now that listening to the voices this time may have been a mistake. Theyd told him things before, impossible things--sometimes useful things. But boarding the freighter Hed barely even penned a note for Elizabeth before he slipped away. Surely hed be back, though. She would have to understand when he explained it to her properly. If he could explain it. The voices told him about the man hed followed, too. Jackson Elias. An author, and though Andrew had never read his books, their names were whispered hauntingly in his head anyway: *Skulls Along the River. Masters of the Black Arts. The Way of Terror. The Smoking Heart. Sons of Death. Witch Cults of England. The Black Power.* Charming titles, really. Whatever he tried, though, Andrew couldnt catch the man alone to speak with him. Andrew had managed to pay enough and offer a hand to help in order to board, but Elias had secured passage some other way. Friend of the captain, perhaps. This the voices said nothing about. But it was clear that Elias wanted to keep to himself and speak with as few people as possible. When they landed, Andrew lost him again. Andrew wandered, for a time; there was trouble, briefly. But a reasonably respectable British man abroad in America had little to fear, and soon the voices gave him what he needed: Chelsea. Not a name, but a place. *Eight arrive at eight. Be there. Meet them,* the womans voice implored. *Watch them,* the mans voice countered. The whispers trailed off. --- ***Elizabeth-*** It had felt wrong to hire that private investigator, but just now, Elizabeth was proving herself wise for having done so. *New York!* Just what was Andrew thinking? At least it was on a slow-moving freighter. Shed have ample time to settle affairs *properly* before pursuing him across the Atlantic. Elizabeth didnt much fancy the cost of a passenger ticket, but there werent many other options available. Well. She could let him go, she supposed. *If she were mad.* Her investigator had a colleague in New York, and Elizabeth enlisted the mans services to watch for Andrews arrival. Unfortunately, upon her arrival, Elizabeth learned of certain setbacks in that regard. Andrew had been difficult to track; unexpectedly so. But eventually the investigator did find him--apparently hed been picked up by the police while wandering Harlem in the middle of the night. Theyd released him soon enough, but it had left enough of an impression that word had reached the investigator. Which meant it had reached Elizabeth. Her latest piece of information was that he was enroute to the Chelsea Hotel for God knows what. It didnt matter. This time, Elizabeth would catch him, face-to-face, and get to the bottom of his aberrant behavior. She paid the investigator and dismissed him, and resolved to handle this meeting on her own. --- ***Goldie-*** Harry thought he could give her the slip. Well, not this time. Goldie couldnt just let the mook skate out on his debts. Word would get around. That would be bad for business. A couple of the boys tailed him to some ritzy joint, the Chelsea. No kind of place for the likes of Harry, that was for sure. No kind of place for the boys, either, as it happened. Too many fancy eyes. *Not* too ritzy for Goldie, though, maybe All right, if Harry was heading into a place like this, he must have some high-rolling pal in there, too. Someone who could pay off old Harrys debts with the right*persuasion.* Thatd be best for everyone. Goldie would get paid, Harry would get to keep his dainty fingers, and this friend--whoever they were--would get to feel like a real swell person. Hell, maybe theyd just plug Harry once she was done.

And the food....while every fortnight she could get something that seemed halfway edible, the rest of the time they ate what they had. A week ago, she had some Cherry Blossom meat which, she realized too late, was raw horse. The most recent was tuna eyeballs in porridge. But things were tough all over and she shouldn't complain. This year, rationing had gone into effect for several foods and canned meat, butter and the like had been added to the list. Still, she had made sure everything she ate was at least warm enough to burn, hoping it would kill any pathogens. Not that it did her stomach any good. *This is your own fault.* She reproached herself for the fiftieth time that day. *One word.

However, heading back or diverting was out of the question, would put the Expedition to the Island back a few weeks, something that he couldn't allow. He promised that if they encountered another ship, he would allow her to get off his own and go with the other to its final destination. They had encountered no other ships. Of course not. What kind of ship used steam nowadays? Hadn't most ships switched to fuel? \"Here, come on.\" Liam said, leading her across the deck by the arm. Passing an old seaplane (which was set for emergency search and rescue)to just outside the galley, returning with some small crackers. \"Old trick. Just nibble some of these.\" The crackers tasted a little stale, but they tasted far better than the food she was used to. \"So, you've been here for a while. What do you think of the ship?\" Liam smiled. \"And what are you going to do when we get...there?\" He added. She didn't need to ask where \"there\"was. *************************************** Harold: Harold woke to the feeling of hard stone under his face and soaked clothes, the scent of seawater in his nostrils. Pushing his face from the stone, he felt himself looking into a screaming face. Had he been a child and not a veteran of a war, he would have jumped, startled. But he faced the silent face, the ancient carving of some civilization or another jutting out of the sea. Looking about, he saw what he had feared since he had awoken. His ship, smashed to kindling on the rocks. After the fog had rolled in and the storm had blown them off course, he had feared as much. But something niggled at him as he rose to his feet. Oscar. Where was he? Gauging by what he could see, it had been a while since he had been knocked out. Surely Oscar, if he had been dead, would have washed up too? Unless he had washed up elsewhere.This ancient spar of rocky cove was the only place that someone could safely climb ashore. There, ahead. He could see a pathway up the rocks, along a crumbled causeway. Skull Island awaited.",

The man struggling to survive a massive coronary attack needed his full attention. Father Eusebius moved around the various pieces of medical equipment as he sprinkled the bed of Sextus Agrippa Strabo with holy water, chanting the words of the *asperges me.* As he did so, Dr. Al-Andalus ordered her staff to withdraw to a respectful distance while the Papal Nuncio continued with the rite. Putting his ear close to Strabo's lips, he heard the man's confession. As Father Eusebius gave the stricken man absolution, the words of the prayer were obscured by the rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor. And yet, fragments of the ancient prayer still drifted into the ears of those waiting to speak with the first Roman Governor of Mars. *\"Dmine sancte, Pater omnipotens, aetrne Deus, te fidliter deprecmur, ut accipinti fratri nostro sacrosanctum Corpus Dmini nostri Jesu Christi Fillii tui...\" * The Vestal Virgin, a pagan and unlikely friend of Fr. Eusebius, clasped her hands in an attitude of respect for what was now--and had been for eighteen centuries--the dominant and official Religion of the Empire.

The other, an *Optio* in the Roman Army, watched the rites intently. Two visible scars on his face hinted at the presence of several others hidden under his uniform tunic. Occasionally his eyes left the scene playing out around the sickbed to regard the superior officer standing slightly ahead of him and to his left. Although his eyes rested only momentarily on the Captain, in that brief moment they were able to betray their owner's contempt for the man likely to take command of the Colony while Strabo recovered. *If* he recovered. Father Eusebius continued with the ritual, anointing Strabo with the *Oleum Infirmorum .* During the minutes which followed, each of the prominent members of *Campus Martius* (\"The Field of Mars\" as the colony informally referred to itself) had time to ponder the chain of unlikely events which had brought them all to this moment in time and space. For some, the events of the last year had blurred together. For others, each turning point stood out sharply: the media frenzy accompanying their departure from the Syene launch complex in Aegyptus, the tedium of the long interplanetary flight, the nearly disastrous computer glitches (induced, as it turned out by a saboteur among their number), the capture of the Chinese agent who had been surgically modified to assume the false identity of one \"Lucia Cupro.\" When the squadron of three colony ships finally entered Martian orbit, things had gone from bad to worse: the crash landing of the colony ship *Anchises* with its attendant loss of life, building materials and precious supplies. The desperate struggle to survive on limited rations and damaged equipment. Then there was the excitement accompanying the discovery of water in the ice caves under the Arcadian Plain. That water had meant that the colony's long term viability was assured...or so they had thought. Shortly after the discovery of frozen water, other things had been discovered in the cave as well. Sinister things. Sculptures and artifacts of impossible antiquity offered stark and disturbing proof that Mars had been the home of an advanced civilization over eighty million years before man had emerged upon the Earth. And the Cube...that mysterious green block of ice from which emanated energy of a type never before encountered. It was at about that time that the enemy agent Cupro had been executed and buried in the frozen patch of Martian tundra which served as the colony's graveyard. *But she had not remained dead.* Some unknown force--the Cube, most Romans thought--had served to reanimate her. Even now, the corpse of Lucia Cupro, possessed by the spirit of a long-dead Martian, roamed somewhere outside the pressurized hull of *Campus Martius.* And she...*it*...was not alone. Five other Roman graves lay empty, their former occupants now respawned Martians as well... *\"Benedicat te omnipotens Deus, Pater, et Flius, et Spritus Sanctus. Amen.\" * Fr. Eusebius' final blessing yanked them all back to the present. Kissing his purple stole as he removed it from his shoulders, he walked towards the group. In answer to their unspoken question, he simply shook his head. Whether his reply meant, \"he won't last long\" or \"I simply don't know,\" none of them could tell. \"The Propraetor will see you all,\" Eusebius said. \"First however, Captain Flavius, he wishes to see you. In private.\" Once the others had withdrawn, Decimus Calpurnius Flavius approached Strabo's bed. Assuming that the governor's weakened condition left him unable to speak loudly or clearly, he bent close over the prone form. He was surprised by the speed with which Strabo's hand shot upwards, clutching the material of Flavius' tunic with unexpected strength. \"Flavius, you son of a bitch!\" he growled. \"Leadership of this Colony falls to you while I am thus indisposed, and God help us all for it!

Father Eusebius moved around the various pieces of medical equipment as he sprinkled the bed of Sextus Agrippa Strabo with holy water, chanting the words of the *asperges me.* As he did so, Dr. Al-Andalus ordered her staff to withdraw to a respectful distance while the Papal Nuncio continued with the rite. Putting his ear close to Strabo's lips, he heard the man's confession. As Father Eusebius gave the stricken man absolution, the words of the prayer were obscured by the rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor. And yet, fragments of the ancient prayer still drifted into the ears of those waiting to speak with the first Roman Governor of Mars. *\"Dmine sancte, Pater omnipotens, aetrne Deus, te fidliter deprecmur, ut accipinti fratri nostro sacrosanctum Corpus Dmini nostri Jesu Christi Fillii tui...\" * The Vestal Virgin, a pagan and unlikely friend of Fr. Eusebius, clasped her hands in an attitude of respect for what was now--and had been for eighteen centuries--the dominant and official Religion of the Empire. Beside her stood a patrician woman whose family name was well known in the circles of Imperial power back on Earth. Next to her, a geologist repeated the Sign of the Cross over is own head, shoulders, and torso every time the priest made it over the still form of their hapless governor. \"...*tam crpori quam animae prost ad remdium sempitrnum: Qui tecum vivit et regnat...\" * Two men stood apart from the first group. Their chiseled features and precise postures identified them as *viri militaribus*: military men. The senior of the two, wearing the uniform of a *Navis Praefectus* in the Imperial Roman Navy, stared straight ahead, his countenance betraying nothing. The other, an *Optio* in the Roman Army, watched the rites intently. Two visible scars on his face hinted at the presence of several others hidden under his uniform tunic. Occasionally his eyes left the scene playing out around the sickbed to regard the superior officer standing slightly ahead of him and to his left. Although his eyes rested only momentarily on the Captain, in that brief moment they were able to betray their owner's contempt for the man likely to take command of the Colony while Strabo recovered. *If* he recovered. Father Eusebius continued with the ritual, anointing Strabo with the *Oleum Infirmorum .* During the minutes which followed, each of the prominent members of *Campus Martius* (\"The Field of Mars\" as the colony informally referred to itself) had time to ponder the chain of unlikely events which had brought them all to this moment in time and space. For some, the events of the last year had blurred together. For others, each turning point stood out sharply: the media frenzy accompanying their departure from the Syene launch complex in Aegyptus, the tedium of the long interplanetary flight, the nearly disastrous computer glitches (induced, as it turned out by a saboteur among their number), the capture of the Chinese agent who had been surgically modified to assume the false identity of one \"Lucia Cupro.\" When the squadron of three colony ships finally entered Martian orbit, things had gone from bad to worse: the crash landing of the colony ship *Anchises* with its attendant loss of life, building materials and precious supplies. The desperate struggle to survive on limited rations and damaged equipment. Then there was the excitement accompanying the discovery of water in the ice caves under the Arcadian Plain. That water had meant that the colony's long term viability was assured...or so they had thought. Shortly after the discovery of frozen water, other things had been discovered in the cave as well. Sinister things. Sculptures and artifacts of impossible antiquity offered stark and disturbing proof that Mars had been the home of an advanced civilization over eighty million years before man had emerged upon the Earth. And the Cube...that mysterious green block of ice from which emanated energy of a type never before encountered. It was at about that time that the enemy agent Cupro had been executed and buried in the frozen patch of Martian tundra which served as the colony's graveyard. *But she had not remained dead.* Some unknown force--the Cube, most Romans thought--had served to reanimate her. Even now, the corpse of Lucia Cupro, possessed by the spirit of a long-dead Martian, roamed somewhere outside the pressurized hull of *Campus Martius.* And she...*it*...was not alone. Five other Roman graves lay empty, their former occupants now respawned Martians as well... *\"Benedicat te omnipotens Deus, Pater, et Flius, et Spritus Sanctus. Amen.\" * Fr. Eusebius' final blessing yanked them all back to the present. Kissing his purple stole as he removed it from his shoulders, he walked towards the group. In answer to their unspoken question, he simply shook his head. Whether his reply meant, \"he won't last long\" or \"I simply don't know,\" none of them could tell. \"The Propraetor will see you all,\" Eusebius said. \"First however, Captain Flavius, he wishes to see you. In private.\" Once the others had withdrawn, Decimus Calpurnius Flavius approached Strabo's bed. Assuming that the governor's weakened condition left him unable to speak loudly or clearly, he bent close over the prone form. He was surprised by the speed with which Strabo's hand shot upwards, clutching the material of Flavius' tunic with unexpected strength. \"Flavius, you son of a bitch!\" he growled. \"Leadership of this Colony falls to you while I am thus indisposed, and God help us all for it! By the Mass, if you allow your hubris to run amok and jeopardize all we've worked for, so help me, I'll...\" The machine behind Strabo had been beeping with increasing urgency, and the accompanying oscilloscope trace looked more like a sampling from a seismograph than a heart monitor. The remainder of Strabo's words were lost in a spasm of coughing.",

He knew where to find the Red Star Gang, a trio of small time smugglers recently turned to piracy. According to their source, they'd set up a hideout in the ruins of a crashed Eridani Dominion battlecrusier in the dunes of Ayao, a sparsely inhabited and lawless desert world outside the borders of any major galactic government. The Eridani authorities were offering reasonably hefty bounties for all three of the Red Star Gang: fifty thousand NuCreds apiece, plus an additional fifty thousand as a bonus if all three were brought in alive. That kind of payday could keep the crew fed and the ship fueled for the better part of a solar year. They came up with a simple plan: swoop down out of orbit right above the derelict ship, disable the pirates' own spacecraft with a few quick shots from the *Albatross'* dorsal autocannon, then threaten the entire gang into surrendering without a fight. Easy. Sadly, the tipster neglected to mention that the Red Star Gang had gotten some of the old wrecked battlecruiser's ship-to-ship weapons back online. The *Albatross* had barely entered Ayao's atmosphere when a powerful plasma bolt ripped through the hull. It was hardly the worst damage the ship had suffered in its troubled existence, but it was enough to take the autocannon offline and force an emergency landing about half a kilometer from the pirate base. The crew was lucky enough to endure the bumpy landing with nothing worse than a few bruises and scrapes. The Red Star Gang didn't seem inclined to let the *Albatross* get away with minor damage. Only a few seconds after the landing, a deafeningly loud explosion rang out just a few dozen meters from the craft, blasting a new crater into the dunes and spraying the hull with a shower of sand. The explosion was followed by crazed laughter from one of their targets: Bartholomew Reinoff, better known as 'Bloody Bart', one of the Red Star Gang. A former mercenary demolitions expert, he was toting some sort of massive rocket launcher that looked like it was originally meant to be strapped to a vehicle rather than wielded by a single individual. He was shouting something that was probably some sort of taunt or threat, but was impossible to hear over the din of the explosion. The noise only grew worse as some sort of heavily modified UltraCycle tore out of the hideout hangar, making a beeline for the *Albatross* seated atop it was their second target: Carlotta Enkov, 'Crazy Carly'. Carly was a former military scout, now serving as pilot for the gang. Ignoring the explosions ringing out throughout the dunes, she sped forward towards the *Albatross* and began wildly firing bullets from her cycle-mounted submachine gun, aiming for structural weaknesses in the downed craft. There was as of yet no sign of Ayako Kasumi, the supposed leader of the gang. That wasn't surprising, but it was worrying. 'Shadow' was their infiltration specialist, a stealthy hacker rumored to have previously been employed as a spy for one military agency or another. She was probably relying on the other two to serve as a distraction while she got in position to do real damage. The *Albatross* had lost the element of surprise and the use of their most powerful weapon, but they still had their wits and numerical superiority. They'd make it through this okay. Right?",

A former mercenary demolitions expert, he was toting some sort of massive rocket launcher that looked like it was originally meant to be strapped to a vehicle rather than wielded by a single individual. He was shouting something that was probably some sort of taunt or threat, but was impossible to hear over the din of the explosion. The noise only grew worse as some sort of heavily modified UltraCycle tore out of the hideout hangar, making a beeline for the *Albatross* seated atop it was their second target: Carlotta Enkov, 'Crazy Carly'. Carly was a former military scout, now serving as pilot for the gang. Ignoring the explosions ringing out throughout the dunes, she sped forward towards the *Albatross* and began wildly firing bullets from her cycle-mounted submachine gun, aiming for structural weaknesses in the downed craft. There was as of yet no sign of Ayako Kasumi, the supposed leader of the gang. That wasn't surprising, but it was worrying. 'Shadow' was their infiltration specialist, a stealthy hacker rumored to have previously been employed as a spy for one military agency or another. She was probably relying on the other two to serve as a distraction while she got in position to do real damage. The *Albatross* had lost the element of surprise and the use of their most powerful weapon, but they still had their wits and numerical superiority. They'd make it through this okay. Right?",

He knew where to find the Red Star Gang, a trio of small time smugglers recently turned to piracy. According to their source, they'd set up a hideout in the ruins of a crashed Eridani Dominion battlecrusier in the dunes of Ayao, a sparsely inhabited and lawless desert world outside the borders of any major galactic government. The Eridani authorities were offering reasonably hefty bounties for all three of the Red Star Gang: fifty thousand NuCreds apiece, plus an additional fifty thousand as a bonus if all three were brought in alive. That kind of payday could keep the crew fed and the ship fueled for the better part of a solar year. They came up with a simple plan: swoop down out of orbit right above the derelict ship, disable the pirates' own spacecraft with a few quick shots from the *Albatross'* dorsal autocannon, then threaten the entire gang into surrendering without a fight. Easy. Sadly, the tipster neglected to mention that the Red Star Gang had gotten some of the old wrecked battlecruiser's ship-to-ship weapons back online. The *Albatross* had barely entered Ayao's atmosphere when a powerful plasma bolt ripped through the hull. It was hardly the worst damage the ship had suffered in its troubled existence, but it was enough to take the autocannon offline and force an emergency landing about half a kilometer from the pirate base. The crew was lucky enough to endure the bumpy landing with nothing worse than a few bruises and scrapes. The Red Star Gang didn't seem inclined to let the *Albatross* get away with minor damage.

Quite possibly why their Empire eventually fell. --- --- The Galactic Federation rose from the ashes of the Earth Empire as a way for the peoples of the Galaxy to support one another in their mutual interests, and deter aggressors. This brought new opportunities. Opportunities to tackle old problems. And even the opportunity to profit from facilitating the actions which were agreed upon. One thing looked certain. In some form or another, the Galactic Federation would form its own space navy. Andertenna was keen to lend its shipyards to the task. Ice Warriors and others were lined up to provide troops or training. And the Sigma system, lead by **Sigma19**, was anxious to provide a generous and affordable finance package. Of course each planet would have to play its part, putting up some of the wealth; but Sigma19 would underwrite the undertaking, and provide the initial cash flow; and provide certain guarantees and security to ensure the project would not flounder and nor would any individual planet find themselves in difficulty. A generous package indeed it was - but one surely they would also benefit from. Quite how was unclear. However, that was not the primary concern of our heroes. Prior to the Conference which had lead to the Galactic Navy being mooted, strange deaths had been reported on Sigma19. Reported and covered by one **James Carver** - acclaimed journalist. Unexplained deaths. Seemingly random. Cause unidentified. That much was fairly common knowledge in these parts. What was less well known is that around that time, little red flowers had been very popular. And James friends rather suspected these were related to the deaths. Indeed, they had seen the same flowers around when they had investigated deaths at the Galactic Federation conference. Now **K9** had recovered his stewardship of his TARDIS. He was relieved. For some time, Mr Wolf - a strange, unpredictable AI construct - had rather dominated the consol. He brought **James** and **Tatti** back to Sigma19. James was interested in following up on his former girlfriend, who seemed to have got involved with a criminal gang. Involved, in the sense that she had become its leader. Tatti was interested in following up on the strange deaths they had noted before. And they were all interested in ensuring the danger-hogs they had seen off previously were gone and had not caused any lasting damage. They were also curious to look into the activities of the current President, who was up for election, and seemed to be rather embroiled in intergalactic intrigue - if not directly involved in the said deaths. --- **Cass Willams** meanwhile was visiting Sigma19 for not entirely unrelated reasons. She followed the work of James Carver - and had been fascinated by what he had to say about the strange deaths on the planet. She had arrived here under her own steam to do her own little bit of detective work - and was delighted to learn that Mr Carver himself was actually here, in town, in person! She made it her business to find out where he was, so that they might compare notes. As she looked around the town, she noticed the particular characteristics of the local architecture. In the case of many buildings, low-cost homes occupied the ground floor. Above these, there was often a shop, or a business of some sort. On top of that was a level for parking. Ramps enabled the local cars to be driven up and parked; then little steps lead between the walkways on each level. Sometimes there was another home or office on the same level as the parking, depending on the size of the block and how much parking was needed. Above the parking layer was a very nice-looking home. Sometimes it was a single story apartment, other times it went up two, or even three levels. And above all of *that* was a fancy roof-garden! It was considered a status symbol to own one of those grand apartments. The rent from the shop and lower cost housing helped pay for the whole block. It gave a new meaning to the phrase property ladder! If one could afford to invest in such a block, although it was an expensive outlay at the start, it was a regular income that paid for itself over time. It *did* mean that shopping was disjointed, with one or two shops in every block. Larger dedicated shopping blocks did exist, but they were frowned upon and seen as common. And the roof gardens were a sight to behold! --- In an opulent anteroom, Kirts sat. He insisted on being called Kirts. No title, no surname or forename. Just Kirts. He was the head of the Sigma19 diplomatic party. He was not happy. Krovon Muruch, the President of Sigma19, was unpredictable. Very difficult to lead a diplomatic mission with such an unpredictable leader. And this, of course, was a lose-lose. If Muruch messed up, that was on Kirts. But if Muruch did well, Kirts could claim no glory. **Jeb Richardson** stood before him. He was a military man, but he seemed to have some spark about him.

Sometimes there was another home or office on the same level as the parking, depending on the size of the block and how much parking was needed. Above the parking layer was a very nice-looking home. Sometimes it was a single story apartment, other times it went up two, or even three levels. And above all of *that* was a fancy roof-garden!

        "writing_prompt": "Erin has ventured beyond the forbidden five-mile marker, breaking the commune's rules, but as she surveys an abandoned cabin with a broken window and open door, she hears the sound of hoofbeats behind her—someone from the commune has followed her. Who is it, and what will they do now that they’ve found her?",
        "story": "Huddled in a damp and filthy jacket the lone girl rode slowly in the pre-dawn half light. There was a crispness in the fall air, clean and clear and the cold making each breath a cloud of vapor. Her ratty hood was down despite the warmth it would have provided her against the morning chill and her auburn hair was tied back in a ponytail. The chestnut quarter horse moved at an easy pace under her, following the rutted game trail, careful to pick up its hooves and place them so as to avoid the jutting roots and deadfall beneath the carpet of gold and ochre, red and yellow leaves. Erin sat deep in the saddle but hunched a bit, bow over her shoulder, arrows bundled into a sort of crude quiver made from a leather tool pouch strapped to her leg. Her eyes scanned the shadows along the crest of a low hill where they seemed to gather near the base of the white barked trees. She let her gaze linger on the darkness, confirming its vacancy. Pools of still water riffled black among the brush in the low places. Thin black branches protruded from the water. The edge of the pools fringed with reeds. The tall golden grasses made a hypnotizing sound like a whisper against the horses legs as she ascended the slope and she found her eyes getting heavy. Near the top she let out a short, sharp ho, more grunt than word and shifted her weight in the saddle. Gently she pulled back on the reins though the horse was already stopping. Red dot painted on the trunk of a tree. Nail in the center. A simple, easy to miss marker. Facing opposite the way strangers would come. She sat in the saddle eyeing it. Sniffed. Looked round. All was silent and still. Point of no return, hey Chess. Erin said to the horse and it twitched its ears and knickered as if in response. She rubbed its neck, let her bare hand rest against it a moment. This was the five mile marker. Five miles from home. She wasnt supposed to go past this point. It was forbidden. She wasnt supposed to leave the commune without someone with her either. Was never supposed to go out before dawn or after dusk. None of them were. She patted the horse's neck again. Nudged forward. The horse seemed at first hesitant to resume its earlier pace and instead went on more leisurely. Come on. she urged softly. Another nudge. He picked up the pace. Down the shaded side into the cold, the grasses here damp and high enough to wet her boots. Then up a steep dirt track past the edge of a field of tumbled down and moss-covered rocks. Before the path cut into tree cover she looked out over her right shoulder and could see the lake some miles distant. They called it Silver Lake because the old name had been forgotten and because of the way the shallows shone in the morning light. The sun was on it now, reflecting brilliantly but so near the shoulder of the mountains she rode still in shadow, the sun having not risen high enough yet to reach her. She wanted to stop and take it in longer but she reminded herself she wasnt sight-seeing this time and went on. At the crest of the hill she did stop though. From higher ground it was important to be still and to survey. After a time she dismounted and hitched the horse to a tree. The horses name was Chester; a name given to it by the Bowman's. An animal they had come to own when the trapper John Brannan had decided it was not suited to hunting and passed it along to them. It had ever been wary of the smell of guns and blood and was prone to bolt at the sound of a rifle shot. Taking her bow and arrows she whispered a reassurance to Chester, gave him another rub along his neck and then a pat before she walked out along the ridgeline, eyeing the ground. She watched for animals down in the wooded valley beyond, careful how she stepped, noting the direction of the wind. The hills were criss-crossed with wide cuts between the older, more densely packed forest here. These areas were choked with weeds, low, scraggly brush and stands of thin-trunked saplings. The remains of old ski-runs someone had told her. North of here stood an old place filled with burned out buildings that had once been a great lodge; a place for winter vacations they'd said. No-one went there now. The people that had lived there were all gone now. Nell said they had come to a bad end. The people who had stayed on _after_. Isaac had taken the girls there once, a long time after but the girls had been terrified of the place. There was a sort of superstitious fear of the place even now. Seeing nothing among the trees she crouched and waited. Waited for something like five minutes. Then, at last. _Movement._ Seventy five yards away at the edge of a clearing was movement. Something grey breaking from the dark. She felt her pulse quicken the way it always did. She had the arrow nocked but drew the string now. Raised the bow. Turned her head slightly to exhale, into the breeze not letting the vapor of her breath obscure her vision. It was a bighorn sheep, a ram judging by its wide, curving horns. It had clotted clumps of matted grey and a long white beard, it's alien eyes alert as it nosed the air. Too far away. Too much cover. She would spoil the shot and the noise would scare it off. She tried to remember what Emilie had said about their horns. How much of a curve they were supposed to have to legally hunt them back before the Fall. None of that mattered now of course, but her mind went there. She had always been interested in the way things were even if she sometimes thought Emilie and the others stretched the truth or exaggerated how easy life was by comparison. Erin knew bighorns didnt travel alone and since there was no shot to take, lowered her bow. She watched. There were four more. Tawny and pale. More animals meant more eyes to spot her, more ears to hear her. More noses to sniff her out of the air. With a bow, the best she could hope for was to take one of them. She watched them moving as they followed another trail through the trees up the face of another hill on the far side of the valley. God did she want to take one. That would make all this worth it. A quick run back, going light as she could. Then untying Chester and urging him along the ridge as fast as she dared go in the opposite direction of the big horns. She swung up onto the saddle and took him down a brush-covered defile which hid loose rocks and was more treacherous than she had expected. Chester nearly stumbled once but that was the worst of it and stayed up. Then she urged him back into a trot, angling up the hill back in the direction the sheep were travelling. Slowing as she neared it but riding along the top, trying to guess how far on she should need to ride. How far the animals might have moved. She couldn't be sure if the hill had been enough of a sound break to avoid detection but she doubted she could have gotten around them successfully without being heard. Still. When she judged she had reached roughly the right spot she pulled back on the reins and dropped from the horse's back, this time not tying the animal. Crouching she hurried up the ridge, soft boots quiet in the loamy earth. Skirting around an outcrop of rock she found a cutback and though steep she ascended it efficiently and with little sound. She slowed her breathing as she reached the summit. The bow was held high, string drawn, arrow nocked. She raised up, tried to gain a vantage point to see down the slope to the valley floor. She let out a breath, stopped. Below her on a rocky outcrop. Overgrown with weeds and surrounded by shade trees was an old, abandoned cabin. She recognized it as one of the cabins used by the trapper, though it was empty this time of year. It had once been an outbuilding built to house ski lodge equipment of some kind, or at least that's what Emilie had told her anyway. There was something odd about it though. Something out of place. She could just see the front door and window beside it from here, but the door was open instead of locked and chained closed. Also, the window appeared to have had its glass broken out. And that wasn't all... --- *I want one of you (you should collectively decide who, not just first come first serve) to have your character be out here and catch up to Erin at this point in the story. * *She is out alone, past the five mile marker on a horse that isn't hers. She's breaking rules and is going to be reprimanded when she gets back.* *Most likely situation is when Erin reaches the crest of the hill she sees an approaching rider which is your character. Maybe you went out in search of her not knowing where she went after finding her and/or the horse she took missing. Maybe you saw her go and followed her. Do others know you left? Are you breaking any rules by going? You could be planning to bring her back and try to cover for her, or maybe as a disciplinary figure.* *Whoever it is that goes should establish some sort of deeper relationship with Erin in this scene.* *Please play against the Erin challenge in one post, and we will follow with the cabin after if you opt to do so. Note the cabin has not been recently explored by either Erin or your character and is a mystery to you both why the door is open and the window broken out. There is no reason for anyone to be at the shack, plus all are accounted for at the commune except Erin.* *I would like to establish this scene with a few posts before I open it up for everyone who isn't out looking for her.

The sun was on it now, reflecting brilliantly but so near the shoulder of the mountains she rode still in shadow, the sun having not risen high enough yet to reach her. She wanted to stop and take it in longer but she reminded herself she wasnt sight-seeing this time and went on. At the crest of the hill she did stop though. From higher ground it was important to be still and to survey. After a time she dismounted and hitched the horse to a tree. The horses name was Chester; a name given to it by the Bowman's. An animal they had come to own when the trapper John Brannan had decided it was not suited to hunting and passed it along to them. It had ever been wary of the smell of guns and blood and was prone to bolt at the sound of a rifle shot. Taking her bow and arrows she whispered a reassurance to Chester, gave him another rub along his neck and then a pat before she walked out along the ridgeline, eyeing the ground. She watched for animals down in the wooded valley beyond, careful how she stepped, noting the direction of the wind. The hills were criss-crossed with wide cuts between the older, more densely packed forest here. These areas were choked with weeds, low, scraggly brush and stands of thin-trunked saplings. The remains of old ski-runs someone had told her. North of here stood an old place filled with burned out buildings that had once been a great lodge; a place for winter vacations they'd said. No-one went there now. The people that had lived there were all gone now. Nell said they had come to a bad end. The people who had stayed on _after_. Isaac had taken the girls there once, a long time after but the girls had been terrified of the place. There was a sort of superstitious fear of the place even now. Seeing nothing among the trees she crouched and waited. Waited for something like five minutes. Then, at last. _Movement._ Seventy five yards away at the edge of a clearing was movement. Something grey breaking from the dark. She felt her pulse quicken the way it always did. She had the arrow nocked but drew the string now. Raised the bow. Turned her head slightly to exhale, into the breeze not letting the vapor of her breath obscure her vision. It was a bighorn sheep, a ram judging by its wide, curving horns. It had clotted clumps of matted grey and a long white beard, it's alien eyes alert as it nosed the air. Too far away. Too much cover. She would spoil the shot and the noise would scare it off. She tried to remember what Emilie had said about their horns. How much of a curve they were supposed to have to legally hunt them back before the Fall. None of that mattered now of course, but her mind went there. She had always been interested in the way things were even if she sometimes thought Emilie and the others stretched the truth or exaggerated how easy life was by comparison. Erin knew bighorns didnt travel alone and since there was no shot to take, lowered her bow. She watched. There were four more. Tawny and pale. More animals meant more eyes to spot her, more ears to hear her. More noses to sniff her out of the air. With a bow, the best she could hope for was to take one of them. She watched them moving as they followed another trail through the trees up the face of another hill on the far side of the valley. God did she want to take one. That would make all this worth it. A quick run back, going light as she could. Then untying Chester and urging him along the ridge as fast as she dared go in the opposite direction of the big horns. She swung up onto the saddle and took him down a brush-covered defile which hid loose rocks and was more treacherous than she had expected. Chester nearly stumbled once but that was the worst of it and stayed up. Then she urged him back into a trot, angling up the hill back in the direction the sheep were travelling. Slowing as she neared it but riding along the top, trying to guess how far on she should need to ride. How far the animals might have moved. She couldn't be sure if the hill had been enough of a sound break to avoid detection but she doubted she could have gotten around them successfully without being heard. Still. When she judged she had reached roughly the right spot she pulled back on the reins and dropped from the horse's back, this time not tying the animal. Crouching she hurried up the ridge, soft boots quiet in the loamy earth. Skirting around an outcrop of rock she found a cutback and though steep she ascended it efficiently and with little sound. She slowed her breathing as she reached the summit. The bow was held high, string drawn, arrow nocked. She raised up, tried to gain a vantage point to see down the slope to the valley floor. She let out a breath, stopped. Below her on a rocky outcrop. Overgrown with weeds and surrounded by shade trees was an old, abandoned cabin. She recognized it as one of the cabins used by the trapper, though it was empty this time of year. It had once been an outbuilding built to house ski lodge equipment of some kind, or at least that's what Emilie had told her anyway. There was something odd about it though. Something out of place. She could just see the front door and window beside it from here, but the door was open instead of locked and chained closed. Also, the window appeared to have had its glass broken out. And that wasn't all... --- *I want one of you (you should collectively decide who, not just first come first serve) to have your character be out here and catch up to Erin at this point in the story. * *She is out alone, past the five mile marker on a horse that isn't hers.

        "story": "Huddled in a damp and filthy jacket the lone girl rode slowly in the pre-dawn half light. There was a crispness in the fall air, clean and clear and the cold making each breath a cloud of vapor. Her ratty hood was down despite the warmth it would have provided her against the morning chill and her auburn hair was tied back in a ponytail. The chestnut quarter horse moved at an easy pace under her, following the rutted game trail, careful to pick up its hooves and place them so as to avoid the jutting roots and deadfall beneath the carpet of gold and ochre, red and yellow leaves. Erin sat deep in the saddle but hunched a bit, bow over her shoulder, arrows bundled into a sort of crude quiver made from a leather tool pouch strapped to her leg. Her eyes scanned the shadows along the crest of a low hill where they seemed to gather near the base of the white barked trees. She let her gaze linger on the darkness, confirming its vacancy. Pools of still water riffled black among the brush in the low places. Thin black branches protruded from the water. The edge of the pools fringed with reeds. The tall golden grasses made a hypnotizing sound like a whisper against the horses legs as she ascended the slope and she found her eyes getting heavy. Near the top she let out a short, sharp ho, more grunt than word and shifted her weight in the saddle. Gently she pulled back on the reins though the horse was already stopping. Red dot painted on the trunk of a tree. Nail in the center. A simple, easy to miss marker. Facing opposite the way strangers would come. She sat in the saddle eyeing it. Sniffed. Looked round. All was silent and still. Point of no return, hey Chess. Erin said to the horse and it twitched its ears and knickered as if in response. She rubbed its neck, let her bare hand rest against it a moment. This was the five mile marker. Five miles from home. She wasnt supposed to go past this point. It was forbidden. She wasnt supposed to leave the commune without someone with her either. Was never supposed to go out before dawn or after dusk. None of them were. She patted the horse's neck again. Nudged forward. The horse seemed at first hesitant to resume its earlier pace and instead went on more leisurely. Come on. she urged softly. Another nudge. He picked up the pace. Down the shaded side into the cold, the grasses here damp and high enough to wet her boots. Then up a steep dirt track past the edge of a field of tumbled down and moss-covered rocks.

One night, as the youngest crawls toward the stream, you feel the stillness of the air shift—something is coming, and it demands an answer.",
        "story": "He has his hands on Nii’s throat, and this time I do not stop them. They’re fighting over the last sugarcane, and Nii has it held tightly between his teeth, the juice from the cane dripping down his shorts. I am more concerned about how many more days he’ll be wearing the shorts unwashed, with its stain, than Ayikwe choking him to death. As if trapped inside a curse, my brothers and I have, since Mother’s passing, tasted famine in seasons of abundance. They call it a taboo—that a woman will go into labor and lose her life, especially when the child survives. “How is it possible that the same channel of life can know death?” they’ll say to one another. “The baby must have sucked out her last breath.” Sometimes they’ll curse and plead their favor, “Chai! Between my dead body and a cursed child, may God choose me.” And hence the banishment of my family.\nThey did not come chasing us out of our home with machetes, as I’ve been told of the past. But the signs were evident that they wanted us gone. At my kiosk in the market central, a scarecrow had been planted, its ripped white shirt besmirched with rotten tomatoes. The boys wondered why none of their friends would play with them. Once a boy in the neighborhood said Ayikwe was just a sacrificed clot of blood, and Ayikwe responded by digging his tiny fist into the boy’s cheek. A nightmare also kept repeating itself: that while we slept, townspeople gathered around our hut and, circling us in silence, lit a match. They set us on fire and lifted up their hands in thanksgiving. There was never smoke, just our cries filling the air. I couldn’t let that happen, and so in the first week of August, we folded everything we owned, which wasn’t much, into two sacks, and with a six-month-old baby strapped to my back, we made our way through the farms and into the outskirts of the village.\nNii is six and Ayikwe just turned eleven. For his birthday I read him Mother’s favorite prayer, which we all know by heart, days spent kneeling on a mat speaking the words slowly, rehearsed and without meaning. He insists I read it, saying, “You sound just like Ma. It is comfort.”\n“Comforting,” I say and begin to read from the back of an envelope that contains Bible verses and written prayers to God:\nLord, make me an instrument of your peace:\nwhere there is hatred, let me sow love;\nwhere there is injury, pardon;\nwhere there is doubt, faith;\nwhere there is despair, hope;\nwhere there is darkness, light;\nwhere there is sadness, joy.\nO divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek\nto be consoled as to console,\nto be understood as to understand,\nto be loved as to love.\nFor it is in giving that we receive,\nit is in pardoning that we are pardoned,\nand it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen.\n“But I don’t want to die,” Nii says, and I smile at him, the baby’s head resting easy on my chest. We named him Joseph. Actually, Ayikwe did, after his favorite Bible character. I didn’t object. At the time, I was spending days and nights in the clinic, signing papers I didn’t understand and wishing everything to be over. It was a relief to come back home with a baby who already had a name picked out and a coat of many colors, a faded Ankara cloth my mother owned. Sometimes I wonder if Joseph will be the beam of light, the one who rises above the storm and saves us from drowning. At the back of my mind, although I resist thinking such things, I toy with the idea of selling him, although I’m sure no one will pay for a womb’s curse. I know I’ll be sorry for harboring such thoughts. Nothing would be the same without him, but, frankly, selling him would be the best thing to happen to the boys and me. We could return home, just the three of us. I could have my kiosk in the market again and Ayikwe could grow maize on the farm. We could eat and laugh and be accepted.\nYou would think that by fifteen, life had dealt me enough, given me my share of its troubles—leaving school to trade in the market with my mother and coming home to cook for a family, which reduced my life to servitude. And now to be responsible for my brothers’ lives when I can barely carry my own is something I never wanted.\nWe’ve been in the woods twelve days. A meandering stream froths beside us. The boys have dug out groundnut and found a dead fish or two they could make nothing of. I’ve eaten very little. For Joseph, I pick green leaves and grind them between my palms and force it down his mouth. He spits most of it out. I can hear the boys splashing their legs in the stream, and I allow myself to weep for the first time since everything. It’s a private mourning; I grieve the loss of my mother, the cruel townspeople, and my tired heart. When the day winds down, clouds stretch above us, expanding like an inflated body.

I know when he lets himself into the cold water because he begins to cry, loudly, wailing.

        "story": "He has his hands on Nii’s throat, and this time I do not stop them. They’re fighting over the last sugarcane, and Nii has it held tightly between his teeth, the juice from the cane dripping down his shorts. I am more concerned about how many more days he’ll be wearing the shorts unwashed, with its stain, than Ayikwe choking him to death. As if trapped inside a curse, my brothers and I have, since Mother’s passing, tasted famine in seasons of abundance. They call it a taboo—that a woman will go into labor and lose her life, especially when the child survives. “How is it possible that the same channel of life can know death?” they’ll say to one another. “The baby must have sucked out her last breath.” Sometimes they’ll curse and plead their favor, “Chai! Between my dead body and a cursed child, may God choose me.” And hence the banishment of my family.\nThey did not come chasing us out of our home with machetes, as I’ve been told of the past. But the signs were evident that they wanted us gone. At my kiosk in the market central, a scarecrow had been planted, its ripped white shirt besmirched with rotten tomatoes. The boys wondered why none of their friends would play with them. Once a boy in the neighborhood said Ayikwe was just a sacrificed clot of blood, and Ayikwe responded by digging his tiny fist into the boy’s cheek. A nightmare also kept repeating itself: that while we slept, townspeople gathered around our hut and, circling us in silence, lit a match. They set us on fire and lifted up their hands in thanksgiving. There was never smoke, just our cries filling the air. I couldn’t let that happen, and so in the first week of August, we folded everything we owned, which wasn’t much, into two sacks, and with a six-month-old baby strapped to my back, we made our way through the farms and into the outskirts of the village.\nNii is six and Ayikwe just turned eleven. For his birthday I read him Mother’s favorite prayer, which we all know by heart, days spent kneeling on a mat speaking the words slowly, rehearsed and without meaning. He insists I read it, saying, “You sound just like Ma. It is comfort.”\n“Comforting,” I say and begin to read from the back of an envelope that contains Bible verses and written prayers to God:\nLord, make me an instrument of your peace:\nwhere there is hatred, let me sow love;\nwhere there is injury, pardon;\nwhere there is doubt, faith;\nwhere there is despair, hope;\nwhere there is darkness, light;\nwhere there is sadness, joy.\nO divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek\nto be consoled as to console,\nto be understood as to understand,\nto be loved as to love.\nFor it is in giving that we receive,\nit is in pardoning that we are pardoned,\nand it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen.\n“But I don’t want to die,” Nii says, and I smile at him, the baby’s head resting easy on my chest. We named him Joseph. Actually, Ayikwe did, after his favorite Bible character. I didn’t object. At the time, I was spending days and nights in the clinic, signing papers I didn’t understand and wishing everything to be over. It was a relief to come back home with a baby who already had a name picked out and a coat of many colors, a faded Ankara cloth my mother owned. Sometimes I wonder if Joseph will be the beam of light, the one who rises above the storm and saves us from drowning. At the back of my mind, although I resist thinking such things, I toy with the idea of selling him, although I’m sure no one will pay for a womb’s curse. I know I’ll be sorry for harboring such thoughts. Nothing would be the same without him, but, frankly, selling him would be the best thing to happen to the boys and me. We could return home, just the three of us. I could have my kiosk in the market again and Ayikwe could grow maize on the farm. We could eat and laugh and be accepted.\nYou would think that by fifteen, life had dealt me enough, given me my share of its troubles—leaving school to trade in the market with my mother and coming home to cook for a family, which reduced my life to servitude. And now to be responsible for my brothers’ lives when I can barely carry my own is something I never wanted.\nWe’ve been in the woods twelve days. A meandering stream froths beside us. The boys have dug out groundnut and found a dead fish or two they could make nothing of. I’ve eaten very little. For Joseph, I pick green leaves and grind them between my palms and force it down his mouth. He spits most of it out. I can hear the boys splashing their legs in the stream, and I allow myself to weep for the first time since everything.

        "story": "Winter, and I walked the sidewalk at night along banks of hard snow. I’d just come from Rab’s apartment off the reservation. Rab—this white guy with a wide mouth and eyes that closed up when he laughed—sold pot. He was smart too—I had asked for a gram, and after he weighed it and put it in a plastic baggie, he didn’t believe me when I reached into my pants and jacket pockets looking for the cash among the cigarette wrappers and pocketknife, and when I acted the part and kept saying, “Shit shit shit, it must’ve fell out on the walk over here,” he shook his head, took the weed out of the baggie, and put it back into his Mason jar. “I ain’t smokin’ you up,” he said, and so then I said, “Fuck you, Rab, I really did lose the money, you’ll see, watch when I come back here in thirty minutes with the money I dropped, you’ll feel stupid then.” He shrugged a Sorry, man, and I slammed his door shut as I left.\nAt the bridge to the reservation, the river was still frozen, ice shining white-blue under a full moon. The sidewalk on the bridge hadn’t been shoveled since the last nor’easter crapped snow in November, and I walked in the boot prints everyone made who walked the walk to Overtown to get pot or catch the bus to wherever it was us Indians had to go, which really wasn’t anywhere because everything we needed—except pot—was on the rez. Well, except the grocery store or Best Buy or Bed Bath & Beyond, but those natives who bought 4K Ultra DVDs or fresh white doilies had cars, wouldn’t be taking the bus like me or Fellis did each day to the methadone clinic. That was another thing the rez didn’t have: a methadone clinic. But we had sacred grounds where sweats and peyote ceremonies happened once a month, except since I had chosen to take methadone, I was ineligible to participate in native spiritual practice, according to the doc on the rez.\nNatives damning natives.\nThe roads on the rez were quiet, trees bending under the weight of snow, and when I passed the frozen swamp a voice moaned out. I stopped walking. Nothing, so I kept on going on the sparkly road until I heard it again.\n“Who’s that?” I yelled. The moan came again. It was a man, somewhere in the swamp. I got closer, listening. There it was: low and breathy, and I followed after the noise.\nThe swamp was frozen solid, the snow blown in piles, and so I slid over the ice, looking for the source of the noise. Moonlight through bare tree limbs lit the swamp, and caught there among the tree stumps and solid snow was a person sprawled out on the ground. He was trying to sit up but kept falling back, like he’d just done one thousand crunches and was too sore to do just one more.\nI got close, stood over him. It was Fellis.\n“Fellis,” I said. “Is that you?”\nFellis tried to sit up, but something pulled him back down. “Fuck you,” he said. “Help me.” He groaned, shivered.\nHe didn’t say how to help him, so I had to squat down and look at him. I flicked my lighter and his purple lip quivered.\n“Hurry,” he said.\n“Fellis,” I said. I stood up. “I can’t help you if I don’t know what’s a matter with you.”\n“My hair,” he said.\nI crouched back down and looked at his hair. “Holy,” I said, and I laughed. He kept his hair braided all the time, but it was undone, his long black hair frozen into the snow.\n“Get me out, Dee,” he said. “Dee, get me out.”\nAt first I tried to pull the hair out from the snow, tried to chip the snow away, but his hair wouldn’t come loose. And then I yanked real hard, and Fellis screamed.\n“Lift your head up,” I said. I opened my pocketknife, grabbed his hair in a fistful, and cut. When I got through the last bit of hair, Fellis rolled over and away from where he’d been stuck. He rubbed his head like he just woke up.\nI helped him stand, and we slipped all over the ice on our way out of the swamp. Through dry heaves, Fellis said he missed the bus this morning to the methadone clinic—“No shit,” I said, because I didn’t see him there—and he thought some booze would be good before he got sick from not having any methadone. He had just a bit of booze left when he decided to go see Rab to get some pot, and on the way he stopped off in the swamp to feel the quiet that came with too much drinking, and when he plopped down in the snow he dozed right off. When he woke up, his hair was frozen in the snow.\nI got him to his mom’s, where he lived. He walked fine by himself to the door, but I walked with him up the steps.\n“I never thought I’d scalp a fellow tribal member,” I said.\n“Fuck off,” he said. He fumbled in his pocket for his house key.\n“You wanna smoke?” I said.\n“Didn’t you listen? I didn’t make it to Rab’s.” He unlocked the door.\n“I’ll go for you,” I said. “Give me the cash.”\nFellis looked at me.\n“Twenty minutes,” I said. “I’ll run there and back while you warm up your pretty bald head.”\nHe gave me thirty bucks, and I didn’t ask where he got it from. Yesterday he said he didn’t have any money.\n“Twenty bag,” Fellis said. “And stop at Jim’s and get some tall boys and a bag of chips. Any kind but Humpty Dumpty chips. Too damn salty, and my stomach hurts.”\nDown Fellis’s driveway I thought about the look on Rab’s face when he saw I had the money. What I tell you? How about that gram?\n“Dee!” Fellis yelled. “Bring me my hair, so we can burn it! Don’t want spirits after us.”\n“We’re damned anyway,” I said. “But I guess I’ll get your hair.”\nI kept going, wondering, Hair or pot first? Pot made the most sense. It would look strange having to set the hair and ice down like a soaked mop on the counter at Jim’s while I reached in my pocket for Fellis’s money. Jim—that old wood booger—would say, “We don’t take those anymore.” I’d look him square in his sagging face and say,“I ain’t trading no hair, you old fucker,” and I’d smack down on the counter a ten-dollar bill for the tall boys and chips. With the change jingling in my pocket, I’d walk to Rab’s and he’d say, “Get that hair out of here, it’s dripping on my floor,”and I’d have to plop the hair on the muddy white floor in the hallway while Rab reweighed the same nugs he weighed earlier for me.\nNo—I’d grab Fellis’s hair from the swamp on my way home. With Fellis on his unmade bed, me on a torn beanbag in the corner, each of us with a tall boy and the pot smoke hazing gray the room, we’d keep poking and squeezing the hair, waiting for it to dry, waiting to burn it.",

        "story": "Winter, and I walked the sidewalk at night along banks of hard snow. I’d just come from Rab’s apartment off the reservation. Rab—this white guy with a wide mouth and eyes that closed up when he laughed—sold pot. He was smart too—I had asked for a gram, and after he weighed it and put it in a plastic baggie, he didn’t believe me when I reached into my pants and jacket pockets looking for the cash among the cigarette wrappers and pocketknife, and when I acted the part and kept saying, “Shit shit shit, it must’ve fell out on the walk over here,” he shook his head, took the weed out of the baggie, and put it back into his Mason jar. “I ain’t smokin’ you up,” he said, and so then I said, “Fuck you, Rab, I really did lose the money, you’ll see, watch when I come back here in thirty minutes with the money I dropped, you’ll feel stupid then.” He shrugged a Sorry, man, and I slammed his door shut as I left.\nAt the bridge to the reservation, the river was still frozen, ice shining white-blue under a full moon. The sidewalk on the bridge hadn’t been shoveled since the last nor’easter crapped snow in November, and I walked in the boot prints everyone made who walked the walk to Overtown to get pot or catch the bus to wherever it was us Indians had to go, which really wasn’t anywhere because everything we needed—except pot—was on the rez. Well, except the grocery store or Best Buy or Bed Bath & Beyond, but those natives who bought 4K Ultra DVDs or fresh white doilies had cars, wouldn’t be taking the bus like me or Fellis did each day to the methadone clinic. That was another thing the rez didn’t have: a methadone clinic. But we had sacred grounds where sweats and peyote ceremonies happened once a month, except since I had chosen to take methadone, I was ineligible to participate in native spiritual practice, according to the doc on the rez.\nNatives damning natives.\nThe roads on the rez were quiet, trees bending under the weight of snow, and when I passed the frozen swamp a voice moaned out. I stopped walking. Nothing, so I kept on going on the sparkly road until I heard it again.\n“Who’s that?” I yelled. The moan came again. It was a man, somewhere in the swamp. I got closer, listening. There it was: low and breathy, and I followed after the noise.\nThe swamp was frozen solid, the snow blown in piles, and so I slid over the ice, looking for the source of the noise. Moonlight through bare tree limbs lit the swamp, and caught there among the tree stumps and solid snow was a person sprawled out on the ground. He was trying to sit up but kept falling back, like he’d just done one thousand crunches and was too sore to do just one more.\nI got close, stood over him. It was Fellis.\n“Fellis,” I said. “Is that you?”\nFellis tried to sit up, but something pulled him back down. “Fuck you,” he said. “Help me.” He groaned, shivered.\nHe didn’t say how to help him, so I had to squat down and look at him. I flicked my lighter and his purple lip quivered.\n“Hurry,” he said.\n“Fellis,” I said. I stood up. “I can’t help you if I don’t know what’s a matter with you.”\n“My hair,” he said.\nI crouched back down and looked at his hair. “Holy,” I said, and I laughed. He kept his hair braided all the time, but it was undone, his long black hair frozen into the snow.\n“Get me out, Dee,” he said. “Dee, get me out.”\nAt first I tried to pull the hair out from the snow, tried to chip the snow away, but his hair wouldn’t come loose. And then I yanked real hard, and Fellis screamed.\n“Lift your head up,” I said. I opened my pocketknife, grabbed his hair in a fistful, and cut. When I got through the last bit of hair, Fellis rolled over and away from where he’d been stuck. He rubbed his head like he just woke up.\nI helped him stand, and we slipped all over the ice on our way out of the swamp. Through dry heaves, Fellis said he missed the bus this morning to the methadone clinic—“No shit,” I said, because I didn’t see him there—and he thought some booze would be good before he got sick from not having any methadone. He had just a bit of booze left when he decided to go see Rab to get some pot, and on the way he stopped off in the swamp to feel the quiet that came with too much drinking, and when he plopped down in the snow he dozed right off. When he woke up, his hair was frozen in the snow.\nI got him to his mom’s, where he lived. He walked fine by himself to the door, but I walked with him up the steps.\n“I never thought I’d scalp a fellow tribal member,” I said.\n“Fuck off,” he said. He fumbled in his pocket for his house key.\n“You wanna smoke?” I said.\n“Didn’t you listen? I didn’t make it to Rab’s.” He unlocked the door.\n“I’ll go for you,” I said. “Give me the cash.”\nFellis looked at me.\n“Twenty minutes,” I said. “I’ll run there and back while you warm up your pretty bald head.”\nHe gave me thirty bucks, and I didn’t ask where he got it from. Yesterday he said he didn’t have any money.\n“Twenty bag,” Fellis said. “And stop at Jim’s and get some tall boys and a bag of chips. Any kind but Humpty Dumpty chips. Too damn salty, and my stomach hurts.”\nDown Fellis’s driveway I thought about the look on Rab’s face when he saw I had the money. What I tell you? How about that gram?\n“Dee!” Fellis yelled. “Bring me my hair, so we can burn it! Don’t want spirits after us.”\n“We’re damned anyway,” I said. “But I guess I’ll get your hair.”\nI kept going, wondering, Hair or pot first? Pot made the most sense. It would look strange having to set the hair and ice down like a soaked mop on the counter at Jim’s while I reached in my pocket for Fellis’s money. Jim—that old wood booger—would say, “We don’t take those anymore.” I’d look him square in his sagging face and say,“I ain’t trading no hair, you old fucker,” and I’d smack down on the counter a ten-dollar bill for the tall boys and chips. With the change jingling in my pocket, I’d walk to Rab’s and he’d say, “Get that hair out of here, it’s dripping on my floor,”and I’d have to plop the hair on the muddy white floor in the hallway while Rab reweighed the same nugs he weighed earlier for me.\nNo—I’d grab Fellis’s hair from the swamp on my way home. With Fellis on his unmade bed, me on a torn beanbag in the corner, each of us with a tall boy and the pot smoke hazing gray the room, we’d keep poking and squeezing the hair, waiting for it to dry, waiting to burn it.",

        "story": "A July evening. Years ago, in the rose garden, his hands on a woman’s dress.\nI will never forget the way they looked—hands of a pianist, hands that pressed alcohol on my scrapes like holy water—caught there in the act of betrayal. I wished the woman’s head would fall deftly from her neck to the grass. A trophy for my trouble. I stood in the rosebush behind the stone wall in Stintino, witnessing the dismemberment of my childhood. The roses were pink, not red. The color of a kitten’s nose, or cold chicken breast. The woman’s body bore through its constraints so that the silk bloomed into creases, syrupy yellow like limoncello. Despite my callow rage, I leaned closer, thorns against my fingers, stomach melting into my thighs. When my father began to inch the yellow dress upward, I turned and ran up the path to my house.\nIt had happened twice before: my witnessing. Once earlier that same summer and another time the summer before. Always in the rose garden, my father traced the waistlines of strange women. Every incident, I thought of my mother: wiping her hands on her orange skirt, smelling of cilantro, laughing at a line in one of the sizable novels she read. I thought of how my father touched my mother’s face, fingers trailing her jaw, mapping familiar territory. Something about that touch was different than with the women in the garden, though I couldn’t say what. I was too young to understand the intricacies of possession. I thought of how my mother’s mouth would fall into an injured O, how she might never again hold my chin and say, “You look so like your father,” and I could not tell her about the garden. I worried that, like the window-flying white birds I sometimes found lying on our balcony, the ones my mother called her little soldiers, she would die. I worried that her face, closer to a sister’s than a mother’s, would shrivel decades before my eyes. Back then I understood, probably through some fabular bedtime story, that knowledge could change appearances. I knew that the mind could disrupt the skin, sadness in symptoms. I began to look for evidence of my father’s duplicity in his body. A persistent rash or a drooping eyelid. Any small blemish would have sufficed, but he remained beautiful as ever. From his forehead to his toenails, my father was perfect.\nThat last time I saw him in the garden, I heard him following me while I ran up the path. I have a theory that men walk with heavy footsteps. They don’t care about disturbing the peace because the peace never occurred to them as important. Women, in my theory, walk with a tender footfall, toes kissing the ground. This generalization is based entirely on my parents. As I got older, I made an effort to think of my mother whenever my feet touched the earth. My tread grew light as a forest fox, out of respect for my mother and a conspiratorial urge to sneak up on my father. I fancied myself the secret police of my mother’s regime. That summer night, I fled the scene barefoot, carrying my shoes, one in each hand. My father grabbed me by the collar at the base of an Aleppo pine and looked into my eyes, pointing a finger in my face.\n“You will not say anything to her. You don’t know what you saw.”\nI nodded. I didn’t tell him that I had already caught him twice before, that on my own I had decided not to tell my mother, that I hoped his black hair would turn to wire and fall out. He made me put on my shoes. We walked home together. At the threshold of our house, he withdrew a single pink flower and presented it to my mother with a bow. She smelled it, smiled, and put it in an azure glass on the window sill. In the middle of the night, I left bed to throw the rose out the window and then close the window tight.

When my father packed his bags a year later to live in another country with Yellow Dress, never to be seen by us again, my mother took me by the chin.\n“We haven’t lost a thing,” she said.\nLast week, fifteen years after my father’s departure, I received news that he had been found dead in the bathroom of a chalet in the alps.

        "story": "A deer came right through the windshield, her father says, and taps the stretch of glass in front of him. Came right through, and knocked the guy into the backseat.\nThe deer was dead on impact? she asks.\nCome on, he chuckles, pushing the car lighter in. What saved the guy was not wearing a seat belt. First thing, the car ran up onto the train tracks.\nOf course a train was coming.\nSomebody going the other way stopped and dragged him off just in time. If he’d had that seat belt on, he would have been pinned inside.\nHis seat belt swings limply against the car wall, where it has been sprung from its buzzer. I rest my case, she says. I’ll watch for deer instead.\nHe laughs and lights his cigar.\nWhat do they call those small white birds that sit on the backs of the cows? she asks.\nIbis, he says, between puffs. Just like in Africa.\nShe pulls idly at the dangling seat belt. I knew that, she says.\nHe drives past a windmill, the single perpendicular in any direction, its blades chopping the air in blurred circles. From inside the car, no other sign of wind is evident across the empty prairie except for the car’s shuddering on the county correction curves. Look at those pretty polka-dot horses, he says, by way of staying awake.\nThat’s what they call pinto, right? she says.\nAppaloosa. Pinto’s for the beans. I grow beans. Those are pinto beans.\nHe sticks her free arm toward the scraggly rows that fight the brush. Some days I like growing beans better than judging. Judging gives me a stomachache.\nIn Africa, she says, all the cases come to you—or else you get borne on a litter to the next one.\nWhat a good idea—the weight of justice on the plaintiff’s neck. He knocks ash off his cigar. That sure would shorten up a case or two.\nA small town reveals itself a mile off, signaled by a long stretch of fence posts covered, each one, by a cowboy boot. He slows when they come to the town’s single intersection, turns down its one street, and parks in front of an old schoolhouse marked café.\nThis is what education’s come to, he says. Or else they turn the schools into junk stores full of antiques—this one’s antique food.\nWhen they enter, the prosecuting attorney lifts his coffee spoon toward them from the first booth. You’re late, he says, with a smile that looks easy.\nIf I’m early, I have to pay the check, he says. My daughter, the one out of Africa.\nWelcome back, says the attorney, shaking hands. Not much of a tan.\nIt’s been ten years, she says.\nA person gets marked, says her father. She’s a marked woman.\nDad, she says. That’s right out of the movies.\nA masculine blonde swings out two plastic-coated menus by way of a signal and herds them into the booth. The three of them turn their faces up to her as she pulls a green guest check out of her waistband. Nothing special today, she says.\nThey order, and the waitress writes nothing down.\nThe attorney sighs into his coffee cup. Did you know, my dear, that right here is the richest town per capita outside of Saudi Arabia. I mean it—with the cattle market the way it is. And they can’t even put together a decent lunch. Probably just like in Africa.\nIt wasn’t hard to order lunch in Africa, she says. You ate what there was.\nThe attorney looks at her father. She sure is one of yours.\nShe’s not around much anymore. I blame that on her trip. He smiles and pulls napkins out of the container. So who’s done what to whom this week? What happened to the harassment?\nOut of court. They moved in with each other.\nAh, crime, her father says, rubbing his hands across the napkins. She files a complaint every time she’s in season.\nAs regular as a bear, says the attorney. Pardon me, he says to her.\nWe’re out of vegetables, interrupts the waitress, unloading her forearm of plates. How about crackers as a substitute? She offers sealed Saltines.\nWith pickle relish? says her father. That’ll qualify.\nShe leaves six packets of crackers, and they eat slabs of meat and mounds of starch, and the attorney picks his teeth. I heard about you, he says. You worried your father.\nNot Dad, the guy who won’t wear a seat belt.\nSeat belts? That’s just another thing those car people make you pay for. You know his problem? The attorney points his toothpick at her father’s forehead. He’s got imagination. He’s a soft-hearted bastard who gets bad dreams. Am I right, or what?\nHer father pats the ketchup off his face. I’m just a farmer with opinions. That’s why they elected me.\nRight. The attorney leans forward. Just one of the best lawyers in this part of the country. When are you going to stick this judging business and get back to some real law?\nThat’s laying it on a little thick. Her father waves at the waitress and points at his cup.\nThe coffee’s actually good, says the attorney.\nThe waitress pours three lukewarm cups, then, with great flourish, signs her name to the bottom of the check and places it onto the table.\nThe attorney picks it up.\nWhat? Paying for poison? Her father laughs. That’s what I call influencing the judge. He slaps him on the shoulder and takes the check away.\nThey file out of the café onto the half-buried cracked sidewalk and blink into the sun. So that was fine. Her father moves his belt a notch and retucks his shirt. See you next week.\nOh, there’s just one little thing. The attorney finds a document he’s stuck in the folds of his newspaper. They’re in jail now if you want to have a talk with them.\nHer father glances at the paper, and then again, rubbing his eyes behind his glasses. A dog case? You need an autopsy for a dog case?\nHey, says the attorney. It could’ve died in Kellen County and turned out to be somebody else’s problem entirely.\nWith the attorney following them, they drive the three blocks to the county jail. How’s your digestion? she asks.\nGuilty, he says. He turns the car onto the upgrade next to the sheriff’s car. Three young men loiter under a tree in front.\nJust look at the silver on that one, she says. It’s a wonder they can stand upright.\nRodeo awards, says her father. They make the buckles bigger every year.\nThey’re friends of the accused, says the attorney, coming around to the jail door. There’s a cow meet this afternoon, and we’ve got the best wranglers inside.\nYou do have a little something, says her father.\nOh, boy, says the attorney, holding the door open for them.\nThe sheriff is asleep at his desk as if he’s being paid to do it. They don’t bother him, they walk through a door marked Open where a bare lightbulb dangles overhead and two chairs meet a table. Just look at this, says the attorney.\nA county section map is tacked to the wall behind him. Pinned to it is a cutout of a collie. Red string radiates from its belly fur in a crazy crisscross. Here’s the gas station, he says, pointing to a green-headed pin. And here’s where we found the body. He presses a black-headed pin a foot away.\nYou just don’t have enough to fuss around with here, do you? says her father.\nWell, says the attorney, yes.\nThat sure is a long way for a tail to keep burning, her father says, tracing the string.\nThey put the nozzle into her and gassed her up. The attorney fiddles with a chair back. Somebody had a match. After she caught, she tried to bite her rear end. The way they do.\nI get it. Her father ducks his head as if avoiding the cruelty. You don’t have to stick around here if you don’t want to, he says to her.\nShe shakes her head.\nHe turns back to the attorney. So, who do you want me to talk to?\nActually, the parents. They just want to leave some money and have the whole thing dismissed. They can pay, believe me.\nThat’s letting them off pretty easy, says her father, taking a Tums. The punishment should fit the crime I think. Like they do in Africa.\nI don’t know, she says. An eye for an eye?\nPunishment? The attorney looks nervous. They’ll fight it.\nHer father looks disgusted as if the attorney himself did the job on the dog. Let them go to the Supreme Court for all I care. Big deal. First off, collect the bail. You can make that big. Then they’ll get to half-strangle calves in the rodeo and be happy. I’ll come back in a week when it cools down a little and try them.\nIf you say so, says the attorney.\nHer father looks out the window at the rodeo contestants. And remember, this isn’t settled out of court like your bear woman. This is the State versus a bunch of mean rich kids.\nThe attorney fools with his tie clip. I’ll tell them.\nThey drive to the next outpost where at least there is a Dairy Queen, and drink malts leaned up against the hot car. I’ll have each of them tied to a dog for a week, day and night, her father says. The first I hear of any abuse, they’ll really pay.\nAh, civilization, she says.\nHe’s fumbling around for a new cigar. You know, he says, my stomach feels better now that I’ve decided on a sentence. Maybe I could get used to this judging.\nIn Africa where I went, if the judge turns out to be wrong, he has to serve the sentence.\nHe raises his eyebrows like he doesn’t have to believe her. Why did I waste all that worry on you?\nYou never worry, she says, her straw making noise at the bottom of the cup.\nHe lit his cigar. Maybe. He looked at her over his puffing. But maybe I drive a little slower when I have you around.",

        "story": "A deer came right through the windshield, her father says, and taps the stretch of glass in front of him. Came right through, and knocked the guy into the backseat.\nThe deer was dead on impact? she asks.\nCome on, he chuckles, pushing the car lighter in. What saved the guy was not wearing a seat belt. First thing, the car ran up onto the train tracks.\nOf course a train was coming.\nSomebody going the other way stopped and dragged him off just in time. If he’d had that seat belt on, he would have been pinned inside.\nHis seat belt swings limply against the car wall, where it has been sprung from its buzzer. I rest my case, she says. I’ll watch for deer instead.\nHe laughs and lights his cigar.\nWhat do they call those small white birds that sit on the backs of the cows? she asks.\nIbis, he says, between puffs. Just like in Africa.\nShe pulls idly at the dangling seat belt. I knew that, she says.\nHe drives past a windmill, the single perpendicular in any direction, its blades chopping the air in blurred circles. From inside the car, no other sign of wind is evident across the empty prairie except for the car’s shuddering on the county correction curves. Look at those pretty polka-dot horses, he says, by way of staying awake.\nThat’s what they call pinto, right? she says.\nAppaloosa. Pinto’s for the beans. I grow beans. Those are pinto beans.\nHe sticks her free arm toward the scraggly rows that fight the brush. Some days I like growing beans better than judging. Judging gives me a stomachache.\nIn Africa, she says, all the cases come to you—or else you get borne on a litter to the next one.\nWhat a good idea—the weight of justice on the plaintiff’s neck. He knocks ash off his cigar. That sure would shorten up a case or two.\nA small town reveals itself a mile off, signaled by a long stretch of fence posts covered, each one, by a cowboy boot. He slows when they come to the town’s single intersection, turns down its one street, and parks in front of an old schoolhouse marked café.\nThis is what education’s come to, he says. Or else they turn the schools into junk stores full of antiques—this one’s antique food.\nWhen they enter, the prosecuting attorney lifts his coffee spoon toward them from the first booth. You’re late, he says, with a smile that looks easy.\nIf I’m early, I have to pay the check, he says. My daughter, the one out of Africa.\nWelcome back, says the attorney, shaking hands. Not much of a tan.\nIt’s been ten years, she says.\nA person gets marked, says her father. She’s a marked woman.\nDad, she says. That’s right out of the movies.\nA masculine blonde swings out two plastic-coated menus by way of a signal and herds them into the booth. The three of them turn their faces up to her as she pulls a green guest check out of her waistband. Nothing special today, she says.\nThey order, and the waitress writes nothing down.\nThe attorney sighs into his coffee cup. Did you know, my dear, that right here is the richest town per capita outside of Saudi Arabia. I mean it—with the cattle market the way it is. And they can’t even put together a decent lunch. Probably just like in Africa.\nIt wasn’t hard to order lunch in Africa, she says. You ate what there was.\nThe attorney looks at her father. She sure is one of yours.\nShe’s not around much anymore. I blame that on her trip. He smiles and pulls napkins out of the container. So who’s done what to whom this week? What happened to the harassment?\nOut of court.

When are you going to stick this judging business and get back to some real law?\nThat’s laying it on a little thick. Her father waves at the waitress and points at his cup.\nThe coffee’s actually good, says the attorney.\nThe waitress pours three lukewarm cups, then, with great flourish, signs her name to the bottom of the check and places it onto the table.\nThe attorney picks it up.\nWhat? Paying for poison? Her father laughs. That’s what I call influencing the judge. He slaps him on the shoulder and takes the check away.\nThey file out of the café onto the half-buried cracked sidewalk and blink into the sun. So that was fine. Her father moves his belt a notch and retucks his shirt. See you next week.\nOh, there’s just one little thing. The attorney finds a document he’s stuck in the folds of his newspaper. They’re in jail now if you want to have a talk with them.\nHer father glances at the paper, and then again, rubbing his eyes behind his glasses. A dog case? You need an autopsy for a dog case?\nHey, says the attorney. It could’ve died in Kellen County and turned out to be somebody else’s problem entirely.\nWith the attorney following them, they drive the three blocks to the county jail. How’s your digestion? she asks.\nGuilty, he says. He turns the car onto the upgrade next to the sheriff’s car. Three young men loiter under a tree in front.\nJust look at the silver on that one, she says. It’s a wonder they can stand upright.\nRodeo awards, says her father. They make the buckles bigger every year.\nThey’re friends of the accused, says the attorney, coming around to the jail door. There’s a cow meet this afternoon, and we’ve got the best wranglers inside.\nYou do have a little something, says her father.\nOh, boy, says the attorney, holding the door open for them.\nThe sheriff is asleep at his desk as if he’s being paid to do it. They don’t bother him, they walk through a door marked Open where a bare lightbulb dangles overhead and two chairs meet a table. Just look at this, says the attorney.\nA county section map is tacked to the wall behind him. Pinned to it is a cutout of a collie. Red string radiates from its belly fur in a crazy crisscross. Here’s the gas station, he says, pointing to a green-headed pin. And here’s where we found the body. He presses a black-headed pin a foot away.\nYou just don’t have enough to fuss around with here, do you? says her father.\nWell, says the attorney, yes.\nThat sure is a long way for a tail to keep burning, her father says, tracing the string.\nThey put the nozzle into her and gassed her up. The attorney fiddles with a chair back. Somebody had a match. After she caught, she tried to bite her rear end. The way they do.\nI get it. Her father ducks his head as if avoiding the cruelty. You don’t have to stick around here if you don’t want to, he says to her.\nShe shakes her head.\nHe turns back to the attorney. So, who do you want me to talk to?\nActually, the parents. They just want to leave some money and have the whole thing dismissed. They can pay, believe me.\nThat’s letting them off pretty easy, says her father, taking a Tums. The punishment should fit the crime I think. Like they do in Africa.\nI don’t know, she says. An eye for an eye?\nPunishment? The attorney looks nervous. They’ll fight it.\nHer father looks disgusted as if the attorney himself did the job on the dog. Let them go to the Supreme Court for all I care. Big deal. First off, collect the bail. You can make that big. Then they’ll get to half-strangle calves in the rodeo and be happy. I’ll come back in a week when it cools down a little and try them.\nIf you say so, says the attorney.\nHer father looks out the window at the rodeo contestants. And remember, this isn’t settled out of court like your bear woman. This is the State versus a bunch of mean rich kids.\nThe attorney fools with his tie clip. I’ll tell them.\nThey drive to the next outpost where at least there is a Dairy Queen, and drink malts leaned up against the hot car. I’ll have each of them tied to a dog for a week, day and night, her father says. The first I hear of any abuse, they’ll really pay.\nAh, civilization, she says.\nHe’s fumbling around for a new cigar. You know, he says, my stomach feels better now that I’ve decided on a sentence. Maybe I could get used to this judging.\nIn Africa where I went, if the judge turns out to be wrong, he has to serve the sentence.\nHe raises his eyebrows like he doesn’t have to believe her. Why did I waste all that worry on you?\nYou never worry, she says, her straw making noise at the bottom of the cup.\nHe lit his cigar. Maybe. He looked at her over his puffing. But maybe I drive a little slower when I have you around.",

        "story": "A deer came right through the windshield, her father says, and taps the stretch of glass in front of him. Came right through, and knocked the guy into the backseat.\nThe deer was dead on impact? she asks.\nCome on, he chuckles, pushing the car lighter in. What saved the guy was not wearing a seat belt. First thing, the car ran up onto the train tracks.\nOf course a train was coming.\nSomebody going the other way stopped and dragged him off just in time. If he’d had that seat belt on, he would have been pinned inside.\nHis seat belt swings limply against the car wall, where it has been sprung from its buzzer. I rest my case, she says. I’ll watch for deer instead.\nHe laughs and lights his cigar.\nWhat do they call those small white birds that sit on the backs of the cows? she asks.\nIbis, he says, between puffs. Just like in Africa.\nShe pulls idly at the dangling seat belt. I knew that, she says.\nHe drives past a windmill, the single perpendicular in any direction, its blades chopping the air in blurred circles. From inside the car, no other sign of wind is evident across the empty prairie except for the car’s shuddering on the county correction curves. Look at those pretty polka-dot horses, he says, by way of staying awake.\nThat’s what they call pinto, right? she says.\nAppaloosa. Pinto’s for the beans. I grow beans. Those are pinto beans.\nHe sticks her free arm toward the scraggly rows that fight the brush. Some days I like growing beans better than judging. Judging gives me a stomachache.\nIn Africa, she says, all the cases come to you—or else you get borne on a litter to the next one.\nWhat a good idea—the weight of justice on the plaintiff’s neck. He knocks ash off his cigar. That sure would shorten up a case or two.\nA small town reveals itself a mile off, signaled by a long stretch of fence posts covered, each one, by a cowboy boot. He slows when they come to the town’s single intersection, turns down its one street, and parks in front of an old schoolhouse marked café.\nThis is what education’s come to, he says. Or else they turn the schools into junk stores full of antiques—this one’s antique food.\nWhen they enter, the prosecuting attorney lifts his coffee spoon toward them from the first booth. You’re late, he says, with a smile that looks easy.\nIf I’m early, I have to pay the check, he says. My daughter, the one out of Africa.\nWelcome back, says the attorney, shaking hands. Not much of a tan.\nIt’s been ten years, she says.\nA person gets marked, says her father. She’s a marked woman.\nDad, she says. That’s right out of the movies.\nA masculine blonde swings out two plastic-coated menus by way of a signal and herds them into the booth. The three of them turn their faces up to her as she pulls a green guest check out of her waistband. Nothing special today, she says.\nThey order, and the waitress writes nothing down.\nThe attorney sighs into his coffee cup. Did you know, my dear, that right here is the richest town per capita outside of Saudi Arabia. I mean it—with the cattle market the way it is. And they can’t even put together a decent lunch. Probably just like in Africa.\nIt wasn’t hard to order lunch in Africa, she says. You ate what there was.\nThe attorney looks at her father. She sure is one of yours.\nShe’s not around much anymore. I blame that on her trip. He smiles and pulls napkins out of the container. So who’s done what to whom this week? What happened to the harassment?\nOut of court. They moved in with each other.\nAh, crime, her father says, rubbing his hands across the napkins. She files a complaint every time she’s in season.\nAs regular as a bear, says the attorney. Pardon me, he says to her.\nWe’re out of vegetables, interrupts the waitress, unloading her forearm of plates. How about crackers as a substitute? She offers sealed Saltines.\nWith pickle relish? says her father. That’ll qualify.\nShe leaves six packets of crackers, and they eat slabs of meat and mounds of starch, and the attorney picks his teeth. I heard about you, he says. You worried your father.\nNot Dad, the guy who won’t wear a seat belt.\nSeat belts? That’s just another thing those car people make you pay for. You know his problem? The attorney points his toothpick at her father’s forehead. He’s got imagination. He’s a soft-hearted bastard who gets bad dreams. Am I right, or what?\nHer father pats the ketchup off his face. I’m just a farmer with opinions. That’s why they elected me.\nRight. The attorney leans forward. Just one of the best lawyers in this part of the country.

        "story": "Roy read a story about a tribe of female warriors who interrupted the conﬂict between the Greeks and the Trojans in their quest for males to assist in the propagation of their race. These women called themselves Amazons and were led by Penthesilea, who, as had the rest of the tribe, severed her right breast in order to more swiftly and easily draw back her bow. The most exciting part of the story, Roy thought, was the Amazon queen’s confrontation with the champion of the Greeks, Achilles, whose ferocity in battle attracted Penthesilea as no man ever had.

He drew pictures of the Amazons as he imagined them, naked, tall, and lean, their long hair tied back with leather thongs.\nRoy asked his grandfather if he’d ever read this story.\n“Sure,” said Pops, “it’s in The Iliad, by Homer.”\n“That’s right,” Roy said. “I kind of found it by accident on a table at the library. Do you think there really ever was a tribe of savage women like that?”\n“I don’t think savage is the correct word for them, Roy. They knew what they were doing. The Amazons wanted to be independent of men, the problem being that they needed men to impregnate them in order to keep their race from dying out.”\n“But they only wanted girls, right?”\nPops nodded.\n“Then what did they do with boy babies?”\n“Killed at birth,” Pops said. “Drowned them or slit their throats.”\n“It’s just a story, though, isn’t it?” Roy asked. “Homer made it all up.”\n“Yes,” said Pops, “but there’s a lot of truth to it. Even today many Chinese drown their female babies because they think they’re worth less than men.”\n“But they need girls to keep China going.”\n“They don’t drown all of ’em.”\nAfter talking to Pops, Roy walked over to the park to see if anybody was playing ball.

Maybe I’ll go when it stops raining.”\nHe opened the refrigerator and took out a bottle of milk.\n“What’s the leader of the Amazons called?” Roy asked.\n“A virago,” said Pops.\n“Is that the same as queen?”\n“You need a king to have a queen, Roy. No, a virago is a termagant.”\n“Termagant? That sounds like an insect.”\nPops bit into his sandwich.\n“It means a big, tough woman,” he said, as he chewed.\n“I guess the Chinese don’t want any of them,” said Roy.\n“Probably not,” Pops said. “Close the refrigerator door.”",

        "story": "Between the exterior wall and the Sheetrock, a waterproofing layer was missing. The builders, in their defense, said that the layer had simply been forgotten about, not left out in an intentional move to save money. The building was faculty housing, occupied only by professors and their families. All but one professor were untenured. Half had kids under ten.\nThe layer had been found to be missing during a city inspection a decade ago. Repairs were put off for nine years. The school, as both employer and landlord, cited extreme busyness, and pointed out that, despite the missing barrier, no actual apartment floods had occurred. Year ten there was a global pandemic, but year ten was also the end of the remediation period, so construction had to start. The contractor hosted a virtual meeting to explain the many phases of the process. The slide show had several typos. “Demolition” became “demonition”; no apartment number was listed correctly. How disruptive would all this be, the dance professor asked, and the cherub-faced blond contractor’s spokesman answered politely, “Very much so, ma’am.” Then the chemistry professor chimed in about particulates. If the entire brick façade was being torn off, what was being done about air-quality control? The chemistry professor had small children. Small children had small lungs. The blond man said that they would tape over everyone’s windows. They would tape over the vents of everyone’s A.C.s. “So, no A.C.s or windows?” another professor asked. “All through summer, no opening windows or running A.C.s?” This professor, who taught biology and kept on the building’s rooftop a colony of honeybees, was not known to repeat himself. The blond man said that that was correct. And that the rooftop would be closed to accommodate the rigging, so the bee colony would have to be moved.\nTo better address the concerns of the tenants, a second virtual meeting was called, and predictably it went much worse.\nThe third virtual meeting was cancelled, and, a day later, scaffolding went up. Spaghetti-like ropes encased the building, and men in orange vests carrying hammer drills appeared on skinny platform lifts. Windows were covered with a neon-blue film that turned every room into an aquarium and gave tenants headaches. “No one’s complained about the blue film before,” the contractor said, though he then admitted to never having worked on an occupied building before. Clear film was procured four days later, the windows retaped.\nThe contractor did boast about having an on-site hygienist, a woman who was copied on e-mails but whom no one had met.\nFor three weeks, the noise level was terrible, from nine to five, Monday through Friday, with no pause. The new writing professor was trying to finish a novel but could only write things like “So this is what it must feel like to live inside a tooth that a dentist is trying to drill.” The tooth occupied her thoughts nightly. She hadn’t gone to the dentist in years. Red dust coated the window film; plumes of smoke were seen. The religion professor brought up the plumes, how, from her red-tinted window, they seemed cloudlike even. The contractor replied immediately, copying the hygienist, to clarify that what the professor saw was not a plume or anything close to a cloud but a puff of smoke being aggrandized by the wind.\nEach morning, there was an e-mail update explaining which units would be most directly affected that day, though the apartment numbers were still incorrect. So, to figure out if you were truly going to be affected, you had to watch for where the huge mechanical pulley on the roof was dropping lifts. Glancing up at the building from the outside, the ceramics professor was reminded of his childhood, and that unwinnable arcade game with a bin of plush toys and a slippery claw. He was on the corner waiting for Mister Softee. He was waiting for Mister Softee because his three boys, who were inside, had told him to text them when the truck was in sight.\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\nThe technical term for what was missing was flashing—an embedded sheet of metal that prevents moisture from penetrating a building’s walls. Flashing is particularly important at junctions, around windows, vent pipes, etc. No one thought anymore of the word’s other meanings—committing indecent exposure, for example, running buck naked across a green field in a Superman cape, as the six-year-old son of the dance professor had done during his first soccer game.\nInclement weather set in one weekend, a hurricane muscling through from the south. Rain fell for three days and nights, and the history professor, whose apartment was right below the pulley, said it sounded as if it were raining within the walls. Could there be a leak? He sent the company an audio clip. The company responded a minute later. Leaks were impossible. They had sealed all the leaks because that was what they were here to do. Below the history professor lived a math professor, who all weekend had been collecting the water that had funnelled into her office through the ceiling. She used a one-gallon bucket, and she’d emptied the bucket into the bathtub five times. The math professor was married to the East Asian Studies professor. Not that ironically, the former was Asian and the latter white. Between gallons three and four, the former had drafted an angry e-mail to the school, but then stared at her unnuanced message. She worried about being the squeaky wheel, when she and her husband had upcoming third-year reviews. Still, she asked if he could rewrite and send the e-mail, given both his nuance skills and the fact that the administration might take him more seriously. That would be taking advantage of his privilege, he thought, and shook his head, but encouraged her to send the e-mail, since she should feel empowered to and he was never going to stand in her way. A quarrel about feminism followed. No e-mail was sent.\nOver text, some tenants hatched a plan. They would implore the one tenured resident—an economics professor—to declare war by sending the e-mail and hiring a lawyer who would then launch the war by suing the school. But the economics professor was away. He’d left for Crete at the start of the construction, on a private jet owned by one of his friends.\nWithin the building, the audio clip went viral and was forwarded anonymously to the project’s architect. The architect soon replied in an e-mail about how a pulley system of that weight might have shifted the building’s foundation, creating fractures, but this problem was, unfortunately, beyond the company’s scope. They dealt only with façades. Another company did foundations.\nThe next weekend, another storm front came through. Seven gallons, the math professor counted. In the history professor’s bedroom, a paint bubble, the height and width of a man, appeared on the wall overnight. He poked the bubble, afraid that it might actually be a person, like his department chair, and was sprayed, drenched, in brown water.\nThe professors lamented in the laundry room. What kind of collective e-mail to send, and in what tone? A seven-hundred-word one was drafted, with bulleted questions for further discussion. The e-mail was edited down to three hundred words, then ballooned again to a thousand.\n“We must withhold rent,” the ethics professor said—a thought that gave the non-activist professors palpitations.\nThe walls of the water-filled units now felt spongy, and eventually a two-hundred-word e-mail was sent, signed by all the untenured professors, and ending with the sentence “We demand immediate action.” Within an hour, a fit young man arrived and handed everyone he met a business card. The card said that he was the vice-president of the company. The man noted the places where water was still seeping in. He said that there would likely be mold growth, and, should the mold be the color of soot, coal, or volcanic ash, they would need to call in the hygienist to culture it. Not all strains are toxic, he informed them. Some were perfectly O.K. In addition, he’d gone up to the roof and found no visible faults around the pulley system, so perhaps the leak was a preëxisting condition that had suddenly, coincidentally, got worse. “Things like this do happen,” he insisted, and added that, once the scaffolding was removed, the foundation would naturally rise up, against gravity, to its previous position. Then he tipped his hard hat at the professors and wished them a good day.\nSo construction went on unimpeded, and more storms came through, and more gallons were collected. Spores grew in the wet areas, none whose colors were quite right to be cultured. Rent was paid reliably; no more complaints were filed. In time, the professors all arrived at the same conclusion. Was the leak really that bad? On good days, it sounded like living next to a waterfall. Push through it, the way you did in grad school; then, once you get tenure, you can fly to Crete. ♦",

Glancing up at the building from the outside, the ceramics professor was reminded of his childhood, and that unwinnable arcade game with a bin of plush toys and a slippery claw. He was on the corner waiting for Mister Softee. He was waiting for Mister Softee because his three boys, who were inside, had told him to text them when the truck was in sight.\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\nThe technical term for what was missing was flashing—an embedded sheet of metal that prevents moisture from penetrating a building’s walls. Flashing is particularly important at junctions, around windows, vent pipes, etc. No one thought anymore of the word’s other meanings—committing indecent exposure, for example, running buck naked across a green field in a Superman cape, as the six-year-old son of the dance professor had done during his first soccer game.\nInclement weather set in one weekend, a hurricane muscling through from the south. Rain fell for three days and nights, and the history professor, whose apartment was right below the pulley, said it sounded as if it were raining within the walls. Could there be a leak? He sent the company an audio clip. The company responded a minute later. Leaks were impossible. They had sealed all the leaks because that was what they were here to do. Below the history professor lived a math professor, who all weekend had been collecting the water that had funnelled into her office through the ceiling. She used a one-gallon bucket, and she’d emptied the bucket into the bathtub five times. The math professor was married to the East Asian Studies professor. Not that ironically, the former was Asian and the latter white. Between gallons three and four, the former had drafted an angry e-mail to the school, but then stared at her unnuanced message. She worried about being the squeaky wheel, when she and her husband had upcoming third-year reviews. Still, she asked if he could rewrite and send the e-mail, given both his nuance skills and the fact that the administration might take him more seriously. That would be taking advantage of his privilege, he thought, and shook his head, but encouraged her to send the e-mail, since she should feel empowered to and he was never going to stand in her way. A quarrel about feminism followed. No e-mail was sent.\nOver text, some tenants hatched a plan. They would implore the one tenured resident—an economics professor—to declare war by sending the e-mail and hiring a lawyer who would then launch the war by suing the school. But the economics professor was away. He’d left for Crete at the start of the construction, on a private jet owned by one of his friends.\nWithin the building, the audio clip went viral and was forwarded anonymously to the project’s architect. The architect soon replied in an e-mail about how a pulley system of that weight might have shifted the building’s foundation, creating fractures, but this problem was, unfortunately, beyond the company’s scope. They dealt only with façades. Another company did foundations.\nThe next weekend, another storm front came through. Seven gallons, the math professor counted. In the history professor’s bedroom, a paint bubble, the height and width of a man, appeared on the wall overnight. He poked the bubble, afraid that it might actually be a person, like his department chair, and was sprayed, drenched, in brown water.\nThe professors lamented in the laundry room. What kind of collective e-mail to send, and in what tone? A seven-hundred-word one was drafted, with bulleted questions for further discussion. The e-mail was edited down to three hundred words, then ballooned again to a thousand.\n“We must withhold rent,” the ethics professor said—a thought that gave the non-activist professors palpitations.\nThe walls of the water-filled units now felt spongy, and eventually a two-hundred-word e-mail was sent, signed by all the untenured professors, and ending with the sentence “We demand immediate action.” Within an hour, a fit young man arrived and handed everyone he met a business card. The card said that he was the vice-president of the company. The man noted the places where water was still seeping in. He said that there would likely be mold growth, and, should the mold be the color of soot, coal, or volcanic ash, they would need to call in the hygienist to culture it. Not all strains are toxic, he informed them. Some were perfectly O.K. In addition, he’d gone up to the roof and found no visible faults around the pulley system, so perhaps the leak was a preëxisting condition that had suddenly, coincidentally, got worse. “Things like this do happen,” he insisted, and added that, once the scaffolding was removed, the foundation would naturally rise up, against gravity, to its previous position. Then he tipped his hard hat at the professors and wished them a good day.\nSo construction went on unimpeded, and more storms came through, and more gallons were collected. Spores grew in the wet areas, none whose colors were quite right to be cultured. Rent was paid reliably; no more complaints were filed. In time, the professors all arrived at the same conclusion. Was the leak really that bad? On good days, it sounded like living next to a waterfall. Push through it, the way you did in grad school; then, once you get tenure, you can fly to Crete. ♦",

        "story": "Kitty was suspicious of the escalator, or, more properly, the escalators, as there were two of them, one falling and one rising, anchored side by side in the middle of the main shopping floor. She disliked the push of the motor, and, under that, the light clacking sound of something she could not analyze. A chain perhaps, that ran loose, deep in the machine.\nThey were new. The space where they appeared had been boxed in for months, floor to ceiling, with cheap wooden panelling, painted blue. First, a hole was knocked in the floor, and then another in the ceiling above, she supposed. They worked at night, but even during the day men came out from behind the panelling, filthy and smiling, and went back in again: ordinary Dublin men who worked whenever, and installed escalators in the middle of the night. She wondered how much they were paid.\nKitty tried to take to them, but she couldn't. She was disturbed by the sight of them out among the merchandise. She disliked the way they talked to each other loudly and laughed as if they owned the shop. They interrupted the conversation, somehow. You'd be selling a bed, talking about springs, you'd be with a young couple, pushing into the mattress in a cozy sort of way, and who would stroll past but the lean blond one, maybe, with the dirty-looking tan, adjusting his zip on the way back from the loo.\nNot that she minded men. She had two grown sons at home, so she was used to it: the cheerfulness, the indifference, and the mess. Though sometimes she turned around in the kitchen and was shocked by the sheer size of them—all that protein and carbohydrate, the muscle and milk of them, as though she had fed a couple of potted plants, and grown triffids.\nThen, one morning, she walked in and the men were gone. The place was perfect; the carpets fresh and new, the hoarding dissolved into thin air, and, in the middle of the floor, a pair of escalators, one going up and the other coming down. The steps tugged lightly at each other as they passed, snagging and loosening all day long. They ticked in the corner of her eye, making her feel balanced, or dizzy, depending on the light. They were so clean. The up escalator always mounting itself, stair over stair; the down escalator falling like syrup, burying itself slowly in the flatness of the floor.\nThey were beautiful, and they never stopped, and finally they got on her nerves. Nothing happened in the Bed Department. People bought a bed, or they did not buy a bed. Kitty used to like the open space, the hummocky slabs of mattress, the headboards like tombstones in a giant graveyard. \"Who's been sleeping in my bed?\" But all her satisfaction was gone now. The way people lay down and curled up, in the middle of the crowd. The old couples sitting on either side of the mattress and looking over their shoulders at each other in a way that was almost coy; the giggles and the silences. Most people buying a bed were in love, she used to think, or hopeful at least of finding love. Now they just bounced up and down or put their dirty feet up or looked like they could kill for a decent night's sleep.\nShe was at home one evening, washing the dishes, when the phone rang. It was a young man who said he was looking for a Kevin Daly. Kitty was listed as K. Daly in the phone book, and she didn't want to give too much away. She said that there was no Kevin Daly at that number, and the young man asked if she was sure. He said that he was looking for a Kevin Daly he used to know, a man who had gone to school in Malahide. \"I'm sorry,\" Kitty said, but they were talking to each other now. He told her that Kevin Daly was his brother, long out of touch. Then he said that Kevin Daly was actually his father, but that he did not know he was his father, or he did not know that he was his son. He said that he was looking for his father because his mother was sick and that was why she had given him his father's name, finally—Kevin Daly, and the fact that he'd gone to school in Malahide. \"It was a schooltime romance,\" he said. Kitty just said \"Sorry\" a lot, the way you might say \"I see.\"\n\"Sorry,\" she said.\n\"So that's why—you know?\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nHe asked did she have a brother called Kevin Daly, or a cousin, and she just said, \"No, sorry.\" But he was quite insistent, as though she might be harboring the man. \"No really, I'm sorry,\" she said, and put down the phone.\nThe next day, Kitty expected someone to float down the escalator into the Bed Department and call her by name. She did not know who it might be. A girl, maybe, with green eyes, or a slender young boy. She imagined a man in a perfect black suit—something extra about him, anyway, like Cary Grant. A young man with curly red hair gazed at her—or through her—all the way from the floor above, and she wondered, bizarrely, if he was the person she was waiting for. Also what he might say to her, if he was.\nThen a figure did appear that made her heart turn, and it took a while before Kitty realized that it was her own mother, sailing down from Fabrics and Soft Furnishings like a queen.\nCritics at Large Live, featuring Julio Torres\n\"I didn't recognize you,\" Kitty said.\nHer mother was in town looking for a shower curtain and had thought she would pop in to say hello. But after that there was little enough to talk about. Kitty was used to seeing her at home; out in the open, she seemed surprisingly well dressed and mute.\n\"Well, you always know where to find me,\" Kitty said to her, with a stranger's smile.\nKitty ended up seducing a man from the local Drama Society, a little to his surprise. He had been courting her for months, but in an old-fashioned sort of way. He was sixty-plus, and Kitty was forty-plus; that was the kind of age gap you could expect, with two nearly grown sons. They were both in a production of \"Johnny Belinda,\" a play about a deaf-mute who gets pregnant, though it comes out right in the end. Kitty did the interval coffees and had a walk-on in the final scene; Tom, for that was the man's name, did the set. He was good with his hands, he said, as he bent over a sawhorse in the scene dock, and Kitty flicked a glance at him to see what he meant—but all he meant was that he was good at making things. Nice. In a way. He drove her home after rehearsal most nights, and one evening they stopped out to eat. After which, Kitty asked him in for a drink.\nTom. He said all he needed was a couple of hours to fit two dimmers where the old light switch was, but she'd need to redecorate, after. He looked at the photos on her mantelpiece. He was recently bereaved. His daughter had told him to join the Drama Society, so there he was. In a moment, Kitty thought, he would tell her about his teeth, that they were all his own. Faded brown eyes, silver hair, a handsome where-did-it-all-go-wrong face. They were on the sofa, safe enough. Kitty's older son lumbered in from the pub, and stayed to be introduced. Her younger one was upstairs with his own TV. They were nice boys. They did not expect their mother to seduce old geezers in the front room, and neither did the geezer. It was awkward all the way through, and quite satisfying. Kitty did not tell him about her ex-husband, as he did not talk about his dead wife. She did not tell him that her husband had strayed, that she had done everything to keep him, up to and including porn videos in the bedroom, and that, when she finally left, the judge held that desertion against her and awarded him the house. She did not tell him how her husband had moved a woman in, two weeks after walking out of court. She did not tell him how the boys had followed her eventually to her bedsit and looked after her, as only young boys can, how together they had made their way here, to the outer suburbs and a decent life. Nor did she tell him that she was pregnant, when she realized that she was pregnant. She just let him, and the Drama Society, lapse, soon after the curtain had rung down on \"Johnny Belinda,\" and before anyone could be surprised.\nAt first, she thought it was the change of life. She stood in the Bed Department and waited for hot flashes. She did not mind growing old as long as it meant growing easy, but it did not seem to be working out that way. There was an agitation, a turbulence in her blood. She rode all the way up to Accounts to query her pay slip, and she landed back down in the Bed Department with a thump. She walked the floor and sat on the beds. She had a terrible need to lie down on one of them. One Monday evening, during stocktaking, she actually did lie down. She simply reclined. She let her back sink into a double-sprung Slumberland, and felt she might never rise again.\nIt was not until she bought three pots of apricot jam that the penny dropped. She did not even bother to take a test. She felt that swooping blankness she had felt with each of the boys, so delicious, like diving into a pool and finding you can breathe. The child was no bigger than a pip in the flesh of her stomach. She took it for walks and little outings. She gave it a go on the escalators and on a park swing, scuffing the coarse sand under her feet and feeling a little mad. What would she tell the boys? As for the people in the Bed Department—Jackie, who shared the floor with her, and the customers who came in to look or buy—they all looked empty to her, like husks. As though she were the only real thing left. It was like that film with the pods, and she wanted to run away somewhere, to a deserted lighthouse, or a shack by the beach, and sit in a shaft of light while her baby grew.\nTom rang. His voice was a shock.\n\"I just thought I'd check up on you.\" He sounded close, he sounded right inside her ear. Kitty had to remind herself that there were miles of cable between them, a maze of electricity and static.\n\"I'm fine,\" she said. \"How are things?\"\n\"Good. Good.\"\nIn the pause, she felt sorry for him. He wasn't used to this kind of thing.\n\"And yourself?\" he said.\n\"Oh, flying,\" she said. \"Flying form.\" And he took the hint and let it go.\nThen, one morning, the down elevator sighed and stopped. People clumped down the steps carefully, almost aslant, squinting at the lines that were strangely solid now, though they still seemed to shift beneath their feet. Kitty was glad she wasn't on the thing when it ground to a halt. It would make you look so foolish. As it happened, the escalators were empty, apart from a young woman on the other side, who seemed to surge suddenly up. Whoosh.\nKitty knew it didn't mean anything, but she feared for her baby, which was now just eleven weeks old. She could not bear the lopsided sight of the stalled steps; they were like someone endlessly limping at the other end of the shop floor. She took a very long lunch, and when she came back a man had taken the panel off the bottom of the broken side. She was right about the chain—there it was, looping around the steps that were wedges, actually, when you looked at them side-on. They packed around the central pivot like big slices of metal pie, then separated out on the way up, dangling their triangular bases into space.\nThe escalator man glanced at her as she stared into the works, and then went back to his phase tester, tipping the metal gently here and there. He had hair on the backs of his hands, fine and light: one of those furry men with cushioned muscles and uncertain eyes. Kitty stood for a long time, making him uneasy. He glanced over his shoulder again, but he did not really see her—which was fine.\nKitty lost the baby at thirteen weeks, or lost something, at any rate. She looked at the blood on the wad of toilet paper and wondered if she was in the change of life, after all. Perhaps she had imagined the baby, perhaps it had never been there in the first place. She called in sick and went to bed and could not cry.\nAt the weekend, she drove her younger son to his soccer game in the Fifteen Acres. She had to park a distance away, because he was embarrassed by the car. Also, he did not like having his mother on the sidelines anymore, so Kitty, amused, went for a walk instead. She thought she might look for the deer. And, almost as she thought it, there they were, a herd of does and their fawns, standing or lying, and all of them chewing, watching, as she now watched, a pair of children and their toy plane buzzing at the other end of the glen.\nShe felt sure now that it had been a baby—that she had not been fooled. Her stomach was still warm and aching from it. The deer chewed on and did not mind her, while the toy plane buzzed and sputtered and fell to the ground.\nThe change of life.\nHer life was changing, that was for sure, though she seemed to be standing still. But up or down? she wondered. Up or down? The children threw the plane back into the air, and it circled again on the end of its wire. Kitty walked on. It had been a baby, she knew it. She had been visited. How could it be down, when she felt such joy. ♦",

        "story": "Kitty was suspicious of the escalator, or, more properly, the escalators, as there were two of them, one falling and one rising, anchored side by side in the middle of the main shopping floor. She disliked the push of the motor, and, under that, the light clacking sound of something she could not analyze. A chain perhaps, that ran loose, deep in the machine.\nThey were new. The space where they appeared had been boxed in for months, floor to ceiling, with cheap wooden panelling, painted blue. First, a hole was knocked in the floor, and then another in the ceiling above, she supposed. They worked at night, but even during the day men came out from behind the panelling, filthy and smiling, and went back in again: ordinary Dublin men who worked whenever, and installed escalators in the middle of the night. She wondered how much they were paid.\nKitty tried to take to them, but she couldn't. She was disturbed by the sight of them out among the merchandise. She disliked the way they talked to each other loudly and laughed as if they owned the shop. They interrupted the conversation, somehow. You'd be selling a bed, talking about springs, you'd be with a young couple, pushing into the mattress in a cozy sort of way, and who would stroll past but the lean blond one, maybe, with the dirty-looking tan, adjusting his zip on the way back from the loo.\nNot that she minded men. She had two grown sons at home, so she was used to it: the cheerfulness, the indifference, and the mess. Though sometimes she turned around in the kitchen and was shocked by the sheer size of them—all that protein and carbohydrate, the muscle and milk of them, as though she had fed a couple of potted plants, and grown triffids.\nThen, one morning, she walked in and the men were gone. The place was perfect; the carpets fresh and new, the hoarding dissolved into thin air, and, in the middle of the floor, a pair of escalators, one going up and the other coming down. The steps tugged lightly at each other as they passed, snagging and loosening all day long. They ticked in the corner of her eye, making her feel balanced, or dizzy, depending on the light. They were so clean. The up escalator always mounting itself, stair over stair; the down escalator falling like syrup, burying itself slowly in the flatness of the floor.\nThey were beautiful, and they never stopped, and finally they got on her nerves. Nothing happened in the Bed Department. People bought a bed, or they did not buy a bed. Kitty used to like the open space, the hummocky slabs of mattress, the headboards like tombstones in a giant graveyard. \"Who's been sleeping in my bed?\" But all her satisfaction was gone now. The way people lay down and curled up, in the middle of the crowd. The old couples sitting on either side of the mattress and looking over their shoulders at each other in a way that was almost coy; the giggles and the silences. Most people buying a bed were in love, she used to think, or hopeful at least of finding love. Now they just bounced up and down or put their dirty feet up or looked like they could kill for a decent night's sleep.\nShe was at home one evening, washing the dishes, when the phone rang. It was a young man who said he was looking for a Kevin Daly. Kitty was listed as K. Daly in the phone book, and she didn't want to give too much away. She said that there was no Kevin Daly at that number, and the young man asked if she was sure. He said that he was looking for a Kevin Daly he used to know, a man who had gone to school in Malahide. \"I'm sorry,\" Kitty said, but they were talking to each other now. He told her that Kevin Daly was his brother, long out of touch. Then he said that Kevin Daly was actually his father, but that he did not know he was his father, or he did not know that he was his son. He said that he was looking for his father because his mother was sick and that was why she had given him his father's name, finally—Kevin Daly, and the fact that he'd gone to school in Malahide. \"It was a schooltime romance,\" he said. Kitty just said \"Sorry\" a lot, the way you might say \"I see.\"\n\"Sorry,\" she said.\n\"So that's why—you know?\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nHe asked did she have a brother called Kevin Daly, or a cousin, and she just said, \"No, sorry.\" But he was quite insistent, as though she might be harboring the man. \"No really, I'm sorry,\" she said, and put down the phone.\nThe next day, Kitty expected someone to float down the escalator into the Bed Department and call her by name. She did not know who it might be. A girl, maybe, with green eyes, or a slender young boy. She imagined a man in a perfect black suit—something extra about him, anyway, like Cary Grant. A young man with curly red hair gazed at her—or through her—all the way from the floor above, and she wondered, bizarrely, if he was the person she was waiting for. Also what he might say to her, if he was.\nThen a figure did appear that made her heart turn, and it took a while before Kitty realized that it was her own mother, sailing down from Fabrics and Soft Furnishings like a queen.\nCritics at Large Live, featuring Julio Torres\n\"I didn't recognize you,\" Kitty said.\nHer mother was in town looking for a shower curtain and had thought she would pop in to say hello. But after that there was little enough to talk about. Kitty was used to seeing her at home; out in the open, she seemed surprisingly well dressed and mute.\n\"Well, you always know where to find me,\" Kitty said to her, with a stranger's smile.\nKitty ended up seducing a man from the local Drama Society, a little to his surprise. He had been courting her for months, but in an old-fashioned sort of way. He was sixty-plus, and Kitty was forty-plus; that was the kind of age gap you could expect, with two nearly grown sons. They were both in a production of \"Johnny Belinda,\" a play about a deaf-mute who gets pregnant, though it comes out right in the end. Kitty did the interval coffees and had a walk-on in the final scene; Tom, for that was the man's name, did the set. He was good with his hands, he said, as he bent over a sawhorse in the scene dock, and Kitty flicked a glance at him to see what he meant—but all he meant was that he was good at making things. Nice. In a way. He drove her home after rehearsal most nights, and one evening they stopped out to eat. After which, Kitty asked him in for a drink.\nTom. He said all he needed was a couple of hours to fit two dimmers where the old light switch was, but she'd need to redecorate, after. He looked at the photos on her mantelpiece. He was recently bereaved. His daughter had told him to join the Drama Society, so there he was. In a moment, Kitty thought, he would tell her about his teeth, that they were all his own. Faded brown eyes, silver hair, a handsome where-did-it-all-go-wrong face. They were on the sofa, safe enough. Kitty's older son lumbered in from the pub, and stayed to be introduced. Her younger one was upstairs with his own TV. They were nice boys. They did not expect their mother to seduce old geezers in the front room, and neither did the geezer. It was awkward all the way through, and quite satisfying. Kitty did not tell him about her ex-husband, as he did not talk about his dead wife. She did not tell him that her husband had strayed, that she had done everything to keep him, up to and including porn videos in the bedroom, and that, when she finally left, the judge held that desertion against her and awarded him the house. She did not tell him how her husband had moved a woman in, two weeks after walking out of court. She did not tell him how the boys had followed her eventually to her bedsit and looked after her, as only young boys can, how together they had made their way here, to the outer suburbs and a decent life. Nor did she tell him that she was pregnant, when she realized that she was pregnant. She just let him, and the Drama Society, lapse, soon after the curtain had rung down on \"Johnny Belinda,\" and before anyone could be surprised.\nAt first, she thought it was the change of life. She stood in the Bed Department and waited for hot flashes. She did not mind growing old as long as it meant growing easy, but it did not seem to be working out that way. There was an agitation, a turbulence in her blood. She rode all the way up to Accounts to query her pay slip, and she landed back down in the Bed Department with a thump. She walked the floor and sat on the beds. She had a terrible need to lie down on one of them. One Monday evening, during stocktaking, she actually did lie down. She simply reclined. She let her back sink into a double-sprung Slumberland, and felt she might never rise again.\nIt was not until she bought three pots of apricot jam that the penny dropped. She did not even bother to take a test. She felt that swooping blankness she had felt with each of the boys, so delicious, like diving into a pool and finding you can breathe. The child was no bigger than a pip in the flesh of her stomach. She took it for walks and little outings. She gave it a go on the escalators and on a park swing, scuffing the coarse sand under her feet and feeling a little mad. What would she tell the boys? As for the people in the Bed Department—Jackie, who shared the floor with her, and the customers who came in to look or buy—they all looked empty to her, like husks. As though she were the only real thing left. It was like that film with the pods, and she wanted to run away somewhere, to a deserted lighthouse, or a shack by the beach, and sit in a shaft of light while her baby grew.\nTom rang. His voice was a shock.\n\"I just thought I'd check up on you.\" He sounded close, he sounded right inside her ear. Kitty had to remind herself that there were miles of cable between them, a maze of electricity and static.\n\"I'm fine,\" she said. \"How are things?\"\n\"Good. Good.\"\nIn the pause, she felt sorry for him. He wasn't used to this kind of thing.\n\"And yourself?\" he said.\n\"Oh, flying,\" she said. \"Flying form.\" And he took the hint and let it go.\nThen, one morning, the down elevator sighed and stopped. People clumped down the steps carefully, almost aslant, squinting at the lines that were strangely solid now, though they still seemed to shift beneath their feet. Kitty was glad she wasn't on the thing when it ground to a halt. It would make you look so foolish. As it happened, the escalators were empty, apart from a young woman on the other side, who seemed to surge suddenly up. Whoosh.\nKitty knew it didn't mean anything, but she feared for her baby, which was now just eleven weeks old. She could not bear the lopsided sight of the stalled steps; they were like someone endlessly limping at the other end of the shop floor. She took a very long lunch, and when she came back a man had taken the panel off the bottom of the broken side. She was right about the chain—there it was, looping around the steps that were wedges, actually, when you looked at them side-on. They packed around the central pivot like big slices of metal pie, then separated out on the way up, dangling their triangular bases into space.\nThe escalator man glanced at her as she stared into the works, and then went back to his phase tester, tipping the metal gently here and there. He had hair on the backs of his hands, fine and light: one of those furry men with cushioned muscles and uncertain eyes. Kitty stood for a long time, making him uneasy. He glanced over his shoulder again, but he did not really see her—which was fine.\nKitty lost the baby at thirteen weeks, or lost something, at any rate. She looked at the blood on the wad of toilet paper and wondered if she was in the change of life, after all. Perhaps she had imagined the baby, perhaps it had never been there in the first place. She called in sick and went to bed and could not cry.\nAt the weekend, she drove her younger son to his soccer game in the Fifteen Acres. She had to park a distance away, because he was embarrassed by the car. Also, he did not like having his mother on the sidelines anymore, so Kitty, amused, went for a walk instead. She thought she might look for the deer. And, almost as she thought it, there they were, a herd of does and their fawns, standing or lying, and all of them chewing, watching, as she now watched, a pair of children and their toy plane buzzing at the other end of the glen.\nShe felt sure now that it had been a baby—that she had not been fooled. Her stomach was still warm and aching from it. The deer chewed on and did not mind her, while the toy plane buzzed and sputtered and fell to the ground.\nThe change of life.\nHer life was changing, that was for sure, though she seemed to be standing still. But up or down? she wondered. Up or down? The children threw the plane back into the air, and it circled again on the end of its wire. Kitty walked on. It had been a baby, she knew it. She had been visited. How could it be down, when she felt such joy. ♦",

Then he said that Kevin Daly was actually his father, but that he did not know he was his father, or he did not know that he was his son. He said that he was looking for his father because his mother was sick and that was why she had given him his father's name, finally—Kevin Daly, and the fact that he'd gone to school in Malahide. \"It was a schooltime romance,\" he said. Kitty just said \"Sorry\" a lot, the way you might say \"I see.\"\n\"Sorry,\" she said.\n\"So that's why—you know?\"\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nHe asked did she have a brother called Kevin Daly, or a cousin, and she just said, \"No, sorry.\" But he was quite insistent, as though she might be harboring the man. \"No really, I'm sorry,\" she said, and put down the phone.\nThe next day, Kitty expected someone to float down the escalator into the Bed Department and call her by name. She did not know who it might be. A girl, maybe, with green eyes, or a slender young boy. She imagined a man in a perfect black suit—something extra about him, anyway, like Cary Grant. A young man with curly red hair gazed at her—or through her—all the way from the floor above, and she wondered, bizarrely, if he was the person she was waiting for. Also what he might say to her, if he was.\nThen a figure did appear that made her heart turn, and it took a while before Kitty realized that it was her own mother, sailing down from Fabrics and Soft Furnishings like a queen.\nCritics at Large Live, featuring Julio Torres\n\"I didn't recognize you,\" Kitty said.\nHer mother was in town looking for a shower curtain and had thought she would pop in to say hello. But after that there was little enough to talk about. Kitty was used to seeing her at home; out in the open, she seemed surprisingly well dressed and mute.\n\"Well, you always know where to find me,\" Kitty said to her, with a stranger's smile.\nKitty ended up seducing a man from the local Drama Society, a little to his surprise. He had been courting her for months, but in an old-fashioned sort of way. He was sixty-plus, and Kitty was forty-plus; that was the kind of age gap you could expect, with two nearly grown sons. They were both in a production of \"Johnny Belinda,\" a play about a deaf-mute who gets pregnant, though it comes out right in the end. Kitty did the interval coffees and had a walk-on in the final scene; Tom, for that was the man's name, did the set. He was good with his hands, he said, as he bent over a sawhorse in the scene dock, and Kitty flicked a glance at him to see what he meant—but all he meant was that he was good at making things. Nice. In a way. He drove her home after rehearsal most nights, and one evening they stopped out to eat. After which, Kitty asked him in for a drink.\nTom. He said all he needed was a couple of hours to fit two dimmers where the old light switch was, but she'd need to redecorate, after. He looked at the photos on her mantelpiece. He was recently bereaved. His daughter had told him to join the Drama Society, so there he was. In a moment, Kitty thought, he would tell her about his teeth, that they were all his own. Faded brown eyes, silver hair, a handsome where-did-it-all-go-wrong face. They were on the sofa, safe enough. Kitty's older son lumbered in from the pub, and stayed to be introduced. Her younger one was upstairs with his own TV. They were nice boys. They did not expect their mother to seduce old geezers in the front room, and neither did the geezer. It was awkward all the way through, and quite satisfying. Kitty did not tell him about her ex-husband, as he did not talk about his dead wife. She did not tell him that her husband had strayed, that she had done everything to keep him, up to and including porn videos in the bedroom, and that, when she finally left, the judge held that desertion against her and awarded him the house. She did not tell him how her husband had moved a woman in, two weeks after walking out of court. She did not tell him how the boys had followed her eventually to her bedsit and looked after her, as only young boys can, how together they had made their way here, to the outer suburbs and a decent life. Nor did she tell him that she was pregnant, when she realized that she was pregnant. She just let him, and the Drama Society, lapse, soon after the curtain had rung down on \"Johnny Belinda,\" and before anyone could be surprised.\nAt first, she thought it was the change of life. She stood in the Bed Department and waited for hot flashes. She did not mind growing old as long as it meant growing easy, but it did not seem to be working out that way. There was an agitation, a turbulence in her blood. She rode all the way up to Accounts to query her pay slip, and she landed back down in the Bed Department with a thump. She walked the floor and sat on the beds. She had a terrible need to lie down on one of them. One Monday evening, during stocktaking, she actually did lie down. She simply reclined. She let her back sink into a double-sprung Slumberland, and felt she might never rise again.\nIt was not until she bought three pots of apricot jam that the penny dropped. She did not even bother to take a test. She felt that swooping blankness she had felt with each of the boys, so delicious, like diving into a pool and finding you can breathe. The child was no bigger than a pip in the flesh of her stomach. She took it for walks and little outings. She gave it a go on the escalators and on a park swing, scuffing the coarse sand under her feet and feeling a little mad. What would she tell the boys? As for the people in the Bed Department—Jackie, who shared the floor with her, and the customers who came in to look or buy—they all looked empty to her, like husks. As though she were the only real thing left. It was like that film with the pods, and she wanted to run away somewhere, to a deserted lighthouse, or a shack by the beach, and sit in a shaft of light while her baby grew.\nTom rang. His voice was a shock.\n\"I just thought I'd check up on you.\" He sounded close, he sounded right inside her ear. Kitty had to remind herself that there were miles of cable between them, a maze of electricity and static.\n\"I'm fine,\" she said. \"How are things?\"\n\"Good. Good.\"\nIn the pause, she felt sorry for him. He wasn't used to this kind of thing.\n\"And yourself?\" he said.\n\"Oh, flying,\" she said. \"Flying form.\" And he took the hint and let it go.\nThen, one morning, the down elevator sighed and stopped. People clumped down the steps carefully, almost aslant, squinting at the lines that were strangely solid now, though they still seemed to shift beneath their feet. Kitty was glad she wasn't on the thing when it ground to a halt. It would make you look so foolish. As it happened, the escalators were empty, apart from a young woman on the other side, who seemed to surge suddenly up. Whoosh.\nKitty knew it didn't mean anything, but she feared for her baby, which was now just eleven weeks old. She could not bear the lopsided sight of the stalled steps; they were like someone endlessly limping at the other end of the shop floor. She took a very long lunch, and when she came back a man had taken the panel off the bottom of the broken side. She was right about the chain—there it was, looping around the steps that were wedges, actually, when you looked at them side-on. They packed around the central pivot like big slices of metal pie, then separated out on the way up, dangling their triangular bases into space.\nThe escalator man glanced at her as she stared into the works, and then went back to his phase tester, tipping the metal gently here and there. He had hair on the backs of his hands, fine and light: one of those furry men with cushioned muscles and uncertain eyes. Kitty stood for a long time, making him uneasy. He glanced over his shoulder again, but he did not really see her—which was fine.\nKitty lost the baby at thirteen weeks, or lost something, at any rate. She looked at the blood on the wad of toilet paper and wondered if she was in the change of life, after all. Perhaps she had imagined the baby, perhaps it had never been there in the first place. She called in sick and went to bed and could not cry.\nAt the weekend, she drove her younger son to his soccer game in the Fifteen Acres. She had to park a distance away, because he was embarrassed by the car. Also, he did not like having his mother on the sidelines anymore, so Kitty, amused, went for a walk instead. She thought she might look for the deer. And, almost as she thought it, there they were, a herd of does and their fawns, standing or lying, and all of them chewing, watching, as she now watched, a pair of children and their toy plane buzzing at the other end of the glen.\nShe felt sure now that it had been a baby—that she had not been fooled. Her stomach was still warm and aching from it. The deer chewed on and did not mind her, while the toy plane buzzed and sputtered and fell to the ground.\nThe change of life.\nHer life was changing, that was for sure, though she seemed to be standing still. But up or down? she wondered. Up or down? The children threw the plane back into the air, and it circled again on the end of its wire. Kitty walked on. It had been a baby, she knew it. She had been visited. How could it be down, when she felt such joy. ♦",

        "story": "Kitty was suspicious of the escalator, or, more properly, the escalators, as there were two of them, one falling and one rising, anchored side by side in the middle of the main shopping floor. She disliked the push of the motor, and, under that, the light clacking sound of something she could not analyze. A chain perhaps, that ran loose, deep in the machine.\nThey were new. The space where they appeared had been boxed in for months, floor to ceiling, with cheap wooden panelling, painted blue. First, a hole was knocked in the floor, and then another in the ceiling above, she supposed. They worked at night, but even during the day men came out from behind the panelling, filthy and smiling, and went back in again: ordinary Dublin men who worked whenever, and installed escalators in the middle of the night. She wondered how much they were paid.\nKitty tried to take to them, but she couldn't. She was disturbed by the sight of them out among the merchandise. She disliked the way they talked to each other loudly and laughed as if they owned the shop. They interrupted the conversation, somehow. You'd be selling a bed, talking about springs, you'd be with a young couple, pushing into the mattress in a cozy sort of way, and who would stroll past but the lean blond one, maybe, with the dirty-looking tan, adjusting his zip on the way back from the loo.\nNot that she minded men. She had two grown sons at home, so she was used to it: the cheerfulness, the indifference, and the mess. Though sometimes she turned around in the kitchen and was shocked by the sheer size of them—all that protein and carbohydrate, the muscle and milk of them, as though she had fed a couple of potted plants, and grown triffids.\nThen, one morning, she walked in and the men were gone. The place was perfect; the carpets fresh and new, the hoarding dissolved into thin air, and, in the middle of the floor, a pair of escalators, one going up and the other coming down. The steps tugged lightly at each other as they passed, snagging and loosening all day long. They ticked in the corner of her eye, making her feel balanced, or dizzy, depending on the light. They were so clean. The up escalator always mounting itself, stair over stair; the down escalator falling like syrup, burying itself slowly in the flatness of the floor.\nThey were beautiful, and they never stopped, and finally they got on her nerves. Nothing happened in the Bed Department. People bought a bed, or they did not buy a bed. Kitty used to like the open space, the hummocky slabs of mattress, the headboards like tombstones in a giant graveyard. \"Who's been sleeping in my bed?\" But all her satisfaction was gone now. The way people lay down and curled up, in the middle of the crowd. The old couples sitting on either side of the mattress and looking over their shoulders at each other in a way that was almost coy; the giggles and the silences. Most people buying a bed were in love, she used to think, or hopeful at least of finding love. Now they just bounced up and down or put their dirty feet up or looked like they could kill for a decent night's sleep.\nShe was at home one evening, washing the dishes, when the phone rang. It was a young man who said he was looking for a Kevin Daly. Kitty was listed as K. Daly in the phone book, and she didn't want to give too much away. She said that there was no Kevin Daly at that number, and the young man asked if she was sure. He said that he was looking for a Kevin Daly he used to know, a man who had gone to school in Malahide. \"I'm sorry,\" Kitty said, but they were talking to each other now. He told her that Kevin Daly was his brother, long out of touch.

        "story": "Short story about a woman who marries an ice man... I married an ice man. I first met him in a hotel at a ski resort. \"Look, that's an ice man,\" my friend whispered. The iceman was tall, and he seemed to be young, but his fingers were rimed with a white frost that looked as if it would never melt. Something about him pierced me to the heart. I made up some excuse not to go out, and stayed in the hotel. I felt compelled to talk to the ice man no matter what. \"I don't ski,\" he said. \"I just like to sit here and read and look at the snow. You're interested in me, aren't you? You want to know what an ice man is.\" I held back from asking personal questions. Instead, the iceman talked about me. Somehow, he knew all about me. \"How do you know so much about me?\" \"I can't read minds or anything. I just know.\" Eventually we started dating. We always sat on a bench in the park and talked.\" \"Why don't you talk about yourself? How did you come to be an ice man?\" \"I don't know. I don't even know if I had parents.\" I fell seriously in love with this ice man. The ice man loved me just as I wasóin the present. My mother and my older sister were strongly opposed to my marrying the ice man. \"You don't know a thing about his background.\" So we got married. Nobody blessed the wedding, and no friends or relatives were happy for us. We rented a tiny apartment, and the ice man made a living by working at a cold-storage meat facility The two of us lived a happy life together, without bothering or being bothered by anyone. I even started to love having sex with the ice man. We wanted to have a child but that didn't seem to be possible. It may have been that human genes and ice-man genes didn't combine easily. I found myself with time on my hands. I would finish up all the housework, and then having nothing to do. I was still young, and doing the same thing day after day. \"How would it be if the two of us went away on a trip somewhere, just for a change?\" \"Well, if you really want to go on a trip so badly, I don't have anything against it.\" \"How about visiting the South Pole?\" It seemed as soon as I spoke the words \"South Pole,\" something changed inside him. I had a premonition that if we went to the South Pole something would happen to us, but I couldn't find a good reason to cancel the trip. When we stepped off onto the ground of the South Pole I felt my husbands body lurch. something inside the ice man had been secretly violently shaken. He walked enthusiastically from place to place as if he couldn't get enough of it. He learned the local language quickly. I felt as though my husband had betrayed me and left me to care for myself. I eventually lost my strength. The airplane that had brought us there wad long since gone, and the runway was covered with ice. \"Winter has come It looks as though we'll have to stay here until next spring.\" About three months after we arrived, I realized I was pregnant.

        "story": "It mattered that Lotte’s apartment was commodious. Lotte liked to boast that when she lay in bed and looked past the two closest water towers, past the architectural follies and oddities few people notice on Manhattan’s rooftops, she saw all the way to the Empire State Building. On the velvet sofa in Lotte’s living room, from which she could observe the Hudson River traffic as far as the George Washington Bridge, the caregiver sat watching television.\n“Get rid of her,” Lotte said.\nSamson dropped his voice, as if this might make his mother lower hers. “As soon as we find you a replacement.”\n“And I’ll get rid of her,” Lotte said.\nSam said, “We’ll go on interviewing till we find you the right one.”\n“Who will let me eat my bread and butter?”\n“Mom,” Sam said, “bread turns into sugar, as you know very well.”\n“And don’t care,” Lotte said.\n“If she lets you eat bread for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, she’ll get fired.”\n“Good,” said Lotte.\n•\n“Sarah,” Sam said to the caregiver, “I’ll take my mother to her ladies’ lunch if you’ll pick her up at three-thirty?”\n“That O.K. with you?” Sarah asked Lotte.\n“No,” said Lotte.\n•\n“Ladies’ lunch” is pronounced in quotation marks. The five women have grown old coming together, every other month or so for the last thirty or more years, around one another’s table. Ruth, Bridget, Farah, Lotte, and Bessie are longtime New Yorkers; their origins in California, County Mayo, Tehran, Vienna, and the Bronx might have grounded them but do not in these days often surface.\nRuth was a retired lawyer. She said, “I’ve forgotten, of course, who it was said that there are four or five people in the world to whom we tell things, and that’s us. Something happens and I think, I’ll tell the next ladies’ lunch.”\n“True! It’s true,” Lotte said. “When I suddenly sat on my rear on the sidewalk outside my front door, I was looking forward to telling you.”\nLotte had turned out to need a hip replacement. Dr. Goodman, the surgeon, was a furry man like a character in an Ed Koren cartoon, only jollier. He had promised Lotte, “From here on it’s all good.”\n“I’m eighty-two years old,” Lotte had said.\nGoodman told her, “I’m on my way to the ninety-second birthday of a patient whose knees I replaced eleven years ago.”\nBessie said, “And I told you, from my poor Colin’s experience, that the recovery is not so much like Goodman’s cheery projection.” These days, it depended on the state of Colin’s health and Colin’s mood whether Bessie was able to take the train in from Old Rockingham.\n•\nToday’s lunch was at Bridget’s, so she got to set the agenda: “ ‘How to Prevent the Inevitable.’ I mean any of the scenarios we would rather die than live in.” Bridget was a writer who still spent mornings at her computer.\nRunning the New York City Marathon at Age Eighty-Six\nFarah, a recently retired doctor, said, “The old problem of shuffling off this mortal coil.”\n“Of shuffling off,” Lotte said.\n“And it was you who said you wanted to see it all, to see what would happen to the end,” Farah reminded Lotte.\n“I wasn’t counting on the twenty-four-hour caregiver or the heart-healthy diet,” said Lotte. “You doctors need to do a study of the correlation between salt-free food and depression.”\n“Your Sarah seems pleasant enough,” Ruth said. “What’s wrong with her?”\n“That she’s in my living room,” Lotte said, “watching television; that she’s in my kitchen eating her lunch, which she does standing up; that she’s in my spare room asleep, and in my bathroom whenever I want to go in.”\nRuth asked Lotte what Sarah did for her. “Do you need a caregiver to help you dress?”\n“No,” Lotte said.\n“You need a caregiver to help you shower?”\n“No,” Lotte said.\n“Get your meals?”\n“God, _no! _”\n“So what do you need help with?”\n“The caregiver,” Lotte said.\n“Go away,” she said to Sarah, who had come to take her home. The four friends’ mouths dropped to see their friend raise her arm at the caregiver and slap the air.\n•\nThey were of an age when they worried if one of them did not answer her telephone.\nBessie, Lotte’s oldest friend, had known Sam since he was a baby. She called him from Connecticut. “Why doesn’t the caregiver pick up Lotte’s phone?”\n“She’s gone. There was just too much abuse.”\n“You’re kidding me! What? That nice Sarah? You’re talking elder abuse?”\n“More like caregiver abuse,” Sam said.\n“Like what?”\n“Like Mom would change the channel Sarah was watching on the TV. She’d come into the kitchen and pack away the food Sarah was preparing for her lunch, and turn on the light when Sarah was asleep. It was getting bizarre. I’m here waiting with her for the new woman.”\n•\nBessie e-mailed the friends in New York to look in on Lotte.\nBridget went to see Lotte. Bridget, Lotte, and Shareen, the new caregiver, sat looking out on Riverside Drive. Lotte said, “Shareen drives in from New Jersey. Shareen has a five-year-old who brushes his own teeth. Shareen told him that if he doesn’t brush, a roach will grow in his mouth.”\nBessie phoned Lotte. “How is the new caregiver?”\n“Intrusive,” said Lotte.\nWhen Farah called Lotte, it was Sam who picked up the phone. “Shareen is gone. Mom locked her—I can’t make out if it was into or out of the bathroom, but it wasn’t that. Shareen did not want to have to manhandle Mom to stop her eating sugar by the spoonfuls.”\n“Lotte is angry,” Farah said. “After making your own decisions your life long, it must be hell having someone tell you what you can eat and when to shower and what to wear.”\n“Because her own decisions are not tenable,” Sam said. “Greg is coming in from Chicago.” Gregor was Lotte’s younger son. “We’re going to check out this nice assisted-living home. It sounds really nice. Upscale.”\n“Sam? You’re moving Lotte out of her apartment?”\n“To a nice home in the country.”\n“A home in the country. You discussed this move with Lotte?”\n“Yes.”\n“And she has agreed?”\n“Well, yes, she has. In a way,” Sam said. “She said next year, maybe. Listen. Mom cannot deal with the round-the-clock caregivers. And believe me that she does not, does not, want to move in with Diana and me.”\n•\nBridget phoned Sam. “So, what’s this place you want to move Lotte into?”\n“Called Three Trees. It’s in the Hudson Valley,” Sam told her. “My brother will help me move Mom in, and move the stuff she’s fond of—the famous velvet sofa.”\n“And she will have an apartment of her own?”\n“A bedsitter, neat and convenient, with her own bathroom and a breakfast nook.”\n“Her own nook,” Bridget said. “What’s outside the window?”\n“The Hudson River view, unfortunately, is on the other side of the building. Trees. There’s a little parking lot and lots of green. Listen. We know Mom would prefer Manhattan—which would have been a hell of a lot more convenient for Diana and me to visit her—but who can afford something nice in the city?”\nBridget said, “It’s that none of us drives these days. How are we going to visit?”\n“One of the advantages is that there will always be people around.”\n“Does Lotte think this is an advantage?”\nSam said, “I have never been in a situation where there hasn’t been somebody to talk with.”\n“I have,” said Bridget.\n“And I would know she’s getting three proper meals.”\nGod. Poor Lotte, thought Bridget. And poor Sam. “You’re not a happy camper,” she said to him, wondering what the phrase came from.\n•\nRuth, an old activist, had an idea. She said, “I’ll talk to Sam.”\n“Have you closed on the Hudson Valley place?” she asked him.\n“Greg and I are going up on Thursday.”\nRuth said, “Will you give us a couple of days to figure something out?”\n“Believe me, there is nothing to . . . Yes, sure. O.K. But I need to get Mom and her stuff moved before Greg leaves for Chicago.”\nRuth said, “Could Lotte live alone if—”\n“Absolutely not.”\n“Sam, wait. Could Lotte live alone if the four of us—the three of us if Bessie can’t come in—take turns checking on Lotte, to see what she needs and if anything is wrong?”\n“Mom would put sugar on her bread and butter.”\n“Sounds delicious,” Ruth said.\n“She would never change her clothes.”\n“Probably not.”\n“She would have one shower a week. She would not shower.”\n“Sam! So what!”\n“Not on my watch,” Sam said. “Things need to be done right.”\n“No, they don’t. Why do they need to be right?”\n“When Mom messed up her medicines, Greg and I had to rush her to Emergency. She might have died.”\n“Yes. She might. Your mother might have died in her own bed, in sight of the Empire State Building and the George Washington Bridge. No, but Sam, we will go up and check on her. Let’s try it—a couple of days.”\n“What if she falls down again?”\n“She falls down. Sam, I’ll sleep over there tonight.”\nRuth slept over at Lotte’s, and Lotte fell going from her bed to the bathroom. Ruth called Sam, and Sam and Gregor came and took Lotte to Emergency.\n•\nSamson and Gregor moved their mother, the sofa, and whatever else out of Lotte’s ample apartment could be made to fit, into the bedsitter in the Hudson Valley. Greg flew back to Chicago.\n•\nWhen the ladies’ lunch met in Farah’s apartment, the agenda was Lotte’s rescue. Farah had a plan.\nThey brought each other up to date.\nLotte had phoned Ruth from Three Trees. Ruth said, “I didn’t recognize her voice. I mean, I knew that it was Lotte, but her voice sounded different, strangled, a new, strange voice.”\n“Lotte is furious,” Bessie said.\n“Yes, I know that voice,” Bridget said. “Lotte called me. She remembered my sitting with her and Shareen. She wanted me to get Shareen’s phone number. Shareen drives a car. Lotte wants Shareen to come and pick her up at Three Trees and drive her home to the apartment. Which is not going to happen.”\n“Now when I go abroad I tell everyone Im a Canadian goose.”\n“Now when I go abroad I tell everyone I’m a Canadian goose.”\nCopy link to cartoon\nLink copied\nShop\n“Lotte called me,” reported Farah. “She wants us—her and me—to rent a car together. I told her I haven’t renewed my license. I doubt if I could pass the eye test. Not a problem, Lotte said. She would drive.”\n“Does she even have a license?”\n“Lotte hasn’t driven in ten years.”\nBessie said, “Sam called me and he was fit to be tied. Wanted to know if I had something to do with Lotte buying a car. Buying a car! Me? I have never actually bought a car in my life. Lotte believes that she has bought a car and keeps calling this dealer to send her the keys.”\nBessie had called Lotte and asked her, “What’s this about a car?” Lotte said, “It’s down there in the parking lot.” “What kind of a car is this?” Bessie had asked her, and Lotte said, “I’m waiting till they send me the virtual key.”\n•\nFarah’s plan: Farah had an eighteen-year-old grandson, Hami. He would have his license as soon as he passed his test. “He’ll drive us to Three Trees, and we will bring Lotte back.”\n“Better be soon,” Bessie said. “Sam is putting Lotte’s apartment on the market.”\n“The test is this Monday.”\nBut Hami failed his test.\n•\nBridget phoned Lotte at Three Trees. “How’s it going?”\n“Not good.”\n“How is the food?”\n“Salt free.”\n“Judging from your voice, you’re getting a little bit used to being there?”\n“Can you come and get me and take me back to my apartment?”\n“Lotte, we just really wouldn’t know how. For the moment, might it be a good idea to accommodate yourself?”\n“Yes. But I need to go home,” Lotte said.\n“Have you found anyone to talk to?”\n“Yes. Alana. She sits next to me in the dining room. Alana has three children and five grandchildren, the oldest nineteen, the twins age thirteen, and a nine- and a five-year-old. Would you like me to tell you what their names are?”\n“Not really.”\n“Would you like me to tell you where each of them goes to school?”\n“Lotte . . . ”\n“Minnie Mansfield has a grandson. His name is Joel, and Joel has a friend whose name is Sam, like my Sam. Shall I tell you which colleges Sam and which colleges Joel are considering going to?”\n“Lotte . . . ”\n“Minnie’s sister’s granddaughter,” said Lotte, “is thinking of taking a gap year before she goes to Williams.”\n“Lotte . . . ”\nLotte said, “I have not told Alana or Minnie that I’ve died. I thought awhile before telling Sam, but he was fine. He was really very good about it, my poor Sam.”\n“You mean that you feel as if . . . ” Bridget hesitated between saying “as if you have died” and “as if you are dead.”\nLotte said, “No. I am dead. If I saw Dr. Goodman—or any doctor—he would look down my throat and see the four yellow spots dead people have. When you write the story, the question is whether, now that I am dead, I can die again, a second time, or is this what it is from here on.”\n“Lotte, you want me to write your story?”\n“You’ve already written how I got rid of Sarah and Shareen, and the roach in Shareen’s five-year-old’s mouth, and about Sam and Greg putting me here in the boonies.”\n“Lotte,” Bridget said, “we’re mobilizing ourselves. We’re trying to figure out how to come and visit you.”\n“Good! Oh, oh, good, good!” Lotte said. She wanted them to give her enough lead time so she could arrange a ladies’ lunch in the Three Trees dining room. “Then I’ll tell you how I lay down on my sofa—this was last Friday—just to take a nap, and when I woke up I knew that I was going to die, and I died.”\n•\nSam has taken time off twice this month to go and visit his mother. He feels that she is settling in. “When she says that she has died she means died to the old New York life in order to pass into the new life at Three Trees.”\n“That’s what you think she means?” Bessie asks him.\n“What else could she mean?”\nBessie is silent a moment. She says, “Lotte has stopped calling me.”\n“I know,” Sam says. “She doesn’t call me, and she doesn’t return Diana’s calls.”\n“She doesn’t pick up her phone.”\n“I know,” Sam says.\n•\nBessie is pretty much stuck in Old Rockingham. Colin seems to be on the decline. Poor Bridget didn’t make it to the last ladies’ lunch, because she had one of her frequent debilitating headaches, but she wants to come along if Ruth and Farah figure out how to go and visit Lotte.\nThe idea to hitch a ride with Sam when he drives up to Three Trees gets screwed up because Lotte does not return Farah’s call. “And then I guess I forgot to call her,” Ruth says. “In any case, there wouldn’t have really been time to change my doctor’s appointment.”\n•\nHami has got his license and has driven his new secondhand car to his first semester at Purchase.\n•\nFarah and Bridget still mean to figure out some way to go up and see Lotte, maybe in the spring, when the weather is nicer. ♦",

It’s in the Hudson Valley,” Sam told her. “My brother will help me move Mom in, and move the stuff she’s fond of—the famous velvet sofa.”\n“And she will have an apartment of her own?”\n“A bedsitter, neat and convenient, with her own bathroom and a breakfast nook.”\n“Her own nook,” Bridget said. “What’s outside the window?”\n“The Hudson River view, unfortunately, is on the other side of the building. Trees. There’s a little parking lot and lots of green. Listen. We know Mom would prefer Manhattan—which would have been a hell of a lot more convenient for Diana and me to visit her—but who can afford something nice in the city?”\nBridget said, “It’s that none of us drives these days. How are we going to visit?”\n“One of the advantages is that there will always be people around.”\n“Does Lotte think this is an advantage?”\nSam said, “I have never been in a situation where there hasn’t been somebody to talk with.”\n“I have,” said Bridget.\n“And I would know she’s getting three proper meals.”\nGod. Poor Lotte, thought Bridget. And poor Sam. “You’re not a happy camper,” she said to him, wondering what the phrase came from.\n•\nRuth, an old activist, had an idea. She said, “I’ll talk to Sam.”\n“Have you closed on the Hudson Valley place?” she asked him.\n“Greg and I are going up on Thursday.”\nRuth said, “Will you give us a couple of days to figure something out?”\n“Believe me, there is nothing to . . . Yes, sure. O.K. But I need to get Mom and her stuff moved before Greg leaves for Chicago.”\nRuth said, “Could Lotte live alone if—”\n“Absolutely not.”\n“Sam, wait. Could Lotte live alone if the four of us—the three of us if Bessie can’t come in—take turns checking on Lotte, to see what she needs and if anything is wrong?”\n“Mom would put sugar on her bread and butter.”\n“Sounds delicious,” Ruth said.\n“She would never change her clothes.”\n“Probably not.”\n“She would have one shower a week. She would not shower.”\n“Sam! So what!”\n“Not on my watch,” Sam said. “Things need to be done right.”\n“No, they don’t. Why do they need to be right?”\n“When Mom messed up her medicines, Greg and I had to rush her to Emergency. She might have died.”\n“Yes. She might. Your mother might have died in her own bed, in sight of the Empire State Building and the George Washington Bridge. No, but Sam, we will go up and check on her. Let’s try it—a couple of days.”\n“What if she falls down again?”\n“She falls down. Sam, I’ll sleep over there tonight.”\nRuth slept over at Lotte’s, and Lotte fell going from her bed to the bathroom. Ruth called Sam, and Sam and Gregor came and took Lotte to Emergency.\n•\nSamson and Gregor moved their mother, the sofa, and whatever else out of Lotte’s ample apartment could be made to fit, into the bedsitter in the Hudson Valley. Greg flew back to Chicago.\n•\nWhen the ladies’ lunch met in Farah’s apartment, the agenda was Lotte’s rescue. Farah had a plan.\nThey brought each other up to date.\nLotte had phoned Ruth from Three Trees. Ruth said, “I didn’t recognize her voice. I mean, I knew that it was Lotte, but her voice sounded different, strangled, a new, strange voice.”\n“Lotte is furious,” Bessie said.\n“Yes, I know that voice,” Bridget said. “Lotte called me. She remembered my sitting with her and Shareen. She wanted me to get Shareen’s phone number. Shareen drives a car. Lotte wants Shareen to come and pick her up at Three Trees and drive her home to the apartment. Which is not going to happen.”\n“Now when I go abroad I tell everyone Im a Canadian goose.”\n“Now when I go abroad I tell everyone I’m a Canadian goose.”\nCopy link to cartoon\nLink copied\nShop\n“Lotte called me,” reported Farah. “She wants us—her and me—to rent a car together. I told her I haven’t renewed my license. I doubt if I could pass the eye test. Not a problem, Lotte said. She would drive.”\n“Does she even have a license?”\n“Lotte hasn’t driven in ten years.”\nBessie said, “Sam called me and he was fit to be tied. Wanted to know if I had something to do with Lotte buying a car. Buying a car! Me? I have never actually bought a car in my life. Lotte believes that she has bought a car and keeps calling this dealer to send her the keys.”\nBessie had called Lotte and asked her, “What’s this about a car?” Lotte said, “It’s down there in the parking lot.” “What kind of a car is this?” Bessie had asked her, and Lotte said, “I’m waiting till they send me the virtual key.”\n•\nFarah’s plan: Farah had an eighteen-year-old grandson, Hami. He would have his license as soon as he passed his test. “He’ll drive us to Three Trees, and we will bring Lotte back.”\n“Better be soon,” Bessie said. “Sam is putting Lotte’s apartment on the market.”\n“The test is this Monday.”\nBut Hami failed his test.\n•\nBridget phoned Lotte at Three Trees. “How’s it going?”\n“Not good.”\n“How is the food?”\n“Salt free.”\n“Judging from your voice, you’re getting a little bit used to being there?”\n“Can you come and get me and take me back to my apartment?”\n“Lotte, we just really wouldn’t know how. For the moment, might it be a good idea to accommodate yourself?”\n“Yes. But I need to go home,” Lotte said.\n“Have you found anyone to talk to?”\n“Yes. Alana. She sits next to me in the dining room. Alana has three children and five grandchildren, the oldest nineteen, the twins age thirteen, and a nine- and a five-year-old. Would you like me to tell you what their names are?”\n“Not really.”\n“Would you like me to tell you where each of them goes to school?”\n“Lotte . . . ”\n“Minnie Mansfield has a grandson. His name is Joel, and Joel has a friend whose name is Sam, like my Sam. Shall I tell you which colleges Sam and which colleges Joel are considering going to?”\n“Lotte . . . ”\n“Minnie’s sister’s granddaughter,” said Lotte, “is thinking of taking a gap year before she goes to Williams.”\n“Lotte . . . ”\nLotte said, “I have not told Alana or Minnie that I’ve died. I thought awhile before telling Sam, but he was fine. He was really very good about it, my poor Sam.”\n“You mean that you feel as if . . . ” Bridget hesitated between saying “as if you have died” and “as if you are dead.”\nLotte said, “No. I am dead. If I saw Dr. Goodman—or any doctor—he would look down my throat and see the four yellow spots dead people have. When you write the story, the question is whether, now that I am dead, I can die again, a second time, or is this what it is from here on.”\n“Lotte, you want me to write your story?”\n“You’ve already written how I got rid of Sarah and Shareen, and the roach in Shareen’s five-year-old’s mouth, and about Sam and Greg putting me here in the boonies.”\n“Lotte,” Bridget said, “we’re mobilizing ourselves. We’re trying to figure out how to come and visit you.”\n“Good! Oh, oh, good, good!” Lotte said. She wanted them to give her enough lead time so she could arrange a ladies’ lunch in the Three Trees dining room. “Then I’ll tell you how I lay down on my sofa—this was last Friday—just to take a nap, and when I woke up I knew that I was going to die, and I died.”\n•\nSam has taken time off twice this month to go and visit his mother. He feels that she is settling in. “When she says that she has died she means died to the old New York life in order to pass into the new life at Three Trees.”\n“That’s what you think she means?” Bessie asks him.\n“What else could she mean?”\nBessie is silent a moment. She says, “Lotte has stopped calling me.”\n“I know,” Sam says. “She doesn’t call me, and she doesn’t return Diana’s calls.”\n“She doesn’t pick up her phone.”\n“I know,” Sam says.\n•\nBessie is pretty much stuck in Old Rockingham. Colin seems to be on the decline. Poor Bridget didn’t make it to the last ladies’ lunch, because she had one of her frequent debilitating headaches, but she wants to come along if Ruth and Farah figure out how to go and visit Lotte.\nThe idea to hitch a ride with Sam when he drives up to Three Trees gets screwed up because Lotte does not return Farah’s call. “And then I guess I forgot to call her,” Ruth says. “In any case, there wouldn’t have really been time to change my doctor’s appointment.”\n•\nHami has got his license and has driven his new secondhand car to his first semester at Purchase.\n•\nFarah and Bridget still mean to figure out some way to go up and see Lotte, maybe in the spring, when the weather is nicer. ♦",

On the velvet sofa in Lotte’s living room, from which she could observe the Hudson River traffic as far as the George Washington Bridge, the caregiver sat watching television.\n“Get rid of her,” Lotte said.\nSamson dropped his voice, as if this might make his mother lower hers. “As soon as we find you a replacement.”\n“And I’ll get rid of her,” Lotte said.\nSam said, “We’ll go on interviewing till we find you the right one.”\n“Who will let me eat my bread and butter?”\n“Mom,” Sam said, “bread turns into sugar, as you know very well.”\n“And don’t care,” Lotte said.\n“If she lets you eat bread for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, she’ll get fired.”\n“Good,” said Lotte.\n•\n“Sarah,” Sam said to the caregiver, “I’ll take my mother to her ladies’ lunch if you’ll pick her up at three-thirty?”\n“That O.K. with you?” Sarah asked Lotte.\n“No,” said Lotte.\n•\n“Ladies’ lunch” is pronounced in quotation marks. The five women have grown old coming together, every other month or so for the last thirty or more years, around one another’s table.

She said, “I’ve forgotten, of course, who it was said that there are four or five people in the world to whom we tell things, and that’s us. Something happens and I think, I’ll tell the next ladies’ lunch.”\n“True! It’s true,” Lotte said. “When I suddenly sat on my rear on the sidewalk outside my front door, I was looking forward to telling you.”\nLotte had turned out to need a hip replacement. Dr. Goodman, the surgeon, was a furry man like a character in an Ed Koren cartoon, only jollier. He had promised Lotte, “From here on it’s all good.”\n“I’m eighty-two years old,” Lotte had said.\nGoodman told her, “I’m on my way to the ninety-second birthday of a patient whose knees I replaced eleven years ago.”\nBessie said, “And I told you, from my poor Colin’s experience, that the recovery is not so much like Goodman’s cheery projection.” These days, it depended on the state of Colin’s health and Colin’s mood whether Bessie was able to take the train in from Old Rockingham.\n•\nToday’s lunch was at Bridget’s, so she got to set the agenda: “ ‘How to Prevent the Inevitable.’ I mean any of the scenarios we would rather die than live in.” Bridget was a writer who still spent mornings at her computer.\nRunning the New York City Marathon at Age Eighty-Six\nFarah, a recently retired doctor, said, “The old problem of shuffling off this mortal coil.”\n“Of shuffling off,” Lotte said.\n“And it was you who said you wanted to see it all, to see what would happen to the end,” Farah reminded Lotte.\n“I wasn’t counting on the twenty-four-hour caregiver or the heart-healthy diet,” said Lotte. “You doctors need to do a study of the correlation between salt-free food and depression.”\n“Your Sarah seems pleasant enough,” Ruth said. “What’s wrong with her?”\n“That she’s in my living room,” Lotte said, “watching television; that she’s in my kitchen eating her lunch, which she does standing up; that she’s in my spare room asleep, and in my bathroom whenever I want to go in.”\nRuth asked Lotte what Sarah did for her. “Do you need a caregiver to help you dress?”\n“No,” Lotte said.\n“You need a caregiver to help you shower?”\n“No,” Lotte said.\n“Get your meals?”\n“God, _no! _”\n“So what do you need help with?”\n“The caregiver,” Lotte said.\n“Go away,” she said to Sarah, who had come to take her home. The four friends’ mouths dropped to see their friend raise her arm at the caregiver and slap the air.\n•\nThey were of an age when they worried if one of them did not answer her telephone.\nBessie, Lotte’s oldest friend, had known Sam since he was a baby. She called him from Connecticut. “Why doesn’t the caregiver pick up Lotte’s phone?”\n“She’s gone. There was just too much abuse.”\n“You’re kidding me! What? That nice Sarah? You’re talking elder abuse?”\n“More like caregiver abuse,” Sam said.\n“Like what?”\n“Like Mom would change the channel Sarah was watching on the TV. She’d come into the kitchen and pack away the food Sarah was preparing for her lunch, and turn on the light when Sarah was asleep. It was getting bizarre. I’m here waiting with her for the new woman.”\n•\nBessie e-mailed the friends in New York to look in on Lotte.\nBridget went to see Lotte. Bridget, Lotte, and Shareen, the new caregiver, sat looking out on Riverside Drive. Lotte said, “Shareen drives in from New Jersey. Shareen has a five-year-old who brushes his own teeth. Shareen told him that if he doesn’t brush, a roach will grow in his mouth.”\nBessie phoned Lotte. “How is the new caregiver?”\n“Intrusive,” said Lotte.\nWhen Farah called Lotte, it was Sam who picked up the phone. “Shareen is gone. Mom locked her—I can’t make out if it was into or out of the bathroom, but it wasn’t that. Shareen did not want to have to manhandle Mom to stop her eating sugar by the spoonfuls.”\n“Lotte is angry,” Farah said. “After making your own decisions your life long, it must be hell having someone tell you what you can eat and when to shower and what to wear.”\n“Because her own decisions are not tenable,” Sam said. “Greg is coming in from Chicago.” Gregor was Lotte’s younger son. “We’re going to check out this nice assisted-living home. It sounds really nice. Upscale.”\n“Sam? You’re moving Lotte out of her apartment?”\n“To a nice home in the country.”\n“A home in the country. You discussed this move with Lotte?”\n“Yes.”\n“And she has agreed?”\n“Well, yes, she has. In a way,” Sam said. “She said next year, maybe. Listen. Mom cannot deal with the round-the-clock caregivers.

She’d come into the kitchen and pack away the food Sarah was preparing for her lunch, and turn on the light when Sarah was asleep. It was getting bizarre. I’m here waiting with her for the new woman.”\n•\nBessie e-mailed the friends in New York to look in on Lotte.\nBridget went to see Lotte. Bridget, Lotte, and Shareen, the new caregiver, sat looking out on Riverside Drive. Lotte said, “Shareen drives in from New Jersey. Shareen has a five-year-old who brushes his own teeth. Shareen told him that if he doesn’t brush, a roach will grow in his mouth.”\nBessie phoned Lotte. “How is the new caregiver?”\n“Intrusive,” said Lotte.\nWhen Farah called Lotte, it was Sam who picked up the phone. “Shareen is gone. Mom locked her—I can’t make out if it was into or out of the bathroom, but it wasn’t that. Shareen did not want to have to manhandle Mom to stop her eating sugar by the spoonfuls.”\n“Lotte is angry,” Farah said. “After making your own decisions your life long, it must be hell having someone tell you what you can eat and when to shower and what to wear.”\n“Because her own decisions are not tenable,” Sam said. “Greg is coming in from Chicago.” Gregor was Lotte’s younger son. “We’re going to check out this nice assisted-living home. It sounds really nice. Upscale.”\n“Sam? You’re moving Lotte out of her apartment?”\n“To a nice home in the country.”\n“A home in the country. You discussed this move with Lotte?”\n“Yes.”\n“And she has agreed?”\n“Well, yes, she has. In a way,” Sam said. “She said next year, maybe. Listen. Mom cannot deal with the round-the-clock caregivers. And believe me that she does not, does not, want to move in with Diana and me.”\n•\nBridget phoned Sam. “So, what’s this place you want to move Lotte into?”\n“Called Three Trees. It’s in the Hudson Valley,” Sam told her. “My brother will help me move Mom in, and move the stuff she’s fond of—the famous velvet sofa.”\n“And she will have an apartment of her own?”\n“A bedsitter, neat and convenient, with her own bathroom and a breakfast nook.”\n“Her own nook,” Bridget said. “What’s outside the window?”\n“The Hudson River view, unfortunately, is on the other side of the building. Trees. There’s a little parking lot and lots of green. Listen. We know Mom would prefer Manhattan—which would have been a hell of a lot more convenient for Diana and me to visit her—but who can afford something nice in the city?”\nBridget said, “It’s that none of us drives these days. How are we going to visit?”\n“One of the advantages is that there will always be people around.”\n“Does Lotte think this is an advantage?”\nSam said, “I have never been in a situation where there hasn’t been somebody to talk with.”\n“I have,” said Bridget.\n“And I would know she’s getting three proper meals.”\nGod. Poor Lotte, thought Bridget. And poor Sam. “You’re not a happy camper,” she said to him, wondering what the phrase came from.\n•\nRuth, an old activist, had an idea. She said, “I’ll talk to Sam.”\n“Have you closed on the Hudson Valley place?” she asked him.\n“Greg and I are going up on Thursday.”\nRuth said, “Will you give us a couple of days to figure something out?”\n“Believe me, there is nothing to . . . Yes, sure. O.K. But I need to get Mom and her stuff moved before Greg leaves for Chicago.”\nRuth said, “Could Lotte live alone if—”\n“Absolutely not.”\n“Sam, wait. Could Lotte live alone if the four of us—the three of us if Bessie can’t come in—take turns checking on Lotte, to see what she needs and if anything is wrong?”\n“Mom would put sugar on her bread and butter.”\n“Sounds delicious,” Ruth said.\n“She would never change her clothes.”\n“Probably not.”\n“She would have one shower a week. She would not shower.”\n“Sam! So what!”\n“Not on my watch,” Sam said. “Things need to be done right.”\n“No, they don’t. Why do they need to be right?”\n“When Mom messed up her medicines, Greg and I had to rush her to Emergency. She might have died.”\n“Yes. She might. Your mother might have died in her own bed, in sight of the Empire State Building and the George Washington Bridge. No, but Sam, we will go up and check on her. Let’s try it—a couple of days.”\n“What if she falls down again?”\n“She falls down. Sam, I’ll sleep over there tonight.”\nRuth slept over at Lotte’s, and Lotte fell going from her bed to the bathroom. Ruth called Sam, and Sam and Gregor came and took Lotte to Emergency.\n•\nSamson and Gregor moved their mother, the sofa, and whatever else out of Lotte’s ample apartment could be made to fit, into the bedsitter in the Hudson Valley. Greg flew back to Chicago.\n•\nWhen the ladies’ lunch met in Farah’s apartment, the agenda was Lotte’s rescue. Farah had a plan.\nThey brought each other up to date.\nLotte had phoned Ruth from Three Trees. Ruth said, “I didn’t recognize her voice. I mean, I knew that it was Lotte, but her voice sounded different, strangled, a new, strange voice.”\n“Lotte is furious,” Bessie said.\n“Yes, I know that voice,” Bridget said. “Lotte called me. She remembered my sitting with her and Shareen. She wanted me to get Shareen’s phone number. Shareen drives a car. Lotte wants Shareen to come and pick her up at Three Trees and drive her home to the apartment. Which is not going to happen.”\n“Now when I go abroad I tell everyone Im a Canadian goose.”\n“Now when I go abroad I tell everyone I’m a Canadian goose.”\nCopy link to cartoon\nLink copied\nShop\n“Lotte called me,” reported Farah. “She wants us—her and me—to rent a car together. I told her I haven’t renewed my license. I doubt if I could pass the eye test. Not a problem, Lotte said. She would drive.”\n“Does she even have a license?”\n“Lotte hasn’t driven in ten years.”\nBessie said, “Sam called me and he was fit to be tied. Wanted to know if I had something to do with Lotte buying a car. Buying a car! Me? I have never actually bought a car in my life. Lotte believes that she has bought a car and keeps calling this dealer to send her the keys.”\nBessie had called Lotte and asked her, “What’s this about a car?” Lotte said, “It’s down there in the parking lot.” “What kind of a car is this?” Bessie had asked her, and Lotte said, “I’m waiting till they send me the virtual key.”\n•\nFarah’s plan: Farah had an eighteen-year-old grandson, Hami. He would have his license as soon as he passed his test. “He’ll drive us to Three Trees, and we will bring Lotte back.”\n“Better be soon,” Bessie said. “Sam is putting Lotte’s apartment on the market.”\n“The test is this Monday.”\nBut Hami failed his test.\n•\nBridget phoned Lotte at Three Trees. “How’s it going?”\n“Not good.”\n“How is the food?”\n“Salt free.”\n“Judging from your voice, you’re getting a little bit used to being there?”\n“Can you come and get me and take me back to my apartment?”\n“Lotte, we just really wouldn’t know how. For the moment, might it be a good idea to accommodate yourself?”\n“Yes. But I need to go home,” Lotte said.\n“Have you found anyone to talk to?”\n“Yes. Alana. She sits next to me in the dining room. Alana has three children and five grandchildren, the oldest nineteen, the twins age thirteen, and a nine- and a five-year-old. Would you like me to tell you what their names are?”\n“Not really.”\n“Would you like me to tell you where each of them goes to school?”\n“Lotte . . . ”\n“Minnie Mansfield has a grandson. His name is Joel, and Joel has a friend whose name is Sam, like my Sam. Shall I tell you which colleges Sam and which colleges Joel are considering going to?”\n“Lotte . . . ”\n“Minnie’s sister’s granddaughter,” said Lotte, “is thinking of taking a gap year before she goes to Williams.”\n“Lotte . . . ”\nLotte said, “I have not told Alana or Minnie that I’ve died. I thought awhile before telling Sam, but he was fine. He was really very good about it, my poor Sam.”\n“You mean that you feel as if . . . ” Bridget hesitated between saying “as if you have died” and “as if you are dead.”\nLotte said, “No. I am dead. If I saw Dr. Goodman—or any doctor—he would look down my throat and see the four yellow spots dead people have. When you write the story, the question is whether, now that I am dead, I can die again, a second time, or is this what it is from here on.”\n“Lotte, you want me to write your story?”\n“You’ve already written how I got rid of Sarah and Shareen, and the roach in Shareen’s five-year-old’s mouth, and about Sam and Greg putting me here in the boonies.”\n“Lotte,” Bridget said, “we’re mobilizing ourselves. We’re trying to figure out how to come and visit you.”\n“Good! Oh, oh, good, good!” Lotte said. She wanted them to give her enough lead time so she could arrange a ladies’ lunch in the Three Trees dining room. “Then I’ll tell you how I lay down on my sofa—this was last Friday—just to take a nap, and when I woke up I knew that I was going to die, and I died.”\n•\nSam has taken time off twice this month to go and visit his mother. He feels that she is settling in. “When she says that she has died she means died to the old New York life in order to pass into the new life at Three Trees.”\n“That’s what you think she means?” Bessie asks him.\n“What else could she mean?”\nBessie is silent a moment. She says, “Lotte has stopped calling me.”\n“I know,” Sam says. “She doesn’t call me, and she doesn’t return Diana’s calls.”\n“She doesn’t pick up her phone.”\n“I know,” Sam says.\n•\nBessie is pretty much stuck in Old Rockingham. Colin seems to be on the decline. Poor Bridget didn’t make it to the last ladies’ lunch, because she had one of her frequent debilitating headaches, but she wants to come along if Ruth and Farah figure out how to go and visit Lotte.\nThe idea to hitch a ride with Sam when he drives up to Three Trees gets screwed up because Lotte does not return Farah’s call. “And then I guess I forgot to call her,” Ruth says. “In any case, there wouldn’t have really been time to change my doctor’s appointment.”\n•\nHami has got his license and has driven his new secondhand car to his first semester at Purchase.\n•\nFarah and Bridget still mean to figure out some way to go up and see Lotte, maybe in the spring, when the weather is nicer. ♦",

        "writing_prompt": "In a dusty frontier town, the schoolmarm wins the saloon in a poker game, turning it into a schoolhouse and altar, much to the dismay of the unruly townsfolk. When they finally condemn her to hang for her \"city ways,\" she uses her final moments to deliver a lecture on time, justice, and the ineffable nature of rocks. What happens next?",
        "story": "The schoolmarm is playing poker in the town saloon. The stake is the saloon itself. As she is preparing to deal the cards, one of the men demands that she cut the fuckin’ deck, and she shoots him from her lap. “Sorry, but I simply cannot allow . . .”\nThe others tip their crumpled hats. “No, ma’am, you just go ahead and deal.”\nThe men of the town find the schoolmarm difficult but are awed by her refined and lofty character, and generally do what she tells them to do. The sheriff likes to say that she’s as pure as the spotless lily of the lake, though they have no lake, and there are no lilies in it. No damn lilies. The men cuss a lot—in fact, all the time—but never around the schoolmarm. Cussing doesn’t go together with the schoolmarm. It’s like salting your coffee, to put it politely.\nAfter winning the saloon in the poker hand, the schoolmarm has the deceased removed and turns the card tables into school desks. The bar becomes an altar on Sundays, but there’s no preacher, so the schoolmarm provides temperance lectures from it, which the men are obliged to attend. In their minds, it’s still the old bar, the old saloon, so they carry along hip flasks and beef jerky to ease themselves through the unholy tedium, belching and snorting noisily.\nThe men are also obliged to take spelling and counting lessons on weekdays, using the signs on the saloon walls and the playing cards with numbers on them as their schoolbooks. The men learn that there are two “t”s in “spitting,” for example, and, when they forget or when they ignore the sign’s admonition, they get their heads rapped with a wooden ruler. The schoolmarm also raps their heads for uncouth laughter, bad grammar, cigar smoking in class, and tardiness. This head-rapping hurts, and finally it’s too much for them. They form a jury and condemn the schoolmarm to be hanged for her cruel city ways.\nThe schoolmarm insists that they discuss it first at their weekly meeting of the Deep Thinkers Club. The men associate deep thinking with deep drinking, so they welcome the opportunity. They’ve been missing the old saloon since its unlucky conversion. They gather at their desks, as the schoolmarm calls them, feeling like they’ve come home again.\nThe schoolmarm says that today, her last day, she wants them to think about justice and time, how little there is of either, and also about irony, which somehow relates to the same circumstances. The schoolmarm’s just showing off again, making their brains ache, unrepentant criminal that she is. There is talk of getting on with the hanging, but the men are comfortable where they sit, sucking their teeth contentedly, so no one really wants to get up and go do it.\nThe sheriff, famous for his quick wit, says that time is what he never has enough of, but at least he’s got more than the schoolmarm has. He laughs at his own little joke. The men think about it for a while, and then they laugh, too. The schoolmarm says that that’s what she means by irony, and the sheriff says he’s glad she explained it, because he couldn’t figure out what the dang ironing had to do with anything. Neither could the others. They still can’t, but they hoot and slap their desks just the same. The sheriff’s a pal of theirs.\nOn the subject of justice, the sheriff considers himself something of an expert. He disagrees with the schoolmarm about there being little of it and reminds her that he himself has dealt out a potful. In deference to the schoolmarm, he doesn’t say what sort of pot it was, but the men grunt knowingly. The sheriff then provides a discourse on law and order, which he says are birds of a feather. Blue, he says when someone asks, like a jay’s. One of the men says he thought it was more yellowish, like a chicken hawk’s. The sheriff says it depends on the color of the law that was broken, and at what time of day or night order got criminally disordered. On that subject, he explains to the Deep Thinkers that he prefers order to ordure, though they are more or less the same thing, only because “order” is easier to spell and don’t sound so foreign.\n“Doesn’t sound so foreign,” the schoolmarm corrects.\n“Yes’m, that’s what I said,” the sheriff says. “I ain’t completely stupid.” The men applaud the sheriff’s incomplete stupidity.\nThen the schoolmarm delivers a lecture on eternity.

        "writing_prompt": "In a world where people can split themselves into two younger versions at any point in their lives, one woman refuses to split, defying societal norms. What happens when her choice begins to unravel the delicate balance of this strange society?",
        "story": "The first story Maya wrote was about a world in which people split themselves in two instead of reproducing. In that world, every person could, at any given moment, turn into two beings, each one half his/her age. Some chose to do this when they were young; for instance, an eighteen-year-old might split into two nine-year-olds. Others would wait until they’d established themselves professionally and financially and go for it only in middle age. The heroine of Maya’s story was splitless. She had reached the age of eighty and, despite constant social pressure, insisted on not splitting. At the end of the story, she died.\nIt was a good story, except for the ending. There was something depressing about that part, Aviad thought. Depressing and predictable. But Maya, in the writing workshop she had signed up for, actually got a lot of compliments on the ending. The instructor, who was supposed to be this well-known writer, even though Aviad had never heard of him, told her that there was something soul-piercing about the banality of the ending, or some other piece of crap. Aviad saw how happy that compliment made Maya. She was very excited when she told him about it. She recited what the writer had said to her the way people recite a verse from the Bible. And Aviad, who had originally tried to suggest a different ending, backpedalled and said that it was all a matter of taste and that he really didn’t understand much about it.\nIt had been her mother’s idea that she should go to a creative-writing workshop. She’d said that a friend’s daughter had attended one and enjoyed it very much. Aviad also thought that it would be good for Maya to get out more, to do something with herself. He could always bury himself in work, but, since the miscarriage, she never left the house. Whenever he came home, he found her in the living room, sitting up straight on the couch. Not reading, not watching TV, not even crying. When Maya hesitated about the course, Aviad knew how to persuade her. “Go once, give it a try,” he said, “the way a kid goes to day camp.” Later, he realized that it had been a little insensitive of him to use a child as an example, after what they’d been through two months before. But Maya actually smiled and said that day camp might be just what she needed.\nThe second story she wrote was about a world in which you could see only the people you loved. The protagonist was a married man in love with his wife. One day, his wife walked right into him in the hallway and the glass he was holding fell and shattered on the floor. A few days later, she sat down on him as he was dozing in an armchair. Both times, she wriggled out of it with an excuse: she’d had something else on her mind; she hadn’t been looking when she sat down. But the husband started to suspect that she didn’t love him anymore. To test his theory, he decided to do something drastic: he shaved off the left side of his mustache. He came home with half a mustache, clutching a bouquet of anemones. His wife thanked him for the flowers and smiled. He could sense her groping the air as she tried to give him a kiss. Maya called the story “Half a Mustache,” and told Aviad that when she’d read it aloud in the workshop some people had cried. Aviad said, “Wow,” and kissed her on the forehead. That night, they fought about some stupid little thing. She’d forgotten to pass on a message or something like that, and he yelled at her. He was to blame, and in the end he apologized. “I had a hellish day at work,” he said and stroked her leg, trying to make up for his outburst. “Do you forgive me?” She forgave him.\nThe workshop instructor had published a novel and a collection of short stories. Neither had been much of a success, but they’d had a few good reviews. At least, that’s what the saleswoman at a bookstore near Aviad’s office told him. The novel was very thick, six hundred and twenty-four pages. Aviad bought the book of short stories. He kept it in his desk and tried to read a little during lunch breaks. Each story in the collection took place in a different foreign country. It was a kind of gimmick. The blurb on the back cover said that the writer had worked for years as a tour guide in Cuba and Africa and that his travels had influenced his writing. There was also a small black-and-white photograph of him. In it, he had the kind of smug smile of someone who feels lucky to be who he is. The writer had told Maya, she said to Aviad, that when the workshop was over he’d send her stories to his editor. And, although she shouldn’t get her hopes up, publishers these days were desperate for new talent.\nHer third story started out funny. It was about a woman who gave birth to a cat. The hero of the story was the husband, who suspected that the cat wasn’t his. A fat ginger tomcat that slept on the lid of the dumpster right below the window of the couple’s bedroom gave the husband a condescending look every time he went downstairs to throw out the garbage. In the end, there was a violent clash between the husband and the cat. The husband threw a stone at the cat, which countered with bites and scratches. The injured husband, his wife, and the kitten she was breastfeeding went to the clinic for him to get a rabies shot. He was humiliated and in pain but tried not to cry while they were waiting. The kitten, sensing his suffering, uncurled itself from its mother’s embrace, went over to him, and licked his face tenderly, offering a consoling “Meow.” “Did you hear that?” the mother asked emotionally. “He said ‘Daddy.’ ” At that point, the husband could no longer hold back his tears. And, when Aviad read that passage, he had to try hard not to cry, too. Maya said that she’d started writing the story even before she knew she was pregnant again. “Isn’t it weird,” she asked, “how my brain didn’t know yet, but my subconscious did?”\nA Family Reckons with a Father’s Wish to Be Preserved Using Cryonics in “Eternal Father”\nThe next Tuesday, when Aviad was supposed to pick her up after the workshop, he arrived half an hour early, parked his car in the lot, and went to find her. Maya was surprised to see him in the classroom, and he insisted that she introduce him to the writer. The writer reeked of body lotion. He shook Aviad’s hand limply and told him that if Maya had chosen him for a husband he must be a very special person.\nThree weeks later, Aviad signed up for a beginners’ creative-writing class. He didn’t say anything about it to Maya, and, to be on the safe side, he told his secretary that if he had any calls from home she should say that he was in an important meeting and couldn’t be disturbed. The other members of the class were mostly elderly women, who gave him dirty looks. The thin young instructor wore a head scarf, and the women in the class gossiped about her, saying that she lived in a settlement in the occupied territories and had cancer. She asked everyone to do an exercise in automatic writing. “Write whatever comes into your head,” she said. “Don’t think, just write.” Aviad tried to stop thinking. It was very hard. The old women around him wrote with nervous speed, like students racing to finish an exam before the teacher tells them to put their pens down, and after a few minutes he began writing, too.\nThe story he wrote was about a fish that was swimming happily along in the sea when a wicked witch turned it into a man. The fish couldn’t come to terms with his transformation and decided to chase down the wicked witch and make her turn him back into a fish. Since he was an especially quick and enterprising fish, he managed to get married while he was pursuing her, and even to establish a small company that imported plastic products from the Far East. With the help of the enormous knowledge he had gained as a fish who had crossed the seven seas, the company began to thrive and even went public. Meanwhile, the wicked witch, who was a little tired after all her years of wickedness, decided to find all the people and creatures she’d cast spells on, apologize to them, and restore them to their natural state. At one point, she even went to see the fish she had turned into a man. The fish’s secretary asked her to wait until he’d finished a satellite meeting with his partners in Taiwan. At that stage in his life, the fish could hardly remember that he was in fact a fish, and his company now controlled half the world. The witch waited several hours, but when she saw that the meeting wouldn’t be ending any time soon she climbed onto her broom and flew off. The fish kept doing better and better, until one day, when he was really old, he looked out the window of one of the dozens of huge shoreline buildings he’d purchased in a smart real-estate deal, and saw the sea. And suddenly he remembered that he was a fish. A very rich fish who controlled many subsidiary companies that were traded on stock markets around the world, but still a fish. A fish who, for years, had not tasted the salt of the sea.\nWhen the instructor saw that Aviad had put down his pen, she gave him an inquiring look. “I don’t have an ending,” he whispered apologetically, keeping his voice down so as not to disturb the old ladies who were still writing. ♦",

Aviad saw how happy that compliment made Maya. She was very excited when she told him about it. She recited what the writer had said to her the way people recite a verse from the Bible. And Aviad, who had originally tried to suggest a different ending, backpedalled and said that it was all a matter of taste and that he really didn’t understand much about it.\nIt had been her mother’s idea that she should go to a creative-writing workshop. She’d said that a friend’s daughter had attended one and enjoyed it very much. Aviad also thought that it would be good for Maya to get out more, to do something with herself. He could always bury himself in work, but, since the miscarriage, she never left the house. Whenever he came home, he found her in the living room, sitting up straight on the couch. Not reading, not watching TV, not even crying. When Maya hesitated about the course, Aviad knew how to persuade her. “Go once, give it a try,” he said, “the way a kid goes to day camp.” Later, he realized that it had been a little insensitive of him to use a child as an example, after what they’d been through two months before. But Maya actually smiled and said that day camp might be just what she needed.\nThe second story she wrote was about a world in which you could see only the people you loved. The protagonist was a married man in love with his wife. One day, his wife walked right into him in the hallway and the glass he was holding fell and shattered on the floor. A few days later, she sat down on him as he was dozing in an armchair. Both times, she wriggled out of it with an excuse: she’d had something else on her mind; she hadn’t been looking when she sat down. But the husband started to suspect that she didn’t love him anymore. To test his theory, he decided to do something drastic: he shaved off the left side of his mustache. He came home with half a mustache, clutching a bouquet of anemones. His wife thanked him for the flowers and smiled. He could sense her groping the air as she tried to give him a kiss. Maya called the story “Half a Mustache,” and told Aviad that when she’d read it aloud in the workshop some people had cried. Aviad said, “Wow,” and kissed her on the forehead. That night, they fought about some stupid little thing. She’d forgotten to pass on a message or something like that, and he yelled at her. He was to blame, and in the end he apologized. “I had a hellish day at work,” he said and stroked her leg, trying to make up for his outburst. “Do you forgive me?” She forgave him.\nThe workshop instructor had published a novel and a collection of short stories. Neither had been much of a success, but they’d had a few good reviews. At least, that’s what the saleswoman at a bookstore near Aviad’s office told him. The novel was very thick, six hundred and twenty-four pages. Aviad bought the book of short stories. He kept it in his desk and tried to read a little during lunch breaks. Each story in the collection took place in a different foreign country. It was a kind of gimmick. The blurb on the back cover said that the writer had worked for years as a tour guide in Cuba and Africa and that his travels had influenced his writing. There was also a small black-and-white photograph of him. In it, he had the kind of smug smile of someone who feels lucky to be who he is. The writer had told Maya, she said to Aviad, that when the workshop was over he’d send her stories to his editor. And, although she shouldn’t get her hopes up, publishers these days were desperate for new talent.\nHer third story started out funny. It was about a woman who gave birth to a cat. The hero of the story was the husband, who suspected that the cat wasn’t his. A fat ginger tomcat that slept on the lid of the dumpster right below the window of the couple’s bedroom gave the husband a condescending look every time he went downstairs to throw out the garbage. In the end, there was a violent clash between the husband and the cat. The husband threw a stone at the cat, which countered with bites and scratches. The injured husband, his wife, and the kitten she was breastfeeding went to the clinic for him to get a rabies shot. He was humiliated and in pain but tried not to cry while they were waiting. The kitten, sensing his suffering, uncurled itself from its mother’s embrace, went over to him, and licked his face tenderly, offering a consoling “Meow.” “Did you hear that?” the mother asked emotionally. “He said ‘Daddy.’ ” At that point, the husband could no longer hold back his tears. And, when Aviad read that passage, he had to try hard not to cry, too. Maya said that she’d started writing the story even before she knew she was pregnant again. “Isn’t it weird,” she asked, “how my brain didn’t know yet, but my subconscious did?”\nA Family Reckons with a Father’s Wish to Be Preserved Using Cryonics in “Eternal Father”\nThe next Tuesday, when Aviad was supposed to pick her up after the workshop, he arrived half an hour early, parked his car in the lot, and went to find her. Maya was surprised to see him in the classroom, and he insisted that she introduce him to the writer. The writer reeked of body lotion. He shook Aviad’s hand limply and told him that if Maya had chosen him for a husband he must be a very special person.\nThree weeks later, Aviad signed up for a beginners’ creative-writing class. He didn’t say anything about it to Maya, and, to be on the safe side, he told his secretary that if he had any calls from home she should say that he was in an important meeting and couldn’t be disturbed. The other members of the class were mostly elderly women, who gave him dirty looks. The thin young instructor wore a head scarf, and the women in the class gossiped about her, saying that she lived in a settlement in the occupied territories and had cancer. She asked everyone to do an exercise in automatic writing. “Write whatever comes into your head,” she said. “Don’t think, just write.” Aviad tried to stop thinking. It was very hard. The old women around him wrote with nervous speed, like students racing to finish an exam before the teacher tells them to put their pens down, and after a few minutes he began writing, too.\nThe story he wrote was about a fish that was swimming happily along in the sea when a wicked witch turned it into a man. The fish couldn’t come to terms with his transformation and decided to chase down the wicked witch and make her turn him back into a fish. Since he was an especially quick and enterprising fish, he managed to get married while he was pursuing her, and even to establish a small company that imported plastic products from the Far East. With the help of the enormous knowledge he had gained as a fish who had crossed the seven seas, the company began to thrive and even went public. Meanwhile, the wicked witch, who was a little tired after all her years of wickedness, decided to find all the people and creatures she’d cast spells on, apologize to them, and restore them to their natural state. At one point, she even went to see the fish she had turned into a man. The fish’s secretary asked her to wait until he’d finished a satellite meeting with his partners in Taiwan. At that stage in his life, the fish could hardly remember that he was in fact a fish, and his company now controlled half the world. The witch waited several hours, but when she saw that the meeting wouldn’t be ending any time soon she climbed onto her broom and flew off. The fish kept doing better and better, until one day, when he was really old, he looked out the window of one of the dozens of huge shoreline buildings he’d purchased in a smart real-estate deal, and saw the sea. And suddenly he remembered that he was a fish. A very rich fish who controlled many subsidiary companies that were traded on stock markets around the world, but still a fish. A fish who, for years, had not tasted the salt of the sea.\nWhen the instructor saw that Aviad had put down his pen, she gave him an inquiring look. “I don’t have an ending,” he whispered apologetically, keeping his voice down so as not to disturb the old ladies who were still writing. ♦",

In that world, every person could, at any given moment, turn into two beings, each one half his/her age. Some chose to do this when they were young; for instance, an eighteen-year-old might split into two nine-year-olds. Others would wait until they’d established themselves professionally and financially and go for it only in middle age. The heroine of Maya’s story was splitless. She had reached the age of eighty and, despite constant social pressure, insisted on not splitting. At the end of the story, she died.\nIt was a good story, except for the ending.
