Earth's fate is sealed, all we can do now is slow down the degradation of the biosphere to buy time. Time to load the genes of as many organisms and the best of our technology onto one, large spacecraft.\nOf course, everyone wants to be on the Ark. To have a hope at not dying with our world, a fresh start on some distant world. A world which we could be the stewards of, and avoid recreating the horror unleashed on Earth. I made it to the second phase of the selection. Roughly one percent of the world's population has made it this far, but there is only room for thirty thousand on The Ark. I've got to try, and hope that I measure up enough to be one of the very few lucky ones.\nPhysical and cognitive tests. Personality inventories and brain scans. As many data points as can be gathered, looking for people who are exceptional in desirable ways, without other issues that might make them a danger to the mission. I go through it all, shaking with nerves. But then, the day comes. I open the email, and my face falls. I have been ruled out in the second phase. It provides no explanation for why, or what my shortcomings were. A simple, polite message informing me that I too will be dying with this planet.\nI cry for hours, but eventually the storm of emotions passes. I was always going to die, even if I made it on The Ark. My trajectory is decidedly less exciting, but the end point has not changed. What to do with myself with the time left?\nI was never one for hedonism, though there is a great deal of that going around. What could I do that would have meaning? I begin reading philosophy, particularly those in the past who have mused on death and what constitutes a life worth living.

His lack of frustration palpable even with the dead eyes.\nMatt did as expected and sat their child at the counter in an open chair.\n\"Thank you.\" He said as he adjusted himself slightly in the seat.\nHe noted their expressions at his arrival. \"Yes?\"\n\"It's the whole 'my son being inhuman' part.\" Holly explained to him, an arm under her chin. Zane glanced at Matt for confirmation. He was only met with an equally perplexed look.\n\"You must understand.\" He said in a solid tone. \"This is more complicated than you think.\"\n\"Take your time. We have all day.\"\n\"I was wondering when he'd kill us in our sleep actually.\"\n\"Matt.\"\n\"Honest statement since we're all being honest...\" Matt confirmed as he raised his hands in defeat.\n\"Father, I would never.\" Zane raised an eyebrow. \"Mother, I had no clue you imbibed such. It isn't healthy.\"\n\"I get that. But that's beside the point.\"\nShe shuffled the pack away from him. Not that he seemed interested. But still, the general gesture imprinted on her mind.\n\"This human form is in fact limiting.\" He frowned a little. \"But that's to be expected.\"\n\"As opposed to what?\" Holly asked him sternly. \"What is so limiting?\"\n\"I have another question,\" Matt added. \"Are we really your parents? Because we're both human.\"\nZane opened his mouth to speak. Then closed it. Then looked at Holly. Before side eyeing Matt. He looked back at Holly, then harder at Matt. Holly seemed to follow him and then began staring at Matt too.\n\"...Right?\" Matt reacted. \"Right??\"\n\"What are you?\" She asked first.\nZane raised a small hand. \"It's more of a question of what he did.\"\nMatt dropped his shoulders at this.\n\"Matt, what did you do?\"\n\"I don't know. Is he saying I'm not human?\"\nZane simply took a deep breath which seemed to almost inflate his little figure. \"So you don't know?\"\n\"That I was a normal person. I grew up and went to school like everyone else. Got married and got a job. Then had a baby.\" He rattled off. \"Yeah. I remember all of that.\"\n\"It's worse than I thought.\" Zane glanced.\n---\nHave to take a break here.\n\"Alright. None of this makes any sense.\" Holly said as she took another sip of her soda.\n\"Good.\" Zane admitted. \"It won't.\"\n\"What? What won't?\" Matt asked.\nZane reached over to his dad's arm. And crawled up it like a bug. Holly went to say something, but he already leaned into his father's ear. He said something, at least she thought it was. But it became clear he'd actually latched onto the ear. Her 3 year old child was gnawing on Matt's ear.\nAnd then it was over. Matt laid across the countertop, spasming, a trickle of blood leaving his ear canal. Zane standing over him. His face carrying a look as though he was more worried about his mother's frozen expression than the fact he'd apparently sent his father into a seizure.\n\"Matt?\" She began to move. \"Matt??\"\nMatt sat up.\nHolly stood up. The chair banging against the floor as she considered whether to run towards him, or away from both of them.\nHis eyes were black too now. Endless pits to seemingly nowhere.\nHolly, hands fumbling, snatched a cleaver from a drawer on her side. \"What'd you do to him?!\"\nShe danced on her toes slightly, gathering a better grip on the handle of the knife as she watched him finish some deep breaths.\nMatt spoke something to Zane. The pair conversing some impossible language to each other for a brief. Before he turned to face her.\n\"It's alright Holly.\" He finally explained. \"I'm just fine.\"\nHolly didn't believe him, she scooted to the far corner of the island. Pointing at the pair of them with the cleaver as if she could chop her way out of whatever nightmare she woke up to this morning.\n\"What'd you do to him?\" She repeated.\nShe realized she'd left her phone on their side of the table.\nZane slowly spoke, \"I gave him his body back.\"\n\"His body back.\" She followed carefully.\n\"Yes. My body back.\" Matt explained. \"It's... a bit uncomfortable. It always is.\"\n\"What are you?\"\nShe shook after asking that. The air in the room seemingly filled with static charge that made her hairs stand on edge.\n\"I'm still your husband. He's still your son.\"\nThere was movement as he swept the cleaver from her and let it clatter into the water and ashes at the bottom of the sink. The move so deliberate, it actually caused her to let it go on instinct. He hadn't left a mark, yet the power behind it made her shrink back.\n\"Are you familiar with the concept that there's a world beyond this one?\" He asked her.\nHe'd walked the few feet to her so quickly it took her a moment to catch up and register that he'd closed in.\n\"Like an, an afterlife?\" She blinked.\n\"Not for the dead.\" He answered. \"For the living.\"\n\"...I don't really understand.\"\n\"I told you it wouldn't make sense.\" Zane chided from over Matt's shoulder.\n\"The hell are you people?\" She fretted. \"Am I one of you?\"\n\"No. And that's another matter.\" Matt promised. \"But that's not the problem.\"\nShe sensed danger again.\n\"What's the problem then?\"\n\"Well, in due time, all becomes clear.\" He alluded. \"What'd that storybook say? 'Be not afraid'.\"\nThe fact he smiled at this chilled her to the bone. But with that, he blinked and his eyes were normal. Zane's eyes were also normal now, as he sat on the edge of the counter.\n\"But, worry about that later.\" Matt smiled.\nHe promptly walked over and one armed Zane to his shoulder without a care in the world. \"Wanna' go get ice cream?\"\nHolly stayed in place longer than they hoped. But eventually she gradually came over to the pair of them.\n\"Okay?\" She decided. \"Does ice cream help with your human form. Or something?\"\n\"No?\" Matt balked. \"I just really want some right now.\" The pair smirking as though all was right with the world.\n\"...Alright. Let's go get something to eat.\" She stopped. \"You might want to. Wipe the blood off.\"\n\"I did.\" He answered.\nAnd to her alarm, it was already gone.",

        "story": "Go figure the entire building would burn down. Not just one apartment. No. The whole building.\nBut all things considered, it could have been worse. He saved the wife. He saved the kids. He saved the dog. Job well done. And on top of that, everyone else in the building was also accounted for.\nIt was a tragedy. But it wasn't a complete disaster.\nAnd so, Hesher found himself taking calls out of a local hotel room. It wasn't the best place to have an office. But it was discreet and he had enough spare cash to rent out two rooms.\nOne for the family. One for business.\nExplaining why you came home covered in injuries and somebody's else blood isn't exactly a good way to kick off the holiday season. The fact that half his Intel from leads went up with the complex didn't help either.\nSo when a knock came at the door, for once, he assumed the mundane. Insurance had been in touch, along with several other legal entities after things like this occur.\n\"Hello?\" He asked as he opened the door.\nNobody was in the hall.\nHe reached at the back of his pants, hand at the ready. No one to the left. No one to the right. Normally, there was at least somebody walking around.\nThe idea came to quickly check the door of the room across the hall. His wife's. It was locked.\nSomething grabbed his arm. And something else wrapped his head. And then something breathed near his neck.\nHe was seated in a chair now. It was soft at least. His mind however went immediately to his family.\n\"Hesher.\" A familiar voice rose. \"I'm sorry. Let's begin from the top. Hesham Saeed. Born in 1990. Morocco. Casablanca, no less! Blood type, B+...\"\nSomeone ran a cold hand lightly across his neck. \"Here's looking at you kid.\"\nHe heard someone snap their fingers. \"Right, where are my manners? Someone take that off him?\"\nHe was greeted to a rather ornate office. A large and dark desk panned out. And behind it stood a rather familiar woman in a rather expensive dress.\n\"Salome.\" Hesham adjusted. \"Queen of the West.\"\n\"Not the full title. She toothily corrected. But, close enough.\"\nHe was all to familiar with her inner circle. They'd each battled back and forth with Hesher and many friends of his for the better part of his life. Not all of them made it out alive. And so the never ending feud continued.\n\"You can untie him.\" She directed. Her\\u00a0accent giving the words a rather light tone.\n\"I'm still alive. Why?\" He asked first.\n\"I already ate.\" She said.\nHe watched her retrieve a glass of wine. At least he assumed it was wine. A quick observation of the texture on the glass told him it definitely wasn't.\n\"Though, I do love a good A Negative from time to time. It reminds me of someone near and dear to my heart.\"\n\"You kidnapped me for a blood tasting?\"\n\"No, Hesher.\" Salome cleaned her teeth. \"I hear you're currently, what's the word mortals use for it? Homeless.\"\n\"And?\" Hesher urged on carefully.\n\"The world is very different from when I left it.\" She admitted. \"I understand exactly how harsh it can still be. Your family is in the room across the hall at that hotel, no?\"\n\"If you do anything-\" He spat.\n\"Fique tranquilo.\" She said, now at his right. A finger resting on his lips. He didn't know when she moved.\n\"If I wanted them dead. We'd be having a much more, personal talk, right now.\" She promised warmly. \"No. I want to gift you a home.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"A house. A domicile. A place to.\" She narrowed her eyes. \"Okay, you guys can bring them in.\"\n\"Wait! Wait...\" Hesher shouted.\n\"I kid. I kid.\" She assured. \"They are safe. You inadvertently helped my flock at one point.

However, the blood trailing off the keys of the register and the puddle on the floor below.\nHesham did the right thing and checked his gloves. Then locked the door and switched the sign over to 'Closed'.\nThings started off odd. The puddle turned into a drip pattern. It was a bit old, but it was still drying. It led behind the booth towards another door. The stock room, was a different story. A bigger smear on a wall gradually fading orange on its way to brown.\nAnd more drip pattern. He followed it down the shelves. Until it disappeared. He walked towards the rear exit. Then went back and cleared the store again.\nThen he noted the small trace on the edge of the box. Moving that, he noticed how the shelving loosened. He moved the two next to that one and saw more blood on the plywood.\nUnderneath the lowest shelf was a door. They said there was one.

        "story": "“Ok. Relax. This doesn’t mean I’m death. Maybe someone just glued my robes on? I’ll take a quick look under my hood and see that everything’s as normal as it should be.” I said, raising my hood, only to see a skull staring back at me in my bathroom mirror. “What the hell, I’m death?” My skeletal hands pressed against my skull, digging into my eye sockets. “Wait, how come I can still see? That doesn’t make any sense.”\nSomehow that made this less strange, that weird realization that I could still see dulling the fact that I had become death, the reaper of souls. If anything, the longer I thought about it, the more I relaxed. “Guess it’s better than my crazy frog costume last year. At least my little tadpoles aren’t bouncing around this time.” I murmured, making sure I still had my pants on under these robes.\n“So, how long will this last? A day? A week? Usually, I had to perform some act in my costume to release the spell. Like that cover of who let the dogs out I did last year. Man, that crazy frog period was weird.” I went and made myself a cup of coffee, realizing I only had myself to blame for this. “Why did I think this year would be any different? This is the fourth time its happened. I should have been Mario, like I originally planned. At least I would have met a princess then.”\nBringing the coffee to my mouth, I took a sip, feeling it ooze down my throat before splashing onto the kitchen tiles. “WHAT? So, I can see but I can’t taste and drink? How does any of this work? Do I have a body? Do I not have a body? These are some sloppy magic rules.” I said, arguing with the essence of strange happenings, as if a fairy or plot device would appear to explain why this was the case. Unfortunately, no help arrived, leaving me to muddle my way through this, like always.\nI sluggishly dragged my robe along the tiles of the kitchen floor, moping it with my clothing. Without my morning coffee, I didn’t have the energy to give it a proper cleanup, making a half assed attempt. “Guess I’ll collect some souls then.”\nWhere to find souls? That was the question. Graveyards? Retirement homes? After giving it some thought, I decided that the retirement home would be the better option, as the people in the graveyards had probably already moved on to the afterlife. As I stepped outside, no one batted an eye, most people passing through me, not even noticing my presence. Only giving a small shiver as I stepped past them. As I made it to the end of the street, I heard a voice.\n“Still wearing your costume, dear?” Old lady Jill asked, giving me a friendly wave from her porch.\n“Oh, yeah. It’s a long story.” I would have smiled if I still had lips, only giving her a friendly tip of my hood before pausing. “Wait? You can see me.”\n“Yes, dear. Should I not be able to see you?”\n“Um.” This was awkward. Honestly, I think I would have preferred the crazy frog costume over this. At least that didn’t involve dragging a nice old lady to the afterlife. Even if it may have caused her to die of shock. “I think you may be dead.”\nShe glanced down at herself, pushing her glasses up her nose to get a better look at her ethereal body. “I am? Oh, sorry, I didn’t mean to haunt you, dear. I’ll head back inside. You have a lovely day.” She gave me a sincere apology, waddling back to her door as I trailed behind her.\n“You don’t need to apologize. I’m death. Well, I’m filling in for death. When I put on a costume, I become the person it’s based on.”\n“And you still keep dressing up?” She asked, making me again realize how stupid I was.\n“I never learn. Anyway, I would be honored to take you to the afterlife. I’m still new to this, but I think I could muddle my way through it. How hard can it be?” I stared up at the heavens and raised my arms, the sleeves rolling down, giving me a cinematic look. “DEADETH GO UPPIES.”\nJill looked up at the sky, then at me. “I don’t think that worked, dear. It looked very good, though.”\n“Thanks.” I was out of ideas, expecting it to be the first thing I tried. What now? “From whence you came, you shall remain. Until you are, complete again.” Again, nothing. “Have you got any ideas? Do you feel floaty or anything?”\nJill opened her mouth, as if the soul would simply pop free and ascend to the heavens. While I thought it was a stupid idea, it still made a lot more sense than anything I had tried, which said a lot about my plans. “I’m not sure, dear. I thought it would come out on its own.”\n“Hm. What if I just,” I placed my hand on her cheek, only for her mouth to pop open, and a blue light to appear in her throat. As the light appeared, she let out a squeal, eyes rolling back as her body vanished, leaving only a small blue orb.\nI remained frozen after that, silently processing the traumatic scene I had seen. Finally, I screamed. “I THOUGHT I KILLED HER. WHY DID HER EYES ROLL BACK LIKE THAT? EW, THAT WAS SO SCARY.” I juggled her soul between my hands until I felt comfortable enough to hold it. “Wow, her soul’s light. Guess that means she was a good person. Alright, let’s send you to heaven.”\nI tossed her soul skyward, only for it to come back down, crashing towards the Earth. “Crap.” I jumped, catching it before it went through the ground, nearly accidentally sending her either to hell or to the core of the Earth. “Ok, so don’t throw the soul. Um, maybe I tell her where to go? Go to heaven, good girl, go home.” I said, imagining I was talking to a dog.\nWeirdly enough, that worked. The soul fluttering from my palm, heading into the sky before vanishing. As it left, my robes dissolved, leaving me standing on her porch. The rush of satisfaction I got from a job well done was quickly destroyed when I realized I was now standing outside a recently deceased person’s home. With that knowledge in mind, I went home, only to get knocked over on the sidewalk.\n“WATCH WHERE YOU’RE STANDING.” The jogger huffed, not even taking their headphones off to hear any potential reply, continuing on their way. I picked myself up and dusted off my pants. “Ok, no more dressing up next year.” That was the last time. Although, it would be a kind of funny if I dressed up as the hamburglar…",

Man, that crazy frog period was weird.” I went and made myself a cup of coffee, realizing I only had myself to blame for this. “Why did I think this year would be any different? This is the fourth time its happened. I should have been Mario, like I originally planned. At least I would have met a princess then.”\nBringing the coffee to my mouth, I took a sip, feeling it ooze down my throat before splashing onto the kitchen tiles. “WHAT? So, I can see but I can’t taste and drink? How does any of this work? Do I have a body? Do I not have a body? These are some sloppy magic rules.” I said, arguing with the essence of strange happenings, as if a fairy or plot device would appear to explain why this was the case. Unfortunately, no help arrived, leaving me to muddle my way through this, like always.\nI sluggishly dragged my robe along the tiles of the kitchen floor, moping it with my clothing. Without my morning coffee, I didn’t have the energy to give it a proper cleanup, making a half assed attempt. “Guess I’ll collect some souls then.”\nWhere to find souls? That was the question. Graveyards? Retirement homes? After giving it some thought, I decided that the retirement home would be the better option, as the people in the graveyards had probably already moved on to the afterlife. As I stepped outside, no one batted an eye, most people passing through me, not even noticing my presence. Only giving a small shiver as I stepped past them. As I made it to the end of the street, I heard a voice.\n“Still wearing your costume, dear?” Old lady Jill asked, giving me a friendly wave from her porch.\n“Oh, yeah. It’s a long story.” I would have smiled if I still had lips, only giving her a friendly tip of my hood before pausing. “Wait? You can see me.”\n“Yes, dear. Should I not be able to see you?”\n“Um.” This was awkward. Honestly, I think I would have preferred the crazy frog costume over this. At least that didn’t involve dragging a nice old lady to the afterlife. Even if it may have caused her to die of shock. “I think you may be dead.”\nShe glanced down at herself, pushing her glasses up her nose to get a better look at her ethereal body. “I am? Oh, sorry, I didn’t mean to haunt you, dear. I’ll head back inside. You have a lovely day.” She gave me a sincere apology, waddling back to her door as I trailed behind her.\n“You don’t need to apologize. I’m death. Well, I’m filling in for death. When I put on a costume, I become the person it’s based on.”\n“And you still keep dressing up?” She asked, making me again realize how stupid I was.\n“I never learn. Anyway, I would be honored to take you to the afterlife. I’m still new to this, but I think I could muddle my way through it. How hard can it be?” I stared up at the heavens and raised my arms, the sleeves rolling down, giving me a cinematic look. “DEADETH GO UPPIES.”\nJill looked up at the sky, then at me. “I don’t think that worked, dear. It looked very good, though.”\n“Thanks.” I was out of ideas, expecting it to be the first thing I tried. What now? “From whence you came, you shall remain. Until you are, complete again.” Again, nothing. “Have you got any ideas? Do you feel floaty or anything?”\nJill opened her mouth, as if the soul would simply pop free and ascend to the heavens. While I thought it was a stupid idea, it still made a lot more sense than anything I had tried, which said a lot about my plans. “I’m not sure, dear. I thought it would come out on its own.”\n“Hm. What if I just,” I placed my hand on her cheek, only for her mouth to pop open, and a blue light to appear in her throat. As the light appeared, she let out a squeal, eyes rolling back as her body vanished, leaving only a small blue orb.\nI remained frozen after that, silently processing the traumatic scene I had seen. Finally, I screamed. “I THOUGHT I KILLED HER. WHY DID HER EYES ROLL BACK LIKE THAT? EW, THAT WAS SO SCARY.” I juggled her soul between my hands until I felt comfortable enough to hold it. “Wow, her soul’s light. Guess that means she was a good person. Alright, let’s send you to heaven.”\nI tossed her soul skyward, only for it to come back down, crashing towards the Earth. “Crap.” I jumped, catching it before it went through the ground, nearly accidentally sending her either to hell or to the core of the Earth. “Ok, so don’t throw the soul. Um, maybe I tell her where to go? Go to heaven, good girl, go home.” I said, imagining I was talking to a dog.\nWeirdly enough, that worked. The soul fluttering from my palm, heading into the sky before vanishing. As it left, my robes dissolved, leaving me standing on her porch. The rush of satisfaction I got from a job well done was quickly destroyed when I realized I was now standing outside a recently deceased person’s home. With that knowledge in mind, I went home, only to get knocked over on the sidewalk.\n“WATCH WHERE YOU’RE STANDING.” The jogger huffed, not even taking their headphones off to hear any potential reply, continuing on their way. I picked myself up and dusted off my pants. “Ok, no more dressing up next year.” That was the last time. Although, it would be a kind of funny if I dressed up as the hamburglar…",

It looked very good, though.”\n“Thanks.” I was out of ideas, expecting it to be the first thing I tried. What now? “From whence you came, you shall remain. Until you are, complete again.” Again, nothing. “Have you got any ideas? Do you feel floaty or anything?”\nJill opened her mouth, as if the soul would simply pop free and ascend to the heavens. While I thought it was a stupid idea, it still made a lot more sense than anything I had tried, which said a lot about my plans. “I’m not sure, dear. I thought it would come out on its own.”\n“Hm. What if I just,” I placed my hand on her cheek, only for her mouth to pop open, and a blue light to appear in her throat. As the light appeared, she let out a squeal, eyes rolling back as her body vanished, leaving only a small blue orb.\nI remained frozen after that, silently processing the traumatic scene I had seen. Finally, I screamed. “I THOUGHT I KILLED HER. WHY DID HER EYES ROLL BACK LIKE THAT? EW, THAT WAS SO SCARY.” I juggled her soul between my hands until I felt comfortable enough to hold it. “Wow, her soul’s light. Guess that means she was a good person. Alright, let’s send you to heaven.”\nI tossed her soul skyward, only for it to come back down, crashing towards the Earth. “Crap.” I jumped, catching it before it went through the ground, nearly accidentally sending her either to hell or to the core of the Earth. “Ok, so don’t throw the soul. Um, maybe I tell her where to go? Go to heaven, good girl, go home.” I said, imagining I was talking to a dog.\nWeirdly enough, that worked. The soul fluttering from my palm, heading into the sky before vanishing. As it left, my robes dissolved, leaving me standing on her porch. The rush of satisfaction I got from a job well done was quickly destroyed when I realized I was now standing outside a recently deceased person’s home. With that knowledge in mind, I went home, only to get knocked over on the sidewalk.\n“WATCH WHERE YOU’RE STANDING.” The jogger huffed, not even taking their headphones off to hear any potential reply, continuing on their way. I picked myself up and dusted off my pants. “Ok, no more dressing up next year.” That was the last time. Although, it would be a kind of funny if I dressed up as the hamburglar…",

        "story": "“Ok, so can you let go of my hand now?” Jeremy asked, feeling the mimics stiff tongue flicking against his elbow, touching it in ways that no elbow should ever be touched. When the mimic finally spat out his hand, Jeremy fell back, grimacing at the sight of the bright blue saliva that was dribbling down his arm, staining the stone dungeon floor below.\n“There. Next time will you think before you shove your hand into someone’s mouth?” The treasure chest’s lid flapped, acting like it was possessed by demonic magic. The golden chest was a sight that promised legendary treasures, having a wooden exterior with gold metal plating that lined its edges and front. Even knowing it was a mimic, Jeremy struggled to resist diving into it again, all his instincts as an adventurer telling him it had rare loot.\nJeremy dragged his hand against the side of his pants, trying to clean off as much mimic saliva as he could, before inspecting the chest. Small pin sized eyes near the keyhole of the chest, the way it twitched as if it were drawing breath. Without his treasure hungry trance, it was obvious this wasn’t a real chest. Though, most adventurers never took the time to check out a chest, too busy searching for loot to bother with such a thing.\n“I’m sorry, but you’re a mimic, right? If you don’t want someone touching you, why don’t you transform into a chair or something? That seems easier.” Jeremy suggested, feeling this wasn’t entirely his fault. A treasure chest in a dungeon wasn’t the sort of thing that screamed, don’t touch me.\n“I’m not some freak that wants people sitting on them! I would rather have a hundred hands shoved into my mouth than an orc trying to use me as a stool.” The chest huffed, and when they said it like that, Jeremy had to agree with them.\nJeremy tapped at his chin, thinking about other items the mimic could control. Not wanting to waste too much time going over the options, he quickly fired a few off.\n“A lamp.”\n“Too many people will try to blow me out.”\n“A statue?”\n“Too many people will start climbing all over me.”\n“A human?”\n“Ew.”\n“What do you mean, ew?” Jeremy said, offended by the monster’s ew. He wasn’t the one that just slobbered over someone’s arm. “Fine, stay a treasure chest. I hope someone tries to lock pick you.” Jeremy collected his bag from the dungeon floor and threw it over his shoulder. “Well, if you’ve got no treasure to offer me, then I’ll be on my way.”\n“Wait. Do you really think the human disguise could work?” It asked, considering the idea. The mimic’s body dissolved into a pile of goo, pooling by the adventurers’ feet before suddenly bursting up from the floor, bouncing to a human sized figure, one that slowly gained its features before him.\nThe mimics new form now towering over Jeremy, staring down at him with its expressionless face. They were as strange as a person could be. Eyes devoid of any color, skin having an eerie blue tint and long silver hair that fell to the shoulders of the robe they were wearing .\nJeremy didn’t know what to think of the form. It looked human-ish? Like a body that belonged to a mage or some other mana filled person. However, it didn’t look normal, not the type of body you wouldn’t notice if you passed it on the street. “It’s a little unique.” Jeremy said, trying to be nice.\n“You hate it.”\n“I don’t hate it. I just wouldn’t trust that man if I passed them on the street. I would expect them to curse me or something. You need to think of something simpler. Close your eyes and imagine the most generic adventurer you can think of.”\nThe mimic transformed into Jeremy, opening its eyes. “How’s this then?” It asked, swirling on the spot, giving Jeremy a look at his own body, something that was more unsettling than he expected it to be.\n“I’m not generic! I’m unique for a human. Look at my scar.” Jeremy said, lifting his shirt, showing off the small scar he had gotten from poking himself with a knife while drunkenly preparing a meal. “See, a scar means I’m unique.”\nThe mimic leaned in closer, as if he were about to give Jeremy’s stomach raspberries. “Ah, so you do. I’ll correct that.” The mimic retreated and raised its shirt, showing off the same scar. “There, now I should be able to walk around without being bothered.”\n“You can’t be me. I’m me.” Jeremy sighed, scratching his head. “Look, just go back to being a chest, ok? That’s the safest option. I’ll even put up a sign that says mimics are living creatures. Although, most adventurers can’t read.” He admitted. When the mimic changed back into a chest, Jeremy went to the doorway of the treasure room, getting out a piece of cloth from his bag. It would be a crude sign, but a sign nonetheless.\nAs he went to hang the cloth up, the weak entrance of the treasure room crumbled. The collapsing stones, threatening to come down on Jeremy’s head. With a quick pivot, Jeremy got himself out of the way, helplessly watching as the treasure room entrance sealed, leaving the mimic inside. “Crap, I’m sorry. I didn’t realize how weak it was. I’ll dig you out.”\n“NO. This is perfect. No more adventurers, no more monsters, just a quiet room.” The mimic sighed, able to relax now that they wouldn’t have to deal with any threats. It wasn’t like they needed to eat that much, either. Able to survive on the moss and moisture that appeared in the room. “Thank you, adventurer. For this gift.”\n“Oh, you’re welcome. I guess?”\n“If you want some treasure, check behind the statue near the entrance. I heard a thief mention they keep a stash there.”\n“Will do.” As he left the dungeon, he found the stash the mimic had been referring to. An assortment of beautiful gems all bunched tightly together in a leather sack. Taking the sack, he headed for his village, considering that a successful trip.",

        "story": "“Complications arose during the march, sir. While it is merely a castle on the hill. One that is barely a breadcrumb compared to your grand castle and balcony. It is still a steep hill to climb.” Marcus said, kneeling with his clenched fist pushed against his chest plate. The flame emblem of the Revilion Empire resting beneath his fist, as if he was trying to extinguish it with his hand.\nKing Salas peered at the castle, having to squint to make out its inferior walls and grace. Unlike his castle that loomed over the city like a stone dragon, the castle of Lord Grethon sat high above it like a Gray Catbird, curiously watching the dragon from a safe perching branch. Though, that safe hill now had soldiers ascending it, like hungry cats climbing up to snatch the prey that remained up above.\n“Complications? Explain.” Salas didn’t turn to face his commanding knight, too busy staring at the eyesore that silently mocked him. The king’s wrinkly hand running through his gray beard, trying to untangle some hairs that had intertwined.\nMarcus didn’t stand. Even if the king refused to look his way, he didn’t move. Not wanting to risk facing the man’s wrath. “The horses got spooked. The height caused a few of them to panic, sending the others into a frenzy. We also had issues trying to find the perfect point to ascend from. We feared the pathways Lord-“\n“He is no lord anymore.” The king interjected, his hoarse voice having a not-so-subtle hint of frustration as he listened to his knight.\n“Ah, how right you are, my grace. We feared the pathways that traitor Grethon created would be occupied by his treacherous knights that used to serve under your command. To avoid a disadvantage in battle, we explored alternative routes.”\nThe king turned, acknowledging his knight for the first time since he had knelt. The kings worn white robes now having splotches of dirt and grime, not the former pure white they once were. “If I don’t hear any good news, Marcus. Then I’ll be forced to suspect you of sabotaging the mission. These are mistakes a new commander would make, not a seasoned one. Where is my good news, Marcus?” The king didn’t need to threaten Marcus directly, making it obvious what would happen if he didn’t hear something positive soon.\nMarcus tensed, staring at the king’s feet. “Grethon is alone. He has not fled the castle and the soldiers in his command have thrown down their arms and agreed to rejoin our army. We have him surrounded. His death will come shortly.”\nSalas smirked, those dry lips at risk of chipping as he performed the action for the first time in years. “Very well. We shall have his head soon, then?” Salas asked, turning back to his window.\n“A day or two, depending on how long it takes our men to return. Should I execute him before our men bring him into the city? Have his dead body paraded through the streets on his return?” Marcus offered, knowing the king would never accept the proposition. Not when the sweet allure of a more personal revenge was available.\nSalas entertained the thought of making a spectacle out of this, only to shake his head. “His death will come at my hand. The other lords need to know what happens when you steal from the king. The people pay to live on my land. How dare he try to undermine my rule?”\nMarcus closed his eyes, giving a nod of approval. “The other lords will fall in line, sir. They know better than to question your might. May I leave my king? Preparations are needed for Grethon’s arrival.”\n“Yes, go ahead. Leave and don’t return until you have Grethon with you. I want you to help me with the arrangements before his execution. We won’t make it quick for him.” Salas chuckled, the dry laugh coming out as if he were spitting out clumps of dust.\nMarcus took his leave, wondering when the king had become like this. Had Salas always been this wicked, and he never noticed because of his loyalty? Or had the king’s heart changed after the death of the queen? He hoped it was the first, not wanting to feel any sympathy for the man they planned to kill.\nEveryone knew Grethon had committed no actual crime. He had paid the king his gold in full. But he had done so with money from his own pockets. The struggles of the last winter had been harsh on the farming lands below Grethon’s hill, and since the people he looked over couldn’t afford to pay the taxes, Grethon covered the expenses. Telling them to pay what they could during this harsh period and he would make up the rest.\nA selfless act that the king took offense to. The king saw this as teaching bad manners, similar to a parent covering for a child’s mistakes, forcing bad habits. What would happen if other commoners started expecting the same from their lords? It would be chaos. When Marcus first came to Salas and told him the commoners in his city were asking for lower taxes during this troubling time, he knew he had to make an example out of Grethon.\nThough, what he didn’t expect was the other lords to conspire against him. The king was old, weak, and showing signs of taking the kingdom to the grave with him. Today it would be Grethon and the next it would be them. Which is why they planned to kill the king, using the distraction of Grethon to mount their attack.\nThat was why Grethon’s men surrendered so quickly. That day wasted with supposed spooked horses was a day filled with scheming and negotiations.

Mr Holmes laid with his head pillowed on his partner’s belly and his long legs crossed, one foot braced on the armrest, reading a book regarding the various critters found in the seas and oceans while Dr Watson amused himself by reading The Lancet and caressing with a casual touch his husband’s now longer, soft greying hair.\nAs Mr Sherlock Holmes let the book fall on his chest still open and stretched, slightly lifting his body leaning on his shoulders and foot and moaning softly, Dr Watson chuckled, bringing his hand lower to caress his high cheekbone. “Has the great Sherlock Holmes tired of the creatures of the oceans?” He asked playfully.\nHolmes moaned again, angling his head to look his partner in the eye. “Not yet. – He grinned. – Not until you will accompany me for a swim in mornings.”\nBoth men laughed as the doctor assured his detective to be very much of a dry land creature.\n“Yet you are so pretty when you swim, so at ease…” Admired the detective, capturing his husband’s hand to press a kiss on its back.\n“You old flatterer. – Admonished Watson playfully, kissing Holmes’ hand as well. – Food for thoughts?”\nHolmes’ often severe features were brightened by an impish grin. “You perhaps mean ‘case for thoughts’, dear fellow. – He joked. – I’m thinking… of Oysters.” He smirked.\nWatson huffed. “Really Holmes, not Oysters again, I beg of you.”\nTickled by his partner’s slight annoyance the detective smirked and continued, a playful smile on his thin lips. “But consider!

No, no, Watson, I’m considering how the layers of Mother of Pearl can cover basically anything!” Continued Holmes, enthusiastically.\nDr Watson smiled and rolled up his paper to playfully tap his husband head. “Are you going to claim merits as a housekeeper over getting oysters for dinner again, my love?” He smiled, a hand already trailing down his husband’s side.\nOnce he had arrived at the level of his waist, Holmes squeaked and jumped up to perch himself on the couch’s armrest. “Those are forbidden tactics!” He laughed.\nThe doctor grinned back. “Just as oysters are a banned topic!”\nHolmes’ grin widened. “But imagine! A whole bed of oysters! Anything could get trapped by their valves! Too slow!” He grinned, jumping out of the couch and on Watson’s armchair to escape the playful swat with the rolled up paper!\n“Come down here you eel!” Laughed the doctor.\n“Anything! Maybe so many oysters could cover a the whole floor in mother of pearl! Slow, John, slow!” Grinned the detective after jumping from the armchair back to the couch and from that to his own armchair.\nWatson grinned again. “I’m not putting any effort in this, dear husband! – He warned, then gasped as he saw his man climbing on the armchair’s backrest and perching himself there. – You’re a damn squirrel!”\n“From fish to mammal, interesting transition! – He laughed. – Imagine, a fish mistakenly entering an oyste-”\nAs Holmes talked, his balance faltered and he fell back on the floor, right into his husband’s arms.\n“Yes, my dear cat? A fish swimming into an oyster?” Breathed the doctor right into his ear, a laugh in his voice.\n“He would get trapped, my love. Trapped in Mother of Pearl, fated to die and be embedded in that beautiful substance.”\nDr Watson laughed, squeezing his Holmes tight. “And this, my dear fish, is what happens to fishes who think themselves oh so clever.” He murmured, his mouth moving on what was visible of his husband’s neck to leave small kisses, his hands finding the hem of his wool vest and slipping inside it, working to tease his shirt out of his trousers.\n“And what would that be, my delicious bear?” Grinned the detective, basking in his husband’s kisses and melting in his strong hold.\nWatson smiled against his Holmes’ neck and put there yet another kiss, careful not to leave any mark, and then as his hands finally managed to slip under his shirt. “The punishment for talking of oysters, my sleuth hound.” He grinned planting his fingers in the most ticklish spot of his husband’s slim sides.\nHolmes squeaked, curling on himself in the useless attempt to escape Watson’s vice-like hold. “Joooohn! John please!” He yelped between laughter.\nThe doctor laughed together with him, holding him up in position, almost lifting him from the ground. “Oh my dear, dear Sherlock. – He grinned, flexing his fingers and delighting in his husband’s yowls of laughter. – You knew of the consequences, my love!”",

Slow, John, slow!” Grinned the detective after jumping from the armchair back to the couch and from that to his own armchair.\nWatson grinned again. “I’m not putting any effort in this, dear husband! – He warned, then gasped as he saw his man climbing on the armchair’s backrest and perching himself there. – You’re a damn squirrel!”\n“From fish to mammal, interesting transition! – He laughed. – Imagine, a fish mistakenly entering an oyste-”\nAs Holmes talked, his balance faltered and he fell back on the floor, right into his husband’s arms.\n“Yes, my dear cat? A fish swimming into an oyster?” Breathed the doctor right into his ear, a laugh in his voice.\n“He would get trapped, my love. Trapped in Mother of Pearl, fated to die and be embedded in that beautiful substance.”\nDr Watson laughed, squeezing his Holmes tight. “And this, my dear fish, is what happens to fishes who think themselves oh so clever.” He murmured, his mouth moving on what was visible of his husband’s neck to leave small kisses, his hands finding the hem of his wool vest and slipping inside it, working to tease his shirt out of his trousers.\n“And what would that be, my delicious bear?” Grinned the detective, basking in his husband’s kisses and melting in his strong hold.\nWatson smiled against his Holmes’ neck and put there yet another kiss, careful not to leave any mark, and then as his hands finally managed to slip under his shirt. “The punishment for talking of oysters, my sleuth hound.” He grinned planting his fingers in the most ticklish spot of his husband’s slim sides.\nHolmes squeaked, curling on himself in the useless attempt to escape Watson’s vice-like hold. “Joooohn! John please!” He yelped between laughter.\nThe doctor laughed together with him, holding him up in position, almost lifting him from the ground. “Oh my dear, dear Sherlock. – He grinned, flexing his fingers and delighting in his husband’s yowls of laughter. – You knew of the consequences, my love!”",

No, no, Watson, I’m considering how the layers of Mother of Pearl can cover basically anything!” Continued Holmes, enthusiastically.\nDr Watson smiled and rolled up his paper to playfully tap his husband head. “Are you going to claim merits as a housekeeper over getting oysters for dinner again, my love?” He smiled, a hand already trailing down his husband’s side.\nOnce he had arrived at the level of his waist, Holmes squeaked and jumped up to perch himself on the couch’s armrest. “Those are forbidden tactics!” He laughed.\nThe doctor grinned back. “Just as oysters are a banned topic!”\nHolmes’ grin widened. “But imagine!

        "story": "Annatar stood motionless in the center of their chambers, his sharp eyes fixed on Celebrimbor as the elf moved with careful precision. The Lord of Eregion, ever the artisan, fussed over him with an artist’s devotion. His deft hands worked as though Annatar were the finest creation Celebrimbor had ever crafted.\nThe robe that Celebrimbor had chosen for him was white, the purest shade of ivory, embroidered with intricate gold thread that shimmered with every shift of light. The golden patterns traced delicate paths along the sleeves, cuffs, and collar - patterns that Celebrimbor had designed specifically for him. It felt like being cloaked in sunlight, radiant and resplendent. The stark contrast of white and gold against his skin was deliberate, no doubt. Celebrimbor’s vision of him, made manifest.\nCelebrimbor knelt in front of him, adjusting the robe, pulling the fabric tight before stepping back to admire his work.\n“Beautiful,” he murmured as he took Annatar’s hand, slowly sliding a golden ring onto his finger - one he had forged himself, as always. Annatar’s gaze shifted downward, watching those gentle, reverent hands as they moved to adorn him with the finest of Celebrimbor’s jewellery.\nMore golden rings, each delicate yet powerful, slipped onto his fingers, their metal cool at first, then warming against his skin. Bracelets followed, the slight clink of metal-on-metal filling the room as they rested perfectly around his wrists.\nCelebrimbor’s fingers grazed his skin as he adjusted each piece of jewellery with meticulous care, tracing the lines of his palm, before he lifted his hands to his lips. A soft kiss, reverent - his face alight with the quiet satisfaction of a craftsman. He wasn’t just dressing Annatar. No, to him, this was something more profound - an act of adoration. “So beautiful, so pure,” Celebrimbor murmured, almost absentmindedly as if it were a fact, not an observation.\nAnnatar almost flinched, but he schooled his features into a soft smile instead, letting Celebrimbor’s words wash over him.\nPure.\nCelebrimbor said it with such certainty, with such love, that Annatar felt a painful pang in his chest.\nCelebrimbor’s eyes, those eyes full of love and admiration, gazed upon him as though he were some sacred being. A being of light and goodness.\nHe wanted to believe it. He wanted to believe for just a moment that he\nwas\nthe being Celebrimbor saw - a radiant Maia of golden light, of beauty, of creation. But beneath the layers of fabric and gentle touches lay the truth that neither of them could escape. Mairon was long gone, twisted into something darker, something more ruthless. Annatar, this beautiful façade, was nothing more than a vessel for his plans.\nBut Celebrimbor - Celebrimbor saw none of that. His grey eyes were soft with affection as he lifted another piece of jewellery, a golden bracelet, and fastened it around Annatar’s wrist. His hands were steady, as though every movement was part of some sacred ritual. It almost felt like worship, the way Celebrimbor handled him. As if Annatar were something holy, something worthy of reverence.\nAnd Annatar, in his weakness, found himself craving more of it.\n“Tyelpe,” he said softly, his voice steady yet touched by something unspoken. “You flatter me too much.”\n“Not enough, I think,” Celebrimbor replied with a small smile, stepping behind him now, his fingers combing carefully through Annatar’s golden hair, untangling each strand. It was a tenderness that caught Annatar off guard, even now. He felt the reverence in every movement, the soft hum of concentration that always accompanied Celebrimbor when he was working on something precious.\nAnd Annatar - Sauron, Mairon, a dark lord hiding in plain sight -\nfelt\nprecious under those hands.\nIt was a ridiculous notion, of course. How could he, who had once sworn himself to Melkor, feel anything other than the heavy burden of his own betrayal, the weight of his corrupted power? But here, in Celebrimbor’s presence, in the Lord of Eregion’s deft, tender care, Annatar almost forgot.\nAlmost.\n“Hold still,” Celebrimbor murmured, his voice soft with affection. He carefully smoothed the final strands of Annatar’s hair into place, his fingers lingering for just a moment longer than necessary, as if savoring the feeling of his golden locks on his fingers.\nAnnatar closed his eyes for a brief moment, allowing himself the luxury of leaning into Celebrimbor’s touch. For this one moment, he could be Mairon again, the Maia of Aulë, the one who crafted wonders of fire, metal and gemstone. In this moment, with Celebrimbor gently adorning him, he could believe he was still that being of light, untouched by shadow.\nHe opened his eyes again when he felt the cool weight of a circlet being placed upon his brow. Gold, of course, delicately wrought with Elven designs and set with a single, brilliant gem in the center. Celebrimbor adjusted it slightly, then stood back, his gaze appraising, his lips curving into a look of quiet satisfaction.\n“There,” Celebrimbor said softly, stepping aside to let Annatar see his reflection in the tall mirror before them. “Perfect.”\nAnnatar turned his head slowly, eyes drawn to the figure in the glass. For a moment, he didn’t recognize the reflection. The being staring back at him was resplendent in light and purity, his golden hair catching the golden light of day, the whites and golds of his attire glowing like the sun itself. He looked every inch the Maia he had once been under Aulë’s guidance - bright, radiant, and untarnished by the darkness that had consumed him.\nFor the briefest of moments, he saw Mairon in the reflection - shining, unmarred, brilliant with the light of the Valar. The one who had not yet fallen. The Maia who had forged wonders, who had sung the songs of creation with fire in his veins. The fire of the forge burned in his eyes, the passion for creation and beauty that had once driven him.\nAnd beside him stood Celebrimbor, his Lord, his artist - his other half.\nBut the moment passed, and the image before him felt like a cruel illusion. He was no longer Mairon, no longer the pure, shining Maia. His heart, twisted and blackened by his time under Melkor, would never again be as Celebrimbor saw it. The radiance in the mirror was a lie.\nYet, Celebrimbor looked at him as if he were still that Maia of fire and song.\n“Do you like it?” He asked, his voice soft with affection, his hands resting gently on Annatar’s shoulders as he admired his work in the mirror.\nAnnatar swallowed hard, his throat tightening as he tore his gaze from his reflection in the mirror and looked instead at Celebrimbor's. The elf was smiling at him, that soft, affectionate smile that always made Annatar’s heart clench in ways he wished it wouldn’t.\nHe believes it, Annatar thought bitterly. Celebrimbor truly believed that Annatar was this being of purity and light. He had no idea of the darkness that lurked beneath the surface, the corruption that had twisted his soul beyond repair.\nAnnatar forced a smile, his heart heavy with the weight of the deception. “I do,” he replied quietly, his fingers brushing against the golden rings adorning his hands. “You’ve made me look wonderful… ethereal even,” He hesitated, searching for the right words. “You’ve made me look like the being I remember myself to be.”\nCelebrimbor pressed a gentle kiss to the side of his neck, resting his chin on Annatar’s shoulder. “You are that being,” he whispered, his voice full of love and conviction. “You are more than you know, and more than you let yourself believe.”\nAnnatar closed his eyes, a knot tightening in his chest. He wanted to believe it. He wanted to believe that the darkness hadn’t fully consumed him, that light could still exist within him. But he knew the truth. He was plotting Eregion's downfall, after all.\nHe wasn’t Mairon anymore. And this - this happiness with Celebrimbor - was as fragile as the delicate circlet resting on his brow.\nAnnatar leaned into Celebrimbor’s touch, the warmth of the elf’s hands grounding him in the moment, even as his mind wrestled with the darker truths he kept hidden. For now, he would let himself believe the lie. For now, he would let Celebrimbor’s love make him feel whole.\nHe smiled again, more genuinely this time, as he turned to face Celebrimbor. \"I am fortunate,\" he murmured, his voice low and filled with a tenderness he rarely allowed himself to show. “Fortunate to have you, Tyelpe.”\nCelebrimbor’s eyes softened, and he pulled Annatar close, his hands resting lightly against the Maia’s back. “No,” Celebrimbor whispered, pressing a kiss to his lips, soft and full of promise. “It is I who am fortunate.”\nAs he pulled away, Annatar’s heart twisted painfully in his chest as he stared at the elf who loved him so fiercely, so completely. At least for now, he would try to be the being Celebrimbor saw in him.\nAnd as Celebrimbor led him away from the mirror, speaking enthusiastically about a new project he had in mind, Annatar cast one last glance at his reflection.\nThe golden Maia in the mirror smiled back at him, radiant and pure.\nBut the shadow lurking beneath his skin remained.",

        "story": "Annatar stood motionless in the center of their chambers, his sharp eyes fixed on Celebrimbor as the elf moved with careful precision. The Lord of Eregion, ever the artisan, fussed over him with an artist’s devotion. His deft hands worked as though Annatar were the finest creation Celebrimbor had ever crafted.\nThe robe that Celebrimbor had chosen for him was white, the purest shade of ivory, embroidered with intricate gold thread that shimmered with every shift of light. The golden patterns traced delicate paths along the sleeves, cuffs, and collar - patterns that Celebrimbor had designed specifically for him. It felt like being cloaked in sunlight, radiant and resplendent. The stark contrast of white and gold against his skin was deliberate, no doubt. Celebrimbor’s vision of him, made manifest.\nCelebrimbor knelt in front of him, adjusting the robe, pulling the fabric tight before stepping back to admire his work.\n“Beautiful,” he murmured as he took Annatar’s hand, slowly sliding a golden ring onto his finger - one he had forged himself, as always. Annatar’s gaze shifted downward, watching those gentle, reverent hands as they moved to adorn him with the finest of Celebrimbor’s jewellery.\nMore golden rings, each delicate yet powerful, slipped onto his fingers, their metal cool at first, then warming against his skin. Bracelets followed, the slight clink of metal-on-metal filling the room as they rested perfectly around his wrists.\nCelebrimbor’s fingers grazed his skin as he adjusted each piece of jewellery with meticulous care, tracing the lines of his palm, before he lifted his hands to his lips. A soft kiss, reverent - his face alight with the quiet satisfaction of a craftsman. He wasn’t just dressing Annatar. No, to him, this was something more profound - an act of adoration. “So beautiful, so pure,” Celebrimbor murmured, almost absentmindedly as if it were a fact, not an observation.\nAnnatar almost flinched, but he schooled his features into a soft smile instead, letting Celebrimbor’s words wash over him.\nPure.\nCelebrimbor said it with such certainty, with such love, that Annatar felt a painful pang in his chest.\nCelebrimbor’s eyes, those eyes full of love and admiration, gazed upon him as though he were some sacred being. A being of light and goodness.\nHe wanted to believe it. He wanted to believe for just a moment that he\nwas\nthe being Celebrimbor saw - a radiant Maia of golden light, of beauty, of creation. But beneath the layers of fabric and gentle touches lay the truth that neither of them could escape. Mairon was long gone, twisted into something darker, something more ruthless. Annatar, this beautiful façade, was nothing more than a vessel for his plans.\nBut Celebrimbor - Celebrimbor saw none of that. His grey eyes were soft with affection as he lifted another piece of jewellery, a golden bracelet, and fastened it around Annatar’s wrist. His hands were steady, as though every movement was part of some sacred ritual. It almost felt like worship, the way Celebrimbor handled him. As if Annatar were something holy, something worthy of reverence.\nAnd Annatar, in his weakness, found himself craving more of it.\n“Tyelpe,” he said softly, his voice steady yet touched by something unspoken. “You flatter me too much.”\n“Not enough, I think,” Celebrimbor replied with a small smile, stepping behind him now, his fingers combing carefully through Annatar’s golden hair, untangling each strand. It was a tenderness that caught Annatar off guard, even now. He felt the reverence in every movement, the soft hum of concentration that always accompanied Celebrimbor when he was working on something precious.\nAnd Annatar - Sauron, Mairon, a dark lord hiding in plain sight -\nfelt\nprecious under those hands.\nIt was a ridiculous notion, of course. How could he, who had once sworn himself to Melkor, feel anything other than the heavy burden of his own betrayal, the weight of his corrupted power? But here, in Celebrimbor’s presence, in the Lord of Eregion’s deft, tender care, Annatar almost forgot.\nAlmost.\n“Hold still,” Celebrimbor murmured, his voice soft with affection. He carefully smoothed the final strands of Annatar’s hair into place, his fingers lingering for just a moment longer than necessary, as if savoring the feeling of his golden locks on his fingers.\nAnnatar closed his eyes for a brief moment, allowing himself the luxury of leaning into Celebrimbor’s touch. For this one moment, he could be Mairon again, the Maia of Aulë, the one who crafted wonders of fire, metal and gemstone. In this moment, with Celebrimbor gently adorning him, he could believe he was still that being of light, untouched by shadow.\nHe opened his eyes again when he felt the cool weight of a circlet being placed upon his brow. Gold, of course, delicately wrought with Elven designs and set with a single, brilliant gem in the center. Celebrimbor adjusted it slightly, then stood back, his gaze appraising, his lips curving into a look of quiet satisfaction.\n“There,” Celebrimbor said softly, stepping aside to let Annatar see his reflection in the tall mirror before them. “Perfect.”\nAnnatar turned his head slowly, eyes drawn to the figure in the glass. For a moment, he didn’t recognize the reflection. The being staring back at him was resplendent in light and purity, his golden hair catching the golden light of day, the whites and golds of his attire glowing like the sun itself. He looked every inch the Maia he had once been under Aulë’s guidance - bright, radiant, and untarnished by the darkness that had consumed him.\nFor the briefest of moments, he saw Mairon in the reflection - shining, unmarred, brilliant with the light of the Valar. The one who had not yet fallen. The Maia who had forged wonders, who had sung the songs of creation with fire in his veins. The fire of the forge burned in his eyes, the passion for creation and beauty that had once driven him.\nAnd beside him stood Celebrimbor, his Lord, his artist - his other half.\nBut the moment passed, and the image before him felt like a cruel illusion. He was no longer Mairon, no longer the pure, shining Maia. His heart, twisted and blackened by his time under Melkor, would never again be as Celebrimbor saw it. The radiance in the mirror was a lie.\nYet, Celebrimbor looked at him as if he were still that Maia of fire and song.\n“Do you like it?” He asked, his voice soft with affection, his hands resting gently on Annatar’s shoulders as he admired his work in the mirror.\nAnnatar swallowed hard, his throat tightening as he tore his gaze from his reflection in the mirror and looked instead at Celebrimbor's. The elf was smiling at him, that soft, affectionate smile that always made Annatar’s heart clench in ways he wished it wouldn’t.\nHe believes it, Annatar thought bitterly. Celebrimbor truly believed that Annatar was this being of purity and light. He had no idea of the darkness that lurked beneath the surface, the corruption that had twisted his soul beyond repair.\nAnnatar forced a smile, his heart heavy with the weight of the deception. “I do,” he replied quietly, his fingers brushing against the golden rings adorning his hands. “You’ve made me look wonderful… ethereal even,” He hesitated, searching for the right words. “You’ve made me look like the being I remember myself to be.”\nCelebrimbor pressed a gentle kiss to the side of his neck, resting his chin on Annatar’s shoulder. “You are that being,” he whispered, his voice full of love and conviction. “You are more than you know, and more than you let yourself believe.”\nAnnatar closed his eyes, a knot tightening in his chest. He wanted to believe it. He wanted to believe that the darkness hadn’t fully consumed him, that light could still exist within him. But he knew the truth. He was plotting Eregion's downfall, after all.\nHe wasn’t Mairon anymore. And this - this happiness with Celebrimbor - was as fragile as the delicate circlet resting on his brow.\nAnnatar leaned into Celebrimbor’s touch, the warmth of the elf’s hands grounding him in the moment, even as his mind wrestled with the darker truths he kept hidden. For now, he would let himself believe the lie. For now, he would let Celebrimbor’s love make him feel whole.\nHe smiled again, more genuinely this time, as he turned to face Celebrimbor. \"I am fortunate,\" he murmured, his voice low and filled with a tenderness he rarely allowed himself to show. “Fortunate to have you, Tyelpe.”\nCelebrimbor’s eyes softened, and he pulled Annatar close, his hands resting lightly against the Maia’s back. “No,” Celebrimbor whispered, pressing a kiss to his lips, soft and full of promise. “It is I who am fortunate.”\nAs he pulled away, Annatar’s heart twisted painfully in his chest as he stared at the elf who loved him so fiercely, so completely.

The flames cast dancing shadows across the room, creating an ambiance of warmth and intimacy.\nTúrin sat cross-legged on the rug before the hearth, his back propped against a stack of cushions, his eyes fixed on the flickering flames.

He was known throughout the realm for his bravery and unyielding spirit, even though he was a bit stubborn and reckless.\"\nTúrin chuckled softly. \"Go on.\"\n\"Yet, even the bravest of heroes have their moments of doubt,\" Beleg continued. \"And so it was that Túrin found himself facing a formidable foe, a dragon of immense size and power.\"\nTúrin's fingers stilled in Beleg's hair, his eyes focused on the imaginary world his lover was weaving with his words. \"How did he defeat the dragon?\"\n\"Ah, patience. That is the heart of the tale,\" Beleg replied. \"Túrin knew that he could not conquer the dragon through strength alone. So, he embarked on a quest to find the dragon's secret weakness, a vulnerability that even the mightiest of beasts possessed.\"\nAs Beleg's storytelling continued, the room seemed to fade away, and Túrin found himself immersed in the adventure. He listened with rapt attention, his mind painting vivid images of the hero's journey, the dragon, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil.\nOutside, the wind whispered secrets to the trees, but within their hut, Beleg's voice was the only sound that mattered. The flames in the hearth danced to the rhythm of the story, casting ever-shifting shadows on the walls.\nAs Beleg's tale neared its conclusion, Túrin felt a profound sense of contentment wash over him. The world beyond their walls could be chaotic and unforgiving, but here, in their little haven, it wouldn’t reach them.\n\"And so,\" Beleg concluded, \"Túrin, armed with the knowledge of the dragon's weakness, faced the beast one final time.

Their lips met with a soft and lingering sweetness, like the taste of honey on a crisp autumn morning.\n\"Then we will meet those creatures head on and rise triumphant, just how the hero in your story did,\" Túrin whispered against his lover's lips.\nAs they pulled away, Túrin settled back against the cushions, his fingers resuming their gentle caresses through Beleg's hair.

What kind of story would you like to hear tonight, my love?\"\nTúrin's fingers continued their rhythmic dance through Beleg's hair as he contemplated. \"Tell me of a great adventure, one where heroes rise against insurmountable odds.\"\n\"So it shall be,\" Beleg began, his voice a soothing murmur. \"Once upon a time, in a land not so different from our own, there lived a valiant hero named… Túrin. He was known throughout the realm for his bravery and unyielding spirit, even though he was a bit stubborn and reckless.\"\nTúrin chuckled softly. \"Go on.\"\n\"Yet, even the bravest of heroes have their moments of doubt,\" Beleg continued. \"And so it was that Túrin found himself facing a formidable foe, a dragon of immense size and power.\"\nTúrin's fingers stilled in Beleg's hair, his eyes focused on the imaginary world his lover was weaving with his words. \"How did he defeat the dragon?\"\n\"Ah, patience. That is the heart of the tale,\" Beleg replied. \"Túrin knew that he could not conquer the dragon through strength alone. So, he embarked on a quest to find the dragon's secret weakness, a vulnerability that even the mightiest of beasts possessed.\"\nAs Beleg's storytelling continued, the room seemed to fade away, and Túrin found himself immersed in the adventure. He listened with rapt attention, his mind painting vivid images of the hero's journey, the dragon, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil.\nOutside, the wind whispered secrets to the trees, but within their hut, Beleg's voice was the only sound that mattered. The flames in the hearth danced to the rhythm of the story, casting ever-shifting shadows on the walls.\nAs Beleg's tale neared its conclusion, Túrin felt a profound sense of contentment wash over him. The world beyond their walls could be chaotic and unforgiving, but here, in their little haven, it wouldn’t reach them.\n\"And so,\" Beleg concluded, \"Túrin, armed with the knowledge of the dragon's weakness, faced the beast one final time. He waited for a fortunate moment to strike and, with a heart full of courage and determination, he struck true and thus brought an end to the reign of terror.\"\nTúrin smiled down at Beleg, his heart filled with admiration and love. \"Thank you for this story. Though I think it would do Túrin good if he had someone to rely on by his side, perhaps someone called Beleg?\"\nBeleg opened his eyes and gazed at Túrin with a tender expression, though worry was beginning to creep in. \"Then you might as well make this story a future prediction. We do not know if or when Morgoth will let his worms loose against us.\"\nLeaning down, Túrin captured Beleg's lips in a gentle kiss, a testament to the love that bound them together. Their lips met with a soft and lingering sweetness, like the taste of honey on a crisp autumn morning.\n\"Then we will meet those creatures head on and rise triumphant, just how the hero in your story did,\" Túrin whispered against his lover's lips.\nAs they pulled away, Túrin settled back against the cushions, his fingers resuming their gentle caresses through Beleg's hair. The fire continued to burn brightly, casting a warm and inviting glow over their sanctuary.\nFinally, another undisturbed evening that was theirs alone to enjoy.",

        "story": "The air in the practice yard of Eregion’s stronghold was crisp, carrying with it the faint scent of iron and the distant clang of metal from the nearby forges. Celebrimbor stood opposite Annatar, practice sword in hand, a curious expression on his face as he studied his companion.\n“Are you sure about this, Annatar? I wouldn’t wanna force you.” Celebrimbor asked, a hint of uncertainty in his voice. He had suggested the friendly spar on a whim, as a way to pass the time and perhaps even gauge Annatar’s proficiency with combat, considering his expertise in crafting weapons and armor.\nAnnatar, however, seemed unfazed by the prospect, a confident smirk playing at the corners of his lips. “Of course, Tyelpe,” he replied picking up a practice sword, his tone laced with amusement. “I’m always up for a challenge.”\nWith a nod, Celebrimbor took a step back, readying himself for the bout to come. He had sparred with many skilled warriors in his time, but there was something about facing off against Annatar that set his nerves on edge.\nAs they circled each other, their movements fluid and precise, Celebrimbor couldn’t shake the feeling of unease that prickled at the back of his mind. There was an intensity in Annatar’s gaze, a determination that belied his usual easygoing demeanor.\nThe clang of practice swords echoed through the empty yard as Celebrimbor and Annatar faced off against each other. Celebrimbor couldn’t help but marvel at Annatar’s grace and agility - he moved with a dancer’s finesse, his every movement calculated and deliberate, darting in and out of his reach as he sought to land a blow.\nCelebrimbor, on the other hand, relied more on his years of formal training and experience, parrying Annatar’s attacks with ease and countering with lightning-fast strikes of his own.\nSuddenly, Annatar lunged forward, his practice sword flashing in the sunlight as he aimed a swift strike at Celebrimbor’s side. Reacting on instinct, Celebrimbor deflected the blow with his own sword, the shrill clash of metal ringing out through the yard.\nThey continued to exchange blows, each trying to anticipate the next steps. Mingled with an inexplicable hint of panic, Celebrimbor felt a surge of admiration and respect for Annatar’s skill and prowess, despite a seeming lack of formal training.\nBut just as Celebrimbor began to let his guard down, thinking he had figured out Annatar’s approach to combat, the Maia's expression shifted, a mischievous glint dancing in his golden eyes. Without warning, he dropped his practice sword, reaching instead for a dagger concealed at his waist.\nCelebrimbor’s eyes widened in alarm as Annatar closed the distance between them, the dagger flashing in the sunlight as it arced toward him. Instinctively, he raised his own sword to block the attack, but Annatar’s movements were too quick, too precise.\nIn the blink of an eye, Celebrimbor found himself staring down the length of the dagger, its edge hovering dangerously close to his throat. He froze, his breath catching in his throat as he realized the gravity of the situation - if Annatar had desired it, he could have struck him down without hesitation.\nFor a moment, there was silence, broken only by the sound of their labored breathing. Then, to Celebrimbor’s surprise, Annatar let out a hearty laugh, the tension melting away as quickly as it had appeared.\n“Well, that was unexpected,” Celebrimbor managed to say, his voice shaky with adrenaline.\nAnnatar grinned, twirling the dagger between his fingers with practiced ease. “Did I frighten you?” he replied, his tone teasing. “I have to admit, I do have a few tricks up my sleeve,” he added, his tone casual as if they were discussing the weather.\nCelebrimbor couldn’t help but chuckle, shaking his head in disbelief. “I suppose I should have known better than to underestimate you,” he admitted.\nAnnatar’s grin widened, his eyes sparkling with mischief. “Don’t worry, Tyelpe dear,” he said, his voice low and conspiratorial. “I promise to only use my combat skills for your protection, should the need arise.”\nDespite the jest, Celebrimbor couldn’t shake the lingering sense of unease that lingered in the back of his mind. He now knew that Annatar was more than capable of defending himself – and others – should he wish to. But there was something about the ease with which he concealed and wielded the dagger that left him unsettled.\nPushing aside his concerns for the moment, Celebrimbor offered Annatar a wry smile. “I’ll hold you to that,” he said, his voice tinged with amusement.\nWith a nod of agreement, Annatar picked up and returned his practice sword to its sheath, the tension of the spar dissipating like the morning mist. As they made their way back to the forges, Celebrimbor couldn’t help but wonder what other surprises Annatar had up his sleeve – and whether he\ntruly\nwanted to find out.",

        "story": "Beach days: the sun shining down, the beauty of the waves, the gentle breeze and the feeling of sand beneath your feet.\nAll things Nico hated.\nPercy and Annabeth were playing chicken fight against Piper and Jason in the water, Reyna was reading a book, Frank and Hazel were chatting away whilst relaxing on a large float, Leo was trying to set the water on fire and Nico was being pestered by his boyfriend.\nWill rubbed the sunscreen on Nico's back as he talked about how fun beaches were. Incessantly. Loudly. Persistantly.\n\"Look, I just don't like them,\" Nico tried to reason.\n\"But they're so much fun!\" Will objected. \"Splashing people, sandcastles, picnics.\"\n\"Shark attacks, jellyfish, drowning.\"\n\"Okay, there's only about nine shark attacks that are fatal per year.\"\nNico raised an eyebrow and twisted around to face his boyfriend. \"People are dead, William.\"\nWill rolled his eyes and tackled Nico onto the blanket, positing himself so that Nico was trapped under his arms. He kissed Nico’s nose and grinned.\n\"We are at the beach with our friends,\" he said slowly. \"And you will have a good time.\"\nNico shook his head.\n\"You will!\" Will encouraged. \"I'm sending good vibes your way and there's  nothing you can do to stop them.\"\nNico scoffed but in the end he couldn't deny the adorable look on Will’s face.\n\"Fine,\" he said. \"But only because you're here.\"\nWill’s grin widened. \"Wouldn't expect anything else. Now come in the water!\"\nNico’s eyes widened. \"Hang on, I didn't say I would do that!\"\nWill dragged him to his feet. \"Too late, you shall.\"\nAs he was pulled towards the beach, Nico half heartedly tried to pull back, part of him already accepting his fate. So this is how he would die. He wondered whether the shark attack fatality rating would go up after this. He wondered if his dad would grow back his leg for him when he was a ghost.\n\"But I have a doctor's note!\" he yelled as Will scooped him up in his arms and chucked him far into the water. Nico spluttered, treading water as elegantly as possible, which is to say not at all. Will laughed and swam towards him.\nAnnoyingly, Will was still tall enough that he could stand where Nico couldn't.\n\"Cheer up, darlin'. Relax!\"\n\"You say that after being yeeted into a watery grave.\"\nWill pulled Nico to him, kissing his head. \"You're so dramatic. I love it.\"\n\"Hey!\" Percy waved enthusiastically from a short while away. \"You guys wanna chicken fight?\"\nWill glanced at Nico. Before he could even open his mouth to object, Nico was sitting on a pair of shoulders advancing towards a cheerful Percy and a smug Annabeth who had just sent Piper to the bottom of the ocean.\n\"This is it,\" Nico said to himself. \"I am dead.\"\nHe was not dead but his dignity was.\nHe lost, although he blamed it on Percy cheating, and found himself wrapped in a towel on one of the blankets scowling at Will.\n\"I hate beach days,\" he said but, as he looked around at his friends laughing and messing around for the first time in a long time, he smiled to himself.\nThey would still pay, though.",

Will could feel his cheeks turning bright red.\n“Yes,” he answered somewhat hesitantly. Looking deep in thought, Nico nodded.\n“Can you teach me?”\nDespite how unfazed Nico looked by all this, Will was rivalling a tomato. Teach?\n“I’ve always been curious as to like... how you do it,” Nico continued. “And you’re my best friend so obviously you are my go to.”\nBest friend, Will repeated in his head. Just friends helping out friends. Buddies being buddies. His heart sank just a little but he smiled and went to sit on Nico’s bed with his legs crossed. Nico did the same and sat opposite him.\n“Okay, well,” Will fumbled around for the words. “Let’s start with the basics. Pouting lips. You know about that, right?”\nNico’s head tilted to one side like an adorably confused animal.\n“It’s where you go like this.” Will made a kissing face as best he could. Nico snorted.\n“You look like a duck.”\n“Well then I know better to help you out in the future.”\nNico grabbed Will’s arms. “Wait, I’m sorry. You’re a very handsome duck.”\nHe dropped Will’s arms and mimicked the face.\n“Like this?” his muffled voice asked. Will couldn’t help but start laughing.\n“It does look like a duck!”\nNico burst out laughing with him.\nIt took a few minutes but eventually they calmed down.\n“Okay, we got the basics.” Will caught his breath.\n“Wait but there’s more right?” Nico said. “When people make out and stuff. They lick each other.”\n“Oh my gods!” Will was both cracking up and blushing hard enough he glowed.\n“What? They lick each others’ mouths and stuff.”\n“Yeah I guess they lick each other.” Will gasped for air.\n“And don’t they bite each other too? Eat each other?”\nWill howled with laughter, rolling onto his side and clutching his stomach. Nico couldn’t help but smile at the sight.\n“What? What did I say?”\nWill sat back up, a hand over his mouth to cover his laughter.\n“One last question, I promise,” Nico implored. “What do you do with your eyes?”\n“You shut them,” Will said. He closed his eyes for demonstration. When he opened them, Nico nodded thoughtfully.\nBefore Will could process it, Nico had shut his eyes, leaned forward and given him a brief but sweet kiss.\n“Like that?” Nico questioned nervously.\nWill’s brain had stopped working. His mouth opened and closed aimlessly and his eyes were as wide as saucers.\n“Did I get it wrong?”\nWill shook his head. “No... You know, these things take practice.”\nNico raised an eyebrow. “Really? It’s just mushing faces together. I think I did pretty good.”\n“You did amazing,” Will confirmed. “But there’s other stuff too.”\nHe shuffled closer, gazing into Nico’s wide eyes. He raised his hands to cup Nico’s face and tuck that bit of loose hair behind his ear.\n“Like this?” Nico lifted his hands to do the same to Will’s face, brown eyes looking over every inch of it.\n“Yeah,” Will said quietly. “Then you lean in.”\nHe leaned in as he spoke until their lips were a breath away. He couldn’t stop looking at how close they were.\n“You’re supposed to close your eyes,” Nico whispered. Will nodded.\n“Yeah.”\nAnd he did.",

        "story": "#Act I: Sparks It was a particularly sunny Saturday morning at Whistler-Down. Breakfast had been scrambled eggs, toast, orange juice, and oatmeal, as usual-- with the addition of bacon. Real, honest-to-God bacon that had once been part of a pig. Even Jaz had cracked a smile, though she was quick to return her black lipstick-painted lips back to their usual scowling position in case someone was looking. Araceli had caught it anyway and tried her best to hide her smirk. The only person who hadn't been happy about the menu surprise was Elsie, but that couldn't be helped. She was starting to make some progress: the day before, she'd eaten at least something at all three meals. Some of the hollowness was starting to fade from her cheeks. After breakfast, the topic of the community discussion group had been Creatively Resolving Conflicts... again. Araceli was one of the more 'permanent' residents at Whistler-Down. In the women's ward, only Grace had been around longer than she had, as far as she could tell. Grace was constantly dozing off, thanks to whatever medication they'd put her on. It was hard to get her to stay awake long enough to have a sustained conversation. Creatively Resolving Conflicts was one of the more engaging workshops, at least. The facilitator had brought in cue cards for role-playing exercises, which was always entertaining. The Saturday wasn't off to a bad start. According to the clock in the common room, it was 9:30. Araceli had to wait until 9:32 for Jim to come find her. Jim was one of the younger orderlies. He performed his duties with briskness and avoided eye contact with most patients when he did. It was apparent that whatever he'd once envisioned for his life, Whistler-Down hadn't been part of the plan. It was the usual Saturday morning for him: his eyes were watery and bloodshot, and he dragged himself through the hallways as if Grace had lent him some of her meds. \"Ara, doctor's check,\" Jim slurred. He followed her at a perfunctory distance until they reached Dr. Janus' office. His hand fumbled at the doorknob for just a moment, as if he'd misjudged the distance. Ara felt the quick glance he shot at her, baleful with the spiderweb-fissures of veins in his eyes. It didn't really matter if she noticed the slip-up-- as one of the longer-term patients and a persona non grata to the outside world, her judgments didn't count for much. But he still had the instinct to check. Jim opened the door. Dr. Benjamin Janus sat inside, the light of the sunny Saturday morning illuminating him like a muted halo. This was the most tranquil space in the entire hospital, with leather couches, soft rugs, bright cheery plants near the windows, and paintings in warm and vibrant colors. Dr. Janus looked up from his papers. \"Ara!\" he called out with a smile. \"Come on in.\" His eyes shifted to Jim. The two men shared a nod. Jim shot a sullen look at Ara before shuffling off. Ara closed the door behind her and took the patient's customary seat on the brown leather couch. On mornings past, an orderly had needed to accompany her into the office and occupied the other end of the couch. With only her and the doctor in the room, the room felt freer, as if there were more air to breathe. The psychiatrist pushed some papers to the side of his desk and turned his full attention to Ara. His smile was a little worn, and his crow's feet seemed sculpted more deeply than usual. He'd already seen a few patients today, and some of them must have given him a hard time. \"You look radiant today, Ara. Milagros tells me you've had a good week.\" It was true. Milagros, the evening shift nurse in the women's ward, would usually be the one to come to Dr. Janus' office bearing bad news about relapses, episodes, and breakdowns. Not so, this week. \"Tell me how you're feeling. How's your mood? And how's the Rozerem working out? We can always go back to Ambien if you've noticed any side-effects.\" It wasn't apparent in his smile, which despite his tiredness shone with genuine affability, but they'd had this conversation many times over the years. Ara knew his usual repertoire of questions and could guess his timing to the second. These were the usual starting questions. In a few minutes, in his usual manner of compassion coupled with professionalism, Dr. Janus would dip into the more serious questions: how were the nightmares. Had she experienced any desires to hurt herself or others. Was she experiencing thoughts of suicide. It was another Saturday.",

Imagine how much money could come pouring in, huh?\" Alcippe didn't need to look at the younger woman; she could hear the grin in Cynthia's voice. They still had some time before they arrived.

Brimo Amusements, the company was called. They'd steadily bought up the land around Sophono through a series of real estate deals, some above-board, some a bit... 'mysterious,' for the past two years. Now, they had reached out to Sophono's stakeholders with an invitation to a private luncheon, where they apparently planned to divulge their proposals for land development. They'd rented conference space at the Hyatt. Alcippe wasn't sure what she should expect: a cramped, tiny boardroom full of sweaty middle-aged men in business suits? A lavish affair in the ballroom, complete with fondue fountains and ice sculptures? The ride to the Hyatt wasn't long, but Cynthia had taken the opportunity to regale Alcippe with all of the notes she'd taken on Brimo Amusements' properties and history. The eager young woman had flooded the car with a prattling series of facts and figures that never seemed to end. Cynthia was talking again. \"This Alexander Brimo guy, he owns *seven* other properties across the tri-state area. There's a-- hm, hold on. No, I don't want to buy your whiskey. *Gawd*, why do they always show you alcohol ads in everything? Do I *look* like an alchie? Hello. ...okay, right, seven properties, looks like we've got... a branch of American Amusements, a go-kart place, a... mini-golf place? Or a water park? Or water-mini-golf? I don't even know what this is-- wow. And he wants to bring this new park to *our* neighborhood. He must be a busy man.\" Cynthia laughed. No-- no, that wasn't the right word. She *tittered* like a small bird. \"Gosh. Isn't this exciting? Maybe this place will put Sophono on the map! I mean, the extra traffic from all the tourism might put some strain on our infrastructure, the hospitality industry, things like that, but. The economy. Imagine how much money could come pouring in, huh?\" Alcippe didn't need to look at the younger woman; she could hear the grin in Cynthia's voice. They still had some time before they arrived. Maybe it was worth talking shop, laying out the facts so they could present a common front at the meeting. Or maybe, she should just push Cynthia out into the road and speed off down the Thruway. At least she'd be able to enjoy a little silence on her Saturday morning before schmoozing time.",

        "story": "#Act I: Earth and Water The GPS said the approximate arrival time would be 11:02 AM. Not bad, Alcippe thought, and remembered to relax her iron grip on the steering wheel. She liked being punctual. In her mind, punctuality meant showing up at least half an hour early and getting a feel for the environment and the situation before the Powers That Be appeared with their plastic smiles and slick presentations. Better to lay down the foundations of understanding herself before someone tried to shove their own biased version down her throat. \"Oh my God,\" the chipper voice in the passenger seat said, and Alcippe's fingers clamped down around the steering wheel reflexively. She had to consciously will her fingers to loosen again. The voice belonged to Cynthia Brower.

Two were parked in the spaces closest to the back door, likely the designated spots of the funeral home staff. There were three or four other cars he didn't recognize, and one that he did: a 1998 Toyota Camry, the \"Torture Is a Moral Issue\" bumper sticker still plastered to the back, faded but stubbornly legible. His grandparents hadn't exactly adjusted well to change, as long as he'd known them. He had been sitting in the car for ten minutes. Something kept him in the driver's seat, staring through the windshield at the trees lining the parking lot. It was a sunny Saturday morning, and the leaves made gold-green kaleidoscopes on the sidewalk. The manicured shrubs hinted that a loving hand had directed the landscaping here. The inside would probably be like that, too: extravagant bouquets of flowers, carefully color-coordinated curtains, neat arrangements of chairs, memorial wreaths, photo collages, sympathy cards, guestbooks. The dead body itself, sculpted with formaldehyde, plaster, mortician's makeup, bathed and stuffed and hooked and shaped. They might as well rig it with animatronics and sell it to Universal Studios. Daniel rubbed his eyes and sighed. It wasn't right to think this way about his grandfather, but discomfort lodged in his esophagus, made him want to sulk and tell terrible jokes about the Holocaust and dead babies, made him stay in the car when he knew his grandma was inside and probably needed him. Lung cancer, for God's sake. Eighty-nine years, most of them spent working for the IRS or dodging Japanese bullets in the Pacific theater during World War II, and it was the Marlboros that finally closed out his accounts. Still. As Daniel knew, there were far worse ways to go. In a moment of decision, he jerked himself out of the car, locked up, and walked through the door of Rosenberg Funeral Home. The walls were softly lit and lined with grandmother-pink wallpaper. *Maternal* was the word for it. Daniel looked around the empty hallways. Nothing but chairs lined up outside walls and open doors to empty rooms. He chose a direction, turned the corner, and saw his grandmother standing with her hands clasped to her chest. She was speaking with a tall man who had sympathetic eyes and a crown of wispy white hair surrounding an oddly reflective bald spot. Grandma's eyes wandered, found his, and she stopped. So did Daniel. For a moment, they stood and looked at each other. How many years had it been? She seemed to wonder the same thing. Her eyes were more tired than he remembered. He saw the light of recognition dawning in them, and she unclasped her hands and opened her arms. \"Daniel. Oh. Daniel. You made it here.\" \"Grandma.\" Daniel closed the distance and wrapped his arms around her shoulders. It felt like hugging a baby bird. Grandma ended the hug and looked up at him with her palms against his shoulders. She was smiling, but her eyes had a certain flatness. Was it a hint of anger? \"It's good to have you here, Daniel.\" The tall man shuffled his weight slightly, and Grandma backed away to include him in their confidence. \"Daniel, this is Arthur. He owns the funeral home here.\" \"Pleased to meet you, Daniel,\" Arthur said, turning his kind eyes on Daniel and extending his hand to shake. \"Your grandfather was a friend of mine, going a long way back. I'm happy to do anything I can for the Spanners.\" \"Thank you,\" Daniel said. His mind had chilled a bit after seeing the look in Grandma's eyes, and automatic politeness came out of his mouth. \"I appreciate that.\" Arthur smiled. \"Well, I know you've come quite a ways to get here. I'm sure you'd like some privacy, before the guests arrive for the viewing. If you need me,\" he said, inclining his head toward Grandma almost as if bowing, \"I'll be in my office.\" \"Bless your heart, Arthur,\" Grandma said. \"You've been so kind.\" Arthur left them in the hallway, and Grandma watched him for a few moments. When he disappeared from sight, she sighed and her shoulders seemed to sag. \"It's good to see you,\" she said. \"It's good to see you, too,\" Daniel said.

        "story": "# Chaotic Good It was just about, but not quite, evening as a man and a woman sat at the window counter of a Starbucks. [**The man**]( tall, with a big chin, and floppy hair covering barely visible eyebrows, was gingerly sipping from his steaming cup as the blonde, foxy-eyed, woman glanced over at him, cupping her own. \"It doesn't even *taste* like pumpkin\", he said to her while studying his cup with greater intensity than necessary, \"And where's the spice? I swear...you *humans* and your 'fads'...\" He rolled his eyes, taking another sip, and soon felt a pointed glance directed at the bow-tie around his neck. The Doctor looked at the bow-tie then over at Claudia, exclaiming, \"What? Bow-ties are *cool*. Pumpkin spice lattes are *not*.\" Right on queue, just as they finished the rest of their lattes, The Doctor gave a slight jump as his breast pocket began vibrating with a pulsating green color. He took out the [**sonic screwdriver**]( which was indeed buzzing and flashing with a green light at the top. Studying it for no more than a few seconds, he shut it's green top and bolted out of his seat. \"They've awoken! I'm picking up their trail, come on!\", was the last Claudia heard of the Doctor before she scrambled after him out of the Starbucks and down the street. They ran down the London streets, weaving in between people and nearly getting run over by traffic. The Doctor, his sonic screwdriver out and guiding his way, was barely even paying attention to his surroundings. So much so, that Claudia had to yank him back several times to keep him from running out into the street or down an open manhole cover. Finally, however, they came to a stop in front of a very nondescript apartment in a row of such other nondescript apartments. \"Here it is! They're in there! The screwdriver is going *mad*. I just hope we're not too late...\", he said, motioning to this one particular door. Claudia raised a fist, prepared to give it a knock, when she heard the familiar green-lit buzzing coming from her left. On the other side of the door, in the quite tastefully furnished apartment, sat four young guys huddled around a table. On the table lay a very detailed map of what looked like a castle surrounded by weaving labyrinths of forests, swamps, and mountains. And on top of the map sat four plastic figurines of fantasy characters brandishing weapons, along with a couple plastic figures of a troll as well as a dragon further away near the castle. Handfuls of dice and charts of paper lay distributed among the boys as they seemed to be in a heated discussion about what to do with a distraught maiden they found near an overturned cart full of goods.

[**The man**]( tall, with a big chin, and floppy hair covering barely visible eyebrows, was gingerly sipping from his steaming cup as the blonde, foxy-eyed, woman glanced over at him, cupping her own. \"It doesn't even *taste* like pumpkin\", he said to her while studying his cup with greater intensity than necessary, \"And where's the spice? I swear...you *humans* and your 'fads'...\" He rolled his eyes, taking another sip, and soon felt a pointed glance directed at the bow-tie around his neck. The Doctor looked at the bow-tie then over at Claudia, exclaiming, \"What? Bow-ties are *cool*. Pumpkin spice lattes are *not*.\" Right on queue, just as they finished the rest of their lattes, The Doctor gave a slight jump as his breast pocket began vibrating with a pulsating green color. He took out the [**sonic screwdriver**]( which was indeed buzzing and flashing with a green light at the top. Studying it for no more than a few seconds, he shut it's green top and bolted out of his seat. \"They've awoken! I'm picking up their trail, come on!\", was the last Claudia heard of the Doctor before she scrambled after him out of the Starbucks and down the street. They ran down the London streets, weaving in between people and nearly getting run over by traffic. The Doctor, his sonic screwdriver out and guiding his way, was barely even paying attention to his surroundings. So much so, that Claudia had to yank him back several times to keep him from running out into the street or down an open manhole cover. Finally, however, they came to a stop in front of a very nondescript apartment in a row of such other nondescript apartments. \"Here it is! They're in there! The screwdriver is going *mad*. I just hope we're not too late...\", he said, motioning to this one particular door. Claudia raised a fist, prepared to give it a knock, when she heard the familiar green-lit buzzing coming from her left. On the other side of the door, in the quite tastefully furnished apartment, sat four young guys huddled around a table. On the table lay a very detailed map of what looked like a castle surrounded by weaving labyrinths of forests, swamps, and mountains. And on top of the map sat four plastic figurines of fantasy characters brandishing weapons, along with a couple plastic figures of a troll as well as a dragon further away near the castle. Handfuls of dice and charts of paper lay distributed among the boys as they seemed to be in a heated discussion about what to do with a distraught maiden they found near an overturned cart full of goods. Just as one of them turned to consult an open manual behind him, their apartment door slammed open and The Doctor stumbled into their room, followed a bit more hesitantly by Claudia. \"**Stop** right there, put down those die!\", the Doctor exclaimed poining an accusing finger at the table, \"Nobody touch *anything* on that table!\"",

        "writing_prompt": "On a chaotic Monday morning in a bustling city, a small coffee shop offering free coffee becomes the stage for an eclectic cast of characters—each with their own quirks, tempers, and secrets. What could possibly go wrong?",
        "story": "#Chapter 1: ##Customer Satisfaction Or 0 Days Without Sexual Harassment ###*(as narrated by Samuel L. Jackson)* There is nothing worse on Gods green Earth than a cold-ass Monday morning in the city. Everyone rushing to work or from night shifts or to school, everyone wanting to get the day started so it can already be over. Everyone being a *bitch* and a *cunt* to one another to get the last seat on the subway or be the first in line...and *no one* wanting to deal with those fuckers they have to be constantly surrounded by; the *other people*. But the thing about Mondays, is that even the smallest of things can make those horrible, terrible days of the week feel *just* a little better. And thats free fucking coffee. And not just *any* free fucking coffee from a mass-produced, ass-tasting barrel! No sir! Free *custom* made coffee with a fresh from the oven muffin in a warm and toasty coffee shop that lookswell, almost like Starbucks underachieving, slightly retarded brother that everyone praises for tying his shoes in the morning. I admit, its not the best coffee shop in the world, but ya gotta give 'em credit for trying. *Coffee Nutz*, originally the brain child of an NYU hipster who needed something more in life than a twenty-thousand-dollar piece of laminated paper, has grown quite a bit in its three whole years of existence. They have a total of three locations in the city; Uptown, Midtown, and Downtown, and have already partnered up with as many start-up businesses as you can think of. Uber, Yelp, Foursquareyou name it and you can *bet* someone was fucked on some couch in an office for it. However, since business wasnt exactly a boomin the owner decided to do a little Monday morning experiment to drum up some attention. **For today only**, all three of his locations would offer their products for free. And the Midtown location, just five blocks south of Central Park, is where *this* particular story is set. --- Now lets meet some of the players, shall we? First and foremost, the direct contact to the boss and the barista whos been there from day one; Chester. Chesters a curious sort. He was the first one to apply to a teeny coffee shop on the second floor of an equally as teeny adult book store, and even as that teeny coffee shop grew and grew and eventually expanded *into* the teeny adult book store, taking up both floors of the building, Chester has stayed the barista and sort of a team lead, for all of those three years. Never asking for a raise, or better hours, or seeking a promotion. For some inexplicable reason he just seemed to really love his job. It was still too early for Coffee Nutz to have many coffee-loving customers around, but it was a good sign already that people were lining up past the bakery counter. Chester was smiling -grinning- at a woman across from him dressed in a sleek business suit with a tightly pulled back bun on her head, chatting without breath into the outdated Bluetooth on her ear. Hi! Welcome to Coffee Nutz, where were all just *nuts* about coffee! Eheh... Today all the coffee is free, so what would you like to order? The woman, seeming to stare straight at Chester and yet managing to ignore him completely, said to no one in particular, Uh-huh yeah. Papers on my desk by lunchtime. Noby *brunch* time, got that? Write that down, write down brunch time. What? Ohum, medium half-caf latte, skim milk, *no* sugar, please. You said its free...?

Chester took a breath, turning it into a small laugh as he passed the empty cup to Willow, the only other barista behind the counter, Ahthank you for your order! Please step down to the pick-up counter and well get that right out for ya As Chester desperately busied himself with the next customer, the woman stepped over, leaning over the counter to watch Willow work on her coffee with judgmental intensity. As if studying the girls every move, finger hovering over her phone, ready to sue anyone for the littlest thing. Um, can Iplease get a different cup? I think that coffee clerk might have *dirtied* that one. *Thank you*!, the business woman chimed at Willow before taking another call on her Bluetooth again. --- Meanwhile, the business bitch wasnt the only rude customer on a phone in that coffee shop.

He held a phone up to his ear as he stood, from time to time checking out his big expensive watch. Well you can tell *Wallace* -verbatim- tell him I said this, tell him Im saying this *exactly*. I will *break* both his big toes and make him run, barefoot, to that Seven Eleven six blocks away to get me a twix bar. *Twix bar*, not a fucking Snickers, not those caramel peanut butter *horse cocks*, a goddamn *Twix* bar that he will pay for *out of pocket* and then run back to me *on* his broken toes.

Sonya was preparing the first batches for the bakery all while trying to teach poor Stevie some Russian while he stacked cups and prepped the coffee machines. Nate was finishing up packing all the little baggies and pills deep into their respective sacks of coffee, sugar and the like.

In ze one ear. Out of ze ozer. *Dob*. *Roe*. *Ut*. *Ro*.\" Stevie gave a whine. If he honestly cared about learning things, he would've stayed in college instead of pursuing a career in ethical hacking. \"Dobe...\" Meanwhile in the storage room near the back, Nate paused near one of the boxes he was packing as he heard a muffled crash come from outside, followed by a light string of curses. It was too early for customers. Front *or* back ones... He walked out through the back door and peeked around the corner, leaning his forearms on the door frame. Oh. It was only *Leon*...again. What a surprise! \"Oy!\", Nate called out to him, \"Freeloader! Stop messin' with my trash cans and make yerself useful, yes? Might score ya a free coffee and muffin!\" Nate tossed Leon a broom. \"Go sweep the front. Look pretty.\", with a grin and a wink, Nate disappeared back inside. As Nate joined his team up front in opening the cafe, Sonya gave their boss a weary look. \"How many *narcos* we get zis time, Gray?\", she said with a raised eyebrow as Stevie took his rightful place at the register. \"With *my* luck?\", Nate looked over as he perched on one of the back tables while picking at a freshly made muffin, \"The whole bloody *lot* of 'em!\" ----------------- ## Meanwhile in Kyoto, Japan. ## High up in a secluded temple. [**Leo**]( the current leader of The Ministry, soundlessly took a seat on the floor next to his sensei. \"She *will* be a part of us once again, Sensei. That I assure you. And the weapon will be passed on to its *rightful* owner. But it will not be an easy task.\", Leo spoke quietly with his eyes closed, keeping to the same quiet and meditative atmosphere as his master. \"Nothing is ever absolute\", came the answer from the old man, \"But there is something to easy your path, something that could...guide your way in your endeavors. That sword, it is not without a partner. *Yin and yang*. There exists another weapon. A sword of *light* to balance out the dark. An opposite to *Life Drainer*.\" Leo tensed up but did not let his surprise show any further than that. He remained silent as the sensei gave a smile. \"In time, my student, you will learn all that you need to know.\" --- *edit: Leo's pic changed.*",

        "story": "The Circus was headed into Marseilles, and the port city looked like it could really use the cheer of a circus. The city was an industrial center and clouds of smog filled the skies, giving the sky a nasty brown color, or at least orange on a good day. The market square, at the center of the harbor district would be the site of the performances for the next 4 days. It was hard to figure out how long the circus would be at any one point. The children had spent only 18 hours in Lyons and then for some reason, squatted down and put on full performances for 3 solid weeks in a little town in wine country that had fewer villagers than could possibly have been profitable. The circus staff on that stop had actually more than doubled the towns population. But you didnt question the manager on such things .Menindez made you afraid to ask about what was going on, except in the odd cases where he got mad if you didnt. It was hard to peg Old Ed, as a couple of the English and American performers called Eduardo Menindez, the grizzled 65-year-old manager who could pass for 45 most of the time. He was the real one that kept the circus running, but even in business affairs, he usually used the ring mistress, Clara Poe, an American who did triple duty as public face of the Circus Europa, Ring Mistress, and trick shooter. The little Dark-haired woman of about 40 was sometimes called clairpow playfully by many at the circus, and the name was used when there were enough English people in the crowd to like the onomatopoeia. Even when she wasnt doing her act, she carried a number of guns on her person, most of them with flashy ammunition or even comical attachment or noises involved, because her act was often quite comical. But as they looked at the harbor, there was the mix of people that had made Marseilles a hotbed of activity, both good and bad, since pre-Roman times. As a Mediterranean port, the city was part of the known world since before writing, and people from Africa, Asia, and all over Europe had gathered there for trade, intermingling, and at times, violence. Clara had announced that morning that England had changed its tune again and now was praising Germany to the heavens. Unfortunately, Germany had just decided that France was its closest ally. The circus had learned from her reports that the uneasy situation between the three countries changed almost every couple of weeks, though it was becoming more unstable. But life went on in Circus Europa, and the brilliant performing children were still at work preparing for the afternoons performance. Whether they worked in the sideshows, or would be in the center ring, the kids always had extensive training exercises each day and although they were paid and treated well, they were worked hard as well.

The circus staff on that stop had actually more than doubled the towns population. But you didnt question the manager on such things .Menindez made you afraid to ask about what was going on, except in the odd cases where he got mad if you didnt. It was hard to peg Old Ed, as a couple of the English and American performers called Eduardo Menindez, the grizzled 65-year-old manager who could pass for 45 most of the time. He was the real one that kept the circus running, but even in business affairs, he usually used the ring mistress, Clara Poe, an American who did triple duty as public face of the Circus Europa, Ring Mistress, and trick shooter. The little Dark-haired woman of about 40 was sometimes called clairpow playfully by many at the circus, and the name was used when there were enough English people in the crowd to like the onomatopoeia. Even when she wasnt doing her act, she carried a number of guns on her person, most of them with flashy ammunition or even comical attachment or noises involved, because her act was often quite comical. But as they looked at the harbor, there was the mix of people that had made Marseilles a hotbed of activity, both good and bad, since pre-Roman times. As a Mediterranean port, the city was part of the known world since before writing, and people from Africa, Asia, and all over Europe had gathered there for trade, intermingling, and at times, violence. Clara had announced that morning that England had changed its tune again and now was praising Germany to the heavens. Unfortunately, Germany had just decided that France was its closest ally. The circus had learned from her reports that the uneasy situation between the three countries changed almost every couple of weeks, though it was becoming more unstable. But life went on in Circus Europa, and the brilliant performing children were still at work preparing for the afternoons performance. Whether they worked in the sideshows, or would be in the center ring, the kids always had extensive training exercises each day and although they were paid and treated well, they were worked hard as well. Now each one was putting the finishing touches on preparing what they would do today.",

        "story": "chapter 1: near arrival. John Harmen, a magnate in the steel industry, was dead at the old age of 72. He had made a great deal of money over his life from a relatively obscure background. He had never been truly poor, but he had only in his later life been one of the silver spoon crowd. It was 1934, but despite the economic disaster that had ravaged the country, he had been wise and had remained one of the few that had been unhurt on Black Tuesday, October 29. He wanted a final gathering from those who had hovered around his money for so long, so he had stipulated in his will that they stay a couple of days at his old mansion before they got their rewards for their fidelity, kindness, or received what was due to them from family obligation. Among the mourners and hopeful benificiaries was Bella Welmer, a young wavy-haired blonde almost young enough to have been Harmen'sgranddaughter. She had been his fianc and now stood to get a lot. She had once been what the Romans would have called a legacy hunter, and what people in these days would call a gold-digger. But those who knew her knew that had changed. Though she had just been a greedy teenager looking for an easy way to sit in the lap of luxury, she had come to truly love John Harmen. She openly admitted to her mercenary wishes before, and was the first to criticize herself for them, and meant every word, but she was still here. Another was Lizzy Harkness, a dark-haired woman who was the daughter of one of Harmen's old fishing buddies. Quieter and softer than Bella but decidedly melancholic, it was hard to tell which of them was more beautiful or more likeable. Her father was good friends with Harmen and had died a few weeks before. She wasn't after the money and was here by strict respect. She was a working woman who mourned her father's loss far more than she cared for what she might get. There was also her brother Charlie and Mr. Preston, a teacher Harmen had hired in secret to give Lizzy an educational leg up where her schooling was incomplete. He very clearly had other things on his mind when he looked at the dark girl, but he taught the girl with great skill, even though watching them brought one to wonder who was the more intelligent of the two as Lizzy was unmistakably clever while Preston was what one would call a \"know-nothing know-it-all\" who lacked any real sense and had a lot less learning than he claimed he did. There was also Mr. Jacob Goldduster, a man who was one of the least corruptible people Harmen had ever known and a guy who had always been dependable to do what he could for those less fortunate. He didn't want the money really, but he respected Harmen's wishes. There was also Mr. Peter Venus, a man who seemed very worldly and wise, and who was very handsome. He was a man who really liked the house and was constantly peering into corners, though he never quite said what he was looking for. Learned and suave, the man was beloved by the old Man and a good friend of Goldduster. Also, last and certainly least was Mr. Smiddy. Smiddy was a man badly injured in the first world war, moving about on a peg leg and ranting at all he saw. Unlike Bella, he was an unashamed golddiggger and was quick to claim he wanted the money whenever an opportunity showed itself. He constantly carried a copy of \"The decline and fall of the Roman Empire\" which he read from noisily and obnoxiously, much to the shegrin of all present. All would be glad when this guy got his share and left. All of these were here when the others arrived. Others that inspired fear, as the thoughts watched and waited, wanting out, though it was not yet time. These new ones were more powerful and wise than any before, and though the thinkers did not know why they feared, what they had done for centuries untold might be being brought to an end.",

He told her this in the hospital gift shop, toying with a sequined sock that Virginia recognized as a Christmas ornament.

She waves it angrily when Carol Truitt comes in and tries to pull back the quilt.\n“How about a walk outside?” Carol says. “Some fresh air?”\nVirginia turns her head to look out the window, maple branches against the sky like cracks in a glazed plate.\n“Just a quick walk down to the lake?”\n“No.”\nCarol lies down on the bed. She puts her arm around Virginia’s waist, bringing her frosted hair to the pillow, grains of nut from a cookie between her teeth.\nVirginia surprises herself: she wants this warmth. She wants skin and breath. She allows her back to be scratched, her hair to be smoothed. She decides to be Leslie instead of herself. No one will notice.\n“Virginia?”\n“I said no. I’m not going outside.”\n“I know.” Then Carol says, “The hardest part must be what that doctor told you.”\nVirginia opens her eyes, reentering the childless world, the sheets with their smell of husband, the ranch house built for four, holding fifty, soon to be holding two. The hardest part must be what the doctor told you. Of course Carol knows. The whole congregation knows that Dr. Hagan said he could help Leslie easily with a blood transfusion. With only a moment’s hesitation, Roger said no, handing Dr. Hagan tracts and brochures about Jehovah’s Witnesses and their stance on blood. To Jehovah, blood is as loathsome as war, as untruths, as plastic spider limbs. Roger told Virginia that to allow Leslie a blood transfusion would destroy their chance for a life in paradise. He told her this in the hospital gift shop, toying with a sequined sock that Virginia recognized as a Christmas ornament. If Roger had looked at the thing in his hand he would have dropped it, and he would have washed his hands to rid them of sinful traces.\n“Just thank God you had her,” Carol says now. “Thank God you had her at all.”\nYes: thank God. Thank God you have a whole congregation in your dim ranch house with a useless, empty bedroom, where you will later find Leslie’s hidden drawings of unicorns, which Roger disallows because they are supernormal creatures and suggest a way of thinking that supersedes Witness doctrine. Thank God you know that you will see Leslie again, you will, when she is resurrected after Armageddon, when the world returns to its original, perfect state.",

        "writing_prompt": "After the loss of her daughter, Virginia Rothery struggles to reconcile her grief with her faith, surrounded by a congregation offering comfort she’s not sure she can accept. What happens when belief collides with unbearable loss?",
        "story": "Raised a Jehovah’s Witness, Virginia Rothery has never had a birthday cake. Today, in memoriam of her daughter, her congregation arrives with Lord and Lady Baltimores, with red velvets, black forests, and hummingbirds.\nToday the Rotherys’ ranch house is so crowded that Roger opens every window, despite Virginia’s head cold. There is some debate, anyway, about whether her nose is streaming from illness or from grief.\nLeslie Jean Rothery, born two weeks early, had a habit of what Roger called roughhousing. She was anemically pale. Her blond hair was thin and tentative, an afterthought of her body. At school she was called L.J. At school she was mocked for her religious principles—she could not attend the Christmas play, she could not drop eggs in blue dye each spring—but she was admired for her athleticism, which brimmed frustratingly throughout math and science, which burst beautifully in sprints and double Dutch. Roger made her learn to sew when she was nine, the last year of her life, because she tore almost all the clothing she owned. Roughhousing.\nPerhaps this is how Roger remembers Leslie: foxglove blooms of blood on her elbows and knees, face contorting at the sight of fruit salad, howling when her spider costume was dismembered on the night of Halloween. Leslie had received the costume from a school friend. Clipping the acrylic legs with shears, Roger had said, “Don’t you understand that Halloween is a pagan practice?”\nNo, Leslie did not understand.\nAs for Virginia, the only image she can recall is that of her daughter asleep and unsuspecting in the backseat of the car, a car soon to receive a heavy steel blow from a purple pickup with Idaho plates, map on the dash, its driver lost—again—this time in Lake of the Meek, Montana. A single woman still getting used to a shift stick, bleary with beer and divorce, driving straight into the intersection of Thoroughfare and Locust Road.\nThat wasn’t the end. The ambulance, the kind paramedics, calling Leslie sweetheart, asking her questions, all of which she answered: Leslie Jean Rothery. No, my head doesn’t hurt. Yes, I can lift this arm. I live at 37 Thistle Bend. Then she was out. That wasn’t the end, either.\nA macaroon appears with such proximity to Virginia’s mouth that she eats it, even though she hates coconut. All the shoes in her house glisten with cemetery mud. She cries for several minutes before Carol Truitt, one of the sisters from the congregation, comes over with a wad of tissues. The tissues must have come from Carol’s purse, because Virginia doesn’t buy the scented pastel kind. She buys discount brands, in bulk. It is expensive to raise even one child.\nWhen she spills sherry down the front of her dress, Virginia knows what to do: she goes to the bathroom, which is cleaner than it has ever been. The faucets sparkle in the cold sunshine. Someone washed this faucet; someone buffed the water taps. Virginia weeps in gratitude for a minute before she begins to unhook the shower curtain, thinking, Isn’t this what I came in here for? On the sink, Leslie’s toothbrush is upside down in the holder. Virginia brings it to her lips. She brings it with her down the hall, into her bedroom, and into her bed.

        "story": "He has his hands on Nii’s throat, and this time I do not stop them. They’re fighting over the last sugarcane, and Nii has it held tightly between his teeth, the juice from the cane dripping down his shorts. I am more concerned about how many more days he’ll be wearing the shorts unwashed, with its stain, than Ayikwe choking him to death. As if trapped inside a curse, my brothers and I have, since Mother’s passing, tasted famine in seasons of abundance. They call it a taboo—that a woman will go into labor and lose her life, especially when the child survives. “How is it possible that the same channel of life can know death?” they’ll say to one another. “The baby must have sucked out her last breath.” Sometimes they’ll curse and plead their favor, “Chai! Between my dead body and a cursed child, may God choose me.” And hence the banishment of my family.\nThey did not come chasing us out of our home with machetes, as I’ve been told of the past. But the signs were evident that they wanted us gone. At my kiosk in the market central, a scarecrow had been planted, its ripped white shirt besmirched with rotten tomatoes. The boys wondered why none of their friends would play with them. Once a boy in the neighborhood said Ayikwe was just a sacrificed clot of blood, and Ayikwe responded by digging his tiny fist into the boy’s cheek. A nightmare also kept repeating itself: that while we slept, townspeople gathered around our hut and, circling us in silence, lit a match. They set us on fire and lifted up their hands in thanksgiving. There was never smoke, just our cries filling the air. I couldn’t let that happen, and so in the first week of August, we folded everything we owned, which wasn’t much, into two sacks, and with a six-month-old baby strapped to my back, we made our way through the farms and into the outskirts of the village.\nNii is six and Ayikwe just turned eleven. For his birthday I read him Mother’s favorite prayer, which we all know by heart, days spent kneeling on a mat speaking the words slowly, rehearsed and without meaning. He insists I read it, saying, “You sound just like Ma. It is comfort.”\n“Comforting,” I say and begin to read from the back of an envelope that contains Bible verses and written prayers to God:\nLord, make me an instrument of your peace:\nwhere there is hatred, let me sow love;\nwhere there is injury, pardon;\nwhere there is doubt, faith;\nwhere there is despair, hope;\nwhere there is darkness, light;\nwhere there is sadness, joy.\nO divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek\nto be consoled as to console,\nto be understood as to understand,\nto be loved as to love.\nFor it is in giving that we receive,\nit is in pardoning that we are pardoned,\nand it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen.\n“But I don’t want to die,” Nii says, and I smile at him, the baby’s head resting easy on my chest. We named him Joseph. Actually, Ayikwe did, after his favorite Bible character. I didn’t object. At the time, I was spending days and nights in the clinic, signing papers I didn’t understand and wishing everything to be over. It was a relief to come back home with a baby who already had a name picked out and a coat of many colors, a faded Ankara cloth my mother owned. Sometimes I wonder if Joseph will be the beam of light, the one who rises above the storm and saves us from drowning. At the back of my mind, although I resist thinking such things, I toy with the idea of selling him, although I’m sure no one will pay for a womb’s curse. I know I’ll be sorry for harboring such thoughts. Nothing would be the same without him, but, frankly, selling him would be the best thing to happen to the boys and me. We could return home, just the three of us. I could have my kiosk in the market again and Ayikwe could grow maize on the farm. We could eat and laugh and be accepted.\nYou would think that by fifteen, life had dealt me enough, given me my share of its troubles—leaving school to trade in the market with my mother and coming home to cook for a family, which reduced my life to servitude. And now to be responsible for my brothers’ lives when I can barely carry my own is something I never wanted.\nWe’ve been in the woods twelve days. A meandering stream froths beside us. The boys have dug out groundnut and found a dead fish or two they could make nothing of. I’ve eaten very little. For Joseph, I pick green leaves and grind them between my palms and force it down his mouth. He spits most of it out. I can hear the boys splashing their legs in the stream, and I allow myself to weep for the first time since everything. It’s a private mourning; I grieve the loss of my mother, the cruel townspeople, and my tired heart. When the day winds down, clouds stretch above us, expanding like an inflated body. I do not know what makes me do it, but I open up the envelope and pull out a letter. It is dated January 2003. Some lines have been crossed out and some shaded deeply. I wonder what kind of prayer said to God is revocable. What happens to the receipts? We swallow back our words out of fear and like to believe God keeps no record. I cannot think of why Mother will want some prayers returned to her, but I know it is no way a lack of faith. Yet, here in these letters, she bleeds a softness I’ve never known: God, life is so cursed out here. Do you hear me? The darkness comes after me and I run. Look, I am breathless. I am salt and light of the earth but also scared. Please stop the chase.\nAnyone who knows grief knows mourning before death: we prepare for sorrow before it finds us, we wrap our arms around our bodies, rocking back and forth in the silence. In the night Joseph leaves my side. He crawls around his brothers and heads downward, as if being summoned. I keep my eyes tightly shut and try to think about many things—Mother finding him and taking him away, the stream disappearing, Joseph’s hand on my face soiled with mud, pulling me to himself. My heart thumps against my chest with heavy resignation, pinning me down. I know when he reaches the stream. The stillness in the air is sharp and frightening. I can hear myself breathing. I know when he lets himself into the cold water because he begins to cry, loudly, wailing. Nii stirs slightly, awakened by the noise, and I stretch my arm to pat him on the back, hushing him and whispering, “It’s nothing, now, just a bad dream.” I know when the war ends because the crying stops, and a strange calmness settles over me. Trembling, I open my eyes, and the sky, an empty, borderless page, looks down at me, and I dare God to finally speak.",

They call it a taboo—that a woman will go into labor and lose her life, especially when the child survives. “How is it possible that the same channel of life can know death?” they’ll say to one another. “The baby must have sucked out her last breath.” Sometimes they’ll curse and plead their favor, “Chai! Between my dead body and a cursed child, may God choose me.” And hence the banishment of my family.\nThey did not come chasing us out of our home with machetes, as I’ve been told of the past. But the signs were evident that they wanted us gone. At my kiosk in the market central, a scarecrow had been planted, its ripped white shirt besmirched with rotten tomatoes. The boys wondered why none of their friends would play with them. Once a boy in the neighborhood said Ayikwe was just a sacrificed clot of blood, and Ayikwe responded by digging his tiny fist into the boy’s cheek. A nightmare also kept repeating itself: that while we slept, townspeople gathered around our hut and, circling us in silence, lit a match. They set us on fire and lifted up their hands in thanksgiving. There was never smoke, just our cries filling the air. I couldn’t let that happen, and so in the first week of August, we folded everything we owned, which wasn’t much, into two sacks, and with a six-month-old baby strapped to my back, we made our way through the farms and into the outskirts of the village.\nNii is six and Ayikwe just turned eleven. For his birthday I read him Mother’s favorite prayer, which we all know by heart, days spent kneeling on a mat speaking the words slowly, rehearsed and without meaning. He insists I read it, saying, “You sound just like Ma. It is comfort.”\n“Comforting,” I say and begin to read from the back of an envelope that contains Bible verses and written prayers to God:\nLord, make me an instrument of your peace:\nwhere there is hatred, let me sow love;\nwhere there is injury, pardon;\nwhere there is doubt, faith;\nwhere there is despair, hope;\nwhere there is darkness, light;\nwhere there is sadness, joy.\nO divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek\nto be consoled as to console,\nto be understood as to understand,\nto be loved as to love.\nFor it is in giving that we receive,\nit is in pardoning that we are pardoned,\nand it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen.\n“But I don’t want to die,” Nii says, and I smile at him, the baby’s head resting easy on my chest. We named him Joseph. Actually, Ayikwe did, after his favorite Bible character. I didn’t object. At the time, I was spending days and nights in the clinic, signing papers I didn’t understand and wishing everything to be over. It was a relief to come back home with a baby who already had a name picked out and a coat of many colors, a faded Ankara cloth my mother owned. Sometimes I wonder if Joseph will be the beam of light, the one who rises above the storm and saves us from drowning. At the back of my mind, although I resist thinking such things, I toy with the idea of selling him, although I’m sure no one will pay for a womb’s curse. I know I’ll be sorry for harboring such thoughts. Nothing would be the same without him, but, frankly, selling him would be the best thing to happen to the boys and me. We could return home, just the three of us. I could have my kiosk in the market again and Ayikwe could grow maize on the farm. We could eat and laugh and be accepted.\nYou would think that by fifteen, life had dealt me enough, given me my share of its troubles—leaving school to trade in the market with my mother and coming home to cook for a family, which reduced my life to servitude. And now to be responsible for my brothers’ lives when I can barely carry my own is something I never wanted.\nWe’ve been in the woods twelve days. A meandering stream froths beside us. The boys have dug out groundnut and found a dead fish or two they could make nothing of. I’ve eaten very little. For Joseph, I pick green leaves and grind them between my palms and force it down his mouth. He spits most of it out. I can hear the boys splashing their legs in the stream, and I allow myself to weep for the first time since everything. It’s a private mourning; I grieve the loss of my mother, the cruel townspeople, and my tired heart. When the day winds down, clouds stretch above us, expanding like an inflated body. I do not know what makes me do it, but I open up the envelope and pull out a letter. It is dated January 2003. Some lines have been crossed out and some shaded deeply. I wonder what kind of prayer said to God is revocable. What happens to the receipts? We swallow back our words out of fear and like to believe God keeps no record. I cannot think of why Mother will want some prayers returned to her, but I know it is no way a lack of faith. Yet, here in these letters, she bleeds a softness I’ve never known: God, life is so cursed out here. Do you hear me? The darkness comes after me and I run. Look, I am breathless. I am salt and light of the earth but also scared. Please stop the chase.\nAnyone who knows grief knows mourning before death: we prepare for sorrow before it finds us, we wrap our arms around our bodies, rocking back and forth in the silence. In the night Joseph leaves my side. He crawls around his brothers and heads downward, as if being summoned. I keep my eyes tightly shut and try to think about many things—Mother finding him and taking him away, the stream disappearing, Joseph’s hand on my face soiled with mud, pulling me to himself. My heart thumps against my chest with heavy resignation, pinning me down. I know when he reaches the stream. The stillness in the air is sharp and frightening. I can hear myself breathing. I know when he lets himself into the cold water because he begins to cry, loudly, wailing. Nii stirs slightly, awakened by the noise, and I stretch my arm to pat him on the back, hushing him and whispering, “It’s nothing, now, just a bad dream.” I know when the war ends because the crying stops, and a strange calmness settles over me. Trembling, I open my eyes, and the sky, an empty, borderless page, looks down at me, and I dare God to finally speak.",

        "story": "I wish I could promise that if you walked away I would close my door to you forever, that I wouldn’t linger in the moment between your turning away and my locking up—it’s like that millisecond during takeoff when your seat has yet to catch you and you know how it feels to be weightless. I admit that even without reason to hope, I would continue to leave the key under the mat and the front-porch light on, to listen for the sound of your car pulling into the driveway, though I would never admit this.\nI would habitually check the mail for your letters, which used to arrive sporadically, often conveniently on rainy days. Despite my best efforts, I would bump into you among ordinary objects: coffeepot, toothpaste, Wrangler jeans, popcorn, making my most routine days painfully full of you, yet equally empty. These would be my stumbling blocks, painting bruises up and down my shins.\nSometimes I lose track of you, and I am left with the confused desperation that comes when looking for a reserved seat in a dark theater. I search for your face in crowds at the airport, scouring those gathered at departure gates. Though I am constantly awaiting your arrival, you always seem to be leaving. I find it troubling how much more pronounced your departures are in my memory, as if arrivals and departures didn’t come in matching pairs, like socks.\nWith every door that opens, I look up, half expecting to see you walking over to me, carrying my coffee just like on the winter Sundays we spent together. Slowly, I am realizing that I can’t affectionately call them “the good old days” because they are the exception, not the rule. Sometimes I hear myself saying, “On Sundays we used to read for hours,” when it was more like, “One Sunday we read for hours.”\nI am afraid that you’ve made up your mind to go for good. You keep up the conversation just enough to fill the empty space as you awkwardly pull on your sweater, your winter scarf, hat, coat, and gloves, your bag hoisted onto one shoulder. You wait for me to show you the door, as if you are a stranger and don’t know where to find it yourself. You lean in to kiss me because that is what we do when we say goodbye.\nI watch as you gradually coil in on yourself routinely, mechanically, like a snake tucking itself away for winter. Sometimes I am afraid that you are inviting me into indifference, the limbo that exists in airports and elevators, to become one of those old friends you don’t see or talk to often but you still call “friend.” You forget to let me know that you made it home safely.\nYou call me on FaceTime tonight, stoned out of your mind after working yourself into the ground; you rarely reserve much of yourself for conversation these days.

        "story": "My mom picked me up from the airport at 11:58 p.m., well past her bedtime. I hopped into my sister’s gold Honda CR-V, which my mom was driving because her car was in the shop, and found her listening to an old cassette, a recording of Helen and me from when we were little.\n“Listen to this,” she said smiling, and turned up the volume.\n“I was trying to record you saying ‘Dada,’ but you never quite get there.”\nThe recording went on for about twenty minutes, a seven-month-old me cooing happily, a three-year-old Helen with a three-year-old voice. “Come on, Abbie, let’s go,” she said, her tiny voice full of sass and spunk. Hearing the recording, my chest swelled in expectation, like watching a movie I’d seen a long time ago, remembering how the story would change—by no means a tragedy but without the tied-up resolution everyone expected. I wanted to take Helen’s three-year-old shoulders and pull her into a firm hug. “Do you have any idea how important you are?”\nIn the recording she began to cough, and our mom, with a hint of frustration, said, “Gracious!” Hearing it twenty years later, I wondered how many consecutive nights she’d gone without sleep. She was painting a bedroom, trying to be a good mother, wife, Catholic.\n“Why did you say ‘gracious’ like that?” Helen mimicked our mom’s slight exasperation, filling it in with anger.\nMom winced at the recording, and I’m sure it was painful to hear her twenty-seven-year-old exhaustion caricatured by a three-year-old.\nThe tape whirred, then came to a stop with a gentle click. We drove through empty Memphis suburbs in comfortable silence, made our way along Raleigh LaGrange Road, finally rolling into the dark driveway, alive with summer air. The world was fragrant. Damp earth, cool grass, warm, heavy. Home. I stepped into the brightly lit kitchen, made a piece of toast, and went to bed.\nI didn’t sleep as long as I’d hoped. Travel disrupted whatever rhythm there’d been in my body, and I was up by seven.\n“Do you want me to take you to pick up your car?” I offered, searching for a way to fill the empty morning.\nWe climbed back into the CR-V, and Mom pulled a 1999 Ben Harper cassette from the stack on the center console. Looking out the passenger window at the flat, hot summer, I found myself singing along. The window caught glints of morning sun and offered snapshots of the girl I must have been once but now hardly recognized. She had a messy middle part, blonde peach-fuzz legs, and knew all the words to “Steal My Kisses.”\nWe pulled into the entrance of the Nissan dealership off of Covington, which has better service than the one in Collierville, and Mom gathered her belongings: a cross-body purse full of pens, hand lotion, Kleenex, little glass hearts, and a St. Christopher medal; a 20-ounce thermos of steaming Emperor’s Cloud tea, the green metallic paint chipping around the lip; a set of Bose headphones draped casually around her neck like a piece of statement jewelry. She held it all so naturally, each item an extension of her.\nThe guy helping us ushered her into her newly serviced car, and I climbed over to the driver’s side of the CR-V, adjusting the mirrors and seat. Pulling out into the right lane of morning traffic, I fumbled for the volume knob on the stereo. I skipped a handful of Ben Harper songs, listening for something different, though I wasn’t sure what. The tape flipped over, and the song that filled the car took me back to the purple-gray time of Helen’s teenage depression, when she never left her room, didn’t talk or eat much–somewhere I hadn’t been in quite a while. A heaviness sank into my shoulders and under my eyes. I felt alone again, a stark contrast to our warm infant closeness. The song carried me into the backseat of our mom’s navy-blue minivan, raindrops racing to the edge of the window, losing themselves in one another, while I imagined the wild-eyed woman in the song in her white nightgown, mourning, lonely, desperate. The sadness and fear almost swallowed me, and remembering it made me drive faster, as if I could lose it in the twists and turns of Raleigh LaGrange Road.\n“Really, we’re all just lonely for ourselves,” my mom said matter-of-factly, when later that day I mentioned the hollowness of that song.",

        "writing_prompt": "You’re driving home at dawn after a sleepless night with old friends, the quiet hum of the road and the soft blue sunrise stirring memories of someone beside you who feels both distant and achingly familiar. What do you say, or leave unsaid?",
        "story": "You have always seemed important to me. Always the tall one, the quiet tall one. The thoughtful tall one. Eyes honest and blue, sometimes overwhelming like the stormy Pacific; hair disheveled, honey-gold, like the light that comes just before sunset; freckles spattered across face and shoulders like stars that have been carefully counted and then forgotten, left to their own rambunctious devices to build constellations. These were not the things I first noticed about you.\nRather, I took notice of the way you talked. An almost Southern accent that you reined in just before a remnant of Georgia or Alabama slid off the tongue; the way you never seemed to feel the need to fill the empty space with meaningless conversation; the way you sometimes leaned forward onto countertops, propping your chin on the heel of your hand, level with whoever had provoked your slight side smile.\nI took notice of how it felt to be near you, of the way that you drove, the music you played in your car, how you took your coffee. I noticed the books that you read, the stories with which you chose to fill your mind. You made me remember the smell of damp moss and Robin Hood. The little lost prince, and sunlit trees.\nI liked remembering these things. Somehow I felt like I’d known you before. I still feel like I’ve known you before—somewhere in the distant past, fifty years or eons ago. Your soul feels old and familiar like a book that opens to my favorite pages.\nOnce I drove your car home after an entire night spent in the dark—a group of us trudging along to the top of a mountain at what must have been a vertical incline. We made it, although the only view awaiting us at the peak was that of the stars in the night sky, which we could have seen just as well at sea level. We laughed at how ridiculous we had been and ate dark chocolate dipped in peanut butter and shielded our faces from the wind.\nWe hadn’t slept, the handful of us. I was the most awake, so I drove us all home. It was 5:00 a.m. and the sun had just started stirring, verging on getting up and starting the day, on waking the world with a quiet peek over the mountains. We were fifty miles away from home and we were in your car. You sat shotgun, the other two asleep in the back seat.\nI remember the stillness, the quietness, the blueness, the haziness. The whole world seemed groggy eyed, gentle; maybe asking for five more minutes of darkness. I remember feeling you beside me and how normal it seemed; I’d learned your rhythms long ago and found them easy. Beside you, I felt like I was home again after spending too long abroad. I had a feeling of déjà vu, like you were an old soul from eons ago who had returned to me once before in a similar way. I could have cried because you were so close to me.\nThe asphalt stretched out before us, swallowed up by the mountains in the distance. I made slow sweeping turns and gentle stops, watching heads lulling in the rearview mirror, and sometimes I stole glances over at you.\n“How are you?” I wanted to know, and something about the dewy world around us made me feel like we could start fresh with honest and sincere questions. How are you, since we haven’t really spoken in over a year, since you used to be relevant to my life and I to yours, since I still miss you. And what I really want to know is if you ever think about that time when we at least pretended to be close to one another, and whether you were faking it, and whether I was faking it. And what I want to know even more is if you think you will ever allow me to know you again, and whether you will ever want to know me again.\n“I’m good.” You almost said more but stopped yourself.\nYou looked over at me, and I smiled because I recognized something in your eyes. You had grown older and taller, your shoulders broader, your hair longer, but your eyes were the same. And then I played a song that I knew you’d recognize. Maybe it was a bit unfair—you hadn’t asked for a trip down memory lane—but I was prompted by the blue sunrise and all the things I wanted to say but couldn’t.\n“I like when you can see the layers of mountains—I can count seven,” you said.\nI turned the music down, gripped the steering wheel a bit tighter, and responded, “I count nine—wait no, maybe just seven. I’m not sure, really; I’ve never tried counting them before. I like how some of them are almost transparent, like smoke.”\n“Me too—I like the colors.”\nI waited for you to elaborate, to say something vaguely poetic, introspective, important, anything.\n“Can you believe he has to work today?” you asked, gesturing with your eyes to one of the heads dozed off in the backseat. Just like that, our moment passed. The next song came on.\nWe drove the rest of the way home in relatively comfortable silence. I wondered if the blue sunrise was just a product of global warming.\nAs I rolled into my driveway, rocks crunched beneath the tires, usually a welcome sound, but now it made me ache. I sat back and took a deep breath. Then I collected my things and opened the door.\n“Drive safe,” I said, stepping out of the car. I avoided your eyes as I swung the door shut. “Let me know you make it home safely.”\n“Will do.”\nI watched as you slid over to the driver’s seat and adjusted the mirrors and radio. As you slowly swung out of the driveway, the sunglasses hanging from your rearview mirror swayed in time to the song stuck in my head, and sunshine glinted off the silver of your wheels. I stood there, my hand held in a half wave, then turned toward the back door of the big blue house.",

These were not the things I first noticed about you.\nRather, I took notice of the way you talked. An almost Southern accent that you reined in just before a remnant of Georgia or Alabama slid off the tongue; the way you never seemed to feel the need to fill the empty space with meaningless conversation; the way you sometimes leaned forward onto countertops, propping your chin on the heel of your hand, level with whoever had provoked your slight side smile.\nI took notice of how it felt to be near you, of the way that you drove, the music you played in your car, how you took your coffee. I noticed the books that you read, the stories with which you chose to fill your mind. You made me remember the smell of damp moss and Robin Hood. The little lost prince, and sunlit trees.\nI liked remembering these things. Somehow I felt like I’d known you before. I still feel like I’ve known you before—somewhere in the distant past, fifty years or eons ago. Your soul feels old and familiar like a book that opens to my favorite pages.\nOnce I drove your car home after an entire night spent in the dark—a group of us trudging along to the top of a mountain at what must have been a vertical incline.

We laughed at how ridiculous we had been and ate dark chocolate dipped in peanut butter and shielded our faces from the wind.\nWe hadn’t slept, the handful of us. I was the most awake, so I drove us all home. It was 5:00 a.m. and the sun had just started stirring, verging on getting up and starting the day, on waking the world with a quiet peek over the mountains. We were fifty miles away from home and we were in your car. You sat shotgun, the other two asleep in the back seat.\nI remember the stillness, the quietness, the blueness, the haziness. The whole world seemed groggy eyed, gentle; maybe asking for five more minutes of darkness. I remember feeling you beside me and how normal it seemed; I’d learned your rhythms long ago and found them easy. Beside you, I felt like I was home again after spending too long abroad. I had a feeling of déjà vu, like you were an old soul from eons ago who had returned to me once before in a similar way. I could have cried because you were so close to me.\nThe asphalt stretched out before us, swallowed up by the mountains in the distance. I made slow sweeping turns and gentle stops, watching heads lulling in the rearview mirror, and sometimes I stole glances over at you.\n“How are you?” I wanted to know, and something about the dewy world around us made me feel like we could start fresh with honest and sincere questions. How are you, since we haven’t really spoken in over a year, since you used to be relevant to my life and I to yours, since I still miss you. And what I really want to know is if you ever think about that time when we at least pretended to be close to one another, and whether you were faking it, and whether I was faking it. And what I want to know even more is if you think you will ever allow me to know you again, and whether you will ever want to know me again.\n“I’m good.” You almost said more but stopped yourself.\nYou looked over at me, and I smiled because I recognized something in your eyes. You had grown older and taller, your shoulders broader, your hair longer, but your eyes were the same. And then I played a song that I knew you’d recognize. Maybe it was a bit unfair—you hadn’t asked for a trip down memory lane—but I was prompted by the blue sunrise and all the things I wanted to say but couldn’t.\n“I like when you can see the layers of mountains—I can count seven,” you said.\nI turned the music down, gripped the steering wheel a bit tighter, and responded, “I count nine—wait no, maybe just seven. I’m not sure, really; I’ve never tried counting them before. I like how some of them are almost transparent, like smoke.”\n“Me too—I like the colors.”\nI waited for you to elaborate, to say something vaguely poetic, introspective, important, anything.\n“Can you believe he has to work today?” you asked, gesturing with your eyes to one of the heads dozed off in the backseat. Just like that, our moment passed. The next song came on.\nWe drove the rest of the way home in relatively comfortable silence. I wondered if the blue sunrise was just a product of global warming.\nAs I rolled into my driveway, rocks crunched beneath the tires, usually a welcome sound, but now it made me ache. I sat back and took a deep breath. Then I collected my things and opened the door.\n“Drive safe,” I said, stepping out of the car. I avoided your eyes as I swung the door shut. “Let me know you make it home safely.”\n“Will do.”\nI watched as you slid over to the driver’s seat and adjusted the mirrors and radio. As you slowly swung out of the driveway, the sunglasses hanging from your rearview mirror swayed in time to the song stuck in my head, and sunshine glinted off the silver of your wheels.

        "story": "Between the exterior wall and the Sheetrock, a waterproofing layer was missing. The builders, in their defense, said that the layer had simply been forgotten about, not left out in an intentional move to save money. The building was faculty housing, occupied only by professors and their families. All but one professor were untenured. Half had kids under ten.\nThe layer had been found to be missing during a city inspection a decade ago. Repairs were put off for nine years. The school, as both employer and landlord, cited extreme busyness, and pointed out that, despite the missing barrier, no actual apartment floods had occurred. Year ten there was a global pandemic, but year ten was also the end of the remediation period, so construction had to start. The contractor hosted a virtual meeting to explain the many phases of the process. The slide show had several typos. “Demolition” became “demonition”; no apartment number was listed correctly. How disruptive would all this be, the dance professor asked, and the cherub-faced blond contractor’s spokesman answered politely, “Very much so, ma’am.” Then the chemistry professor chimed in about particulates. If the entire brick façade was being torn off, what was being done about air-quality control? The chemistry professor had small children. Small children had small lungs. The blond man said that they would tape over everyone’s windows. They would tape over the vents of everyone’s A.C.s. “So, no A.C.s or windows?” another professor asked. “All through summer, no opening windows or running A.C.s?” This professor, who taught biology and kept on the building’s rooftop a colony of honeybees, was not known to repeat himself. The blond man said that that was correct. And that the rooftop would be closed to accommodate the rigging, so the bee colony would have to be moved.\nTo better address the concerns of the tenants, a second virtual meeting was called, and predictably it went much worse.\nThe third virtual meeting was cancelled, and, a day later, scaffolding went up. Spaghetti-like ropes encased the building, and men in orange vests carrying hammer drills appeared on skinny platform lifts. Windows were covered with a neon-blue film that turned every room into an aquarium and gave tenants headaches. “No one’s complained about the blue film before,” the contractor said, though he then admitted to never having worked on an occupied building before. Clear film was procured four days later, the windows retaped.\nThe contractor did boast about having an on-site hygienist, a woman who was copied on e-mails but whom no one had met.\nFor three weeks, the noise level was terrible, from nine to five, Monday through Friday, with no pause. The new writing professor was trying to finish a novel but could only write things like “So this is what it must feel like to live inside a tooth that a dentist is trying to drill.” The tooth occupied her thoughts nightly. She hadn’t gone to the dentist in years. Red dust coated the window film; plumes of smoke were seen. The religion professor brought up the plumes, how, from her red-tinted window, they seemed cloudlike even. The contractor replied immediately, copying the hygienist, to clarify that what the professor saw was not a plume or anything close to a cloud but a puff of smoke being aggrandized by the wind.\nEach morning, there was an e-mail update explaining which units would be most directly affected that day, though the apartment numbers were still incorrect. So, to figure out if you were truly going to be affected, you had to watch for where the huge mechanical pulley on the roof was dropping lifts. Glancing up at the building from the outside, the ceramics professor was reminded of his childhood, and that unwinnable arcade game with a bin of plush toys and a slippery claw. He was on the corner waiting for Mister Softee. He was waiting for Mister Softee because his three boys, who were inside, had told him to text them when the truck was in sight.\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\nThe technical term for what was missing was flashing—an embedded sheet of metal that prevents moisture from penetrating a building’s walls. Flashing is particularly important at junctions, around windows, vent pipes, etc. No one thought anymore of the word’s other meanings—committing indecent exposure, for example, running buck naked across a green field in a Superman cape, as the six-year-old son of the dance professor had done during his first soccer game.\nInclement weather set in one weekend, a hurricane muscling through from the south. Rain fell for three days and nights, and the history professor, whose apartment was right below the pulley, said it sounded as if it were raining within the walls. Could there be a leak? He sent the company an audio clip. The company responded a minute later. Leaks were impossible. They had sealed all the leaks because that was what they were here to do. Below the history professor lived a math professor, who all weekend had been collecting the water that had funnelled into her office through the ceiling. She used a one-gallon bucket, and she’d emptied the bucket into the bathtub five times. The math professor was married to the East Asian Studies professor. Not that ironically, the former was Asian and the latter white. Between gallons three and four, the former had drafted an angry e-mail to the school, but then stared at her unnuanced message. She worried about being the squeaky wheel, when she and her husband had upcoming third-year reviews. Still, she asked if he could rewrite and send the e-mail, given both his nuance skills and the fact that the administration might take him more seriously. That would be taking advantage of his privilege, he thought, and shook his head, but encouraged her to send the e-mail, since she should feel empowered to and he was never going to stand in her way. A quarrel about feminism followed. No e-mail was sent.\nOver text, some tenants hatched a plan. They would implore the one tenured resident—an economics professor—to declare war by sending the e-mail and hiring a lawyer who would then launch the war by suing the school. But the economics professor was away. He’d left for Crete at the start of the construction, on a private jet owned by one of his friends.\nWithin the building, the audio clip went viral and was forwarded anonymously to the project’s architect. The architect soon replied in an e-mail about how a pulley system of that weight might have shifted the building’s foundation, creating fractures, but this problem was, unfortunately, beyond the company’s scope. They dealt only with façades. Another company did foundations.\nThe next weekend, another storm front came through. Seven gallons, the math professor counted. In the history professor’s bedroom, a paint bubble, the height and width of a man, appeared on the wall overnight. He poked the bubble, afraid that it might actually be a person, like his department chair, and was sprayed, drenched, in brown water.\nThe professors lamented in the laundry room. What kind of collective e-mail to send, and in what tone? A seven-hundred-word one was drafted, with bulleted questions for further discussion. The e-mail was edited down to three hundred words, then ballooned again to a thousand.\n“We must withhold rent,” the ethics professor said—a thought that gave the non-activist professors palpitations.\nThe walls of the water-filled units now felt spongy, and eventually a two-hundred-word e-mail was sent, signed by all the untenured professors, and ending with the sentence “We demand immediate action.” Within an hour, a fit young man arrived and handed everyone he met a business card. The card said that he was the vice-president of the company. The man noted the places where water was still seeping in. He said that there would likely be mold growth, and, should the mold be the color of soot, coal, or volcanic ash, they would need to call in the hygienist to culture it. Not all strains are toxic, he informed them. Some were perfectly O.K. In addition, he’d gone up to the roof and found no visible faults around the pulley system, so perhaps the leak was a preëxisting condition that had suddenly, coincidentally, got worse. “Things like this do happen,” he insisted, and added that, once the scaffolding was removed, the foundation would naturally rise up, against gravity, to its previous position. Then he tipped his hard hat at the professors and wished them a good day.\nSo construction went on unimpeded, and more storms came through, and more gallons were collected. Spores grew in the wet areas, none whose colors were quite right to be cultured. Rent was paid reliably; no more complaints were filed. In time, the professors all arrived at the same conclusion. Was the leak really that bad? On good days, it sounded like living next to a waterfall. Push through it, the way you did in grad school; then, once you get tenure, you can fly to Crete. ♦",

Clear film was procured four days later, the windows retaped.\nThe contractor did boast about having an on-site hygienist, a woman who was copied on e-mails but whom no one had met.\nFor three weeks, the noise level was terrible, from nine to five, Monday through Friday, with no pause. The new writing professor was trying to finish a novel but could only write things like “So this is what it must feel like to live inside a tooth that a dentist is trying to drill.” The tooth occupied her thoughts nightly. She hadn’t gone to the dentist in years. Red dust coated the window film; plumes of smoke were seen. The religion professor brought up the plumes, how, from her red-tinted window, they seemed cloudlike even. The contractor replied immediately, copying the hygienist, to clarify that what the professor saw was not a plume or anything close to a cloud but a puff of smoke being aggrandized by the wind.\nEach morning, there was an e-mail update explaining which units would be most directly affected that day, though the apartment numbers were still incorrect. So, to figure out if you were truly going to be affected, you had to watch for where the huge mechanical pulley on the roof was dropping lifts. Glancing up at the building from the outside, the ceramics professor was reminded of his childhood, and that unwinnable arcade game with a bin of plush toys and a slippery claw. He was on the corner waiting for Mister Softee. He was waiting for Mister Softee because his three boys, who were inside, had told him to text them when the truck was in sight.\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\nThe technical term for what was missing was flashing—an embedded sheet of metal that prevents moisture from penetrating a building’s walls. Flashing is particularly important at junctions, around windows, vent pipes, etc. No one thought anymore of the word’s other meanings—committing indecent exposure, for example, running buck naked across a green field in a Superman cape, as the six-year-old son of the dance professor had done during his first soccer game.\nInclement weather set in one weekend, a hurricane muscling through from the south. Rain fell for three days and nights, and the history professor, whose apartment was right below the pulley, said it sounded as if it were raining within the walls. Could there be a leak? He sent the company an audio clip. The company responded a minute later. Leaks were impossible. They had sealed all the leaks because that was what they were here to do. Below the history professor lived a math professor, who all weekend had been collecting the water that had funnelled into her office through the ceiling. She used a one-gallon bucket, and she’d emptied the bucket into the bathtub five times. The math professor was married to the East Asian Studies professor. Not that ironically, the former was Asian and the latter white. Between gallons three and four, the former had drafted an angry e-mail to the school, but then stared at her unnuanced message. She worried about being the squeaky wheel, when she and her husband had upcoming third-year reviews. Still, she asked if he could rewrite and send the e-mail, given both his nuance skills and the fact that the administration might take him more seriously. That would be taking advantage of his privilege, he thought, and shook his head, but encouraged her to send the e-mail, since she should feel empowered to and he was never going to stand in her way. A quarrel about feminism followed. No e-mail was sent.\nOver text, some tenants hatched a plan. They would implore the one tenured resident—an economics professor—to declare war by sending the e-mail and hiring a lawyer who would then launch the war by suing the school. But the economics professor was away. He’d left for Crete at the start of the construction, on a private jet owned by one of his friends.\nWithin the building, the audio clip went viral and was forwarded anonymously to the project’s architect. The architect soon replied in an e-mail about how a pulley system of that weight might have shifted the building’s foundation, creating fractures, but this problem was, unfortunately, beyond the company’s scope. They dealt only with façades. Another company did foundations.\nThe next weekend, another storm front came through. Seven gallons, the math professor counted. In the history professor’s bedroom, a paint bubble, the height and width of a man, appeared on the wall overnight. He poked the bubble, afraid that it might actually be a person, like his department chair, and was sprayed, drenched, in brown water.\nThe professors lamented in the laundry room. What kind of collective e-mail to send, and in what tone? A seven-hundred-word one was drafted, with bulleted questions for further discussion. The e-mail was edited down to three hundred words, then ballooned again to a thousand.\n“We must withhold rent,” the ethics professor said—a thought that gave the non-activist professors palpitations.\nThe walls of the water-filled units now felt spongy, and eventually a two-hundred-word e-mail was sent, signed by all the untenured professors, and ending with the sentence “We demand immediate action.” Within an hour, a fit young man arrived and handed everyone he met a business card. The card said that he was the vice-president of the company. The man noted the places where water was still seeping in. He said that there would likely be mold growth, and, should the mold be the color of soot, coal, or volcanic ash, they would need to call in the hygienist to culture it. Not all strains are toxic, he informed them. Some were perfectly O.K. In addition, he’d gone up to the roof and found no visible faults around the pulley system, so perhaps the leak was a preëxisting condition that had suddenly, coincidentally, got worse. “Things like this do happen,” he insisted, and added that, once the scaffolding was removed, the foundation would naturally rise up, against gravity, to its previous position. Then he tipped his hard hat at the professors and wished them a good day.\nSo construction went on unimpeded, and more storms came through, and more gallons were collected. Spores grew in the wet areas, none whose colors were quite right to be cultured. Rent was paid reliably; no more complaints were filed. In time, the professors all arrived at the same conclusion. Was the leak really that bad? On good days, it sounded like living next to a waterfall. Push through it, the way you did in grad school; then, once you get tenure, you can fly to Crete. ♦",

        "story": "Between the exterior wall and the Sheetrock, a waterproofing layer was missing. The builders, in their defense, said that the layer had simply been forgotten about, not left out in an intentional move to save money. The building was faculty housing, occupied only by professors and their families. All but one professor were untenured. Half had kids under ten.\nThe layer had been found to be missing during a city inspection a decade ago. Repairs were put off for nine years. The school, as both employer and landlord, cited extreme busyness, and pointed out that, despite the missing barrier, no actual apartment floods had occurred. Year ten there was a global pandemic, but year ten was also the end of the remediation period, so construction had to start. The contractor hosted a virtual meeting to explain the many phases of the process. The slide show had several typos. “Demolition” became “demonition”; no apartment number was listed correctly. How disruptive would all this be, the dance professor asked, and the cherub-faced blond contractor’s spokesman answered politely, “Very much so, ma’am.” Then the chemistry professor chimed in about particulates. If the entire brick façade was being torn off, what was being done about air-quality control? The chemistry professor had small children. Small children had small lungs. The blond man said that they would tape over everyone’s windows. They would tape over the vents of everyone’s A.C.s. “So, no A.C.s or windows?” another professor asked. “All through summer, no opening windows or running A.C.s?” This professor, who taught biology and kept on the building’s rooftop a colony of honeybees, was not known to repeat himself. The blond man said that that was correct. And that the rooftop would be closed to accommodate the rigging, so the bee colony would have to be moved.\nTo better address the concerns of the tenants, a second virtual meeting was called, and predictably it went much worse.\nThe third virtual meeting was cancelled, and, a day later, scaffolding went up. Spaghetti-like ropes encased the building, and men in orange vests carrying hammer drills appeared on skinny platform lifts. Windows were covered with a neon-blue film that turned every room into an aquarium and gave tenants headaches. “No one’s complained about the blue film before,” the contractor said, though he then admitted to never having worked on an occupied building before.

        "writing_prompt": "She’s a writer who thrives on crafting sentences; he’s a coder who excels at solving word puzzles. Their playful rivalry over language and logic sparks debates, games, and unexpected revelations—like whether \"onion\" is the perfect palindrome or if \"Y\" is truly a vowel.",
        "story": "He is better at words. She is better at sentences. Games they like to play involve the former, and he wins the vast majority of them the vast majority of the time. Debates they find themselves in involve the latter, and there hasn’t been an occasion (on record) of him winning one for many, many years.\nCrosswords, Scrabble, that new game with green and yellow squares, he excels at. Given six tries to guess a five-letter word, he is quicker to recall words without real vowels (she doesn’t support the idea that “Y” is a vowel), and he has the nerve to guess words with triple letters, like “fluff,” on the second try. Of course, she knows what fluff is. It’s either bullshit or the stuffing that comes out of cheap toys. But it’s not a word she would have guessed.\nIn defense of “Y” ’s vowelness, he asks, What about “lynx”?\nLynx? she replies, incredulous. When have you ever used that aloud? Oh, look, over there, that lynx is about to pounce and rip out my heart! She is certain that any person in such a scenario would use the word “bobcat.”\nWhat most infuriates her is the presumption that she must be a whiz at words given her vocation as a writer of books. She is gifted calendar crossword puzzles (yes, three hundred and sixty-five tiny crosswords, one sheet for each day) every December, and is often dragged into long bouts of Words with Friends. In one game, he scores more than seventy points with a well-placed “Q.” She loses that game soon enough and texts him, You’re always doing stuff like that, calculating the value of each word. But that’s how you play—those are the rules, he replies. She calls into question these rules: is the point system for letters really based on frequency, or is it some larger institutional metric of mind control? He repeats, But those are the rules. On her darkest of writing days, she takes the last sentence she wrote and tallies it up for points. She is immensely disappointed. Then she stares at those crossword calendars, and they stare back. The five she was gifted this holiday season, plus several from last year. They sit all over her desk like blind cats. Hundreds if not thousands of empty squares.\nHow to Solve Cryptic Crosswords\nShe wonders why she is so bad at word games and has convinced herself that it’s because she knows too many words. Also, writers don’t like to be told what to write. A four-letter word for sleeveless garment, today’s crossword demands. But why is it “tank” and not “vest”?\nHis vocation is probably important: a computer scientist, a programmer, a coder. His work involves numbers and really simple words like “input,” “print,” or “run.” Coding also involves punctuation, which she is terrible at. An English teacher once asked her if she’d ever met a comma in her life. A comma after every fourth word is how she does it, regardless of what the word is (the answer to her teacher’s question being no), and thank God for copy editors. He is skilled with commas, semicolons, dashes, and slashes, and spends most of the workweek combing through code for a misplaced parenthesis that has misfired an array. Arrays are built into other arrays. Macros built into other macros.\nI don’t think I can write a sentence like that, she thinks. A sentence nestled into another, like whatever that turducken dish is, or, more simply, like an onion, the five-letter word she did not guess on the day it was the word to guess. Being the same on either side, the word “onion” is an onion, the “i” bisecting it like a core. She texts him this amazing realization, only to thereby reveal the answer to the word game before he has had a chance to play. He texts back, Thanks, what unexpected luck.\nHe is also better at phrases, especially at guessing them when they are hidden behind white cubes.

        "writing_prompt": "On the longest night of the year, a man feels unmoored, caught between the weight of his family, the loss of his mother, and the quiet pull of the solstice. What small moment will remind him that the world keeps turning?",
        "story": "It was the year’s turning. These few hours like the blink of a great eye—just enough light to check that the world is still there, before shutting back down.\nSometime in the midafternoon, he had an impulse to go home, or go somewhere, and when he lifted his head, of course, it was dark outside. It just felt wrong. Two hours later, he was in the multi-story looking for his car and he couldn’t find the thing. It was like a lost dog. He clicked the key fob over and over, but there were no answering lights flashing orange on Level 2, where he usually parked, or on Level 3. He went up the little stairs to Level 4, then along the tiny path on the side of the ramp to 4A, brushing against the live cars that were stuck on the slope, nose to tail. He glanced into the windows as he went past and there was a gone look to the drivers’ faces; they’d already left for home.\nOut there, it was Christmas, but he did not think it was Christmas inside the multi-story, the only place in Dublin that had no fairy lights. He walked the last ramp to Level 5. Above him, the black concrete angles of the car-park roof gave way to the night sky, and the car was right there, out in the weather. He took a moment to glance up and around him at the longest night of the year.\nIt felt like the end of things. Made you want your religion back. He looked out over the landscape of west Dublin, the square industrial units set among dark young trees, and he entertained the possibility that it would not work this time. This time, the world would spin deeper into shadow. And, because the exit ramps were still jammed, he stayed a minute to check the solstice on his phone. For some reason, it didn’t always happen on the same day, but in 2016 it came just when you thought it should, on the twenty-first of December. Not at midnight, though—“the event,” as the Web site called it, would happen at 10:44 a.m. Irish time. Somewhere in that moment, whether he believed it or not, the sun would pause in the sky above him, or seem to pause. It would stop in its descent and start its slow journey back to summer and the middle of the sky.\nOr this year, he thought, it might not bother.\nThe M50 was at a crawl, and there was the usual nightmare getting off at the Tallaght exit. He could see the red tail-lights running in a sequence toward him until he pushed his own brake pedal down. It would be stop-start all the way to Manor Kilbride.\nA full forty minutes later, the dual carriageway turned into the old Blessington Road, and oncoming traffic shot by so close he flinched in the glare of the lights. This was the part of the journey that he loved best: the street lamps gave way to the idea of countryside, and there was a song on the radio as the road opened up ahead. The music made him feel like he could keep driving forever. It was a love song, or a sad song. It reminded him of a time in his life, some town he was in, he could not say where. The loss of that place made him unsure of this one. Or indifferent—as though he could clip an oncoming car and it wouldn’t matter. And he didn’t know what he was thinking, until a truck bellied past, sucking the air from the side of the car.\nIt gave him a fright. He checked all the mirrors and shifted in his seat, set his hands more deliberately on the steering wheel. After the turnoff, he followed his own headlights down a country lane, and when he got to the house he sat in the parked car for quite a while.\nThe night was very big out here.There were three texts on his phone; ten, fifteen minutes apart.\nWhen home?\nWill I put yr name in the pot?\nFood anyway, half-seven.\nWhen he comes in the door, there is the smell of cooking, the sound of pans and of water pouring into the sink. His daughter is failing to set the table and complaining about the Dakota Access Pipeline. “It’s, like, so unfair,” she says, and her family neither agrees nor disagrees, because that’s just asking for it. Ruth is fifteen. She is arguing with her own shadow, her mother, her teachers, none of whom care about the Dakota Access Pipeline, or not enough for her. “We live in County Wicklow,” her mother sometimes likes to remind her. But Ruth does not see what location has to do with anything, and he would admire this more, he might even take up the discussion, but she is back on her phone.\nHe glances over her shoulder and, for once, she lets him see.\n“What’s that?”\n“Just,” she says. A person called chikkenpenis has sent a funny picture to do with Kanye’s breakdown, a video clip that jerks and repeats, endlessly. It’s hard to know what the joke is. And what kind of person spells “penis” right and “chicken” with two “k”s?\nBridget Everett and Amy Sedaris talk with Inkoo Kang\n“Is that someone you know?”\nRuth just rolls her eyes, types with two thumbs. Cracks up laughing, saying, “Oh, my God. Oh, my God!”\nHe looks into the kitchen, where his wife is trying to serve up stir-fry out of a too-heavy pan. She is in her track pants. Upstairs all day, at a guess, translating some car manual for solid German euros. Her hair is in a scrunchie, which does not suit her. He tries to remember the song he heard on the radio as he goes over to help, but “Go, go. Out!” she says, and it is gone.\nHalfway through dinner, he becomes aware that Ross, his son, is talking to him about something or someone called Stripey. His son says that Stripey knew about death because he always went to Tiger’s grave. After a moment, he realizes that Stripey is a cat and so is Tiger. The ones at the childminder’s, when Ross was little. Cats from many years ago.\n“Animals believe in death,” his son says.\n“You think?” This is a big statement for a ten-year-old. “Maybe he was just waiting for the other cat to come back out of there. I mean, maybe he doesn’t know what the ground is. Maybe he doesn’t believe in the ground.”\nThe boy’s face goes still, and he looks at his plate.\nRuth goes, “Kcchchhhh,” does a Carrie hand out of the grave. And there is an immediate fight. Shouting, pushing.\n“Hey, hey, that’s enough!” he says.\nWhen they are settled, his wife casts a baleful look at him, and he shoots one back. What have I done now?\n“I think the cat was sad,” she says to Ross. “I think Stripey missed Tiger, don’t you?”\nShe has put her hand on the loose fist his own hand makes beside his plate. This is one of the things they fight about. Stop undermining your own son. Which irritates the hell out of him. Because the boy has to learn how to roll with the punches. “Could have been hungry,” he says. “Yum yum. Dead cat.”\nRuth starts to laugh. And Ross obliges him with a crooked smile.\nHis wife pushes back from the table, starts collecting the plates, though they are only just finished.\n“Sorry that was so,” she says. “It was just a rustle-up.”\n“Lovely,” he says.\nOh, great, he thinks. On the longest night, his wife with that look in her eye that says, Christmas is coming and it is all turning to shite.\nCorrection. His wife with a look that says, Christmas is coming and it is all your fault.\nHe pours a glass of wine and almost spills it on himself falling asleep on the sofa after the news. He was dreaming about weather, or discussing the weather with his dreaming self: all autumn it had been so dry, high pressure, clear skies, the leaves drying to dust on the trees, falling like smoke, they’d hung on so long. It occurs to him that Tiger was Stripey’s mother. The cat’s mother, no less. He says as much to his wife, who is sitting across the room. She looks at him.\n“Yes,” she says. And he suddenly remembers that his own mother is dead—a fact he manages to forget for days at a time.\n“You’d think they’d make a better go of the names,” he says.\nLater, he mutes the TV to check on a noise, and hears his daughter singing upstairs. She has her headphones on, her voice half in her head, half in the room.\n“Goddam truck,” he says. “Nearly had the wing mirror. You know the bend.”\n“Be careful,” his wife says. “This time of year, they’re all drinking.”\n“They’re all wrecked,” he says. “I was half asleep myself. No, not asleep.” She looks slightly shocked. “Just a bit.”\nUnmoored. That is the word he is looking for. Recently he feels—he has felt—unmoored.\nHe used to have a place in his mind where he could go. Hard to say where it was, but his mother has been dead since April, so maybe this was the place she used to occupy. Because he can’t go there anymore. It was the song reminded him.\n“I was listening to the radio,” he says.\n“The radio?”\nIt wasn’t like an inner monologue or anything; he did not sit around talking to his mother all day. It was more like a silence. He had lost a great and wonderful silence. The traffic came against him, and he felt unprotected, bullied by the lights. Because he had no one on his side anymore. Not even his wife.\n“Yes, the radio. In the car. You know, I wish, for once, you’d let me say something without repeating it back at me, like some kind of gom.”\nShe lets this sink in for a moment and then gets up out of the big armchair and leaves the room. He can hear the sound of her starting to unload the dishwasher in the kitchen.\nAnd “Mutual!” he wants to shout after her. “Fucking mutual!” He wants to tell her how he sat in the car, outside his own house, thinking, Whatever happens when I walk in the door, that’s the thing. When I walk in the door, I will find it. The answer or the question, one or the other. It will be there.\nAnd what did he find? These people. This.\nEven in her sleep she is affronted, her body straight in the bed beside him, her head twisted to face the wall. The earth spins them toward morning, and he cannot close his eyes for the vertigo; he has to urge it on. He wakes without knowing he has slept, and the house is busy around him—the sound of the front door, finally, and silence. It is after nine o’clock, but when he comes into the kitchen Ross is still at the table, stuck on his phone.\n“It’s the Christmas concert,” his son says, as if that explains something.\nThe office is closed but he still has a mad number of payments to process before the end of the year, so he takes a coffee back to bed and opens his laptop there.\nHe clicks on a spreadsheet, then he starts reading the news instead and wandering about online.\nRoss comes in to show him something. He climbs across the duvet, bringing the phone screen so close that his father has to push the thing a distance away. It is a video of two tigers, play-fighting in the Siberian snow.\nThey are pretty impressive, the tigers.\n“Fantastic,” he says.\nAnd Ross is so pleased his cheeks glow with it.\nIt is 10:38 and, outside, the sun has not cleared the tops of the winter trees.\n“Look up ‘solstice,’ ” he says, spelling it out for him and then typing it on his own keyboard, because he is running out of time now. He has six minutes to do this, to tell his child that the world will keep turning. No matter what happens, the sun will always rise in the morning, the planet’s orbit will tilt them toward the light. He finds a video clip of a cartoon earth circling a harmless, small sun, but Ross says he already knows about the solstice. They covered it at school.\nIt is 10:42.\nThe boy is sitting cross-legged on the bed beside him. Ross shuts his eyes, and “Sh-h-h,” he says. “Is it happening?”\n“In a minute.”\n“Is it now?”\nThe seconds pass. The boy squeezes his eyelids tighter.\n“Now?”\n“Yes.”\nRoss keeps his eyes shut for another moment, then punches the air. He turns to his dad and they look at each other, full of mischief and amazement. Because it happened. Nothing happened, but they know it was there. The tiny stretch of daylight that will become summer.\nHis wife is home. She is standing in the doorway watching them. They look up and smile at her.\n“What?” she says. ♦",

It is after nine o’clock, but when he comes into the kitchen Ross is still at the table, stuck on his phone.\n“It’s the Christmas concert,” his son says, as if that explains something.\nThe office is closed but he still has a mad number of payments to process before the end of the year, so he takes a coffee back to bed and opens his laptop there.\nHe clicks on a spreadsheet, then he starts reading the news instead and wandering about online.\nRoss comes in to show him something. He climbs across the duvet, bringing the phone screen so close that his father has to push the thing a distance away. It is a video of two tigers, play-fighting in the Siberian snow.\nThey are pretty impressive, the tigers.\n“Fantastic,” he says.\nAnd Ross is so pleased his cheeks glow with it.\nIt is 10:38 and, outside, the sun has not cleared the tops of the winter trees.\n“Look up ‘solstice,’ ” he says, spelling it out for him and then typing it on his own keyboard, because he is running out of time now. He has six minutes to do this, to tell his child that the world will keep turning. No matter what happens, the sun will always rise in the morning, the planet’s orbit will tilt them toward the light. He finds a video clip of a cartoon earth circling a harmless, small sun, but Ross says he already knows about the solstice. They covered it at school.\nIt is 10:42.\nThe boy is sitting cross-legged on the bed beside him. Ross shuts his eyes, and “Sh-h-h,” he says. “Is it happening?”\n“In a minute.”\n“Is it now?”\nThe seconds pass. The boy squeezes his eyelids tighter.\n“Now?”\n“Yes.”\nRoss keeps his eyes shut for another moment, then punches the air. He turns to his dad and they look at each other, full of mischief and amazement. Because it happened. Nothing happened, but they know it was there. The tiny stretch of daylight that will become summer.\nHis wife is home. She is standing in the doorway watching them. They look up and smile at her.\n“What?” she says. ♦",

        "story": "It was the year’s turning. These few hours like the blink of a great eye—just enough light to check that the world is still there, before shutting back down.\nSometime in the midafternoon, he had an impulse to go home, or go somewhere, and when he lifted his head, of course, it was dark outside. It just felt wrong. Two hours later, he was in the multi-story looking for his car and he couldn’t find the thing. It was like a lost dog. He clicked the key fob over and over, but there were no answering lights flashing orange on Level 2, where he usually parked, or on Level 3. He went up the little stairs to Level 4, then along the tiny path on the side of the ramp to 4A, brushing against the live cars that were stuck on the slope, nose to tail. He glanced into the windows as he went past and there was a gone look to the drivers’ faces; they’d already left for home.\nOut there, it was Christmas, but he did not think it was Christmas inside the multi-story, the only place in Dublin that had no fairy lights. He walked the last ramp to Level 5. Above him, the black concrete angles of the car-park roof gave way to the night sky, and the car was right there, out in the weather. He took a moment to glance up and around him at the longest night of the year.\nIt felt like the end of things. Made you want your religion back. He looked out over the landscape of west Dublin, the square industrial units set among dark young trees, and he entertained the possibility that it would not work this time. This time, the world would spin deeper into shadow. And, because the exit ramps were still jammed, he stayed a minute to check the solstice on his phone. For some reason, it didn’t always happen on the same day, but in 2016 it came just when you thought it should, on the twenty-first of December. Not at midnight, though—“the event,” as the Web site called it, would happen at 10:44 a.m. Irish time. Somewhere in that moment, whether he believed it or not, the sun would pause in the sky above him, or seem to pause. It would stop in its descent and start its slow journey back to summer and the middle of the sky.\nOr this year, he thought, it might not bother.\nThe M50 was at a crawl, and there was the usual nightmare getting off at the Tallaght exit. He could see the red tail-lights running in a sequence toward him until he pushed his own brake pedal down. It would be stop-start all the way to Manor Kilbride.\nA full forty minutes later, the dual carriageway turned into the old Blessington Road, and oncoming traffic shot by so close he flinched in the glare of the lights. This was the part of the journey that he loved best: the street lamps gave way to the idea of countryside, and there was a song on the radio as the road opened up ahead. The music made him feel like he could keep driving forever. It was a love song, or a sad song. It reminded him of a time in his life, some town he was in, he could not say where. The loss of that place made him unsure of this one. Or indifferent—as though he could clip an oncoming car and it wouldn’t matter. And he didn’t know what he was thinking, until a truck bellied past, sucking the air from the side of the car.\nIt gave him a fright. He checked all the mirrors and shifted in his seat, set his hands more deliberately on the steering wheel. After the turnoff, he followed his own headlights down a country lane, and when he got to the house he sat in the parked car for quite a while.\nThe night was very big out here.There were three texts on his phone; ten, fifteen minutes apart.\nWhen home?\nWill I put yr name in the pot?\nFood anyway, half-seven.\nWhen he comes in the door, there is the smell of cooking, the sound of pans and of water pouring into the sink. His daughter is failing to set the table and complaining about the Dakota Access Pipeline. “It’s, like, so unfair,” she says, and her family neither agrees nor disagrees, because that’s just asking for it. Ruth is fifteen. She is arguing with her own shadow, her mother, her teachers, none of whom care about the Dakota Access Pipeline, or not enough for her. “We live in County Wicklow,” her mother sometimes likes to remind her. But Ruth does not see what location has to do with anything, and he would admire this more, he might even take up the discussion, but she is back on her phone.\nHe glances over her shoulder and, for once, she lets him see.\n“What’s that?”\n“Just,” she says. A person called chikkenpenis has sent a funny picture to do with Kanye’s breakdown, a video clip that jerks and repeats, endlessly. It’s hard to know what the joke is. And what kind of person spells “penis” right and “chicken” with two “k”s?\nBridget Everett and Amy Sedaris talk with Inkoo Kang\n“Is that someone you know?”\nRuth just rolls her eyes, types with two thumbs. Cracks up laughing, saying, “Oh, my God. Oh, my God!”\nHe looks into the kitchen, where his wife is trying to serve up stir-fry out of a too-heavy pan. She is in her track pants. Upstairs all day, at a guess, translating some car manual for solid German euros. Her hair is in a scrunchie, which does not suit her. He tries to remember the song he heard on the radio as he goes over to help, but “Go, go. Out!” she says, and it is gone.\nHalfway through dinner, he becomes aware that Ross, his son, is talking to him about something or someone called Stripey. His son says that Stripey knew about death because he always went to Tiger’s grave. After a moment, he realizes that Stripey is a cat and so is Tiger. The ones at the childminder’s, when Ross was little. Cats from many years ago.\n“Animals believe in death,” his son says.\n“You think?” This is a big statement for a ten-year-old. “Maybe he was just waiting for the other cat to come back out of there. I mean, maybe he doesn’t know what the ground is. Maybe he doesn’t believe in the ground.”\nThe boy’s face goes still, and he looks at his plate.\nRuth goes, “Kcchchhhh,” does a Carrie hand out of the grave. And there is an immediate fight. Shouting, pushing.\n“Hey, hey, that’s enough!” he says.\nWhen they are settled, his wife casts a baleful look at him, and he shoots one back. What have I done now?\n“I think the cat was sad,” she says to Ross. “I think Stripey missed Tiger, don’t you?”\nShe has put her hand on the loose fist his own hand makes beside his plate. This is one of the things they fight about. Stop undermining your own son. Which irritates the hell out of him. Because the boy has to learn how to roll with the punches. “Could have been hungry,” he says. “Yum yum. Dead cat.”\nRuth starts to laugh. And Ross obliges him with a crooked smile.\nHis wife pushes back from the table, starts collecting the plates, though they are only just finished.\n“Sorry that was so,” she says. “It was just a rustle-up.”\n“Lovely,” he says.\nOh, great, he thinks. On the longest night, his wife with that look in her eye that says, Christmas is coming and it is all turning to shite.\nCorrection. His wife with a look that says, Christmas is coming and it is all your fault.\nHe pours a glass of wine and almost spills it on himself falling asleep on the sofa after the news. He was dreaming about weather, or discussing the weather with his dreaming self: all autumn it had been so dry, high pressure, clear skies, the leaves drying to dust on the trees, falling like smoke, they’d hung on so long. It occurs to him that Tiger was Stripey’s mother. The cat’s mother, no less. He says as much to his wife, who is sitting across the room. She looks at him.\n“Yes,” she says. And he suddenly remembers that his own mother is dead—a fact he manages to forget for days at a time.\n“You’d think they’d make a better go of the names,” he says.\nLater, he mutes the TV to check on a noise, and hears his daughter singing upstairs. She has her headphones on, her voice half in her head, half in the room.\n“Goddam truck,” he says. “Nearly had the wing mirror. You know the bend.”\n“Be careful,” his wife says. “This time of year, they’re all drinking.”\n“They’re all wrecked,” he says. “I was half asleep myself. No, not asleep.” She looks slightly shocked. “Just a bit.”\nUnmoored. That is the word he is looking for. Recently he feels—he has felt—unmoored.\nHe used to have a place in his mind where he could go. Hard to say where it was, but his mother has been dead since April, so maybe this was the place she used to occupy. Because he can’t go there anymore. It was the song reminded him.\n“I was listening to the radio,” he says.\n“The radio?”\nIt wasn’t like an inner monologue or anything; he did not sit around talking to his mother all day. It was more like a silence. He had lost a great and wonderful silence. The traffic came against him, and he felt unprotected, bullied by the lights. Because he had no one on his side anymore. Not even his wife.\n“Yes, the radio. In the car. You know, I wish, for once, you’d let me say something without repeating it back at me, like some kind of gom.”\nShe lets this sink in for a moment and then gets up out of the big armchair and leaves the room. He can hear the sound of her starting to unload the dishwasher in the kitchen.\nAnd “Mutual!” he wants to shout after her. “Fucking mutual!” He wants to tell her how he sat in the car, outside his own house, thinking, Whatever happens when I walk in the door, that’s the thing. When I walk in the door, I will find it. The answer or the question, one or the other. It will be there.\nAnd what did he find? These people. This.\nEven in her sleep she is affronted, her body straight in the bed beside him, her head twisted to face the wall. The earth spins them toward morning, and he cannot close his eyes for the vertigo; he has to urge it on. He wakes without knowing he has slept, and the house is busy around him—the sound of the front door, finally, and silence. It is after nine o’clock, but when he comes into the kitchen Ross is still at the table, stuck on his phone.\n“It’s the Christmas concert,” his son says, as if that explains something.\nThe office is closed but he still has a mad number of payments to process before the end of the year, so he takes a coffee back to bed and opens his laptop there.\nHe clicks on a spreadsheet, then he starts reading the news instead and wandering about online.\nRoss comes in to show him something.

        "story": "Short story about a woman who marries an ice man... I married an ice man. I first met him in a hotel at a ski resort. \"Look, that's an ice man,\" my friend whispered. The iceman was tall, and he seemed to be young, but his fingers were rimed with a white frost that looked as if it would never melt. Something about him pierced me to the heart. I made up some excuse not to go out, and stayed in the hotel. I felt compelled to talk to the ice man no matter what. \"I don't ski,\" he said. \"I just like to sit here and read and look at the snow. You're interested in me, aren't you? You want to know what an ice man is.\" I held back from asking personal questions. Instead, the iceman talked about me. Somehow, he knew all about me. \"How do you know so much about me?\" \"I can't read minds or anything. I just know.\" Eventually we started dating. We always sat on a bench in the park and talked.\" \"Why don't you talk about yourself? How did you come to be an ice man?\" \"I don't know. I don't even know if I had parents.\" I fell seriously in love with this ice man. The ice man loved me just as I wasóin the present. My mother and my older sister were strongly opposed to my marrying the ice man. \"You don't know a thing about his background.\" So we got married. Nobody blessed the wedding, and no friends or relatives were happy for us. We rented a tiny apartment, and the ice man made a living by working at a cold-storage meat facility The two of us lived a happy life together, without bothering or being bothered by anyone. I even started to love having sex with the ice man. We wanted to have a child but that didn't seem to be possible. It may have been that human genes and ice-man genes didn't combine easily. I found myself with time on my hands. I would finish up all the housework, and then having nothing to do. I was still young, and doing the same thing day after day. \"How would it be if the two of us went away on a trip somewhere, just for a change?\" \"Well, if you really want to go on a trip so badly, I don't have anything against it.\" \"How about visiting the South Pole?\" It seemed as soon as I spoke the words \"South Pole,\" something changed inside him. I had a premonition that if we went to the South Pole something would happen to us, but I couldn't find a good reason to cancel the trip. When we stepped off onto the ground of the South Pole I felt my husbands body lurch. something inside the ice man had been secretly violently shaken. He walked enthusiastically from place to place as if he couldn't get enough of it. He learned the local language quickly. I felt as though my husband had betrayed me and left me to care for myself. I eventually lost my strength.

One rainy afternoon, the phone rang, and a voice from the past asked for help. What do you do when the comfort of boiling pasta collides with the weight of someone else's troubles?",
        "story": "Nineteen-seventy-one was the Year of Spaghetti.\nIn 1971, I cooked spaghetti to live, and lived to cook spaghetti. Steam rising from the pot was my pride and joy, tomato sauce bubbling up in the saucepan my one great hope in life.\nPublished in the print edition of the November 21, 2005, issue.\nI went to a cooking specialty store and bought a kitchen timer and a huge aluminum pot, big enough to bathe a German shepherd in, then went around to all the supermarkets that catered to foreigners, gathering an assortment of odd-sounding spices. I picked up a pasta cookbook at the bookstore, and bought tomatoes by the dozen. I purchased every brand of spaghetti I could lay my hands on, simmered every sauce known to man. Fine particles of garlic, onion, and olive oil swirled in the air, forming a harmonious cloud that penetrated every corner of my tiny apartment, permeating the floor and the ceiling and the walls, my clothes, my books, my records, my tennis racquet, my bundles of old letters. It was a fragrance one might have smelled on ancient Roman aqueducts.\nThis is a story from the Year of Spaghetti, 1971 A.D.\nAs a rule, I cooked spaghetti, and ate it, by myself. I was convinced that spaghetti was a dish best enjoyed alone. I can’t really explain why I felt that way, but there it is.\nI always drank tea with my spaghetti and ate a simple lettuce-and-cucumber salad. I’d make sure I had plenty of both. I laid everything out neatly on the table and enjoyed a leisurely meal, glancing at the paper as I ate. From Sunday to Saturday, one Spaghetti Day followed another. And each new Sunday started a brand-new Spaghetti Week.\nEvery time I sat down to a plate of spaghetti—especially on a rainy afternoon—I had the distinct feeling that somebody was about to knock on my door. The person who I imagined was about to visit me was different each time. Sometimes it was a stranger, sometimes someone I knew. Once, it was a girl with slim legs whom I’d dated in high school, and once it was myself, from a few years back, come to pay a visit. Another time, it was William Holden, with Jennifer Jones on his arm.\nWilliam Holden?\nNot one of these people, however, actually ventured into my apartment. They hovered just outside the door, without knocking, like fragments of memory, and then slipped away.\nSpring, summer, and fall, I cooked and cooked, as if cooking spaghetti were an act of revenge. Like a lonely, jilted girl throwing old love letters into the fireplace, I tossed one handful of spaghetti after another into the pot.\nI’d gather up the trampled-down shadows of time, knead them into the shape of a German shepherd, toss them into the roiling water, and sprinkle them with salt. Then I’d hover over the pot, oversized chopsticks in hand, until the timer dinged its plaintive note.\nSpaghetti strands are a crafty bunch, and I couldn’t let them out of my sight. If I were to turn my back, they might well slip over the edge of the pot and vanish into the night. The night lay in silent ambush, hoping to waylay the prodigal strands.\nSpaghetti alla parmigiana\nSpaghetti alla napoletana\nSpaghetti al cartoccio\nSpaghetti aglio e olio\nSpaghetti alla carbonara\nSpaghetti della pina\nAnd then there was the pitiful, nameless leftover spaghetti carelessly tossed into the fridge.\nA Public Defender's Radical Approach to Representing The January 6th Rioters\nBorn in heat, the strands of spaghetti washed down the river of 1971 and vanished.\nI mourn them all—all the spaghetti of the year 1971.\nWhen the phone rang at 3:20 p.m. I was sprawled out on the tatami, staring at the ceiling. A pool of winter sunlight had formed in the place where I lay. Like a dead fly I lay there, vacant, in a December spotlight.\nAt first, I didn’t recognize the sound as the phone ringing. It was more like an unfamiliar memory that had hesitantly slipped in between the layers of air. Finally, though, it began to take shape, and, in the end, a ringing phone was unmistakably what it was. It was one hundred per cent a phone ring in one-hundred-per-cent real air. Still sprawled out, I reached over and picked up the receiver.\nOn the other end was a girl, a girl so indistinct that, by four-thirty, she might very well have disappeared altogether. She was the ex-girlfriend of a friend of mine. Something had brought them together, this guy and this indistinct girl, and something had led them to break up. I had, I admit, reluctantly played a role in getting them together in the first place.\n“Sorry to bother you,” she said, “but do you know where he is now?”\nI looked at the phone, running my eyes along the length of the cord. The cord was, sure enough, attached to the phone. I managed a vague reply. There was something ominous in the girl’s voice, and whatever trouble was brewing I knew that I didn’t want to get involved.\n“Nobody will tell me where he is,” she said in a chilly tone. “Everybody’s pretending they don’t know. But there’s something important I have to tell him, so please—tell me where he is. I promise I won’t drag you into this. Where is he?”\n“I honestly don’t know,” I told her. “I haven’t seen him in a long time.” My voice didn’t sound like my own. I was telling the truth about not having seen him for a long time, but not about the other part—I did know his address and phone number. Whenever I tell a lie, something weird happens to my voice.\nNo comment from her.\nThe phone was like a pillar of ice.\nThen all the objects around me turned into pillars of ice, as if I were in a J. G. Ballard science-fiction story.\n“I really don’t know,” I repeated. “He went away a long time ago, without saying a word.”\nThe girl laughed. “Give me a break. He’s not that clever. We’re talking about a guy who has to make a lot of noise no matter what he does.”\nShe was right. The guy really was a bit of a dim bulb.\nBut I wasn’t about to tell her where he was. Do that, and next I’d have him on the phone, giving me an earful. I was through with getting caught up in other people’s messes. I’d already dug a hole in the back yard and buried everything that needed to be buried in it. Nobody could ever dig it up again.\n“I’m sorry,” I said.\n“You don’t like me, do you?” she said suddenly.\nI had no idea what to say. I didn’t particularly dislike her. I had no real impression of her at all. It’s hard to have a bad impression of somebody you have no impression of.\n“I’m sorry,” I said again. “But I’m cooking spaghetti right now.”\n“I’m sorry?”\n“I said I’m cooking spaghetti,” I lied. I had no idea why I said that. But the lie had already become a part of me—so much so that, at that moment at least, it didn’t feel like a lie at all.\nI went ahead and filled an imaginary pot with imaginary water, lit an imaginary stove with an imaginary match.\n“So?” she asked.\nI sprinkled imaginary salt into the boiling water, gently lowered a handful of imaginary spaghetti into the imaginary pot, set the imaginary kitchen timer for eight minutes.\n“So I can’t talk. The spaghetti will be ruined.”\nShe didn’t say anything.\n“I’m really sorry, but cooking spaghetti is a delicate operation.”\nThe girl was silent. The phone in my hand began to freeze again.\n“So could you call me back?” I added hurriedly.\n“Because you’re in the middle of making spaghetti?” she asked.\n“Yeah.”\n“Are you making it for someone, or are you going to eat alone?”\n“I’ll eat it by myself,” I said.\nShe held her breath for a long time, then slowly breathed out. “There’s no way you could know this, but I’m really in trouble. I don’t know what to do.”\n“I’m sorry I can’t help you,” I said.\n“There’s some money involved, too.”\n“I see.”\n“He owes me money,” she said. “I lent him some money. I shouldn’t have, but I had to.”\nI was quiet for a minute, my thoughts drifting toward spaghetti. “I’m sorry,” I said. “But I’ve got the spaghetti going, so . . .”\nShe gave a listless laugh. “Goodbye,” she said. “Say hi to your spaghetti for me. I hope it turns out O.K.”\n“Bye,” I said.\nWhen I hung up the phone, the circle of light on the floor had shifted an inch or two. I lay down again in that pool of light and resumed staring at the ceiling.\nThinking about spaghetti that boils eternally but is never done is a sad, sad thing.\nNow I regret, a little, that I didn’t tell the girl anything. Perhaps I should have. I mean, her ex-boyfriend wasn’t much to start with—an empty shell of a guy with artistic pretensions, a great talker whom nobody trusted. She sounded as if she really were strapped for money, and, no matter what the situation, you’ve got to pay back what you borrow.\nSometimes I wonder what happened to the girl—the thought usually pops into my mind when I’m facing a steaming-hot plate of spaghetti. After she hung up the phone, did she disappear forever, sucked into the 4:30 p.m. shadows? Was I partly to blame?\nI want you to understand my position, though. At the time, I didn’t want to get involved with anyone. That’s why I kept on cooking spaghetti, all by myself. In that huge pot, big enough to hold a German shepherd.\nDurum semolina, golden wheat wafting in Italian fields.\nCan you imagine how astonished the Italians would be if they knew that what they were exporting in 1971 was really loneliness? ♦",

        "story": "Nineteen-seventy-one was the Year of Spaghetti.\nIn 1971, I cooked spaghetti to live, and lived to cook spaghetti. Steam rising from the pot was my pride and joy, tomato sauce bubbling up in the saucepan my one great hope in life.\nPublished in the print edition of the November 21, 2005, issue.\nI went to a cooking specialty store and bought a kitchen timer and a huge aluminum pot, big enough to bathe a German shepherd in, then went around to all the supermarkets that catered to foreigners, gathering an assortment of odd-sounding spices. I picked up a pasta cookbook at the bookstore, and bought tomatoes by the dozen. I purchased every brand of spaghetti I could lay my hands on, simmered every sauce known to man. Fine particles of garlic, onion, and olive oil swirled in the air, forming a harmonious cloud that penetrated every corner of my tiny apartment, permeating the floor and the ceiling and the walls, my clothes, my books, my records, my tennis racquet, my bundles of old letters. It was a fragrance one might have smelled on ancient Roman aqueducts.\nThis is a story from the Year of Spaghetti, 1971 A.D.\nAs a rule, I cooked spaghetti, and ate it, by myself. I was convinced that spaghetti was a dish best enjoyed alone. I can’t really explain why I felt that way, but there it is.\nI always drank tea with my spaghetti and ate a simple lettuce-and-cucumber salad. I’d make sure I had plenty of both. I laid everything out neatly on the table and enjoyed a leisurely meal, glancing at the paper as I ate. From Sunday to Saturday, one Spaghetti Day followed another. And each new Sunday started a brand-new Spaghetti Week.\nEvery time I sat down to a plate of spaghetti—especially on a rainy afternoon—I had the distinct feeling that somebody was about to knock on my door. The person who I imagined was about to visit me was different each time. Sometimes it was a stranger, sometimes someone I knew. Once, it was a girl with slim legs whom I’d dated in high school, and once it was myself, from a few years back, come to pay a visit. Another time, it was William Holden, with Jennifer Jones on his arm.\nWilliam Holden?\nNot one of these people, however, actually ventured into my apartment. They hovered just outside the door, without knocking, like fragments of memory, and then slipped away.\nSpring, summer, and fall, I cooked and cooked, as if cooking spaghetti were an act of revenge. Like a lonely, jilted girl throwing old love letters into the fireplace, I tossed one handful of spaghetti after another into the pot.\nI’d gather up the trampled-down shadows of time, knead them into the shape of a German shepherd, toss them into the roiling water, and sprinkle them with salt. Then I’d hover over the pot, oversized chopsticks in hand, until the timer dinged its plaintive note.\nSpaghetti strands are a crafty bunch, and I couldn’t let them out of my sight. If I were to turn my back, they might well slip over the edge of the pot and vanish into the night. The night lay in silent ambush, hoping to waylay the prodigal strands.\nSpaghetti alla parmigiana\nSpaghetti alla napoletana\nSpaghetti al cartoccio\nSpaghetti aglio e olio\nSpaghetti alla carbonara\nSpaghetti della pina\nAnd then there was the pitiful, nameless leftover spaghetti carelessly tossed into the fridge.\nA Public Defender's Radical Approach to Representing The January 6th Rioters\nBorn in heat, the strands of spaghetti washed down the river of 1971 and vanished.\nI mourn them all—all the spaghetti of the year 1971.\nWhen the phone rang at 3:20 p.m. I was sprawled out on the tatami, staring at the ceiling. A pool of winter sunlight had formed in the place where I lay. Like a dead fly I lay there, vacant, in a December spotlight.\nAt first, I didn’t recognize the sound as the phone ringing. It was more like an unfamiliar memory that had hesitantly slipped in between the layers of air. Finally, though, it began to take shape, and, in the end, a ringing phone was unmistakably what it was. It was one hundred per cent a phone ring in one-hundred-per-cent real air. Still sprawled out, I reached over and picked up the receiver.\nOn the other end was a girl, a girl so indistinct that, by four-thirty, she might very well have disappeared altogether. She was the ex-girlfriend of a friend of mine. Something had brought them together, this guy and this indistinct girl, and something had led them to break up. I had, I admit, reluctantly played a role in getting them together in the first place.\n“Sorry to bother you,” she said, “but do you know where he is now?”\nI looked at the phone, running my eyes along the length of the cord. The cord was, sure enough, attached to the phone. I managed a vague reply. There was something ominous in the girl’s voice, and whatever trouble was brewing I knew that I didn’t want to get involved.\n“Nobody will tell me where he is,” she said in a chilly tone. “Everybody’s pretending they don’t know. But there’s something important I have to tell him, so please—tell me where he is. I promise I won’t drag you into this. Where is he?”\n“I honestly don’t know,” I told her. “I haven’t seen him in a long time.” My voice didn’t sound like my own. I was telling the truth about not having seen him for a long time, but not about the other part—I did know his address and phone number. Whenever I tell a lie, something weird happens to my voice.\nNo comment from her.\nThe phone was like a pillar of ice.\nThen all the objects around me turned into pillars of ice, as if I were in a J. G. Ballard science-fiction story.\n“I really don’t know,” I repeated. “He went away a long time ago, without saying a word.”\nThe girl laughed. “Give me a break. He’s not that clever. We’re talking about a guy who has to make a lot of noise no matter what he does.”\nShe was right. The guy really was a bit of a dim bulb.\nBut I wasn’t about to tell her where he was. Do that, and next I’d have him on the phone, giving me an earful. I was through with getting caught up in other people’s messes. I’d already dug a hole in the back yard and buried everything that needed to be buried in it. Nobody could ever dig it up again.\n“I’m sorry,” I said.\n“You don’t like me, do you?” she said suddenly.\nI had no idea what to say. I didn’t particularly dislike her. I had no real impression of her at all. It’s hard to have a bad impression of somebody you have no impression of.\n“I’m sorry,” I said again. “But I’m cooking spaghetti right now.”\n“I’m sorry?”\n“I said I’m cooking spaghetti,” I lied. I had no idea why I said that. But the lie had already become a part of me—so much so that, at that moment at least, it didn’t feel like a lie at all.\nI went ahead and filled an imaginary pot with imaginary water, lit an imaginary stove with an imaginary match.\n“So?” she asked.\nI sprinkled imaginary salt into the boiling water, gently lowered a handful of imaginary spaghetti into the imaginary pot, set the imaginary kitchen timer for eight minutes.\n“So I can’t talk. The spaghetti will be ruined.”\nShe didn’t say anything.\n“I’m really sorry, but cooking spaghetti is a delicate operation.”\nThe girl was silent. The phone in my hand began to freeze again.\n“So could you call me back?” I added hurriedly.\n“Because you’re in the middle of making spaghetti?” she asked.\n“Yeah.”\n“Are you making it for someone, or are you going to eat alone?”\n“I’ll eat it by myself,” I said.\nShe held her breath for a long time, then slowly breathed out. “There’s no way you could know this, but I’m really in trouble. I don’t know what to do.”\n“I’m sorry I can’t help you,” I said.\n“There’s some money involved, too.”\n“I see.”\n“He owes me money,” she said. “I lent him some money. I shouldn’t have, but I had to.”\nI was quiet for a minute, my thoughts drifting toward spaghetti. “I’m sorry,” I said. “But I’ve got the spaghetti going, so . . .”\nShe gave a listless laugh. “Goodbye,” she said. “Say hi to your spaghetti for me.
