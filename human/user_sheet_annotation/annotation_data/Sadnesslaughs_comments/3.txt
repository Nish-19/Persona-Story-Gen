#### Writing Prompt ####
"You know... Most vampires I hunted tend to see humans as just cattle." "Oh, don't misunderstand me. This is just how I see you too." "Really? Then why don't you hurt people in your town?" "Well, you don't slaughter dairy cows for their meat, do you?"


#### Story ####
Are you saying you want to milk us? Angus asked. The question creating an awkward silence, as the vampire tried to figure out a proper reaction to that comment. One that summed up the absolute disgust and revulsion he felt.

 

Heralds face scrunched up, eyes tightening in an act that made it look like his eyelids were trying to suffocate his eyeballs. As he made that expression, his tongue slipped out, making a perfect bleh expression before his features returned to normal. No, I do not want to milk humankind. I wish to feast on your blood. That involves no milking.

 

Isnt it kind of milking? Sure, we arent cows or anything, but youre still milking the blood from our bodies. He remarked, again deeply disturbing the vampire.

 

DRINKING the blood. There is a difference. Do you milk an orange when you make juice?

 

I get my juice from the store.

 

I think youre misunderstanding my point. Herald had met many strange vampire hunters over the years. From one who claimed to be a demon, to another who wore jester makeup and honked before every deadly blow. Now, even those seemed tame when compared to the man he had encountered on his way to the blood bank. The hunter waiting in the underground parking lot for him, blocking the back entrance to the blood reserves.

 

Maybe youre misunderstanding your own point. Although, if youre only milking humans, I guess theres no reason to fight you. Im more after the vampires that kill people. You know, the ones that go I want to suck your blood. Angus stretched his arms out forward, taking a Frankenstein pose as he made that comment. Even giving a Halloween themed Bleh after saying it.

 

Herald would have been offended by that if he hadnt gone through a I want to suck your blood phase in the 1600s. A time when such a thing was considered cool among the vampire community. Now it seemed old-fashioned. Something that was reserved only for cheap fiction. Even if he wanted to feign offense, he had bigger issues, like the constant use of the word milking.

 

Im drinking their blood. How hard is that to get into your skull? Slurping, sipping and feasting.

 

Right, if you say so. Have a nice day. Angus slipped his holy water laced dagger into its sheath, turning to leave, only to see a black shadow swoop in front of him, blocking his path. From the shadow, Herald emerged. The skinny, six-foot five vampire lurching over him, with his pale eyes staring down at the human.

  
Say Im drinking blood.

 

Youre drinking blood, whatever. Angus said, giving a cheeky smile before again turning to leave. The shadow moved again, blocking his step once more.

 

Mean it. Heralds tone growing agitated, not accepting that for a response.

 

If you think its drinking blood, then it is. Who am I to tell a vampire that his terms might be outdated? You were born in a different era. Its ok.

 

Are you suggesting people now refer to it as milking? Thats disgusting, sickening and repulsive. Maybe I should harvest you like cattle. Keep you all in a freezer until you can learn the difference between milking and drinking. When Heralds fangs poked out from his upper lips, thats when Angus knew he had to take his foot off the gas. Not wanting to turn this into a fight.

 

He opened his palms and dragged them towards the floor, wordlessly telling Herald to settle. When the vampires fangs started retracting, Angus spoke. People use a ton of terms that even I dont understand. Some might even claim one of us is rizzing the other. I think? Honestly, Rizz is lost on me. What Im saying is, terms are getting confusing. Maybe people would call it milking now?

 

Herald stood there dumbfounded, struggling to follow the conversation. Never in his life had he met a vampire hunter that was this perplexing. The human had put him into such a confused state that his cold, lifeless body was noticing the cool morning breeze blowing through the cracks in the underground parking lot. Finding Its way to the vampire through the shoddy construction.

 

Human speech is perplexing. Herald relented.

 

It is. Ive got a niece and some of the things she says confuses the hell out of me. I remember everyone saying kool back in my day. Now its all Skibidis and stuff. Whens the last time someone wrote a word with numbers? Angus noticed the vampire didnt seem to relate to that, so he tried a different approach. What about the beautiful old English? How lost is that?

 

The vampire longingly gazed towards the ceiling of the carpark, sighing. How lost she is. Such a beautiful way of speaking. You wont find class like that anymore. He agreed before letting out another sigh. I think youve turned me off my dinner with all that milking talk. Ill come back tomorrow. You dont have any problems with that, do you?

 
Angus wondered how far he could push this. Ideally, two days would be best, but one day was also more than he expected. How about two days? They get fresh blood in on Wednesdays. That has to taste better, doesnt it?

 

I do hate the cold taste one gets from a refrigerated bag of blood. Two days would be manageable. Herald vanished into a cloud of smoke, only to reemerge a second later, after making a realization. Hunter. This milking business. That was your way of turning me off my dinner, was it not? Anguss pale eyes pivoting into a menacing red.

 

Couldnt say. Angus smiled, not meeting the gaze of the vampire, who was now deeply invading his personal space.

 

Does this have to do with the bus full of tourists that crashed earlier? Is that why youre hanging around a blood bank at night? When Angus didnt answer, the vampire smiled. I see. If you had just explained the situation, I would have left. You didnt need to sicken me. If the humans need the blood more than I do, they can have it. Fewer humans means less food for me.

 

Angus took a relieved breath, holding his chest. Phew. I was worried you were going to fight me or something. You caught me. Its funny, youre the first vampire thats caught onto my deception. Youre a clever one. Angus lied, that subtle last minute glance away being noticed by the vampire now that he wasnt flustered.

 

Youre a bold liar, human. Not a bad one either. Few can deceive a vampire, even for a short time. There was a glimmer of respect from the vampire, a small smirk that showed the human had impressed him. Good luck, Hunter. Hopefully, those humans recover. I also hope we are never to meet in battle. I fear youre stronger than you let on.

 

You would easily win.

 

Herald laughed, watching the slight smirk on Anguss lips when he said that. Another lie. Goodnight, Mr. Hunter. He said, leaving Angus to his duties.
