#### Writing Prompt ####
Every Halloween, you’re magically bound to embody the last costume you wore. For years, you’ve been creative with it—fun, lighthearted choices. But this year, you impulsively dressed as the embodiment of death. Now it’s November 1st, and the costume isn’t fading.


#### Story ####
Ok. Relax. This doesnt mean Im death. Maybe someone just glued my robes on? Ill take a quick look under my hood and see that everythings as normal as it should be. I said, raising my hood, only to see a skull staring back at me in my bathroom mirror. What the hell, Im death? My skeletal hands pressed against my skull, digging into my eye sockets. Wait, how come I can still see? That doesnt make any sense.

 

Somehow that made this less strange, that weird realization that I could still see dulling the fact that I had become death, the reaper of souls. If anything, the longer I thought about it, the more I relaxed. Guess its better than my crazy frog costume last year. At least my little tadpoles arent bouncing around this time. I murmured, making sure I still had my pants on under these robes.

 

So, how long will this last? A day? A week? Usually, I had to perform some act in my costume to release the spell. Like that cover of who let the dogs out I did last year. Man, that crazy frog period was weird. I went and made myself a cup of coffee, realizing I only had myself to blame for this. Why did I think this year would be any different? This is the fourth time its happened. I should have been Mario, like I originally planned. At least I would have met a princess then.

 

Bringing the coffee to my mouth, I took a sip, feeling it ooze down my throat before splashing onto the kitchen tiles. WHAT? So, I can see but I cant taste and drink? How does any of this work? Do I have a body? Do I not have a body? These are some sloppy magic rules. I said, arguing with the essence of strange happenings, as if a fairy or plot device would appear to explain why this was the case. Unfortunately, no help arrived, leaving me to muddle my way through this, like always.

 

I sluggishly dragged my robe along the tiles of the kitchen floor, moping it with my clothing. Without my morning coffee, I didnt have the energy to give it a proper cleanup, making a half assed attempt. Guess Ill collect some souls then.

 

Where to find souls? That was the question. Graveyards? Retirement homes? After giving it some thought, I decided that the retirement home would be the better option, as the people in the graveyards had probably already moved on to the afterlife. As I stepped outside, no one batted an eye, most people passing through me, not even noticing my presence. Only giving a small shiver as I stepped past them. As I made it to the end of the street, I heard a voice. 

Still wearing your costume, dear? Old lady Jill asked, giving me a friendly wave from her porch.

 

Oh, yeah. Its a long story. I would have smiled if I still had lips, only giving her a friendly tip of my hood before pausing. Wait? You can see me.

 

Yes, dear. Should I not be able to see you?

 

Um. This was awkward. Honestly, I think I would have preferred the crazy frog costume over this. At least that didnt involve dragging a nice old lady to the afterlife. Even if it may have caused her to die of shock. I think you may be dead.

 

She glanced down at herself, pushing her glasses up her nose to get a better look at her ethereal body. I am? Oh, sorry, I didnt mean to haunt you, dear. Ill head back inside. You have a lovely day. She gave me a sincere apology, waddling back to her door as I trailed behind her.

 

You dont need to apologize. Im death. Well, Im filling in for death. When I put on a costume, I become the person its based on.

 

And you still keep dressing up? She asked, making me again realize how stupid I was.

 

I never learn. Anyway, I would be honored to take you to the afterlife. Im still new to this, but I think I could muddle my way through it. How hard can it be? I stared up at the heavens and raised my arms, the sleeves rolling down, giving me a cinematic look. DEADETH GO UPPIES.

 

Jill looked up at the sky, then at me. I dont think that worked, dear. It looked very good, though.

 

Thanks. I was out of ideas, expecting it to be the first thing I tried. What now? From whence you came, you shall remain. Until you are, complete again. Again, nothing. Have you got any ideas? Do you feel floaty or anything?

 

Jill opened her mouth, as if the soul would simply pop free and ascend to the heavens. While I thought it was a stupid idea, it still made a lot more sense than anything I had tried, which said a lot about my plans. Im not sure, dear. I thought it would come out on its own.

Hm. What if I just, I placed my hand on her cheek, only for her mouth to pop open, and a blue light to appear in her throat. As the light appeared, she let out a squeal, eyes rolling back as her body vanished, leaving only a small blue orb. 

I remained frozen after that, silently processing the traumatic scene I had seen. Finally, I screamed. I THOUGHT I KILLED HER. WHY DID HER EYES ROLL BACK LIKE THAT? EW, THAT WAS SO SCARY. I juggled her soul between my hands until I felt comfortable enough to hold it. Wow, her souls light. Guess that means she was a good person. Alright, lets send you to heaven. 

I tossed her soul skyward, only for it to come back down, crashing towards the Earth. Crap. I jumped, catching it before it went through the ground, nearly accidentally sending her either to hell or to the core of the Earth. Ok, so dont throw the soul. Um, maybe I tell her where to go? Go to heaven, good girl, go home. I said, imagining I was talking to a dog. 

Weirdly enough, that worked. The soul fluttering from my palm, heading into the sky before vanishing. As it left, my robes dissolved, leaving me standing on her porch. The rush of satisfaction I got from a job well done was quickly destroyed when I realized I was now standing outside a recently deceased persons home. With that knowledge in mind, I went home, only to get knocked over on the sidewalk. 

WATCH WHERE YOURE STANDING. The jogger huffed, not even taking their headphones off to hear any potential reply, continuing on their way. I picked myself up and dusted off my pants. Ok, no more dressing up next year. That was the last time. Although, it would be a kind of funny if I dressed up as the hamburglar
