#### Writing Prompt ####
You’re a professional matchbreaker. Opposite to a matchmaker, you’re hired by concerned friends, jealous exes, desperate simps and everyone else in between to end an existing relationship from behind the scenes.


#### Story ####
"That's all there is to it." Max smiled. "You make up, I break up."


Paula considered the concept further as they walked.


"So you can get them to breakup?"


"For a fee." He reminded her. "And just to be clear. This isn't because of jealousy is it?"


"Huh?"


"I may be a textbook villain. But I'm not a homewrecker."


She thought he might be joking. But the look on his face said otherwise.


"Okay." She exhaled. "No it's not because I want him for myself."


He continued glaring. The only reaction a raised eyebrow.


"I don't want to date her either."


"Alright then." Max smiled again. "Let's proceed."


The date was a simple one. Coffee at the local cafe. The modern day classic if there was one.


The marks, Dora and Paul, at first glance seemed happy enough. If Max was certain, they were really hitting it off. Per information given, this was their 3rd or 4th date. They were smart. They were taking things slow.


"So what's the plan?" Paula asked from their vantage point.


"Well, they're being careful it seems like." Max said as he observed. "That's healthy. You said they haven't slept together yet?"


"No. Dora's careful about that."


"Good. That's good." Max thought aloud. "They're still in ghost territory."


"Ghost territory."


"Here, give me Dora's number."

"So, I got up and left." Paul finished explaining.


Dora half sipped on her drink and broke into laughter at the story. Paul tried to make himself smaller, because it felt a bit too early to laugh too much.


"That's, that's great." Dora grinned.


Her phone vibrated on the table and she picked it up. Paula texted her.


"*Girl.*" it read.


Below that was a video. She hit play.


Paul was at a party. Paul was drinking. Paul was smoking. Paul got kissed by another woman. On the lips. Paul had the same lady's head in his lap.


She locked the phone and sat it down.


Paul drank his coffee as he stared at his own phone, before he realized that she was watching him.


"Yes, sorry," he apologized. "I just had to check my emails."


"Emails?" She repeated.


"Yeah." He confirmed.


"...Emails?" Dora insisted.


"Yeah?"


The vibes were off. Paula looked at the phone he held and the expression his face carried. It was blank yet peaceful.


"I," Dora debated. "I have to go."


"Really?" Paul frowned. "But we just got here."


"I have to go!" Dora insisted loudly.


"Okay, you rode here with me. I'll drive you-"


"I have Uber!"


"Okay."


Paula watched her storm off around the opposite side of the strip mall. Then at Max, who happily rolled his fist backward like he was reeling in a fish.


"Hook, Line, and Sinker." He jeered. "That'll be $600 little lady."


"But I paid you $250 already."


"That's the non refundable deposit." He promised. "Now, cash, credit, or Cash App?"


"I guess, Cash App?" She realized. "Do you do Venmo?"


"That can be arranged."

I'll break here. He's a busy man. Should I go farther?
