#### Writing Prompt ####
The first moment you laid eyes on him, you knew that something was terribly wrong with your son. It might've been the fact that his eyes were all-black when he was born or that his first words were, "This human form is limiting". You're not entirely sure.


#### Story ####
She sat at the island in the kitchen. A can of Dr. Pepper and a cigarette she'd freshly lit off the nearby candle the only real sign of trouble.\n\n\"Honey?\" He asked as he walked into the room. \"I think there's something wrong with Zane.\"\n\n\"Really?\" She exhaled softly as she flicked ashes into the nearby sink. \"What was your first clue?\"\n\n\"So after three years you're ready to talk about it, huh?\"\n\nHolly watched Matt ease himself into the chair on the other side of the island. He looked at both doorways before he settled fully down. At least they were on the same page. Finally, she guessed.\n\n\"Am I?\" She paused. \"Am I a bad parent?\"\n\n\"No?\" Matt's eyes widened. \"Why, would you say that though?\"\n\n\"I just, I dunno'.\" She ashed the cigarette again. \"It's mainly the whole thing Zane keeps mentioning. This human-\"\n\n\"-Form is limiting.\" Matt finished for her.\n\nHolly frowned a little deeper as she took another drag. \"Mm hmm.\"\n\nThe pair of them seemed to be locked in place. A quick glance around the house from the both of them. The only noise the soft combustion of tobacco and paper.\n\n\"I thought you quit.\"\n\n\"My son is some otherworldly entity. I think this is an okay time to start.\"\n\n\"Fair.\"\n\nHolly studied him now. Bags under his eyes, his hair mussed and slowly graying on the edges.\n\n\"How about you? Did you find anything?\"\n\n\"He's just.\" Matt shook his head in numb acceptance \"He's not of this world.\"\n\n\"Is he like a demon?\" She pondered. \"Or an alien?\"\n\n\"Cthulu or something? Maybe, he's not a demon? An angel?\"\n\nHolly thumped her can back on the table at this.\n\n\"When have you ever heard of angels with black eyes?\"\n\n\"When have you ever heard a description of anything normal involving angels?\" Matt countered. \"They're said to basically make us half catatonic in all the stuff I've read.\"\n\n\"Your childhood knowledge from bible camp doesn't count.\" She dismissed.\n\nThe pair both stopped to listen to the house. A slight creak somewhere led them both to look. It didn't matter that it was daylight. It was the fact they knew he was taking a nap in his room. Or at least he should be.\n\n\"Zane is inhuman. Sure.\" Matt offered. \"But we should give him a chance. You did.\"\n\nShe finished her cigarette. Running the butt under the faucet. \"That was before I heard him speak like that.\"\n\nNow it was Matt's turn to palm the table. \"I told you last year-\"\n\nThe little figure standing in the nearest door caught their attention. Zane rubbing his little eyes with a hand.\n\n\"Hi sweetie.\" Holly said with a large smile.\n\n\"Mother. I know. I heard you.\" Zane shrugged. \"It's okay.\"\n\nThe pair of them looked at him as he wandered around the kitchen for a moment before he finally held up his arms at Matt's side.\n\n\"Um, what is it?\" Matt finally asked him.\n\n\"I'm a little too short to get up there.\" Zane outlined. His lack of frustration palpable even with the dead eyes.\n\nMatt did as expected and sat their child at the counter in an open chair.\n\n\"Thank you.\" He said as he adjusted himself slightly in the seat.\n\nHe noted their expressions at his arrival. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"It's the whole 'my son being inhuman' part.\" Holly explained to him, an arm under her chin. Zane glanced at Matt for confirmation. He was only met with an equally perplexed look.\n\n\"You must understand.\" He said in a solid tone. \"This is more complicated than you think.\"\n\n\"Take your time. We have all day.\"\n\n\"I was wondering when he'd kill us in our sleep actually.\"\n\n\"Matt.\"\n\n\"Honest statement since we're all being honest...\" Matt confirmed as he raised his hands in defeat.\n\n\"Father, I would never.\" Zane raised an eyebrow. \"Mother, I had no clue you imbibed such. It isn't healthy.\"\n\n\"I get that. But that's beside the point.\"\n\nShe shuffled the pack away from him. Not that he seemed interested. But still, the general gesture imprinted on her mind.\n\n\"This human form is in fact limiting.\" He frowned a little. \"But that's to be expected.\"\n\n\"As opposed to what?\" Holly asked him sternly. \"What is so limiting?\"\n\n\"I have another question,\" Matt added. \"Are we really your parents? Because we're both human.\"\n\nZane opened his mouth to speak. Then closed it. Then looked at Holly. Before side eyeing Matt. He looked back at Holly, then harder at Matt. Holly seemed to follow him and then began staring at Matt too.\n\n\"...Right?\" Matt reacted. \"Right??\"\n\n\"What are you?\" She asked first.\n\nZane raised a small hand. \"It's more of a question of what he did.\"\n\nMatt dropped his shoulders at this.\n\n\"Matt, what did you do?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Is he saying I'm not human?\"\n\nZane simply took a deep breath which seemed to almost inflate his little figure. \"So you don't know?\"\n\n\"That I was a normal person. I grew up and went to school like everyone else. Got married and got a job. Then had a baby.\" He rattled off. \"Yeah. I remember all of that.\"\n\n\"It's worse than I thought.\" Zane glanced.\n\n---\n\nHave to take a break here.\n\n"Alright. None of this makes any sense." Holly said as she took another sip of her soda.

"Good." Zane admitted. "It won't."

"What? What won't?" Matt asked.

Zane reached over to his dad's arm. And crawled up it like a bug. Holly went to say something, but he already leaned into his father's ear. He said something, at least she thought it was. But it became clear he'd actually latched onto the ear. Her 3 year old child was gnawing on Matt's ear.

And then it was over. Matt laid across the countertop, spasming, a trickle of blood leaving his ear canal. Zane standing over him. His face carrying a look as though he was more worried about his mother's frozen expression than the fact he'd apparently sent his father into a seizure.

"Matt?" She began to move. "Matt??"

Matt sat up.

Holly stood up. The chair banging against the floor as she considered whether to run towards him, or away from both of them.

His eyes were black too now. Endless pits to seemingly nowhere.

Holly, hands fumbling, snatched a cleaver from a drawer on her side. "What'd you do to him?!"

She danced on her toes slightly, gathering a better grip on the handle of the knife as she watched him finish some deep breaths.

Matt spoke something to Zane. The pair conversing some impossible language to each other for a brief. Before he turned to face her.

"It's alright Holly." He finally explained. "I'm just fine."

Holly didn't believe him, she scooted to the far corner of the island. Pointing at the pair of them with the cleaver as if she could chop her way out of whatever nightmare she woke up to this morning.

"What'd you do to him?" She repeated.

She realized she'd left her phone on their side of the table.

Zane slowly spoke, "I gave him his body back."

"His body back." She followed carefully.

"Yes. My body back." Matt explained. "It's... a bit uncomfortable. It always is."

"What are you?"

She shook after asking that. The air in the room seemingly filled with static charge that made her hairs stand on edge.

"I'm still your husband. He's still your son."

There was movement as he swept the cleaver from her and let it clatter into the water and ashes at the bottom of the sink. The move so deliberate, it actually caused her to let it go on instinct. He hadn't left a mark, yet the power behind it made her shrink back.

"Are you familiar with the concept that there's a world beyond this one?" He asked her.

He'd walked the few feet to her so quickly it took her a moment to catch up and register that he'd closed in.

"Like an, an afterlife?" She blinked.

"Not for the dead." He answered. "For the living."

"...I don't really understand."

"I told you it wouldn't make sense." Zane chided from over Matt's shoulder.

"The hell are you people?" She fretted. "Am I one of you?"

"No. And that's another matter." Matt promised. "But that's not the problem."

She sensed danger again.

"What's the problem then?"

"Well, in due time, all becomes clear." He alluded. "What'd that storybook say? 'Be not afraid'."

The fact he smiled at this chilled her to the bone. But with that, he blinked and his eyes were normal. Zane's eyes were also normal now, as he sat on the edge of the counter.

"But, worry about that later." Matt smiled.

He promptly walked over and one armed Zane to his shoulder without a care in the world. "Wanna' go get ice cream?"

Holly stayed in place longer than they hoped. But eventually she gradually came over to the pair of them.

"Okay?" She decided. "Does ice cream help with your human form. Or something?"

"No?" Matt balked. "I just really want some right now." The pair smirking as though all was right with the world.

"...Alright. Let's go get something to eat." She stopped. "You might want to. Wipe the blood off."

"I did." He answered.

And to her alarm, it was already gone.
