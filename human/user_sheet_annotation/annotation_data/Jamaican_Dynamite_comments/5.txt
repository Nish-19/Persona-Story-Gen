#### Story ####
Go figure the entire building would burn down. Not just one apartment. No. The whole building.\n\n\nBut all things considered, it could have been worse. He saved the wife. He saved the kids. He saved the dog. Job well done. And on top of that, everyone else in the building was also accounted for.\n\n\nIt was a tragedy. But it wasn't a complete disaster.\n\n\nAnd so, Hesher found himself taking calls out of a local hotel room. It wasn't the best place to have an office. But it was discreet and he had enough spare cash to rent out two rooms.\n\n\nOne for the family. One for business.\n\n\nExplaining why you came home covered in injuries and somebody's else blood isn't exactly a good way to kick off the holiday season. The fact that half his Intel from leads went up with the complex didn't help either.\n\n\n\nSo when a knock came at the door, for once, he assumed the mundane. Insurance had been in touch, along with several other legal entities after things like this occur.\n\n\n\"Hello?\" He asked as he opened the door.\n\n\nNobody was in the hall.\n\n\nHe reached at the back of his pants, hand at the ready. No one to the left. No one to the right. Normally, there was at least somebody walking around.\n\n\nThe idea came to quickly check the door of the room across the hall. His wife's. It was locked.\n\n\n\nSomething grabbed his arm. And something else wrapped his head. And then something breathed near his neck.\n\n\nHe was seated in a chair now. It was soft at least. His mind however went immediately to his family.\n\n\n\"Hesher.\" A familiar voice rose. \"I'm sorry. Let's begin from the top. Hesham Saeed. Born in 1990. Morocco. Casablanca, no less! Blood type, B+...\"\n\n\nSomeone ran a cold hand lightly across his neck. \"Here's looking at you kid.\"\n\n\nHe heard someone snap their fingers. \"Right, where are my manners? Someone take that off him?\"\n\n\nHe was greeted to a rather ornate office. A large and dark desk panned out. And behind it stood a rather familiar woman in a rather expensive dress.\n\n\n\"Salome.\" Hesham adjusted. \"Queen of the West.\"\n\n\n\"Not the full title. She toothily corrected. But, close enough.\"\n\n\nHe was all to familiar with her inner circle. They'd each battled back and forth with Hesher and many friends of his for the better part of his life. Not all of them made it out alive. And so the never ending feud continued.\n\n\n\n\"You can untie him.\" She directed. Her\u00a0accent giving the words a rather light tone.\n\n\n\"I'm still alive. Why?\" He asked first.\n\n\n\"I already ate.\" She said.\n\n\nHe watched her retrieve a glass of wine. At least he assumed it was wine. A quick observation of the texture on the glass told him it definitely wasn't.\n\n\n\"Though, I do love a good A Negative from time to time. It reminds me of someone near and dear to my heart.\"\n\n\n\"You kidnapped me for a blood tasting?\"\n\n\n\"No, Hesher.\" Salome cleaned her teeth. \"I hear you're currently, what's the word mortals use for it? Homeless.\"\n\n\n\"And?\" Hesher urged on carefully.\n\n\n\"The world is very different from when I left it.\" She admitted. \"I understand exactly how harsh it can still be. Your family is in the room across the hall at that hotel, no?\"\n\n\n\"If you do anything-\" He spat.\n\n\n\"Fique tranquilo.\" She said, now at his right. A finger resting on his lips. He didn't know when she moved.\n\n\n\"If I wanted them dead. We'd be having a much more, personal talk, right now.\" She promised warmly. \"No. I want to gift you a home.\"\n\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\n\"A house. A domicile. A place to.\" She narrowed her eyes. \"Okay, you guys can bring them in.\"\n\n\n\"Wait! Wait...\" Hesher shouted.\n\n\n\"I kid. I kid.\" She assured. \"They are safe. You inadvertently helped my flock at one point. And you weren't the first of your lineage to do so for me.\"\n\n\nHis eyes were still locked on hers in fear of the obvious.\n\n\n\"So I'm offering your family a house. We have several properties in this city's limits alone. You get your pick.\"\n\n\nShe returned to her chair. \"But, you have to do some work for me in turn.\"\n\n\nHe glanced at her entourage of guards. One of them simply nodded his head towards his boss with an equally sharp grin.\n\n\n\"Such as?\"\n\n\n\"There's been some trouble with some of my latest investments.\" Salome explained. \"And we figured we needed the human touch. What do you say? Care to learn more?\"\n\n\nIt wasn't like they were going to let him walk out of here. He knew better than that.\"\n\n\n\"...I'm listening.\n\n"You're a useful man, Hesh. Remember that. This envelope has the address, and should cover your usual down payment. Yeah?"

The building didn't exactly look like much. A relatively blank strip mall, sitting off the edge of one of the freeways that cut through town. One end contained a long dead box store. The other an equally boarded up restaurant.

"After all, despite our conflicts, we both go back much farther than you think."

There were a few stores in the middle. But he focused on the relatively empty vape store just off center. No sense in being on offense immediately. It seemed like the place was empty.

The door chime went off and he wandered near the displays while he expected someone to show up.

"Hello?" He finally asked. "I'm wanting to buy something?"

Nobody answered. He walked up to the main booth surrounding the register. He didn't spot it the first time. However, the blood trailing off the keys of the register and the puddle on the floor below.

Hesham did the right thing and checked his gloves. Then locked the door and switched the sign over to 'Closed'.

Things started off odd. The puddle turned into a drip pattern. It was a bit old, but it was still drying. It led behind the booth towards another door. The stock room, was a different story. A bigger smear on a wall gradually fading orange on its way to brown.

And more drip pattern. He followed it down the shelves. Until it disappeared. He walked towards the rear exit. Then went back and cleared the store again.

Then he noted the small trace on the edge of the box. Moving that, he noticed how the shelving loosened. He moved the two next to that one and saw more blood on the plywood.

Underneath the lowest shelf was a door. They said there was one. It was what that number pattern was for. Turn the key, ten seconds to type the pattern, turn the key again.

He turned the key and the keypad lit up. It took him some concentration. But he turned the key the second time. And the door released. It folded up to the second shelf. And he drew aim at whatever was downstairs.

The drips were thinner. But the temperature was dropping. Fast.

Below the shop was some sort of lab. In it were several beds. Hospital beds. Opposite that, were several commercial fridges. The other medical equipment meant a few things.

Blood bank? Or does that include organs?

The question came as someone rushed from another room. The figure hissing sharply as Hesham spun and staked their arm to a bed.

He dodged a swipe, a bite, another swipe, a talon. And staked the man again.

Hesham drew to finish him off. But someone else behind the attacker did that for him.

There was a brief moment of suspense as the vampire's head rolled across the floor before burning away

"...You move fast." This one spoke.

He kept his gun on her. She wasn't exactly as forward as her friend was.

"My boss sent you?" She stepped back from the skeleton on the floor. "Right?"

Considering her apparel was more fitting for something casual like a vape shop. And less for attacking a well armed hunter up close and personal.

"You work here?"

"Well, I did. But it seems like I'm all out of refills." She lamented. "They took them all. The bags too."

"How do I know you're not lying?"

The phone rang. Her phone. She answered.

"Yes, miss... Yes, he's here... Looks and smells like the guy." She winked.

He didn't lower the gun yet. She tapped the screen and waited.

"So they took the stock we had? Hesher?"

"I'd say so."

"Okay, new plan. Escort Camille here to a safe location. Camille? Are any of the others still around?"

"No?" She sighed. "They didn't make it."

"Accompany our new hire here. Meet up with our mutual friend. I'll send you the coordinates."

Camille let the call end, and she watched the man conceal the silver stakes he'd used.

"We shouldn't stay Hesher." She finally stated.

"No, we shouldn't." Hesham agreed.
