#### Writing Prompt ####
A retired lawyer turned small-town judge navigates quirky cases, stubborn defendants, and his daughter's sharp wit, all while grappling with the weight of justice and the peculiarities of prairie life.


#### Story ####
A deer came right through the windshield, her father says, and taps the stretch of glass in front of him. Came right through, and knocked the guy into the backseat.
The deer was dead on impact? she asks.
Come on, he chuckles, pushing the car lighter in. What saved the guy was not wearing a seat belt. First thing, the car ran up onto the train tracks.
Of course a train was coming.
Somebody going the other way stopped and dragged him off just in time. If he’d had that seat belt on, he would have been pinned inside.
His seat belt swings limply against the car wall, where it has been sprung from its buzzer. I rest my case, she says. I’ll watch for deer instead.
He laughs and lights his cigar.
What do they call those small white birds that sit on the backs of the cows? she asks.
Ibis, he says, between puffs. Just like in Africa.
She pulls idly at the dangling seat belt. I knew that, she says.
He drives past a windmill, the single perpendicular in any direction, its blades chopping the air in blurred circles. From inside the car, no other sign of wind is evident across the empty prairie except for the car’s shuddering on the county correction curves. Look at those pretty polka-dot horses, he says, by way of staying awake.
That’s what they call pinto, right? she says.
Appaloosa. Pinto’s for the beans. I grow beans. Those are pinto beans.
He sticks her free arm toward the scraggly rows that fight the brush. Some days I like growing beans better than judging. Judging gives me a stomachache.
In Africa, she says, all the cases come to you—or else you get borne on a litter to the next one.
What a good idea—the weight of justice on the plaintiff’s neck. He knocks ash off his cigar. That sure would shorten up a case or two.
A small town reveals itself a mile off, signaled by a long stretch of fence posts covered, each one, by a cowboy boot. He slows when they come to the town’s single intersection, turns down its one street, and parks in front of an old schoolhouse marked café.
This is what education’s come to, he says. Or else they turn the schools into junk stores full of antiques—this one’s antique food.
When they enter, the prosecuting attorney lifts his coffee spoon toward them from the first booth. You’re late, he says, with a smile that looks easy.
If I’m early, I have to pay the check, he says. My daughter, the one out of Africa.
Welcome back, says the attorney, shaking hands. Not much of a tan.
It’s been ten years, she says.
A person gets marked, says her father. She’s a marked woman.
Dad, she says. That’s right out of the movies.
A masculine blonde swings out two plastic-coated menus by way of a signal and herds them into the booth. The three of them turn their faces up to her as she pulls a green guest check out of her waistband. Nothing special today, she says.
They order, and the waitress writes nothing down.
The attorney sighs into his coffee cup. Did you know, my dear, that right here is the richest town per capita outside of Saudi Arabia. I mean it—with the cattle market the way it is. And they can’t even put together a decent lunch. Probably just like in Africa.
It wasn’t hard to order lunch in Africa, she says. You ate what there was.
The attorney looks at her father. She sure is one of yours.
She’s not around much anymore. I blame that on her trip. He smiles and pulls napkins out of the container. So who’s done what to whom this week? What happened to the harassment?
Out of court. They moved in with each other.
Ah, crime, her father says, rubbing his hands across the napkins. She files a complaint every time she’s in season.
As regular as a bear, says the attorney. Pardon me, he says to her.
We’re out of vegetables, interrupts the waitress, unloading her forearm of plates. How about crackers as a substitute? She offers sealed Saltines.
With pickle relish? says her father. That’ll qualify.
She leaves six packets of crackers, and they eat slabs of meat and mounds of starch, and the attorney picks his teeth. I heard about you, he says. You worried your father.
Not Dad, the guy who won’t wear a seat belt.
Seat belts? That’s just another thing those car people make you pay for. You know his problem? The attorney points his toothpick at her father’s forehead. He’s got imagination. He’s a soft-hearted bastard who gets bad dreams. Am I right, or what?
Her father pats the ketchup off his face. I’m just a farmer with opinions. That’s why they elected me.
Right. The attorney leans forward. Just one of the best lawyers in this part of the country. When are you going to stick this judging business and get back to some real law?
That’s laying it on a little thick. Her father waves at the waitress and points at his cup.
The coffee’s actually good, says the attorney.
The waitress pours three lukewarm cups, then, with great flourish, signs her name to the bottom of the check and places it onto the table.
The attorney picks it up.
What? Paying for poison? Her father laughs. That’s what I call influencing the judge. He slaps him on the shoulder and takes the check away.
They file out of the café onto the half-buried cracked sidewalk and blink into the sun. So that was fine. Her father moves his belt a notch and retucks his shirt. See you next week.
Oh, there’s just one little thing. The attorney finds a document he’s stuck in the folds of his newspaper. They’re in jail now if you want to have a talk with them.
Her father glances at the paper, and then again, rubbing his eyes behind his glasses. A dog case? You need an autopsy for a dog case?
Hey, says the attorney. It could’ve died in Kellen County and turned out to be somebody else’s problem entirely.
With the attorney following them, they drive the three blocks to the county jail. How’s your digestion? she asks.
Guilty, he says. He turns the car onto the upgrade next to the sheriff’s car. Three young men loiter under a tree in front.
Just look at the silver on that one, she says. It’s a wonder they can stand upright.
Rodeo awards, says her father. They make the buckles bigger every year.
They’re friends of the accused, says the attorney, coming around to the jail door. There’s a cow meet this afternoon, and we’ve got the best wranglers inside.
You do have a little something, says her father.
Oh, boy, says the attorney, holding the door open for them.
The sheriff is asleep at his desk as if he’s being paid to do it. They don’t bother him, they walk through a door marked Open where a bare lightbulb dangles overhead and two chairs meet a table. Just look at this, says the attorney.
A county section map is tacked to the wall behind him. Pinned to it is a cutout of a collie. Red string radiates from its belly fur in a crazy crisscross. Here’s the gas station, he says, pointing to a green-headed pin. And here’s where we found the body. He presses a black-headed pin a foot away.
You just don’t have enough to fuss around with here, do you? says her father.
Well, says the attorney, yes.
That sure is a long way for a tail to keep burning, her father says, tracing the string.
They put the nozzle into her and gassed her up. The attorney fiddles with a chair back. Somebody had a match. After she caught, she tried to bite her rear end. The way they do.
I get it. Her father ducks his head as if avoiding the cruelty. You don’t have to stick around here if you don’t want to, he says to her.
She shakes her head.
He turns back to the attorney. So, who do you want me to talk to?
Actually, the parents. They just want to leave some money and have the whole thing dismissed. They can pay, believe me.
That’s letting them off pretty easy, says her father, taking a Tums. The punishment should fit the crime I think. Like they do in Africa.
I don’t know, she says. An eye for an eye?
Punishment? The attorney looks nervous. They’ll fight it.
Her father looks disgusted as if the attorney himself did the job on the dog. Let them go to the Supreme Court for all I care. Big deal. First off, collect the bail. You can make that big. Then they’ll get to half-strangle calves in the rodeo and be happy. I’ll come back in a week when it cools down a little and try them.
If you say so, says the attorney.
Her father looks out the window at the rodeo contestants. And remember, this isn’t settled out of court like your bear woman. This is the State versus a bunch of mean rich kids.
The attorney fools with his tie clip. I’ll tell them.
They drive to the next outpost where at least there is a Dairy Queen, and drink malts leaned up against the hot car. I’ll have each of them tied to a dog for a week, day and night, her father says. The first I hear of any abuse, they’ll really pay.
Ah, civilization, she says.
He’s fumbling around for a new cigar. You know, he says, my stomach feels better now that I’ve decided on a sentence. Maybe I could get used to this judging.
In Africa where I went, if the judge turns out to be wrong, he has to serve the sentence.
He raises his eyebrows like he doesn’t have to believe her. Why did I waste all that worry on you?
You never worry, she says, her straw making noise at the bottom of the cup.
He lit his cigar. Maybe. He looked at her over his puffing. But maybe I drive a little slower when I have you around.
