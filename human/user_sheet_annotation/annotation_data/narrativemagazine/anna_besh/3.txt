#### Writing Prompt ####
After returning home, you find an old cassette tape of childhood recordings that stirs up memories—some warm, some heavy, and some you’re not sure you’re ready to face. What do you do with the flood of emotions it brings?


#### Story ####
My mom picked me up from the airport at 11:58 p.m., well past her bedtime. I hopped into my sister’s gold Honda CR-V, which my mom was driving because her car was in the shop, and found her listening to an old cassette, a recording of Helen and me from when we were little.
“Listen to this,” she said smiling, and turned up the volume.
“I was trying to record you saying ‘Dada,’ but you never quite get there.”
The recording went on for about twenty minutes, a seven-month-old me cooing happily, a three-year-old Helen with a three-year-old voice. “Come on, Abbie, let’s go,” she said, her tiny voice full of sass and spunk. Hearing the recording, my chest swelled in expectation, like watching a movie I’d seen a long time ago, remembering how the story would change—by no means a tragedy but without the tied-up resolution everyone expected. I wanted to take Helen’s three-year-old shoulders and pull her into a firm hug. “Do you have any idea how important you are?”
In the recording she began to cough, and our mom, with a hint of frustration, said, “Gracious!” Hearing it twenty years later, I wondered how many consecutive nights she’d gone without sleep. She was painting a bedroom, trying to be a good mother, wife, Catholic.
“Why did you say ‘gracious’ like that?” Helen mimicked our mom’s slight exasperation, filling it in with anger.
Mom winced at the recording, and I’m sure it was painful to hear her twenty-seven-year-old exhaustion caricatured by a three-year-old.
The tape whirred, then came to a stop with a gentle click. We drove through empty Memphis suburbs in comfortable silence, made our way along Raleigh LaGrange Road, finally rolling into the dark driveway, alive with summer air. The world was fragrant. Damp earth, cool grass, warm, heavy. Home. I stepped into the brightly lit kitchen, made a piece of toast, and went to bed.
I didn’t sleep as long as I’d hoped. Travel disrupted whatever rhythm there’d been in my body, and I was up by seven.
“Do you want me to take you to pick up your car?” I offered, searching for a way to fill the empty morning.
We climbed back into the CR-V, and Mom pulled a 1999 Ben Harper cassette from the stack on the center console. Looking out the passenger window at the flat, hot summer, I found myself singing along. The window caught glints of morning sun and offered snapshots of the girl I must have been once but now hardly recognized. She had a messy middle part, blonde peach-fuzz legs, and knew all the words to “Steal My Kisses.”
We pulled into the entrance of the Nissan dealership off of Covington, which has better service than the one in Collierville, and Mom gathered her belongings: a cross-body purse full of pens, hand lotion, Kleenex, little glass hearts, and a St. Christopher medal; a 20-ounce thermos of steaming Emperor’s Cloud tea, the green metallic paint chipping around the lip; a set of Bose headphones draped casually around her neck like a piece of statement jewelry. She held it all so naturally, each item an extension of her.
The guy helping us ushered her into her newly serviced car, and I climbed over to the driver’s side of the CR-V, adjusting the mirrors and seat. Pulling out into the right lane of morning traffic, I fumbled for the volume knob on the stereo. I skipped a handful of Ben Harper songs, listening for something different, though I wasn’t sure what. The tape flipped over, and the song that filled the car took me back to the purple-gray time of Helen’s teenage depression, when she never left her room, didn’t talk or eat much–somewhere I hadn’t been in quite a while. A heaviness sank into my shoulders and under my eyes. I felt alone again, a stark contrast to our warm infant closeness. The song carried me into the backseat of our mom’s navy-blue minivan, raindrops racing to the edge of the window, losing themselves in one another, while I imagined the wild-eyed woman in the song in her white nightgown, mourning, lonely, desperate. The sadness and fear almost swallowed me, and remembering it made me drive faster, as if I could lose it in the twists and turns of Raleigh LaGrange Road.
“Really, we’re all just lonely for ourselves,” my mom said matter-of-factly, when later that day I mentioned the hollowness of that song.
