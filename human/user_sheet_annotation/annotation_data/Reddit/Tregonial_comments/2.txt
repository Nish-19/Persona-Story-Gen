#### Writing Prompt ####
A human woman is employed as a maid for a rich vampire. She is almost comically oblivious to the fact both her employer and coworkers are vampiric.


#### Story ####
"Rise and shine!" Amy pulled the drab black curtains aside while greeting her lovely new employer, Countess Elizabeth.
Who had this peculiar habit of sleeping in a coffin of lacquered wood, padded with red satin inside. After some annoyed screams, the countess rose from her coffin to slam the curtains shut and go right back inside.
Definitely not a morning person.
Amy tried patting out the thick smoke that billowed from the countess, who only grumbled about burnt skin and ruined makeup. Or so that's what Amy thinks she said. Her employer almost slammed the coffin lid shut on her fingers, but Amy was fast enough to get out of the way.
Whistling to herself, Amy exited the mistress' bedchambers and headed out to clean the rest of the castle. It's really tough when it turns out none of the other servants wake up in the day too. Ordinarily, she'd file a complaint at the Domestic Employee Union, but the pay is too good.
The folks who live here have this bad habit of spilling red wine everywhere after their late-night parties. How they even get it so high up on the living room wall is a total mystery. But Amy isn't paid to ponder upon these things. She's paid to clean.
It is to her relief Jeff is awake. And climbing the walls like a creepy spider monkey to help her clean things up. His uncanny ability to get anywhere to remove stain is something she always wanted to learn from him.
"Thanks, Jeff. Glad to see you're up and working too."
"You're welcome, Amy," Jeff bowed and seemed to float away.
"Wait, Jeff," she called out to him. "You have some red wine stains on your sleeves. I have a mirror you can use."
Despite his insistence, Amy pressed him into using it. Not that it proved useful. For once, it didn't reflect Jeff's face at all, nor show him where the stain was. But he got it out all the same with a simple scrub of a handkerchief he produced from his breast pocket.
"Sorry I wasn't of much help," Amy said.
Jeff waved off her concern and assured her he was fine.
The countess' son was the first of the noble family to rise. George was a peculiar young man who liked to nibble on her neck. Sometimes, he'd leave a cute love bite. Others, there would be a little blood, but he'd licked it off playfully. If it were any other man, Amy would have complained to the Domestic Employee Union about harassment. But its kinda cute when it came from George for reasons she can't explain. Maybe its his charisma. Perhaps she felt a strange giddy feeling when he did it, however brief.
"Greetings Amy. Do take care not to disturb my mother's mannequin collection today."
Ah, that reminded her of that occasion she picked the lock to a storeroom to clean it. She was adamant she wanted to keep every corner clean. Unwilling to be stopped by a simple lock, she entered the room to find rows upon rows of mannequins.
They were all so realistic, they seemed to breathe. Like those sci-fi movies, where humans were kept in suspended animation. Held up by long chains. Connected to long tubes that snaked around, except in this castle, the tubes were red.
Yup, the countess really loved red. And black. Typical gothic aesthetics of a rich noble family. Amy had many questions about these mannequins. But she wasn't paid to ask. She was paid to clean.
So, her first reaction when she accidentally broke a tube that began spraying red liquid onto the floor was to wipe the floor. The butler Vorg nagged about the waste of a perfectly preserved meal. Probably because the countess forced him to stop eating his dinner to help her out. That's what he said.
She likes Vorg. Even if his jokes are really weird and not funny. Like that time he joked about farming humans like cattle. Amy doesn't even see a farm anywhere near the castle grounds. But she appreciated any attempt to lighten the mood while they were working.
Are rich people and the company they keep always this eccentric?
Turns out, Countess Elizabeth has even more bizarre friends. Lord Elvari probably takes the cake. Dude claimed to be some kind of tentacle god. A very ancient one that can see a curse hanging over her head. Some spell by a witch who cursed people to think that supernatural entities are just strange humans who really are into this gothic Halloween look.
"[I've seen this curse in another woman](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/188r5lk/wp_youre_completely_oblivious_to_the_supernatural/kbntqef/), Amy," he spoke in a rather grave tone. "I can remove the spell if you wish."
"No offense, my lord, but this is the third time you've said this same joke. You should trade jokes with Vorg," she pointed in the butler's direction. "Maybe break his curse. I'm telling you, he's the one under some magic that messed up his sense of humour."
"Perhaps you mean, sucked him dry of humour?" The pale lord chuckled.
Amy laughed at what was probably the first good joke she heard in the castle for a long time.
"What brings you here on this day?" She couldn't resist asking.
He flashed her one of those charming smiles. "I'm here to retrieve some mannequins. Don't tell Elizabeth, okay?"
"Okay."

Elizabeth was screaming about the empty storeroom. Something about her stolen humans and a massive loss of her blood supply, before correcting herself to say it was red wine instead.
Amy said nothing. She promised Lord Elvari. She wasn't paid to ask questions. She was paid to clean. According to the countess, the lord had left a trail of broken tubes and shattered chains in the storeroom. Amy had a lot of work to do.
