\[Time In. Time Out.\]
“I got away with it…,” Steel Bullet laughed to himself as he said it out loud. There was no one around to hear him. Not on the windy, frigid mountain peak. After the trial was dismissed, he asked for some time alone and everyone thought they understood. It was a reasonable request after the constant attention. What none of them knew was that he wanted to celebrate because everything had gone his way. 
Steel Bullet the hero had murdered literally thousands of people by now, and that only amounted to a few charges out of the dozens brought against him. He had plenty of vocal support in the league, and a strong case in the court of public opinion. There were cheers in the streets when the judge dismissed the case on the grounds that he was a certified hero doing his job, and he couldn't be expected to control collateral damage from villain attacks. No one could prove he watched and intentionally let buildings fall on people. No matter how often it seemed to happen.
“I should change it up a bit though…, “ he realized there would still be some scrutiny on him in the short term at least.  “...maybe take a break altogether.” He knew he wouldn't, but it was the thought that counted. For a brief instant, he considered changing his ways even if only temporarily. He might have gotten away with it, but could he really keep pushing his luck like that? After the short thought experiment, he decided that yes. He was after all, invincible. And now that included the figurative sense too. 
Then, as soon as his commitment to violence was renewed, he blinked. Something about that particular time felt different than the dozens of other tones he'd already blinked just facing down the cold, biting wind. He couldn't put his finger on why it was different other than the fact that he noticed the action. And, of course, the teenage girl with white and orange hair that stood in front of him when he opened his eyes. She wasn't there when started the blink. She introduced herself before Steel Bullet could ask anything; but, not before he realized he couldn't. 
“Hi, I'm Quinn, and I don't want to be here, so we're going somewhere warmer,” she made a dismissive gesture at him, then he blinked again. This time, he opened his eyes to see a golden sunset taking place behind Quinn. The sun was resting on the ocean horizon, and he could hear the gentle waves. “This is much better…,” she nodded.  “So, you probably have questions, and you've noticed you can't ask them.” He tried, unsuccessfully, to nod at least. His body refused to follow his instructions. 
“Chroma Corp. sent me to deal with you. I haven't decided how to do that yet. I know, I know, you've never heard of Chroma Corp., right?“ she asked rhetorically. 
“The short answer is they are the corporation that paid off the judge to dismiss your case. The reason they did that is because you're stupid guilty and basically a horrible person,” she giggled at him with a smile. It was the first time she'd shown any warmth toward him and it was an insult. 
“So, the issue is Chroma Corp. is about to buy up the Super League on your Earth, and your demented hobbies are nothing but bad press. I'm gonna let you talk now, if you're willing to be calm and civil about it. You with me so far?” she asked. 
Steel Bullet felt like he had his voice again. He could wiggle his fingers and even feel the warm breeze on his skin. He hadn't noticed it until that moment, and he didn't waste any time. As soon as he was sure he could move, he flew forward at top speed determined to put a fist through her head. He chose his name because instant acceleration was the main aspect of his super power. The super strength and steel-tough skin were more like bonuses. But, despite how fast he moved, somehow he still had time to blink in mid-flight. 
When he opened his eyes his fist was a half inch away from Quinn's sparkling orange eyes. 
“Well, I guess that makes things simpler for me,” She shrugged. “Thanks for helping me choose the best way to deal with you. But, uh…,”  she glanced around the beach. “Not here.”. 
Steel Bullet blinked again and they were somewhere else. A dank, dim cave. It would have been pitch black if it wasn't for the digital clock affixed to the cave wall directly in his view with glowing orange numbers. Though. It was only four zeroes on the far right on the long clock, completely off center on the display. 
“So, you probably haven't figured it out yet, but I can control time. Right now, I've time-locked your entire body. You don't even have to breathe, but I'm letting your mind, eyes and ears still work so we can have this conversation. Every time you blink, like so…, “ he blinked as she made the comment. “...this timer will show you how much time you missed.”  she pointed at it and the time now read ‘00:14’.  “That's fourteen seconds. Or, we can go longer. 
This time he opened his eyes and the timer said, '02:39’. 
“Got it? Good,” Quinn giggled.  “So, here's the punishment, I'm gonna give you time to think about what you've done. I'm going to leave you here for a little while, no idea how long,” she shrugged. “Don't worry you won't die or anything.  But, I want you to really take it slow and THINK about the things you've done. So, I'm going to force slow thinking… like this.”
Steel Bullet blinked and opened his eyes 10 minutes later according to the clock. 
“Randomly. Every now and then, your time will stop fully. And a random amount of time will pass before it starts again. I think that's all the effort on want to put onto this, so I'm leaving now. I've given you the basics on how it works. Good luck! “ Quinn waved with a smile.
“Oh, by the way, don't worry about a thing. None of your friends will worry about you. We already have another version of you lined up from an alternate universe ready to step in as ‘Steel Bullet’, but nicer. You've already built an amazing reputation. From a business perspective, it's a shame to let that go to waste. Bye!” she disappeared as easily as Steel Bullet was teleported to different locations. 
It was a lot to take in but he wished he had a chance to ask questions. All he was left with were his own thoughts. 
“Did she say alternate universe?” he asked himself, then blinked. He opened his eyes three hours later. 
“What the fu-,” he blinked.  48 hours went by before he opened his eyes again. 
“Uccckkkkkkkkkk.”.
