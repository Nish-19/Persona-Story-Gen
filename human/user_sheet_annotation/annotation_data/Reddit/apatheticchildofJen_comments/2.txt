The Princess is cursed, and only the kiss of her true love can wake her up. Many princes have been summoned, but as her closest servant and best friend, you are the only one who knows she does not even like men.


#### Story ####
It was hard for both of us. She hated men and you hated seeing her unhappy. You also both hated the curse. That goddamned curse. Until she got a kiss from her true love her kingdom would not prosper. Now the kingdom wasn’t failing by any means, but it was far from doing well. ‘Just scraping by’ as the advisors had put it. Unfortunately, ‘just scraping by’ was not enough to protect us from war. So the king and queen had called out for dam near every prince in the land to kiss her. They called for single kings and polyamorous ones. The summoned nobles from all over but still nothing. She must have been kissing a hundred men a day at one point. Her lips were chapped and her mood was lower than ever. And most of these men weren’t even gracious enough to make the kiss small. A simple peck would do by the wording of the curse, but no. They had to make it a full make out session. They had to get handsy and they just had to go to far. Almost every time I would have to pull them off and send them running. The king and queen were getting so desperate they had started calling on the lower class. But I knew all this would be in vain, you see, she didn’t like men. The princess was into women yet we all knew how that would end up. Enough princesses had been abandoned and rejected to tell us that revealing that secret would be a bad idea. But I couldn’t watch my kingdom suffer in fear of the war to come. Other kingdoms were becoming emboldened and our allies were becoming distant. If we couldn’t help them, why should they help us. It was only a matter of time, so I put out my own call. Albeit quieter than the other one. I put out a call to all the lost princesses. Together, the princess and I would sneak out of the castle every night to meet one of them. They would talk, get to know one another and if there was a spark, they would kiss. The curse had still not been lifted, but the princess’ mood had already lifted. She had hope, we both did. And we were making life long friendships along the way. She was also very happy to be kissing a tonne of beautiful, respectful women instead of hideous men. But where the true love’s kiss came from was a shock to us all.
It was another evening. We had ten more men from the army lined up to shoot their shot, but the princess was nowhere to be found. We all went searching together, looking in her room, in bathrooms and eventually in servants quarters.
When we did find her, she was locked in a broom closet with a maid. The king opened the door and gasped in shock and horror. I saw the two of them Break from what had obviously been a very passionate kiss, gasping. But then, before anyone could say anything, a bright light bathed us all. The princess started floating and we all had to turn away. When the light died down we all turned back to the princess and the maid looking nervously at the king. He too a while to speak.
“The words of a spell can never be false,” he said carefully, “if this is your true love then so be it.” The relief that spread across our faces overpowered any horror the suitors showed. The king took the maids hands.
“You have saved my kingdom from this dreaded curse. Please do us the honour of joining our family.”
The maid gave a curtsy, “I would be honoured my lord.”
The princess took her hand and together they left the closet.
