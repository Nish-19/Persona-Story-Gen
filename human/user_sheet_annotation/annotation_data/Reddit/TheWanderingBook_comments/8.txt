#### Writing Prompt ####
A serial killer runs a murder hotel and he's just chosen his latest victims. Unfortunately for him, the Addams Family think that his hotel is the highlight of their vacation.


#### Story ####
Alfonso was a young gentleman who just last year as inherited the family business: a motel at the end of the town.
Weirdly enough, 3 couples were last seen at his motel, before disappearing.
But due to the fact that the cameras of the motel...and the gas station across the street showed the couples leaving unharmed, Alfonso was only suspected, but not questioned.
Quite a funny oversight, considering that he's a serial killer, who used to travel to kill, but now took a comfier approach.
Today...a family arrives, and he is sure that they are they next victims.
"Such moodiness, look at the dust, oh the cobwebs, Cara Mia, this place is amazing!", the man said as he swooned over a tall, thin woman.
Two children entered after them.
"Hmm, the spirits of this place are angry...good, it means it's an acceptable place to rest at.", the young girl said.
"Can I try my new grenade?
I put it in thin lead covered spider eggs! I want to see if the spiderlings survive the explosion and hatch!", the young boy said.
Alfonso, who saw this smiled.
"What a bunch of posers...I doubt they will be missed.", he thought, as he welcomed them.
The Addams family got neighboring rooms at the Sunset Motel, and Alfonso started his work.
At the breakfast, he expected the usual: unease, and quick retreat of the guests to their room...but it didn't happen.
"Oh, Alfonso my dear, this is a wonderful tea.
Wolfbane, arsenic and a hint of some viper poison?
We want a vial of all, please.", the woman, called Morticia said, as she sipped the tea.
Alfonso was shocked, but just nodded.
At night, he released sleeping gas enough to knock out a herd of elephants into their rooms.
But as soon as he approached the children's room, the door opened.
"Oh, please, increase the quality of the gas, not the quantity...
This just makes Pugsley snore.", the young girl said...completely unaffected by the gas.
Alonso smiled, and nodded, but his thoughts were getting darker.
During the next few days, he tried once more to poison them, he set free spiders, lizards, and snakes inside the motel...all caught and taken as pets by the young girl called, Wednesday.
He activated all the traps...which were used as morning exercise devices by the man...Gomez.
On the last day, at breakfast, he finally couldn't stand it...and tried to stab Morticia in the heart, but Gomez appeared out of nowhere, took the knife in his mouth...and started dancing with his wife.
Alfonso broke down...none of his tries actually worked.
Seeing Alfonso on his knees...panting, Gomez and Morticia exchanged looks.
"I see, we the Addams' are not stingy.
Young man your Motel is one of the bests we have ever been, second only to the Old One's Shadow from the Bermudas.
Please, take this as an extra payment for this amazing experience.", Gomez said, taking out...three ingots of gold, and putting them in front of Alfonso.
"Yes...this place is romantic...reminds me of the early days when we were chased by the townsfolk...", Morticia said, and her and Gomez started swooning over each other.
"Nice try, but you are too green.
Better luck next time.", Wednesday said, with her cold gaze, while Pugsley just followed his family, toying with...with a C4.
Alfonso closed the Motel not long after, retiring...to the disappointment of the Addams family, who tried to visit it a year later...
