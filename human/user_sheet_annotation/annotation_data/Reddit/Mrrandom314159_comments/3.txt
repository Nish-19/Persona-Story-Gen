#### Writing Prompt ####
You are stranded in the middle of the forest in winter, and your only company is a stranger on the other side of a handheld radio. They are very far away.


#### Story ####
The mountain pass here collects the snow durong Winter. We essentially get cut off from the world for 6 months out of the year, sometimes more if it's one of those weather pattern years.
This year... it's bad.
Pretty much everyone in town left once the almanac was released back in August. It was a mad dash to make sure everything was locked down.
I... didn't really have anywhere to go. Family, friends, romance... it all just sorta faded away through the years.
A nice young woman came by and gave me an old radio, for emergencies, she said. She's a nice one, but I said I'd be fine.
It occurs to me that I should have left with them. Asked for a ride. I think as I stab at what I assume is the last deer in these woods. I'd gotten pretty decent at hunting. But you can't hunt what doesn't exist.
It's August again and the roads still aren't open. I've already broken open half the homes. I should have enough food with this deer... assuming the thaw doesn't skip again.
What's killing me the most is the boredom.
I've lived up here for 9 years, not much happens. But you can't even watch the squirrels anymore. Especially since I already made soup outta them.
I look over at the radio again...
It's not like I need help. But hearing a voice might be alright.
It's battery operated, which is good since I've never needed much electricity to keep going. It's just a metal box. Got an old condensor microphone disc on it. It sputters a bit when I turn it on.
The first sounds I try to make are... almost inhuman. I'm not one to talk to myself, so it'd been a while since I'd said a word.
The machine crackles, like it's judging my lack of words.
"Hello?" I manage to scrape out from under my beard.
The black box seems to sit patiently. Waiting for me, or someone else to respond.
I consider saying it again, and decide against it, listening to the light hum. It... was nice to hear something besides the wind. It must have been about 15, 20 minutes later when I'm shaken from my reverie.
A crackle, the sound of rustling. "Hell... hello? Can... can you hear me? Who is this?"
It sounded like a woman's voice. Mousy. I could almost picture her.
"... just an old man. I'm" what was I doing here? Asking for help? Looking for rescue?
"I'm... checking in on the weather. Some of my neighbors took off after the frost. I've been fine here on my own. I am. But, they might be mad I took some of their canned goods. I figure I should do some repairs , pay them back. August is normally when the almanac is published. I was... " normally someone had cut me off or interrupted me by now... she was a good listener.
"I was wondering... if you knew if the frost was going to keep going. Let me know how long I have to fix things up for them."
Buzzing.
And.
Static.
She must have gone to get her copy. I sit and listen to the hum. It drones and fills the cabin. Beating out the silence, piercing it and overtaking the wind. Peaceful. Calm. Steady.
A good while later I hear a quick pop.
"I... I can't really tell. If... um... if you.. oh gosh. Um... I mean, if you could give me your coordinates. Maybe? I don't really know what almanac you're talking about."
Coordinates. Not knowing the almanac.
I'd lived in the city before, that was a city girl. Probably never touched dirt in her life. I chuckle a little at myself. The radio was going a long way out. Too bad I never really learned them.
"The Farmer's Almanac. Tells us what to expect for the weather. I ain't got good coordinates on my mind. This ain't the best little hut for that kind of stuff."
"My name's Marcy... I forgot... it's Marcy."
"My name is Harold."
...silence.
I figure she's... all done talking. That's okay. But it was nice to know.
Over the next few days, I talk to her some more. She's a thoughtful girl. Interested in astronomy. Though she always waits and considers her words... even if she stumbles over them. I figure she has a recording machine or something on her end. Makes it a voice mail. She seems smart enough for that.
Eventually, she lays out how I can cut down the box. Make it a little more portable.
"You'll need it eventually. I mean... just... it's going to get colder."
"I'm fine." I try to interrupt, but she keeps going like I never said a word.
"If I'm right about your location, a big storm's coming. You won't be able to get through on your own."
"Marcy I-"
"You need to reach the next town over. Please Harold... it'll... it'll be difficult, but... but... I don't want you to die."
Ah... that's just cheating. I admire that though. She might seem soft, but she never let's you interrupt her.
If I'd had a daughter...
