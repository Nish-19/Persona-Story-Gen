You're a deaf superhero. You're hated by most of the villain because you kept beating them during their monologue. One villain however, knows your deaf disability and learnt sign language just to monologue themself to you.


#### Story ####
People called Intricate and no-nonsense hero. She was not a fan of that label.
For the first part, she considered most of her life to be nonsense. In a rational world, she wouldn't be speeding around on a motorbike in spandex punching other spandex clad villains as they tried to take over the city. A no-nonsense person, she figured, would be filing their taxes in early March as opposed to fighting crime.
Second of all, she tried to have fun on the job. She was riding a motorcycle for goodness sake. Who could say that a motorcycle was the most practical form of transportation! If she weren't fun loving and self indulgent, she would be taking public transport around the city. That would be helping solve the falling ridership issue, and securing funding for public transit might be more critical to the city than punching any villain.
In, as far as Intricate understood, she was a fun-loving, nonsense filled hero, just as much as anyone else. Okay, maybe not as much as 'everyone else' but many of them were just plain unprofessional!
Aside from bristling against the no-nonsense label, Intricate had also found that it made her life, marginally harder. Villains seemed convinced that they were running out of time when she showed up. They objectively were,  but they were more frantic than they were when they fought other heroes.
She'd seen videos of the famous showdowns, everyone had. The villains talked, they japed, they showed off. Intricate? Intricate got none of that. It was straight to business when she showed up.
Back at the start, villains had tried talking through their fights, but, it'd literally fallen on deaf ears.
Maybe that was what made people think she was no-nonsense. She couldn't take fun, after battle, interviews because there were rarely interpreters around after a fight. Logically they ran away once the building-chunks started flying.
That no-nonsense label was also why Intricate was sitting on her bed, in her 'Miranda' clothes considering whether she was going to get dressed for the day of crime fighting. She read the news. She understood how brand deals worked.
She liked protecting people, loved it even, it filled her with purpose, but at the same time... reading that the city you protect doesn't like you is never a good way to start the morning.
But she'd gotten the call, people needed help. So she'd get ready as she always did. One glove at a time, and in the peace and quiet.
....
By the time Intricate reached the scene of the crime, chaos had already ensued, past tense. She was late. Now there were police scattered around the bank using their cruises as shields and keeping an eye on the main door. There was only one way in or out of the central bank. Whoever was in there would have to fight they way out.
Intricate pulled up to the scene and hopped off her motorcycle. The first thing she caught in the corner of her eyes was someone rolling theirs. She frowned. Allowed herself an extended blink, then moved on. Marching toward the door without knowing what was going on inside.
Perhaps that was part of her label as well, Intricate's armor was nigh-invincible, and means that she was able to simply walk at most threats. She started up the steps then turned and waved the police officers further back.
They didn't move.
Intricate tried again with, what she feared, was too much enthusiasm. She wanted them to get to safe distance, not to think she was telling them to shoo.
She was too far in her head, it was probably fine.
Intricate entered the bank, tossing the door open and marching into the foyer. In the dead centre of the room was a villain that she didn'tm recognize.
Most cities had a rogue's gallery of a sort. Sure, they got locked away, but there were only so many powers in a population and keeping them in jail was a pain in the ass. That all to say, it was a rare novelty to see an unknown on a crime scene.
The woman, villain, opened her mouth and clearly said something. She was only wearing half a mask so Intricate, in theory, had a chance to read her lips, but she'd never been good at that. A second later, the woman stopped and scanned Intricate.
She was never, so Intricate gave her the moment to do so.
Then another novelty.
"Intricate, it's a pleasure." the woman signed. Intricate stared for a moment. She knew the words enough to understand them, but was too distracted by what the hell was going on to process them. She only had the common response to this revelation.
"You sign?" Intricate ask.
"Obviously." the woman retorted. The signs were somewhat hard to read, a mix of rough gestures and the multicolored costume contrasted with her dark skin. Too much extra visual noise.
"I'm going to stop you." Intricate signed back. She took a deep breath, but instead of moving right into a fight, the woman kept signing.
"You're going to stop me? How adorable. Don't you know how long I've planned this heist for?"
"No?"
"Months. Months I've been waiting to come onto the scene and fight you. The woman who's been putting all the other villains to shame."
"What?"
"This heist? A minor distraction." The woman started pacing as she signed. "I'm not here for the money. I'm not here for the lock boxes, Intricate. I'm here to prove a point."
For the first time in front of a villain, Intricate asked a question out of curiosity. "What point?"
"That the old generation of heroes is sloppy. They're too reliant on the rules of the game. On getting their time to monologue. On showmanship. Pomp. Circumstance. Mercy." She let the last sign drag, waggling her dominant hand. "But you? You're different. You've punished them for their monologues and games. By beating you I'll show them the new way of doing things. A no-nonsense way of doing things."
Intricate considered the woman's words for a moment. Were villains usually this talkative? When she watched the old videos she saw that they were talking but she'd mostly skipped to the interesting parts, like combat and tactics. Then once she'd considered the woman's words, she bristled at them and signed back. "I'm fun."
The villain laughed. No signing back this time.
"I'm not boring." Intricate signed at her. This didn't get a laugh. Instead the woman watched her hands and then Intricate's eyes.
"No, they're way of doing this is boring Intricate," the villain struggled adding any emotion to the words. "You're no into their vapid costumes and grandstanding. You're better than them! You don't need to sit there and listen to a monologue and--" The villain, Intricate had never asked her name, stopped, she needed her hands for this.
But it was too late, Intricate was on top of her.
That villain was right, she didn't need to sit there and listen to a monologue, but she was wrong about Intricate.
She'd show her she was fun, hit by hit.
