# Operation: Save Bella
Day 37 of my new life in the Gilded Palace (or as the humans call it, „the premium rat habitat from PetsRUs“). I, Pip, have grown accustomed to the luxuries - the premium cedar bedding, the imported sunflower seeds, the spinning wheel of contemplation. But today, everything changed. Bella, my cage-mate and best friend, has vanished.
«They took her!» I overheard the Small Human say to the Tall Human. «To the dreaded Vet!»
I didn’t know what a Vet was, but it sounded suspiciously like ‚threat‘ and that was enough for me. Time for action.
«Your friend is fine,» yawned Chester, the orange menace (or ‚cat‘ as they call him), lounging on his throne of cushions. «They’re just getting her shots.»
«Shots?» I gasped. «They’re shooting at my Bella?»
Chester rolled his eyes and went back to sleep. Typical cat behavior, showing no concern for the obvious crisis at hand. I had to take matters into my own paws.
First challenge: escaping the Gilded Palace. After twenty minutes of strategic planning (and five minutes of realizing I could just push the door that was already unlatched), I made my brave descent down the Tower of Doom (bookshelf) using the Rope of Salvation (curtain).
«Step one of the mission accomplished,» I whispered to myself, trying to ignore how my knees were shaking. I’d never been this far from my cage alone.
The kitchen floor stretched before me like an endless desert. No cover. No protection. Just me and the terrifying open space. I could hear the Rumbling Beast (dishwasher) in the distance, and the Cave of Moving Waters (sink) was dripping its ominous melody.
«You can do this, Pip. For Bella!»
I made a dash across the floor, diving behind the Water Bowl of the Orange Menace. Chester, from his perch, slow-blinked at me.
«She’ll be back in an hour, you know.»
«That’s what they want you to think!» I declared, army-crawling behind the food bowl. «This is clearly a situation requiring heroic intervention!»
I had almost reached the Sacred Gateway (cat flap) when disaster struck. The Roaring Demon (vacuum cleaner) sprang to life in the next room. I froze, every fiber of my being screaming to retreat to the Gilded Palace.
But then I remembered Bella. Sweet Bella, who always saved me the best sunflower seeds. Who never laughed at my fear of the Wooden Thunder (humans walking). Who taught me how to properly groom my whiskers for maximum dramatization.
Taking a deep breath, I pressed on. The outside world beckoned through the Sacred Gateway - a world I’d only glimpsed through windows. A world full of dangers, adventures, and possibly angry pigeons (Bella had warned me about pigeons).
Just as I was about to make my brave leap through the Gateway, the front door opened. The Small Human entered, carrying a familiar white box.
«Look who’s back from getting her vaccines!» the Small Human announced.
The box opened, and there was Bella, looking slightly annoyed but otherwise perfectly fine.
«Pip!» she squeaked, seeing me frozen mid-heroic pose by the cat flap. «What are you doing down there?»
«I... uh... dropped a sunflower seed?»
Later, safely back in our cage, Bella explained about vaccines and veterinarians while I pretended I hadn’t been planning a dramatic rescue mission involving three paperclips, a rubber band, and a very reluctant alliance with the Orange Menace.
«You were really going to brave the outside for me?» she asked, touched.
«Of course not,» I lied, hiding my hastily scribbled rescue plans under the bedding. «I am a sophisticated apartment rat. We don’t do adventures.»
But we both knew the truth. I, Pip the Brave, had almost ventured into the great unknown. Almost. And somehow, that felt like victory enough.
Chester watched us from his cushion throne, a knowing smirk on his face. But I noticed he’d left some of his kibble by the water bowl - perfectly positioned for cover in future missions. Just in case.
After all, you never know when you might need to save someone from the dreaded Vet again.
