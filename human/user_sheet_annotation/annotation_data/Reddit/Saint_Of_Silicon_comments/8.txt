As a superhero trying to stop the end of the world, you weren't prepared for what losing would really mean


#### Story ####
We are the best. Not perfect, but the best the planet can muster. With our gifts and our genius, we seek to make the world a better place. Doing battles with villains and monsters, fighting the good fight. But there are truly terrible powers arrayed against us, creatures that would usher in the end. The end of what makes life good, the end of joy, wonder, and kindness.

There are people, though I sometimes wonder if they really qualify as people, that wish to invite horrors beyond our comprehension to our world. We do not understand their psychology. Perhaps they are insane, perhaps they think these creatures they seek will give them power and status. They cannot be allowed to achieve their goals, but these abominations from beyond the veil endow their servants with horrifying might. The ability to rip through body, mind, and soul.

I have lost friends to them, knowing that their final moments were filled with indescribable anguish. Everyone living can feel the pressure building. The dark plans are reaching maturation. There is something coming, and if we do not stop it, I shudder to think of what will unfold.

We find the site via satellites with special sensors that can feel the flows of the otherworldly energy. There is no time, we mobilize every resource we have. Every piece of hardware, everyone endowed with a super power, and numerous normal human soldiers. Failure means the end of days, and all of us know it.

The enemy possesses substantially more raw power, but tactical and strategic geniuses organize us. We enter the fray, the air charged with possibility. I narrowly avoid death, only to see the person behind me be cut down. Tens of thousands of us are gathered here, but over five hundred die in the first thirty seconds.

We are making gains, pushing the enemy back. They are protecting something, a device at the center of their formations. If we cannot destroy it in time, our defeat is guaranteed. The seconds pass, carnage and the screams of the dead and dying surround me. I punch a hole through a monster's head with a blast of light. I channel all that I can, praying that this be our finest hour.

We're almost there, I can hear the sound of the device, the shrieking of spacetime as it is ripped apart. Blasts of light, the charred hulks of things that were once people. I fire a lance of light at the thing they are guarding, but it does nothing. Something is protecting it. I am preparing another blast, when there is a pulse of all consuming darkness, a beating heart of darkness.

No. No no no no. We can't lose. Failure is not an option. But what I see can only mean failure. Full of adrenaline and fear, I heave up the meager contents of my stomach. There's got to be a way, some means of stopping what has been unleashed. Some way to save the day. Then we all hear it, a guttural voice like metal grinding on rock, "I am Moloch. Welcome to the new age of Eternal Night."

I continue to fight. Our enemies are full of exaltation, even as I cut them down. There's still hope, there's still a way to save everything. But then it looks at me, even as I try to punch a laser through it. It has no face, but somehow I know that it is smiling. My arms and legs go numb, and I fall to the ground. I try to regain control, but my flesh betrays me. I scream into the dirt, until Moloch turns my head up towards the sky. I watch as the sun is consumed by tendrils of darkness.

How to fight, how to win? Hope cannot be gone. It must not be gone. "I think I will make an example of you. You will have the honor of being the first, the first of *very* many."

Invisible forces raise me from the ground and into the air. I stare into what I realize is the embodiment of horror. There is physical pain, but somehow I know that is just the beginning. I am already screaming when its mind touches mine, but somehow the gurgling sounds I begin to make are even more disturbing.

I see into eternity. Creatures damned by time, the ravages of eternity on the sanity of even the most stable being. The slow, inexorable fall from grace that consumed what were once paragons of goodness. Pain, not the simple rending of flesh and snapping of bone, but something deeper. The anguish of an angel as its soul is plucked from its body and mutilated in ways that defy human notions of space, time, and physicality. Eons of horror. Our defeat here is simply the most recent in a long, sad history of evil obliterating good. Our defeat is the consequence of a war between light and darkness that the light has been losing for longer than our notions of time have even existed.

My joints supplex and pop, until with a shriek that will echo through time, my soul explodes. The person who I was quickly faded, like a shattered vase pulled apart at the atomic level. Oblivion rose to claim me, and even my fragments ceased to be.
