Aliens show up and want permission to build a Dyson sphere around our sun.


#### Story ####
Dreams of meeting others. Dreams of not being alone. The *wonder* of first contact. The *glory* of first contact. Well, first contact is here, and it is a... business proposition.

Their great ships were visible from the ground. The newcomers did all the leg work for translating their language into our languages. What wonders would they share? How would we be transformed? Then they spoke, "We are the Turo. We have an offer. We wish to purchase your star, and surround it with solar collectors. We are open to further discussion, and will consider many forms of material and technological compensation in return for energy harvesting rights."

The reaction was mixed. Some a visceral, "No!" some a heartfelt, "Yes!" Most people thought we should at least explore the possibility, and look into what we could receive in return for selling our star. A lower energy replacement could be created, so that life on our planet would not die without the sun. It would be much closer, reducing the luminosity required to sustain life with it. It would interfere with our day night cycle, but we could adapt. They had some truly miraculous seeming technologies, things so far beyond us. However, they were not willing to give us information for free, so we could not understand what we were buying.

It was decided that the decision of whether or not to sell should be made by the UN Security Council. Some countries wanted concessions from the aliens for them in particular, in return for voting to sell Sol. Some outspoken business leaders advised against any deal, we had no way of knowing the true value of our star, and the true value of whatever the Turo might be offering. "It's a terrible deal, the worst deal in the history of deals," said one prominent figure.

The Security Council continued to argue. A unanimous decision was needed, but everyone at the table wanted to receive an edge that would allow them to surpass the other powers, after the star was sold. Petty nationalism and power politics when faced with a decision that might determine our fate as a species.

For years, they bickered. But two decades later, they were on the verge of agreeing, each having been placated enough to think it would hold an edge in geopolitics after the deal went through. But, on the eve of officially announcing the decision, there was another development. "For any deal of this scale, you are entitled to arbitration by a representative of the galactic business agency," said a ship as it streaked into the solar system.

This newcomer revealed many interesting truths. The basic science and vast troves of information that they had offered in payment were, in actual fact, available for free to any civilization that asked. Enough to kickstart a golden age, and it was being given away. When the arbiter reviewed the private deals brokered between the Turo and the members of the Security Council, it broke into its version of laughter. "Your star has billions of years of life left, and you were going to sell rights for all that time and energy for *this*?"

Apparently, what had been offered to each state was of almost no long term value. Some military hardware that we would have been dependent on the Turo to actually maintain, and which they would have charged us more to do so. The Turo, of course, admitted no wrongdoing. They offered more deals, ones which were less bad, but which the arbiter still strongly advised against.

It went on like that for a year, but then came a flood of alien spacecraft into the system. Galactic society had heard we existed, and now they were here. Some to explore, some to learn, some to study, some to profit, and some to share. There were actually fair deals for asteroid mining rights and the right to build things like space stations. There was also a deluge of gifts. Miracles of science and technology that would have taken us millennia to discover on our own were explained free of charge.

We had almost sold our future, fallen prey to economically predatory organizations. But we were pulled back from the brink, and now we would enter an age of wonder. The joy that we had hoped for had now actually arrived.
