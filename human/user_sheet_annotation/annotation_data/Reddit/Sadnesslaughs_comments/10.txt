#### Writing Prompt ####
"I just think it's hilarious how you managed to convince yourself that you're somehow... allowed to be a person? Because you're not. You were born and raised to be a weapon, and that's all you are meant to be. You don't get to change, sweetheart. That's not how human weapons work."


#### Story ####
“You don’t get to decide to have a heart now, sweetheart. That isn’t how this program works. You were born and raised to be a weapon. There isn’t even a full brain in your thick skull anymore. All that’s left is a machine. You’re nothing but a gun. Now stop jamming and fire.” Lieutenant Gabby Ria ordered, pointing at the child across from her.
While she shrieked out her orders, Era froze, unable to pull the trigger. The lieutenant was right; they were only a weapon. Yet memories were flooding into its mind, drowning out that robotic side that often took centre stage. Memories of a specific human it couldn’t recognise, getting overwhelmed by their past.
Across from the pair, the girl, Jessica, remained curled behind a desk, gripping a stuffed bear. The paw of the bear once holding a tiny red balloon, one that had been torn off days ago. Even without the scraps she wore, she was a miserable sight. Tired eyes, constant shaking and a murmuring for help that only Era’s hyper-detailed hearing could pick up. “Please, leave me alone.” She begged.
Era could never point its gun at a superior officer, so instead, it turned its face towards her, neck twisting eighty degrees to find her. They designed Era models to be basic, stripping them of all their unique features and traits. Giving them the same blank blue eyes, light brown hair, and voice chips. This making it harder for a lieutenant or any officer to see them as anything other than a disposable machine.
“Why? Why can I think? I don’t like this? I don’t like thinking. Everything hurts, I’m scared. It’s dark in here. Gabby. You told me I wouldn’t hurt. Why am I hurting?” The tone remained robotic, with the blank face unable to express the sensations pulsing through its circuits.
Gabby retrieved her own pistol, gazing away from Era, turning her attention to the laboratory they stood in. They had bombed the place to hell. No, that didn’t even do it justice. They had bombed the place to purgatory, leaving nothing but scorched land, a few desks and the remnants of glass and tubes. If one passed through this place, they would assume it had been an underground dumping facility, not the proud anti Era factory they had boasted about while it was still active.
“You can’t feel pain, and you can’t think. There shouldn’t even be a part of you that can think. It’s blocked under our programing. Listen to me, Era.” Gabby began.
“I’M NOT ERA.” They snapped. “I’m Nick. We know each other. Don’t we?”
Gabby’s heart sank. This shouldn’t be possible. No other Era model had recovered their memories before. “They shouldn’t even have that name saved to your chip.” As she contemplated the information, she heard tiny footsteps near the table. Returning her gun to the girl, she fired a shot, trying to hit the monster before it could flee. When the gun fired, the girl ducked back behind the table. “Don’t move, monster. Is this your doing?”
Era looked at the weapon in their hands, tensing. “You said this program was for justice. Didn’t you? That we would save people? Why are we doing this, then? You said this program would save me. Am I actually saved?” You’ve made me into a monster.”
“They shouldn’t have assigned you to me, Nick. None of this makes any sense. I never lied about anything. On your deathbed, I told you that this was the only way you could keep fighting. You wanted to fight. I was against this.” Gabby kept her weapon pointed at the table, giving Era a side glance.
“I don’t want to do this. I’m scared. Why did they need part of my brain? Can’t they make robots?”
“Robots are unreliable. They can be hacked, and their energy drains far too quickly. Allowing them to use part of a human brain allows their processes to save space and energy on the field. You should already know this. We’ve had this conversation before, haven’t we?” Gabby stepped closer to the table, only to halt when she heard Era follow her.
“Don’t kill her.”
“Why not?”
“She’s only a kid.”
Gabby sighed. “You know. Part of me wanted to believe that was actually you, Nick. That I could say a proper goodbye to my old friend. It’s not. That creature’s just pulling at memories, trying to find something that might weaken me. A creature like this killed you. You should know she isn’t just a kid. its emotional manipulation, the same type you fell to. I’m guessing you knew that too, monster. Or did you overlook that memory when you were sweeping through our files?”
Jessica screeched, tossing the bear to the floor. She knew she was trapped, giving guttural growls as she tapped the table, shaking her only cover. Gabby remained still, not approaching the sound, nor firing a wasted shot. “Nick, if that is you in there, you’ll take the shot.”
Era did nothing, and so Gabby reached into Era’s hand, pulling the trigger on his weapon. When it fired, the monster popped out from its cover, assuming Gabby had fired her own gun. Thinking it had a chance to run, it lunged out of cover, only to get shot down by Gabby. The ‘girls’ synthetic skin falling away as it powered down, revealing the metallic body underneath.
“Fucking manipulative pricks. I can’t believe they keep making these things. To think, a monster like that can find out so much about a person without needing to get into their heads. Not only that, their able to mess with the Era models programming. So much for the anti-hacking argument my superiors gave me. Why do we even need a human brain in them anymore, if those creatures can get around it?” Gabby pushed her fingers against her eyes, wiping the tears away. “Fucking hell, Nick. You’re still haunting me.”
“You’re a Lieutenant now Gabby?” A voice asked, causing Gabby to stiffen. “Weren’t you meant to wait for me?”
“You died. I couldn’t wait. Nick, I’m sorry. I hesitated, and it killed you because of it. Nick, I’m…” She turned, finding a blank Era model staring at her.
“There is no Nick in my records? Has a person been added to the mission statement? If so, please give me their full name or number and rank, so I may add them to my objective.”
“Era, override programming protocol, no identification. Now tell me, who are you?” Gabby said, praying it wasn’t who she thought it was.
“Heather Phillips donated this brain. Id 2003213. Would you like any further information on Heather Phillips?” Era asked.
“No.” Gabby walked over and stomped the dead monster, making sure there was no way that its programming could keep running. “To think our enemies have resorted to this. Era, enter low-power mode, only run basic functions and cut off your link to main server. Sweep the area and capture anything humanoid you find. If you can’t capture it, kill it.”
With Gabby’s orders, the machine walked around the ruined laboratory, searching for more of those creatures. Gabby hoping that they wouldn’t be able to hack Era in its low powered mode. Without access to the main server, it shouldn’t be able to give away any of her secrets either. Gabby assuming that was how it found out about her connection to Nick, through whatever files they had saved about her and her previous missions.
While Era searched the area, Gabby called their base. “Our enemies are getting stronger. It was able to find out about my connection to Nick. We need to bump up our security or they’ll soon learn how to turn the Era’s guns against us. I’ll tell you more when I get back. Just send a pickup. I’ve got a body here too. I’m sure you would like a chance to see what machinery they're putting inside their weapons.” She said, ending her transmission.
