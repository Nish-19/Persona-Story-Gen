“It is one man, by himself, in a castle on a hill. How does an ENTIRE ARMY fail to take it???”


#### Story ####
“Complications arose during the march, sir. While it is merely a castle on the hill. One that is barely a breadcrumb compared to your grand castle and balcony. It is still a steep hill to climb.” Marcus said, kneeling with his clenched fist pushed against his chest plate. The flame emblem of the Revilion Empire resting beneath his fist, as if he was trying to extinguish it with his hand.
King Salas peered at the castle, having to squint to make out its inferior walls and grace. Unlike his castle that loomed over the city like a stone dragon, the castle of Lord Grethon sat high above it like a Gray Catbird, curiously watching the dragon from a safe perching branch. Though, that safe hill now had soldiers ascending it, like hungry cats climbing up to snatch the prey that remained up above.
“Complications? Explain.” Salas didn’t turn to face his commanding knight, too busy staring at the eyesore that silently mocked him. The king’s wrinkly hand running through his gray beard, trying to untangle some hairs that had intertwined.
Marcus didn’t stand. Even if the king refused to look his way, he didn’t move. Not wanting to risk facing the man’s wrath. “The horses got spooked. The height caused a few of them to panic, sending the others into a frenzy. We also had issues trying to find the perfect point to ascend from. We feared the pathways Lord-“
“He is no lord anymore.” The king interjected, his hoarse voice having a not-so-subtle hint of frustration as he listened to his knight.
“Ah, how right you are, my grace. We feared the pathways that traitor Grethon created would be occupied by his treacherous knights that used to serve under your command. To avoid a disadvantage in battle, we explored alternative routes.”
The king turned, acknowledging his knight for the first time since he had knelt. The kings worn white robes now having splotches of dirt and grime, not the former pure white they once were. “If I don’t hear any good news, Marcus. Then I’ll be forced to suspect you of sabotaging the mission. These are mistakes a new commander would make, not a seasoned one. Where is my good news, Marcus?” The king didn’t need to threaten Marcus directly, making it obvious what would happen if he didn’t hear something positive soon.
Marcus tensed, staring at the king’s feet. “Grethon is alone. He has not fled the castle and the soldiers in his command have thrown down their arms and agreed to rejoin our army. We have him surrounded. His death will come shortly.”
Salas smirked, those dry lips at risk of chipping as he performed the action for the first time in years. “Very well. We shall have his head soon, then?” Salas asked, turning back to his window.
“A day or two, depending on how long it takes our men to return. Should I execute him before our men bring him into the city? Have his dead body paraded through the streets on his return?” Marcus offered, knowing the king would never accept the proposition. Not when the sweet allure of a more personal revenge was available.
Salas entertained the thought of making a spectacle out of this, only to shake his head. “His death will come at my hand. The other lords need to know what happens when you steal from the king. The people pay to live on my land. How dare he try to undermine my rule?”
Marcus closed his eyes, giving a nod of approval. “The other lords will fall in line, sir. They know better than to question your might. May I leave my king? Preparations are needed for Grethon’s arrival.”
“Yes, go ahead. Leave and don’t return until you have Grethon with you. I want you to help me with the arrangements before his execution. We won’t make it quick for him.” Salas chuckled, the dry laugh coming out as if he were spitting out clumps of dust.
Marcus took his leave, wondering when the king had become like this. Had Salas always been this wicked, and he never noticed because of his loyalty? Or had the king’s heart changed after the death of the queen? He hoped it was the first, not wanting to feel any sympathy for the man they planned to kill.
Everyone knew Grethon had committed no actual crime. He had paid the king his gold in full. But he had done so with money from his own pockets. The struggles of the last winter had been harsh on the farming lands below Grethon’s hill, and since the people he looked over couldn’t afford to pay the taxes, Grethon covered the expenses. Telling them to pay what they could during this harsh period and he would make up the rest.
A selfless act that the king took offense to. The king saw this as teaching bad manners, similar to a parent covering for a child’s mistakes, forcing bad habits. What would happen if other commoners started expecting the same from their lords? It would be chaos. When Marcus first came to Salas and told him the commoners in his city were asking for lower taxes during this troubling time, he knew he had to make an example out of Grethon.
Though, what he didn’t expect was the other lords to conspire against him. The king was old, weak, and showing signs of taking the kingdom to the grave with him. Today it would be Grethon and the next it would be them. Which is why they planned to kill the king, using the distraction of Grethon to mount their attack.
That was why Grethon’s men surrendered so quickly. That day wasted with supposed spooked horses was a day filled with scheming and negotiations. When they formulated their plan, Grethons’ men joined the army and left their lord alone, allowing him to be taken.
Now, the king waits for his revenge, not knowing in reality, he was waiting for his death. The small dots that occupied the hill weren’t his men anymore. They were a collective of disgruntled knights that understood the future of the kingdom. Those who were still loyal to the king either taken as prisoner until the king had been dealt with or removed of entirely.
Two more days, the king had to rule his kingdom.
Two more days until Grethon arrived.
