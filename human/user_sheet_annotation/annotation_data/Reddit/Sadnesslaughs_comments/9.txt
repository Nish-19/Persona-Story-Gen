"MIMICS CAN TALK!?" "Of course we can, you idiot, we're not mindless monsters." "Then why do you guys always attack adventurers?" "You'd attack a stranger too if they opened your mouth and stuck their hands in it unwarranted."


#### Story ####
Ok, so can you let go of my hand now? Jeremy asked, feeling the mimics stiff tongue flicking against his elbow, touching it in ways that no elbow should ever be touched. When the mimic finally spat out his hand, Jeremy fell back, grimacing at the sight of the bright blue saliva that was dribbling down his arm, staining the stone dungeon floor below.

 

There. Next time will you think before you shove your hand into someones mouth? The treasure chests lid flapped, acting like it was possessed by demonic magic. The golden chest was a sight that promised legendary treasures, having a wooden exterior with gold metal plating that lined its edges and front. Even knowing it was a mimic, Jeremy struggled to resist diving into it again, all his instincts as an adventurer telling him it had rare loot.

 

Jeremy dragged his hand against the side of his pants, trying to clean off as much mimic saliva as he could, before inspecting the chest. Small pin sized eyes near the keyhole of the chest, the way it twitched as if it were drawing breath. Without his treasure hungry trance, it was obvious this wasnt a real chest. Though, most adventurers never took the time to check out a chest, too busy searching for loot to bother with such a thing.

 

Im sorry, but youre a mimic, right? If you dont want someone touching you, why dont you transform into a chair or something? That seems easier. Jeremy suggested, feeling this wasnt entirely his fault. A treasure chest in a dungeon wasnt the sort of thing that screamed, dont touch me.

 

Im not some freak that wants people sitting on them! I would rather have a hundred hands shoved into my mouth than an orc trying to use me as a stool. The chest huffed, and when they said it like that, Jeremy had to agree with them.

 

Jeremy tapped at his chin, thinking about other items the mimic could control. Not wanting to waste too much time going over the options, he quickly fired a few off.

 

A lamp.

 

Too many people will try to blow me out.

 

A statue?

 

Too many people will start climbing all over me.

 

A human?

 

Ew.

 

What do you mean, ew? Jeremy said, offended by the monsters ew. He wasnt the one that just slobbered over someones arm. Fine, stay a treasure chest. I hope someone tries to lock pick you. Jeremy collected his bag from the dungeon floor and threw it over his shoulder. Well, if youve got no treasure to offer me, then Ill be on my way.

Wait. Do you really think the human disguise could work? It asked, considering the idea. The mimics body dissolved into a pile of goo, pooling by the adventurers feet before suddenly bursting up from the floor, bouncing to a human sized figure, one that slowly gained its features before him.

 

The mimics new form now towering over Jeremy, staring down at him with its expressionless face. They were as strange as a person could be. Eyes devoid of any color, skin having an eerie blue tint and long silver hair that fell to the shoulders of the robe they were wearing .

 

Jeremy didnt know what to think of the form. It looked human-ish? Like a body that belonged to a mage or some other mana filled person. However, it didnt look normal, not the type of body you wouldnt notice if you passed it on the street. Its a little unique. Jeremy said, trying to be nice.

 

You hate it.

 

I dont hate it. I just wouldnt trust that man if I passed them on the street. I would expect them to curse me or something. You need to think of something simpler. Close your eyes and imagine the most generic adventurer you can think of.

 

The mimic transformed into Jeremy, opening its eyes. Hows this then? It asked, swirling on the spot, giving Jeremy a look at his own body, something that was more unsettling than he expected it to be.

 

Im not generic! Im unique for a human. Look at my scar. Jeremy said, lifting his shirt, showing off the small scar he had gotten from poking himself with a knife while drunkenly preparing a meal. See, a scar means Im unique.

 

The mimic leaned in closer, as if he were about to give Jeremys stomach raspberries. Ah, so you do. Ill correct that. The mimic retreated and raised its shirt, showing off the same scar. There, now I should be able to walk around without being bothered.

  
You cant be me. Im me. Jeremy sighed, scratching his head. Look, just go back to being a chest, ok? Thats the safest option. Ill even put up a sign that says mimics are living creatures. Although, most adventurers cant read. He admitted. When the mimic changed back into a chest, Jeremy went to the doorway of the treasure room, getting out a piece of cloth from his bag. It would be a crude sign, but a sign nonetheless.

 

As he went to hang the cloth up, the weak entrance of the treasure room crumbled. The collapsing stones, threatening to come down on Jeremys head. With a quick pivot, Jeremy got himself out of the way, helplessly watching as the treasure room entrance sealed, leaving the mimic inside. Crap, Im sorry. I didnt realize how weak it was. Ill dig you out.

 

NO. This is perfect. No more adventurers, no more monsters, just a quiet room. The mimic sighed, able to relax now that they wouldnt have to deal with any threats. It wasnt like they needed to eat that much, either. Able to survive on the moss and moisture that appeared in the room. Thank you, adventurer. For this gift.

 

Oh, youre welcome. I guess?

 

If you want some treasure, check behind the statue near the entrance. I heard a thief mention they keep a stash there.

 

Will do. As he left the dungeon, he found the stash the mimic had been referring to. An assortment of beautiful gems all bunched tightly together in a leather sack. Taking the sack, he headed for his village, considering that a successful trip.
