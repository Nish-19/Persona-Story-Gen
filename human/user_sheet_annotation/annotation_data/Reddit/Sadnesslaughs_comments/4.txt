#### Story ####
“Utterly beautiful.” A soft voice whispered, watching Dan spill more useless clutter onto his kitchen counter. Dan always subscribed to the philosophy of ‘I’ll clean it up when the mess gets unbearable.’ Underestimating how much of a mess he could tolerate.
The counter was no longer visible under the clumps of old newspapers, empty cereal boxes and an unholy amount of milk cartons. Still, Dan didn’t hesitate to add another newspaper to the pile, even as it rolled off the mountain of waste, dropping onto the floor. When he reached down to grab it, he found himself staring at a set of black toenails, not even noticing the grey woman who had been shadowing him since he entered the room.
Instinctively, he wanted to scream, but the sound got stuck in his throat, causing more of a gagged breath. He remained in his bent position, as if doing so would somehow make the looming presence go away. When it didn’t leave, he moved his head, only for the presence to drop to his level, meeting his gaze.
Crouched before him was a sickly looking woman. One with pale skin, black wavy hair, and a permanent set of purple tear stains running down her angelic cheeks. Despite her grim appearance, her black lips were curled into a smile, collecting the newspaper and offering it to him. “You dropped this.”
Now that scream found its way from his throat, coming out in a cat-like shriek as he snatched the newspaper and rushed back, diving behind his couch for protection. The god, while hurt, understood his shock, cupping her hands in front of her mismatched purple and brown dress, allowing him to freak out.
“How did you get in? I’m calling the cops.” Dan sputtered, though when he stood up, he didn’t reach for his phone, confused by her almost divine appearance. She hadn’t moved since he started freaking out, that being enough to give him second thoughts. “Is this a prank? Oh, if you don’t clean up, a ghost will come and haunt you. Did my sister put you up to this? That noisy brat.”
“No one put me up to this. I came to observe my shrine. It’s beautiful.”
“Shrine? It’s a pile of trash.”
“It’s a pile of discarded items.” She placed her hands on the counter, trying to find a clean spot. After carefully shifting a milk carton, she found somewhere to rest her hands. “I’m Obosa, the goddess of the lost or discarded.”
Dan laughed, unable to believe his sister would go this far to prove a point. “You can cut the crap. A goddess? I get it, my house is a mess. I’ll clean it up, just tell my sister she proved her point. God, she’s just like her mother.”
“Her mother?” The goddess said, even if she knew about the human’s grief, she didn’t want to pry, not unless he mentioned it.
“Well, my mother too. Look, you wouldn’t get it.”
“I’m the goddess of lost and discarded items. Not to sound rude, but I believe I would understand the pain of loss.” She had hoped that didn’t across as rude as it sounded in her head, unable to hide her own frustrations. She had a lot of patience, but having her godly specialty questioned wore down even her patience.
Dan again laughed, this time more condescendingly. He moved over to his shrine and gave it a shove, disrupting the perfectly stacked row of cereal boxes. “Oops, ruined the shrine. Now you can leave.” When Obosa merely gave him a pitying look, he exhaled. “What would a god even know about loss? You can’t lose anything, your gods.”
“That’s not true.” Obosa said, clenching the counter. “I’m sorry for prying. I only wanted to help you. It’s rare I get to actually help people.”
“Isn’t there a bunch of lost people? Surely you can help one of them.” Dan hissed, getting frustrated with himself for even entertaining the idea of this woman being a goddess. “Go help someone else.”
“I can’t!” She shouted, raising her voice in an act that shocked even her. Quickly, she lowered her voice as she continued. “I can only help those who know they're lost. Even in those cases, it’s hard for me to appear without a strong link or shrine. This shrine here allowed me to visit you.”
Dan shook his head, grabbing another milk carton from the fridge. “Alright, cool. Still doesn’t explain how you can understand loss. What? Did you lose your divine horse or something as a kid in an epic tale?” He mocked, sipping from his milk.
Obosa ignored that comment, even if it stung. “No. I lost my sisters. Gods can’t die, they can only stop existing. We had too many gods, so Athila, the goddess of knowledge, suggested only keeping one descendent from each of the gods. The one who had the most power or influence. My father is a minor god, and as such, our gifts weren’t great. Still, he picked me to be his only remaining child, believing the experience would strengthen my powers of loss. I lost all my family that day, as I’ll never forgive my father for choosing me.” She explained, wiping the tears from her eyes.
Dan didn’t know what to say. If this was an actor hired by his sister, they were destined for greater things than standing in his kitchen. Even if he knew how stupid it sounded, he couldn’t help but believe her. “I’m sorry.”
“As am I. Because I believe my grief created the pain that humanity feels when losing someone. My thousand years of grieving, subjected you all to the pain of loss. Without me, you wouldn’t feel pain when those you lost passed.”
“Isn’t pain healthy?”
“Is this healthy?” She asked, gesturing to his kitchen. Before Dan could get defensive, she spoke. “You’re hurting, aren’t you?”
Dan sat the carton down, rubbing his forehead. “I’m fine. Really. It was a year ago. You need to keep pushing forward. Don’t you?”
“You can’t fool me with those words. I’m not going to leave once I hear the lies you tell everyone else. I want the truth. How do you feel? Who did you lose?”
Dan choked up, having to take a moment to compose himself. “My mother. Look, I’m alright. I’ll clean up this mess and everything will be ok.” Like a robot, Dan began pushing aside the waste, trying to find something to throw it into, only to get stopped by Obosa, who held his shoulder.
“You’re not alright. You’re hurting. I know you know that. It’s ok, you can let it out.” She widened her stance, offering him a hug, only for Dan to busy himself with the mess.
“I don’t need to let it out. I’ve cried enough. I need to move past it. That’s what she would want.”
“You need to grieve. Properly. You’re hurting yourself by doing this. How do you feel?”
“FINE. I FEEL FINE. WHAT? CAN’T YOU UNDERSTAND ENGLISH?” Dan shouted, tossing a cereal box onto the floor. “HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL? EMPTY. I JUST WANT HER BACK.” Dan’s face growing hot as the salty tears pooled in his eyes. “How can everyone else move on so easily…”
She pulled Dan towards her; the man letting out an ugly cry as he sobbed into the goddess. She rubbed his back, holding him as he let out his grief. “Losing family is the worst pain imaginable. A severed connection that can never be replaced. A loss of shared blood. You will join with her once again, when it is your time.”
Dan couldn’t remember how long he spent crying, only that the sun was down by the time he pulled himself away from the goddess. “Thank you.” He said, wiping his eyes.
Obosa found a tissue box beneath the pile of items and plucked a tissue from it to give him. “Here. Dry your tears.”
“Thank you. I know I’ve been an ass. My sister was right about everything. I just couldn’t stand it. Seeing her happy, it felt wrong. Like she shouldn’t be moving on with her life. I knew I was wrong.”
“Now you can move forward.” Obosa smiled, waving her hand as the discarded items floated towards her, getting crushed into a small golden ball. “May I keep this as a memory? I want to remember helping you. I may not get more chances to help mortals.” She said, feeling the emotional energy radiating from the ball. The feelings of loss, anger and despair all pulsing within.
“Of course.”
“Thank you. You should also apologize to your sister. I would give anything to have mine back, so please, don’t lose yours.” She said, a sad smiled sitting on her lips as she went to teleport herself back to her realm.
“Wait.” Dan grabbed the edge of her dress, stopping her. “If you ever need someone to talk to. About your grief. Will you come to me? I want to repay you for helping me.”
The goddess paused, her smile becoming more genuine. She took his hand, clasping it within her own. “I promise I’ll come to you.” As a blue light surrounded her, she thought more on the humans offer, and her own feelings of loss. “I think I’ll take you up on that offer someday.” She said, vanishing before his eyes.
