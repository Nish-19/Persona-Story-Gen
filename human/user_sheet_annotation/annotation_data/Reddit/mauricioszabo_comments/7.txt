#### Writing Prompt ####
In the far, far future, your family stayed close to the tradition of farming, brass, and gunpowder, in a world of super alloys and laser weapons. You've stayed away from the news, so you didn't know anything of the new Empire, or what was coming to your door with not so friendly intentions....


#### Story ####
Then I just fired. And the soldier was down.
A bomb went out in the farm. Fragments of armor, flesh, and weapons flew through the air, painting the sky red, putrid smell assaulting the soldiers, that turned out to run, panicking.
My father just shot three more, not fatally. The wounded cries and pleas for mercy were more than sufficient to make others surrender on the spot, turn out their weapons, or simply run away, crying like little boys they were.
We found out by interrogating the prisoners: the war. The experiments. The new soldiers, the new order, the new chaos, the new government, and how everybody lost everything. They told stories about mercenaries, and immortals, and super-intelligent computers that could predict anything.
And how we, being so "outside of society", were a risk for the computer. They couldn't understand our ways, predict our actions.
They could not control us. Because we were not part of the pack.
Wars were now quick - the ones with better weapons would win in an instant, vaporizing everybody in seconds. The weapons took a long time to charge, but they were quick and effective, and could shot three times, although usually one was enough.
Every nano-element was fine-tuned to resist these new super-weapons, so they had basically no protection against good ol' gunpowder. We didn't know that, of course; we also didn't know that this whole "vaporizing enemies" was actually literal - people disappearing on the spot where in less than a second.
That's why they were scarred and flew from us - our weapons were "cruel", and we forced them to see what we really are - and what *they* really are - just humans.
Or maybe not.
The more they talked, the more we felt we were the last "real humans" on the planet. They talked crazy stuff about no free-will or privacy or desires - the "Corporation", how they called their new Empire, decided on what people would desire, want, and buy. Fine-tuned propaganda, subliminal messages fine-tuned for specific people and population to keep the status quo.
It didn't help that most humans were genetic-engineered now to have immunity to most diseases, and that food was grown in such a way to keep the perfect balanced diet and still taste like chocolate. Sure, there were some undocumented side-effects, like being more susceptible to the messages and to obey orders... but who would care? Humanity was better than ever, and for sure they just had to won *this last war* and then everything would be fine...
An ex-soldier begged us to take him with us. To escape that horrible world, to a simpler time, where humans were humans and wars were unheard of. We left the others tied to our house, and left with the begging one.
Packed lightly, but with our close guns ready, we walked. Through the valley, to the river. We ate, and we talked, and we explained things.
Always aware. Always looking for something we knew was going to appear.
And appear, it did. Unfortunately for the beggar, I saw that.
He was as dead as he was smiling, a moment earlier. Dad knew it was a trap. Of course, I knew it too - but that would distract the others.
For this was not our route. Our was a secret one, away from prying eyes. One that only we knew, deep down in the forest, for those who still knew which animals to greet, and which to avoid.
One full of traps that only the trained eye could see. Our trained eyes.
So we marched, without resting, to a new tomorrow, hearing the cries of whatever humanity became dying around us, victim of us, victim of themselves, succumbed to fear.
We still marched, for another centuries of exile. We marched, to hide, so that one day, humanity could flourish again - from tradition, farming, brass, and gunpowder.
