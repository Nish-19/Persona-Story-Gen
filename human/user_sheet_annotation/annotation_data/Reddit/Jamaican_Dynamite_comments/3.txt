#### Story ####
"I just... Don't understand where to start."
The dwarf shifted in his chair awkwardly at this. Dip, as his mortal friends called him, rubbed his stubble absently.
"It's really not that bad." He presented. "Actually, it's even better than where we came from."
Voss summoned a pear and took a sharp bite out of it. "How so?"
"Well, you could." He hesitated. "Find new work." She took another bite, glared at him further then, yet another.
"You doubt the work of the Fae. And you suggest we are weaker than we appear. What does a man of rock and stone know of what we do?"
"Not much?" Dip propped a foot on the table's edge and leaned his chair up on two legs. "Well, other than trickery, wanton slaughter, and otherwise making the lives of non magick users a living hell." He added. 
Voss frowned at this answer. "Even most of them know better. They even named a whole genre of children's stories around being careful around people like you. You know, Fairy tales?"
"That's enough out of you!" She slammed the table. A peculiar thing happened. She didn't expect the others to react the way they did.
All of those present treated her like a threat.
She had always left the elves to their work. The gorgons and weres to their land. The humans to their own hubris. But the whole room still turned on her at the drop of a hat. Even she knew when it was a bad play. 
She might get some of them. But the ones that she didn't would more than likely get her.
"You work together here? Why?"
Dip sat his chair back up and sat back down to prop himself up with a leg again. "Isn't it obvious? It pays to be kind." 
"Quite well, I might add." The elf that ran the clinic added.
"You amassed an army yet again, Grey."
"The more I think on it." He shrugged. "I guess I did."
She simply fluttered closer. "Was it all because of me?"
The elf snapped his fingers in recollection. "Because of people like you. Yes."
He brushed his hand by her face and a gust blew her backwards into her chair. "You can do the whole supreme dictator thing here again if you like."
Grey took over Dip's place in his chair.
"People here try it all the same. But at the end of the day. Eventually, you have to live your life. How long do you think it'll last with everybody plotting against you? You can't be on top forever."
He pointed at the few humans sitting nearby. "They've reminded me of that. And you can fight, you can run, you can try to hide. But believe me, they're much better at hunting here than they ever were back home."
Voss considered her words wisely. "Just because our worlds have merged, does not mean such things are true."
"You'll just have to see for yourself."
"For what it's worth, she could be a lawyer." One of the humans added.
"Ooh, or a talk show host." Another added.
"Nah, that's fucked up. She'd try to kill up the whole tri-state area." Her latest crush noted.
"Shay's right, that's too OP." "A magician? I got a ex that works down at the amusement park over by the water."
"Ah, no, that. JohnBoy, that actually sounds worse. Because when you think about it, people would give her their names."
"And then she kills up the tri-state area- What I said." Shay counted.
Voss wrapped her arms around his neck. "Mmmh, I knew I could count on you."
He started shaking in his seat like a misbehaving child.  "I told you before I'm married. Get off me!"
"Only if you give me your name."
"No." He shook. "Yo, help me."
"You got a Fatal Attraction."
