“Let me get this straight. I, a Fae, have spent LITERAL CENTURIES studying the subtle arts of deception, glamour, deceit, and misdirection, and you, a mere human, can just stand there and say things that are untrue?!”
“Yeah, that’s about right.”
Voss paused as he went back to reading the small glass case he kept in his pocket. Words and images scrolling by blindly as he went. She reached at the thing to smash it and regain her control.
But Shay simply pulled his hands out of reach and kept reading. A slight turn to put her at angle to his hip and not straight on.
"Surely you jest." Voss said as she hovered over now. Her wings vibrating the air similar to a hummingbird.
"Nope. Lying is easy." Shay flatly reacted. "It's the truest truth that's ever been told about people that's true. We lie all the time."
He realized the woman was hovered several inches from his temple and absently swatted as her so she'd make some room. She landed and stomped her foot a little at the gesture, the wings giving off an iridescent shine as they readjusted.
"But why?" She asked next.
Shay stopped texting and glanced up. "Because fuck you, that's why."
"That's not an answer!"
"Yes it is. That's my point."
The woman angrily glared at him. Then at the gorgon seated nearby. "You. Lizard. Surely you know a good reason for his insolence."
Amal pushed her sunglasses back on the bridge of her nose. "Shay? He's always like this."
There it was. A name. A sharp grin crossed Voss' face. She would make this puny man's life a living hell.
"My dearest Shay is it not? I gift thee with-"
"-That is not my real name. That's my nickname."
"Your *what?*"
"Yeah?" He looked up again, first at Amal, then at her.
"A nickname?"
"They don't have pet names in Middle Earth?" Shay asked her. "You don't shorten anything, or give people  names after random shit in life?"
"No."
"Sounds complicated."
"She lied to me." Voss pointed. Amal's hair wrap moved, and hissing could be heard.
"No, that's what I've always known him as. That's what everybody calls him."
"You lie about your own name?" Voss turned to Shay now.
Shay finally put the phone away. "Duh! Like I'mma sit here and let someone put a curse on me like it's just something to do. I got more sense than that."
Voss quickly hovered around to be in front of him again. Wriggling her fingers in his face like she was scolding a dog.
"You are scared of my power."
"I'm scared of violating my probation."
"You're still doing that?" Amal interrupted.
"Like two and a half years." He noted.
Amal took a sip of her thermos. "The kingdoms don't mess around these days."
"Hello?" Voss redirected, knocking on his forehead with a fist. "Are you in there?"
Shay swatted her away again. "Yes."
"Lie to me." Voss leaned back in. "Lie to me. Let's hear it."
Shay looked around the room. Then at Amal. She simply shrugged and continued drinking coffee. He glanced at the fae as she continued staring at him, and quietly considering the quickest way to perhaps remove his heart. And so, he took a deep breath, palmed his forehead and began.
"The moon is made of cheese. Magic isn't real. Gravity is a myth. You can use aluminium foil in the microwave. Water is inherently poisonous. Fentanyl is a great part of a balanced breakfast. This place is Venezuela on steroids. I'm white."
Amal choked for a second nearby.
"Radiation is great for your skin. Dogs can't look up. The Moon landing was fake."
"...Didn't you just say the moon was cheese?"
"We landed on that muthafucka' though... The Brooklyn Bridge is for sale. Milk and Orange Juice go great together. I cannot believe it's not butter. Birds aren't real. This handgun is fake."
"You're on probation." The gorgon spoke.
He wrapped his hands around her shoulders and gently shook her. "Is this working yet? Have I gotten through to you?"
"It's not fair." Voss stammered.
"Fair only works in weather and maidens, and there aren't enough maidens to go around."
Amal slapped the table at this one. "Oh my God."
Voss finally shrank down after he let go. She seemed satisfied, yet disappointed. Shay was still staring her in the face as if she'd ruined his entire day. Which, knowing Shay, she actually might have.
"Is that enough? Are you happy?"
She threw her arms over his shoulders. "...Marry me?"
"Huh?"
She fluttered her wings and hiked herself up to wrap him with her legs. Amal stood up in case she needed to free him from her grasp.
"Uhhhh, time for some truth." Shay reacted. He held up one of hands to show a ring "I'm taken."
"...Wow that's kinky." Amal frowned.
