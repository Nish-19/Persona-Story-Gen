#### Story ####
"MIMICS CAN TALK!?"
Rakiya looked at Tamari. She simply shrugged at the question. Per their reunion with Verana, its dearest friend. It did make a bit of sense how shocking this could be to people who didn't know better.
Although, now that the secret was out, it was getting a bit old.
"Of course we can, you idiot," Raki shifted. "We're not mindless monsters."
Tamari herself raised a hand to ask. "Then why do you guys always attack adventurers?"
The knight seemed to mimic a sigh of disappointment. The black and red steel suddenly disappeared into Raki's body as the figure molded into a giant mass of goop and teeth.
Tamari and their friend took a step back. Equal parts shocked and disturbed as Raki turned from a large knight in dark armor into a simple chest. Which opened to reveal it was full of gold.
The shopkeeper almost reached out to touch it. To lift a coin. Before Tamari grabbed his hand.
"Giosi, are you crazy??" She asked.
The chest quickly grew razor sharp teeth, and a tongue that flailed wildly.
"You'd attack a stranger too if they opened your mouth and stuck their hands in it unwarranted." Raki snarled angrily.
Giosi stared at the large maw. "That makes sense."
"Do you at least tell them?" Tamari said as she walked around the case.
"Why?" Raki proposed.
They returned back to their form of a knight larger than she was. "I have to eat."
"Ambushing people for food." Giosi muttered.
"And anything else willing to investigate." Raki admitted. They walked towards the table the keeper stood at.
"Unless. I choose to ambush them. *Myself.*"
The last word really insisted upon itself. If this mimic could walk and talk, and armor itself against attackers. What could he, a lowly shop owner do? Giosi wondered how many times he cheated death in his younger years. And how close it was without his knowing.
One of these things could smile in his face. And he might not know until it took a bite.
"What brought you here?" Giosi quietly asked.
The armor clinked realistically. "You have some herbs and potions. We're collecting them for her mother."
Tamari simply ran a hand through her hair and nodded at him.
"...27 silver." He winced.
To his confusion, the mimic placed a hand on the table. And the coins appeared from nowhere.
"Thank you Giosi." Rakiya complimented. "Good evening."
As they walked, Tamari finally spotted their tail. Namely Ren's tail as she dropped from the roof of the store into a tree. She landed on Rakiya's shoulders in a lazy hug before dropping to her feet. Not that the mimic had a reaction to the hit.
"You could at least warn him." Tamari advised.
"Meh." Ren yawned. "Raki loves it. I was falling asleep up there. The sun's so warm here. It's comfy."
Raki sat the bag down and stopped to look at them both.
"What?" Tamari asked. "...What's wrong?"
Raki leaned in a little. She quietly looked up at the helmet.
"I wonder if I can-"
The knight turned to that fanged mass again, before shaping itself to look like the woman in front of him. Now she had a twin. It had her figure. Her height. Her facial structure.
But it was all black. A brackish color that made her sweat in anticipation. That snarling building again. A sound she could feel. And then, Raki returned to the suit of armor.
"Hmm..." They spoke. "Not yet. I still haven't gotten it right."
They picked up the bag and began walking again. Tamari softly sheathing the sword she kept. She was unnerved by the breath in an ear.
"Pretty good right? Raki must really like you." Ren whispered as she clawed at some fruit she brought along.
"If you say so." Tamari lowly spoke.

Raki returns again. For groceries.
