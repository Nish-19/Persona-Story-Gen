#### Story ####
Sisst, gave a long suffering sigh as he woke up in a jail cell of the small village he tried going too. It had been five days since he showed up just hoping for a chance to survive. A month since his exile.
The sheriff poured a cup of coffee for himself as one of the deputies just went on home. "So, lizard, the judge should be here today. How do you think they'll take to an exile walking into a human town like this? Eh?"
"I would hope they would listen to my story. Your deputies like to splash me with water when I get to some parts. Says I'm a witch doctor or something." Sisst just gave the sheriff a gentle look. "You didn't want to talk before, why?"
"I don't like exiles, but you asked to speak to a judge and asked for sanctuary till they arrive. I will do what needs to be done."
"Is that why the jail doors are never locked? You want me to escape so you can shoot me?" The pure fury in the sheriff's eyes made his cold blood freeze. "I will obey your laws, sir. My exile would not happen if I was human."
The cup of coffee was slammed on the table and the jail door thrown open as the sheriff stormed in. "What does that mean, LIZARD?" He bellowed at me while gripping the handle of his pistol tightly.
"What I did to be exiled is not a crime to you humans, but done by those who are well paid and respected." Sisst said just remaining in his seated position as he looked up at the furious man. "I did what I did for love of my sister, if you would hear me out, I would explain."
"Then why not listen, Sheriff Calloway." The firm voice of a man shook the sheriff and made him spin. Standing at the door frame was an older human in a nice suit. "Step out before you beat the lizard, and sit down." The sheriff looked ready to kick Sisst before he spun around and sat in the chair taking up his coffee. "Now, what's your name and why are you here?"
"I am Sisst, I have no tribe name after my exile. I saw a human town as I traveled for some place to live and tried here." Sisst, stood up and respectfully bowed to the new man.
"I'm Judge Walker. Why are you an exile?" The man poured his own cup of coffee as he gave me a hard look.
"My sister, Hammu, grew ill and had something our people call the black lump. A growth that starts on the lungs and causes water breathing to be hampered if not impossible. It in time kills." Sisst just turned to pace a few steps in his cell. "I took several trips into the swamp for specific ingredients to concoct a powerful sedative and healing potion."
"So you drugged your sister to death?" The Sheriff said just ready to pounce like a cougar.
"No, I put her to sleep. With sharp knives and a steady hand I cut her body open, cut off the black lump and proceeded to sew her lung and scales shut. My crime is witchcraft and sorcery. My reason, was I wished to save my sister. Once she was awake, she recovered quite fast, but could do nothing to spare me as I did it without telling her first."
The judge just sipped his coffee a bit as he considered my story. "Where did you learn all that you needed to do that?"
"A book, I brought it with me but the Sheriff took it along with my few remaining possessions." Sisst said looking to the sheriff. A grumble and the man stood to grab the ragged leather sack that was Sisst's life. In it was a slightly ruined and damaged book. "The first words sound so, good."
The judge read the first few lines aloud. "By these teachings and in the eyes of the gods, I swear to never use my blade and teachings to cause undue harm and pain of others. I will freely give of my skill to the mending of body and healing of ills. I shall persevere to never abuse those under my care for any reason." Judge Walker than looked at several marked pages. "Threads good for sewing up skin, knots and ties, even ways of cleaning a wound. It'sa medical textbook."
The sheriff just turned hearing that. "He's no witch, but a doctor? Bull!!"
"My sister lives, healed. I disobeyed my people to save her life. I do not regret it. I would obey my oath here too."
The judge just gave a soft scoff. "The lizard doctor, Sisst. Might not be so bad. This town could use a doctor."
