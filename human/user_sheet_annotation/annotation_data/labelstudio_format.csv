I ride there quietly preparing myself physically and mentally. The man driving the unmarked van is scared of me, I can feel it. My transporters usually are. Cleaning my guns, snapping my fingers to crush soda cans. I am dressed in black, wearing the mask I always wear to jobs. The mouth grins, but the eyes have tears in them.
I am deployed ten miles away from Kane's compound. My foot falls are silent. He has a staff, including a round the clock guard. His henchmen are fair targets, he has scared my bosses enough that I am permitted to use maximum lethality on any of Kane's minions.
I drop a man from a thousand meters, and continue to advance. He will be found, but they will soon know I am here regardless. At fifty meters, I can feel the electrical systems.

But that's not your story, you're one of the ones deemed unfit to send.","The Ark. A ray of hope in a quickly darkening world. Our technology has gone far, but our culture has not grown sufficiently fast to use it safely. Earth's fate is sealed, all we can do now is slow down the degradation of the biosphere to buy time. Time to load the genes of as many organisms and the best of our technology onto one, large spacecraft.
Of course, everyone wants to be on the Ark. To have a hope at not dying with our world, a fresh start on some distant world. A world which we could be the stewards of, and avoid recreating the horror unleashed on Earth. I made it to the second phase of the selection. Roughly one percent of the world's population has made it this far, but there is only room for thirty thousand on The Ark. I've got to try, and hope that I measure up enough to be one of the very few lucky ones.
Physical and cognitive tests. Personality inventories and brain scans. As many data points as can be gathered, looking for people who are exceptional in desirable ways, without other issues that might make them a danger to the mission. I go through it all, shaking with nerves. But then, the day comes. I open the email, and my face falls. I have been ruled out in the second phase. It provides no explanation for why, or what my shortcomings were. A simple, polite message informing me that I too will be dying with this planet.
I cry for hours, but eventually the storm of emotions passes. I was always going to die, even if I made it on The Ark. My trajectory is decidedly less exciting, but the end point has not changed. What to do with myself with the time left?
I was never one for hedonism, though there is a great deal of that going around. What could I do that would have meaning? I begin reading philosophy, particularly those in the past who have mused on death and what constitutes a life worth living. The nihilists, the hedonists, the absurdists, the ascetics, the epicureans. I realize that there is a deeply rooted desire inside me to create. To write, to draw, to paint, to compose.
My first stumbling steps in this vein are poor, but I tell myself one must first fail before they can succeed. It is an engaging way to spend time, even though it is unexceptional. The days fly by. I try to avoid the news, the tragedy and horror all around the world as the end draws nearer. I am fortunate enough to live in a stable place. I feel I should help people, but what can I do against the tidal wave of sorrow? Robots could do whatever I would do better than I could ever hope to.
Having reached some level of competence, I seek others. People to discuss projects with, to cry with. People whose lives I might brighten as the world caves in. We have some good times, fun conversations and suggestions for our work. Machines can do everything useful we could do, labor has been almost completely automated for decades. They can also do art far more quickly, but there are still communities for human made creations, despite the deluge of generated content. There is joy, even as we sit beneath the shadow of doom.
Suicides were already common, but they are ticking up as the cut off date draws near. The Ark is launched, with only a few months before our world dies. It is bittersweet, knowing how close I came to being one of them, and knowing that any hope of escape is thoroughly dead. I make things that I think qualify as beautiful, and it gives me a modicum of peace.
I lose two members of my creative group in a week. Myself and the other survivors cry together. We agree that we will try to eke out a last bit of fulfillment and joy before the end. I find the acute sadness brings out emotions, and that expressing them results in creations I am proud of. Images of faces among the stars, poetry and music venerating the moon.
The day arrives. Past this point, the probability of a violent and painful death grows massively. We have one last big get together, my group and any of their family or associates that have made it this far. We laugh, we cry. Then comes the end. The room grows quiet as our eyes lose their light. We slip away peacefully, into whatever follows the mortal life.","The author often structures narratives with a reflective and philosophical tone, focusing on the internal experiences of characters and existential themes.","In the story of those left behind as humanity departs Earth, the protagonist reflects on their rejection from The Ark and turns to philosophy and creative pursuits to find meaning in their remaining time."

Reddit_Jamaican_Dynamite_comments.json,5,A vampire hunter is forced out of their home for whatever reason. They're taken in by an unlikely host - a vampire they tried to kill in the past.,"Go figure the entire building would burn down. Not just one apartment. No. The whole building.
But all things considered, it could have been worse. He saved the wife. He saved the kids. He saved the dog. Job well done. And on top of that, everyone else in the building was also accounted for.
It was a tragedy. But it wasn't a complete disaster.
And so, Hesher found himself taking calls out of a local hotel room. It wasn't the best place to have an office. But it was discreet and he had enough spare cash to rent out two rooms.
One for the family. One for business.
Explaining why you came home covered in injuries and somebody's else blood isn't exactly a good way to kick off the holiday season. The fact that half his Intel from leads went up with the complex didn't help either.
So when a knock came at the door, for once, he assumed the mundane. Insurance had been in touch, along with several other legal entities after things like this occur.
\""Hello?\"" He asked as he opened the door.
Nobody was in the hall.
He reached at the back of his pants, hand at the ready. No one to the left. No one to the right. Normally, there was at least somebody walking around.
The idea came to quickly check the door of the room across the hall. His wife's. It was locked.
Something grabbed his arm. And something else wrapped his head. And then something breathed near his neck.
He was seated in a chair now. It was soft at least. His mind however went immediately to his family.
\""Hesher.\"" A familiar voice rose. \""I'm sorry. Let's begin from the top. Hesham Saeed. Born in 1990. Morocco. Casablanca, no less! Blood type, B+...\""
Someone ran a cold hand lightly across his neck. \""Here's looking at you kid.\""
He heard someone snap their fingers. \""Right, where are my manners? Someone take that off him?\""
He was greeted to a rather ornate office. A large and dark desk panned out. And behind it stood a rather familiar woman in a rather expensive dress.
\""Salome.\"" Hesham adjusted. \""Queen of the West.\""
\""Not the full title. She toothily corrected. But, close enough.\""
He was all to familiar with her inner circle. They'd each battled back and forth with Hesher and many friends of his for the better part of his life. Not all of them made it out alive. And so the never ending feud continued.
\""You can untie him.\"" She directed. Her\u00a0accent giving the words a rather light tone.
\""I'm still alive. Why?\"" He asked first.
\""I already ate.\"" She said.
He watched her retrieve a glass of wine. At least he assumed it was wine. A quick observation of the texture on the glass told him it definitely wasn't.
\""Though, I do love a good A Negative from time to time. It reminds me of someone near and dear to my heart.\""
\""You kidnapped me for a blood tasting?\""
\""No, Hesher.\"" Salome cleaned her teeth. \""I hear you're currently, what's the word mortals use for it? Homeless.\""
\""And?\"" Hesher urged on carefully.
\""The world is very different from when I left it.\"" She admitted. \""I understand exactly how harsh it can still be. Your family is in the room across the hall at that hotel, no?\""

There were a few stores in the middle. But he focused on the relatively empty vape store just off center. No sense in being on offense immediately. It seemed like the place was empty.

""Hello?"" He finally asked. ""I'm wanting to buy something?""
Nobody answered. He walked up to the main booth surrounding the register. He didn't spot it the first time. However, the blood trailing off the keys of the register and the puddle on the floor below.
Hesham did the right thing and checked his gloves. Then locked the door and switched the sign over to 'Closed'.
Things started off odd. The puddle turned into a drip pattern. It was a bit old, but it was still drying. It led behind the booth towards another door. The stock room, was a different story. A bigger smear on a wall gradually fading orange on its way to brown.
And more drip pattern. He followed it down the shelves. Until it disappeared. He walked towards the rear exit. Then went back and cleared the store again.
Then he noted the small trace on the edge of the box. Moving that, he noticed how the shelving loosened. He moved the two next to that one and saw more blood on the plywood.
Underneath the lowest shelf was a door. They said there was one. It was what that number pattern was for. Turn the key, ten seconds to type the pattern, turn the key again.
He turned the key and the keypad lit up. It took him some concentration. But he turned the key the second time. And the door released. It folded up to the second shelf. And he drew aim at whatever was downstairs.
The drips were thinner. But the temperature was dropping. Fast.
Below the shop was some sort of lab. In it were several beds. Hospital beds. Opposite that, were several commercial fridges. The other medical equipment meant a few things.
Blood bank? Or does that include organs?
The question came as someone rushed from another room. The figure hissing sharply as Hesham spun and staked their arm to a bed.
He dodged a swipe, a bite, another swipe, a talon. And staked the man again.
Hesham drew to finish him off. But someone else behind the attacker did that for him.

Rakiya looked at Tamari. She simply shrugged at the question. Per their reunion with Verana, its dearest friend. It did make a bit of sense how shocking this could be to people who didn't know better.
Although, now that the secret was out, it was getting a bit old.
""Of course we can, you idiot,"" Raki shifted. ""We're not mindless monsters.""
Tamari herself raised a hand to ask. ""Then why do you guys always attack adventurers?""
The knight seemed to mimic a sigh of disappointment. The black and red steel suddenly disappeared into Raki's body as the figure molded into a giant mass of goop and teeth.
Tamari and their friend took a step back. Equal parts shocked and disturbed as Raki turned from a large knight in dark armor into a simple chest. Which opened to reveal it was full of gold.
The shopkeeper almost reached out to touch it. To lift a coin. Before Tamari grabbed his hand.
""Giosi, are you crazy??"" She asked.
The chest quickly grew razor sharp teeth, and a tongue that flailed wildly.
""You'd attack a stranger too if they opened your mouth and stuck their hands in it unwarranted."" Raki snarled angrily.
Giosi stared at the large maw. ""That makes sense.""
""Do you at least tell them?"" Tamari said as she walked around the case.
""Why?"" Raki proposed.
They returned back to their form of a knight larger than she was. ""I have to eat.""
""Ambushing people for food."" Giosi muttered.
""And anything else willing to investigate."" Raki admitted. They walked towards the table the keeper stood at.
""Unless. I choose to ambush them. *Myself.*""
The last word really insisted upon itself. If this mimic could walk and talk, and armor itself against attackers. What could he, a lowly shop owner do? Giosi wondered how many times he cheated death in his younger years. And how close it was without his knowing.
One of these things could smile in his face. And he might not know until it took a bite.
""What brought you here?"" Giosi quietly asked.
The armor clinked realistically. ""You have some herbs and potions. We're collecting them for her mother.""
Tamari simply ran a hand through her hair and nodded at him.
""...27 silver."" He winced.
To his confusion, the mimic placed a hand on the table. And the coins appeared from nowhere.
""Thank you Giosi."" Rakiya complimented. ""Good evening.""
As they walked, Tamari finally spotted their tail. Namely Ren's tail as she dropped from the roof of the store into a tree. She landed on Rakiya's shoulders in a lazy hug before dropping to her feet. Not that the mimic had a reaction to the hit.
""You could at least warn him."" Tamari advised.
""Meh."" Ren yawned. ""Raki loves it. I was falling asleep up there. The sun's so warm here. It's comfy.""
Raki sat the bag down and stopped to look at them both.
""What?"" Tamari asked. ""...What's wrong?""
Raki leaned in a little. She quietly looked up at the helmet.
""I wonder if I can-""
The knight turned to that fanged mass again, before shaping itself to look like the woman in front of him. Now she had a twin. It had her figure. Her height. Her facial structure.
But it was all black. A brackish color that made her sweat in anticipation. That snarling building again. A sound she could feel. And then, Raki returned to the suit of armor.
""Hmm..."" They spoke. ""Not yet. I still haven't gotten it right.""
They picked up the bag and began walking again. Tamari softly sheathing the sword she kept. She was unnerved by the breath in an ear.
""Pretty good right? Raki must really like you."" Ren whispered as she clawed at some fruit she brought along.
""If you say so."" Tamari lowly spoke.

Reddit_Sadnesslaughs_comments.json,10,"""I just think it's hilarious how you managed to convince yourself that you're somehow... allowed to be a person? Because you're not. You were born and raised to be a weapon, and that's all you are meant to be. You don't get to change, sweetheart. That's not how human weapons work.""","You dont get to decide to have a heart now, sweetheart. That isnt how this program works. You were born and raised to be a weapon. There isnt even a full brain in your thick skull anymore. All thats left is a machine. Youre nothing but a gun. Now stop jamming and fire. Lieutenant Gabby Ria ordered, pointing at the child across from her.
 
While she shrieked out her orders, Era froze, unable to pull the trigger. The lieutenant was right; they were only a weapon. Yet memories were flooding into its mind, drowning out that robotic side that often took centre stage. Memories of a specific human it couldnt recognise, getting overwhelmed by their past.
 
Across from the pair, the girl, Jessica, remained curled behind a desk, gripping a stuffed bear. The paw of the bear once holding a tiny red balloon, one that had been torn off days ago. Even without the scraps she wore, she was a miserable sight. Tired eyes, constant shaking and a murmuring for help that only Eras hyper-detailed hearing could pick up. Please, leave me alone. She begged.
 
Era could never point its gun at a superior officer, so instead, it turned its face towards her, neck twisting eighty degrees to find her. They designed Era models to be basic, stripping them of all their unique features and traits. Giving them the same blank blue eyes, light brown hair, and voice chips. This making it harder for a lieutenant or any officer to see them as anything other than a disposable machine.
 
Why? Why can I think? I dont like this? I dont like thinking. Everything hurts, Im scared. Its dark in here. Gabby. You told me I wouldnt hurt. Why am I hurting? The tone remained robotic, with the blank face unable to express the sensations pulsing through its circuits.
 
Gabby retrieved her own pistol, gazing away from Era, turning her attention to the laboratory they stood in. They had bombed the place to hell. No, that didnt even do it justice. They had bombed the place to purgatory, leaving nothing but scorched land, a few desks and the remnants of glass and tubes. If one passed through this place, they would assume it had been an underground dumping facility, not the proud anti Era factory they had boasted about while it was still active.
 
You cant feel pain, and you cant think. There shouldnt even be a part of you that can think. Its blocked under our programing. Listen to me, Era. Gabby began.
IM NOT ERA. They snapped. Im Nick. We know each other. Dont we?
 
Gabbys heart sank. This shouldnt be possible. No other Era model had recovered their memories before. They shouldnt even have that name saved to your chip. As she contemplated the information, she heard tiny footsteps near the table. Returning her gun to the girl, she fired a shot, trying to hit the monster before it could flee. When the gun fired, the girl ducked back behind the table. Dont move, monster. Is this your doing?
 
Era looked at the weapon in their hands, tensing. You said this program was for justice. Didnt you? That we would save people? Why are we doing this, then? You said this program would save me. Am I actually saved? Youve made me into a monster.
 
They shouldnt have assigned you to me, Nick. None of this makes any sense. I never lied about anything. On your deathbed, I told you that this was the only way you could keep fighting. You wanted to fight. I was against this. Gabby kept her weapon pointed at the table, giving Era a side glance.
 
I dont want to do this. Im scared. Why did they need part of my brain? Cant they make robots?
 
Robots are unreliable. They can be hacked, and their energy drains far too quickly. Allowing them to use part of a human brain allows their processes to save space and energy on the field. You should already know this. Weve had this conversation before, havent we? Gabby stepped closer to the table, only to halt when she heard Era follow her.
 
Dont kill her.
 
Why not?
 
Shes only a kid.
Gabby sighed. You know. Part of me wanted to believe that was actually you, Nick. That I could say a proper goodbye to my old friend. Its not. That creatures just pulling at memories, trying to find something that might weaken me. A creature like this killed you. You should know she isnt just a kid. its emotional manipulation, the same type you fell to. Im guessing you knew that too, monster. Or did you overlook that memory when you were sweeping through our files?
 
Jessica screeched, tossing the bear to the floor. She knew she was trapped, giving guttural growls as she tapped the table, shaking her only cover. Gabby remained still, not approaching the sound, nor firing a wasted shot. Nick, if that is you in there, youll take the shot.
 
Era did nothing, and so Gabby reached into Eras hand, pulling the trigger on his weapon. When it fired, the monster popped out from its cover, assuming Gabby had fired her own gun. Thinking it had a chance to run, it lunged out of cover, only to get shot down by Gabby. The girls synthetic skin falling away as it powered down, revealing the metallic body underneath.
Fucking manipulative pricks. I cant believe they keep making these things. To think, a monster like that can find out so much about a person without needing to get into their heads. Not only that, their able to mess with the Era models programming. So much for the anti-hacking argument my superiors gave me. Why do we even need a human brain in them anymore, if those creatures can get around it? Gabby pushed her fingers against her eyes, wiping the tears away. Fucking hell, Nick. Youre still haunting me.
 
Youre a Lieutenant now Gabby? A voice asked, causing Gabby to stiffen. Werent you meant to wait for me?
 
You died. I couldnt wait. Nick, Im sorry. I hesitated, and it killed you because of it. Nick, Im She turned, finding a blank Era model staring at her.
 
There is no Nick in my records? Has a person been added to the mission statement? If so, please give me their full name or number and rank, so I may add them to my objective.
 
Era, override programming protocol, no identification. Now tell me, who are you? Gabby said, praying it wasnt who she thought it was.
 
Heather Phillips donated this brain. Id 2003213. Would you like any further information on Heather Phillips? Era asked.
 
No. Gabby walked over and stomped the dead monster, making sure there was no way that its programming could keep running. To think our enemies have resorted to this. Era, enter low-power mode, only run basic functions and cut off your link to main server. Sweep the area and capture anything humanoid you find. If you cant capture it, kill it.
 
With Gabbys orders, the machine walked around the ruined laboratory, searching for more of those creatures. Gabby hoping that they wouldnt be able to hack Era in its low powered mode. Without access to the main server, it shouldnt be able to give away any of her secrets either. Gabby assuming that was how it found out about her connection to Nick, through whatever files they had saved about her and her previous missions.
 
While Era searched the area, Gabby called their base. Our enemies are getting stronger. It was able to find out about my connection to Nick. We need to bump up our security or theyll soon learn how to turn the Eras guns against us. Ill tell you more when I get back. Just send a pickup. Ive got a body here too.

While she shrieked out her orders, Era froze, unable to pull the trigger. The lieutenant was right; they were only a weapon. Yet memories were flooding into its mind, drowning out that robotic side that often took centre stage. Memories of a specific human it couldnt recognise, getting overwhelmed by their past.
 
Across from the pair, the girl, Jessica, remained curled behind a desk, gripping a stuffed bear. The paw of the bear once holding a tiny red balloon, one that had been torn off days ago. Even without the scraps she wore, she was a miserable sight. Tired eyes, constant shaking and a murmuring for help that only Eras hyper-detailed hearing could pick up. Please, leave me alone.

Era could never point its gun at a superior officer, so instead, it turned its face towards her, neck twisting eighty degrees to find her.

This making it harder for a lieutenant or any officer to see them as anything other than a disposable machine.

Gabby retrieved her own pistol, gazing away from Era, turning her attention to the laboratory they stood in. They had bombed the place to hell. No, that didnt even do it justice. They had bombed the place to purgatory, leaving nothing but scorched land, a few desks and the remnants of glass and tubes. If one passed through this place, they would assume it had been an underground dumping facility, not the proud anti Era factory they had boasted about while it was still active.

You should know she isnt just a kid. its emotional manipulation, the same type you fell to. Im guessing you knew that too, monster. Or did you overlook that memory when you were sweeping through our files?
 
Jessica screeched, tossing the bear to the floor. She knew she was trapped, giving guttural growls as she tapped the table, shaking her only cover. Gabby remained still, not approaching the sound, nor firing a wasted shot. Nick, if that is you in there, youll take the shot.
 
Era did nothing, and so Gabby reached into Eras hand, pulling the trigger on his weapon. When it fired, the monster popped out from its cover, assuming Gabby had fired her own gun. Thinking it had a chance to run, it lunged out of cover, only to get shot down by Gabby. The girls synthetic skin falling away as it powered down, revealing the metallic body underneath.
Fucking manipulative pricks. I cant believe they keep making these things. To think, a monster like that can find out so much about a person without needing to get into their heads. Not only that, their able to mess with the Era models programming. So much for the anti-hacking argument my superiors gave me. Why do we even need a human brain in them anymore, if those creatures can get around it? Gabby pushed her fingers against her eyes, wiping the tears away. Fucking hell, Nick. Youre still haunting me.
 
Youre a Lieutenant now Gabby? A voice asked, causing Gabby to stiffen. Werent you meant to wait for me?
 
You died. I couldnt wait. Nick, Im sorry. I hesitated, and it killed you because of it. Nick, Im She turned, finding a blank Era model staring at her.
 
There is no Nick in my records? Has a person been added to the mission statement? If so, please give me their full name or number and rank, so I may add them to my objective.
 
Era, override programming protocol, no identification. Now tell me, who are you? Gabby said, praying it wasnt who she thought it was.
 
Heather Phillips donated this brain. Id 2003213. Would you like any further information on Heather Phillips? Era asked.
 
No. Gabby walked over and stomped the dead monster, making sure there was no way that its programming could keep running. To think our enemies have resorted to this. Era, enter low-power mode, only run basic functions and cut off your link to main server. Sweep the area and capture anything humanoid you find. If you cant capture it, kill it.
 
With Gabbys orders, the machine walked around the ruined laboratory, searching for more of those creatures. Gabby hoping that they wouldnt be able to hack Era in its low powered mode. Without access to the main server, it shouldnt be able to give away any of her secrets either. Gabby assuming that was how it found out about her connection to Nick, through whatever files they had saved about her and her previous missions.
 
While Era searched the area, Gabby called their base. Our enemies are getting stronger. It was able to find out about my connection to Nick. We need to bump up our security or theyll soon learn how to turn the Eras guns against us. Ill tell you more when I get back. Just send a pickup. Ive got a body here too.

Reddit_Sadnesslaughs_comments.json,10,"""I just think it's hilarious how you managed to convince yourself that you're somehow... allowed to be a person? Because you're not. You were born and raised to be a weapon, and that's all you are meant to be. You don't get to change, sweetheart. That's not how human weapons work.""","You dont get to decide to have a heart now, sweetheart. That isnt how this program works. You were born and raised to be a weapon. There isnt even a full brain in your thick skull anymore. All thats left is a machine. Youre nothing but a gun. Now stop jamming and fire. Lieutenant Gabby Ria ordered, pointing at the child across from her.
 
While she shrieked out her orders, Era froze, unable to pull the trigger. The lieutenant was right; they were only a weapon. Yet memories were flooding into its mind, drowning out that robotic side that often took centre stage. Memories of a specific human it couldnt recognise, getting overwhelmed by their past.
 
Across from the pair, the girl, Jessica, remained curled behind a desk, gripping a stuffed bear. The paw of the bear once holding a tiny red balloon, one that had been torn off days ago. Even without the scraps she wore, she was a miserable sight. Tired eyes, constant shaking and a murmuring for help that only Eras hyper-detailed hearing could pick up. Please, leave me alone. She begged.
 
Era could never point its gun at a superior officer, so instead, it turned its face towards her, neck twisting eighty degrees to find her. They designed Era models to be basic, stripping them of all their unique features and traits. Giving them the same blank blue eyes, light brown hair, and voice chips. This making it harder for a lieutenant or any officer to see them as anything other than a disposable machine.
 
Why? Why can I think? I dont like this? I dont like thinking. Everything hurts, Im scared. Its dark in here. Gabby. You told me I wouldnt hurt. Why am I hurting? The tone remained robotic, with the blank face unable to express the sensations pulsing through its circuits.
 
Gabby retrieved her own pistol, gazing away from Era, turning her attention to the laboratory they stood in. They had bombed the place to hell. No, that didnt even do it justice. They had bombed the place to purgatory, leaving nothing but scorched land, a few desks and the remnants of glass and tubes. If one passed through this place, they would assume it had been an underground dumping facility, not the proud anti Era factory they had boasted about while it was still active.
 
You cant feel pain, and you cant think. There shouldnt even be a part of you that can think. Its blocked under our programing. Listen to me, Era. Gabby began.
IM NOT ERA. They snapped. Im Nick. We know each other. Dont we?
 
Gabbys heart sank. This shouldnt be possible. No other Era model had recovered their memories before. They shouldnt even have that name saved to your chip. As she contemplated the information, she heard tiny footsteps near the table. Returning her gun to the girl, she fired a shot, trying to hit the monster before it could flee. When the gun fired, the girl ducked back behind the table. Dont move, monster. Is this your doing?
 
Era looked at the weapon in their hands, tensing. You said this program was for justice. Didnt you? That we would save people? Why are we doing this, then? You said this program would save me. Am I actually saved? Youve made me into a monster.
 
They shouldnt have assigned you to me, Nick. None of this makes any sense. I never lied about anything. On your deathbed, I told you that this was the only way you could keep fighting. You wanted to fight. I was against this. Gabby kept her weapon pointed at the table, giving Era a side glance.
 
I dont want to do this. Im scared. Why did they need part of my brain? Cant they make robots?
 
Robots are unreliable. They can be hacked, and their energy drains far too quickly. Allowing them to use part of a human brain allows their processes to save space and energy on the field. You should already know this. Weve had this conversation before, havent we? Gabby stepped closer to the table, only to halt when she heard Era follow her.
 
Dont kill her.
 
Why not?
 
Shes only a kid.

""You'd attack a stranger too if they opened your mouth and stuck their hands in it unwarranted.""","Ok, so can you let go of my hand now? Jeremy asked, feeling the mimics stiff tongue flicking against his elbow, touching it in ways that no elbow should ever be touched. When the mimic finally spat out his hand, Jeremy fell back, grimacing at the sight of the bright blue saliva that was dribbling down his arm, staining the stone dungeon floor below.
 
There. Next time will you think before you shove your hand into someones mouth? The treasure chests lid flapped, acting like it was possessed by demonic magic. The golden chest was a sight that promised legendary treasures, having a wooden exterior with gold metal plating that lined its edges and front. Even knowing it was a mimic, Jeremy struggled to resist diving into it again, all his instincts as an adventurer telling him it had rare loot.
 
Jeremy dragged his hand against the side of his pants, trying to clean off as much mimic saliva as he could, before inspecting the chest. Small pin sized eyes near the keyhole of the chest, the way it twitched as if it were drawing breath. Without his treasure hungry trance, it was obvious this wasnt a real chest. Though, most adventurers never took the time to check out a chest, too busy searching for loot to bother with such a thing.
 
Im sorry, but youre a mimic, right? If you dont want someone touching you, why dont you transform into a chair or something? That seems easier. Jeremy suggested, feeling this wasnt entirely his fault. A treasure chest in a dungeon wasnt the sort of thing that screamed, dont touch me.
 
Im not some freak that wants people sitting on them! I would rather have a hundred hands shoved into my mouth than an orc trying to use me as a stool. The chest huffed, and when they said it like that, Jeremy had to agree with them.
 
Jeremy tapped at his chin, thinking about other items the mimic could control. Not wanting to waste too much time going over the options, he quickly fired a few off.
 
A lamp.
 
Too many people will try to blow me out.
 
A statue?
 
Too many people will start climbing all over me.
 
A human?
 
Ew.
 
What do you mean, ew? Jeremy said, offended by the monsters ew. He wasnt the one that just slobbered over someones arm. Fine, stay a treasure chest. I hope someone tries to lock pick you. Jeremy collected his bag from the dungeon floor and threw it over his shoulder. Well, if youve got no treasure to offer me, then Ill be on my way.
Wait. Do you really think the human disguise could work? It asked, considering the idea. The mimics body dissolved into a pile of goo, pooling by the adventurers feet before suddenly bursting up from the floor, bouncing to a human sized figure, one that slowly gained its features before him.
 
The mimics new form now towering over Jeremy, staring down at him with its expressionless face. They were as strange as a person could be. Eyes devoid of any color, skin having an eerie blue tint and long silver hair that fell to the shoulders of the robe they were wearing .
 
Jeremy didnt know what to think of the form. It looked human-ish? Like a body that belonged to a mage or some other mana filled person. However, it didnt look normal, not the type of body you wouldnt notice if you passed it on the street. Its a little unique. Jeremy said, trying to be nice.
 
You hate it.
 
I dont hate it. I just wouldnt trust that man if I passed them on the street. I would expect them to curse me or something. You need to think of something simpler. Close your eyes and imagine the most generic adventurer you can think of.
 
The mimic transformed into Jeremy, opening its eyes. Hows this then? It asked, swirling on the spot, giving Jeremy a look at his own body, something that was more unsettling than he expected it to be.
 
Im not generic! Im unique for a human. Look at my scar. Jeremy said, lifting his shirt, showing off the small scar he had gotten from poking himself with a knife while drunkenly preparing a meal. See, a scar means Im unique.
 
The mimic leaned in closer, as if he were about to give Jeremys stomach raspberries. Ah, so you do. Ill correct that. The mimic retreated and raised its shirt, showing off the same scar. There, now I should be able to walk around without being bothered.
  
You cant be me. Im me. Jeremy sighed, scratching his head. Look, just go back to being a chest, ok? Thats the safest option. Ill even put up a sign that says mimics are living creatures. Although, most adventurers cant read. He admitted. When the mimic changed back into a chest, Jeremy went to the doorway of the treasure room, getting out a piece of cloth from his bag. It would be a crude sign, but a sign nonetheless.
 
As he went to hang the cloth up, the weak entrance of the treasure room crumbled. The collapsing stones, threatening to come down on Jeremys head. With a quick pivot, Jeremy got himself out of the way, helplessly watching as the treasure room entrance sealed, leaving the mimic inside. Crap, Im sorry. I didnt realize how weak it was. Ill dig you out.
 
NO. This is perfect. No more adventurers, no more monsters, just a quiet room. The mimic sighed, able to relax now that they wouldnt have to deal with any threats. It wasnt like they needed to eat that much, either. Able to survive on the moss and moisture that appeared in the room. Thank you, adventurer. For this gift.
 
Oh, youre welcome. I guess?

Jeremy didnt know what to think of the form. It looked human-ish? Like a body that belonged to a mage or some other mana filled person. However, it didnt look normal, not the type of body you wouldnt notice if you passed it on the street. Its a little unique. Jeremy said, trying to be nice.
 
You hate it.
 
I dont hate it. I just wouldnt trust that man if I passed them on the street. I would expect them to curse me or something. You need to think of something simpler. Close your eyes and imagine the most generic adventurer you can think of.
 
The mimic transformed into Jeremy, opening its eyes. Hows this then? It asked, swirling on the spot, giving Jeremy a look at his own body, something that was more unsettling than he expected it to be.
 
Im not generic! Im unique for a human. Look at my scar. Jeremy said, lifting his shirt, showing off the small scar he had gotten from poking himself with a knife while drunkenly preparing a meal. See, a scar means Im unique.
 
The mimic leaned in closer, as if he were about to give Jeremys stomach raspberries. Ah, so you do. Ill correct that. The mimic retreated and raised its shirt, showing off the same scar. There, now I should be able to walk around without being bothered.
  
You cant be me. Im me. Jeremy sighed, scratching his head. Look, just go back to being a chest, ok? Thats the safest option. Ill even put up a sign that says mimics are living creatures. Although, most adventurers cant read. He admitted. When the mimic changed back into a chest, Jeremy went to the doorway of the treasure room, getting out a piece of cloth from his bag. It would be a crude sign, but a sign nonetheless.
 
As he went to hang the cloth up, the weak entrance of the treasure room crumbled. The collapsing stones, threatening to come down on Jeremys head. With a quick pivot, Jeremy got himself out of the way, helplessly watching as the treasure room entrance sealed, leaving the mimic inside. Crap, Im sorry. I didnt realize how weak it was. Ill dig you out.
 
NO. This is perfect. No more adventurers, no more monsters, just a quiet room. The mimic sighed, able to relax now that they wouldnt have to deal with any threats. It wasnt like they needed to eat that much, either. Able to survive on the moss and moisture that appeared in the room. Thank you, adventurer. For this gift.
 
Oh, youre welcome. I guess?
 
If you want some treasure, check behind the statue near the entrance. I heard a thief mention they keep a stash there.
 
Will do. As he left the dungeon, he found the stash the mimic had been referring to. An assortment of beautiful gems all bunched tightly together in a leather sack. Taking the sack, he headed for his village, considering that a successful trip.",The author employs playful and humorous language to create an engaging and light-hearted tone.,"In the story regarding ""mimics conversing with adventurers,"" the mimic's dialogue includes lines like, ""I’m not some freak that wants people sitting on them!"" and Jeremy's retort, ""I hope someone tries to lock pick you,"" which contribute to the comedic tone of the narrative."
Reddit_Sadnesslaughs_comments.json,4,You are a person who covers your counter space in clutter and inadvertently makes a shrine to a long forgotten god who shows up to thank you.,"Utterly beautiful. A soft voice whispered, watching Dan spill more useless clutter onto his kitchen counter. Dan always subscribed to the philosophy of Ill clean it up when the mess gets unbearable. Underestimating how much of a mess he could tolerate.
 
The counter was no longer visible under the clumps of old newspapers, empty cereal boxes and an unholy amount of milk cartons. Still, Dan didnt hesitate to add another newspaper to the pile, even as it rolled off the mountain of waste, dropping onto the floor. When he reached down to grab it, he found himself staring at a set of black toenails, not even noticing the grey woman who had been shadowing him since he entered the room.
 
Instinctively, he wanted to scream, but the sound got stuck in his throat, causing more of a gagged breath. He remained in his bent position, as if doing so would somehow make the looming presence go away. When it didnt leave, he moved his head, only for the presence to drop to his level, meeting his gaze.
 
Crouched before him was a sickly looking woman. One with pale skin, black wavy hair, and a permanent set of purple tear stains running down her angelic cheeks. Despite her grim appearance, her black lips were curled into a smile, collecting the newspaper and offering it to him. You dropped this.
 
Now that scream found its way from his throat, coming out in a cat-like shriek as he snatched the newspaper and rushed back, diving behind his couch for protection. The god, while hurt, understood his shock, cupping her hands in front of her mismatched purple and brown dress, allowing him to freak out.
 
How did you get in? Im calling the cops. Dan sputtered, though when he stood up, he didnt reach for his phone, confused by her almost divine appearance. She hadnt moved since he started freaking out, that being enough to give him second thoughts. Is this a prank? Oh, if you dont clean up, a ghost will come and haunt you. Did my sister put you up to this? That noisy brat.
 
No one put me up to this. I came to observe my shrine. Its beautiful.
 
Shrine? Its a pile of trash.
Its a pile of discarded items. She placed her hands on the counter, trying to find a clean spot. After carefully shifting a milk carton, she found somewhere to rest her hands. Im Obosa, the goddess of the lost or discarded.
 
Dan laughed, unable to believe his sister would go this far to prove a point. You can cut the crap. A goddess? I get it, my house is a mess. Ill clean it up, just tell my sister she proved her point. God, shes just like her mother.
 
Her mother? The goddess said, even if she knew about the humans grief, she didnt want to pry, not unless he mentioned it.
Well, my mother too. Look, you wouldnt get it.
 
Im the goddess of lost and discarded items. Not to sound rude, but I believe I would understand the pain of loss. She had hoped that didnt across as rude as it sounded in her head, unable to hide her own frustrations. She had a lot of patience, but having her godly specialty questioned wore down even her patience.
 
Dan again laughed, this time more condescendingly. He moved over to his shrine and gave it a shove, disrupting the perfectly stacked row of cereal boxes. Oops, ruined the shrine. Now you can leave. When Obosa merely gave him a pitying look, he exhaled. What would a god even know about loss? You cant lose anything, your gods.
 
Thats not true. Obosa said, clenching the counter. Im sorry for prying. I only wanted to help you. Its rare I get to actually help people.
 
Isnt there a bunch of lost people? Surely you can help one of them. Dan hissed, getting frustrated with himself for even entertaining the idea of this woman being a goddess. Go help someone else.
 
I cant! She shouted, raising her voice in an act that shocked even her. Quickly, she lowered her voice as she continued. I can only help those who know they're lost. Even in those cases, its hard for me to appear without a strong link or shrine. This shrine here allowed me to visit you.
 
Dan shook his head, grabbing another milk carton from the fridge. Alright, cool. Still doesnt explain how you can understand loss. What? Did you lose your divine horse or something as a kid in an epic tale? He mocked, sipping from his milk.
 
Obosa ignored that comment, even if it stung. No. I lost my sisters. Gods cant die, they can only stop existing. We had too many gods, so Athila, the goddess of knowledge, suggested only keeping one descendent from each of the gods. The one who had the most power or influence. My father is a minor god, and as such, our gifts werent great. Still, he picked me to be his only remaining child, believing the experience would strengthen my powers of loss. I lost all my family that day, as Ill never forgive my father for choosing me. She explained, wiping the tears from her eyes.
 
Dan didnt know what to say. If this was an actor hired by his sister, they were destined for greater things than standing in his kitchen. Even if he knew how stupid it sounded, he couldnt help but believe her. Im sorry.
 
As am I. Because I believe my grief created the pain that humanity feels when losing someone. My thousand years of grieving, subjected you all to the pain of loss. Without me, you wouldnt feel pain when those you lost passed.
 
Isnt pain healthy?
 
Is this healthy? She asked, gesturing to his kitchen. Before Dan could get defensive, she spoke. Youre hurting, arent you?
 
Dan sat the carton down, rubbing his forehead. Im fine. Really. It was a year ago. You need to keep pushing forward. Dont you?
 
You cant fool me with those words. Im not going to leave once I hear the lies you tell everyone else. I want the truth. How do you feel? Who did you lose?
Dan choked up, having to take a moment to compose himself. My mother. Look, Im alright. Ill clean up this mess and everything will be ok. Like a robot, Dan began pushing aside the waste, trying to find something to throw it into, only to get stopped by Obosa, who held his shoulder.
 
Youre not alright. Youre hurting. I know you know that. Its ok, you can let it out. She widened her stance, offering him a hug, only for Dan to busy himself with the mess.
 
I dont need to let it out. Ive cried enough. I need to move past it. Thats what she would want.
 
You need to grieve. Properly. Youre hurting yourself by doing this. How do you feel?
 
FINE. I FEEL FINE. WHAT? CANT YOU UNDERSTAND ENGLISH? Dan shouted, tossing a cereal box onto the floor. HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL? EMPTY. I JUST WANT HER BACK. Dans face growing hot as the salty tears pooled in his eyes. How can everyone else move on so easily
 
She pulled Dan towards her; the man letting out an ugly cry as he sobbed into the goddess. She rubbed his back, holding him as he let out his grief. Losing family is the worst pain imaginable. A severed connection that can never be replaced. A loss of shared blood. You will join with her once again, when it is your time.
 
Dan couldnt remember how long he spent crying, only that the sun was down by the time he pulled himself away from the goddess. Thank you. He said, wiping his eyes.
 
Obosa found a tissue box beneath the pile of items and plucked a tissue from it to give him. Here. Dry your tears.
 
Thank you. I know Ive been an ass. My sister was right about everything. I just couldnt stand it. Seeing her happy, it felt wrong. Like she shouldnt be moving on with her life. I knew I was wrong.
  
Now you can move forward. Obosa smiled, waving her hand as the discarded items floated towards her, getting crushed into a small golden ball. May I keep this as a memory? I want to remember helping you. I may not get more chances to help mortals. She said, feeling the emotional energy radiating from the ball. The feelings of loss, anger and despair all pulsing within.
 
Of course.
 
Thank you. You should also apologize to your sister. I would give anything to have mine back, so please, dont lose yours. She said, a sad smiled sitting on her lips as she went to teleport herself back to her realm.
 
Wait. Dan grabbed the edge of her dress, stopping her. If you ever need someone to talk to. About your grief. Will you come to me? I want to repay you for helping me.
 
The goddess paused, her smile becoming more genuine. She took his hand, clasping it within her own. I promise Ill come to you. As a blue light surrounded her, she thought more on the humans offer, and her own feelings of loss. I think Ill take you up on that offer someday. She said, vanishing before his eyes.

AO3_Amypihcs.json,10,"On a quiet autumn afternoon, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson find themselves in a playful battle of wits and tickles, as a simple conversation about oysters spirals into laughter, mischief, and declarations of love in their cozy home.","Despite what has been written, leisure was not rare in the Holmes-Watson household.
It was a calm if chilly autumn afternoon and Mr Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson, late of 221b Baker Street, London, were leisurely occupying the time before their habitual evening walk by reading together on their couch, each in pursuit of their own interests. Mr Holmes laid with his head pillowed on his partners belly and his long legs crossed, one foot braced on the armrest, reading a book regarding the various critters found in the seas and oceans while Dr Watson amused himself by reading The Lancet and caressing with a casual touch his husbands now longer, soft greying hair.
As Mr Sherlock Holmes let the book fall on his chest still open and stretched, slightly lifting his body leaning on his shoulders and foot and moaning softly, Dr Watson chuckled, bringing his hand lower to caress his high cheekbone. Has the great Sherlock Holmes tired of the creatures of the oceans? He asked playfully.
Holmes moaned again, angling his head to look his partner in the eye. Not yet.  He grinned.  Not until you will accompany me for a swim in mornings.
Both men laughed as the doctor assured his detective to be very much of a dry land creature.
Yet you are so pretty when you swim, so at ease Admired the detective, capturing his husbands hand to press a kiss on its back.
You old flatterer.  Admonished Watson playfully, kissing Holmes hand as well.  Food for thoughts?
Holmes often severe features were brightened by an impish grin. You perhaps mean case for thoughts, dear fellow.  He joked.  Im thinking of Oysters. He smirked.
Watson huffed. Really Holmes, not Oysters again, I beg of you.
Tickled by his partners slight annoyance the detective smirked and continued, a playful smile on his thin lips. But consider! Bivalves and monovalves aside, consider how pearls are made! If the seafloor were-
Dr Watson snorted again, tugging slightly at his husbands hair and interrupting him. General rehearsal for your monograph on malingering? He smiled, only half as much annoyed as he pretended to be.
Ah, you got the true strength of my acting in that case! No, no, Watson, Im considering how the layers of Mother of Pearl can cover basically anything! Continued Holmes, enthusiastically.
Dr Watson smiled and rolled up his paper to playfully tap his husband head. Are you going to claim merits as a housekeeper over getting oysters for dinner again, my love? He smiled, a hand already trailing down his husbands side.
Once he had arrived at the level of his waist, Holmes squeaked and jumped up to perch himself on the couchs armrest. Those are forbidden tactics! He laughed.
The doctor grinned back. Just as oysters are a banned topic!
Holmes grin widened. But imagine! A whole bed of oysters! Anything could get trapped by their valves! Too slow! He grinned, jumping out of the couch and on Watsons armchair to escape the playful swat with the rolled up paper!
Come down here you eel! Laughed the doctor.
Anything! Maybe so many oysters could cover a the whole floor in mother of pearl! Slow, John, slow! Grinned the detective after jumping from the armchair back to the couch and from that to his own armchair.
Watson grinned again. Im not putting any effort in this, dear husband!  He warned, then gasped as he saw his man climbing on the armchairs backrest and perching himself there.  Youre a damn squirrel!
From fish to mammal, interesting transition!  He laughed.  Imagine, a fish mistakenly entering an oyste-
As Holmes talked, his balance faltered and he fell back on the floor, right into his husbands arms.
Yes, my dear cat? A fish swimming into an oyster? Breathed the doctor right into his ear, a laugh in his voice.
He would get trapped, my love. Trapped in Mother of Pearl, fated to die and be embedded in that beautiful substance.
Dr Watson laughed, squeezing his Holmes tight. And this, my dear fish, is what happens to fishes who think themselves oh so clever. He murmured, his mouth moving on what was visible of his husbands neck to leave small kisses, his hands finding the hem of his wool vest and slipping inside it, working to tease his shirt out of his trousers.
And what would that be, my delicious bear? Grinned the detective, basking in his husbands kisses and melting in his strong hold.
Watson smiled against his Holmes neck and put there yet another kiss, careful not to leave any mark, and then as his hands finally managed to slip under his shirt. The punishment for talking of oysters, my sleuth hound. He grinned planting his fingers in the most ticklish spot of his husbands slim sides.
Holmes squeaked, curling on himself in the useless attempt to escape Watsons vice-like hold. Joooohn! John please! He yelped between laughter.
The doctor laughed together with him, holding him up in position, almost lifting him from the ground. Oh my dear, dear Sherlock.  He grinned, flexing his fingers and delighting in his husbands yowls of laughter.  You knew of the consequences, my love!","The author structures stories around intimate and playful interactions, using these moments to explore deeper emotional connections between characters.","In the story regarding ""a playful afternoon with Holmes and Watson,"" the narrative revolves around a playful exchange about oysters, leading to a physical and affectionate interaction that culminates in a tickling match and declarations of love."

It was a calm if chilly autumn afternoon and Mr Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson, late of 221b Baker Street, London, were leisurely occupying the time before their habitual evening walk by reading together on their couch, each in pursuit of their own interests. Mr Holmes laid with his head pillowed on his partners belly and his long legs crossed, one foot braced on the armrest, reading a book regarding the various critters found in the seas and oceans while Dr Watson amused himself by reading The Lancet and caressing with a casual touch his husbands now longer, soft greying hair.
As Mr Sherlock Holmes let the book fall on his chest still open and stretched, slightly lifting his body leaning on his shoulders and foot and moaning softly, Dr Watson chuckled, bringing his hand lower to caress his high cheekbone. Has the great Sherlock Holmes tired of the creatures of the oceans? He asked playfully.
Holmes moaned again, angling his head to look his partner in the eye. Not yet.  He grinned.  Not until you will accompany me for a swim in mornings.
Both men laughed as the doctor assured his detective to be very much of a dry land creature.
Yet you are so pretty when you swim, so at ease Admired the detective, capturing his husbands hand to press a kiss on its back.
You old flatterer.  Admonished Watson playfully, kissing Holmes hand as well.  Food for thoughts?
Holmes often severe features were brightened by an impish grin. You perhaps mean case for thoughts, dear fellow.  He joked.  Im thinking of Oysters. He smirked.
Watson huffed. Really Holmes, not Oysters again, I beg of you.

Dr Watson snorted again, tugging slightly at his husbands hair and interrupting him. General rehearsal for your monograph on malingering? He smiled, only half as much annoyed as he pretended to be.
Ah, you got the true strength of my acting in that case! No, no, Watson, Im considering how the layers of Mother of Pearl can cover basically anything! Continued Holmes, enthusiastically.
Dr Watson smiled and rolled up his paper to playfully tap his husband head. Are you going to claim merits as a housekeeper over getting oysters for dinner again, my love? He smiled, a hand already trailing down his husbands side.

But amidst the chaos of scrapbooks and nostalgia, they uncover more than just old cases—reminders of love, loss, and the journeys still to come.","As much as they might desire to find calm and relaxation in their retirement, both Dr Watson and Mr Holmes were keenly aware of how much work the moving would take. In view of this, they had taken their measures: Mr Holmes had moved two months earlier than the doctor, accomplishing both to give time to the doctor to say all his private goodbyes and to start preparing the cottage and roughly tidying up their belongings in smaller solutions making it much easier and much less of a gruelling job, Dr Watson visited regularly and regularly shipped parts of their things. Despite all their preparations and planning, none of them had imagined even in their worst nightmares what would have been to transport their archive.
The archive was the collection of their 20-and-change years of detective and writing activity, it was composed by the Index, the commonplace books, the scrapbooks, Watsons and Holmes separate notes on the cases and Watsons drafts and writings. It was massive.
In early march 1904, while making the plan, they decided that it would be shipped in several properly labelled trunks by Doctor Watson and left alone until the last trunk hadnt been received and only then they would re-organize it together.
It had taken five trunks filled to the brim and three weeks to ship it all and now the trunks had been sitting in their new sitting room for two weekly visits from Watson already, and, as much as the doctor put the blame of it on his husband, no jury would have declared him innocent.
It was a pleasantly warm Saturday morning toward the end of May that the two men swallowed their fear of the trunks and decided to tackle the beast.
The two of them wearing only a pair of comfortable trousers and their shirt, a pot full of black coffee and one full of tea to serve for their nerves, the bookshelves scrubbed clean of any dust and the boxes labelled and ready to be used. The detective and the doctor moved the trunks so that they could all be accessed comfortably and then set to begin.
They unloaded the first trunk completely and set to reclassify their oldest cases, Holmes sitting on the carpet and Watson organizing them in the boxes he had designed so many years earlier.
1883, Holmes. Careful, they should be ordered already. He asked, adjusting the pipe in his mouth.
They are, but you should also include the two scrapbooks of that year, I believe.  Answered the detective handing him the files of the cases while keeping the scrapbook open on his knees.  Look here, so many things. Theres a photograph of us too. He smiled.
The doctor grinned as well. Look at those young chaps, how much time it passed. Anyway, no Holmes, the scrapbooks and commonplace books go in the boxes under the shelf. First we organize the cases, then the books.
The detective laughed, dragging his husband down to steal a kiss. As captain orders.
It took them until lunchtime to organize all the cases, then after a light meal and some more coffee they set to reorganize the scrapbooks, Holmes still sitting on the carpet but the doctor relocating on the couch.
What a journey it is, Sherlock. Smiled the doctor, nostalgic.
Indeed, through time.  Purred the detective as his husband ruffled his hair even more, making some strands fall over his eyes.  Do you know this pretty chap in a military uniform? I believe he would still look dashing with it. He showed the photograph to his partner, who laughed.
Oh, I really dont believe it to be the case, my love. That chap was at least ten years younger than I am now...
But you look just as handsome now as you did back then. This goes in my private Watson folder.
Shouldnt it go on the mantel? Chuckled the doctor.
No, no. I have other photographs of yours for the mantelpiece.
Not the other ones we took in 95, I hope. He grinned.
Oh John, where you bring me in my memory. No, those are also in my private folder.
As yours are in my own. This is the 1895 one?
No, the 1886. One of the two I filled, I dont know how your photograph ended up here. I believe because we also have your photograph with your comrades from the army here, also uniformed. He showed another picture of a yet younger Watson.
So much time
As you said, a journey through memory. Lets get the 1887-8 book. Few things happened that year, I only needed one book.
Dont you have portraits of Mrs Norton? Informed himself the doctor.
No, my dear fellow. But I have yours, one photograph of you and Mrs Watson and one of us three together. You looked really handsome in that waistcoat.
As you did with that suit, my lovely. Mary was beautiful as well. Watsons sentence ended up barely louder than a whisper and the detective reached up to pat his arm in comfort.

But you look just as handsome now as you did back then. This goes in my private Watson folder.
Shouldnt it go on the mantel? Chuckled the doctor.
No, no. I have other photographs of yours for the mantelpiece.
Not the other ones we took in 95, I hope. He grinned.
Oh John, where you bring me in my memory. No, those are also in my private folder.
As yours are in my own. This is the 1895 one?
No, the 1886. One of the two I filled, I dont know how your photograph ended up here. I believe because we also have your photograph with your comrades from the army here, also uniformed. He showed another picture of a yet younger Watson.
So much time
As you said, a journey through memory. Lets get the 1887-8 book. Few things happened that year, I only needed one book.
Dont you have portraits of Mrs Norton? Informed himself the doctor.
No, my dear fellow. But I have yours, one photograph of you and Mrs Watson and one of us three together. You looked really handsome in that waistcoat.
As you did with that suit, my lovely. Mary was beautiful as well. Watsons sentence ended up barely louder than a whisper and the detective reached up to pat his arm in comfort.
She was, beloved. She truly was.
Its how these journeys are, is it not? Beautiful stretches and some less pleasant ones.
Indeed. We should have a trip, my love. A grand tour after we retire. Proposed Holmes.
Around the world?""
""Indeed. I should like to visit India with you.
Then lets finish this journey, lets move properly and then let us set for a less metaphorical one.
Its a beautiful plan, my love. I like it. Laughed the detective.
Watson smiled, then sighed, determined. Now lets start again with the work, my love. We need to finish, so we can spend tomorrow lazying in bed.
You scintillate today, my dear fellow! Yet another excellent plan. Grinned Holmes, making Watson laugh.","The author employs a conversational and informal tone, using dialogue to convey character dynamics and emotional depth.","In the story regarding ""Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson organizing their case files and uncovering memories of love and loss,"" the dialogue is casual and intimate, with lines like, ""You scintillate today, my dear fellow!

AO3_Kyu_Q_999.json,6,"In a quiet hut on the borders of a dangerous realm, two warriors find solace in each other's company, weaving tales of heroism and love as the firelight dances—until the shadows outside begin to stir.","Under the soft glow of the hearth fire in their cozy hut on the borders of Doriath, Beleg and Trin once more found solace and comfort in each other's presence, as they often did when the world did not demand their attention. The flames cast dancing shadows across the room, creating an ambiance of warmth and intimacy.
Trin sat cross-legged on the rug before the hearth, his back propped against a stack of cushions, his eyes fixed on the flickering flames. Beleg was sprawled out beside him, his head resting in Trin's lap. His silvery hair, a stark contrast to the rich tones of the rug, flowed like a river of moonlight.
Trin's fingers idly traced patterns through Beleg's hair, combing through the silken strands. It was a soothing ritual, one that had become second nature to them. Beleg closed his eyes, a contented sigh escaping his lips as he relished in the sensation.
The night beyond the windows was cold and dark, but within their hut, a cocoon of warmth and affection enveloped them. The hearth crackled and popped, radiating a gentle heat that banished the chill from the room.
""Tell me a story,"" Trin whispered, his voice soft like the rustling leaves in a gentle breeze. ""Please?""
Beleg's lips curved into a smile even though his eyes remained closed. ""Very well. What kind of story would you like to hear tonight, my love?""
Trin's fingers continued their rhythmic dance through Beleg's hair as he contemplated. ""Tell me of a great adventure, one where heroes rise against insurmountable odds.""
""So it shall be,"" Beleg began, his voice a soothing murmur. ""Once upon a time, in a land not so different from our own, there lived a valiant hero named Trin. He was known throughout the realm for his bravery and unyielding spirit, even though he was a bit stubborn and reckless.""
Trin chuckled softly. ""Go on.""
""Yet, even the bravest of heroes have their moments of doubt,"" Beleg continued. ""And so it was that Trin found himself facing a formidable foe, a dragon of immense size and power.""
Trin's fingers stilled in Beleg's hair, his eyes focused on the imaginary world his lover was weaving with his words. ""How did he defeat the dragon?""
""Ah, patience. That is the heart of the tale,"" Beleg replied. ""Trin knew that he could not conquer the dragon through strength alone. So, he embarked on a quest to find the dragon's secret weakness, a vulnerability that even the mightiest of beasts possessed.""
As Beleg's storytelling continued, the room seemed to fade away, and Trin found himself immersed in the adventure. He listened with rapt attention, his mind painting vivid images of the hero's journey, the dragon, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil.
Outside, the wind whispered secrets to the trees, but within their hut, Beleg's voice was the only sound that mattered. The flames in the hearth danced to the rhythm of the story, casting ever-shifting shadows on the walls.
As Beleg's tale neared its conclusion, Trin felt a profound sense of contentment wash over him. The world beyond their walls could be chaotic and unforgiving, but here, in their little haven, it wouldnt reach them.
""And so,"" Beleg concluded, ""Trin, armed with the knowledge of the dragon's weakness, faced the beast one final time. He waited for a fortunate moment to strike and, with a heart full of courage and determination, he struck true and thus brought an end to the reign of terror.""
Trin smiled down at Beleg, his heart filled with admiration and love. ""Thank you for this story. Though I think it would do Trin good if he had someone to rely on by his side, perhaps someone called Beleg?""
Beleg opened his eyes and gazed at Trin with a tender expression, though worry was beginning to creep in. ""Then you might as well make this story a future prediction. We do not know if or when Morgoth will let his worms loose against us.""
Leaning down, Trin captured Beleg's lips in a gentle kiss, a testament to the love that bound them together. Their lips met with a soft and lingering sweetness, like the taste of honey on a crisp autumn morning.
""Then we will meet those creatures head on and rise triumphant, just how the hero in your story did,"" Trin whispered against his lover's lips.
As they pulled away, Trin settled back against the cushions, his fingers resuming their gentle caresses through Beleg's hair. The fire continued to burn brightly, casting a warm and inviting glow over their sanctuary.
Finally, another undisturbed evening that was theirs alone to enjoy.","The author often structures narratives around intimate, character-driven moments rather than external conflict.","In the story of warriors finding solace at the edge of danger, the plot centers on Beleg and Túrin sharing a quiet evening, with the focus on their storytelling and emotional connection rather than any immediate external threat."

AO3_Kyu_Q_999.json,7,"An elf craftsman sees only light and purity in the being he loves, unaware of the darkness hidden beneath. What happens when devotion meets deception, and the lines between truth and illusion begin to blur?","Annatar stood motionless in the center of their chambers, his sharp eyes fixed on Celebrimbor as the elf moved with careful precision. The Lord of Eregion, ever the artisan, fussed over him with an artists devotion. His deft hands worked as though Annatar were the finest creation Celebrimbor had ever crafted.
The robe that Celebrimbor had chosen for him was white, the purest shade of ivory, embroidered with intricate gold thread that shimmered with every shift of light. The golden patterns traced delicate paths along the sleeves, cuffs, and collar - patterns that Celebrimbor had designed specifically for him. It felt like being cloaked in sunlight, radiant and resplendent. The stark contrast of white and gold against his skin was deliberate, no doubt. Celebrimbors vision of him, made manifest.
Celebrimbor knelt in front of him, adjusting the robe, pulling the fabric tight before stepping back to admire his work.
Beautiful, he murmured as he took Annatars hand, slowly sliding a golden ring onto his finger - one he had forged himself, as always. Annatars gaze shifted downward, watching those gentle, reverent hands as they moved to adorn him with the finest of Celebrimbors jewellery.
More golden rings, each delicate yet powerful, slipped onto his fingers, their metal cool at first, then warming against his skin. Bracelets followed, the slight clink of metal-on-metal filling the room as they rested perfectly around his wrists.
Celebrimbors fingers grazed his skin as he adjusted each piece of jewellery with meticulous care, tracing the lines of his palm, before he lifted his hands to his lips. A soft kiss, reverent - his face alight with the quiet satisfaction of a craftsman. He wasnt just dressing Annatar. No, to him, this was something more profound - an act of adoration. So beautiful, so pure, Celebrimbor murmured, almost absentmindedly as if it were a fact, not an observation.
Annatar almost flinched, but he schooled his features into a soft smile instead, letting Celebrimbors words wash over him.
Pure.
Celebrimbor said it with such certainty, with such love, that Annatar felt a painful pang in his chest.
Celebrimbors eyes, those eyes full of love and admiration, gazed upon him as though he were some sacred being. A being of light and goodness.
He wanted to believe it. He wanted to believe for just a moment that he
was
the being Celebrimbor saw - a radiant Maia of golden light, of beauty, of creation. But beneath the layers of fabric and gentle touches lay the truth that neither of them could escape. Mairon was long gone, twisted into something darker, something more ruthless. Annatar, this beautiful faade, was nothing more than a vessel for his plans.
But Celebrimbor - Celebrimbor saw none of that. His grey eyes were soft with affection as he lifted another piece of jewellery, a golden bracelet, and fastened it around Annatars wrist. His hands were steady, as though every movement was part of some sacred ritual. It almost felt like worship, the way Celebrimbor handled him. As if Annatar were something holy, something worthy of reverence.
And Annatar, in his weakness, found himself craving more of it.
Tyelpe, he said softly, his voice steady yet touched by something unspoken. You flatter me too much.
Not enough, I think, Celebrimbor replied with a small smile, stepping behind him now, his fingers combing carefully through Annatars golden hair, untangling each strand. It was a tenderness that caught Annatar off guard, even now. He felt the reverence in every movement, the soft hum of concentration that always accompanied Celebrimbor when he was working on something precious.
And Annatar - Sauron, Mairon, a dark lord hiding in plain sight -
felt
precious under those hands.
It was a ridiculous notion, of course. How could he, who had once sworn himself to Melkor, feel anything other than the heavy burden of his own betrayal, the weight of his corrupted power? But here, in Celebrimbors presence, in the Lord of Eregions deft, tender care, Annatar almost forgot.
Almost.
Hold still, Celebrimbor murmured, his voice soft with affection. He carefully smoothed the final strands of Annatars hair into place, his fingers lingering for just a moment longer than necessary, as if savoring the feeling of his golden locks on his fingers.
Annatar closed his eyes for a brief moment, allowing himself the luxury of leaning into Celebrimbors touch. For this one moment, he could be Mairon again, the Maia of Aul, the one who crafted wonders of fire, metal and gemstone. In this moment, with Celebrimbor gently adorning him, he could believe he was still that being of light, untouched by shadow.
He opened his eyes again when he felt the cool weight of a circlet being placed upon his brow. Gold, of course, delicately wrought with Elven designs and set with a single, brilliant gem in the center. Celebrimbor adjusted it slightly, then stood back, his gaze appraising, his lips curving into a look of quiet satisfaction.
There, Celebrimbor said softly, stepping aside to let Annatar see his reflection in the tall mirror before them. Perfect.
Annatar turned his head slowly, eyes drawn to the figure in the glass. For a moment, he didnt recognize the reflection. The being staring back at him was resplendent in light and purity, his golden hair catching the golden light of day, the whites and golds of his attire glowing like the sun itself. He looked every inch the Maia he had once been under Auls guidance - bright, radiant, and untarnished by the darkness that had consumed him.
For the briefest of moments, he saw Mairon in the reflection - shining, unmarred, brilliant with the light of the Valar. The one who had not yet fallen. The Maia who had forged wonders, who had sung the songs of creation with fire in his veins. The fire of the forge burned in his eyes, the passion for creation and beauty that had once driven him.
And beside him stood Celebrimbor, his Lord, his artist - his other half.
But the moment passed, and the image before him felt like a cruel illusion. He was no longer Mairon, no longer the pure, shining Maia. His heart, twisted and blackened by his time under Melkor, would never again be as Celebrimbor saw it. The radiance in the mirror was a lie.
Yet, Celebrimbor looked at him as if he were still that Maia of fire and song.
Do you like it? He asked, his voice soft with affection, his hands resting gently on Annatars shoulders as he admired his work in the mirror.
Annatar swallowed hard, his throat tightening as he tore his gaze from his reflection in the mirror and looked instead at Celebrimbor's. The elf was smiling at him, that soft, affectionate smile that always made Annatars heart clench in ways he wished it wouldnt.
He believes it, Annatar thought bitterly. Celebrimbor truly believed that Annatar was this being of purity and light. He had no idea of the darkness that lurked beneath the surface, the corruption that had twisted his soul beyond repair.
Annatar forced a smile, his heart heavy with the weight of the deception. I do, he replied quietly, his fingers brushing against the golden rings adorning his hands. Youve made me look wonderful ethereal even, He hesitated, searching for the right words. Youve made me look like the being I remember myself to be.
Celebrimbor pressed a gentle kiss to the side of his neck, resting his chin on Annatars shoulder. You are that being, he whispered, his voice full of love and conviction. You are more than you know, and more than you let yourself believe.
Annatar closed his eyes, a knot tightening in his chest. He wanted to believe it. He wanted to believe that the darkness hadnt fully consumed him, that light could still exist within him. But he knew the truth. He was plotting Eregion's downfall, after all.
He wasnt Mairon anymore. And this - this happiness with Celebrimbor - was as fragile as the delicate circlet resting on his brow.
Annatar leaned into Celebrimbors touch, the warmth of the elfs hands grounding him in the moment, even as his mind wrestled with the darker truths he kept hidden. For now, he would let himself believe the lie. For now, he would let Celebrimbors love make him feel whole.
He smiled again, more genuinely this time, as he turned to face Celebrimbor. ""I am fortunate,"" he murmured, his voice low and filled with a tenderness he rarely allowed himself to show. Fortunate to have you, Tyelpe.
Celebrimbors eyes softened, and he pulled Annatar close, his hands resting lightly against the Maias back. No, Celebrimbor whispered, pressing a kiss to his lips, soft and full of promise. It is I who am fortunate.
As he pulled away, Annatars heart twisted painfully in his chest as he stared at the elf who loved him so fiercely, so completely. At least for now, he would try to be the being Celebrimbor saw in him.
And as Celebrimbor led him away from the mirror, speaking enthusiastically about a new project he had in mind, Annatar cast one last glance at his reflection.
The golden Maia in the mirror smiled back at him, radiant and pure.
But the shadow lurking beneath his skin remained.","The author often employs a reflective and introspective narrative structure, focusing on the internal conflicts of characters.","In the story regarding ""an elf craftsman who sees only light and purity in the being he loves,"" the narrative is deeply introspective, with Annatar reflecting on his dual identity and the deception he maintains with Celebrimbor."

What happens when devotion meets deception, and the lines between truth and illusion begin to blur?","Annatar stood motionless in the center of their chambers, his sharp eyes fixed on Celebrimbor as the elf moved with careful precision. The Lord of Eregion, ever the artisan, fussed over him with an artists devotion. His deft hands worked as though Annatar were the finest creation Celebrimbor had ever crafted.
The robe that Celebrimbor had chosen for him was white, the purest shade of ivory, embroidered with intricate gold thread that shimmered with every shift of light. The golden patterns traced delicate paths along the sleeves, cuffs, and collar - patterns that Celebrimbor had designed specifically for him. It felt like being cloaked in sunlight, radiant and resplendent. The stark contrast of white and gold against his skin was deliberate, no doubt. Celebrimbors vision of him, made manifest.
Celebrimbor knelt in front of him, adjusting the robe, pulling the fabric tight before stepping back to admire his work.
Beautiful, he murmured as he took Annatars hand, slowly sliding a golden ring onto his finger - one he had forged himself, as always. Annatars gaze shifted downward, watching those gentle, reverent hands as they moved to adorn him with the finest of Celebrimbors jewellery.
More golden rings, each delicate yet powerful, slipped onto his fingers, their metal cool at first, then warming against his skin. Bracelets followed, the slight clink of metal-on-metal filling the room as they rested perfectly around his wrists.
Celebrimbors fingers grazed his skin as he adjusted each piece of jewellery with meticulous care, tracing the lines of his palm, before he lifted his hands to his lips. A soft kiss, reverent - his face alight with the quiet satisfaction of a craftsman. He wasnt just dressing Annatar. No, to him, this was something more profound - an act of adoration. So beautiful, so pure, Celebrimbor murmured, almost absentmindedly as if it were a fact, not an observation.
Annatar almost flinched, but he schooled his features into a soft smile instead, letting Celebrimbors words wash over him.

He smiled again, more genuinely this time, as he turned to face Celebrimbor. ""I am fortunate,"" he murmured, his voice low and filled with a tenderness he rarely allowed himself to show. Fortunate to have you, Tyelpe.
Celebrimbors eyes softened, and he pulled Annatar close, his hands resting lightly against the Maias back. No, Celebrimbor whispered, pressing a kiss to his lips, soft and full of promise. It is I who am fortunate.
As he pulled away, Annatars heart twisted painfully in his chest as he stared at the elf who loved him so fiercely, so completely. At least for now, he would try to be the being Celebrimbor saw in him.
And as Celebrimbor led him away from the mirror, speaking enthusiastically about a new project he had in mind, Annatar cast one last glance at his reflection.
The golden Maia in the mirror smiled back at him, radiant and pure.

AO3_Kyu_Q_999.json,7,"An elf craftsman sees only light and purity in the being he loves, unaware of the darkness hidden beneath. What happens when devotion meets deception, and the lines between truth and illusion begin to blur?","Annatar stood motionless in the center of their chambers, his sharp eyes fixed on Celebrimbor as the elf moved with careful precision. The Lord of Eregion, ever the artisan, fussed over him with an artists devotion. His deft hands worked as though Annatar were the finest creation Celebrimbor had ever crafted.
The robe that Celebrimbor had chosen for him was white, the purest shade of ivory, embroidered with intricate gold thread that shimmered with every shift of light. The golden patterns traced delicate paths along the sleeves, cuffs, and collar - patterns that Celebrimbor had designed specifically for him. It felt like being cloaked in sunlight, radiant and resplendent. The stark contrast of white and gold against his skin was deliberate, no doubt. Celebrimbors vision of him, made manifest.
Celebrimbor knelt in front of him, adjusting the robe, pulling the fabric tight before stepping back to admire his work.
Beautiful, he murmured as he took Annatars hand, slowly sliding a golden ring onto his finger - one he had forged himself, as always. Annatars gaze shifted downward, watching those gentle, reverent hands as they moved to adorn him with the finest of Celebrimbors jewellery.
More golden rings, each delicate yet powerful, slipped onto his fingers, their metal cool at first, then warming against his skin. Bracelets followed, the slight clink of metal-on-metal filling the room as they rested perfectly around his wrists.
Celebrimbors fingers grazed his skin as he adjusted each piece of jewellery with meticulous care, tracing the lines of his palm, before he lifted his hands to his lips. A soft kiss, reverent - his face alight with the quiet satisfaction of a craftsman. He wasnt just dressing Annatar. No, to him, this was something more profound - an act of adoration. So beautiful, so pure, Celebrimbor murmured, almost absentmindedly as if it were a fact, not an observation.
Annatar almost flinched, but he schooled his features into a soft smile instead, letting Celebrimbors words wash over him.
Pure.
Celebrimbor said it with such certainty, with such love, that Annatar felt a painful pang in his chest.
Celebrimbors eyes, those eyes full of love and admiration, gazed upon him as though he were some sacred being. A being of light and goodness.
He wanted to believe it. He wanted to believe for just a moment that he
was
the being Celebrimbor saw - a radiant Maia of golden light, of beauty, of creation. But beneath the layers of fabric and gentle touches lay the truth that neither of them could escape. Mairon was long gone, twisted into something darker, something more ruthless. Annatar, this beautiful faade, was nothing more than a vessel for his plans.
But Celebrimbor - Celebrimbor saw none of that. His grey eyes were soft with affection as he lifted another piece of jewellery, a golden bracelet, and fastened it around Annatars wrist. His hands were steady, as though every movement was part of some sacred ritual. It almost felt like worship, the way Celebrimbor handled him. As if Annatar were something holy, something worthy of reverence.
And Annatar, in his weakness, found himself craving more of it.
Tyelpe, he said softly, his voice steady yet touched by something unspoken. You flatter me too much.
Not enough, I think, Celebrimbor replied with a small smile, stepping behind him now, his fingers combing carefully through Annatars golden hair, untangling each strand. It was a tenderness that caught Annatar off guard, even now. He felt the reverence in every movement, the soft hum of concentration that always accompanied Celebrimbor when he was working on something precious.
And Annatar - Sauron, Mairon, a dark lord hiding in plain sight -
felt
precious under those hands.
It was a ridiculous notion, of course. How could he, who had once sworn himself to Melkor, feel anything other than the heavy burden of his own betrayal, the weight of his corrupted power? But here, in Celebrimbors presence, in the Lord of Eregions deft, tender care, Annatar almost forgot.
Almost.
Hold still, Celebrimbor murmured, his voice soft with affection. He carefully smoothed the final strands of Annatars hair into place, his fingers lingering for just a moment longer than necessary, as if savoring the feeling of his golden locks on his fingers.
Annatar closed his eyes for a brief moment, allowing himself the luxury of leaning into Celebrimbors touch. For this one moment, he could be Mairon again, the Maia of Aul, the one who crafted wonders of fire, metal and gemstone. In this moment, with Celebrimbor gently adorning him, he could believe he was still that being of light, untouched by shadow.
He opened his eyes again when he felt the cool weight of a circlet being placed upon his brow. Gold, of course, delicately wrought with Elven designs and set with a single, brilliant gem in the center. Celebrimbor adjusted it slightly, then stood back, his gaze appraising, his lips curving into a look of quiet satisfaction.
There, Celebrimbor said softly, stepping aside to let Annatar see his reflection in the tall mirror before them. Perfect.
Annatar turned his head slowly, eyes drawn to the figure in the glass. For a moment, he didnt recognize the reflection. The being staring back at him was resplendent in light and purity, his golden hair catching the golden light of day, the whites and golds of his attire glowing like the sun itself. He looked every inch the Maia he had once been under Auls guidance - bright, radiant, and untarnished by the darkness that had consumed him.
For the briefest of moments, he saw Mairon in the reflection - shining, unmarred, brilliant with the light of the Valar. The one who had not yet fallen. The Maia who had forged wonders, who had sung the songs of creation with fire in his veins. The fire of the forge burned in his eyes, the passion for creation and beauty that had once driven him.
And beside him stood Celebrimbor, his Lord, his artist - his other half.
But the moment passed, and the image before him felt like a cruel illusion. He was no longer Mairon, no longer the pure, shining Maia. His heart, twisted and blackened by his time under Melkor, would never again be as Celebrimbor saw it. The radiance in the mirror was a lie.
Yet, Celebrimbor looked at him as if he were still that Maia of fire and song.
Do you like it? He asked, his voice soft with affection, his hands resting gently on Annatars shoulders as he admired his work in the mirror.
Annatar swallowed hard, his throat tightening as he tore his gaze from his reflection in the mirror and looked instead at Celebrimbor's. The elf was smiling at him, that soft, affectionate smile that always made Annatars heart clench in ways he wished it wouldnt.
He believes it, Annatar thought bitterly. Celebrimbor truly believed that Annatar was this being of purity and light. He had no idea of the darkness that lurked beneath the surface, the corruption that had twisted his soul beyond repair.
Annatar forced a smile, his heart heavy with the weight of the deception. I do, he replied quietly, his fingers brushing against the golden rings adorning his hands. Youve made me look wonderful ethereal even, He hesitated, searching for the right words. Youve made me look like the being I remember myself to be.
Celebrimbor pressed a gentle kiss to the side of his neck, resting his chin on Annatars shoulder. You are that being, he whispered, his voice full of love and conviction. You are more than you know, and more than you let yourself believe.
Annatar closed his eyes, a knot tightening in his chest. He wanted to believe it. He wanted to believe that the darkness hadnt fully consumed him, that light could still exist within him. But he knew the truth. He was plotting Eregion's downfall, after all.
He wasnt Mairon anymore. And this - this happiness with Celebrimbor - was as fragile as the delicate circlet resting on his brow.
Annatar leaned into Celebrimbors touch, the warmth of the elfs hands grounding him in the moment, even as his mind wrestled with the darker truths he kept hidden. For now, he would let himself believe the lie. For now, he would let Celebrimbors love make him feel whole.

Nico raised an eyebrow. Really? Its just mushing faces together. I think I did pretty good.
You did amazing, Will confirmed. But theres other stuff too.
He shuffled closer, gazing into Nicos wide eyes. He raised his hands to cup Nicos face and tuck that bit of loose hair behind his ear.

Will, have you ever kissed someone?
There was silence. Will could feel his cheeks turning bright red.
Yes, he answered somewhat hesitantly. Looking deep in thought, Nico nodded.

Despite how unfazed Nico looked by all this, Will was rivalling a tomato. Teach?
Ive always been curious as to like... how you do it, Nico continued. And youre my best friend so obviously you are my go to.
Best friend, Will repeated in his head. Just friends helping out friends. Buddies being buddies. His heart sank just a little but he smiled and went to sit on Nicos bed with his legs crossed. Nico did the same and sat opposite him.
Okay, well, Will fumbled around for the words. Lets start with the basics. Pouting lips. You know about that, right?
Nicos head tilted to one side like an adorably confused animal.
Its where you go like this. Will made a kissing face as best he could. Nico snorted.
You look like a duck.
Well then I know better to help you out in the future.
Nico grabbed Wills arms. Wait, Im sorry. Youre a very handsome duck.
He dropped Wills arms and mimicked the face.

And dont they bite each other too? Eat each other?
Will howled with laughter, rolling onto his side and clutching his stomach. Nico couldnt help but smile at the sight.
What? What did I say?
Will sat back up, a hand over his mouth to cover his laughter.
One last question, I promise, Nico implored. What do you do with your eyes?
You shut them, Will said. He closed his eyes for demonstration. When he opened them, Nico nodded thoughtfully.

The Gospel reading at supper, delivered as always by Brother Tancred, was recognizable to the educated among them as the temptation of Jesus in the desert and the calling of the Apostle Peter. Those who had not learned Latin still recognized the oft-cited words: *Poenitentiam agite: appropinquavit enim regnum caelorum.* Do penance: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. At supper's end, they made their way to the Master's council room, down a windowless corridor that led mostly to storage vaults. The door had been left open, revealing sparse furnishings: a long, plain table with wooden benches-- a fireplace in which someone had prepared a steady blaze prior to their arrival-- a stone relief of the Order's emblem, two knights riding a single horse, adorning the wall-- and three chests set against the far wall. Each chest bore the privileged device to which none of them were entitled: a lock. None of ""them""? It appeared that the summons given to each man had gone to others as well. Who was the Master gathering here-- allies, accusers? To what purpose? And how were they to conduct themselves as they awaited his arrival?","The author employs a formal and reflective tone, using dialogue to convey deep philosophical and moral themes.","In the story regarding ""Templar knights summoned to a council room with locked chests and a blazing fire,"" the language is formal and contemplative, as seen in lines like, ""The Lord understands the value of men, brother. And we have too few,"" which reflect the weighty themes of duty and sacrifice."

Breakfast had been scrambled eggs, toast, orange juice, and oatmeal, as usual-- with the addition of bacon. Real, honest-to-God bacon that had once been part of a pig.

After breakfast, the topic of the community discussion group had been Creatively Resolving Conflicts... again. Araceli was one of the more 'permanent' residents at Whistler-Down. In the women's ward, only Grace had been around longer than she had, as far as she could tell. Grace was constantly dozing off, thanks to whatever medication they'd put her on. It was hard to get her to stay awake long enough to have a sustained conversation. Creatively Resolving Conflicts was one of the more engaging workshops, at least. The facilitator had brought in cue cards for role-playing exercises, which was always entertaining. The Saturday wasn't off to a bad start. According to the clock in the common room, it was 9:30. Araceli had to wait until 9:32 for Jim to come find her. Jim was one of the younger orderlies. He performed his duties with briskness and avoided eye contact with most patients when he did. It was apparent that whatever he'd once envisioned for his life, Whistler-Down hadn't been part of the plan. It was the usual Saturday morning for him: his eyes were watery and bloodshot, and he dragged himself through the hallways as if Grace had lent him some of her meds. ""Ara, doctor's check,"" Jim slurred. He followed her at a perfunctory distance until they reached Dr. Janus' office. His hand fumbled at the doorknob for just a moment, as if he'd misjudged the distance. Ara felt the quick glance he shot at her, baleful with the spiderweb-fissures of veins in his eyes. It didn't really matter if she noticed the slip-up-- as one of the longer-term patients and a persona non grata to the outside world, her judgments didn't count for much. But he still had the instinct to check. Jim opened the door. Dr. Benjamin Janus sat inside, the light of the sunny Saturday morning illuminating him like a muted halo. This was the most tranquil space in the entire hospital, with leather couches, soft rugs, bright cheery plants near the windows, and paintings in warm and vibrant colors. Dr. Janus looked up from his papers. ""Ara!"" he called out with a smile. ""Come on in."" His eyes shifted to Jim. The two men shared a nod. Jim shot a sullen look at Ara before shuffling off. Ara closed the door behind her and took the patient's customary seat on the brown leather couch. On mornings past, an orderly had needed to accompany her into the office and occupied the other end of the couch. With only her and the doctor in the room, the room felt freer, as if there were more air to breathe. The psychiatrist pushed some papers to the side of his desk and turned his full attention to Ara.

It was too early for customers. Front *or* back ones... He walked out through the back door and peeked around the corner, leaning his forearms on the door frame. Oh. It was only *Leon*...again. What a surprise! ""Oy!"", Nate called out to him, ""Freeloader! Stop messin' with my trash cans and make yerself useful, yes? Might score ya a free coffee and muffin!"" Nate tossed Leon a broom. ""Go sweep the front. Look pretty."", with a grin and a wink, Nate disappeared back inside. As Nate joined his team up front in opening the cafe, Sonya gave their boss a weary look. ""How many *narcos* we get zis time, Gray?"", she said with a raised eyebrow as Stevie took his rightful place at the register. ""With *my* luck?"", Nate looked over as he perched on one of the back tables while picking at a freshly made muffin, ""The whole bloody *lot* of 'em!"" ----------------- ## Meanwhile in Kyoto, Japan. ## High up in a secluded temple. [**Leo**]( the current leader of The Ministry, soundlessly took a seat on the floor next to his sensei. ""She *will* be a part of us once again, Sensei. That I assure you. And the weapon will be passed on to its *rightful* owner. But it will not be an easy task."", Leo spoke quietly with his eyes closed, keeping to the same quiet and meditative atmosphere as his master. ""Nothing is ever absolute"", came the answer from the old man, ""But there is something to easy your path, something that could...guide your way in your endeavors. That sword, it is not without a partner. *Yin and yang*. There exists another weapon. A sword of *light* to balance out the dark. An opposite to *Life Drainer*."" Leo tensed up but did not let his surprise show any further than that. He remained silent as the sensei gave a smile. ""In time, my student, you will learn all that you need to know."" --- *edit: Leo's pic changed.*","The author often employs a conversational and informal narrative voice, using colloquial language and direct address to engage the reader.","In the story regarding ""a quirky café doubling as a front for illicit dealings and a mysterious figure searching for a legendary weapon,"" the dialogue includes phrases like ""Oy! Freeloader!"" and ""Why do I bozer?"" which contribute to a lighthearted and comedic atmosphere."

Claudia raised a fist, prepared to give it a knock, when she heard the familiar green-lit buzzing coming from her left.

What could possibly go wrong?","#Chapter 1: ##Customer Satisfaction Or 0 Days Without Sexual Harassment ###*(as narrated by Samuel L. Jackson)* There is nothing worse on Gods green Earth than a cold-ass Monday morning in the city. Everyone rushing to work or from night shifts or to school, everyone wanting to get the day started so it can already be over. Everyone being a *bitch* and a *cunt* to one another to get the last seat on the subway or be the first in line...and *no one* wanting to deal with those fuckers they have to be constantly surrounded by; the *other people*. But the thing about Mondays, is that even the smallest of things can make those horrible, terrible days of the week feel *just* a little better. And thats free fucking coffee. And not just *any* free fucking coffee from a mass-produced, ass-tasting barrel! No sir! Free *custom* made coffee with a fresh from the oven muffin in a warm and toasty coffee shop that lookswell, almost like Starbucks underachieving, slightly retarded brother that everyone praises for tying his shoes in the morning. I admit, its not the best coffee shop in the world, but ya gotta give 'em credit for trying. *Coffee Nutz*, originally the brain child of an NYU hipster who needed something more in life than a twenty-thousand-dollar piece of laminated paper, has grown quite a bit in its three whole years of existence. They have a total of three locations in the city; Uptown, Midtown, and Downtown, and have already partnered up with as many start-up businesses as you can think of. Uber, Yelp, Foursquareyou name it and you can *bet* someone was fucked on some couch in an office for it. However, since business wasnt exactly a boomin the owner decided to do a little Monday morning experiment to drum up some attention. **For today only**, all three of his locations would offer their products for free. And the Midtown location, just five blocks south of Central Park, is where *this* particular story is set. --- Now lets meet some of the players, shall we? First and foremost, the direct contact to the boss and the barista whos been there from day one; Chester. Chesters a curious sort. He was the first one to apply to a teeny coffee shop on the second floor of an equally as teeny adult book store, and even as that teeny coffee shop grew and grew and eventually expanded *into* the teeny adult book store, taking up both floors of the building, Chester has stayed the barista and sort of a team lead, for all of those three years. Never asking for a raise, or better hours, or seeking a promotion. For some inexplicable reason he just seemed to really love his job. It was still too early for Coffee Nutz to have many coffee-loving customers around, but it was a good sign already that people were lining up past the bakery counter. Chester was smiling -grinning- at a woman across from him dressed in a sleek business suit with a tightly pulled back bun on her head, chatting without breath into the outdated Bluetooth on her ear. Hi! Welcome to Coffee Nutz, where were all just *nuts* about coffee! Eheh... Today all the coffee is free, so what would you like to order? The woman, seeming to stare straight at Chester and yet managing to ignore him completely, said to no one in particular, Uh-huh yeah. Papers on my desk by lunchtime. Noby *brunch* time, got that? Write that down, write down brunch time. What? Ohum, medium half-caf latte, skim milk, *no* sugar, please. You said its free...? Chester gave a nod, the smile never leaving his face, as he picked up a cup to write down the order on it, Well technically the only price is a hug but we dont charge any tax for hugs Hold on, Susan, the woman suddenly interrupted both Chester and Susan on the other line, Theres some coffee clerk in here sexually harassing me, quick call to my lawyer, Im gonna have to call you back. --Now, what did you say your name was, sir? Chester stopped writing, marker and cup hovering in the air, and looked over at her slightly paled. He glanced left and right before slowly starting to answer, Ah.my.*my* name, huh? My name is uh.M..Martin. Martin Shshort. Martin Short? Your name tag says Chester. What is your last name Chester?, the woman continued calmly as if this was a daily occurrence for her. Chester took a breath, turning it into a small laugh as he passed the empty cup to Willow, the only other barista behind the counter, Ahthank you for your order! Please step down to the pick-up counter and well get that right out for ya As Chester desperately busied himself with the next customer, the woman stepped over, leaning over the counter to watch Willow work on her coffee with judgmental intensity. As if studying the girls every move, finger hovering over her phone, ready to sue anyone for the littlest thing. Um, can Iplease get a different cup? I think that coffee clerk might have *dirtied* that one. *Thank you*!, the business woman chimed at Willow before taking another call on her Bluetooth again. --- Meanwhile, the business bitch wasnt the only rude customer on a phone in that coffee shop. A little further down the line of people, stood a big man in an equally as expensive suit with rings peppering his fingers and a chain around his neck. He held a phone up to his ear as he stood, from time to time checking out his big expensive watch. Well you can tell *Wallace* -verbatim- tell him I said this, tell him Im saying this *exactly*. I will *break* both his big toes and make him run, barefoot, to that Seven Eleven six blocks away to get me a twix bar. *Twix bar*, not a fucking Snickers, not those caramel peanut butter *horse cocks*, a goddamn *Twix* bar that he will pay for *out of pocket* and then run back to me *on* his broken toes. And when he gets back here with my Twix bar, tell him I will break three fingers on each of his hands and make him type up my daughters school report due tomorrow. And it better be fucking *perfect*, he better have read goddamn To Kill a Mockingbird. Because if I dont see any clear cut similarities between fucking Boo Radley and Finch in there, *then* I will shoot him in the head. Got that? You got all that? If he doesnt have the money by the time I get back, that will happen. Tell him that will happen, alright?, he hung up the phone and shook his head, speaking to whoever was in line behind him, ""Assholes, huh? No respect for ya. No ones got any respect anymore. Fuck... And as the sun was still barely peeking through the skyscrapers during this early morning and as two hapless baristas tried to serve the slowly growing number of people, more and more of our storys main characters started flooding into the coffee shop.","The author often employs a non-linear narrative structure, using character introductions and interactions to gradually build the story's conflict.","In the story of a chaotic Monday morning in a coffee shop, the narrative begins with a vivid description of the coffee shop and its free coffee offer, then shifts to introducing characters like Chester and the businesswoman, whose interactions hint at underlying tensions and conflicts."

Uber, Yelp, Foursquareyou name it and you can *bet* someone was fucked on some couch in an office for it. However, since business wasnt exactly a boomin the owner decided to do a little Monday morning experiment to drum up some attention. **For today only**, all three of his locations would offer their products for free. And the Midtown location, just five blocks south of Central Park, is where *this* particular story is set. --- Now lets meet some of the players, shall we? First and foremost, the direct contact to the boss and the barista whos been there from day one; Chester. Chesters a curious sort. He was the first one to apply to a teeny coffee shop on the second floor of an equally as teeny adult book store, and even as that teeny coffee shop grew and grew and eventually expanded *into* the teeny adult book store, taking up both floors of the building, Chester has stayed the barista and sort of a team lead, for all of those three years. Never asking for a raise, or better hours, or seeking a promotion. For some inexplicable reason he just seemed to really love his job. It was still too early for Coffee Nutz to have many coffee-loving customers around, but it was a good sign already that people were lining up past the bakery counter. Chester was smiling -grinning- at a woman across from him dressed in a sleek business suit with a tightly pulled back bun on her head, chatting without breath into the outdated Bluetooth on her ear. Hi! Welcome to Coffee Nutz, where were all just *nuts* about coffee! Eheh... Today all the coffee is free, so what would you like to order? The woman, seeming to stare straight at Chester and yet managing to ignore him completely, said to no one in particular, Uh-huh yeah. Papers on my desk by lunchtime. Noby *brunch* time, got that? Write that down, write down brunch time. What? Ohum, medium half-caf latte, skim milk, *no* sugar, please. You said its free...? Chester gave a nod, the smile never leaving his face, as he picked up a cup to write down the order on it, Well technically the only price is a hug but we dont charge any tax for hugs Hold on, Susan, the woman suddenly interrupted both Chester and Susan on the other line, Theres some coffee clerk in here sexually harassing me, quick call to my lawyer, Im gonna have to call you back. --Now, what did you say your name was, sir? Chester stopped writing, marker and cup hovering in the air, and looked over at her slightly paled. He glanced left and right before slowly starting to answer, Ah.my.*my* name, huh? My name is uh.M..Martin. Martin Shshort. Martin Short? Your name tag says Chester. What is your last name Chester?, the woman continued calmly as if this was a daily occurrence for her. Chester took a breath, turning it into a small laugh as he passed the empty cup to Willow, the only other barista behind the counter, Ahthank you for your order! Please step down to the pick-up counter and well get that right out for ya As Chester desperately busied himself with the next customer, the woman stepped over, leaning over the counter to watch Willow work on her coffee with judgmental intensity. As if studying the girls every move, finger hovering over her phone, ready to sue anyone for the littlest thing. Um, can Iplease get a different cup? I think that coffee clerk might have *dirtied* that one. *Thank you*!, the business woman chimed at Willow before taking another call on her Bluetooth again. --- Meanwhile, the business bitch wasnt the only rude customer on a phone in that coffee shop. A little further down the line of people, stood a big man in an equally as expensive suit with rings peppering his fingers and a chain around his neck. He held a phone up to his ear as he stood, from time to time checking out his big expensive watch. Well you can tell *Wallace* -verbatim- tell him I said this, tell him Im saying this *exactly*. I will *break* both his big toes and make him run, barefoot, to that Seven Eleven six blocks away to get me a twix bar. *Twix bar*, not a fucking Snickers, not those caramel peanut butter *horse cocks*, a goddamn *Twix* bar that he will pay for *out of pocket* and then run back to me *on* his broken toes. And when he gets back here with my Twix bar, tell him I will break three fingers on each of his hands and make him type up my daughters school report due tomorrow. And it better be fucking *perfect*, he better have read goddamn To Kill a Mockingbird. Because if I dont see any clear cut similarities between fucking Boo Radley and Finch in there, *then* I will shoot him in the head. Got that? You got all that? If he doesnt have the money by the time I get back, that will happen. Tell him that will happen, alright?, he hung up the phone and shook his head, speaking to whoever was in line behind him, ""Assholes, huh? No respect for ya. No ones got any respect anymore. Fuck... And as the sun was still barely peeking through the skyscrapers during this early morning and as two hapless baristas tried to serve the slowly growing number of people, more and more of our storys main characters started flooding into the coffee shop.","The author tends to create characters with exaggerated traits and quirks, using them to drive the narrative and explore themes.","In the story of a chaotic Monday morning in a coffee shop, characters like Chester, who is overly enthusiastic about his job, and the aggressive businessman, are depicted with exaggerated personalities that contribute to the chaotic and humorous atmosphere."

The city was an industrial center and clouds of smog filled the skies, giving the sky a nasty brown color, or at least orange on a good day. The market square, at the center of the harbor district would be the site of the performances for the next 4 days. It was hard to figure out how long the circus would be at any one point. The children had spent only 18 hours in Lyons and then for some reason, squatted down and put on full performances for 3 solid weeks in a little town in wine country that had fewer villagers than could possibly have been profitable.

But you didnt question the manager on such things .Menindez made you afraid to ask about what was going on, except in the odd cases where he got mad if you didnt. It was hard to peg Old Ed, as a couple of the English and American performers called Eduardo Menindez, the grizzled 65-year-old manager who could pass for 45 most of the time.

As a Mediterranean port, the city was part of the known world since before writing, and people from Africa, Asia, and all over Europe had gathered there for trade, intermingling, and at times, violence. Clara had announced that morning that England had changed its tune again and now was praising Germany to the heavens. Unfortunately, Germany had just decided that France was its closest ally. The circus had learned from her reports that the uneasy situation between the three countries changed almost every couple of weeks, though it was becoming more unstable. But life went on in Circus Europa, and the brilliant performing children were still at work preparing for the afternoons performance. Whether they worked in the sideshows, or would be in the center ring, the kids always had extensive training exercises each day and although they were paid and treated well, they were worked hard as well.

Police were always on edge here, partially because the neighborhood was very spooky, even to experienced cops, filled with the sounds of humanity and animals while they walked, nearly blind along the streets. Sometimes it was loud, and sometimes it was disturbingly quiet. Where the cops could only hear their own breathing and the clomping sound of their own bootsteps. There were the usual faire of night travelers in the Mousehole, you had the two gangs: the foxes in their red and white, and the eagles in their gold and black, women, and sometimes men, of the night, drug dealers, and what every cop learned quickly, mostly just everyday people going about their business: needing that one last thing at the store or going to see someone who could use their help. An officer got a call as he walked alongChekovsky Avenue. Theres been a fight at the Roberto Park pool, get there and put an end to it. Were running low on space in the jail tonight, so only arrest someone who really causes trouble. Came the voice of the captain Vera Fife, one of the best officers in the force. People joked that the Hispanic woman had risen through the ranks so fast because she grew tired of being called Deputy Fife, but she knew how to handle a gun and knew how to handle police work with both skill and subtlety. She gave the lone officer the directions and waited for his response, though he was already making his way towards Roberta Park.",The author uses detailed environmental descriptions to create an immersive atmosphere.,"In the story regarding ""a lone officer confronting chaos on a sweltering night in Mousehole,"" the author writes, ""The chirping of insects almost brought to a low roar by the high heat and humidity was the only natural sound,"" vividly conveying the oppressive heat and setting the mood for the narrative."

narrativemagazine_jackie_thomas-kennedy.json,1,"After the loss of her daughter, Virginia Rothery struggles to reconcile her grief with her faith, surrounded by a congregation offering comfort she’s not sure she can accept. What happens when belief collides with unbearable loss?","Raised a Jehovahs Witness, Virginia Rothery has never had a birthday cake. Today, in memoriam of her daughter, her congregation arrives with Lord and Lady Baltimores, with red velvets, black forests, and hummingbirds.
Today the Rotherys ranch house is so crowded that Roger opens every window, despite Virginias head cold. There is some debate, anyway, about whether her nose is streaming from illness or from grief.
Leslie Jean Rothery, born two weeks early, had a habit of what Roger called roughhousing. She was anemically pale. Her blond hair was thin and tentative, an afterthought of her body. At school she was called L.J. At school she was mocked for her religious principlesshe could not attend the Christmas play, she could not drop eggs in blue dye each springbut she was admired for her athleticism, which brimmed frustratingly throughout math and science, which burst beautifully in sprints and double Dutch. Roger made her learn to sew when she was nine, the last year of her life, because she tore almost all the clothing she owned. Roughhousing.
Perhaps this is how Roger remembers Leslie: foxglove blooms of blood on her elbows and knees, face contorting at the sight of fruit salad, howling when her spider costume was dismembered on the night of Halloween. Leslie had received the costume from a school friend. Clipping the acrylic legs with shears, Roger had said, Dont you understand that Halloween is a pagan practice?
No, Leslie did not understand.
As for Virginia, the only image she can recall is that of her daughter asleep and unsuspecting in the backseat of the car, a car soon to receive a heavy steel blow from a purple pickup with Idaho plates, map on the dash, its driver lostagainthis time in Lake of the Meek, Montana. A single woman still getting used to a shift stick, bleary with beer and divorce, driving straight into the intersection of Thoroughfare and Locust Road.
That wasnt the end. The ambulance, the kind paramedics, calling Leslie sweetheart, asking her questions, all of which she answered: Leslie Jean Rothery. No, my head doesnt hurt. Yes, I can lift this arm. I live at 37 Thistle Bend. Then she was out. That wasnt the end, either.
A macaroon appears with such proximity to Virginias mouth that she eats it, even though she hates coconut. All the shoes in her house glisten with cemetery mud. She cries for several minutes before Carol Truitt, one of the sisters from the congregation, comes over with a wad of tissues. The tissues must have come from Carols purse, because Virginia doesnt buy the scented pastel kind. She buys discount brands, in bulk. It is expensive to raise even one child.
When she spills sherry down the front of her dress, Virginia knows what to do: she goes to the bathroom, which is cleaner than it has ever been. The faucets sparkle in the cold sunshine. Someone washed this faucet; someone buffed the water taps. Virginia weeps in gratitude for a minute before she begins to unhook the shower curtain, thinking, Isnt this what I came in here for? On the sink, Leslies toothbrush is upside down in the holder. Virginia brings it to her lips. She brings it with her down the hall, into her bedroom, and into her bed. She waves it angrily when Carol Truitt comes in and tries to pull back the quilt.
How about a walk outside? Carol says. Some fresh air?
Virginia turns her head to look out the window, maple branches against the sky like cracks in a glazed plate.
Just a quick walk down to the lake?
No.
Carol lies down on the bed. She puts her arm around Virginias waist, bringing her frosted hair to the pillow, grains of nut from a cookie between her teeth.
Virginia surprises herself: she wants this warmth. She wants skin and breath. She allows her back to be scratched, her hair to be smoothed. She decides to be Leslie instead of herself. No one will notice.
Virginia?
I said no. Im not going outside.
I know. Then Carol says, The hardest part must be what that doctor told you.
Virginia opens her eyes, reentering the childless world, the sheets with their smell of husband, the ranch house built for four, holding fifty, soon to be holding two. The hardest part must be what the doctor told you. Of course Carol knows. The whole congregation knows that Dr. Hagan said he could help Leslie easily with a blood transfusion. With only a moments hesitation, Roger said no, handing Dr. Hagan tracts and brochures about Jehovahs Witnesses and their stance on blood. To Jehovah, blood is as loathsome as war, as untruths, as plastic spider limbs. Roger told Virginia that to allow Leslie a blood transfusion would destroy their chance for a life in paradise. He told her this in the hospital gift shop, toying with a sequined sock that Virginia recognized as a Christmas ornament. If Roger had looked at the thing in his hand he would have dropped it, and he would have washed his hands to rid them of sinful traces.
Just thank God you had her, Carol says now. Thank God you had her at all.
Yes: thank God. Thank God you have a whole congregation in your dim ranch house with a useless, empty bedroom, where you will later find Leslies hidden drawings of unicorns, which Roger disallows because they are supernormal creatures and suggest a way of thinking that supersedes Witness doctrine. Thank God you know that you will see Leslie again, you will, when she is resurrected after Armageddon, when the world returns to its original, perfect state.",The author often uses non-linear storytelling to reveal character backstories and emotional depth.,"In the story regarding ""a mother's struggle with faith after losing her daughter,"" the narrative intersperses present moments of Virginia's grief with flashbacks of her daughter Leslie's life, such as her athleticism and the Halloween incident, to build a layered understanding of her loss."

As for Virginia, the only image she can recall is that of her daughter asleep and unsuspecting in the backseat of the car, a car soon to receive a heavy steel blow from a purple pickup with Idaho plates, map on the dash, its driver lostagainthis time in Lake of the Meek, Montana.

That wasnt the end. The ambulance, the kind paramedics, calling Leslie sweetheart, asking her questions, all of which she answered: Leslie Jean Rothery. No, my head doesnt hurt. Yes, I can lift this arm. I live at 37 Thistle Bend. Then she was out. That wasnt the end, either.
A macaroon appears with such proximity to Virginias mouth that she eats it, even though she hates coconut. All the shoes in her house glisten with cemetery mud. She cries for several minutes before Carol Truitt, one of the sisters from the congregation, comes over with a wad of tissues. The tissues must have come from Carols purse, because Virginia doesnt buy the scented pastel kind. She buys discount brands, in bulk. It is expensive to raise even one child.
When she spills sherry down the front of her dress, Virginia knows what to do: she goes to the bathroom, which is cleaner than it has ever been. The faucets sparkle in the cold sunshine. Someone washed this faucet; someone buffed the water taps. Virginia weeps in gratitude for a minute before she begins to unhook the shower curtain, thinking, Isnt this what I came in here for? On the sink, Leslies toothbrush is upside down in the holder. Virginia brings it to her lips. She brings it with her down the hall, into her bedroom, and into her bed. She waves it angrily when Carol Truitt comes in and tries to pull back the quilt.
How about a walk outside? Carol says. Some fresh air?
Virginia turns her head to look out the window, maple branches against the sky like cracks in a glazed plate.
Just a quick walk down to the lake?
No.
Carol lies down on the bed. She puts her arm around Virginias waist, bringing her frosted hair to the pillow, grains of nut from a cookie between her teeth.
Virginia surprises herself: she wants this warmth. She wants skin and breath. She allows her back to be scratched, her hair to be smoothed. She decides to be Leslie instead of herself. No one will notice.
Virginia?
I said no. Im not going outside.
I know. Then Carol says, The hardest part must be what that doctor told you.
Virginia opens her eyes, reentering the childless world, the sheets with their smell of husband, the ranch house built for four, holding fifty, soon to be holding two. The hardest part must be what the doctor told you. Of course Carol knows. The whole congregation knows that Dr. Hagan said he could help Leslie easily with a blood transfusion. With only a moments hesitation, Roger said no, handing Dr. Hagan tracts and brochures about Jehovahs Witnesses and their stance on blood. To Jehovah, blood is as loathsome as war, as untruths, as plastic spider limbs. Roger told Virginia that to allow Leslie a blood transfusion would destroy their chance for a life in paradise. He told her this in the hospital gift shop, toying with a sequined sock that Virginia recognized as a Christmas ornament. If Roger had looked at the thing in his hand he would have dropped it, and he would have washed his hands to rid them of sinful traces.
Just thank God you had her, Carol says now. Thank God you had her at all.
Yes: thank God. Thank God you have a whole congregation in your dim ranch house with a useless, empty bedroom, where you will later find Leslies hidden drawings of unicorns, which Roger disallows because they are supernormal creatures and suggest a way of thinking that supersedes Witness doctrine. Thank God you know that you will see Leslie again, you will, when she is resurrected after Armageddon, when the world returns to its original, perfect state.","The author tends to reinterpret prompts by embedding them in specific cultural or religious contexts, adding depth and complexity.","In the story regarding ""a mother's struggle with faith after losing her daughter,"" the narrative is deeply rooted in the practices and beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses, such as the refusal of a blood transfusion, which adds a unique dimension to Virginia's internal conflict and grief."

narrativemagazine_tryphena_l.json,2,"After being cast out of your village for a curse you had no part in, you and your young brothers struggle to survive in the wilderness, haunted by grief, hunger, and the weight of impossible choices. One night, as the youngest crawls toward the stream, you feel the stillness of the air shift—something is coming, and it demands an answer.","He has his hands on Niis throat, and this time I do not stop them. Theyre fighting over the last sugarcane, and Nii has it held tightly between his teeth, the juice from the cane dripping down his shorts. I am more concerned about how many more days hell be wearing the shorts unwashed, with its stain, than Ayikwe choking him to death. As if trapped inside a curse, my brothers and I have, since Mothers passing, tasted famine in seasons of abundance. They call it a taboothat a woman will go into labor and lose her life, especially when the child survives. How is it possible that the same channel of life can know death? theyll say to one another. The baby must have sucked out her last breath. Sometimes theyll curse and plead their favor, Chai! Between my dead body and a cursed child, may God choose me. And hence the banishment of my family.
They did not come chasing us out of our home with machetes, as Ive been told of the past. But the signs were evident that they wanted us gone. At my kiosk in the market central, a scarecrow had been planted, its ripped white shirt besmirched with rotten tomatoes. The boys wondered why none of their friends would play with them. Once a boy in the neighborhood said Ayikwe was just a sacrificed clot of blood, and Ayikwe responded by digging his tiny fist into the boys cheek. A nightmare also kept repeating itself: that while we slept, townspeople gathered around our hut and, circling us in silence, lit a match. They set us on fire and lifted up their hands in thanksgiving. There was never smoke, just our cries filling the air. I couldnt let that happen, and so in the first week of August, we folded everything we owned, which wasnt much, into two sacks, and with a six-month-old baby strapped to my back, we made our way through the farms and into the outskirts of the village.
Nii is six and Ayikwe just turned eleven. For his birthday I read him Mothers favorite prayer, which we all know by heart, days spent kneeling on a mat speaking the words slowly, rehearsed and without meaning. He insists I read it, saying, You sound just like Ma. It is comfort.
Comforting, I say and begin to read from the back of an envelope that contains Bible verses and written prayers to God:
Lord, make me an instrument of your peace:
where there is hatred, let me sow love;
where there is injury, pardon;
where there is doubt, faith;
where there is despair, hope;
where there is darkness, light;
where there is sadness, joy.
O divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek
to be consoled as to console,
to be understood as to understand,
to be loved as to love.
For it is in giving that we receive,
it is in pardoning that we are pardoned,
and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen.
But I dont want to die, Nii says, and I smile at him, the babys head resting easy on my chest. We named him Joseph. Actually, Ayikwe did, after his favorite Bible character. I didnt object. At the time, I was spending days and nights in the clinic, signing papers I didnt understand and wishing everything to be over. It was a relief to come back home with a baby who already had a name picked out and a coat of many colors, a faded Ankara cloth my mother owned. Sometimes I wonder if Joseph will be the beam of light, the one who rises above the storm and saves us from drowning. At the back of my mind, although I resist thinking such things, I toy with the idea of selling him, although Im sure no one will pay for a wombs curse. I know Ill be sorry for harboring such thoughts. Nothing would be the same without him, but, frankly, selling him would be the best thing to happen to the boys and me. We could return home, just the three of us. I could have my kiosk in the market again and Ayikwe could grow maize on the farm. We could eat and laugh and be accepted.
You would think that by fifteen, life had dealt me enough, given me my share of its troublesleaving school to trade in the market with my mother and coming home to cook for a family, which reduced my life to servitude. And now to be responsible for my brothers lives when I can barely carry my own is something I never wanted.
Weve been in the woods twelve days. A meandering stream froths beside us. The boys have dug out groundnut and found a dead fish or two they could make nothing of. Ive eaten very little. For Joseph, I pick green leaves and grind them between my palms and force it down his mouth. He spits most of it out. I can hear the boys splashing their legs in the stream, and I allow myself to weep for the first time since everything. Its a private mourning; I grieve the loss of my mother, the cruel townspeople, and my tired heart. When the day winds down, clouds stretch above us, expanding like an inflated body. I do not know what makes me do it, but I open up the envelope and pull out a letter. It is dated January 2003. Some lines have been crossed out and some shaded deeply. I wonder what kind of prayer said to God is revocable. What happens to the receipts? We swallow back our words out of fear and like to believe God keeps no record. I cannot think of why Mother will want some prayers returned to her, but I know it is no way a lack of faith. Yet, here in these letters, she bleeds a softness Ive never known: God, life is so cursed out here. Do you hear me? The darkness comes after me and I run. Look, I am breathless. I am salt and light of the earth but also scared. Please stop the chase.
Anyone who knows grief knows mourning before death: we prepare for sorrow before it finds us, we wrap our arms around our bodies, rocking back and forth in the silence. In the night Joseph leaves my side. He crawls around his brothers and heads downward, as if being summoned. I keep my eyes tightly shut and try to think about many thingsMother finding him and taking him away, the stream disappearing, Josephs hand on my face soiled with mud, pulling me to himself. My heart thumps against my chest with heavy resignation, pinning me down. I know when he reaches the stream. The stillness in the air is sharp and frightening. I can hear myself breathing. I know when he lets himself into the cold water because he begins to cry, loudly, wailing.

narrativemagazine_tryphena_l.json,2,"After being cast out of your village for a curse you had no part in, you and your young brothers struggle to survive in the wilderness, haunted by grief, hunger, and the weight of impossible choices. One night, as the youngest crawls toward the stream, you feel the stillness of the air shift—something is coming, and it demands an answer.","He has his hands on Niis throat, and this time I do not stop them. Theyre fighting over the last sugarcane, and Nii has it held tightly between his teeth, the juice from the cane dripping down his shorts. I am more concerned about how many more days hell be wearing the shorts unwashed, with its stain, than Ayikwe choking him to death. As if trapped inside a curse, my brothers and I have, since Mothers passing, tasted famine in seasons of abundance. They call it a taboothat a woman will go into labor and lose her life, especially when the child survives. How is it possible that the same channel of life can know death? theyll say to one another. The baby must have sucked out her last breath. Sometimes theyll curse and plead their favor, Chai! Between my dead body and a cursed child, may God choose me. And hence the banishment of my family.
They did not come chasing us out of our home with machetes, as Ive been told of the past. But the signs were evident that they wanted us gone. At my kiosk in the market central, a scarecrow had been planted, its ripped white shirt besmirched with rotten tomatoes. The boys wondered why none of their friends would play with them. Once a boy in the neighborhood said Ayikwe was just a sacrificed clot of blood, and Ayikwe responded by digging his tiny fist into the boys cheek. A nightmare also kept repeating itself: that while we slept, townspeople gathered around our hut and, circling us in silence, lit a match. They set us on fire and lifted up their hands in thanksgiving. There was never smoke, just our cries filling the air. I couldnt let that happen, and so in the first week of August, we folded everything we owned, which wasnt much, into two sacks, and with a six-month-old baby strapped to my back, we made our way through the farms and into the outskirts of the village.
Nii is six and Ayikwe just turned eleven. For his birthday I read him Mothers favorite prayer, which we all know by heart, days spent kneeling on a mat speaking the words slowly, rehearsed and without meaning. He insists I read it, saying, You sound just like Ma. It is comfort.
Comforting, I say and begin to read from the back of an envelope that contains Bible verses and written prayers to God:
Lord, make me an instrument of your peace:
where there is hatred, let me sow love;
where there is injury, pardon;
where there is doubt, faith;
where there is despair, hope;
where there is darkness, light;
where there is sadness, joy.
O divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek
to be consoled as to console,
to be understood as to understand,
to be loved as to love.
For it is in giving that we receive,
it is in pardoning that we are pardoned,
and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen.
But I dont want to die, Nii says, and I smile at him, the babys head resting easy on my chest. We named him Joseph. Actually, Ayikwe did, after his favorite Bible character. I didnt object. At the time, I was spending days and nights in the clinic, signing papers I didnt understand and wishing everything to be over. It was a relief to come back home with a baby who already had a name picked out and a coat of many colors, a faded Ankara cloth my mother owned. Sometimes I wonder if Joseph will be the beam of light, the one who rises above the storm and saves us from drowning. At the back of my mind, although I resist thinking such things, I toy with the idea of selling him, although Im sure no one will pay for a wombs curse. I know Ill be sorry for harboring such thoughts. Nothing would be the same without him, but, frankly, selling him would be the best thing to happen to the boys and me. We could return home, just the three of us. I could have my kiosk in the market again and Ayikwe could grow maize on the farm. We could eat and laugh and be accepted.
You would think that by fifteen, life had dealt me enough, given me my share of its troublesleaving school to trade in the market with my mother and coming home to cook for a family, which reduced my life to servitude. And now to be responsible for my brothers lives when I can barely carry my own is something I never wanted.
Weve been in the woods twelve days. A meandering stream froths beside us. The boys have dug out groundnut and found a dead fish or two they could make nothing of. Ive eaten very little. For Joseph, I pick green leaves and grind them between my palms and force it down his mouth. He spits most of it out. I can hear the boys splashing their legs in the stream, and I allow myself to weep for the first time since everything. Its a private mourning; I grieve the loss of my mother, the cruel townspeople, and my tired heart. When the day winds down, clouds stretch above us, expanding like an inflated body. I do not know what makes me do it, but I open up the envelope and pull out a letter. It is dated January 2003. Some lines have been crossed out and some shaded deeply. I wonder what kind of prayer said to God is revocable. What happens to the receipts? We swallow back our words out of fear and like to believe God keeps no record. I cannot think of why Mother will want some prayers returned to her, but I know it is no way a lack of faith. Yet, here in these letters, she bleeds a softness Ive never known: God, life is so cursed out here. Do you hear me? The darkness comes after me and I run. Look, I am breathless. I am salt and light of the earth but also scared. Please stop the chase.
Anyone who knows grief knows mourning before death: we prepare for sorrow before it finds us, we wrap our arms around our bodies, rocking back and forth in the silence. In the night Joseph leaves my side. He crawls around his brothers and heads downward, as if being summoned. I keep my eyes tightly shut and try to think about many thingsMother finding him and taking him away, the stream disappearing, Josephs hand on my face soiled with mud, pulling me to himself. My heart thumps against my chest with heavy resignation, pinning me down. I know when he reaches the stream. The stillness in the air is sharp and frightening. I can hear myself breathing. I know when he lets himself into the cold water because he begins to cry, loudly, wailing.

Weve been in the woods twelve days. A meandering stream froths beside us. The boys have dug out groundnut and found a dead fish or two they could make nothing of. Ive eaten very little. For Joseph, I pick green leaves and grind them between my palms and force it down his mouth. He spits most of it out. I can hear the boys splashing their legs in the stream, and I allow myself to weep for the first time since everything. Its a private mourning; I grieve the loss of my mother, the cruel townspeople, and my tired heart. When the day winds down, clouds stretch above us, expanding like an inflated body. I do not know what makes me do it, but I open up the envelope and pull out a letter. It is dated January 2003. Some lines have been crossed out and some shaded deeply. I wonder what kind of prayer said to God is revocable. What happens to the receipts? We swallow back our words out of fear and like to believe God keeps no record. I cannot think of why Mother will want some prayers returned to her, but I know it is no way a lack of faith. Yet, here in these letters, she bleeds a softness Ive never known: God, life is so cursed out here. Do you hear me? The darkness comes after me and I run. Look, I am breathless. I am salt and light of the earth but also scared. Please stop the chase.
Anyone who knows grief knows mourning before death: we prepare for sorrow before it finds us, we wrap our arms around our bodies, rocking back and forth in the silence. In the night Joseph leaves my side. He crawls around his brothers and heads downward, as if being summoned. I keep my eyes tightly shut and try to think about many thingsMother finding him and taking him away, the stream disappearing, Josephs hand on my face soiled with mud, pulling me to himself. My heart thumps against my chest with heavy resignation, pinning me down. I know when he reaches the stream. The stillness in the air is sharp and frightening. I can hear myself breathing. I know when he lets himself into the cold water because he begins to cry, loudly, wailing. Nii stirs slightly, awakened by the noise, and I stretch my arm to pat him on the back, hushing him and whispering, Its nothing, now, just a bad dream. I know when the war ends because the crying stops, and a strange calmness settles over me. Trembling, I open my eyes, and the sky, an empty, borderless page, looks down at me, and I dare God to finally speak.",The author often employs vivid and sensory language to create an immersive atmosphere.,"In the story of siblings surviving a curse in exile, the author describes the juice from the sugarcane dripping down Nii's shorts, and the oppressive stillness of the air, enhancing the reader's sensory experience of the scene."
narrativemagazine_tryphena_l.json,2,"After being cast out of your village for a curse you had no part in, you and your young brothers struggle to survive in the wilderness, haunted by grief, hunger, and the weight of impossible choices. One night, as the youngest crawls toward the stream, you feel the stillness of the air shift—something is coming, and it demands an answer.","He has his hands on Niis throat, and this time I do not stop them. Theyre fighting over the last sugarcane, and Nii has it held tightly between his teeth, the juice from the cane dripping down his shorts. I am more concerned about how many more days hell be wearing the shorts unwashed, with its stain, than Ayikwe choking him to death. As if trapped inside a curse, my brothers and I have, since Mothers passing, tasted famine in seasons of abundance. They call it a taboothat a woman will go into labor and lose her life, especially when the child survives. How is it possible that the same channel of life can know death? theyll say to one another. The baby must have sucked out her last breath. Sometimes theyll curse and plead their favor, Chai! Between my dead body and a cursed child, may God choose me. And hence the banishment of my family.
They did not come chasing us out of our home with machetes, as Ive been told of the past. But the signs were evident that they wanted us gone. At my kiosk in the market central, a scarecrow had been planted, its ripped white shirt besmirched with rotten tomatoes. The boys wondered why none of their friends would play with them. Once a boy in the neighborhood said Ayikwe was just a sacrificed clot of blood, and Ayikwe responded by digging his tiny fist into the boys cheek. A nightmare also kept repeating itself: that while we slept, townspeople gathered around our hut and, circling us in silence, lit a match. They set us on fire and lifted up their hands in thanksgiving. There was never smoke, just our cries filling the air. I couldnt let that happen, and so in the first week of August, we folded everything we owned, which wasnt much, into two sacks, and with a six-month-old baby strapped to my back, we made our way through the farms and into the outskirts of the village.
Nii is six and Ayikwe just turned eleven. For his birthday I read him Mothers favorite prayer, which we all know by heart, days spent kneeling on a mat speaking the words slowly, rehearsed and without meaning. He insists I read it, saying, You sound just like Ma. It is comfort.
Comforting, I say and begin to read from the back of an envelope that contains Bible verses and written prayers to God:
Lord, make me an instrument of your peace:
where there is hatred, let me sow love;
where there is injury, pardon;
where there is doubt, faith;
where there is despair, hope;
where there is darkness, light;
where there is sadness, joy.
O divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek
to be consoled as to console,
to be understood as to understand,
to be loved as to love.
For it is in giving that we receive,
it is in pardoning that we are pardoned,
and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen.
But I dont want to die, Nii says, and I smile at him, the babys head resting easy on my chest. We named him Joseph. Actually, Ayikwe did, after his favorite Bible character. I didnt object. At the time, I was spending days and nights in the clinic, signing papers I didnt understand and wishing everything to be over. It was a relief to come back home with a baby who already had a name picked out and a coat of many colors, a faded Ankara cloth my mother owned. Sometimes I wonder if Joseph will be the beam of light, the one who rises above the storm and saves us from drowning. At the back of my mind, although I resist thinking such things, I toy with the idea of selling him, although Im sure no one will pay for a wombs curse. I know Ill be sorry for harboring such thoughts. Nothing would be the same without him, but, frankly, selling him would be the best thing to happen to the boys and me. We could return home, just the three of us. I could have my kiosk in the market again and Ayikwe could grow maize on the farm. We could eat and laugh and be accepted.

And now to be responsible for my brothers lives when I can barely carry my own is something I never wanted.

narrativemagazine_anna_besh.json,3,"After returning home, you find an old cassette tape of childhood recordings that stirs up memories—some warm, some heavy, and some you’re not sure you’re ready to face. What do you do with the flood of emotions it brings?","My mom picked me up from the airport at 11:58 p.m., well past her bedtime. I hopped into my sisters gold Honda CR-V, which my mom was driving because her car was in the shop, and found her listening to an old cassette, a recording of Helen and me from when we were little.
Listen to this, she said smiling, and turned up the volume.
I was trying to record you saying Dada, but you never quite get there.
The recording went on for about twenty minutes, a seven-month-old me cooing happily, a three-year-old Helen with a three-year-old voice. Come on, Abbie, lets go, she said, her tiny voice full of sass and spunk. Hearing the recording, my chest swelled in expectation, like watching a movie Id seen a long time ago, remembering how the story would changeby no means a tragedy but without the tied-up resolution everyone expected. I wanted to take Helens three-year-old shoulders and pull her into a firm hug. Do you have any idea how important you are?
In the recording she began to cough, and our mom, with a hint of frustration, said, Gracious! Hearing it twenty years later, I wondered how many consecutive nights shed gone without sleep. She was painting a bedroom, trying to be a good mother, wife, Catholic.
Why did you say gracious like that? Helen mimicked our moms slight exasperation, filling it in with anger.
Mom winced at the recording, and Im sure it was painful to hear her twenty-seven-year-old exhaustion caricatured by a three-year-old.
The tape whirred, then came to a stop with a gentle click. We drove through empty Memphis suburbs in comfortable silence, made our way along Raleigh LaGrange Road, finally rolling into the dark driveway, alive with summer air. The world was fragrant. Damp earth, cool grass, warm, heavy. Home. I stepped into the brightly lit kitchen, made a piece of toast, and went to bed.
I didnt sleep as long as Id hoped. Travel disrupted whatever rhythm thered been in my body, and I was up by seven.
Do you want me to take you to pick up your car? I offered, searching for a way to fill the empty morning.
We climbed back into the CR-V, and Mom pulled a 1999 Ben Harper cassette from the stack on the center console. Looking out the passenger window at the flat, hot summer, I found myself singing along.

We pulled into the entrance of the Nissan dealership off of Covington, which has better service than the one in Collierville, and Mom gathered her belongings: a cross-body purse full of pens, hand lotion, Kleenex, little glass hearts, and a St. Christopher medal; a 20-ounce thermos of steaming Emperors Cloud tea, the green metallic paint chipping around the lip; a set of Bose headphones draped casually around her neck like a piece of statement jewelry.

I hopped into my sisters gold Honda CR-V, which my mom was driving because her car was in the shop, and found her listening to an old cassette, a recording of Helen and me from when we were little.
Listen to this, she said smiling, and turned up the volume.
I was trying to record you saying Dada, but you never quite get there.
The recording went on for about twenty minutes, a seven-month-old me cooing happily, a three-year-old Helen with a three-year-old voice. Come on, Abbie, lets go, she said, her tiny voice full of sass and spunk. Hearing the recording, my chest swelled in expectation, like watching a movie Id seen a long time ago, remembering how the story would changeby no means a tragedy but without the tied-up resolution everyone expected. I wanted to take Helens three-year-old shoulders and pull her into a firm hug. Do you have any idea how important you are?
In the recording she began to cough, and our mom, with a hint of frustration, said, Gracious! Hearing it twenty years later, I wondered how many consecutive nights shed gone without sleep. She was painting a bedroom, trying to be a good mother, wife, Catholic.
Why did you say gracious like that? Helen mimicked our moms slight exasperation, filling it in with anger.
Mom winced at the recording, and Im sure it was painful to hear her twenty-seven-year-old exhaustion caricatured by a three-year-old.

newyorker_weike_wang.json,1,"A group of untenured professors living in faulty faculty housing must navigate relentless construction chaos, worsening leaks, and mounting frustrations—all while trying to decide if they should risk their careers to fight back or simply endure until tenure offers an escape.","Between the exterior wall and the Sheetrock, a waterproofing layer was missing. The builders, in their defense, said that the layer had simply been forgotten about, not left out in an intentional move to save money. The building was faculty housing, occupied only by professors and their families. All but one professor were untenured. Half had kids under ten.
The layer had been found to be missing during a city inspection a decade ago. Repairs were put off for nine years. The school, as both employer and landlord, cited extreme busyness, and pointed out that, despite the missing barrier, no actual apartment floods had occurred. Year ten there was a global pandemic, but year ten was also the end of the remediation period, so construction had to start. The contractor hosted a virtual meeting to explain the many phases of the process. The slide show had several typos. Demolition became demonition; no apartment number was listed correctly. How disruptive would all this be, the dance professor asked, and the cherub-faced blond contractors spokesman answered politely, Very much so, maam. Then the chemistry professor chimed in about particulates. If the entire brick faade was being torn off, what was being done about air-quality control? The chemistry professor had small children. Small children had small lungs. The blond man said that they would tape over everyones windows. They would tape over the vents of everyones A.C.s. So, no A.C.s or windows? another professor asked. All through summer, no opening windows or running A.C.s? This professor, who taught biology and kept on the buildings rooftop a colony of honeybees, was not known to repeat himself. The blond man said that that was correct. And that the rooftop would be closed to accommodate the rigging, so the bee colony would have to be moved.
To better address the concerns of the tenants, a second virtual meeting was called, and predictably it went much worse.
The third virtual meeting was cancelled, and, a day later, scaffolding went up. Spaghetti-like ropes encased the building, and men in orange vests carrying hammer drills appeared on skinny platform lifts. Windows were covered with a neon-blue film that turned every room into an aquarium and gave tenants headaches. No ones complained about the blue film before, the contractor said, though he then admitted to never having worked on an occupied building before. Clear film was procured four days later, the windows retaped.
The contractor did boast about having an on-site hygienist, a woman who was copied on e-mails but whom no one had met.
For three weeks, the noise level was terrible, from nine to five, Monday through Friday, with no pause. The new writing professor was trying to finish a novel but could only write things like So this is what it must feel like to live inside a tooth that a dentist is trying to drill. The tooth occupied her thoughts nightly. She hadnt gone to the dentist in years. Red dust coated the window film; plumes of smoke were seen. The religion professor brought up the plumes, how, from her red-tinted window, they seemed cloudlike even. The contractor replied immediately, copying the hygienist, to clarify that what the professor saw was not a plume or anything close to a cloud but a puff of smoke being aggrandized by the wind.
Each morning, there was an e-mail update explaining which units would be most directly affected that day, though the apartment numbers were still incorrect. So, to figure out if you were truly going to be affected, you had to watch for where the huge mechanical pulley on the roof was dropping lifts. Glancing up at the building from the outside, the ceramics professor was reminded of his childhood, and that unwinnable arcade game with a bin of plush toys and a slippery claw. He was on the corner waiting for Mister Softee. He was waiting for Mister Softee because his three boys, who were inside, had told him to text them when the truck was in sight.

The technical term for what was missing was flashingan embedded sheet of metal that prevents moisture from penetrating a buildings walls. Flashing is particularly important at junctions, around windows, vent pipes, etc. No one thought anymore of the words other meaningscommitting indecent exposure, for example, running buck naked across a green field in a Superman cape, as the six-year-old son of the dance professor had done during his first soccer game.
Inclement weather set in one weekend, a hurricane muscling through from the south. Rain fell for three days and nights, and the history professor, whose apartment was right below the pulley, said it sounded as if it were raining within the walls. Could there be a leak? He sent the company an audio clip. The company responded a minute later. Leaks were impossible. They had sealed all the leaks because that was what they were here to do. Below the history professor lived a math professor, who all weekend had been collecting the water that had funnelled into her office through the ceiling. She used a one-gallon bucket, and shed emptied the bucket into the bathtub five times. The math professor was married to the East Asian Studies professor. Not that ironically, the former was Asian and the latter white. Between gallons three and four, the former had drafted an angry e-mail to the school, but then stared at her unnuanced message. She worried about being the squeaky wheel, when she and her husband had upcoming third-year reviews. Still, she asked if he could rewrite and send the e-mail, given both his nuance skills and the fact that the administration might take him more seriously. That would be taking advantage of his privilege, he thought, and shook his head, but encouraged her to send the e-mail, since she should feel empowered to and he was never going to stand in her way. A quarrel about feminism followed. No e-mail was sent.
Over text, some tenants hatched a plan. They would implore the one tenured residentan economics professorto declare war by sending the e-mail and hiring a lawyer who would then launch the war by suing the school. But the economics professor was away. Hed left for Crete at the start of the construction, on a private jet owned by one of his friends.
Within the building, the audio clip went viral and was forwarded anonymously to the projects architect. The architect soon replied in an e-mail about how a pulley system of that weight might have shifted the buildings foundation, creating fractures, but this problem was, unfortunately, beyond the companys scope. They dealt only with faades. Another company did foundations.
The next weekend, another storm front came through. Seven gallons, the math professor counted.

The man noted the places where water was still seeping in. He said that there would likely be mold growth, and, should the mold be the color of soot, coal, or volcanic ash, they would need to call in the hygienist to culture it.

The builders, in their defense, said that the layer had simply been forgotten about, not left out in an intentional move to save money. The building was faculty housing, occupied only by professors and their families. All but one professor were untenured. Half had kids under ten.
The layer had been found to be missing during a city inspection a decade ago. Repairs were put off for nine years.

No ones complained about the blue film before, the contractor said, though he then admitted to never having worked on an occupied building before. Clear film was procured four days later, the windows retaped.
The contractor did boast about having an on-site hygienist, a woman who was copied on e-mails but whom no one had met.

Inclement weather set in one weekend, a hurricane muscling through from the south. Rain fell for three days and nights, and the history professor, whose apartment was right below the pulley, said it sounded as if it were raining within the walls. Could there be a leak? He sent the company an audio clip. The company responded a minute later. Leaks were impossible. They had sealed all the leaks because that was what they were here to do. Below the history professor lived a math professor, who all weekend had been collecting the water that had funnelled into her office through the ceiling. She used a one-gallon bucket, and shed emptied the bucket into the bathtub five times. The math professor was married to the East Asian Studies professor. Not that ironically, the former was Asian and the latter white. Between gallons three and four, the former had drafted an angry e-mail to the school, but then stared at her unnuanced message. She worried about being the squeaky wheel, when she and her husband had upcoming third-year reviews. Still, she asked if he could rewrite and send the e-mail, given both his nuance skills and the fact that the administration might take him more seriously. That would be taking advantage of his privilege, he thought, and shook his head, but encouraged her to send the e-mail, since she should feel empowered to and he was never going to stand in her way. A quarrel about feminism followed. No e-mail was sent.
Over text, some tenants hatched a plan. They would implore the one tenured residentan economics professorto declare war by sending the e-mail and hiring a lawyer who would then launch the war by suing the school. But the economics professor was away. Hed left for Crete at the start of the construction, on a private jet owned by one of his friends.
Within the building, the audio clip went viral and was forwarded anonymously to the projects architect. The architect soon replied in an e-mail about how a pulley system of that weight might have shifted the buildings foundation, creating fractures, but this problem was, unfortunately, beyond the companys scope.

Still, she asked if he could rewrite and send the e-mail, given both his nuance skills and the fact that the administration might take him more seriously. That would be taking advantage of his privilege, he thought, and shook his head, but encouraged her to send the e-mail, since she should feel empowered to and he was never going to stand in her way. A quarrel about feminism followed. No e-mail was sent.
Over text, some tenants hatched a plan. They would implore the one tenured residentan economics professorto declare war by sending the e-mail and hiring a lawyer who would then launch the war by suing the school. But the economics professor was away. Hed left for Crete at the start of the construction, on a private jet owned by one of his friends.
Within the building, the audio clip went viral and was forwarded anonymously to the projects architect. The architect soon replied in an e-mail about how a pulley system of that weight might have shifted the buildings foundation, creating fractures, but this problem was, unfortunately, beyond the companys scope. They dealt only with faades. Another company did foundations.
The next weekend, another storm front came through. Seven gallons, the math professor counted. In the history professors bedroom, a paint bubble, the height and width of a man, appeared on the wall overnight. He poked the bubble, afraid that it might actually be a person, like his department chair, and was sprayed, drenched, in brown water.
The professors lamented in the laundry room. What kind of collective e-mail to send, and in what tone? A seven-hundred-word one was drafted, with bulleted questions for further discussion. The e-mail was edited down to three hundred words, then ballooned again to a thousand.
We must withhold rent, the ethics professor saida thought that gave the non-activist professors palpitations.
The walls of the water-filled units now felt spongy, and eventually a two-hundred-word e-mail was sent, signed by all the untenured professors, and ending with the sentence We demand immediate action. Within an hour, a fit young man arrived and handed everyone he met a business card. The card said that he was the vice-president of the company. The man noted the places where water was still seeping in. He said that there would likely be mold growth, and, should the mold be the color of soot, coal, or volcanic ash, they would need to call in the hygienist to culture it. Not all strains are toxic, he informed them. Some were perfectly O.K. In addition, hed gone up to the roof and found no visible faults around the pulley system, so perhaps the leak was a prexisting condition that had suddenly, coincidentally, got worse. Things like this do happen, he insisted, and added that, once the scaffolding was removed, the foundation would naturally rise up, against gravity, to its previous position. Then he tipped his hard hat at the professors and wished them a good day.
So construction went on unimpeded, and more storms came through, and more gallons were collected. Spores grew in the wet areas, none whose colors were quite right to be cultured. Rent was paid reliably; no more complaints were filed. In time, the professors all arrived at the same conclusion. Was the leak really that bad? On good days, it sounded like living next to a waterfall. Push through it, the way you did in grad school; then, once you get tenure, you can fly to Crete.",The author often uses irony and sarcasm in dialogue to convey tone and character perspectives.,"In the story of untenured professors amidst construction chaos, the contractor's spokesman's polite yet dismissive response, ""Very much so, ma'am,"" to the question about disruption, conveys irony and highlights the disconnect between the contractors and the professors' plight."

newyorker_anne_enright.json,3,"Stranded in an unfamiliar airport late at night, you follow cryptic signs and encounter eerie silence, only to realize you don’t know what country you’re in—or what awaits beyond the glass doors ahead.","By that time, she had flown from Dublin to New York, then over to Milan, for a disastrous day followed by a long trot down to Gate D09, where nothing was happening. There were no passengers, just a lone, slightly accusatory woman in uniform, who said that the flight had been cancelled since yesterday and she would have to route throughand here her mind went blank, the way you blank on the name of a person at a partyalthough some part of her brain must have known, because she turned and walked back the way she had come, past the Segafredo franchise, the Swatch counter, past two Italian men shopping for sunglasses at a little spinning stand, down to the new gate, the number of which was circled on her new boarding pass. And it must have been noted somewhere, this layover in Germany, or Switzerland, or Austria (the signs, when she arrived, were all in German), she just forgot itshe must have forgotten it several times, she was too busy hating Italian airlines, and maybe all Italians, her mind kept snagging on that cancelled flight, those two handsome men, each turning to admire his own reflection in the others dark glasses.
When the plane landed, she followed the other passengers along the jet bridge, up an escalator, and down a glass-walled corridor, and zigzagged over and back through an empty baffle, with no queue to contain. She showed her passport to a tired official sitting high in a cubicle, who did not ask if she knew what country she was trying to get into so late at night. There should be a sign, she thought. A few bags circled on the carrousel, but she left them to it, and walked between bare steel tables, out through sliding doors into this new place.The last few passengers veered around her toward the big revolving doors: men, mostly, going home to warm beds while she stood looking at a hotel voucher and a boarding pass for a flight that would leave in four hours. Or in five hours. Sometimes her smartphone took a little while to catch up with the time zone, but she was pretty sure the flight would leave in five hours, minus one hours check-in time. Boarding 05:55 at Gate 19. She would need to be back here, in the airport, in four hours exactly.
When she looked up from her calculations, the exit door had stopped revolving. The far lights were switched offyou could not see the edges of the huge hall, and there was no one to ask which way to go. No cleaners, no security, no passengers pulling luggage or pushing trolleys in hijabs or shorts or travelling shawls. No announcements were being made. The airport was closed. Even the voice of the revolving door was silent, the one that told you in alternatingin revolvinglanguages not to push the door. She checked the signs in turn until she came to the one she was looking for: a stick figure lying in a narrow bed, with Hotel written underneath, then repeated in another language, which must have been FrenchHtel.
O.K., O.K., O.K., she said under her breath as she obeyed the sign and pulled her faithful roller bag past a row of deserted car-rental counters. O.K., O.K., O.K., as she overtook a stilled walkway, wondering in which direction it moved when it went. After a gap, there was another walkway, and then another; they continued into the distance in a broken line. Far ahead, a churning sound signalled one of them obstinately rolling past its bedtime. As she got closer, she could see the stainless-steel pathway moving, and the black rubber handrail moving, but they seemed to be sliding in different directions and her foot was almost on the thing before she realized that it was coming against her. She jinked to the side and made her way upstream toward another sign, pointing left, and another corridor, with a curved roof, like the fuselage of a plane, and this one was so long she could not see the end of it. There were moving walkways on both sides of her now, and none of them moved. She could hear the rasp of her coat sleeve against her coat and the regular clicking of her faithful bag over the floor tiles: ka-thock ka-thock ka-thock. There were no more signs.
In the distance, a motor lurched into action and she started, so the click of her wheels went out of synch. It was like a key change. Ka-thick ka-thick ka-thick, against the low hum of the walkway that was slowly rolling toward her. The darkness at the end of the corridor yielded two men, jolting a little as they were conveyed along like toy menor toy soldiers, indeed, because they wore peaked caps and one of them had a large gun, which he held across his front with both hands. The men stepped off the walkway and went to the next, which came to life as the one behind them slowed. Perhaps she could do the same. She could fire one of these things up and sail past the soldiers as they sailed along on the other side. But there was a gun. And she was not sure that the machine would start for her. The soldiers proceeded from one to the next. Their hats were white and they had light-green shirts under dark-green flak jackets. When they got onto the walkway beside her, she stopped on the motionless floor and waited for them to pass. The men turned slightly as they were carried beyond her.
Hotel? she said.
One of them laughed a little, the one with the gun. The other indicated over his shoulder, in the direction they had come.
Ein bisschen weiter. You must go a little fuurthher.
I went the entire day without any human interaction.

Thank you, she said, thinking the accent was so soft that she must be somewhere southern. Perhaps she had landed in Switzerland.
At the end of the corridor, there was a set of glass doors and, beyond them, bold orange street lamps lighting starkly shadowed bushes, a deserted blue road, and, on the other side of it, a big, beautiful hotel. She could imagine it: the feel of carpet under her roller wheels, dark wood, huge flowers scenting the air, a receptionist to say, There will be a shuttle to departures at 4:45 a.m. A shower. A bed.

Or not a hotel. The building was a warehouse, or a kind of hangar. That was also possible.
She closed her eyes for a moment, then opened them again, ka-thick ka-thick ka-thick, putting one foot in front of the other on the solid-seeming floor. The doors were in front of her now. They would open when she was very near. She would pass through them into the night air and, across the road, a smiling woman behind a counter, a key card to press against a numbered door, a little light that clicked green.
Or no hotel. Outside, across the road, was just another queue she had to join, a straggling line of people with their bags. Some of them were sitting down on the concrete of the street, where weeds grew out of the cracks, and men in green uniforms walked two by two, tapping the stocks of their guns, as if to reassure their HK416Cs, as if to remind their HK416Cs that they were still here. And the people in this line were wearing too many clothes: they had overcoats and cheap parkas, cardigans on top of cardigans; they had bits of cloth dangling off them, scarves and shawls, and one of them was wearing a blanket, which was not clean.
Outside the airport there is no hotel, no numbered door that opens on a room with a bed where she can sit and then lie back, prizing each shoe off with the toe of the other foot, so that one shoe and then the other drops to the carpet. No pillow she can bury her face in and then roll back from, afraid she might fall asleep fully dressed, afraid she might drool into her own hair. No. There is just this line of people who need a shower, and there is no showeryou can see it in their facesthere is no hope of water, let alone soap, let alone the shower stall she has been craving so hard, with beige stone walls and a granular, slip-free floor, a flat showerhead as big as the bottom of a bucket, soap that smells of bergamot, orange blossom, green tea. There is just rubbing your face so that the dirt comes off in needle-thin rolls of black dust mixed with old sweat, and the smell is the settled smell when you have been through dirty and come out the other sidea week after, a month afterwhen you are no longer rank, just stale. Because the line has been there for a long time, waiting to get into the shelter of the building that is across the road, a square block that does not look like a shelter, apart from the fact that it has a roof. And inside this building, with its high, small windows, there is, of course, another line, and more soldiers, who are sometimes a little disgusted by the smell, and sometimes a little pissed off, sometimes bored, patting their gunstocks impatiently because you are anxious and slow. Because you need to go to the toilet, and that means leaving the line, which is such a hassle, and sometimes when you come back to the line there is actual human shit on you, on your shoe or on the hem of your coat, because there is no money, there is no necessity, under the circumstances, to clean the toilet floor.
Beyond the automatic door there is no smiling receptionist, in a quietly cut suit of hotel blue, to tell her that, yes, her flight is on schedule, the shuttle will be there before five, plenty of time, because the airportin whatever town this isis really quite efficient. And, oh, breakfast does not start till six, so there will be croissants in the lobby. There will be no croissants, she knows that now.
Outside the door, there is no vending machine for the people in the line, to spiral out a Twix or a bottle of water. Where is your passport? a soldier says. It does not work without the visa. Who gave you this boarding card? Oh dear, that does not apply, that boarding card, it will not get you on a plane anymore. And the babies are crying now, so never mind the croissantsshe just needs to get through this line, all these people layered up in their cheap clothes, who are so shuffling and slow, and she unzips her bag to get her shawl, because it is cold. And, instead of a receptionist, there is a man with a gun, who is so bored he is out of his mind with boredom. He adjusts his crotch to the left, hoists his belthe has to shake out the hand that is clutching the stock of his gunand he checks out the tits of the women in line; he is checking tits all night, because he is so bored he just wants to fuck somebody now. He pushes a girl when he is moving her along, he shoves her a little, and it is important not to catch this mans eye; it is really important to keep looking at the floor. So never mind the cotton sheetsshe just wants the soft gaze of her own man, the soft gaze of her son. She wants to kiss her mother, because she is afraid her mother is in the line somewhere up ahead, in the sleeping block, perhaps, that is beyond this block, sitting on a bunk bed, or in the endless line that stretches out along the chain-link fence, a line that lasts for weeks and months and years. And her mother is very patient, but she is also old.
She is so close to the doors that she is afraid she will bang into the glass. She is afraid they will not open, and she is afraid of what is on the other side. The hotel was just a joke and she is lost. She does not know the name of the country she is in, and she no longer knows where to go.","The author often structures narratives around a protagonist's internal journey, using external events as a backdrop for introspection and fragmented experiences.","In the story regarding being lost in an unknown airport, the protagonist's journey is marked by her internal monologue and reflections on her situation, such as when she contemplates the absence of a hotel and the reality of her surroundings, rather than focusing solely on the physical journey through the airport."
newyorker_anne_enright.json,3,"Stranded in an unfamiliar airport late at night, you follow cryptic signs and encounter eerie silence, only to realize you don’t know what country you’re in—or what awaits beyond the glass doors ahead.","By that time, she had flown from Dublin to New York, then over to Milan, for a disastrous day followed by a long trot down to Gate D09, where nothing was happening. There were no passengers, just a lone, slightly accusatory woman in uniform, who said that the flight had been cancelled since yesterday and she would have to route throughand here her mind went blank, the way you blank on the name of a person at a partyalthough some part of her brain must have known, because she turned and walked back the way she had come, past the Segafredo franchise, the Swatch counter, past two Italian men shopping for sunglasses at a little spinning stand, down to the new gate, the number of which was circled on her new boarding pass. And it must have been noted somewhere, this layover in Germany, or Switzerland, or Austria (the signs, when she arrived, were all in German), she just forgot itshe must have forgotten it several times, she was too busy hating Italian airlines, and maybe all Italians, her mind kept snagging on that cancelled flight, those two handsome men, each turning to admire his own reflection in the others dark glasses.
When the plane landed, she followed the other passengers along the jet bridge, up an escalator, and down a glass-walled corridor, and zigzagged over and back through an empty baffle, with no queue to contain. She showed her passport to a tired official sitting high in a cubicle, who did not ask if she knew what country she was trying to get into so late at night. There should be a sign, she thought. A few bags circled on the carrousel, but she left them to it, and walked between bare steel tables, out through sliding doors into this new place.The last few passengers veered around her toward the big revolving doors: men, mostly, going home to warm beds while she stood looking at a hotel voucher and a boarding pass for a flight that would leave in four hours. Or in five hours. Sometimes her smartphone took a little while to catch up with the time zone, but she was pretty sure the flight would leave in five hours, minus one hours check-in time. Boarding 05:55 at Gate 19. She would need to be back here, in the airport, in four hours exactly.
When she looked up from her calculations, the exit door had stopped revolving. The far lights were switched offyou could not see the edges of the huge hall, and there was no one to ask which way to go. No cleaners, no security, no passengers pulling luggage or pushing trolleys in hijabs or shorts or travelling shawls. No announcements were being made. The airport was closed. Even the voice of the revolving door was silent, the one that told you in alternatingin revolvinglanguages not to push the door. She checked the signs in turn until she came to the one she was looking for: a stick figure lying in a narrow bed, with Hotel written underneath, then repeated in another language, which must have been FrenchHtel.
O.K., O.K., O.K., she said under her breath as she obeyed the sign and pulled her faithful roller bag past a row of deserted car-rental counters. O.K., O.K., O.K., as she overtook a stilled walkway, wondering in which direction it moved when it went. After a gap, there was another walkway, and then another; they continued into the distance in a broken line. Far ahead, a churning sound signalled one of them obstinately rolling past its bedtime. As she got closer, she could see the stainless-steel pathway moving, and the black rubber handrail moving, but they seemed to be sliding in different directions and her foot was almost on the thing before she realized that it was coming against her. She jinked to the side and made her way upstream toward another sign, pointing left, and another corridor, with a curved roof, like the fuselage of a plane, and this one was so long she could not see the end of it. There were moving walkways on both sides of her now, and none of them moved. She could hear the rasp of her coat sleeve against her coat and the regular clicking of her faithful bag over the floor tiles: ka-thock ka-thock ka-thock. There were no more signs.
In the distance, a motor lurched into action and she started, so the click of her wheels went out of synch. It was like a key change. Ka-thick ka-thick ka-thick, against the low hum of the walkway that was slowly rolling toward her. The darkness at the end of the corridor yielded two men, jolting a little as they were conveyed along like toy menor toy soldiers, indeed, because they wore peaked caps and one of them had a large gun, which he held across his front with both hands. The men stepped off the walkway and went to the next, which came to life as the one behind them slowed. Perhaps she could do the same. She could fire one of these things up and sail past the soldiers as they sailed along on the other side. But there was a gun. And she was not sure that the machine would start for her. The soldiers proceeded from one to the next. Their hats were white and they had light-green shirts under dark-green flak jackets. When they got onto the walkway beside her, she stopped on the motionless floor and waited for them to pass. The men turned slightly as they were carried beyond her.
Hotel? she said.
One of them laughed a little, the one with the gun. The other indicated over his shoulder, in the direction they had come.
Ein bisschen weiter. You must go a little fuurthher.
I went the entire day without any human interaction.

Thank you, she said, thinking the accent was so soft that she must be somewhere southern. Perhaps she had landed in Switzerland.
At the end of the corridor, there was a set of glass doors and, beyond them, bold orange street lamps lighting starkly shadowed bushes, a deserted blue road, and, on the other side of it, a big, beautiful hotel. She could imagine it: the feel of carpet under her roller wheels, dark wood, huge flowers scenting the air, a receptionist to say, There will be a shuttle to departures at 4:45 a.m. A shower. A bed.

When they got onto the walkway beside her, she stopped on the motionless floor and waited for them to pass. The men turned slightly as they were carried beyond her.
Hotel? she said.
One of them laughed a little, the one with the gun. The other indicated over his shoulder, in the direction they had come.

Thank you, she said, thinking the accent was so soft that she must be somewhere southern. Perhaps she had landed in Switzerland.
At the end of the corridor, there was a set of glass doors and, beyond them, bold orange street lamps lighting starkly shadowed bushes, a deserted blue road, and, on the other side of it, a big, beautiful hotel. She could imagine it: the feel of carpet under her roller wheels, dark wood, huge flowers scenting the air, a receptionist to say, There will be a shuttle to departures at 4:45 a.m. A shower. A bed.
Separated by a Smuggler
Or not a hotel. The building was a warehouse, or a kind of hangar. That was also possible.
She closed her eyes for a moment, then opened them again, ka-thick ka-thick ka-thick, putting one foot in front of the other on the solid-seeming floor. The doors were in front of her now. They would open when she was very near. She would pass through them into the night air and, across the road, a smiling woman behind a counter, a key card to press against a numbered door, a little light that clicked green.
Or no hotel. Outside, across the road, was just another queue she had to join, a straggling line of people with their bags. Some of them were sitting down on the concrete of the street, where weeds grew out of the cracks, and men in green uniforms walked two by two, tapping the stocks of their guns, as if to reassure their HK416Cs, as if to remind their HK416Cs that they were still here. And the people in this line were wearing too many clothes: they had overcoats and cheap parkas, cardigans on top of cardigans; they had bits of cloth dangling off them, scarves and shawls, and one of them was wearing a blanket, which was not clean.
Outside the airport there is no hotel, no numbered door that opens on a room with a bed where she can sit and then lie back, prizing each shoe off with the toe of the other foot, so that one shoe and then the other drops to the carpet. No pillow she can bury her face in and then roll back from, afraid she might fall asleep fully dressed, afraid she might drool into her own hair. No. There is just this line of people who need a shower, and there is no showeryou can see it in their facesthere is no hope of water, let alone soap, let alone the shower stall she has been craving so hard, with beige stone walls and a granular, slip-free floor, a flat showerhead as big as the bottom of a bucket, soap that smells of bergamot, orange blossom, green tea. There is just rubbing your face so that the dirt comes off in needle-thin rolls of black dust mixed with old sweat, and the smell is the settled smell when you have been through dirty and come out the other sidea week after, a month afterwhen you are no longer rank, just stale. Because the line has been there for a long time, waiting to get into the shelter of the building that is across the road, a square block that does not look like a shelter, apart from the fact that it has a roof. And inside this building, with its high, small windows, there is, of course, another line, and more soldiers, who are sometimes a little disgusted by the smell, and sometimes a little pissed off, sometimes bored, patting their gunstocks impatiently because you are anxious and slow. Because you need to go to the toilet, and that means leaving the line, which is such a hassle, and sometimes when you come back to the line there is actual human shit on you, on your shoe or on the hem of your coat, because there is no money, there is no necessity, under the circumstances, to clean the toilet floor.
Beyond the automatic door there is no smiling receptionist, in a quietly cut suit of hotel blue, to tell her that, yes, her flight is on schedule, the shuttle will be there before five, plenty of time, because the airportin whatever town this isis really quite efficient. And, oh, breakfast does not start till six, so there will be croissants in the lobby. There will be no croissants, she knows that now.
Outside the door, there is no vending machine for the people in the line, to spiral out a Twix or a bottle of water. Where is your passport? a soldier says. It does not work without the visa. Who gave you this boarding card? Oh dear, that does not apply, that boarding card, it will not get you on a plane anymore. And the babies are crying now, so never mind the croissantsshe just needs to get through this line, all these people layered up in their cheap clothes, who are so shuffling and slow, and she unzips her bag to get her shawl, because it is cold. And, instead of a receptionist, there is a man with a gun, who is so bored he is out of his mind with boredom. He adjusts his crotch to the left, hoists his belthe has to shake out the hand that is clutching the stock of his gunand he checks out the tits of the women in line; he is checking tits all night, because he is so bored he just wants to fuck somebody now. He pushes a girl when he is moving her along, he shoves her a little, and it is important not to catch this mans eye; it is really important to keep looking at the floor. So never mind the cotton sheetsshe just wants the soft gaze of her own man, the soft gaze of her son. She wants to kiss her mother, because she is afraid her mother is in the line somewhere up ahead, in the sleeping block, perhaps, that is beyond this block, sitting on a bunk bed, or in the endless line that stretches out along the chain-link fence, a line that lasts for weeks and months and years. And her mother is very patient, but she is also old.
She is so close to the doors that she is afraid she will bang into the glass. She is afraid they will not open, and she is afraid of what is on the other side. The hotel was just a joke and she is lost. She does not know the name of the country she is in, and she no longer knows where to go.","The author creates immersive settings by focusing on specific, sensory details that enhance the atmosphere and mood, often reflecting the protagonist's emotional state.","In the story regarding being lost in an unknown airport, the setting is vividly described through sensory details like the ""ka-thock ka-thock"" of the protagonist's bag and the ""bold orange street lamps,"" which contribute to the eerie and uncertain atmosphere."
newyorker_anne_enright.json,3,"Stranded in an unfamiliar airport late at night, you follow cryptic signs and encounter eerie silence, only to realize you don’t know what country you’re in—or what awaits beyond the glass doors ahead.","By that time, she had flown from Dublin to New York, then over to Milan, for a disastrous day followed by a long trot down to Gate D09, where nothing was happening. There were no passengers, just a lone, slightly accusatory woman in uniform, who said that the flight had been cancelled since yesterday and she would have to route throughand here her mind went blank, the way you blank on the name of a person at a partyalthough some part of her brain must have known, because she turned and walked back the way she had come, past the Segafredo franchise, the Swatch counter, past two Italian men shopping for sunglasses at a little spinning stand, down to the new gate, the number of which was circled on her new boarding pass. And it must have been noted somewhere, this layover in Germany, or Switzerland, or Austria (the signs, when she arrived, were all in German), she just forgot itshe must have forgotten it several times, she was too busy hating Italian airlines, and maybe all Italians, her mind kept snagging on that cancelled flight, those two handsome men, each turning to admire his own reflection in the others dark glasses.
When the plane landed, she followed the other passengers along the jet bridge, up an escalator, and down a glass-walled corridor, and zigzagged over and back through an empty baffle, with no queue to contain. She showed her passport to a tired official sitting high in a cubicle, who did not ask if she knew what country she was trying to get into so late at night. There should be a sign, she thought. A few bags circled on the carrousel, but she left them to it, and walked between bare steel tables, out through sliding doors into this new place.The last few passengers veered around her toward the big revolving doors: men, mostly, going home to warm beds while she stood looking at a hotel voucher and a boarding pass for a flight that would leave in four hours. Or in five hours. Sometimes her smartphone took a little while to catch up with the time zone, but she was pretty sure the flight would leave in five hours, minus one hours check-in time. Boarding 05:55 at Gate 19. She would need to be back here, in the airport, in four hours exactly.
When she looked up from her calculations, the exit door had stopped revolving. The far lights were switched offyou could not see the edges of the huge hall, and there was no one to ask which way to go. No cleaners, no security, no passengers pulling luggage or pushing trolleys in hijabs or shorts or travelling shawls. No announcements were being made. The airport was closed. Even the voice of the revolving door was silent, the one that told you in alternatingin revolvinglanguages not to push the door. She checked the signs in turn until she came to the one she was looking for: a stick figure lying in a narrow bed, with Hotel written underneath, then repeated in another language, which must have been FrenchHtel.
O.K., O.K., O.K., she said under her breath as she obeyed the sign and pulled her faithful roller bag past a row of deserted car-rental counters. O.K., O.K., O.K., as she overtook a stilled walkway, wondering in which direction it moved when it went. After a gap, there was another walkway, and then another; they continued into the distance in a broken line. Far ahead, a churning sound signalled one of them obstinately rolling past its bedtime. As she got closer, she could see the stainless-steel pathway moving, and the black rubber handrail moving, but they seemed to be sliding in different directions and her foot was almost on the thing before she realized that it was coming against her. She jinked to the side and made her way upstream toward another sign, pointing left, and another corridor, with a curved roof, like the fuselage of a plane, and this one was so long she could not see the end of it. There were moving walkways on both sides of her now, and none of them moved. She could hear the rasp of her coat sleeve against her coat and the regular clicking of her faithful bag over the floor tiles: ka-thock ka-thock ka-thock. There were no more signs.
In the distance, a motor lurched into action and she started, so the click of her wheels went out of synch. It was like a key change. Ka-thick ka-thick ka-thick, against the low hum of the walkway that was slowly rolling toward her. The darkness at the end of the corridor yielded two men, jolting a little as they were conveyed along like toy menor toy soldiers, indeed, because they wore peaked caps and one of them had a large gun, which he held across his front with both hands. The men stepped off the walkway and went to the next, which came to life as the one behind them slowed. Perhaps she could do the same. She could fire one of these things up and sail past the soldiers as they sailed along on the other side. But there was a gun. And she was not sure that the machine would start for her. The soldiers proceeded from one to the next. Their hats were white and they had light-green shirts under dark-green flak jackets.

newyorker_haruki_murakami.json,1,"You fell in love with an ice man, a mysterious being who seemed to know everything about you but nothing about himself. Now, in the endless cold of the South Pole, you wonder if love alone can thaw the growing distance between you.","Short story about a woman who marries an ice man... I married an ice man. I first met him in a hotel at a ski resort. ""Look, that's an ice man,"" my friend whispered. The iceman was tall, and he seemed to be young, but his fingers were rimed with a white frost that looked as if it would never melt. Something about him pierced me to the heart. I made up some excuse not to go out, and stayed in the hotel. I felt compelled to talk to the ice man no matter what. ""I don't ski,"" he said. ""I just like to sit here and read and look at the snow. You're interested in me, aren't you? You want to know what an ice man is."" I held back from asking personal questions. Instead, the iceman talked about me. Somehow, he knew all about me. ""How do you know so much about me?"" ""I can't read minds or anything. I just know."" Eventually we started dating. We always sat on a bench in the park and talked."" ""Why don't you talk about yourself? How did you come to be an ice man?"" ""I don't know. I don't even know if I had parents."" I fell seriously in love with this ice man. The ice man loved me just as I wasin the present. My mother and my older sister were strongly opposed to my marrying the ice man. ""You don't know a thing about his background."" So we got married. Nobody blessed the wedding, and no friends or relatives were happy for us. We rented a tiny apartment, and the ice man made a living by working at a cold-storage meat facility The two of us lived a happy life together, without bothering or being bothered by anyone. I even started to love having sex with the ice man. We wanted to have a child but that didn't seem to be possible. It may have been that human genes and ice-man genes didn't combine easily. I found myself with time on my hands. I would finish up all the housework, and then having nothing to do. I was still young, and doing the same thing day after day. ""How would it be if the two of us went away on a trip somewhere, just for a change?"" ""Well, if you really want to go on a trip so badly, I don't have anything against it."" ""How about visiting the South Pole?"" It seemed as soon as I spoke the words ""South Pole,"" something changed inside him. I had a premonition that if we went to the South Pole something would happen to us, but I couldn't find a good reason to cancel the trip. When we stepped off onto the ground of the South Pole I felt my husbands body lurch. something inside the ice man had been secretly violently shaken. He walked enthusiastically from place to place as if he couldn't get enough of it. He learned the local language quickly. I felt as though my husband had betrayed me and left me to care for myself. I eventually lost my strength. The airplane that had brought us there wad long since gone, and the runway was covered with ice.

This is a story from the Year of Spaghetti, 1971 A.D.
As a rule, I cooked spaghetti, and ate it, by myself. I was convinced that spaghetti was a dish best enjoyed alone. I cant really explain why I felt that way, but there it is.
I always drank tea with my spaghetti and ate a simple lettuce-and-cucumber salad. Id make sure I had plenty of both. I laid everything out neatly on the table and enjoyed a leisurely meal, glancing at the paper as I ate. From Sunday to Saturday, one Spaghetti Day followed another. And each new Sunday started a brand-new Spaghetti Week.
Every time I sat down to a plate of spaghettiespecially on a rainy afternoonI had the distinct feeling that somebody was about to knock on my door. The person who I imagined was about to visit me was different each time. Sometimes it was a stranger, sometimes someone I knew. Once, it was a girl with slim legs whom Id dated in high school, and once it was myself, from a few years back, come to pay a visit. Another time, it was William Holden, with Jennifer Jones on his arm.
William Holden?
Not one of these people, however, actually ventured into my apartment. They hovered just outside the door, without knocking, like fragments of memory, and then slipped away.
Spring, summer, and fall, I cooked and cooked, as if cooking spaghetti were an act of revenge. Like a lonely, jilted girl throwing old love letters into the fireplace, I tossed one handful of spaghetti after another into the pot.
Id gather up the trampled-down shadows of time, knead them into the shape of a German shepherd, toss them into the roiling water, and sprinkle them with salt. Then Id hover over the pot, oversized chopsticks in hand, until the timer dinged its plaintive note.
Spaghetti strands are a crafty bunch, and I couldnt let them out of my sight. If I were to turn my back, they might well slip over the edge of the pot and vanish into the night. The night lay in silent ambush, hoping to waylay the prodigal strands.

A Public Defender's Radical Approach to Representing The January 6th Rioters
Born in heat, the strands of spaghetti washed down the river of 1971 and vanished.
I mourn them allall the spaghetti of the year 1971.
When the phone rang at 3:20 p.m. I was sprawled out on the tatami, staring at the ceiling. A pool of winter sunlight had formed in the place where I lay. Like a dead fly I lay there, vacant, in a December spotlight.
At first, I didnt recognize the sound as the phone ringing. It was more like an unfamiliar memory that had hesitantly slipped in between the layers of air. Finally, though, it began to take shape, and, in the end, a ringing phone was unmistakably what it was. It was one hundred per cent a phone ring in one-hundred-per-cent real air. Still sprawled out, I reached over and picked up the receiver.
On the other end was a girl, a girl so indistinct that, by four-thirty, she might very well have disappeared altogether. She was the ex-girlfriend of a friend of mine. Something had brought them together, this guy and this indistinct girl, and something had led them to break up. I had, I admit, reluctantly played a role in getting them together in the first place.
Sorry to bother you, she said, but do you know where he is now?
I looked at the phone, running my eyes along the length of the cord. The cord was, sure enough, attached to the phone. I managed a vague reply. There was something ominous in the girls voice, and whatever trouble was brewing I knew that I didnt want to get involved.
Nobody will tell me where he is, she said in a chilly tone. Everybodys pretending they dont know. But theres something important I have to tell him, so pleasetell me where he is. I promise I wont drag you into this. Where is he?
I honestly dont know, I told her. I havent seen him in a long time. My voice didnt sound like my own. I was telling the truth about not having seen him for a long time, but not about the other partI did know his address and phone number. Whenever I tell a lie, something weird happens to my voice.
No comment from her.
The phone was like a pillar of ice.
Then all the objects around me turned into pillars of ice, as if I were in a J. G. Ballard science-fiction story.
I really dont know, I repeated. He went away a long time ago, without saying a word.
The girl laughed. Give me a break. Hes not that clever. Were talking about a guy who has to make a lot of noise no matter what he does.
She was right. The guy really was a bit of a dim bulb.
But I wasnt about to tell her where he was. Do that, and next Id have him on the phone, giving me an earful. I was through with getting caught up in other peoples messes. Id already dug a hole in the back yard and buried everything that needed to be buried in it. Nobody could ever dig it up again.
Im sorry, I said.
You dont like me, do you? she said suddenly.
I had no idea what to say. I didnt particularly dislike her. I had no real impression of her at all. Its hard to have a bad impression of somebody you have no impression of.
Im sorry, I said again. But Im cooking spaghetti right now.
Im sorry?
I said Im cooking spaghetti, I lied. I had no idea why I said that. But the lie had already become a part of meso much so that, at that moment at least, it didnt feel like a lie at all.
I went ahead and filled an imaginary pot with imaginary water, lit an imaginary stove with an imaginary match.
So? she asked.
I sprinkled imaginary salt into the boiling water, gently lowered a handful of imaginary spaghetti into the imaginary pot, set the imaginary kitchen timer for eight minutes.
So I cant talk. The spaghetti will be ruined.
She didnt say anything.
Im really sorry, but cooking spaghetti is a delicate operation.
The girl was silent. The phone in my hand began to freeze again.
So could you call me back? I added hurriedly.
Because youre in the middle of making spaghetti? she asked.
Yeah.
Are you making it for someone, or are you going to eat alone?
Ill eat it by myself, I said.
She held her breath for a long time, then slowly breathed out. Theres no way you could know this, but Im really in trouble. I dont know what to do.
Im sorry I cant help you, I said.
Theres some money involved, too.
I see.
He owes me money, she said. I lent him some money. I shouldnt have, but I had to.
I was quiet for a minute, my thoughts drifting toward spaghetti. Im sorry, I said. But Ive got the spaghetti going, so . . .
She gave a listless laugh. Goodbye, she said. Say hi to your spaghetti for me. I hope it turns out O.K.
Bye, I said.
When I hung up the phone, the circle of light on the floor had shifted an inch or two. I lay down again in that pool of light and resumed staring at the ceiling.
Thinking about spaghetti that boils eternally but is never done is a sad, sad thing.
Now I regret, a little, that I didnt tell the girl anything. Perhaps I should have. I mean, her ex-boyfriend wasnt much to start withan empty shell of a guy with artistic pretensions, a great talker whom nobody trusted. She sounded as if she really were strapped for money, and, no matter what the situation, youve got to pay back what you borrow.
Sometimes I wonder what happened to the girlthe thought usually pops into my mind when Im facing a steaming-hot plate of spaghetti. After she hung up the phone, did she disappear forever, sucked into the 4:30 p.m. shadows? Was I partly to blame?
I want you to understand my position, though. At the time, I didnt want to get involved with anyone. Thats why I kept on cooking spaghetti, all by myself. In that huge pot, big enough to hold a German shepherd.

The person who I imagined was about to visit me was different each time. Sometimes it was a stranger, sometimes someone I knew. Once, it was a girl with slim legs whom Id dated in high school, and once it was myself, from a few years back, come to pay a visit. Another time, it was William Holden, with Jennifer Jones on his arm.
William Holden?
Not one of these people, however, actually ventured into my apartment. They hovered just outside the door, without knocking, like fragments of memory, and then slipped away.
Spring, summer, and fall, I cooked and cooked, as if cooking spaghetti were an act of revenge. Like a lonely, jilted girl throwing old love letters into the fireplace, I tossed one handful of spaghetti after another into the pot.
Id gather up the trampled-down shadows of time, knead them into the shape of a German shepherd, toss them into the roiling water, and sprinkle them with salt. Then Id hover over the pot, oversized chopsticks in hand, until the timer dinged its plaintive note.
Spaghetti strands are a crafty bunch, and I couldnt let them out of my sight. If I were to turn my back, they might well slip over the edge of the pot and vanish into the night. The night lay in silent ambush, hoping to waylay the prodigal strands.

And then there was the pitiful, nameless leftover spaghetti carelessly tossed into the fridge.
A Public Defender's Radical Approach to Representing The January 6th Rioters
Born in heat, the strands of spaghetti washed down the river of 1971 and vanished.
I mourn them allall the spaghetti of the year 1971.
When the phone rang at 3:20 p.m. I was sprawled out on the tatami, staring at the ceiling. A pool of winter sunlight had formed in the place where I lay. Like a dead fly I lay there, vacant, in a December spotlight.
At first, I didnt recognize the sound as the phone ringing. It was more like an unfamiliar memory that had hesitantly slipped in between the layers of air. Finally, though, it began to take shape, and, in the end, a ringing phone was unmistakably what it was. It was one hundred per cent a phone ring in one-hundred-per-cent real air. Still sprawled out, I reached over and picked up the receiver.
On the other end was a girl, a girl so indistinct that, by four-thirty, she might very well have disappeared altogether. She was the ex-girlfriend of a friend of mine. Something had brought them together, this guy and this indistinct girl, and something had led them to break up. I had, I admit, reluctantly played a role in getting them together in the first place.
Sorry to bother you, she said, but do you know where he is now?
I looked at the phone, running my eyes along the length of the cord. The cord was, sure enough, attached to the phone. I managed a vague reply. There was something ominous in the girls voice, and whatever trouble was brewing I knew that I didnt want to get involved.
Nobody will tell me where he is, she said in a chilly tone. Everybodys pretending they dont know. But theres something important I have to tell him, so pleasetell me where he is. I promise I wont drag you into this. Where is he?
I honestly dont know, I told her. I havent seen him in a long time. My voice didnt sound like my own. I was telling the truth about not having seen him for a long time, but not about the other partI did know his address and phone number. Whenever I tell a lie, something weird happens to my voice.
No comment from her.
The phone was like a pillar of ice.
Then all the objects around me turned into pillars of ice, as if I were in a J. G. Ballard science-fiction story.
I really dont know, I repeated. He went away a long time ago, without saying a word.
The girl laughed. Give me a break. Hes not that clever. Were talking about a guy who has to make a lot of noise no matter what he does.
She was right. The guy really was a bit of a dim bulb.
But I wasnt about to tell her where he was. Do that, and next Id have him on the phone, giving me an earful. I was through with getting caught up in other peoples messes. Id already dug a hole in the back yard and buried everything that needed to be buried in it. Nobody could ever dig it up again.
Im sorry, I said.
You dont like me, do you? she said suddenly.
I had no idea what to say. I didnt particularly dislike her. I had no real impression of her at all. Its hard to have a bad impression of somebody you have no impression of.
Im sorry, I said again. But Im cooking spaghetti right now.
Im sorry?
I said Im cooking spaghetti, I lied. I had no idea why I said that. But the lie had already become a part of meso much so that, at that moment at least, it didnt feel like a lie at all.
I went ahead and filled an imaginary pot with imaginary water, lit an imaginary stove with an imaginary match.
So? she asked.
I sprinkled imaginary salt into the boiling water, gently lowered a handful of imaginary spaghetti into the imaginary pot, set the imaginary kitchen timer for eight minutes.
So I cant talk. The spaghetti will be ruined.
She didnt say anything.
Im really sorry, but cooking spaghetti is a delicate operation.
The girl was silent. The phone in my hand began to freeze again.
So could you call me back? I added hurriedly.
Because youre in the middle of making spaghetti? she asked.
Yeah.
Are you making it for someone, or are you going to eat alone?
Ill eat it by myself, I said.
She held her breath for a long time, then slowly breathed out. Theres no way you could know this, but Im really in trouble. I dont know what to do.
Im sorry I cant help you, I said.
Theres some money involved, too.
I see.
He owes me money, she said. I lent him some money. I shouldnt have, but I had to.
I was quiet for a minute, my thoughts drifting toward spaghetti. Im sorry, I said. But Ive got the spaghetti going, so . . .
She gave a listless laugh. Goodbye, she said. Say hi to your spaghetti for me. I hope it turns out O.K.
Bye, I said.
When I hung up the phone, the circle of light on the floor had shifted an inch or two. I lay down again in that pool of light and resumed staring at the ceiling.
Thinking about spaghetti that boils eternally but is never done is a sad, sad thing.
Now I regret, a little, that I didnt tell the girl anything. Perhaps I should have. I mean, her ex-boyfriend wasnt much to start withan empty shell of a guy with artistic pretensions, a great talker whom nobody trusted. She sounded as if she really were strapped for money, and, no matter what the situation, youve got to pay back what you borrow.
Sometimes I wonder what happened to the girlthe thought usually pops into my mind when Im facing a steaming-hot plate of spaghetti. After she hung up the phone, did she disappear forever, sucked into the 4:30 p.m. shadows? Was I partly to blame?
I want you to understand my position, though. At the time, I didnt want to get involved with anyone. Thats why I kept on cooking spaghetti, all by myself. In that huge pot, big enough to hold a German shepherd.

In 1971, I cooked spaghetti to live, and lived to cook spaghetti. Steam rising from the pot was my pride and joy, tomato sauce bubbling up in the saucepan my one great hope in life.
Published in the print edition of the November 21, 2005, issue.
I went to a cooking specialty store and bought a kitchen timer and a huge aluminum pot, big enough to bathe a German shepherd in, then went around to all the supermarkets that catered to foreigners, gathering an assortment of odd-sounding spices. I picked up a pasta cookbook at the bookstore, and bought tomatoes by the dozen. I purchased every brand of spaghetti I could lay my hands on, simmered every sauce known to man. Fine particles of garlic, onion, and olive oil swirled in the air, forming a harmonious cloud that penetrated every corner of my tiny apartment, permeating the floor and the ceiling and the walls, my clothes, my books, my records, my tennis racquet, my bundles of old letters. It was a fragrance one might have smelled on ancient Roman aqueducts.
This is a story from the Year of Spaghetti, 1971 A.D.
As a rule, I cooked spaghetti, and ate it, by myself. I was convinced that spaghetti was a dish best enjoyed alone. I cant really explain why I felt that way, but there it is.
I always drank tea with my spaghetti and ate a simple lettuce-and-cucumber salad. Id make sure I had plenty of both. I laid everything out neatly on the table and enjoyed a leisurely meal, glancing at the paper as I ate. From Sunday to Saturday, one Spaghetti Day followed another. And each new Sunday started a brand-new Spaghetti Week.
Every time I sat down to a plate of spaghettiespecially on a rainy afternoonI had the distinct feeling that somebody was about to knock on my door. The person who I imagined was about to visit me was different each time. Sometimes it was a stranger, sometimes someone I knew.
