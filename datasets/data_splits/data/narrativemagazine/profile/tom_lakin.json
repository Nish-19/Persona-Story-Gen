Years later, the faint trace of that moment haunts those who gaze upon the artwork, though they cannot say why.",
        "story": "With towels at their necks the boys came down out of the woods and crossed toward the dock in a ragged dark line. Below them the sea lay flat and black-green, the surface darkly dimpled by the breeze. Gulls rode gusts against the sky, wheeling, their wings arcing over striated sections of varying blue. In that vast and empty space the boys\u2019 voices carried with strange clarity, like voices in the very next room.\n\nTogether they picked their way down the clanging metal ramp to the dock, the biggest boy out ahead of the two others. On the wide warm boards they shed their towels and leapt in and then came up bobbing like seals, hairslicked and shouting. After a while two of the boys swam out a ways. Cold as shit, the big boy said, paddling awkwardly. Ain\u2019t that cold, said another, a smaller boy with a lumpy head fleeced with coarse hair. Maybe you\u2019re just a pussy. The big boy rushed at him, but the smaller boy was a better swimmer and fled giggling, and soon the big boy pulled up, gasping. Fuckin Smalls, he said. Wait till we get back on land.\n\nThe third boy watched all this from the calmer shoreline water. His eyes flicked between the others as if courtside at a tennis match. He wore an old black wetsuit against the cold, and while the other boys swam and splashed, he stayed near the dock, riding the gentle current. His legs dangled under him amid company unseen, scuttling crabs and fish that arrowed between wavering stalks of seaweed with their cuff-link eyes glittering. Something breezed past his foot trailing a chill, and he yanked up his leg and paddled a few strokes back toward the dock. Out to sea the big boy turned to him, calling: Hey, why don\u2019t you come out here? Stop being a fairy and come on out. For a moment the wetsuited boy gazed at his friend, bobbing gently, his wet brown head intermittently visible above the lazily rolling tongues of the waves. Then he swam out, doing a slow breaststroke with his chin held above the sea.\n\nFrom a high nearby window the painter watched this scene with a little smile. He remembered long-ago days of swimming off just such docks and fighting and shouting and snapping wet towels on the tanned narrow hips of just such boys. He dabbed his brush and with two wrist flicks slashed a seagull across the sky-blue top of his canvas and then another below it. He stood back and regarded the developing seascape, and then he dipped back his brush and brought it up again and added a swimming boy, the bent brown shape of his arm and his face not more than a tan splotch under a daub of brown hair. Then he turned back to the window and watched the boy in the wetsuit swim out to his friends.\n\nThe boy had nearly reached them when the water around him broke apart in an explosion of spray. To the others it was as if a locomotive had come surging up from the deep, blue-black and gleaming and big around as a tree. The boy\u2019s small body was thrown up into the air and spun for a moment flopping and balletic before crashing back to the boiling sea. The others watched dumbstruck as the shark traced a slow curve and came again, its dorsal fin carving the surface as it drove the great barrel of its body at the boy. The fish lifted him and swung its huge head like a duck hound, flinging the boy back and forth in a pinwheeling fantail of bright-red blood. His soft child\u2019s face was a rictus of fear, and his eyes shone like watch dials against the expanse of blue, though it was clear to the painter that life no longer lit them.\n\nThen, just as quickly as it had come, the shark vanished. It left behind a patch of churned sea that sucked back in on itself with a great gulping sound and then healed over as if nothing had happened at all. From his window the painter watched frozen as the other boys flailed toward shore, their path marked by little detonations of spray. From that distance their progress seemed comically slow and their small cries tinny and pointless in the thin blue-gold air. Though frantic, the painter found he couldn\u2019t tear his gaze from the mauled boy, who floated now facedown in the sea, lifeless as a log with his own blood spreading around him like ink spilled in a pool. Without looking away, the man put his hands on his palette. He dabbed a brush along the edge where the red was kept and brought it to the canvas and slashed a thick line next to the figure of the swimming boy. For a long moment he stared down at what he\u2019d done, and then he dropped his brush and ran into the kitchen for the phone.\n\n\nYears later, a finely dressed older woman came into a downtown gallery looking for a painting to hang in her dining room. She scanned the cool white walls and found herself drawn to a seascape that showed birds wheeling above a swimming boy. Coming closer, she noticed an odd red smudge in the water beside the boy, the mark faint but still visible, as if the artist had tried but been unable to cover up an earlier mistake.\n\nShe bought the painting and took it home, and each time she came into the dark, elegant room her gaze went as if of its own volition to that same red smudge. If asked, she couldn\u2019t have said what it was about the picture that entranced her so. But of course it was the red spot\u2014the whiff of pain there, the sweet hot lovely rumor of blood.\n\nWhen the woman died, at ninety, of a cerebral hemorrhage, the painting found its way to her son, who, heartbroken and oblivious of the sinister slash, now long faded, hung the picture lovingly in the den beside his hunting trophies\u2014three beautiful bufflehead ducks, their iridescent heads shining, each one mounted as if still in graceful flight.\n\n"
