        "writing_prompt": "You\u2019re driving home at dawn after a sleepless night with old friends, the quiet hum of the road and the soft blue sunrise stirring memories of someone beside you who feels both distant and achingly familiar. What do you say, or leave unsaid?",
        "story": "You have always seemed important to me. Always the tall one, the quiet tall one. The thoughtful tall one. Eyes honest and blue, sometimes overwhelming like the stormy Pacific; hair disheveled, honey-gold, like the light that comes just before sunset; freckles spattered across face and shoulders like stars that have been carefully counted and then forgotten, left to their own rambunctious devices to build constellations. These were not the things I first noticed about you.\n\nRather, I took notice of the way you talked. An almost Southern accent that you reined in just before a remnant of Georgia or Alabama slid off the tongue; the way you never seemed to feel the need to fill the empty space with meaningless conversation; the way you sometimes leaned forward onto countertops, propping your chin on the heel of your hand, level with whoever had provoked your slight side smile.\n\nI took notice of how it felt to be near you, of the way that you drove, the music you played in your car, how you took your coffee. I noticed the books that you read, the stories with which you chose to fill your mind. You made me remember the smell of damp moss and Robin Hood. The little lost prince, and sunlit trees.\n\nI liked remembering these things. Somehow I felt like I\u2019d known you before. I still feel like I\u2019ve known you before\u2014somewhere in the distant past, fifty years or eons ago. Your soul feels old and familiar like a book that opens to my favorite pages.\n\nOnce I drove your car home after an entire night spent in the dark\u2014a group of us trudging along to the top of a mountain at what must have been a vertical incline. We made it, although the only view awaiting us at the peak was that of the stars in the night sky, which we could have seen just as well at sea level. We laughed at how ridiculous we had been and ate dark chocolate dipped in peanut butter and shielded our faces from the wind.\n\nWe hadn\u2019t slept, the handful of us. I was the most awake, so I drove us all home. It was 5:00 a.m. and the sun had just started stirring, verging on getting up and starting the day, on waking the world with a quiet peek over the mountains. We were fifty miles away from home and we were in your car. You sat shotgun, the other two asleep in the back seat.\n\nI remember the stillness, the quietness, the blueness, the haziness. The whole world seemed groggy eyed, gentle; maybe asking for five more minutes of darkness. I remember feeling you beside me and how normal it seemed; I\u2019d learned your rhythms long ago and found them easy. Beside you, I felt like I was home again after spending too long abroad. I had a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, like you were an old soul from eons ago who had returned to me once before in a similar way. I could have cried because you were so close to me.\n\nThe asphalt stretched out before us, swallowed up by the mountains in the distance. I made slow sweeping turns and gentle stops, watching heads lulling in the rearview mirror, and sometimes I stole glances over at you.\n\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d I wanted to know, and something about the dewy world around us made me feel like we could start fresh with honest and sincere questions. How are you, since we haven\u2019t really spoken in over a year, since you used to be relevant to my life and I to yours, since I still miss you. And what I really want to know is if you ever think about that time when we at least pretended to be close to one another, and whether you were faking it, and whether I was faking it. And what I want to know even more is if you think you will ever allow me to know you again, and whether you will ever want to know me again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d You almost said more but stopped yourself.\n\nYou looked over at me, and I smiled because I recognized something in your eyes. You had grown older and taller, your shoulders broader, your hair longer, but your eyes were the same. And then I played a song that I knew you\u2019d recognize. Maybe it was a bit unfair\u2014you hadn\u2019t asked for a trip down memory lane\u2014but I was prompted by the blue sunrise and all the things I wanted to say but couldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI like when you can see the layers of mountains\u2014I can count seven,\u201d you said.\n\nI turned the music down, gripped the steering wheel a bit tighter, and responded, \u201cI count nine\u2014wait no, maybe just seven. I\u2019m not sure, really; I\u2019ve never tried counting them before. I like how some of them are almost transparent, like smoke.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too\u2014I like the colors.\u201d\n\nI waited for you to elaborate, to say something vaguely poetic, introspective, important, anything.\n\n\u201cCan you believe he has to work today?\u201d you asked, gesturing with your eyes to one of the heads dozed off in the backseat. Just like that, our moment passed. The next song came on.\n\nWe drove the rest of the way home in relatively comfortable silence. I wondered if the blue sunrise was just a product of global warming.\n\nAs I rolled into my driveway, rocks crunched beneath the tires, usually a welcome sound, but now it made me ache. I sat back and took a deep breath. Then I collected my things and opened the door.\n\n\u201cDrive safe,\u201d I said, stepping out of the car. I avoided your eyes as I swung the door shut. \u201cLet me know you make it home safely.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill do.\u201d\n\nI watched as you slid over to the driver\u2019s seat and adjusted the mirrors and radio. As you slowly swung out of the driveway, the sunglasses hanging from your rearview mirror swayed in time to the song stuck in my head, and sunshine glinted off the silver of your wheels. I stood there, my hand held in a half wave, then turned toward the back door of the big blue house.\n\n"

        "writing_prompt": "Every time they leave, you tell yourself it\u2019s the last goodbye\u2014but the door stays unlocked, the light stays on, and you keep waiting, caught between hope and the ache of their absence.",
        "story": "I wish I could promise that if you walked away I would close my door to you forever, that I wouldn\u2019t linger in the moment between your turning away and my locking up\u2014it\u2019s like that millisecond during takeoff when your seat has yet to catch you and you know how it feels to be weightless. I admit that even without reason to hope, I would continue to leave the key under the mat and the front-porch light on, to listen for the sound of your car pulling into the driveway, though I would never admit this.\n\nI would habitually check the mail for your letters, which used to arrive sporadically, often conveniently on rainy days. Despite my best efforts, I would bump into you among ordinary objects: coffeepot, toothpaste, Wrangler jeans, popcorn, making my most routine days painfully full of you, yet equally empty. These would be my stumbling blocks, painting bruises up and down my shins.\n\nSometimes I lose track of you, and I am left with the confused desperation that comes when looking for a reserved seat in a dark theater. I search for your face in crowds at the airport, scouring those gathered at departure gates. Though I am constantly awaiting your arrival, you always seem to be leaving. I find it troubling how much more pronounced your departures are in my memory, as if arrivals and departures didn\u2019t come in matching pairs, like socks.\n\nWith every door that opens, I look up, half expecting to see you walking over to me, carrying my coffee just like on the winter Sundays we spent together. Slowly, I am realizing that I can\u2019t affectionately call them \u201cthe good old days\u201d because they are the exception, not the rule. Sometimes I hear myself saying, \u201cOn Sundays we used to read for hours,\u201d when it was more like, \u201cOne Sunday we read for hours.\u201d\n\nI am afraid that you\u2019ve made up your mind to go for good. You keep up the conversation just enough to fill the empty space as you awkwardly pull on your sweater, your winter scarf, hat, coat, and gloves, your bag hoisted onto one shoulder. You wait for me to show you the door, as if you are a stranger and don\u2019t know where to find it yourself. You lean in to kiss me because that is what we do when we say goodbye.\n\nI watch as you gradually coil in on yourself routinely, mechanically, like a snake tucking itself away for winter. Sometimes I am afraid that you are inviting me into indifference, the limbo that exists in airports and elevators, to become one of those old friends you don\u2019t see or talk to often but you still call \u201cfriend.\u201d You forget to let me know that you made it home safely.\n\nYou call me on FaceTime tonight, stoned out of your mind after working yourself into the ground; you rarely reserve much of yourself for conversation these days. You stare at me with a stupid smile and rosy cheeks.\n\n\u201cYou look nice,\u201d you say.\n\nI laugh because it is how I buy time when I don\u2019t feel like forcing conversation\u2014an attempt to leave enough space for you to say something more. But you don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to let you go?\u201d I ask, expecting you to insist on hearing about my day first.\n\n\u201cIn a second.\u201d\n\nMy stomach plummets. I offer you these outs, and it stings when you take me up on them.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m just being hormonal.\n\n\u201cAre you going to hang up now?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cNo, you have to.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, bye.\u201d\n\n"

        "writing_prompt": "After returning home, you find an old cassette tape of childhood recordings that stirs up memories\u2014some warm, some heavy, and some you\u2019re not sure you\u2019re ready to face. What do you do with the flood of emotions it brings?",
        "story": "My mom picked me up from the airport at 11:58 p.m., well past her bedtime. I hopped into my sister\u2019s gold Honda CR-V, which my mom was driving because her car was in the shop, and found her listening to an old cassette, a recording of Helen and me from when we were little.\n\n\u201cListen to this,\u201d she said smiling, and turned up the volume.\n\n\u201cI was trying to record you saying \u2018Dada,\u2019 but you never quite get there.\u201d\n\nThe recording went on for about twenty minutes, a seven-month-old me cooing happily, a three-year-old Helen with a three-year-old voice. \u201cCome on, Abbie, let\u2019s go,\u201d she said, her tiny voice full of sass and spunk. Hearing the recording, my chest swelled in expectation, like watching a movie I\u2019d seen a long time ago, remembering how the story would change\u2014by no means a tragedy but without the tied-up resolution everyone expected. I wanted to take Helen\u2019s three-year-old shoulders and pull her into a firm hug. \u201cDo you have any idea how important you are?\u201d\n\nIn the recording she began to cough, and our mom, with a hint of frustration, said, \u201cGracious!\u201d Hearing it twenty years later, I wondered how many consecutive nights she\u2019d gone without sleep. She was painting a bedroom, trying to be a good mother, wife, Catholic.\n\n\u201cWhy did you say \u2018gracious\u2019 like that?\u201d Helen mimicked our mom\u2019s slight exasperation, filling it in with anger.\n\nMom winced at the recording, and I\u2019m sure it was painful to hear her twenty-seven-year-old exhaustion caricatured by a three-year-old.\n\nThe tape whirred, then came to a stop with a gentle click. We drove through empty Memphis suburbs in comfortable silence, made our way along Raleigh LaGrange Road, finally rolling into the dark driveway, alive with summer air. The world was fragrant. Damp earth, cool grass, warm, heavy. Home. I stepped into the brightly lit kitchen, made a piece of toast, and went to bed.\n\nI didn\u2019t sleep as long as I\u2019d hoped. Travel disrupted whatever rhythm there\u2019d been in my body, and I was up by seven.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to take you to pick up your car?\u201d I offered, searching for a way to fill the empty morning.\n\nWe climbed back into the CR-V, and Mom pulled a 1999 Ben Harper cassette from the stack on the center console. Looking out the passenger window at the flat, hot summer, I found myself singing along. The window caught glints of morning sun and offered snapshots of the girl I must have been once but now hardly recognized. She had a messy middle part, blonde peach-fuzz legs, and knew all the words to \u201cSteal My Kisses.\u201d\n\nWe pulled into the entrance of the Nissan dealership off of Covington, which has better service than the one in Collierville, and Mom gathered her belongings: a cross-body purse full of pens, hand lotion, Kleenex, little glass hearts, and a St. Christopher medal; a 20-ounce thermos of steaming Emperor\u2019s Cloud tea, the green metallic paint chipping around the lip; a set of Bose headphones draped casually around her neck like a piece of statement jewelry. She held it all so naturally, each item an extension of her.\n\nThe guy helping us ushered her into her newly serviced car, and I climbed over to the driver\u2019s side of the CR-V, adjusting the mirrors and seat. Pulling out into the right lane of morning traffic, I fumbled for the volume knob on the stereo. I skipped a handful of Ben Harper songs, listening for something different, though I wasn\u2019t sure what. The tape flipped over, and the song that filled the car took me back to the purple-gray time of Helen\u2019s teenage depression, when she never left her room, didn\u2019t talk or eat much\u2013somewhere I hadn\u2019t been in quite a while. A heaviness sank into my shoulders and under my eyes. I felt alone again, a stark contrast to our warm infant closeness. The song carried me into the backseat of our mom\u2019s navy-blue minivan, raindrops racing to the edge of the window, losing themselves in one another, while I imagined the wild-eyed woman in the song in her white nightgown, mourning, lonely, desperate. The sadness and fear almost swallowed me, and remembering it made me drive faster, as if I could lose it in the twists and turns of Raleigh LaGrange Road.\n\n\u201cReally, we\u2019re all just lonely for ourselves,\u201d my mom said matter-of-factly, when later that day I mentioned the hollowness of that song.\n\n"
