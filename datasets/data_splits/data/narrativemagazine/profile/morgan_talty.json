        "writing_prompt": "After finding your friend passed out in a frozen swamp with his hair stuck in the ice, you cut him free and promise to retrieve his frozen hair for a ceremonial burning\u2014but first, there\u2019s the matter of beer, chips, and a long-overdue gram of pot.",
        "story": "Winter, and I walked the sidewalk at night along banks of hard snow. I\u2019d just come from Rab\u2019s apartment off the reservation. Rab\u2014this white guy with a wide mouth and eyes that closed up when he laughed\u2014sold pot. He was smart too\u2014I had asked for a gram, and after he weighed it and put it in a plastic baggie, he didn\u2019t believe me when I reached into my pants and jacket pockets looking for the cash among the cigarette wrappers and pocketknife, and when I acted the part and kept saying, \u201cShit shit shit, it must\u2019ve fell out on the walk over here,\u201d he shook his head, took the weed out of the baggie, and put it back into his Mason jar. \u201cI ain\u2019t smokin\u2019 you up,\u201d he said, and so then I said, \u201cFuck you, Rab, I really did lose the money, you\u2019ll see, watch when I come back here in thirty minutes with the money I dropped, you\u2019ll feel stupid then.\u201d He shrugged a Sorry, man, and I slammed his door shut as I left.\n\nAt the bridge to the reservation, the river was still frozen, ice shining white-blue under a full moon. The sidewalk on the bridge hadn\u2019t been shoveled since the last nor\u2019easter crapped snow in November, and I walked in the boot prints everyone made who walked the walk to Overtown to get pot or catch the bus to wherever it was us Indians had to go, which really wasn\u2019t anywhere because everything we needed\u2014except pot\u2014was on the rez. Well, except the grocery store or Best Buy or Bed Bath & Beyond, but those natives who bought 4K Ultra DVDs or fresh white doilies had cars, wouldn\u2019t be taking the bus like me or Fellis did each day to the methadone clinic. That was another thing the rez didn\u2019t have: a methadone clinic. But we had sacred grounds where sweats and peyote ceremonies happened once a month, except since I had chosen to take methadone, I was ineligible to participate in native spiritual practice, according to the doc on the rez.\n\nNatives damning natives.\n\nThe roads on the rez were quiet, trees bending under the weight of snow, and when I passed the frozen swamp a voice moaned out. I stopped walking. Nothing, so I kept on going on the sparkly road until I heard it again.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d I yelled. The moan came again. It was a man, somewhere in the swamp. I got closer, listening. There it was: low and breathy, and I followed after the noise.\n\nThe swamp was frozen solid, the snow blown in piles, and so I slid over the ice, looking for the source of the noise. Moonlight through bare tree limbs lit the swamp, and caught there among the tree stumps and solid snow was a person sprawled out on the ground. He was trying to sit up but kept falling back, like he\u2019d just done one thousand crunches and was too sore to do just one more.\n\nI got close, stood over him. It was Fellis.\n\n\u201cFellis,\u201d I said. \u201cIs that you?\u201d\n\nFellis tried to sit up, but something pulled him back down. \u201cFuck you,\u201d he said. \u201cHelp me.\u201d He groaned, shivered.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say how to help him, so I had to squat down and look at him. I flicked my lighter and his purple lip quivered.\n\n\u201cHurry,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFellis,\u201d I said. I stood up. \u201cI can\u2019t help you if I don\u2019t know what\u2019s a matter with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy hair,\u201d he said.\n\nI crouched back down and looked at his hair. \u201cHoly,\u201d I said, and I laughed. He kept his hair braided all the time, but it was undone, his long black hair frozen into the snow.\n\n\u201cGet me out, Dee,\u201d he said. \u201cDee, get me out.\u201d\n\nAt first I tried to pull the hair out from the snow, tried to chip the snow away, but his hair wouldn\u2019t come loose. And then I yanked real hard, and Fellis screamed.\n\n\u201cLift your head up,\u201d I said. I opened my pocketknife, grabbed his hair in a fistful, and cut. When I got through the last bit of hair, Fellis rolled over and away from where he\u2019d been stuck. He rubbed his head like he just woke up.\n\nI helped him stand, and we slipped all over the ice on our way out of the swamp. Through dry heaves, Fellis said he missed the bus this morning to the methadone clinic\u2014\u201cNo shit,\u201d I said, because I didn\u2019t see him there\u2014and he thought some booze would be good before he got sick from not having any methadone. He had just a bit of booze left when he decided to go see Rab to get some pot, and on the way he stopped off in the swamp to feel the quiet that came with too much drinking, and when he plopped down in the snow he dozed right off. When he woke up, his hair was frozen in the snow.\n\nI got him to his mom\u2019s, where he lived. He walked fine by himself to the door, but I walked with him up the steps.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d scalp a fellow tribal member,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d he said. He fumbled in his pocket for his house key.\n\n\u201cYou wanna smoke?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you listen? I didn\u2019t make it to Rab\u2019s.\u201d He unlocked the door.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go for you,\u201d I said. \u201cGive me the cash.\u201d\n\nFellis looked at me.\n\n\u201cTwenty minutes,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll run there and back while you warm up your pretty bald head.\u201d\n\nHe gave me thirty bucks, and I didn\u2019t ask where he got it from. Yesterday he said he didn\u2019t have any money.\n\n\u201cTwenty bag,\u201d Fellis said. \u201cAnd stop at Jim\u2019s and get some tall boys and a bag of chips. Any kind but Humpty Dumpty chips. Too damn salty, and my stomach hurts.\u201d\n\nDown Fellis\u2019s driveway I thought about the look on Rab\u2019s face when he saw I had the money. What I tell you? How about that gram?\n\n\u201cDee!\u201d Fellis yelled. \u201cBring me my hair, so we can burn it! Don\u2019t want spirits after us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re damned anyway,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I guess I\u2019ll get your hair.\u201d\n\nI kept going, wondering, Hair or pot first? Pot made the most sense. It would look strange having to set the hair and ice down like a soaked mop on the counter at Jim\u2019s while I reached in my pocket for Fellis\u2019s money. Jim\u2014that old wood booger\u2014would say, \u201cWe don\u2019t take those anymore.\u201d I\u2019d look him square in his sagging face and say,\u201cI ain\u2019t trading no hair, you old fucker,\u201d and I\u2019d smack down on the counter a ten-dollar bill for the tall boys and chips. With the change jingling in my pocket, I\u2019d walk to Rab\u2019s and he\u2019d say, \u201cGet that hair out of here, it\u2019s dripping on my floor,\u201dand I\u2019d have to plop the hair on the muddy white floor in the hallway while Rab reweighed the same nugs he weighed earlier for me.\n\nNo\u2014I\u2019d grab Fellis\u2019s hair from the swamp on my way home. With Fellis on his unmade bed, me on a torn beanbag in the corner, each of us with a tall boy and the pot smoke hazing gray the room, we\u2019d keep poking and squeezing the hair, waiting for it to dry, waiting to burn it.\n"

        "writing_prompt": "On the reservation, teeth are more than just teeth\u2014they hold power, stories, and curses. When a rotting wisdom tooth begins to feel like more than just decay, you start to wonder: is it time to let it go, or is it holding onto something you\u2019re not ready to lose?",
        "story": "I\u2019m thinking about rolling my tongue over my rotting tooth. Should I do it? Teeth can be very dangerous. Just like our Native hair, they can be used against us, to curse us.\n\nI went to see my aunt\u2014a dental hygienist on the reservation\u2014to get X-rays. It was September, and the yellow and orange leaves were dry and dying.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worse than I thought,\u201d she said.\n\nI was horrified. I\u2019d already been told my wisdom teeth needed to be yanked out. \u201cThey\u2019ll rot,\u201d the dentist had said. I put it off for years, though, and watched week after week after week in the mirror as my far back tooth rotted, not wanting to get it extracted.\n\nMy father has dentures. When I was child, I watched from the window in our blue home on a dead-end street as my father called one of his employees a name. Then\u2014BAM!\u2014the guy punched my father, sending him sprawling backward, and his jeckin (that\u2019s Native for butt) banged into the earth, sending ripples through the smooth summer grass. My father then got partials implanted, which were later punched out. I didn\u2019t witness that punch, though. It had happened some days or weeks or months or years after my mother had taken me away in the night. \u201cWe\u2019re going home, gwus,\u201d she\u2019d said to me. Home. The reservation. After that last whack to his face, my father got dentures.\n\nWhen the court system shipped me off to visit my father during the summer, I watched him fall asleep on his cigarette-burnt couch with his dentures in. Each inhale and exhale, his new set of teeth popped in and out of his mouth. He never used Poligrip, that pink goo that holds teeth in tight and makes a mess.\n\nMy mother uses Poligrip. She refuses to go without it, and it has to be zinc-free. She had had healthy teeth\u2014wonderful teeth! In time, however, she lost her teeth to a terrible, terrible curse: lupus. First it was one tooth, the upper right lateral, that faded to a light brown and then to black-ink black. It was yanked out, and she got a flipper that she\u2019d set on her bedroom nightstand at bedtime. \u201cHere,\u201d I\u2019d say in the early morning, holding her tooth in my little tiny hand. \u201cYou get up?\u201d She\u2019d smile sleepily, a dark space in her teeth, and she\u2019d take her tooth from my hand. \u201cWoliwoni, gwusis,\u201d she\u2019d say. Thank you, my little tiny boy. Some years or months or weeks or days later my mother\u2019s teeth, one by one, were pulled out. I had sat in the living room in our little yellow house, miles away from the one in our blue house on that dead-end road, and I\u2019d hear my mother in the bathroom gagging and gagging as her mouth got used to wearing dentures. She came out, defeated, and sat at the kitchen table. She didn\u2019t cry silently like some moms do. I went into the bathroom, saw the stiff teeth on the chipped porcelain sink. I picked them up, rinsed them good, and then popped them in my mouth over my own teeth. \u201cMa,\u201d I\u2019d said, gagging and laughing. She turned to me with wide wet eyes and burst out laughing, her gums red and raw and stitched.\n\nWhen was my mother cursed? It\u2019s funny that no one had got hold of her teeth\u2014not even a sharp sliver of enamel\u2014before my mother was forced to get them all removed. Of course, someone could have cursed her after that, considering she seemed to be cursed just every other day\u2014from bacterial meningitis, a coma, a spiral break in her leg, being in a wheelchair for eight months, arthritis, a twenty-six-page report of notes on the brain damage\u2014all this in a matter of three years, and still the curse goes on. She\u2019s cursed so bad that, as she said jokingly once, \u201cI don\u2019t even get flowers anymore when I\u2019m in the hospital.\u201d\n\nMy mother\u2019s fifty-second birthday fell two days after my appointment with my aunt, and I remember well the strong wind that blew through the night and cut through trees, leaving the woods bare and damp. For her birthday, I bought her a new TV since the last one blew out because of a thunderstorm, and I used what money I had left to buy some Thai noodles\u2014meats don\u2019t go well with her (it\u2019s in the twenty-six-page report).\n\nWhile I got my mother a TV and clumpy Thai noodles, my sister\u2014\u201cyour sister,\u201d Mom calls her\u2014got my mother a gift: a spreading rumor that our mother is a lesbian. Not to be overdramatic, but my sister\u2019s appearances in my life are like my wisdom teeth: rotting, and no good news comes from them. Or perhaps my sister\u2019s appearances are like her own teeth: a week before my appointment with my aunt, my sister had to get all of her top teeth yanked out.\n\nWhen I was twelve, in our little yellow house on the Reservation, my sister lived with us. She told me the story of her \u201cvisit\u201d to the Mohawk Reservation. The trip was meant to be her attending a rehab facility but led to her dating a man named Doo\u2019Dook, lots of peyote, and a curse she\u2019d found next to her as she sat outside on the cold cement steps one chilly morning: a jar full of corn and hair and teeth.\n\nJust as I found funny my mother not being cursed but inflicted with lupus, I find amusing my sister\u2019s problem: Is it a curse? Did the jar contain some gelid black magic that dispersed over her like a bucket of water? Or are my sister\u2019s ailments the beginning contour of her road in life?\n\nI do it. I roll my wet tongue over my rotting wisdom tooth, and in the dark of my mouth the hole in my tooth feels as wide and as deep as a canyon. But there is no canyon, just a yellowed tooth that is rotting from the top of the crown and burrowing on down to my roots.\n"
