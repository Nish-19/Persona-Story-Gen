        "story": "Luisa Cruz\nI\u2019m the Mommy now and it\u2019s dark and I can\u2019t see my babies it\u2019s so dark but I know they\u2019re all around me I can hear them breathing and I can hear a siren somewhere and I can hear the slow drip of a faucet and a thin scrabbly little scurrying in the walls and my babies huddle close to me and I pull off my shirt so one of them can take my nipple if she\u2019s hungry and the siren goes past out in the street and one of my babies coughs sharply and I feel it in my own chest, rasping there, and my hands stir I want to reach out and pull her close to me but my limbs are very heavy and I try to lift an arm but I can\u2019t I am the mommy but my body is so very heavy and now one of them comes to me and my arms move at last I pull her body to me and it is very small and it is very soft and I open my eyes and there is a spatter of streetlight from the window and I look down and in my arms pressed against my naked breast is a rat\n\n\n\n\nAbraham Johnson\nA night on the ladder in Harlem and an infant in my arms a girl with a cough that was nothing to do with the fire and we come down through a thrash of smoke from a window and I canopy her face with my hand and I swear I can feel her breath on my palm this little girl who don\u2019t know nothing yet about nothing and then she is safe and I am up the ladder and coming back down with that girl\u2019s mother who is clinging to my back and trembling and she\u2019s weeping and it was nothing to do with the fire and we come down through the smoke and her breath is in my ear and she knows everything about everything and then she is safe and I am safe and that\u2019s all I intend to think about\n\n\n\n\nHazel Crum\nPond\u2019s, my dear, Pond\u2019s Vanishing Cream Mama would say beware of the little flaws that make one homely, she rubbing the cream into her face, looking at me in the mirror before her, the white streaks melting into her, smelling faintly of roses even as\nPapa is at some barrelhouse with another woman and Mama\u2019s not saying a word about that except I pull the covers over me for the screaming that comes in the middle of the night but all the while her face is at its loveliest from the skin-softening skin-whitening ingredients of Pond\u2019s and I think to steal the little jar of it tomorrow and rub myself till I vanish, but now I touch it to my naked butt cheeks and Stanley will come and he will drink and he won\u2019t say a word but before we go out, before the neon and the jukebox and the Blatz and a pack of Luckies, he will touch these cheeks of mine, digging in them with his fingertips, and he will cry out how fine I am, and I know he means I am finer than his wife\n\n\n\n\nJimmy Grecco\nYou think I\u2019d be caught in the company of men while carrying a pistol like that you got to be crazy so if it was in my coat pocket it was somebody else threw it in there, my mama emptying her purse maybe, she\u2019s got good reason to walk around with a pistol even if it\u2019s small cause the streets are full of mutts who\u2019d do their own mother much less somebody else\u2019s, so if it was still hot and smelling of powder maybe she threw it in my pocket after shooting at some mutt trying to steal her purse, which is self-defense so don\u2019t go thinking I\u2019m ratting out my own mama, and if somebody says it was my hand they saw holding that little runt of a pistol I want to know how they can say that since the thing\u2019s so small you couldn\u2019t see if it was a pistol in my hand or a stalk of celery instead, and if it was in the vicinity of Benny the Bull, that faccia di stronzo who can\u2019t let a guy pass by without some comment about his suit or his hair or some girl he might be sweet on, and if somebody says there was a puff of smoke from my hand and a popping sound, and if it was about three inches from Benny\u2019s ear hole where even a little slug would find some work to do for the good of humanity in general, then I ain\u2019t saying a thing except that sometimes justice is done on this earth and they should throw the guy who does it a party\n"
