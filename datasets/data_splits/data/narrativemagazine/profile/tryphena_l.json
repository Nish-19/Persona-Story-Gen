        "story": "Kids my age have questions about the most mundane things\u2014how far is the sky from our heads? And when we stretch our hands high enough, can we reach it? First I wanted to be a pilot, but now I am convinced I\u2019ll grow up to become a nurse and nothing else. I spend my days putting pills into categories based on their colors and I already know words like dementia, seizure, and disorientation. I know exactly what to do when Papa has a seizure in the middle of the night and Mother is at the pub with her singer friends or at the police station for drunk driving. Or at another man\u2019s house. It\u2019s always a struggle at the start but I manage to loosen his shirt and turn him on his side to keep his airway clear. And then I grab a jacket from the back of the door and fold it under his head.\n\nToday I\u2019m making soup for Papa, as I stand on a stool and squint to read the recipe in mother\u2019s crabbed handwriting. Onions, cloves of chopped garlic, and dandelion leaves\u2014the only meal Papa will eat without throwing up. Through the window, I see friends from school playing outside. They\u2019re running around a burst pipe, soaking themselves wet. In this game, the one who wins is the boy who gets the least soaked by the sprinkling. There are days we\u2019d run around the neighborhood digging in the dirt, searching for loose pipes we can burst with stones. Such a stupid game, and yet I hate that I\u2019m stuck inside this kitchen stirring a pot of soup.\n\nLike I\u2019ve been taught, I fetch two ladles of soup into a bone-china bowl my parents received on their fifth anniversary and walk down the hall imagining the gold-painted brushes designed on the bowl turning into tiny snakes. In my head, they slither into the pool of soup and float on the surface.\n\nI walk into Papa\u2019s room, which is also now my room, and set the bowl on his bedside. I haven\u2019t slept in my bed in six months. The room has changed so much since Papa\u2019s illness. The floor, made of hard, unpolished wood, has light stains from Papa\u2019s vomit, and a carpet sits rolled to the far end of the room. Mother says, \u201cWe\u2019ll roll this back when your father gets well,\u201d and every time I wonder if she means it. I walk toward the bed and see that Papa\u2019s eyes are still closed. I know he\u2019s waiting for me to cup his cheeks in my hands, and so I do. This used to be my favorite part of the day\u2014watching him open his eyes to me, for me. Papa would always tell me, \u201cKanea a w\u2019ani di kan tua no na ehia.\u201d It matters the first light you see.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s my big boy doing?\u201d His weak voice fills my ears and I try not to look away.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d I say. \u201cI made you soup and the boys are playing outside.\u201d\n\nHis eyes grow wild in shock, as they always do when I tell him about all the things I\u2019m missing by staying at home.\n\n\u201cWhat are you still doing here? Little boys belong outside. Playing and running. Chasing after what they\u2019re chasing after.\u201d\n\nThis is the same response he gives me every time, and I know it by heart. I help him sit up on the hard bed and I bring a full spoon to his lips. \u201cEat, Papa.\u201d He opens his mouth slightly to be fed.\n\nThere are days I want my first light to be a gush of fresh water from a broken pipe, win or lose. I have thought many times of leaving the soup on the stove to burn and watching the snakes drown in the heat. More than once I have wanted to stand at the door and watch, doing nothing, while Papa\u2019s seizure shakes the room. As for Mother, I think about rolling her up in her lavish carpet, never to see her again. But I don\u2019t run. Perhaps because I have more fear than courage or an equal measure of both to keep me in this room, cleaning my Papa\u2019s body with a wet towel, drying foam from the edges of his mouth, and saying a different name every time he looks at me and goes, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n"

One night, as the youngest crawls toward the stream, you feel the stillness of the air shift\u2014something is coming, and it demands an answer.",
        "story": "He has his hands on Nii\u2019s throat, and this time I do not stop them. They\u2019re fighting over the last sugarcane, and Nii has it held tightly between his teeth, the juice from the cane dripping down his shorts. I am more concerned about how many more days he\u2019ll be wearing the shorts unwashed, with its stain, than Ayikwe choking him to death. As if trapped inside a curse, my brothers and I have, since Mother\u2019s passing, tasted famine in seasons of abundance. They call it a taboo\u2014that a woman will go into labor and lose her life, especially when the child survives. \u201cHow is it possible that the same channel of life can know death?\u201d they\u2019ll say to one another. \u201cThe baby must have sucked out her last breath.\u201d Sometimes they\u2019ll curse and plead their favor, \u201cChai! Between my dead body and a cursed child, may God choose me.\u201d And hence the banishment of my family.\n\nThey did not come chasing us out of our home with machetes, as I\u2019ve been told of the past. But the signs were evident that they wanted us gone. At my kiosk in the market central, a scarecrow had been planted, its ripped white shirt besmirched with rotten tomatoes. The boys wondered why none of their friends would play with them. Once a boy in the neighborhood said Ayikwe was just a sacrificed clot of blood, and Ayikwe responded by digging his tiny fist into the boy\u2019s cheek. A nightmare also kept repeating itself: that while we slept, townspeople gathered around our hut and, circling us in silence, lit a match. They set us on fire and lifted up their hands in thanksgiving. There was never smoke, just our cries filling the air. I couldn\u2019t let that happen, and so in the first week of August, we folded everything we owned, which wasn\u2019t much, into two sacks, and with a six-month-old baby strapped to my back, we made our way through the farms and into the outskirts of the village.\n\nNii is six and Ayikwe just turned eleven. For his birthday I read him Mother\u2019s favorite prayer, which we all know by heart, days spent kneeling on a mat speaking the words slowly, rehearsed and without meaning. He insists I read it, saying, \u201cYou sound just like Ma. It is comfort.\u201d\n\n\u201cComforting,\u201d I say and begin to read from the back of an envelope that contains Bible verses and written prayers to God:\n\nLord, make me an instrument of your peace:\nwhere there is hatred, let me sow love;\nwhere there is injury, pardon;\nwhere there is doubt, faith;\nwhere there is despair, hope;\nwhere there is darkness, light;\nwhere there is sadness, joy.\n\nO divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek\nto be consoled as to console,\nto be understood as to understand,\nto be loved as to love.\nFor it is in giving that we receive,\nit is in pardoning that we are pardoned,\nand it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to die,\u201d Nii says, and I smile at him, the baby\u2019s head resting easy on my chest. We named him Joseph. Actually, Ayikwe did, after his favorite Bible character. I didn\u2019t object. At the time, I was spending days and nights in the clinic, signing papers I didn\u2019t understand and wishing everything to be over. It was a relief to come back home with a baby who already had a name picked out and a coat of many colors, a faded Ankara cloth my mother owned. Sometimes I wonder if Joseph will be the beam of light, the one who rises above the storm and saves us from drowning. At the back of my mind, although I resist thinking such things, I toy with the idea of selling him, although I\u2019m sure no one will pay for a womb\u2019s curse. I know I\u2019ll be sorry for harboring such thoughts. Nothing would be the same without him, but, frankly, selling him would be the best thing to happen to the boys and me. We could return home, just the three of us. I could have my kiosk in the market again and Ayikwe could grow maize on the farm. We could eat and laugh and be accepted.\nYou would think that by fifteen, life had dealt me enough, given me my share of its troubles\u2014leaving school to trade in the market with my mother and coming home to cook for a family, which reduced my life to servitude. And now to be responsible for my brothers\u2019 lives when I can barely carry my own is something I never wanted.\n\nWe\u2019ve been in the woods twelve days. A meandering stream froths beside us. The boys have dug out groundnut and found a dead fish or two they could make nothing of. I\u2019ve eaten very little. For Joseph, I pick green leaves and grind them between my palms and force it down his mouth. He spits most of it out. I can hear the boys splashing their legs in the stream, and I allow myself to weep for the first time since everything. It\u2019s a private mourning; I grieve the loss of my mother, the cruel townspeople, and my tired heart. When the day winds down, clouds stretch above us, expanding like an inflated body. I do not know what makes me do it, but I open up the envelope and pull out a letter. It is dated January 2003. Some lines have been crossed out and some shaded deeply. I wonder what kind of prayer said to God is revocable. What happens to the receipts? We swallow back our words out of fear and like to believe God keeps no record. I cannot think of why Mother will want some prayers returned to her, but I know it is no way a lack of faith. Yet, here in these letters, she bleeds a softness I\u2019ve never known: God, life is so cursed out here. Do you hear me? The darkness comes after me and I run. Look, I am breathless. I am salt and light of the earth but also scared. Please stop the chase.\n\nAnyone who knows grief knows mourning before death: we prepare for sorrow before it finds us, we wrap our arms around our bodies, rocking back and forth in the silence. In the night Joseph leaves my side. He crawls around his brothers and heads downward, as if being summoned. I keep my eyes tightly shut and try to think about many things\u2014Mother finding him and taking him away, the stream disappearing, Joseph\u2019s hand on my face soiled with mud, pulling me to himself. My heart thumps against my chest with heavy resignation, pinning me down. I know when he reaches the stream. The stillness in the air is sharp and frightening. I can hear myself breathing. I know when he lets himself into the cold water because he begins to cry, loudly, wailing. Nii stirs slightly, awakened by the noise, and I stretch my arm to pat him on the back, hushing him and whispering, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, now, just a bad dream.\u201d I know when the war ends because the crying stops, and a strange calmness settles over me. Trembling, I open my eyes, and the sky, an empty, borderless page, looks down at me, and I dare God to finally speak.\n"
