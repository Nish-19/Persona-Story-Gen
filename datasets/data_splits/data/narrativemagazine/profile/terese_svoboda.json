        "writing_prompt": "A retired lawyer turned small-town judge navigates quirky cases, stubborn defendants, and his daughter's sharp wit, all while grappling with the weight of justice and the peculiarities of prairie life.",
        "story": "A deer came right through the windshield, her father says, and taps the stretch of glass in front of him. Came right through, and knocked the guy into the backseat.\n\nThe deer was dead on impact? she asks.\n\nCome on, he chuckles, pushing the car lighter in. What saved the guy was not wearing a seat belt. First thing, the car ran up onto the train tracks.\n\nOf course a train was coming.\n\nSomebody going the other way stopped and dragged him off just in time. If he\u2019d had that seat belt on, he would have been pinned inside.\n\nHis seat belt swings limply against the car wall, where it has been sprung from its buzzer. I rest my case, she says. I\u2019ll watch for deer instead.\n\nHe laughs and lights his cigar.\n\nWhat do they call those small white birds that sit on the backs of the cows? she asks.\n\nIbis, he says, between puffs. Just like in Africa.\n\nShe pulls idly at the dangling seat belt. I knew that, she says.\n\nHe drives past a windmill, the single perpendicular in any direction, its blades chopping the air in blurred circles. From inside the car, no other sign of wind is evident across the empty prairie except for the car\u2019s shuddering on the county correction curves. Look at those pretty polka-dot horses, he says, by way of staying awake.\n\nThat\u2019s what they call pinto, right? she says.\n\nAppaloosa. Pinto\u2019s for the beans. I grow beans. Those are pinto beans.\n\nHe sticks her free arm toward the scraggly rows that fight the brush. Some days I like growing beans better than judging. Judging gives me a stomachache.\n\nIn Africa, she says, all the cases come to you\u2014or else you get borne on a litter to the next one.\n\nWhat a good idea\u2014the weight of justice on the plaintiff\u2019s neck. He knocks ash off his cigar. That sure would shorten up a case or two.\n\nA small town reveals itself a mile off, signaled by a long stretch of fence posts covered, each one, by a cowboy boot. He slows when they come to the town\u2019s single intersection, turns down its one street, and parks in front of an old schoolhouse marked caf\u00e9.\n\nThis is what education\u2019s come to, he says. Or else they turn the schools into junk stores full of antiques\u2014this one\u2019s antique food.\n\nWhen they enter, the prosecuting attorney lifts his coffee spoon toward them from the first booth. You\u2019re late, he says, with a smile that looks easy.\n\nIf I\u2019m early, I have to pay the check, he says. My daughter, the one out of Africa.\n\nWelcome back, says the attorney, shaking hands. Not much of a tan.\n\nIt\u2019s been ten years, she says.\n\nA person gets marked, says her father. She\u2019s a marked woman.\n\nDad, she says. That\u2019s right out of the movies.\n\nA masculine blonde swings out two plastic-coated menus by way of a signal and herds them into the booth. The three of them turn their faces up to her as she pulls a green guest check out of her waistband. Nothing special today, she says.\n\nThey order, and the waitress writes nothing down.\n\nThe attorney sighs into his coffee cup. Did you know, my dear, that right here is the richest town per capita outside of Saudi Arabia. I mean it\u2014with the cattle market the way it is. And they can\u2019t even put together a decent lunch. Probably just like in Africa.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t hard to order lunch in Africa, she says. You ate what there was.\n\nThe attorney looks at her father. She sure is one of yours.\n\nShe\u2019s not around much anymore. I blame that on her trip. He smiles and pulls napkins out of the container. So who\u2019s done what to whom this week? What happened to the harassment?\n\nOut of court. They moved in with each other.\n\nAh, crime, her father says, rubbing his hands across the napkins. She files a complaint every time she\u2019s in season.\n\nAs regular as a bear, says the attorney. Pardon me, he says to her.\n\nWe\u2019re out of vegetables, interrupts the waitress, unloading her forearm of plates. How about crackers as a substitute? She offers sealed Saltines.\n\nWith pickle relish? says her father. That\u2019ll qualify.\n\nShe leaves six packets of crackers, and they eat slabs of meat and mounds of starch, and the attorney picks his teeth. I heard about you, he says. You worried your father.\n\nNot Dad, the guy who won\u2019t wear a seat belt.\n\nSeat belts? That\u2019s just another thing those car people make you pay for. You know his problem? The attorney points his toothpick at her father\u2019s forehead. He\u2019s got imagination. He\u2019s a soft-hearted bastard who gets bad dreams. Am I right, or what?\n\nHer father pats the ketchup off his face. I\u2019m just a farmer with opinions. That\u2019s why they elected me.\n\nRight. The attorney leans forward. Just one of the best lawyers in this part of the country. When are you going to stick this judging business and get back to some real law?\n\nThat\u2019s laying it on a little thick. Her father waves at the waitress and points at his cup.\n\nThe coffee\u2019s actually good, says the attorney.\n\nThe waitress pours three lukewarm cups, then, with great flourish, signs her name to the bottom of the check and places it onto the table.\n\nThe attorney picks it up.\n\nWhat? Paying for poison? Her father laughs. That\u2019s what I call influencing the judge. He slaps him on the shoulder and takes the check away.\n\nThey file out of the caf\u00e9 onto the half-buried cracked sidewalk and blink into the sun. So that was fine. Her father moves his belt a notch and retucks his shirt. See you next week.\n\nOh, there\u2019s just one little thing. The attorney finds a document he\u2019s stuck in the folds of his newspaper. They\u2019re in jail now if you want to have a talk with them.\n\nHer father glances at the paper, and then again, rubbing his eyes behind his glasses. A dog case? You need an autopsy for a dog case?\n\nHey, says the attorney. It could\u2019ve died in Kellen County and turned out to be somebody else\u2019s problem entirely.\n\nWith the attorney following them, they drive the three blocks to the county jail. How\u2019s your digestion? she asks.\n\nGuilty, he says. He turns the car onto the upgrade next to the sheriff\u2019s car. Three young men loiter under a tree in front.\n\nJust look at the silver on that one, she says. It\u2019s a wonder they can stand upright.\n\nRodeo awards, says her father. They make the buckles bigger every year.\n\nThey\u2019re friends of the accused, says the attorney, coming around to the jail door. There\u2019s a cow meet this afternoon, and we\u2019ve got the best wranglers inside.\n\nYou do have a little something, says her father.\n\nOh, boy, says the attorney, holding the door open for them.\n\nThe sheriff is asleep at his desk as if he\u2019s being paid to do it. They don\u2019t bother him, they walk through a door marked Open where a bare lightbulb dangles overhead and two chairs meet a table. Just look at this, says the attorney.\n\nA county section map is tacked to the wall behind him. Pinned to it is a cutout of a collie. Red string radiates from its belly fur in a crazy crisscross. Here\u2019s the gas station, he says, pointing to a green-headed pin. And here\u2019s where we found the body. He presses a black-headed pin a foot away.\n\nYou just don\u2019t have enough to fuss around with here, do you? says her father.\n\nWell, says the attorney, yes.\n\nThat sure is a long way for a tail to keep burning, her father says, tracing the string.\n\nThey put the nozzle into her and gassed her up. The attorney fiddles with a chair back. Somebody had a match. After she caught, she tried to bite her rear end. The way they do.\n\nI get it. Her father ducks his head as if avoiding the cruelty. You don\u2019t have to stick around here if you don\u2019t want to, he says to her.\n\nShe shakes her head.\n\nHe turns back to the attorney. So, who do you want me to talk to?\n\nActually, the parents. They just want to leave some money and have the whole thing dismissed. They can pay, believe me.\n\nThat\u2019s letting them off pretty easy, says her father, taking a Tums. The punishment should fit the crime I think. Like they do in Africa.\n\nI don\u2019t know, she says. An eye for an eye?\n\nPunishment? The attorney looks nervous. They\u2019ll fight it.\n\nHer father looks disgusted as if the attorney himself did the job on the dog. Let them go to the Supreme Court for all I care. Big deal. First off, collect the bail. You can make that big. Then they\u2019ll get to half-strangle calves in the rodeo and be happy. I\u2019ll come back in a week when it cools down a little and try them.\n\nIf you say so, says the attorney.\n\nHer father looks out the window at the rodeo contestants. And remember, this isn\u2019t settled out of court like your bear woman. This is the State versus a bunch of mean rich kids.\n\nThe attorney fools with his tie clip. I\u2019ll tell them.\n\nThey drive to the next outpost where at least there is a Dairy Queen, and drink malts leaned up against the hot car. I\u2019ll have each of them tied to a dog for a week, day and night, her father says. The first I hear of any abuse, they\u2019ll really pay.\n\nAh, civilization, she says.\n\nHe\u2019s fumbling around for a new cigar. You know, he says, my stomach feels better now that I\u2019ve decided on a sentence. Maybe I could get used to this judging.\n\nIn Africa where I went, if the judge turns out to be wrong, he has to serve the sentence.\n\nHe raises his eyebrows like he doesn\u2019t have to believe her. Why did I waste all that worry on you?\n\nYou never worry, she says, her straw making noise at the bottom of the cup.\n\nHe lit his cigar. Maybe. He looked at her over his puffing. But maybe I drive a little slower when I have you around.\n\n"

        "story": "Five of us boys come up thirsty. Maybe it\u2019s the Jap dark, the way it settles into the countryside, creeps along through the rickrack trees and all the snow until we are just barely swallowing. Or it\u2019s the thirst we have from looking at the walls of the barracks and thinking maybe we are the ones who gave up and got caught. But no\u2014if we can thirst, we can act on it. Not that we ourselves have done much in the action department, no, we are strictly mop-up.\n\nGates\u2014he\u2019s at least fifteen\u2014the hooch is his idea. You can sign out and chew down the sulfa prophylactics they give you even when you are just going off to church, you can walk into town and hope for Parcheesi with your glass of sissy fizz\u2014or you can pay top Jap dollar for a farmer to dig up a stone jar full of pepper juice, a fuel you have never thought to actually drink in your life, Gates tells us\u2014and that farmer, we have heard, can only be roused at the end of this shortcut Gates has heard about.\n\nI don\u2019t like Gates as a rule. He doesn\u2019t like me. As MPs we get more opportunity to express ourselves in these matters and we have, he and I, so I am all for any other plan, except Wheezer, a blond dooser of a lumberjack who I know a little from basic, has drunk this farmer\u2019s homemade wine and makes a sound so happy about it, I fall in.\n\nSnow in the dark is a good thing though the moon too would\u2019ve been a help. After we circle this barracks\u2019 wall that has taken us a month to nail up it is that big around, Gates finds the beaten-down path he is talking about even in all this snow and we follow him, single file.\n\nGates talks a mile a minute, the way you would in a place like this, all done up with tombs and look-alike Buddha statues and stick markers. We follow mostly his voice. A regular tour guide, he is telling us why they like to put this up when all they do is cremate. I don\u2019t know how Gates knows anything about anything, he is too young even to be drinking let alone educating us all about it, but he could\u2019ve been older, which is part of why we don\u2019t get along, his age could be a lie too.\n\nSo what if they believe their ghosts rise up and drink blood\u2014we are the victors.\n\nWheezer knows enough to walk between us, and the other two just trudge along, watching their rears like Gates is right.\n\nWonder how a place like this didn\u2019t get hit, says Gates.\n\nThey\u2019re already dead, I say. The others get the joke but their laughs aren\u2019t much against all their fast left right left.\n\nThe farmer is asleep just as Gates predicts and we have to wake up the whole family plus the farm animals. But no dogs. I guess they ate the dogs a while back, but the doves and a rooster they keep in cages. The wife talks and we nod while the farmer goes off somewhere secret with a shovel, that is to say, Gates and I try to get the liquor for a little less than they want and the wife knows better and makes sure we don\u2019t see where it\u2019s kept. She\u2019s our age, half our size, and with a nice front. We wave clumps of bills an inch thick like we know exactly what\u2019s what but she sticks to her guns and asks for more. How does she know we can\u2019t do the calculations? asks Wheezer. Do we look that dumb? The other two peel off more bills, they don\u2019t care, the whole thing is a show to them.\n\nWe sit down in their sort of bedroom, the kind without a bed, and play cards while we wait.\n\nWhen the farmer turns up, he\u2019s got a grin across his face that his wife lights into. We just hope he hasn\u2019t sampled the jar to the bottom. He lets us into a shed next to his house\u2014a lot of dry leaves draped overhead\u2014and gives us cups to go with the jar that still has straw hanging from it. Gates pushes up his sleeves and goes at it, pouring and pretending to speak the way they do. Pretty soon all five of us are pretty fluent. Gates says let\u2019s get the wife up and you know and Wheezer says we\u2019re all MPs right? But I tell Gates he\u2019s too young to know what to do and he says Bastard under his breath and with the cold this whole cloud of Bastard rises up when he lays his gun on the table.\n\nWe are only allowed guns when we guard prisoners outside the barracks so this is a surprise. But then one of the two guys pulls out another one. I\u2019ll double you, says the guy, like it is a bet. Looking at Wheezer, I guess I\u2019m the only one out of the picture. Gates deals another hand. The revolvers sit in the moonlight between them like two holy things, and I\u2019ve been to church services that weren\u2019t as quiet as this game. We all sip at our drinks and look at our cards.\n\nGates wins, takes the other gun, and relaxes.\n\nI thought the occupation was some kind of job, says Wheezer, dealing again.\n\nA job where you really get under somebody\u2019s skin, says Gates. He is looking through the door the farmer left open into where the woman is lying on her side beside her husband, her eyes watching.\n\nI never think of the Japs as having ghosts, I say.\n\nIt\u2019s no bunch of malarkey to them, says Gates. His cards must not look so good, he doesn\u2019t bet the guns.\n\nI play real slow. You know when we talk, I say, they don\u2019t look at us.\n\nDo you think they could be listening? says one of the other two.\n\nThey could be, says Gates. Their language is pretty tough compared to ours, they could be catching on. He asks for another card.\n\nMaybe they know what we are thinking too, says Wheezer, and folds.\n\nGates takes the pot. Oh, mama-san, he says, and gets up.\n\nIt is Wheezer\u2014not me\u2014who kicks Gates in the groin, kind of by accident. While he\u2019s rolling around swearing like a sonofabitch, reaching for those guns that I stand in front of, mama-san comes in the door in a rush as if she\u2019s concerned, but before anyone can pull her in, she makes it known that someone Big is coming.\n\nWheezer and me and Gates, we take our time. We are MPs after all and nobody but a major can trouble us. I\u2019m sure she would\u2019ve made the sign for major if she knew it because Gates gets her by the waist and tries to lick her face.\n\nThen we hear the jeep. Majors do have jeeps.\n\nWheezer and Gates race off along the edge of the cemetery, way ahead of me because I have to take a leak or die and do so despite everything, against what I think is a small tree but turns out to be carved and dead. Not that I am so concerned with the foliage. By the time I put some ground under me and catch up, they are already mired to their waists in an honest-to-god honey wagon.\n\nThis is about the funniest thing. These vats are right level with the ground so as to be convenient for the user but hard to spot for somebody who isn\u2019t savvy to them, especially in all this snow. Gates and Wheezer are coated all over with the slick of it, and Gates is actually sinking further down. I am not about to help him but after I pull out Wheezer, I see Gates really is having a time of it, his eyes are open that wide, so I find one of those bamboo poles and hold it out to him.\n\nSomehow it hits him on the head.\n\nI am crying now, with tears I am laughing so hard. Once he\u2019s on his feet, Wheezer and I throw snowballs at him. At first he pops back a few really hard ones, then he rubs the snow into the shit on his chest like it\u2019s a target. By then someone\u2019s coming and we all pick up our feet through the snow the way those football stars do, in and out of tires, for practice, only this time we go straight through the middle of the cemetery, we dodge all the pagodas and statues and raised cement and once a real fox and of course the big trees everywhere, bare branched or green spiked, shaking and moaning with Gates\u2019s ghosts, all those dead Japs who would like us dead, and since we don\u2019t really know which way is home or where the next honey wagon sits, it takes us a long time, especially with the clouds that keep on covering up that little moon.\n\nThe other two shoot off the guns somewhere in the dark.\n\nEven then we think nobody sees us.\n\n"
