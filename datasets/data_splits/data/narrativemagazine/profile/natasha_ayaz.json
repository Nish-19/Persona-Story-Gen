        "writing_prompt": "On a cold, desolate highway under a fading night sky, you flee a stranger's trailer with nothing but a stolen watch and the weight of a night you can't quite name\u2014what are you running from, and what are you running toward?",
        "story": "Once, on a small beach in Nowhere, Australia, when I was seventeen years old, a boy who wanted my mouth tight around him told me there were no jellyfish in the water when in fact there were poisonous many. I swam with him, letting him eat the skin around my bathing suit with his eyes. He kept his hefty watch on while he swam, the silver dial distorting the light, making it difficult to hold eye contact. When we emerged, the shore was littered with luminous discs, hundreds of toxic blue jellies lying washed up like evil eyes. I should have been stung, but I wasn\u2019t, and that was one of many lessons regarding men who cannot save you and the universe which can.\n\nHaving nowhere else to go for the night, I knew I was staying with him in his trailer. On the way back from dancing on tables in the town\u2019s one bar, we walked along the highway under a black swath of sky. It was so cold that I imagined the scorching Australian sun had turned subterranean, deserting this pocket of the cosmos entirely. I thought about how when I was a child, my mother locked every window and door at night, bolts shut tight. Even then, I had this creeping idea that the monsters she feared were not the ones in my picture books. I\u2019m freezing, I said to the boy, I\u2019m not going to make it. The forests on the side of the road were dark and throbbing. Don\u2019t be a baby, he said, we\u2019re almost there. Navigating the trailer park at night felt like a raid on a strange village. The trailers stood like sleeping bulls. I stepped behind him quietly, fearing the sorts of things I might wake up if I were too loud. Inside the trailer, he didn\u2019t set up a second cot, instead lying before me on his own white mattress in the shadows of the damp night: assuming.\n\nAfter, I watched the stripes of light from the moon on the trailer ceiling until they turned the alleviating color of 5:00 a.m. I pulled my shorts from beneath the sleeping stranger, rolled my belongings into my backpack, and tiptoed toward the door. A bubbling rise in his snore made me turn back. He lay across the bed diagonally; his exposed arm an L of flesh on the sheets, his watch on the bedside table a pool of metallic light. I set my pack by the door, stepped lightly toward the bed, and stood over his motionless face. There was no part of it familiar. His hands were foreign lands that had held me. He was no one. The watch was cool in my grip, all smooth edges. It stayed in my hand like a talisman against trailer demons while I ran back through the park and down the highway until I reached the lot where the bus would come.\n\nThe stars are never so beautiful as when they are almost gone. They are never so moving as when they are spread like white diamonds on brightening velvet above a highway parking lot. After the boy\u2019s trailer, when I let his body enter mine in the teenage fog of obligation, the parking lot was a holy space. I can count on the fingers of one hand the moments in life when I\u2019ve matched the momentum of time, but back then under a sky that shimmered, I didn\u2019t know how sacred was that symmetry. On my wrist I fastened the silver watch as tight as it would go while I waited for the Greyhound.\n"

        "writing_prompt": "Fifteen years after your father vanished with a woman in a yellow dress, you receive news of his death\u2014and with it, the haunting scent of roses begins to fill your home, no matter how tightly you seal the windows.",
        "story": "A July evening. Years ago, in the rose garden, his hands on a woman\u2019s dress.\n\nI will never forget the way they looked\u2014hands of a pianist, hands that pressed alcohol on my scrapes like holy water\u2014caught there in the act of betrayal. I wished the woman\u2019s head would fall deftly from her neck to the grass. A trophy for my trouble. I stood in the rosebush behind the stone wall in Stintino, witnessing the dismemberment of my childhood. The roses were pink, not red. The color of a kitten\u2019s nose, or cold chicken breast. The woman\u2019s body bore through its constraints so that the silk bloomed into creases, syrupy yellow like limoncello. Despite my callow rage, I leaned closer, thorns against my fingers, stomach melting into my thighs. When my father began to inch the yellow dress upward, I turned and ran up the path to my house.\n\nIt had happened twice before: my witnessing. Once earlier that same summer and another time the summer before. Always in the rose garden, my father traced the waistlines of strange women. Every incident, I thought of my mother: wiping her hands on her orange skirt, smelling of cilantro, laughing at a line in one of the sizable novels she read. I thought of how my father touched my mother\u2019s face, fingers trailing her jaw, mapping familiar territory. Something about that touch was different than with the women in the garden, though I couldn\u2019t say what. I was too young to understand the intricacies of possession. I thought of how my mother\u2019s mouth would fall into an injured O, how she might never again hold my chin and say, \u201cYou look so like your father,\u201d and I could not tell her about the garden. I worried that, like the window-flying white birds I sometimes found lying on our balcony, the ones my mother called her little soldiers, she would die. I worried that her face, closer to a sister\u2019s than a mother\u2019s, would shrivel decades before my eyes. Back then I understood, probably through some fabular bedtime story, that knowledge could change appearances. I knew that the mind could disrupt the skin, sadness in symptoms. I began to look for evidence of my father\u2019s duplicity in his body. A persistent rash or a drooping eyelid. Any small blemish would have sufficed, but he remained beautiful as ever. From his forehead to his toenails, my father was perfect.\n\nThat last time I saw him in the garden, I heard him following me while I ran up the path. I have a theory that men walk with heavy footsteps. They don\u2019t care about disturbing the peace because the peace never occurred to them as important. Women, in my theory, walk with a tender footfall, toes kissing the ground. This generalization is based entirely on my parents. As I got older, I made an effort to think of my mother whenever my feet touched the earth. My tread grew light as a forest fox, out of respect for my mother and a conspiratorial urge to sneak up on my father. I fancied myself the secret police of my mother\u2019s regime. That summer night, I fled the scene barefoot, carrying my shoes, one in each hand. My father grabbed me by the collar at the base of an Aleppo pine and looked into my eyes, pointing a finger in my face.\n\n\u201cYou will not say anything to her. You don\u2019t know what you saw.\u201d\n\nI nodded. I didn\u2019t tell him that I had already caught him twice before, that on my own I had decided not to tell my mother, that I hoped his black hair would turn to wire and fall out. He made me put on my shoes. We walked home together. At the threshold of our house, he withdrew a single pink flower and presented it to my mother with a bow. She smelled it, smiled, and put it in an azure glass on the window sill. In the middle of the night, I left bed to throw the rose out the window and then close the window tight. By morning, a bird, body like a drop of milk, lay dead outside the glass like an omen.\n\nI never told my mother what I knew. When my father packed his bags a year later to live in another country with Yellow Dress, never to be seen by us again, my mother took me by the chin.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t lost a thing,\u201d she said.\n\nLast week, fifteen years after my father\u2019s departure, I received news that he had been found dead in the bathroom of a chalet in the alps. Stress cardiomyopathy. I spent the day scrubbing my apartment spotless and scouring my hands. In every room, I sealed the windows to suppress the sudden scent of roses, persevering through time like the truth.\n"
