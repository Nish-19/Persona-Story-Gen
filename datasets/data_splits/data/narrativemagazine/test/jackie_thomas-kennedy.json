        "story": "I have to call Georgia for help with the air conditioner. \u201cI thought I couldn\u2019t come over this weekend,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can lift it by myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d I can hear her washing dishes. \u201cSo I\u2019m allowed to come over if you need something.\u201d\n\nShe arrives within five minutes, as I knew she would. Under the brim of her straw hat her eyes are like peas in aspic. She has a dishcloth tucked into a pocket of her jeans. Georgia has never been married, but she is a better version of the wife I used to be. Her grocery lists say six damask plums where I would write fruit.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she says, taking the screen out of the window. \u201cI\u2019ll be gone by the time they get here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d I kiss her hand.\n\n\u201cIf you want to thank me, invite me to dinner tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say, but we both know I won\u2019t.\n\n\nColt arrives in tight jeans and a bolo tie, his father\u2019s old typewriter in his arms. He sets it on the kitchen table.\n\n\u201cYou guys can take my room. And yes, I put in the air conditioner.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know how you live without it.\u201d He takes his shoes off before he goes upstairs. That was one of his father\u2019s rules.\n\nI hold the front door open for my daughter-in-law and her suitcase. Her red hair is in a pompadour, left over from last night\u2019s party. When she kisses my cheek I smell coconut pomade.\n\n\u201cI asked him not to bring that,\u201d Vivian says, looking at the typewriter. \u201cHe could use a few days off from work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you like some juice? I have orange and pineapple.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thanks. Too much sugar.\u201d Vivian, all hip bones and rib cage, is afraid of sugar.\n\nI wait until she is upstairs before addressing the typewriter.\n\n\u201cGet out,\u201d I tell the well-worn keys. \u201cGet out.\u201d\n\n\nNothing that belongs to Oliver is allowed in my house. When he left me I held a tag sale on my front lawn. The first days passed without a single prospect. People were shy. They knew Oliver as the man who spread fireplace ashes on icy steps. They remembered when he cleared the road of tree branches after a hurricane. But I knew I could trust a free market. Was I really selling that guitar for five dollars? I was.\n\nI met Georgia at my sale, over a canvas bag of my wedding china. She\u2019d moved to the neighborhood a year before, and I knew as much about her as did everyone else on our street: she was a spinster who\u2019d made an enormous web of pulled cotton to cover her front windows at Halloween, and at Christmas she left icebox cookies in our mailboxes. She was wearing a souvenir T-shirt from Hollywood, and between her breasts a giant palm tree waved its sequined fronds.\n\n\u201cHow much for the china?\u201d she\u2019d said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anything for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much?\u201d\n\n\u201cZero dollars and zero cents.\u201d\n\nShe picked up a tempered-glass paperweight shaped like an abalone shell. \u201cI\u2019ll give you five dollars for this, and no less than fifty for the china.\u201d\n\nI was drinking a beer, which I set aside to count her change. \u201cThis isn\u2019t how bargaining usually works,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m stealing something,\u201d she said.\n\n\nColt comes downstairs with a copy of his novel in his hands.\n\n\u201cFound this by the tub. How far are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI started it.\u201d I unwrap a rack of spareribs and set them on a baking sheet. I regret, for a moment, that I sold Oliver\u2019s grill for a dime.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re offended by the title. I knew you\u2019d be offended.\u201d\n\nHe sits at the table and props one foot on a chair. This makes me miss his childhood. I kiss the top of his head.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say, \u201cthough I guess slut isn\u2019t one of my favorite words.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t bother me that Colt\u2019s book is called The Confessions of Slut Twenty-Three; nor does it bother me that Slut Twenty-Three, in the pages I\u2019ve skimmed, physically resembles Vivian. If what he writes is taken from their lives, Vivian randomly demands sex in parking lots, makes Colt wear her hosiery, and runs a blow-job clinic in the smoking garden of a local bar.\n\nI am not offended by his pedantic diagrams of sexual positions, or by the character named Mlle Fuck-You. It\u2019s the shrill, smug voice he picked up in college that I can\u2019t stand. His narrator, The-Man-in-Love-with-the-Slut, describes himself as \u201cyour average spoiled white kid from the suburbs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not a \u2018white kid from the suburbs,\u2019 \u201d I want to tell him. \u201cYou\u2019re from a small town nowhere near a city. You were raised to treat people decently. And your father and I never spoiled you.\u201d But I know\u2014I know, I know\u2014that this is not an autobiography.\n\nI believe Colt when he tells me that in certain circles he is famous. Once I suggested that those circles might be concentrated in Brooklyn, and my throat closed with guilt the moment I said it. Colt is my delight; he is my only child. For nine months I prayed for the healthy heart now beating under his shirt. As soon as I could hold him, heart and all, I sensed the futility of prayer. I knew that every time he was hurt it would be my fault.\n\n\nThey smoked a joint right before dinner while I picked green beans from the garden. Colt\u2019s elbows are on the table. He tells us, several times, that he would love it if some backwoods library in the Deep South banned his book.\n\n\u201cEnough about you,\u201d Vivian says.\n\n\u201cOkay. Tell Mom about your new business idea,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe have this dog park near our building, and the people are ridiculous. They dress the dogs in little quilted jackets. They give them the same kinds of names they give their kids: Jordan, Mason, Hunter, Taylor.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo ridiculous,\u201d Colt says.\n\n\u201cAnyway, there\u2019s a multilingual school down the street from the park. I thought maybe people would be into a multilingual class for dogs. Not like they think the dog is going to speak, but so a dog can follow commands in three or four languages.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am, but I\u2019m not. I think if we charged $75 per session, we might convince some people it\u2019s worth paying for. So that might be my project for the next six months.\u201d The look they exchange tells me this joke has been broken in, and that every time she tells it, Colt is charmed.\n\n\u201cWhat about you, Mom?\u201d he says. \u201cWhat do you see yourself doing in the next six months?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe some camping up in Acadia before it gets too cold.\u201d Georgia and I have been planning this trip for months.\n\n\u201cBut who would go with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, who would go with you?\u201d\n\nThey give me a pitying look. They think I am alone, and they think they are invincible. Vivian has no visible reaction to Colt\u2019s hand on the back of her neck. This is the smugness of having your lover beside you all the time. I want to tell her that being loved this much leaves no mark. If Colt rises from the table, she will look as lonely as I do.\n\n\nSometimes I wish Colt would find the whole thing abhorrent. Two women? Disgusting. His own mother? Disgusting. If he could back away from it, maybe I could tell him. But Colt and Viv would levitate with pleasure. They\u2019d sit there thinking they\u2019d finally figured me out: there\u2019s Mom, Judith, clear as an egg wash, a classic closet case. Maybe she\u2019s been waiting for Georgia her whole life.\n\nSurely Colt remembers the traffic jam. A westbound lane on the Sagamore Bridge, a cup of rum-raisin ice cream in his hand, his head out the window to watch the Cape Cod Canal churning with rain, traces of zinc oxide on his nose. He was eleven. He asked his parents, \u201cHave either of you ever been in love?\u201d\n\nOliver had just given me opal earrings for my birthday, suffered a lobster dinner on my behalf.\n\n\u201cOf course, son,\u201d he said, reaching back to tousle his hair.\n\nI couldn\u2019t stop wondering why Colt would ask us that.\n\n\u201cHe asks why we can\u2019t take vacation on a different planet. He asks why we can\u2019t drink saltwater. I wouldn\u2019t worry about this,\u201d Oliver said.\n\nWe were in the yard, the grass freshly mowed, mosquitoes biting freely as dusk unraveled. It was a Saturday, the night Oliver was allowed to get drunk. Colt was at a friend\u2019s house, observing marriages that were apparently stronger than mine.\n\n\u201cGive me a priss, kitty,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cStop worrying.\u201d\n\nI worried even more after that.\n\n\nI can see it now: Georgia in a souvenir T-shirt, a shade overweight, telling stories as if we\u2019ve been married for years. The three of them teasing me for voting Republican. \u201cI always knew there was a liberal in there somewhere,\u201d Colt will say. They will need a little less from me, a little more from each other; I in turn will need a little more from all of them.\n\nThey\u2019ll have cocktail hour while I drink club soda with lime. Georgia will mix vodka and grenadine, even though I\u2019ve told her it\u2019s tacky. She doesn\u2019t mind being teased, and she doesn\u2019t know how to be jealous, two of my favorite things about her. She indulges me when I need to talk about my married life. She knows how many buttons I had on my wedding dress. She knows that Oliver and I spent our wedding night at the Pioneer Hotel, with its misplaced neoclassical columns. The windows were jalousies, and there was only one towel in the bathroom. There was a folding screen, and I\u2019d felt obliged to change behind it, even though we\u2019d seen each other naked many times.\n\n\nI call Vivian to the bathroom after my shower. She is pleased. This is the kind of thing daughters-in-law do: they enter intimate spaces unflinchingly.\n\n\u201cTake a look at this mole,\u201d I tell her, pulling my robe away from my breast. \u201cI swear I didn\u2019t have it this morning.\u201d\n\nShe excuses herself to get her glasses from her handbag.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a mole, Judith. That\u2019s a tick.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like a mole.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s in there pretty deep.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, shit,\u201d I say. \u201cCan you get it out?\u201d\n\nFirst she tries tweezers, which I keep on a mirrored tray by the sink.\n\n\u201cThis fucker\u2019s really in there,\u201d she says.\n\nMy eyes are watery, my head hot.\n\n\u201cDo you think I might already have Lyme disease?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d she says, the first hint of a mother I\u2019ve ever seen in her.\n\nWhen Vivian worries the tweezers are making it worse, she asks Colt to bring matches. There are holes in the knees of her jeans, and her fingernails are painted gold. She has a scar on her arm from breaking a window when her father refused to give her his credit card. (She was, she has assured me, only twenty-two at the time.) This is the girl who holds a flame close to my skin.\n\nWhen she finally gets the tick out without starting a fire, I offer her fifty dollars. \u201cAn investment in your multilingual dog business.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust watch for a bull\u2019s-eye around the bite. If you see a bull\u2019s-eye, we\u2019ll need to go to the doctor in the morning,\u201d she says.\n\n\nI lie awake with all the lights on, watching for a bull\u2019s-eye.\n\nWhen Georgia can\u2019t sleep, I comb her hair. When I can\u2019t sleep, she tells me about her childhood. She has three older brothers. In their yard they had a set of dolphin-shaped swings that appeared to be caught by their chains. The Connecticut River sluiced the edge of their property. The swings were still there when Georgia drove me past the house this summer, but the place was dingy and run-down. One of the panes in the front door was sealed with a piece of cardboard, and someone had spray-painted the word keep on the side of the house.\n\n\u201cOh, well,\u201d Georgia said. \u201cMaybe some college students live there now.\u201d\n\nI could be that calm too, if I\u2019d never had to iron an impatient man\u2019s shirt or peel a soft-boiled egg for a screaming child. I am not the kind of woman who complains about the life she was meant to have: I was supposed to be handling shirts and eggs. My husband was supposed to be faithful.\n\nIn the years I was tending to Colt and Oliver, Georgia was serving her family as the quirky unmarried one. She drove her nieces and nephews to zoos. She bought them geodes and suspended prisms in their windows. If she ever meets my son, she will become his cheerful aunt. She\u2019s already read his novel twice.\n\n\u201cYou need to introduce me to Colt soon,\u201d she said recently. I was driving her home from the doctor\u2019s office. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of insulting.\u201d\n\n\u201cCould you turn the AC down? It\u2019s freezing in here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m too nice to give you a hard time about this, don\u2019t you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, but I laughed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, Judith. I\u2019m not afraid to piss you off.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t I know it,\u201d I said, but I am almost never mad at Georgia. It was Oliver who drew anger out of me. Oliver, capricious and unapologetic, a man who kept me guessing every day of our marriage.\n\nWhen we were first dating, I couldn\u2019t decide how to greet him. He never learned how to embrace. He let you press your body into his chest, but his arms were limp and useless. His firm handshake was so brief you couldn\u2019t tell if his skin was warm. That was me: choosing between one of his hands and two of his arms, weighing the trade-off, wanting more than I could get.\n\n"
