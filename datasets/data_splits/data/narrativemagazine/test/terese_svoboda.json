        "story": "Very intellectual, says Polly. The rollers in her hair, a dozen frozen-juice cans, make the satirical bob that follows dragonesque and fierce.\n\nThe paper\u2019s hopeless? I shuffle the pages in order, out of order.\n\nPolly uses an index finger to slide a single sheet out of the stack. The sad part is that it could have been any sheet, a fact Polly soon shares, pointing here and there in critique.\n\nI scramble to note every comment. I forgive her her tone\u2014a self-reflexive slip, really, how she covers her genius with generosity. We work until daylight, until I\u2019m caffeine-shaky at the keys and she\u2019s fixing footnotes. She lies across my bed, her long hair unspooling off the rollers, her fairest-of-them-all skin surrounding \u201cdevouring eyes\u201d\u2014an English-class description\u2014not to mention a set of knockers the covers only half-cover, nightgowns for her being too bourgeois and confining.\n\nI myself am wrapping my shoulders in a ruana, the South American blanket I wear to make my nightgown look like a peasant skirt\u2014that is to say, I\u2019m dressed\u2014when Dad calls.\n\nShe picks up. Mr. Schmeckler? They laugh, my dad just as amused by her pet name for him as she is, he being more Irish than Easter\u2014his phrase. They chat and she doesn\u2019t say a word about how hard she\u2019s worked all night for his errant daughter\u2014her phrase\u2014while I stir the discarded orange-juice cans in search of a paper clip.\n\nThey\u2019re arriving at three, she says in a beat, hanging up.\n\nYou could, like, let me talk too, I say over my toothbrush.\n\nShe casts her eyes up, where Somebody is surely noting my obtuseness. You were busy.\n\nEventually I head out, paper in hand, barefoot against the spring dew, so much dew my ruana, unwrapping, gets soggy. As I\u2019m leaving, Polly says we should get my parents to take us to Bunny\u2019s after graduation. Her prof treated her there last week, and she loved it.\n\nIt\u2019s like electricity, the way she loves and wants you in on it, a straight connection. It\u2019s a girls\u2019 college we\u2019re going to, but guys\u2014maintenance all the way to department heads\u2014know her name, they get the electricity too. With her by my side, I\u2019m not just another Mick on a scholarship. I can\u2019t finish papers for the life of me, but my analysis is great, or so she says.\n\nBut nix to the office drop-off, school\u2019s so over. I run on, ruana flapping, past one cul-de-sac of Americana after another, to my prof\u2019s house.\n\nPolly and I will be Two Broads Abroad again this summer, in England, a fellowship for her and teaching English to Asians for me\u2014don\u2019t ask. Last summer we drank beer in Munich and did her prof\u2019s research. That\u2019s when Dad took on this Schmeckler name. He showed up with flowers for us around August, just when we were running low on the stipend, about six marks short of giving up and flying home. I was surprised. Dad had never shown up before. I mean, he\u2019s never made any graduation of mine or my brother\u2019s, he was always working so hard, but last summer he was riding the \u201960s high on a contract for explosive bolts, something neither of us wanted to know about, being practically professional protesters of everything explosive. In for a day without a reservation, he slept on our couch. Polly kicked out the schnitzel-eating unexchanged student\u2014her phrase\u2014she was sleeping with. For virginity\u2019s sake, she said, even though Dad had already walked into our dorm room once before when it was overpopulated.\n\nMr. Schmeckler\u2019s sitting on my bed when I return from the prof\u2019s house.\n\nWhere\u2019s Mom?\n\nShe had an appointment. To get her hair done, he adds. That\u2019s as lame as it gets. His face goes ablaze with an Irish blush. We\u2019re divorcing, he says, as if that\u2019s what Mom\u2019s hair-doing is really for.\n\nI take Polly\u2019s bed. Catholics can\u2019t get a divorce, I say.\n\nMom\u2014\n\nPolly walks in. My Indian blouse looks great on her without a bra, eggs sunny-side up with nipples. Her big smile for Dad changes, seeing me.\n\n\nAt dinner they talk about the Vietnam War, how Johnson is bluffing, how contracts for bolts are increasing, and how evil he is, given that any contract will involve defense money. But the bolts protect the boys, he pleads to Polly, who is adamant that all manufacturing of anything out of that budget hurts someone. It\u2019s all entwined, she says, ordering another drink for herself. They drink a lot, and so do I. The three of us are loud enough that on our way back the watchman at the school gate reprimands Dad, who bows.\n\nI fall asleep on my bed without turning off my light, even before Dad leaves.\n\nMom doesn\u2019t call. I can\u2019t believe it. I am going to England for months, maybe even a year, and she doesn\u2019t even want to say good-bye, or tell me what\u2019s going on. I am devastated. Polly says not to call her, it isn\u2019t my place, a mother\u2019s supposed to console the daughter in a divorce. After all, I am the hurt one, whilst they go on their merry ways.\n\nDad doesn\u2019t show up in Europe this time, nor in the fall we decide to stay on for. Polly gets me through. We eat toad-in-the-hole and date Oxford men, and I find one that Polly tolerates, though he\u2019s Tasmanian, not really English. A devil nonetheless. We marry during a bright patch of winter on a hillside in Spain, with Polly at my side, along with the prof who supervised her, and several just-sheared sheep. My parents pitch in for the honeymoon in France but don\u2019t show, singly or together.\n\nPolly doesn\u2019t take the prof home but flies back to the grad school he helped her get into. When I return, I enroll for a law degree and don\u2019t see my parents for another three months, not until my brother calls me to report that my mother has taken to her bed. I visit and she\u2019s so ill she can\u2019t make me pancakes. I stay with my father instead, and his new wife, two years my junior. He sits me down in their living room and makes me read the divorce papers as a test of the new legal knowledge he is paying for. He wants to see if old Mr. McKibben is up-to-date.\n\nWhat I learn is this: Dad and his new wife now own this large house on the Cape and they want for nothing. My mother, one foot in the grave, wants. The document\u2019s formal tone can\u2019t hide her diminishment. While I page through it, I wonder at my own newly married state and how little I know of its future petitions and adjournments. I almost don\u2019t read to the end, which, in a brief, is the beginning, where the facts, such as they are, are depositioned. Maybe I know them already and don\u2019t want to read them.\n\nPolly is named.\n\nOf course he can\u2019t tell me himself. I look around at all the chintz coverings, the wicker and glass, seeing nothing. By insisting I read these papers, is he trying to warn me away from Polly? Or get even with Polly by hurting me? Or am I guilty too now, knowing, since she is my friend?\n\nIt looks good to me, I tell him.\n\nHow happy Dad had been to visit me in schnitzel-land, staying three extra days.\n\n\nA year later Polly hears that I\u2019m back in town with a position, not practicing law but close to it, teaching it not far from her grad school. We sit at a table with a bottle of wine between us, and a husband each to drink it, mine who whispers, Your dad? We speak of solemn things, all the dead in the war so far, the iconic picture of the man holding a pistol to another man\u2019s head, the Beatles\u2019 breakup. I bring up this last topic, feeling brazen by the bottle\u2019s draining, feeling I can lower the tone and open the dialogue with the terrible shattering of the Fab Four\u2019s friendship over what, a mere Love-In girlfriend?\n\nThe two men have long ago begun a side chat about guy trivia, stocks, like they care, and varieties of woods-of-the-world, her guy being a carpenter who is building her a huge house out of lumber he steals from the sites he works on. My Tasmanian admires his moxie, but their conversation lulls with my Beatles trivia, which opens a big, quiet hole.\n\nIt was like a marriage, the Beatles had a contract, I say, the lawyer in me still so new. The breakup of the century. Yoko betrayed them all.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, Polly says out of nowhere.\n\nI hadn\u2019t believed what I had read in the divorce papers until then. I was certain my mother had fabricated everything, my mother now unable to talk at all and without a new mate with an expensive porch overlooking the ocean, or any mate. I had called her on her birthday but she wouldn\u2019t say anything, her nurse very gently hanging up on me. Now I don\u2019t have anything smart to say back to Polly, nothing graceful or forgiving is going to come out of my mouth in answer.\n\nWe were best friends, is what I say. And before she can color that with something consoling, I head toward the ladies\u2019 but I don\u2019t go, I find the door and sit in the car until my husband locates me, as husbands are wont to do, on a hunch. I don\u2019t cry either, although decades later my shrink says I should have.\n\n\nPolly persists. She wants the last word, she wants more than that, she wants our friendship to continue, as a sign of my forgiveness. But by associating with Polly, I caused the divorce and thus my mother\u2019s illness, and when she dies, my mother leaves what she has to my brother. Somehow Polly sees the obit and sends a condolence note. She also sends me birthday and Christmas presents, with Love in the note that\u2019s tucked into whatever. We still share friends from college, and once we bump into each other by accident. She has Clintonian drive: if one person at a party resists her, that\u2019s the one she must amuse. I resist\u2014and she showers me with wit and concern. Who else knows me best, and so relentlessly? Then, because my mother, who didn\u2019t know me at all, is dead, I invite Polly to the Cape when my father is away.\n\nShe has divorced the carpenter\u2014he finished the house\u2014and found a research partner from Australia, a woman without any history between them who can write with her, Polly having, via osmosis with me, I suppose, become unable to finish her own academic papers, and she invites her and the woman\u2019s husband along. Buffers, I decide, being tentative, in thrall to the outrageousness of my invitation, and hers. The woman and Polly are more intimate than I expect, what with academic sighs that develop into sleights-of-conversation I can\u2019t quite follow, the two of them shouting at each other from their Schwinns as we round one more lovely green view that the Cape, with its half screens of rushes and graveyards, provides. Their topic is geography, how humans have to share it, and they\u2019re popularizing their magnum opus, Down with Capitalism. I insist I\u2019m fodder for their deliberation: I do popular. Even with my advanced degree, theory like theirs is too thick. They roll their eyes.\n\nWe kick-stand our bikes at the beach, a long one with crashing waves and surfboards. While the Aussie and her husband run down to the water, Polly and I nick our knees up under our chins, waiting for water-awe to subside. Polly closes her eyes, the quickest way to dispel all that nature so close. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re up to, she says to me.\n\nThe Aussie is taking steps with her husband into the deep. My husband is back at the house with a cold. How about you, with your ex? I say.\n\nI\u2019m talking about the whole world, and you in it.\n\nI write a word in the sand with my toe, who knows what\u2014harbor, as in feelings? It\u2019s too long to be hate. I\u2019m so suddenly happy I can\u2019t answer her question. I watch the waves.\n\nTemporary Autonomous Zone, Polly shouts, seeing the Aussies dragging back driftwood. Together we build a little kingdom in the sand with the wood, and roll over\u2014how does it always happen?\u2014a rock throne for her to sit on.\n\n\nPolly dies before my father does, asphyxiating on a plane in the middle of an intellectual point, a peanut stuck in her windpipe.\n\nMy father, out-Schmecklered by his newest wife, does not say, How fitting. I do not know if he cast Polly away so many years ago, or if the divorce lawyer said to cool it, and cool Polly never returned. Or perhaps she did return. I do not ask. I stand on his porch after telling him the news, facing the water Polly and I had watched, eating its way up the beach toward him.\n\nShe was my friend and whatever he thinks to say about her, he is not worthy to say it.\n\n"

        "writing_prompt": "In 1970s Times Square, you work in a tiny cigarette booth surrounded by impatient hands and the haze of tobacco, dreaming of something more. One day, an unusual job interview promises escape\u2014but at what cost?",
        "story": "I could extend both arms inside my cubicle, if you included the window slot that I delivered the cigarettes through. Candy too but mostly cigarettes bought in some Southern state near the tobacco fields and smuggled over state lines for cheap. Basil didn\u2019t do the smuggling. Balding, bellicose, and most of the time beaming, the closest he came to clandestine was using a paper bag to hold the take, reasoning that carrying a zippered cash purse had dollar signs all over it, and his bag said \u201cLunch.\u201d\n\nI was not eating lunch in those days, too expensive, maybe a Mars bar that I had to report. Lunch also took time away from slapping packs into the hands forever sticking themselves through the slot, something I did almost maternally rather than for money, given that the job paid maybe five bucks an hour. Again and again those hands beseeched, wriggling their impatient, addicted fingers. I worked in Times Square, long before the area was covered with moving images rather than the lurid static. Businessmen, not just the down-and-outs, were customers, men slumming for pleasure, starting with nicotine. It never occurred to me that I was being sold too, standing inside my glass-fronted box. Wearing peasant skirts and long-sleeved tops, without makeup, not even lipstick, I represented less the gateway drug of nicotine than the loss leader, virtue. How could the peep shows be so bad if she was here?\n\nI didn\u2019t see myself as part of what there was to see at all, I saw only the hands coming in through the slot with their clutched cash, sometimes wanting whole cartons, some just matches. Seldom did I have time to exchange any semblance of talk through the glass, what had been touted by Basil as bulletproof\u2014as reassurance, not to scare me\u2014but what was surely only thick Plexiglass, old and scratched. He hired me as soon as he heard I was going to Columbia. He said only girls from the finest institutions (emphasis on the syllable tu) can add. Few can these days, grumbled Basil, grabbing the paper bag with my calculations stapled to its fold.\n\nWhen my shift ended midafternoon\u2014and it often did, since Times Square attracted early risers and late-goers, people who needed cigarettes far more than coffee or the light of day\u2014Basil would take me along in his old station wagon to have me collect the paper bags from other cubicles. Who would imagine a girl could have so much cash? I didn\u2019t know about the Mafia and its stranglehold on his faux importation of tobacco, how Basil must have paid them off or been part of it.\n\nSince it was too much trouble to unlatch the so-called bulletproof window, the girls in the other cubicles stuffed their bags through the slots, girls grateful for the three-minute break of hello-how-are-you, sitting on stools like mine in an equally tiny space, surrounded by merchandise stretching far up to the ceiling and a space heater at their feet that threatened to turn it all into smoke. They were usually caught reading, book in one hand, a packet of cigarettes in the other, Peyton Place more often than Varieties of Religious Experience, resisting the education Basil said we all needed and that he so envied. He wanted women good with spreadsheets, not sheets, he said. I suspected otherwise, he treated us so nicely. A bonus every month of as many candy bars as you wanted, guaranteeing to stop pilfering he said, because of how sick it would make us. No one was hired who smoked, but the stench of tobacco was so strong in our clothes people asked us for a light on the subway home.\n\nI had an interview one afternoon for a new job that its ad said would pay better. Women only, for artistic purposes. It sounded, at the very least, less claustrophobic. Basil was annoyed. All that training he\u2019d given me going to waste on art? I didn\u2019t enumerate the three things I had learned from him: adding on a machine, smiling at the customer but not too much, and always stacking the bills faceup, from small to big.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if I have a contract, I said, tossing my half-eaten Mars bar out the car window, having found a delicate white worm in the center.\n\nCurious who would pay more for an untrained girl, he drove me to the interview, the paper bags already collected. It\u2019s the least I can do, he said, trying to sound terribly generous. That way I can return you back to your job with two weeks\u2019 notice.\n\nIt\u2019s just an interview, I said, as if his job meant everything.\n\nAre you looking to bargain for a higher wage?\n\nThe thought hadn\u2019t occurred to me, I said. Sure.\n\nHe was pulling up to the location. Well, you might have me over a barrel, he said, seeing money in exclamation marks all in the building. Sleek, of the newest architecture, it even had automatic elevators without a nosy operator, as I soon discovered once inside.\n\nI was ready for art.\n\nRoom 507 contained a man with a clipboard sitting on a folding chair and a camera on a stand. No one else waited to be seen. Hello, said the man, as impersonally as possible. No point in sitting down, he said.\n\nI\u2019ve been selling cigarettes, I said, as if it were a credential.\n\nThat\u2019s nice, he said, and tilted his head to look me over. I pay well, just like it says in the ad.\n\nArt? I asked, the ad out of my purse and in my hand.\n\nCommercial, he said, still eyeing me. Take off your clothes.\n\nDid I say, What? Did I say, Thanks anyway? I took off my clothes. After all, I\u2019d spent a semester drawing nudes. Though I didn\u2019t go so far as to pull my jeans past my knees. Surely he could get enough of an idea without that. I was already braless, and stood with my shirt half-untucked, hanging on my arm.\n\nHe was embarrassed for me. He waved his hand and said he\u2019d call. Put your number here, he said, pointing at his clipboard. He didn\u2019t even take a picture with his big camera.\n\nBasil had circled the block a few times but he was waiting. I got in.\n\nYou could use a drink, he said, glancing at me. There\u2019s a nice ladies\u2019 place uptown. He swung into traffic, away from Times Square.\n\nI don\u2019t drink, I said, and I have schoolwork.\n\nHe kept on driving. You girls are a dime a dozen, he said. It\u2019s amazing. Art, he said, shaking his head.\n\nI hopped out at the first stoplight.\n\n"
