        "story": "Some days or weeks or months or years before Mom died, I got her laughing about the Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that bad,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat one guy had a bag of meth,\u201d I told her.\n\n\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t smoke it,\u201d she responded. \u201cHe kept it in his pocket.\u201d\n\nTrue. He didn\u2019t. But even if he did, I don\u2019t think the night could have been any worse.\n\nMom was living in a house with several apartments in Bangor, Maine, at the time. Before living there, she lived in the town next over for seven years, but due to her drinking and her temper, got evicted, which is how she ended up in Bangor\u2014in a housing complex for Native tenants only. Mom tried so hard\u2014so, so hard\u2014to stay sober. And she did, occasionally. Weeks and months would go by when I don\u2019t think she was drinking. Or if she was, she had learned to control her temper. And it was around the time of that Thanksgiving\u2014the Thanksgiving\u2014when she had been sober. Clearheaded. When she called me, she no longer asked for money, asked for rides, asked for a pack of cigarettes. I want to say she was loving and caring and motherly, but even when she drank, she was those things too. I suppose she was just better. And that\u2019s why, when she said she wanted to host Thanksgiving, I was excited. Jess, my sister, was getting out of prison\u2014she served a one-year sentence for theft, on top of priors. According to an article in the local paper, which Mom had cut out and taped on the fridge next to an article about an award I won, Jess had been one of \u201cthree arrested after chicken, potatoes, vodka stolen from grocer,\u201d and she would be there. I was busy with something the day before Thanksgiving when my sister was released, and I told Mom I couldn\u2019t go with her to get Jess at the bus stop, so I didn\u2019t get to see her take her first step off the bus into the free world. My sister and I had written once a month for the year she was in prison. The only thing I remembered from the letters was that my sister\u2019s walking partner was Roxanne Jeskey, a woman convicted of torturing and murdering her husband with a wooden towel rack with nails protruding, needle-nose pliers, and a metal broom handle. Jess said that Roxanne was a good lady. In a text I sent Jess\u2014to make sure I was right that this was true\u2014she wrote back: \u201cShe was a very sweet little old lady who encouraged me to walk with her outside every day to feel better! There I am only doing a year and super depressed and that poor lady had life!\u201d\n\nA very sweet little old lady!\n\nWhile I couldn\u2019t pick my sister up at the bus stop with my mom, I reassured her I\u2019d be at Thanksgiving. Mom was so excited to have her son and daughter together, and part of that excitement, I think, came from the fact that she was sober and so was my sister. Hell, that got me excited too\u2014the first Thanksgiving, far as I can remember, with a sober mother and a sober sister. I imagined it would be a quiet gathering. We\u2019d be in Mom\u2019s cluttered bedroom in her tiny apartment filled with stale cigarette smoke while we sat on the bed and ate turkey, scalloped potatoes, green beans, bread, and cranberry sauce, and along the way Mom would turn down her TV\u2014she\u2019d be watching The Real Housewives of some fucking county\u2014so we could hear each other chew and talk. And in between bites of food we\u2019d ask Jess about prison, and she\u2019d crack jokes, and eventually we would ask her what Roxanne was really like, and Jess would say, Yeah, she told me after she cut off her husband\u2019s penis that she held it over her head and spun it around, pretending to escape the police in a penis-propelled helicopter, and then we\u2019d all laugh and Jess would say, No, no, she was a very nice lady, always asked me how I was doing, and then Jess would get up and ask us if we wanted more cranberry sauce and while she was in the kitchen she\u2019d wonder why Mom never wrote to her.\n\nBut that\u2019s too perfect, right? At least for our family it is.\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day, I got to Mom\u2019s around four in the afternoon. The driveway, which dipped down into a hill, was slick and icy, and so when I parked, I pulled up my emergency brake. I got out and looked up at the second floor, where Mom\u2019s apartment was. A light was on, the window open, and I heard their voices.\n\nThe stairs to Mom\u2019s apartment were narrow and twisty\u2014it\u2019s hyperbole to compare them to the Stairs of Cirith Ungol, but I bet Mom would find that true since she had terrible arthritis and a rod in her leg and that climb was tough\u2014and I climbed them to the top. The door was locked, so I knocked. No answer, but I heard them talking and then laughing. I knocked again, louder, and when the door swung open there was Jess\u2019s ex-boyfriend, Dan. Dan was really good at dumpster diving. He lived in a tent behind Hobby Lobby, even in the winter. Jess lived there too sometimes.\n\nDan was nice. Or so he seemed. I suppose I can say he was one of the nicer men my sister dated, one of the nicer men my sister loved.\n\nHe smiled at me\u2014all but one tooth straight\u2014and he ushered me into the living room, where Mom stood with an apron on and an unlit cigarette between her fingers. Jess was on the floor, cans of Natty Daddies surrounding her like a wall, a fortress, and she got up and from the floor and gave me a beery hug.\n\n\u201cHi, honey,\u201d Mom said, and she told me to follow her into the small kitchen.\n\nMom stirred gravy on the stove. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019s drinking,\u201d she said. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe it.\u201d Next to the stove was a cup with tinfoil folded over the top like a lid, a pink bendy straw pierced through it. Did Mom really not know we all knew that\u2019s how she drank? How she tried to hide it?\n\n\u201cRight when she got off the bus,\u201d Mom said, stirring, \u201cshe said she was going to get drunk. Whatever. She\u2019s a grown woman.\u201d\n\nShe drank from the cup with the straw.\n\nThe excitement I felt didn\u2019t immediately turn to disappointment. It was gradual. Sure, it started with seeing my sister\u2019s year of sobriety disappear, started by seeing Dan\u2014yeah, he was nice, but my sister could do better than a guy who lived in a tent behind Hobby Lobby\u2014started by seeing Mom pick up a drink. But the real disappointment came when more guests showed up.\n\nThree, to be exact.\n\nFirst there was Jeremy, a man in his thirties who my mom met at the methadone clinic (she always said she went for pain management, and in a way that\u2019s the truth).\n\n\u201cGod bless you,\u201d she said to him when he showed up with a can of cranberry sauce.\n\n\u201cThis your son?\u201d he asked.\n\nSecond, there was a tall older man, standing behind Jeremy. I can\u2019t remember who the hell he was. He was either a former priest or a pastor, but what I do know is that at that time, he was looking after Jeremy and his sobriety.\n\nThird and finally was the last person I expected: the schizophrenic woman who lived three houses down and who always\u2014and I mean always\u2014stood outside in the middle of the yard smoking.\n\n\u201cLiza, dear,\u201d Mom said. \u201cYou came.\u201d\n\nLiza\u2019s voice was raspy. \u201cYou got a cigarette?\u201d\n\nMom\u2019s apartment was already small to begin with, but just then it felt even smaller. In the living room, I stood while Jess and Dan drank and laughed on the floor, while Liza stood looking out the window, smoking, while Jeremy kept asking my mother if she needed help with anything in the kitchen, and while the priest smiled at us, all of us, a tribe of misfits and nutjobs and criminals and addicts and weirdos, myself included.\n\n\u201cBaby brother,\u201d my sister said, and I sat with her on the floor, even though she had that nasty booze breath, even though I was unhappy with her choices right then, because that\u2019s what you do when you love someone.\n\n\u201cDid you know,\u201d my sister said, not to me but to the room, \u201cdid you know that my baby brother wrote me all the time while I was in prison. And he sent me books and put money in my commissary.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust wonderful!\u201d the priest exclaimed. \u201cJust absolutely wonderful!\u201d\n\nMom cooked. Jess kept me on the floor with her and Dan. Liza continued to stand by the window. Jeremy moved between room and room, unable to commit to one place. And the priest kept on smiling.\n\nIt\u2019s moments like these, I realize now, with people like us, when the world and the lives within it are at their truest.\n\nEventually the food was ready, which Mom announced, that cigarette in her hand still unlit. But nobody moved. Jess and Dan stayed on the floor, drinking. Jeremy\u2014who had asked me more than once if I\u2019d seen a plastic bag filled with white glass beads\u2014couldn\u2019t stand still. Liza was no longer near the window but was in the middle of the living room, staring at Mom, who was in the hallway, waiting for people to come get food. The priest seemed the readiest to eat\u2014he was moving toward the kitchen with such conviction.\n\nThere was no line or anything\u2014we all just crammed ourselves into the kitchen, the very one Mom died hating because there was no sideboard space. It smelled like cooked meat and potatoes and the sweetness of warmed-up cranberry sauce and booze. Mom picked up a dull serrated blade.\n\n\u201cHappy Turkey Day,\u201d she said, and with the dull knife she tried to cut the turkey\u2019s tied feet. She drew the blade back and forth, back and forth, like the string was a giant log, the knife a bow saw, trying to get through it. My sister laughed. \u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Mom said, and then with such force she got the string cut and you\u2019d think tension would dissolve right then but it didn\u2019t and cooked bird juice and grease and fat flew and splattered all over the wall.\n\nMom licked turkey juice off her fingers and carved the turkey. \u201cHelp yourselves,\u201d she said. We all had plates except Liza. \u201cLiza, honey, do you want me to make you a plate?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got a cigarette?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Mom mumbled.\n\nAfter we all ate\u2014except for my mom, who always ate later, and for Liza, who just smoked her cigarette\u2014I told Mom I had to get going. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you down,\u201d she said, taking her apron off. My sister and I didn\u2019t say goodbye, because it wasn\u2019t goodbye for us\u2014we\u2019d see each other in a day or two or three.\n\nI helped Mom down the narrow and steep stairs, made sure she didn\u2019t fall, and outside she zipped up her jacket and lit a smoke. The sky was clear\u2014I remember that\u2014the night made brighter by the winter moon and stars burning so far away, a distance I sometimes felt with my mom but not right then.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe she drank,\u201d Mom was saying, and judging by the face I made she must have known I knew that she too drank. \u201cI had one drink,\u201d she confessed. \u201cBut I can have a drink, can\u2019t I?\u2019\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, lying, because one wouldn\u2019t be enough. But sometimes you know you just can\u2019t fight the person you love. Love. That\u2019s what that Thanksgiving was full of. Mom made sure I knew that years later, when one time we were again laughing about that night, she said to me, \u201cHoney, to those people, it was a good Thanksgiving, because they were invited. Because they had a place to be and they felt welcomed.\u201d\n\nThat night, in the driveway with her, getting ready to leave, that was what I felt, even though I couldn\u2019t name the feeling.\n\nWe stood there, Mom and I, and after I hugged her goodbye and thanked her for dinner\u2014to which she said, \u201cOf course, my honey\u201d\u2014she scraped her half-smoked cigarette across the icy snow, and I didn\u2019t leave the driveway until I saw she\u2019d made it safely back inside.\n\n"
