        "story": "We were in Jimmy\u2019s backyard playing Wiffle ball when the news broke that the shortstop had been traded.\n\nTraded? Jimmy said, turning to me. Him?\n\nWe ran up the little hill and slid open the screen door. On TV old clips played of the shortstop doing his trademark prepitch routine\u2014an odd, twitchy ritual we knew by heart. We watched him go through the well-known steps: batting gloves first, fingers waggling, then the tugged wristband, the tapped chest, hip, back pocket, belt, palm to the shining blue helmet, bat rapped gently on his left shoulder, then the toe taps, one foot and then the other, four taps in all, one, two, three, four.\n\nA four-team deal, they were saying on the TV. Two players coming back, both journeymen, their names faintly known. A first baseman and\u2014a shortstop.\n\nA shortstop, Jimmy said.\n\nI looked at the news anchor, watched his mouth shape the impossible words again and again: the shortstop, gone, and in return a shortstop who was not our shortstop, the only shortstop we\u2019d ever known.\n\nAfter a while Jimmy said: You know what? Good riddance. You heard them\u2014he\u2019s a clubhouse cancer. He wanted out. We can win without him. We don\u2019t need him anymore.\n\nI searched his face, looking for the joke, but his expression was hard and sealed off, closed to questioning. Studying him, all at once I understood that for us there would be no mourning the shortstop, no grief for a figure who, it must be said, had meant nearly everything to us for a very long time.\n\nHe was simply gone, and just as quickly the decree had come down: at fourteen, we were too grown up to care.\n\n\nYears later, during a winter break from college, Jimmy and I met for a long weekend at Disney World. Though too old for amusement parks, we\u2019d come anyway in an unspoken attempt to recover some of the easy childhood camaraderie that for so long had sustained us, to sew together bits of a friendship that, since we were far from home and surrounded by new friends with new interests and new jokes, had become badly frayed.\n\nThe first morning at the park, we were crossing Main Street when we noticed a group of girls clustered in front of a stage, watching a man and woman give a soccer demonstration. The woman was familiar to us: we\u2019d seen her many times on TV and on magazine covers. For a while we watched her kick and talk, kick and talk, her voice booming through the microphone clipped to her windbreaker. Most of her shots found their target, slipping past the outstretched arms of the goalie, who wore a golf shirt and a blue cap pulled low over his brow. Only when the demonstration ended and he lifted the cap did we realize it was the shortstop.\n\nWe stared as he stepped to the front of the stage. The gleaming black hair had gone slightly gray, and the gold chain we\u2019d marveled at in the famous shirtless cover photo was now dull and mostly hidden beneath his collar. Even his legs looked thin and unextraordinary where they disappeared into a pair of dorky running sneakers.\n\nHe gave a little wave and grinned\u2014that fabled grin!\u2014and then disappeared back into the shade behind his wife, who bent to sign autographs for the squealing girls. Watching him there, stooped in shadow, hands clasped at his back, it was hard to believe he was the same man who\u2019d nearly batted .400, who\u2019d once hit two grand slams in a single game.\n\nThat night Jimmy and I sat in our cramped motel room with a case of beer, sitting on adjacent beds drinking and watching a spring training game on the room\u2019s boxy TV. There\u2019d been some girls out by the pool, but they hadn\u2019t wanted to come back for a party, so we decided to just drink the beer ourselves.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much to say, I guess. But it was hard not to think about the shortstop, at least for me. I wished we hadn\u2019t seen him like that, gray-haired and paunchy, scrambling after loose balls in front of a bunch of kids who didn\u2019t even know who he was.\n\nAfter a while, feeling thoroughly buzzed, I stood and made my way unsteadily to the center of the room. From his spot on the bed Jimmy frowned up at me, cans gripped in both his hands.\n\nWhat are you doing? he said sharply. Seriously? Stop it.\n\nBut I\u2019d already begun. As he glared at me I reached down and from the stiff soiled rug brought up an invisible bat, laying it across my right shoulder, surprised at how natural it felt, how familiar, as if we\u2019d never left Jimmy\u2019s backyard. The old ritual came back easily, ingrained as an overhand toss: the tugged batting gloves, the wristband straightened along one arm. The touches\u2014forearm, hip, pocket, left shoulder, helmet, belt. Something consecrated about them, some bit of the sacrament in the solemn recurrent steps. And finally the toe taps, my bare feet digging into the tight weave of the rug: one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. Again. Again. Jimmy staring now, now smiling a little, now laughing in spite of himself, little snorts that burst from him like static from an ancient PA system as he rose suddenly and took a spot atop an invisible mound, bending into his windup, peering behind me for the pretend sign, squinting, shaking his head no, no, then nodding and rising into the set and beginning then to deliver the bright imagined ball into the space between us as on a diamond after the game, fans departed in a string of cars moving off into the night, their receding lights a fading memory, a necklace of winking gold.\n"
