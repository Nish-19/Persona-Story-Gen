        "writing_prompt": "You meet a drifter in a strawberry field, a man chasing something he calls his \"fire.\" Drawn to his conviction, you join him on a journey that blurs the line between love, loss, and the search for something neither of you can name.",
        "story": "My endings were never clean. Always an unraveling. Always, the threads of my bliss fraying toward uncertainty. Like those last days of August when you reach wildly back toward the warm womb of June. Let me back in. Shine down on me again, for I am not yet ready for the cold. Everything is, after all, uncertain. And change is a bitch.\n\nI met Husk in a strawberry field in Pennsylvania. He was wiping juice from his bristly chin and talking to himself, on his knees before the fruit. He always did think himself a holy man. In my experience, most men do.\n\n\u201cGotta get back,\u201d I heard him saying. \u201cHave to. Will.\u201d\n\nConviction appeals to me. Always has, mostly on account of my flagrant lack thereof. If you\u2019ve never had much luck with faith, it helps to latch onto someone with a lot of it. They\u2019ll pull you back and send you flying like an arrow. Swish. Now you have direction, momentum, an adopted purpose. I call it spiritual hitchhiking. Word to the wise.\n\nAs it happened, I was in that field because it looked like a good place to call it in. Lay down and give it all up. I\u2019d just lost everything but my name and my grandpa\u2019s silver watch to a two-bit, two-timing son of a bitch with a very dexterous tongue. He had conviction too but the other kind. The stain-your-teeth-green-from-wanting-the-wrong-things kind. After him, I learned to tell the difference, mostly.\n\nThat\u2019s how I knew Husk was sturdy. He just breathed like it. Easy. Not like me. My lungs rattle. People always say they can\u2019t hear it but it\u2019s there. The weakness, my grandpa called it\u2014genetic, by his judgment, and from my dad\u2019s side. Never knew Mom or Dad so I just took his word for it. I think that\u2019s what the people call a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nMy grandpa had a big barrel chest and nails caked in charcoal. Used to make me carry a bag of stones from the stream up and down the stairs until my knees buckled, and then he\u2019d give me a lime ice pop. He had the right idea, I think, but the wrong execution will get you all sorts of fucked up.\n\nLooking at Husk, you knew he was all about the right execution. You also knew he was lucky. The sun hit him special. That\u2019s why I poked my head up from the grass where I was spread-eagled and called out to him. \u201cBack where?\u201d\n\nHe sucked the green end of a berry and turned to look at me.\n\nI propped myself up on my hands. \u201cWhere you gotta get back to?\u201d\n\nHe smiled, walked over, and kneeled real close to me.\n\n\u201cI said I gotta get it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s it?\u201d\n\nTruth is it wouldn\u2019t have mattered what it was at all because I was down as soon as he looked at me. Wanted to be him, wanted to be under him, would have shot him right into my bloodstream. Still not sure what he saw in me, the way I was, all stained jeans and dry elbows, face sweatier than a firefighter\u2019s. On the bleak days, I think it\u2019s just that the strong need the weak just as bad. When I\u2019m thinking straight, it seems like my inability to see something shiny in the mirror is probably a me problem.\n\n\u201cMy fire,\u201d Husk said, shooting me a squinty-eyed side smile that damn near melted my jeans off. \u201cGotta get my fire back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhereabouts do you think you lost it?\u201d\n\nHe laughed then, like a trumpet in an endless cave. I was glad to be the reason.\n\n\u201cSeems like we should grab some berries and start looking, don\u2019t you think? Gotta be around here somewhere.\u201d I pushed myself to my feet and swiped my bangs out of my eyes.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nOur first few weeks were gorgeous. No other word for that wild pitch of happiness. We slept in his pickup under the stars in seven counties. There was the press of his mouth against my neck, the insistent spiral of his fingers inside me, the dip of his back licked with sweat afterward, crushing me tender. We ate mostly stolen crops and small game caught with Husk\u2019s crossbow. Everything tasted like chocolate to me in those days. Could\u2019ve been cold dirt but it hit me like cocoa.\n\nOne morning he woke me up by blowing in my face until my eyes opened, then he went shhh and scooped me into his arms. There was a deer there, off the truck\u2019s right, and her baby. Ears close enough to touch. Fur like fresh snow. He held me in his lap in the cargo bed and we watched them pass us by. The wind was cool and sweet. The sun like a ribbon of rising red. Then he slipped down between my legs without a word, lapping at me first, sleepy and slow, then devouring me like a strawberry. I licked the juice clean off his chin after.\n\nThe thing with Husk and me is we grew from similar soil, which is partly why I ran with him long as I did. He smelled like home. This meant we understood the way each other was without much talk. This also meant I should have known a little bit better, been less shocked when about three weeks into things he went cold on me.\n\n\u201cThis is not it,\u201d he said one night while we were driving down an empty highway somewhere in North Carolina. He\u2019d been holding my hand to his mouth, kissing it while he drove, but he dropped it then like dead weight.\n\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be it.\u201d\n\nHis moments of doubt, anger, loss of clarity. They panicked me to my core. I needed him to be sure or else I didn\u2019t know which way was up. Like he was a whole stack of clacking vertebrae in the very middle of my spine. I think that\u2019s what the people call codependency.\n\n\u201cWhat then? What do you need?\u201d\n\nThe from me was implied, maybe not to him but to me.\n\nHe pulled over without warning, got out the truck, and started pacing along the shoulder with his hands on his waist, kicking up a storm. When a man gets like that, you can either sit and wait, try to touch him back to reality, or save yourself the trouble and walk on out. I was not yet wise enough to save myself any kind of trouble, but I\u2019d been shoved around enough times to sit in the passenger seat until he was done.\n\nAfter ten minutes or so, he climbed back in and gripped the steering wheel hard, eyes on the road. I leaned over and kissed his mouth, squeezed between his legs. That was the first time I felt dirty with him. Such a small thing. Insignificant, even, but it curdled my insides. It wasn\u2019t just that he\u2019d lost his conviction. It wasn\u2019t just that my biggest power over him was sex. It was that I knew something he didn\u2019t. I knew he wouldn\u2019t ever track down his fire because he didn\u2019t have a damn clue what scent he was tracking. I knew people like him can run in circles forever because they want to feel alive but don\u2019t understand that living means sometimes you\u2019re just carrying a bag of stones up the stairs. Point is I knew he was lost, and I grabbed his dick and played dumb like I didn\u2019t and that made me nothing but an appendage. Was almost enough to turn me off him for good, but like I said\u2014my endings never were clean. I always rode the damn thing into the ground. Could never quit on anything but myself.\n\nAfter that, we made our way toward Arizona. The time in between was a lot of Husk moping, dipping in and out of silences, diving in and out of my body. When he was inside me, it felt like we stood a chance. He pursued me with an urgency in those moments that gave me hope. We could both claw our way back toward bliss. That\u2019s what I believed while I held his damp, hot skin on mine, gripped him into me like a constrictor with prey. But then, the coldness. It wouldn\u2019t leave us, even when we made it all the way to the orange cusp of the Grand Canyon, where the sun felt like an open flame.\n\nWhile we stood at that edge, I could\u2019ve sworn that for just a second we both had the idea to push the other person right over. Something in the air between us. A clenching, or maybe a repulsion. Like two identical magnets surging apart.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d I said, and I meant it. All that eternal rock. A slip of water running through like a Hail Mary. It looked like someone had lifted the top off the planet and left it all exposed.\n\nHusk grunted and turned back toward the truck. We hadn\u2019t eaten a proper meal in a couple days, and he was hungry. Growing desperate in the eyes. Even started keeping his bow loaded on the off chance a cottontail came by. We packed into the pickup, and he drove us long and silent to the outskirts of a town, where he parked and reclined his seat. The evening was staining life purple then, and my stomach was at battle. Struggling is only fun when you\u2019re in love enough for it to be a game and it\u2019s brief enough to seem like a fluke. After that it\u2019s just struggle.\n\nI slept deeply, despite everything. When I opened my eyes, the sun was already noon-high and Husk wasn\u2019t beside me. My first thought was that he\u2019d left me to rot, but I knew he wouldn\u2019t ditch the truck. I got out and looked around, stretching the car sleep out of my neck, and there he was, unpacking a bag of food into the back. Lining up a loaf of fluffy white bread, jars of peanut butter and grape jelly, trail mix, chocolate bars, canned peaches, ropes of jerky. Brimming with loot. He had some of his shine back too. I could see it in his chest, the way his breath came even and low. When he noticed me watching, he grinned.\n\n\u201cA feast,\u201d he said, holding up a bottle of champagne like a trophy.\n\n\u201cHow? Where did you\u2014\u201d\n\nI cut myself off. I\u2019ll never know if he was about to weave a woolen lie or come clean because I spotted it before he could speak. My watch\u2014gone off my wrist. We looked at each other for a moment then, Husk stuck in place like a celebrating ice statue and me looking some type of way I can only guess. Shocked but not surprised, maybe. It\u2019s possible my skin tightened hard and my jaw was out for blood. It\u2019s possible I looked about to cry. It\u2019s also possible I had no expression at all. Like I said, no luck with mirrors.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d Husk said, holding his hands up and walking toward me. \u201cI did this for us. More where this came from. Now we\u2019re set for a while. Now we can keep searching.\u201d\n\nI must\u2019ve been looking at him something crazy because he stopped walking and held his hands even higher. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nHe flashed that side smile but a twitch of skin in his forehead betrayed his weakness. Husk was out for himself. I couldn\u2019t even fault him for it. The problem with joining other people\u2019s crusades is that you care about the other people and they care about their crusade. It\u2019s all imbalanced from the start. Looking at him then I saw it for the first time. That I would never be happy unless I cared whether I was or not. I decided to care something vicious.\n\n\u201cI thought you were lucky,\u201d I said, turning my back to the truck so that Husk shifted to mirror me, his back to the witnessing sun.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d he said, stepping closer and reaching out his hands. \u201cI found you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nI smiled, or tried to. \u201cYou\u2019re exactly right.\u201d\n\nWhen he got almost close enough to touch me, I swung my left arm around and grabbed his black-slicked crossbow from the cargo bed. Then I pointed it at him.\n\n\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa. Easy.\u201d He threw his hands high.\n\n\u201cPut the rest of my money and some of the food into your backpack and give it to me,\u201d I said, staring at him over the shaft of an arrow.\n\n\u201cCome on, now,\u201d he said.\n\nI aimed higher, toward his head. \u201cDo it. Not too heavy, though. Can\u2019t risk my knees buckling.\u201d\n\nHe sucked his teeth and laid his pack on the ground. Emptied out everything except a bottle of water and a roll of cash, which he held up to show me, and then he walked over to the food. He surrendered the peaches, the bread, the jelly, and the chocolate.\n\n\u201cTake it,\u201d he said, holding the pack out to me by a shoulder strap.\n\nI yanked it away from him and started to backstep toward town.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking the bow?\u201d\n\nI made it ten feet and then I turned from him and started running.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d he called out. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\nHe said some other stuff too, but I barely remember what it was because the wind was wilding me away, licking all across my skin, and it felt like heaven. Fields of yellow grass whispering in my ear. Sun on my side. I was gone.\n\nNever saw him again. I\u2019m nearly sure I never will, but I always look both ways when I find myself in a berry patch. You\u2019d think I\u2019d hold a grudge, but the truth is I was done with my grandpa long before Husk pawned that watch, and I feel like a souped-up crossbow is almost an upgrade. I like to think he picked up the scent, in the end. I like to think he got up off his ass and made good on all that sunshine the sky gifted him. As for me, I\u2019ve entered the fire. I lit the damn thing and I\u2019m right here in the center.\n\nThat\u2019s the other thing about people like Husk.\n\nThey don\u2019t know that the flames can never die if you\u2019re carrying matches.\n"
