        "story": "Israel Rostov was a high school dropout who worked as a fur-cart pusher in the State and Lake Building. Roy was eight years old when he first saw him. On Saturdays Roy often accompanied his grandfather, Jack Colby, whom he called Pops, to the furriers\u2019 office there that Pops shared with his brothers, Ike and Nate. Their brother Louie, who was the president of the Chicago Furriers Association, which he had founded, kept his office on the sixth floor of the building. The Colby brothers\u2019 office was on the eighth floor.\n\nRoy would sit on a high stool and cut up pelts with a stiletto-like knife Pops had taught him to use, while his grandfather and great-uncles sat around a marble-topped table and played cards. When Louie joined them, the game was bridge; otherwise, they played three-handed gin rummy.\n\nIzzy Rostov delivered furs on carts from floor to floor. He was a short kid with thick, curly black hair and bushy eyebrows, small dark-brown eyes, and a huge hook nose that seemed to be trying to escape from his face. Rostov\u2019s thick red lips curved upward at the corners so that it looked as if he were always smiling, except that his smile more resembled a sneer. He perpetually had a burning, unfiltered Lucky Strike dripping from his mouth. Roy was fascinated by Izzy\u2019s ability to talk while never removing the cigarette from his lips, as if the butt end were glued between them.\n\nRostov called Roy \u201cmy little pal\u201d and stopped his cart to talk to him whenever he encountered Roy in the hallways or in the freight elevator. This usually occurred when Roy was going between the sixth and eighth floors to visit with his Uncle Louie. The delivery boy always had a future plan for himself that he told Roy about. Most of the time it had to do with his moving to Miami Beach to hang out in the luxury hotels so that he could \u201chook up with rich, lazy broads.\u201d\n\nOne afternoon, Rostov told Roy he had something special to show him but he couldn\u2019t do it in the hallway. Roy followed Izzy into the men\u2019s room on the eighth floor. After making sure that nobody else was in the bathroom, Rostov removed from one of his coat pockets a small black handgun and held it out for Roy to look at.\n\n\u201cThis is a .38-caliber snub-nosed revolver,\u201d Rostov said. \u201cA very accurate piece of hardware. I bought it from a spook on Maxwell Street.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with it?\u201d asked Roy.\n\n\u201cStick up a few gas stations, what else? I gotta get a stake together before I travel, buy some slick clothes to impress the broads, you know. I can\u2019t make it on the peanuts these penny-pinchin\u2019 Hebes pay me around here.\u201d\n\nIzzy Rostov tapped the tip of his prodigious nose with the barrel of his revolver and said, \u201cI might even have enough dough to get my beak fixed.\u201d\n\nThen he laughed and put the gun back into his coat pocket. The ash from Rostov\u2019s cigarette dangled dangerously, and Roy was certain it would fall off, but it didn\u2019t. Roy moved farther away from him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be frightened, little pal,\u201d said Izzy. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna shoot anyone. The piece is just to throw a scare into \u2019em, let the suckers know Israel Rostov means business. I could change my name too, once I get down south. How does Guy DeMarco sound? Smooth, huh? The broads\u2019ll go for a name like that. Guy DeMarco.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think gas stations keep a lot of cash around?\u201d Roy asked.\n\n\u201cDepends,\u201d said Rostov. \u201cBut I got bigger ideas.\u201d\n\nRostov came close to Roy, mussed up his hair, and then walked out of the men\u2019s room. Roy waited for a minute before returning to his grandfather\u2019s office. Jack, Ike, and Nate were playing gin.\n\n\u201cHey, babe,\u201d said Pops, \u201cI thought you were going to see your Uncle Louie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI decided not to. I just went to the washroom.\u201d\n\nRoy went over to his stool, climbed on, and resumed cutting up pelts.\n\nThe next time Roy ran into Izzy Rostov, the delivery boy winked at him but did not stop to talk. His cart was loaded with mink and fox stoles.\n\n\u201cGotta get these on a truck goin\u2019 to the Merchandise Mart,\u201d Izzy said, and pushed on toward the freight elevator.\n\nA couple of Saturdays after that, all four of the brothers were playing bridge, when Louie said, \u201cYou hear the Rostov boy got killed?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe delivery cart kid?\u201d asked Ike.\n\n\u201cYes. Apparently he tried to rob a liquor store on Huron the other night and the clerk shot him in the back before he could get away.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know about his parents?\u201d asked Nate.\n\n\u201cWhat about them?\u201d Jack asked.\n\n\u201cThey were survivors of Auschwitz.\u201d\n\n\u201cHorrible,\u201d said Ike. \u201cImagine how they must feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Auschwitz?\u201d asked Roy.\n\nThe men were silent for a few moments before Nate spoke.\n\n\u201cIt was a concentration camp, a prison death camp during the war where the Germans murdered Jews.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey also murdered Gypsies and communists,\u201d said Ike, \u201cbut mostly Jews.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Rostov\u2019s parents are still alive,\u201d Roy said.\n\n\u201cSome prisoners were rescued by the Allies before the Nazis could kill them,\u201d said Louie.\n\n\u201cHow many people did they kill?\u201d asked Roy.\n\n\u201cToo many to count,\u201d said his grandfather. \u201cThe accepted figure is six million.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore,\u201d said Louie. \u201cThey murdered more.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo think that the parents escaped the Holocaust,\u201d Nate said. \u201cThey come to America and their child is shot down in the street like a wild animal.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had a gun,\u201d Roy said. \u201cHe showed it to me.\u201d\n\nThe men all looked at Roy.\n\n\u201cIt was a snub-nosed .38,\u201d he said. \u201cIzzy told me he was going to stick up a gas station and move to Miami Beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of home life could the boy have had?\u201d said Nate.\n\nRoy looked out a window onto State Street. The Chicago Theatre was showing Alan Ladd in The Badlanders. Clumps of brown dirt the size of pigeons were blowing through the gray air.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s play cards,\u201d said Ike.\n\n"

        "writing_prompt": "A boy refuses to move to the suburbs with his unstable mother and her overbearing husband, instead making plans to live with the lively Irish family next door. But when life takes unexpected turns, he learns that home is built on the small, strange things you never realize you'll miss.",
        "story": "Roy was twelve years old when his mother and her third husband, a jazz drummer named Sid \u201cSpanky\u201d Wade, told him that they were going to move out of Chicago to a suburb north of the city. They had already paid for the beginning of the construction of a new house, and the foundation had been laid. The next day, a Sunday, the four of them\u2014Roy\u2019s mother, her husband, Roy\u2019s one-year-old sister, and Roy\u2014drove out to see it.\n\nRoy had no desire to leave the neighborhood, and when he saw the property in Winnebago Gardens, a new development in the middle of nowhere, only sidewalks and streets and other houses under construction, no people, not even a kid on a bike, he knew immediately this place was not for him. The thought of being stranded like a lost legionnaire in the Sahara made Roy shiver. He disliked Sid Wade and Sid disliked him; and Roy\u2019s mother, as always during her marriages, was either on the verge of a nervous breakdown or in the throes of collapse. His mother\u2019s marriages\u2014of which there would eventually be five\u2014inevitably and rapidly deteriorated into disappointment and fear that found expression in the form of hysteria and vicious vitriol, behavior that terrorized not only her husband of the moment but Roy and anyone else who had to deal with her. This proposed move to the suburbs, to \u201csomewhere quiet and less stressful,\u201d as Sid Wade said, would surely salve her condition. City life made her nervous, agreed Dr. Martell, a heart specialist and old friend of Roy\u2019s grandmother\u2019s, who provided pills for his mother even in the middle of the night.\n\nSeveral days after their excursion to Winnebago Gardens, Roy was having dinner with the family when Sid Wade began telling Roy what he could and could not take with him when they moved.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not moving,\u201d Roy said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, I\u2019ll take care of my own things.\u201d\n\nSid Wade dropped his fork onto his plate, his heavy-jowled face turned crimson, and he said, \u201cOf course you\u2019re moving. We all are.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve already made arrangements to live next door with the McLaughlins. Mr. and Mrs. McLaughlin said it\u2019s all right with them. Jimmy\u2019s going into the army next month, so I\u2019ll have his bunk in the room with Johnny and Billy. I told Mrs. McLaughlin I\u2019d contribute money to the household out of my pay delivering for Kow Kow. I\u2019ll be fine there.\u201d\n\nRoy\u2019s mother stood up from the table and put her dishes in the sink. Her face was green and her lips were trembling. Her body shook and she was crying.\n\n\u201cLook what you\u2019ve done to your mother!\u201d Sid Wade shouted.\n\nRoy\u2019s little sister, upset by his loud voice, began crying too.\n\n\u201cIf your father were here,\u201d Wade snarled, \u201che wouldn\u2019t put up with your insolence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not being insolent,\u201d said Roy. \u201cAnd don\u2019t talk about my father. You didn\u2019t know him and he\u2019s dead. You don\u2019t know what he\u2019d say or do. If he were alive, I\u2019d go live with him. Johnny and Billy are my best friends and Mr. and Mrs. McLaughlin are good people.\u201d\n\nFrank McLaughlin worked as a doorman at the Drake Hotel and his wife took in laundry. They were from Ireland and spoke Gaelic in their house. They let their sons drink coffee in the morning and Margaret McLaughlin made great peach and strawberry pies in the summer. Roy couldn\u2019t wait to go live with them.\n\nSid Wade and Roy\u2019s mother began arguing. She closed her eyes and fell down on the floor. The baby was screeching and Sid Wade wouldn\u2019t stop yelling, carrying on about how Roy should be sent to reform school, that he\u2019d never be any good, just like his gangster father.\n\n\u201cHe did time and you\u2019ll do time!\u201d Wade said. He snorted like a buffalo and his little eyes disappeared.\n\nRoy could hear his mother moaning.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re killing your mother!\u201d screamed Wade, though he made no attempt to pick her up off the floor, where she was now writhing like a Moroccan fakir\u2019s cobra being replaced in its basket.\n\nRoy rose from the table and walked out the back door, down the steps, through the yard, and into the alley behind the garage. It was windy and cold and he was wearing only a T-shirt. Mr. Anderson\u2019s old red Studebaker was parked in the alley between his house and the McLaughlins\u2019. Roy knew that Mr. Anderson never locked it, so he walked over, opened the passenger-side door, and got in. He sat there looking through the windshield. The sky was almost dark, there was a thin, pale-yellow ribbon running through the gray. At the far end of the alley two men came out of the rear door of the Green Harp tavern. They were smoking and laughing. One of them was wearing a blue zipper jacket and the other was wearing a brown one. Both men were hatless. Roy watched them standing and talking and smoking, their hair waving in the wind. Mr. Anderson had left an open pack of Lucky Strikes on top of the dashboard. Roy took one, put it between his lips, and punched in the lighter.\n\n\n\nThree months later, Roy\u2019s mother told him that Sid had defaulted on their installments for the house in Winnebago Gardens and forfeited the down payment, so they weren\u2019t going to move there. A week after that, Roy came home from school one day and found Sid Wade picking up his clothes and other belongings from in front of the house, where Roy\u2019s mother had thrown them. Later the same day Sid moved out and Roy\u2019s mother said she was divorcing him and going to work as a receptionist in Dr. Martell\u2019s office.\n\nJimmy McLaughlin came home from the army on leave for a few days after completing basic training. Roy and Johnny and Billy were sitting on Johnny\u2019s bunk listening to him. Jimmy was lying on his bed in his uniform smoking a Chesterfield, telling them about life at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri. Johnny had taken over Jimmy\u2019s job washing dishes at the Chinese restaurant, Roy had taken over Johnny\u2019s delivery days, and Billy, the youngest McLaughlin brother, a year younger than Johnny and Roy, who were five years younger than Jimmy, now worked at Kow Kow too, sweeping up and taking out the garbage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to be back home,\u201d Jimmy said, \u201ceven if it\u2019s only for a week. You don\u2019t know how much you miss it until you can\u2019t be there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you miss the most?\u201d asked Johnny.\n\n\u201cStrange things, little things, mostly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah? Like what?\u201d said Roy.\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Jimmy. \u201cJust seein\u2019 Mr. Anderson\u2019s red \u201952 Studebaker parked in the alley is one, I guess. It gives me a good feelin\u2019 knowin\u2019 it\u2019s still there.\u201d\n"

        "writing_prompt": "A teenage boy spending the summer in Florida finds himself drawn into the complicated and unsettling world of a bold, older girl he meets at a local dance hall, where secrets and desires collide under the humid Southern night.",
        "story": "Roy met Tina at the Cuban Brotherhood Club and Dance Hall in Tampa, Florida, when he was fourteen. Roy was spending the summer with his uncle Buck, working construction on weekdays, resting on Saturdays, and fishing on Sundays. Tina was a local girl who went with her girlfriends to the dances at the Cuban Club on Saturday nights.\n\nRoy and his friend Ralph were fascinated by the big-eyed dusky Cuban girls who had come to Florida with their families in the first wave of \u00e9migr\u00e9s who fled the island following the revolution. These girls wore makeup, bright red lipstick, large gold hoop earrings, and short skirts. They danced only with one another and did not speak to white boys. Mostly they sat together in folding chairs in a corner of the dance hall and never stopped chattering and gesturing dramatically. Roy spoke some Spanish but when he got close enough to overhear their conversations, they spoke so rapidly and without fully pronouncing most of their words that he could not understand anything they were saying.\n\nTina didn\u2019t like the Cuban girls. She was tall and blonde, as was her friend, LaDonna. When Roy asked Tina to dance she asked him what he thought of the Cuban girls. Before he could answer, Tina said, \u201cThey\u2019re cheap. They have big asses and dress like whores. LaDonna says her mother told her that their fathers have sex with them starting when they\u2019re five.\u201d\n\nRoy found this hard to believe. He worked laying sewer pipe and shooting streets with Cuban men and liked them. They were good workers, glad to have a job, and they laughed a lot. Most of the time Roy didn\u2019t get their jokes\u2014they spoke as rapidly as the girls at the dances\u2014but they always offered to share their homemade lunches with Roy. He loved the Cuban food: lech\u00f3n and pollo asado, platanos maduros, black beans and yellow rice.\n\nTina had blue eyes with yellow spots in them, an almost pretty face, and a terrific figure. She and LaDonna wore as much makeup as or more than the Cuban girls.\n\n\u201cAre you from around here?\u201d Tina asked Roy. \u201cYou don\u2019t talk like you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from Chicago,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m down here staying with my uncle for the summer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m almost seventeen,\u201d said Tina. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be sixteen in October,\u201d Roy lied.\n\nTina was a little taller than Roy. She had slender, muscular arms and held him tightly, pulling him around during a slow dance. Her new breasts were as hard as her arms. She pushed herself against Roy and he got excited.\n\n\u201cI can tell you like me, Roy,\u201d Tina said, and smiled. Her teeth were crooked and up close Roy could see the pimples beneath cracks in her makeup.\n\nRalph was trying to get one of the Cuban girls to talk to him, and LaDonna was dancing with a heavyset guy whose ears were perpendicular to his head. Tina told Roy that his name was Woody and that he was one of LaDonna\u2019s exes. \u201cShe\u2019s got a lot of \u2019em,\u201d Tina said.\n\nAfter the slow dance Roy and Tina got cups of lemonade at the host table and stood off to the side.\n\n\u201cDo you want to walk me home?\u201d Tina asked him. \u201cI live four blocks from here. I don\u2019t much like the music they\u2019re playing tonight, and my parents make me come home early.\u201d\n\nWhen they got to her house, a white, wooden bungalow set on concrete blocks with a wide front porch with a swing on it, Tina said, \u201cCome in with me. My parents go to bed right after Perry Mason and then we can sneak out and go down to the river.\u201d\n\nTina introduced Roy to Ed and Irma, both of whom Tina addressed by their given names, not by Mom and Dad, which Roy had never heard a kid do before. Ed and Irma sat in separate armchairs in the small living room watching Raymond Burr be a lawyer on their black-and-white Motorola. Roy and Tina sat slightly apart from each other on a lumpy couch. Ed and Irma did not say anything until the program was over. Ed stood up and turned off the television set after the theme music finished playing over the end credits.\n\n\u201cMan never loses a case,\u201d he said.\n\nEd had a huge belly and big arms. So did Irma. They both said goodnight and left the room. Tina put her right hand on Roy\u2019s left leg and squeezed his thigh. As soon as Tina heard the door to her parents\u2019 bedroom close and the lock click, she turned to Roy and kissed him hard on the mouth.\n\nTina stood, took Roy\u2019s left hand, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go down to the river and sit on the pier.\u201d\n\nThe river was at the end of Tina\u2019s street. She led him past a dwarf palm tree that was bent halfway over to a short pier and pulled him down onto the planks.\n\n\u201cLie back,\u201d she said.\n\nThere were no boats moving on the water, and except for insect noises it was quiet. Tina lay on top of Roy and rubbed her body against his. They kissed a few times with their mouths closed, then Tina rolled onto her side and with one hand unzipped his fly. Roy\u2019s cock popped up like a jack-in-the-box and Tina wrapped her right hand around it. He stared at the crescent moon as she stroked him slowly for a minute or so and then Roy tried to get up and lie on top of her. Tina pushed him back down, held him prostrate with her ropey arms, straddled his legs, and put his cock into her mouth. Roy came immediately.\n\nTina rolled off of him and spat into the water, turned back to Roy, and said, \u201cYou have a good dick, I think.\u201d\n\nShe stood up, so Roy did too. He zipped up his pants. Tina had already begun walking back off the pier. They walked to her house without saying anything. Tina stopped in front of her porch steps. No lights were on. She stretched out her arms and rested them on Roy\u2019s shoulders.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be at the Cuban Club next Saturday,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going with Ed and Irma to Milwaukee on Monday. That\u2019s where Mamie, Irma\u2019s mother, lives. I have a cousin there, Ronnie. He\u2019s the only boy I let fuck me. He\u2019s twenty-one.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long have you been letting him do it?\u201d Roy asked.\n\n\u201cSince a couple of months before my thirteenth birthday. This will be the fifth year. I only see Ronnie in the summer when we visit Mamie. Ronnie\u2019s getting married in September.\u201d\n\nTina kissed Roy on the mouth and this time she stuck her tongue in. Roy watched her go up the steps and into the house. He saw Irma sitting on the swing in the dark, smoking a cigarette.\n\n\u201cGo on now, boy,\u201d she said.\n\n"
