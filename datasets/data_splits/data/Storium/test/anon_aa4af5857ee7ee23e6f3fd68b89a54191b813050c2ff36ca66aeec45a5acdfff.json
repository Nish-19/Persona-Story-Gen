It dwells in a sliver of infinity that fills the overlooked cracks of reality: between ideas and reality; between motions and acts; between a concept and the creation; between the spark of emotion and the response it ignites.\n\nIt\u2019s always been there, and every now and then someone falls into it, called down a side alley that never should\u2019ve been there, or up a staircase that wasn\u2019t noticed before, or on the extra page of a well-loved novel. It hides in plain sight that way, and lures to it individuals of particular skills\u2013or particular tragedies.\n\nIn its halls lives every story that ever was, is, and will be. \n\nEven the broken ones.\n\nBut shattered stories are a problem for the Library. Something lives with it in the unseen spaces, and hungers to consume what the Library protects, and unmake it entirely. Only by wrapping itself in whole, finished chronicles does the Library stand secure, its walls formidable, the precious ideas within intact. Each story left unfinished gives cracks and seams that the Emptiness can squeeze through and exploit. Too many of these, and the Emptiness will surely prevail.\n\nA war is being waged in the unseen spaces of reality: between potency and existence; between essence and descent; between premise and plot. And every war needs soldiers.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably never heard of the Library\u2026 but it\u2019s heard of you.  \n",

            "story_name": "Our world is not our own anymore. \n\nIn 2015, aliens arrived\u2013a multi-species, militaristic force with unimaginably advanced technology. They created bioengineering monstrosities, had mastered interstellar and atmospheric flight-capable aircraft, and could even reach out mind-to-mind and control their enemies. Earth never stood a chance, though we still fought.\n\nAt first, they toyed with us; we still don\u2019t know why. They conducted a shadow war in small strikes, prodding and poking us as though to see what would happen. Eventually, though, they came in force, and one by one they demanded the surrender of our nations. The first to surrender created the \u2018ADVENT Coalition\u2019, which laughably pretended to govern *with* the aliens, as partners. We all knew better. \n\nOpen warfare was swift and brutal. They bombed our cities with a toxic fog that rendered them unlivable, leaving anyone caught within to devolve into a nightmarish echo of their own humanity, forcing the rest of us to flee to the open countryside. Scattered, without our satellites, without anywhere to concentrate our forces, it was only a matter of time.\n\nThey decided to stay. Under the ADVENT Coalition, they rebuilt the cities that they cared to in their own design, to their own sensibilities, stripping them of human culture and tradition. There, humans are kept like favored pets: cared for, nourished, but never let off leash. They control information, health, food, and of course all armed forces.\n\nHowever, their control is not complete. Outside the cities, the aliens don\u2019t seem to care much what the rest of us do. We eke out a life however we can, struggling day-to-day, and perhaps they think that means they can ignore us.\n\nThey have always underestimated us.\n\nMore and more of us are answering the call to resist. We don\u2019t have much to turn against them, but we find ways: by learning where supplies are kept, when transports are running, who their important personnel are, and where our own prisoners have been taken. We gather this precious information, and we disseminate it to anyone with the means and will to fight back; anyone willing to try and hobble their horrific machine.\n\nThey control the planet, but they don\u2019t yet control us, and as long as there are still people able to fight, we\u2019ll support them. No matter the cost.\n\n---\n\nThis is one of three [parallel](https://storium.com/game/xcom-2-twilight-kingdom/) [stories](https://storium.com/game/xcom-2-violent-souls/) that act as a sequel to [XCOM: Falls the Shadow](https://storium.com/game/xcom-falls-the-shadow/). This story focuses on the survivor communities that comprise the non-combat Resistance to the ADVENT coalition government. They live a hard life in the dangerous wilds outside ADVENT\u2019s control, struggling day-to-day between basic survival, dodging ADVENT patrols and crackdowns, maintaining human culture, and supporting the ongoing fight to be free. \n",

A shadow war, conducted with the implicit consent of every major nation on the planet, was waged against the beneficent outsiders. Yet still they persisted, braving the aggression and carnage of so many of their own killed in their attempt to raise us out of our self-destruction and greed.\n\nIn time, they succeeded--just a few nations at first, reluctantly opening their ears to what the aliens offered. They came with miracle cures for all our ailments, technology that vastly surpassed our own to repair our broken world and make for us a utopia. Seeing these wonders, the other nations of the world responded, again, the only way base humanity understood: violence. This time open war.\n\nBut the Elders persisted despite our blind hatred. \n\nIt has been almost twenty years since the last of the old world governments surrendered to the Elders, accepting the mercy and salvation they offered. In that time, the aliens fulfilled their promise, erecting grand, clean, efficient cities and springing up clinics across the globe to cure us of our diseases and defections. They have accepted our own into their ranks, serving alongside them to protect us from those dissidents and misguided rebels who would *still* strive to undo this paradise--the so-called Resistance and its old world icon, XCOM. \n\nADVENT protect us, they care for us, and we are thankful. With the aliens watching over us, our guiding Elders, what harm can possibly befall us?\n\n---\n\nThis is one of three [parallel](https://storium.com/game/xcom-2-violent-souls/) [stories](https://storium.com/game/xcom-2-this-hollow-valley/) that act as a sequel to [XCOM: Falls the Shadow](https://storium.com/game/xcom-falls-the-shadow/).
