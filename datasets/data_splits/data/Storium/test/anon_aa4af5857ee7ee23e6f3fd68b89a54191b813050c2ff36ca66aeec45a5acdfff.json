        "story": "#Preludes *One voice begins alone and plays a melody* --- --- That morninginasmuch as there was ever morning herethere was a collection of music waiting on his desk. Bach. He thought it was fitting. He shouldve recognized it for an omen. --- ***Meredith-*** When she opened her eyes, she knew it was wrong. It was the *sound*--or rather, the total lack of white ship noise that accompanied any warship like this one. If it wasnt something mechanical on the fritz, itd be the hum of air scrubbers, or the subtle vibrations from other crew wandering around nearby, or just the thrum of voices. But there was nothing. It was all silent. The other bunks were empty, and undisturbed. The viewport still showed space, but there was something off about the stars. It was like shed awoken in a simulation of her quarters, all uncanny valley, but someone had forgotten to get the small details right. So if she wasnt on the ship where the hell *was* she? --- ***Hallam-*** He left Faerie, driven only by the desire to find some place as broken as he felt, passing through the tree and emerging into an aspen grove, already aflame. The smoke stung and clawed at his lungs, but there was more of it than there was fire, when he could gather his senses. There *was* fire, though, a young blaze just beginning to find its feet. He knew that with a little time, itd have the kind of momentum that would be hard to stop. The air was too dry, but there wasnt much windyet. There was a chance to stop this early. The strangest part, though, was that as Hallam peered around the grove to get a sense of its scope and his surroundings, he wasnt sure whether he was really outdoors, or indoors; there were *shelves* somewhere behind the smoke, nestled amid the foliage. And *books.* At least, for a moment, it seemed like they were books Books burned pretty well, too, though. --- ***Kyllian-*** He swore his allegiance to darkness, destruction, and chaos. He banished the tyranny of light, heard the goddess scream into the aether, and found himself immersed in darkness. Alone. Plucked out by Maelevon to another plane? Was that part of the deal? Or was this something in retaliation, some cost for what hed done? Was this punishment? Sacrifice? Hed never killed a goddess before Hello? he called again, and the word echoed back at him. Slowly, though, the darkened halls resolved into something more. Maybe it was a gift of darkness, or maybe his eyes were just adjusting. In the dimness, he could make out wallsno, *shelves.* Vellum scrolls and old leatherbound tomes adorning them, not unlike an ancient, sacred temple archive of some kind. Though never had he heard of one so *vast* His vision continued to clear; the lamps lit around him, dimmed behind him, but they were getting brighter. All they revealed, though, was more of the same. A seemingly infinite library stretched onward. But at least it had branching paths. --- ***Rosalita-*** She rode as if her life depended on itit did, incidentallytrying to remember her geography, to know where to meet back up with her boys; with Tommy. But she hadnt counted on the storm. There shouldnt have been such a storm, but it came upon her with sudden and terrible speed, and soon she was immersed in it. Thunder sounded in a cacophony around her, lightning flashed and disoriented her, *Satanas* vocally expressed his dismay. Soon, she was well and truly lost. It mightve been five minutes, or it mightve been hours, but eventually a shape loomed ahead out of the haze of rain and lashing winds: a building. It was better than nothing. --- ***Monika-*** Not in a million years ...a million years ...million years The sound of her own voice spiraled around and around, growing faster, like an audio recording getting warped by some mechanical aberration. It spiked in volume, growing faster, warping, overwhelming the senses. **...illion yearsnyearsears-EARS-RRRRSSSS** And then there was nothing. No recording. No cameraman. Monika was seated exactly where she remembered sitting during the audition tape, except all the doors to other rooms were curiously absent. In their place, where the cameraman had been, there was a hazy ripple through the air. All shed meant to do was *touch* it, but with a heady rush, everything flipped around on her, and suddenly Monika was on the *other side* of the haze in the air. In front of her was a large, full-lengthpainting? Paintingof the room shed given the interview in. She wasnt in it. Left and right, as far as the eye could see, there were other large paintings.*They* had people in them. Some of them didnt look human, though; many, *many* of them looked like theyd been plucked out of sci-fi or fantasy movies. The place was otherwise quite nice, like high end art gallery, with lots of marble, polished stone, pillarsand it was *cold*. And empty, except for her, and all the paintings. Was thispart of the whole thing? Somehow? --- ***McCoy-*** He was in a cemetery. It wasnt a *normal* cemetery, either; it was about as stereotypically dark and ominous as one could be, which strongly suggested a dream or something more chemically-enhanced. If it were a movie, itd have been criticized for being too over-the-top: the thick fog, the greenish luminescence, the leaning tombstones and looming mausoleumsall the goddamn *ghosts*. Most of them werent clear enough to make out, but they sure as hell were there: their voices a muted murmur across the wind, distinguishable only as heavy with regret and sorrow; their shapes more movement than imagea hint of something at one periphery, a rush of wind past his shoulder, that kind of thing. He could *almost* make them out. They seemed to be getting clearer, after all. --- ***Romy-*** She was alone in what should have been the bookstore: no Barty, no Wainwright. Another look around assured her that it was *definitely* too long an aisle, far too large for the space, and with more branching aisles than she remembered. And the air! It was as if a vast space had opened up around her, and the stuffy bookstore air was rushing out, replaced by the coolness of the outdoors. Only *that* wasnt true, either. As far as she could tell, she was still indoors. The bookstore was getting very large, now. It was getting difficult to tell which direction was which, too; despite the seemingly unending secondhand books and diverse array of volumes, there was a sameness to one row after the next that made orienting oneself challenging. It would be easy to get lost in a place like this. --- ***Verne-*** He wasnt sure exactly what went down with the people he was with, the folks what had a gun on them, and the feller stealing supplies. Had there been a scuffle? Had they run? He had a vague recollection of running down a slender side passage in that cavern, trying to get well and clear of any firefight. But it had just gone on, and on, and now it seemed like hed been plunging through this tunnel for ages. It was looking less and less like a cavern, too. The walls were turning from rough rock into smooth stone, and then into brick; the floor from an irregular incline to a ramp to stairs; overhead, at some point, a naked bulb suspended, offering a struggling light. Place looked more like a cellar or basement than it did a cave, all of a sudden. Hello? His voice didnt echo, which was the first surprising thing; the second was that he started hearing *other* voices up ahead. Coursevoices could also be trouble. Some of em just were. No sooner did Verne reckon he didnt have much choice but to head forward anyway, when lo and behold, a branch in the tunnelor rather, another corridoropened up to one side. Another way. But should he take it, or head to the voices? Could be the folk he was traveling with; could be the devil, too, come to collect. It sure was getting weird enough for it"

        "story": "#Act I - The Way the World Ends *If you should wake to a man-dead world, where virtually all of human life has been dissolved from the face of the earth, leaving behind only buildings, bridges, machines . . . if you should awake to such a world tomorrow morning, what would you do? [Where would you go?]( --- It started slowly, at first: a UFO sighting here, a blurry photo of a creature never before seen on earth over there, and scattered reports of clandestine strike teams arriving to quickly suppress and clean up strange anomalieslike Men in Black if they had a SEAL Team Six. It seemed so preposterous, so impossible, that it was easy to dismiss, even with the evidence accumulating by the day. Our own culture had trained us to do it, after all. Soon enough, though, it was impossible to ignore: the abductions, the attacks on cities, the steadily accumulating footage of monstrous creatures and advanced weaponry discharged in public, the *spaceships*. Humanity had finally made contact with aliens, and they were *not* friendly. There was a lot of fear in those days, when so little was known. The aliens would make a move, an attack, and humanity could only *respond,* and that response was inevitably XCOM; everyone knew the name eventually, and realized as well that the United Nations had devised this program in secret decades ago, had been *expecting* thisand had kept it quiet as long as they could. Humanitys defenders were unknown, unelected, and unaccountable. Our fate was out of our hands. And humanity was clearly outmatched, though it would still be months before the aliens decided to leverage the full force of their technological superiority against us. In that time, they worked in secret, with agents who walked among us. We didnt know it yet, but they were hard at work convincing the powerful people of the world that the best way, the safest way, the *only* way humanity could endure this invasion was to capitulate to the aliens demands: to lay down their arms, welcome the invaders, and turn over control of our cities and militaries and institutions to them. In return, the aliens offered them a veritable paradise without hunger or disease or war. Humanity could have everything it ever longed for, fought for, *killed* forexcept its freedom. The aliens had arrived in March. In July, the ADVENT Coalition was formed from Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Mexico, newly united under a single government both human and alien. Other nations joined them: Belgium, the Netherlands, Guatemala, Belize, and more. But before October was gone, all pretense was finished: ADVENT announced that any nation that wouldnt welcome the aliens and join the Coalition willingly would be *forcibly* brought into it. Open war. This time, the aliens didnt hold back. Their advanced weaponry, their monstrous shock troops, their spectacularly advanced spacecraft, their *mind control*. Humanity fought valiantly, but it was never a question of *if* but *when* humanity would fall. By March, 2016, there was no meaningful organized government left on Earth to fight them. ADVENT declared the world unified, finally at peace, and set to work rebuilding the world as the aliensthe *Elders*--envisioned it. But like everything else about ADVENT, it had always been a lie. --- In the fraught, early chaos of those days, all the worlds concerns fell away and distilled into just one: survive. Though the details of circumstances differed, humans everywhere *did* manage to persevere despite what ADVENT and the aliens could bring to bear. Not enough for our institutions, perhaps, but enough that individuals everywhere yet lived who could remember where they were, and what they did when that primal necessity was all that remained. They *survived.*"

        "story": "#Act I - Enemy Within ##March 2029 *What you see is not real* *Those who know will not tell* *All is lost, sold your souls* *To this [brave new world]( --- It was a day not unlike many others in City 31 (formerly Pittsburgh, briefly New Pittsburgh). The weather was temperate, the streets clean, and everything seemed to be running like clockwork. Viewing things only superficially, one could be mistaken for assuming the whole city ran with idyllic precision and ease. But the devil, as always, was in the details. Not that many people talked about devils anymore. Once upon a time, many had insisted that the Elders and the other species they guided were devils, and that had since been proven wildly false. Now, people talked less and less of superstition and supernatural belief. After all, with the miracles occurring every day, with the floating images of near-angels in their own midst, it wasnt really a matter of *belief* at all. Still, despite the decline of religion, St. Anthonys Chapel still stood. Thered been a lot of talk about decommissioning it, using its valuable place for something of more tangible use to the common goodbut there were also a lot of people who seemed to *like* the old chapel. It had history; symbolism; meaning. And lots of old relics, apparently. Words come from above, City 31s Content Director explained to the other media content planners**Vesta** includedat the daily meeting. Theyre going to repurpose the site of the chapel, and weve been asked to help the populace understand this decision. In other words, they had to put a positive spin on what was surely going to piss off a segment of the populace. Nobody wanted Lancers getting called in to suppress a wave of unrest. **Libby** was present as well, as one of the more important go-fers not otherwise preoccupied with other matters. Her biggest project remained the youth group, and that didnt consume her time until much later in the day. But even if she wasnt making decisions, she could still offer inputor at least get people to say things that might have some utility later on. --- Elsewhere in the city, **Jon** was also struggling with the fallout of this impending decision, albeit unexpectedly. Thatsnot what we do, he explained to the woman in front of him, pleading with him to take the box she held out. Youre looking for the museum. They wont take it, she said hurriedly. They say its not part of theiruh, how did he put it?--Not part of the legacy theyre conserving. Please, I just dont want these to be *destroyed*, they have spiritual value. They are *actual fragments of saints*. Even if you dont believe, surely you can see the historical and cultural value. But this is a library Cant you juststore them somewhere? Keep them safe? And when weve found somewhere to keep our faith going, well come get them. Please? It was *probably* doable, but it was certainly not one of his official duties and would be deeply frowned upon if an ADVENT administrator ever found out. That could have serious repercussions. Not that they usually paid much attention to things out of public sight --- Shiblon had never seemed very keen on the Chapel repurposing project, but now that it seemed all but certain, he seemed *very* busy. **Layla** hadnt seen him at work quite this early before. Not that he wasnt diligent, but this did seem unusual. Maybe hed thought his counter proposal would go through, and now that it wasnt, he had work to catch up on. That was probably it. The extra quiet in the morning meant she had time to reflect on how theyd come to where they are, though, and that wasnt necessarily bad. Sometimes it did seem to be too good to be true --- One idea getting tossed around in the media meeting included another initiative underway in the city: a special opportunity for workers at the newly refurbished gene therapy clinic to collaborate with some of the manufacturing districts best and brightest on a new prototype implant. There was admittedly some question surrounding how seriously to take this initiative: how much of it was an educational opportunity, and how much of it was a serious undertaking. After all, the projects directors had specifically assigned very young (though up-and-coming) specialists to the initiative. Included among them were **Chloe** Kethry, **Lucas** Almeida, and Alec Fischer. They were all near enough in age to already know one another from school and aptitude evals, all respectably skilled (even very impressive, by some marks), but why not more senior personnel? Whatever the reason, these youths and others had been given the project. The goal: review a proposed prototype implant for efficacy and see if they could improve on the design. Of course, it wasnt expected to be easy, and no small part of that was because they hadnt actually been *told* much about the implant, or its purpose. They knew it was intended for the Peacekeeping division, but not precisely *how*. Theyd been given schematics, one copy of the device itself, and several benchmark test results. It seemed they were expected to strictly focus on the mechanics of the implant. Though that didnt mean that they couldnt speculate --- **Cole** was expected to be in classsuch as it was for the citizens on sub-basic income, living out in Shankville outside the walls. He had half a mind to skip it; he was already eyeing an early jump into the workforce, hoping to make some extra credits out in the meat vats, like some of his peers already were. The only thing that kept him from jumping in full force was that he was also distracted training for his debut fight. It was *tonight.* How could he focus on book learning when he had to get ready for his trial bout tonight? It was set to be in Old Town, of course, deep in the tunnels where such unauthorized fights could go unnoticed. But *everyone* was going to be there. Anyone worth a damn, anyway. Maybe even Did his eyes deceive him? There, standing at the Switchyard station, waiting for her own train (probably to somewhere much better) was none other than semi-famous street racer **Starlyn** Roth (though she did above board racing as well, Cole was of course most interested in the tunnel races she sometimes engaged in). Outside the fighting world, racers were the next greatest thing. And right now, it seemed Starlyn was being stalked and followed by two grim, stony-faced individuals in bland, dark clothes. A more astute observer mightve realized these were ADVENT administrators intent on having a chat with Starone could only guess whybut Cole didnt have all that much experience with city administrators. Whether he understood who they wereor even caredremained to be seen. If Star was in trouble, maybe it didnt matter from who. --- **Maya** was preparing for school, too and deeply considering something so terrible that shed never before dared to contemplate it: skipping class. It wasnt that ADVENT was particularly punishing about missing schoolat least in small incrementsbut it was her obligation to be there! And Maya hated shirking her responsibilities. And what if lack of perfect attendance somehow disqualified her from the Peacekeeper program? But there were extenuating circumstances. Her parents and Uncle Barrett were up to somethingshed heard them whispering againand she *really* wanted to know what it was. She suspected it had something to do with this weird, special new project Alec was getting because of how perfectly smart he was; Maria said Lucas was on it, too, and that just made her *more* curious. Now, it *was* Marias idea to go snoop and figure out what their older brothers were up to, so maybe it wouldnt go too badly for her if they were caught. As long as they were finished before youth group meeting in the afternoon, maybe it wouldnt be too bad --- Speaking of Uncle Barrett, he was already hard at work. He and **Ren** worked the same beat for manufacturing: the resource retrieval, repair, supply, resupply, and other logistics stuff that, for the most part, nobody else wanted to do. It generally involved a lot of running around, a lot of sifting through databases, squinting at serial numbers, conversations with other employees whod forgotten to check equipment out, and so on. In Rens case, she was perpetually stuck with the job because of her many, many.*many* infractions. A problem worker, it was something of a miracle that they kept her on at all, except that she did wind up with a very impressive recovery ratedespite seeming to constantly lose datapads. Barrett, on the other hand Ren was never really sure how Barrett got stuck with the job, but he actually seemed content with it. Better than sticking my hand under a giant laser, hed chortle. Secretly, Ren wondered if it wasnt that both of them shared the same sort of miserable past: they were both survivors from across the ocean, from nations that had surrendered to ADVENT rapidly and wasted no time in breaking up their families. Barrett had recovered most of his, but Ren had always suspected that, like her, he was still looking for others. And logistics was a decent place to color outside the lines a little, as it were. On this particular morning, Barrett seemed especially involved insomething. He was being cagey about it, which meant it probably wasnt strictly within their assigned duties. But maybe Ren could tease the information out of him."
