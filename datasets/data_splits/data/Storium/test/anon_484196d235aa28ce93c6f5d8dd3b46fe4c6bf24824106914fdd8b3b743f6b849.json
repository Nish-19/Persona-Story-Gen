        "writing_prompt": "A fanatical lord gathers a reluctant group of outcasts\u2014each with unique skills and motives\u2014to breach a magical ward and overthrow a ruler he deems a blasphemer. But as their journey unfolds, the line between righteousness and tyranny begins to blur.",
        "story": "Pantheons Call was thoroughly routed. Emant Harrown, Lord Elect of the religious order, sat tall on his horse outside the gates of Yistria. Behind him were the remnants of the small army he had commanded in the city. Had he but known the declaration Jaharet would make, he would have mustered the entirety of Pantheons Call. But she had taken him by surprisehe and the rest of Danthes. She had exposed herself in that moment for the charlatan she was, an impure soul muddying the holy mantle of leadership she had been gifted. And he and his followers had reacted in the only way they couldthey had attempted to capture the Blasphemer and force her to Ascend. Theyd almost had her. But Jaharet too had followers, men and women devoted to her in a manner that was almost fanatical. Her Empyrean Guard and the sentinels of the Sanctum had joined together to protect her.Theyd bought her precious time so that she and those closest to her could flee to the Sanctum, the holiest of temples located deep in the heart of the city. And from within the Sanctum, some of her protectorsthose clerics and priests and mages that had sided with herhad come together to create a magical ward that no sword or magic at Harrowns disposal could breach. She was impervious now, safe in her cocoon of sorcery. But not for long. The small force Harrown commanded had surrounded the Sanctum. There they would have remained until the whole of Pantheons Call had come to aid them, if it had not been for the unforeseen. Jaharets alliances ran deep and spread far. Not even a day after her announcement was made, a large rebel faction from Morialor had marched into the city. Formidable though Harrown and his men were in battle, they were outnumbered greatly when this rebel group banded together with those loyal to the Empyrean. It was to her credit, Harrown mused now as he stared at the city denied to him, that Jaharet did not order he and his men slain. It was also going to be something she would come to regret most intensely. She had allowed them to fall back and regroup outside the gates. And then she had ordered that all city gates be closed and all its walls manned. The Lord Elect suddenly wheeled his horse around. The beast, a magnificent destrier, snorted as it turned on its haunches. Before him were the remnants of the men hed commanded in the city, all of them looking equally as grim as their leader, all of them sporting the emblem of the Five Eyes somewhere on their clothing, weapons, or shields. Have the men been sent? Harrown asked one of his commanders as he rode past. The commander heeled his horse forward so that it kept pace with the Lord Elects mount. They have, Lord. Harrown mused on this. When the magical aegis went up around the Sanctum, Harrown had known instinctively that breaching it would require some creative thinking. Hed sent word out of the city with swift messengers, instructing those in various outposts throughout the country to scry for certain individuals who were in possession of particular skills. These skills, when brought together and put to use in tandem, would ultimately be the way the ward would fall. And so men had been dispatched, armed and capable, to retrieve these individuals chosen. Harrown knew they would not all come willingly. No, some wouldl resist, which is why certain pressures had been applied to convince them that this task is in their best interests. Of course, some of them would be all too willing to lend their skills to this most righteous of crusades. As Harrown and his men rode away from Yistria, heading south, he carefully considered those that were chosen for this task the Vessanian clansmen that lived outside civilization, whose skills with a horse and bow would provide protection when violence inevitably happens the clever, impious merchant, whose connections and influence would be necessary to navigate through a nation turned hostile against those that would harm Jaharet the willful mage, a risky choice that was green in experience yet vast in untapped power, who would lend her skills to breaching the ward that protects the Empyrean Daughter and the messenger, whose knowledge of Danthes roads, paths, and secret ways would guide them all through a hostile landscape, whose lack of allegiances makes him perhaps the most trustworthy of the lot All of them would be escortedsome perhaps by forceto meet Lord Elect Harrown. And he would impart upon them the absolute necessity of what they must do. He would make certain they realize that they must not fail. Until then, however there were other matters he must attend to. And so it was that he and his men left the Holy City and its untrue ruler behind. *** In other parts of Danthes, paths were altered. Harrowns men sought them out unerringly, their locations revealed through the scrying of Pantheon Calls own priests and mages. One by one they were made to understand that they had no choice in this, that they must obey. And one by one they left their homes, their families, the things that mattered to them to set out on these new blind paths."

        "writing_prompt": "As the sun sets over the gleaming city of Heracanth, you find yourself boarding the grand ship *Loyal Medean* alongside an eclectic group of passengers, all bound for a mysterious months-long voyage. What secrets lie ahead on the open sea, and what purpose has truly brought you all together?",
        "story": "It was early evening in Heracanth. The descending sun glinted off the stained glass lanterns affixed to posts that line the street, casting an enchanting kaleidoscope pattern of colors upon the ground. The streets and walkways in the main city were all cobblestone, well maintained and accented by immaculately trimmed hedges, flowering shrubs, and elegant statues. Closer to the palace, the streets and paths made of crushed rock and crystal gleamed by light of sun or moon. Heracanth the nation was known far and wide for its power and wealth; Heracanth the city was famed for its order and beauty. The docks, where practicality took precedence over aesthetics, still managed to be somewhat pleasing to the eye. At the end of their shifts the dock managers ensured that all was in order ropes properly coiled, cargo stocked efficiently, docks themselves free and clear of anything that might prove unsightly or an impediment to walking. This evening some extra attention had been paid to the west docks, where a small crowd of people stood waiting. Moored some distance away in the bays deeper water were two ships, the smaller *Elfin Grace* and the larger *Loyal Medean*. Their sails were raised and those waiting at the docks could see signs of activity upon their decks. Three dinghies from both ships were being rowed across the bay, toward the waiting crowd. When they arrived they began to load their passengers and their luggage carefully and one at a time, the seamen within offering their aid to those that needed it. When all were seated the return trip began, some passengers conversing with the rowing officers, others choosing to appreciate the sight of the setting sun reflecting off the waters of the bay. The process of boarding the *Loyal Medean* for all the passengers and their luggage took some time, and when all were finally standing upon her decks, dusk was well under way. Lanterns hanging from the lower masts and attached to the main deck and taffrail illuminated the area in a warm glow. The deck itself was clean and orderly, and standing at attention to greet the new arrivals was a long row of officers. Their uniforms were eye-catching, to say the least, blue and white with bold yellow detailing. Standing in front of them were four other officers, who snapped out a salute the moment the last of the newcomers had boarded. One of them stepped forward. I am Adrian Anaros, he greeted in a rolling baritone that seemed perfect for shouting orders, Captain of the *Loyal Medean*. I welcome you all aboard. Anaros was a large man, wide in the shoulders and thick through the middle without being fat. He wore his fair hair long in typical Hercanthian fashion, tied back with a blue cord. He sported a neatly trimmed beard along his jaw and his deep set green eyes appraised the group before him in a manner that, while not quite jovial, was something close to it. He lifted his hand and made a gesture. The other three officers that had been with him stepped forward. Anaros began the introductions, starting with the dark-haired woman on his right. This is my commander, Valena Ambrose. Ambrose offered the group a small, clipped smile, dipping forward in a half-bow. These, Anaros said, now gesturing to his left, are the captain and commander of the *Elfin Grace* Captain Jilleen Davies and Commander Bravis Desstin. Davies was a tall woman, lean with a sharp, angular face. Despite her somewhat intimidating appearance the grin she gave the group was a welcoming one. Desstin, shorter than her considerably and boasting a thick brown moustache, seemed equally as affable. As you know, Anaros said, well be departing in the morning. The Imperator thought it best we spend this evening getting to know each other as well be travelling companions for the long months ahead. To that end, well be dining together in my quarters. The Imperator sent the cooks from his own kitchen. If any of you have dined at the palace before, you know exactly what kind of feast youre in for. Anaros began to move and beckoned for the passengers to follow. They did so, trailing after him as he walked across the deck toward his quarters. He halted at the door, waving with one arm for everyone to precede him. The interior was quite spacious, with most items shoved off to the side to make room for the large table that divided the room. The table had chairs enough for passengers and commanding officers and had a dark blue tablecloth and precisely arranged place settings. The meal is not yet done, Anaros said as he stepped inside. He continued with a wry smile, Im told the palace cooks find our galley to be somewhat lacking. Until then, I encourage you all to relax and enjoy yourselves. He pointed to a smaller table bolted to one wall that held numerous bottles, glasses, and tankards. Weve wine, whisky, and ale for those that prefer it. I would recommend not over-indulging, however a hangover is not pleasant while at sea. He crossed the room and poured himself a drink, a stream of whisky into a short glass. He held it aloft as he turned to face the group. To our success and safety on this voyage. Please help yourselves, get comfortable, and make your introductions."
