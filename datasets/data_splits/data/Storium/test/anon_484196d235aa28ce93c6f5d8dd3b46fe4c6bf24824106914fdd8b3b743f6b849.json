            "story_name": "The nation of Danthes is considered to be the holiest of lands. It is where the God Otarion sends his children, delivering unto his mortal flock the Empyrean rulers. For seven centuries the Empyrean have ruled Danthes. They are men and women born not of this world, but of another realm entirely where the Gods exist.\n\nThe Empyrean are only gifted to the world for a short time. After 40 years of rule, they must forsake their mortal forms and return to the realm of their origin. It is a ritual suicide. This event is known as the Ascendance. After one Empyrean has Ascended, another will appear after eleven days to continue providing Danthes with holy guidance. And so it has happened for several centuries, exactly as it is written in the Vellums of the first Empyrean, Malquin.\n\nThe current ruler of Danthes is the Empyrean Daughter Jaharet. Her rule has been especially blessed; Danthes is thriving. There have been no skirmishes with surrounding nations during her reign. Trade has flourished. The farmlands are bountiful. Such is the serenity and prosperity of Danthes that many imagine Jaharet to be the most favored of all the Empyrean Children.\n\nOn the eve of the fortieth year of her reign, however, the Empyrean Daughter does something unprecedented. She makes a proclamation that stuns the people of Danthes. She will not Ascend. She will remain in mortal form to guide Danthes to a glorious age such as it has never known. Such is the will of her father, she claims, he who is the God Otarion.\n\nThe kingdom is effectively sundered with this announcement. Many support Jaharet\u2019s continued rule, as she is wise, benevolent, and farseeing. There are those that believe she is not as she seems, however, and believe that she invites catastrophe. Foremost among those is the religious order known as Pantheon\u2019s Call.\n\nA war erupts within the capital city of Yistria. Pantheon\u2019s Call marshals its holy forces in an attempt to capture Jaharet and force her to Ascend. Jaharet\u2019s supporters are many, however; she and those loyal to her are able to sequester themselves within a fortified sanctum in the center of the city. Among Jaharet\u2019s followers are several of the city\u2019s most powerful priests and mages, and working in tandem they are able to create a magical ward that the opposing force cannot breach. Such is the nature of the ward that any person marked as a member of the religious order cannot pass.\n\nPantheon\u2019s Call is extremely powerful. It has vast resources to draw from. Its members are among the most renowned and powerful within Danthes. And so, with the use of mages within its ranks, the order begins to scry for individuals that could, with their strengths combined, breach the wards and mount a final assault on Jaharet and her followers.\n\nThis is no simple task. Because of Jaharet\u2019s popularity, a large part of Danthes' population wishes for her to remain as ruler. Anyone attempting to destroy her will be ostracized, reviled, and perhaps even killed. This does not matter to the members of Pantheon\u2019s Call. In order to ascertain that those they choose adhere to the mission, they coerce them into agreeing through threats that could lead to ruin, violence, death \u2026 or worse.\n\nThose people they recruit to breach the ward and assassinate Jaharet are from all walks of life. They are warriors. They are merchants. They are scholars and priests and riders.\n\nThey are you.\n\n***\n\n**Please note:** We've already started but I'm looking for one or two more players.

            "story_name": "Heracanth is a nation of conquest. Nestled between mountains and sea, its advantageous location makes it difficult to attack and even harder to invade. Bountiful farmland and plentiful mining has made it a prosperous country, and a significant portion of that wealth has been funneled into the military. The citizens of Heracanth have not known significant hardship in quite some time, aside from the ravages of a terrible wasting disease a decade ago. \n\nHeracanth is not an idle country. The rulers have always kept an eye on the horizon, sending out small and swift fleets of ships from the capital city of Eretra to scout lands both known and unknown for anything that might prove useful. The current ruler is Imperator Trexen, a man of violent appetites. In a less civilized locale, he would be referred to as a warmonger. Because his efforts and aspirations have led to lives of luxury for most of the entire population of Heracanth, he is instead labelled a hero and a visionary. \n\nEleven months ago, a scouting fleet discovered a landmass far to the southeast. Scouting parties sent ashore encountered fertile forests and rolling grasslands rich with wildlife, as well as  a few small farming villages. The local populace welcomed them, fed them, and housed them. They called their land Obarem. When asked if they were interested in trade, the villagers responded positively, which led the scouts to the discovery of the strange and beautiful gemstones mined from deep within Obarem.\n\nHeracanthians were no stranger to such opulence, but the likes of these stones they\u2019d never seen before. The stones were mostly small and always warm to touch. Turning them one way or another revealed flickers of light trapped within, always moving, never the same. The effect was stunning. The natives called the stones \u201cincendium.\u201d The scouts bartered their own goods for several of the stones and returned to their fleets. It took four months to return to Heracanth bearing words and proof of what they\u2019d found. It took Imperator Trexen only three weeks to make the decision to dispatch the bulk of his army to Obarem.\n\n\u201cInvasion\u201d was a word he deemed too callous to use. Instead he referred to his intentions for Obarem as \u201cwelcome annexation\u201d with the implication being that the population of Obarem would appreciate their arrival. Most of Heracanth knew the truth of the matter. Most did not care.\n\nSeven months ago, the Imperator dispatched the flagship of his fleet, the *Conquerant.* Barely two years old, the *Conquerant* was the pinnacle of Heracanth\u2019s naval warfare, a stately man o\u2019war that the Imperator himself had commissioned. She had never seen combat and it was deemed there was no better opportunity than now, as by all reports the military might of Obarem was paltry in comparison. The send-off for the *Conquerant* and the rest of the Heracanthian fleet was a day of revelry and festivity. The Imperator made an appearance at the docks, outfitted in his glinting golden ceremonial armor, and gave a rousing speech as his warships sailed southeast behind him. \n\nMonths passed. Messages sent from the fleet were verbose at first. That changed after the invasion began. They became more intermittent, more terse. It was clear things were not going well, that unexpected complications had arisen. Just what those complications were, however, remained unclear. \n\nFinally, a month ago, one final message was received. It read only: *Obarem is unconquerable.*\n\nNo ships have returned save the small sloop carrying that final message. It floated into the shipyard, unmanned. Those who boarded it discovered five bodies all bereft of any signs of disease or wounds. They had lived just long enough, it seemed, for the sloop to return home. \n\nThe Imperator is determined to discover what happened to his navy. The presumed loss of the *Conquerant* vexes him greatly. He has assembled another small feet that will travel to Obarem, comprised of only two ships: the *Elfin Grace*, a sloop, and the *Loyal Medean*, a schooner. The crews have strict orders: survey Obarem\u2019s shorelines from afar, avoid confrontation, discover the fate of the Heracanthian navy. \n\nHowever, there is another mission at hand. The Imperator has assembled a group of skilled and knowledgeable individuals that he has charged with two tasks: the first, to locate the *Conquerant* or what is left of her and the second, to ferret out the source of the Heracanthian navy\u2019s defeat and learn whatever they can about the country and its people in the process. Neither task will be easy and indeed may prove deadly, which is something each of these individuals is acutely aware of. \n\nYou are a member of this group, selected personally by Imperator Trexen himself by merit of your deeds, education, or renown. You are prepared for adventure and even death, all in the name of Heracanth\u2019s enduring glory. \n\n\u2013  \n\n**Please Note:** This setting is somewhat similar to that of the Golden Age of Piracy (17th and 18th centuries). Therefore, ships have cannons and people can use guns (flintlock and volley pistols, musket rifles and blunderbuss) along with melee weapons (cutlass, saber, dirk, dagger). When writing up your character, please tell me what weapon you would prefer (if you want one) with a limit of one ranged, one melee so that I can provide you with the appropriate asset cards. \n\nThis is also a fantasy game, so there *is* magic. I\u2019ve purposefully left that wide open so that you can get creative. Mages, clerics, priests, I welcome them all. However, please keep it within reason \u2013 no omnipotent archmages, please. Characters with magic should include their preferred weapon (staff, wand, spellbook, religious medallion, whatever) if they want one so I can make up an asset card. \n\nIf you\u2019d rather make a character that\u2019s less inclined for combat, that\u2019s perfectly fine. Let me know what kind of items they\u2019d be carrying around with them for the purpose of their mission and I\u2019ll be sure to dispense them once we start.\n\nI\u2019ve made up a few cards but feel free to write up your own! \n\n--\n\n**We have already started, but we lost a player. I am looking for 1-2 more to join us. Because we're already underway, it would be beneficial for applicants to catch up on the story. Being as we're only a month in, there isn't too much to read. I'd also recommend checking what characters currently exist!**\n\n\n",
