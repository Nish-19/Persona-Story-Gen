        "story": "Jie Junlong gazed down at the brightly lit Italian peninsula which was currently filling the porthole of his ship on what would be its last orbit before departing Earth. That he was a high-ranking member of the Chinese politburo meant he was afforded a luxury cabin making for a very comfortable passage to Colonia Proxima Centauri; that pleased him greatly. That the ship which would take him to the furthest-flung human colony was a Roman vessel named the *Hierusalem* irked him no end. He was starting off on an official state voyage--a good will tour--to meet with Rome's newly elected Senior Consul, but he could *only* make said voyage aboard a *Roman* ship. Chinese vessels had not been granted landing rights at the colony as of yet, which was one of the top items on his agenda. Not that he'd be negotiating from a position of strength. China (or *Sina,* as the Romans called it) had not negotiated from a position of strength with Rome for nearly two centuries. The Politburo had, of course, been very eager for that all to change, and they had launched a major effort to take advantage of the delightful chaos brought about by the Roman civil war to do just that. Marcus Labienus Crassus, the man New Beijing had been secretly backing, had assured them that once he had assumed the Purple, many spheres of influence would have been renegotiated, and many of the geopolitical realities of the current world order would have been *reordered* more in China's favor. First on the list (and verbally agreed to by Crassus) would have been a formal end to Nippon's status as \"Friend and Ally of the Roman People.\" *That* would have started the ball rolling for Chinese re-expansion into the Oceanus Pacificus. China had, of course agreed to recognize Crassus as the rightful Emperor, and had been prepared to cause all sorts of destabilizing mischief on Earth, reigniting a cold war with Rome, discrediting Claudius IX, and setting the stage for, well...*everything.* Crassus' devastating raid on the Roman colony sprawling across the face of Titan had severely rocked the Senate's confidence in Claudius, visibly weakening the new Emperor's grip. Then came Saturninas. Rather than remaining ensconced on the Palatine Hill, Claudius had embarked in the Roman invasion fleet and accompanied it to the Proxima system, where it won a stunning victory. Within a mere ninety minutes of making the jump, just about every ship in the Crassian fleet had either been destroyed or captured. Marcus Crassus had fallen on his sword, and that was that. Nothing had changed. If anything, the Romans had become even more arrogant. Two days after the election, Gallus had--with the Emperor's blessings--extended a formal invitation for the *Sinensi* to send a delegation to Proxima Centauri, ostensibly for the purpose of opening up a trade route, but also to rub their noses in the fact that Rome was still firmly in control of all her possessions. And, speaking of *firmly in control*, Jie's thoughts were yanked back to the news vid playing on his cabin entertainment display. Some Roman anchorman was going on breathlessly about their so-called \"Victory Games\" which were to begin the next day. *Another blatantly overstated bit of Roman self-congratulatory propaganda,* he thought to himself. Jie felt a slight jolt as *Hierusalem* began her burn to leave orbit. The inertial dampeners quickly compensated and the sensation of acceleration was barely discernible. He reached for a cigarette, wondering if he had brought enough for the journey. Drawing deeply and exhaling slowly Jie absent-mindedly stared at the screen. *\"...That's right, Johannes. Hrodan has become the big story of these games, and they don't even begin until tomorrow evening!\"* \"*Hardly surprising, Martinus! It's not every day you get a sentient non-human competing in the arena. In fact, it's never happened before!\" * *\"Right again! And, as our new allies the Pomeranii have warned us, this Hrodan is one tough customer! I mean, just look at those stats! Strength like, well like I don't know like what. Look at those numbers...\" * \"Sir? You'll have to put that out.\" Jie's eyes left the screen and came to rest on the neatly dressed steward standing at the entrance to his cabin. \"No smoking five minutes either side of an engine burn. The rules are in your passenger brochure.\" *A brochure printed only in Latin,* Jie thought bitterly to himself. It would have never occurred to his hosts to have anything printed inn Mandarin, or any other language. That you understood Latin well enough to communicate with Romans was simply *assumed.* \"Yes, of course,\" Jie agreed, answering the steward in the approved language as he snubbed out the cigarette. \"'When in Rome...',\" he added smiling mirthlessly as he did so. \"Thank you, Mr. Junlong,\" replied the steward, forcing himself to appear pleasantly amused at the *Sinensi's* feeble attempt at humor. If only he had a denarius for every time he heard a foreigner use *that* tired old maxim.. Rising from his leather chair, Jie Junlong walked over to the liquor cabinet and poured himself a large tumbler of golden brown liquid. Earth was no longer visible from his porthole; the angles weren't right. \"So, here I am,\" he said to himself. \"A man from China: travelling from a Roman world to *another* Roman world orbiting a distant Roman star aboard a Roman ship as a Roman sports program touted Roman games celebrating another Roman victory ushering in another century or two of presumed Roman dominance... A true believer in both the Party and his nation's greatness, Jie Junlong nonetheless admitted dejectedly to himself that the Mandate of Heaven wasn't going to be realized any time soon."

        "writing_prompt": "On a remote Pacific island in the aftermath of World War II, a stranded Japanese garrison fights not only the despair of surrender but a growing, unspeakable horror emerging from the jungle as the sun sets.",
        "story": "#PRELUDE ##Agrihan Island, 13 September 1945 Captain Ichiro Hashimoto sat on the beach, his gaze fixed westward where the sun was low on the horizon. Clouds had been building up throughout the day and now, at this late afternoon hour, the sun was bursting from behind the clouds in a manner which reminded Hashimoto of his nation's flag. *His defeated nation.* Their battle flag was a representation of the Rising Sun, Nippon itself. But this, Hashimoto mused, was the *setting sun.* How appropriate. They had picked up the transmission from Tokyo on the 18th of August. Hashimoto and his men were shocked and astounded to hear the voice of the Emperor *himself,* ordering all fighting men to cease hostilities. Some of his men, most notably his second in command, Lieutenant Hideki Kenji, stubbornly held out hope that the order meant that the Allies had capitulated, or at least had agreed on a conditional end to the war...one which left some, at least, of Japan's empire intact. But it was a pipe dream. Kenji had listened in expressionless silence when the next broadcast from Tokyo detailed the terms of the surrender being worked out. Hashimoto, who had a rather good command of the English language, had dialed into the American's Armed Forces Radio broadcasts to learn more. There had been some sort of bomb of unimaginable power which, after being dropped on his homeland twice, had persuaded the Imperial government to capitulate. Two weeks ago, a lone B-29 had flown low over Agrihan Island, dropping leaflets reiterating the fact that hostilities were over, and detailed the procedures to follow when American forces eventually arrived at their location to accept their surrender. *They couldn't arrive soon enough.* If they had any hope of surviving the curse that was stalking them, killing them off one by one, the Americans had better arrive soon. His thoughts were disturbed by the sound of a man screaming from within a darkened hut at the edge of the treeline. Hashimoto gave a long sad sigh. Even if the Americans arrived this evening, it would be too late for Kenji. \"All is in readiness, Captain.\" Sergeant Nakamura, ever the proper soldier, saluted stiffly as he delivered the news. \"Sir, we can wait no longer. It is almost sunset, and Lieutenant Kenji is calling for you.\" He had a task to perform. Hashimoto entered the hut, his eyes taking a few moments to adjust to the gloom. Kenji could no longer tolerate sunlight, and his final days had been spent in perpetual shadow. Hideki Kenji sat kneeling on a tatami mat, stripped to the waist and glistening with sweat, the wound on his neck clearly visible. Before him lay an unsheathed sword. Next to the sword sat a ceremonial cup of sake, a drink meant to cheer the heart of a samurai as he prepared to step from this life into the next. The sake remained untouched. The only drink which would slake Kenji's thirst could no longer be found in a bottle. From his kneeling position, Kenji bowed to his superior officer, deeply and formally. He lost his balance, putting out a trembling arm to keep him upright. Hashimoto regarded Kenji for a moment. He was a mere shell of his former self. The suffering he endured over these last three days since his wounding by that obscene thing which had once been a man had left him in an increasing state of agony, relieved only temporarily during the hours of darkness. They had all seen it all happen before. Too many times. All of them--even Hideki Kenji--knew what was going to happen once the sun set. As it was doing now. The lower limb of the sun touched the horizon, turning the Pacific into a sea of blood. \"Hideki, I shall write your family, telling them of your honorable death,\" Hashimoto assured him. \"*Honorable,* Captain Hashimoto?\" Hideki shot back through gritted teeth, struggling to hold back the thing which was taking control of his body. \"This is no *banzai* charge,\" he spat, a tear escaping from eyes that were beginning to turn black. \"*Very* honorable,\" Hashimoto assured him. \"Before the enemy can triumph, you will do what many another samurai has done before you. Be at peace.\" \"Captain!\" Sergeant Nakamura's voice was urgent. \"The sun.\" \"I am...ready.\" Lieutenant Kenji picked up the sword, holding it in front of him with as steady a hand as he could manage. Hashimoto, his own sword in hand, positioned himself behind his lieutenant. Sergeant Nakamura stared at Kenji--what was left of him--in growing dread. The whites of his eyes were almost entirely black now, iris and pupil...all black. His gritted teeth appeared to be growing sharper before Nakamura's very eyes. Kenji gave a gutteral roar and plunged the blade into his abdomen, grunting involuntarily in pain. Black eyes staring vacantly, he began to pull the embedded blade laterally through his abdomen. Uttering a roar of his own, Captain Hashimoto swung his *katana* with a mighty downward stroke. Lieutenant Hideki Kenji's headless body slumped forward, peaceful at last. \"Quickly now,\" Hashimoto ordered. \"No time to spare.\" His men bore the body to a waiting grave, placing it in its final resting place quickly. The head was buried a good fifty meters distant. Why the surviving members of the garrison had adapted this practice, nobody quite understood, but neither did anyone question it. Prudence seemed to dictate doing just so. Twilight was fading as the last shovelful of sand was slapped down onto the grave. \"Defensive perimeter,\" Hashimoto ordered. \"You all know the drill.\" Quickly and quietly, the soldiers climbed into a circle of foxholes arranged in a tight ring on the beach. Fires had been lit at a range of fifty meters in a semicircle facing the jungle. If anything emerged from the dense undergrowth, they'd have at least a few moments to engage it--them--before their position was overrun. Casting one last glance to seaward in the hopes of seeing lights from approaching ships, Captain Hashimoto was once again disappointed. As he refocused his gaze in the direction of the menacing jungle, he wondered if the new bomb the Americans had developed would work against...*them.*"

        "writing_prompt": "In a future where the Roman Empire never fell and now rules the stars, a small task group of warships is sent to intercept an unknown alien fleet near Pluto. Outnumbered and outgunned, the crew must face impossible odds while the Senate awaits news of their fate.",
        "story": "#Prologue: Aboard the Roman Imperial Ship Sicilia #Enroute to Intercept FROM: IMPERIAL FLEET HEADQUARTERS TO: IMPERIAL WARSHIP SICILIA SUBJ: EMERGENCY ORDERS PROCEED AT BEST SPEED VICINITY OF PLUTO. UNKNOWN SHIPS DETECTED. ASSUMED HOSTILE FORMIX INVESTIGATE. ENGAGE IF ID CONFIRMED. Primus Tertius Athanasius scoffed as he read the emergency orders flashed onto the comms panel. Orders confirmed, Captainfor what its worth. Sitting in the command chair, *Navis Praefectus* Ioannes Paulus glanced up from his own screen to regard his Executive Officer. Nothing we didnt already know, but at least now we have authority to engage. Time to intercept? Ninety minutes, Sir. Paulus did the math in his head. 90 minutes to intercept, 30 minutes to engagewho was he kidding? Theyd be lucky if they lasted ten minutes against them. Five hours for the light from the battle to reach Earth. He glanced at the chronometer. Theyd know in six and a half hours that Task Group 40 had died nobly for the Senate and People of Rome. Itd be around 0600 when the Junior Consul saw the results. Then hed have the singular privilege of briefing the battles outcome to the Senate when they convened promptly at 0900. He thought of his old roommate from the Imperial Star Academy. Tiberius Valerius Lupus hadnt graduated at the top of their class, but he had certainly proven himself when and where it counted. Lupus had always been a couple of steps ahead of the rest of them career-wise. First in their class to cruise to Proxima Centauri, first to become Primus aboard a warship, first get commandand sure as *hades* first in their class to achieve Senatorial rank, let alone the Consulship. *Well, old chum* Paulus thought to himself, *I shall be first to shake hands with the Ferryman. Ill have beaten you to something at last!* Paulus smiled sardonically to himself. Very few believed in the old religion of Republican Rome, lost in the mists of time before it had become the City of Peter and Paul. *First to the Pearly Gates* would have been a far more apt description, but the old vernacular had held on in Roman speech, even if the old pagan religion had faded. Selecting the *Loqui Inter Naves* (Talk Between Ships, or TBS), he waited a moment for the other two captains to join him on the circuit. Why do you think theyre here, Primus? In their minds, are they continuing the previous war, or has some genius at Proxima Centauri or beyond managed to kick open their anthill again? Athanasius shrugged. Ill make one last inspection of the weapons crews. Make sure theyre in fighting trim. Make it quick, Paulus said after him as he exited the bridge. Pressing the transmit button on TBS, he said, All ships, Task Group 40, this is *Sicilia,* over. *Liguria*, over. *Cisalpina,* over. *Sicilia,* the fifth ship in the *Trireme* class, was accompanied by two smaller *Bireme* class ships, the *Liguria* and *Cisalpina.* His task group was a versatile mix of ships well-suited to picket duty, but against a large force like this one, they had little chance of success. The task group was off-station, headed for a scheduled refueling evolution at Orbital Station Neptune, and had been just an hour away from docking when their sensors had picked up light announcing the arrival of the Formic fleet. There wasnt supposed to be a jump point in that portion of the Kuiper belt, so it hadnt been actively patrolled. They had already been in the Sol system three hours before Task Group 40 was even aware they were here. Paulus had turned the group around as soon as they had received the sensor data. Nine ships exhibiting strong blue shift. They were definitely headed toward the inner solar system. Task Group 40 had been on this intercept heading for nearly eleven hours now at a speed of 0.2c, or two tenths the speed of light. It didnt feel like they were traversing over 37,000 Roman miles every second, but space was vast. They were burning their fuel at an excessive rate; even if they survived the engagement they wouldnt have sufficient reserves for a direct burn back to Neptuneor anywhere. The best they could hope for would be to insert themselves into a long parabolic descent towards Jupiter in the hopes that tankers from Titan would rendezvous with them. *If they survived.* Task Group 40, standby for engagement orders. Johannes tapped a control which transmitted the combat formation theyd be using along with a set of pre-programmed maneuvers and firing commands. Things would happen too quickly at the merge, and the resulting clash would be over in a fraction of a second. Humans simply couldnt react swiftly enough; it had to be left to the computers. After the merge, hed assess the resulting geometry, damage dealt to the enemy, and the damage status of his own force. Hed then calculate a re-engage vector to bring them back around for another pass. Both ships acknowledged receipt. He continued, Right now our combined closure rate is 0.44c, way too fast to get any hits. Four minutes prior to the merge, well execute a swing ship maneuver, and brake down to 0.1c. If the Formix keep going, well get more hits on them but will have a devil of a time catching them in a tail chase. If the bugs decelerate as well, then well have a good fight on our hands. Athanasius was back on the bridge, listening to Paulus as he finished his transmission. Sounds like a solid battle plan, Captain, except for one thing. Oh really? Paulus could not conceal his annoyance. Whats that? Im not sure that the bugs even *have* hands. The tension on the bridge broke as several of the watch guffawed out loud. Paulus made a pantomime of hurling his data tablet at his executive officer, his scowl momentarily lifting as he did so. #THE PRAESIDIUM, ROME. #0604 HOURS. The huge imaging array which orbited Earth at a distance of 300,000 miles fed a constant stream of imagery back to the command center as the photons arrived. Despite being the best optics mankind had at its disposal, the participants in a battle which had commenced hours earlier were images large enough to identify as ships and ascertain their general class, but lacked much more detail than that. Digital encrypted datalinks from each ship in Task Group 40, arriving concurrent with the optical information, filled in the rest of the story. As the two groups of specks plunged towards each other in the optical feed, the datalinks provided detailed information on the enemy fleet as well as the status of each ship. At the merge, the optical feed had suddenly become cluttered with numerous bright flashes of light. A heartbeat later, the two groups of specks were opening again. Instead of 9 Formic ships, there were now 7. An expanding cloud of debris marked all that remained of Task Group 40. The datalinks had failed before the onboard computers could compute and transmit any significant enemy battle damage assessment. The Tribune of the Watch stared at the displays. *Deus misereatur eorum*, he muttered, crossing himself. Regaining his composure he began the task of analyzing the engagement in an attempt to learn as much from the battle as could be determined. The others in the room turned from the display and regarded the togate man standing among them. Consul Tiberius Valerius Lupus had seen enough. Nodding to those around him, he exited the command center. Outside, a car waited to take him to the Senate house. Sirens blaring and lights flashing, the Praetorian motorcycle guard cleared the traffic ahead of him as his sedan sped toward the Capitoline Hill."
