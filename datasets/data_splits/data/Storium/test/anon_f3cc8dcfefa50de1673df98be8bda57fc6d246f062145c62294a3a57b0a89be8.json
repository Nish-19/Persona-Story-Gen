Throughout the Pacific, Japanese strongholds that had been bypassed in Nimitz's \"island hopping\" campaign had remained untouched.  No longer capable of being supplied by land or sea, the Allies had simply allowed them to wither.  In the weeks after VJ Day, small naval task forces combed the Pacific, landing on bypassed islands and urging the Japanese holdouts to come out of their caves and be repatriated with their homeland.\n\nThere was some resistance.  Some Japanese, their hearts still alive with the *bushido* spirit, would refuse to surrender, and would remain in the jungles for decades to come.\n\nThere was one island in the Marshalls, however, where the Marines were greeted by their former enemies with a mixture of terror and joy.  There were only four of them, and they kept insisting--*begging*--that they be removed from the island before nightfall.\n\nNearly seventy five years later, the details of what happened on Agrihan Island are still classified...",

            "story_name": "##Once again, Rome is beset by war.  But this time, the fighting will take place among the stars. \n \nSetting: The story is an alternate history/science fiction drama which takes place in the 22nd Century AD. It is the sequel to \n[We Who Are About to Die (A Romans in Space Adventure](https://storium.com/game/we-who-are-about-to-die/chapter-4/scene-6)\n\nRome never fell.\n \nBy the end of the Twentieth Century AD, although not *complete* master of the world, her dominions were vast, and her military, economic and technological superiority went unquestioned. Rome\u2019s earthly hegemony secure,  the Empire began turning their vision skyward\u2026\n \nIt is now AD 2131.  Some decades earlier, Roman scientists unlocked the secrets of interstellar travel. With the invention of *Quam Celerius Lucem* (QCL) Drives, Roman vessels have established Colonia Proxima Centauri, a habitable world populated by primitive barbarians who were easily overcome.   Rome\u2019s first encounter with an advanced civilization (the Pomeranii) did not go well.  After a brief and violent war, Rome concluded an armistice with the canine-like aliens.   Rome and the Pomeranii soon became allies, joining forces against a far more serious threat:  the Formix. \n\nFollowing their victory in what the Senate formalized as the Formic War, Rome settled into a brief period of peace.  To celebrate both his ascent to the Imperial Purple, the victory in the civil war which preceded it, and the victory over the Formix, the Emperor Marcus Orestes Claudius staged a months long series of gladiatorial games like none seen in Rome's long history.  But even as the games reached their climax, the Roman frontier was breached by a force of Formic ships which appeared at a previously unknown jump point just beyond Pluto's orbit.\n\nThe Second Formic War was about to begin.  \n \n\n\n**IMPORTANT:** This is a fairly complex game.
