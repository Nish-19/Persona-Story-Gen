        "story": "*It was a cold winter's night in London, and the city was alive with the sound of hopes and dreams. Amidst the hustle and bustle of the streets, there were many who were wishing for a better life. Some yearned for wealth and prosperity, while others craved love and companionship. But alas, not all wishes come true.* *In a dimly lit corner of the city, there sat a man named Edward. He was a simple man, with simple desires. All he wanted was a warm meal and a place to lay his head at night. But despite his best efforts, he had never been able to make ends meet. As he trudged through the streets, his stomach growling with hunger, he couldn't help but feel like the world was against him.* *And then there was Mary. She had always dreamed of finding her soulmate, a man who would cherish her and love her for who she was. But despite her many attempts at love, she had been met with disappointment and heartbreak at every turn. She was beginning to lose hope that she would ever find true love.* *As the night wore on, Edward and Mary found themselves walking along the same path. They didn't know each other, but there was a sense of camaraderie between them. They were both people who had been let down by life, and they found solace in each other's company.* *And then something strange happened. As they walked, they stumbled upon a mysterious figure who offered them each a wish. Edward wished for a warm meal and a place to stay, while Mary wished for a true love that would never leave her side.* *But as the night wore on, they both realized that their wishes had been in vain. Edward's warm meal turned out to be cold, and his place to stay was infested with rats. And Mary's true love turned out to be nothing more than a passing fancy.* *As they sat together, cold and hungry and alone, they realized that sometimes the things we wish for are not the things we truly need.* *It was a story that repeated many times, throughout human history.* *But, sometimes, fools had trusted in magical beings to fulfil their wishes. Seldom did this end well.* *Most, if they lived to regret their decision at all, saw themselves as fighting a power that would always be greater than them.* But one man refused to accept this fate... ---- #Burned by the things you wish for? ---- So read the eye-catching headline of a blog that circulated throughout the vast expanse of the internet. The alluring title captured the attention of many, and soon, small ads began appearing in newspapers across the world, drawing readers to its pages. Some were drawn in by the mere mention of it, while others took a chance and delved deeper into its contents, seeking the secrets it held. The topics covered by the blog were both ordinary and fantastical, enough to pique the interest of those who stumbled upon it. But for a select few, the words carried a weight that only they could comprehend. They felt as if they had finally found someone who understood their plight, and the prospect of gaining justice against the elusive creatures that held their fate in their hands. Under the name Candent, a figure reached out to these individuals, offering them the chance to band together and achieve retribution for their unfulfilled desires. They exchanged electronic and postal messages, building a camaraderie and trust among themselves until just a mere few received an invitation to gather at an address in Old Hill, Chislehurst, London, England. Of the few, only a couple dared to arrive at the appointed hour. \"Candent\" was not disappointed by the no-shows, but more delighted that he had found a pair who truly had the courage to follow through. But little did they know, the path they had chosen would be fraught with danger, and the consequences of their actions could prove to be disastrous."

        "story": "The new intake of students assembled in the Great Hall. From a distance, because of the way the Basilisk University perched near the top of a hill, it appeared to be on its own in the middle of nowhere. But it was not so. A short walk down the hill took you to the bustling town of Cindring, nestling in the valley. It was not a big town, but it was vibrant. And it was not unknown to the King. --- Basilisk University of Cindring was revered by many. To enter through its gates was to be assured a career amongst the magical classes. It prided itself on failing none. Of course, in its history some had been expelled, but that really was a situation of last resort. One either *Graduated*, or *Finished*. To *Finish* from Basilisk University was to be declared ready to serve on the staff of one of the great wizards or military. Even one who could not themselves learn to master magic could still make themselves useful in some profession and capacity. However, to ***Graduate*** from Basilisk University, to be declared a *Doyen of Dragons*, or a *Baccalaureate of Basilisk* -that was honour indeed. A **Doyen** would leave with their own dragon, and would be able to serve their King as an autonomous master of magic use, and dragon husbandry. A **Baccalaureate of Basilisk** would be qualified to join the Guild of Magicians, and serve in a dragon squadron - although they would not leave with a dragon of their own. The students came from all walks of life all had passed the exacting entrance interview. All were believed to have the right potential. --- Each of the students had to encounter Mallaidh Macbridei. She was a formidable woman. Many grew to respect her, but all feared her. She ensured good order was kept around the University. She would give each student their key, and show them on a plan where they would find their room. Exactly what her job title was, no-one quite knew. She was an institution in and of herself. She patrolled the corridors, and one did as she said. But one might also turn to her in a time of trouble. She greeted each with warmth, but had a firm warning for those who would venture into the town below the University. And there was the rub - she had cultivated a way of speaking which was hard to follow; \"The townsfolk are able and honest, but do not appreciate chaotic behaviour. This is our amplitude, and that is ancient. Bethink this at all times. You are apery Basilisk University aback you go there, and allegation do abolishment to accompany abashing on us. Absolutely, you allegation enhance accordance amidst borough and University. Who knows aback you may allegation to be able admired in the borough? So behave consistently in a way that will accompany you acclaim. Should you misjudge what that agency - ask for admonition afore arch on action, or be accessible for afterwards-accoutrement.\" Her expression showed that she hoped she had made herself perfectly clear."

As night falls and temperatures plummet, you must decide how to navigate the icy dangers, Imperial threats, and the unpredictable wilds to bring him back before it's too late.",
        "story": "--- --- ### It is a dark time for the Rebellion. Although the Death Star has been destroyed, Imperial troops have driven the Rebel forces from their hidden base and pursued them across the galaxy. ## Many of the bold heroes involved in the Battle of Yavin now have bounty on their heads. Evading the dreaded Imperial Starfleet, a gathering of freedom fighters led by General Rieekan has established a new secret base on the remote ice world of Hoth. # The evil lord Darth Vader, obsessed with finding young Skywalker, has dispatched thousands of remote probes into the far reaches of space... --- --- Across the icy expanse of the windswept ice slope of the Plain of Hoth, a small figure could be seen galloping on a large grey snow lizard, a Tauntaun. The creature's two-legged gait kicked up curving plumes of snow as it sped forward. As the rider approached a slope, he pulled back on the reins, bringing the Tauntaun to a halt. Luke Skywalker, bundled up against the cold, removed his protective goggles and noticed something in the sky. He retrieved a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt, examining the smoke rising from the crash site of what was in reality an Imperial probe robot. With the wind whipping at his fur-lined cap, Luke activated a comlink transmitter. His Tauntaun shifted restlessly beneath him as he addressed the device. \"Echo Three to Echo Seven,\" Luke's voice crackled over the comlink. \"Han, old buddy, do you read me?\" Amidst a moment of static, a familiar voice responded. \"Loud and clear, kid. What's up?\" Han Solo's voice came through the comlink. \"Well, I finished my circle,\" Luke continued. \"I don't pick up any life readings.\" \"There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser,\" Han's voice retorted. \"The sensors are placed, I'm going back.\" \"Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long,\" Luke concluded. Luke clicked off his transmitter, his focus returning to his Tauntaun. He patted the creature's head, soothing its nerves as he muttered, \"Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something?\" With a small device in hand, Luke began adjusting it, intent on his task. Suddenly, a large shadow fell over him from behind. He heard a monstrous howl and turned just in time to catch sight of an eleven-foot-tall Wampa Ice Creature lunging ferociously at him. --- Later, near Han Solo's space freighter, two robots came to a stop. Han and Chewbacca were struggling with the central lifters of their ship. Chewie grumbled irritably as Han admonished him for dismantling the equipment at that moment. \"Excuse me, sir,\" C-3PO interjected. Han turned to Chewie, saying, \"Put them back together right now.\" C-3PO continued, \"Might I have a word with you, please?\" Han's irritation was evident as he asked, \"What do you want?\" C-3PO responded, \"Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator.\" \"I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her,\" Han replied dismissively. \"Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is,\" C-3PO informed. \"*I* don't know where he is,\" Han stated. \"*Nobody* knows where he is,\" C-3PO emphasised. \"What do you mean, '*nobody* knows'?\" Han asked incredulously. As the fading light outside the ice cave signalled the approach of night, Han glanced in its direction. The temperature continued to drop on the icy planet. \"Well, uh, you see...\" C-3PO began, hesitatingly. Realising that he needed more information, Han abruptly covered C-3PO's mouth with his hand as a deck officer approached. \"Yes, sir?\" the deck officer inquired. \"Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?\" Han asked urgently. The deck officer replied, \"I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance.\" \"It's *possible*? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there,\" Han ordered. \"Yes, sir,\" the deck officer replied, hastening away. Han removed his hand from C-3PO's mouth, and the droid took the opportunity to ask, \"Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?\" Han's response was straightforward: \"Why not?\" He moved away dismissively. C-3PO proceeded, \"Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, let's find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.\" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Inside the Rebel base's main ice tunnel, the deck officer and his assistant rushed toward Han as he entered. \"Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in,\" the deck officer reported. \"Not likely. Are the speeders ready?\" Han questioned. \"Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold,\" the deck officer explained. \"Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns,\" Han asserted. \"The temperature's dropping too rapidly,\" the deck officer warned. \"That's right. And my friends are out in it,\" Han replied firmly. Han mounted a Tauntaun. The deck officer and his assistant exchanged concerns about the extreme cold, but Han's determination was clear. \"The temperature's dropping too rapidly. Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker,\" the deck officer warned Han. Han's retort was defiant: \"Then I'll see you in hell!\" With that, Han spurred his Tauntaun forward, venturing into the dark and bitter night of Hoth &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our heroes soon got news of the problem. They were part of a rebel group that has been instrumental in destroying Imperial ships at Kuat - ships that would surely have meant the end of the resistance, had they been allowed to take part in the Battle of Yavin. They were no strangers to taking the initiative. As soon as they heard Commander Skywalker was missing, they knew they had to act, despite the conservative concerns of middle command"

What drives you to defy the city's rigid hierarchy, and how far are you willing to go to survive\u2014or change the system?",
        "story": "--- --- ##**Neo Elysia's Urban Divide: A Social Hierarchy in the City** --- --- Neo Elysia is a city divided not only by its gleaming skyscrapers but also by a stark social hierarchy that shapes the lives of its inhabitants. This divide is symbolised by distinct zones within the city, each with its own rules and challenges. **1. The Upper Echelons - The Privileged Elite** - *Location:* High above the city, the wealthy elite reside in luxurious penthouses and high-tech residences, basking in the comfort of their cyber-enhanced lifestyles. - *Lifestyle:* The Upper Echelons enjoy unparalleled access to advanced technology, impeccable security, and extravagant entertainment. Weapons are considered a status symbol and are prominently displayed as decor. - *Use of Weapons:* Weapons are primarily ornamental, reserved for displays of power and prestige. Discharging a weapon here is a grave offence, usually leading to severe consequences. **2. The Middle Ground - The Struggling Enhanced (Mods)** - *Location:* Between the opulence of the elite and the desperation of the slums lies the Middle Ground, where Mods with aspirations dwell. - *Lifestyle:* These Mods work tirelessly to pay for their enhancements, hoping to ascend to the Upper Echelons. Their lives are characterised by constant competition and ambition. - *Use of Weapons:* While weapons can be carried, they are expected to be used only in self-defence. Mods are caught in a perpetual struggle for status and advancement. **3. The Conurbation - A Blend of Rich and Poor** - *Location:* This area sits at the heart of the city, representing a transitional zone between wealth and poverty. - *Lifestyle:* Here, a mix of the rich and poor coexist. While some enjoy relative comfort, others struggle to make ends meet. The Conurbation hosts bustling markets, entertainment venues, and a diverse population. - *Use of Weapons:* Carrying weapons is common, but discharging them should be limited to acts of self-defence. The Conurbation serves as a melting pot of culture and commerce. **4. The Outer Fringes - Facing Poverty and Lawlessness** - *Location:* Moving away from the city centre, the Outer Fringes witness a rise in poverty and a decline in order. - *Lifestyle:* Residents here face economic hardships, limited access to technology, and basic amenities. Survival is a daily struggle. - *Use of Weapons:* In the Outer Fringes, weapons are readily used for both protection and aggression. Law enforcement is scarce, and vigilante justice is common. **5. The Wastelands - A Desolate, Lawless Abyss** - *Location:* Beyond the city's boundaries lies the desolate Wastelands, a harsh and lawless territory. - *Lifestyle:* The Wastelands are characterised by extreme pollution, an absence of law, and a return to a primitive existence. Those who venture here do so at their own peril. - *Use of Weapons:* In the Wastelands, weapons are a way of life, essential for survival in a hostile environment. Conflict and chaos reign supreme. The Urban Divide of Neo Elysia paints a vivid portrait of societal inequality, where the haves and have-nots are separated by both physical and metaphorical barriers. As your characters navigate these zones, they will encounter diverse challenges, choices, and opportunities, each contributing to the rich tapestry of the cyberpunk narrative."

        "writing_prompt": "A once-vanished town, Frostvale, has returned from another dimension, its towering walls now bustling with shops and life. But whispers of strange cracks, dark marks, and the black fire that took it linger\u2014what secrets did Frostvale bring back with it?",
        "story": "#Frostvale ##Introduction --- *Usually, the pictures I use are very intentional and meant to be taken literally. A little detail just might mean to be there!* *That's not quite the case with this opening picture. I do not intend to tie us down to an actual map of Frostvale. The relative position between places might be important here and there, but on the whole not.* *The picture above is meant to give an impression, not to be an accurate representation of anything. (By the way, click on it, and you will see it in full).* *It's actually 2 images. In the background is an impression of what Frostvale town looks like. Indeed, in as much as you can make anything out from the banner pic, I always imagine you can see bits of Frostvale, poking out of the trees.* *In the foreground is a rough map of main walkways. You see small boats come in on one side - they will be on the other side, too, and it looks like there are some round at the south. There is a long walkway in the middle, with lots going off, actually, **up**.* *As I say, it is not a map, and can only begin to give you a picture of what it is like to be in Frostvale. Take that, and overlay it with a written description....* --- --- Long ago, Frostvale was a castle. Defending who from what is not clear, but they built it well. Four tall towers gave a good view and made an impression on they eye. Those towers, and most of the walls, were still there. So it is, that Frostvale could be seen more as one huge building than a town, though a town it surely is. The great walls and what would have been battlements now held shops on many levels, as did the towers. The centre was open, allowing daylight to come into the central part, but every available space had been utilised in some way. For as long as can be remembered, its location was important because it offered a resting point on a long waterway (part river, part canal) that linked two very important river networks which were vital to transport and trade. A series of locks allowed boats to move freely in either direction. The waterway was wide and deep. You would have been hard pressed to get a full ship along it (though it had been known, apparently!) but certainly some pretty big boats. Most however were barge-type vessels loaded with goods; and a few fishers. Routes south were not great, but used by some for continuing or joining journeys. North, there were the mountains. Huge, and virtually uncrossable. Nothing much of value was known to be there, though who knows. There are some dangers in the form of creatures, deep in the mountains, but it was the terrain and climate that posed the greatest risk. Besides, there was nothing worth crossing them for. Probably another Kingdom, if you went far enough - though it would be easier by far to go by land and sea another way. A nation of Kobolds was most likely that way - but much too far to be worth thinking about. Roundabout, there were a few little hamlets and settlements eking out a living. Some might supply eggs and other crops to the town. Just near the town, to either side, are the remains of trading centres that sprang up during the period of Frostvale's ... absence. They were redundant now, though some continued to live there, and carry on some sort of trade. But, those things apart, there was very little sign of other life for a long way in any direction. There were mountains, forests, planes, and the waterway, with the dramatic Falls. (There was also a strange building jutting out of the cliff, which was once a church, and was now a prison). I talked about the *absence* of Frostvale. Some few years back, the place disappeared. Totally - leaving just a strange, mighty, black crater where it once stood. It had been taken, wholesale, into another dimension. And through no small effort by a heroic few, in due course, returned. You might think there would be some physical evidence of its movement. Actually, there was very little. Frostvale did not go anywhere, physically. It did not bump or scrape. While it was gone, some moss, stone, mud and water egressed into the space it once held in this dimension, and when it returned, that was pushed out, with some residual marking. When it was first taken, a strange black fire appeared to consume it, though this was not so much burning it up as taking it away. If you knew where to look, you might see little cracks or marks or darkening here or there, but then again, it could just be your imagination... So let us talk about Frostvale... ---"
