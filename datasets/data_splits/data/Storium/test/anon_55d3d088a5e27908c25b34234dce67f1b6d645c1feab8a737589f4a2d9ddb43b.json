An unlikely bunch of stalwart heroes responded to the call of Derlin, the then Prince on the Dragon Throne, to uncover the truth behind the destruction and stop the culprits.  Their quest took them into a magical realm and into adventures they could never have imagined.  They returned victorious - restoring Frostvale to its rightful place, and returning with the Wizards to be held account for their deeds.\n\nPeace now seemed assured, with the magical realm destroyed and the Wizards no longer plotting revenge.  Frostvale was a thriving market town once again.  \n\nHowever, not all is calm.  Besides the cut-and thrust of petty rivalries, monsters and magical anomalies began to emerge, and in recent months became more frequent.   Could it be that the magic which once threatened the peace is not entirely consigned to the past?\n\n-------------------------------\n\nThis is a classic fantasy setting (dwarves, elves, wizards and paladins included) -  it is an open world sandbox.\n\nYou are encouraged to write your own cards and to add moves without cards.\n",
