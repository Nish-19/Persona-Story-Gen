        "writing_prompt": "On the chaotic Smugglers' Moon of Nar Shadaa, a desperate thief, a hunted bounty hunter, a Force-sensitive wanderer, and a cunning smuggler find their fates intertwined as they navigate Hutt schemes, Imperial shadows, and the rising power of the criminal underworld. What brings them together, and what secrets will they uncover in the depths of the Outer Rim?",
        "story": "STAR WARS GUARDIANS OF PEACE It has been six months since the battle of Lothal. Although the secret weapon of the Empire, THE DEATH STAR, is still months from completion, the Empire is increasing its grip on neighbouring planets to punish the Rebel Alliance for their insurgency. In the Outer Rim, figures such as the Black Sun and the Hutts begin to vie for control of the territories, left to their own devices by the Empire. On the Smugglers Moon of Nar Shadaa, the Hutt Crime Boss, NAKRA THE HUTT, begins his own plans to ascend to greater power... ************************************* NAKRA, MIRAX Nakra knew that people did not like to watch Hutts eat. That is why he usually did when he was doing business. Such as this. Mirax Hoban, a human female and smuggler, stood before his throne as he lifted a steaming fried Nuna leg and tore the meat from it, sucking the bones clean before tossing it aside. Shoving his hand into a nearby bowl of crunchbugs, lifting the chirping creatures into his mouth, ignoring the few which leapt from his large green hand to the floor and onto his thick Krayt-skin vest. \"If Black Sun took your ship, then it is impossible for me to intercede.\" Nakra said after swallowing, patting his belly. \"After all, you were the one who incinerated their cargo, did you not?\" They had at least dropped her off on the Smugglers Moon rather than spacing her. In fact, he was quite pleased with the turn of events. Black Sun and their endless \"vigo's\", lead by that abominable Falleen, Prince Xizor....prince of what? Of secrets and lies? He was glad that their shipment was gone. But now he had to deal with Hoban's arrival as best as he could. \"So, you're asking me for...what, exactly?\" He said. He knew a woman only came to visit a Hutt if she was desperate. With his control over his large portion of the city, she must have had something she had to ask for...and to offer. ************************************* DRAY Drays heart was pounding, but she allowed the strange calm that she could sometimes reach to wash over her body, her mind feeling calmer as she slowly found hand and footholds. It was dark outside, but it was always dark in this place. The only lights on the Smugglers Moon came from the endless neon signs and hologram displays, promising entertainment and enjoyment. For herself, she'd settle for enough money to make it through the week. The palace was large and massive and she clambered up the wall, her blue skinned hands finding imperfections in the rock, as if her hands were lead by magnetic tethers. She had considered, many times, how to handle this. Justifying it to herself. Hutts were loathsome slimy opportunistic bottom feeders. Better to steal from one of them than ten commoners. No one was truly innocent on Nar Shadaa anyway. As she clambered upwards and over the ledge of the large balcony, she felt the slight fatigue pass over her and she took a minute to relax and catch her breath. Something, somewhere in Nakra the Hutts palace, would have to be worth money. And the Hutt would probably never miss it. Pushing through the doors of the upper balcony and finding them unlocked(as no Hutt, nor guard, would expect anyone to make it onto a small platform way up here), she moved through the halls. Up ahead, she smelled before she saw the pair of Gamorrean guards. The green and porcine warriors waddled past, snorting to each other, each carrying a large vibro-axe. Though she thought she could stay ahead of them, she was hoping she could avoid getting the business end of those as she waited until they had moved on. Only when she was sure they were gone did she continue. A large pair of double doors blocked her way now. These ones, however, were locked. ************************************* RAINE The Sullustan had been running for days. Trul Zand had broken his bail conditions, which meant that the local official from Eriadu had wanted him back. Dead or alive, it didn't matter to them. The small, two man freighter that Zand had stolen was also lacking in copilot, weaponry or shields. It made it more than easy to line up the shot with the engines and fire. The back section of the engines blew, fire blossoming as they began to pull into the atmosphere over the planet. However, Zand seemed to be keeping the ship in a good position. He had slowed, but he was not crashing and he directed the ship away from the city and towards the swamps. Laser fire blossomed on either side of Raine's ship, but they were warning shots. Two Krayt gunships, the small starfighter enforcers of the Hutts, were currently at port and starboard. \"Vessel, you are currently firing over unauthorized airspace. Identify yourself!\" the voice on the comms was raspy and he heard the click of the teeth. Klatooinian, most likely, one of the servants of the Hutts. ************************************* KEB-KEB Keb-Keb had heard stories over the years about the Power of the Dark Side, the feel of it, the cold and hate. He had heard of the planet Korriban(sometimes mislabelled as \"Moraband\"by the uneducated), where the Sith Species had come from and had wondered if the world had felt anything like Nar Shadaa did. Every day he walked the streets, he felt the hopelessness, the pain, the sadness... At the very least, there was no Imperial presence here. No officers, no stormtroopers. No Inquisitors. Oh, there were a few ships in orbit, but as long as the Hutts did not engage them, the Empire had no jurisdiction here. A few decades back, the Empire had even had some kind of TIE fighter production factory in space, before an unexplained accident had brought the factory down and it was never replaced. As he turned into the alley to go home, he sensed them. There was an assortment about him, but the Dark Side had clouded their presence...until it was too late to avoid them. A Trandoshan leader, an insectivore Kubaz, a Balosar and a Weequay. They were armed, some with blasters, other with vibroknives. \"Credits and anything you have on you. Now.\" Hissed the Trandoshan. Keb-Keb knew how Nar Shadaa worked. There were no law enforcement, only enforcers getting involved if anything disturbed the Hutts. Even if a blaster went off, nobody would come. He had chosen this world for a reason."

        "writing_prompt": "Five children from vastly different backgrounds receive their Hogwarts letters under unusual circumstances, each uncovering secrets about their pasts and abilities. What happens when their paths converge at the start of term, and they realize their destinies are more intertwined than they could have imagined?",
        "story": "It was halfway through June on one of the hottest summers on record. Had the five names been expecting the letters, would they have been any more prepared? *We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July.* Yours sincerely, *Quinlan Breewood, Deputy Headmaster.* The second page had recorded the list. **HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY** UNIFORM First-year students will require: 1. Three sets of plain work robes (black)* 2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear 3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar) 4. One winter cloak (black, with silver fastenings) Please note that all pupil's clothes should carry name tags.

The air in her room felt thick and heavy, as her bedroom faced the sun as it crossed the sky. She had been considering moving to another room to see if opening a window there would make her even a percentage cooler when an owl flew in through the window, dropping a letter on her bed before flapping off. Skye was not unknowledgeable of her true nature, which has been kept a secret from their neighbours before and after they moved. She had spent a whole year at Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry before her mother took her from her home, her school and her friends to settle down with some man she barely knew in Epsom. However, she had not expected this. She thought her life at wizarding schools were done. However, it wasn't over yet. She made her way into the downstairs. Her mother and her fiancee(Skye still refused to call him \"dad\"or \"stepdad\")were having tea. Despite the heat, Octavius insisted on it. \"I...I just got this.\" Skye said, feeling nervous and excited all at once as she laid it on the table. Skye's mother gave a squeak and her fiancee, Octavius Prewett, rose, a broad smile on his handsome face. \"Amazing. Astounding! Amazing! Open it!\" She read it out. Some things on the list, she still had. Her wand, for one.However, given that she was underage, she had been forbidden to use it after she was removed from Ilvermorny. Her cauldron was gone, having been burned up in one of her attempts to experiment with potions(given it wasn't really magic, there was no reason that she couldn't try, right?)and her robes were made for Ilvermorny, not Hogwarts. She heard the money here was different too. \"I'm so proud of you Skye!\" Her mother said, hugging her tight. Octavius gently, but awkwardly, patted her shoulder just below where her mother's arms locked her in a fierce embrace. \"Right. We'll need to get the supplies in London. Diagon Alley. The Floo Network would be the fastesf way. I'm sure that we can find them all. We could both take you there later this week!\" He said, grinning again, putting his arm around Skye's mother(who had finally released her)who gave a watery smile to her daughter. ************************************* KAYLEIGH When they had settled in Brighton, Kayleigh's parents had done so to be...removed from things. However, as it was summer and Brighton was a resort town, this made the summers especially difficult in terms of traffic as they tried to wend their way back. The cars were fender to fender and did not seem to be moving any time soon. Stella Diggory was slender, with dark hair to her shoulders. Aiden Diggory was plump around the middle and had no hair. All in all, they balanced each other well. Usually good natured, Kayleigh's father was swelling up as he sat in the front seat. Muggle traffic got him closer to exploding. Usually, he was the disciplinarian of the family, not that Kayleigh truly needed it. However, these Muggles...he had once nearly drawn his wand on someone who had gestured rudely to him through the window. This would be bad enough, but her father had never truly gotten the hang of Muggle clothing, having donned a violet purple waistcoat, bright yellow trousers, a deerstalker hat and violent orange suspenders. Her mother had long learned how to dress properly and she seemed a proper Muggle, working even to the last minute. More than once, Kayleigh had found her slumped over the Muggle paperwork and snoring with it plastered to her cheek by drool. She was fumbling through her papers in the front seat, shuffling through them carefully, searching for a single line that she had misplaced. The two, so caught up in their own annoyances, were too busy to notice Kayleigh's visitor as it knocked on the window with its beak, hovering as best as its tiny wings would allow. \"If some Muggle cyclist knocking on the window...\" Aiden growled. Kayleigh rolled down the window and caught the tiny owl, who was holding a letter twice as large as it in her hands. The owl gratefully perched still atop her hand as she took the letter off its leg, then flopped onto its back with a hoot, exhausted. The letter...it was the one she had been expecting for years. *Hogwarts.* ************************************* ASHER Asher and his foster parents had only just got off the plane. Adam and Margaret had done the best they could to keep up with the news after the letter had come, clutched in the beak of a very wet and bedraggled looking owl, which had rested a full week in their one story home before flying off again. The owl had carried a waterproof pouch with it bearing a letter enscribed with four animals around an H, as well as a small letter enclosed. However, enclosed in the letter had been a smaller letter written in angular letters very different than the enclosed list of books and acceptance letters, the envelope having been folded extremely small. This, Asher had read with some excitement. *I was a friend of your parents. They went to school at Hogwarts and I believe that for all involved, your return to this historic school and understanding of your family and your own abilities would be best for all involved. While other magical schools like Ilvermorny exist in the States, I believe that your path would be best served here.* *RIV* An enclosed letter for his foster parents gave instructions on where to take him. They were going to a hidden alley of sorts to get what they needed. \"Are we sure about this?\" Margaret asked, mousey and nervous. It had taken all she had not to blab to everyone in the neighbourhood when Asher's letter had come. \"Fine time to be asking now....\" Adam said gloomily as he gathered the suitcases from the baggage area. \"We already got the plane tickets and everything.\" \"We're sure this isn't a prank or anything?\" She asked, looking at Asher. \"I mean, really...\" \"We're here now. We'll get a hotel and then go and get the things we need. Though maybe we won't discuss them out here now.\" Adam said, clearing his throat. Outside the terminal, he set down his suitcase and waited for the next taxi. Turning to Asher, he clapped a hand on his shoulder. \"Alright, son?\" ************************************* *AARON* It had been a long drive, but his uncle and he had finally made it into London. The discussion had been over getting supplies for a new boarding school. Aaron and his uncle had pondered and argued over which school would be best. Smeltings had been one, but Aaron could not consider himself being dressed in those outfits, even to show to his parents, even if it was for pretend. His uncle had even jokingly considered \"St.Brutus's Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys\", but Aaron had finally convinced him to give up on it, as his parents would never believe it, given his record as a student. He had been confused and questioning the letter since it had come, an envelope bearing four animals and had opened it to read that he was a wizard. True, there had been strange occurences around him...but he had never believed HE had caused them. So, as they parked outside the pub \"the Leaky Cauldron\", he wondered if this was all just a joke or a hoax, had hidden the letter when it had arrived, but his uncles involvement had convinced him to give it a go. \"Right. Inside then Aaron.\" Uncle Ted said, giving a gesture with his hand. His uncle had lived with them since Aaron had been about five years old. His father sometimes sniped at him for being lazy, but Ted was far more understanding in some ways than his father could be. Inside the pub, a young woman stood behind the bar and a few strangely dressed people were sitting about."

        "writing_prompt": "When an ancient vault is shattered, unleashing a force long contained, the world's guardian must assemble a team of unlikely heroes\u2014each with their own pasts, powers, and secrets\u2014to face a threat older than time itself.",
        "story": "They had fought well, but they had fallen and died about the ancient plateau, symbolizing the fall yet to come. It had almost been sad, to see how far the Monastery had descended in their weakness. Stepping over broken bodies and torn limbs, the woman in the hood stood and faced the edifice, an enormous stone and metal vault that stood over a hundred feet high. Even here, she could feel them, reaching from beyond. Their strength could never be fully contained, only weakened to a trickle. But soon, she would change that...oh yes. Raising a hand, she conjured a violet gauntlet, energy forming runes along it, slowly humming the words of power. \"Xiu. Stop right there.\" The voice said, slow, deliberate, gentle and stern all at once. She turned, seeing him floating there, his eyes giving a soft glow. His crimson cloak fluttered, though there was no wind here, in this wasteland. That was why they chose it so long ago. Xiu Fang slipped her hood back, revealing the porcelain mask covering her face, a replica of her own, though the eyes behind were impossible to see in the black. \"It's Sincaster now.\" \"A little on the nose, don't you think?\" Nolan Crassus said as he drifted to the ground, landing lightly on his feet. \"You have your own alias, isn't that right Lovecraft?\" She asked. \"Touche.\" Looking about at the dead warriors, he sighed. \"I would say that there was still time for you to stop this, but I'd say you've used up your quota on lenience.\" He lashed out, a lash made of energy wrapping around the forearm. \"You know I can't allow you to free them.\" \"Can't \"allow\"? You're asking as if I care what you think. You may be the Guardian of this world, but I'm not your subject.\" She said, slashing out with a blade conjured from air. The lash fell away like the broken strings of a violin and she brought her fist into the centre of the vault. Lovecraft send a burst of energy that sent her sliding back, then interposed himself between her and the vault, raised his hands and making a complicated motion, a mystical shield circling him. She cut through it with a burst of earth circling outwards. He answered by summoning bolts of energy. While the battle occurred, cracks had begun to form, spreading outwards from the space where Sincaster had struck. The magic was doing its work from a single blow. Lovecraft sent her flying backward and turned, raising a hand as he tried to halt the destruction, but then she struck him from behind with a blow of a mystical mace conjured to her hand. The vault cracked, red and green energy spreading from the cracks in bursts of light. He only had a moment to throw up a barrier before the stone burst outward, burying him beneath the rock and metal of a door billions of years old. ************************************* It took time to recover fully. The barrier, a bubble around him, provided both oxygen and protection from the crushing layer of mangled metal and crushed granite. It relied on his concentration though, so he meditated, though his mind was reeling. He had to focus to get out and, bit by bit, he unearthed himself, pushing away the fallen rubble and rising out in the bubble. Alighting on the ground, he dropped the sphere. It was as he feared. She was gone. And the doorway was open, meaning they had escaped. He could rely on the Monastery, but none were as well trained as him. Fang had been one of the greatest students at the temple and she had chewed through the masters set to guard this place like it was nothing. He didn't need monks right now. What he needed now was heroes. SENTRIES ************************************* **EMERY** The \"New Horizons\"Centre was anything but new, but the homeless shelter had received an upgrade thanks to money provided by an anonymous benefactor. As such, there was a deal of renovation being dealt with one wing at a time, expanding and upgrading where they could. Felicity ducked under a scaffolding clear of workers as Emery followed her. They had been looking at the changes and they were enjoying what they saw. Painters had been at work and the hallway smelled of new paint. \"Come on, we have to check this out!\" Felicity said, excited to explore as she took their hand. ************************************* **HENDRICKSON** The gym had a fair number of kids today. It was only the most dedicated or sure that would return for later classes. People made a lot of martial arts, karate and the like, but boxing had something that made it special. Punchdown had been the ultimate shadow boxer. But that had been before his retirement. Well, one of them anyway. He had done a great deal since then. The children, some hyperactive, some attentive, waited for his first words to them."
