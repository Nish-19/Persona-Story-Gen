Scott Fitzgerald, *The Great Gatsby*\n\nAfter the parties stopped sometime in 1922, nobody paid much attention to the gaudy mansion sitting at the edge of Long Island Sound, on the utmost tip of West Egg. It was a mad time, back then, a crazy swinging time that moved so fast it was easy to get distracted. Besides, no one knew much about the man whose house it was. So the car loads of politicians, movie stars, and college students that used to parade up and down those marble steps found other parties to fill with their sparkling laughter and their appetites for cocktails and jazz.\n\nMeanwhile, nobody came to claim the rambling mansion or knock it down, and every year it got a little shabbier.\n\nThen 1929 hit, and the party was really and truly over-- not only in the house at the tip of West Egg, but everywhere.\n\nNow it is the final year of Prohibition in the benighted year of our Lord 1933. The papers say that unemployment is the worst it's ever been, that one in four Americans is out of work, but you don't need a newspaper to tell you that the Depression is getting worse every year. Roosevelt might be president now, but this is New York in the image of Hoover: breadlines that stretch for blocks, street vendors with holey shoes selling the same types of apples on every corner, aluminum and cardboard shacks filling the dirt plains of Central Park.\n\nSomewhere in Hoover's New York, Marjorie Perkins hopes that you can find her daughter Ruby, who's been missing for the past four days. Ruby's had a hard time of it lately-- who hasn't?-- ever since her husband's wealth vanished in the crash. Then, in the summer of 1930, he left one night for a pack of cigarettes and never came back. Ruby's lived in her mother's tenement apartment ever since. The past few weeks, before she disappeared, Marjorie says that Ruby had taken to long walks heading God knows where, vanishing for hours at a time, and then talking funny when she came back. Something about a garden, overflowing towers of champagne, and a green light shining in the darkness.\n\nCan you find her? And if you do-- can you bring her back?",

Those of you who have been in the program for months have seen no evidence to suggest otherwise. There's nothing but mountain forest rolling around you, blue as the name suggests. \n\nEveryone has a different story of how they got here and why. If you'd read the glossy brochures that your parents had studied, you'd have read that Summit Journeys promises one of the most effective [wilderness therapy programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness_therapy) for teens on the East Coast. Treating both boys and girls ages 14 - 17, Summit takes troubled teens who struggle with drug abuse, anxiety, depression, defiance, aggression, low self-esteem, and a host of other challenges and introduces them to a therapeutic natural environment free of the distractions that trap them in a cycle of bad habits and disappointment. The program offers nothing less than life-altering transformation for lost teenage souls.\n\nBut you didn't read those brochures. If you're like most of the students at Summit, you woke up to two muscular men in your room who informed you that you were coming with them, one way or another. Some of your parents watched you go, even said good-bye. None of them write to you now, though it's not their fault. Contact with the outside isn't allowed. You're here in the mountains with other \"at-risk teens,\" hiking every day and camping in primitive shelters every night, until the counselors say that you're better. The only escape comes in your dreams, when alone in your tent you take yourself to a world where you have not been abandoned. \n\nIt may be closer than you think.\n\n*Come away, O human child!*\n*To the waters and the wild*\n*With a faery, hand in hand,*\n*For the world\u2019s more full of weeping than you can understand.*\n\n-- \"The Stolen Child,\" W.B. Yeats",
