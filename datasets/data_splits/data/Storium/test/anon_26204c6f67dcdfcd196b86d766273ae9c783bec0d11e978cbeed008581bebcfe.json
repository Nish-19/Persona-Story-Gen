        "writing_prompt": "A mysterious green light fills the room as a man waits for a phone call that may never come, while elsewhere, strangers gather in a cramped apartment at the invitation of a kindly woman with secrets of her own. What connects them, and what truths lie hidden in the shadows of their meeting?",
        "story": "*\"Won't you come down, old friend?\" the older man said. His eyes blinked hugely behind enormous spectacles, sparing no attention for the opulent bedroom surrounding him.* *The only other soul in the room turned from the window. He was a younger man, fit for magazine pages, and he did not remove his hands from his pockets as he graced his companion with a brief smile.* *\"I'd love to, but I'm afraid it can't be helped. You see, I've got a phonecall coming through, and I simply can't miss it.\"* *The older man fidgeted scrupulously with his spectacles. \"I'm not so sure that phone call's coming,\" he said at last.* *The younger man turned away then. To him, the future was a house already constructed and populated with furniture, and he could stroll its halls counting the fiber in each forecasted carpet. If the spectacled man couldn't unlock the front door, that altered neither the contents of the house nor the certainty of its foundation. \"Why don't you go on down,\" he said presently. \"The party will be starting soon.\"* *\"I suppose so.\" The older man blinked owlishly. \"But-- listen, you'll come down and join us one of these times, won't you? I mean to say, it'd be swell to have you. Sooner or later-- you'll come down?\"* *\"Soon as I take this phone call, old sport,\" the younger man said, but he did not look at his companion as he spoke. A secret was spreading through him in a softening flow of reassurance that set his stance more firmly on the floor and his shoulders more at ease in his impeccable jacket. As his secret reached his face and bloomed there into a dazzling smile, the windows of the room filled with vibrant green light, and the walls shivered in emerald waves. * *\"It won't be long now,\" the younger man said. \"You go on now. Enjoy yourself.\"* *\"Well, alright.\" The older man shuffled to the staircase. As he had for the past decade, he left his companion alone to aim his unfaltering smile into the blind green glare.* --- *\"They used to tell me I was building a dream, and so I followed the mob...\"* As the first of them squinted at faded door numbers, walking over boards that creaked painfully but by some architectural miracle did not give way, [Rudy Vallee's voice]( filled the cramped hallway. The walls were thin here. Doors, too. Thinner than usual, anyway. Whoever had that radio played music for the entire third floor... and whoever was boiling that cabbage perfumed it, too. Between Apartment 3A and 3C was a blank door. Squint hard enough, and the ghost of a \"3\" distinguished itself from the rest of the faded paint. 3B, then. The apartment of Marjorie Perkins-- and, until recently, one Ruby Hollister, the name that had drawn them here. *\"When there was earth to plow, or guns to bear, I was always there right on the job...\"* A second knock was rewarded with the sounds of shuffling, and the door trembled as an unseen hand fumbled with a lock on the other side. It swung open, and there stood Marjorie Perkins through the doorway. Her smiling face resembled the postcard of a schoolteacher, every wrinkle a suggestion of gentle sympathy. \"Oh, hello, hello! So good to see you. Please, come in.\" Marjorie backed away from the door, sustaining her smile even though the effort of moving showed in her face. *\"They used to tell me I was building a dream, with peace and glory ahead...\"* The sound of that far-off radio was barely muted as the front door of Marjorie's apartment swung closed. There wasn't much to see in the cramped apartment. A single room attempted to fulfill the function of bedroom, kitchen, and sitting room in one cramped space, though efforts had been made to add comfortable touches. Some personal effects-- an uncommonly daring jacket, a few magazines scattered on the table-- clearly belonged to the younger occupant. Marjorie flapped her hand at a threadbare loveseat and a cluster of chairs. \"You just sit for a spell and make yourself at home. I've talked to a few other people-- hope you don't mind, but it just seems the kind of thing that could use a few minds working together. They'll be along soon enough, I imagine.\" She turned to a cutting board, where lay the makings of a few humble sandwiches. \"Now, why don't you tell--\" There was a knock at the door. \"Oh.\" Marjorie half-turned from the first comer to the door. \"That would be another one. You're all such nice people-- coming over and helping me like this-- I 'magine you'll get along famously, once you get to know each other.\" *\"Why should I be standing in line, just waiting for bread?\"* \"Would you mind getting that, dear? I've a mind to be a half-decent hostess, even in these times...\""

        "writing_prompt": "A group of troubled teens on a wilderness retreat must navigate not only the challenges of survival but also the secrets lurking in the forest as a storm brews overhead\u2014what will they discover when the rain begins to fall?",
        "story": "Theyd hiked halfway up Unega Peak when Kurt, the Head Counselor of Summit Journeys Expedition Team, planted his hands on his hips and squinted through an opening in the branches. The exact time of day was impossible to tell, except for the counselors with their waterproof sports watches. Rainclouds had darkened the western horizon all afternoonat least, Ryan had called it the western horizon, and Ryan had been a Boy Scout for five years. Said he was, anyway. Now the sky hung above them in a palette of charcoals and ash. That could mean oncoming dusk or bad rain. See that out there? Kurt pointed toward the valley below, where fog spilled between the mountains like smoke. Gonna be a hell of a night. Or both. Yee fucking haw, pardner, someone in the cluster of students muttered in a cartoonish Old West accent. A few heads turned. There were twelve students at Summit this week twelve dirty, sweaty, exhausted teenage souls carrying at least twenty pounds each through miles of mountain wilderness. Only a few could muster the energy for sarcastic comments before dinner. Whats that? Kurt said sharply. Nobody moved Uh huh. Kurt shook his head. Dont bring a bad attitude out here, people. Wilds got no place for it. You all wound up here for different reasons, but youve all got the same goal: youve gotta change your path. Change your attitude, change your path. Got it? Got it, a few low voices replied. The students knew better than to show any obvious signs of skepticism. *Got it?* Got it! Better, or Im gonna be hauling your ass up and down these trails til Christmastime. Kurt planted one foot on a swell of tree root, the stance he always took when it was time to stop for the day. Alright, time to set up our vacation homes. Eloise. He waited for her to make eye contact before continuing, pointing to Aaron and Izzie. Youre gonna take our newcomers and show em how to make a proper fire. Tomorrow night, theyre taking charge of it on their own, so do a good job unless youve got an appetite for cold beans. Dont go chasing squirrels this time, yeah? Someone spat into the underbrush. This time, there was no need to look for the culprit. No one hawked a loogie as loudly or as often as Brett-- Brett with his low drawl, hunched shoulders, and enough jail stories to fill an episode of Beyond Scared Straight. Brett. Nope. Kurt waved him over with a lazy swing of his arm. Were gonna have a conversation. Liz, you mind divvying up the rest of the work? Brett. You, here. Come on. Whatever. Brett slumped after Kurt, the two of them moving just out of earshot into the forest. Liz, the second most experienced counselor, shook her head. There he goes again. Alright! Listen up, people The usual set of chores stood between them and sweet, sweet rest. In the wilderness, at least the work made sense. Everyone had to set up their own shelters, while specific chores rotated among the students: making the fire, cooking the group meal, gathering kindling and deadfall, andeverybodys *favorite* chorepit duty. The forest didnt offer indoor plumbing. A few specks of water dotted the students forearms the skys warning shots. Could be in five minutes or in two hours, but those clouds were ready to open."
