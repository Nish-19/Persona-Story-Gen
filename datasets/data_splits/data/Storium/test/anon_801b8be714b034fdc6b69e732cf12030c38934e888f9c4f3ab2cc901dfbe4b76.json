            "story_name": "The *Vent l\u00e9ger* has finally set sail \u2013 the well-known ex-military airship has been repurposed for a government funded colonial project to an unclaimed island off the eastern coast of Africa. The age of expansion and technological revolution was circulating the globe and France\u2019s territory continued to expand each day to compete with the ever-dominant British Empire and the rising influence of German, Belgian and Russian colonial adventures. Whilst the colonial project may have been approved and funded by the French government, make no mistake, the island was not backed by the French regime until it was an established, sustainable colony. They would receive supplies sporadically when requested from the French mainland but these would be inconsistent until the island had a decent port or airship mast.  The Earth, the fertile plain that had harboured and raised humanity from the dawn of time was no longer unconnected and infinite, the land was running out and the Empire needed to compete with its rivals.\n\nExpedition leader, and self-appointed Mayor, Cyril Berlioz had scouted the best of France for noted explorers, scientists, builders and soldiers to help assist him in his expedition, however, this expedition came with a cost. The French government, in return for their limited assistance, requested that the island can also be used to remove any political dissidents and convicts to earn their penance far from France\u2019s continental shores. Without the funds, the expedition would never have occurred and Cyril had no option but to accept. St Cernunnos, as the island had been named by the French explorer that found it, was named after an ancient Gaulic God of fertility and prosperity \u2013 roughtly fifty miles from the Somali coast. It was lauded as an oasis and a prime candidate to be a trading hub within the Indian Ocean. \n\nIt has been four days since you boarded the *Vent l\u00e9ger* in Marseilles and set sail for the island with all your worldly possessions and supplies provided by the French Government. The Captain, Nathan Arceneaux, is a distinguished military captain and in a rush to see you and supplies safely left on the island of St Cernunnos. \n\nIt remains to be seen, however, whether the darkness that stalks the island is ready to welcome your colonial adventures\u2026\n\n(-) (-) (-)\n\nApplication: I have made a few basic cards, but any applicants may feel free to create any new cards that they desire. I would like pictures either real or drawings for all cards! \n\nPremise: Steampunk, semi-historical world surrounding a colonial start up on a far flung island chain off the African coast in the early 1910s. The technology will be slightly more steampunk and slightly ahead of it\u2019s time but nothing too outlandish \u2013 heavy card plays will be needed due to lots of extra assets and goals.\nUnderneath all this, however, a lurking mysterious threat is watching, waiting for the colony to be established\u2026\n",
