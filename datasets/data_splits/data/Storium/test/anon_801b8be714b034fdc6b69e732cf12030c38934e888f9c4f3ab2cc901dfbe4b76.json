        "writing_prompt": "A covert team aboard the experimental Helo-Class Cruiser *Hope* is sent deep into Batarian space to investigate a colony rumored to be experimenting with forbidden Geth AI technology. With no official ties to the Galactic Council, how will this untested crew navigate the dangers of their mission\u2014and each other?",
        "story": "Halcyon Initiative Helo-Class Cruiser Hope, or HC-1 Hope for short, continued to cut a fine line through the vast emptiness of Batarian space. The ship was slightly smaller than the previous Normandy class vessel that the standard across the Systems Alliance fleet. The Helo-Class Cruiser was a joint project between the Turian and Human council members to combine the added agility of human fleets to the brute-strength and toughness of Turian designs. So far, only one Helo-Class Cruiser Hope had been completed to adequate designs and had immediately been commissioned to the Halcyon Initiative. A powerful element zero core powered three versatile engines that continued to burn an icy blue against the blackness of space. The interior was an authoritarian mixture of metallic silver surfaces and smoothed white plastics. The ship was fully outfitted with all that was required for a covert mission squad. A small Medbay and research room that took up a tiny space at the rear of the ship. A large engineering bay complete with prison cells and armoury that would provide them with most of the technology and weapons required to overcome their foes. A large crew deck and command module that took up the majority of the ships prow, the sparkling holographic projector showed the galactic survey standard map and tracked their progress towards their target, a minuscule system deep in Batarian space, as a yellow line blinking occasionally. The initial summons from the Galactic Council had been an odd thing, a discrete message sent over omnitool or, in some cases, a dataslate passed across a crowded room from an unknown associate. The Halcyon Initiative had been formed soon after the 'Incident' on the Citadel Commander Shepherd had saved the Council from the horrors of a rogue spectre and an enormous unknown ship that appeared to have corrupted those who work with it. Now Commander Shepherd had gone. Died and reborn with Cerberus, he could be an unknown entity either working with the Illusive Man to save the galaxy or merely to be a pawn of a 'human-focused' near-terrorist group. Commander Shepherd had never failed them before, but, they need an alternative to solve mysteries and questions that had risen from the attack. Spectres couldn't be used, they would draw too much attention and would be limited to the Galactic Council races. The Halcyon Initiative would be 'connected' to the Galactic Council in the most loose sense of the word. They would consult with the Galactic Council for missions and assistance but, if captured or killed in the field, they were a rogue group looking for answers in dangerous times. Hope continued to speed through the bleakness on course to a small Batarian colony on Vana. The Galactic Council had received credible intel that a Batarian outpost on the colony had been investigating Geth AI components to assist in Batarian ships VI's. It was of utmost priority that the outpost was investigated and decommissioned. It had been a rushed job, gathering the necessary fighters from across the galaxy to fight for the greater good whilst on the clock against Batarian neglect of Galactic law. The crew needed to time to adapt and trust each but, unfortunately, that would be on the front-line of their first mission..."

        "writing_prompt": "Aboard the aging airship *Vent lger*, a mix of hopeful colonists and ex-convicts hurtle toward an uncharted island to establish a secret French colony. As tensions rise and the journey nears its end, whispers of sabotage and hidden motives begin to spread\u2014what secrets are hidden among the passengers, and will they reach their destination unscathed?",
        "story": "The Airship *Vent lger* was buffeted slightly by a crosswind and the Captain ably rebalanced the various brass propellers on each side of the large wooden brass hull. The journey felt, for most, to have been taking an age but the weather had held until recently blazing sun on most days and only the occasional windswept day to break the repetition. The launch party had been twenty days prior, the Emperor had made sure it was a hushed affair. He did not want to boast to the world that France was continuing to expand its influence in the Indian Ocean before the colony collapsed in failure and misery he would announce the success of the colony venture once he *knew* that the colony was flourishing. Whilst some local, Marseilles, press was allowed to interview and photograph some of the prominent guests aboard the *Vent lger*; the Emperor ensured that no one was there to see the convicts and exiles board the airship during the dead of night. Once aboard the ship, however, the convicts and exiles were not imprisoned in the brig or forced out of earshot this journey and colony would be their penance and their sentence they were now free amongst the other inhabitants of the *Vent lger* prior to the journey. It was plain to see that many distrusted or despised their new fellow colonists on the journey and many of the ex-convicts spent their time together towards the rear of the main cabin playing poker under the watchful eyes of the military trained aboard. Insurrection was always a threat and the Captain had reiterated after launch that any attempt to circumvent the Emperors will would lead to a swift execution. It was early afternoon, so most of the colonists were milling around the cavernous main cabin which stretched the length of the airship. The glass ceiling allowed them to see the hefty dirigible above them, connected by heavy copper cables to the main deck, and the Indian Sun illuminated the main cabin brightly. Katia Dufresne, the ships cook, was ably constructing the afternoon buffet in the far corner of the room her small but efficient kitchen emanating the delicious smell of bouillabaisse through the cabin. It seemed like all days previous had been an incoherent blur of orders from Mayor Berlioz and Captain Arceneaux to check, and then re-check, the limited supplies that the Emperor had given the expedition and assist with general maintenance of the aging airship. This blustery afternoon, however, the Captain and Mayor seemed predisposed to leave the colonists be and, for the first time on the airship, the colonists had more than a few rushed minutes to really introduce themselves and their hopes for the colony. Despite all the work, boredom was commonplace amongst the colonists also. The main cabin had some battered board games, cards and dice which the ex-convicts mainly used to crudely gamble and a vast collection of second-hand books for them to read, however, being trapped on the airship was soon becoming intolerable for many aboard. At the helm of the ship, where the glass ceiling curved downwards towards the hull to allow them a clear perspective of the route in front of them, stood the two most important figures aboard the *Vent lger*. Beside the brass ships wheel, Captain Arceneaux stood frowning down at the choppy sea that was barely obscured by a few wispy clouds. Captain Arceneaux was an intimidating figure, stood bolt upright with one of his aged hands firmly clasped around the ships wheel, he had a greying beard that that matched his precision haircut. He had seen battle many times in service of the French Empire and, it was plain to see, that being tasked with delivering a colonial mission was considerably beneath him. The legend of him evading Russian flak fire to drop bombs on St Petersburg had been the talk of France less than twenty years ago and now he found himself having to evade the faint wind that blew across the ocean. He was eager to return to France and prepare for the inevitable, as many at home saw it, war with Britain. Roughly eighteen hours til we reach our destination, the Emperor will be pleased, thats an entire day ahead of schedule. He spoke confidently, staring at his companion. Beside him, only slightly shorter than the Captain, Mayor Cyril Berlioz smiled broadly and pulled out a miniature telescope to comb the horizon with. This is most fortuitous news, Captain Arceneaux, Cyril said loudly as he collapsed the telescope once more, a little disappointed that the island was not yet in view. Cyril was a man filled confidence and spirit, the son of a well-respected and revered industrialist back in Marseille; Cyril has been ordained the task of establishing the colony by the Emperor a real chance to make his own name in the Empire. Cyril was, perhaps, a little ostentatious and arrogant in conversation but was a much more approachable character when compared to the indomitable Captain. Cyril turned to the bustling main cabin and announced Less than twenty-four hours colonists and our new lives commence!"
