        "writing_prompt": "Aboard the secretive airship *Emporia*, a mix of convicts, colonists, and officials hurtle toward an uncharted Pacific island to establish a German colony. As the journey nears its end, tensions rise, stories unfold, and whispers of sabotage begin to spread\u2014who among them has a hidden agenda?",
        "story": "The Airship Emporia rocked slightly as it was buffeted by another cross-wind, the journey seemed to be endless but at least the weather had held for the majority of the trip. The launch ceremony had been a hushed affair, despite the *Emporia*s mission being one of great importance to spread Germanys influence in the Pacific, the Kaiser could not use the negative publicity of a failed launch. He would announce the colonial mission *after* it was a success. Therefore, the convicts and assembled members of the colonial crew embarked during the dead of night, the mission secretly departed from Hamburg and they had been encased in its wooden and brass panelling ever since. The convicts and prisoners were not held in the brig, this colonial mission was their penance. Of course, there were still guards and soldiers to ensure that they didnt get *too* carried away with their perceived freedom but they were allowed to mingle with their fellow colonists for the journey. They were roughly eighteen hours from their final destination, the steam engines continued to chug heartily in the background as everyone on board milled around the large central cabin. The blazing Pacific sun filtered through the windows and showed the vast expanse of blue sky and even darker blue sea. A wisp of cloud cut the scene in two, but no land could be seen from any of the tall windows. The hustle and bustle of the launch and the subsequent days of refuelling and resupplying had meant that many of the colonists had very little time to get to know each other. It appeared that, on this calm and clear day of sea-sailing, they would finally be able to share their stories with each other. If they didnt they would have to combat the creeping threat of boredom that had been encroaching on the journey, there is only so much that an Airship can provide to ease the plight of boredom. The airship had some battered board games that had been used on the previous journeys, several shelves of worn books and an abandoned radio post used to contact the outside world but, apart from that, there was very little in the form on entertainment. At the helm of the ship, observing the panoramic view of the ocean, were the two most important people aboard the *Emporia*. One was Captain Michael Schrmann, the young and energetic owner of the *Emporia* who had been hired by the German Empire to transport the colonial expedition under the shroud of secrecy and ensure they got to the Pacific Islands in one piece. He was a brutish young man, filled with the testosterone of youth that showed in his blas attitude to his subordinates and his inclination to take risks. Over China, he had nearly come under fire from Chinese defences due to his lax attitude to international exclusion zones, he was a hot-headed and feisty character. He wanted to do his task for the Empire and earn the recommendation of his superiors, so he could finally assume a greater role within the Airfleet. Roughly eighteen hours til we reach our destination, the Kaiser will be pleased, thats an entire day ahead of schedule. He spoke confidently, staring at his companion. Beside him, much shorter in stature and lacking the anger of youth, stood the expedition leader Walter Mathrop. Walter was an elderly industrialist that the Kaiser trusted to oversee the development of the Colony, almost like an unelected mayor, and ensure that the Kaisers pacific dreams flourished. He had been a shrewd businessmen during his time within the Empire in the textile industry and had built significant wealth for this expedition. After the untimely death of his wife, he decided that the life of adventure and exotic locations was for him and the Kaiser had no hesitation in allowing him his wish. That is most fortuitous, you have been an excellent Captain, Michael. He responded cooly. Walter was a much cooler man to approach, he had the pompousness that was almost synonymous with wealth but he was also approachable. He hadnt forgotten his working class roots. Walter spun on the spot to stare at the fifty or so colonists bustling behind him We had better get ready for landing people. Our glorious colony awaits! He smiled broadly and clapped as finished his announcement."

        "writing_prompt": "On the eve of World War II, an elite team of international commandos, each with unique skills and secrets, is assembled for a top-secret mission to infiltrate Poland and stop the Axis powers before the war spirals out of control. What alliances, betrayals, and impossible choices will shape their journey?",
        "story": "**September 2nd 1939 09:00 War Office London** Several uniform black vehicles line the pavement outside of the War Office on a warm mid-September morning in 1939, the trepidation in the air was almost tangible. The world, yet again, seemed balanced on the precipice of another global war. In the East, the Japanese had seized on their territorial ambitions in the South Pacific, first with Manchuria and Korea, now their focus seemed to be on annihilating the Chinese. In Africa, Italy had decided that their territory in Libya was not enough to compete with Britain and France and had completed a full scale invasion of Ethiopia, one of the few countries left unaltered by imperialist colonialism. Finally, In Europe to German spectre rose again above the battlefields of France and Poland, only recently returning to normality, ready to resurrect the eternal Reich that the Kaiser, those many years ago, had envisaged. Sir Hugh Quex Sinclair sat behind his royal mahogany desk looking over several status reports from agents in the field in these areas of tensions and hostilities. Britain couldnt afford, nor even risk, a global conflict at this time. The Great War had depleted the great treasures of Pax Brittainia and now, in all manner of irony, her former colonies were beginning to outshine her. He took a long drag on a cigarette before stubbing the remainder out in a gold plated ashtray, he knew that this operation was one of the biggest to be undertaken by Britain It could save her from the brink of collapse. Outside, the officials and delegates from several nations are seemingly unnoticed by the public, until they realise that the entire street has been cordoned off for the mean time. Representatives from the United States, The Soviet Union, France, Poland and several others emerged from their automobiles and ascended the steps into the lavish reception room. The representatives of the states went left, to meet with the prime minister and his affiliates and discuss the political implications, whilst the agents who were outnumbered five to one by their delegates went right, towards Sir Hughs office. These countries had been summoned several weeks ago, on a top secret mission that crossed political and ideological boundaries to end a second global war, to stop Germany, Italy, Japan and anyone else who threatened the global status quo as quickly and as effectively as possible. Commandos. The soldiers, having been recruited around the world for their excellent combat skills, were also *unique* in their own way, much to the respect and honour of their peers, this meeting was to be brief and insightful before they were being sent out to the slaughter. Good morning soldiers, tomorrow the United Kingdom and France are preparing to declare war against Nazi Germany. You are going to Poland, tonight. Any questions? He smirked ostentatiously at blurting all that classified information and waited for their response. Beside him, a young and debonair scientist stood apprehensively twiddling with an ornate ivory dagger. I am Winston Eddington, your Quartermaster so to speak, we have very little time to get your requests but, he paused and smiled I will endeavor to provide you with weaponry and communications."

        "writing_prompt": "A once-thriving district now overrun by crime, a police department wiped clean and rebuilt from scratch, and a fiery Chief determined to restore order\u2014what secrets and challenges await the new recruits of Arklay Police Department as they step into the shadows of a city on the brink?",
        "story": "Arklay Police Department was a downtrodden building. Sitting on the junction of Main and Sixth, the dilapidated sixties building was showing all the signs of its age. Faded paint, chipped concrete and sagging plastic that adorned the brutalist frame of the structure. On one side of the building, down an alley that connected Main with the Police Department car park, the message of eternal youth *Fuck The Police* was scrawled in angry red lettering over the concrete. The heavy orange sun began to sink beneath the towering skyline and bathed the dilapidated station in an auburn glow. Arklay had seen better days. Once, it had been the regenerative hope of the sixties, as the prefabricated homes and offices were torn down and replaced with the concrete and steel buildings of the future. Now, however, Arklay was rife with crime and destitution. Half of the buildings in the area were in a major state of disrepair or abandoned completely. The mafia had moved in, in force and now ran a protection racket that was nigh on untouchable under the previous regime and crime rates had soared past the threshold of public or fiscal tolerance. The Chief had ordered a sweeping press conference that stunned both local and regional news outlets. The Chief wiped the entire department in Arklay from their jobs either into retirement or into other departments as a major restructure only one or two extreme veterans were allowed to retain any influence within the precinct. She had wanted a fresh slate for the neighbourhood of Arklay that had been let down by generations of mismanagement and poor policing. The powerful rhetoric had worked on the populace, leading the Chief into a healthy range of mid-term public opinion polls but, now, she had to deliver. The car park of Arklay Police Department was busy, new employees transferred as far in as from across the state to start their new police journey. To set Arklay back on the straight and narrow. The redistribution of certain figures within the department had been viewed with scepticism from some aspects of the media. Was it really a robust challenge on the criminality of Arklay by a courageous Chief or, was it actually, a restructuring by the Chief to set some members of the department up to fail spectacularly? The whispering media mill continued to turn quietly in the background. One floor above the central reception, in a small but functional briefing room. The Chief, a middle aged fiery woman with flaming red hair stood beside the large oak conference table, a glass of iced water clutched in her hand tightly. She surveyed the room with a cold stare, it was her reputation at stake here and she knew that she had to deliver. She may have her fingers in many political and media pies but even the sweetest treat can sour with failure. She is joined by the many recruited members of the new Arklay Department, and one or two of the remaining figures about to depart. Chief among them, the retiring Lieutenant James Gamble, who was once held as a stalwart of bullish interrogation and getting results whatever the cost, who seemed wilted by his age and situation. Mutterings had that the Chief *forced* his decision to retire and that he was merely there for some of the media to get a few last snaps and portray a *happy* handover. The large media screens at one end of the screens recycled images of a happier time in Arklay, when the district had been a blossoming community with a strong police force, and along one wall there was a selection of meagre buffet food and drinks. It seemed to mirror an optimistic parents attempt to win over their child when they had done something wrong. Trying too hard to appear normal just made the *entire* scenario awkward. The Chief took a long cold gulp of the iced water before speaking, lightly rapping her pale knuckles against the table to gain the attention of the room. The mild ambient music filtering through the aging speakers stopped immediately. Thank you everyone for attending. Thank you especially to those of you selected to bring Arklay back under the firm rule of the law and justice. Too long has Arklay been allowed to slump into the archaic depravity of the mafia and oversee rampant disregard for the basics of civilised society. I am pleased to see such a stellar selection from across the city and the state here to reverse this dangerous trend. The speech was full of powerful statements for the media types to note, two of the journalists had already flipped their pads open and were scratching notes. Lieutenant Gamble took a hefty draft from his *Budweiser* in response, he had no intention of listening to his record being shat on whilst sober. He stalked, unnoticed by the reporters, to a far corner of the room and stared reminiscently at the slowly changing photographs. Sandras eyes hardened as she noticed the former Lieutenant sulking. Crime doesnt pay in Arklay anymore than any other district in this fine city. She boomed articulately. Failure is not an option here. Arklays citizens demand more than what they have received in recent years and you she pointed her finger across the new Arklay Department staff. Are my hopes of reversing the situation. But, more importantly, you are all *their* hopes. Now, lets celebrate and get to know each other. She plastered the fakest smile across her face as one of the cameras clicked satisfactorily in the background. The music returned to fill the silence after her speech and people began to mill around the room. The Chief was alone, affording the opportunity to ask her more about the Arklay Police Department and their remit, if anyone of them fancied the chance"
