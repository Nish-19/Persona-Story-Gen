            "story_name": "1874 was a year of adventure within the German Empire. The Kaiser Otto Von Faustenberg has urged a new wave of colonial expeditions to the furthest unclaimed lands from the homeland, the time for expansion was dying and the Kaiser had no intention of being left behind by the great powers of New Francia, Iberia and The Federated United Kingdom. The Earth, the fertile plain that had harboured and raised humanity from the dawn of time was no longer unconnected and infinite, the land was running out and the Empire needed to compete with its rivals. \n\nYou are going to be setting sail on the airship *Der Geist* for one of the most far flung regions of the Earth. You have either been vetted and selected by the Empire Colonial Board or been forced to by either the penal system or corporate contract to settle these unknown lands. It has been ten days since you left the bountiful fields of the German Empire for the dangerous and unknown shores of the Pacific Region, an unclaimed and unknown archipelago has been claimed for the Kaiser known as * Die Scatter Inseln* (The Scatter Isles).  It is the final day of the journey that your story begins, the airships last few hours before it will descend and abandon you, with all your worldly supplies and belongings, on these treacherous islands.\n\nYour bravery and colonial spirit will be spoken of with pride in the homeland but, for you, the journey of establishing a colony is only now about to begin. \n\nUnbeknownst to the would be colonists, these islands have been long uninhabited for a *reason*. One that lurks in the shadows of the jungle and longs for the attention of humans that have called its earth home. When they come back into contact, who knows what will happen\u2026\n\n(-) (-) (-)\n\nApplication: I have made a few basic cards, but any applicants may feel free to create any new cards that they desire. I would like pictures either real or drawings for all cards! :)\n\nI will not be operating on a first come first serve system and will be waiting to acquire a number of applications and selecting the best from those available.\n\nPremise: Steampunk, alternative world surrounding a colonial start up on a far flung island chain in the Pacific. The technology will be steampunk with some futuristic components, basic computers exist for example, and will focus on impressing the Empire and surviving. \n\nUnderneath all this, however, the lurking lovecraftian threat is watching, waiting for the colony to be seduced and used by his power\u2026\n\nPacing: I will be operating on a Normal pace. The first few days will no doubt be decently active, so I would appreciate all those that apply be ready to keep up with the fast initial pace. After this, however, it would be appreciated if we can aim for the 2/3 scene minimum per week.\n\nWord Limit: I have the game set to \u201cNo Word Limit\u201d with the expectation that certain objectives within the story may take more time to accomplish than others, and I do not want the players to feel restricted. I will give large leeway to the characters and the story that we will jointly create, I have only a rough guideline of the story but I am happy to ditch this if we create something more exciting! I am excited for your application!\n",

            "story_name": "August 1939, only one month before the world would be changed forever. The Great Powers of the world, yet again, lined themselves up to face each other in a battle of ideology, economics and manpower once more. The lessons of The Great War had not been thoroughly learned or appreciated by the statesmen of the nineteen-thirties, they were swept up by nationalism, imperialism, protectionism in a lethal cocktail that would burn the throats of many. \n\nOne month prior to spark of Nazi aggression against Polish sovereignty, the Great Powers of the world sent their best soldiers to a secret meeting held at the War Ministry in London. Whilst the diplomats that accompanied them would hash out the details of their international agreement, the elite soldiers would meet with their colleagues on the dawn of the most tragic war to scar the Earth. This elite Special Forces team will face some the most fearsome situations across the globe throughout the course of the war, from submarine infiltrations to frontline fighting, the group will be expected to traverse any challenge. As the cars arrived at the grim exterior of the War Ministry\u2026 Everything was about to change\u2026\n\n(-)(-)(-)\n\nPremise: This is where the premise of the story begins, each player represents an elite commando/soldier from their respective country who want to prevent the expansion of the Nazi Germany and the possibility of a Second World War. You will be going on missions throughout the Second World War trying to undermine the key advances, the key attacks and help fight the war on the Allies behalf. Tensions will obviously arise, the USSR representative will resent the delaying tactics by the Western Nations to join the battle on continental Europe, and the group will view the representatives of Turkey and Republican Spain as dangerously close to aligning to the fascist agenda. You the players, as a group will overcome these differences and attempt to change the course of history.\n\nStyle: The story is going for a medium/fast pace throughout the story and would like to stick with a third person past tense style, not necessary but would like some cohesion. Will be happy to allow characters to use NPC\u2019s as much as they like in their own post and would like cooperation between players for improvisation (Revisions will be freely available if anything is too far). This game had a loose plot but will be heavily influenced by player interaction and choices!\n\nCharacter Creation: Natures are there for guidelines pictures and descriptions can be edited but would like the essential nature to remain the same. However, strengths, weaknesses and Sub-Plots are there to provide guidelines or to be used and edited. I would like quite a lot of backstory in the descriptions of your characters.\n",

            "story_name": "Arklay District is going downhill, the economy bottomed out and the industry that once kept this part of the city thriving has abandoned the inhabitants. Many have left, many others have turned to crime and depravity. It is up to the small Arklay precinct to maintain order and law in an area that seeks nothing more than to separate itself from the so-called society that wishes to protect it. The Chief is expecting results, the areas crime rate has risen by twelve percent and the failures of the police in the area threaten to become a national news story. You have been drafted in as a department restructuring to restore order to Arklay and give the residents the peace of mind that the police are there to protect them and that the word of law is *final*. \n\n(-) (-) (-)\n\n*Premise*: A procedural police drama set in a downtrodden area of a large American City, each player will have been drafted in by the Captain to take over at Arklay Police Department and turn around an area of the city that has been damaged by the recession and spiralling crime rates. The game will open with a meeting at the department as a celebration of the switch over presided over by the chief and you may or may not be introducing yourselves to each other for the first time.\n\n*Post Length and Tense*: I would like a 250 word minimum post per player as I am not a fan of small posts and would prefer past tense third person but I am willing to negotiate.\n\n*Character Creation*: All cards are placeholders and can be edited or changed but I would like a large backstory to work with in the beginning. Expect a slow build up to some serious cases that will try the entire department. I am hoping to get some complex work relationships that will help drive this character driven storium. \n\nCurrent Specs (May Change): 1 Lieutenant, 2 Detectives, 2 Patrol Officers, 1 CSI Technician and 1 Mortician.\n\nAny questions I am happy to discuss via a Private Message! \n",
