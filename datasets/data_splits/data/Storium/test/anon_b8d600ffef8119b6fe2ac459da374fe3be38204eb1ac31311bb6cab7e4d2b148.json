Upon the death of the beloved King Sagaron of the House of the Griffin, the powerful House of the Dragon declared Sagaron's chosen heir illegitimate and unfit for the crown, putting forward their own purported heir to the throne. The other great noble houses of the realm chose their sides, and the land descended into chaos and war.\n\nAfter thirty years of bloody battle, both houses have finally lost their taste for war. The armies are exhausted, and years of poor harvests have left the country on the brink of famine. If peace cannot be achieved, it seems doom shall come to all of Alavorn.\n\nWith disaster looming, the Dragon and the Griffin have reluctantly agreed to a truce, swearing to call a moot at which all the great noble houses of Alavorn shall finally settle the matter of succession without further bloodshed. Little do they realize that they will soon be faced with an even greater threat than one another.",

He destroyed the armies, devoured the royal family, reduced the temples and the mage's guild to rubble, and demanded ludicrous tributes of treasure and livestock from those who survived his rampage.\n\nThis was a dark time, but many found hope in a prophecy given by the oracles of old, just before the collapse of the kingdom. This prophecy foretold a hero would rise to dispel the evil plaguing the land, a young man of incredible courage and skill. Wielding a holy sword wreathed in blue flame, this hero would slay the dragon, restore peace, and become the new King of Morcalia.\n\nThe prophecy has now come to pass. Kalben the Brave, once a simple peasant lad, quested to find the sword of legend. Knowing no fear, he ventured into the lair of the dread dragon and slew it himself. The people rejoiced and immediately declared him king.\n\nOf course, the prophecy never said what sort of king the foretold hero would be. Kalben is still a very young and inexperienced man with virtually no formal education and a limited understanding of the world beyond heroic adventuring. If he was to achieve the same success in ruling as he achieved in adventuring, he would need the assistance of his stalwart companions and advisers.",

These diverse groups worship an equally diverse pantheon of Gods and Goddesses. Some pay homage to gods of war and the hunt, others worship deities of healing and music. Only one deity is revered by virtually all people of Alavorne: Flavoran, God of Food, Cooks, and Brewers.\n\nLove of food is universal in Alavorne. Though every culture has their unique culinary traditions, each has their own way of revering the art of making delicious and beautiful meals. Like many deities, Flavoran is represented on the mortal plane through a small number of chosen followers, a respected elite revered as living saints. These are the Mithril Chefs, the four greatest culinary geniuses in the land, masters of their individual culinary techniques.\n\nAfter a lifetime dedicated to the art of cooking, one of the four has recently passed away. Now a new Mithril Chef must be found to fill the ranks. The remaining three have sent out a call far and wide, inviting all notable chefs from across the land to journey to the sacred Culinary Cathedral to join a culinary competition intended to find the next Mithril Chef. Those who take on the challenge will find their cooking skills tested against the greatest competitors the land has to offer. Only one can emerge as the next Mithril Chef.",
