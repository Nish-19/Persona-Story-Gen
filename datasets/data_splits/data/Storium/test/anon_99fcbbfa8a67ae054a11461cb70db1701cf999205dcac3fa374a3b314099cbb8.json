A Hawk commander has convinced the Skyriver Republic to launch an attack on the Bronze Egg, a well-guarded Kichledai base but one that will give safe acess to much of Alissandra for the republic and others if the Avarians can be driven out. \n\nNow it is up to you, a group of sailors in the Skyriver republic\u2019s navy to take and hold the base to put a serious halt to the Kichledai\u2019s plans of expansion and conquest, while also giving the Hawks a small bit of their ancestral home back.\n\n\nThis is a naval warfare game in a fantasy world with steampunk elements, even though the naval battles will take place  on bodies of water suspended miles in the air by unknown forces. There will also be airships at least once. \n\nThis game was inspired by the Alissandra world I created on \u201cAI Dungeon\u201d\n",
