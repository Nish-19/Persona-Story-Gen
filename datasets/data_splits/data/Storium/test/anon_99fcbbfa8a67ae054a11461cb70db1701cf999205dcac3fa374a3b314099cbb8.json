        "writing_prompt": "When the most dangerous team of extreme accountants\u2014the White Collar Gang\u2014storms the second National Bank of Emerald City, demanding tax returns and ledgers, the few heroes left in town must decide: is this a fight worth taking, or is paperwork their true kryptonite?",
        "story": "The reconverter of planets had just been seen flying past Pluto. The heroes of the world had thought they had had more time, but they all had finished school before Pluto stopped being a planet and so they had bargained that the horrible evil would start with that little ball of ice and snow, since it was o fun to eat snow and all. The creature had called out to the worlds villains too on social media, but some of the messages were blocked because of those pictures those handful of villains posted and several never heard about the big opportunity. Even so, enough had heard the call, and the heroes and villains from all over the world, and rushed to Washington, where all the big things happened, except for government to fight the menace, or join it. But some had to stay behind in the superpowered city of Emerald City Oregon. Some were deemed not ready, some knew that home needed protecting, and some just couldnt afford the bus fares. But anyway, there were a few heroes and villains left in the city, which grew quiet and peaceful with fewer flying cars, especially the non-flying kind, and volcanic eruptions blasting up through cracked sidewalks caused by all the frequent hero fights. With the relative lack of massive destruction, insurance companies were sending accessors to see if they could do business in the town again. Unfortunately, the peace could not last, the villains that were her were regrouping and one of the villain teams made their move on the second National bank of Emerald City. Nobody knew what had happened to the first one. A door flew off its hinges and 2 men and 2 women strode into the bank holding clipboards. All right everyone! The big man in front shouted, This is an audit! Everyone in the bank get out your sails receipts, tax returns, and business ledgers, Now! Dont make me use this clipboard in a bad way! You hear me!? The man shouted angrily, waving his ledger about, Were going to make sure you are FDIC compliant, and if you know whats good for you, youll cooperate. The four were the infamous White Collar Gang the most dangerous extreme accountants in all of the western United States, and they were aiming for the whole country, but the Wall Street Fat Cats were still far more successful. The leader was the infamous accountant, N. Triplicate, who had the unique ability to split into three musclebound hulks, but only when he held his clipboard of power. Next to him stood the mysterious Executrix, wielding a pen knife and a letter opener and taking up a martial arts stance. Her face was swathed in bandages as in her first fight, a hero sent her crashing through a glass ceiling. Rumor had it that she was actually the brains of the outfit, though not the voice. Behind them stood the Pink slip twins; two deadly siblings who ran a firm in Russia. However, they were forced out of their company and came to America to take up a life of crime. Downsize and Fired (Alexandra and Pavlov Ladolf respectively,) Each wielded a supply of deadly pink cards. Downsize could shrink people to the size of paperweights and fire caused people to ignite when she struck them with one of her own slips. However, they were still accustomed to their own business lives and were only competent throwers from a sitting position behind a desk. The Ladolf twins sought out their position, and a banker hit the alarm, hoping there were some heroes in the area to come and save them from perhaps hours of tedium."

        "writing_prompt": "A massive, sinking galleon drifts toward the docks, its crew fighting for survival amidst circling sharks and scattered cargo\u2014how will the townsfolk balance saving lives, salvaging goods, and fending off disaster?",
        "story": "Crack!!! The sound of wood breaking apart could even be heard from the shore as the battered ship, half-sunk already and with rigging in tatters drifted towards the docks. It wasnt going to make it. It was amazing that the ship hadnt sunk since it had come into view. Even so, it didnt have much time left. Everyone in town knew what to do, whether because it was the right thing to do or because of the kingdoms salvage laws that were there to make peoples greed save lives, the town was up. All could take a part in this. Alastra was to mobilize the boats, while Amos would go to rescue people from the water. Alan heard the seals excited about the wreck and saw there werent enough boats in town to rescue all the people on the large galleon as it sank. He might be able to work out a solution. But it wasnt just a sinking ship either, to lighten the boat to slow its fall into the inky depths of the ocean, the crew had thrown out everything, including several barrels of lard, and now sharks circled the boat, hoping for more dibbles to come their way. But despite everything, there was more sadly to think about than the crews lives. There were a fortune of goods on the boat and if at least some of them werent saved, lives would be ruined, even if they remained. Either from that knowledge, or just simply knowing that hed get a stake in the money brought in by anything he helped save, Hagley realized mackerel wouldnt be the only thing he might catch today in his nets. For Players: I am giving each of you a challenge with your characters name on it. There is a pre-determined strong or weak outcome to each one and all of them will be only one point. I will be giving myself one as well to demonstrate. When you have a challenge, when you play a card, you may play a strong, weak, or neutral card. Strength cards are the only strong cards and weakness cards are the only weak cards. Currently, sub-plots, assets, and goals (more on the latter 2 later) are neutral. When a challenge is completed, the result of the challenge is determined by the cards placed on it. If more strength cards were placed on a challenge than weak cards, the challenge outcome is strong. If more weakness cards are placed on a challenge than strong cards, then the outcome goes weak. If the number of strong and weak cards is equal, or the challenge doesnt get any strong or weak cards at all, the outcome is uncertain, which means that the narrator will adjudicate. In the case of an uncertain outcome, a player should not write the resolution of the challenge and should write what their character does but not how the challenge ultimately ends. Also, for how to play cards. Say for example, Alastra is set to ready the rescue boats. Suppose I want her to get the weak outcome on the challenge. I could play the superstitious weakness card she has. I would then write how Alastras superstition brings about her taking too long to have the boats ready. If I wanted the strong outcome, I might play Alastras Leader card, and then I would describe how her natural leadership helps her get the rescue boats into the water quickly. One final thing before I move on. One thing you should drill into your heads is that weaknesses and weak outcomes are not bad. Firstly, character flaws are often more interesting than when things are going well for your character so you shouldnt try to argue against your weak plays. If Alastra is being superstitious and it makes things go worse, I should embrace that as I write. Second. For most narrators, weakness doesnt mean game over or anything, it just means your characters will suffer a little or endure a little more hardship as they go along. Also, from a gameplay point of view, you cannot get more strength and weakness cards until you spend all of both. For narrators: In most of my games, I have a moment where characters make a cardless post at the beginning of the game to introduce their characters into the story, but being that this is a simple tale, I figured Id drop everyone right into the action. When coming up with these challenges, especially with the weak outcomes, I try to embrace, Failing forward. When you design a weak outcome in a challenge, the story and action should not be stopped if the weak outcome comes up. I also try to make my Weak outcomes just as interesting as my strong ones. Sometimes to give players more control, having multiple choices for outcomes that the players get to make can help, especially for weak outcomes, though I am not doing it right now."

        "writing_prompt": "As the fleet sails into enemy waters, a proud hawk captain rallies a diverse crew of mages, wyvern riders, and Pegasus-mounted cavaliers, promising glory, trade routes, and a chance to reclaim a lost homeland\u2014if they can survive the Kichledai navy.",
        "story": "The fleet knew theyd be seeing the Kichledai navy soon. They were approaching their waters, and the target would come into sight within a few days. The river was wide here, and so the ships moved several abreast, with no real risk of any of the ships crashing down beyond the misty edges of the bedlless rivers. Some merfolk ships hung in the river, their pontoon roofs holding the cage like frames below. Wyverns squawked furiously. Though the creatures were definitely draconic, they had the personalities of foul-tempered birds of prey, but their winged-elven handlers worked to keep the fragile trust that made their cavaliers, and the small dragons themselves major weapons of war. On a couple decks, Pegasus nostrils flared and the ears of the gentler of the two flying mounts of Alissandra always swiveled towards the wyverns, which were notably a threat to them if one got loose and it was hungry enough. But the rivers had meandered close enough to Goldfinch Isle, and the drifting aviary was always near the junctions of three major rivers. As cannon wheels squawked as they were wheeled into position, and the smell of petrichor rose as the handful of mages warmed up, or used their magic to adjust the wind or the currents for the sails, a bright yellow hawk, the Skyriver captain who had convinced the republic to authorize this bold move against the Kichledais Avarians was ready to address the fleet. Pilklik was generations removed from the times when the Hawks had any territory in Alissandra, but the oral traditions were strong among the hawks, and their hatred of the Avarians, and the Kichledai itself united the creatures that tended to work as mercenaries now. Pilklik knew the power of money, and also how much the Skyriver Republic loved it. Gold Finch Isle was an aviary on the edge of Kichledai territory and capturing it would open up a much better trade route. It would also be the first step the hawks would take to get their home back. Pilklik, a tall yellow-feathered hawk with taloned hands and looking like an enormous humanoid golden eagle, signaled to his wind and water mages. He would address the entire fleet. He lifted his large, taloned hand, and clacked the claws a couple times. The ships became engulfed in a fog, the moisture would make sound carry well, and the winds would blow his message well among the fleet. I am honored to work with the Skyriver Republic on this undertaking, Pilklik began, his beak clacking loudly on some of the hard consonants. The Kichledai have made us take the long ways around the river webs, He began, Many of you are probably from merchant families, Pilklik knew that only a few of the people here gave a flying frigate bird about the hawk homeland, so he knew he would only mention it briefly. Im doing this to reclaim my legacy, He said, But what you can get from it is cutting your time in half between Turtlefurt, Bat cove, and, North Ebbspan. Many of you will be hailed as heroes when this is done, by hawk and Skyriver citizen alike, Pilklik said, I dont know who, and I dont know whether I will lead all the way through, but there will be legends written here on this expedition. Several heard Pilkliks words, and as the fog cleared in an instant Each prepared to enter enemy waters."
