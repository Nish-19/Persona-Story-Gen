        "writing_prompt": "In the bustling chaos of Trade Station Heraklion, a shadowy fixer offers you a salvage job in the Rivera Belt\u2014simple on the surface, but nothing in this system ever stays that way for long. What secrets might the scattered cargo hold, and who else might be after it?",
        "story": "**_The Daggers Drawn_** **Trade Station Heraklion** At some point in the not-too-distant past, the Pelagius System had been beautifully unspoilt, as most places unfit for human habitation tended to be. Perhaps it had been a cold, indifferent, lifeless beauty, the kind that only an astronomer could truly appreciate, but even so, it was long gone now. It had started with the discovery of rare minerals in the asteroid fields, intensified as the mining of gas giants swung back into vogue, and now the ruin was complete. Pelagius was littered with makeshift tin-can orbital stations, barely equipped to handle mining, commerce, science, and all of the necessities of modern life. Of these floating bases or 'outposts', the largest and most prominent was Heraklion. When interstellar freighters made it to Pelagius, most of them docked here, so it was the best place to go if you had something to sell, or needed anything the system couldn't provide. It also housed _The Daggers Drawn_, the best-known merc bar in Pelagius. If you needed to hire someone who at least probably wasn't a pirate, there was nowhere better. There was nothing so crude as a \"job board\"; fixers and agents set up meetings in a discreet location, and sometimes friends ran into one another and exchanged details. Couriers, smugglers, salvage crews, even a few bounty-hunters: all could be found here if you knew who to ask. If you believed what _he_ had to say, Garim Larius knew everyone of importance in the whole system. He preferred to employ people who'd worked for him before, which had inspired \"that damn wrench jockey Malinowski\" to ask how anyone got a _first_ chance. Larius had glowered at her, but as luck would have it, he'd had a \"little job\" on his books just then... The rest, as a biographer might say, was history. He wasn't their most regular _or_ their most lucrative employer, but if he had something for them, it was usually worth a look. \"It ain't much of a job.\" They recognised this opening gambit for what it was: an attempt to keep the price down. If he didn't need them to do this, he wouldn't have asked. No one paid for nothing out here. \"Let us be the judge of that.\" \"That's probably best, yeah.\" Larius shot a sideways glance at his only companion, a quietly menacing woman he called Rigger. Whether it was her name, a nickname, a title, or just one of Larius's jokes, no one knew for sure. Nor was it clear what her position was; some claimed she was a simple bodyguard, others that she was the brains of the operation. The truth probably lay somewhere between the two, but wild speculation was more fun. As was her habit, she didn't say anything in reply; very few of Larius's business associates ever heard her speak. But she _did_ raise her eyes eloquently to the ceiling as he turned away. \"Alright, so, it's a salvage job, as I'm sure you could've worked out without me saying it. There's a cargoor part of a cargo, anywayspread across the Rivera Belt, a few hours from here as you head towards Shackleton. I got a client who wants it back, but either they can't be assed to get it, or they'd have to fill too many forms to do it the legit way.\" This was far from uncommon; besides the reasons Larius had offered, there was also a lot less chance of any higher-ups finding out what had happened if you hired mercenaries. \"So it's just a standard tractor beam job. Got any questions?\""

        "writing_prompt": "When an ancient archaeological dig uncovers whispers of demons and a bloodied mercenary stumbles into camp with dire warnings, the expedition leaders call for volunteers to investigate the mysterious Eastern Excavation\u2014will you step forward?",
        "story": "**Central Camp** **Hour 15 (mid-afternoon)** The expedition to Val'Raz, prepared with great care and expense by the combined efforts of the University and the Crown of Shalben, had thus far proceeded relatively smoothly. Of course, archaeology was never tidy, academia was never uncontentious, and nothing that involved so many people happened without *some* tears and headaches. But all things considered, it had gone well; the head of logistics had only threatened to resign twice. Then the disappearances had started. To begin with, it was no more than anyone might expect; the number of people on any dig who fled back to town on discovering how much _work_ archaeology involved was frequently staggering. The fog of suspicion and rumour was unsurprising, too, as the trenches uncovered secrets from a time of legend, and even scholars could have too much imagination. At some point, though, everyone had to accept that there might be more to it than fanciful tales from bored students or twitchy porters. That came when a grizzled veteran of the Tahellan Warmasters Guild limped into camp, barely upright, gasping and bleeding. Demons! Bael Sivornin had spent twenty years fighting beasts and men across the realms. He was no wet behind the ears greenhorn who might mistake a jungle creature for a fiend. If he said that there were demons, the expedition leaders would have to consider the idea. --- Twenty minutes later, the scene in the central camp was less a meeting than a cacophony. \"Well, no one _knows_ how Val'Raz fell \"But _demons_, really, how fanciful. Bandits, now that I could believe...\" An arcanist who went by the name of Ash grimaced to hear the talk. His long forked tail lashed out, disturbing several of his rivals' papers. Rumour said that his mother's mother was a demon from the Infernal Planes, so it was no wonder that he didn't like this line of talk. \"Typical, isn't it? The minute you can't explain something, it must have been _demons_.\" Everyone, please, this isnt helping. No one paid any attention to the efforts of the senior mage-scholar to bring the meeting to order until the Martial Commander slammed her blue steel-edged shield into the floor. Quiet! Irian Shildrath had the fierce nature and commanding presence common to clerics of the forge-god Sil Marne. She spoke, and suddenly everyone was quiet and respectful, glaring at their neighbours as if _other people_ had been causing the trouble, not them. Thank you, Lady Shildrath. She nodded, and took a step back, leaving the floor to the chief archaeologist, Najib Akhiran, who looked as if he would rather be anywhere else. The most important thing is to figure out what has happened. A few people seemed inclined to start whispering again, but a glare from Irian changed their minds. Bael is unconscious, so we cant question him now, and we cant afford to wait for him to wake up. He came from the Eastern Excavation, so I plan to send a party there to investigate. Najib looked around the room, but almost everyone avoided his eyes. More in hope than in expectation, he asked: Does anybody want to volunteer?"
