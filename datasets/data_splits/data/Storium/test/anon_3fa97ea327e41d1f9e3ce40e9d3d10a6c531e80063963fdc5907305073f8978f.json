The planets and asteroid fields are prime sites for gas and mineral mining\u2014and, even better, the place is so remote that the near-ubiquitous Company has only a token presence.\n\nThat might change one day, but for now, the system is free from their interference.  Free from protection, too, but those who would mind that don't come here.\n\nEven without the Company, most people in Pelagius are engaged in legitimate work, whether that's mining, trade runs, or scientific research.  Some skirt the line between legal and... not-so-legal, turning to salvage, bounty hunting and the odd smuggling run.  But that's all mostly harmless, and it's not as if you ever fire the first shot.\n\nAnd then there are the others: pirates and brigands who ply their nefarious trade from fortified \"rogue stations\".  People like the black-hearted crew of the _Shadow Chancellor_, a ship that everyone in the Pelagius System has learned to fear.\n\nThe best you can do is stay out of their way.  But that may be easier said than done.",

People lived in great cities, worshipped strange gods, and performed miracles as easily as breathing. Most wondrous of all was Val\u2019Raz, the Floating City, held aloft by spells now lost to time\u2014until disaster or affronted gods cast it down to earth.\n\nOr so the tales claim. Most serious scholars doubt that Val\u2019Raz ever existed, though it is true that the ancients possessed magic unknown to any still living.\n\nThen, an expedition sent by the renowned University of Shalben into the jungles of Tahella found a ruined city scattered across the landscape.  Rumour claimed it was the great Val'Raz, and though learned minds doubted, many still wanted to see.\n\nAs the excavation of the ruins progressed, guards and scholars began to go missing. No one knew what to make of it, not until a survivor limped back to camp.\n\nHe spoke one word and then collapsed. \u201cDemons!\u201d",
