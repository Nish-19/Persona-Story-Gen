            "story_name": "The island resort has turned into a nightmare. The beach sand has turned so thick with blood that not even the tide can wash it away. \n\nThere aren\u2019t many folks left... not since _They_ came. \n\nJust the group of you now, and from the crackled interference on the radio, it sounds like one other group holed up on the far end of the island at another resort. \n\nMaybe some locals further inland too, who knows? \n\nYou\u2019ve sent out call after call for rescue, but only recently did you finally hear a reply. It was all crackle and static, but you were able to make out something about the Coast Guard, and the Northern Island. The reef \u2019s too taxing on boats here so you\u2019ll have to make your way there. Of course that means finding a boat or swimming a quarter mile of ocean water. Not to mention navigating to the northern tip of the island and hoping the folks holed up there haven\u2019t  already taken the last boat across. The lights are flickering low. \n\nIt\u2019s time to move.\n\n---\n\nThis is an experimental game; a way for myself and a few like-minded players to test out a version of the \"Ten Candles\" RPG system by Cavalry Games adapted for use in Storium. Elements of both will be tweaked and made to suit what we're trying to do. \n\nFirst and foremost you need to understand that Ten Candles is a tragic horror game. Your character is going to die in this one. No ifs ands or buts. \n\nAs designer Stephen Dewey wrote: \n\n_\"The middle of a sunless apocalypse. The sky has darkened  and turned against you. Satellites have gone quiet, leaving  you without solar power, cell phones, internet, GPS, and many other luxuries that the world has grown accustomed to. Power grids have failed on a global scale against the demand and the world has been left in darkness. And now, They have come. It is uncertain what They are, but  They\u2019re out there in the dark, and They\u2019re coming for you.\"_\n\n_Ten Candles is not a game about \"winning\" or beating the monsters. Instead, it is a game about what happens in the dark and about those who try to survive within it. It is a game about being pushed to the brink of madness and despair, searching for hope in a hopeless world and trying to do something meaningful with your final few hours left._\n\nIf you have any inclination that you want to contradict this, or propose a way that your character can survive, don't. That's not the goal here. \n\nIf you are interested in applying I invite you to take part in the planning conversation taking place on slack at the link below:\n\n**Ten Candles-Storium Slack**\nhttps://storium-chat.slack.com/messages/CBHRE7W00\n\n---\n\nOther helpful links\n\n**Ten Candles Website**\nhttp://cavalrygames.com/ten-candles/\n\n**Google Share Files**\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1t_iLk8GUZ-lX3UcxqmccOQbaQ67FPQwp",

            "story_name": "You awoke to a silent world. \n\nEyes opened to a wide and wandering sky; scattered clouds crawled reluctantly across the vastness of blue. \n\nThe silence. \n\nTook some time to register it. \n\nNo sound. No movement. No rattling of well buckets, no cackling of hens, no slamming of doors.  \n\nSentinel had become a ghost town overnight. No horses. No dogs. No people. \n\nThe doors of the saloon in the middle of town swung open lazily, moved by the wind. Inside only darkness. The church stood mute at the end of the road, the livery and stables all empty. The hotel. The doctors office. The feed lot. The lumber yard. All abandoned. Everyone gone.\n\nWhere did everyone go?\n\nWhat happened here? How did you sleep through it, and what's coming?\n\n---\n\n_Sentinel is a storium set in a fictional wild west town of the same name in the 1840's to 1850's. Your character only recently arrived in town, and now awakens to find it deserted._ \n\n_Characters will be introduced as they wake up and begin to come to terms with what's happened in the town. There will be an investigatory element to the story, though you won't need to rigidly follow clues to understand what happened and why._\n\n_As you look about the town, you will learn what befell Sentinel. You may also find the desertion was not complete._\n\n---\n\n**Update#1**\n4/15/2020\n\nI am working on custom cards, and these will be added as options though you are of course able to select to write something different and your own.  \n\n---\n**Update#2**\n4/18/2020\n\nI added a death system which is described in the Hosts Rules section below. I also removed the option to have connected backstories as I realized that might prove problematic later on. Instead, let's keep your characters histories a little vague from one another. Don't write everything on your character sheet; lets save some for the telling. \n\nYou can read about the death system by going to the discord server and visiting the following link: https://discordapp.com/channels/613062138378059848/700834378124754975/701907421932814396\n\nIf you have already submitted a character and want to do an edit, please just request it.
