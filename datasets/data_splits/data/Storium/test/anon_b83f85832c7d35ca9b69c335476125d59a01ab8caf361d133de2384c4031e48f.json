        "story": "#The End# *Of our elaborate plans, the end Of everything that stands, the end No safety or surprise, the end I'll never look into your eyes again* Jim Morrison, The Doors --- \"Never thought about how delicate things were before, you know? Never dawned on me how fast everything could just stop. I assumed civilizations from every era of human history wrongly believed some version of the same doomsday nonsense. That things were changing too fast. That morals were slipping. That goodness was fading. That the next generation was lost. That war or disease or some other calamity would bring our end. That there was a growing corruption in the belly of the world; a malignancy that would gnaw its way through and show itself one day and rise like a wave and recede only once it had consumed everything. That the end was coming and coming soon. Hadnt every generation born since God had these doubts and thought these thoughts in some way? I really believed thats how it was. Took comfort in it. That it was all a part of the human condition. That perpetual feeling of dread over the uncertainty of the future was hard-wired into us but that ultimately the world would spin on and humanity would keep on living much as it always had. I took great comfort knowing most people had it wrong. That the world more or less had always been this way and always would be this way. But I guess we were the first civilization to have it right. About the end. THEY came. Ten days ago. They stole the light. The stars, the moon. Extinguished or obscured or destroyed. Things went black. They brought the end. There was a swell of horror and chaos. Like a crashing wave on the surf the water finally ebbed and we unlucky few who were left had to look out from where we hid at the things scattered on the beach. At what remained of the world we had lost. We're starving. Surrounded by water but dying of thirst. Afraid to light a fire to attract them. Listening. Watching. Waiting. In the darkness I feel the warmth of the world failing. The pulse of her heart slacking. She is dying. We are dying. These last pitiful stragglers, hiding in the wreckage of lives we all thought were owed us. Things taken for granted. That one day we would have a better life and better version of ourselves. What bullshit that was. The great fucking illusion. That we are owed something better. We're living proof that things can always get worse. When my little girl would have nightmares I would go to her and whisper that the sun will always rise in the morning. There is always light after the darkness. But the sun hasnt risen in ten days.\" --- The island resort has turned into a nightmare. The beach sand has turned so thick with blood that not even the tide can wash it away. There arent many folks left... not since They came. Just the group of you, and from the crackled interference on the radio, it sounds like one other group holed up on the far end of the island at another resort. Maybe some locals further inland too, who knows? Youve sent out call after call for rescue, but only recently did you finally hear a reply. It was all crackle and static, but you were able to make out something about the Coast Guard, and the Northern Island. The reef s too taxing on boats here so youll have to make your way there. Of course that means finding a boat or swimming a quarter mile of ocean water. Not to mention navigating to the northern tip of the island and hoping the folks holed up there havent already taken the last boat across. The lights are flickering low. Its time to move."

        "writing_prompt": "In the ghost town of Sentinel, abandoned and silent beneath the shadow of a great mesa, you awaken in an unfamiliar place with only fragments of memory and a few possessions. The church bells echo through the empty streets\u2014what brought you here, and what secrets does this forsaken town hold?",
        "story": "#Ghosts _It makes no difference what men think of war. War endures. As well ask men what they think of stone. War was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner. That is the way it was and will be. That way and not some other way._ Cormac McCarthy, Blood Meridian --- [Music: Deportation/Iguazu]( [Music: Alma]( --- The church stood mutely; shrouded yet in the long shadows of morning for the sun had not yet risen so high as to warm Sentinel just yet. But its light shone brilliant against the steep cliffs of the great Mesa beyond. Orange the color of burning phosphor descended slow and silent from the heights. It painted the rock and then the desert below that. Lit the world; made it glow. Lizards stalked among the rocks. Droning whir of windmill. No horse sounds. No hammer beats from the ferrier or blacksmith at his forges. No cluck of morning hens, no bray of donkeys or trundle of wagonwheels. A languid wind that withered as the sun came up. The town was empty. Abandoned. Sentinel was as improbable a place to settle as any in the southern New Mexico Territories in the 1850's. It was a desert town, with no railroad service and sat less than a days ride north of the border with Mexico. Once this had all been Apache land. It was taken by the Comanche who pushed them into northern Mexico and Texas and Arizona. Later Spaniards came and when they could not push out or defeat the natives, they sought to convert them. In consult with the Apache chiefs, the Spaniards were directed to build a Mission at the feet of a great Mesa and were guided by scouts to a site of spiritual importance. The Great Mesa. The monolith. The Sentinel. They built. But the priests didn't realize they had run afoul an Apache trick. These were Comanche lands the chiefs had instructed them to build on, and the Comanche sent a war party and they came in the night and slaughtered the priests and burned the mission. And the Comanche were emboldened by their victory and so began a campaign of incursions and depredations. For decades they raided up and down along the San Amarillas River, into northern Mexico and all along the borderlands. But from the night they scalped and bled those men of God, the Comanche had sealed their fate in the west, for they had brought the Spaniards into war with them, just as the Apache had planned and though the Comanche would expel them, they would not weather the years of strife that followed the arrival of European settlers as well. The Apache were able to return to their tribal lands and build settlements in the area again but it was not long before the Apache were once again forced from their lands, this time by the white man. The settlers built a church with a steeple over the old burned Spanish mission. New priests came. The graves of the Spaniards were buried over and their stone markers removed. That church with its bell tower stands in the Township of Sentinel still today. And it was the clang of its church bells, three rings of diminishing reverberation that woke the strangers in Sentinel that morning. That strange echo in the ears, that shudder of the ground. Above, raptors wheeled across the perfect blue of the sky and turned wide, lazy circles. Buzzards on the distant hills, a thin tendril of smoke visible behind the mesas spire. In the dusty town its streets lay bare and it's windows and doorways were haunted by expectant shadows. --- _Scene notes:_ _I've set the opening scene up so as to be a bit vague, where you each get to decide where in Sentinel your character awakens by selecting and playing a card against one of the Starting Location challenges. You all start in different locations of town, but will meet up shortly. I will trigger the event that causes the characters to meet up after everyone has had a chance to introduce their character._ _**Map**_ _See the map [here]( for more information._ _**Reference Photos**_ _View reference photos of Sentinel and the great mesa [here]( _**Starting Location Challenges** Read these carefully, though they are similar, they are not all treated equally. How you resolve the challenge not only determines how close your characters are to one another at the start, but also determines the possessions your character starts with. _ _**Asset: Possessions Cards** Make sure you read the outcome of your starting location challenge carefully as they dictate some details for what possessions you start with. You will either rewrite the asset card with a description of your belongings or you will discard the stack completely if you are starting with nothing. Please make your items narratively interesting over tactically advantageous. The Asset card is literally just meant to be your equipment list and will not actually be played in a challenge. _ _Unless it says otherwise, you will start with whatever clothing you decide your character will have. You may also have a personal weapon, a knife and/or a pistol and ammunition, some money and other minor items. Please write these in when you rewrite the card._ _**Goals**_ _The available cards are first come, first serve. You must take one of the Goal Cards available, either **You Have A Secret**, or **You Had A Bad Night**._ _I created these goals as a way to establish some early distrust between your characters. Your characters should start as uneasy strangers who decide to stick together because there's strength in numbers or because they're all in the same boat, or maybe some other reason altogether. I'll leave it to you to decide._ _In your opening post please introduce your character. Take it as far as them waking up and looking around at their surroundings. You may take some liberties on the descriptions of the locations where you wake up, but for the opening post I just want to get a glimpse at who your characters are and get you each established in the world before grouping up._ _If you have any questions at all, do not hesitate to ask here: [Link]("
