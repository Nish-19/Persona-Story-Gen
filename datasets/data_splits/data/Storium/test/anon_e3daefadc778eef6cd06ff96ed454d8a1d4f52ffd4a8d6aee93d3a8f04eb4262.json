            "story_name": " Welcome, one and all, to the UEC Ever Onward.\n\nWe guarantee this marvel of modern technology is the pinnacle of human advancement. Its sleek design shows off the greatness of humanity, as it boldly journeys where no one has gone before.\n\nFeaturing fourteen decks, the Ever Onward has state of the art facilities. It boasts ample private quarters, leisure decks, kitchens and canteens. It's medical facilities are up to date and beyond, and it's essential systems are well taken care of. We prepared to make your life as easy as possible on the longest trip Humanity has ever attempted.\n\nBelow the hood the Ever Onward has the latest in engine designs. This specialist equipment uses folding to shorten the distances between ship and destination. Combined with comfortable, efficient nuclear engines, it\u2019s the fastest ship ever made. And it sails smooth as a whistle to boot.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the Linsbridge Gravity Engine to ensure you always feel like you\u2019re at home, even away from home. Comfort is our top priority. There\u2019s no reason to feel homesick on our flight, and when you get back we\u2019ll have plenty to talk about.\n\nBut don\u2019t take our word for it, Admiral James Lightspeed is here to attest to the Ever Onward\u2019s brilliance; \u201c*To say I was impressed is an understatement. When I first saw the designs I never thought they could do it, let alone finish it in only ten years. The ship itself is the finest ship I\u2019ve ever been on, and I\u2019m looking forward to the journey.*\u201d\n\nHigh praise, do you think? We will live up to expectations. But that\u2019s enough talk from us, why not sign up today and take a look?\n\n---\n\nAn advert for the UEC Ever Onward programme\n\nThe above, or a variation of it, was on nearly every wall, TV screen, website or anywhere else with advertising.\n\nThe programme itself was for the first ever extrasolar journey conducted by humanity. The destination; an Earthlike planet five years away, making the journey a ten year round trip.\n\nThe ship itself is capable of carrying four thousand crew members. The intent was that not all would be active at any time.  A network of cryogenic freezing pods provides a rotating crew.  This avoids the complications of prolonged cryogenic freezing. \n\nAnyone could sign up, with up to ten year training programmes while the ship was in production. \n\nNow it\u2019s time to depart.",

About being yourself in a world that would rather you conform. It's about digging deep and pulling out all the stops and never giving up.\n\nIt\u2019s also a story about rival pilots clashing in spiritually charged mechs, of soldiers holding their own against unbelievable odds, and of spies and artificers building something out of nothing. \n\nIt\u2019s not a time for careful preparation or truces, it\u2019s now or never.\n\n*It\u2019s hard to change the world without taking a risk.*\n\n---\n\n>*For hundreds of years this has gone on. The Magister sits in their throne room unchallenged, while the rest of us do all the dirty work. Does that sound right to you, my family? No? So, we going to do something about it?*\n\n>*Sure we are.*\n\n>*We\u2019re going to smack them where it hurts. We\u2019re not going to sit in our homes while the magic is drained from our land, we\u2019re going to rise up and take back what\u2019s rightfully ours. We\u2019re going to take back the cutting plants, the cities, the castles and the forests.*\n\n>*And we\u2019re doing to look damn good doing it.*\n\n>*See that\u2019s our way. Damn what some bozos in big ass metal machines say, cuz I can\u2019t hear them from all the way up there. And what about when you get one? You ask, well I won\u2019t be able to hear them from all the way up there, either.*\n\n>*So go forth and kick shiny metal behinds.*\n\n>*Take a risk, break a leg.*\n\n > Iogair, hero of the rebellion.\n\nThis is the last speech given by Iogair before she went missing.
