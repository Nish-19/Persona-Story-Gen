        "story": "Welcome one and all, to the grand departure of the UEC Ever Onward. The loudspeakers blared, without any static, over the UEC exploration facility, Ontario. It hailed through hangers, over observation decks and even in the courtyard outside. It rang out over the noise of the gathering crowds of personnel and public alike. A cheer went up the moment it did, loud enough to deafen anyone who wasnt ready for it. It drowned out the next part of the speech, but that didnt make anyone any less enthusiastic. Today was the day, ten years in the making, and no one was in a bad mood. Starting at 05:00 this morning, the crew have been preparing for departure. Step one was conducting final maintenance, and step two was loading the longest lasting supplies... The spokesperson carried on. The speech was in English, but for any speaks of other languages it was available in any spoken across the world. Just like there were people across the world there. Every culture and nationality represented, one way or another. The crowds of people were impressive. They gathered in the courtyard, spilled through reception and into the viewing dome. On the hanger, beside the Ever Onward, family and friends only added to the masses. The ship itself was impressive. It sat motionless, for the moment, on its transit rail. It was ready to move out any time, when the crew finished boarding. It stood sentinel over weepy goodbyes, or the brovadosious slaps on the back. On each boarding ramp a member of the bridge crew stood ready to meet and greet their starting crew. Near the front was the Captain, looking old but intense. At the second was the chief engineer, looking nervous and out of place. At the third was the chief of medicine, looking genial and welcoming. They shook hands or said encouragement to the army of jumpsuited individuals boarding. Each carrying hand luggage ready for liftoff. --- On the inside of the ship people hurried to deposit their luggage in their room claims or to man their stations. Everyone smiled or wished each other good luck, passing by on their way. Everything was lit by orange ceiling lights and green LEDs along the floors. Each floor and wall was smooth and polished. A low hum resounded through the interior. It permeated every surface, and was louder the more decks one descended. The source was in the engine room. The generators, which started long before, powered reserve batteries and warmed up propulsion. The engineering deck was buzzing with activity. Engineering assistants rushed with clipboards or toolkits for last minute tuneups. Section leaders barked orders or talked through microbead earpieces. At the head of it all, Gio Vessacci, assistant head of engineering, stood proxy for Mattia while she was away. He was stern but fair, and he gripped the railing of his observation post with excitement. His face was lit up by the underglow of blue as the engine ready lights lit up, one after another. The very tension in his muscles reflected the mood of anticipation. --- Elsewhere on the ship, a gathering was forming in the many canteens. On the observation deck, people filled the canteen to the walls. They gathered to witness the departure from the inside. There was the bubble of casual conversation and a warm atmosphere. Someone appeared with glasses of Champaign. They moved through the crowd offering it to anyone who wanted it. The chef was hard at work in the kitchen beyond, preparing snack food and other delicacies. New people were gathering every minute. The ceremony had begun."

        "story": "#Chapter 1: Danger close ##*La Makan, 12:54 standard time* Wind whistled through the close streets of *La Makan*, stirring grains of sand with all the effect of a man attempting to blow salt through eternity. It whipped around the corners of the alleys, and rustled the banners hanging from the balconies and glassless windows. It looked for something, a thing it would never find. It carried a message on the wind, static buzzing on every word. And to each man and woman, freedom. The *voice*, smooth as velvet, boomed. But freedom, as with all things, cannot be attained without a price. So the magister, protector of us all, works to lower our price The sound originated from a pair of large speakers arranged in the town centre. They stood sentinel in front of a stage, one with its own banners and podium. The stage was built of hastily constructed wood and metal scaffolding. It looked as though it would collapse at a moments notice. Upon that stage were a unit of royal guard. They shone burnished gold in the desert sun, no doubt sweltering hot. In their middle waited Ser Cabot. Her black hair, bound in a tight ponytail, flicked out behind her. She wore an expression of boredom, clearly wanting to be anywhere but in the *backwards* town she found herself in. Yet her expression went unnoticed by the crowds who had turned out to hear the address. They gathered in the town square in their tens, the population so far reduced by relocation and poverty, and whispered among themselves. Someone detached themselves from the crowd and shuffled over to an alley. The figures movements were natural enough that no one would take notice. Hed learned that skill from years of hard work in a life where you succeed, or you dont get a second try. Lieutenant Sanje pulled his dust mask tighter around his face and risked one last cursory glance at the stage before stepping into the shadow of the building. Here three more people waited for him, each having made their own way into the ghost town. Insane. They dont question it. He said under his breath, then shook it out of his system and addressed the group. Were here. No problems, I hope? He didnt wait for the answer, and ploughed on with his instructions. They had a time limit; someone would notice, or their cover would be blown. Either way wouldnt end well for them. Our contact gave us an area, but not an address. We have, he checked his watch, five minutes until the distraction starts. We need to find them and get them out. Problem is, we dont know what they look like, only that their house is pink. He glanced over his shoulder at the multicoloured buildings. Any one of the scoured pink buildings couldve been their one. Vic, you knew Xitor the best of any of us, Im trusting you to get us there. Everyone else, let's keep our hats on, kay?"
