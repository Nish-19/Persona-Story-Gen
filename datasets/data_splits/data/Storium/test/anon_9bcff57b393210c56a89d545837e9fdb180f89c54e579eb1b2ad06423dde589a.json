Crime class C.'\n(excerpt from The Young Lawman's Dictionary of Minor Offenses, Templeton-Rhettlock Press, 3312)\n\n\n  Hephaestus Station, shining crown jewel of the Novik sector. A one-stop shop for everything everyone in the universe could need. Legal or illegal, over or under the counter, from Templeton-Rhettlock's many quality novelty goods to smuggled alien body parts, Hephaestus station caters to the whims of every space jockey, displaced dictator-in-exile, and alien time-hopper that the universe has to offer. \n\n  Those who make their living on Hephaestus Station are rare breeds, the kind of entrepreneurial spirits with surprisingly low scruples that seem to crop up anywhere there's money to be made. Whether they're out to line their pockets, bring down empires, or just get off-station; whatever names they choose for themselves, the people in Cop Sector have just one name for them- Shufflers.\n\n(Custom cards welcome)",

They said they'd be back for you. But the ships aren't coming back. \n\nThis planet is lost. Even now the stars warp overhead as something pale and sickly blots the twin moons. Even now the fog creeps in on the horizon, only visible out of the corner of your eye. Even now you sometimes see dark and terrible things moving across your vision, like pressure spots on your eyes. \n\nThis planet is lost. The ships aren't coming back.\n\nYou have only one recourse- escape. To get back to the Amalgam. Back to the fleet. Back to the ships. \n\nThere may be a way out, somewhere in the waste. There may not be. But you have to try.\n\n(C) 31,777 Laughing Lizard Games'n'Toys\n\n(Banner Photo courtesy of Wikimedia Commons).",
