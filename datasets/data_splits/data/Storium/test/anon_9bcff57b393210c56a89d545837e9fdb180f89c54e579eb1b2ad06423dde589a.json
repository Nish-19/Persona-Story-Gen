        "writing_prompt": "On Hephaestus Station, a decaying haven of opportunity orbiting a mined-out world, the arrival of a supertanker brings together a motley crew of smugglers, dockworkers, and shadowy figures. What secrets, schemes, or surprises might unfold in the chaotic dance of survival and ambition?",
        "story": "*In this dark world where he now dwelt, ugly things and surprising things and once in a long while a tiny wondrous thing spilled out at him constantly; he could count on nothing.* - Phillip K. Dick, *A Scanner Darkly* **Chapter 1: Ugly Things and Surprising Things** Watching a supertanker come in is always an incongruous sight, like a whale doing ballet. This behemoth, so ponderous and lumbering, so seemingly unable to do anything more complicated than flying straight ahead very fast, slowly turns and twists itself into exactly the right position for the docking clamps to slam down and pull it tightly into the loving embrace of Hephaestus Station. A complicated interplay of computers, cogitator arrays, RCS thrusters, and impossibly skilled pilots brought together two of the biggest objects in the Novik system in perfect union. Thats not true, actually, there were bigger objects than the *Callous Fox* in the system. The Anthem corporation had recently fielded several 7th-generation Legacy battleships, among them the impossibly vast ALV *Honoured Citadel*. But Hephaestus Station still dwarfed them all, still sat hovering over Rajaneimi like a carrion bird circling a carcass. It had not been so long ago that Rajaneimi had been the crown jewel of the Novik sector, a world so rich in mineral and chemical deposits that any sufficiently large company could drop a factorum from orbit, circle the system, and return to find a thriving mining empire. But resources deplete the same as everything else, and almost before anyone knew it, Rajaneimi was emptied out, and Hephaestus Station, formerly the home of the wealthy and powerful of the empires below, became a haven for the downtrodden, the scum, and the helpless. Somehow, though, the place never lost its sheen: it had always been the home of opportunity, but where once it had been the home of the elite, it was now a place where anyone could make their way from the bottom to the top, provided they had a casual enough attitude towards what most races called scruples. And somehow the place was all the more fantastic for that. Where once had been stodgy executives- predominantly old, human men in clean, sharp suits- there were now people of every race, species and stripe walking the catwalks and strips of Hephaestus, working its docks, hawking their wares in the market, and murdering one another in the outer levels. It had always been about freedom. But where once reigned the freedom of the rich to get richer, now Hephaestus catered to a broader range of freedoms. It was dangerous, and it was never easy, but if you could make it here- as the saying goes- you could make it anywhere. The docking bay was full of the usual suspects. As is so often the case with types like these, nobody was standing close enough to each other that they could be seen as being associated with one another. There on the catwalk is Spaulding. Spaulding is one of those people who seems to materialize out of the woodwork wherever there's money to be made, the one whom everyone knows, nobody likes, but who nonetheless maintains a significant presence in the underworld. He's scooping out the last of an avocado from its skin- that was the other odd thing about Spaulding, he seemed to have a talent for finding those items that were not contraband, but that would cost you an arm and a leg to get transported in. Fresh fruit, eggs, real coffee and tea (not the pre-ground or bagged stuff), pipe tobacco- it wasn't at all unusual to see Spaulding waltzing down the Main Drag, just polishing off a plump chicken leg or smoking an honest-to-god joint. Nobody knew how he did it, but everybody knew that he did, and he made sure of it. It wasn't even necessarily that the products would spoil. A-drives had more or less dealt with the problem of long spaceflight ('A' for 'Alcubierre' or for 'Anthem Corporation'- take your pick). It was just that they were expensive, prohibitively so, and when the credit chits come in and you have your choice of a nice plate of eggs and bacon, rent for your ResPod, or bribing someone to look the other way while you do something untoward with a lead pipe, most people will just grab whatever soy-based goop is coming out of the caf-tubes and call it a day. Suffice it to say, there were people who would happily kill their own grandmother to know how Spaulding managed it. Also in evidence is Jody Whidby, the supervisor at Dock A. Jody was that rare phenomenon on Hephaestus Station, namely, a genuinely good soul. A person who had been desperate for off-world work and had taken the only job available, and who now was simply trying to make the best of an unenviable situation. Jody's good nature was, regrettably, the thing holding her back the most, she had the steely resolve and no-nonsense attitude that makes someone valuable in any number of unsavoury lines of work, but lacked the cutthroat attitude that really made someone an upwardly mobile crook. She couldn't be bribed and she couldn't be threatened, but she was valuable to every smuggler on the station in another way- she was a known quantity. When dealing with Jody Whidby, you knew exactly where you stood. You knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that she was playing precisely by the rules. Jody Whidby was the kind of person you could plan around. And that's just scratching the surface of the scum around Dock A on Supertanker Day. There's the guy who's just a bit too big for his jacket, hand nervously hovering near the telltale bulge of a weapon under his shoulder. There's the hollow-eyed dockworker who's just there to pick up the paycheck and get home. There's the man with the cold stare and the academy badge who's harder to read than the fine print on a lawyer's contract. And there's the suit, the suit that's just a little too clean, a little too sharp, to be skulking around the docks, which makes you wonder what the story is behind the guy who's wearing it. These are the people of Hephaestus Station, and these are their stories."

        "story": "*Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep* *In the affliction of these terrible dreams* *That shake us nightly.* - William Shakespeare, *Macbeth* **Chapter One: These Terrible Dreams** The bent antenna hangs above the fort like a gallows. The drone that clipped it lies in a smouldering ruin a kilometre out. The Envan corpses littering the three clicks around the fort are by now only skeletons, the Envan survivors having stripped the flesh away as they retreated, storing it for later to reconstitute it around better, stronger, worthier bones. It has been three days since the dropships left. It has been two since the three survivors of the battle realized there would be no escape. It has been one since the girl wandered out of the desert, all ashen skin and loud, hacking cough, confirming what the Amalgam scientists had been saying for two years- Belfathan was Lost. They let her into the fort, of course, it couldn't do any harm. The Loss wasn't a thing you caught from someone else, and the Lost were still human, right up until they weren't anymore, so just as well she spend her time with someone. They'd taken her in and told her about the Loss, about the creeping grey fog that started claiming worlds five years ago, about the sickness that preceded its coming. They told her that the timing varies but that it inevitably ends in death. By silent, mutual agreement, they did not tell her what happens afterwards. They did not tell her about Enoch VI, and the towers of blackened flesh, the streets that wailed underfoot. They did not tell her about Udaroth and the acres upon acres of jungle that whispered your secrets back at you as you passed. They did not tell her about the giant, stone heads on High Vesper, and the blank, empty stares of the people who lived in their shadows. They did not tell her what was left when the fog receded. But they did tell her that there were stories of people who had somehow beaten the Loss- Duncan was the first to bring them up, but Tarn nodded his assent and even the laconic, acerbic Adhemar eventually agreed that he'd heard stories. Of course, none of them knew how it could be done. It has been half a day since the generators failed. It has been half an hour since the decision was made to leave. It was, they all agreed, the only choice. The LIDAR Arrays had stopped receiving the signatures of the Amalgam battleships almost as soon as the last dropship had vanished from view. There was no way off the planet from the fort, but even in the burned out husks of cities left by the Envan advance, there may yet be something intact enough to haul them into orbit, and from there, back to Amalgam space. Maybe. The only sensible destination is Vinath, a city a couple hours drive away. The city had a spaceport, one of the biggest on Belfathan- no telling if it's still intact, but it's a place to start. Someone needs to assess the state of the vehicles. There are two still parked near the fort. One, an APC, hunches like a beetle, all rugged metal and hard angles. The other is Tarn's DRAGON-5 skip-skiff- he hasn't had a chance to assess its state since the battle. Most of the fort is in bad shape, there's no reason to believe the vehicles will be any different. That being said, without one, they won't get far. There's also the matter of supplies- most of the fort has been picked clean, but there's enough time to go over it again. They've agreed to take one hour to get prepared, and though they've packed up all the food they can carry and even a couple of weapons, someone with good eyes may yet find something of value. It's time to load up- you have one hour. If there's to be any hope of escape, you will have to leave soon. For the Loss travels fast once its heralds arrive, and there's no telling what horrors it will leave in its wake on Belfathan. ----------------- ADHEMAR'S Status is: NORMAL DUNCAN'S Status is: NORMAL MALLORY'S Status is: LOST TARN'S Status is: NORMAL"
