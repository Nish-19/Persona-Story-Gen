        "story": ">*A figure in a bathrobe and a striped bucket hat approached an old, dusty Gramophone. It blew some of the dust away and put on a record. Lowering the needle and letting it play.* >** # The Library at the End of the Universe The Great Library, true to its name, was *big*. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it was. I mean, you may have thought it was a long way down the block to Starbucks, but that was just *peanuts* to the Great Library. Aside from books, and many many other different things, the main things that the Great Library was home to, were the Chronicle, and of course, the Librarians. The Chronicle was a special book. For one, it was bigger than all the other books, had its own lit up pedestal in the exact center of the Great Library, and most importantlyit was *blank*. Off-white, blank, pages, with not a drop of ink in sight, housed inside an ornate, glowing, golden cover. The only times that the Chronicle's pages filled with explosive, colorful illustrations, were when a *Bookworld* had strayed from its written *story* and needed a little bit of help getting back onto its true path. And the ones that the Chronicle sent into these Bookworlds were the Great Library's faithful keepers; the Librarians. However, for all of its greatness, the Great Library always seemed to be in a state of *suspension*. It was hushed and quiet for the most part, aside from any noise, or music, or cheerful shouting or the desolate sobs of the Librarians occupying it. And the air around it --unless disturbed by the Librarians-- was still. Little dust motes always seemed to hang in the air no matter which way you turned or how much you fanned them off, they always seemed to be there, glittering in the light coming from the stained glass windows. Windows, that only ever seemed to let in *two* kinds of light. Always, every day, it was either **dawn** or **dusk** in the Great Library, and never anything else. Somehow, the Librarians always knew to wake up a little before dawn, and go to bed (or pretend to go to bed, or sit and read for hours) after dusk. Speaking of the Librarians, when they weren't off traversing Bookworlds, and pretending to be great detectives, or mermaids, or princes, or super heroes, they spent the rest of their time in the Great Library. Because besides the endless, dust covered shelves, little coffee tables and red, ornate armchairs, steaming ceramic tea pots around every shelfit also had *rooms*! Many different rooms, each found as one walked around the maze of shelves for some indeterminate amount of time, until one stumbled upon the exact room that they needed. Be it a kitchen, or bedroom, or bathroom.even a play room and a gym! If a Librarian needed a certain room, the Chronicle made sure they had access to it. And in much the same way, the Great Library had sections! The Sci-Fi section of the library was a little more techy, even providing access to computers and video games, the Fantasy section had real, live trees, and flowers, and vines, along with little magical creatures that inhabited it, and so on and so forth. In all, the Great Library was an enigma. Suspended in space, housed in between times, containing an all powerful, and yet completely unassuming Chronicle.it was more than the Librarians' home. It was their *world*. And as their world, it was also their *story*. And since all stories have a beginning, this one did to. It was *dawn*."

Now, with nothing but a Nokia phone, questionable leadership, and a lot of bad luck, you must figure out how to reclaim your vessel and start your adventure.",
        "story": "# How (Not) to Start a Pirate Adventure [* Sunoco City, West Virginia, Wasteland. Sunset. You know...despite its hardships -deadly mutants trying to kill you, rival scavenger gangs trying to kill you, the Spice trying to kill you- it could be a *very* beautiful place during a sunset. The way the sun sinks beneath the horizon as you look out into the desert. The way the Spice in the air gives the orange and purple-tinted sky almost a....*magical* feeling! The mutant coyotes, somewhere in the distance, gently howling the song of their people. Sometimes, the sunset gets so peaceful and quiet that one would almost...forget...that they were in the Wasteland, where everything, even the sand itself, tries to kill you. Ah...the simple beauty in life... NOPE. **ACID RAIN.** Almost twice a year did it ever rain in West Virginia. And today was one of those days! And if you thought that rain in the Wasteland was anything like rain nearly 200 years ago, boy were you mistaken! The rain was...*acid rain*. Real...acid rain. Acid rain that if you dared to stick your naked, unprotected head under it, you were walking away without hair. And if you dared to look *up* or -Spice forbid- try to catch the *acid raindrops* onto your tongue, you're...basically walking away looking like the Joker. And where was our newly-formed, green in the gills, positively *itching* to start their pirate adventure, crew right now?? Bus stop. Thankfully the buildings, any coverings, and the bus stops, were made with lead (because *that* was safe!) to withstand the acid! So that's where the crew was. All stuffed into a smallish, lead-topped, glass-walled, graffiti'd, bus stop. Some sat on the grimy bench, others stood around or sat on the floor where the acid rain couldn't reach them. Their fearless captain, Petey Flynn, sat back, legs stretched out in front of him, on the far side of the bench. Next to his first mate, Voodood. Petey sighed and reached into his pocket, taking out a *centuries-old*, small, Nokia phone, in more or less pristine condition. He dialed a number and put it up to his ear. It picked up after a few rings. \"Heeeyyyy Genie-Bean!\", Petey crooned over the sounds of acid rain into the phone. \"Peter. Pinkie-Pie. Flynn.\", came, expectantly, from the other end of the line. And then Gina silently waited for the rest. It had only been a *week* since Petey set out on his 'Portal Gun pirate adventure', and has somehow, in one week, acquired a crew. They were set to depart *today morning*. So the fact that he was calling her could not *possibly* mean anything good. \"Soooo.....\", Petey continued after a glance over at Voodood, and then the rest of his crew,\"....we kiiiiinda....sorta.....*lost* the ship.\" \"YOU WHA--\" \"--It's okay! It's okay!\", Petey sat up, \"We *know* where it is! Or or...rather *who has it*! And it's....it's *Buster*. The Hermit Crabs took our ship. --Stole! *Stole* our ship.\" The *longest*, most drawn out sigh came from Gina's side of the line. \"Your....*pirate ship*...\", she clarified, \"....was....*pirated*...by the Hermit Crabs?\" \"Yeeahhhh. I mean if you really think about it, it was *such* a funny stor--\" **CLICK.** Petey blinked down at the phone. She hung up. He turned to rest of his crew, surprisingly *very* nonchalant about the whole thing. And gave them a shrug, sitting back once again. \"It's okay guys, she'll call back! I'm sure she's comin' up with a *plan* for us as we speak!\", he paused to look at each and every person at that bus stop, \"...Man, can you *believe* it's already been a week since we all met? Feels like *just yesterday* Dood saved me from that other time the Crabs jumped me....\" Seeming to quite literally be content with waiting for his sister to *maybe* call him back with a plan, Petey's eyes glazed over with recollection of that week during which they all met."
