You and the other Librarians call it *home*.  \n\nThe Great Library houses the *Chronicle*. A large, ornate, *blank* book, laying on a pedestal in the middle of the library. It's unassuming most of the time, but when a Bookworld needs saving and setting on its rightful path, then it fills its pages with colorful illustrations, and sends the Librarians onto their journey. \n\n##What are Bookworlds?\n\nTo put it simply, they are the worlds of books. Of famous novels, series, sagas, comics, even made-up flights of fancy! And sometimes...they run askew of their true purpose and plot. Perhaps...Sherlock Holmes, of the Arthur Conan Doyle series, *disappears*? And the Librarians will be called in to work with Dr. Watson to find him!\n\nPerhaps Alice, while sitting in the middle of the Mad Tea Party, forgets who she is and where she is? You and your fellow guardians will enter her Bookworld of 'Alice in Wonderland' and help her remember. \n\nOr Bilbo Baggins never finds the One Ring! So you all must enter Middle Earth and find it!\n\nCome! My fellow Librarians! Let us journey together, into this world of books. And make sure their true stories are told!~",
