        "writing_prompt": "In a psychiatric hospital where routine is everything, a long-term patient begins to notice subtle cracks in the facade\u2014an orderly\u2019s strange behavior, a doctor\u2019s too-perfect smile, and whispers of something hidden beneath the surface. What happens when she decides to dig deeper?",
        "story": "#Act I: Sparks It was a particularly sunny Saturday morning at Whistler-Down. Breakfast had been scrambled eggs, toast, orange juice, and oatmeal, as usual-- with the addition of bacon. Real, honest-to-God bacon that had once been part of a pig. Even Jaz had cracked a smile, though she was quick to return her black lipstick-painted lips back to their usual scowling position in case someone was looking. Araceli had caught it anyway and tried her best to hide her smirk. The only person who hadn't been happy about the menu surprise was Elsie, but that couldn't be helped. She was starting to make some progress: the day before, she'd eaten at least something at all three meals. Some of the hollowness was starting to fade from her cheeks. After breakfast, the topic of the community discussion group had been Creatively Resolving Conflicts... again. Araceli was one of the more 'permanent' residents at Whistler-Down. In the women's ward, only Grace had been around longer than she had, as far as she could tell. Grace was constantly dozing off, thanks to whatever medication they'd put her on. It was hard to get her to stay awake long enough to have a sustained conversation. Creatively Resolving Conflicts was one of the more engaging workshops, at least. The facilitator had brought in cue cards for role-playing exercises, which was always entertaining. The Saturday wasn't off to a bad start. According to the clock in the common room, it was 9:30. Araceli had to wait until 9:32 for Jim to come find her. Jim was one of the younger orderlies. He performed his duties with briskness and avoided eye contact with most patients when he did. It was apparent that whatever he'd once envisioned for his life, Whistler-Down hadn't been part of the plan. It was the usual Saturday morning for him: his eyes were watery and bloodshot, and he dragged himself through the hallways as if Grace had lent him some of her meds. \"Ara, doctor's check,\" Jim slurred. He followed her at a perfunctory distance until they reached Dr. Janus' office. His hand fumbled at the doorknob for just a moment, as if he'd misjudged the distance. Ara felt the quick glance he shot at her, baleful with the spiderweb-fissures of veins in his eyes. It didn't really matter if she noticed the slip-up-- as one of the longer-term patients and a persona non grata to the outside world, her judgments didn't count for much. But he still had the instinct to check. Jim opened the door. Dr. Benjamin Janus sat inside, the light of the sunny Saturday morning illuminating him like a muted halo. This was the most tranquil space in the entire hospital, with leather couches, soft rugs, bright cheery plants near the windows, and paintings in warm and vibrant colors. Dr. Janus looked up from his papers. \"Ara!\" he called out with a smile. \"Come on in.\" His eyes shifted to Jim. The two men shared a nod. Jim shot a sullen look at Ara before shuffling off. Ara closed the door behind her and took the patient's customary seat on the brown leather couch. On mornings past, an orderly had needed to accompany her into the office and occupied the other end of the couch. With only her and the doctor in the room, the room felt freer, as if there were more air to breathe. The psychiatrist pushed some papers to the side of his desk and turned his full attention to Ara. His smile was a little worn, and his crow's feet seemed sculpted more deeply than usual. He'd already seen a few patients today, and some of them must have given him a hard time. \"You look radiant today, Ara. Milagros tells me you've had a good week.\" It was true. Milagros, the evening shift nurse in the women's ward, would usually be the one to come to Dr. Janus' office bearing bad news about relapses, episodes, and breakdowns. Not so, this week. \"Tell me how you're feeling. How's your mood? And how's the Rozerem working out? We can always go back to Ambien if you've noticed any side-effects.\" It wasn't apparent in his smile, which despite his tiredness shone with genuine affability, but they'd had this conversation many times over the years. Ara knew his usual repertoire of questions and could guess his timing to the second. These were the usual starting questions. In a few minutes, in his usual manner of compassion coupled with professionalism, Dr. Janus would dip into the more serious questions: how were the nightmares. Had she experienced any desires to hurt herself or others. Was she experiencing thoughts of suicide. It was another Saturday."

        "writing_prompt": "When a mysterious amusement park company begins buying up land in your quiet town, you\u2019re sent to a private luncheon to hear their plans\u2014but something about their rapid expansion and secretive dealings feels far from entertaining.",
        "story": "#Act I: Earth and Water The GPS said the approximate arrival time would be 11:02 AM. Not bad, Alcippe thought, and remembered to relax her iron grip on the steering wheel. She liked being punctual. In her mind, punctuality meant showing up at least half an hour early and getting a feel for the environment and the situation before the Powers That Be appeared with their plastic smiles and slick presentations. Better to lay down the foundations of understanding herself before someone tried to shove their own biased version down her throat. \"Oh my God,\" the chipper voice in the passenger seat said, and Alcippe's fingers clamped down around the steering wheel reflexively. She had to consciously will her fingers to loosen again. The voice belonged to Cynthia Brower. Twenty-eight years old and armed with a seemingly endless wardrobe of cute yet professional work attire, Cynthia was the cheery bane of Sophono's Department of Transportation. She carried herself like the more naive interns, full of incessant cheer and helpfulness. To be fair, though, she knew how to do her job and she always came prepared. That's why Alcippe hadn't objected too strongly when Cynthia was selected to accompany her on this little venture. *On a Saturday,* her mind couldn't help but add with a touch of bitterness. Brimo Amusements, the company was called. They'd steadily bought up the land around Sophono through a series of real estate deals, some above-board, some a bit... 'mysterious,' for the past two years. Now, they had reached out to Sophono's stakeholders with an invitation to a private luncheon, where they apparently planned to divulge their proposals for land development. They'd rented conference space at the Hyatt. Alcippe wasn't sure what she should expect: a cramped, tiny boardroom full of sweaty middle-aged men in business suits? A lavish affair in the ballroom, complete with fondue fountains and ice sculptures? The ride to the Hyatt wasn't long, but Cynthia had taken the opportunity to regale Alcippe with all of the notes she'd taken on Brimo Amusements' properties and history. The eager young woman had flooded the car with a prattling series of facts and figures that never seemed to end. Cynthia was talking again. \"This Alexander Brimo guy, he owns *seven* other properties across the tri-state area. There's a-- hm, hold on. No, I don't want to buy your whiskey. *Gawd*, why do they always show you alcohol ads in everything? Do I *look* like an alchie? Hello. ...okay, right, seven properties, looks like we've got... a branch of American Amusements, a go-kart place, a... mini-golf place? Or a water park? Or water-mini-golf? I don't even know what this is-- wow. And he wants to bring this new park to *our* neighborhood. He must be a busy man.\" Cynthia laughed. No-- no, that wasn't the right word. She *tittered* like a small bird. \"Gosh. Isn't this exciting? Maybe this place will put Sophono on the map! I mean, the extra traffic from all the tourism might put some strain on our infrastructure, the hospitality industry, things like that, but. The economy. Imagine how much money could come pouring in, huh?\" Alcippe didn't need to look at the younger woman; she could hear the grin in Cynthia's voice. They still had some time before they arrived. Maybe it was worth talking shop, laying out the facts so they could present a common front at the meeting. Or maybe, she should just push Cynthia out into the road and speed off down the Thruway. At least she'd be able to enjoy a little silence on her Saturday morning before schmoozing time."

        "writing_prompt": "At his grandfather's wake, Daniel is confronted not only by grief but by the cold, sharp edge of his grandmother's words\u2014a reminder of the years and secrets that have kept them apart. What unspoken truths linger in the air, waiting to surface?",
        "story": "#Act I: A Handful of Dust Daniel came early to the wake. The funeral home's parking lot was mainly empty, except for a small scattering of vehicles. Two were parked in the spaces closest to the back door, likely the designated spots of the funeral home staff. There were three or four other cars he didn't recognize, and one that he did: a 1998 Toyota Camry, the \"Torture Is a Moral Issue\" bumper sticker still plastered to the back, faded but stubbornly legible. His grandparents hadn't exactly adjusted well to change, as long as he'd known them. He had been sitting in the car for ten minutes. Something kept him in the driver's seat, staring through the windshield at the trees lining the parking lot. It was a sunny Saturday morning, and the leaves made gold-green kaleidoscopes on the sidewalk. The manicured shrubs hinted that a loving hand had directed the landscaping here. The inside would probably be like that, too: extravagant bouquets of flowers, carefully color-coordinated curtains, neat arrangements of chairs, memorial wreaths, photo collages, sympathy cards, guestbooks. The dead body itself, sculpted with formaldehyde, plaster, mortician's makeup, bathed and stuffed and hooked and shaped. They might as well rig it with animatronics and sell it to Universal Studios. Daniel rubbed his eyes and sighed. It wasn't right to think this way about his grandfather, but discomfort lodged in his esophagus, made him want to sulk and tell terrible jokes about the Holocaust and dead babies, made him stay in the car when he knew his grandma was inside and probably needed him. Lung cancer, for God's sake. Eighty-nine years, most of them spent working for the IRS or dodging Japanese bullets in the Pacific theater during World War II, and it was the Marlboros that finally closed out his accounts. Still. As Daniel knew, there were far worse ways to go. In a moment of decision, he jerked himself out of the car, locked up, and walked through the door of Rosenberg Funeral Home. The walls were softly lit and lined with grandmother-pink wallpaper. *Maternal* was the word for it. Daniel looked around the empty hallways. Nothing but chairs lined up outside walls and open doors to empty rooms. He chose a direction, turned the corner, and saw his grandmother standing with her hands clasped to her chest. She was speaking with a tall man who had sympathetic eyes and a crown of wispy white hair surrounding an oddly reflective bald spot. Grandma's eyes wandered, found his, and she stopped. So did Daniel. For a moment, they stood and looked at each other. How many years had it been? She seemed to wonder the same thing. Her eyes were more tired than he remembered. He saw the light of recognition dawning in them, and she unclasped her hands and opened her arms. \"Daniel. Oh. Daniel. You made it here.\" \"Grandma.\" Daniel closed the distance and wrapped his arms around her shoulders. It felt like hugging a baby bird. Grandma ended the hug and looked up at him with her palms against his shoulders. She was smiling, but her eyes had a certain flatness. Was it a hint of anger? \"It's good to have you here, Daniel.\" The tall man shuffled his weight slightly, and Grandma backed away to include him in their confidence. \"Daniel, this is Arthur. He owns the funeral home here.\" \"Pleased to meet you, Daniel,\" Arthur said, turning his kind eyes on Daniel and extending his hand to shake. \"Your grandfather was a friend of mine, going a long way back. I'm happy to do anything I can for the Spanners.\" \"Thank you,\" Daniel said. His mind had chilled a bit after seeing the look in Grandma's eyes, and automatic politeness came out of his mouth. \"I appreciate that.\" Arthur smiled. \"Well, I know you've come quite a ways to get here. I'm sure you'd like some privacy, before the guests arrive for the viewing. If you need me,\" he said, inclining his head toward Grandma almost as if bowing, \"I'll be in my office.\" \"Bless your heart, Arthur,\" Grandma said. \"You've been so kind.\" Arthur left them in the hallway, and Grandma watched him for a few moments. When he disappeared from sight, she sighed and her shoulders seemed to sag. \"It's good to see you,\" she said. \"It's good to see you, too,\" Daniel said. She looked at him, and there was a cold spark in her eyes, even through the grief and exhaustion of the past few days' arrangements. \"It's been a long time, Daniel.\" An edge had crept into her voice, and it hung in the air between them."

        "writing_prompt": "Summoned to the Master's council room after supper, a group of Templar knights\u2014each harboring their own secrets\u2014find themselves gathered before three locked chests and a blazing fire. What mission, judgment, or revelation awaits them in the flickering light of the Master's arrival?",
        "story": "Brother Tancred cleared his throat. Long moments had passed since either of the two men in the room had broken the silence. Hearing it broken, Master Galien, preceptor of Fort Latronis, raised his head as if carrying a great weight. \"Speak your mind, brother.\" The long years of the Master's service manifested in his voice, a thing dried and hardened by this country-- its merciless sun, its turmoil a test of both body and soul. The commandery chaplain took a step forward. \"Master-- I would counsel against the abandonment of our great task. With honor and fitting dedication, you have sought this thing for over twenty years of your life. Would you abandon the Lord's work now, in what is possibly the hour of its completion?\" \"The Lord understands the value of men, brother. And we have too few.\" \"Spare a few more, to finish the work at last. A handful, well-armed but swift, to seek what they can and return within the week. If not to find the weapon, then to investigate the manner of our brothers' deaths. Surely we will not leave our brothers of the Temple unmarked and unmourned.\" The Master stared into the fire that illuminated the barren stone walls of the council room. When he spoke again, there was a quiet in his voice that no other man in the fortress had been allowed to hear. \"How many more Christian souls will go to the gates of heaven at my behest? How many names of Temple brothers will Saint Peter record in his book-- before our work is finished?\" \"Salvation through sacrifice-- it has ever been the way of the Lord,\" the priest answered. \"The blood of the few will preserve the blood of the many, just as the blood of the Son saved his flock. It is the Lord's work that we do, and have the courage to do. And difficult as the path may be, at the end of it lies the redemption of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\" The rhythm of the conversation was familiar to both men. It was the master's role to doubt, and the priest's duty to reassure. \"Thanks be to God.\" Master Galien turned and met the priest's eyes. \"I will send my summons. After supper. Best if they leave tonight.\" The priest nodded. \"By your will.\" \"By His,\" Master Galien said. There was a pause, and then the door closed behind him. --- One by one, Master Galien's servant, Bertrand, found them all: some tending to their horses, some after they left the divine offices of Nones or, later, Vespers. By suppertime, each of the chosen knights had received Master Galien's summons. They were to proceed to the Master's council room immediately after supper, for reasons that Bertrand did not explain, or appear to know. Some of them were not terribly bothered. Three pilgrims currently occupied the lodgings set aside for that purpose; likely they had concluded their penances and required an escort back to the main road. Some of them harbored darker suspicions, though. Secrets did not sit easily in the communal life of the Templars, and some among them harbored secrets they did not care to divulge. Could it be that they had been found out? The Gospel reading at supper, delivered as always by Brother Tancred, was recognizable to the educated among them as the temptation of Jesus in the desert and the calling of the Apostle Peter. Those who had not learned Latin still recognized the oft-cited words: *Poenitentiam agite: appropinquavit enim regnum caelorum.* Do penance: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. At supper's end, they made their way to the Master's council room, down a windowless corridor that led mostly to storage vaults. The door had been left open, revealing sparse furnishings: a long, plain table with wooden benches-- a fireplace in which someone had prepared a steady blaze prior to their arrival-- a stone relief of the Order's emblem, two knights riding a single horse, adorning the wall-- and three chests set against the far wall. Each chest bore the privileged device to which none of them were entitled: a lock. None of \"them\"? It appeared that the summons given to each man had gone to others as well. Who was the Master gathering here-- allies, accusers? To what purpose? And how were they to conduct themselves as they awaited his arrival?"
