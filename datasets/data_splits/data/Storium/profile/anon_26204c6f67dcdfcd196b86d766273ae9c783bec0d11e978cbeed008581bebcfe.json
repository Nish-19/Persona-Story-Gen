            "story_name": "*Nature is a haunted house \u2014 but Art \u2014 is a house that tries to be haunted.*\n\n\u2013 Emily Dickinson\n\nAt 7 AM, the orderlies at Whistler-Down Center for Personal Growth make their rounds for morning checkup. The day begins with the comforting routine of breakfast in the cafeteria (eggs, orange juice, and cereal again, plus a brownish liquid that some folks have the audacity to call \u2018coffee\u2019) and the assurance that no one has committed suicide overnight. \n\n\nAraceli, or whatever her real name is, has woken up at 7 AM for\u2014well, a number of years. It\u2019s hard to remember an exact number. She\u2019s pretty certain that the number stands at three, at least. Four, *maybe.* At the last place, it was 6:30.\n\n\nWhistler-Down isn\u2019t so bad, and by now, Araceli is practically a connoisseur. There have been worse places, drearier ones, other places where it felt as if even the walls were angry: peeling paint, four or more patients crowded into rooms meant for two, nurses who looked at the patients as if calculating the precise dollar amount they were receiving for handling each individual request. One facility was better, the one with free WiFi and a yoga studio. That was years ago\u2014 five, or ten. Life in a mental hospital doesn\u2019t have seasons. It is always fluorescent lights and temperature-controlled tile hallways.\n\n\nDespite the passage of the years, Araceli tries her best to remember the truth: she doesn\u2019t belong here, not really. She just\u2026 knows things, sometimes, that haven\u2019t happened yet. She had tried to warn her family, back in the other lifetime when there were things like seasons and the outside. That\u2019s what landed her here in the first place, and all the other psychiatric hospitals, mental health centers, and residential programs. She knew things that she had no right to know and talked to entities she had no right to perceive. \n\t\n\nShe heard that her family held a funeral for her years ago. She wonders who gave the eulogy and if it was any good. Maybe that\u2019s why these\u2026 voices seek her out now: as far as her family is concerned, she\u2019s already dead and buried. She might as well be on the Otherside.\n\t\n\nThe human mind can break in so many ways\u2014in huge fissures like the scars carved into the earth by earthquakes, or in mosaic-shards of color fanned out like the feathers of mallard ducks.\n\n\n\nAraceli is stuck here in the treatment center, with shards of broken minds and snatches of lost souls caught wandering through the worlds with nothing to light their way. \n\n\n\nThe voices have started whispering about a change. Outwardly, the world of Whistler-Down is the same safe, antiseptic environment: the orderlies still come around at 7 AM. On the Otherside, though, underneath and within the meticulously cleaned tiles, something is coming. Something much bigger than anything Araceli has seen before.\n\n(Part of The Veil Is Tearing.

Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.*\n\n\n--Italo Calvino, *Invisible Cities*\n\n\n\n\nAt this point in her life, Alcippe has mostly finished with questions. Instead, people feel free to direct their (presumptuous, unwelcome) questions at her.\n\n\n*Well, it\u2019s lovely that your career is going so well, but what else do you have going on in your life right now?

There are still nights when she comes home to her otherwise empty apartment, and she can look outside the window at the ordered grids of streetlights and highway traffic and feel full inside. Sometimes, it feels like enough.\n\n\nIncreasingly, she comes home to a bottle of wine, maybe a trashy novel, and a hollowness that gnaws at her from somewhere in her esophagus. She catches herself daydreaming about getting into fights with faceless strangers, or packing a bag and escaping to another place, somewhere far away and unimaginable, like the surreal cityscapes that she sometimes paints.\n\t\n\nAfter years of service to the Department of Transportation, questions are starting to enter Alcippe\u2019s mind again. \n\n\nHas she given enough, yet? Can she rest now?\n\n(Part of The Veil Is Tearing. Communal game here: https://storium.com/game/the-veil-is-tearing-communal)",

He tried to explain this, once, in a fit of drunken despair. It was after 2 AM, which would have been his first clue if he hadn't been a dumb college kid distracted by assignments and the occasional inexplicable happening. Happenings like his blackouts, or the Word documents that appeared every now and then on his laptop, rambling tidbits of philosophy that he couldn't remember writing. He turned to someone who seemed to be equally out of his mind on Jager bombs and who knows what else, and told him about the demon who lived inside his head. Daniel could always feel it, grinning, grumbling, or simply using his eyes to peer out at the living world. Even when it slept, he could almost feel the dull thrum of its snoring.\n\nThe wasted kid said he would totally see the movie that Daniel was making, once the screenplay was finished. Then he spent the next twenty minutes in a locked bathroom stall. \n\nDaniel had had another blackout that night, though he couldn't tell if it was from the demon or the alcohol. A few days later, he heard that the wasted kid had been checked into an in-patient rehabilitation clinic. Something about a drug-induced psychotic break. Poor bastard.\n\nThese days, Daniel saves his heart-to-hearts for his charges: the mad ones, the men (and they are usually men) with the locations of bodies locked inside fractured minds. It's possible that he hopes to find someone who shares his *unique condition.* It's also possible that he's simply most at home among the mad and the dead.\n\nSo, Daniel doesn't have many people he can turn to when he starts to hear whispers of other voices. There's a storm brewing in the spaces between this reality and the next. Even the demon is ill at ease, jittering somewhere in the recesses of Daniel's mind. \n\nWith his (or the demon's?) abilities, Daniel is in a unique position to deal with the coming darkness. Kant would call it a moral imperative. \n\nTo the demon, 'opportunity' is the better word.\n\n(Part of The Veil Is Tearing.

He who strikes a blow to rescue the Holy Sepulchre from the pollution of the unbelievers has thrown open the door of heaven for himself.\"\n-Peter the Hermit\n\nIt is the year 1171, between the Second and Third Crusades. Nearly a hundred years have passed since Pope Urban called for holy war at Clermont and the gathered crowds responded: \"God wills it!\"  The Western residents of the Crusader states have managed to establish stable settlements throughout the length of the Levant, though raids by local mountain tribes and the Seljuqs to the East continue to threaten pilgrims to the Holy Land. To the south, the last Fatimid caliph has fallen to the new Sultan of Egypt: Saladin. King Amalric has journeyed to Constantinople to request Byzantium's help against the increasingly united forces of the Saracens, but no help is coming. Already, Saladin's forces have begun to claim territory in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. \n\nEven here, thirty miles north of the Sea of Galilee, the news is clear: war will come again to the Holy Land. \n\nAtop the summit of a rocky mountain, a hard day's journey east from the major roads that run south to Jerusalem, the modest fortress of Domus Boni Latronis stands near the frontier of Crusader territory. Allegedly, it marks the birthplace of the Good Thief, who was crucified alongside Jesus but repented before his death. Now, it is a lesser-known pilgrimage site for desperate sinners seeking redemption as well as the headquarters of a small garrison of Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, known to most as the Templars.\n\nFort Latronis seems an odd place to house a squadron of Christendom's elite warriors in these uncertain times. The frontier is a dangerous place, and the Templars are dedicated to the protection of pilgrims, certainly... but the site is so obscure, its location so isolated. The Templars' vows of obedience discourage active questioning of their leaders, so they continue their daily routines of praying, escorting pilgrims, and maintaining their readiness to battle the Saracens.\n\nIt will soon become clear that there is something older and far more malevolent  in these mountains than Mohammedans. Something that the Order hopes to harness as a weapon in the war for the Holy Land-- if it does not destroy them all, Christian and Saracen alike.\n\n---\n\nFor more information on character creation, visit the forum thread in Looking for Players: https://storium.com/forums#/category/lfp/thread/h4rtq8",
