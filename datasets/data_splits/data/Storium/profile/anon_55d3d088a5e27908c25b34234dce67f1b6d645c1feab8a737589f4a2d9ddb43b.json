At night  the sky is navy blue, most of the day it is purple and around noon it is pink.  Vents pump out breathable warmed air - engineering and barriers recirculate air at ground level for as long as possible to assist the thin natural atmosphere in retaining it.  Due to the difficulty in maintaining air quality away from the centre, the price of land is at a premium.\n\nIt is 3037, and Ludwig is President in Andertenna.\nIt was the 82nd Century, in the Sigma system, and James wants to head back to the 31st Century, Sigma 19, to track down some old...associates...",
