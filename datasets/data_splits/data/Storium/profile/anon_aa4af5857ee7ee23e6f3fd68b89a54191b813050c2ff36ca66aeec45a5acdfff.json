        "story": "It was raining when they buried Nick, but youd be hard-pressed to find a day in Belgaerd when it wasnt raining. You got used to itor you didnt, and you went crazy. It was an easy town to go crazy in; to go crazy for. Detective Nick L. Dime found that out in the moments before he died. In the moments after he did what every person hopes theyd do, given a similarly piss poor hand of cards. Jorgin was gonna miss the kid. The gruff, old dwarf had high hopes for him, back when they met. Young, but smart, with a good nose for sussing out the whys and wherefores, and a keen mind for the magic. Too good, as it turned out. Hed have made a damn fine detective, words Jorgin was glad he could offer to his folks in complete honesty. Kid even managed to close that first case. Just a shame that it closed him, too. Yeah, hed miss him, but it wasnt the first partner Jorgin had buried. Not likely to be the last, either. Belgaerd had no end to her appetite, would happily grind up and swallow the next sucker offered up to her, like some kind of chthonic goddess gobbling up sacrificial lambs with wanton abandon. In fact, that was probably a more apt description than hed care to admit. It was a hungry city, alright; and a city of hunger. Want, want, want. Right now, Jorgin wanted a drink. Belgaerd never quite went full prohibition, like her neighbors, but there were limits on the kind of elixir he could partake of. He had a thirst for the real hard stuff at the moment, and he had a flask of it waiting for him in his pocket. Almost didnt care who saw; almost did it just to see if he could start a fight out of it. But no, kids folks were still here, kids sister still bawling up a storm to rival gloomy clouds overhead. He turned to leave, but found his way blocked by Bart. Sergeant Bartholomew Dunn was the only person in the City Guard more curmudgeonly and disagreeable than Jorgin. Also the only one as experienced. The satyr had been doing this work since there was work to be done, and had approximately as positive an outlook on it as Jorgin. As a result, they tended to get along spectacularly, grumbling and complaining about the same dragon-sized piles of crap set before them. Bart probably shouldve been Captain of the Guard a couple decades ago, butas the jokes goesnobody on the City Council could stand the clacking of his hooves on marble floors. So instead, Bart got all the rough cases. Which meant Jorgin got all the roughest of the rough. Right now, Bart had that look on his face that meant Jorgin wasnt going to get that drink. Not just yet, anyway. Where? he asked. Bart didnt answer right away. He stamped the ground and fiddled with his ludicrously long goatee, staring out over the end of Nicks funerary proceedings. Satyrs grew beards like billy goats, but it was terrible idea to poke fun of it. This one got to you, he said. Didnt he. It wasnt stated as a question, so Jorgin didnt answer. Not until Bart fixed him with a steady, steely stare. If you need time off, you can have it. Youre due. He snorted. Youre always hexing due."

        "story": "Kumiko watched on her monitors as everything went straight to hell. There were multiple breaches in her systems. It seemed someone had infiltrated through every known form of physical security and gotten direct access to her network. Her *real* network, not one of the dupes or paltry business nets, and was causing merry chaos with the electronics all over her state-of-the-art citadel. No, not state-of-the-art. *Beyond* state-of-the-art. There were marvels of innovation and technological mastery that hadnt even been dreamed of in most quarters, her own proprietary designs known to a scant few, but here some mystery hacker had invaded them without physical access, without a signal, without even a *program* to interface with. *A ghost in the machine.* But her physical security was suffering, too. With cameras fritzing and automated turrets stuttering, targeting each other, and doors randomly opening and closing, the most formidable of her defenses were lasciviously spreading their legs to the two men casually wrecking their way through basement, and subbasement, and sub-subbasement Heading directly for her vault. She had security personnel, of course. Robots, chiefly, but a few biological personnel that shed considered a necessary precaution in an age of super hackers, electrically charged do-gooders, and technologically potent aliens. Unfortunately, the ex-hero whipping fire like it was going out of style was handling them quite well, even if he hadnt the support of the other man behind him. That other man looked suspiciously like one of her rivals chief operatives, though of course it was difficult to say for certain, what with the all-black, face-obscuring outfit. Still, well-known operatives had a certain style about them, a costume if you will, and this fit the bill. Yes, it was definitely a very well-coordinated strike deep into the heart of her power, and there was very little Kumiko could do about it, even with all her resources and wild intelligence. Exactly as shed planned. --- The thing about being, in essence, a poltergeist was that it afforded a whole new playing field to operate on. Lea had been given very specific instructions about where and how to strike Kumikos defenses and what electronics to wreak havoc with, a thing Lea had a remarkable amount of experience in disrupting--mostly whenever it seemed most likely to ruin her haunted murderers day. But though Regis had an impressive setup of his own, it really didnt compare to a top-of-the-line, professional operation like this. There were fascinating intricacies to the Kurosawa systems, layers of redundancies and firewalls (almost literal in her plane of battle), and aggressive countermeasures. Right. Countermeasures. It struck Lea, immersed in playing poltergeist with a truly enormous haunted house, that Kumiko hadnt really gone into a great degree of detail about *those.* Lea had learned the hard way that so-called black intrusion countermeasures (or ICE) could apparently be blended with mystical elements to create what amounted to spiritual defenders of a completely electronic creation. At least, thats what shed managed to deduce from what little shed overheard during the briefing, and the fact that she was being actively hunted by very angry, very tangible programs. With teeth. How did they even *get* teeth? Still, there was a job to do, and a pressing need to not find out what those teeth could actually do to her. It shouldnt be much longer before the others could break through --- Another door flew from its frame, crashing into the room beyond. Kieran and the operative behind him stepped over the wreckage of robots and guards knocked cold to survey the next hallway impeding their route to the vault. The automated defenses seemed non-functional here, which meant their sort-of-hacker was doing her job, but there was likely to be another wave of physical defenses at any moment. The very best of Kurosawa Robotics would be headed their way--black ops cybernetic soldiers, killbots, and who knows what else? Well, *they* knew. Kumiko herself had prepped them with full schematics of her most prized creations, recently stolen from one of her datacenters, apparently by a rival. And to some extent that was true but the secrets had found their way to them, as well. All the weaknesses, weaponry, tricks and exploits. Of course, it was still no picnic. Kumiko knew her trade, and she needed this to look good. There was a reason nobody had ever tried this before and succeeded. But there was a first time for everything. Of course, there was a last time for everything, too. The sound of machinery thundered from around a bend in the corridor..."

        "writing_prompt": "A cryptic telegram from an old acquaintance draws you to a meeting at the Chelsea Hotel, where a group of strangers with tangled pasts and hidden motives gathers. What secrets lie behind the invitation, and what dark truths will you uncover together?",
        "story": "#Jackson Elias ##January 15th, 1925 - New York City, NY >*The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.* &nbsp; -Found among the papers of the late Francis Wayland Thurston, of Boston --- ***Harry, Jeremy, Ruth, Walter-*** The telegram had been terse, but it carried two important pieces of information: Firstly, that Jackson had information--*new* information--about the Carlyle Expedition. The lure of such a claim was obvious; the Expedition had been news simply for happening, and its importance only grew as the tale unfolded. Even years later, if someone could uncover what had happened...fame, credit, and certainly fortune followed. Jackson could hardly be blamed for wanting to pursue it. Hed certainly pursued more cryptic leads for lesser promise of reward--though it was curious. Jackson was *notoriously* secretive about his previous projects while they were underway. What could drive him to break his silence now? The second piece of information was that hed said he needed an investigative *team.* And yet, there had been no instructions to gather associates or reach out to a contact. The conclusion was simple: Jackson had already reached out to others. An expedition of his own, perhaps. There was some time between receipt of Jacksons telegram and the date of the meeting. Plenty of opportunity for a bit of preparation--ensuring affairs were in order for travel, preparing probable gear, but most importantly, brushing up on the Carlyle Expedition itself. Not a difficult task. Any worthwhile periodical--and many of the more salacious rags--ran stories on the Expedition while it had occurred. It simply took a bit of perusal and perhaps a phone call or three to the right people to turn up archival copies. BIG APPLE DATELINE April 4, 1919--ROGER CARLYLE, the playboy whom everybody knows--or knows about--is quietly leaving New Yawk tomorrow to check out the tombs of Egypt! Youve seen the cuties ROGER has found in the nightspots. Who can doubt hell dig up someone--er, something--equally fabulous from the Egyptian sands? --- CARLYLE EXPEDITION EMBARKS FOR ENGLAND April 5, 1919--Led by the fabulously wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle, the Carlyle Expedition departed this morning for Southampton aboard the crack British steamship Imperial Standard. Contrary to earlier reports, the expedition will perform researches in London under the auspices of the Penhew Foundation before continuing to Egypt next month. Readers may recall the enormous party which Mr. Carlyle, now 24, gave at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel upon reaching his majority. Since then, scandals and indelicate behavior have become Carlyles trademark, but he never has become tarnished in the eyes of Manhattanites. Members of the expedition have been reluctant to reveal their purpose in Egypt. OTHER EXPEDITION MEMBERS--Renowned Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew is assistant leader of the team, and in charge of excavations. Dr. Robert Huston, a fashionable Freudian psychologist, accompanies the expedition to pursue parallel researches into ancient pictographs. Miss Hypatia Masters, linked in the past to Carlyle, will act as photographer and archivist. Mr. Jack Brady, intimate to Mr. Carlyle, accompanies the group as general factotum. Additional members may be secured while in London. --- CARLYLE DEPARTS EGYPT July 3, 1919--CAIRO (AP)--Sir Aubrey Penhew, temporary spokesman for the Carlyle Expedition, indicated Monday that the leaders are taking ship to East Africa for a well-earned rest. Sir Aubrey debunked rumors that the expedition had discovered clues to the legendary wealth of the lost mines of King Solomon, maintaining that the party was going on safari in respite from our sandy labors. Roger Carlyle, wealthy New York leader of the expedition, was unavailable for comment, still suffering from his recent sunstroke. Discussing that unfortunate incident, local experts declared Egypt entirely too hot for Anglo-Saxons at this time of year, and suggested that the young American had not been well-served by his democratic enthusiasm, rumored to have led him to personally wield pick and shovel. --- IMPORTANT VISITORS July 24, 1919--MOMBASA (Reuters)--Leading members of an American archaeological expedition arrived here on holiday from digs in Egypts Nile Valley. Our Under-Secretary, Mr. Royston Whittingdon, held a welcoming dinner for them at Collingswood House, where the wit of Sir Aubrey Penhew, expedition co-leader, was much in evidence. Accompanying Sir Aubrey are two Americans, youthful financier Roger Carlyle and medical doctor Robert Huston. The party leaves inland tomorrow, for Nairobi and hunting. --- CARLYLE EXPEDITION FEARED LOST Oct. 15, 1919--MOMBASA (Reuters)--Uplands police representatives today asked for public assistance concerning the disappearance of the Carlyle Expedition. No word of the party has been received in nearly two months. The group includes wealthy playboy Roger Carlyle and three other American citizens, as well as respected Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew of the United Kingdom. The expedition left Nairobi on August 3, ostensibly on camera safari, but rumor insisted that they actually were after legendary Biblical treasures. Carlyle and his party reportedly intended to explore portions of the Great Rift Valley, to the northwest of Nairobi. --- ERICA CARLYLE ARRIVES IN AFRICA March 11, 1920--MOMBASA (Reuters)--In response to clues, Miss Erica Carlyle, sister to the American leader of the lost Carlyle Expedition, arrived in port today aboard the Egyptian vessel Fount of Life. Several Kikuyu-villager reports recently have been received concerning the putative massacre of unnamed whites near Aberdare Forest. Miss Carlyle declared her intention to find her brother, regardless of the effort needed. She brought with her the nucleus of a large expedition. Detailing agents to coordinate supply and other activities with Colony representatives, Miss Carlyle and the remainder of her party depart for Nairobi tomorrow. Her companion, Mrs. Victoria Post, indirectly emphasized Miss Carlyles purposefulness by recounting the rigors of the voyage aboard the Semite ship. --- CARLYLE MASSACRE CONFIRMED May 24, 1920--NAIROBI (Reuters)--The massacre of the long-missing Carlyle expedition was confirmed today by district police representatives. Roger Carlyle, New Yorks rollicking playboy, is counted among the missing. Authorities blame hostile Nandi tribesmen for the shocking murders. Remains of at least two dozen expedition members and bearers are thought found in several concealed grave sites. Erica Carlyle, Roger Carlyles sister and apparent heiress to the Carlyle family fortune, led the dangerous search for her brother and his party. She credited Kikuyu tribesmen for the discovery, though police actually found the site. Among other expedition members believed lost are Sir Aubrey Penhew, noted Egyptologist; New York socialite Hypatia Masters, and Dr. Robert Huston. Many bearers also are reported dead. --- MURDERERS HANGED June 19. 1920--NAIROBI (Reuters)--Five Nandi tribesmen, convicted ringleaders of the vicious Carlyle Expedition massacre, were executed this morning after a short, expertly-conducted trial. To the end, the tribesmen steadfastly refused to reveal where they had hidden the bodies of the white leaders of the expedition. Mr. Harvis, acting for the Colony, cleverly implied throughout the trial that the massacre was racial in motivation, and that the fair-skinned victims were taken to a secret location, there to suffer the most savage treatment. Miss Erica Carlyle, defeated in her efforts to rescue her brother, left several weeks ago, but is surely comforted now by the triumph of justice. --- And so, armed with this bit of foreknowledge and any other preparations, the only thing left to do was to wait. Sure enough, on January 15th, Jackson phoned each member of his would-be investigative team: 8 p.m. at the Chelsea Hotel, Room 410. But the conversation was curt and uninformative; not even *cordial.* Jackson was brusque and nervous, very unlike himself; something was amiss. The man wouldnt say what, though; he begged off all further discussion until the meeting, when he could tell it all once, for all to hear. --- ***Shane-*** Shane received the letter late last year, long before the telegram reached him. It was simple, but eloquent, in Jacksons precise hand--the same Shane had seen in his fathers correspondences, perhaps as often as hed seen the man himself. Much like Jackson, Shanes father had always been gallivanting across the globe on some adventure or another, hunting down anything that had the slightest whiff of the occult. Hed come back all too briefly, speaking endlessly of the wonder he uncovered, and then, scarcely before hed finished the telling of his latest escapade hed be off again, for months at a time, pursuing the next. And so it went: out abroad, giving only letters of his progress; then back home for a fleeting time. Then out, and back, and out, and on, and on Until he *didnt* come back. It had been years now since Shane had heard from his father. He was presumed dead, of course; theyd even held a farce of a funeral with an empty casket, his mother a bawling wreck the whole time. Elias hadnt even appeared for the funeral; hed been too busy researching his next book. He sent his condolences, of course--as did all the other wayward vagabonds who formed his fathers boys club of neer-do-well adventurers. And that had been the last theyd heard from Jackson or any of the others. Until now. The request was simple; straightforward. Jackson wanted his fathers Australia notes, the letter said. He offered to pay for them, and share credit in any discovery that might result. Generous terms, really--not that Shane or his mother needed the money. His father mightve been negligent, but he never failed to provide in funds. Still, credit. That might be worth something. Better still, if it was related to work his father had been doing, perhaps Jackson could provide some clue as to what *happened* to him. Perhaps hed learned something. His father had been heading to Australia--or so he claimed. The notes were painstakingly crafted copies, backups in case something were lost in the field. His father hadnt expected to lose himself, but perhaps...perhaps he could be found. Whatever his condition. Dead. Surely, dead. He couldnt be alive after all this time...could he? Damn it all. When Jackson called on the 15th, Shane found himself agreeing to be there. It was just as well that the author hung up quickly. --- ***Andrew-*** Andrew knew by now that listening to the voices this time may have been a mistake. Theyd told him things before, impossible things--sometimes useful things. But boarding the freighter Hed barely even penned a note for Elizabeth before he slipped away. Surely hed be back, though. She would have to understand when he explained it to her properly. If he could explain it. The voices told him about the man hed followed, too. Jackson Elias. An author, and though Andrew had never read his books, their names were whispered hauntingly in his head anyway: *Skulls Along the River. Masters of the Black Arts. The Way of Terror. The Smoking Heart. Sons of Death. Witch Cults of England. The Black Power.* Charming titles, really. Whatever he tried, though, Andrew couldnt catch the man alone to speak with him. Andrew had managed to pay enough and offer a hand to help in order to board, but Elias had secured passage some other way. Friend of the captain, perhaps. This the voices said nothing about. But it was clear that Elias wanted to keep to himself and speak with as few people as possible. When they landed, Andrew lost him again. Andrew wandered, for a time; there was trouble, briefly. But a reasonably respectable British man abroad in America had little to fear, and soon the voices gave him what he needed: Chelsea. Not a name, but a place. *Eight arrive at eight. Be there. Meet them,* the womans voice implored. *Watch them,* the mans voice countered. The whispers trailed off. --- ***Elizabeth-*** It had felt wrong to hire that private investigator, but just now, Elizabeth was proving herself wise for having done so. *New York!* Just what was Andrew thinking? At least it was on a slow-moving freighter. Shed have ample time to settle affairs *properly* before pursuing him across the Atlantic. Elizabeth didnt much fancy the cost of a passenger ticket, but there werent many other options available. Well. She could let him go, she supposed. *If she were mad.* Her investigator had a colleague in New York, and Elizabeth enlisted the mans services to watch for Andrews arrival. Unfortunately, upon her arrival, Elizabeth learned of certain setbacks in that regard. Andrew had been difficult to track; unexpectedly so. But eventually the investigator did find him--apparently hed been picked up by the police while wandering Harlem in the middle of the night. Theyd released him soon enough, but it had left enough of an impression that word had reached the investigator. Which meant it had reached Elizabeth. Her latest piece of information was that he was enroute to the Chelsea Hotel for God knows what. It didnt matter. This time, Elizabeth would catch him, face-to-face, and get to the bottom of his aberrant behavior. She paid the investigator and dismissed him, and resolved to handle this meeting on her own. --- ***Goldie-*** Harry thought he could give her the slip. Well, not this time. Goldie couldnt just let the mook skate out on his debts. Word would get around. That would be bad for business. A couple of the boys tailed him to some ritzy joint, the Chelsea. No kind of place for the likes of Harry, that was for sure. No kind of place for the boys, either, as it happened. Too many fancy eyes. *Not* too ritzy for Goldie, though, maybe All right, if Harry was heading into a place like this, he must have some high-rolling pal in there, too. Someone who could pay off old Harrys debts with the right*persuasion.* Thatd be best for everyone. Goldie would get paid, Harry would get to keep his dainty fingers, and this friend--whoever they were--would get to feel like a real swell person. Hell, maybe theyd just plug Harry once she was done. Not her business. But one way or another, Goldie was gonna get paid tonight."

        "writing_prompt": "The XCOM Project has been activated, and the world\u2019s first line of defense against an alien invasion is scrambling to prepare. As the base buzzes with frantic activity, from scientists analyzing alien tech to engineers rushing to build new equipment, the field operatives wait in tense silence, knowing they\u2019ll be the first to face whatever comes next.",
        "story": "##March 1st, 2015 They called it *Operation: Secret Fist,* which was strangely appropriate, because the result of it felt a bit like a punch to the gut. Aliens were real. They were *hostile.* They were right in XCOMs backyard. It seemed like dumb luck that the first alert of extraterrestrial activity was so close, but that proved to be wishful thinking. So Paulo was one of *three* sites across the globe that had a sudden alien incursion--or so the later report from the Council of Funding Nations said--but it was this closest one that XCOM scrambled the Skyranger and four operatives to respond to. It had happened only a minute *before* the decision to officially activate the XCOM Project came down from an emergency call by the Council. Soon, the base was alive with more activity than the secluded complex had ever experienced in the entirety of its existence. Only the incredible calm in the Commanders base-wide announcement held the place shy of complete chaos--that, and a deeply ingrained military discipline among so many of the personnel, and a wide understanding that Chief Ndaba (who still preferred Lieutenant Colonel Ndaba or simply Sir) would not tolerate *anyone* shirking duty. Even if alien metal were falling from the sky. Which, reportedly, it was. By the time the team returned from the op--alive, but with one significant casualty sustained--orders had already been issued to most of the base personnel and the experimental Skyranger found itself competing for space with a flurry of black helicopters hurrying in and out of the base, transporting people, supplies, and equipment. The good news was that XCOM had funding now. The base, long in a state of ambivalent idleness, with hollowed out underground chambers simply waiting to be turned into usable facilities, was now at the tender mercies of a mobilized construction crew. Word was Felipe had been the first person the Commander spoke with after the emergency call from the Council. Staff had been roused in the middle of the night, long-dormant machinery started up, and the first of the helicopters sent out for additional manpower. Many more followed. XCOM suddenly had much greater needs: More people meant more space, meant more food, meant more *everything.* Manny Lee found himself in the kitchen far earlier than usual, brusquely informed he was now a supervisor, and set loose on whatever culinary conscripts they could muster. A little after dawn, the Council Liaison herself arrived. Thered never been a Liaison on site before. Thered never been a *need* for one. But the Council was throwing real resources at XCOM for the first time in years, and they werent about to let their eyes on it remain distant and unfocused. Iris Li had one priority on her agenda, of course: the Commander. But while the pair talked, work continued: Research & Development had a sudden need to clear all personal projects and experiments to make way for mission critical work, for not longer after the Operatives returned came the first batch of alien salvage from the field: fragments of technology, alien cadavers, materials samples, and a very curious canister of orange fluid. It was this last that caught the Chief Scientists eye. Dr. Indira Sahni, for her relatively benign appearance and friendly demeanor, had a reputation to match Ndabas: shed been with the Project since its creation, and many believed it was international interest in her experimental weapons research that largely drove it over the years. Right now, though, it was the orange fluid that interested her. I want everything catalogued and stored securely before we begin. *Be careful.* Reports from the field are that the alien weapons exploded on their deaths. *Dont* cause any unplanned detonations in my lab. And that was that. Then she fired of a priority dispatch for the Commander and the Operations Chief: >I need Dr. Darya Ansari acquired for the Project. Address attached. And another of Ndabas choppers was away. Down in Engineering, the team faced an urgent request to produce two field-ready versions of cutting edge technology theyd only ever built one rudimentary prototype for. It was a Medkit, but not in any conventional fashion--and it was needed. One grievously injured operative had been pulled out of the Skyranger. It was their job to prevent another. *At least its not a weapon,* Declan thought. But it was still going to be a pain in the ass to work out the kinks and make adjustments with the new intel from the field. On and on the list of jobs went. From cutting edge research to simple logistics, there was no end to the support needed to suddenly activate the XCOM Project. In fact, the only people who *didnt* have a seemingly endless list of things to do were the Field Operatives themselves. Four of them sat ready to respond to the next call for action; the others were told to relax or pitch in where you can. Nobody had any idea when the aliens would strike next, but after their initial strikes, theyd gone completely silent. The hours passed, and the skies remains quiet, but it couldnt last. The aliens would be back. And when they were, it would be four of the field operatives who would face them."
