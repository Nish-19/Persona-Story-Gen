        "writing_prompt": "On a chaotic Monday morning in a bustling city, a small coffee shop offering free coffee becomes the stage for an eclectic cast of characters\u2014each with their own quirks, tempers, and secrets. What could possibly go wrong?",
        "story": "#Chapter 1: ##Customer Satisfaction Or 0 Days Without Sexual Harassment ###*(as narrated by Samuel L. Jackson)* There is nothing worse on Gods green Earth than a cold-ass Monday morning in the city. Everyone rushing to work or from night shifts or to school, everyone wanting to get the day started so it can already be over. Everyone being a *bitch* and a *cunt* to one another to get the last seat on the subway or be the first in line...and *no one* wanting to deal with those fuckers they have to be constantly surrounded by; the *other people*. But the thing about Mondays, is that even the smallest of things can make those horrible, terrible days of the week feel *just* a little better. And thats free fucking coffee. And not just *any* free fucking coffee from a mass-produced, ass-tasting barrel! No sir! Free *custom* made coffee with a fresh from the oven muffin in a warm and toasty coffee shop that lookswell, almost like Starbucks underachieving, slightly retarded brother that everyone praises for tying his shoes in the morning. I admit, its not the best coffee shop in the world, but ya gotta give 'em credit for trying. *Coffee Nutz*, originally the brain child of an NYU hipster who needed something more in life than a twenty-thousand-dollar piece of laminated paper, has grown quite a bit in its three whole years of existence. They have a total of three locations in the city; Uptown, Midtown, and Downtown, and have already partnered up with as many start-up businesses as you can think of. Uber, Yelp, Foursquareyou name it and you can *bet* someone was fucked on some couch in an office for it. However, since business wasnt exactly a boomin the owner decided to do a little Monday morning experiment to drum up some attention. **For today only**, all three of his locations would offer their products for free. And the Midtown location, just five blocks south of Central Park, is where *this* particular story is set. --- Now lets meet some of the players, shall we? First and foremost, the direct contact to the boss and the barista whos been there from day one; Chester. Chesters a curious sort. He was the first one to apply to a teeny coffee shop on the second floor of an equally as teeny adult book store, and even as that teeny coffee shop grew and grew and eventually expanded *into* the teeny adult book store, taking up both floors of the building, Chester has stayed the barista and sort of a team lead, for all of those three years. Never asking for a raise, or better hours, or seeking a promotion. For some inexplicable reason he just seemed to really love his job. It was still too early for Coffee Nutz to have many coffee-loving customers around, but it was a good sign already that people were lining up past the bakery counter. Chester was smiling -grinning- at a woman across from him dressed in a sleek business suit with a tightly pulled back bun on her head, chatting without breath into the outdated Bluetooth on her ear. Hi! Welcome to Coffee Nutz, where were all just *nuts* about coffee! Eheh... Today all the coffee is free, so what would you like to order? The woman, seeming to stare straight at Chester and yet managing to ignore him completely, said to no one in particular, Uh-huh yeah. Papers on my desk by lunchtime. Noby *brunch* time, got that? Write that down, write down brunch time. What? Ohum, medium half-caf latte, skim milk, *no* sugar, please. You said its free...? Chester gave a nod, the smile never leaving his face, as he picked up a cup to write down the order on it, Well technically the only price is a hug but we dont charge any tax for hugs Hold on, Susan, the woman suddenly interrupted both Chester and Susan on the other line, Theres some coffee clerk in here sexually harassing me, quick call to my lawyer, Im gonna have to call you back. --Now, what did you say your name was, sir? Chester stopped writing, marker and cup hovering in the air, and looked over at her slightly paled. He glanced left and right before slowly starting to answer, Ah.my.*my* name, huh? My name is uh.M..Martin. Martin Shshort. Martin Short? Your name tag says Chester. What is your last name Chester?, the woman continued calmly as if this was a daily occurrence for her. Chester took a breath, turning it into a small laugh as he passed the empty cup to Willow, the only other barista behind the counter, Ahthank you for your order! Please step down to the pick-up counter and well get that right out for ya As Chester desperately busied himself with the next customer, the woman stepped over, leaning over the counter to watch Willow work on her coffee with judgmental intensity. As if studying the girls every move, finger hovering over her phone, ready to sue anyone for the littlest thing. Um, can Iplease get a different cup? I think that coffee clerk might have *dirtied* that one. *Thank you*!, the business woman chimed at Willow before taking another call on her Bluetooth again. --- Meanwhile, the business bitch wasnt the only rude customer on a phone in that coffee shop. A little further down the line of people, stood a big man in an equally as expensive suit with rings peppering his fingers and a chain around his neck. He held a phone up to his ear as he stood, from time to time checking out his big expensive watch. Well you can tell *Wallace* -verbatim- tell him I said this, tell him Im saying this *exactly*. I will *break* both his big toes and make him run, barefoot, to that Seven Eleven six blocks away to get me a twix bar. *Twix bar*, not a fucking Snickers, not those caramel peanut butter *horse cocks*, a goddamn *Twix* bar that he will pay for *out of pocket* and then run back to me *on* his broken toes. And when he gets back here with my Twix bar, tell him I will break three fingers on each of his hands and make him type up my daughters school report due tomorrow. And it better be fucking *perfect*, he better have read goddamn To Kill a Mockingbird. Because if I dont see any clear cut similarities between fucking Boo Radley and Finch in there, *then* I will shoot him in the head. Got that? You got all that? If he doesnt have the money by the time I get back, that will happen. Tell him that will happen, alright?, he hung up the phone and shook his head, speaking to whoever was in line behind him, \"Assholes, huh? No respect for ya. No ones got any respect anymore. Fuck... And as the sun was still barely peeking through the skyscrapers during this early morning and as two hapless baristas tried to serve the slowly growing number of people, more and more of our storys main characters started flooding into the coffee shop."

        "writing_prompt": "At Coffee Nutz, a quirky caf\u00e9 doubling as a front for its owner's illicit dealings, the staff juggles muffins, Russian lessons, and suspiciously heavy sacks of \"sugar.\" But when a mysterious figure from Kyoto begins searching for a legendary weapon, the caf\u00e9's quiet chaos might just collide with something far more dangerous.",
        "story": "It was a chilly early autumn morning as the new and improved Coffee Nutz opened its doors and prepared for the day. The Coffee Nutz crew this week consisted of the Russian and perpetually angry-looking [**Sonya**]( the totally not high or anything college dropout [**Stevie**]( and of course the new owner Nathan \"Nate\" (or Mr. Gray) himself. Nate was currently in the back, going over his *other* store's supply, y'know, the illegal, *more* addicting kind? The other two employees were well aware of Coffee Nutz moonlighting as Nate's personal drug ring. Sonya didn't exactly approve of it, but she didn't exactly care enough to raise objections. And Stevie? Well lets just say that half of Stevie's paycheck was not in the form of *money*... Sonya was preparing the first batches for the bakery all while trying to teach poor Stevie some Russian while he stacked cups and prepped the coffee machines. Nate was finishing up packing all the little baggies and pills deep into their respective sacks of coffee, sugar and the like. Away from any prying eyes. \"No. No you say *dobroe utro*\", Sonya enunciated every word as she stacked muffins behind the counter glass. \"D-dobe...roy....\", Stevie actually had to put down the pack of coffee he was feeding the machine to focus up, \"Dobroy....Oot....what was it?\" The Russian woman gave a resolute sigh. \"Why do I bozer?\", she muttered to herself, \"You like my hasband. In ze one ear. Out of ze ozer. *Dob*. *Roe*. *Ut*. *Ro*.\" Stevie gave a whine. If he honestly cared about learning things, he would've stayed in college instead of pursuing a career in ethical hacking. \"Dobe...\" Meanwhile in the storage room near the back, Nate paused near one of the boxes he was packing as he heard a muffled crash come from outside, followed by a light string of curses. It was too early for customers. Front *or* back ones... He walked out through the back door and peeked around the corner, leaning his forearms on the door frame. Oh. It was only *Leon*...again. What a surprise! \"Oy!\", Nate called out to him, \"Freeloader! Stop messin' with my trash cans and make yerself useful, yes? Might score ya a free coffee and muffin!\" Nate tossed Leon a broom. \"Go sweep the front. Look pretty.\", with a grin and a wink, Nate disappeared back inside. As Nate joined his team up front in opening the cafe, Sonya gave their boss a weary look. \"How many *narcos* we get zis time, Gray?\", she said with a raised eyebrow as Stevie took his rightful place at the register. \"With *my* luck?\", Nate looked over as he perched on one of the back tables while picking at a freshly made muffin, \"The whole bloody *lot* of 'em!\" ----------------- ## Meanwhile in Kyoto, Japan. ## High up in a secluded temple. [**Leo**]( the current leader of The Ministry, soundlessly took a seat on the floor next to his sensei. \"She *will* be a part of us once again, Sensei. That I assure you. And the weapon will be passed on to its *rightful* owner. But it will not be an easy task.\", Leo spoke quietly with his eyes closed, keeping to the same quiet and meditative atmosphere as his master. \"Nothing is ever absolute\", came the answer from the old man, \"But there is something to easy your path, something that could...guide your way in your endeavors. That sword, it is not without a partner. *Yin and yang*. There exists another weapon. A sword of *light* to balance out the dark. An opposite to *Life Drainer*.\" Leo tensed up but did not let his surprise show any further than that. He remained silent as the sensei gave a smile. \"In time, my student, you will learn all that you need to know.\" --- *edit: Leo's pic changed.*"

        "writing_prompt": "In the middle of an intense Dungeons & Dragons session, your group is interrupted by a strange man in a bow-tie wielding a buzzing, glowing device, claiming your game has accidentally summoned something very real\u2014and very dangerous.",
        "story": "# Chaotic Good It was just about, but not quite, evening as a man and a woman sat at the window counter of a Starbucks. [**The man**]( tall, with a big chin, and floppy hair covering barely visible eyebrows, was gingerly sipping from his steaming cup as the blonde, foxy-eyed, woman glanced over at him, cupping her own. \"It doesn't even *taste* like pumpkin\", he said to her while studying his cup with greater intensity than necessary, \"And where's the spice? I swear...you *humans* and your 'fads'...\" He rolled his eyes, taking another sip, and soon felt a pointed glance directed at the bow-tie around his neck. The Doctor looked at the bow-tie then over at Claudia, exclaiming, \"What? Bow-ties are *cool*. Pumpkin spice lattes are *not*.\" Right on queue, just as they finished the rest of their lattes, The Doctor gave a slight jump as his breast pocket began vibrating with a pulsating green color. He took out the [**sonic screwdriver**]( which was indeed buzzing and flashing with a green light at the top. Studying it for no more than a few seconds, he shut it's green top and bolted out of his seat. \"They've awoken! I'm picking up their trail, come on!\", was the last Claudia heard of the Doctor before she scrambled after him out of the Starbucks and down the street. They ran down the London streets, weaving in between people and nearly getting run over by traffic. The Doctor, his sonic screwdriver out and guiding his way, was barely even paying attention to his surroundings. So much so, that Claudia had to yank him back several times to keep him from running out into the street or down an open manhole cover. Finally, however, they came to a stop in front of a very nondescript apartment in a row of such other nondescript apartments. \"Here it is! They're in there! The screwdriver is going *mad*. I just hope we're not too late...\", he said, motioning to this one particular door. Claudia raised a fist, prepared to give it a knock, when she heard the familiar green-lit buzzing coming from her left. On the other side of the door, in the quite tastefully furnished apartment, sat four young guys huddled around a table. On the table lay a very detailed map of what looked like a castle surrounded by weaving labyrinths of forests, swamps, and mountains. And on top of the map sat four plastic figurines of fantasy characters brandishing weapons, along with a couple plastic figures of a troll as well as a dragon further away near the castle. Handfuls of dice and charts of paper lay distributed among the boys as they seemed to be in a heated discussion about what to do with a distraught maiden they found near an overturned cart full of goods. Just as one of them turned to consult an open manual behind him, their apartment door slammed open and The Doctor stumbled into their room, followed a bit more hesitantly by Claudia. \"**Stop** right there, put down those die!\", the Doctor exclaimed poining an accusing finger at the table, \"Nobody touch *anything* on that table!\""
