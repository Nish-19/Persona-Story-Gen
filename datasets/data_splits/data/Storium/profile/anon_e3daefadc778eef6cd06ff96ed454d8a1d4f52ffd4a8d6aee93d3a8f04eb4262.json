        "writing_prompt": "On the forgotten moon of Lunar, you arrive at the isolated Oasis facility, where the polished halls and vintage charm mask an unsettling emptiness\u2014and the receptionist\u2019s serene smile doesn\u2019t quite reach her eyes. What secrets lie beneath the surface of this quiet, star-lit cul-de-sac?",
        "story": "Lunar, the forgotten moon. The descent to the moons surface could not have felt longer. The inter-Terra transit company decided in-flight entertainment wasnt a necessity, so it was eight hours from the closest transit hub in a sealed tube with nothing to do. The small view port slits next to the seats werent even proper windows, so it was hard enough to see the Oasis facility as one made the long descent. Still, as the sealed doors of the tube opened and the flight attendant in her slightly-too-tight blue waistcoat ushered the crew out of the door the locale became apparent. Built as a cul-de-sac, Oasis was a mixture of the new and the old. The far buildings were the clean, crisp looking white buildings of pre-downsizing technology, and the closer ones boxy and rusted looking prefabs that were a long time in need of being removed. As though whoever had planned the place decided to ignore the discrepancy; the lawns and teardrop street lights that lit the avenue leading up to reception looked like a patch job to cover the glaring issue. Probably the nicest looking things here were the vintage fords and chevys arranged like a synchronised dance routine along the small patch of tarmac road. Beyond the glass domed facility nothing existed but moon rock, beyond that the stars, and the distant but noticeable shadow of Vita Regnans blotting out a patch of starlight. It all combined to give the place an early evening feel despite the clocks showing just past twelve-thirty at night. Earth time, obviously. At the base of the ramp to the landing pad the guide stopped. He took out a cigarette and put it to his lips, without lighting it he glanced down at the clipboard in his hands. Meanwhile a tidal wave of lab coats and scrubs spread out to relieve those on their shifts. Okay, yall are looking for a Doctor Herbert Achebe. He scratched the back of his head as he glanced through the group assembled before him. Should find him in the reception hall over there, he indicated the central building with a nod of his head, just ask the pretty girl at the desk and shell put you through. His clipboard fell to his side and he sniffed the air. Oh and Marshal, sir, he added hastily, good hunting. *** Inside the facility things looked nicer. The floors were polished white, the ceiling smooth metal panels with circle lights spread to get the best coverage. Even the chairs looked recently cleaned and the bins were almost empty. Not that it helped the smell; chemicals and the faint undertone of cigarette smoke. Somewhere in the air the scratchy sound of a gramophone sung Frank Sinatras *Fly Me to the Moon*. It wasnt in the lobby, but it was loud enough that it could be heard without the need to concentrate. It filled the weirdly empty void which one would usually associate with people, more so somewhere like a hospital. Of the two people present, one sang along to it. The other, a petite young woman sat behind the reception desk, looked down at the paper in front of her. She wore a soft smile, entirely engrossed in her work. She didnt look up when the doors opened, the only indication she was even alive was when she swept a few strands of platinum blonde hair out of her pale face. How can Oasis help you tonight? She spoke to the air when someone approached her desk."

        "writing_prompt": "Tsubaki, once a star player of the legendary Nichidaisan Golpelota team, is determined to rebuild the squad's former glory\u2014but with a faded court, a tarnished reputation, and a handful of untested recruits, can she prove she's still a Queen of the Court?",
        "story": "*The shine of sweat, the power of the plays, the sound of the crowd as it came alive on that day twelve years ago. The day that lit a fire in the hearts of a generation.* *The well oiled machine of the Japanese Golpelota team. The whistle blew and the play began. The keeper; Mistuki Akiyama, passed the ball to Yusaka Kubo. He switched pace, driving forward to meet the German striker. A quick switch up in pace and he spun around him, passing the ball across to the centre.* *Yuri Koizumi controlled the ball, passing it between his legs from his left to right hand to avoid a steal before running a fast break into the opponents half. Cut off by a one on one from the German centre his options were limited. He took a breath, the world seemed to move in slow motion.* *Many would dispute Yuris next move, claiming he ran away, but to others he acted with quick thinking. Toshiro Sato slipped behind him, taking a veiled hand off before moving into space in the German defenses before they could react.* *Two attackers moved into place, jumping in unison. The perfect feint. Toshiro had all the options, he stepped in for the set and with pinpoint precision brought the ball to Taro Konishi at the apex of his jump. The German keeper moved the wrong way, panicked and out of time.* *The crack of the impact as Taro spiked the ball could be heard anywhere in the stadium. It flew without interference into the open right of the goal. There was a momentary silence as the two attackers landed, and immediately the celebrations erupted.* *The sound was deafening. Japan had pulled ahead.* --- Tsubaki switched off the tv and leaned back in her chair. She sighed and shook her head. Every time she watched that it gave her chills, reminded her of the memory. Reminded her of the sweet little girls they all used to be; gathered watching their parents play at the top of their game. She blinked and closed her eyes. *None of this Queens of the Court nonsense.* Then she sat forward and looked over to where Eden stood in the corner of the room. She laughed sardonically and put her hands on her knees. The new players should be arriving soon, mostly second years. A promising first year and another third year as well. She stood and put the remote in front of the Tv. When she turned, she used her foot to flick a Golpelota ball into her hand. It felt natural, just like old times. She was a *Queen* after all, the accident wasnt her fault. Maybe it was selfish, but by the end of the year shed prove it. Tsubaki held it out for Eden. Im counting on you to keep em motivated. This time the smile was genuine, and followed by a wink. Thats the captain after all. Now come on, lets see what they can do. --- The sports hall was empty by the time the first new player had arrived. It was possible they expected more from the recruiting drive Tsubakid been doing the last week coupled with the fliers pinned to just about every notice board. But it was empty. A cage of balls stood in one corner, and two abandoned looking goals were placed at either side of a Golpelota court with faded line markers. The floor was scuffed in places and the walls were dirty. The entire place had that unused feel that a sports hall got when its team were away for a long time. The smell of sweat and dreams still lingered though, the oly indication that Nichidaisan had a Golpelota team at all. *The meeting place did say the old sports hall, right?* A nagging voice seemed to call out from somewhere. *Where is everyone?* Luckily they didnt have to wait long."

        "writing_prompt": "As the grand airship race looms, your scrappy vessel, The Wistful Spirit, is dwarfed by giants and plagued by last-minute malfunctions. With a questionable market stall, a tense bridge, and a course full of peril, how will you outwit the competition and survive the skies?",
        "story": "Sunlight split the clouds as the clock ticked past the four hour mark. By now every competing airship had arrived and drifted lazily in it's starting blocks. They were arranged by order of size, but as per usual not enough space was permitted for the number of competitors and many of the smaller ones were fitted in the shadows of giants. Beyond them the airdocks above Queensmont were alive with activity. Thick crowds of people packed into the observation decks like sardines, craning to get a view of ships they had only heard about in stories. Above them crew men stalked back and forth on rickety gantries and busy walkways checking and rechecking lists on clipboards. At one side of the dock, near the clocktower, the private market buzzed with anticipation and anxiety. Though every captain was smart enough to plan for, *nearly,* every opportunity there was always the odd engine part or ration box that went awry resulting in the market rush. Of course at times like this the shopkeepers made sure to boost their prices to lethal rates. At the other end more transport balloons were carrying last minute crew additions, more audience members and every other person you could think of that would have any kind of investment in the great race. It was often said that \"experiencing the crowd was just as exciting as being part of the race itself,\" and looking at the place now that was obvious. --- Our ship, The Wistful Spirit, was given its mooring on the smaller end of the lineup given its early arrival. In fact it had been sat in the allotted space for nearly two days, and since then everything that could possibly go wrong with the preflight checks had. At first it was just a slight drift on the steering column that bugged anyone who wanted to be *on course* and then it was the altitude meter displaying something that was, without a doubt, wrong. After that the engine made a strange noise which made everyone a little bit uncomfortable, and finally the toilets lack of flushing. It had made the last two days hell, but now that the four hour mark passed everything looked to be in working order, or at least as much as anyone could as for in the given circumstances. That said, no one wanted to forgo the idea of doing last minute preflight checks, and a couple of extra spares from the market wouldnt have gone amiss. --- Speaking of the market, though, it was clear that near one ship in particular had the same thought. At nearly every stand a group of people in the sky blue uniform of the RNAF were haggling with the shopkeepers or showing large bags of government funding. Those stands that werent being hassled by official navy business were occupied by the haggard crew of other smaller vessels who just wanted piece of mind. The negotiations of these stands were more tense, though whether this was due to the lack of trained soldiers or the lack of money was hard to tell. Either way it became increasingly obvious that finding a shop that sold anything useful would be that much harder to find. As luck would have it though, there was one stall that wasnt occupied in the slightest. With a large sign made of pieces of salvaged junk, *Lilly the Skulls General Goods* stood open without any interference. It advertised its wares with flashy signs and the rather inviting smell of cooking, but one had to question the legality of anything being sold there. --- The bridge of the Wistful Spirit was no less tense, for it was tradition that before every race the course that a ship takes be reconsidered and altered as many times as is humanly possible in as short a time as possible. The rules of the race dictate that as long as key waypoints are passed through, the exact course any ship takes is entirely up to the Captain and Navigator of the ship in question. That left a lot up to change, and that meant a navigator spent every spare moment after the course announcement knocking off any precious second they could. And for a small ship like the Wistful Spirit knocking off seconds was the best option, because they couldnt hope to compete with the resources of something like In Midnight Clad or with the pace of something like The Lord Arthur without a few tricks up their sleeve. The only hope was that this year the course could make a difference where it mattered, *and save the ship from getting shot out of the air.*"

        "writing_prompt": "As the Four Dragon Festival approaches, masters of martial arts, thieves, and travelers converge on the Imperial city, each with their own purpose. Will you face rival practitioners in duels of honor, navigate the treacherous Qing-Long river crossings, or brave the bandit-infested western roads?",
        "story": "The day began with heat, perhaps uncharacteristically so, and then with dirt. Many speculated the heat was a sign the festival would be a time of great change, while some said it was a warning. To those on the day, it was dry. The roads were thick with people. Some were entourages of masters looking to try their luck, others simple spectators. In between, beggars and thieves moved but spirits were high enough no one noticed. High spirits did not kill the rivalries between styles though, and every few steps a new duel began. When such happened, those with more time or investment stopped to watch. --- It was just such an occasion, on the road from the South Coast to the Imperial city, that two masters looked to duel. They strolled off the path onto the grass, the sun beating down on their heads, and took five paces between them. To those in the know, these two masters would instantly be recognisable. The first, a taller man rolling his sleeves back, was Sifu Fu Chao Wu. A strong contender to be head of the Eight Palms, his service record was as long as the trail on his sleeves. The second, a young woman with fire in her eyes, was Dong-Geun Eun. She who knows a thousand kicks, and daughter of the chair to The Way of the Foot. It has been some time since I fought a Southern practitioner. Fu Chao smiled as he slid his feet together, and rolled his shoulders. I had thought you all died out. If we had it would be for the stupidity of the Northern barbarians. Dong-Geun replied, stretching her legs. But worry not, I shall ensure not to send you away with your tail between your legs. They faced each other and, fist to palm, bowed. Please they spoke in unison. --- Elsewhere, many had reached the Qing-Long river. This great body of water was the final boundary between the North and the Imperial city. It was a place of life, but taken lightly it was a place of death too. Its current was strong, and it led all the way to the Eastern Coast. To ford this river the Emperor built two major crossings. First was the Emperors own bridge; a place staffed and audited by the Imperial Guard. The second was the ancient bridge at the Serpents Tongue where the river was divided in two. Due to the nature of those traveling to the festival people packed onto both bridges. The waits to cross would be hours if not days. Camps appeared for those who could afford to wait and boats for those who weren't. But like with all gatherings of people, these areas were tense and not without their problems. With far too many to contain, the Imperial Guard could not stop every crime or intercede in every duel. --- For those taking the western roads though there was an altogether different problem. Long had the poorer western lands been plagued by banditry. Their trade routes plundered and their highways ransacked. Anyone travelling here would need a strong arm and a tough heart. Though many ventured beyond their walls, few reached their destination. The bandits had little interest in the festival. They saw it as a waste of time brought on by those who had too much money. The mountain clans of this mind stalked down to patrol roads and set up toll posts. To a brave practitioner they may be little challenge, but to those not so strong they would prove a deadly. No journey in these parts could end without blood. --- Such was the Four Dragon Festival, that really began long before the day the festival started."
