Between the new worlds we forged a life for ourselves, something of a frontier, but like with all frontiers things didn\u2019t exactly go to plan. After wars, planetary politics and the breakdown of common government, the Sol system became fractured and rifts formed. Many planets became independent, and nations within them sprang up forging ever smaller communities.\n\nTo fill the gap, new roles of society sprang up. Some are Runners; willing to fly cargo ships through blockades and battlefield so that fringe groups could survive. Others are Wisemen who believed the universe speaks through them, leading their flock of misguided souls. Worst are the Bounty Hunters willing to take a life just to pay the bills. It\u2019s lonely up there among the stars, but someone had to do it, may as well be them.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s a roll of a dice just to keep love and life alive.",

            "story_name": "The year is 2020, the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nJapan takes the gold in the *Golpelota* tournament, smashing the German team 123 to 78. The match is spectacular, lighting a fire in the youth of the nation. In particular a light is lit in the hearts of six girls watching their father\u2019s compete on an international level. \n\nOver the next years these girls played Golpelota under their parent\u2019s tutelage, inheriting their father\u2019s talent. They excelled, becoming incomparable in their respective positions. When the oldest, Yuna Akiyama, reached middle school she made them take a vow that they would not play in official matches until highschool where they would compete to see who was best. \n\nNow in 2032, they are all high school aged and the battle of the *Queens of the Court* has begun. Little do they know, another team challenges their superiority.\n\n---\n\nThree years ago Nichidaisan High\u2019s Golpelota team failed for the fourth year running to beat the regional group stages. Demoralised they disbanded, and their club room fell into disrepair. Three years later a first year appeared in the faculty office requesting the club be remade.\n\nTsubaki Tamako, the unknown Queen of the Court, made the request with the intention of defeating them all and proving they aren\u2019t as strong as they pretend to be. While she can\u2019t play due to injuries, she intends to act as the manager of the team and create a weapon of regicide.\n\nHer only hope is that she\u2019ll find the players she\u2019s looking for.\n\n---\n\nQueenslayers is a game that takes place in an alternate history timeline; In the early 2000s a new Latin American game known as Golpelota became hugely popular and internationally successful. It became a widely played game in every nation, and in Japan it gained an impressive high school following with an intense national scene.  \n\nThe sport is a full contact team sport. It\u2019s based on a mixture of Indoor Football, Basketball, and Volleyball. It has teams of 6, with a single team captain, 5 outfield players and a keeper. A game consists of an hour of play, separated into 15 minute quarters. \n\nThe game begins with a ball toss where two players jump to take possession of the ball first. They then pass to another player and the quarter begins. The players must then take the ball into their opponents half and score in their opponents goal. A player must travel with the ball by bouncing it (dribbling) and may not hold a ball for more than two seconds.\n\nIn order to score a player must hit the ball into the goal in a similar way to spiking or serving a volleyball. This can be done from anywhere on the pitch, but is easiest done in the opponent's end zone; however, a player is not allowed to be in contact with both the ball and the floor in an end zone (unless they are the keeper). To avoid this roles such as pivots were made to set up a spike for a player in the end zone. \n\nA penalty shot is worth 1 point, a shot made in the end zone is worth 2 points and a shot made outside the end zone is worth 3 points. Games will often end in values of between 60 and 90 points.\n\n*This is all subject to change, ideas about how the game should work is welcome. I\u2019d like to encourage potential applicants to ask questions and get involved in the creation of the sport and world. A more comprehensive rulebook is also in development which should be done by the time we begin XD* ",

Going is good fluffy, minimal bird traffic but the wind is mildly fierce and a little greasy.* \n\n*Taking their places are fan favourites; The Lord Arthur, Anabelle\u2019s Twilight, In Midnight Clad, Dances in Daytime and of course Seramiggia. Beside them stand many more than I can count, and the excitement is, of course, palpable.*\n\n*Over the next two weeks they will be flying from here in the heart of Argus to the Great Purple Jewel of Seranus by route picked by this year's judges. The competition is fierce, the trash talking has started and I do believe I just heard a cannon shot. Hold onto your hats ladies and gentlemen it\u2019s going to be a wild ride.*\u201d\n\nThe radio crackled on the bridge of the *Wistful Spirit.* The message stung a little, a clear note that the small airship wasn\u2019t quite important enough to be counted among the kings of the sky, but that didn\u2019t matter. This was the year one of those juggernauts would lose, and who better than a small ship like this one.\n\nStill tensions were high as the wait for the starting signal to sound dragged on. Long agonising moments that lasted from the first light of dawn. For a pilot it meant you couldn\u2019t leave your seat because if you did you\u2019d lose precious seconds, and for everyone else it was that coffee cup shaking anticipation that had you going back and forth from the john every twenty minutes. \n\nStill there was no lie that the lines of airships stretching out from the sky dock to the far side of Queensmont was impressive. There was every size and model ranging from the original Leven Carriers to the newer specialist models like Erinson\u2019s Firefly. There were even shadows cast by Argus warships like In Midnight Clad. It was enough to make any airship engineer sweat.\n\nWho could say how this year would go?",

From that alliance he brought forth a new generation of practitioners. It is even said that he achieved the much sort after enlightenment. Unfortunately, as with all people, his life must come to and end but before that he intends to choose a successor.\n\nAnd so, with the Emperor's blessing, the Grandmaster looks to the four dragon festival for an answer. For the first time in 86 years this ancient ritual will help him choose his successor. For two days and two nights, martial artists across the world will gather. Old rivalries will be rekindled and new alliances formed. Then at the climax, under the new moon, the Grandmaster will pick his successor.\n\nOn the subject the Grandmaster refuses to comment. Instead he spends his time dwelling upon it in his sanctum. Many believe the Grandmaster\u2019s own pupil, Master Hua Zhong, will be chosen. Others believe a practitioner of common birth will come from the ranks.  With such honour at stake even those that do not practice  rush for an audience with the Grandmaster.\n\nRumour has it that even the Island of the Sun has sent a delegation. Those of honourable skill not recognised by many of the mainland seek to prove their place in the halls of the forbidden palace. Maybe one will stand alongside the murals of the Great Grandmasters.\n\nHowever, not all is as it seems. There are some who seek to end the alliance between the North and South. Their goal is to return the world to its rightful place of feuding war. They slither from clandestine meetings, and plot to bring death upon the aging Grandmaster. Should they succeed before he is able to pick his successor, the world will plunge into chaos.\n\nNot even the wisest astronomer or most talented prophet could see the outcome of this festival of the ages.",
