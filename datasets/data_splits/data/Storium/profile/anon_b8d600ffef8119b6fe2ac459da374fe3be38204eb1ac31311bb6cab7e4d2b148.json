            "story_name": "The year is 2070 AD. Since the early 2020s, the world has been changed by the appearance of individuals with abilities beyond those of normal humans. People with command over fire and ice, people with the power to read and control minds, people who flew through the air and shrugged off gunfire. Individuals with a seemingly endless variety of powers appeared in greater and greater numbers all across the world.\n\nSome of these people were the products of science, either granted powers by accident or through intentional human experimentation. Others were simply born with their abilities with no obvious explanation. Scientists continue to debate the source of these abilities, with no clear consensus having yet been reached.\n\nWhatever the source of these superpowered individuals, it was only a tragically short amount of time before many of them turned to crime. So-called 'supervillainy' became a worldwide epidemic as non-powered law enforcement proved helpless to stop this new breed of criminal.\n\nFortunately, just as many powered individuals proved willing to step up and defend their communities against this menace. Vigilantes took to the streets in costumes and masks, fighting against criminals that law enforcement was unable to stop. While these individuals were highly controversial at first, governments worldwide began to realize that powered crime fighters were the only ones capable of protecting the public in this new age.\n\nThus began the careers of the first superheroes. Government agencies began to offer official sponsorship to certain heroes who had proven themselves as defenders of their communities. Teams of powered individuals increasingly replaced mundane law enforcement in cities across the globe. Most major urban centers now have at least one officially recognized team of heroes tasked with defending the people against all manner of villainy. Many of them still wear costumes like the vigilantes of old out of respect for tradition.\n\nOf course, not all 'heroes' have taken on the role of a crime fighter out of a selfless desire to do good. Powered individuals are still in short supply, and government agencies will pay handsomely to get the best of the best on their side. Corporations increasingly offer sponsorship to superhero teams, placing their logos on their costumes and equipment in exchange for large cash contributions. Superheroes feature prominently in many major national advertising campaigns. Some of the most prominent heroes are among the most wealthy and famous people alive today. This includes the Justice Squad, the famed protectors of Champion City, a metropolis on the east coast of the United States\n\nYou aren't one of those heroes. You have no corporate sponsors. You have no government contract. You are what many might call a 'C-list hero'. You probably have a day job of some sort, and might just be scraping by to make ends meet. Still, the Justice Squad can't be everywhere in Champion City. You might just be doing what you can to stop petty street crime for now, but who knows? The opportunity to make it into the big leagues might be right around the corner.\n\nOOC INFORMATION:\n\nI'm aiming to tell a sort of 'classic' superhero story here. It won't be a hundred percent dark and gritty, but it won't be entirely comedic or silly either. Think Batman: The Animated Series as an example of the sort of tone here. There will be plenty of action scenes battling supervillains and other criminals, but there will also be non-action based scenes dealing with the other difficulties of life as a superhero.\n\nFeel free to draw from classic superhero tropes. Capes, masks, and silly costumes are fine. Backstories can range from tragic to mildly ridiculous. Secret identities are common in the setting, and you can feel free to have both a 'hero name' and a regular name.\n\nAll characters will start as unaffiliated 'C-list' heroes who are unconnected with an established team or organization. They will be given a reason to start working together fairly quickly in the first scene.\n\nPlease include some description of your character's powers and abilities in your application, along with a brief origin story to explain how they got them.\n\nI will be looking for a group of 3-6 players. Scenes will vary in length, but I am aiming for at least one move from everybody every three days or so. If you need longer, no big deal. That's just what I'm aiming for.",

            "story_name": "The Kingdom of Versaillia is one of the great powers of the Old World, a realm of both wealth and military might. For decades, the Kingdom has been at war with the Avalon Empire, their neighbor and seemingly eternal rival. Battles were fought across both Versaillia and Avalon, and as far away as their distant colonies in the New World.\n\nNow, after a decisive Versaillian victory in the battle of Alais, a treaty has been signed to bring an end to the long conflict. People across both lands rejoice at an end to the bloodshed. Unfortunately, this victory came at great cost. King Larvane XI, the beloved and respected ruler of Versaillia, passed away only a few weeks after the peace treaty was signed, after a wound he received in battle became infected.\n\nKing Larvane's heir, Crown Princess Elaia, is just barely twelve years old. Though she will be crowned Queen shortly, crown law calls for a regency to lead the kingdom until her sixteenth birthday. Rather than appoint a single regent, King Larvane chose five individuals to act as a council to guide his daughter and lead the kingdom during this tumultuous time. The new regents have been sent missives and asked to gather at the Palace of Mirrors in Luteia, to prepare for the difficult task of leading the realm in the days ahead.\n\nWith the long war at an end and the Kingdom's beloved ruler dead, Versaillia faces a period of deep uncertainty. Nobles plot and scheme, looking for ways to achieve influence over the royal heir and the newly formed regency council. The people talk of disgruntled peasants threatening to revolt, protesting the high taxes brought by the war. Others claim that the king's death was not brought on by a mere war wound, but was the result of poisons or dark magic. Still others whisper that such may be the price the king paid in a dark pact to ensure victory over Avalon. Things often are not as they appear in the Palace of Mirrors.\n\nOOC Information:\n\nThis game is a modified version of an earlier experimental game. The player characters will often be in conflict with each other and will often be pursuing their own agendas. This is a game of Machiavellian intrigue and plotting. You are strongly encouraged to let your subplot drive your character's actions. Plotting with your fellow players is certainly encouraged, but plotting against them is also encouraged. It will be necessary to form coalitions to work with characters of different views and backgrounds in order to accomplish much.\n\nAll player characters in this game will be members of the regency council. Many of the challenges in this game will not be traditional obstacles with strong and weak outcomes, but will only be resolved when a majority of the council agrees on a single course of action. Challenges with strong and weak outcomes will generally only reward strong results with additional information to be used in deciding the best course of action.\n\nVersaillia, while oppressive in many regards, practices absolute primogeniture. The sexes are essentially equal. Please feel free to play a character of any gender in any role.\n\nThis is a low fantasy setting. Magic and fantastic creatures exist, but are exceedingly rare. Most people are uncertain about what is real and what is mere legend when it comes to the supernatural. Versaillia is loosely inspired by pre-revolutionary France, so assume a late 18th century level of technology.\n\nThere will be a cap of five characters for this game. I intend to leave applications open for a few days. I will be trying to pick characters with a strong variety of backgrounds and goals, so take a look at other submissions and try to come up with something unique. Feel free to create your own nature, strength, weakness, and subplot cards in addition to those provided. Please include an explanation for why your character was chosen for the regency council as part of your application. Please include an avatar image with your application.",

            "story_name": "In the year is 2274 AD, the governments of Earth were on the brink of total collapse. The planet had suffered a series of devastating disasters brought on by global climate changes. As the polar ice caps melted away almost entirely, the sea level rose dramatically, swallowing up entire coastal cities. Incredibly intense 'superstorms' ravaged surviving communities. Agriculture became all but impossible.\n\nWith food in short supply and the human population dwindling, those in control of what government infrastructure remained came to a grim conclusion: Earth was doomed. The survivors pooled what resources remained to fund the construction of half a dozen space ships, the pinnacle of human technology and engineering, massive vessels designed to travel to other star systems.\n\nThough spaceflight technology had advanced to the point where interstellar travel was possible, it would not be easy, fast, or simple. No method to surpass the speed of light had ever been discovered, and vessels the size of colony ships would have to travel considerably slower, relying mostly on momentum and drift to conserve fuel.\n\nSix of these ships were constructed, each to be occupied by a hundred thousand people who volunteered to try to carry humanity's legacy forward. Given the length of the journey ahead, it was impossible to do anything but the most rudimentary scans of possible habitable planets in nearby star systems. The colony ships had to set out into the dark of space without even knowing for certain whether they'd find a world they could safely inhabit. The colonists would be placed in an experimental form of cryogenic suspension, aging them minimally over the decades-long voyage. They'd be traveling too far to even communicate with Earth again, truly leaving everything behind for good.\n\nThis is the story of one of those ships, the colony ship *Hercules*. They were bound for Epsilon Eridani e, a rocky world believed to be earthlike and just 10.5 light years from home. The *Hercules* was placed under the command of Captain Lin Heng, a beloved and almost universally respected leader and humanitarian. Captain Heng did more than almost anyone to keep humanity together in Earth's final years. To assist Captain Heng, a group of officers, experts in a variety of fields and disciplines, were selected to advise her and manage different aspects of the colony project.\n\nUnfortunately, the *Hercules* met with disaster before it could ever benefit from Captain Heng's leadership. A catastrophe during the voyage claimed her life along with the lives of dozens of other colonists. Now it would be up to her officers, intended only as advisers and experts in their own fields, to provide the colony with the leadership it would need to survive and thrive. Would it be possible for them to reconcile their ideas for humanity's future and find a way to move forward? Or would the colonists turn out to have just jumped from one doomed world to another?\n\nOOC Information:\n\nThis game will use an experimental format I am currently using in one of my other games. The player characters will often be in conflict with each other and will often be pursuing their own agendas. This is a game of intrigue and scheming. You are strongly encouraged to let your subplot drive your character\u2019s actions. Plotting with your fellow players is certainly encouraged, but plotting against them is also encouraged. It will be necessary to form coalitions to work with characters of different views and backgrounds in order to accomplish much.\n\nFor an example of the format I intend to use, please take a look at this game: https://storium.com/game/the-royal-council\n\nAll player characters in this game will be colony officers who now have to make leadership decisions which will effect the fate of the colony as a whole. Many of the challenges in this game will not be traditional obstacles with strong and weak outcomes, but will only be resolved when a majority of the colony leadership council agrees on a single course of action. Challenges with strong or weak outcomes will generally only be used to effect the exact outcomes of the 'vote' challenges, which will require a majority in support of any particular outcome.\n\nThe *Hercules* has a diverse, international crew. Feel free to have a character of any race, gender, national origin, religion, or sexual orientation in any role. Futuristic automatic translation software makes lack of a common language a complete non-issue.\n\nThere will be a cap of five characters for this game. I intend to leave applications open for a few days. I will be trying to pick characters with a strong variety of backgrounds and goals, so take a look at other submissions and try to come up with something unique.

            "story_name": "The year is 2122. A series of political and economic disasters throughout the course of the twenty first century have led to the decline and disintegration of nearly all major governments. Governance is almost exclusively local now, and the real power is held by the massive global corporations which control most of the world's economy.\n\nThe San Francisco bay area is no exception to these trends. There is no longer any United States to speak of, nor is there a functioning State of California. Tiny municipal governments do their best to keep things in order, but the MegaCorps headquartered in the city make all the important decisions.\n\nThe bay area is a place where the divisions between rich and poor are extremely stark. Corporate executives live in gleaming luxury skyscrapers, enjoying the incredible luxuries of twenty second century life. The poor are left to languish in the slums, dangerous and squalid places where life is cheap.\n\nIn San Francisco, money is everything. If you can afford something, you can have it. If you can't, you're out of luck. Justice is no exception. Law enforcement is now entirely handled by private corporations. If you want a crime solved, you need to pony up the creds to get it handled. If you can't afford it, it's your problem.\n\nLaw enforcement and security services for the area are almost exclusively handled by Olympus Security Services, one of the corporations which dominates the city. They provide everything from patrol services to criminal investigation. They don't come cheap, but their detectives have a reputation as second to none.\n\nOOC Information:\n\nThis story aims for the style of a gritty noir detective tale in a cyberpunk setting. All characters will be investigators of one type or another working for Olympus Security Services.\n\nI am looking for about five or so players. Please be prepared to make moves every couple days. Characters who go more than a week without any activity or any advance notice may be retired.\n\nIdeally I'd like to have a group of diverse characters with different natures, strengths, weaknesses, and subplots.

Hollywood hosts dozens of top notch film studios, each one churning out classics and masterpieces at a seemingly impossible pace.\n\nThis is not the story of one of those studios. This is the story of American Features.\n\nAmerican Features is the smallest of the small independent studios, just a handful of creative professionals with a passion for film. They work with minimal staff and resources on an embarrassingly inadequate lot. Yet still, they keep coming back day after day.\n\nThey all have their reasons for being there. Some are on the infamous Hollywood blacklist, victims of the anti-communist witch hunt who have been forced to work under a pseudonym. Some are artists who have never found their audience, with creative visions that just don't seem to suit the popular demand. Some are brand new to the film industry, desperate to break into show business however they can.\n\nWhatever their individual reasons, this group of eclectic individuals has come together to make a movie. With the studio's finances looking dire, it could well be their last picture eve unless they turn a profit. For the employees of American Features, it might just be their last big chance to make it big.\n\nIt won't be easy. Making a major motion picture is a difficult undertaking under the best of circumstances. Making a picture with a group of questionable talents, next to no budget, and while under scrutiny from overzealous government agents? That could be almost impossible.\n\nOOC Notes:\n\nInspired by *Ed Wood* and the struggles of other independent Hollywood film makers during the era of the Hollywood blacklist.\n\nI am looking to make this a very strongly character focused and character driven story, and will be keeping the group small in order to maintain that focus. I'll probably take four or five characters. No more than one director, producer, or writer. We can have multiples in the other roles. If you want to have a more specific role which isn't listed, feel free to write your own nature card.\n\nYou are welcome to write custom strength, weakness, and subplot cards.\n\nStrict historical accuracy is not required. Feel free to play a character of any gender or race in any role.\n\nI'm aiming for one scene a week, but it might go a little faster or slower depending on how much is going on in each scene.

It was a masterpiece. American Entertainment raked in unexpectedly huge profits, and the struggling studio was finally back on sound financial footing.\n\nSadly, the next few years presented more trying times for the studio. Their next few major features failed to gain the same sort of acclaim as *The Green Tide*, and the profits began to dwindle.\n\nSome said the studio was a victim of its own success, having tried to do too much too soon. Others said they had lost their vision, lacking the same creative spark after parting ways with *The Green Tide*'s controversial and eccentric director. Others blamed this reversal of fortunes on the pervasive controversial themes in the studio's work, always skirting the line of acceptability and risking drawing the ire of Congress.\n\nWhatever the reasons why, American Entertainment was once again teetering on the edge.

Ruled by the benevolent, wise, and powerful Emperor Goltannus, this land of goodness and righteousness has brought civilization to the uncivilized and has protected those who have no other protection. There is truly no greater realm in which to live.\n\nThat is what the official imperial propaganda says. The more cautious citizens of Goltannia would never dare to disagree. After all, those who would dare to suggest that the Emperor or his loyal servants are anything less than correct in all things tend to disappear into the realm's many, many imperial prisons. There is no tolerance for sedition in Goltannia.\n\nNor is there tolerance for witchcraft, thievery, worshiping the \"wrong\" god, evading the imperial draft currently in effect, or any number of other entries on the long, long list of offenses against the empire. Those who disobey soon find themselves in chains, forced to toil in endless labor to help keep the massive imperial army properly supplied.\n\nAs many suffered under the emperor's brutal reign, whispers of rebellion began to spread. Could those who had been oppressed for so long finally seize the opportunity to rise up and seize the freedoms they had been so long denied? Only time would tell.\n\n** OOC Information **\n\nThis is a somewhat dark fantasy story about a small group struggling against a massive evil empire. However, the characters are not necessarily idealistic and righteous. They may be working against the empire for purely selfish reasons, to gain power for themselves, or just acting out of good old fashioned revenge.\n\nAt the start of the story, all characters are incarcerated in one of the empire's many prisons/dungeons/labor camps. Please provide an explanation for how and why they were taken prisoner along with your character description. If you'd like it to be a secret, feel free to let me know in private messages or comments on the character page.\n\nI'm looking for a group of between three and five players. As with all my games, this one is LGBT friendly. No word limits, past tense preferred. Pre-made cards have been provided to offer some suggestions, but please feel free to write your own custom nature, strength, weakness, and subplot cards.\n\nHere are some notes on the setting to provide background and character ideas:\n\n** Races **\n\nThe Emperor and all nobility in Goltannia are human. Elves, dwarves, and other nonhuman races are found throughout the empire, but they are very much second class citizens. Owning land is prohibited for most nonhumans and they face systemic discrimination.\n\nThe Empire has just completed a years-long conquest of dwarven territory and is currently at war with a large elven kingdom. Consequently, elves and dwarves are regarded with particular distrust. Just being suspected of sympathizing with the Emperor's enemies can be enough to get someone imprisoned.\n\n** Religion **\n\nThe Emperor claims to be a direct descendant of Goltan the Just, a powerful god of civilization and order. As such, while the existence of other gods is acknowledged, worship of Goltan is the only approved religion within the empire.\n\nSometimes authorities turn a blind eye to rites associated with certain gods and goddesses who are regarded as part of Goltan's pantheon, but other faiths are strictly forbidden. Practicing the wrong religion can result in imprisonment, particularly if someone is suspected of actually spreading illegal teachings.\n\n** Magic **\n\nMagic exists throughout the world and can be mastered through diligent study, though some are born with greater innate talents for it than others. According to his propaganda, the Emperor himself is among the world's most powerful wielders of the arcane.\n\nThere are several varieties of magic. Some use it to bend the elements to their will. Others employ it to heal wounds and illnesses. Others can use it to see glimpses of the future or faraway places. Some say magic can even raise the dead. Most who practice magic tend to focus on a particular aspect, as it is nearly impossible to master a wide variety of spells.\n\nOnly the nobility and officially sanctioned imperial magi in service to the army are permitted to practice magic. For all others, the practice of magic is considered witchcraft, a very serious crime.\n\n** Crime **\n\nThe Goltannian justice system can be incredibly harsh. Long prison sentences are common even for minor offenses like petty theft. The system is also corrupt, allowing the wealthy and those who have the Emperor's favor to escape punishment for much more serious offenses.\n\nPart of the reason for these harsh laws is that prisoners are employed to keep the economy of the empire functioning. With a large portion of the empire's able bodied youth drafted into mandatory military service, prisoners are used as labor in the mines and fields, keeping the military supplied.\n\nOne small merciful side effect of this policy is that the death penalty is rarely used. After all, a dead man cannot provide valuable labor. Execution is generally limited to those deemed too dangerous to keep alive, such as powerful magic users or leaders of treasonous plots.\n\n** The Military **\n\nA military draft has been in effect across the Empire for the past five years. All able bodied individuals between the ages of sixteen and thirty are required to serve in the military. Nobles are exempt from this service, as are those wealthy enough to afford a rather substantial payment.\n\nAttempting to evade the draft or desertion from military service typically results in a lengthy imprisonment.\n\n** Last Comments **\n\nFeel free to message me with any questions. Special thanks to all the writers in both previous Dark Reapers stories. While this game does not take place in the same universe, the tone is very much inspired by those games.",

While many of these have established some semblance of order, with governments and cultures of their own, many more are practically lawless, a whole new wild west frontier.\n\nNo effective galaxy wide law enforcement organization of any kind exists. There are millions of places on hundreds of worlds for criminals and outlaws to hide from the grasp of authorities on the more established worlds. When particularly infamous criminals go on the run, the standard practice is for agencies to put out bounties for their capture and leave the matter up to freelancers.\n\nBounty hunting can now be a very lucrative career for those with the skills and bravery to pursue it.

Some have grown very wealthy by capturing high profile criminals, now hunting their quarries with the latest in military equipment and the most advanced models of starships.\n\nThe crew of the *Albatross* are not one of those wealthy, sophisticated crews. The *Albatross* itself is a thoroughly outdated model, originally built as a cargo hauler rather than any kind of fighter craft.
