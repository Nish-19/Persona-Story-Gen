        "story": "It's a beautiful day in Champion City. Nice cool weather, bright clear skies, air pollution levels rated as safely breathable. As the sun rises over the ocean, everything seems calm, peaceful, and tranquil despite the constant bustle of city life. Sadly, the tranquility is not to last. Vidscreens and radios across the city have their broadcasts interrupted by an urgent news bulletin. A frightened looking woman in a trench coat speaks into a microphone. \"This is Maria Hernandez reporting live for CNX News from outside the ToyTime Superstore in downtown Champion City.\" The sound of gunfire can be heard behind her, accompanied by flashes of light from inside the store. \"It appears that that the infamous criminal Thomas Tinker, AKA the Toymaster, has launched some sort of an assault here. We have reports he has taken several children hostage. At this point we don't know if his intent is to demand a ransom, or...\" The Toymaster is a name familiar to anyone who follows the news in Champion City. He's a criminal who uses an army of sophisticated automatons disguised as children's toys to carry out his evil schemes. It's unclear whether he actually has any real superpower allowing him control over these 'toys', or whether he's simply a deranged genius inventor of sorts. In the past he has generally limited his activities to robbery and burglary. Hostage taking is a new one. A SWAT officer dressed in full riot gear steps into the frame, shouting something at the reporter. He's too far from the microphone for his words to be intelligible. The camera begins to move away from the store as the sound of gunfire intensifies. \"We're being told we have to move back. Apparently some sort of machines are advancing out of the store and engaging with CCPD SWAT forces. We will continue to bring you coverage via CNX news drones.\" The reporter continues to speak into the microphone as she dashes down the street. \"With the Justice Squad out of state to assist in the battle against the forces of Scythe in Metro City, it's unclear whether non-powered law enforcement will be able to deal with this situation effectively.\" The reporter pauses, frowning and touching her earpiece. \"I've just gotten word that Mayor Fitzcurtis is calling for assistance from any and all freelance powered individuals. A bounty is being offered for the capture of Thomas Tinker...\" And that's the cue to come and save the day. The situation at ToyTime is chaotic. A small army of little green toy soldiers have been pouring out of the front entrance. Somehow, despite their diminutive size, they've been outfitted with actual working firearms. The bullets are small, but there's enough of them being fired to leave SWAT pinned down behind their armored van. Officers pop up from behind cover to return fire every so often, but there are simply too many of the little green men for them to handle without assistance. Inside the store, a group of crying children can be seen near the back wall. They're surrounded by a squad of very creepy looking Victorian dolls. The dolls hold squirt guns that look to be filled with some sort of horrible bubbling green acid, just waiting to open fire on the first do-gooders to try to make a rescue attempt. There's no sign of the Toymaster himself. Not yet, anyways. There must be hundreds of places he could be hiding inside the massive store, and searching for him could be dangerous. It's almost impossible to tell at a glance which toys on the shelves are harmless and which might be his sinister minions hiding in plain sight. The CNX News drones arrive before the heroes do. They're little more than cameras attached to whirling helicopter blades, flying about to try to get the best angle on the chaos. Whatever's going to happen, it's going to be broadcast live."

        "writing_prompt": "A twelve-year-old princess is set to be crowned queen under the watchful eyes of a controversial regency council, but whispers of unrest and conspiracy threaten to turn her coronation into a dangerous gamble. Will tradition prevail, or will caution reshape the future of the kingdom?",
        "story": "The king was buried on a grey autumn morning, with a light rain falling from the sky. The streets surrounding the royal cemetery were packed with mourners, many openly weeping at the sight of the casket and the accompanying procession conveying the monarch to his final rest. There was always a period of national mourning when a Versaillian king died. To appear unmoved by the passing of a monarch would be unseemly. One could tell by the mood in the air that this was something more than mourning for appearances' sake. Larvane XI was truly beloved by his people. He had brought decisive victory in battle over the Versaillians' most hated rivals, and given his life in the effort. One could be all but certain that history would remember him as more than a king. History would remember him as a national hero. In his final hours, the king had sent missives and made clear his wishes as to the matter of his succession. His sole surviving child, Crown Princess Elaia, was barely twelve years old. Crown law calls for a regent to be appointed until the reigning monarch reaches the age of sixteen. In the past, a single individual had generally been appointed to this post. It surprised many when Larvane chose to break with this tradition. Rather than a single regent, five were announced. They would serve as a ruling council for the next four years. Some members of this council came as little surprise to the public. Others were shocking, and led some to question whether the rumors of dark magic influencing the king might have had some truth to them. There was Duc Dionis De Varre, possibly the most wealthy and powerful man in the kingdom outside of the royal family. Many had speculated he would be chosen as regent prior to the announcement of a council, given his influence, staunch loyalty to the crown, and experience in administering a prosperous duchy. The appointment of Cardinal Hastings of Ascher was similarly unsurprising. The Grand Church held tremendous influence over Versaillia, and Larvane was always known as a pious man. Cardinal Hastings was ambitious and influential. Some whispered that he might even be a candidate for Grand Exarch, if he remains in good health when the current head of the Church passes. The appointment of Lord Commander Archibald Grant to the regency council was, perhaps, more surprising. Though none could doubt his brilliant tactical mind and the crucial role his leadership played in victory over Avalon, he had long been rumored to hold radical political views. Many suspected him of sympathizing with the agitators and would-be rebels whose activities were a constant nuisance in the capital. Some even whispered speculations that he may have had some role in the king's demise. Sir Aelyth Rainey was another surprising choice. Though she held the honorary title of knight, she was not a landed noble and had more experience with battle than matters of administration. Still, she was another national hero, and few doubted the wisdom of her inclusion. The most surprising announcement of all was the appointment of Venn Stelbrakk to the regency council, a man more commonly known by the nickname 'Grey Eyes'. Stelbrakk was a mere commoner without title to his name. His origins were a topic of wide speculation, with many rumoring that he was not even a native Versaillian. Still, he was a man of great power and wealth, wealth he had used to help ensure victory over Avalon by forming a mercenary company that joined the war at a crucial juncture. It was widely speculated that the inclusion of a commoner was meant to placate the increasingly loud calls for greater power to be placed in the hands of the lower classes. Time would tell whether it would prove effective. While the nation continued mourning, there was no time for the newly appointed council to wait before assuming their duties. The royal guard escorted them directly from the funeral to the Palace of Mirrors, where they were met by Armande Demarais, the Royal Cupbearer. Armande was a trusted associate of the king's, mostly charged with day to day management of the palace and the adjoining estates. Each member of the council was granted an expansive suite at the palace as their new home. Princess Elaia was secluded in mourning in the royal bedchamber which had been her father's. The chamber which had served as the main war room during the conflict with Avalon had been converted into a chamber for the council to meet and conduct business in. The massive round table was still covered in maps and charts, all drawn over with possible battle plans. Before dinner, the council gathered in their chambers for their first meeting. \"Lords and Lady Regent, if I may...\" Armande spoke as the regents entered. \"... Forgive me, I am certain there are many matters you must discuss, but I believe there is one issue that must be addressed immediately. The coronation.\" While Elaia will not rule with full authority until her sixteenth birthday, crown law calls for her to be coronated as Queen as soon as possible. A missive has already been sent to request the presence of the Grand Exarch, who has traditionally crowned the monarch of Versaillia. \"I must express my concerns.\" Armande continued. \"I realize that by tradition our kings and queens have always been crowned in Notre Nuit Cathedral, with a public procession both from and to the palace. I am concerned for Elaia's safety.\" \"While the period of mourning has calmed things somewhat, there has been much agitation in the capital in recent weeks. Food prices have been high ever since the war began, and we have had disturbances which have come dangerously close to riots at times. And... there are still those who whisper that certain parties... may have attempted to hasten the King's death.\" A brief flicker of sorrow crossed Armande's face, and he paused before he continued. \"Exposing the princess to the public appears to be simply too dangerous to me. If you but give the word, I can certainly make arrangements for the coronation to take place in the grand hall here at the palace. It would certainly be more secure.\" Armande bowed his head as he stepped towards the exit. \"I must see to preparations for dinner, and I fear I have taken much of your time already. Please let me know when you have reached a decision, and I shall make preparations.\" Armande is almost certainly right in that holding a coronation at the palace, without a public procession, would be much safer than the traditional cathedral ceremony. Still, it might send the public the message that the new queen is weak and fearful, or that the council themselves are. Others might also take the inference that having a coronation at the palace might be intended to signal that the new Queen views her authority as above that as the church. Some might view the move as being less than pious. This was, perhaps, a smaller matter than many of the grand issues of state that the council would soon need to tackle. Still, it was a decision that needed to be made right away. The kingdom could not go without a crowned monarch for long."

        "writing_prompt": "Awakened from cryogenic suspension decades later than planned, you and four other officers must choose the perfect landing site for humanity's new colony\u2014each option promising survival, but at a cost. What secrets might the planet hold, and will your decision unite or divide the future settlers?",
        "story": "Being revived from a lengthy cryogenic suspension was not unlike waking up after being under the influence of anesthetic. Everything felt vaguely unreal as the officers exited their life pods, needing a moment to get their bearings. Their muscles felt weak and sore, though probably not as bad as they should feel after decades of near total motionlessness. The calm, reassuring voice of the ship's Multipurpose Artificial Intelligence Administrator (usually referred to as 'Maia') spoke out once they were on their feet. \"Good morning. The Earth date is August 21, 2364.\" They'd been in suspension for over ninety years. \"Cryogenic revival protocol has been successfully executed. Please follow the illuminated lights to assist you in reaching the bridge.\" A path lit up to guide the officers to their destination. Along the way, it became obvious that something was wrong. The view ports did not show an alien world, but the darkness of space stretching out ahead. This was not right. No one except Captain Heng was supposed to be revived from suspension until the ship had landed on Epsilon Eridani e. Once the five officers had assembled on the bridge, Maia spoke again to clarify the situation. \"Greetings. We are currently in orbit around the colony world. Orbital scans and drone probes indicate that the intended planet has a breathable atmosphere and conditions capable of supporting human life. Gravity is approximately 0.96 the strength of Earth's, and temperature variance falls within acceptable limits.\" \"Unfortunately, I must report an incident which occurred during transit. Approximately thirty seven years, two months, five days, and seven hours ago, the *Hercules* collided with an unknown foreign object moving at a high velocity. This object caused a hull breach which briefly compromised life support systems. Repair protocols were able to seal the breach and restore full functionality. Unfortunately, the breach led to the deaths of one hundred and thirty four colonists, including Captain Lin Heng.\" Maia, lacking the emotional sensitivity to realize the gravity of what she just revealed, did not dwell on this point. She just continued right along with the business at hand. \"According to the colony charter, in the event of the Captain's death or incapacity, the Captain's authority is to be shared equally by those officers at the next level of the ship's hierarchy. Accordingly, this means that Stephen Sinclair, Simon Recolte, Tero Tupasela-Uusitalo, Hwang Seong-Hye, and Doctor Harold Mortimer are now the executive officers of this colony ship. I shall respond to any directive from three or more of you as if it came from the Captain.\" The bridge's monitors began to hum to life, illuminating the previously dimly-lit bridge. \"You have been revived now to carry out the first task which Captain Heng was to complete: the selection of a landing site at which to establish the new colony. After thorough scanning and probing of the planet, I have identified three possible sites which appear to be the closest matches to my parameters for an ideal human colony. You will need to select one before I can initiate landing protocol.\" The monitors now displayed an image from the planet below. It's a wide open field, covered in plant life that almost resembles grass with an oddly purple sort of coloration. Glimpses of creatures of some kind could be seen in the images, quadrupeds with thick, scaly hides shifting through the grass. A roaring river could be glimpsed cutting through the prairie. \"This is potential landing site A. Closest Earth analog: Rio Gallegos, Argentina. Temperature varies between 8.4 and 27.9 degrees Celsius. Advantages: preliminary analysis suggests the soil in this area is rich in nutrients which should support crop samples carried from Earth. Agricultural projects will be easily supported. Weather is within comfortable ranges. Presence of freshwater river will provide easily filtered drinking water. Disadvantages: Abundance of native life forms. Data is insufficient to determine whether or not these life forms could pose a danger to colonists. This site appears to lack any significant deposits of metals, mineral resources, or other materials necessary for large scale manufacturing or construction projects.\" The monitors shifted again. This time, they showed a sandy white beach, with a beautiful blue ocean lapping at the shore. A few plants resembling palm trees could be seen above the tide line, heavy with some sort of bulbous purple fruit. \"This is potential landing site B. Closest Earth analog: Nassau, Bahamas. Temperature varies between 18.2 and 36.1 degrees Celsius. Advantages: Inland areas suitable for agricultural production. Lack of large native animal life forms. Warm weather will reduce need to rely on artificial heating. Analysis suggests the area is likely to be considered aesthetically pleasing by colonists. Disadvantages: This site is located on a relatively small island. Aquatic transportation to other land areas will be necessary to expand colony substantially. Rainfall is frequent and abundant. Lack of metals and mineral resources. Energy-intensive desalination may be required to obtain drinking water during dry periods.\" The monitors changed their displays again. This time, they show a hilly expanse blanketed in snow. It was a somewhat surprising image after the more inviting images in the previous two displays. There were no signs of native life. \"This is potential landing site C. Closest Earth analog: Anchorage, United States. Temperature varies between -17.1 and 13.2 degrees Celsius. Advantages: Analysis shows this region contains abundant deposits of iron, copper, tungsten, titanium, and other mineral resources which could greatly aid in construction and manufacturing initiatives. Geological scanning further shows massive deposits of petroleum, located close enough to the planetary surface so as to be easily extracted. This could provide a reliable source of energy once the *Hercules'* fuel cells are depleted. Disadvantages: This site is not suitable for traditional agricultural programs due to the cold climate. The colony will need to rely on the ship's heated atrium for the production of food, which may not be adequate given the size of the colony. Cold temperatures and heavy snowfall may be unpleasant to the colonists.\" The monitors now changed, showing images from each site side by side. \"Once a selection is made, landing protocols can be initiated immediately. Once we have landed, I will proceed with the revival of the remainder of the colonists. As a reminder, lack of fuel resources will render the *Hercules* unable to lift off again once it has landed. Please inform me if I can be of any further assistance prior to the initiation of landing protocols.\" Just like that, the officers were thrown into command and left with what might be the most critical decision to be made to ensure their new colony's future. The fate of Captain Heng was enough of a shock, but now this? It would be up to them to make a decision and prepare for what lay ahead."

        "writing_prompt": "You\u2019re part of a night shift investigation team with just ninety minutes to solve a brutal alleyway murder before the case is closed for good. The victim, a sobbing witness, and a broken-down neighborhood hold the only clues\u2014how do you uncover the truth before time runs out?",
        "story": "The night shift. It starts at ten in the evening, ends at six in the morning. It's either the best or the worst shift to be on, depending on how you look at it. The world has changed a great deal over the past centuries, but one constant has endured: horrible things always happen at night. It's nearing midnight when the first major call of the evening goes out. A crew of five investigators are gathered up at the Central Precinct and loaded up into an OSS transport to go out on a call. The transports are all automated these days, which allows for the investigators to pay attention to their briefing along the ride. Commander Ashworth, supervisor to Central's night shift investigators, provides the briefing over the transport's video feed. He looks tired and irritated. He always looks tired and irritated. He spends a moment reviewing a datapad in his hands before he speaks. \"Okay. Looks like this is probably a homicide call. Body found in an alley off McAllister. Signs of foul play. Victim is a female in her early twenties. The body was found and called in by a local, should still be at the scene.\" \"Our client for this one is the Greater Civic Center Residential District. They're BronzeShield Plan subscribers.\" BronzeShield was the cheapest security plan OSS offered to residential areas. No patrols, no automated or live security, no investigations for petty offenses. Just about the only service covered under BronzeShield was limited investigation into serious crimes. Emphasis on limited. \"So, let's have a look at their time balance for the month...\" Commander Ashworth frowned at his datapad again. \"... Looks like you're budgeted for... ninety minutes on this one. No overtime, no equipment allowances.\" Ninety minutes to solve a homicide and make an arrest. It was an absurd time limit, really. Commander Ashworth just shrugged. \"Do your best. If you can find the guy and make an arrest, great. If not, well... maybe GCCRD will think about upgrading to SilverShield when their contract is up for renewal. Ashworth out.\" The video feed cut out just as the transport stopped at the alleyway entrance. The narrow alley was poorly lit, snaking between an old donut shop and a run down 'capsule living' residential building. The whole place was littered with trash and filth. It smelled like the kind of place the homeless tended to use as a restroom. The victim was slumped by a dumpster, face down on the pavement in a pool of blood. Blonde, likely early twenties, very much on the thin side. Judging from her clothing and the neighborhood, it seemed likely she was a prostitute. Standing by the body was another woman in similar attire, with green hair and violet eyes, almost certainly resulting from low level biological modification. She kept making horrible sobbing sounds, but no tears came. Loss of the ability to cry was a common side effect of cheap black market BioMods like hers. She seemed to freeze up when she caught sight of the transport. There were no other obvious witnesses around, though those willing to pay for window units in the capsule building might have been in a position to see something, if any of them were home, awake, and paying attention. The donut shop seems to be equipped with a security camera over the back entrance as an attempt to deter would-be burglars. If it's actually working, it might have caught footage of some of what happened here. Of course, the donut shop is closed for the night and won't be opening again until far more than the ninety minutes the team is budgeted for. Still, it might be possible to hack the camera remotely, or break into the shop to find the footage. Whatever the investigators were going to do, they were going to need to do it fast if they were going to have any chance of figuring out what happened here. The clock is already ticking."

        "story": "It's been a rough year for American Independent. Their last major feature, *Escape From Planet Robot*, was a dismal bomb. The picture didn't even recoup half of what it cost to make. For a time, it seemed all but certain that the studio was going to fold, closing their doors for good and ending the story of yet another small independent Hollywood film studio. Yet, it was not to be. With the acquisition of the studio by Sheryl 'Sissy' D'Angelo-Masters, American Entertainment had enough funding to finance one final feature. The budget would be minimal, and it was all but certain that the studio would close its doors for good unless they managed to turn a profit. Still, there was a chance. That was more than they seemed to have a month ago. So, on a cloudy January morning, American Entertainment's new studio head called together their best remaining talents for a meeting in her office next to Studio Three. Studio One, of course, had been unusable since the unfortunate fire during the filming of *I Married a Swamp Monster*. And Studio Two, well... the less said about what happened to Studio Two, the better. So, the group met in the Studio Three Office, a cramped, smoky, and dimly lit space. There was, of course, 'Sissy' D'Angelo-Masters herself, seated behind her weathered old oak desk. She'd called together the best talents still available to American Entertainment to work out a concept for their project, their possibly final attempt to keep the studio afloat. There was, of course, Arthur Preston. They didn't even have a concept yet, much less a script, yet he'd already been taken under contract and guaranteed a role as the leading man. He was by far the most famous actor willing to work with the troubled studio, an asset that they would need to make the most of if they were to have a chance at success. Sissy had insisted on taking him under contract. Then there was Norman Morris, already contracted to serve as the feature's director. Talented, hardworking, and willing to work for the pittance that American Entertainment could afford to pay a director. True, he'd never directed a full feature himself, but he'd done admirable second unit work on a number of successful features. Surely they could overlook his... oddities in exchange for his experience. Then there was their screenwriter, Roberta \"Bobbi\" Jamison. She'd never been properly credited in a film before, but those in the know realized that she was the real creative genius behind many of Indomitable Studios' best recent films. Now given creative free reign and a chance at a proper credit, they could only hope she would rise to the occasion. Last, but certainly not least, was child star Frankie Polk. Frankie had a reputation as being difficult to work with, even more so than your typical child actor. His tantrums had gotten so bad that the heads of several major studios had sworn off working with him. Still, he drew in the crowds, and was willing to work cheap. American Entertainment couldn't pass up the chance to hire him. Frankie, along with his parents and agents, were also invited to the meeting. The purpose of today's assembly was simple. This group needed to decide what, exactly, this picture they were going to film would be all about. This wasn't the time to flesh out the details of the plot. That would be Bobbi's job. They just needed to decide on a genre, some basic concepts, a hook to draw in the crowds. Any of them could make a pitch for an idea they were passionate about, though Sissy would ultimately be the one to make the final call. She was the one with the checkbook, after all. There were many possibilities. With Arthur Preston on board, a western would be an obvious choice. Arthur had made a name for himself as a star in several successful westerns, and Hollywood was close enough to the beautiful vistas of Monument Valley to make a location shoot feasible enough. That certainly wasn't the only option, though. The studio still had some props, sets, and costumes which survived the various disasters of *Escape From Planet Robot*. Science fiction pictures tended to draw on the crowds. The same could be said for horror movies. Universal's monster movies had enjoyed tremendous success. Or the studio could try something a little more ambitious and intellectual. Mystery melodramas, usually starring brooding detective types, the kinds of movies that pretentious film critics might call 'film noir', had achieved a fair amount of success recently. American Entertainment could try to cash in on that trend. Of course, this was a new creative team. They could always try something even bolder and less expected, diving fully into an artistic vision which no one would expect. Whatever they were going to do, they needed to decide today. Every day the studio went without another picture released, they were bleeding money. Now was the time for everyone to throw out whatever ideas they had, and for a decision to be made about just what sort of film they would be making together."

        "story": "The past five years had changed much at American Entertainment. Profits from *The Green Tide* had allowed the studio to refurbish their entire operation. The once struggling studio had been able to afford the latest equipment and finally outfit their offices in true Hollywood style, with few expenses spared. Yet not everything had changed. The offices at studio three remained the heart of American Entertainment. In the same room where *The Green Tide* was first conceptualized, the studio's creative team was once again due to meet to pitch their ideas for their next big project. Though the remodeling made the space seem a far cry from the smoky, crumbling office of yesteryear, there was more than a pinch of the old creeping sense of urgency and worry in the air. After the huge success of *The Green Tide*, many of the principles involved had gone on to seek other work. Mercurial director Norman Morris had refused to sign on for another feature, instead drifting from studio to studio producing a series of increasingly surreal films. Frankie Polk, having shed his formerly wholesome image, was now a teenage heartthrob and budding action star, a favorite of the big name studios. Even Sissy D'Angelo-Masters, still studio owner, had started taking a much more hands off role in the day to day management, a factor to which many attributed the decline of the studio. After *The Green Tide*, the studio had produced a series of films which, while occasionally making back their production costs, failed to bring in anything like the money or critical acclaim of their timeless classic. Now the funds were drying up, and that new state of the art equipment purchased five years ago wasn't quite so state of the art anymore. The studio needed a hit, and they needed it badly. And so, they gathered on a hot summer evening to dream up their next movie. There was Bobbi Jamison, the studio's long-contracted screenwriter, the one major player to have stayed with American Entertainment through thick and thin. Then there was her unrelated namesake, J. W. Jamison, the studio's most recently hired director. Then, there was the cast. Including them in these pitch meetings was now something of an American Entertainment tradition. Ben Rose and Katherine Chao were new faces to American Entertainment, but Sissy was taken with both of them. On one of her rare visits to the studio, she expressed confidence that the two Jamisons would find the right project for their talents, signing them to contracts before the feature was decided upon. Then there was the return of an old familiar face: Arthur Preston, star of *The Green Tide*. It had been years since he set foot on the premises of American Entertainment. Ever since his Oscar win, he'd been one of Hollywood's most in demand leading men. The studio just hadn't been able to afford the soaring salary he commanded now. Yet nevertheless, here he was. It was, perhaps, not the best time for an emotional reunion. This was to be a business meeting, after all. There would need to be introductions and pleasantries, but at the end of the night they were supposed to have an idea for a film. A daunting task."

        "story": "It began like any other day in the empire's dungeons. The prisoners were woken well before dawn, pulled from their cramped cells and stuffed into equally cramped wagons to be hauled off to their day's labor. All the while the watchful eyes of the guards were upon them, ready to unleash their particularly harsh brand of discipline at the first sign of trouble. It soon became apparent that something was different today. Normally it only took a few minutes for the prisoners to be brought to their work site. On good days, they toiled in the fields outside the prison walls, taking the place of farmers drafted into the imperial military. On bad days they suffered in the dark and dusty mines in the nearby hills, backbreaking labor in near total darkness. Today, the wagons were taking them someplace else. Someplace further. A trip that should have taken minutes instead dragged on for hours. The chains and manacles placed on the prisoners for the journey were incredibly uncomfortable over such lengthy travel. Any questions posed to the guards were either ignored or met with threats. It was nearly midday when the wagons finally stopped and the prisoners were pulled out into the sun. They were in the hills above a picturesque valley, with a river stretching on below. A tall tower on a hilltop ahead was the only notable landmark in the area. It had a strange construction, with wide arches and struts that seemed to serve no obvious architectural purpose. To those familiar with such things, it seemed like the sort of building which might have been designed to channel arcane energy. The stonework was old, and looked to be in poor repair. Twenty prisoners were gathered in front of the tower, now surrounded by the prison guards. A familiar yet unexpected figure emerged from the front wagon: Warden Kroel, the prison's master. He smiled cruelly as he looked over the confused group of inmates. \"We have a little change of pace today.\" The Warden began. \"A special assignment in service to the Emperor. You should all count yourselves lucky for being selected.\" The Warden pointed towards the crumbling tower. \"This is the former residence of the traitorous warlock and thief known as Isander. He was found guilty of no less an offense than theft from the imperial family itself.\" \"The Emperor, in his wisdom, was willing to show mercy to even a man as foul as this, if only he would return that which he stole. Yet the fool would not, and he paid with his life.\" \"Imperial mages have identified this as the place where he was hiding the item he stole from the Emperor. Your task is to retrieve it.\" One of the prisoners, a dwarven woman with a suspicious scowl, spoke up. \"What? Can't the army do that? Or your guards? Why us?\" \"Because it's a wizard's tower.\" Grumbled an elf standing nearby. \"Probably full of traps and magic. Or worse. It's a suicide mission. They think we're expendable.\" \"Screw that.\" The dwarf spat. \"Take me back to the mines.\" The warden gestured to a guard standing near the dwarf, who promptly struck her in the back of her head with the hilt of his sword. The dwarf swore loudly in response. \"I can see motivation is going to be an issue.\" Warden Kroel remarked, sounding amused. \"Well, you will all be pleased to know that there will be a reward. A substantial reward, in fact. By special imperial decree, I am authorized to offer clemency to those who retrieve the emperor's stolen property. Your sentences will be substantially reduced if you meet with success. Why, you could be home with your families tomorrow.\" Many of the prisoners seemed quite impressed with this offer, their eyes lighting up with hope. Others were clearly skeptical. There was always some catch to offers like these whenever the empire was involved. \"The item in question is a purple crystal, about the size of a man's thumb. It glows faintly.\" The elf raised an eyebrow. \"Glows? So it's magical? What does it do.\" \"You needn't concern yourself with that.\" Kroel responded. \"Just find it and bring it to me. Now, we'll be breaking you into groups to search the tower. We expect it will be more efficient that way.\" \"Of course we'll be removing your chains. I'm sure I don't need to remind any of you what the penalties for attempting escape are. We will be watching the tower very closely while you conduct your searches.\" The guards began assembling the prisoners in small groups, keeping a close eye as they approached to unchain them. The elf spoke out again. \"Wait. You're just unchaining us and sending us in there? You know it's going to be dangerous. Aren't you going to give us... I don't know. Weapons? Supplies?\" The Warden laughed dismissively. \"You think I'm going to give weapons to the likes of you? How foolish do you think I am?\""

        "writing_prompt": "A bounty hunting crew crash-lands near a pirate hideout after their plan goes awry, facing a rocket-wielding demolitions expert, a reckless pilot on a weaponized cycle, and a stealthy hacker lurking in the shadows. How do they turn the tables before it\u2019s too late?",
        "story": "It was supposed to be an easy job. The crew of the *Albatross* had gotten a very promising tip from an old contact that owed one of them a favor. He knew where to find the Red Star Gang, a trio of small time smugglers recently turned to piracy. According to their source, they'd set up a hideout in the ruins of a crashed Eridani Dominion battlecrusier in the dunes of Ayao, a sparsely inhabited and lawless desert world outside the borders of any major galactic government. The Eridani authorities were offering reasonably hefty bounties for all three of the Red Star Gang: fifty thousand NuCreds apiece, plus an additional fifty thousand as a bonus if all three were brought in alive. That kind of payday could keep the crew fed and the ship fueled for the better part of a solar year. They came up with a simple plan: swoop down out of orbit right above the derelict ship, disable the pirates' own spacecraft with a few quick shots from the *Albatross'* dorsal autocannon, then threaten the entire gang into surrendering without a fight. Easy. Sadly, the tipster neglected to mention that the Red Star Gang had gotten some of the old wrecked battlecruiser's ship-to-ship weapons back online. The *Albatross* had barely entered Ayao's atmosphere when a powerful plasma bolt ripped through the hull. It was hardly the worst damage the ship had suffered in its troubled existence, but it was enough to take the autocannon offline and force an emergency landing about half a kilometer from the pirate base. The crew was lucky enough to endure the bumpy landing with nothing worse than a few bruises and scrapes. The Red Star Gang didn't seem inclined to let the *Albatross* get away with minor damage. Only a few seconds after the landing, a deafeningly loud explosion rang out just a few dozen meters from the craft, blasting a new crater into the dunes and spraying the hull with a shower of sand. The explosion was followed by crazed laughter from one of their targets: Bartholomew Reinoff, better known as 'Bloody Bart', one of the Red Star Gang. A former mercenary demolitions expert, he was toting some sort of massive rocket launcher that looked like it was originally meant to be strapped to a vehicle rather than wielded by a single individual. He was shouting something that was probably some sort of taunt or threat, but was impossible to hear over the din of the explosion. The noise only grew worse as some sort of heavily modified UltraCycle tore out of the hideout hangar, making a beeline for the *Albatross* seated atop it was their second target: Carlotta Enkov, 'Crazy Carly'. Carly was a former military scout, now serving as pilot for the gang. Ignoring the explosions ringing out throughout the dunes, she sped forward towards the *Albatross* and began wildly firing bullets from her cycle-mounted submachine gun, aiming for structural weaknesses in the downed craft. There was as of yet no sign of Ayako Kasumi, the supposed leader of the gang. That wasn't surprising, but it was worrying. 'Shadow' was their infiltration specialist, a stealthy hacker rumored to have previously been employed as a spy for one military agency or another. She was probably relying on the other two to serve as a distraction while she got in position to do real damage. The *Albatross* had lost the element of surprise and the use of their most powerful weapon, but they still had their wits and numerical superiority. They'd make it through this okay. Right?"
