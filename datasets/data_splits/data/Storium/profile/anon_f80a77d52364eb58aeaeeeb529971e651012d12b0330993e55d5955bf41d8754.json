Everything is silent, nothing is moving and you cannot remember anything, blackness is all you awaken from, no dreams, no memories, no idea what has happened in the past few days\u2026\n\n(-) (-) (-)\n\nPremise: You and a group of survivors have find yourself in the abandoned Lewisham Hospital and there is an unknown, evil presence in the air. A mixture of 28 Days Later, Resident Evil and Dawn of the Dead, the story will start with a small group and slowly grow as people explore the desolate and destroyed remains of London, no one will really recall what happened or how but they all know they have to get out of London\u2026 Fast. People can and will die, only if they agree too, NPC\u2019s will die, lots of action, lots of challenges and lots of cards. Hopefully leading to some interesting dilemmas and situations. (Threat will be decided as I write, maybe zombie, maybe something along the lines of The Last of Us).\n\nTo begin with I will be accepting 2-3 players as the original hospital survivors (Apart from these you can create your own natures, strengths, weaknesses, and sub-plots). Pictures are a must for cards where it is applicable as I believe it adds more depth.  Hospital Characters do not have to use the pre-made cards but they give a general jist of the idea.\n\nWriting will be centred on Third Person and I would like a high level of interactivity between player characters, NPC\u2019s and myself \u2013 If you have some reservations about people using your characters of course I will be using revisions where there are issues. \n\nTimestamps shall be essential for posts:\n\nFor instance\n\n4:30 am \u2013 Monday \u2013 My House",

Earth is now an unrecognisable husk, the rampant overpopulation and industrialisation that had begun in the early nineteenth century is now at a crisis level. The oceans are higher than ever, dirty and polluted, many of Earth\u2019s many unique animals have died due to the rapid change in climate, vegetation and air quality. Earth\u2019s bountiful resources that had, for so long, been the source of conflict and death were now at their very last reserves, people were desperate for an alternate solution to the depravity and desolation that the Earth had become.\n\nThe ESA set up a bold program to recruit the best and brightest from around the globe to accelerate the aging space program that had been scrapped years ago to try and solve Earth\u2019s problems without extrasolar influence. The project has been running for twenty years now and the future of humanity now relies in the spaceship *Revelation*. *ESF Revelation* and her future sister ships *Redemption* and *Righteousness* are humanities first foray into colonising the sol system and the wider galactic front around them. Technological advancements in propulsion, atmospheric calibration, communications, weaponry, medicine and science as a whole had allowed the ESA to consider the launch of *Revelation* in 2142. \n\nYou have all been selected from the masses on Earth to represent one of the final chances for humanity to survive within the Sol System and the wider galaxy before Earth is broken so badly that no-one could live there\u2026\n\n(-) (-) (-)\n\nPace: Fast to Daily (I would like to get a 2 scenes done a week, minimum.

Being free from the shackles of bureaucracy and democracy, however, was always an uncertain path that could be manipulated by anyone who wanted to centralise more power within the Human Empire and, after nearly fifty years of \u2018protection\u2019, the organisation soured.  The Human Expanse of Space had been subject to many terrorist acts from humanists and environmentalists who opposed the continued exploitation of the Galaxy, after the devastation of Earth from global warming and depleting the planets fauna and flora. The GDM had crushed these threats with ease, a strong and capable force with separate funding and unlimited access to internal and external records, leading to a pioneering *safe* human space which allowed trade, industry and colonisation to flourish. The GDM secured wealthy contracts from the most scrupulous of companies: mining conglomerates, terraforming companies and colonial outposts all snapped up the oppressive security force to practically enslave their workforces and populaces.\n\nThe GDM now commands the largest fleet of private military space vehicles and rumours abound that, if the Human Enclave had to go to war with the GDM, it would lose. *But why would anyone worry about that? They are **protecting** us?* The media relations department at the GDM has outwardly convinced many of the masses that aren\u2019t oppressed by the GDM and benefit from the industries it protects that the GDM is the most successful and reliable security force for humanity and that it can be *fully* trusted. This had led to an odd disparity that bubbles below the surface of the Human Empire and the GDM, those who hate the oppressive GDM and it\u2019s exploitative ways and those who chose to ignore the GDM and profit from the added security and the extensive financial benefits of those who are exploited.\n\nThis is where *you* come in. You find yourself aboard the fearsome GDM Corvette *Bastion* which is tasked with transporting a wide variety of miners, colonists, prisoners, and many more, to the frontier. *Bastion* is a fearsome vessel, with the best track record in the fleet, and led by the brutal Commander Rahneki who has a zero-tolerance policy towards any infraction on GDM protocols. Several transported persons have mysteriously *vanished* aboard his vessel for disobedience or revolution \u2013 one such victim was found drifting in the Pursean Nebula by a scouting vessel seven months later. Whatever your backstory, you know that this trip to the colony Huerta would only lead to your probably enslavement or abandonment on the fringe of the known galaxy. A fate that no-one wants in these prosperous times. To change your fate, however, you know that you are going to have enact a *mutiny*\u2026\n\n(-) (-) (-)\n\n**Application:** I have made a few basic cards, but any applicants may feel free to create any new cards that they desire.\n\nI will not be operating on a first come first serve system and will be waiting to acquire a number of applications and selecting the best from those available.\n\n**Pacing**: I will be operating on a *daily* pace.
