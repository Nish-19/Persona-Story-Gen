        "story": "**Lewisham University Hospital Emergency Room (Ground Floor) 09:00 - Wednesday 20th August 2015** The resounding bellows of silence rang through the usually chaotic Emergency Room of Lewisham University Hospital. Plastic sheeting, draped across the doorways and walls, flapped gently in the breeze left by several holes in the automatic glass doors. Harriet Haynes lied in the middle of the Emergency Room waiting area, the variety of green leather benches around the room were either out of alignment or completely overturned. One of the overhead lights sparked in a desperate attempt to cast more light into the room, Harriet can taste the stale blood in her mouth and felt the pound of a headache emerging in her brain **Lewisham University Hospital Intensive Care Room 4B (4th Floor) 09:05 - Wednesday 20th August 2015** The petite and frail body of Carrie Emery lies in a sophisticated and high-tech Intensive Care Unit on the fourth floor of the Lewisham University Hospital. To the last of Carries memory, her visit at the hospital was to meet her miraculous oncologist Dr Emma Herscht who, for all intents and purposes, had saved her from almost certain death. Now, however, Carrie could feel the sophisticated orthopaedic mattress underneath her, the tight sheets of the bed keeping her almost rigidly in place. The ward seemed a world away from the Emergency Room mere feet below her, the beds next to her were untidy and empty but, apart from a critique of the cleaning in the hospital, the ward seemed fine. Across the small corridor between the beds, Carrie could see the outline of a fellow patient on her ward. The outline of Ellen Mignola appeared to be a lot more comfortable in her own bed, draped by the same light blue and white sheets and blankets. Ellen appeared to feel Carries stare and began to stretch under the covers and yawn audibly in the silent ward. The doors to the outer corridor and freedom, however, were coded shut, red lights on the keypad indicating to her that they were in here for a reason. Outside, the plastic sheeting is draped across the windows, a large yellow banner cross the translucent material. Suddenly, Carrie didnt feel confused, more panicked. The panic increased as she realised, from a dull thudding pain in her wrist, that one arm was zip locked to the metal arm of the bed **Lewisham University Hospital Staff Room (3rd Floor) 09:00 - Wednesday 20th August 2015** One floor below, in one of the back corridors of the administrative area of the hospital, the wind continues to filter in through the windows, fluttering the plastic blinds that obscure the rising sun from the room. Beige carpet and white walls accurately portray the functionality of the Staff Room. Several worn grey sofas, an aging television hoisted on the wall and a line of vending machines dominate the room before a small door leads to the on-call room with a small bed and shower room. Led in the middle of the floor, spread eagled, are the outlines Doctor Steven Sharpe and hospital security guard Carson Mathews. Both have the familiar tang of blood in their mouths and can feel the bruises on their skulls rising almost instantaneously as their eyes begin to blink back into life"

        "writing_prompt": "As Earth teeters on the brink of collapse, the crew of the *ESA Revelation* prepares to embark on humanity's most ambitious mission: finding a new home among the stars. But with tensions high, untested technology, and the weight of Earth's survival on their shoulders, will they rise to the challenge\u2014or crumble under the pressure?",
        "story": "The command deck of the *ESA Revelation* glittered under the filtered sunlight that streamed through the unshielded windows of the vast room. The surfaces and panels of the room were bedecked in the colours of the Earth Space Agency, aquamarine and silver, the entire deck was a technological marvel for a humanity that was on its last legs. Down on the surface, visible from the starboard windows, the torture of unshackled globalisation and pollution on the Earth had finally forced the Earth to fight back. The seas were rising at an astounding rate, global temperatures soared and the cyclical nature of Earths weather was now replaced with antagonistic random acts of destruction. Several areas once famous on Earth were now desolate, over populated husks that were only home to those most desperate. New York, once the jewel in the crown of the United States now lays in ruin. Three foot of water now covers the famous streets of Broadway, Wall Street and Fifth Avenue; the water inviting disease and famine to those who remained in the abandoned buildings that used to signify humanities progress. Many of humanities nations in the past have expanded and changed beyond recognition but the Earth Space Agency is a global hope to find a solution to a problem that Earth simply cannot solve. There simply isnt enough resources or space to house the population that is now running fully unchecked, even Earths worst disasters and diseases are not stopping the constant erosion of man. The clock is ticking for the Earth when everything runs outs, and it is desperately low on time now, the last of humanity will turn on each other until nothing remains. The Earth Space Agency was founded, with funding from all members of the fragile United Nations, to combat this problem with the single biggest undertaking in human history. Space. The idea that a similar garden world to Earth is out there in the galaxy had been around for hundreds of years, they just needed to improve the technology to allow an expedition to leave *quickly*. The year is now 2142, forty years of development and building connected to abandoned International Space Station had led to this moment, the *Revelation* was the first in trio of ships planned and funded by the ESA. Her sister ships *Righteousness* and *Redemption* were on schedule but were constantly plagued by problems as they were joint projects with client nations. The aim was that the three ships would be able to find a suitable planet within time and establish a colony before signalling back to Earth to send refugees, each ship would have roughly eight hundred passengers excluding crew who would be pioneers. Therefore, the ships were gigantic compared to previous human space endeavours with a combined population of nearly one thousand with their own botanic gardens, water reclamation facilities, fully stocked hospitals, security forces and fighter protection squads. The central space of the Command Deck was dominated by a large enlightened dais that housed the holographic projector for the on board ship AI, known as CHRIS, although the AI could communicate through any of the screens and speakers aboard the Revelation, this central command was most usual for crew meetings. Around the central projector there were several smaller daises, each dedicated to their respective head of department. In front of the central command unit was the captain and vice captains high backed leather chairs that could swivel to the wide screens to see their targets or sweep back to liaise with the heads of departments. Each Head of Department was at their command dais as the Overseer and Pilot strode into the room with a mixture of confidence and bravado, the pair couldnt be any dissimilar in age or demeanour but they both oozed confidence this morning. The Commander and Executive Officer rose from their chairs as the aging Overseer summoned all the officers in front of the AI projector. Power on. Good morning CHRIS. The Overseers voice was croaky but stern, he looked like he hadnt slept in weeks. The large, faint humanoid, face materialised in front of the group as the Overseer turned to them. Gerald McDermott was a seasoned veteran within the ESA, he had been on the original commission who oversaw the go ahead of the project and had been *heavily* involved ever since some even said he was too interfering. Good morning ladies and gentlemen, as you know this morning the last of your passengers boarded from Earth. We know that this will be a testing and unknown mission and the strains put upon you as heads of departments is immense but I want you all to know that the ESA will be monitoring and assisting you all in any way that it can. He paused and drank from the coffee he held in his tight grasp. Earth is dying my friends, we all know this. We all know you have suffered or experienced the growing overpopulation and resource shortage that is crippling our once beautiful Earth. The heavy burden of finding our new Eden now lays on your shoulders, I have every faith in you and so does the entire ESA. Before you depart, however, we need to make sure that every aspect of the ship is in full working order and fully efficient. I will be performing a tour of the ship in each of your departments and inspecting your full company of staff, facilities and protocols. Any questions? He finished his speech with a wry smile. The Overseer was about to take another sip of his coffee when he noticed the pilot stood beside him and began to speak again. Randy Linkwater was a decorated pilot on Earth serving in the North American Federation Air Force for three years and gaining much experience in their disputes with *La Regin Espaola* that border them. He had a notorious reputation of taking risks and pushing his craft to the very limit but he was also renowned for his skill and ability. I almost forgot. Gerald said briskly. This is Randy many may have heard of him on Earth, La Roja Pass was an unbelievable feat of skill for a pilot on Earth and he has been granted the honour to serve as your helmsman. I am sure he will be excited to meet you all. He gestured to Randy, who was adored in a full flight suit completed with a cheeky grin upon his pale face. Hey dudes, he paused to look at the girls with an eager eye and dudettes. The Overseer rolled his eyes behind him"

        "writing_prompt": "Lord Bannock has reluctantly agreed to let his adventurous daughter follow in her late mother\u2019s footsteps, but only under the protection of a team of handpicked explorers. As the final five candidates arrive at his estate, each with their own mysterious past and unique skills, tensions rise\u2014especially with a butler determined to sabotage the plan. What secrets and dangers will this unlikely group uncover?",
        "story": "Lord Bannock relaxed in his study, an opulent book-lined room filled with leather chairs and mahogany furniture and the smell of history. A large cigar was clasped in one hand and, as he took a long drag, a small trail of smoke rose to the corniced ceiling and hung there, mingling with the chandelier, and giving the entire room a thoroughly eighteenth century feel. He wrapped his free hand on the large desk beside him, he was still not sure whether this venture was the best idea for him or, more importantly, for his daughter but, as he had always known, she *always* got her own way. Who could judge a father for giving his daughter everything when he had the finances and influence to provide it? Arthur Bannock was a renowned name in England. He, and his sadly departed wife Margery, had been one of the most influential power couples in the world of antiquities and politics for the past thirty years. They had travelled the world with the aim of achieving true greatness, from the deepest forests of Argentina to the desolate wastes of Transylvania, they had done all of their exploring together and had become insanely rich from their treasures and their memoirs. Then, as they were about to go on a tour of Egypt, Margery announced that she was pregnant with their first, and ultimately only, child Madeline who had changed everything between them. Margery would not have sacrificed the child for her career but, upon Madelines birth, Arthur was forced to become a stay at home dad whilst her mother continued on her journey to explore the mysteries that the Earth still hid from her population. Dividing their lifes mission had always led to arguments whenever Margery was at home and then, after Madelines seventh birthday, she disappeared. Margery had been on a tour of the East Indies when she never returned, much to the devastation of Arthur and his daughter, despite their arguments she was always part of him. It was now twelve years later and Madeline, recently nineteen, wanted to set out on her own journey of discovery in this vast and untapped world that we all inhabit. In the beginning, Arthur had vehemently denied his daughter those dreams of exploration, fearing for her safety and that he would lose his only family member in the same vein as he dearly departed wife. Madeline was a girl of strong beliefs, however, and she declared that this was the only thing she wanted to do with her life, pursue her mothers passion, and Arthur knew, much like when he and Margery first announced they were going to become explorers with much ridicule from both their families, once you had the passion it was *very* hard to resist it. Lord Arthur would have loved to have joined his daughter on the journeys he could never accomplish when he was raising his daughter but, alas, his health and profession limited him now. At 72, Lord Bannock was nowhere near agile or spritely and despite his lordship being a ceremonial role in parliament, he still enjoyed the occasional issue to debate when he wasnt managing his antique businesses. He had decided to implore the best and brightest he could find, via the newspapers and internet, to arrive at his house today and convince him that a party of them could achieve the two things he desired. One, to protect his precious daughter and, Two, give the adventure of a lifetime and find some truly unique treasures. His connections and finances had made many apply but, after a week of deliberations, the final five are arriving at the house to meet them today. Father? Madelines fragile voice loomed into the room as she entered. Madeline was a magnificently pretty young lady, in Arthurs thoroughly biased opinion, and she knew that she could have the easy settled life in the English countryside if she chose it. Long brown hair draped her slender frame and sparkling blue eyes. Her pale skin was dotted lightly with freckles and her sparkling smile dominated her well-proportioned face. Her gleaming teeth glinted as she spotted her father behind the desk. There you are! She exclaimed and she gave him a quick hug. Those are not good for you, you know. She chastised him with a cheeky glare. I know, I know my darling but my nerves are tingling. I cant believe today may be the start of your adventure. His voice trembled slightly as he said it, he was more than nervous, more than scared. Dont worry father, I am sure those you have selected will be more than ample to protect me from the world. She soothed gently pouring him a glass of strong brandy and placing it in his free hand. They are arriving sir! The crisp voice of the Butler bellowed up the stairs through the open door of the study as the sound of tyres crunching the white gravel of the drive began to sound through the windows. Thank you Kenneth, Arthur replied Make sure that they are ready for the meeting! Arthur took a large gulp of the glass and it seemed to immediately steady his nerves as his daughter sat beside him. Kenneths face hardened as he saw the cars arrive, he knew that this was a bad idea, he didnt want Lord Bannock to be hurt again by the gallivanting ideals of the women in his life Kenneth wasnt going to let this explorers in without a fight."

        "writing_prompt": "Aboard the *GDM Bastion*, a ship of unyielding efficiency and fearsome reputation, tensions simmer as the crew and captives alike endure the iron rule of Captain Victor Rahneki. In the stillness of the Purusean Veil, where the captain reflects on his violent past, whispers of rebellion begin to stir\u2014will the ship's perfect order shatter, or will the captain's grip tighten further?",
        "story": "**Friday 19th November 22:37 GST GDM Bastion Command Deck** The *GDM Bastion* continued to lurch through the Purusean Viel with a fast, efficient spirit that was the motto of the Galactic Defence Movement. *To Protect Humanity With The Efficiency They Deserve*. The *Bastion* was the heaviest corvette in its *Beijing* Class but it was still spritely. It continued to be one of the most efficient and reliable ships with the GDMs Outer Rim Task Force with completion rate of 98.7%. The 1.3% discrepancy was only due to mechanical fault never human or logistical, the Captain always made *sure* of that. The *Bastion* was *vast* for a corvette class, it had several decks each dedicated to its own speciality. Command, Medical, Colony, Science, AI Core, Mechanical, Prison and Cargo Hold. The many people who were held aboard the *Bastion*, either with or without their consent, find that the ship is one of the most efficient and high-tech ships within the fleet and a thoroughly pleasant transport ship. Unless, that is, you are a prisoner confined to the disgusting Prison Deck that has purposefully been left, un-upgraded, since the *Bastion* first entered service. Similarly, the *Bastion* may seem slightly *overbearing* for those who do not appreciate the constant, vigilant forces of the GDM patrolling the winding corridors of the ship with violent eyes and itchy trigger fingers. Contrastingly, the Purusean Veil was a beautiful place. A vast, open nebula full of clashing, vibrant colours with very little else for the ship to concern itself with. No asteroid belts, no space-stations, no gravitational pulls or anomalies for several thousand miles and, for the crew, this was the easiest part of the journey. Of course, the *Bastion* did *not* have to stop here every time the ship made its faithful endeavour to the furthest reaches of Human Controlled Space but it always did at the behest of its Captain. Captain Victor Rahneki lounged in his robust leather captains chair and continue to view the picturesque view from the large forward observation station. Captain Rahneki was an imposing man, at least six foot three and comprehensively rippling in muscle, his dark skin seemed to struggle to be contained under his GDM Captains uniform. His face was stern and unrelenting, harsh grey eyes, a chiselled chin and thin lips that all shared a thin scar that trailed down the left half of his face. That scar was the last time an enemy of the Captain had been able to lay a finger on him, and the scar was a miniscule price to pay for the suffering that the Captain would later inflict on his enemy. Victor always took six hours out of the precise, GDM approved, timetable to observe the brilliance of the Veil as a form of vigil to those he had killed over the years. He was sure that in a few more years he would need far more than six hours to reflect. The *Bastion* was known for being the harshest ship in the GDM fleet. Victor had personally jettisoned anyone who had interrupted his perfectionist plans regardless whether it was a prisoner, crew or a colonist. Victor had no time to pander to those who could not keep to schedules, obey the rules or respect the GDM. Victor knew the horrors before the GDM. The unrelenting terrorism, the inability to travel in space without fear and the constant threats of the pirates and scaremongers. Victor knew that the GDM was the **only** answer to the threat, much more than the weak remnants of the Human Empire. He would support the GDM until the end and use the *Bastion* as his will until the last breath left his body. Throughout the *Bastion* those captives or employees currently have the six hours as downtime, a brief respite on the relentless journey to the edge of the galaxy. Resentment amongst the crew at the captain and the other passengers towards the GDM continued to boil below the surface. The taste of revolution was almost in the air"

        "writing_prompt": "Forty-five years after Commander Shepard's mysterious disappearance, the galaxy is still rebuilding, and the SPECTRE program has been opened to all races to restore order. At a grand Citadel gathering, you, a promising SPECTRE candidate, are tasked with navigating the room of diplomats, soldiers, and reporters\u2014unaware of the announcement that will change everything.",
        "story": "**Prologue** The Citadel Tower was still in the midst of its repairs when the SPECTRE candidates were summoned to the councils private chambers. Keepers continued to flit between the panels on the walls, to maintain air pressure, humidity and a variety of other atmospheric variables, to the many areas that were still under active construction. Crews from all across the galactic community were converging on the Citadel in a show of galactic togetherness and workmanship. The Citadel may have been moved to Earth during the desperate final fight between the Reapers and the galactic alliance but it was now restored to its rightful place in Widow and everyone who had benefitted from the end of the Reaper purge, nearly everyone, was happy to assist in the Citadels restoration. It had been forty-five years since the last known sighting of Commander Shepard, she had vanished through the Beta relay with a stern warning of Do Not Follow before she obliterated the relay with a charge. Many myths and legends had circulated the galactic community whilst the rebuilding continued over the next forty years. Had she been corrupted by the power of the Reapers? Was she sealing them out a last resort to stop them returning? Was she merely building power, hidden behind the destroyed relay? No one dared venture near to her vanishing point, especially at this time of turmoil. The rebuilding phase may have been a galactic, communal effort on the Citadel but all of the home systems in the galaxy were left to fend for themselves. It had been a long, and hard, struggle to establish authority even in their own systems for the Galactic Council members. Fighting the twin snakes of piracy and autonomy that the Reaper invasion had spread had been an almost impossible task, considering the many systems and colonies of the galaxy. The non-council members faced worse isolation, the Quarians, Geth, Hanar, Drell, Krogan and Batarians were in an odd situation of stasis. Their home worlds were safe but the vast voids between them and the Citadel were still harbouring the many remaining threats to Galactic Security. Galactic Council Space was only a tenth of its pre-Reaper size and the Citadel Council fleet was at less than twenty-five percent of full strength. It was these stark facts, and the fact that the Galactic Council was now realising that that the monopoly of the Big Four was quickly eroding, that forced the Galactic Council to act. The SPECTRE program, the elite espionage and tactical arm of the Citadel, was opened to all races to allow feelings of galactic togetherness to flourish. The new SPECTRE program had been running for the past twenty years, with experienced tutors from all races encouraging a new breed of SPECTRE to combat the piracy and uncontrolled madness that the rebellious sectors bred. One month ago, the Galactic Council summoned some of the best and brightest prospects within the organisation to a special dinner at the Citadel Tower. The four heads of the Galactic Council were assembled at the top table; the room was bustling with high level diplomats, soldiers, tutors and reporters. The announcement would be made soon but, for now, all you have to do is mingle"
