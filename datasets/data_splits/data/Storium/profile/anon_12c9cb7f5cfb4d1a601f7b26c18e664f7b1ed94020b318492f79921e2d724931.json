On the island were ancient creatures, beasts from times long past that had evolved in the harsh and wild environment of the island when all other species had died. Dinosaurs, enormous species of insect and other, older beasts.\n\nThrough the expedition, Denham captured and brought back a gigantic species of gorilla known as Kong for the world to marvel at. In New York, Kong escaped from captivity and, deemed a danger, was shot by airplanes. Kong was considered the last of his kind.\n\nEight years have passed since then. The second World War has begun and the people are unsure as to what will happen.\n\nSince Denhams expedition, only a few expeditions have been launched to the Island. However, many are too afraid to step foot on the edifice, frightened of the creatures and beasts that roam the isle.Intelligent people wouldn't toy around with long extinct species and ancient dinosaurs.\n\nToo bad you took this job.\n\n*This game is more based on the Peter Jackson film than the Monsterverse, just so you know that off the bat. :) )* ",
