When the letter from Lord Kingsley arrived at your office \u2013 you couldn't believe your luck. An expedition to a far flung locale in search of a vaunted local treasure seems almost too good to be true \u2013 especially given your reputation. The collection of explorers and 'experts' summoned to Lord Kingsley's estate were in desperate need of redemption. Bankruptcy, outrage, theft. Slanderous terms and whispered conspiracies followed each explorer around the globe with vicious intensity. Lord Kingsley, however, required not the best explorers in the world but those who would not waver from his quest. Redemption was a powerful motivator and Lord Kingsley, with his wealth and influence, knew the explorers would relish his backing to clear their name. He also knew, like anyone with an addiction, that these explorers would want to scratch the itch with One Last Adventure...",

            "story_name": "**Looking for new characters!**\n\nThe year is 2183 and humanity is at the breaking point. It has been hundred years since the governments of Earth finally accepted that their actions over decades and, in some circumstances, centuries had stripped Mother Earth of her fertility, her resources and her longevity. Industrialisation, Urbanisation, Globalisation and Overpopulation were four words that humanity had celebrated as a sign of humanities strength. Humanity had conquered the Earth from the animals that they had hunted to near extinction or enslaved for humanities gain.  The governments of the world, united in a central body named the Earthen Space Force, announced that the Earth was no longer sustainable or salvageable. The oceans were dying, the temperature was rising and overpopulation was causing diseases to rapidly spread and mutate beyond medical control. \n\nIt has been eighty years since the largest Atlantic hurricane in living memory destroyed New York City in its entirety and ushered in a new wave of ecological and environmental disasters that pillaged the land and murdered millions.  It had been seventy-five years since the behemoth *Lazarus* Space Station had been constructed and inhabited for the sole focus of the Earthen Space Force\u2019s colonial program. It had been sixty years since Lian Shu Bei had perfected a faster than light warp drive to allow exploration and colonisation beyond the meagre boarders of the solar system. Humanity, during this period, began to flock to the common goal of seeing that Earth would not become just another graveyard in a vast, empty galactic void. Conversely those who though that humanity had blown it\u2019s chance, religious and environmental zealots especially, began to protest the ESF and it\u2019s \u2018grand\u2019 mission stating that humanity cannot be allowed to spread its failure across worlds not destined for humanity.  \n\nIt has been thirty years since the three sister colony ships had been laid down, culminating in the largest engineering project ever endeavoured upon by humanity. ESF *Conatus* \u2018Endeavour\u2019, ESF *Spera* \u2018Hope\u2019 and ESF Prosperitas \u2018Prosperity\u2019 were to be three, concurrent, missions to nearest habitable stars by a renown collective of scientific minds. It had been twenty years since the last major war between the factions of Earth as the United Americas, and their allies the Eurasian Federation and African Incorporation battled with the Pan-Asian Collective and Oceanic Conclave for control of dwindling resources and deep reservations about the funding and mission of the Earthen Space Force. The war lasted five years, killed millions and changed virtually nothing about the Earthen Space Force or its mission merely adding fuel to the fire of distrust around the ESF and humanities right to the galaxy.\n\nIt has been ten years since the *Hygleon Pandemic* of 2173 that nearly killed two billion of Earth\u2019s dwindling population. A fast-acting, particularly virulent strain of tuberculosis that could not be treated with traditional methods that threatened to end life on Earth before the intervention of ESF researchers with an emergency vaccine. Some accused the ESF of creating the Pandemic to fuel panic and investment in the colonisation program but it was never proved. It is now one week before departure aboard the ESF *Conatus* and some of the best and brightest, Commanders, Scientists, Doctors, Engineers, Media Experts and Security Specialists have been allocated to the first ship to leave Sol Space. The air is thick with tension as many threats from the Oceanic Conclave that an attack is imminent on the *Conatus* have the colonists and ESF spooked. Will the *Conatus* make its way into the unknown only those aboard will be able to tell\u2026\n",

Send assistance as we don.... **breakes down**\n\n    Starbase 4012-B    \n\nThe last communication from Starbase 4012-B, on the furthest reaches of humanities influences into the void, made for grim reading at the Gaia Prime Communications Centre.   Humanity had come vast distances in the past century. From the birth of commercial space-flight to the construction of vast star bases to survey and harvest rare materials, humanity had achieved it all \u2013 or so everyone thought. Humanity now reached across three separate solar systems, the fledgling steps towards a space empire, with several colonies including Mars, Gaia, Harkonen and Killandur flourishing from the fresh waves of colonists eager to explore life outside of humanities cradle \u2013 Earth. \n\nStarbase 4012-B was the latest star base to join the Sol Federation\u2019s arsenal of advanced mining and survey stations dotted throughout the vast galactic unknown to study and collect new materials for humanity. Starbase 4012-B was entirely self-sufficient, requiring only a minimal crew to assist with the utility cyborgs that maintained the base, and was meant to begin a new wave of expansion into further reaches of space previously inaccessible due to supply. One year since the coronation of 4012-B as the pinnacle of humanities technological advance, however, Gaia received a garbled message amongst the usual correspondence received from around the Sol Federation. 4012-B was in trouble. Immediately after, 4012-B went radio-silent for the first time since completion.\n\nThe Sol Federation\u2019s response was immediate, if there was an unknown fault with 4012-B it needed to be highlighted to command quickly before the expansion rolled out across new frontiers. A formidable crew was recruited from across the Federation to investigate the cause of any interference or repair issues with Starbase 4012-B as well as report back to the Federation if any militaristic contact had been established. The Sol Federation still lived in fear of contact with a vastly superior and dominant race whilst humanity was still in its infancy.\n\nThe crew was placed aboard *SF Spectrum*, a *Miami* class research vessel, and entombed in cyro-chambers for the long hyperdrive to 4012-B. It has been three months since the Sol Federation sent the crew out into the unknown \u2013 with a satisfying hiss the AI onboard began to warm the cyro-chambers back to life...\n\n***\n\nWelcome to Starbase 4012-B a space-horror in the vein of Alien or Dead Space. I am looking for a 5 or 6 man crew consisting of an Engineer, Scientist, Medic, 2 Soldiers and a Operations Command *(Taken by Flax)*. Any questions please message me!\n\n",
