        "writing_prompt": "After a shipwreck leaves you and a group of survivors stranded on a seemingly idyllic tropical island, you begin to notice strange structures, eerie watchers, and the unsettling feeling that your arrival was no accident.",
        "story": "There is an island. Around it, warm water gently erodes the centuries-old stone into sand. A small building is on the island. It is night. The sky is clear, the moon waxing, the stars twinkling in quiet assent to its passage. A small building is on the island. Concrete walls and the silhouette of a radar dish on the top. Inside the building sits a figure. Impossible to make out features in the dim light of the barely- half moon, but medium height, medium build. Unremarkable. Before him- perhaps 'him', anyway- sits a small terminal, the kind of chunky, monochrome display that was common in the late 1980s. Data scrolls across it, not too fast to read, but fast enough that he needs to focus. Finally, there is a sharp intake of breath, followed by a resigned sigh. He reaches into a black leather briefcase at his feet and retrieves a phone, then pulls a slender metal antennae from the top. He doesn't dial a number, just lifts the phone to his ear. \"Seventeen over six. Yes, the usual restrictions.\" No further conversation, no pleasantries, he just hangs up. And then there is a quiet shudder across the island... AUGUST 17 (Now, or near enough) Sand, thought Arlo Mason, had never tasted so good. You'd think that after three weeks of fresh tropical fruit, rare steaks, and enough fruity tropical cocktails to sink the navy, that sand would be an unwelcome surprise, but then again, swimming 50 meters across murky tropical waters changes one's standards. All told, Arlo figured he could have had it worse. He'd at least made it out with his favourite Acapulco shirt. He was soaked through, but the sun was drying everything fast. In fact, Arlo was half-considering lying down and working on his tan. The beach was beautiful- one of those little white sand, rock wall grotto places that seem to only exist in travel brochures and... well, in his screenplays. This would be great reference material for his next movie. But, his better nature kicked in, and no sooner had he dragged himself ashore than he was charging back into the surf to haul in the rest of the survivors. He recognized some faces- Miranda Weeks, the captain of the Xerxes, the towering cruise liner that would never sail again; Nils Klytor, the weird old German who never came out of his cabin; Bria Giles, the head of security- and a few other faces as well. But the familiar faces were few and far between as a sea of people poured out of the cracks in the Xerxes' hull and made their way towards the island. As surf splashed around Arlo's feet and the shouts of the survivors rang in his ears, the cool head and quick wit that made him famous faltered for just a moment, and Arlo realized that he was, in fact, in a great deal of trouble. And as more and more bodies dragged themselves, gasping onto the shore, others watched from not so far away- and could not help but agree with Arlo's assessment."

        "writing_prompt": "In the quiet, peculiar town of Candlecourt, five strangers are drawn to the same inn by cryptic messages and impossible coincidences, only to find themselves caught in a strange game between two enigmatic men who seem to exist everywhere and nowhere at once. What are the rules, and what\u2019s at stake?",
        "story": "Candlecourt, United Kingdom. It's a quiet day- a Sunday. There aren't many people out, the streets are mostly empty. Mostly empty, save for one man standing on a street corner. He's wearing a business suit- impeccably tailored- with a bright purple shirt beneath it, the top few buttons undone to show that he's a professional who knows how to party. He's tapping his foot in time to the beat of music that's pumping in through his earphones. He's wearing a Walkman. One of the old ones. For cassettes. He's really getting into the beat of the music when someone else approaches. They could be brothers, they look so alike- they're even dressed the same. Only the shirt is different- the newcomer's is a deep red, almost burgundy. \"Dima,\" the red-shirted man says. \"Arkady\", Dima replies. \"Have you heard this tape? It's really good.\" \"I guarantee I've heard it already.\" \"You will at some point, I suppose.\" \"That's what I said.\" Their voices are completely neutral- almost interchangeable. They could be from anywhere in North America- but there's a vague accent that could be Eastern European, if you listened very hard. \"You've been busy, Dima.\" \"I'm always busy, Arkady.\" \"Of course. You do understand this won't work, though?\" \"On the contrary, Arkady, not only will it work, it will prove what I've been saying for years.\" \"Dima, Dima. Would you wager your reputation on that?\" \"I already have, but if you're asking for a wager-\" \"I am.\" \"Then I accept. Nineteen over eight, the usual restrictions.\" \"Please. Make it worth my while, I did not come here for my health. Sixteen over six, Valentich restrictions.\" \"Eighteen over five, Isdal restrictions, and I'll even waive the optionals.\" \"Then I accept. Eighteen over five, Isdal restrictions, optionals waived. When shall we begin?\" \"But we already have.\" \"Or will soon, in any case.\" --- The five of them entered the hotel at around the same time. They didn't plan it that way, it just happened. Three of them were here because they needed a place to stay. They'd been seeing the messages for years now- in billboards, in movies, in books and in internet chatrooms. Each of them, in their own way, had reached the breaking point. For Luna, it had come when she'd opened a book to find a short haiku scrawled inside in an unfamiliar hand: \"Arkady, my friend, Come to Candlecourt post haste, And please bring some snacks\" For Alayne, it had come after years of hearing those two- Arkady and Dima- appear on her damn tapes. It didn't matter what she was doing, or whose audio she had in the booth that day, Arkady and Dima always seemed to make an appearance. Finally they mentioned Candlecourt, and she figured this was her chance to figure out why they kept screwing up her work. And for Tague, it had come when he'd gone to pay his tab and had seen a message from Arkady printed on the receipt. As for Ben and Eddie, well. They'd been living in Candlecourt for some time, where bizarre occurrences were paradoxically routine. Candlecourt had always been a hotspot for paranormal activity. UFO sightings, ghost stories, and legends of monsters in the woods had all abounded for the last few decades, and rare was the summer where they didn't get a slew of tourists eager for some legend tripping. So, when Eddie had opened a library book to find a message from Arkady asking Dima to meet him at the Lion's Mane at 3:00, and Ben had likewise found a message from Dima saying that he wouldn't be able to do it until 4:00 since his stomach was acting up, they saw this for what it was- an opportunity. They all entered the inn to find a man with wild hair and wilder eyes leaning over the counter at the proprietor. \"You don't *get* it, Lucas! They said they'd be here, today, at four o'clock!\" The man swings his arms around with blatant disregard for the antiquities on display in the Lion's Mane Inn's foyer. \"Calm down, Alec, please. Really. Did they say they'd bring the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny with them?\" \"This isn't a game, Lucas! Haven't you been following the messages?! The numbers are changing!\" \"Mm-hm. Are they getting bigger, or smaller this time?\" Alec nods, seeming to have found his opening. \"I thought there was a downward trend, but it looks like they're ticking up again. Look-\" He reaches into his pocket and spreads a slew of newspaper clippings onto the table. \"Last week, it was twenty three over nine, then sixteen over nine. Then it drops way down to five over three, but just today, look-\" He thumps a finger on the table. \"Twenty *six* over nine.\" He folds his arms and smiles. \"Twenty six.\" Lucas whistles, long and low. \"Well, it sounds like things are well in hand, then.\" \"What? No!\" He waves his hands over the paper. \"It's-\" \"Alex, please-\" Lucas gestures past him, towards the five who just entered. \"I have guests. Can we do this later?\""

The seminar hasn\u2019t started yet, the doors are locked, and none of them know each other\u2014but something about the message feels impossible to ignore.",
        "story": "Thomas Garland is alone in a room. The lights are off. Yet there is just barely enough light by which he can see, a faint blue glow. He's sitting on a couch, the upholstery frayed, colour faded from black to gray. In front of him is an Ottoman, faux-leather with scratches and tears from years of hard use. On the Ottoman is a small box, dark wood, lacquered with something exquisitely slick. Plain, little more than a cube with a few small spheres for feet. The blue glow comes from a barely visible crack around the top of the box. Thomas Garland is looking at the box, eyes never moving from it. The only other object on the Ottoman is an old cellular phone, the kind that flips. This is Thomas Garland's house, and it is not Thomas Garland's house. This is Thomas Garland. And he is not Thomas Garland. Thomas Garland knows what will be inside the box when he opens it. And he knows what will happen when he opens the box. Worse, he thinks to himself, is that he knows what will happen if he doesn't. For a heartbeat's length there is a figure standing before him, all pale skin and dead, rolling eyes. Thomas Garland blinks, and it is gone. This is Thomas Garland. And Thomas Garland opens the box. --- DeWitt, Midwest United States. DeWitt is an oddity of a town. Small enough that most of the locals know each other, big enough that someone who knows what they're doing can hide. Modern conveniences but a kind of late 70s aesthetic. Just off a few major highways but still not really on the way to anywhere. Nice place. Nice people. It's the kind of place Enzo Ciaretti hates. Enzo Ciaretti is from New York, and frankly, any place with a population density lower than Times Square wigs him out. A childhood among the skyscrapers and smokestacks of midtown New York have given him a touch of agoraphobia, and he can feel the sweat beading on his forehead as he looks out at the unoccupied street ahead of him. It doesn't help that today hasn't been off to a great start. Garland isn't answering his phone, and the seminar is due to begin in less than three hours. Greg went to fish Tom out of his place and drag him over, only Greg hasn't come back yet. And Greg isn't picking up his phone either. To be blunt, Enzo is starting to get nervous. He does his best to swallow it- Greg has handled this sort of situation before, he knows what he's doing. All Enzo has to do is keep people out of the auditorium until an hour before the performance, and check tickets as they come in. He nods, folds his hands behind his back, and takes a long, deep breath. --- This brings us to the five travellers, just checking into their rooms at the Cygnus Hotel in DeWitt. Bags are left on the coarse carpet, beds are tested in the customary ways following a long day of travel. Plastic is removed from bars of hotel soap, complimentary mints are eaten. Each realizes that from their hotel room, they can see the auditorium where Garland's seminar is to take place in a little less than three hours. Then, the phone rings. Each of the five responds in their own way, but each realizes that the headaches, the nosebleeds, the inexplicable pain that accompanies **those** calls is absent, so, slowly, each picks up the phone. Static fuzzes the line, but the words are clear enough. \"This is a wake-up call, Patient Dawn. It's a sharp-edged universe and you've caught your sleeve on it. I won't pretend I can help you, but help can't be found by looking. Head to the auditorium, find Del Salazar. He's inside.\" The line clicks dead. Each of the five looks out their window at the auditorium- it's still early, so there's no line, but they probably aren't letting people in this early. But if this 'Del Salazar' can help, it just might be worth it to find a way in..."
