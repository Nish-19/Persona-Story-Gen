Turns out, there's a Tom Garland out in the midwest, used to be a reporter, now he writes books. You'd never heard of him. Moderately famous. \n\nYou chalk it up to a crossed wire. A late-night mistake. Drunk dialing. \n\nLast night, another call. \n\nTom Garland's voice again. \"Denver, nine. Milwaukee, seven. Regina, two.\" Just that, until you finally hung up. And in the background of Tom Garland's voice, a low drone, a quiet static hum. \n\nAll the next day, you had headaches, nosebleeds. Doctors said you checked out. Nothing awry, except that you looked in the mirror that morning and saw something that wasn't your face looking back. \n\nTom Garland is doing a book signing not far from where you live, in a little town called DeWitt. It's a short drive, a quick flight, a bus or a train ride, maybe. \n\nWhat have you got to lose by tracking him down?",
