            "story_name": "For 70 years, a war has been waged within the city of Aquarius. The Houses, created as strongholds for the fallen Angellum after the Aura Wars, are constantly vying for dominance. Now only four of the oldest and most powerful Houses remain: Irydthion, Ya Mord\u00fcl, Kyle, and Halcyon Kept.\n\nThe war between Houses has taken a sudden, unexpected turn. Creatures unlike anything ever seen before have appeared, attacking all Houses without discretion, wielding technology equally as alien. Time is short on all sides. Each House begins to strenghten its military force in response to these new enemies. The race is on to discover the origins of these creatures, and all the while the tensions between Houses continue to mount until the breaking point becomes inevitable.\n\nNavigating through politcal struggles and internal deception, agents from each House discover that the strange creatures are only the newest development in a war so ancient and vast that it dwarfs their comprehension of time. Defeat of this new and deadly enemy is more than any House can handle on its own, and an alliance with the other Houses could be the deciding factor. But can an alliance between four powers with intermingled histories of prejudice and violence even be possible?",

It's the ship that everyone who's anyone wants to be on. \n\nThe *Magellanic Queen* is also unique in one very special way. The upper hold is meant for the travelers: the rich elite, the middle class who couldn't *really* afford this trip, and the poor average Joes who won their tickets through one of the many intergalactic contests.\n\nThe lower hold, however ... that's the part that's interesting. \n\nIt's meant to store cargo. Any kind of cargo. For the *Magellanic Queen's* maiden voyage, that cargo is livestock. Not just any livestock, though. These creatures are owned by the interstellar corporate giant, Weyland-Yutani.\n\nThe upper and lower holds aren't meant to mix. The passengers of this marvelous cruise ship don't know that beneath them are large, noisy, lumbering herbivores. They aren't meant to know. As far as they're concerned, the *Magellanic Queen* is an instrument of their leisure. As far as Weyland-Yutani is concerned, the *Magellanic Queen* is a cheap and convenient way to get the livestock to one of its fledgling colonies. \n\nWhat nobody knows is that the livestock is infected.\n\nWhat nobody knows is that in a matter of a few short hours, something very bad is going to happen in the lower hold. \n\nWhat nobody can even possibly imagine is that when the Big Bad happens and the captain finally puts out a distress call, it's going to catch the attention of something even worse.\n\nWelcome aboard the *Magellanic Queen*. We hope you enjoy your flight.\n\n***\n**NOTE:** This is based off the Aliens Vs. Predator shared universe. Familiarity with the universe isn\u2019t necessary. I\u2019d like this to be a fairly fast-paced game and aside from a regular cast, I\u2019d love to have a few characters appear for a scene or two before meeting a gory end at either the hands of a xenomorph or a Predator.",

            "story_name": "47 years ago, a wormhole connecting the Milky Way with the Sunflower Galaxy (also known as M63) appeared. Mankind launched a swift and succesful colonization effort, aided in large part by the discovery of two garden planets (Baressia and Arta) within M63.\n\n10 years ago, the wormhole mysteriously disappeared. The hundreds of millions of people residing in colonized M63 were left with no way to contact those in the Milky Way. Though FTL technology had been making steady advancements, it would still take centuries to traverse the distance between the two galaxies.\n\nThe loss of the wormhole, while damaging, was not debilitating to the humans of M63. They\u2019d had ample time to colonize and establish themselves. While some effort was put forth to reestablish communications with the Milky Way, something of greater importance dictated that attention be focused elsewhere.\n\nFour years after the wormhole vanished, humans in M63 made first contact with another sentient species. Contact was made in the form of an attack. The enemy, possessing ships faster and stronger than anything humanity had at its disposal, assaulted a mining platform and several ships nearby. When those dispatched in response to the initial distress call arrived, there was no sign of a battle, no sign of the human vessels *or* the enemy. There was no sign of *anything*.\n\nThis enemy, named the Conflux, began to attack with increasing frequency and alarming efficiency. More ships were lost. More lives were lost, too, all of them without a trace. It was impossible to trace the Conflux back to their point of origin\u2014they were simply too fast. They also had an ability to manipulate temporary wormholes which allowed them to \"jump\" swiftly away if the battle turned against them. As the months passed, it became increasingly apparent that humanity's future in M63 was being severely threatened. For reasons unknown the Conflux had started this war, and it appeared they were going to win it.\n\nThe joint military-security firm known as Sisyphus Armed Forces (SAF) began construction on prototype warships in direct response to the Conflux threat. These prototypes were the Aegis class (named for the ancient Greek word that can mean \"shield\") and the Kopis class (for the ancient Greek term that means \"to cut\" or \"to strike\"). The two were designed to work together in combat. The Aegis, heavily armored, was meant to act as a distraction and was capable of soaking massive amounts of enemy firepower, which allowed the heavily armed Kopis an opportunity to fly directly into enemy ranks and launch an assault. In their first battle against the Conflux, the prototype Aegis and Kopis performed well. So very well, in fact, that SAF began scheduled them for mass production.\n\nA fleet of Aegis-Kopis teams was gradually assembled and sent throughout M63. The tide of the war slowly turned in humanity's favor, but it was clear a complete victory would be impossible until it could be discovered where exactly the Conflux were coming from. Even with the efficient tactics of the Aegis-Kopis warships, there was no current way to track the Conflux to their point of origin. \n\nAnd so it has become a stalemate, with both sides winning some and losing some. No matter how well the new warships have handled the Conflux threat, the enemy is still as unpredictable and deadly as they ever were.\n\nWhich is something you're about to learn for yourself. \n\n",

They'd had ample time to colonize and establish themselves. While some effort was put forth to reestablish communications with the Milky Way, something of greater importance dictated that attention be focused elsewhere. \n\nSix years ago, the Conflux appeared. It was mankind's first encounter with an alien race. It was also nearly their last. The Conflux posessed technology that was a complete enigma to even the brightest of human minds. When they attacked, they devastated and they left nothing behind once they left. Thousands of humans vanished in the aftermath of Conflux raids.\n\nThe threat was dire. A joint security-military firm known as Sisyphus Armed Forces (SAF) began production on two prototype warships. These ships, known as Aegis and Kopis class, suceeded where no other military vessel could succeed. Their creation turned the tide of the war. Fleets of them were deployed throughout colonized M63 and the instances of humans vanishing dropped significantly. \n\nCurrently, most of the galaxy is still centered on the war with the Conflux. However, for those dwelling on the Iobates spaceport, other problems have arisen. Located in the Proetus system on the very fringes of colonized M63, the port is a hub of activity due mainly to its proximity to several large mining operations. For the same reasons, it's also where many black market transactions take place. Iobates has some security in the form of stationed SAF soldiers and a local authority force, but the port is so vast that even their vigilant patrols can't possibly put an end to all things illegitimate that occur there. \n\nLife on the outskirts of colonized space is risky for a number of reasons. The Conflux are known to strike in systems that are isolated from others, such as Proetus. Encounters with raiders--looking to forcibly take precious resource cargo from mining ships and SAF carries both--is common. Living on Iobates is not for the faint of heart or those that lack a sense of adventure. \n\nAnd now things are about to take a different turn. The Conflux is not the only hostile species out there, as those on Iobates are about to discover. And given how great an enemy the Conflux are, can M63's human population survive another threat of that magnitude?\n\n--\n\n**Narrator\u2019s Notes:** Your character will be stationed on the Iobates spaceport. I\u2019m looking for 5-7 players. I\u2019ve created my own cards, but feel free to create your own as long as they\u2019re relevant to the story\u2019s universe. Only one of each nature is needed, so please look at what\u2019s already been submitted when applying.\n\nThis game shares a universe with another game I'm narrating (link: https://storium.com/game/crux). That game focuses on the war with the Conflux while this one will focus on not only first contact made with another species, but the issues of inhabiting a space port in a solar system rife with raiders. If you\u2019d like a better idea of the history of the universe these games are based on, you can find a reference guide here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KJWV8AfC8EWxPtu1P3toEc7dms4fJruVkQySxVWYQ5c/pub\n\nThis game won\u2019t necessarily be moving fast, but it will be steady. If you can\u2019t commit to posting **AT LEAST 1-2 times a week**, this may not be the game for you. Additionally, this game will probably contain strong language, violence, and disturbing imagery, so consider yourselves warned.\n\nCharacter selection and gameplay probably won\u2019t start until next week sometime as I\u2019ll be away most of the weekend. **If you submit a character and don\u2019t hear from me immediately, please be patient. :)** \n\n**NOTE: Some natures have already been filled. Natures NOT filled are: Port Medic, Ex-Raider, Merchant and Former Aegis Crewman. I'd REALLY like to have a medic.**\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this story, please feel free to email me at solrhyo@gmail.com.",
