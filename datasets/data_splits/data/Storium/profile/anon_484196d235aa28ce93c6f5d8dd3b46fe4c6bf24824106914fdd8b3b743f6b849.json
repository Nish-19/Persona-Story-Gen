        "writing_prompt": "As chaos erupts at the heavily fortified north gate, a towering war machine bearing the emblem of the House of Kyle begins its deadly trial run. Trapped in the crossfire, you must decide: fight, flee, or uncover the truth behind this devastating attack.",
        "story": "The Boundary is not an aesthetic structure. It's ugly, made of dull concrete that rises forty feet. It is topped with rolls of razor wire. It wasn't made to be an elegant piece of architecture. It was made to keep the House Wars within House territory, and for that purpose it suffices. The north gate is the most popular transit route between the city and House territory. Despite this fact, it's still heavily fortified. It's manned at all hours by security teams of tenfive men on the House side, five men on the other. Travel through this gate is heartily discouraged by city officials, particularly where civilians are concerned. However, it is still permitted; it is not the duty of the guards to protect individuals from their own stupidity. Supplies are routinely trucked through the north gate. People who dwell in House territorymainly members of the Houses themselvesoften conduct business in the city. There are no real services in House territory save that of the makeshift medical and cybernetics clinics that are strewn throughout. For every other service, the Houses must venture beyond the Boundary. People often gather at the north gate. Tourists flock to it, hoping to catch a glimpse of House activity. Aquarius' news channels station reporters are there often when they catch wind of a skirmish brewing. And then there are the travellers, those willing to pass through the gate into streets left damaged and abandoned by the intensity of the House Wars. These travellers are sometimes just thrill seekers. Some are members of the city's military. Some have legitimate business with the Houses. Some are attending to business that is not in any way legitimate. It is a busy evening now at the north gate. There is a steady stream of vehicles and pedestrians passing through. Sergeant Marek How, officer in charge of the current guard team, is busy checking the papers of a moving van driven by woman whose facial implants give her a decidedly villainous feel. He is used to the sounds of a transient population, motors and horns and the vocal complaints of drivers. What he hears now is different from all of those. It is the high pitched whine of moving machinery, and it is approaching the gate from the House side. Sergeant How instantly has a bad feeling. He turns to stare through the gate, at the line of traffic hoping to exit into the city. The sound is louder now. He ducks his head to speak into the radio attached to his collar, \"Narris, what the hell is that noi\" The last part of his question is drowned out by the sound of gun fire. There is a simultaneous explosion on the other side of the gate. Immediately the sounds of chaos ensue. Drivers on the city side struggle to get out of the gridlock they're encased in. Drivers on the House side are trying to surge forward, through the barricade. And beyond them Sergeant How sees fire and smoke. *What the fuck?* He thinks, backing away, waving to the other guards on his side of the gate. There is no hope of controlling traffic now; all they can do is get themselves out of the way until law enforcement arrives. He steps off the road, narrowly avoiding being struck by a speeding van that has broken through the barricade. He yells a question into his radio and his met by static. The sounds of destruction are much closer now. And then he sees it, the cause of all this. He watches wide-eyed as it wheels into view, crushing vehicles in its path. It is larger than most any other vehicle he has seen. It rolls on three huge wheels with monstrous treads. Through the haze of smoke and fire, Sergeant How sees that it is oddly shaped, sleekly curved and made of pale grey metal. As it passes him he hears the smooth whisper of the wheels, accompanied by the mechanic whine he heard earlier. He also sees something that worries him. He sees the emblem of the House of Kyle painted on its side. He knows instantly what it is. It halts on the city side of the gate. It begins to change shape. The axles are shifting, the wheels rising into the air, and it steadies itself on a tripod of metal appendages. Its round shape splits apart with the sound of hydraulics and the same high whine. It begins to look vaguely man shaped. The small, round nob that has appeared like a head has one glowing blue band across its surfacea sensor strip. More metal appendages are unfolding from within it with an odd grace, and Sergeant How sees that they are not arms. They are massive cannons. Over the radio, the men under his control are screaming questions at him. He fumbles for his radio and gives his answer. \"It's a war machine.\" Everyone has heard about UA's newest military prototype. Nobody to date has seen one, not even the most persistent outlets of the city's media. But the prototype is what is before him now, swivelling on its stand, locating targets and preparing to fire. Sergeant How is no longer thinking about damage control. He is thinking, as the prototype begins to fire weapons that are clearly energy based, that he is not paid nearly enough to deal with shit like this. He is thinking that when all this is over and the dead are being tallied, that UA will deny having sold the prototype to the House of Kyleno, instead, UA will claim it was stolen. The House of Kyle will deny ownership, even though it bears the Kyle emblem. There will be no way for authorities to prove that this attack was intentional, no paper trail, no money to follow. And worst of all, Sergeant How is thinking that the slaughter that is commencing is no accident. It is a trial. The prototype is test firing. The sergeant is now thinking that he needs to get his ass across the street, to the armored barracks where he and his men are stationed when not on duty at the gate. He is thinking that if they were smart, everyone else out in the open would be headed there too. That is the last thought he has. Seconds later he is dead, caught in one of the first shots fired by the UA prototype war machine. It's up to everyone else here to survive."

        "writing_prompt": "Aboard the luxurious *Monolith*, passengers and crew gather on the grand observation deck to witness the rare beauty of a centuries-old comet\u2014but amidst the awe and revelry, a quiet tension begins to ripple through the crowd. What secrets or dangers might this celestial event bring?",
        "story": "The *Monolith*'s observation deck is just as grandiose as the rest of the ship. It's a massive room paneled in fabricated mahogany. The tiled floors are a glossy, reflective black. At the back of the room is a long bar, its polished surface the same color mahogany as the walls. The observation windows themselves rise floor to ceiling, the tops majestically arched. Along the sides are booth tables where those who don't wish to stand can instead sit to enjoy the view. The *Monolith* is currently positioned right alongside the trajectory of a comet known as Olijan 32y7. In anticipation of seeing the comet up close the observation deck is currently crowded and is on the verge of becoming even more so. Olijan 32Y7 is a long period comet, which means it has an orbital period that can range from 200 to one thousand years. The comet has not made an appearance in this part of space in nearly 700 years. This is the reason why so many have come to watch it pass by. The viewers here in the observation deck come from all walks of life. Not all of them are passengers, though a majority are. Many of them are employed on the ship--engineers, casino workers, cooks, and housemaids. For this event, some of them have been granted special permission to attend the viewing. Those that haven't gotten permission have found a way to be here nonetheless. Synthetic waiters, garbed impeccably in black evening tailcoats and trousers, are wandering throughout the room, smiling at people and offering flutes of expensive (and for this occasion, complimentary) flutes of champagne from the trays they carry. The three bartenders at the bar are busy, as well--there's a demand for the harder kind of booze as well, though those that want it have to pay for it. Minutes pass. The dull roar of many conversations fill the room. Those that are sociable are mingling with those they find interesting, attractive, or are unable to avoid. Those who prefer solitude and quiet have taken up positions that keep them well out of the crowd. When those nearest the observation windows begin to raise their voices in awed appreciation, the crowd surges forward. There is Olijan 32Y7. The nucleus of the comet, with its low albedo, is overlooked in favor of what follows immediately after it. The coma of Olijan 32y7 is a magnificent sight to behold, a massive stream of dust and H20 illuminated by this system's sun. It shines several different shades of blue and violet, the colors scintillating as the comet tumbles into better view of all those standing in the observation deck. After the coma are the tails, one each for dust and gas, both long and glowing white. Olijan 32Y7 is massive. The *Monolith* is situated at a distance far enough away to allow for viewing optimization. Such is the size of the comet, however, that even after several minutes the coma and the tail are still filling the observation windows. Some people are losing interest as time passes; such is the nature of most humans that appreciation in general tends to be short and fleeting. Conversations starts back up. Alcohol begins to flow a little more freely. What better setting for a pleasurable evening than with the backdrop of the beautiful, ethereal tail of the comet as it wheels through space? This is the perfect time for everyone present to mingle, cut loose, and generally revel in being alive."

        "writing_prompt": "In the eerie silence of space combat, the crew of the *SAF Balmung* prepares to strike a decisive blow against the alien Conflux, but as their stealth approach begins, Commander Nickelsen can't shake the feeling that something about this mission is about to go terribly wrong.",
        "story": "It's a popular misconception that battles conducted in space are noisy. They're not. Proof of this is evident when observing the crew of the *SAF Balmung*. The assault they're mounting takes place in relative silence. The soft roar of the plasma cannons and the muted staccato of the rail guns are of course audible. So too is the faint hiss of the point defense lasers that activate should an enemy fighter get too close. To the crew, these sounds are just background noise. The combat deck of the *Balmung* is quiet to the point of eeriness during battle, with only the crew speaking (if necessary) or the sounding of the ship's warning claxons (should things take an unfortunate turn). *\"Balmung, this is the* Svalinn. *We're in position. Initiate attack when ready.\"* The announcement comes over the secured comm channel shared by the *Balmung* and the *Svalinn*. The *Svalinn*, an Aegis class warship, is named for the legendary shield in Norse mythology which stood before the sun. The ship is about to live up to its namesake by diverting the attention of the Conflux fighters and becoming the sole focus of their weapon's fire. \"Acknowledged, *Svalinn*.\" The voice of the *Balmung*'s commander, Maeve Nickelsen, blares over the comm. The commander is currently stationed in the flight deck, beside Chief Helmsman Molly Li. \"Paris, Helmsman Litake us in.\" Nickelsen, a tall, sturdily built woman, speaks with the easy authority of someone who's held a command position for a long time. The truth of the matter is that this is only the *Balmung*'s third skirmish and that her crew members are still relative strangers to each other. Still, when their commander speaks they listen. The *Balmung*'s stealth system is engaged and it begins to move away from the *Svalinn*. There is a taut silence on the combat deck as the small warship cuts around its Aegis class counterpart and heads directly for the enemy fighters. The fingers on Nickelsen's right hand start drumming rapidly against her thigh. It's the only outward sign of her nervousness. She glances to her right where a man stands silently, dressed in combat fatigues and carrying a military issue pulse rifle. This is Master Sergeant Simon Kennex, a SAF marine and the newest addition to the crew. In Nickelsen's opinion, he's also an entirely unnecessary addition. SAF felt it best to provide some protection for its Aegis and Kopis crews should the worst happen and they are boarded by the enemy. In Nickelsen's opinion, if the *Balmung* is ever boarded by the Conflux there won't be a goddamn thing Kennex can do to prevent the worst from happening. SAF has also begun encouraging its warships to disable and board enemy vessels for the purpose of taking some of the Conflux alive. Nickelsen, having had the great misfortune of personally seeing a Conflux up close, has inwardly decided that she will never subject her crew to that most horrific of experiences. \"Two Conflux Leaners on sensors,\" says Crewman Kennedy from where she's standing at one of the consoles lining the walls of the combat deck. Everyone relaxes a little. \"Leaners\", so named because of their bizarre appearance that makes it seem as though they are always leaning to one side, are the smallest of the enemy's fighting vessels and are relatively easy to dispatch. \"This is it,\" Commander Nickelsen says to her crew. \"I want them both destroyed. Engage.\""

        "writing_prompt": "A luxury space cruiser docks at a seedy spaceport on the edge of the galaxy, drawing curious onlookers and eager merchants\u2014until the passengers disembark armed to the teeth, revealing themselves as raiders. What happens next?",
        "story": "4 Bay has the questionable distinction of being one of the most popular places on Iobates. The main reason for this is not that it's aesthetically appealing (it's not), but that it's the main entrance and departure point for anyone visiting the base. So, if you're someone who's been stationed on this floating shithole for any extended period of time and you've exhausted every other line of entertainment available (and there's not many), you may find yourself drawn to the trusted, age old hobby of people watching. And there's no better place on Iobates for this than 4 Bay. 4 Bay is unique from the other hangar bays in a couple of other ways as well, which might be what makes it such a popular place. Because it's where all visitors to the spaceport gain entry, many of the resident merchants have seen fit to set up shop here. Subsequently there's a line of shops and stalls just outside the security checkpoint where newcomers can feel free to waste their money on a wide variety of useless crap. There are food vendors as well, because after spending any amount of time on transport vessel the first thing passengers are going to want is real food (although, calling the meals sold at these stalls \"real food\" is stretching the truth by a mile). Once the passengers make it past the stalls and shops, they can do one of three things. They can head directly into the spaceport proper. They can also choose to wet their whistle by stepping into the Eight-Ball, one of the largest and most popular cantinas on Iobates. Lastly, they can opt to take a stroll down what's commonly referred to as the \"observation deck\". The observation deck is actually a narrow catwalk that connects 4 Bay to 5 Bay. It's also where the locals gather to people watch. On any given day you'll find 10-20 Iobates dwellers on the catwalk, watching passengers disembark from their vessels and while wondering why the fuck anyone would want to come here. 4 Bay is currently very busy. There's something novel happening today--a transport cruiser has arrived. Cruisers differ from vessels in that they're the space adaptation of an Old Earth luxury passenger liner. A *cruise ship*, and it's docking here on a spaceport on the very fringes of colonized M63--a spaceport that, everyone knows, is home to many who are attempting to run or hide from the law, people who have no place better to go, and people who are pretty much the scum of the universe. The hilarity of anyone paying good money to tour Iobates has been the treasured topic of gossip among Iobate's citizens since word of the transport cruiser's arrival came. And so it is that both the vendor strip and the catwalk are crowded with people hoping to catch a glimpse of the idiots who thought that Iobates, out of all the many other marvels of M63, would be a nice place to visit. The transport cruiser has already docked, having cleared the external security scans. The docking clamps have been set in place and now the boarding ramps are rolling out. The cruiser's name is laid out on her sides in grandoise, sweeping letters: *Magellanic Queen*. There's an audible *boom* that echoes throughout 4 Bay as the boarding ramps lock into place against the hull of the cruiser. The catwalk and the vendor strip are abuzz with conversation. The observers on the former are wondering just what kind of travelers will be disembarking. Seniors? Honeymooners? People who could only afford the very cheapest of vacations? At the vendor strip, the store owners are all mentally rubbing their hands together with avaricious glee. A *cruise ship* means business! The three hatches of the *Magellanic Queen* slide open. Passengers begin to spill down the ramps. People on the catwalk lean over to get a closer look at the newcomers. The merchants ensure that their \"Open!\" signs are switched on and are easily viewable. \"Where's the luggage?\" This from someone on the catwalk, attracting some attention to what he's referring to. Although the conveyer has been extended below the cargo hold of the cruiser, the cargo hatch hasn't opened. \"Malfunction, maybe,\" someone else says. There's an explosive sound that jerks everyone's attention back around to the boarding ramps. What the hell was that? And then it sounds again, and again, and again in short order. And that's when people begin to realize that it's gunfire, and that the people disembarking from the *Magellanic Cruiser* have *weapons*, and that they're swarming the security checkpoint-- Claxons begin to sound in 4 Bay. All points of exit automatically seal as a result. The emergency lights high on the walls are flashing yellow, which indicates to everyone familiar with the alert levels of Iobates as to what's just happened-- Raiders."
