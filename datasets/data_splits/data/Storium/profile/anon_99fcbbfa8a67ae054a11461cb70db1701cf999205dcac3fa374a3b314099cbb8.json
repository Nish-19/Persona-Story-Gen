        "writing_prompt": "A wealthy steel magnate\u2019s will demands his closest companions and most unlikely acquaintances gather at his sprawling mansion for a final stay, but as the days unfold, strange presences and unspoken fears begin to stir among the guests. What secrets lie hidden within the walls, and what forces have been waiting for this moment?",
        "story": "chapter 1: near arrival. John Harmen, a magnate in the steel industry, was dead at the old age of 72. He had made a great deal of money over his life from a relatively obscure background. He had never been truly poor, but he had only in his later life been one of the silver spoon crowd. It was 1934, but despite the economic disaster that had ravaged the country, he had been wise and had remained one of the few that had been unhurt on Black Tuesday, October 29. He wanted a final gathering from those who had hovered around his money for so long, so he had stipulated in his will that they stay a couple of days at his old mansion before they got their rewards for their fidelity, kindness, or received what was due to them from family obligation. Among the mourners and hopeful benificiaries was Bella Welmer, a young wavy-haired blonde almost young enough to have been Harmen'sgranddaughter. She had been his fianc and now stood to get a lot. She had once been what the Romans would have called a legacy hunter, and what people in these days would call a gold-digger. But those who knew her knew that had changed. Though she had just been a greedy teenager looking for an easy way to sit in the lap of luxury, she had come to truly love John Harmen. She openly admitted to her mercenary wishes before, and was the first to criticize herself for them, and meant every word, but she was still here. Another was Lizzy Harkness, a dark-haired woman who was the daughter of one of Harmen's old fishing buddies. Quieter and softer than Bella but decidedly melancholic, it was hard to tell which of them was more beautiful or more likeable. Her father was good friends with Harmen and had died a few weeks before. She wasn't after the money and was here by strict respect. She was a working woman who mourned her father's loss far more than she cared for what she might get. There was also her brother Charlie and Mr. Preston, a teacher Harmen had hired in secret to give Lizzy an educational leg up where her schooling was incomplete. He very clearly had other things on his mind when he looked at the dark girl, but he taught the girl with great skill, even though watching them brought one to wonder who was the more intelligent of the two as Lizzy was unmistakably clever while Preston was what one would call a \"know-nothing know-it-all\" who lacked any real sense and had a lot less learning than he claimed he did. There was also Mr. Jacob Goldduster, a man who was one of the least corruptible people Harmen had ever known and a guy who had always been dependable to do what he could for those less fortunate. He didn't want the money really, but he respected Harmen's wishes. There was also Mr. Peter Venus, a man who seemed very worldly and wise, and who was very handsome. He was a man who really liked the house and was constantly peering into corners, though he never quite said what he was looking for. Learned and suave, the man was beloved by the old Man and a good friend of Goldduster. Also, last and certainly least was Mr. Smiddy. Smiddy was a man badly injured in the first world war, moving about on a peg leg and ranting at all he saw. Unlike Bella, he was an unashamed golddiggger and was quick to claim he wanted the money whenever an opportunity showed itself. He constantly carried a copy of \"The decline and fall of the Roman Empire\" which he read from noisily and obnoxiously, much to the shegrin of all present. All would be glad when this guy got his share and left. All of these were here when the others arrived. Others that inspired fear, as the thoughts watched and waited, wanting out, though it was not yet time. These new ones were more powerful and wise than any before, and though the thinkers did not know why they feared, what they had done for centuries untold might be being brought to an end."

        "writing_prompt": "In a city where monsters of all shapes and sizes live together in harmony, the annual Founding Day celebration is interrupted by the sudden appearance of mythical beings thought long gone\u2014colorless, shadowless humans, elves, and dwarves. What could have brought them back, and why do they look so different from the legends?",
        "story": "Chapter 1: Creatures of Myth It was a late winter day as several students were led from the confines of the Deken Academy, the local school dedicated to teaching the children of the community all the necessary learning to become productive adults in the town of Freln, were towards the city hall. Today was the aniversery of the founding of the town, over 1200 years ago. Students as small as kobolds and as large as giants marched through the streets, along buildings of equally varying size. The students learned that when the town was first built, all buildings for one size of creature were put all in one place, putting the space work as efficiently as possible for the community. Studies had been made on the different rates at which races reproduced and so allowance was made for expansion, but problems had emerged. The separate neighborhoods created cities within Freln where the smaller monsters had formed into a hostile camp against the larger and the early community had almost been destroyed in an early city-wide riot as the big warred against the small. The solution was that all races would be put together, with dragons living next door to goblins and shops for spriggans sitting next to shops that served ogres. It admittedly made the city look a little strange, and sometimes even ugly, but with lanes on the cobblestone streets for different sizes and all monsters coming into contact with all the others every day, the community was extremely peaceful. The lesson today was a history of Freln and its place in the Nation of Duril, but it wasnt the same lesson for all. The young ones would see a play put on by a childrens theater about Freln, while the older students, who would appreciate the significance, would tour the small museum at the Freln City hall. Each Student had their own thoughts about what history was worth, but what they saw as they approached the large square in the center of the town, in front of the strange building that was built in 3 wings of very different sizes made it difficult to think of Frelnian or Durilian history. There was a crowd of gawking monsters looking over a crowd of strange creatures in the center of the square. There were rumblings and babblings as each monster who was already there discussed the impossible happening. In the center of the square, there were several dozen creatures that were all but mythical, not that their existence had ever been doubted, but nobody thought they would ever be seen again. The children gazed upon elves, dwarves, humans, and several others for the first time, and most of the adults were in exactly the same position. The mysterious beings looked frightened, angry, or just confused as they felt the eyes of all manner of creatures upon them, their grey or white skins creased with worry, their eyes, usually black or grey stared with horror or amazement about them, and most of them didnt even cast a shadow in the cold, but brilliant light of a winter sun. What was strangest about them was their utter lack of color. Even crude illustraitions of them showed them to wear bright colors and have brightly colored eyes, and sometimes even hair. Some humans and elves wer pale, but they had some color to their skin where these looked like paper. This was far more of an event than the Frelnian museum."

        "writing_prompt": "After a school bus crash and a truck accident in the heart of the October Natural Forest, rumors swirl about the elusive \"October Dryad\"\u2014a mysterious figure said to protect the woods. But as hunters, students, and law enforcement converge, the forest seems to hold secrets far older and wilder than anyone expected.",
        "story": "Pines, Pintoaks, and willows grew in abundance along the narrow blacktopped path through the October Natural forest. A Truck sat on its side, tipped over from a turn that was taken just a little too sharply by a man who had thought about taking a shortcut along a narrow road. Behind it, with the front end smashed a bit was a schoolbus from Thatchington High. The driver had been far too confident and had been riding right up the back of the semi. This couldve been the siteof a tragedy, but miraculously, nobody in either of the vehicles was hurt beyond a slight bruising of maybe an arm or leg. A trucker sat to the side of his ruined machine, waiting for when he could get his wet goods out of sight in this dry county. If he knew more than just the forest rangers were on the way, hed be more worried. Because parts of the forest were considered to be part of Thatchington just as some Tenessee cities were seen as being partly Kentuckian, the local police would need to look into this as well. The bus had been carrying some students from the high school who had been found to be too gifted to be cooped up in the building. A young teen from DC was one of these as the Tenessee schools were not particularly good and so most of what they were teaching her she had learned effectively years ago. It was either working in the forest or farm work. Shed get a little of that too before she made her final decision on what intern program she wanted. And even though the farming sneak peak was next month, a farm worker or too had also come to the forest on their own account. Elk and more kinds of White-tailed deer had been reintroduced a few years ago, but without the reintroduction of any predators larger than coyotes with the paranoid fear of wolves or a larger bear population, the Deer had bred like only deer could and the animals had made nuissances of themselves in Thatchintons fields. Overpopulating in the forest and thus streaming out of it in search of food every sunset and sunrise. Hunting was not only approved of in this town, it was considered a duty. Without hunters keeping their numbers low, every orchard and field in the town was at risk. Many of the deer and elk even had multiple hunting seasons per year, so many farm workers came in for trophies and venessin when they could. And in the shadows, the October Dryad watched. The Law knew there was some young lady squatter in the forest, but there were tales among the young and/or stupid of some maiden of the forest, some saying she was an indian, others, a criminal, and still others, what the sasquatch was really like. What exactly she looked like even the law and rangers couldnt say, other than the forest was peppered with little improvised shelters, small animals were shot with crude arrows obviously not from any store, and little female footprints were always near the water. As for the Dryad herself, she had to come closer to this road more often, either it was a mine or something new, but some of the streams she knew about were no longer safe to drink."

        "writing_prompt": "In a frigid northern city where titans have mysteriously begun to appear, two young hunters, constantly shadowed by surgeons to keep their inner wraiths in check, must uncover the truth behind the attacks before the town expels them\u2014or worse, the titans strike again.",
        "story": "Shlossheim was one of the Northernmost cities in the known world. It had longer winters than almost anywhere else and as the hunt strolled down the wide center street, it was clear that the locals built their city with this in mind. Even though Schhlossheim was not a city accustomed to war, homes were build like little stone fortresses, or rather, little ceramic fortresses as many of the chimneys had ceramic tiles about them, to make sure they retained the escaping heat from inner fires. Each of the hunting party had experienced the large ceramic stoves and how effectively they heated a room as well as they had been put up for the past 3 days by the townsfolk. Titans carved out enormous territories, and yet the many beasts of the colder North did not go anywhere near this city. It had been that way in Capulan, Storp, and Gilgrim as well right before the sudden appearances of some of the most powerful titans the hunters had seen in a long time. What was more was that the titans werent any of the many hundred that were known, and many had died, not only of the hapless populace, but even the hunters when they arrived as the bizarre powers of the beasts proved to be nasty, and lethal surprises for everyone involved. They were searching for evidence of titan territorial markings, the presence of nearby titans, or even simply a sighting, but if something didnt happen soon, they were probably going to be expelled from the town, it wasnt safe to have beacons around, and hunters, two of them no less, were even worse. The hunters in question, two younger men, hadnt received the same dignified treatment the others had and stayed with a young surgeon named Hamon, along with his mentor. It wasnt a game, hunters were no less dangerous than the titans and a surgeon needed to be ready at all times to quell the influence of an acrimonious wraith to make sure the hunters behaved themselves. Hamon had been told he had to deal with only one wraith, so the fact that he was dealing with two hunters definitely surprised him. He worked twelve-hour shifts with a colleague and they were never more than 10 feet away from the young men, and as for the young men and their wraith, they might have chafed at the tight control, and if they were chafing, some of that was definitely due to their own inner demon, who was urging them constantly that they wouldnt enjoy themselves unless they ditched the wet blanket surgeons. The others however, had a rare bit of comfort with local families and were given free room and board wherever they decided to stay. The Huntmaster would soon have to deal with the mayor, and the beacons were simply to take brief constitutionals around the streets, just in case some invisible titan was watching. There had been invisible titans before, and maybe that was the secret of the sudden attacks on the cities. Even so, the hunting party had a definite break from hardtack and jerk meat and the many annoyances of the road."

        "writing_prompt": "When a secretive magical society attempts to harness immense power on Alcatraz Island, their ritual is interrupted by the arrival of two otherworldly beings. Now, scattered traces of corrupted magic and mysterious golden trinkets warn a handful of unlikely individuals\u2014can they uncover the truth and stop the Golden King before the Bay Area falls under his spell?",
        "story": "They had the 115 magi they would need. The San Francisco branch of the Danelon were distinctly low on magical energy, and with favors they owed in Chinatown, and a general quota they owed to the high council, a big draw of energy was exactly what they needed. From all over the west coast of the so-called independent nation of the United States, came some of the most talented Danelon Magi. But it hadnt been a speedily-perfected plan. There were a lot of grudges in the mixture of the needed mystics that had to be ironed out, and the exact best time to open the gate for some more power had not yet been determined. They knew where to do it though. Alcatraz Island was no longer a prison, but the rough waters in the bay, and the fact that the tours of the prison were strictly scheduled meant they would have more than enough time. A few quick spells and the tour boats to the island were lent by the night watchmen, along with the consent of a tour operator. Theyd never remember these guys, which was exactly how it should be. It was best when even the Danelons biggest coups would not be remembered by any of the norms out there. Ralph Bach, a man who could have known Johan Sabastian personally, drew imaginary lines in his head, making sure that the rest were exactly where they needed to be. This would be one of the largest gatherings of magical energy in the 21st century and it would all be for his glory. Perhaps he might even make a better focus, being able to draw on even more of what the Danelon gathered rather than the rations of magical energy he was provided with. He had overdrawn on the communal store of magic many times through his focus and it was why he wasnt in Las Angeles, New York, or Beijing right now. The anchors all formed the inner core of the formation, some of them chained down as draws this big could cause them to flail and hurt themselves when the energy came flooding through. A larger core stood outside the main gate, in the dark as they did not want to alert the outside world to what they were doing. Ralph lifted his hand, the bronze ring on his finger beginning to glow with a slight light of its own, and the chanting and gesturing began, while the Anchors, those who would take the brunt of the energy flowing out of the gate gritted their teeth but also kept up the ritualistic gesturing and incanting that they too needed in order that all this energy that would come forth would fall into the Danelons hands. Over the gate, the gate that many prisoners had passed through, a curtain of glowing colors formed. Greens, blues, pinks, and oranges danced over the opening, and all the Danelon felt a surge of power. The power grew. The Most ambitious of the Danelon felt that their schemes were in reach; the official they desired to control, the tech they wanted destroyed, or the medicines they wanted developed, or conveniently deemed too dangerous all seemed within reach. Alie Haiden: A blonde woman almost as old as Ralph, but not as successful, saw herself finally developing the invisible fire a fire that seared the soul right out of a being, leaving no physical residue in the corpse. She had always been a scholar. Arnold Kant, a younger man, saw the many failed missions of assassins lately, and saw a way to infuse human muscles with the strength of Tungsten Steel, weakness would be a thing of the past in the Danelon and it would all be thanks to him. The glistening curtain tingled like a chime on a summer day porch. And the energy came in an ever-increasing flow as it was opened wider. The light grew brighter, and despite the toll being taken on the anchors, the Danelon functioned as a well-knit group in the elation of a successful draw, despite the many petty grievances many of the members of this team had with others. The music of a doorway never got old, and more instruments joined the piece, strings, chimes, bells, and flutes all added their voices coming from the door, unlike any instruments norms knew but flutes, strings, and others, were the closest thing a human mind could understand. The energy was almost drawn when a noise, far more discordant than the noise of magic sounded in the empty prison, echoing off of the old tower, the hard concrete walls, and bouncing about in the cell-lined corridors. It sounded much like the braying of a donkey, but somehow had a human malevolence to it as well. This had happened before. Ralph made the gesture and several of the Magi began to change their chanting and they began to thrust their hands at the opening. To drive back whatever was coming through. There were two forms striding through the gate. One a shapely female form, though the ground vibrated with every thudding step she took, while the other, larger and more muscular, seemingly even heavier walked a few steps in front. He was the first to be seen, and if it were not for his donkeys ears, he would actually have been quite handsome. Again the strange Braying laugh, and a quick gesture and the gate behind the man closed, several of the Danelon Anchors fell unconscious, and the strange, golden creature looked around. This will simply not do. The strange donkey-eared man said. With the magic collection suddenly ended, bits of the magic, corrupted by the two creatures spread out into the bay Area, the only clues that would warn those who could stop the Golden king with his magic touch. A few hours later, each would find something a bit odd, a trinket of silver or gold, that would let them know that something was wrong. Whether assassin, Danelon exile, or even a simple amateur journalist, they would hear the warnings, and if they didnt, the Bay, and perhaps even more would be in danger."

        "writing_prompt": "On a sweltering summer night in the shadowy streets of Mousehole, a lone officer is sent to break up a fight at the local park pool, knowing the heat has everyone on edge and the line between order and chaos is razor-thin. What awaits in the dark corners of the neighborhood tonight?",
        "story": "It was a very hot summer in Rootgold, and even at night, when most of the animals came out of hiding, the air remained stifling and hot. The chirping of insects almost brought to a low roar by the high heat and humidity was the only natural sound. It was too hot for the night birds to come out of hiding, and they probably wouldnt seek food until just before sunrise, when the temperature might drop below 95 and perhaps a bit of dew would give everyone something to drink. Everyone would have something to drink tonight, except about half of the Mousehole. Over the past week, water mains had broken in 5 different places and now far too many had no clean drinking water. The convenience stores had bottled water, but most couldnt afford to get enough, even if the prices werent suddenly raised to absurd levels. The Cathouse, the name the neighborhood used to refer to their station, had cracked down on gougers as much as they could, but there werent enough cops in Mousehole to make sure that the prices stayed reasonable. There also wasnt enough space in the small station jail to lock up every criminal they found. But it was hot, thirsty weather, which always produced hot, thirsty, and angry people. The violence would spike tonight for sure. It was well past 10, and the sun had gone down. Most of the city of Rootgold was still lit up, with artificial lighting, and it was the bane to stargazers throughout the area, but Mousehole was pretty dark. There werent as many street lights, and as every parent knew, people were a lot like children, and they were more likely to misbehave when they thought they couldnt be seen. Of the few lights Mousehole did have, about a quarter didnt work at all or had been broken and never repaired. It wasnt uncommon for a beat cop to come upon people in the dark and not see them until they were only a few feet away. Almost every cop had gotten skunked before and it wasnt uncommon to have a run-in with a coyote, coydog, or raccoon every once in a while. Police were always on edge here, partially because the neighborhood was very spooky, even to experienced cops, filled with the sounds of humanity and animals while they walked, nearly blind along the streets. Sometimes it was loud, and sometimes it was disturbingly quiet. Where the cops could only hear their own breathing and the clomping sound of their own bootsteps. There were the usual faire of night travelers in the Mousehole, you had the two gangs: the foxes in their red and white, and the eagles in their gold and black, women, and sometimes men, of the night, drug dealers, and what every cop learned quickly, mostly just everyday people going about their business: needing that one last thing at the store or going to see someone who could use their help. An officer got a call as he walked alongChekovsky Avenue. Theres been a fight at the Roberto Park pool, get there and put an end to it. Were running low on space in the jail tonight, so only arrest someone who really causes trouble. Came the voice of the captain Vera Fife, one of the best officers in the force. People joked that the Hispanic woman had risen through the ranks so fast because she grew tired of being called Deputy Fife, but she knew how to handle a gun and knew how to handle police work with both skill and subtlety. She gave the lone officer the directions and waited for his response, though he was already making his way towards Roberta Park."

What secrets lie beneath the circus's dazzling performances, and why do they linger in some towns far longer than others?",
        "story": "The Circus was headed into Marseilles, and the port city looked like it could really use the cheer of a circus. The city was an industrial center and clouds of smog filled the skies, giving the sky a nasty brown color, or at least orange on a good day. The market square, at the center of the harbor district would be the site of the performances for the next 4 days. It was hard to figure out how long the circus would be at any one point. The children had spent only 18 hours in Lyons and then for some reason, squatted down and put on full performances for 3 solid weeks in a little town in wine country that had fewer villagers than could possibly have been profitable. The circus staff on that stop had actually more than doubled the towns population. But you didnt question the manager on such things .Menindez made you afraid to ask about what was going on, except in the odd cases where he got mad if you didnt. It was hard to peg Old Ed, as a couple of the English and American performers called Eduardo Menindez, the grizzled 65-year-old manager who could pass for 45 most of the time. He was the real one that kept the circus running, but even in business affairs, he usually used the ring mistress, Clara Poe, an American who did triple duty as public face of the Circus Europa, Ring Mistress, and trick shooter. The little Dark-haired woman of about 40 was sometimes called clairpow playfully by many at the circus, and the name was used when there were enough English people in the crowd to like the onomatopoeia. Even when she wasnt doing her act, she carried a number of guns on her person, most of them with flashy ammunition or even comical attachment or noises involved, because her act was often quite comical. But as they looked at the harbor, there was the mix of people that had made Marseilles a hotbed of activity, both good and bad, since pre-Roman times. As a Mediterranean port, the city was part of the known world since before writing, and people from Africa, Asia, and all over Europe had gathered there for trade, intermingling, and at times, violence. Clara had announced that morning that England had changed its tune again and now was praising Germany to the heavens. Unfortunately, Germany had just decided that France was its closest ally. The circus had learned from her reports that the uneasy situation between the three countries changed almost every couple of weeks, though it was becoming more unstable. But life went on in Circus Europa, and the brilliant performing children were still at work preparing for the afternoons performance. Whether they worked in the sideshows, or would be in the center ring, the kids always had extensive training exercises each day and although they were paid and treated well, they were worked hard as well. Now each one was putting the finishing touches on preparing what they would do today."
