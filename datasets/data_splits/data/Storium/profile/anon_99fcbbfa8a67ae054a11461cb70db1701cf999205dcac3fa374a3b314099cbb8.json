            "story_name": "John Harmen is dead and now a horde of heirs are gathered at his manor for the reading of the will as it stipulates that the heirs all be present in person at the reading in order for it to be valid. \n\nBut there is a dark history of the various gatherings that have taken place at the Harmen Mansion in Eastern Virgina. So many heirs in the past have gone crazy or died violent deaths immediately after or at times, even during their brief stays at the Manor, turning them into vicious, heartless creatures of unimaginable  depravity and even rumored odd powers. \n\nHowever, the force behind the evil in this house is unaware that this time, it is dealing with an unusually talented generation of humanity that may in fact, put an end to its machinations forever. \n\n======\n\nThis story uses the occult-pulp horror deck as a jumping off point but like all my stories, custom cards are the norm for me the narrator, and are encouraged among players. This story will not have globetrotting like the default, but rather the manor, the setting for all of the story's action will change dramatically as the story progresses. \n\nAll characters are eitare either heirs or close associates of heirs such as siblings, spouses, or very close work associates and they will work through the machinations of the evil in the house to come out of this experience alive and squash the evil itself. \n\nThis story blends eldritch horror with mystery. It is also somewhat inspired by \"Our Mutual Friend\" by Charles Dickens. Not so much that I am recycling the plot, but the inherritence, part of the manifestation of the evil force, and a couple of the character names are taken from the story's basic premises. You don't need to know anything about the novel to play. \n\nFor more info, see the rules and info for invitees sections on this game's page.\n\nAlso, If you are one of those who has not yet become a member of Storium and thus cannot join games, PM me or contact on the forum for this game and I'll send you an invite so you can join, under the condition that you will have revision requests so you are still auditioning just like everyone else and don't automatically get in.",

Each of those races had wondered what would happen if the monsters that lurked in dungeons, forests, and the forboding snow-capped mountains ever took their lands. \n\nIt turns out, that the \"monsters\" largely formed societies much like those of the \"good races\" though of course, these societies were much more cosmopolitan. Schools were formed, cities built, and nations emerged.\n\nWhat the monsters never understood was why the ancient races of humanity, elvenkind, smallfolk, fairies, and their like vanished in the first place, literally overnight if the legends are true.\n\nWhat is even more astounding is just as swiftly as they vanished, those folk are back, seeming to not even know that time has passed.\n\nIt is up to some monster children to unravel the mystery from their school, and perhaps stop something far bigger even than what made several races vanish from the world entirely all those years ago. \n\n==========\n\nThis story is supposed to be a somewhat family--friendly story of fantasy monsters saving the world from an incideous and horrific evil. The concept is somewhat inspired, though very loosely by Paul S. Kemp's \"Shadowbred.\" \n\n",

Just miles and miles of adjacent farms, a gas station, and a Mom and Pop store. \n\nBut there is more to Thatchington than there seems to be, and there is a dangerous criminal hiding among the fields and farms, more of a drug trade than people would like to admit, and the inherent ugliness that is hiding just below the surface of southern hospitality. \n\nBut there is too much involvement in the normal humdrum life for most to notice, it is up to a lot of outdoors types to uncover the dangers lurking in this community. \n\n========\n\nThis adventure story is based on the Edgar Walace sensational crime story \"The Runaway Tramp\" and is an adventure mystery story taking place in rural farmland with adjacent forest.  It is likely to adopt some of the tone from sensational detective fiction of the 1920s and will probably embrace some of the tropes. no knowledge of the original source material is necessary or even helpful.\n\nCharacters should be comfortable outdoors or have at least a connection to them and will probably spend a lot of time outdoors, even in between scenes, overnight, or in bad weather.\n\n",

The hunters and their teams are charged with finding out how the titans are entering the cities undetected, appearing from nowhere despite their truly enormous size.\n\n=======\n\nThis game largely uses the gargantuan world as is, except in addition to the action component, it has a strong mystery element and the heroes are going to learn a lot about both the wraiths and the titans in their search to end the destructive ambushes.\n\nThis game combines the gargantuan kickstarter world with aspects of the classic Annie Hanes mystery novel \"Who Killed Charmian Carslake\" though no knowledge of the book is necessary or even helpful to play the game as the connection is only very loose and Annie Hanes herself wouldn't recognize the similarity of the planned plot if it weren't pointed out.\nAlso, the hunters will be in more urban environments more often in this story because of necessary socialization to solve the mystery and also the strange sudden appearances of the titans in large cities.\n",

However, the basis in Shakespeare is very loose and no knowledge of the play is particularly necessary or even helpful..\n\nThis game will have horror elements but will also involve quite a bit of action and sci-fi elements as well.\n\nKing Midas and his Queen will be more anthropomorphic and less lovecraftian than is typical for most of the nightmare creatures inherent in this world.",
