            "story_name": "The Collapse takes place in the City of Irkutsk, Russia during a pivotal point immediately preceding the fall of modern society. It is set in modern times (aka: now) and chronicles the events leading up to and what occurs during an apocalyptic human extinction event. \n\nThe details of the event will be as unknown to the player as to their character so the player should have an open mind in terms of accepting the type of apocalypse to come; whether it be from natural disaster or robot uprising, nuclear war or asteroid strike, zombie apocalypse or alien invasion, or even a combination of more than one of the above - you should probably be up for it as a player. Be aware, I am not going for camp here - I want it to be gritty and dark, but with a heart.\n\nThis will be a solo game (1 Player only) driven largely by the narrative between your player and the narrators NPC (your characters companion) and will focus on how one person tries to survive a desperate and terrifying situation. This NPC might be a relative, a lover or acquaintance or a perfect stranger but it must be someone your character would be willing to go through this event with, and someone who there would be an emotional impact in losing for some reason. You tell me who this person is and we will create them before the start of the game. I do reserve the right to put my own spin on the character naturally. The more compelling the bond/relationship between your character and their companion, the more likely I am to accept it.\n\nI'm looking for relatively normal characters leading relatively normal lives; flawed but with what most people would classify as a \"regular job\" (ie: no military Special Operatives, spies/ninja's or hackers, etc). \n\nOne caveat about the main characters job is at the start of the game your character will be working in another city from where they live so its important their job be of the sort that requires him/her to travel abroad. Factor this into your writing of your own character as well as the writing of the outline for the NPC character who will accompany them.\n\nYour character should have friends and family written into their backstory and should have a believable real-world subplot. There should be things they need to do, to take care of, to get to, etc during this event.  \n\nAs a player you should be willing to start play in a relatively mundane scenario which will eventually escalate as events of the apocalypse begin to unfold. Expect more of a slow burn than constant, kick-down-the-door action sequences.\n\nYour character should have some sort of work link to the aging Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station in the area. Characters can be locals or foreigners, working as consultants or contractors or something else. They may or may not speak Russian, but if you choose to have your character not speak it, your companion should. There will be a major remediation project going on at the dam, but as winter is starting (Its November) delays have resulted in some complications. I\u2019m currently planning for the story to start with the main character supposed to be having a day off for a national holiday (The Day of Unity), but they will be called into work for some reason, or perhaps choose to work for some reason. \n\nI will select the player who writes the best and most interesting character and NPC combination, aka: the person who gives me the most material for future events and interesting encounters to explore.\n\n**Potential Story Themes & Aspects**: *Desperation, man vs nature, chaos, loss, disaster, post-apocalypse, revenge, violence, urban survival, scavenging, terror, exploration, losing hope, escape.*\n\n\n**Inspiration**: *The Road, The Last of Us, Children of Men, Quiet Earth, Snowpiercer, DayZ .*",

            "story_name": "#FALL#\n\nIt's been nine years. \n\nNine years since the shit hit the fan. \n\nNine years since the comfortable, American way of life most people knew came to an abrupt and terrifying end. \n\nNine years since you, one of the so-called _\"lucky few\"_, entered a remote bunker on the northern edge of the Ute Mountain Tribe Reservation in southern Colorado called _The Citadel_. \n\nNine years since a viral outbreak swept across the southern United States of America in an unprecedented epidemic. \n\nNine years since you were shut in and the world was shut out.\n\nSaying life is different now would be a gross oversimplification of the situation. You left your life behind. Loved ones. Places. Things. You left behind a part of yourself. For most they have lived two lives; life above ground before lockdown and life underground after. \n\nThere is little comfort now. You have shelter and you have air to breathe and occasionally a bite to eat and stinking water to drink but things have reached a point of miserable desperation and everyone knows it.\n\nIt's different than it was when you first came to this place. You bought into the dream of survival. Bought into a survivalist time-share scheme so you could secure a place in a private bunker facility. A place for those with the wherewithal to know something terrible was about to happen to the world. How could you have known though that by some twist of fate or divine intervention or something else, you would actually be one of the lucky few at _The Citadel_ during their time-share period when the epidemic occurred? \n\nNine years ago there had been enough food and clean water, fresh air, electricity and other luxuries to keep you and yours alive for a long, long time here. _Forty years_ Jack Lakota, the owner and developer had said dourly. _The Citadel is setup so twenty-five people could live in there for forty years._ That's what he'd said. \n\nBut it had only been nine years and you are starving. Everyone is starving. The air in the bunker is stale and the purification system needs constant maintenance. The wastewater pumps have all failed. Electricity is rationed, with the generators running as much as three hours every third day, and one hour a day otherwise. The water is salty and tastes of chlorine and people are starting to weaken and get sick, and _die_. \n\nAs a matter of fact in the nine years since you've been locked down, eleven of the original twenty-three people in _The Citadel_ have died. \n\nAll you know about the reasons you were locked in is there was a viral outbreak of some kind, possibly ebola though that's only conjecture. Whatever it was struck hard and there was a frenzy of rioting and violence in the days preceding the decision to lock-down. \n\nThe Citadel has been under military control under the leadership of Virginia Sterret, a United States Marine Corp. Captain ever since the decision was made to lock it down. A few days after that call was made the communication center at the bunker went down. The surface level compound had been attacked by desperate looters who had destroyed defences there including killing several soldiers and damaging the communication tower. The hatch remained sound and Sterret has kept it that way ever since.\n\nAs no cellular or other communication devices were allowed in _The Citadel_ contact with the outside world was lost. As were the rules, the civilians left their devices with the warrant officer in the primary storage lock-up on entry. They could pick them up on leaving but how could anyone have known that day would never come? How could they have known that when the wastewater pumps failed it would cause the sewage lines to fill and eventually the weight of those lines caused the pipes to rupture? How could they foresee that release of filthy water would collapse the ceiling of the corridor that connected the rest of the facility with primary storage? \n\nAnd now, though the fences have all been fixed and reinforced and there has been a vigorous effort by the survivors to build greenhouses and plant and grow fruit and vegetables in the compound, the harvest has been small. Everyone works and helps out; does their part. That's the rules. Though the civilians have been up to the surface they have not been outside the fence and can only see treetops and the sky above the riot barricades and concertina-wire wrapped, ten foot tall chain-link fence. \n\nMilitary patrols outside the fences have brought back some food and supplies they managed to scavenge but they don't talk about the state of the world outside. Whatever the state of things there's not enough to go round. _Too many mouths to feed._\n\nIt's no secret the military have been meeting and discussing things in secret and casting sidelong looks at the civilians. They don't speak openly about their patrols, only saying things like \"it's not safe outside the fence\" or \"you'd never make it down Ute Mountain\" when asked. Its also no secret that relations between the two parts of the same group have been fractious. Though Capt. Sterret is a taciturn leader she has thus far proven firm but fair in most dealings. The rationing of food, water and medical supplies has been difficult but she's developed a system that works. \n\nAll in all its a fucking miracle you've survived this long but you know things are reaching a point where survival at _The Citadel_ will be impossible for everyone and know that something must be done, and soon. But What?",

In this alternate version of real history, something else is occurring as well. Something terrifying and not of this world which the characters will be confronted with as the night goes on. You must face the dangers of that night just like everyone else.\n\nOnly you are not like everyone else. \n\nYou are special in some way. Always have been. You possess an ability or abilities that surpass typical human physical and/or mental norms. You were born this way, likely raised normally having kept secret and kept hidden the nature of your abilities out of necessity. \n\nIn 1977 America was in recession. Homelessness, poverty, petty crime and drug-addiction plagued the once proud City of New York. The war in Vietnam had ended two years earlier and its forgotten veterans had returned to America shell-shocked and rejected, unable to find work and in many cases addicted to drugs. \n\nPresident Ford had just turned down a loan request for the City, saying there would be no bail-out. This was followed by Washington demanding Austerity measures which saw many police, fire department and other city workers laid off. The Son of Sam was terrorizing the City, having slain six and wounded seven others since the summer of 1976. Star Wars had been playing in theaters for nearly two months and with the city in the middle of a terrible heatwave the New York Mets were set to play against the Chicago Cubs at Shea Stadium. \n\nThat's when the storm hit. \n\nA violent thunder and lightning storm unlike anything people had seen before occurred in Westchester County and caused a cascade-effect, knocking out a major generating station and then a north-south feeder before several other generation centers went down and the entire city was plunged into darkness and chaos. Civil unrest, looting and arson followed. \n\nViolence, theft and other lawlessness will plague the streets with disorganized gangs of looters, crazed individuals and much, much worse everywhere. Something terrifying and not of this world has come to New York with purpose and determination.\n\nYour characters will escape the prison and find themselves on the streets in the middle of the blackout, in the middle of chaos. In the middle of the end of the world. \n\nUnless you can stop it.",

We had no immunity. Rich countries underestimated its virulence. Small, developing countries didn't have the resources or education and training to stem the tide of infections. The survival rate started low. Lower than the flu. People were recovering. \n\nMeasures were taken. They weren't strict or soon enough in many cases. The infection rate gre. The mortality rate grew. They closed borders. Stopped schools and non-essential workplaces. Just for a while they said. To slow the progress of the disease. At first they expected it to last a couple of weeks. Then it was months. \n\nIt took mostly the old and infirm and the very young at first. Those with underlying health conditions. Smokers and those with cardiovascular disease.  Then, people who had recovered got sick again. And everyone who got sick twice died. \n\nIt affected the healthy, the strong and the able-bodied. There was a desperate scramble for a cure that ultimately met with failure as the civilized world fell into dissolution, its societies failing in the face of cataclysmal population loss. \n\nThings fell apart fast as the mortality rate increased. The power grid failed. Order could not be maintained. Cities and towns burned, were looted, gutted and left abandoned. \n\nSome who lived in remote areas or who managed to find such places afterwwars managed to survive.  In the time that's passed they have had to survive by living off the land, by scavenging and hunting and growing what they could in order to eat. These they called _The Unlucky Few_.\n\nYou are a member of such a group. Having survived the initial outbreak and the time since then you are part of a small farming commune in Grand Junction, Colorado. Your group is made up of a few hardy folk who gathered around the idea of living not only for yourselves but also for one another. \n\nYour farmstead is remote and self sufficient. You get few visitors. A couple of times a year a trader comes through to bring necessities and news of the places they have been in exchange for some of your harvest. A trapper family who lives in the mountains north of you winters at your commune in exchange for furs and meat every year. \n\nThese are your only contacts with the outside world and neither of them bring stories that persuade you there is anything worth leaving your commune for.\n\nYou are harvesting your crops now, readying for the winter. Preparing the buildings for the snow and for the cold, chopping firewood. \n\nEverything you want and need is right here. It is a hard but simple life. You work, you raise livestock, you plant and harvest. You store food for the winter, you watch water levels and annual snow pack. There is peace and prosperity to this life.\n\nBut like all good things this too must come to an end.\n",
