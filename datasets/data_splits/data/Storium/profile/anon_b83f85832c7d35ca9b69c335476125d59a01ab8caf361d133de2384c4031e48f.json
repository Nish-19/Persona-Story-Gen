        "writing_prompt": "On a frigid November morning atop the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Dam, tensions simmer between Konstantine, distracted by his phone and last night's regrets, and Zoryana, who senses there's more to his mood than the biting wind outside. What secrets lie beneath the surface of their strained silence, and what \"things\" does Konstantine need to take care of?",
        "story": "#DAY 1# **Day of Unity - Russian Holiday** **Friday, November 4, 2016 7:13AM** The black Volga 4-Runner SUV sat idling in the gravel alongside Ulitsa Plotina GES, the narrow two lane street that ran across the top of the Irkustk Hydroelectric Dam. Konstantine was at the wheel, alternating his attention from his styrofoam cup of black coffee and his phone. He was in a mood, and even before they had pulled off the road and into the gravel clearing on top of the dam he had been growing steadily more frustrated by the text messages he was receiving. The smell of stale alcohol and cigarettes hadn't escaped Zoryana when she had gotten into the SUV, nor had the fresh, purple-colored stamp on the back of his left hand just below the cuff of his heavy bomber jacket. These days he only smoked when he drank and only drank when he was out at the nightclubs. He'd been out last night and today he was paying for it. Hell, they were both paying for it. He had probably been with Yelena again and had predictably sought the company of his boorish friend Roman to escape his girlfriends ire. Roman was single and worked with his father fix months out of the year up in the Norilsk sector in Tunguska, about three hours drive north of Irkutsk. When he wasn't working Roman spent his time doing his best to live like a rock star and doing what he could to see to it Konstantine became and remained single. They were longtime friends but even Konstantine had of late complained about the constant drinking and partying. Yelena was loyal, independent and beautiful. She had high expectations for herself and for Konstantine and saw Roman for the degenerate he was. \"Yebat' menya.\" Konstantine cursed under his breath, shaking his head and tossing his phone into the cup holder beside him. \"Yebat' menya.\" he said again, staring out the window. There was a little less venom in his voice this time and some of the conviction had gone out of his words as well. Outside the SUV, a red city bus with electric trolley arms sped by going well above the posted 60 kilometer an hour limit. Its passing buffeted their vehicle, throwing up a wake of dirty snow. Beyond the road was a stretch of beach; white not from sand but snow and stretching along the southern side of the dam. Beyond that was the reservoir that was the wide Angara River. Flanked on both sides of the roughly 3 km wide river were low treed hills that stretched on into a widening river basin which some 50 km upstream took its waters from massive Lake Baikal. \"Zory, here.\" Konstantine said, holding out a set of keys for her. His phone vibrated in the cup-holder and the screen lit up again. \"I have some things I need to take care of,\" he said, pulling his black trapper hat lower on his forehead and picking up his phone distractedly. Outside the wind was howling, stirring up particles of ice and snow which assailed the windows, making a crackling sound which warned about the cold that was to come."

        "writing_prompt": "In the depths of a crumbling underground refuge, Captain Virginia Sterret wrestles with the brutal truth of dwindling supplies and impossible choices. As winter looms and survival grows uncertain, what sacrifices will she make to keep hope alive?",
        "story": "#Truth# Truth is a problem. This truth is a thing that can't be denied and can't be changed. Not anymore. Its all left bare now. No secret stores; no vaults of riches, no reserves, no treasures to plunder. Not down here. What you see is what you get. You can write what you want. You can think and you can say what you want. But the truth doesnt care. If your situation is fucked up, well then thats just what it is. Its not anything else so why pretend like it is? Dont try to dress it up none; make it pretty. It is what it is. If we run out of food and water we all die. That's it. That's the truth. And _it is what it fucking is._ Captain Virginia Sterret, or the lingering wraith that had once been her sat hunched over at a military field desk looking over her own scrawled writing. Column by column, row by row, going down the list in silence. Well, silent except the occasional whispered murmur as she read over something particularly vexing. The skitter of her pen as she tossed and rolled it across the desk only to pick it up a moment later. Silent except for that. Pudding, banana. she said, scoffing; the tip of her pen hovering over the entry. She looked at the total again. Thirteen units She repeated it in her head. _Thirteen._ _Holy fuck. Last thirteen. Almost all gone. Chas is going to fucking love that._ That was hardly the worst news on the page though. Line after line had been crossed off the list entire. Drawn to zero then scratched out. Forever probably. She used her scaling rule to do it. Laid it across the page and drew a long, straight, horizontal red line right through each field, left to right. Military precision. Done. Gone. Forever. Never again would they have Soup, gumbo chicken or Corn, whole kernel sweet, or Tuna, chunk light. Nope. Those were just distant memories now. Instead they had vital staples like Beans, kidney, red, (71 units) and Raisins, golden, seedless (114 units) and her personal favorite Sea Vegetables, kelp, wild Atlantic kombu (37 units). They had rice too, and oatmeal and cornmeal. There was no more coffee, but they had tea. There was no more dried pasta, but there was peanut butter. A little left. Two units. _Fuck._ She'd missed that one. Thought there was more. Virginia liked peanut butter. She was going to miss it. Jesus Christ she was going to miss it! The white light from the LED camping lantern was dimmed by a piece of brown paper she had wrapped around it as it shone down from the filing cabinet on her left, deepening and darkening the pockets where her eyes should have been, accentuating the worry lines and sallow cheeks. She hated the ledger. Hated the dark burgundy, faux leather textured cover, hated the gilt edge, elaborately tooled in gold, hated the smooth, thin, black ribbon connected to the spine which she used as a bookmark to keep her place. Shed tried to delegate this part. Shift this responsibility to someone else. Hell, shed even been successful. Lasted a year. Then Danny blew his fucking brains out and that was that. She was pretty sure it hadnt been the ledger thatd caused him to put the muzzle of his Sig Sauer in his mouth and squeeze off two shots into the soft tissue of his palate. There was some measure of certainty that it was mostly the bleak reality of their life under the mountain, at the end of the world, trying to make honey out of dogshit that had done that. Still. The ledger was terrible. It was all truth, and it was all bad. Two shots. Determined. She guessed that second squeeze had been all reflex and not grim resolution though. Hed painted the silver-white tiles of the bathroom stall in streaks of brightest red and ribbons of grey and shards of bone-white, and all she could think was she was going to have to get on that fucking ledger again. Fucking ration duty. _Tooth-to-tail, soldier. Tooth-to-tail._ Danny had been fond of saying he didnt have the recipe for turning dogshit into honey. Hed say that when hed report on their diminishing supplies. When she'd look at him wanting a different answer about how much of any one thing they had left. Shed always thought Danny was better at it than her. At rationing. At crunching the numbers. Mostly she just hated this part more than anything else. But here she was. All hers again. She flipped the page. _Vegetables._ God, those had been a saving grace. _Collards, potatoes, leeks, carrots, cabbage, peas, broccoli._ Beautiful. Fresh. Delicious. All of them. The herbs had all died. Shame that. That smell of fresh dill, and basil. Sweet, sweet basil. Theyd even planted cilantro and parsley, but none of it had survived. Shed looked forward to the enrichment of flavoring in their food the herbs would have provided. Theyd dried some. She didnt know how much was left. She didnt count that. Building the greenhouses out of old shower stall doors and rolls of plastic and salvaged lumber. That had been something. That had given them a new purpose, and a new hope. That had been good. They had some ideas on how to do it better too; things they could do different next year. In the spring. Next year. Year ten. She took a deep breath. Let it out, practically a whistle. There hadnt been enough vegetables though. There was never enough. There was never going to be enough. Less and less each of the three years theyd planted. Colder winters, drier summers. Shed crunched the numbers. It was all in front of her. Total survivors. Military. Civilian. Their ages, their health stats. Remaining food stores at current ration levels. They wouldnt make winter. Not all of them. No fucking way. Truth. She pulled the dark-rimmed glasses from the end of her nose and tossed them onto the desktop. A tiny knot of bulging veinery at her temple. Her eyes closed, elbow propped on the desktop. Forehead in palm, head hanging. Fuck you Danny."

        "writing_prompt": "In the crumbling remains of a once-infamous prison known as \"The Tombs,\" whispers of missing inmates, ghostly apparitions, and a mysterious man in white haunt the few who remain. What dark secrets lie buried within its ancient stones, and who\u2014or what\u2014is reaching out from the shadows?",
        "story": "#The Tombs# _125 White Street_ _Manhattan Detention Complex (MDC)_ The MDC is a municipal jail in an area known as the civic center of Lower Manhattan. Its granite walls are made from stones salvaged from Bridewell Prison after that center of incarceration ceased to be in 1838, one hundred and three years after its building. Bridewell was a British prison built to house American prisoners of war. It had barred windows open to the elements and was a dreadful place; a fact the guards at the MDC used to like to point out to prisoners who complained about the current conditions at the MDC. Even so, there was a lot worth complaining about. Firstly, it was designed to house some 900 inmates but by 1969 was housing over 2000. It sat above an old freshwater cistern, once a primary water source for the city, but long abandoned due to pollution from industrialization. In the years since its building the MDC had settled so extensively that large cracks had formed in foundations and walls. Some floors had heaved or collapsed and were abandoned in ruin, so high was the cost to repair them and so dangerous the work to do so. Many had complained about deep rumblings from beneath the building and foul-smelling odors rising from the fissures and rents. In 1974, less than a month after a riot at the Attica Correctional Facility in Attica New York caused the deaths of ten correctional officers and civilian employees as well as thirty-three inmates, most of The Manhattan Detention Center was abruptly closed. An exodus of some 350 inmates went to Rikers Island with the rest forced to stay in a gutted and hollow shell of the prisons former self. The reason for the closure was outwardly cited as structural concerns. It was however widely believed a known inability to quell an organized riot was the real reason they shut it down. One ward remained. In an old annex with 144 cells, more than a hundred of which now sat unoccupied, was a section dubbed the Special Inmate Containment Center (SICC). Forty-one inmates remained in this run-down but technologically advanced prison ward. Following some notable escapes from the prison a think tank of engineers, architects and other prison design specialists decided a specialized ward to house the _remarkably criminally capable_ was required. People with a penchant for escape, those with an affinity for lock-picking or slipping through narrow spaces or making them, as well as those able to manipulate corrections officers and civilian workers into assisting in their plans. These were the people now housed at what was left of the SICC. The SICC had state of the art locks and containment cells, requiring a pair of directly operated manual locks and remotely operated electronic tumblers be unlocked simultaneously in order to open a cell or ward door. The SICC employed staff who underwent rigorous psychological evaluations and were paid exceptionally well for the work they did. They enjoyed coveted positions within a legal system that had seen the citys police and correctional facility staff diminish over previous years. It was bragged that _they couldnt be bought_. There was only one way out of the prison now and that was up through the main guard tower between the two wings of the SICC. There were three sets of security doors to get through just to get into the guard tower. From there you had to go by an open stairwell or cargo lift with armed guards in riot gear on all sides up four stories to another containment area that had another two security doors to get through before opening up at the Bridge of Sighs. This enclosed concrete causeway crossed over White Street and connected to the now abandoned Criminal Courts Building. By 1977 there had been another long-standing name used for the place. One that hearkened back to the stones from which it was built. They called the MDC, and specifically the SICC portion of it _the Tombs_. From the outside the reason for this seemed to be the fact it had been built in the Egyptian Revival style with grand round or square columns and an overall squarish appearance with tall, narrow arched windows and obelisks. From the outside, the building looked like a utilitarian Egyptian tomb. But there was more to it than that. When its stones had stood elsewhere as Bridewell, the winter winds had taken the lives of hundreds of ill-fed American patriots who wasted away and expired, unable to find sanctuary from the cold and wind, their fight for independence concluding piteously in a British prison on what would eventually become sovereign American soil. It was long believed that the dead haunted the halls of The Tombs, and in the years since its closure since much of the facility had been left decrepit and falling apart and empty these whispered stories only grew more intense. The usual fare of haunted places. Strange sounds coming from abandoned corridors. The sighting of apparitions, objects misplaced and deemed to have been taken by supernatural entities. So widespread were these stories by inmates and facility staff alike that several medical and psychological investigations had been undertaken with varying results over the years. In some cases stress was blamed for the sightings. In others, they believed it was the idle complaints of otherwise bored inmates. Still other investigations concluded the sightings were a byproduct of _chronic exposure to methane, hydrogen sulphide, and formaldehyde within the aging prison complex_. But exposure to toxins from a polluted subterranean well didn't explain missing inmates. Bad press aside it was easier to rule these as escapes but in some cases these were model inmates with little time left before the end of their sentence. And what about the suicides? In the months leading up to the summer of 1977 there had been twelve of those. Three of which had been prison guards who had gone into abandoned parts of the prison and there either cut both their wrists and throat with a straight razor or shot themselves in the head or face. The inmates had used various methods as well and one of those who had survived said afterward that a man dressed in white came to his cell and told him to do it. That the end was coming and that he didn't want to be around for it. So persuasive had this man in white's story been that the inmate had wrapped the leg of his prison issue pants around his neck and tried to strangulate himself from his bed rail. Whether you believed it or not there was something to the rumors about The Tombs that you could not shake. Something dark and malign that seemed to hunker in those old shadows and darkened halls. Something that seemed to be reaching out and taking people."

        "writing_prompt": "Erin has ventured beyond the forbidden five-mile marker, breaking the commune's rules, but as she surveys an abandoned cabin with a broken window and open door, she hears the sound of hoofbeats behind her\u2014someone from the commune has followed her. Who is it, and what will they do now that they\u2019ve found her?",
        "story": "Huddled in a damp and filthy jacket the lone girl rode slowly in the pre-dawn half light. There was a crispness in the fall air, clean and clear and the cold making each breath a cloud of vapor. Her ratty hood was down despite the warmth it would have provided her against the morning chill and her auburn hair was tied back in a ponytail. The chestnut quarter horse moved at an easy pace under her, following the rutted game trail, careful to pick up its hooves and place them so as to avoid the jutting roots and deadfall beneath the carpet of gold and ochre, red and yellow leaves. Erin sat deep in the saddle but hunched a bit, bow over her shoulder, arrows bundled into a sort of crude quiver made from a leather tool pouch strapped to her leg. Her eyes scanned the shadows along the crest of a low hill where they seemed to gather near the base of the white barked trees. She let her gaze linger on the darkness, confirming its vacancy. Pools of still water riffled black among the brush in the low places. Thin black branches protruded from the water. The edge of the pools fringed with reeds. The tall golden grasses made a hypnotizing sound like a whisper against the horses legs as she ascended the slope and she found her eyes getting heavy. Near the top she let out a short, sharp ho, more grunt than word and shifted her weight in the saddle. Gently she pulled back on the reins though the horse was already stopping. Red dot painted on the trunk of a tree. Nail in the center. A simple, easy to miss marker. Facing opposite the way strangers would come. She sat in the saddle eyeing it. Sniffed. Looked round. All was silent and still. Point of no return, hey Chess. Erin said to the horse and it twitched its ears and knickered as if in response. She rubbed its neck, let her bare hand rest against it a moment. This was the five mile marker. Five miles from home. She wasnt supposed to go past this point. It was forbidden. She wasnt supposed to leave the commune without someone with her either. Was never supposed to go out before dawn or after dusk. None of them were. She patted the horse's neck again. Nudged forward. The horse seemed at first hesitant to resume its earlier pace and instead went on more leisurely. Come on. she urged softly. Another nudge. He picked up the pace. Down the shaded side into the cold, the grasses here damp and high enough to wet her boots. Then up a steep dirt track past the edge of a field of tumbled down and moss-covered rocks. Before the path cut into tree cover she looked out over her right shoulder and could see the lake some miles distant. They called it Silver Lake because the old name had been forgotten and because of the way the shallows shone in the morning light. The sun was on it now, reflecting brilliantly but so near the shoulder of the mountains she rode still in shadow, the sun having not risen high enough yet to reach her. She wanted to stop and take it in longer but she reminded herself she wasnt sight-seeing this time and went on. At the crest of the hill she did stop though. From higher ground it was important to be still and to survey. After a time she dismounted and hitched the horse to a tree. The horses name was Chester; a name given to it by the Bowman's. An animal they had come to own when the trapper John Brannan had decided it was not suited to hunting and passed it along to them. It had ever been wary of the smell of guns and blood and was prone to bolt at the sound of a rifle shot. Taking her bow and arrows she whispered a reassurance to Chester, gave him another rub along his neck and then a pat before she walked out along the ridgeline, eyeing the ground. She watched for animals down in the wooded valley beyond, careful how she stepped, noting the direction of the wind. The hills were criss-crossed with wide cuts between the older, more densely packed forest here. These areas were choked with weeds, low, scraggly brush and stands of thin-trunked saplings. The remains of old ski-runs someone had told her. North of here stood an old place filled with burned out buildings that had once been a great lodge; a place for winter vacations they'd said. No-one went there now. The people that had lived there were all gone now. Nell said they had come to a bad end. The people who had stayed on _after_. Isaac had taken the girls there once, a long time after but the girls had been terrified of the place. There was a sort of superstitious fear of the place even now. Seeing nothing among the trees she crouched and waited. Waited for something like five minutes. Then, at last. _Movement._ Seventy five yards away at the edge of a clearing was movement. Something grey breaking from the dark. She felt her pulse quicken the way it always did. She had the arrow nocked but drew the string now. Raised the bow. Turned her head slightly to exhale, into the breeze not letting the vapor of her breath obscure her vision. It was a bighorn sheep, a ram judging by its wide, curving horns. It had clotted clumps of matted grey and a long white beard, it's alien eyes alert as it nosed the air. Too far away. Too much cover. She would spoil the shot and the noise would scare it off. She tried to remember what Emilie had said about their horns. How much of a curve they were supposed to have to legally hunt them back before the Fall. None of that mattered now of course, but her mind went there. She had always been interested in the way things were even if she sometimes thought Emilie and the others stretched the truth or exaggerated how easy life was by comparison. Erin knew bighorns didnt travel alone and since there was no shot to take, lowered her bow. She watched. There were four more. Tawny and pale. More animals meant more eyes to spot her, more ears to hear her. More noses to sniff her out of the air. With a bow, the best she could hope for was to take one of them. She watched them moving as they followed another trail through the trees up the face of another hill on the far side of the valley. God did she want to take one. That would make all this worth it. A quick run back, going light as she could. Then untying Chester and urging him along the ridge as fast as she dared go in the opposite direction of the big horns. She swung up onto the saddle and took him down a brush-covered defile which hid loose rocks and was more treacherous than she had expected. Chester nearly stumbled once but that was the worst of it and stayed up. Then she urged him back into a trot, angling up the hill back in the direction the sheep were travelling. Slowing as she neared it but riding along the top, trying to guess how far on she should need to ride. How far the animals might have moved. She couldn't be sure if the hill had been enough of a sound break to avoid detection but she doubted she could have gotten around them successfully without being heard. Still. When she judged she had reached roughly the right spot she pulled back on the reins and dropped from the horse's back, this time not tying the animal. Crouching she hurried up the ridge, soft boots quiet in the loamy earth. Skirting around an outcrop of rock she found a cutback and though steep she ascended it efficiently and with little sound. She slowed her breathing as she reached the summit. The bow was held high, string drawn, arrow nocked. She raised up, tried to gain a vantage point to see down the slope to the valley floor. She let out a breath, stopped. Below her on a rocky outcrop. Overgrown with weeds and surrounded by shade trees was an old, abandoned cabin. She recognized it as one of the cabins used by the trapper, though it was empty this time of year. It had once been an outbuilding built to house ski lodge equipment of some kind, or at least that's what Emilie had told her anyway. There was something odd about it though. Something out of place. She could just see the front door and window beside it from here, but the door was open instead of locked and chained closed. Also, the window appeared to have had its glass broken out. And that wasn't all... --- *I want one of you (you should collectively decide who, not just first come first serve) to have your character be out here and catch up to Erin at this point in the story. * *She is out alone, past the five mile marker on a horse that isn't hers. She's breaking rules and is going to be reprimanded when she gets back.* *Most likely situation is when Erin reaches the crest of the hill she sees an approaching rider which is your character. Maybe you went out in search of her not knowing where she went after finding her and/or the horse she took missing. Maybe you saw her go and followed her. Do others know you left? Are you breaking any rules by going? You could be planning to bring her back and try to cover for her, or maybe as a disciplinary figure.* *Whoever it is that goes should establish some sort of deeper relationship with Erin in this scene.* *Please play against the Erin challenge in one post, and we will follow with the cabin after if you opt to do so. Note the cabin has not been recently explored by either Erin or your character and is a mystery to you both why the door is open and the window broken out. There is no reason for anyone to be at the shack, plus all are accounted for at the commune except Erin.* *I would like to establish this scene with a few posts before I open it up for everyone who isn't out looking for her. I will let you know when it's wide open for free-for-all posting again.*"
