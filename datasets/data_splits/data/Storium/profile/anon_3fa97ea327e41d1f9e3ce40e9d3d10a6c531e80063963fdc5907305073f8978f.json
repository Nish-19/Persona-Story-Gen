The very swamp where, if the legends speak true, an artefact of unimaginable evil was lost centuries ago, and has languished ever since.\n\n*Take up the sword and conquer.*\n\nThe Sword of Souls awaits its hour to corrupt another foolish victim - and through its agent bathe the whole continent in blood.\n\n*Listen to my song... and be lost.*\n\nIn Eastholt, over a hundred miles north of the Birchmere, a weapon master's daughter has gone missing.  All signs point to her having run away in search of a legendary weapon, wanting to become a mighty hero and save her country the pain of yet another war.\n\nCould it be the Sword of Souls that she seeks in her ignorance?  Either way, her father is determined to put a stop to her plans before she or anyone else can get hurt.  He recruits a search party to find his wayward Lydia and bring her back home...\n\n[Setting Notes can be found here: http://tinyurl.com/ko6y37t]",

Maybe you're just in dire need of some fast coin.  Whatever the reason, you're part of a small band of adventurers on the trail of the near-mythical ruby known as the Heart of Fire, one of the most famous treasures from the days of the Old Princes of Ishkarin.\n\nCertainly the most famous to have never been found.\n\nThe jewel alone, with its reputed size and powers--not to mention its historical value--could set you all up for life.  With the rest of the rumoured missing hoard... well, rich beyond your wildest dreams is such a subjective statement, isn't it?\n\nIt won't be easy, of course.  There has to be a reason *why* the Heart has remained unclaimed for so many years, when your group is hardly the first to seek it.  The Lost City, where the gem is thought to be, seems determined to live up to its name.\n\nBut then, as they say in the Temple of Naukar: *Everything now found was once lost.*",

At first only for the very rich, attended by every luxury... but as the days of Stephenson's Rocket and The Flying Scotsman gave way to Southern Rail, so too did space travel fall into the hands of the masses.\n\nWhat had been unthinkable was now just another mode of transport.  People griped about delays and wrote lifestyle articles about coping with \"warp boredom\".  \n\nIt only got worse as the New Age of Colonisation made long voyages more common.  Setting up a new life on another world, under a sun that no human had ever seen was daunting enough, but coping with a month or more in deep space?\n\nIt was no wonder that long-haul space-travel became seen as \"dangerous\".  Oh, not *physically* dangerous, or at least no more so than the aeroplanes of bygone centuries.  No, this was more of a social danger, as there were whispers of colonies imploding through interpersonal drama before anyone even touched the ground.\n\nProbably exaggerated, of course, but unsettling nonetheless...",
