What happens when the Master of the world meets the servant of a higher one?",
        "story": "**URBS ROMA. DAWN. THE IDES OF NOVEMBER, AB URBE CONDITA 816.** As it had every day for eight hundred and sixteen years, dawn came first to the tops of the seven hills comprising the City of Rome. On this second day of the *Ludi Plebeii,* there were no clouds in the east, so the first rays of the sun found their way unimpeded into the bedchamber window of an imposing marble house on the Palatine Hill, falling across the face of Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, who lay sleeping between the dormant figures to two women. Nero groaned as the light of day intruded on his sleep. Rising up on one elbow, he rubbed his forehead and temples. His head was throbbing from last night's wine. Opening one eye, he surveyed the two figures in bed with him. One was the wife of a Senator; the other a slave girl of no account. Nero grinned crookedly. Actually, *neither was of any account.* He, on the other hand, was Master of the world. ----------------------- Dawn came later to the Subura. Nestled between the southern end of the Viminal and the western end of the Esquiline hills, the insulae of this teeming slum remained in the pre-dawn gloom a bit longer. From the third story of one insula, an elderly Jew was already awake, regarding the brightening eastern sky with cheerful anticipation. *Another day to do the work He had commanded him to do.* Although now well on in years, Simon Peter Bar Jonah was an imposing figure of a man, with huge hands and a strongly muscled back, the legacy of many years of casting and hauling heavy nets from his fishing boat. Now, of course, he was a fisher of *men.* --------------------------- Nero soaked in his bath, his chubby fingers daintily taking a wine-soaked honey cake from a tray offered by a slave and popping the delicacy into his mouth. As he did so, his secretary consulted a wax tablet and advised the Emperor of his schedule for that day. After offering sacrifice at the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, he and the Pontifex Maximus would proceed to the Circus Maximus where he would preside over the races. It would be a grand procession from the Temple to the Circus, with Nero riding in a gilt chariot, with the Pontifex Maximus and Vestals preceding him in the procession. After the races, of course, the nightly parties would resume... Nero sighed with contentment, sinking deeper into the water. *His City. His people. His empire. His world.* ----------------------- After he concluded his morning prayers, Simon Peter consulted with one of his deacons regarding the time which the races were expected to conclude. He planned on proceeding to a strategic location where he could address the crowds, telling any who would listen of the marvelous events to which he had been a first-hand witness some thirty three years ago. As Bishop of Rome, this was his City. Peter rolled his eyes, imagining the look on his Master's face if he had blurted such a thing aloud while following after Him back in Judea. No, thought Peter smiling, Rome was *His* city. Commissioned by Jesus to \"feed His sheep,\" Peter was the head of the Apostles, charged with the heavy burden yet joyful task of spreading His word. Today would be a good day to do just *that*... ------------------- An hour later, two very different men stepped into the bright Roman sunlight to begin their day's work: one climbing into a purple and gold litter, the other simply exiting the door of the insula and blending immediately into the crowd..."

        "writing_prompt": "A Roman Empire that never fell has taken to the stars, but aboard the warship *Stella Nova*, Captain Tiberius Valerius Lupus must navigate a collapsing star gate, hostile forces, and untested technology to lead his crew into the unknown. What awaits them on the other side?",
        "story": "**PROLOGUE. ON BOARD THE IMPERIAL ROMAN WARSHIP *STELLA NOVA.* PROXIMA CENTAURI SYSTEM.** Tiberius Valerius Lupus stared at the tactical plot for a moment, watched the red diamonds advance. And to think hed been hoping for some good news Their tactical situation was poor and their options were severely limited. If he were to maximize their chances at passing through the *stella porta* he would minimize their ability to fight. No maneuverability, almost no weapons systems, the list of hindrances was short but brutal. EW, start jamming and set all countermeasures to automatic. Nav, make all preparations for stella porta transit. Helm, you are free to make our passage as soon as youre able. Best possible speed. The ship was as ready as shed ever be. Agrippina and Sextus had stabilized the *stella porta* so that it was as good as it was going to get. Little Brutus, ordered Lupus, Take control of launching the probe. Fire it when you determine the optimal employment window. Acknowledged, Captain, replied the computer. Helm, ordered Lupus, all ahead flank speed. Activating the 1MC, he said, All hands, this is the Captain. We are proceeding into the star gate. Brace yourselves; theres no knowing what things will be like on the other side. If this is like other transits, well all be a bit foggy in the head once we exit the gate at our destination. I need each and every one of you to bring yourselves round as quickly as you can, and be ready to respond instantly to orders. Stella Nova was now beginning to accelerate, albeit sluggishly, towards the star gate. Diverting the ships power to optimize the gates stability had left precious little in reserve to actually drive the ship forward. The squadron sent from the would-be Emperor Marcus Labienus Crassus had something of their own to say about Lupus' plan. They were under strict orders to stop *Stella Nova* at any cost, and were about to prove that they took their mission *quite* seriously. Captain, theyve launched a full salvo. Marcus Cornelius Victors terse words hung over their heads like the Sword of Damocles. Eight missiles inbound, tracking true. Time to impact: 41 seconds. Our aft mass drivers are failing to charge fully. Defensive fire doubtful. There we go, Little Brutus announced almost musically, its tone of voice the result of its human interaction algorithm attempting to inject a note of airy cheerfulness into a very tense situation. Probe away. In Sick Bay, Doctor Vespillo tightened the grip on the arms of her chair. Teeterius Farge, tilted his head upward, sniffing the air tentatively. At his action station, Augustus Corenthus Tellethus looked around at his men. \"Steady on, boys,\" the Primus Pilus said reassuringly. \"Nothing we haven't been through dozens of times. See you on the other side.\" *He hoped.* In the ship's Combat Information Center, Contubernalis Gaius Caelius listened as the CIC Watch Officer kept up a steady chatter of tactical updates with the Bridge. Caelius was amazed at the man's competence and calmness, hoping that someday soon he too could have something of that air about him. Then his mind returned to the fact that this time four weeks ago, he had been a clerk (a *clerk,* not a Contubernalis, for crying out loud!) on the staff of the man who now claimed the Imperial Purple for his own. A man whose fleet was, at this moment, trying to kill them all. In engineering, Agrippina Euphemia rechecked her calculations one last time, painfully aware that the fate of all her shipmates was about to be determined by the validity of her as yet untested hypotheses. Sextus Arius crossed himself, saying, *Procedamus in nomine domini. * Then, in an instant, the star gate collapsed in on itself and vanished in a brilliant flash of blue-white light, taking *Stella Nova* with it. A few seconds later, the flights of missiles, now bereft of any target, detonated harmlessly in the nothingness."

        "story": "**CAMPUS MARTIUS. TWO DAYS AFTER THE DISCOVERY. ** Sextus Agrippa Strabo gazed out the window of his office at the bleak, eternal Martian landscape. The late afternoon sun caused the sands of the Arcadia Plains to cast a reddish hue over his pale face and whitened hair. The news that a team of his explorers had discovered unambiguous evidence of an ancient alien civilization on Mars had set all of Earth afire with excitement, if not turmoil. *Not alien, * Strabo corrected himself. On Mars, the *Romans* were the alien civilization. These long-dead beings with their longish, harsh facesthe *Martians*--were the native species of this planet. As Propraetor of the Roman colony on Mars, Strabo had been hand-picked by the Emperor to lead this expedition to establish *Colonia Planetia Martius,* or Campus Martius (the Field of Mars) as it was commonly known. After his four year tour as head of the colony, he would return to Earth, where his election as Consul was virtually assured. And that was *before* the discovery. Nowwell, he would almost certainly be elected Consul a second, third, and fourth time. After that, *Princeps Senatus* and eventually Censor would not be out of reach. That was absolutely as high as a man not a member of the Imperial family could rise! He thought back on the rather amazing teleconference, which had just concluded an hour earlier. Both the Emperor and the Pope endured the long and tedious time lags inherent in any live conversations between Earth and Mars in order to speak directly with himself, Father Eusebius (the Papal Nuncio to the colony), andof coursethe co-discoverers of The Face: Ismene Julii Gaius and Secundus Varrus. The questions they had asked Circe (as Ismene preferred to be known) and Varrus had been insightfuland not a little probing. Once the explorers had been excused, the Emperor had expressed the concernsheld by himself and the Holy Fatherabout the social, political and religious implications of this discovery, along with their potential to spawn societal upheaval on the home world. Yet, at the end of it all, the Emperor had decided to make the discovery known to the entire world. Soon, the news transmissions from Earth would be full of the news. Despite Strabos misgivings, there was a news conference scheduled for the morning. He only hoped Circe and Strabo were up for the challenge. Despite the tremendous news, there were (of course!) the seemingly mundane (yet vitally critical) aspects of day-to-day colonial life. Some of the crops being grown in the agro-domes were not producing quite the yield that had been projected by the agronomists back on Earth. That was certainly a concern. Yet he was confident that the unlikely duo of Drusilla Al-Andalus (the colonys physician and veterinarian) and Demeter (a Vestal, for all love!) would already be hard at work, assisting the biologists and botanists to come up with a viable solution to the dilemma. Thenthere was the grim and unpleasant business regarding the Cupro woman. A saboteur planted among the colonists by New Beijing, Lucia Cupro had nearly succeeded in destroying Romes mission to Mars, and half a dozen colonists had died as a result. She had been found out, just in the nick of time, but the effects of her sabotage had nonetheless been devastating. She had been found guilty of capital crimes, and her execution was looming. Sextus Agrippa Strabo was nothing, if not a political animalyet he was not without compassion. Decimus Calpurnius Flavius, former captain of the *Aries* (which had been partially and intentionally disassembled upon landing in order to convert it into an integral part of the colony complex), was chafing to oversee Cupros execution, and Strabo was inclined to let him do soproviding the steady and reliable Optio, one Canus Murdoch, accompanied him. Strabo had given Murdoch discrete orders to ensure that the whole unfortunate but necessary affair was carried out with as much dignity and charity as the occasion would allow. Following the conclusion of the VTC with Rome, Father Eusebius had mentioned that he was going to visit the prisoner, offering to hear her confession and offer *extreme unction* if she was inclined to receive it. Despite her status as an enemy of Rome, Strabo hoped that she would At that point, Sextus Agrippa Strabo realized that he needed a drinkbadly. He resolved to visit *The Sign of Phobos,* the colonys lounge cum taverna. Valeria Minor Poplicola, a patrician woman of not inconsiderable standing, was amazingly insightful and knowledgeableas well as quite discreet. He could share some aspect of his burdens with her in complete confidence. For her part, Valeria could would alsoas she always didgive him some sense of the Colonys mindset in the wake of all these tumultuous developments."

        "story": "He didn't know that Rome had made him a bishop. And even if the congratulatory message from the Vatican hadn't been absorbed by the electromagnetic cloud enveloping Mars and blocking all communications from Earth, his elevation to the Bishopric would have been the last thing on is mind at the moment. The man struggling to survive a massive coronary attack needed his full attention. Father Eusebius moved around the various pieces of medical equipment as he sprinkled the bed of Sextus Agrippa Strabo with holy water, chanting the words of the *asperges me.* As he did so, Dr. Al-Andalus ordered her staff to withdraw to a respectful distance while the Papal Nuncio continued with the rite. Putting his ear close to Strabo's lips, he heard the man's confession. As Father Eusebius gave the stricken man absolution, the words of the prayer were obscured by the rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor. And yet, fragments of the ancient prayer still drifted into the ears of those waiting to speak with the first Roman Governor of Mars. *\"Dmine sancte, Pater omnipotens, aetrne Deus, te fidliter deprecmur, ut accipinti fratri nostro sacrosanctum Corpus Dmini nostri Jesu Christi Fillii tui...\" * The Vestal Virgin, a pagan and unlikely friend of Fr. Eusebius, clasped her hands in an attitude of respect for what was now--and had been for eighteen centuries--the dominant and official Religion of the Empire. Beside her stood a patrician woman whose family name was well known in the circles of Imperial power back on Earth. Next to her, a geologist repeated the Sign of the Cross over is own head, shoulders, and torso every time the priest made it over the still form of their hapless governor. \"...*tam crpori quam animae prost ad remdium sempitrnum: Qui tecum vivit et regnat...\" * Two men stood apart from the first group. Their chiseled features and precise postures identified them as *viri militaribus*: military men. The senior of the two, wearing the uniform of a *Navis Praefectus* in the Imperial Roman Navy, stared straight ahead, his countenance betraying nothing. The other, an *Optio* in the Roman Army, watched the rites intently. Two visible scars on his face hinted at the presence of several others hidden under his uniform tunic. Occasionally his eyes left the scene playing out around the sickbed to regard the superior officer standing slightly ahead of him and to his left. Although his eyes rested only momentarily on the Captain, in that brief moment they were able to betray their owner's contempt for the man likely to take command of the Colony while Strabo recovered. *If* he recovered. Father Eusebius continued with the ritual, anointing Strabo with the *Oleum Infirmorum .* During the minutes which followed, each of the prominent members of *Campus Martius* (\"The Field of Mars\" as the colony informally referred to itself) had time to ponder the chain of unlikely events which had brought them all to this moment in time and space. For some, the events of the last year had blurred together. For others, each turning point stood out sharply: the media frenzy accompanying their departure from the Syene launch complex in Aegyptus, the tedium of the long interplanetary flight, the nearly disastrous computer glitches (induced, as it turned out by a saboteur among their number), the capture of the Chinese agent who had been surgically modified to assume the false identity of one \"Lucia Cupro.\" When the squadron of three colony ships finally entered Martian orbit, things had gone from bad to worse: the crash landing of the colony ship *Anchises* with its attendant loss of life, building materials and precious supplies. The desperate struggle to survive on limited rations and damaged equipment. Then there was the excitement accompanying the discovery of water in the ice caves under the Arcadian Plain. That water had meant that the colony's long term viability was assured...or so they had thought. Shortly after the discovery of frozen water, other things had been discovered in the cave as well. Sinister things. Sculptures and artifacts of impossible antiquity offered stark and disturbing proof that Mars had been the home of an advanced civilization over eighty million years before man had emerged upon the Earth. And the Cube...that mysterious green block of ice from which emanated energy of a type never before encountered. It was at about that time that the enemy agent Cupro had been executed and buried in the frozen patch of Martian tundra which served as the colony's graveyard. *But she had not remained dead.* Some unknown force--the Cube, most Romans thought--had served to reanimate her. Even now, the corpse of Lucia Cupro, possessed by the spirit of a long-dead Martian, roamed somewhere outside the pressurized hull of *Campus Martius.* And she...*it*...was not alone. Five other Roman graves lay empty, their former occupants now respawned Martians as well... *\"Benedicat te omnipotens Deus, Pater, et Flius, et Spritus Sanctus. Amen.\" * Fr. Eusebius' final blessing yanked them all back to the present. Kissing his purple stole as he removed it from his shoulders, he walked towards the group. In answer to their unspoken question, he simply shook his head. Whether his reply meant, \"he won't last long\" or \"I simply don't know,\" none of them could tell. \"The Propraetor will see you all,\" Eusebius said. \"First however, Captain Flavius, he wishes to see you. In private.\" Once the others had withdrawn, Decimus Calpurnius Flavius approached Strabo's bed. Assuming that the governor's weakened condition left him unable to speak loudly or clearly, he bent close over the prone form. He was surprised by the speed with which Strabo's hand shot upwards, clutching the material of Flavius' tunic with unexpected strength. \"Flavius, you son of a bitch!\" he growled. \"Leadership of this Colony falls to you while I am thus indisposed, and God help us all for it! By the Mass, if you allow your hubris to run amok and jeopardize all we've worked for, so help me, I'll...\" The machine behind Strabo had been beeping with increasing urgency, and the accompanying oscilloscope trace looked more like a sampling from a seismograph than a heart monitor. The remainder of Strabo's words were lost in a spasm of coughing."
