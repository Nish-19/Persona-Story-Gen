            "story_name": "It has been thirty four years since Pontius Pilate, the Roman Procurator of Judea, ordered the execution of a Nazarene Jew named Jesus in order to quell a riot.  In those three short decades the followers of this man, called also the Christus, have spread throughout the empire, and many of them dwell in Rome herself.  Although the Empire is tolerant of foreign religions, these so-called *Christians* are different.  The political leaders surrounding the Emperor are becoming increasingly concerned.\n\nTwo giants stand out from among the Christians in Rome.  One of them, a Galilean Jew named Peter, is the Bishop in charge of Christians in Rome and Italia.  The other, a Roman citizen of Jewish origin named Paul, is a prolific writer and teacher who has been busy defining the doctrines of this new sect.  \n\nThe teachings of Christus (the *Christ,* or Jewish Messiah) appeal mostly to the downtrodden:  slaves, the poor, foreigners...but more than a few Romans have become followers as well.  It is even rumored that some Patricians and at least one Senator are secret followers of Christus.  \n\nThe Emperor Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus has ruled over the Empire for ten years, ascending to the Purple after the mysterious death (murder, most say) of Claudius.  The past five years of his reign have become marked by increasingly erratic and paranoid behavior on his part.  Like Tiberius before him, he sees enemies everywhere and in every circumstance.  Like Caligula before him, he is rumored to be mad.\n\nIn *AD 64,* players will assume the role of a Christian living in Rome, or of a pagan who has come in contact with this strange new religion, and knows not quite what to make of it.  Players will interact with major historical figures such as Peter, Paul, Linus, and Nero, and with each other as they seek to make their way through these exciting but uncertain times.  \n\nTo both pagan and Christian alike, it feels as if dark clouds are gathering over the Eternal City.  Change is coming...perhaps *terrible* change...",

            "story_name": "Once again, Rome is beset by civil war.  But this time, the fighting will take place among the stars. \n \nSetting: The story is an alternate history/science fiction drama which takes place in the 22nd Century AD. It is the sequel to \n[Romans In Space!](https://storium.com/game/romans-in-space/chapter-8/scene-3)\n\nRome never fell.\n \nBy the end of the Twentieth Century AD, although not *complete* master of the world, her dominions were vast, and her military, economic and technological superiority went unquestioned. Rome\u2019s earthly hegemony secure,  the Empire began turning their vision skyward\u2026\n \nIt is now AD 2129, and Roman scientists have unlocked the secrets of interstellar travel. With the invention of *Quam Celerius Lucem* (QCL) Drives, Roman vessels have established Colonia Proxima Centauri, a habitable world populated by primitive barbarians who were easily overcome.   Rome\u2019s first encounter with an advanced civilization (the Pomeranii) did not go well.  After a brief and violent war, Rome has just concluded an armistice with the canine-like aliens.  An initial exchange of technology and diplomats is about to take place, and it is likely that Rome and the Pomeranii will soon become allies, joining forces against a far more serious threat:  the Formix. \n \nJust as the crew of the Imperial Roman Warship Stella Nova was about to depart on a diplomatic mission to the Pomeranii home system, the old Emperor died.  Almost immediately, legions on Proxima Centauri hailed their governor, Marcus Labienus Crassus, as Emperor.  This illegal act immediately triggered a civil war, the first the Empire has suffered in two centuries.  As one of the few ships in the sector still loyal to the true Emperor, Stella Nova was forced to flee.\n \nJoin the crew of Stella Nova as they ferry the royal heir of the Pomeranii to his homeworld, then attempt to fight their way back to friendly territory in a desperate attempt to keep the traitor Crassus from marching on Rome!\n\n**IMPORTANT:** This is a fairly complex game.
