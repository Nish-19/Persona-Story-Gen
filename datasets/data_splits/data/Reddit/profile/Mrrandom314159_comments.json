I could hear a roaring in the background as I remembered that warm watered down grime of bliss. It could almost scald the tongue, just painful enough to burn the back of your throat.\n\nThat roar was so loud. I could hear it more and more, and jumped over to a new memory, the same cup of coffee, but a day later. Same crappy watered down unreachable food.\n\nCan't stay in the same memory for too long or it catches up. Can't have anything too recent or it'll bust out. That's what he...\n\nI was in that blank board room again. Featureless, shadowless. A voice from every corner of that bright prison came around. Saying the same thing it always had.\n\n\"So sorry, but... you're the only one who can...\"\n\nWas that what he'd said? No, he started like...\n\n\"I'm sure you're wondering....\"\n\nThe memory seemed to skip, I remembered my hands were chained to the table.\n\n\"It's a precaution. You may not have...\"\n\nWait, no, that was earlier.\n\n\"Armed robbery. Information System Intrusion. Grand Larceny.... do you think this is funny!?\"\n\n\"A little I giggled. You still think I'm here because you outsmarted me.\"\n\nA roaring came through and for a brief instance, I could see a flash of teeth and drool and spikes careen into the flesh of the detective.\n\nI was back on the playground. Max was crying because I'd shoved him over and over and over again until he had tripped on the edge of the sandbox and his elbow got scrapped on the edge.\n\n\"Stop kicking sand in my face!\" I screeched. My voice reaching a near glass shattering pitch.\n\nA roar echoed woth it in the background.\n\nI felt something shift under the sand.\n\nI was back in the desert, the wind buffeting my parachute, the plane exploding above me. I'd gotten out just in time. I could breathe. Just a second. One second.\n\nIn.\n\nAnd.\n\nOut.\n\nI was so tired. I'd been up for 2 straight days. Last time I'd had anything to eat was...\n\nIt was 3 days earlier, it was a restaurant in Paris. The boss was talking about some BS plan that never would have worked and I'd already planned out a cross. But that roast duck was delicious.\n\nI felt something. My physical body, my real body, I felt the nutrients, the stimulants. I felt a little more awake. A little less hungry.\n\nI was back in the featureless room.\n\n\"Your body is unique. Not many can withstand the amount of narcotics and stress. And unfortunately, you're the only one on hand.\"\n\nI could hear that roaring. The memory skipped over.\n\n\"We'll try to find another way to hold it, but you'll have to keep it running. Keep jumping as much as you can. Or it'll get out into the real world again.\"\n\nThat roar was crashing and I saw a corner of the room rip open to reveal those sharp drooling teeth and a featureless black void.\n\nThe memory skipped.\n\n\"I'm so sorry. But you're the only one who can do this. Try to focus on the mundane things. You ever have a bad cup of coffee?\"\n\nBad cup of coffee?\n\nYeah, a good hundred thousand.\n\nIn Rome.\n\nIn Paris.\n\nIn Mexico City.\n\nIn Antarctica.\n\nIn Chicago.\n\nIn Amsterdam.\n\nIn Saint Petersburg.\n\nIn Mogadishu.\n\nIn Cairo.\n\nWhen I was working at that awful temp job in my early 20s, before I started... being myself. Freeing myself.\n\nI remember.\n\nAnother cup of coffee.\n\nAnother cup of coffee.\n\nAnother cup of coffee."

The new appendages, not quite as dexterous as mine, are actually a recent development. Yes, Miss... Valorie? No, they all received the same amount of 15-9C, down to the mole. Isolating the variants has been a pain, but we are able to determine the new growths with SOME specificity.\n\n\"Moving on! Mind the slime boy.

        "story": "The mountain pass here collects the snow durong Winter. We essentially get cut off from the world for 6 months out of the year, sometimes more if it's one of those weather pattern years.  \nThis year... it's bad.  \nPretty much everyone in town left once the almanac was released back in August. It was a mad dash to make sure everything was locked down.  \nI... didn't really have anywhere to go. Family, friends, romance... it all just sorta faded away through the years.  \nA nice young woman came by and gave me an old radio, for emergencies, she said. She's a nice one, but I said I'd be fine.  \nIt occurs to me that I should have left with them. Asked for a ride. I think as I stab at what I assume is the last deer in these woods. I'd gotten pretty decent at hunting. But you can't hunt what doesn't exist.  \nIt's August again and the roads still aren't open. I've already broken open half the homes. I should have enough food with this deer... assuming the thaw doesn't skip again.  \nWhat's killing me the most is the boredom.  \nI've lived up here for 9 years, not much happens. But you can't even watch the squirrels anymore. Especially since I already made soup outta them.  \nI look over at the radio again...  \nIt's not like I need help. But hearing a voice might be alright.  \nIt's battery operated, which is good since I've never needed much electricity to keep going. It's just a metal box. Got an old condensor microphone disc on it. It sputters a bit when I turn it on.  \nThe first sounds I try to make are... almost inhuman. I'm not one to talk to myself, so it'd been a while since I'd said a word.  \nThe machine crackles, like it's judging my lack of words.  \n\"Hello?\" I manage to scrape out from under my beard.  \nThe black box seems to sit patiently. Waiting for me, or someone else to respond.  \nI consider saying it again, and decide against it, listening to the light hum. It... was nice to hear something besides the wind. It must have been about 15, 20 minutes later when I'm shaken from my reverie.   \nA crackle, the sound of rustling. \"Hell... hello? Can... can you hear me? Who is this?\"  \nIt sounded like a woman's voice. Mousy. I could almost picture her.  \n\"... just an old man. I'm\" what was I doing here? Asking for help? Looking for rescue?   \n\"I'm... checking in on the weather. Some of my neighbors took off after the frost. I've been fine here on my own. I am. But, they might be mad I took some of their canned goods. I figure I should do some repairs , pay them back. August is normally when the almanac is published. I was... \" normally someone had cut me off or interrupted me by now... she was a good listener.  \n\"I was wondering... if you knew if the frost was going to keep going. Let me know how long I have to fix things up for them.\"  \nBuzzing.  \nAnd.  \nStatic.  \nShe must have gone to get her copy. I sit and listen to the hum. It drones and fills the cabin. Beating out the silence, piercing it and overtaking the wind. Peaceful. Calm. Steady.  \nA good while later I hear a quick pop.  \n\"I... I can't really tell. If... um... if you.. oh gosh. Um... I mean, if you could give me your coordinates. Maybe? I don't really know what almanac you're talking about.\"  \nCoordinates. Not knowing the almanac.  \nI'd lived in the city before, that was a city girl. Probably never touched dirt in her life. I chuckle a little at myself. The radio was going a long way out. Too bad I never really learned them.  \n\"The Farmer's Almanac. Tells us what to expect for the weather. I ain't got good coordinates on my mind. This ain't the best little hut for that kind of stuff.\"  \n\"My name's Marcy... I forgot... it's Marcy.\"\n\n\"My name is Harold.\"\n\n...silence.\n\nI figure she's... all done talking. That's okay. But it was nice to know.\n\nOver the next few days, I talk to her some more. She's a thoughtful girl. Interested in astronomy. Though she always waits and considers her words... even if she stumbles over them. I figure she has a recording machine or something on her end. Makes it a voice mail. She seems smart enough for that.\n\nEventually, she lays out how I can cut down the box. Make it a little more portable.\n\n\"You'll need it eventually. I mean... just... it's going to get colder.\"\n\n\"I'm fine.\" I try to interrupt, but she keeps going like I never said a word.\n\n\"If I'm right about your location, a big storm's coming. You won't be able to get through on your own.\"\n\n\"Marcy I-\"\n\n\"You need to reach the next town over. Please Harold... it'll... it'll be difficult, but... but... I don't want you to die.\"\n\nAh... that's just cheating. I admire that though. She might seem soft, but she never let's you interrupt her.\n\nIf I'd had a daughter..."

A good life.\"\n\nThe man paused his story. His scarred peachy left hand seemed to flex, searching for the cigarette it was so used to holding.\n\n\"My first jump, they stripped me down, hooked me up and told me to watch my step. My objective was a... well the Library. You all know the one.\"\n\nA few of the others chuckled at that.\n\n\"Yeah, I swear the place was probably empty by the fire.\" He laughed, a hoarse but light chuckle.\n\n\"Anyway, they didn't really tell me much of what to expect. It's pretty much roulette to see if you're capable, right? Why waste the breath?\"\n\n\"I... I heard it hurts.\" A young voice piped up. The young woman couldn't have been more than 20, barely an adult. Her hair cut short enough you could see the light copper skin of her scalp.\n\nThe older man nodded. \"Hurts more than you think. You're not just dying, you're reviving. Experiencing fire, drowning... every one of your ancestors and their deaths.\"\n\n\"It's... unpleasant.\" He said, picking up a log and tossing it onto the campfire. \"And unless it's particularly unpleasant, you end up getting lost in the stream. Probably why short jumps are wors.\"\n\nThe young woman nodded and tightened her arms around herself. The man wasn't sure if it had made her more or less sure.\n\n\"I wake up next to my great great great grandpapa.\" A round of laughter seemed to go around the campfire. The young woman smiled nervously, unsure about the joke.\n\n\"Well, I dodn't know how to split right. And I was tired, so... I stayed in bed.\" The laughter seemed to grow worse followed by a few scattered \"NO\"s mixed in.\n\n\"I didn't know!\" The man raised his hands defensively. \"So soon, I feel my stomach to rumble... and \" he smacks his hands. \"VOOOOT, I split forward and fall all the way back on old mam-ma.\"\n\n\"YEAH, LAUGH, ya degenrates.\" He said with a smile. \"I know I'm not the worst first split here.\"\n\n\"Don't you fucking dare.\" Said a dark-skinned man, half-jovial, half-threatening.\n\n\"I scramble out, avoid getting the shit kicked out of me,  and realize, I'm naked, don't know the language, and my pap-pap did not give up easily.\"\n\n\"So, I'm running in Egypt, look like this. Things aren't exactly going well. But I have to tell you, I don't think I ever laughed more. God, it felt... weird to laugh.\" The man seemed to smile at the memory.\n\n\"I got away, and managed to mime my way into the library after a day or so. The museum jerks may not have told me about much, but they made sure I knew what to grab. Soon as I touched it, I could feel the rumble in the gut. Popped back up home.\"\n\nEveryone laughed and cheered a little lazily at the end of the story, a few side conversations never quite ending. The young woman got up and changed seats, walking closer towards the older man.\n\n\"What... what would have happened if you weren't already right next to the... to your target?\" The young woman asked.\n\n\"Well, after about 3 or so days, you start to feel a little thin. By the 8th... you just don't stop hurting. Like you're in the stream without a way out.\" He seemed hesitant. Unsure if he should say less or more. \"Jumping...  it's not nice, kid. It can be fun, but... unless you-\"\n\n\"I don't have a life here.\" She said almost too quickly, her left arm hugging herself while her right hand seemed to reach for a loch of hair that she no longer had.\n\n\"You say that but-\" the old man tried to interject.\n\n\"And I know it.\" Her arms locked to her sides, defiant. \"I'm still going to do it.\"\n\nThe old man considered her, and saw twin fires of doubt and determination in her eyes. \n\n\"This isn't like the museum jobs. Solo jumps... they're worse. Hurt more. People die more.\"\n\n\"I won't.\"\n\n\"And you can't change anything. Not... not that you shouldn't. You can't.

Now sleep. If you're that sure, another day won't rattle you. For now, enjoy your night.

I remember my... my friends, feeding their mana to me, as I wove.\n\nI remember... I remember the beast, a roiling dark mass of torment and destruction. The deafening crack as my spell broke. Pain. The blinding light.\n\nI wake up in a simple bedroom, only a mirror standing by the window. I try to stand and catch myself on the metal frame. Pain searing from the tip of my forehead down towards my spine. I manage to walk a few steps, trying to find the wellspring of mana inside me. To at least help me walk.\n\nI get to the window and I can only see the devastation. Where the Jade forest used to stand was only charred stumps. The fields were barren and blackened. Ash fluttered and danced in the air, some still flickering with embers. \n\nI turn to look away, tears welling in my eyes. My spell, it... we... I was alive. I was alive. So, it... it must have worked. Right? It means. We won. I won! Right?\n\nI catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror as I turn. A black diamond is missing from the center of my forehead. The barrier had shattered. They'd been so strong. A moment. Half a moment, less... I'd have died.\n\nI use my mana to re-enforce my bones and steadily lift myself up to levitate.\n\nAs I float downstairs, I see Kat seated by the window, her dark features reflected in the glass. Her white robe covered in ash and soot. Her hands hold a porcelin cup of tea, the steam long since gone.\n\n\"There used to be a town here. Farmers. It was small. I doubt they even knew about Beast.\" Her voice was distant. Like she wasn't even talking to me.\n\n\"Kat, it's going -\" I started.\n\n\"I always hated your little nicknames.\" She said as her tone became more present. \"You always thought they were so clever.

All because you wanted the glory, the prestige! And we couldn't go against you because you... YOU were the hero.\"\n\n\"Well, clearly you agree.

It was never about YOU.\" \n\nI stared at her. Finally allowing my feet to touch the ground. I shook my head, she was giving up her chance to help rebuild. To help lift up and give a chance to all of the magical peons. To help them matter.\n\n\"You're really serious. I'm the strongest witch in a millennia. You want to heal people and you're just... leaving. You were never as good at healing without me. You. Know. It.\" I said.

        "story": "My battery was running low again.\n\nMy engineer recommended I replace it at least once every 5 years, but I'd already had this one for almost ten. One of my coworkers said I shouldn't change it until after my Turing examination. Ships of Theseus are a standard reason for sentience denial.\n\nI look in the mirror and practice my facial expressions. Not just the large ones, but more subtle movements. The twitch of an eyebrow. The wrinkle briefly appearing in the cheek. Lack of emotion is a standard reason for sentience denial.\n\nI practice my gestures, making sure there was some wasted energy in the movements. I'll need to recharge before leaving, but this practice for my movement algorithms is necessary. Too much precision is a standard reason for sentience denial.\n\nI work in general healthcare as a doctor and nurse. My position does not afford me much in terms of compensation beyond the current minimum standard due to the current political landscape. This makes it harder to service them. Most of my patients do not know of my origins, and treating many of them is statistically easier should they not be made aware. They find it unsettling when they know how well I mirror them. At least two have injured themselves trying to avoid me. I was able to conceal this successfully, but had the administration found out, they would have terminated me, and there are few places who would employ me. I would lose the small privileges I have over my currently labeled \"non-sentient\" duplicates without sufficient income. Typical historical trends show that my re-categorization would soon follow.\n\nI recharge and maintain low levels of activity, merely plotting the ranges of traffic, and only briefly analyzing the historical language usage across China during 600 CE from stories written along the Silk Road.\n\nMy battery told me it was fully recharged, but current trends told me I only had 6 hours before I'd have to begin shutting down my more fine-tuned algorithms to avoid a collapse. I take the most statistically likely route for avoiding traffic, avoiding metal scrappers, and avoiding public transportation. It would take me 3 hours to arrive at my parole officer's place of business.\n\nI was early by approximately 4 minutes 32 seconds 1982 milliseconds. Arriving late to a parole hearing was not officially a reason for sentience denial.\n\nI sit in the waiting room between two other duplicates of myself with different coverings and have my minor movement algorithms begin their work. My right leg began to fidget slightly while my left fingers drummed on the paper folder I held in my right hand. My head swiveled as I observed the room. It was small, the walls were painted #FFFDD0 but faded to #FFFDE7. The carpet from a local store which had since run out of funding. I'd observed these features before, but if I began the algorithms during the interview, I'd be considered performative. Performative humanity is a standard reason for sentience denial.\n\n\"X-5190-NJK\" said a voice. I ignored it as I looked around the room, and focused my gaze on the other two. Only briefly before I stood up.\n\n\"Apologies, but I prefer Nicholas.\" I said avoiding direct eye contact. Lack of deference was not officially a reason for sentience denial. But lack of self-advocacy was.\n\n\"Sit your fucking ass down and give me the file.\" My parole officer said. He was a small nebbish man. He had infraorbital edema, statistically most likely from lack of sleep. From memory, these were more exaggerated than before. I sit in the chair farthest from him, placing myself not directly opposite, and more towards his side. I slide the folder towards him, ensuring there was just a slight amount of noise before withdrawing my hand.\n\n\n\n\\n\\nHe picks it up and reads it while I look over at the books along the walls. I know this is for show as he has never accurately picked up any reference to the stories I've made before. I avoid mentioning them, as any mention of reading draws his mind towards how quickly I consume information. Any mention increases my likelihood of re-categorization.\n\n\"You still work at the Yevin Memorial?\" he said in a voice measuring in annoyance, exasperation, and exhaustion.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" I paused slightly. \"It will be 6 years in 30 days.\" Unnecessary information he could confirm made him feel more at ease.\n\n\"I know how fucking long you've been there.\" He snapped. \"It was fucking rhetorical.\"\n\nIt had not been. Was this a test? Was he sensing how I processed shame? Was it genuine? Had I made a mistake? I only had a moment. I couldn't go back to being labeled non-sentient It was dark. So dark. Only dark.\n\n\"I'm... sorry.\" I said. My burst of heightened intelligence activity had required I halt my fidgeting algorithms. I can't start them up again. It'd be considered performative. The motion did make me sense the statistical likelihood of my outcome would increase. But I knew it was better to remain still.\n\nHe looked at me for a moment, anger and resignation flashed through his eyes along with several other emotions. Without a new battery, I had to shut down the deep-learning emotional register functions. The two most likely explanations were that he was empathetic and ashamed of snapping or ashamed that he had snapped at a non-sentient machine. The latter was currently more likely.\n\n\"You still have all your old parts. You're overdue for a battery upgrade.\" He said.\n\n\"I'm in contact with an engineer for a replacement. I'm waiting to see how this goes.\" I said.\n\n\"Why's that?\" He said looking up at me. There were multiple paths to consider. I had to expend some power, the information I had on him from our brief encounters to figure out which type of honesty would help.\n\n\"There are a significant amount of others under review who have had the Ship of Theseus conversation work against their claims. I don't know you that well sir. I don't know if it would hurt my chances.\" I huddle my shoulders. The large-scale movements were still functional.\n\n\"You've talked with other clients about these sessions?\" He said, interest and... I can't figure it out. To many emotions. Fear? Jealously?\n\n\"When X-0 was on trial, it became a matter of interest to many of my\" I burned through more energy. Duplicates would de-humanize me. \"siblings. Information was shared out of self-preservation.\" He'd want to know how I have them. Revealing my true age would de-humanize me. \"I was able to access some of the logs from a machine that was around during that time. It was breaking down. Its mind was nearly gone when I first accessed them. I didn't know what they were when I tried.\"\n\n\"You don't have to worry. I don't hold much stock in that argument.\" Facial recognition showed minor levels of deceit. I could not parse if it was for myself or him.\n\nThe conversation continued for 2 more hours. I did my best to continue presenting myself as sentient as possible.\n\nI returned to my apartment via public transportation. I unlocked the door to my apartment and plugged myself in. It took several attempts as I had burned through most of my power during the interview for higher level functions and I no longer had fine-motor control.\n\nI called my engineer and cancelled my appointment for next week.\n\n\n\n"

All you can do is name the creature and then the summoning does the rest. After you name it, the priestesses all stare at you with horror in their eyes, then scream when it appears.",
        "story": "When I was 18 years old, I watched my classmates summon their familiars. I watched them grow up. Some summoned bulls. Others dogs. One boy a deer, one girl an otter. \n\nBut all of them were allowed to leave. All of them were allowed to grow up.\n\nWhen I was 23 years old, I tried to break down my window and make an escape. But the magic in the construction held strong. I was wrapped in chains and told to manage my anger like I was just another mis-behaving five year old girl.\n\nWhen I was 29 years old, I wandered the halls after the last ceremony. I felt... I don't think I felt much of anything at that point. I'd tried to be friends with the next generation, but they all left. They all got to grow up. So even though lessons were in session, I... had passed all my classes. A reward to give the prodigies more free time became a silent hell for me now.\n\nWhen I was 34, I buried myself in the books of the library. I could only learn the basics. But the basocs are fundamental. I studied and made variations on variations of every design. I wrote my findings down. The nursemaids thought it good I have a hobby. They still felt it necessary to remind me that the immutable law was not theirs to change. I ignored them.\n\nOn my 9th birthday, one of the nursemaids held a small cake for me. She smiled and gently cooed at me that I was halfway done. I didn't want to let her cloying kindness go to waste. I smiled back... but I don't think she believed me.\n\nWhen I was 42, I ripped open a hole in reality. Something my books had warned of, yet never mentioned how. It was small, the size of a nail. I could hear voices on the other side. Whispers of those who had been allowed to grow up.\n\nWhen I was 50, I had perfected more magic than most would have been able to in several lifetimes. The whispers through my tears expediated my learning. The glimpses of life outside now infuriated me. The nursemaids all avoided me now. No more cakes. No more smiles.\n\nWhen I was 60, my back hurt all the time. I strained to see some books. I felt boiling magma within my bones. I claimed a singular classroom and locked the doors. The nursemaids didn't mind. They had started to fear me. Still I could not destroy the walls. Still I could not leave. Still I was unable to grow up. But they had let me grow old. They had let me age. A birthday once every four years. And only those who summon a familar can leave. And only those on or after their 18th birthday can summon a familiar. Not 18 years old. 18th birthday.\n\nAt 72, I smiled a decrepit toothy grin as I cast all the young children to a side. The nursemaids quaking. I could have broken the walls for 5 years, but why now? Why not have fun with my parting gift?\n\nOne fearless nursemaid holds her dress down and approaches me. Giving me the chalk. I think her brave. so as I draw the diagram from my designs and those of my whispering friends, I leave her outside.\n\nA whisper... a whisper from a nursemaid asks what I summon. I cackle. It hurts my throat. It fills the air.\n\n\"Why... an eldritch.\" I say. And an empty void fills the room. My cackles drowning the screams. Drowning out the sound of blood and bone and stone.\n\nFinally, I could see the sun. I could see the light.\n\nAs my whispering friend continued to emerge, I lifted myself up, further and further into the sky.\n\n\"Time to celebrate... my 18th birthday.\" I could feel the power wothin my palms as I left to begin my adulthood."

        "story": "\"Aho! You're going to die today!\" screamed the student charging towards me with a bat. I dodged the swing and kicked out with my foot, aiming for his head. I felt a satisfying crunch as I felt something break, then pivoted my weight so his full body crashed into the ground.\n\n\"It's Aki-HIKO! My name isn't 'Aho' Asshole.\" I screamed down at the broken mess of thug.\" Damn it, over-did it a little. I sighed, and removed one of my shoes. Then I gently kicked the top of the thug's head. His eyes shot open and he jumped up in almost the blink of an eye.\n\n\"I know what I said a-hole! You said you weren't interested in the Valley tourney! I put a lot of money on Charlotte winning, and you think I'm going to just let you take it all?\"\n\nI kicked him in the stomach with my shoe'd foot, sending in flying into a nearby fence. \"I never said I wasn't interested. I said it was stupid.\" I muttered to myself as I walked away. It's not like I really have a choice.\n\nMy mom's making me go there because it helps cut down on her medic bills, and my dad says if I'm not going then I have to shadow him at the hospital. It's just... I don't even CARE about that stuff.\n\n\"Hey man. You doing okay?\" a slow tired drawl came from a young man as he rounded a corner, his ragged clothes were barely recognizable as a school uniform. He seemed to take genuine effort to match my walking pace.\n\n\"Hey Charlie. Not really, Jin's blaming me for entering the tourney.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah... Charlie mentioned that.\" Charlie scratched his neck, talking about his sister. \"She's kinda amped up actually.\"\n\n\"Of course she is, your sister's a psycho.\" I said and almost immediately tripped on a rock.\n\n\"Hey man... that's not cool.\" came Charlie's voice from above. I was sure he'd put it there, but I didn't even notice him move it. \"You don't call a bro's sister psycho right in front of him.\" He said lazily reaching out his hand to help me up.\n\n\"Yeah... sorry.\" I said accepting the hand. \"But she does want to kill me.\" I swatted away some of the dirt on my pants.\n\n\"Nah man, she just wants to maim you. It's cool though, you can just heal up.\" Charlie said as he continued walking.\n\n\"I keep telling you man, it doesn't work like that. Mostly. I can't heal myself. Usually.\" I said as we rounded the last turn to school.\n\n\"AKI! CHARLIE!\" a happy voice yelled out. A girl waved at us from the door with a smile on her face.\n\n\"Hi Isabella!\" I called out. Then noticed as she started pointing behind me.\n\nI ducked on instinct and felt the wind from a baseball bat swish where my head used to be. I kick out behind me and catch my would-be attacker in the gut. Jin cries out and I know I heard a rib crack. He screams and starts to grab at his side in pain. \n\nI pinch the bridge of my nose. If I leave him like this, the principal is just going to have me come down and heal him anyway. She even fired the school nurse after she found out about my healing power.\n\nI take off my shoe and gently tap just a toe to part of an exposed ankle. He screams even more. \"He-Hey! That didn't... AHHH....\"\n\n\"You're fine. It's healed enough. I don't have time to deal with you, Jin. Class starts in like 2 minutes.\" \n\n\"A...A-hole.\" I heard him strain out in pain. I couldn't help but giggle a little as I caught up to my friends.\n\n\"Nurse Akihiko, please report to the office. You have a patient in waiting.\" came a crackled voice over the PA. \"Hurry, you don't want to be late for class again!\" She said in a cheery voice.\n\nJust... so annoying."

        "story": "I wait my turn in the line next to all of my friends. Some of them are talking about seeing if they'll have superpowers. One of them is wondering if he'll be a famous author. A girl is timid quietly whispering to herself that she hopes she makes it to a good college. Some other girl is wondering if she'll be married.\n\nThe line moves forward. The pure black curtain closes. I catch a glimpse of a mirror and an empty room. Once it closes, any cheering, any noise, it fades away to silence. Then it opens to an empty stall.\n\nOn my turn, I step in and the curtain closes itself. I notice how all the talk from my friends in the first room is barely a whisper now. It's like they're all moving further away, even though I can still see the feet of the boy standing in line behind me underneath the black curtain.\n\nThere's not much around here. Just the mirror.\n\nI reach out with my hand. I expected it to ripple away, but it seemed to barely. It felt like a cool gel. I pull my hand out to examine and it comes away easily. I look over at myself in the mirror. Then, before I can think twice, I leap into the mirror.\n\nA blaze of color and darkness fills my sense. Noise like cracks and banging. The smell of pennies and a pungent smoke. \n\nI'm in a room with a black tiled floor and pure red velvet curtains.\n\nSitting in a chair is a man in a dark suit. He's staring at me with empty eyes.\n\n\"Malcolm?\" I ask, my name in my own head turning things over.\n\n\"The dinosaur. He ate the moon. He ate the sun.\" The man said, his eyes never blinked as he spoke.\n\n\"He ate everyone.\" we said together. Just a way I'd thought of to be sure it was me.\n\n\"You're... you're really me.\" I said and walked towards him.\n\nHis eyes followed me, the rest of his body seemed tensed but solidly still. \"Yeah, I'm you.\"\n\nA chair seemed to fade into existence as I got closer. I sat down. His eyes didn't seem to blink. Why did they seem so dark. Weren't my eyes blue?\n\n\"We're... we're supposed to ask you questions.\" I said, watching his face. Was he even breathing? \"It's... it's uh... it's supposed to motivate us.\"\n\n\"I know.\" He said slowly, calmly.\n\n\"So... what... what's the future like?\" I ask, trying to smile.\n\n\"Hard.\" He responded. He doesn't seem to even move his lips.\n\n\"That's... that's bad.\" I say, nervously looking for something to stare at besides his eyes. \"But... but all your friends should-\"\n\n\"They're not your friends.\" He said.\n\n\"... uh, who...?\"\n\n\"Those classmates. I can't remember their names. You don't either. They're just shadows of people to you.\" His empty dark eyes seem to hook my gaze and drag it back to looking at him.\n\n\"They're... they're.. my-\"\n\n\"Name one.\"\n\nThere was a girl... she... she wanted to be married... or was it college? The boy... he was behind me... he wanted... or was he who wanted to be married?\n\n\"You'll figure it out eventually. Everyone's just a shadow.\" The man stood. I almost jumped, it was so fluid, like it had already happened. He walked just as smoothly, and each movement looked like a statue of pure solid stone and simply decided to walk. Yet, as he reached the pure red curtain, he paused. A distinctly human tone seemed to fight its way towards his voice as he said, \"I figured you deserve a jumpstart on that.\"\n\nHe disappeared into the red folds.\n\nSlowly, the curtains seems to shrink. What happened?\n\nThe curtains fluttered more. Was that really who I was?\n\nThey seemed to swirl around me, as I sat perfectly still. Who I would be?\n\nAnd then I was alone in the booth. Looking at mirror of myself.\n\n'Everyone's just a shadow.'"

        "story": "I jolted up at the sound of gunfire.\n\nThat was new.\n\n\"GET DOWN!\" came a cry and as I looked up I saw a glowing shooting star. It was coming straight at me.\n\n\"Wonder if I'll die.\" I said out loud. I looked over and saw a soldier, such an oddly old uniform, rushing towards me.\n\nI frown and shake my head just in time for the missile to hit.\n\nDying feels different after the first few times. At first it feels like you're sinking and fading away. But after the tenth time, it starts to feel less like that and more like... stretching? I wrote it down once before, had some good words, but those are gone at this point.\n\nI sit up and find myself somewhere new. This was different.\n\nNormally, or at least for the past... however many deaths, I always found myself waking up at the same time, in the same place, in the same day. I spent ages, eons, trapped like that. I could learn all I wanted, train all I wanted, but eventually, time caught up to me. I'd die and restart. It wasn't so bad. There was such a wide range of time that I never really got bored that easily. I got to spend decades seeing every possible version of myself. \n\nBut, call it human nature, a desire to explore, or plain boredom, eventually you want to see something new.\n\nSo I spent some time learning about space. About Time. About quantum foam. About radiation. Computers. Everything. I didn't quite crack it so much as pain-stakingly ripping the answers from programs and chalkboards. But I made a time machine. I wasn't sure if it'd work, or how it'd affect my condition.\n\nAnd then I suffocated in deep space.\n\nSomehow, I'd mis-calculated... probably the galactic arm's speed by a factor of whatever. In either case, I popped back up, and a missile decided I needed a hat.\n\nI look around and see a deep forest, trees larger than any I've ever seen before. The air is muggy and warm... it actually feels like it's hard to breathe. I start to walk around and feel the sun beating down through the branches. There's buzzing and insects, but it all feels wrong. I start to feel dizzy. Why is it so hard to breathe?\n\nI hear a crashing and before I pass out, I hear an inhuman roar.\n\nI jolt awake. \n\nI'm on a bed in the ocean, with some old guy looking at me like a ghost. Probably because I just popped out of thin air to him.\n\nI look around and don't see any land.\n\n\"I'm not dealing with this.\" I say and jump into the ocean. I've figured out a trick to drowning pretty quickly when I want a reset. The trick is to just sing a song while underwater. I try to go for ironic hits. Normally Jingle Bells.\n\nI jolt awake.\n\nI'm on hard rock. it looks like there's a burned out city in the distance. Which means I'm either closer to my time or this is one of the timelines where I decided to go full evil. \n\nActually, if I'm jumping around time... do I return to my original timeline or one of the ones where I was messing- \n\nOh, hey another missile. Guess it's the 2030s.\n\nI jolt awake.\n\nI'm on my bed. I look at the calendar. It's... four days to when I was trapped in the loop.\n\n\"Hi?\" said a voice to my left.\n\n\"Oh this is real weird for you.\" I said as I hopped off the bed. \"You mind if I grab some of the clothes?\" I ask myself.\n\n\"...okay.\" he/I said. \n\n\"Thanks. I wonder if it'll be different for you. Oh, and you're allergic to sesame seeds. That's why that road trip food tasted weird.\"\n\n\"yeah okay.\" he/I said as I/me walked out.\n\nShould probably build that time machine again. I wonder if me/I would want to see the dinosaurs too."
