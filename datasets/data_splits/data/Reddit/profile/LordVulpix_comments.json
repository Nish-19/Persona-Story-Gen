        "writing_prompt": "Your android daughter has been murdered. The Murderer is being charged with felony destruction of property. You're trying to convince the court to charge them with murder",
        "story": "\"Just listen, the best we can get legally is property destruction. You can't push any more. The laws only recognize the machine as just that.\" My own lawyer whispered into my ear. I was staring daggers at the android expert going over the black box information. Repeatedly saying it and not her. The black box in question was utterly and intentionally destroyed. \n\n\"No more questions for the expert your honor.\" The defense attorney said as she sat down with a smug look in her eyes. \n\nMy attorney stood up and opened his big mouth but I spoke first. \"Can I ask a few questions?\" My attorney turned to me quickly and I held my hand up as I stood. \"My own attorney doesn't believe my questions and concerns are valid, but I want to ask them of the expert. I need to hear the answers.\" The judge just sat there a moment and he looked to the two. \n\n\"You do understand that you're questioning can't be agressive or leading to the expert? That some things you say could even damage your case?\" I simply nod. \"Very well... I will allow a few questions.\"\n\n\"Thank you your honor. Sir, you said Rebecca's blackbox was far larger and more complex than most androids correct?\"\n\n\"That is correct. It was even well above standard for military droids. I never saw a machine built like that. Several hundred petabytes of data at minimum.\" \n\nI had to choke back the anger for how callous he was about her. \"The exact size was four exabytes.\" The expert actually tensed up as he heard that. \"Can you answer me, why that number is significant?\"\n\nThe expert than looks nervous as he thinks about it. \"There are known only 5 androids reported to have that particular configuration at this time.\" He then turned to look at the box on the table. \"You're saying that she was one of them? Oh shit.\" \n\n\"The serial number that was melted away on my daughter's black box was PX-006. Can you explain to the court why that matters?\" Just seeing his face pale and hearing him call Rebecca a she felt good.\n\n\"Yes, that is actually vital in this case. The PX series is a prototype digitized human android. That means that it was a human brain digitally copied and transferred into a black box such as this. We're no longer talking about a simple machine but a person's brain case. The amount of data used to correctly develop, grow and learn over time is estimated at shy of three exabytes and four is a buffer.\"\n\n\"Rebecca Heart was converted into PX-006 two years ago and was undergoing the proto tests of development. The doctors just allowed her to come home with me for the first time a few month ago. That's when this man came in and murdered her in her room!\" I pointed to the defendant who stopped looking so smug.\n\n\"Objection! This statement cannot be,\" \n\n\"Overruled.\" The judge said firmly. \n\nMy own attorney stood up. \"In light of the expert's testimony and the new evidence brought forth I move that this case be tried for murder in the first degree.\" I sat down feeling tired and ready to pass out. \"Further more, with video evidence from the home surveillance and Rebecca's own last moments as found in her memories that identified the defendant as the one who assaulted her as an anti android act akin to the racist lynching back in the early 1900s.\" \n\nI couldn't listen to the rest as the case continued and just stared at the photo of two Receccas hugging for the last time. First taken by lung cancer and the second by a man who hates machines for no reason. I could only pray for justice now."

        "writing_prompt": "Everyone else is positive that the dusty, ancient tome you found on your last expedition is a long-lost spellbook, with the grimoire containing magics long thought lost to this world. You, however, are pretty sure it's just a cookbook.",
        "story": "\"I'm telling you, the page says Devil's Dream it has to be an evil spell.\" The head of the explorer's guild said while translating it himself. I just leaned over and checked on the page that it was open too. With a quick nod I started to crack open a few eggs into a bowl.\n\n\"I'm telling you, the name translates to Devil's Lust. It is a love potion.\" A witch said while trying to read around the guild head. \"If you'd only let me turn the page and ch-\" I popped her hand as she reached for the tome.\n\n\"I'm using this page so sit back and see what it makes damn it.\" I was the one who found the book. I had it for the whole six months to study the text. I knew the context and even the translation codex. I beat the eggs with a paste made some black powdered ingredient and a thick golden liquid. \n\n\"Hold it. You're j-j-just making it?\" A guild apprentice stammered and started to back away.\n\n\"Yes, now hand me the pouch right there.\" The apprentice just flinched at the order and looked ready to run. I rolled my eyes as I spoke firmer. \"Apprentice, pass me the bag, now.\" He jumped, nearly threw the bag onto the table and ran away. I poured in the premixed concoction of powders and spores. \n\n\"The apprentice might be right. Is it really safe to do that in a city?\" The guild head said as he looks over. \"This describes a mold and Theobroma? I don't know what that is. It sounds vile.\" \n\n\"Theobroma? It is a white bug like fruit.\" The witch said looking around. \"I don't see it, though.\" \n\nI just wanted to kick the two of them out, but I can't. The guild head could pull rank and the witch could just do worse. I poured the mix I had into a pan and stuffed it into the stove. \"I used all but a quarter of it.\" I explained as I took the last bit of black powder out.\n\n\"What did you do?\" She asked while watching me pour it into a small cauldron. I followed it up with two measures of a white liquid, a glob of some viscous golden liquid and a pour of bright pink juice.\n\n\"I followed an earlier page on how to refine the Theobroma.\" I said while carefully mixing the mixture over a small flame. The mix slowly turned from a dark motley mix into a thick brown sauce.\n\n\"What is that? Smell?\" Bronx my travel companion asked while stepping in. \"Smells like that thing you made on the way back.\" \n\n\"I'm using the stuff I made to make something better. Get our party. It'll be done in a half hour.\" The delight in his eyes as he ran off to tell our party was enough to confuse the guild head.\n\n\"What did you make?\" The guild head asked. I held out a block of some black material. \n\n\"Break a piece of it off and take a bite. It's bitter.\" I went back to stirring the mix. I removed it from the heat to let it stay warm but not to burn. The witch and head both broke a piece off and took a timid bite. With a slowly widening eye the guild head popped the rest into his mouth to savior the dark bitter flavor. The witch had a scowl and handed the rest to the head.\n\n\"Too bitter. What sort of medicine is it?\" She asked suspiciously.\n\n\"Not a medicine, but a confectioner. Chocolate the book calls it. Devil's Delight is a cake made of chocolate topped with a chocolate icing.\" I explained and held out the spoon I used to stir the topping. \"Try this. It's been sweetened with honey and grapefruit juice.\" The witch just gave me a dark look before dipping a finger into it. Once she tasted it, I gave a bright smile seeing her eyes dilate even though she kept her scowl. \n\n\"I plan on making every recipe in this book, and there is even one for a cake using carrots.\"\n\n That is when I started my mastery of the Culinary Grimoir. With it I made great dishes. The only black mark on my history was accidentally taking over the kingdom of Lancet with an army of ginger bread men and cake dragons. Things like that just happen."

        "writing_prompt": "You are teaching a Human History Class when suddenly a student interrupts you. \"Why must we learn about humans? They are so boring!\"",
        "story": "\"Okay class, today we start the first day of 2 weeks of human history in today's Galactic History 302,\" I said with as much enthusiasm as I could muster. The collective groans cued me in at just how few of these students knew of this.\n\n\"Why must we learn about humans? They're so boring!\" A tellax asked while leaning against the large table. I gave the large 6 limbed insectoid a small tilt of my head. \"They're pacifists that don't even go to war when a colony is claimed by the Breets.\" He motioned to a breet classmate sitting on the table. Yeah them losing to a half meter tall weasel like species was a big blow to their historic marks.\n\n\"I bet I can take you on, Tappaph!\" The breet classmate stood up and brandished a sharpie like a sword. Before a fight before a fight between the largest and smallest still living sentient species got going I hit the bell to alert them both.\n\n\"The breet are known for their warriors culture and historic claimes to taking at least 1 colony from every species, and five worlds from the tellax. The reason that the term at least one is used because the humans have only lost one colony in their history and it was them. That is usually saved for the second to last day. Humanity has only three hundred years in the Galactic stage, but their impact changed alot.\" \n\n\"For starters, most of the common commodities and supplies used even for your worlds. They reformed everyone's market and even measurements used galaxy wide. Things not done in the four thousand years of Galactic council history. Written human history is only about six thousand years old. That means every race currently in the Galactic council has almost three to five times the Written history of humanity yet most races only need a week for their history. There is a very dense history. The earliest history is found in massive stone pyramids and hieroglyphics.\" \n\nI pulled up the images of the pyramids of Giza. \"These structures are built on sand and remained standing to even today. They have an expensive unwritten history of building great monuments like this. Stone Hinge, the gardens of Babylon and even the Aztec Pyramids.\" I displayed pictures of each of them. One showing myself on vacation infront of stone hinge. \"As you can see they still stand. Even the humans have no idea of how these where built to last.\" \n\n\"You may still say that is boring, but a thousand years after the first known Written words they had a great war known as the Trojan War where a Troy was so well defended that the Achaeans could not claim the city by force. They then built a massive wooden horse and had soldiers climb in. They gifted the horse to the Trojans and when they took it into the city, they celebrated a victory and got drunk. That night the soldiers left the horse and then opened the gates. Under the cover of night they slaughtered the Trojans and took the city.\" \n\nThe stunned and shocked silence always made me smile. \"That was around the 12 or 13th century BCE. Roughly a the same time as the first recorded FTL flight in our Galaxy. That war and event is why you all recognize the term Trojan Virus. It was named after the historical war so long ago.\" Casual nods and ming blown looks just made me smirk.\n\n\"At the same time as the signing of the Galactic Charter for the first council, there was the Spartan Battle of Thermopylae. You all know of the modern Spartan soldiers that the humans have on patrol in neutral zones. Their name came from a Greek city state called Sparta. The battle of Thermoptlae is also known as the battle of 300.\"\n\n\"The Persian empire of the time planned on conquering Greece and the Spartan King lead his forces to cut the army at the pass. Seeing that they where being flanked Leonidas and 300 of his own Spartan soldiers remained to face the army. The full Greek military had only seven thousand men while the Persians had as far as historians are able to estimate from seventy thousand to three hundred thousand. The stalwart three hundred held the pass for three days before falling in battle.\" \n\n\"Outnumbered ten to fourty two times the number of soldiers the Sparans and Greeks forced a reteate of the Persians. Ultimately the Persians won, but consider just the odds for your own species. Thats-\" I was cut off by the bell to signal class change. \"Damn. Read up to chapter ten by next class in the provided history documents. That will take you to the founding of the Roman Empire as well as the Chinese Dynesties.\" \n\nMost of the class grumbled as they got up. I even heard the tellax muttering at how cool all of that sounded. \"To species who can watch class 6 restricted movies and above look up the Human Movie 300 for a cemimatic recreation of the battle of Thermopylae.\" \n\n\"Oh I will. The humans sound awesome. Spartans...\" The tiny breet said with a cackle as she flew past on a hover disk with her bag. I just shook my head as I took the first step in dispelling the false ideal that humans are pacifists. \n\n\"I hope they don't read too far ahead. World War One is quite the hard lesson for some races...\""

        "story": "I was cursed by divine blessings. I prayed to the three sisters and got each of their blessings. I had no idea that I would be their chosen champion. \n\nI first was met by Oriole the goddess of Spring Rains. She came to me after a grand harvest. She tasked me with a challenge to grow a seed not seen grown in a thousand years. I cared for the seed and kept it safe. It took almost a year of growing before it produced a glorious golden fruit.\n\nIn that time I was given a challenge by her sister, Robin the goddess of Summer Sun. She tasked me with hunting a crimson wyrm that threatened the valley. I prepared myself and marched up the mountain on a foul rainy day. With determination I faced it.\n\nIt spewed flaming breath and tried to slice me in two with her claws. I sliced and cut it with the mythril sword I forged. She tried to fly off and I cut her wing deeply. She fell hurled large boulders at me and I broke them with my adamantite hammer. Her final attack was a desperate charge and jaws open. I delivered a swift cleave that took her head. Deeper in the cave I found her most precious treasure, a massive ruby. It was heavy and I barely brought it home.\n\nThe Autumn Storm goddess Raven spoke to me when I visited the temple as the first leaf fell. I knew she was a goddess of grim tidings and dark omens. She said a great black beast will visit the valley soon. It would be the destroyer of all things and it once served her will only on the full moon, now it is wild and vicious. She bade me to peirce its heart with a silvered blade and bring her its hide.\n\nI found it at the valley's entrance. A ragged man with long black hair. He spoke of the coming feast and that I would be his first treat. I brandished my silver sword and wore dragon scale armor. We as the sun set he turned into a massive black wolf. His teeth bit into the scales, but never pierced my skin. His claws dulled on my shield. His final howl echoed across the valley as I plunged my sword into his chest. In his death he cursed the gods, but I claimed his pelt as demanded of me.\n\nI waited till the grand new years festival when I would present the three gifts to the temple. A basket of plump golden berries, a massive ruby and the black fur of the monster. Orion the lord of the Heavens and father of the three called me to the heavens. There standing before me was the three goddess sisters. \"As you have asked daughters, I have summoned your Champions, yet only he has come. What gift have you brought?\"\n\n\"Oh great Orion I have been tasked with growing a plant from a seed, one not found in a thousand years. This is the product of my labors.\" I passed forward the golden berries. \n\n\"Blessed strawberries? Curious. I guess it was Oriole's challenge?\" \n\n\"Yes sir. For the Summer Sun I was tasked with felling the red dragon that threatened the valley. I found in her den this great ruby.\" I presented the massive ruby.\n\n\"That is the Egg of the Sun Wyrm. A once great pet of my daughter.\" I felt my heart stop as i fearfully though about the scale armor I wore. \"That wyrm you've slain was just a mad beast and not the great pet of legends. You did well. And the last?\" \n\n\"Th-ahem This is the pelt of a horrid nightmare wolf that threatened to consume the people of the Valley. The Autumn Wind Raven asked me to bring it here for it once was her follower.\"\n\n\"Yes... he was granted a boon of the hunt as the first werewolf a thousand years ago as the Lunar Wolf. He and the Sun Wyrm fought a thousand years ago and together they burned the whole of the Blessed Strawberries my Daughter Avia the Harvest Goddess loved so. Torn between grief for her garden, rage at the loss of her pet and pride of the monster she made her spirit broke into three.\"\n\nI remember hearing of the old legendary Harvest Goddess who took the form of a great rainbow bird. I then turned to the three who looked abashed as their history. \"Father, then who wins?\" Raven asked first. \"Who is the true goddess of the harvest?\"\n\n\"This challenge was supposed to be you three finding a champion and the winner would be betrothed to you as the true Harvest Goddess, but this man in one year did it for all three.\" Orion said and my heart stopped for the second time. \n\n\"Betrothed? I-I...\"\n\nOrion held his hand up. \"I told them not the truth either. Yet it may seem that a true Harvest God may be before me. Be married to my split daughter and bless the world with your union. You have done great deeds to earn this title. In time the power will come to you. Tell me, what is your name, son?\"\n\n\"My name? It's Hawk. I'm just a farmer though.\" \n\nOrion's smile grew. \"That is all I wish of you Hawk, God of Farmers. With my daughters as your brides you may do great things. Great blessings will fall upon the world at this Union. Congratulations.\" A thunderous applause echoed as the whole Pantheon of Gods cheered form me. \n\nI awoke on the first day of the new year with a powerful hangover and my stunningly beautiful brides arguing in the kitchen over how to properly make breakfast. After putting the fire out I started to cook. I didn't know the kind of life that was going to start on my farm in the heart of this Valley. \n\nMore so now that the Sun Wyrm just hatched burning my barn down. At least my wives are happy with the baby dragon."

        "story": "Gez'Vakith stalked through the dark tunnels and turned sensing fresh souls waiting to be harvested. It's golden carapace had an ethereal presence as it saw the aftermath of the fight. The being stopped as it gazed into the spawning chamber. Countless larve dead and dozens of soldiers killed. The ones who caused the death where scaled beasts with fire and bombs. \n\nA buzz of its wings drew up the threads of souls that where once warrior brood. A quick tug and the soul was pulled free. It then felt a strong soul soon to be ready for harvest, a queen. Precious and rare for one to die in battle, but this young queen would die soon. Her thorax was fractured and a leg missing, vital fluid pouring out of her. Gez'Vakith drooled at the sight. Soon, her soul would be it's prize. \n\n\"MOVE IT!!!\" A mortal shoved Gez'Vakith aside like it was a balloon. A still living and horrid being just shoved it! Amid the boiling rage and indignation Gez'Vakith bared it's claws to cut this being down when it saw the glimmering soul of the young queen about to leave her body. \"Don't you give up! You aren't getting harvested tonight!\" The mortal jabbed a needle into her cracked thorax and injected the queen with something. \n\nA gasp and the soul was drawn into the body. More of these mortals rushed in. One seared the leg closed with a plasma blade. Vital fluids where pumped into her frame as glue was used to seal the cracks. The harvester of souls rushed in to claim the soul so rightly it's. A golden fist punched into the being's mandibles. Five of these strange mortals worked to save the queen, and around them their own souls stood a fierce vigil keeping it back.\n\n- - - In a distant war zone. - - - \n\nZaphrel roared as his blade cut down scores of the warrior souls who fell in war too a fresh species. They fought well and glorious. He saw the Death of the enemy carry a large scythe and had to work hard to cut each soul from their bodies. \"Your souls look as if they are causing you trouble. Let me show you how it's done!\" Zaphrel towered over a fallen soldier and swung his blade. It chipped on the soul.\n\n\"It's not easy, is it?\" A hallow voice rang out and Zaphrel swung again intending to cut the soul free when a mortal body blocked the blade snapping it in two. \"Now you face the true champion of my harvest.\" Death said with a laugh and moved on to a less fortunate soul.\n\nA combat medic jabbed a large needle full of adrenaline into the dying soldier's heart and started to dress the massive wound that intended to end the soldier's life. Zaphrel watched the medic move off, cutting the death of humanity off long enough to save another. \"I see they do bother you while you work. You have my respect, Death.\"\n\nZaphrel turned to his own species and raised a fresh blade to cut free another soul only for another human medic to jump in the way of his new blade. It bounced off the living being once more. Some of his honored dead being brought back by force. \"Frustrating, isn't it?\" Death said and paused to look over into the far distance. \"I will let her take that soul... he gave it willingly.\"\n\n- Ground zero of a major earthquake. -\n\nBuulatel wept as she saw the collapsed building. Her long flowing fur bound in flowers and vines. She placed a hand on the building and saw flower buds spring up from the rubble. She tenderly plucked the souls from their forms as she cried. A few tiny buds not yet ready to bloom was the last. She let out a soft sob knowing how young the souls had to be. \"Forever too young.\" \n\nA belowing roar filled the air as the concrete shifted and a figure pushed the very stone off his body. Rescue teams dashed across the collapsed building and the human held up the rebar and concrete. \"The cubs!\" He roared as everything shifted. Two young cubs where pulled from under the human. The Rescue team turned just in time to see the human smile and collapse with the weight on him. Instantly a towering tree of flowers sprung up from the rubble. A soul stronger than she ever harvested was standing there waiting for her. \n\n\"He gave his life willingly...\" The word felt heavy on her mind as she turned to the cubs. Both now crying from the ordeal, but very much not ready to be plucked."

        "story": "Thomas gave a moment to check his beard in the mirror near the nightstand. A thick well kept but almost silver beard replaced his once crimson mane. His royal guard uniform was crisp and well kept as he gave a quick glance out to the clock tower. A quarter till two. \"Princess Sophia, Matron West, it is nearly two. The young princess should be getting ready for tea time.\" A happy gasp escaped the princess as she hopped up to put her books and study materials away. Her tutor just gave a nod. \n\n\"I'll leave a list of homework for you to complete over the weekend, my princess. Do enjoy your tea time and the ball this weekend.\" The old tutor said as she sat out some more school work, before leaving. Princess Sophia just ignored her as she pulled out Mister Wiggles from her bed side and handed him to me before she ran to her closet to change from her study uniform to a more relaxed sun dress.\n\n\"Princess, might I suggest you wear that nice wide hat today? It looks like it's a cloudless day and may be bright.\" I said while giving Mister Wiggles a quick inspection and a gentle dusting. \n\n\"Okay, we are having tea in the gardens, right?\" Sophia asked as she stepped out with a bright smile.\n\n\"Indeed we are.\" I gave the 7 year old princess a quick look over before offering my arm. \"M'lady, may I escort you to tea then?\" She just beamed up at me as we walked. Her hand on my wrist and a teddy bear in my arm. The sharp click of my dress shoes announced our walk to the garden. Castle Guards and other Royal Guards stopped to salute the princess. Staff stopped and bowed as we walked out to a lone table with a chef and a cart waiting for us. A gentle breeze stole a petal or two from the rose bushes as we neared the table.\n\nThe chef gave a respectful bow as I helped her to her seat. I then placed Mister Wiggles in his own seat across from her, tieing a bib to his neck and the chair to keep him upright. I then moved to leave. \"Sir Thomas,  can you join me?\" The princess asked in a soft tone.\n\n\"If you so wish, I shall.\" I gave a crisp salute and than joined her at the table. Fresh tea was poured for the three of us. I lifted the cup to my nose to enjoy the aroma as she added in honey to her cup. \"This is a delightful blend.\" I took a sip as I let the flavor flow through me. \"Chef, if I'm not mistaken, is this the same blend that Queen Madalyn enjoyed.\" \n\n\"I, I'm shocked you noticed, sir. Yes it is. This blend was made to the taste of our dear Princess's Grandmother. I had hoped that she too would enjoy the taste.\" I saw the princess lift her cup and then gave a soft cough to get her attention. I wiggled my pinky finger to remind her of proper etiquette. \n\n\"Thank you, Sir Thomas.\" She took a sip and her eyes went wide. She had to fight to not drain the cup in one go. \"It's fantastic. Thank you. My grandmother liked this too?\" The princess then fixed me with a curious look, before turning to Mister Wiggles. \"Mister Wiggles, was asking how did you know Grandmother? He never met her.\" \n\n\"Oh, I was under the impression that he did, he must have forgotten.\" I said while smiling to the princess. She was always a shy girl and preferred to use her bear as an excuse to ask questions. \"You see, Mister Wiggles was chosen for you by your grandmother when you were born. I do wish I you could have known her like I did.\" Sophia gave the precious bear a long look.\n\n\"He said that you must have served her a long time too. You've been around a long time, Sir Thomas.\" I saw the spark of curiosity in her eyes, yet she was nervous to ask. \"C-can you tell me what you did?\"\n\n\"It would be my pleasure. I started my service in the army for your grandmother when she was going to become queen. I served to fight off various monsters as her personal guard. The first thing I did to save her was fight off a Manticore as it attacked her wagon on the way to her wedding and coronation. I stood guard in the court for years, going out to fight grat monsters like wyverns and devils.\" The raptured look of attention told me to keep going. \n\nI soon told the whole story of how a lone soldier faced a Manticore and saved the queen. Over several more tea parties, I shared my whole history of service to her family, slowly coaxing the bright young princess out of her shell. By the time I told her of my fight against the scourge of the south she stopped using Mister Wiggles as an excuse to ask questions. \n\n\"So, after you fought that mean scourge dragon, what happened?\" Princess Sophia asked while bouncing in her seat. The King and Queen where with us this day, pleased to see their daughter so open. \n\n\"I was injured in the fight as I told you. My speed of my youth has been failing me for a bit, but I am still the best blade of the Kingdom, Princess. When your father saw me so beaten after a mere dragon fight, he offered me a chance to retire with honors. I declined and said, there is no greater honor than serving your family. He then asked me to be your own guardian. The worst I have had to slay for you is a particularly angry wasp.\" \n\nThe king knew that was a lie, but the princess did not need to know about the few failed kidnapping attempts. \"Indeed, you served three generations of my family, and even shown me how to bear a sword.\" The king touched a small scar on his eyebrow from my own sword. \"I see now I was foolish to try and force my best knight to retire over a few scratches. This was a good afternoon tea. I should get back to the court.\" I snapped to attention and saluted. \"At ease, old friend. Do keep my daughter safe from the wasps.\""

I was looking out over a large map showing the world, various small golden pearls moving about and growing in power. \"So... you said each of these have the power to become THE Hero?\" I grumbled as I leaned over.

A greater evil to kill you.\" Those words where said as a whisper that chilled even the volcano below us. \"You are here to keep good from winning this world.\"\n\nI leaned back while looking at the hundreds of pearls moving around. A chill gripped at my bones, and I created a ball of flame to warm myself. \"And if I fail to stop the Heroes, I die for good?\" The malicious smile grew. \"I see. First off, you are the picture perfect figure for the definition of A-hole.\"\n\n\"You can curse. You... may not last...\"\n\n\"I can do it how I want as long as I go for godhood?

I'm cute enough to not look evil, and if the strongest few heroes think that I'm on their side... whose to say that I won't reach god level by playing both sides.\" \n\nEvil itself slammed me into the wall with a terrible roar. Shadows formed taloned arms. \"You, will die for suggesting such an act.\" \n\n\"The... most evil is turning heroes to our side... then betraying the ones who won't. Playing the side of good so when I get the divine power, I do so as a villain.\" Evil just glowered at me. \"I won't be good, just make them think my lieutenant is the dark lord while keeping safe. I won't lose, thus evil won't lose. Play the long game.\"\n\nEvil just made blades form and press to my neck. \"How quickly did the last guy die? 2 years? My game will last centuries. My evil will not fade, but be spread by the very heroes who could end me.\"\n\nEvil just gave a sickening smile. \"Well planned. You have five years to impress me. Betray ME and I will personally skin you alive, fox.\" It let me go and faded away, for now.\n\n\"5 years... Better get started.\" I said as I split myself into 9 copies. Each gave a nod as they went off to act as the one staying behind started to summon the dark army."

        "story": "Sisst, gave a long suffering sigh as he woke up in a jail cell of the small village he tried going too. It had been five days since he showed up just hoping for a chance to survive. A month since his exile. \n\nThe sheriff poured a cup of coffee for himself as one of the deputies just went on home. \"So, lizard, the judge should be here today. How do you think they'll take to an exile walking into a human town like this? Eh?\"\n\n\"I would hope they would listen to my story. Your deputies like to splash me with water when I get to some parts. Says I'm a witch doctor or something.\" Sisst just gave the sheriff a gentle look. \"You didn't want to talk before, why?\"\n\n\"I don't like exiles, but you asked to speak to a judge and asked for sanctuary till they arrive. I will do what needs to be done.\" \n\n\"Is that why the jail doors are never locked? You want me to escape so you can shoot me?\" The pure fury in the sheriff's eyes made his cold blood freeze. \"I will obey your laws, sir. My exile would not happen if I was human.\" \n\nThe cup of coffee was slammed on the table and the jail door thrown open as the sheriff stormed in. \"What does that mean, LIZARD?\" He bellowed at me while gripping the handle of his pistol tightly. \n\n\"What I did to be exiled is not a crime to you humans, but done by those who are well paid and respected.\" Sisst said just remaining in his seated position as he looked up at the furious man. \"I did what I did for love of my sister, if you would hear me out, I would explain.\" \n\n\"Then why not listen, Sheriff Calloway.\" The firm voice of a man shook the sheriff and made him spin. Standing at the door frame was an older human in a nice suit. \"Step out before you beat the lizard, and sit down.\" The sheriff looked ready to kick Sisst before he spun around and sat in the chair taking up his coffee. \"Now, what's your name and why are you here?\"\n\n\"I am Sisst, I have no tribe name after my exile. I saw a human town as I traveled for some place to live and tried here.\" Sisst, stood up and respectfully bowed to the new man.\n\n\"I'm Judge Walker. Why are you an exile?\" The man poured his own cup of coffee as he gave me a hard look.\n\n\"My sister, Hammu, grew ill and had something our people call the black lump. A growth that starts on the lungs and causes water breathing to be hampered if not impossible. It in time kills.\" Sisst just turned to pace a few steps in his cell. \"I took several trips into the swamp for specific ingredients to concoct a powerful sedative and healing potion.\"\n\n\"So you drugged your sister to death?\" The Sheriff said just ready to pounce like a cougar.\n\n\"No, I put her to sleep. With sharp knives and a steady hand I cut her body open, cut off the black lump and proceeded to sew her lung and scales shut. My crime is witchcraft and sorcery. My reason, was I wished to save my sister. Once she was awake, she recovered quite fast, but could do nothing to spare me as I did it without telling her first.\"\n\nThe judge just sipped his coffee a bit as he considered my story. \"Where did you learn all that you needed to do that?\" \n\n\"A book, I brought it with me but the Sheriff took it along with my few remaining possessions.\" Sisst said looking to the sheriff. A grumble and the man stood to grab the ragged leather sack that was Sisst's life. In it was a slightly ruined and damaged book. \"The first words sound so, good.\"\n\nThe judge read the first few lines aloud. \"By these teachings and in the eyes of the gods, I swear to never use my blade and teachings to cause undue harm and pain of others. I will freely give of my skill to the mending of body and healing of ills. I shall persevere to never abuse those under my care for any reason.\" Judge Walker than looked at several marked pages. \"Threads good for sewing up skin, knots and ties, even ways of cleaning a wound. It'sa medical textbook.\" \n\nThe sheriff just turned hearing that. \"He's no witch, but a doctor? Bull!!\"\n\n\"My sister lives, healed. I disobeyed my people to save her life. I do not regret it. I would obey my oath here too.\"\n\nThe judge just gave a soft scoff. \"The lizard doctor, Sisst. Might not be so bad. This town could use a doctor.\""

        "writing_prompt": "A vampire lives in a village showing his/her powers, but the inhabitants are pretty chill about his/her presence there.",
        "story": "A carriage rolled into the small village of Trotoro. A beefy woman held the reins of the horses pulling it along as she looked around. She had a large axe next to her and a silver cross on her neck. Beside her, a young woman in flowing blue robes turned to look around. \"I think this is the village, but it seems so peaceful.\" \n\n\"Too peaceful.\" The large woman agreed as she hit the carriage wall behind her. \"Wake up, we're here.\"\n\nThe door flew open and a slim man jumped out with a bow at the ready. He started to jog up with the horses as he looked around. \"Good, just about noon. Perfect time.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but if they are as strong as we heard they may be up this early. No need for them to sleep.\" A noble looking man in heavy armor leaned out as a large chain flail hung at his hip. \"Ask around.\"\n\nThe bowman jogged up ahead and spoke to a random woman asking about rumors of a vampire in the area. \"Vampire? Only Old Brom. Now you better not be here to hurt him. If you are. I'll hurt you too.\" She threatened the bowman with her broom, causing him to retreat to his party.\n\n\"I got a name, but she might be enthralled. Brom is the name.\" He said as he joined the others. The woman and a few friends of hers just glared at the party. \n\n\"Maybe the whole town.\" The noble said while looking around.\n\nLater at the Belching Idiot Tavern the party reconvened after going around town asking about Old Brom. The archer was sporting a black eye, the noble was covered in some mud and dirt that kids threw at him. The large woman had freshly healed pitchfork holes healed up. Only the mage looked rather refreshed. \"The whole town is enthralled. We may need the church to help.\" The archer said with a sigh.\n\n\"Even the kids are on his side.\" The noble said as he pulled mud off his armor.\n\n\"I haven't been stabbed by a pitchfork since I was sleeping with that farmer in Cal Marie.\" The tall woman grumbled. \"They're all defending him.\"\n\n\"Well, I mean, he might not be all evil.\" The mage said as she looked up from a meal that just appeared before her with a mist washing over the table. \n\n\"What makes you say that?\" The large woman took up her food to eat before the tension of the other two caught her. The noble slowly turned to look as the mist reformed into a pale man in a nice suit. He grabbed four mugs and filled them with ale. His arm broke apart into bats and carried the four ales around the bar to other regulars. \n\n\"That... that's him...\" The noble reached for his blessed flail only to notice it was gone. The archer grabbed for his bow only to spot it hanging on a rack behind a gated off area. \"When did he...?\" \n\n\"When you ordered.\" A bat squeaked from above them. It just looked down at them as it hung there. \"No weapons or no food and drink. Tavern Rules.\"\n\nThe large woman stood up ready to attack the bat when a firm hand pushed her back down. \"My child, please remain calm.\" An old priest said as he stepped up to the table, before regarding the bat with a nod. \"Afternoon, Brom.\"\n\n\"Afternoon, Father. How did the baptism of little Mary go? Good I hope.\" \n\n\"Oh, she acted like she was possessed till I got her baptized. Wanted nothing to do with the water. Once she was wet though... like her mother and sister she cried till she was put back in.\" The bat squeaked out a big laugh as the vampire kept working.\n\n\"Tessa was quite the wild girl. I dare say her daughters would disappoint me if they where half the trouble their mother was when I raised her.\" The vampire said as he noticed the party all look nervous except the mage who spent the whole afternoon in his tavern. \n\n\"These kids aren't causing problems are they, Brom?\" The priest said softly, but the rest of the tavern seemed to catch those words.\n\n\"Naah, they're the usual type. Young and not really getting the hint that the scary Vampire Lord is just a tavern and orphanage owner.\"\n\n\"Orphanage?\" The noble said as he got to his feet.\n\n\"Yup, about 90 years or so ago was that big war. Ever since than I took kids in under my roof. Hell the last big fight and the sacking of Kurst had like 6 new kids join my orphanage.\" The vampire bat turned into a human form before sitting down looking tired. \"I'm tired of seeing new kids after every random conflict that sparks up. Hell, you two have the orphan air obout you.\" He points to the archer and large woman.\n\n\"I... I never...\" the archer than gave the table and meal a long look. The simple stew and a few cuts of fresh fruit reminded him of the few times the he had a birthday at the orphanage. \"I...\" \n\nBrom pat his shoulder before getting up. \"Just relax. You're safe here kid. All of you are. There hasn't been an evil vampire in this town for 50 years. I made sure of that. I have kids to protect, like that one right there.\" He motioned to the priest as he moved off in a misty form. \"Come on Father I'll make your favorite.\" The party just started to eat in silence as the priest left them alone.\n\nThe mage was the first to speak. \"So... you met Brom, but he's not the only one in town that is considered a monster. He said the banker is a Werewolf who locks himself in the vault on the full moon and the Tax collector is a living skeleton.\""

        "story": "\"So, take it from the beginning.\" Lindsey Lafayette said while holding up a pen to take notes. I was sitting across the desk from the desk in the best suit I had. My hero suit. I was dressed from head to toe in tight protective armor. A dark purple with gold accents here and there. My mask was on at her request, but the voice amplifier was off. \n\n\"Well, it started small. Stopping crooks in convenience stores and gas stations. I wore spandex then, really gives a wedgie. Anyway, I moved up rather slowly, and I built up my connections. I'm sure everyone loves to bring up the Tristars Magical Girl incident, and I've said too much on that to go over here in this interview. So I'll just mention that was my spark to reach the big leagues and become a nationally recognized Hero.\"\n\n\"We are aware and will respect your decision to bot ask further,\" Lindsey said with a soft smile. \"But how did you wind up in pharmaceutical fields?\"\n\n\"Well, that started with one of like five nemesis I had. Doctor Pain. See he was an MD who had to steal to pay his own bills. Anyway, we got to talking and I eventually suggested that he start making cheap medicines for people. Of course, legally and selling them legit. With the help of the four others we founded the Shadow Pharmacy. We only ran into red tape and legal blocks from congress in stopping our company, but we still made more money in one year than they would steal in 5.\"\n\n\"Really, five super villains going legit was that profitable?\" \n\n\"Oh yeah, they had in lines on some places that where for sale or going default, then scooped it up with dark web connections. They're motivated and driven individuals each with their own loyal staff of minions and henches. Once I pushed that medical and dental should be provided the men and women working for them just doubled down.\"\n\n\"The fall of Psyco Dragon was because half of his hench work force went over to us. Scientists who worked for other villains worked with us because we where doing good and helping people.\"\n\n\"And then you took over the nation.\" Lindsey seemed nervous to lead us to that point.\n\n\"I mean, yes and no. I didn't take over the nation to rule it, but I did run for president. Just, I never knew how many senators and congressmen loyal to Shadow Pharmacy got elected till the bills and amendments to change our system was actually thrown on my desk.\" I gave a long sigh. \"My five closest confidants, all admitted to me recently that I would make a good King of America. I told them I have no interest in being King. I was in this yo help people and change things. Now...\"\n\n\"Now you're the Emperor of America with only Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina not yet annexed into this nation. In fact, my sources say that Shadow Pharmacy is already trying to work in Europe and Australia. You may be on the way to being the Emperor of Earth. How do you feel about that? Our global poll has you with a staggering 71% approval rating in other countries.\"\n\n\"I feel... like the Super Villain that won.\" I gave Lindsey a long slow sigh. \"Am I a bad guy?\""
