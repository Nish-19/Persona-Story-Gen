        "story": "...   \n...   \nbut nothing happened\n\nSurprised, Sir Gregorius the Third, master of Arcane Arts, Teacher and Director of the Fire House, was just surprised. The silence, the \"nothing happening\", left a palpable taste in the air for both participants.\n\nA smirk formed into Christina. Gregorius though about being sarcastic, but the words were escaping his mouth without him being aware of. \"How\" was left hanging in the air, before he could be back to his persona - but it was too late.\n\n\\- \"Impressed, Greg?\" - Christina knew that Gregorius would hate the nickname. That's precisely why she went with it anyway - \"I knew you would be.\"\n\n\\- \"So... you somehow discovered how to counter my magic, just to make a point. *Very impressive* for someone that says that science beats everything...\" - but he knew it was a lie - he could not sense any magic on either Christina or the device she was holding.\n\n\\- \"Magic is the arts of few. Science is the art of many. You can't evolve your *magic* because you keep fighting between each other, claiming that one have more aptitude for a school than the other. Science studies. We make hypothesis. We fail. Then we try again. We make calculations. When things don't work, we dive deeper. And deeper. Your 'magic' is encoded in the laws of the universe, we just had to find a way to 'decode' it. And we did. So much, that we 'encoded' on this cellphone a piece of anti-magic field. Ah, don't ask for your friends - such spell doesn't actually exist - we invented it, by reversing the spin of the M-qualia that entangles with the magician. Oh, but you wouldn't know what that means - you're just a mage, after all, you think that this is all 'inherited attribute' or 'mana' or some other stuff\" - she came closer, smiling, a terrifying smile - \"*It is* ***not***\"  \n\\---  \nThat was ten years ago. They are friends now, Christina and Gregorius. They are part of a revolutionary group of terrorists called \"quali-mana\", to compromise. It's a horrible name, but people know who they are, for better of worse.\n\nShe didn't understand the wonders of magic - why the long training, why the discipline; He didn't understand the wonders of technology - how it is ubiquitous, democratic.\n\nTwo childish dreamers, screaming at each other, calling names like brats - for he knew that archmages used to declare wars on multiple countries, and had slain thousands of people just for a \"place of power\"; and she knew that a few people with power and money were able to buy all research they wanted, and basically have a monopoly on technologies.\n\nThe \"Reverse Engineering\" spell could have been a game changer on the world - if she developed a tool for it, humanity could find all secrets behind everything; energy could be free, for one could cast \"reverse engineering\" on the Sun to understand the secrets of nuclear fusion; nobody would own something from a monopolistic company because everyone could \"reverse engineer\" it with a simple spell, being trained on the mystical arts or not.\n\nBut no - they decided to keep the childish discussion of which toy was better. They both lost, when billionaires funded techno-magical wonders, and basically became immortal in every possible sense - neither magic, nor physical attacks work against them - for they were protected with magical-engineered implants and magical-engineered nanobots running on their blood stream. \n\nImmortals that exploit and enslave everyone, everywhere, to keep the technology on the hands of the 0.5%, to fuel their petty wars, to maintain the dystopian reality where 99.5% of the world is almost dying of hunger, of poisoning, living in abysmal conditions just so that few would prosper.\n\nThe only chance they have is on the final stroke of hope - a machine that will reverse-engineer the universe, and re-write the rules so that no magic, nor technology, could exist; one that as soon as people understood a concept, the very laws of nature would change so that concept is not valid anymore.\n\nShould that work, humanity will be forever changed, maybe even will be extinct. If it doesn't, humanity will be forever enslaved.\n\nThere were be no winners on this game; they both know that.\n\nAnd they both know that is their own fault..."

I went to sleep, and dreamed something I don't remember. But as soon as I woke up, I could feel it - the dream, yet close, but far away. Like a place I can just see, but no matter how much I run, I can't catch it. That was the feeling, that was what I kept feeling day after day.\n\nUntil I decided to clear my mind, and my basement. And I found part of a note in the walls, just behind a brick. Did someone cemented a note?\n\nThe brick was loose. As my life would be, as soon as I read that note. It was delivered to me, from me.\n\n> This is so weird, but try to not react. After you read this, just throw it away as if it's an uninteresting thing. You don't remember any of this, or maybe I won't remember any of this - but it happened. You killed a villain, and somehow reset the reality before anything could happen. Also, she might not look like now, but Millena will become really beautiful in the future, and if you talk to her right now you'll see she's really fun to be with. Get close, you won't regret.\n>\n> Also - they promised me 1 million in my (your?) account. If they didn't do it, find the brick that have a red and blue mark on it - it's yours to use as much as you want.\n>\n> With Love, You (or Me - who cares?)\n\nI basically obeyed the rule, and threw the note away. I decided not looking at the marked brick, after I though I caught something moving in the shadows - was I being surveyed?\n\nStill, the feelings lingered. The dreams that I forgot as soon as I woke up. Feeling helpless, than feeling powerful.\n\nI also decided, after some weeks, to talk to Millena. He (I?) was right: she _is funny_ to be with, and after two months, we were dating. We were happy.\n\nThe feelings of being followed stopped after a year. I could go to and from the basement with ease. \n\nOne day, after cleaning everything, I left, purposely, a key at the basement. As soon as the lights went out, before going to sleep, I made a routine of locking the doors, and made-believe that I forgot my keys - maybe they aren't following me anymore, but better safe than sorry. I made some motion as if I was falling, so I could grab the weird brick - mind you, I was never a good actor, so I ended up feeling I wasn't being natural, then it became _too natural_ and I literally slipped on the g-damned keys, grabbed the brick that was, indeed, loose, and felt into the ground.\n\nSomething fell into me - maybe it whatever was hidden. In my hands... there was something.\n\nAnd I immediately knew what it was.\n\nMemories came back. Feelings were back. What I held in my hands were one of the most powerful inventions ever made, capable of changing the world, of making everything into an utopia - if I could harness the power correctly.\n\nI knew I couldn't. Because I knew I already tried, and destroyed everything. \n\nAnd was paid to fix my own mistake, in a very dangerous way, one that changed me forever.\n\nI now sit in front of the machine. I know what I can do; I know what I can't do; and I know what I _should_ do.\n\nI still am not sure what I **will** do..."

Good luck buddy. Want a drink?\"\n\n\\- \"Give me your best drink. If I know myself, I am waiting for this for a long, long time. Probably had one when we destroyed everything, but it might be too lonely, right?\" - He laughs. I laugh.\n\nTwo maniacs drinking their minds out, laughing and joking;\n\nto a future without humans; where only I exist, watching over the world, seeing it heal;\n\nto a future where even I will perish, happy and alone.\n\nTo peace, forever."

        "story": "Enough was enough.\n\nHumanity always sent criminals, people on the death rows, volunteers, to these events. They were, of course, quickly annihilated - no organization, no real power, no real advantage.\n\nIt started when other aliens started the bullying.\n\nWhen in every intergalactic decision, humanity was left aside because \"they were too weak\" to even have a vote.\n\nWhen they made a poll to decide if humans should even be considered \"intelligent species\".\n\nSo this time, ten tributes were sent, again - the lowest possible number, reserved for the losers of the previous sessions.\n\nBut this time, they were ten highly-trained soldiers, from multiple countries - the best of the best, even better than whatever could be deployed on Earth, considering that some of the countries were still not one hundred percent at peace with each other.\n\nThe aliens, again, laughed. They joked about \"humanity is starting to become serious, I guess?\" looking at their under-developed weapons, on their fragile bodies that would break the moment a single Zarhan could hold them.\n\nBut no Zarhan would hold a person this time.\n\nThe timer was on, and immediately, the aliens went to the humans.\n\nThe first ones were blinded by a stun grenade. Luckily for the Orins, they relied more on sound, so tunning they ears, they found...\n\n... nothing.\n\n*That was weird*, they though, but then they recognized a sound - a scream, from one of their own.\n\nWhere *were* the humans? Sure, it was an artificially-made forest, but still it wasn't that big - how could they simply... disappear?\n\nAnother scream. The Galoops were falling,  one by one, a race that could camouflage against anything.\n\nDid the humans... killed they?\n\nA Zarhan was sobbing - he had lost two of their five arms, and he was in horrible pain.\n\nOne of the Orins showed his trophy - a human arm - but the same human sliced one of his necks, and pushed a bullet on his friend by his side. He was now losing a lot of his vital fluids, faster than his self-generate could handle, but still tried to put a fight - but the human was not there anymore.\n\nIn his place, was a grenade.\n\nOne human died in the battle. It was a tactical error the other nine would not repeat.\n\nFive hours have passed. The Zarhan were no more - the huge, strong, and faster aliens that ever existed - were destroyed, all fifteen of them.\n\nThe others were panicking. Some tried to flee, and got caught into traps. Some were left in these traps for hours, crying in pain, for his friends were too scared to help. Others suffered such horrible torture for these cruel devices that skilled medics and soldiers tried to help them, only for them to be exterminated from gunshots that seemed to come from nowhere, and at the same time, everywhere.\n\nDid the humans... evolved? No, that could not be. But they were *sure* there were only nine humans, one without a full arm.\n\nHow could the gunshots appear from such different places?\n\nAnother three hours passed. The public was horrified - they could not stand a single minute more seeing that torturous warfare. And yet humanity pushed forward - slicing, gunning, exploding. The Rhons where still close to intact, for their exoskeleton could handle the human's bullets, but the whole thing was starting to take its toll on their mental state. Even *knowing that the bullets* would just scratch lightly their skin, every time they heard something they would flee, and their commander would scream for them to regroup, for they had lost two soldiers already, and were down to just nine.\n\nEventually, only they and their war equipment remained - no food, no water.\n\nAnd the humans.\n\nFor hours, the Rhons tried to sleep to regain their forces, just to be woken up by some bomb, some shooting, some flame burning their camp. They tried to flee to an isolated place, quietly at first, to think about an strategy, but as soon as they started to discuss anything, gunshots, bombs, things would happen to disturb their peace and to make sure they would not rest a single bit.\n\nMultiple times they pinpointed where the bombs came, where the humans were hiding, to attack, but the only thing waiting for them were traps, grenades, smoke curtains and gunshots. Two more Rhons died on five of these useless crusades, and after more than forty hours, no sleep, no peace, close to no communication (for every time they tried to talk, stun grenades would drop closely, blinding and deafening everybody), they started to gesticulate, to run, and scream.\n\nThey tried every language they could - even some human ones - always with the same message.\n\n*We surrender*\n\nUnfortunately, nobody saw or heard their pleas - the sounds of war were louder, the flames were brighter, and their hiding places were in flames, together with their clothes, their equipment.\n\nStill, they survived. Somehow, they escaped - but any hint of organization between them was gone forever.\n\nTwo ended up things by themselves - their breathing was voluntary, so they simply stopped breathing.\n\nTheir general was screaming orders, but nobody could understand him - for he was so out of himself that whatever words escaped his lips were just gibberish, and his movements were erratic.\n\nUntil he was gone. Fell into a concealed hole in the ground, ignited until all liquid in his body evaporated.\n\nEven more panic ensured, and the humans knew how to use it.\n\nAnd use it, they did. Two fell into a river, and were promptly tied and weighted, drowning on the unforgiving waters; four eventually fell victim to the bullets, from snipers hitting their eyes when in panic they ran in open fields; one got his leg trapped and, so weak he was, could not free himself, and died from another bullet.\n\nOnly one was left - and he had his back against a huge mountain.\n\nIn front of him, nine humans appeared.\n\nThey had absolutely no hint of fatigue. Honestly, they didn't even appear *tired* \\- like the whole  event started ten minutes ago, and not more than forty-five hours. Even *their clothes,* while completely dirty, appeared intact.\n\nA single soldier took a step, pointed her gun.\n\nAnd the Rhon fell. He was gone.\n\nHer lips simply said \"Bang\". No bullet flew from her gun. No vital fluid escaped the enemy. His brain just turned off, and his breathing stopped.\n\n*But the true terror was still to come.*  \n\\---  \nPer rules of the event, winners had access to the best medics in the galaxy, to treat their wounds.\n\nFrom the nine remaining solders, one had a new, organic, arm made for him; three had multiple fractures on their ribs; two with punctures at their lungs; five had some kind of member fracture - one had to get a full new femur engineered for her; and finally two had lost an eye.\n\nHow did the humans were able to keep fighting *in these conditions* and still win?\n\nAnd finally... how could they still summon the strength to laugh, and to sing, after fighting for so many hours against the greatest warriors of all? Like the whole thing was a walk in the park?\n\nFrom that day forward, in every intergalactic reunion, in decision making, humans would look at the aliens in the eye - no matter how smaller they were, how flimsy they looked.\n\nAnd the aliens would look away."

I just wanted my five minutes of fame... I never though the thing would work, or even that no superhero would appear and stop me.\n\nReality is really different from the movies... nobody came. Nobody listened to me. I pressed the button... and reality warped. Things exploded. Gravity reversed multiple times.

I always do\n\nAnd I will keep feeling that, forever, till the day I die.\n\nI ask for forgiveness, again. As I always do. And the voice mocks me, as they always do.\n\nThen comes the chorus, the cacophony of voices, all demanding things. All seven billion people I killed, and maybe twelve billion people that would be born.\n\nThey all demand, and I can't give. Not anymore.\n\nI close the door, lie down at my bed. Pull out the covers, fetal position, like always.\n\nHidden from the voices, I drift to sleep. Like I always do.\n\nI dream of a world that's still alive. Like I always do. A world where I don't matter, where I'm just a nameless person in the crowd, a nobody going to a boring job, waiting for Friday to drink my worries away, to end up home wasted, to complain about my job.\n\nWhat was hell for me in the past, now seems like the paradise. The prime of my life. Dreaming, the voices go away, and I am lost in the busy streets of my home, drinking the bad coffee from the bakery, rapidly eating my lunch, without time to taste anything. A true paradise where others still exist, and I am just another one, uninteresting, anonymous.\n\nAnd then, I wake up again... to the same deafening silence.\n\nUntil next night."

None of the things they did would ever work if it where on Earth, for some reason.\n\nAnd they left me. In a farm field. \n\nBut before they went, they dressed me in the most ridicule outfit they could, complete with teared fabric and a weird backpack full of weird food, and then they went away.\n\nI didn't have to walk too much to find a friend. He asked me who I was, and how did I got there. He was friendly, but being someone dressed as a madman in his property wasn't really the best first impression I could offer.

That all their technology was based on a special type of paper and origami, and depending on how you fold the paper it would become a different machine? That in fact, their starship was just some folded paper inside a bathtub?\n\nThat they had flying machines in the form of our Japanese \"Tsuru\"?\n\n*Of course* I would not tell anyone. And they **knew it**. They knew their technology would be dismissed as the talks of a madman. That's why they taught me how to do most things. That's how I worked basically as a medical assistant, and by gosh, I was **good** at it - they **made sure** I was going to be one of the best.\n\nAll because... they knew I could not replicate the results on Earth. Too few suns, too many moons and electromagnetic interference. They knew all of this, and they knew that as soon as I was well versed in their technology, I could never think on Earth's one ever again.\n\nAnd I was *so close* of building up the first inter-stellar starship...\n\n... and they *also knew* that..."

Fragments of armor, flesh, and weapons flew through the air, painting the sky red, putrid smell assaulting the soldiers, that turned out to run, panicking.\n\nMy father just shot three more, not fatally. The wounded cries and pleas for mercy were more than sufficient to make others surrender on the spot, turn out their weapons, or simply run away, crying like little boys they were.\n\nWe found out by interrogating the prisoners: the war. The experiments. The new soldiers, the new order, the new chaos, the new government, and how everybody lost everything. They told stories about mercenaries, and immortals, and super-intelligent computers that could predict anything.\n\nAnd how we, being so \"outside of society\", were a risk for the computer. They couldn't understand our ways, predict our actions.\n\nThey could not control us. Because we were not part of the pack.\n\nWars were now quick - the ones with better weapons would win in an instant, vaporizing everybody in seconds. The weapons took a long time to charge, but they were quick and effective, and could shot three times, although usually one was enough.\n\nEvery nano-element was fine-tuned to resist these new super-weapons, so they had basically no protection against good ol' gunpowder. We didn't know that, of course; we also didn't know that this whole \"vaporizing enemies\" was actually literal - people disappearing on the spot where in less than a second.\n\nThat's why they were scarred and flew from us - our weapons were \"cruel\", and we forced them to see what we really are - and what *they* really are - just humans.\n\nOr maybe not.\n\nThe more they talked, the more we felt we were the last \"real humans\" on the planet. They talked crazy stuff about no free-will or privacy or desires - the \"Corporation\", how they called their new Empire, decided on what people would desire, want, and buy. Fine-tuned propaganda, subliminal messages fine-tuned for specific people and population to keep the status quo.\n\nIt didn't help that most humans were genetic-engineered now to have immunity to most diseases, and that food was grown in such a way to keep the perfect balanced diet and still taste like chocolate. Sure, there were some undocumented side-effects, like being more susceptible to the messages and to obey orders... but who would care? Humanity was better than ever, and for sure they just had to won *this last war* and then everything would be fine...\n\nAn ex-soldier begged us to take him with us. To escape that horrible world, to a simpler time, where humans were humans and wars were unheard of. We left the others tied to our house, and left with the begging one.\n\nPacked lightly, but with our close guns ready, we walked. Through the valley, to the river. We ate, and we talked, and we explained things.\n\nAlways aware. Always looking for something we knew was going to appear.\n\nAnd appear, it did. Unfortunately for the beggar, I saw that.\n\nHe was as dead as he was smiling, a moment earlier. Dad knew it was a trap. Of course, I knew it too - but that would distract the others.\n\nFor this was not our route. Our was a secret one, away from prying eyes. One that only we knew, deep down in the forest, for those who still knew which animals to greet, and which to avoid.\n\nOne full of traps that only the trained eye could see. Our trained eyes.\n\nSo we marched, without resting, to a new tomorrow, hearing the cries of whatever humanity became dying around us, victim of us, victim of themselves, succumbed to fear.\n\nWe still marched, for another centuries of exile. We marched, to hide, so that one day, humanity could flourish again - from tradition, farming, brass, and gunpowder."

Who knows? I intend to come clear with her anyway, and then... whatever she decides, it's fine for me. I honestly don't even know if I care, anymore.\n\nYou see, betrayal does that with you. We were supposed to be on these \"arks\". Me, from an organization that nobody ever heard about. I found out they intended to abandon me months before they gave me the notice.\n\nI think I did a good job. I cried, and I pleaded, and I cried again, and I tried to hug their feet, got kicked, bruised, screamed, tried to attack... they almost shot me, and I was thrown on the streets - literally - while they laughed at my misery.\n\nOf course, it was all an act. They are now sleeping in one of the Arks, the last one to take off. The ship is still visible in the air when it explodes in a million pieces.\n\nThe other arks will follow, but much, much later. I need the despair of the people. Maybe then, and only then, we can separate the ones that really want to live, from the ones that are using everything as a reason to kill each other. Humanity have this fetish, honestly - we all want a Zombie Apocalypse, a Silent Hill scenario, or even someone trespassing our property, just so we can make-believe we're a hero - it's just a sad excuse to be able to kill others and feel no remorse and no judgment.\n\nSo yeah... the planet is fine. Nothing really is happening with it. It was all fabricated...\n\n... by me. When I found out about the Ark project, and I knew I was going to be forced to work on it, and I knew they were going to betray me. Corporate bullshit for too much times gives a person the insight to know these things.\n\nThat's how I knew about the inner workings of the engines, and how to apply the right force to pass the tests, the security ones, and everything, and still explode on take-off (two of them), on flight (one of them - I wanted the ones that betrayed me to have the worst experience, so I made sure that they will not die on the explosion - they will be burned alive by our atmosphere), will course-correct into Jupiter and Saturn, will land on Titan (hope they have very warm clothes!) and the others... well, the cryo-hibernation doesn't really work correctly, honestly. The engine doesn't have enough power to keep the right temperature, so they will have a very weird case of hypothermia where they die because their body got \"too warm\". Funny how this stuff works.\n\nNow, I hear sobbing. It appears my daughter found out who's the responsible for all of that...\n\n... time to have that talk..."

        "writing_prompt": "In the aftermath of the war, the king had no choice but to surrender unconditionally. at the peace summit, the victors handed the king a shovel. \"You started this war. You will bury those who died in it.\"",
        "story": "This was absurd. He did start the war, but that's because others wanted to enslave his people! Yes, he drafted the first soldiers, but the next ones were all volunteers! Did his captors could not see that? Did they think he didn't know the name of each, and every one, of the soldiers drafted for the war?\n\nSo it came to light.\n\nThey underestimated him. His kingdom lost the battle. And the war.\n\nBut the king, himself, still had the battle in him. It was time for the last draft. The last soldier.\n\nAt the morning and afternoon, the king would dig holes, find soldiers. He would appear indifferent to his captors, like he never repented, but he remembered. \n\nEvery. Single. Soldier.\n\nBy name.\n\nSo he kept digging, finding new ways, optimizing, mentally preparing. Thinking, applying, failing, trying again. He only needed a chance, so he would build his muscles, digging in the worst possible way just to force his arms to be stronger. Hear the laughs of the guards, just to build strength against psychological attacks. Force to look at the captured people from his old kingdom, the women forced into unspeakable acts, just to fuel his anger.\n\nHe would become a demon, if needed. Only to save his people. He would sell his body, his soul, if that would bring peace to others.\n\nAnd indeed, something... something happened. Some old force, deity, god... whatever it was, the king awakened it. Somehow, he knew.\n\nHe would dig, forcefully, against stone, hearing again the laughs of the soldiers. Then slowly, and slowly, as if he was becoming weaker and tired.\n\nBecause that's how you sharpen your tools.\n\nOne day, he fell. Tired, on his knees, the soldiers decided it was time to have some fun.\n\nThe first one never understood what happened. The second one lost his head - literally - for the shovel was now sharper than a sword. The third one tried to parry, but the king was faster.\n\nThat was the first day of the revolution. Old slaves had their chains cut, and became helpers, or fighters. New slaves were freed, and new fighters became, and what was a group of crazy peasants became a deadly army; their eyes burning with fire and revenge, their voices sore from singing war songs, their will unbeatable even under the heaviest situations.\n\nCities were burnt. Thousands had died. It would not mater in the end, when they were victorious, for history is written by the winners. Soldiers were converted, for the deadly army became so dangerous that only a fool would still underestimate the king.\n\nAnd the old war, started so many years before, was finally over; a new kingdom made, international pacts signed so that the new country could be recognized, alliances were forged over trade routes and favors, so that nobody would be enslaved again, no king would be forced to dig graves for the lucky ones that died, instead of the tortured ones kept alive by corrupt nations.\n\nFinally, the king dug his last grave. It was deep, big, and had a name on it. He was, quite honestly, very proud of it, especially because he did it with his old shovel, the first weapon he used when he was the last soldier on this long, painful, and unforgiving war.\n\nInstead of a gravestone, he stuck the shovel on the dirt. It stood like a tree, and again, he was very proud of it.\n\nIt was finally the time for him to rest."
