        "writing_prompt": "\"First of all, vampires are not real, don't be stupid.  We are werebats. Second, yes, we do feed on fruit. Why did you think we set up shop in an orchard instead of an abbatoir or close to normal humans ?\"",
        "story": "William had invaded the orchard with one goal in mind. He would take down the evil vampires that ruled this humble land, and then, when they were defeated, he would drink down their cider to celebrate. He had spent weeks planning this invasion, dressing himself in the finest gear he could find in his mother\u2019s kitchen, ready to face down the biggest threat that he knew of.\n\nWith a confident stride, he moved along the orchard, weaving through the trees like some 1950s movie thief. He even did the high knee raises, like he was about to turn to an invisible camera and shush the audience. This action, however, didn\u2019t help his attempts at stealth. The saucepans he had tapped to his knees clanking as he raised his legs, alerting the werebats of his arrival.\n\n\u201cWhat was that noise?\u201d Eric groaned, shifting in his rocking chair. The man pushing the chair all the way back, trying to get himself into a better position. Once the rocking chair bumped against the wall, he twisted his neck and gazed out of the cottage window. Eric\u2019s ear canals contracting as he sent out a signal, waiting for his echolocation to pick something up. When the wave returned, he rolled his eyes. \u201cA bloody human.\u201d\n\nSasha, Eric\u2019s wife, laughed. \u201cA bloody human.\u201d She mocked. \u201cThose bloody humans pay for our orchard. They probably thought they had a tour scheduled today. I\u2019ll turn them around.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you. I don\u2019t even dislike humans, it\u2019s just we only get one day off a week. It would be nice to not have to deal with them every day of every week. It\u2019s like I\u2019m a puppet that dances for their amusement.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a puppet dear, I\u2019ve had you dancing from my strings since our first date. I didn\u2019t think someone could say the words I love you on a first date. Was I that much of a catch?\u201d She laughed, her fangs peeking out of her gums as she amused herself.\n\n\u201cAh, that reminds me. Can you stop telling everyone we meet that story? It\u2019s getting. Wait, what\u2019s that blinding light? Ow.\u201d William winced, noticing a shining figure approaching their window. William\u2019s kitchen appliance armor catching the sun\u2019s rays, creating a blinding shield.\n\n\u201cHeh, they\u2019ll never see me coming.\u201d William said, as the microwave he had strapped to his stomach landed on his foot, causing him to howl. \u201cDAMN IT. Ow, my foot. Oh, no. Mom\u2019s going to kill me. It\u2019s still good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d William crouched, wiping the grass off it. \u201cStill good.\u201d He hastily re-strapped the microwave, adding another layer of duct tape before continuing his stealthy approach.\n\n\u201cOof, that looked painful. I should see if he wants a cider. That always numbs my pains. Did you know our cider is locally sourced? It also only contains natural sugars unlike,\u201d\n\n\u201cSweetie, you\u2019re doing your customer voice again.\u201d Eric said, getting out of his rocking chair.\n\n\u201cOh, sorry. Force of habit.\u201d\n\nBy the time William made it to the window, he was a panting mess. Williams\u2019 face bright red as he blew out heavy huffs of air, tired from carrying a whole kitchen\u2019s worth of gadgets. He gripped his knees, hunched over, before getting himself upright, only to find the two vampires staring at him from the window.\n\n\u201cCan we help you?\u201d Eric asked.\n\n\\n\\n\u201cTHE POWER OF GOD COMPELS YOU FOUL BEAST.\u201d Wiliam squealed, holding a fork up to the vampires, leaving his cross at home.\n\nSasha laughed. \u201cAww, that\u2019s cute. It\u2019s like the thing they do in all of those horror movies. Wait, wait. I have the perfect thing for this. I just need some whipped cream.\u201d Sasha rushed off, leaving William and Eric awkwardly staring at one another.\n\n\u201cSo, which god compels me?\u201d Eric asked, making small talk.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said the power of god compels me. Which one?\u201d\n\n\u201cUm. Which one will melt your skin off?\u201d William asked, lowering his fork, happy to take advice from the man he wanted to turn to dust.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, ok.\u201d The two awkwardly waiting for Sasha to return and thankfully she was quick.\n\n\u201cOk, ok. Do it again.\u201d She said, holding something behind her back.\n\n\u201cOk, give me a second.\u201d William cleared his throat. \u201cTHE POWER OF YOUR CHOSEN GOD COMPELS YOU FOUL BEAST!\u201d\n\n\u201cNOOOOOO.\u201d Sasha squealed, as a loud hiss left the can of whipped cream she had hidden in her hand. She sprayed it into her mouth, pretending it was frothing, before collapsing onto the floor, splaying her body out like a starfish. \u201cBleh.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt worked?\u201d William said in disbelief.\n\nEric squinted at him, looking between his obviously very alive wife and William. \u201cWhat about that made you think it worked? You saw the whipped cream. You\u2019re messing with me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cMom raised me to be optimistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe raised an idiot.\u201d\n\n\u201cERIC.\u201d Sasha shouted. \u201cHe\u2019s a guest.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to kill us.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you honestly think he\u2019s a threat? He\u2019s got more kitchen utensils strapped to him than we have in our kitchen. Be a little nicer.\u201d Sasha licked the last droplets of whipped cream off her lips before dusting off her brown shorts, returning to her feet. \u201cNow, why do you want us dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour vampires.\u201d\n\n\u201cVampires aren\u2019t real, you idiot. We\u2019re werebats. It\u2019s a rare disease that gives people the abilities of a bat. So, yes. We can turn into bats and we eat fruit, but we aren\u2019t blood sucking monsters. If we were blood suckers, wouldn\u2019t we have set up an abattoir or lived closer to humans? Yes, we do tours, but if you look at our reviews, you will clearly see we aren\u2019t killing anyone.\u201d\n\nWilliam didn\u2019t know what an abattoir was, but he didn\u2019t want to seem stupid by mentioning that, so he moved past it. \u201cWerebats? Like Batman?\u201d\n\nEric had to think about that. \u201cDo you mean like the character or as in Manbat? Nevermind, you obviously mean the character. Look, as respected orchard owners, we kindly ask you to leave our property.\u201d Eric gestured towards the fence William had climbed over to get in, trying to shoo him out.\n\n\u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not luring people here to eat them? Everyone that comes here always raves about it, like they're under a spell. Vampires put people into trances.\u201d\n\nBoth Eric and Sasha couldn\u2019t hide their looks of pride when William talked about their rave reviews. They had spent years getting this orchard perfect and to hear their hard work was paying off easily made this petty annoyance worth it.\n\n\u201cPeople really like our orchard that much? What do they like? Please tell me people love our new peach and apple cider mix. We worked all summer to get that recipe right. Oh, what about the pies? It\u2019s Eric\u2019s grandmother\u2019s recipe. You see, all you have to do is pick the juiciest apple and take it into the kitchen. Oh, I\u2019m in customer mode again, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are,\u201d Eric said, giving her a kiss on the cheek. \u201cBut I love that about you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re really not harmful? Aww, I was going to use this as my chance to become a big hero. Great, this sucks. Now I\u2019m back to being unemployed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think hunting imaginary monsters counts as being employed.\u201d Eric said.\n\nSasha pouted, frustrated by her husband\u2019s lack of tact. \u201cERIC! Don\u2019t kick the poor guy when he\u2019s down.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, it\u2019s true though.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have any other talents?\u201d Sasha offered, patting William\u2019s back.\n\nWilliam exhaled, getting out his phone. Well, he tried to get out his phone, having to push aside the random spoons he had in his pocket until he found it. \u201cNot really. I put all my effort into monster hunting.\u201d\n\nWilliam showed them a small trailer he had created. It started with beautiful scenic shots of the orchard, taken either from a drone or by someone climbing the trees in the orchard. While the orchard footage rolled, a voiceover played. A powerful, commanding voice going over the dangers that lurked inside the orchard, talking about old vampiric tales and the dangers that William faced. The cinematography outstanding. When the minute long trailer ended, both Eric and Sasha were in awe.\n\n\u201cWow, that makes me want to hunt myself.\u201d Sasha admitted, getting goosebumps.\n\n\u201cWhy mess around with monster hunting when you can do stuff like that? People pay good money for that sort of stuff. It\u2019s great publicity.\u201d Eric explained.\n\nWilliam sighed, slipping his phone into his pocket. \u201cReally? I just put that together for the YouTube video. I didn\u2019t think it was that impressive, just something that would get the viewers\u2019 attention until they saw our epic battle. Um, anyway, sorry about stomping through your orchards. I\u2019ll get going. If you see any zombies or aliens, can you let me know? My channel name is Twerk-da-dead-232. You can message me there.\u201d\n\nEric and Sasha looked at one another. Sasha smiled, letting her husband know she had an idea. Eric shook his head, only for Sasha to raise her hand, as if she were twisting puppet strings. After that display, Eric slumped his shoulders, allowing her to go through with her plan.\n\n\u201cHalloweens coming up and a lot of the other orchards are doing a spooky monster night. Would you want to help us set up an event? We don\u2019t usually do a Halloween night, but it could help us boost our sales. All you need to do is put together a video package for us and help us decorate the area. With your knowledge of monsters, I\u2019m sure it will turn out great.\u201d\n\nWiliam paused. \u201cYou want my help?\u201d\n\nSasha nudged Eric\u2019s side, and he spoke. \u201cWell, we do see slower sales during Halloween. Since people are attending Halloween parties and events. So, it would help us during that quiet period.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that would be great. Actually, I made some props to use in my vampire video. I\u2019ll bring them over tomorrow and we can go over everything. This is going to be great. I\u2019m thinking of a full vampire cider tour. A lot of red fruits and drinks, mixed with some spooky decorations. Ok, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d Eric tried to do an excited run, only to get held down by his armor. After that failed attempt at running, he hobbled to his car, excited about his first day of work tomorrow.\n\nEric smirked, crossing his arms. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even ask how much we were paying him. What a strange guy. It\u2019s strange. I\u2019ve actually got a good feeling about this.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too. Even if the Halloween events a bust, I wouldn\u2019t mind getting him to do a video package for our orchard. We haven\u2019t updated our photos and social media in a few months.\u201d She said, closing the window, making sure no one else came knocking after Eric left.\n\n"

        "writing_prompt": "\u201cIt is one man, by himself, in a castle on a hill. How does an ENTIRE ARMY fail to take it???\u201d",
        "story": "\u201cComplications arose during the march, sir. While it is merely a castle on the hill. One that is barely a breadcrumb compared to your grand castle and balcony. It is still a steep hill to climb.\u201d Marcus said, kneeling with his clenched fist pushed against his chest plate. The flame emblem of the Revilion Empire resting beneath his fist, as if he was trying to extinguish it with his hand.\n\n \n\nKing Salas peered at the castle, having to squint to make out its inferior walls and grace. Unlike his castle that loomed over the city like a stone dragon, the castle of Lord Grethon sat high above it like a Gray Catbird, curiously watching the dragon from a safe perching branch. Though, that safe hill now had soldiers ascending it, like hungry cats climbing up to snatch the prey that remained up above.\n\n \n\n\u201cComplications? Explain.\u201d Salas didn\u2019t turn to face his commanding knight, too busy staring at the eyesore that silently mocked him. The king\u2019s wrinkly hand running through his gray beard, trying to untangle some hairs that had intertwined.\n\n \n\nMarcus didn\u2019t stand. Even if the king refused to look his way, he didn\u2019t move. Not wanting to risk facing the man\u2019s wrath. \u201cThe horses got spooked. The height caused a few of them to panic, sending the others into a frenzy. We also had issues trying to find the perfect point to ascend from. We feared the pathways Lord-\u201c\n\n \n\n\u201cHe is no lord anymore.\u201d The king interjected, his hoarse voice having a not-so-subtle hint of frustration as he listened to his knight.\n\n \n\n\u201cAh, how right you are, my grace. We feared the pathways that traitor Grethon created would be occupied by his treacherous knights that used to serve under your command. To avoid a disadvantage in battle, we explored alternative routes.\u201d\n\n \n\nThe king turned, acknowledging his knight for the first time since he had knelt. The kings worn white robes now having splotches of dirt and grime, not the former pure white they once were. \u201cIf I don\u2019t hear any good news, Marcus. Then I\u2019ll be forced to suspect you of sabotaging the mission. These are mistakes a new commander would make, not a seasoned one. Where is my good news, Marcus?\u201d The king didn\u2019t need to threaten Marcus directly, making it obvious what would happen if he didn\u2019t hear something positive soon.\n\n \n\nMarcus tensed, staring at the king\u2019s feet. \u201cGrethon is alone. He has not fled the castle and the soldiers in his command have thrown down their arms and agreed to rejoin our army. We have him surrounded. His death will come shortly.\u201d\n\n \n\nSalas smirked, those dry lips at risk of chipping as he performed the action for the first time in years. \u201cVery well. We shall have his head soon, then?\u201d Salas asked, turning back to his window.\n\n\u201cA day or two, depending on how long it takes our men to return. Should I execute him before our men bring him into the city? Have his dead body paraded through the streets on his return?\u201d Marcus offered, knowing the king would never accept the proposition. Not when the sweet allure of a more personal revenge was available. \n\n \n\nSalas entertained the thought of making a spectacle out of this, only to shake his head. \u201cHis death will come at my hand. The other lords need to know what happens when you steal from the king. The people pay to live on my land. How dare he try to undermine my rule?\u201d\n\n \n\nMarcus closed his eyes, giving a nod of approval. \u201cThe other lords will fall in line, sir. They know better than to question your might. May I leave my king? Preparations are needed for Grethon\u2019s arrival.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYes, go ahead. Leave and don\u2019t return until you have Grethon with you. I want you to help me with the arrangements before his execution. We won\u2019t make it quick for him.\u201d Salas chuckled, the dry laugh coming out as if he were spitting out clumps of dust.\n\n \n\nMarcus took his leave, wondering when the king had become like this. Had Salas always been this wicked, and he never noticed because of his loyalty? Or had the king\u2019s heart changed after the death of the queen? He hoped it was the first, not wanting to feel any sympathy for the man they planned to kill.\n\n \n\nEveryone knew Grethon had committed no actual crime. He had paid the king his gold in full. But he had done so with money from his own pockets. The struggles of the last winter had been harsh on the farming lands below Grethon\u2019s hill, and since the people he looked over couldn\u2019t afford to pay the taxes, Grethon covered the expenses. Telling them to pay what they could during this harsh period and he would make up the rest.\n\nA selfless act that the king took offense to. The king saw this as teaching bad manners, similar to a parent covering for a child\u2019s mistakes, forcing bad habits. What would happen if other commoners started expecting the same from their lords? It would be chaos. When Marcus first came to Salas and told him the commoners in his city were asking for lower taxes during this troubling time, he knew he had to make an example out of Grethon.\n\nThough, what he didn\u2019t expect was the other lords to conspire against him. The king was old, weak, and showing signs of taking the kingdom to the grave with him. Today it would be Grethon and the next it would be them. Which is why they planned to kill the king, using the distraction of Grethon to mount their attack.\n\n \n\nThat was why Grethon\u2019s men surrendered so quickly. That day wasted with supposed spooked horses was a day filled with scheming and negotiations. When they formulated their plan, Grethons\u2019 men joined the army and left their lord alone, allowing him to be taken.\n\n \n\nNow, the king waits for his revenge, not knowing in reality, he was waiting for his death. The small dots that occupied the hill weren\u2019t his men anymore. They were a collective of disgruntled knights that understood the future of the kingdom. Those who were still loyal to the king either taken as prisoner until the king had been dealt with or removed of entirely.\n\n \n\nTwo more days, the king had to rule his kingdom.\n\n \n\nTwo more days until Grethon arrived.\n\n"

        "story": "\u201cAre you saying you want to milk us?\u201d Angus asked. The question creating an awkward silence, as the vampire tried to figure out a proper reaction to that comment. One that summed up the absolute disgust and revulsion he felt.\n\n \n\nHerald\u2019s face scrunched up, eyes tightening in an act that made it look like his eyelids were trying to suffocate his eyeballs. As he made that expression, his tongue slipped out, making a perfect bleh expression before his features returned to normal. \u201cNo, I do not want to milk humankind. I wish to feast on your blood. That involves no milking.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it kind of milking? Sure, we aren\u2019t cows or anything, but you\u2019re still milking the blood from our bodies.\u201d He remarked, again deeply disturbing the vampire.\n\n \n\n\u201cDRINKING the blood. There is a difference. Do you milk an orange when you make juice?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cI get my juice from the store.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re misunderstanding my point.\u201d Herald had met many strange vampire hunters over the years. From one who claimed to be a demon, to another who wore jester makeup and honked before every deadly blow. Now, even those seemed tame when compared to the man he had encountered on his way to the blood bank. The hunter waiting in the underground parking lot for him, blocking the back entrance to the blood reserves.\n\n \n\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re misunderstanding your own point. Although, if you\u2019re only milking humans, I guess there\u2019s no reason to fight you. I\u2019m more after the vampires that kill people. You know, the ones that go I want to suck your blood.\u201d Angus stretched his arms out forward, taking a Frankenstein pose as he made that comment. Even giving a Halloween themed Bleh after saying it.\n\n \n\nHerald would have been offended by that if he hadn\u2019t gone through a \u2018I want to suck your blood\u2019 phase in the 1600s. A time when such a thing was considered cool among the vampire community. Now it seemed old-fashioned. Something that was reserved only for cheap fiction. Even if he wanted to feign offense, he had bigger issues, like the constant use of the word milking.\n\n \n\n\u201cI\u2019m drinking their blood. How hard is that to get into your skull? Slurping, sipping and feasting.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cRight, if you say so. Have a nice day.\u201d Angus slipped his holy water laced dagger into its sheath, turning to leave, only to see a black shadow swoop in front of him, blocking his path. From the shadow, Herald emerged. The skinny, six-foot five vampire lurching over him, with his pale eyes staring down at the human.\n\n  \n\u201cSay I\u2019m drinking blood.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re drinking blood, whatever.\u201d Angus said, giving a cheeky smile before again turning to leave. The shadow moved again, blocking his step once more.\n\n \n\n\u201cMean it.\u201d Herald\u2019s tone growing agitated, not accepting that for a response.\n\n \n\n\u201cIf you think it\u2019s drinking blood, then it is. Who am I to tell a vampire that his terms might be outdated? You were born in a different era. It\u2019s ok.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cAre you suggesting people now refer to it as milking? That\u2019s disgusting, sickening and repulsive. Maybe I should harvest you like cattle. Keep you all in a freezer until you can learn the difference between milking and drinking.\u201d When Herald\u2019s fangs poked out from his upper lips, that\u2019s when Angus knew he had to take his foot off the gas. Not wanting to turn this into a fight.\n\n \n\nHe opened his palms and dragged them towards the floor, wordlessly telling Herald to settle. When the vampire\u2019s fangs started retracting, Angus spoke. \u201cPeople use a ton of terms that even I don\u2019t understand. Some might even claim one of us is rizzing the other. I think? Honestly, Rizz is lost on me. What I\u2019m saying is, terms are getting confusing. Maybe people would call it milking now?\u201d\n\n \n\nHerald stood there dumbfounded, struggling to follow the conversation. Never in his life had he met a vampire hunter that was this perplexing. The human had put him into such a confused state that his cold, lifeless body was noticing the cool morning breeze blowing through the cracks in the underground parking lot. Finding It\u2019s way to the vampire through the shoddy construction.\n\n \n\n\u201cHuman speech is perplexing.\u201d Herald relented.\n\n \n\n\u201cIt is. I\u2019ve got a niece and some of the things she says confuses the hell out of me. I remember everyone saying kool back in my day. Now it\u2019s all Skibidi\u2019s and stuff. When\u2019s the last time someone wrote a word with numbers?\u201d Angus noticed the vampire didn\u2019t seem to relate to that, so he tried a different approach. \u201cWhat about the beautiful old English? How lost is that?\u201d\n\n \n\nThe vampire longingly gazed towards the ceiling of the carpark, sighing. \u201cHow lost she is. Such a beautiful way of speaking. You won\u2019t find class like that anymore.\u201d He agreed before letting out another sigh. \u201cI think you\u2019ve turned me off my dinner with all that milking talk. I\u2019ll come back tomorrow. You don\u2019t have any problems with that, do you?\u201d\n\n \nAngus wondered how far he could push this. Ideally, two days would be best, but one day was also more than he expected. \u201cHow about two days? They get fresh blood in on Wednesdays. That has to taste better, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cI do hate the cold taste one gets from a refrigerated bag of blood. Two days would be manageable.\u201d Herald vanished into a cloud of smoke, only to reemerge a second later, after making a realization. \u201cHunter. This milking business. That was your way of turning me off my dinner, was it not?\u201d Angus\u2019s pale eyes pivoting into a menacing red.\n\n \n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t say.\u201d Angus smiled, not meeting the gaze of the vampire, who was now deeply invading his personal space.\n\n \n\n\u201cDoes this have to do with the bus full of tourists that crashed earlier? Is that why you\u2019re hanging around a blood bank at night?\u201d When Angus didn\u2019t answer, the vampire smiled. \u201cI see. If you had just explained the situation, I would have left. You didn\u2019t need to sicken me. If the humans need the blood more than I do, they can have it. Fewer humans means less food for me.\u201d\n\n \n\nAngus took a relieved breath, holding his chest. \u201cPhew. I was worried you were going to fight me or something. You caught me. It\u2019s funny, you\u2019re the first vampire that\u2019s caught onto my deception. You\u2019re a clever one.\u201d Angus lied, that subtle last minute glance away being noticed by the vampire now that he wasn\u2019t flustered.\n\n \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a bold liar, human. Not a bad one either. Few can deceive a vampire, even for a short time.\u201d There was a glimmer of respect from the vampire, a small smirk that showed the human had impressed him. \u201cGood luck, Hunter. Hopefully, those humans recover. I also hope we are never to meet in battle. I fear you\u2019re stronger than you let on.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYou would easily win.\u201d\n\n \n\nHerald laughed, watching the slight smirk on Angus\u2019s lips when he said that. \u201cAnother lie. Goodnight, Mr. Hunter.\u201d He said, leaving Angus to his duties.\n\n"

        "story": "\u201cUtterly beautiful.\u201d A soft voice whispered, watching Dan spill more useless clutter onto his kitchen counter. Dan always subscribed to the philosophy of \u2018I\u2019ll clean it up when the mess gets unbearable.\u2019 Underestimating how much of a mess he could tolerate.\n\n \n\nThe counter was no longer visible under the clumps of old newspapers, empty cereal boxes and an unholy amount of milk cartons. Still, Dan didn\u2019t hesitate to add another newspaper to the pile, even as it rolled off the mountain of waste, dropping onto the floor. When he reached down to grab it, he found himself staring at a set of black toenails, not even noticing the grey woman who had been shadowing him since he entered the room.\n\n \n\nInstinctively, he wanted to scream, but the sound got stuck in his throat, causing more of a gagged breath. He remained in his bent position, as if doing so would somehow make the looming presence go away. When it didn\u2019t leave, he moved his head, only for the presence to drop to his level, meeting his gaze.\n\n \n\nCrouched before him was a sickly looking woman. One with pale skin, black wavy hair, and a permanent set of purple tear stains running down her angelic cheeks. Despite her grim appearance, her black lips were curled into a smile, collecting the newspaper and offering it to him. \u201cYou dropped this.\u201d\n\n \n\nNow that scream found its way from his throat, coming out in a cat-like shriek as he snatched the newspaper and rushed back, diving behind his couch for protection. The god, while hurt, understood his shock, cupping her hands in front of her mismatched purple and brown dress, allowing him to freak out.\n\n \n\n\u201cHow did you get in? I\u2019m calling the cops.\u201d Dan sputtered, though when he stood up, he didn\u2019t reach for his phone, confused by her almost divine appearance. She hadn\u2019t moved since he started freaking out, that being enough to give him second thoughts. \u201cIs this a prank? Oh, if you don\u2019t clean up, a ghost will come and haunt you. Did my sister put you up to this? That noisy brat.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cNo one put me up to this. I came to observe my shrine. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cShrine? It\u2019s a pile of trash.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pile of discarded items.\u201d She placed her hands on the counter, trying to find a clean spot. After carefully shifting a milk carton, she found somewhere to rest her hands. \u201cI\u2019m Obosa, the goddess of the lost or discarded.\u201d\n\n \n\nDan laughed, unable to believe his sister would go this far to prove a point. \u201cYou can cut the crap. A goddess? I get it, my house is a mess. I\u2019ll clean it up, just tell my sister she proved her point. God, she\u2019s just like her mother.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cHer mother?\u201d The goddess said, even if she knew about the human\u2019s grief, she didn\u2019t want to pry, not unless he mentioned it.\n\n\u201cWell, my mother too. Look, you wouldn\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cI\u2019m the goddess of lost and discarded items. Not to sound rude, but I believe I would understand the pain of loss.\u201d She had hoped that didn\u2019t across as rude as it sounded in her head, unable to hide her own frustrations. She had a lot of patience, but having her godly specialty questioned wore down even her patience.\n\n \n\nDan again laughed, this time more condescendingly. He moved over to his shrine and gave it a shove, disrupting the perfectly stacked row of cereal boxes. \u201cOops, ruined the shrine. Now you can leave.\u201d When Obosa merely gave him a pitying look, he exhaled. \u201cWhat would a god even know about loss? You can\u2019t lose anything, your gods.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d Obosa said, clenching the counter. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for prying. I only wanted to help you. It\u2019s rare I get to actually help people.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there a bunch of lost people? Surely you can help one of them.\u201d Dan hissed, getting frustrated with himself for even entertaining the idea of this woman being a goddess. \u201cGo help someone else.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d She shouted, raising her voice in an act that shocked even her. Quickly, she lowered her voice as she continued. \u201cI can only help those who know they're lost. Even in those cases, it\u2019s hard for me to appear without a strong link or shrine. This shrine here allowed me to visit you.\u201d\n\n \n\nDan shook his head, grabbing another milk carton from the fridge. \u201cAlright, cool. Still doesn\u2019t explain how you can understand loss. What? Did you lose your divine horse or something as a kid in an epic tale?\u201d He mocked, sipping from his milk.\n\n \n\nObosa ignored that comment, even if it stung. \u201cNo. I lost my sisters. Gods can\u2019t die, they can only stop existing. We had too many gods, so Athila, the goddess of knowledge, suggested only keeping one descendent from each of the gods. The one who had the most power or influence. My father is a minor god, and as such, our gifts weren\u2019t great. Still, he picked me to be his only remaining child, believing the experience would strengthen my powers of loss. I lost all my family that day, as I\u2019ll never forgive my father for choosing me.\u201d She explained, wiping the tears from her eyes.\n\n \n\nDan didn\u2019t know what to say. If this was an actor hired by his sister, they were destined for greater things than standing in his kitchen. Even if he knew how stupid it sounded, he couldn\u2019t help but believe her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cAs am I. Because I believe my grief created the pain that humanity feels when losing someone. My thousand years of grieving, subjected you all to the pain of loss. Without me, you wouldn\u2019t feel pain when those you lost passed.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t pain healthy?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cIs this healthy?\u201d She asked, gesturing to his kitchen. Before Dan could get defensive, she spoke. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n \n\nDan sat the carton down, rubbing his forehead. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Really. It was a year ago. You need to keep pushing forward. Don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fool me with those words. I\u2019m not going to leave once I hear the lies you tell everyone else. I want the truth. How do you feel? Who did you lose?\u201d\n\nDan choked up, having to take a moment to compose himself. \u201cMy mother. Look, I\u2019m alright. I\u2019ll clean up this mess and everything will be ok.\u201d Like a robot, Dan began pushing aside the waste, trying to find something to throw it into, only to get stopped by Obosa, who held his shoulder.\n\n \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not alright. You\u2019re hurting. I know you know that. It\u2019s ok, you can let it out.\u201d She widened her stance, offering him a hug, only for Dan to busy himself with the mess.\n\n \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to let it out. I\u2019ve cried enough. I need to move past it. That\u2019s what she would want.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYou need to grieve. Properly. You\u2019re hurting yourself by doing this. How do you feel?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cFINE. I FEEL FINE. WHAT? CAN\u2019T YOU UNDERSTAND ENGLISH?\u201d Dan shouted, tossing a cereal box onto the floor. \u201cHOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL? EMPTY. I JUST WANT HER BACK.\u201d Dan\u2019s face growing hot as the salty tears pooled in his eyes. \u201cHow can everyone else move on so easily\u2026\u201d\n\n \n\nShe pulled Dan towards her; the man letting out an ugly cry as he sobbed into the goddess. She rubbed his back, holding him as he let out his grief. \u201cLosing family is the worst pain imaginable. A severed connection that can never be replaced. A loss of shared blood. You will join with her once again, when it is your time.\u201d\n\n \n\nDan couldn\u2019t remember how long he spent crying, only that the sun was down by the time he pulled himself away from the goddess. \u201cThank you.\u201d He said, wiping his eyes.\n\n \n\nObosa found a tissue box beneath the pile of items and plucked a tissue from it to give him. \u201cHere. Dry your tears.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cThank you. I know I\u2019ve been an ass. My sister was right about everything. I just couldn\u2019t stand it. Seeing her happy, it felt wrong. Like she shouldn\u2019t be moving on with her life. I knew I was wrong.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cNow you can move forward.\u201d Obosa smiled, waving her hand as the discarded items floated towards her, getting crushed into a small golden ball. \u201cMay I keep this as a memory? I want to remember helping you. I may not get more chances to help mortals.\u201d She said, feeling the emotional energy radiating from the ball. The feelings of loss, anger and despair all pulsing within.\n\n \n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cThank you. You should also apologize to your sister. I would give anything to have mine back, so please, don\u2019t lose yours.\u201d She said, a sad smiled sitting on her lips as she went to teleport herself back to her realm.\n\n \n\n\u201cWait.\u201d Dan grabbed the edge of her dress, stopping her. \u201cIf you ever need someone to talk to. About your grief. Will you come to me? I want to repay you for helping me.\u201d\n\n \n\nThe goddess paused, her smile becoming more genuine. She took his hand, clasping it within her own. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll come to you.\u201d As a blue light surrounded her, she thought more on the humans offer, and her own feelings of loss. \u201cI think I\u2019ll take you up on that offer someday.\u201d She said, vanishing before his eyes.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;"

        "story": "\u201cThis isn\u2019t right. It shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d I panicked, dashing down the hotel\u2019s hallway, instantly recognizing it from one of my dreams. Unlike the other dreams, which had been vivid and filled with well lived life. This dream had been a rarity. One I passed off as a nightmare.\n\n \n\nMy dash caused me to bump into a cleaner, who fell over their cart, looking at me in horror. \u201cSorry, I thought someone was chasing me. I didn\u2019t mean to bump into you.\u201d I helped them to their feet, glancing over my shoulder as I did so. Of all the hotels, I had to book this one. Those bright orange walls, with painted little stars scattered along them. It was unmistakable. Surely it wasn\u2019t a coincidence. That was too much of a rarity.\n\n \n\n\u201cO-ok?\u201d The cleaner probably thought I was some drugged-up maniac, given the way I was refusing to let go of their hand, my body shaking as I kept my head on a swivel, searching for any sign of them. \u201cI can call the police if you want me to?\u201d They offered.\n\n \n\n\u201cYes, please. Call the police.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll grab my phone from downstairs and I\u2019ll make the call.\u201d They started pushing their cart away, only to stop when I dug my nails into their shoulder.\n\n \n\n\u201cYOU CAN\u2019T LEAVE ME. They could be lurking around any corner.\u201d\n\n \n\nHe winced, trying to pull my hand away, but I only dug in deeper, prepared to burrow through his shoulder if I needed to. \u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d He asked, seeing no one standing behind me. \n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe me. No one would. It\u2019s all so insane.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cMiss, you\u2019re hurting me.\u201d He slapped my hand away and bolted for the stairs, leaving his cart behind. I knew he was still going to call the police, but I doubt they were coming to help me. It didn\u2019t matter. As long as they came, I would be safe.\n\n \n\nFootsteps. A soft, yet noticeable tapping of light feet drifted through the hallway, creeping closer to me. Already? How were they already here? I tried thinking back to that nightmare, struggling to reclaim the memories I had blocked out. Did it go left or right? Where did I get grabbed?\n\n \n\nThe footsteps loomed, now about to turn the corner. I didn\u2019t have time to think, not with them being so close to me. I went for the stairs, my quickening pace being matched by it, hearing a heavier pattering of feet as it charged behind me. If I looked behind me, maybe I could see it? The temptation was there, but I knew I had to resist. As soon as I turned, it was over.\n\nThe white emergency door was like a gateway to heaven, resting my hands on the cool bar as I tried to force it open. After a heavy shove, the metal refused to move. Another shove only rattling it further, until I was throwing my shoulder against the door, desperately trying to break it. \u201cYou locked me in here? With it? I hope you die. You\u2019re going to get me killed. Please, please don\u2019t leave me in here. I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d I begged, and the door remained shut.\n\n \n\nThe footsteps slowed, not running anymore. Against my better judgement, I looked at it. I saw a suited man standing a few feet behind me, still approaching as I watched him. From a distance, he would seem normal. Well kept suit, wide smile with shining white teeth, and a smart seventies hair cut that was fit for a family friendly sitcom. Yet, there was no life beyond those eyes, no soul. He was like a doll, shifting with a limping step.\n\n \n\n\u201cSTAY AWAY FROM ME. PLEASE.\u201d Before I knew it, I was running again, heat pooling in my muscles, feeling the aches shift from the bottoms of my feet, all the way to my thighs, like my leg was only seconds away from popping off.\n\n \n\nWhen I ran, he copied my motions, starting the race again. I didn\u2019t even know where I was running to, trying to bang on people\u2019s doors as I passed them. Though I knew that was useless. In that nightmare, no one ever answered their doors. The chase ended when I arrived at my room, realizing I was going to be caught.\n\n \n\nI turned and felt a hand rest over my face, small grey holes visible within the man\u2019s palm. The more I fought against his palm, the tighter his grip got. A sickening scent reaching my nose, the smell of burnt coal mixed with a strange exotic spice. The scent oozing from the holes, until I couldn\u2019t bear it anymore.\n\n \n\nCold, so cold. The metal pushing against my skin as I remained stuck to the table. Even with no restraints, I couldn\u2019t move. My body not responding to my orders, as if it wasn\u2019t even in control anymore. I could blink, breath and think. Those being the only small luxuries I had.\n\nThe grey creature shuffled throughout the room, inspecting a large monitor that hung from the wall. Their back was wrinkly, filled with more of those strange holes like the ones I had seen on his palm. Whenever it breathed, its skinny form would puff out before the excess air escaped through the holes. When he felt me staring, he approached. Their black, empty eyes focused on me. Without their disguise, I could see them for what they truly were. No fake teeth, no perfect seventies hair. Just a bald, grey alien, with rows of sharp pointed teeth. It made the gesture of smiling before moving to my side.\n\n \n\n\u201cPLEASE. I don\u2019t want to be trapped here. Don\u2019t hurt me. I\u2019ll do whatever you say.\u201d\n\n \n\nIt placed its hand on my forehead, words vibrating through my skull. \u201cYou\u2019re a blessed human. One with a gift to see living lives. We were fortunate to pick up your abilities. Had you not dreamed of me, I would have never known of your existence. You will show us every life that humanity has led. Once we have seen them all, we will return you to your planet. Don\u2019t worry, it will be painless.\u201d It said, closing its palm over my face once more.\n\n"

        "story": "Granny Wheeler grinned as her car rolled up to the border, seeing the armed guards standing at the ready, each one not knowing the devious smuggling operation that was taking place underneath their noises. \u201cLook alive people, we have a minute until we reach the gates. If you want your kids to get their sweets, then you\u2019re going to have to play your parts.\u201d Her wrinkled hands tightening around the steering wheel, as her gaze flicked to the rearview mirror. What she saw in the rearview mirror was Mr. Adams sleeping with his mouth wide open, looking half dead as he drooled onto his shirt.\n\n \n\n\u201cADAM, LOOK ALIVE.\u201d Granny Wheeler shouted, but the man didn\u2019t budge. \u201cAdam? Agatha, can you check his pulse?\u201d\n\n \n\nAgatha placed a finger on his neck, only for the elderly man to sit up in a sputter, slapping at the air. \u201cWhat? What do you want? I was resting my eyes.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWe were checking on you, you old fool. We\u2019re about to reach the border.\u201d Agatha whispered. Agatha was their eyes, being the only member of the team that didn\u2019t have to wear glasses, making her the best lookout a group of pensioners could find.\n\n \n\n\u201cWHAT?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cI SAID. Oh, you dumb old fool.\u201d Agatha clicked her tongue, reaching behind his head, flicking his hearing aide on. \u201cThere. I said, we were checking on you, we\u2019re about to reach the border.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me sooner?\u201d Adams grumbled, sitting upright in his seat, as the car slowed down. As the young man approached their window, the three of them did their best to not look suspicious. Agatha did this by knitting, while Adams whistled an old cowboy tune. The two pretending they were unaware of the illegal amount of kinder surprise eggs they had stashed in the boot of their car.\n\n \n\nThe man leaned against their window, giving the old group a smile. They reminded him of his own grandparents, feeling a rush of nostalgia when he saw them. \u201cEvening miss, just need to check your id\u2019s,\u201d He said, holding out his hand.\n\n \n\nGranny Wheeler knew this was her time to shine. She had to put on that old lady charm. She searched her bag for their licenses, handing them to the man. Just before he could pull away his hand, she dropped a caramel sweet in his palm, smirking. \u201cOops, seems I dropped a caramel in your hand, dear. Why don\u2019t you keep that? A sweet boy deserves a sweet treat.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? Thanks, I haven\u2019t had these since I was a kid. My grandmother used to give them to me all the time. She used to keep them in her bag and whenever I was good, she would give me some. Ah, I could talk about her all day.\u201d He sighed, barely even looking at their licenses, her charm working perfectly.\n\n \n\nMeanwhile, Agitha kept a lookout, peering around for other officers who might check their car. If any of the guards looked in their boot, this would all be over. They would be arrested and sent to jail for the rest of their lives. Well, maybe not for the rest of their lives, but they were rather old. Any sentence could be life at their age, Agatha thought.\n\n \n\nWhen the coast was clear, Agatha gave a nod to Wheeler, who nodded back. Operation Hens and Roosters was going perfectly. Until they ran into a minor hiccup. The young man asking them a question as he handed back their id\u2019s.\n\n \n\n\u201cDo you have anything illegal in your car? Anything that can\u2019t be brought over the border. Sorry to be a bother. It\u2019s just mandatory that we ask every vehicle. Sometimes people can bring fruits or vegetables into the country which aren\u2019t always allowed.\u201d\n\n \n\nGranny Wheeler felt that same rush she got when she first found out that kinder surprises weren\u2019t allowed in the country. A rush of lying to authority. \u201cNo, not at all. Nothing in this car except a few younglings.\u201d  \n\n \n\nThe man laughed. \u201cAlright, good. I\u2019ll just do a quick inspection, ok? Make sure everything\u2019s fine and you\u2019re good to go.\u201d\n\n \n\nAs he circled the car, Adam stepped out, being the muscle of this operation. \u201cHey, sonny. What flashlight do you use?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cFlashlight?\u201d The young man paused, looking at his belt. \u201cI think it\u2019s a standard issue one. You can probably get it from the store.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s not a standard issue one. Here, let me have a look.\u201d He held out his hand, and for some strange reason, the young man felt compelled to give it to him. \u201cSee, this isn\u2019t standard. Standards have a more curved light. You can tell this one\u2019s a more expensive model. Are you looking? How are you ever going to learn if you don\u2019t look?\u201d Adam pressed the flashlight under the young man\u2019s nose, forcing him to look.\n\n \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d He said, trying to be polite.\n\n \n\n\u201cHow do you hold it?\u201d\n\n \n\nThe young man took the flashlight, pointing it forward. \u201cLike this?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cNo. Like this, use your wrist more. It\u2019s all in the wrist. Like fishing. You flick it, and keep it pointed.\u201d Adam flicked his wrist, showing a motion that was impossible to copy, before handing it back to the young man. \u201cHold the flashlight like I showed you. HOLD IT!\u201d\n\nA sense of dread ran through the young man, who awkwardly handed his flashlight back to Adam, acting as if he wasn\u2019t worthy of holding it anymore. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, boy. I\u2019ll do the check for you. Stand over there.\u201d Adam made the young man stand away from the car before he popped the boot, staring at the pile of chocolate eggs crowding the back. \u201cWheelchair, a few dentures, nothing interesting.\u201d He said, pushing down on the boot, struggling to close it. To help get it closed, he removed an egg and hid it behind his back. Leaning against the car, he tossed the egg through the window, into Wheeler\u2019s lap. \u201cHere\u2019s your flashlight. Good job today.\u201d\n\n \n\nThe young man didn\u2019t know what to say, standing there stunned. Had he done a good job? All he did was get yelled at for not using a flashlight properly while standing and watching Adam do his job. Still, it made him happy. \u201cOk, you can all go. Have a lovely trip, you three.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cThanks dear, here\u2019s a treat for your troubles.\u201d Wheeler went to find another caramel, only to hand him the kinder egg that had been sitting in her lap, giving it to him before driving off. When they were out of earshot, they cheered. \u201cWE DID IT, LET\u2019S CELEBRATE, LIKE THE HENS AND ROOSTERS WE ARE.\u201d She turned up the volume in her car, playing her cassette tape of the chicken dance through her car\u2019s speakers. The group of oldies ready to deliver their supplies to their grandkids.\n\n \n\nMeanwhile, the young man watched them drive away, staring at the egg in his hand. \u201cA kinder egg? I haven\u2019t had one of these since I was a kid.\u201d He smiled, not even realizing they were illegal. He cracked open the egg and devoured the chocolate shell, getting hit with that familiar sweet rush. \u201cMmm, wonder what toy I got?\u201d He opened the plastic capsule, finding a toy fledgling inside. \u201cAww, that\u2019s cute.\u201d He slipped the toy into his pocket for safekeeping before he went to inspect the next car.\n\n"

        "writing_prompt": "Every Halloween, you\u2019re magically bound to embody the last costume you wore. For years, you\u2019ve been creative with it\u2014fun, lighthearted choices. But this year, you impulsively dressed as the embodiment of death. Now it\u2019s November 1st, and the costume isn\u2019t fading.",
        "story": "\u201cOk. Relax. This doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m death. Maybe someone just glued my robes on? I\u2019ll take a quick look under my hood and see that everything\u2019s as normal as it should be.\u201d I said, raising my hood, only to see a skull staring back at me in my bathroom mirror. \u201cWhat the hell, I\u2019m death?\u201d My skeletal hands pressed against my skull, digging into my eye sockets. \u201cWait, how come I can still see? That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\n \n\nSomehow that made this less strange, that weird realization that I could still see dulling the fact that I had become death, the reaper of souls. If anything, the longer I thought about it, the more I relaxed. \u201cGuess it\u2019s better than my crazy frog costume last year. At least my little tadpoles aren\u2019t bouncing around this time.\u201d I murmured, making sure I still had my pants on under these robes.\n\n \n\n\u201cSo, how long will this last? A day? A week? Usually, I had to perform some act in my costume to release the spell. Like that cover of who let the dogs out I did last year. Man, that crazy frog period was weird.\u201d I went and made myself a cup of coffee, realizing I only had myself to blame for this. \u201cWhy did I think this year would be any different? This is the fourth time its happened. I should have been Mario, like I originally planned. At least I would have met a princess then.\u201d\n\n \n\nBringing the coffee to my mouth, I took a sip, feeling it ooze down my throat before splashing onto the kitchen tiles. \u201cWHAT? So, I can see but I can\u2019t taste and drink? How does any of this work? Do I have a body? Do I not have a body? These are some sloppy magic rules.\u201d I said, arguing with the essence of strange happenings, as if a fairy or plot device would appear to explain why this was the case. Unfortunately, no help arrived, leaving me to muddle my way through this, like always.\n\n \n\nI sluggishly dragged my robe along the tiles of the kitchen floor, moping it with my clothing. Without my morning coffee, I didn\u2019t have the energy to give it a proper cleanup, making a half assed attempt. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll collect some souls then.\u201d\n\n \n\nWhere to find souls? That was the question. Graveyards? Retirement homes? After giving it some thought, I decided that the retirement home would be the better option, as the people in the graveyards had probably already moved on to the afterlife. As I stepped outside, no one batted an eye, most people passing through me, not even noticing my presence. Only giving a small shiver as I stepped past them. As I made it to the end of the street, I heard a voice. \n\n\u201cStill wearing your costume, dear?\u201d Old lady Jill asked, giving me a friendly wave from her porch.\n\n \n\n\u201cOh, yeah. It\u2019s a long story.\u201d I would have smiled if I still had lips, only giving her a friendly tip of my hood before pausing. \u201cWait? You can see me.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYes, dear. Should I not be able to see you?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cUm.\u201d This was awkward. Honestly, I think I would have preferred the crazy frog costume over this. At least that didn\u2019t involve dragging a nice old lady to the afterlife. Even if it may have caused her to die of shock. \u201cI think you may be dead.\u201d\n\n \n\nShe glanced down at herself, pushing her glasses up her nose to get a better look at her ethereal body. \u201cI am? Oh, sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to haunt you, dear. I\u2019ll head back inside. You have a lovely day.\u201d She gave me a sincere apology, waddling back to her door as I trailed behind her.\n\n \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize. I\u2019m death. Well, I\u2019m filling in for death. When I put on a costume, I become the person it\u2019s based on.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cAnd you still keep dressing up?\u201d She asked, making me again realize how stupid I was.\n\n \n\n\u201cI never learn. Anyway, I would be honored to take you to the afterlife. I\u2019m still new to this, but I think I could muddle my way through it. How hard can it be?\u201d I stared up at the heavens and raised my arms, the sleeves rolling down, giving me a cinematic look. \u201cDEADETH GO UPPIES.\u201d\n\n \n\nJill looked up at the sky, then at me. \u201cI don\u2019t think that worked, dear. It looked very good, though.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d I was out of ideas, expecting it to be the first thing I tried. What now? \u201cFrom whence you came, you shall remain. Until you are, complete again.\u201d Again, nothing. \u201cHave you got any ideas? Do you feel floaty or anything?\u201d\n\n \n\nJill opened her mouth, as if the soul would simply pop free and ascend to the heavens. While I thought it was a stupid idea, it still made a lot more sense than anything I had tried, which said a lot about my plans. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, dear. I thought it would come out on its own.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm. What if I just,\u201d I placed my hand on her cheek, only for her mouth to pop open, and a blue light to appear in her throat. As the light appeared, she let out a squeal, eyes rolling back as her body vanished, leaving only a small blue orb. \n\nI remained frozen after that, silently processing the traumatic scene I had seen. Finally, I screamed. \u201cI THOUGHT I KILLED HER. WHY DID HER EYES ROLL BACK LIKE THAT? EW, THAT WAS SO SCARY.\u201d I juggled her soul between my hands until I felt comfortable enough to hold it. \u201cWow, her soul\u2019s light. Guess that means she was a good person. Alright, let\u2019s send you to heaven.\u201d \n\nI tossed her soul skyward, only for it to come back down, crashing towards the Earth. \u201cCrap.\u201d I jumped, catching it before it went through the ground, nearly accidentally sending her either to hell or to the core of the Earth. \u201cOk, so don\u2019t throw the soul. Um, maybe I tell her where to go? Go to heaven, good girl, go home.\u201d I said, imagining I was talking to a dog. \n\nWeirdly enough, that worked. The soul fluttering from my palm, heading into the sky before vanishing. As it left, my robes dissolved, leaving me standing on her porch. The rush of satisfaction I got from a job well done was quickly destroyed when I realized I was now standing outside a recently deceased person\u2019s home. With that knowledge in mind, I went home, only to get knocked over on the sidewalk. \n\n\u201cWATCH WHERE YOU\u2019RE STANDING.\u201d The jogger huffed, not even taking their headphones off to hear any potential reply, continuing on their way. I picked myself up and dusted off my pants. \u201cOk, no more dressing up next year.\u201d That was the last time. Although, it would be a kind of funny if I dressed up as the hamburglar\u2026\n\n"

        "story": "\u201cOk, that\u2019s on you. What\u2019s a trojan hearse even supposed to be? You could have just said. Lila, my beautiful and charming comrade. Can you be a dear and make me a casket, so that we may sneak into the building while pretending to be a funeral procession? How much simpler is that than whatever you mumbled about a trojan hearse?\u201d Lila said, standing beside the magnificent wooden horse she had built. One that looked out-of-place sitting in the parking lot of a church.\n\n \n\n\u201cIt is not on me. It isn\u2019t even hovering near me. I gave you instructions. The word hearse was right there.\u201d Dan said, rubbing his forehead. As funeral cars passed their trojan horse, Dan gave them an apologetic nod, wishing he could have stopped them and explained that he wasn\u2019t the weird one. It was his partner in crime that was the idiot.\n\n \n\n\u201cYou know I think readings for nerds. If I read too much, I\u2019ll end up having to wear glasses like you, then everyone will be like. Oh, Lila\u2019s a four eyes now, despite the fact I\u2019ll still have two eyes.\u201d She held up four fingers, leaving Dan stunned. She had a habit of stunning Dan, deflating any anger he had and replacing it with confusion.\n\n \n\n\u201cNo one calls me a four eyes.\u201d He said, tapping the side of his glasses.\n\n \n\n\u201cNot to your face.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWhose calling me a four eyes?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cOh, people.\u201d Lila coyly said, watching the cars drive up the dirt road towards the church. Meanwhile, Dan fidgeted with the edge of his glasses, taking them off for a second.\n\n \n\n\u201cWhich people? Are they seriously calling me a four eyes? Not that I care, it\u2019s just childish.\u201d Dan did care, but he didn\u2019t want Lila to know that, trying to act disinterested, even if she now had his full attention.\n\n \n\n\u201cWell, me for starters.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYOU DON\u2019T COUNT.\u201d\n\n \n\nLila gasped, placing a hand over her mouth. \u201cYou didn\u2019t just say that. I do so count. I feel you don\u2019t respect me enough. I went and built a beautiful horse for you and all you\u2019ve done is complain. I had to use a lot of glue to keep it together.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cGlue?\u201d Dan peered at the glue stains, amazed the horse survived the trip. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have mattered if you built the best horse in the world. It\u2019s not going to help us steal any gems. All those beautiful religious gems are now lost to us because of your incompetence.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re a four eyes.\u201d Lila huffed, as the pair leaned against opposite ends of the horse, refusing to do anything until the other side apologized. Lila fuming that all her hard work had been for nothing. All those late nights gathering wooden ice cream sticks were now wasted because of him. Not to mention the effort it took for her to transport it to the church.\n\n \n\nIf the wooden horse didn\u2019t already make them stand out, their uniforms did. Lila wore a bright purple hoodie, with a logo of a unicorn lazing on a pile of grass. The hoodie matching the color of her hair, keeping everything the same. While Dan went for something more fitting. They were trying to sneak into a funeral, so he wanted to look the part. Choosing a red shirt with a black suit jacket. He thought he looked elegant, like someone who belonged at a funeral. Instead, he looked like the devil in disguise, choosing a hellish color scheme for a place of mourning.\n\n \n\nWhile they bickered, Father Andrews strolled over, curious about the wooden horse that had stumbled onto his church grounds. \u201cWhat a wonderful creation. Is there a reason you brought it here, my children?\u201d He asked, causing them both to bounce into a standing position.\n\n \n\nLila threw out her arms, trying to hide the giant wooden horse behind her back, while Dan only sighed, turning to look at Lila\u2019s creation. \u201cWe were transporting it for an art exhibit.\u201d He lied, quickly making up an excuse on the spot. \u201cUnfortunately, because of shoddy craftsmanship, we don\u2019t think it will make the rest of the trip. That\u2019s why we stopped here. We\u2019re assessing it for any signs of damage.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cSHODDY?\u201d Lila roared, gripping Dan\u2019s red shirt. \u201cI\u2019ll show you shoddy. I\u2019ll make your face all shoddy.\u201d When she remembered the priest was there, she loosened her grip slightly. \u201cIf I beat him up, can you forgive my sins afterwards? Oh, I think I found a glitch. If the priest forgives me, I can do whatever I want.\u201d\n\n \n\nFather Andrews laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think it works like that, dear. You shouldn\u2019t call it shoddy either, sir. It\u2019s clearly a well loved horse.\u201d He reached up and patted its wooden face, smiling. \u201cPeople only ever come here in times of mourning. To bury those that they\u2019ve lost, seeing something born in a place like this is a pleasant reminder of the beauties of life.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Dan said, pushing Lila\u2019s hand away. Dan wondering what could even be considered remotely beautiful about the stupid horse that Lila had made.\n\n\u201cYou get it.\u201d Lila cheered. \u201cIt\u2019s a creation, one that took a lot of hard work and effort to make. It makes this place look a lot less gloomy, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cIt does.\u201d Father Andrews agreed.\n\n \n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you keep it? Maybe it can cheer people up? I know you\u2019ll treat Woody the wonder horse well.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYou named it?\u201d Dan said through gritted teeth. \u201cEven though it\u2019s lifeless?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t stop your mother from naming you, did it?\u201d Lila snapped back, before grinning at the priest, offering him the horse. Dan said nothing after that, too offended by that remark.\n\n \n\nThe priest smirked, stroking the side of the wooden horse. \u201cThank you, I\u2019ll take good care of Woody the wonder horse. I promise. I\u2019m sure the kids will love it.\u201d The priest went to push the horse towards the church, only to stop. Reaching into his robes, he pulled out a small blue gem, handing it to Lila. \u201cThere, as a thank you.\u201d When he left, Lila let out a screaming cheer.\n\n \n\n\u201cI GOT A GEM.\u201d\n\n \n\nDan almost fell to his knees as he tried to swipe it from her hands. \u201cGive me.\u201d\n\n \n\nBefore he could grab it, Lila pulled it away, shaking her head. \u201cNope, you insulted my horse, so you don\u2019t get to hold it. Didn\u2019t we have a rule that we only had to split the reward if both members contributed to the plan? You contributed nothing.\u201d\n\n \n\nAs much as he wanted to argue with her, Dan knew she was right. Cutting his losses, he exhaled. \u201cAlright, you win. It\u2019s yours. Next time, will you please read my instructions, though?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cIf you say you\u2019re sorry for doubting my plan.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for doubting your plan.\u201d It hurt him to say that, having to force the words out. Still, it felt relieving to get them out, feeling guilty for his earlier outbursts.\n\n \n\n\u201cI forgive you. Let\u2019s go grab lunch. We should celebrate a successful mission. We\u2019re the best thieves around.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly thieves. Not sure about the best.\u201d Dan said, following her back to their cars.\n\n"

        "story": "\u201cOk, so can you let go of my hand now?\u201d Jeremy asked, feeling the mimics stiff tongue flicking against his elbow, touching it in ways that no elbow should ever be touched. When the mimic finally spat out his hand, Jeremy fell back, grimacing at the sight of the bright blue saliva that was dribbling down his arm, staining the stone dungeon floor below.\n\n \n\n\u201cThere. Next time will you think before you shove your hand into someone\u2019s mouth?\u201d The treasure chest\u2019s lid flapped, acting like it was possessed by demonic magic. The golden chest was a sight that promised legendary treasures, having a wooden exterior with gold metal plating that lined its edges and front. Even knowing it was a mimic, Jeremy struggled to resist diving into it again, all his instincts as an adventurer telling him it had rare loot.\n\n \n\nJeremy dragged his hand against the side of his pants, trying to clean off as much mimic saliva as he could, before inspecting the chest. Small pin sized eyes near the keyhole of the chest, the way it twitched as if it were drawing breath. Without his treasure hungry trance, it was obvious this wasn\u2019t a real chest. Though, most adventurers never took the time to check out a chest, too busy searching for loot to bother with such a thing.\n\n \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re a mimic, right? If you don\u2019t want someone touching you, why don\u2019t you transform into a chair or something? That seems easier.\u201d Jeremy suggested, feeling this wasn\u2019t entirely his fault. A treasure chest in a dungeon wasn\u2019t the sort of thing that screamed, don\u2019t touch me.\n\n \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not some freak that wants people sitting on them! I would rather have a hundred hands shoved into my mouth than an orc trying to use me as a stool.\u201d The chest huffed, and when they said it like that, Jeremy had to agree with them.\n\n \n\nJeremy tapped at his chin, thinking about other items the mimic could control. Not wanting to waste too much time going over the options, he quickly fired a few off.\n\n \n\n\u201cA lamp.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cToo many people will try to blow me out.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cA statue?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cToo many people will start climbing all over me.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cA human?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cEw.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, ew?\u201d Jeremy said, offended by the monster\u2019s ew. He wasn\u2019t the one that just slobbered over someone\u2019s arm. \u201cFine, stay a treasure chest. I hope someone tries to lock pick you.\u201d Jeremy collected his bag from the dungeon floor and threw it over his shoulder. \u201cWell, if you\u2019ve got no treasure to offer me, then I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait. Do you really think the human disguise could work?\u201d It asked, considering the idea. The mimic\u2019s body dissolved into a pile of goo, pooling by the adventurers\u2019 feet before suddenly bursting up from the floor, bouncing to a human sized figure, one that slowly gained its features before him.\n\n \n\nThe mimics new form now towering over Jeremy, staring down at him with its expressionless face. They were as strange as a person could be. Eyes devoid of any color, skin having an eerie blue tint and long silver hair that fell to the shoulders of the robe they were wearing .\n\n \n\nJeremy didn\u2019t know what to think of the form. It looked human-ish? Like a body that belonged to a mage or some other mana filled person. However, it didn\u2019t look normal, not the type of body you wouldn\u2019t notice if you passed it on the street. \u201cIt\u2019s a little unique.\u201d Jeremy said, trying to be nice.\n\n \n\n\u201cYou hate it.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate it. I just wouldn\u2019t trust that man if I passed them on the street. I would expect them to curse me or something. You need to think of something simpler. Close your eyes and imagine the most generic adventurer you can think of.\u201d\n\n \n\nThe mimic transformed into Jeremy, opening its eyes. \u201cHow\u2019s this then?\u201d It asked, swirling on the spot, giving Jeremy a look at his own body, something that was more unsettling than he expected it to be.\n\n \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not generic! I\u2019m unique for a human. Look at my scar.\u201d Jeremy said, lifting his shirt, showing off the small scar he had gotten from poking himself with a knife while drunkenly preparing a meal. \u201cSee, a scar means I\u2019m unique.\u201d\n\n \n\nThe mimic leaned in closer, as if he were about to give Jeremy\u2019s stomach raspberries. \u201cAh, so you do. I\u2019ll correct that.\u201d The mimic retreated and raised its shirt, showing off the same scar. \u201cThere, now I should be able to walk around without being bothered.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cYou can\u2019t be me. I\u2019m me.\u201d Jeremy sighed, scratching his head. \u201cLook, just go back to being a chest, ok? That\u2019s the safest option. I\u2019ll even put up a sign that says mimics are living creatures. Although, most adventurers can\u2019t read.\u201d He admitted. When the mimic changed back into a chest, Jeremy went to the doorway of the treasure room, getting out a piece of cloth from his bag. It would be a crude sign, but a sign nonetheless.\n\n \n\nAs he went to hang the cloth up, the weak entrance of the treasure room crumbled. The collapsing stones, threatening to come down on Jeremy\u2019s head. With a quick pivot, Jeremy got himself out of the way, helplessly watching as the treasure room entrance sealed, leaving the mimic inside. \u201cCrap, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize how weak it was. I\u2019ll dig you out.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cNO. This is perfect. No more adventurers, no more monsters, just a quiet room.\u201d The mimic sighed, able to relax now that they wouldn\u2019t have to deal with any threats. It wasn\u2019t like they needed to eat that much, either. Able to survive on the moss and moisture that appeared in the room. \u201cThank you, adventurer. For this gift.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re welcome. I guess?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cIf you want some treasure, check behind the statue near the entrance. I heard a thief mention they keep a stash there.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWill do.\u201d As he left the dungeon, he found the stash the mimic had been referring to. An assortment of beautiful gems all bunched tightly together in a leather sack. Taking the sack, he headed for his village, considering that a successful trip.\n\n"

        "story": "\u201cYou don\u2019t get to decide to have a heart now, sweetheart. That isn\u2019t how this program works. You were born and raised to be a weapon. There isn\u2019t even a full brain in your thick skull anymore. All that\u2019s left is a machine. You\u2019re nothing but a gun. Now stop jamming and fire.\u201d Lieutenant Gabby Ria ordered, pointing at the child across from her.\n\n \n\nWhile she shrieked out her orders, Era froze, unable to pull the trigger. The lieutenant was right; they were only a weapon. Yet memories were flooding into its mind, drowning out that robotic side that often took centre stage. Memories of a specific human it couldn\u2019t recognise, getting overwhelmed by their past.\n\n \n\nAcross from the pair, the girl, Jessica, remained curled behind a desk, gripping a stuffed bear. The paw of the bear once holding a tiny red balloon, one that had been torn off days ago. Even without the scraps she wore, she was a miserable sight. Tired eyes, constant shaking and a murmuring for help that only Era\u2019s hyper-detailed hearing could pick up. \u201cPlease, leave me alone.\u201d She begged.\n\n \n\nEra could never point its gun at a superior officer, so instead, it turned its face towards her, neck twisting eighty degrees to find her. They designed Era models to be basic, stripping them of all their unique features and traits. Giving them the same blank blue eyes, light brown hair, and voice chips. This making it harder for a lieutenant or any officer to see them as anything other than a disposable machine.\n\n \n\n\u201cWhy? Why can I think? I don\u2019t like this? I don\u2019t like thinking.

They had bombed the place to hell. No, that didn\u2019t even do it justice. They had bombed the place to purgatory, leaving nothing but scorched land, a few desks and the remnants of glass and tubes. If one passed through this place, they would assume it had been an underground dumping facility, not the proud anti Era factory they had boasted about while it was still active.\n\n \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t feel pain, and you can\u2019t think. There shouldn\u2019t even be a part of you that can think. It\u2019s blocked under our programing. Listen to me, Era.\u201d Gabby began.\n\n\u201cI\u2019M NOT ERA.\u201d They snapped. \u201cI\u2019m Nick. We know each other. Don\u2019t we?\u201d\n\n \n\nGabby\u2019s heart sank. This shouldn\u2019t be possible. No other Era model had recovered their memories before. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t even have that name saved to your chip.\u201d As she contemplated the information, she heard tiny footsteps near the table. Returning her gun to the girl, she fired a shot, trying to hit the monster before it could flee. When the gun fired, the girl ducked back behind the table. \u201cDon\u2019t move, monster. Is this your doing?\u201d\n\n \n\nEra looked at the weapon in their hands, tensing. \u201cYou said this program was for justice. Didn\u2019t you? That we would save people? Why are we doing this, then? You said this program would save me. Am I actually saved?\u201d You\u2019ve made me into a monster.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have assigned you to me, Nick. None of this makes any sense. I never lied about anything. On your deathbed, I told you that this was the only way you could keep fighting. You wanted to fight. I was against this.\u201d Gabby kept her weapon pointed at the table, giving Era a side glance.\n\n \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this. I\u2019m scared. Why did they need part of my brain? Can\u2019t they make robots?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cRobots are unreliable. They can be hacked, and their energy drains far too quickly. Allowing them to use part of a human brain allows their processes to save space and energy on the field. You should already know this. We\u2019ve had this conversation before, haven\u2019t we?\u201d Gabby stepped closer to the table, only to halt when she heard Era follow her.\n\n \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t kill her.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s only a kid.\u201d\n\nGabby sighed. \u201cYou know. Part of me wanted to believe that was actually you, Nick. That I could say a proper goodbye to my old friend. It\u2019s not. That creature\u2019s just pulling at memories, trying to find something that might weaken me. A creature like this killed you. You should know she isn\u2019t just a kid. its emotional manipulation, the same type you fell to. I\u2019m guessing you knew that too, monster. Or did you overlook that memory when you were sweeping through our files?\u201d\n\n \n\nJessica screeched, tossing the bear to the floor. She knew she was trapped, giving guttural growls as she tapped the table, shaking her only cover. Gabby remained still, not approaching the sound, nor firing a wasted shot. \u201cNick, if that is you in there, you\u2019ll take the shot.\u201d\n\n \n\nEra did nothing, and so Gabby reached into Era\u2019s hand, pulling the trigger on his weapon. When it fired, the monster popped out from its cover, assuming Gabby had fired her own gun. Thinking it had a chance to run, it lunged out of cover, only to get shot down by Gabby. The \u2018girls\u2019 synthetic skin falling away as it powered down, revealing the metallic body underneath.\n\n\u201cFucking manipulative pricks. I can\u2019t believe they keep making these things. To think, a monster like that can find out so much about a person without needing to get into their heads. Not only that, their able to mess with the Era models programming. So much for the anti-hacking argument my superiors gave me. Why do we even need a human brain in them anymore, if those creatures can get around it?\u201d Gabby pushed her fingers against her eyes, wiping the tears away. \u201cFucking hell, Nick. You\u2019re still haunting me.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a Lieutenant now Gabby?\u201d A voice asked, causing Gabby to stiffen. \u201cWeren\u2019t you meant to wait for me?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYou died. I couldn\u2019t wait. Nick, I\u2019m sorry. I hesitated, and it killed you because of it. Nick, I\u2019m\u2026\u201d She turned, finding a blank Era model staring at her.\n\n \n\n\u201cThere is no Nick in my records? Has a person been added to the mission statement? If so, please give me their full name or number and rank, so I may add them to my objective.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cEra, override programming protocol, no identification. Now tell me, who are you?\u201d Gabby said, praying it wasn\u2019t who she thought it was.\n\n \n\n\u201cHeather Phillips donated this brain. Id 2003213. Would you like any further information on Heather Phillips?\u201d Era asked.\n\n \n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Gabby walked over and stomped the dead monster, making sure there was no way that its programming could keep running. \u201cTo think our enemies have resorted to this. Era, enter low-power mode, only run basic functions and cut off your link to main server. Sweep the area and capture anything humanoid you find. If you can\u2019t capture it, kill it.\u201d\n\n \n\nWith Gabby\u2019s orders, the machine walked around the ruined laboratory, searching for more of those creatures. Gabby hoping that they wouldn\u2019t be able to hack Era in its low powered mode. Without access to the main server, it shouldn\u2019t be able to give away any of her secrets either. Gabby assuming that was how it found out about her connection to Nick, through whatever files they had saved about her and her previous missions.\n\n \n\nWhile Era searched the area, Gabby called their base. \u201cOur enemies are getting stronger. It was able to find out about my connection to Nick. We need to bump up our security or they\u2019ll soon learn how to turn the Era\u2019s guns against us. I\u2019ll tell you more when I get back. Just send a pickup. I\u2019ve got a body here too. I\u2019m sure you would like a chance to see what machinery they're putting inside their weapons.\u201d She said, ending her transmission.\n\n"
