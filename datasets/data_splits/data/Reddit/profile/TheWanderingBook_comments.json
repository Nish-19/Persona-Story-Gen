Far away from the mortal gaze!\", he boomed, as with another lightning strike, he disappeared, and guides walked up to us, leading us in...\n\n  \nThe main building was even bigger on the inside, endless hallways stretching in all directions.  \nWeapons, tomes, books, scrolls littered the walls, and floors, as we were guided into the main hall.  \n\"Welcome to all our students, old and new!  \nThe Academy is a sanctuary for the demigods of the world, so that you can grow up to be able to bear the burden of your own fates!\", a woman said, as she took to a small podium.  \n\"I am an avatar of Freya, headmistress for this century of Pantheon Academy.  \nMany of you came from legacies, and even more came here through roaming teachers, found by luck, by fate!  \nThus, as every year, we shall start with the sorting ceremony, as soon as you stepped into this hall, all the gods, small or big, were notified of your existence.  \nYou shall find a mark of your parentage somewhere on your body.\", she said, smiling.  \nThis was it...I could find out who...at least one of my parents was....\n\n  \nI looked, and looked, and I found on my chest...a mark.  \nA fish...a sheep?

And a door opened.  \nEntering it, I found myself in front of an ocean, and close to the shore was a floating, magnificent tower.  \nInside the tower I found countless tomes, weapons, and workshops for blacksmithing, alchemy, and more.  \nI settled in, but couldn't sleep, so I simply sat in one of the many windows, and looked at the raging waves...  \nIt was soothing.  \n\"So...my life begins...now at 15 years old...\", I muttered, as I stared at the shadows seeming deep under the water.  \n\"Don't sulk, come the freshmen are having a party.\", a voice broke me out of my reverie.  \n\"Mr. Loki...\", I looked at the...individual who found me.  \nNow he was a man, but when she found me, she was but a girl my age...  \nHe winked at me, and yanked me out of the tower, laughing.  \nThe waves rose to catch me, and riding them, I chased after him, ready to see what this academy has to offer..."

You should be afraid of big ones.  \nOnes too big for what they're meant to be used for, with nobody around, because it should make you wonder why it's empty.\".  \nI never understood what he meant...until today.\n\n  \nWe visited a new planet, exploring it for possible colonization, or at least to see whether we can find something useful or not.  \nIt was covered in a forest of such proportions, skyscrapers would look like huts near these trees.  \nEntering such a forest, we saw a lot of flora, and no...fauna for some reason, but we didn't dwell on the topic.  \nMushroom, herbs, flowers, fruits...we saw everything, and the preliminary analysis was showing good results for the usefulness of them.  \nThen...we found it.  \nA structure, like a temple or palace...it covered the entirety of the forest in front of us.\n\n  \n\"It's...it's easily the size of a metropolis...\", one of my team members said.  \n\"Readings show that it's...it's at least 500 kilometers in width, and no reading on the length...  \nIt's already above the paygrade of my sensors...\", another muttered.  \nI looked around, at the vines, and flowers growing everywhere, and at the dirt on the structure.  \n\"Clearly, nobody is around, and haven't been around for a long time...  \nLet's enter.\", I said, but despite sounding casual...I already took out my weapon, and so did everyone else.  \nWe entered the structure, and my grandfather's words started sounding loud and clear in my mind.\n\n  \nInside, the structure was even bigger, the pillars seemingly endlessly rising upwards, as if the roof we saw outside didn't exist.  \nThe engravings on the pillars indicated the existence of intelligent lifeforms, for they were complex and...familiar to what we used to have tens of thousands years ago, depicting gods, and rituals.  \nWe walked around the empty halls, and found statues, altars, furniture like objects...all humongous.  \nEverybody was uneasy.  \n\"This is worse than when we entered that Lava Ant nest...\", one teammate muttered.  \nThe mood was depressing, and it was getting worse, as after hours of exploring, we still haven't found evidence of life here.  \n\"It's goddamn obvious people lived here! Look at the pillars, at the furniture! Hell, we found knives and whatnots!  \nWhere are they?\", someone complained.  \nThe unsettling feeling was getting worse, while grandfather's words were like a mantra in my head, as I started to look more and more at the structure...when I realized it.  \n\"Let's leave...quickly, this place shall be a Dead Zone to the Human Empire!\", I said turning around, following the drones we left as markers.  \n\"Why boss? We could find real treasures here.\", someone asked.  \n\"This structure...was once a mountain.  \nIt was carved out in one-piece to look like this.\", I said, and they all fell quiet.  \nWe hurried along, because we didn't want to deal with whatever was going on here...  \nWith how good the structure looked, if we ignored the dirt, and flora...it shouldn't have been ancient, and yet...it was empty...  \nWhatever happened here was recent, and if it managed to erase a civilization capable of carving out an entire mountain to build a temple...  \nWe wanted none of it."

Should they just erase tens of thousands of traditions?\", one of the Twelve asked.  \n\"What about the trillions of people each mid-tier and higher ranked civilization has, whom willingly enter servitude, and become slaves in exchange of resources, or chances for their offspring to get a better future?  \nAre they to be...freed from what? Themselves?\", another representative asked.  \nThe Human representative sank into a deep silence.\n\n\n\n\"But as intelligent lifeforms...freedom is a paramount right.\", the Human representative said in the end.  \n\"You arrived onto the Galactic scene when the Community has already been ruling this galaxy for millennia...  \nYou haven't experienced being killed for biomass, being harvested for soul energy, being enslaved for mining, enslaved to be experimented upon, enslaved and conquered to be bred like mares for the insectoids, or other races that can't live a peaceful life.\", one of the Twelve said.  \n\"You think slavery is bad, but all slaves have to be fed properly, their health indexes have to be above average, their offspring are required to have formal education and a chance to another status.  \nThese are all regulated, and the slave trade is under careful investigation constantly.\", another of the Twelve chimed in.  \n\"We...we didn't know...\", he muttered.  \n\"Of course, and that's your saving grace.  \nYou shall reimburse the 9 civilizations that you have warred with, and you shall be in charge of the slave trade of your sector, let it be a lesson, and learn the reason why we have this system in place.\", the Twelve said.  \nThe trial was dismissed, and the punishment meted out.  \nHumanity's distaste for slavery was justifiable, but their slavery, and the slavery practiced on the galactic stage are two different things.  \nNow, humanity has to learn to see things from a myriad other perspectives, perspectives that they might not even be able to see, let alone understand..."

I want to see if the spiderlings survive the explosion and hatch!\", the young boy said.  \nAlfonso, who saw this smiled.  \n\"What a bunch of posers...I doubt they will be missed.\", he thought, as he welcomed them.\n\n\n\nThe Addams family got neighboring rooms at the Sunset Motel, and Alfonso started his work.  \nAt the breakfast, he expected the usual: unease, and quick retreat of the guests to their room...but it didn't happen.  \n\"Oh, Alfonso my dear, this is a wonderful tea.  \nWolfbane, arsenic and a hint of some viper poison?   \nWe want a vial of all, please.\", the woman, called Morticia said, as she sipped the tea.  \nAlfonso was shocked, but just nodded.  \nAt night, he released sleeping gas enough to knock out a herd of elephants into their rooms.  \nBut as soon as he approached the children's room, the door opened.  \n\"Oh, please, increase the quality of the gas, not the quantity...  \nThis just makes Pugsley snore.\", the young girl said...completely unaffected by the gas.  \nAlonso smiled, and nodded, but his thoughts were getting darker.\n\n\n\nDuring the next few days, he tried once more to poison them, he set free spiders, lizards, and snakes inside the motel...all caught and taken as pets by the young girl called, Wednesday.  \nHe activated all the traps...which were used as morning exercise devices by the man...Gomez.  \nOn the last day, at breakfast, he finally couldn't stand it...and tried to stab Morticia in the heart, but Gomez appeared out of nowhere, took the knife in his mouth...and started dancing with his wife.  \nAlfonso broke down...none of his tries actually worked.  \nSeeing Alfonso on his knees...panting, Gomez and Morticia exchanged looks.  \n\"I see, we the Addams' are not stingy.  \nYoung man your Motel is one of the bests we have ever been, second only to the Old One's Shadow from the Bermudas.  \nPlease, take this as an extra payment for this amazing experience.\", Gomez said, taking out...three ingots of gold, and putting them in front of Alfonso.  \n\"Yes...this place is romantic...reminds me of the early days when we were chased by the townsfolk...\", Morticia said, and her and Gomez started swooning over each other.  \n\"Nice try, but you are too green.  \nBetter luck next time.\", Wednesday said, with her cold gaze, while Pugsley just followed his family, toying with...with a C4.  \nAlfonso closed the Motel not long after, retiring...to the disappointment of the Addams family, who tried to visit it a year later..."

        "story": "Being called to a scene in the middle of the night is never a good sign for a detective.  \nAfter all...there is a night shift for a reason.  \nArriving at the house where the event happened...I saw...blood, everywhere.  \n3 teenagers were huddled up, under a blanket, as the EMT were trying to calm them down.  \nThey shivered, and didn't even look up, but, for some reason to me at least, they didn't look shaken at all.  \nThey weren't explaining the situation, they barely talked, they just \"shivered\", and that's all, but that's a common trauma response, shutting down, so I shouldn't be too skeptic.  \nI was not a people person...so I went ahead and checked the scene first.\n\n  \nFollowing the blood trails...I found messed up rooms, broken furniture, holes in the wall.  \nThings were looking weird from the start.  \nWhile blood was everywhere...it was in patches, spots, lines...by no means the blood of 3, no...4 people.  \nAfter all...the \"psychopath\" was killed.  \nAlso...the things destroyed...some were cut, some were pummeled, some were stabbed...  \nWhile the murderer theoretically was chasing the kids with a...cleaver?  \nTaking my phone out, I started going through the rooms again...until I arrive in the kitchen...where the man who \"chased\" the kids was lying dead.\n\n  \nHe was...indeed tall, and a bit weird, after all, I knew the guy.  \nA bit of a weirdo, he worked as a mechanic, and did whatever Old Jeff, the autoshop's owner said to him.  \nLiving on his own, no pets, no family...I used to be called as a rookie to his house on well-fare checks, when dude forgot to go to work 2-3 days in a row, because he started watching a TV show.  \nLooking at him...he was riddled with wounds.  \nFace bashed in...clothes riddles with holes, and tear marks...  \nHis hand barely holding the cleaver...his left hand...  \nDude was righthanded....  \nI sighed, and left to discuss with my boss.\n\n  \n\"The kids are the murderers?  \nMatthew...they are 16 and 15 year old children! The man was three times their size!  \nA well-known creep, and while not his fault, he was a bit behind with matters of the mind!\", my boss sighed.  \nThrowing her the pics of the crime scene, of the supposed \"murderer\" and the supposed \"victims\", I sighed.  \n\"The kids present bruises, and cuts...cuts that are shallow, and thin...as if made with a knife.  \nDude had a cleaver...  \nThe house is riddled with random \"fighting\" marks, but most of them could be done while tussling.  \nThe man tried to escape, destroying furniture in his terror, his elbow making the holes in the walls, as he tried to get the kids off of his back...  \nHis neck is cut, Jeremy...what kind of self-defense maneuver requires slitting the throat of the attacker?\", I asked.  \n\"Why would they do it?\", he asked.  \n\"Because they knew how he is seen by society.  \nOne of the kids lives near the man, so they would know of his quirks.  \nJeremy...the man was 35 years old, with no priors.  \nAnd now suddenly...he decided to entrap, and try to kill 3 kids?   \nIn a house on the other side of the city?\", I said.  \nJeremy just sighed, and told me he will allow me to continue the investigation, while telling the public that there are some complication's with the man's documents...  \nThis will allow me to discuss with the kids, and to see...just why they did this."

        "story": "It was another beautiful day, and another day where I hoped I could help someone.  \nAs a family therapist, I tried my bet to be extremely open-minded, patient, and to listen to all parties involved, young and old alike.  \nI think I created a safe space where even the young ones can speak their minds freely...solving one issue after the other, slowly, step-by-step.  \nIt wasn't easy, and I was constantly learning, and taking new classes...but I loved it.  \nSo, I opened the door to my office, only to find myself in a hall with tall pillars of marble, endless hallways leading who knows where...and no sight of the roof.\n\n  \n\"What...\", I muttered, the coffee falling from my hand, but before it could land, another hand caught it.  \n\"Here...you will need it.\", a raven haired, emerald eyed woman smiled.  \n\"Who...Who are you? Where am I?\", I asked.  \n\"Hecate. The Hecate yes, no, it's not a hallucination, and no, you are not going to be sacrificed.  \nBut Zeus and his family are driving the rest of us nuts, and the Fates said that finally someone might have a chance to help them, and they sent me to get you.\", she said, in a rapid-fire mode...as she levitated me towards a certain door.  \n\"They are inside, they know about this...but they aren't happy.  \nGood luck.\", she said, opening the door and pushing me inside.\n\n  \nAs I got inside...I saw a huge office, filled with books, a large desk.  \n\"A mortal? A mortal will help us?\", a gentleman in a suit snorted.  \nI chuckled, and went towards the desk...as I could see a green thread leading me there.  \n\"Well, I was kidnapped, and forcefully brought here, but I am happy to help.  \nSo, I am Matthew, a family therapist...what seems to be the issue?\", I said, sitting down at the desk.  \n\"It seems that the others have forgotten who is the King of Gods!\", the gentleman roared...and looked as if he was waiting for something to happen, but nothing did.  \n\"Zeus I presume, and the lady next to you must be Hera...then the rest are...your children?\", I said.  \n\"His yes, mine are only Ares, Hebe, Ilithyria, and you could consider Hephaestus as well.\", she smiled.  \nI nodded.\n\n  \nWe sat in silence for a while, before one of the young ladies sighed.  \n\"This is the problem...Father doesn't want to acknowledge that we are flawed.\", she said.  \n\"WE ARE GODS!\", the man roared, and many of the young...deities? flinched.  \n\"I see. So you feel like the relationship between you and your father is not as it should be...and this is ignored?\", I asked the young lady.  \n\"I am Hebe, not young lady, and yet, but it's not just that.  \nWe are deities in a modern world, and yet Father still holds true to the old rules...and abhors change.\", she said.  \n\"Change can be hard, it's understandable why someone would be reticent to start.\", I said.  \n\"It's been so many years, I don't know how many stars I watched dim, and he still won't relent.\", Hera muttered.  \n\"Okay, I see.  \nWell, it seems like most of you won't speak with others present, so how about this: visit me one by one.  \nI will live here until we solve, or at least soften the issues?\", I said, and in that moment, I felt...warmth pouring inside of me.  \nAt the same moment, the doors opened, and almost everyone left.  \n\"If I can help...let me know.\", Hebe said, and left.  \nI sighed, and looked around...everything feeling so...familiar, like...I owned them.  \n\"This will take some time...\", I muttered, as I wondered if I can tour this place...before the first patient comes to talk..."
