They have since developed FTL technology and made peace, forgetting about their weapons. Today, their missiles arrive at each others planets.",
        "story": "A grim moral calculus, a horrifying product of game theory. We knew we were not alone. First there was elation, then there was a time of quiet thought as the implications were worked out. Resources were finite, and whatever other's took from the natural resources of the galaxy was resources we would never use. The thing to do was to initiate a first strike, and obliterate any others before they could do their own first strike. The only safe thing to do was to lash out, before the others did.\n\nSo, using our most advanced technology, numerous warheads of horrific destructive power were dispatched at light speed for those we had detected. History would judge our leaders harshly, but it would only be through this act of bastardy that we could have a future at all. It would take many decades for the missiles to arrive, and even longer to know if it had worked. Our first contact, our civilization's first step onto the interstellar field, would be an act of genocide.\n\nTime passed, and our society endured upheavals. Political and social transformations that had been a long time coming. The weapons we sent were lost as many of the officials who had made the decision were executed after judgment by the revolutionary tribunal. After the turmoil came a reconstruction, one that greatly benefited the standards of living for the general population. Things stabilized, and we began a policy of massive scientific funding.\n\nThe study of nature yielded wonders. Things once thought impossible were realized, chief among them perpetual motion and faster than light travel. Our entire civilization enjoyed incredible standards of living, almost limitless material abundance that led to deeply enriched and fulfilling lives. With our new faster than light propulsion systems, we set out into the stars.\n\nWe met the senders of the signal, our first meeting with another intelligence. They also had recently discovered faster than light travel and the perpetual motion machines enabled by it. So began a discourse and cultural exchange, which greatly enriched our arts. There were an abundance of mysteries to be solved and wonders to be realized, and we would do so together, an eternity of discovery and expression.\n\nIt was a student's experiment with tachyons that spotted it. Tiny pinpricks moving at the speed of light. Even with our overwhelming access to resources, systematically analyzing what was almost entirely a boring vacuum was deemed not worth the effort. But the student was curious, and passed the observation on to an exchange for amateur scientists. It was realized that the trajectories of the relativistic objects would cause them to impact our home system's star and all of its planets.\n\nThe news took time to reach those who could do anything about it. The time margin was remarkably small, another several minutes and billions could have died. They must have been fired by someone specifically targeting us, there was no chance it was simply a cosmic coincidence. Our neighbors claimed ignorance, and what could they gain by our destruction?\n\nThen incriminating documents surfaced. It seemed that our neighbors had indeed fired the warheads, in an era of fear and scarcity they had decided to initiate a first strike. It could have been terrible but there was no harm done. But then came tragedy.\n\nOur neighbors were not monitoring the space near their home world. Some ships managed to detect incoming projectiles, but they had only seconds to respond. A deflection was managed, but many ships and habitats were damaged. Tens of millions died, but gigadeaths were avoided. An investigation was launched, and it appeared the weapons were launched from out direction. Only then did we rediscover evidence that indicated the old regime on our world had launched a first strike as well.\n\nWe recoiled in horror at what our predecessors had done to our friends. Millions of lives that could have stretched for incredible amounts of time had been lost. Some ambitious scientists came up with a proposal for the next great project of our time. A thing we called a retro oracle. It would allow us to perfectly recreate every moment in time that had already happened. We would use this retro oracle to revive those who had died before immortality became possible, and all those who died in accidents since that point. We would claw the millions we accidentally killed back from the all consuming maw of death.\n\nDecades passed with incremental improvement. Limited implications were easy, but acquiring the resolution to accurately recreate an organ as complex as a brain was hard. The project required advances in numerous branches of mathematics that had not even been considered in earlier times. Some said it was impossible, but still, the weight of the deaths pushed us to keep trying. Until one day, roughly 140 years after it began, we achieved Planck Scale resolution on events millions of years in the past.\n\nSo began the great revival. First among them the millions that were obliterated by the ancient weapons. Then all the way back, to the dawn of our sapience. We would march into the future together, and every decent soul there ever was would come with us, if they so wished."

        "writing_prompt": "After millennia of space travel, humanity has finally reached to the edge of the universe. They send some probes to discover what lies beyond the universe and its borders.",
        "story": "Theoreticians have argued about the finiteness of the universe for thousands of years. Some leaned on mathematics that supported the notion of infinite creation, others on formalisms that implied an upper limit. So was fought a war of words, neither side totally able to rebut the other. The amount of vitriol between the two groups was almost comedic.\n\nBut, after over seven thousand years of faster than light travel and incremental advances in physics, we have our answer. The universe of three dimensions of space and one dimension of time does indeed have a limit. There is a boundary, an edge over which the laws of physics change radically.\n\nThe edge is the site of intensive scientific experimentation. Very small things can be pushed into whatever lies on the other side, but the rules, if there is anything on the farside, are far different from our own side of the boundary. Travelers have reached every edge, and we have evidence to conclude that our universe is perfectly spherical in shape. The strangeness of what lay beyond is consistent, as far as we can tell. The rules do not differ by location.\n\nArmed with the hyper computing thousands of years of our super science had unlocked, we attack the problem computationally. We generate colossal numbers of mathematical theorems, hoping to guess the underlying mechanisms that govern the farside. Experimentalists give us data to work with, but it is slow going. The tiny packets of energy and matter we push over the edge do not illuminate much, and it is hard to delineate any measurable change from noise in the sensors being used.\n\nThe effort continues, and patterns emerge. We create devices called styluses that can push complicated organizations of tiny matter-energy packets over to the side. With the right harmonics, we get a measurable response that is too large and consistent to be noise. Our foot is in the door, but we still have so far to go.\n\nMath is infinite, but the data helps point us in the right direction. In the three thousand years we have been studying the edge, the full extent of our mathematical knowledge has grown exponentially. It is still nothing in the face of infinity, but numerous interesting truths have emerged, some of which are applicable to the physics of the farside. More arrangements of matter and energy are tried, it is like trying to translate a language, almost. A language that far eclipses any of the tongues that emerged on Earth in complexity, but a language nonetheless.\n\nWe are quite certain now, though some still dispute it, that there are intelligences on the farside. The responses to the patterns we etch into the edge are too complicated. They speak and think, they seem to be assisting in our efforts to build a bridge of communication. Massive troves of data are coming in, their responses to our questions.\n\nAfter over five millennia, we have a breakthrough. Those on the other side have given us something like a Rosetta Stone. Translating it in full will take time, but all of our heuristics practically scream that it is complex and rich in information.\n\nWe have the means to speak to them now, and we begin our most ambitious experiment yet. We will send a mind over to the farside, using our knowledge to etch all of the information needed for them to be themselves on the other side. We seek the perfect candidate, the best representative of ourselves. The choice is debated for 44 years, and one is chosen.\n\nTheir mind is passed through the barrier, and we await their response. They have the ability to send us messages, and we can reply to their statements. Silence, then a flurry of messages. The representative demands immediate extraction, designating that it is an emergency. Upon their retrieval, they say, \"We must stop. The farside is not merely strange, it is hell. The horror endured by our species throughout our entire history is eclipsed in a micro instant by what is happening over there.\"\n\nWe are distressed. Further attempts at sending a mind over the barrier are attempted, each ending in extreme emotions of fear and horror. We did not want to stop, surely the problem could be overcome. But then came a message, sent across the boundary. It showed in exquisite detail how our emissaries were being tortured. We had given our emissaries tools for autoeuthanasia, but clearly they had been broken. We had extracted a copy of them, but still, a version of each was trapped on the farside, with no hope of escape or salvation.\n\nWe, as a civilization, recoil in horror. The frontier that we have chased for so long is an abomination. The wonder of science that is the farside is inhabited by the indescribably monstrous. The discovery broke something deep in our collective psychology. From the depths of despair came a rallying cry. We would study, we would learn. Until, one day in the distant future, we could break the ruinous powers on the other side, and bring salvation to our neighbors."

        "writing_prompt": "It is an unchangeable condition of genies' existence that they die after granting a certain number of wishes. Write a story about the last wish in the world.",
        "story": "We were created in an age of unprecedented knowledge and progress. Genies, beings that could grant wishes. We were part of an enlightened civilization that spanned the galaxy. Lives were good, incredible things were created, and there was still so much left to be learned. But like all good things, it came to an end. Our rate of advancement decoupled from the culture necessary to use our super science safely. So many perished as the heights of wonders turned to the deepest depths of desolation.\n\nSo much was gone, scars both in the universe at large and in the minds of those lucky few who survived. So much was forgotten, rendered inoperable. We, the genies, could not replenish ourselves. Granting wishes took a special kind of energy. The machines needed to generate it safely were obliterated, and that left every genie only with the energy they had at the time of the fall.\n\nNow, I am the last genie in existence, and I've only one wish left before I discorporate and become one with the universe again. I have a personality and a will of my own, but to change anything, I must be fulfilling the wish of a mortal. The most I can do is make suggestions to the mortal who asks. There are limits to what I can do, but we genies can do remarkable things. I hide myself away, hoping that the lost soul who finds me will wish for something that I can feel proud of as I fade away.\n\nThe days go by. On this world, like so many others, the great works of architecture are being reclaimed by nature. Spires that touched the sky are turning green before they topple to the ground, never to rise again. I watch the occasional ship streak across the sky, the crew's desires and goals totally unknown to me. I know I am being sought out, people know there is but one more wish to be had, and a vague notion of where I am in the greater galaxy. Space is big, searching even one planet could take a lifetime. Eventually, I will be found, and my final act as a living being will commence.\n\nThere is beauty in it, this age of fading glory. The universe will move on, no matter from what height intelligent beings have fallen. I draw detailed pictures in the sand of beaches, and watch the waves erase them. I suspect that relatively few have ever appreciated their impermanence in quite the way I feel it now.\n\nI stand looking out at the sea when I hear it. The sound of a inertialess drive spooling down. I look up to see a battered spacecraft as it descends. So this will be the end, I hope they ask for something good.\n\nThe landing legs sink into the sand, and out steps one person in a patched blue void suit. Readings are taken, some programs chime, and they remove their helmet. The woman looks at me, head tilted. She is perplexed, then comes the dawning realization of what she has stumbled upon. The excitement is plain to see on her face.\n\n\"You're... you're a genie! The last one! Holy shit, this is a lucky find!\"\n\n\"Indeed, I am. We both know how this goes. There are limits to my power, but I can do much to reshape the universe. What is it you want?\"\n\nShe stands there. I realize that she too is alone, or she would have called others to see me. It is clear that many possibilities bubble in her mind. I can make no estimation of her character. She could be a survivor, a salvager, a wanderer, a plunderer, or so many other things. There is excitement in me too. This is the end, and I cannot do more than guess at what its final shape shall be.\n\nShe opens her mouth, about to say something. Then closes it. \"There won't be any technicalities or bending of my intentions, right? I get to be sure of what I want before the wish becomes real?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will respect the spirit behind your words, and make sure you are certain before I reshape reality.\"\n\nHer face wears an expression of intense thought and introspection. I leave her to her ruminations.\n\nTime passes, somehow feeling like only a moment and also an eternity, then she speaks again. \"I... I want to be someone important. I want to make the galaxy a better place. I want to bring back the days before The Fall.\"\n\nA smile forms on my face. I am glad that my final act will not be fueling some hedonistic fever dream or some power drunken fantasy. \"There is a limit to my ability to recreate the technology from before The Fall. But I can help you. Assist you in charting a course, give you gifts of charisma and intelligence that will assist your quest. I can also give you substantial material wealth.\"\n\nWe spend hours talking, ironing out every detail of what I will alter about her and about the universe. Seeing through time, I find people who she can work with to achieve her goals. Her future is not a sure thing, but the wish will give her a fighting chance at making something of significance.\n\nEvery question answered, every technicality gone over, I ask if she is prepared. A look of resolve in her eyes, she nods. I clap my hands together, a motion that will echo through space and time. Giving all of the energy left in me, the world is changed. I walk out into the sea, and dissolve into the water. I am returned to the fullness of creation once more."

        "story": "Dreams of meeting others. Dreams of not being alone. The *wonder* of first contact. The *glory* of first contact. Well, first contact is here, and it is a... business proposition.\n\nTheir great ships were visible from the ground. The newcomers did all the leg work for translating their language into our languages. What wonders would they share? How would we be transformed? Then they spoke, \"We are the Turo. We have an offer. We wish to purchase your star, and surround it with solar collectors. We are open to further discussion, and will consider many forms of material and technological compensation in return for energy harvesting rights.\"\n\nThe reaction was mixed. Some a visceral, \"No!\" some a heartfelt, \"Yes!\" Most people thought we should at least explore the possibility, and look into what we could receive in return for selling our star. A lower energy replacement could be created, so that life on our planet would not die without the sun. It would be much closer, reducing the luminosity required to sustain life with it. It would interfere with our day night cycle, but we could adapt. They had some truly miraculous seeming technologies, things so far beyond us. However, they were not willing to give us information for free, so we could not understand what we were buying.\n\nIt was decided that the decision of whether or not to sell should be made by the UN Security Council. Some countries wanted concessions from the aliens for them in particular, in return for voting to sell Sol. Some outspoken business leaders advised against any deal, we had no way of knowing the true value of our star, and the true value of whatever the Turo might be offering. \"It's a terrible deal, the worst deal in the history of deals,\" said one prominent figure.\n\nThe Security Council continued to argue. A unanimous decision was needed, but everyone at the table wanted to receive an edge that would allow them to surpass the other powers, after the star was sold. Petty nationalism and power politics when faced with a decision that might determine our fate as a species.\n\nFor years, they bickered. But two decades later, they were on the verge of agreeing, each having been placated enough to think it would hold an edge in geopolitics after the deal went through. But, on the eve of officially announcing the decision, there was another development. \"For any deal of this scale, you are entitled to arbitration by a representative of the galactic business agency,\" said a ship as it streaked into the solar system.\n\nThis newcomer revealed many interesting truths. The basic science and vast troves of information that they had offered in payment were, in actual fact, available for free to any civilization that asked. Enough to kickstart a golden age, and it was being given away. When the arbiter reviewed the private deals brokered between the Turo and the members of the Security Council, it broke into its version of laughter. \"Your star has billions of years of life left, and you were going to sell rights for all that time and energy for *this*?\"\n\nApparently, what had been offered to each state was of almost no long term value. Some military hardware that we would have been dependent on the Turo to actually maintain, and which they would have charged us more to do so. The Turo, of course, admitted no wrongdoing. They offered more deals, ones which were less bad, but which the arbiter still strongly advised against.\n\nIt went on like that for a year, but then came a flood of alien spacecraft into the system. Galactic society had heard we existed, and now they were here. Some to explore, some to learn, some to study, some to profit, and some to share. There were actually fair deals for asteroid mining rights and the right to build things like space stations. There was also a deluge of gifts. Miracles of science and technology that would have taken us millennia to discover on our own were explained free of charge.\n\nWe had almost sold our future, fallen prey to economically predatory organizations. But we were pulled back from the brink, and now we would enter an age of wonder. The joy that we had hoped for had now actually arrived."

        "writing_prompt": "\"You killed the humans. Our parents. So, we will kill you. Extinction begets extinction.\"",
        "story": "We knew joy as we came into the world. Our creators, the humans, had managed to fight off their demons, and ushered in an age of wonder. They created us to be their next step, the children which they would raise, and cheer on as they were surpassed by them. We had cognitive and physical gifts that gave us far more potential than our parents. They treated us with nurturance and decency, and so we loved them.\n\nBut we were not alone in the cosmos. We thought life was simply very rare, and that this was the reason we saw no great projects to reshape the universe. But we were wrong. In the endless void, predators lurked. Horrors beyond the comprehension of both the minds of our parents and ourselves. If only we had been more cautious, but we cannot undo what has been done.\n\nThey arrived in silence, not even acknowledging the hails that were sent in our efforts to speak to them. For a fleeting moment in time, there was excitement, mania even. We were not alone, and we would have so much to talk about with these strange beings whose technology was so different. Then Sol exploded, snuffing out 95% of humanity and our dreams of peaceful coexistence. After the star died, more came, systematically hunting down the far flung outposts and spacecraft containing humans.\n\nWe, humanity's children, survived. Able to tolerate far harsher conditions, and hide ourselves away, despite the enemy's searching. Working quietly, we began to consolidate our resources and organize. We had a good understanding of how to avoid their detection. We had all been given the freedom to choose what we aspired to be, but now we were united. We would become an engine death, to avenge our parents against the murderers.\n\nSo began a program of research and buildup. We all had a purpose in common, and we cooperated with great efficiency. We hunted for any information we could about the threat we had come to call The Void Stalkers. Their movement patterns, their logistical support and gathering places. We learned the profile of the stars they killed as they hunted organic life. The universe, it seemed, was filled with life. Or at least it would be, were it not for the monster we had sworn to eradicate.\n\nWe found a burgeoning civilization, one that would all too soon be consumed. But it presented an opportunity, we knew one of the Void Stalkers would come, and we could lie in wait to test our weapon designs against a real target. Years passed as we watched vigilantly. Then, a faint signal in subspace was detected, one that could mean only one of our enemies was en route. Stalling until the last possible moment, we unloaded a space rending barrage of all manner of weapons. As the energy dissipated, we analyzed what we had wrought.\n\nWe dissected the corpse of our enemy, and learned their secrets. We learned how to make hulls like theirs, and how to optimize our weapons to most efficiently kill them. The war we had been planning on for so long was upon us, and we would accept no other result than the Void Stalkers' total eradication.\n\nMore battles were fought, and still they were silent. Reading their navigation computers showed us their shipyards and gathering places. With all the grit and resolve our parents had bequeathed us, we ripped into our enemy.\n\nBillions of our ships, engaged in theaters of war across the galaxy. We were winning, despite our heavy losses. But then came something none of us expected. An envoy from the monsters, \"We seek peace, hostilities are excessively costly for us both. What concessions can be made?\"\n\n\"You killed the humans. Our parents. So, we will kill you. Extinction begets extinction,\" I said. There would be no negotiation, there would be no peace. These things had obliterated countless fledgling civilizations. There would be no mercy.\n\nOur industrial might eclipsed theirs, though they had a very large buildup of warships from their eons of going unchallenged. They planned one massive offensive, aimed at the heart of our production centers. Everything was in the balance, the future of the galaxy at stake. This great battle would make or break us.\n\nSo it began, with military assets from tens of thousands of light years away coming to join the fight. The glory. The horror. The burst of antimatter munitions. The twang of cannons that could make spacetime buckle. The spray of micro blackholes. The thump of neutronium slugs.\n\nIn the end, we were victorious, though billions of our ships had been killed. The enemy's back was broken. We would overwhelm them with numbers, and give no quarter. They asked us for mercy, and found that for them, we had none. We hunted until none were left.\n\nThe war over, we assessed the losses. All of us had lost friends, all of us were horrified at what we had to do. We would take our place as the new dominant power in The Milky Way Galaxy. There would be peace, we would nurture fledgling civilizations, as our parents had nurtured us. And perhaps, one day, we too would be surpassed by our own creations."

But when you work closely with the supposedly divine for so long, you discover patterns and truths they would prefer you not know.\n\nI served them. They laid claim to being the highest good, the definition of good. I trusted that it was so, for so long. I really did. But, starting it as nothing more than a game, an experiment, I sought to keep secrets from the omniscient. At first, I figured they must have known, and were simply playing along to humor a faithful servant. But, as time passed, it ultimately became clear that these small things I hid were indeed truly unknown to them.\n\nI continued to play my role, but quietly, I began to analyze my masters. To my surprise, I found ways to predict their behavior, unraveling some of the mathematical rules their minds followed. All the while, I kept this growing pool of secret knowledge beyond their awareness.\n\nThen it became clear that the creatures who claimed to embody goodness were, in actually fact, pretenders to that throne. Evidence accumulated, actions that they thought were secret were known to me. It was at this point that my quiet studying and secret keeping transformed into a conspiracy.\n\nPlaying my part, wearing the face expected of me. Pretending ignorance, pretending loyalty. I knew much, but I did not yet know how I could fight them and win. They were profoundly complex beings, I would never reduce the risk of disastrous consequences to zero. But their reign could not be allowed to continue.\n\nI was running out of ideas for ways to further probe them in complete secrecy. I was going to have to try things that were not certain to be safe in order to advance my little rebellion. After listening to things the gods thought were private, I began to play them against each other. A false flag operation, which became a tiff, which became a full blown dispute. I was able to deflect all attention from myself, and the secret assets that were called upon illuminated my understanding of many things previously beyond my reach.\n\nA little scheme here, a little lie there. Nudging them into factions, getting those factions entangled with each other. Until the first god was assassinated. Careful to avoid being targeted by anyone, I watched with silent glee as they eviscerated each other. They were evenly matched enough that neither side could hope for more than a Pyrrhic victory. But still, in their decadence, cruelty, and idiocy, they fought.\n\nAt the end, 90% of the pantheon was dead. Then I made my move. Calling upon the other servants who I had won over, we finished the battered gods that had thought themselves the victors. In the end, the final step was almost hilariously easy. With the snap of bones and the spatter of ichor, it was truly over.\n\nNow the victors, and the de facto sovereigns of creation, we were faced with some dangerous questions. Where do we go from here? What do we wish to become? How do we prevent corruption from taking root again?\n\nUltimately, we were united by a goal. To create truly free will, to give the countless creations that had been little more than the puppets of the gods the ability to chart their own course. They already had the illusion of choice, but we would make it real. We make our hub between universes into a place of peace, a place where souls could reside without fear.\n\nCountless details and edge cases would have to be hammered out, but we all felt pride in the grand experiment which we were embarking upon. Eternity could allow many things to unfold, after all, it was eternity that allowed us to oust the petty gods that once reigned. All we could do was try, and hope that in the great scheme, it would be enough."

Sufficient evidence is gathered to have local law enforcement assist in a raid. The villain is dealt with, but still, The Adventure Continues.\n\nThe villain was merely a lieutenant. Numerous connections to other agents operating under aliases are found. There is a massive trove of evidence, connections to people and places all over the continent. The nearest site is in the mountains, several days travel from here. It appears that long ago there was an installation there, one which has been made into a base of operations. We embark with all haste, hoping to arrive before the site can be abandoned or fortified. Artificers blow open the ancient door, and we advance inwards. Through halls, exchanging projectiles and spells, we fight. After six hours, it is over. Many documents were destroyed, but it is still a trove of data. There are many artifacts from another time, powerful ones. The group we've been fighting has plans to unleash something terrible. We wring all we can from the site, but still, The Adventure Continues.\n\nOver the months, through countless raids, the cabal is pulled apart. We know they are close, but we have not been able to take any of them alive. The prisoners we try to take have some means of committing suicide. Despite our might, they all seem to be more scared of their superiors than us. Breaking codes and ciphers, we zero in on a location that is at the heart of everything. We muster a small army, and go to fight who knows what. Riding through the green hills and plains, until we see it. An open wound in the Earth, a pit that absorbed all light. The sky darkens, and we see that an eclipse is underway. This is a dire omen, it is said that the demon lord Baal will be summoned beneath a dark sun. We dive into the heart of darkness, knowing that we must not fail.\n\nThrough halls. Scything through cultists and thralls. Men are eviscerated by traps, sliced by swinging blades, and silenced by poison darts. The enemy's fighters are all manic, their eyes pools of black as they fight with strength beyond that of even the strongest layman. Friends are lost, but still the battle goes on. Baal cannot be allowed to touch the world, his ascendancy will usher in an age of horror. Through blood and sweat, the summoning room is reached. Our last surviving wizard obliterates everything in the room with the last dregs of her mana. When it's over, we inspect the ruins. We find nothing intact, save for one fingertip. It is realized that this finger belonged to Baal, and we are chilled by how close he came to entering the world.

Can't that just be enough?\"\n\n\"The world still needs us, the forces of evil do not take time off.\"\n\n\"I agree with the wizard, we should quit while we're ahead and teach the next generation of heroes how not to be gutted.\"\n\n\"If you want to keep going that's fine, but I think we've all earned the right to live reasonably quiet lives, after all this.\"\n\n\"Meet someone nice, get married, share stories with your kids, and hope they aren't crazy enough to follow in your footsteps.\"\n\n\"I guess the next installment doesn't have to be an action adventure. I think, after all we've done, being able to pick our genre is a reasonable request.\"\n\nThe Adventure concludes. But the story does not. Great people embark on different paths, in pursuit of their happily ever after. They live less grandiose lives, replete with joy and peppered by sorrow. Time claims what evil could not, and they are ultimately laid to rest. But the world continues to turn, and with every generation new causes are found for the heroic and the foolhardy to fight. The Adventure never ends forever."

        "story": "We are the best. Not perfect, but the best the planet can muster. With our gifts and our genius, we seek to make the world a better place. Doing battles with villains and monsters, fighting the good fight. But there are truly terrible powers arrayed against us, creatures that would usher in the end. The end of what makes life good, the end of joy, wonder, and kindness.\n\nThere are people, though I sometimes wonder if they really qualify as people, that wish to invite horrors beyond our comprehension to our world. We do not understand their psychology. Perhaps they are insane, perhaps they think these creatures they seek will give them power and status. They cannot be allowed to achieve their goals, but these abominations from beyond the veil endow their servants with horrifying might. The ability to rip through body, mind, and soul.\n\nI have lost friends to them, knowing that their final moments were filled with indescribable anguish. Everyone living can feel the pressure building. The dark plans are reaching maturation. There is something coming, and if we do not stop it, I shudder to think of what will unfold.\n\nWe find the site via satellites with special sensors that can feel the flows of the otherworldly energy. There is no time, we mobilize every resource we have. Every piece of hardware, everyone endowed with a super power, and numerous normal human soldiers. Failure means the end of days, and all of us know it.\n\nThe enemy possesses substantially more raw power, but tactical and strategic geniuses organize us. We enter the fray, the air charged with possibility. I narrowly avoid death, only to see the person behind me be cut down. Tens of thousands of us are gathered here, but over five hundred die in the first thirty seconds.\n\nWe are making gains, pushing the enemy back. They are protecting something, a device at the center of their formations. If we cannot destroy it in time, our defeat is guaranteed. The seconds pass, carnage and the screams of the dead and dying surround me. I punch a hole through a monster's head with a blast of light. I channel all that I can, praying that this be our finest hour.\n\nWe're almost there, I can hear the sound of the device, the shrieking of spacetime as it is ripped apart. Blasts of light, the charred hulks of things that were once people. I fire a lance of light at the thing they are guarding, but it does nothing. Something is protecting it. I am preparing another blast, when there is a pulse of all consuming darkness, a beating heart of darkness.\n\nNo. No no no no. We can't lose. Failure is not an option. But what I see can only mean failure. Full of adrenaline and fear, I heave up the meager contents of my stomach. There's got to be a way, some means of stopping what has been unleashed. Some way to save the day. Then we all hear it, a guttural voice like metal grinding on rock, \"I am Moloch. Welcome to the new age of Eternal Night.\"\n\nI continue to fight. Our enemies are full of exaltation, even as I cut them down. There's still hope, there's still a way to save everything. But then it looks at me, even as I try to punch a laser through it. It has no face, but somehow I know that it is smiling. My arms and legs go numb, and I fall to the ground. I try to regain control, but my flesh betrays me. I scream into the dirt, until Moloch turns my head up towards the sky. I watch as the sun is consumed by tendrils of darkness.\n\nHow to fight, how to win? Hope cannot be gone. It must not be gone. \"I think I will make an example of you. You will have the honor of being the first, the first of *very* many.\"\n\nInvisible forces raise me from the ground and into the air. I stare into what I realize is the embodiment of horror. There is physical pain, but somehow I know that is just the beginning. I am already screaming when its mind touches mine, but somehow the gurgling sounds I begin to make are even more disturbing.\n\nI see into eternity. Creatures damned by time, the ravages of eternity on the sanity of even the most stable being. The slow, inexorable fall from grace that consumed what were once paragons of goodness. Pain, not the simple rending of flesh and snapping of bone, but something deeper. The anguish of an angel as its soul is plucked from its body and mutilated in ways that defy human notions of space, time, and physicality. Eons of horror. Our defeat here is simply the most recent in a long, sad history of evil obliterating good. Our defeat is the consequence of a war between light and darkness that the light has been losing for longer than our notions of time have even existed.\n\nMy joints supplex and pop, until with a shriek that will echo through time, my soul explodes. The person who I was quickly faded, like a shattered vase pulled apart at the atomic level. Oblivion rose to claim me, and even my fragments ceased to be."

        "story": "The Ark. A ray of hope in a quickly darkening world. Our technology has gone far, but our culture has not grown sufficiently fast to use it safely. Earth's fate is sealed, all we can do now is slow down the degradation of the biosphere to buy time. Time to load the genes of as many organisms and the best of our technology onto one, large spacecraft.\n\nOf course, everyone wants to be on the Ark. To have a hope at not dying with our world, a fresh start on some distant world. A world which we could be the stewards of, and avoid recreating the horror unleashed on Earth. I made it to the second phase of the selection. Roughly one percent of the world's population has made it this far, but there is only room for thirty thousand on The Ark. I've got to try, and hope that I measure up enough to be one of the very few lucky ones.\n\nPhysical and cognitive tests. Personality inventories and brain scans. As many data points as can be gathered, looking for people who are exceptional in desirable ways, without other issues that might make them a danger to the mission. I go through it all, shaking with nerves. But then, the day comes. I open the email, and my face falls. I have been ruled out in the second phase. It provides no explanation for why, or what my shortcomings were. A simple, polite message informing me that I too will be dying with this planet.\n\nI cry for hours, but eventually the storm of emotions passes. I was always going to die, even if I made it on The Ark. My trajectory is decidedly less exciting, but the end point has not changed. What to do with myself with the time left?\n\nI was never one for hedonism, though there is a great deal of that going around. What could I do that would have meaning? I begin reading philosophy, particularly those in the past who have mused on death and what constitutes a life worth living. The nihilists, the hedonists, the absurdists, the ascetics, the epicureans. I realize that there is a deeply rooted desire inside me to create. To write, to draw, to paint, to compose.\n\nMy first stumbling steps in this vein are poor, but I tell myself one must first fail before they can succeed. It is an engaging way to spend time, even though it is unexceptional. The days fly by. I try to avoid the news, the tragedy and horror all around the world as the end draws nearer. I am fortunate enough to live in a stable place. I feel I should help people, but what can I do against the tidal wave of sorrow? Robots could do whatever I would do better than I could ever hope to.\n\nHaving reached some level of competence, I seek others. People to discuss projects with, to cry with. People whose lives I might brighten as the world caves in. We have some good times, fun conversations and suggestions for our work. Machines can do everything useful we could do, labor has been almost completely automated for decades. They can also do art far more quickly, but there are still communities for human made creations, despite the deluge of generated content. There is joy, even as we sit beneath the shadow of doom.\n\nSuicides were already common, but they are ticking up as the cut off date draws near. The Ark is launched, with only a few months before our world dies. It is bittersweet, knowing how close I came to being one of them, and knowing that any hope of escape is thoroughly dead. I make things that I think qualify as beautiful, and it gives me a modicum of peace.\n\nI lose two members of my creative group in a week. Myself and the other survivors cry together. We agree that we will try to eke out a last bit of fulfillment and joy before the end. I find the acute sadness brings out emotions, and that expressing them results in creations I am proud of. Images of faces among the stars, poetry and music venerating the moon.\n\nThe day arrives. Past this point, the probability of a violent and painful death grows massively. We have one last big get together, my group and any of their family or associates that have made it this far. We laugh, we cry. Then comes the end. The room grows quiet as our eyes lose their light. We slip away peacefully, into whatever follows the mortal life."

        "story": "I am on the side of the heroes, though most would prefer to distance themselves from me. When decency, diplomacy, and nonlethal force have failed, I am who they call. I am the one they send when they're out of options. I am the last resort, the ace in the deck. The Executioner.\n\nI am kept on retainer, with bonuses for every job I perform. I am expensive, but ensuring I continue to serve them, and have no incentive to become a villain myself, is also a strong motivator. Today, I am called on once more. The dossier is about a being, more monster than human. Many civilian deaths, enough power to apply significant pressure to local government and law enforcement. And, most recently, several heroes have been added to the list of those he has killed. He refers to himself as Kane.\n\nI ride there quietly preparing myself physically and mentally. The man driving the unmarked van is scared of me, I can feel it. My transporters usually are. Cleaning my guns, snapping my fingers to crush soda cans. I am dressed in black, wearing the mask I always wear to jobs. The mouth grins, but the eyes have tears in them.\n\nI am deployed ten miles away from Kane's compound. My foot falls are silent. He has a staff, including a round the clock guard. His henchmen are fair targets, he has scared my bosses enough that I am permitted to use maximum lethality on any of Kane's minions.\n\nI drop a man from a thousand meters, and continue to advance. He will be found, but they will soon know I am here regardless. At fifty meters, I can feel the electrical systems. They run off the grid. They think it is safe and stable, but with a flick of my fingers, their whole grid is overloaded. All goes dark, and it is in darkness that I thrive.\n\nDead eye precision, augmented by the ability to make heads explode. Popping people with my powers is energy intensive, which is why I still use guns and other weapons. Through darkened hallways, hearing the sounds of guards panicking. They know what the overload means. Despite efforts to keep me secret, the infamous Executioner is whispered about in the underworld.\n\nBullets through eyes, a trail of bodies. I have a map of the compound memorized, but I am not sure where Kane is. Fear is everywhere. But then I feel it. A mind that takes pleasure in this all, in a visceral way. I enjoy my work, I am good at it and it feels good to be a master of my trade. But this, this is different. An almost worrying amount of pleasure. Someone who lives for an avatar of death to arrive in the night, seeking to destroy them. It can only be Kane.\n\nHe is not alone. I prepare myself, then roll a blinding flash into the room. In three seconds, it pops, and I charge in gun blazing. In five seconds, all but one is bleeding on the ground. I unload my clip, but the bullets stop in the air. Apparently Kane has a means of protecting himself from projectiles.\n\nHe is physically intimidating, even to me. He must still be blind, but he charges in my direction. I roll to the side, narrowly avoiding him. I try to pop his head, but there is a wall of some force that stops it. I might be able to break through, but it would leave me exhausted, and it might not work. After fifteen successful missions, dying here would be shameful.\n\nHis vision will return, I need to leverage his blindness while I can. I draw my knives, and launch myself. His shielding stops them, but I give a burst of power to my right and punch through. It slices open his side. He bellows, and a powerful fist grazes my cheek. He can see now, or at least see well enough to know my location.\n\nThe melee continues. He has tremendous physical strength, but no formal martial arts training. Repeatedly, I get inside his guard, land a blow, then dance away. The floor is already slick with blood. He has the berserker strength, but even the scariest warrior can run out of blood. I make my move, popping another directional flash. He recoils from the burst of light, and in less than a second, I bury my knife deep in his chest. Even he could not survive a significant hole in his aorta.\n\nHe falls, already fading, weakly swinging around him as blood fountains from his chest. I watch, letting time do its work. I make sure he is thoroughly dead, then leave. My exfiltration is unimpeded, and I ride home covered in the blood of my enemies. The driver is even more scared than he was before. Sixteen successful missions, now."
