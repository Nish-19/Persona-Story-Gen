        "writing_prompt": "\"you killed my father\", the young child cried, \"I will kill you\" \"Not now,\" the villian said, \"Train and come find me in ten years\"",
        "story": "Still, the kid tried. Jumped forward, dodged autonomous bots tried over and over to hit the villain - in vain. The world watched in silence while the offspring of the most powerful hero tried, over and over again, to hit - no, not really - to *get close* to Cyssna, the greatest villain that ever existed, in vain.\n\nThe fight ended in seconds, but for the kid, it appeared to be like hours. None of the father's otherworldly powers where transferred to the kid, and the villain knew that. The kid was as human as a human can be.\n\n*Train and come find me in ten years* Cyssna said. The words echoing for ages, while the kid, not a kid anymore, trained.\n\nThe world changed that day, somehow for the better. Cyssna wasn't terrorizing cities anymore; with his robots, his technology, and his power to control mechanical stuff at will, the city prospered, the air was clean, the water was sparkling, and people didn't have any needs for superheroes or supervillains. They were as stable that they could be, under the iron steel of the Great Dictator Cyssna.\n\nLiving in luxury, most people forgot. The fights, the honors, the life they lived before. Some started to understand that the hero was against the progress, the wonderful utopia they lived.\n\nOthers simply forgot the hero altogether.\n\nStill, the years passed. *Train an come find me*. Not only the teenager trained, but also studied. Sociology; politics; technology; all that could be learned, was learned. All that the human body could do, the teenager trained. All for the sake of a single phrase:\n\n*Train and come find me in ten years*\n\nSo, ten years have passed. Cyssna opened his doors to the young adult. He sat in a chair, and invited his adversary to do the same.\n\nThey talked for hours. Where he asked the child for understanding, that it was a necessary step. One single life, for the sake of everyone. For a place where people that wanted to make things better could be doing exactly that, and people that didn't want to help would be better of dead.\n\n*Now, you understand me, right? You understand my reasons? I see in your eyes that you do. I see that we're finally in agreement*. That was the voice, the last words. Both mechanical and humanoid, singing in harmony. The child nodded, in agreement.\n\nThen, Cyssna was at his knees. Looking around, he could not see anything anymore, for all lights, all monitors, everything was gone - there was just darkness around palpable, suffocating.\n\nA quick slash, and he could feel his body disappearing. Switching to infrared vision, he could see the young adult, a weird sword in hands, prepared for the last strike, where his head was.\n\n*You had your reasons, Cyssna. Unfortunately, the kingdom of God is within man.*\n\n*Chaplin? That's the person that made you decide for chaos, instead of peace?* - but the child of a hero wasn't listening\n\n*Not one man*\n\nThe sword slashed through the head of Cyssna, opening the circuits that were once his brain - one that long ago, he enhanced with electronic parts\n\n*Not a group of men*\n\nThe child found the main processor inside the head, and with a swift motion, sliced it in half, covering the remains of the head, and the body, in flame to be sure nobody would be able to restore it\n\n*But in* ***all men!***\n\nWith this, the whole facility started to fail, a cascading destruction triggered by hidden bombs in particular places, overwhelming the system with electricity so that it would destroy the lair from within.\n\nAnd withing seconds, the child of the hero was gone. To this day, there's only a huge crater where the old lair existed, and nobody remembers the children's name, physical appearance, or even the father's name.\n\nWe all know that chaos ensured after that, and we had to organize ourselves. We found out that the \"worst of us\" - the ones that Cyssna tossed aside - were the ones with the best ideas to rebuild our land.\n\nWe're still worse than we were. But I learned something very valuable on that day, when I was still a young kid watching in horror our savior's home exploding in a thousand pieces, and the gasps of horror of everyone when we found out our way of life was gone.\n\nI learned to care about others. I learned that just because I was never exposed to the horrible conditions of the \"undesirables\", it didn't make these less real.\n\nI learned we all have to thrive, together, as a group. And that a single person can't decide what's good or bad.\n\nAnd when I miss the old luxury days I learn, over and over again, how scary and disgusting I am - for I was willing to throw others to the fire, just to make things better to me, alone."

        "writing_prompt": "Your time machine malfunctions and you're sent to an unknown year. When you tell a bystander that you're from the year 2024, their face grows pale and their eyes grow wide.",
        "story": "\\- \"You did say... 2024? The year 2024? Which month?\" - the woman asked me.\n\n\\- \"October. Final days. Why? Is it... bad?\" - but I could not start any other sentence, till a foot was driven to my stomach, kicking me over and over. Luckily I was able to roll away, and run with all my might, and luckily, I found that the man could not run as well. Looking around me, a concentration of people started running in my direction, screaming.\n\nThat was when I finally discovered I was at the future. A very, *very far* future, for people were communicating with some weird device, and their screams where not in English, or Spanish, or any of the four more common languages that existed in 2024. Not even a dialect - they sounded more like grunts.\n\nSomehow, that's when I started to have... well, for the lack of a better word, visions. A ghost at my side, a flash of pure white light at my front, things that resembled animals jumping away from the corner of my eyes... somehow I was able to hear someone saying my name (how?) and then he quickly offered me his home to hide.\n\nHe gave me something to eat. The taste was atrocious, but at least it was something... I felt I didn't eat in ages, even though supposedly there should be only minutes since I found my way at this place. He started to grunt and scream, but then somehow remembered something and then he was speaking in pure perfect English.\n\nBut it was wrong. By being \"too right\", if that makes sense. No errors, no pronunciation problems, no pauses or anything - just... like, it was if he wanted to say something, he had an idea, and the words just formed, perfectly, with no grammar error at all and just the *right amount* of nuance, feeling, intonation, to perfectly express what he wanted to say, so that there was not doubt about his intentions **at all**. There was not a single trace of sarcasm, of lying, of anything that would divert his words from the pure, absolute truth. It was... haunting. Like I was speaking with a robot...\n\n\\- \"Can you be sure you weren't?\" - my superior asks. I sigh. I knew this would happen, but somehow... it's exhausting.\n\n\\- \"Sir\", I answer - \"I cannot explain to you why, but that person was clearly human. I saw his wounds. I saw his face. Even though his voice was clear, there was way too much suffering and sadness in that person. Acceptance, too, like this was his life, and it was going to stay that way, forever\"\n\nAnd so I was again, haunted, by the things he showed me. He dressed me like a commoner, and informed me that I was at the wastelands - which covered more than 80% of the planet. He asked me about the past, about the super-rich, which we call the \"one percent\", as I told him. He cried at the word \"one percent\". I asked him why.\n\n\\- \"Because we have 'the ten'\"\n\n\\- \"Oh, so most of the money is at the hands of 10% of population?\"\n\n\\- \"No, my friend. We have ten people **in the whole world** that keeps all money. Not 'most money' - **all of it**. They trade between themselves, and they feed on the rest of us. They live their lives in luxury places, things that we can't imagine that exist, and that we only know about it because they throw their own children under these wastelands if they don't like them. And it have been the same ten people since they discovered how not to die. And that's all your fault. Well, not yours, but the people from your time.\"\n\nAnd that's where it hit me.\n\nWe did everything wrong, over and over again. Ignored biological threats, technical monstrosities, illegal power-hungry individuals like politicians, rich people, CEOs, and even countries, for the sake of \"progress\". We kept this in such a way that we allowed people to think it's \"normal\" to not own anything, to not be in charge of our own privacy, that it's a choice to write off our own liberty, our rights, just for the sake of convenience. We ignored that for far too much time, and we were going to keep this cycle of ignorance, until we found another huge leap in technology, biology, and bio-engineering, such that we won't die anymore.\n\nAnd by \"we\", I mean \"the ultra rich\". For this tech will never fall into hands of the common people.\n\nThe \"ghosts\" I saw were part of a huge neural network, in the literal sense - one that connected directly to my brain, to the brain of everyone, so that they can access anything just by thinking what they want.\n\nAgain, convenience over humanity. My host, unfortunately, was one of the few that could not reliably connect to that network. He was plagued by nightmares and had to use a weird device to communicate with me, for spoken word was long gone after they decided that direct brain-to-brain communication was easier and more reliable anyway.\n\nAnd because my brain was not \"conditioned\", I could only sleep in small naps. But luckily, the man was able to fix my time machine, and that's how I am back.\n\n...\n\nAnd then, silence.\n\nI know what my boss will say. Somehow I know it. Still, I feel the tears starting to form, for even knowing what is  going to happen, I know that as soon as I hear the words... it'll be just too much. To my horror, he just says:\n\n\\- \"Isn't it possible that you dreamed the whole thing?\"\n\nI start to move my mouth, but he dismiss my unspoken words with a gesture:\n\n\\- \"Still... even if you didn't, we can't stop progress. We can add safeguards to our new technologies, and in the meantime, we'll just inform the public the time machine just malfunctioned and you were unconscious till now...\"\n\n...\n\nMinutes later, I'm finally conscious again.\n\nBut I still can't stop screaming..."

        "writing_prompt": "Humans, upon reaching ftl are contacted by a race who needed antibodies we produce, in exchange giving us their technology, exellerating us thousands of years forward. 700 years later an upstart galactic council of aliens finds earth and tries to force humans into submission.",
        "story": "\\-\\-\\- Secret UN Headquarters \\-\\-\\-\n\n*\\- Humans... you don't understand, even with your stolen technology, you don't have a choice. We can...*\n\n*\\- Take it. Go ahead.*\n\nSeconds of silence. The tentacled horror from beyond the abyss, with its inhuman form, changes color. People get uncomfortable, but if they could read Alien physiology, they would understand that the alien was, probably, even farther in their own comfort zone.\n\n*\\- You defy me? That's your bluff? To make it seem as if you're surrendering, then...*\n\n*\\- No, you misunderstand* - another human speaks. He looks the alien on what he thinks it's the creature's eyes, hoping that his fight-and-flight reaction doesn't show on his face, or his body language - *We said \"take it\", as if, we're ok with it. We saw what you do with other creatures. You force them to work, you explain them nothing, they produce weapons, war machines, and technology they won't ever be allowed to use. In exchange, you let them live. We saw all of that. And yet...*\n\nA pause. Sights feel the room, to a point the alien can't understand. They read human behavior books and tried to study the planet, carefully finding how humans move, talk, feel, but this was something else. The \"Human Ambassadors\", as the galactic council calls them, was not  subject to whatever is happening in the room.\n\n*\\- And yet? Try not my patience, human, for I have other things to do.*\n\n*\\- And yet -* another human speaks. She have the voice of despair, sounding as if she was thousands of years old, even though she is just on her early thirties - *and yet, it's better of what we did with ourselves.* \n\n*\\- People don't like being slaves, sir -*  a fourth human says - *Expect resistance from these ones. They pose no danger. But there are others that do offer, and these are the ones you must be wary of. I can show you a list of names, photos, and what weapons they have access. There are others, and they mostly go undercover. Expect some to have the war power of the whole country. We have some undercover agents in USA too, so in three days I can give you every kind of weapon that USA have, but don't expect precise numbers, for these are secrets that not even the president know. I can recommend some people for you to capture. They won't talk, but they are cowards - a little bit of torture can extract information from them.*\n\n*\\- T... torture?* - the creature scream. People cover their ears, with the exception of a single woman - *You... ask... for us to... torture your kind? You know... that some of us can be quite...*\n\n*\\- Cruel? -* the woman that didn't flinch by the creature's scream says - *Ah, I didn't know aliens could be naive. Oh, sorry, you probably won't get sarcasm as well. Anyway, yes. I can offer some tips on how to do it, in a way that you won't have to hurt them too much, if it bothers you. But honestly... you should trust someone else with these tips.* - she smiles, a smile that could brings shivers to the alien's body, if they could shiver - *because, for me... I honestly would love to see these motherfuckers burning alive, stop juuuust before they die, somehow cure them, and repeat the process... over... and over... for years... and I honestly would love to record their screams and play them as my night's lullaby.*\n\n*What happened here?* Was the Alien's mental question. They dismiss the meeting, scheduling another talk in three days.\n\nAnd then, they are back in the battleship. With the council.\n\nIt was a bluff - the council can't stop the humans, if they unite and decide to fight with the technology they have. The humans at UN knew that, the alien was sure of that. That is why the humans were offering aid.\n\nBut why?\n\nAnother alien comes flying, quickly, with holograms and intelligent paper annotations with everything the council could find. With all the technology the humans were gifted, how they improved it, how it made some of them essentially immortal, untouchable, invincible. If they wanted, they could colonize a whole star system, not only the solar system as they were doing.\n\nSo... why?\n\nAnd then, the numbers. The number of people living in such luxury. The things they did with other people. The colonies at Venus, controlled by a single person, Mars, by two Titan, by the same person that controls Venus.\n\nThese are all slave camps. They send prisoners to these places to work, and in exchange, they can **breathe**. They suffer from malnutrition, from dehydration, and some literally die from overwork at these colonies.\n\nAnd prisoners... are people they don't like. A human don't need to commit a crime to be sent to prison, for governments are literally bought with insane amounts of money that most people don't even know it exists *in the world*.\n\n*\\- What is the percentage? Of humans that will die in the next five years because of these conditions?*\n\n*\\- Sir, our estimates are about 80% of humans will. These are our best estimates sir. The worst ones are...*\n\n*\\- What? You mean, in each ten humans in these colonies, eight will die in the next five years?*\n\n_\\- No, sir. The estimates are for **all humans**, even the ones living on Earth. At the colonies, the estimates are essentially 100%. Well, if we want to be precise, it's 99.998%, because one or two humans will survive for ten or twenty years more._\n\nSo it is not cruelty to force them into submission... but mercy?\n\nThere needs to be another meeting. With the Council of Aliens.\n\nFor enslaving a species that subject their own to conditions worse than slavery... can be dangerous..."

Except, it\u2019s really just him smacking someone in the head while shouting \u2018I CAST IRON!!\u2019 It\u2019s actually rather comical.\u201d",
        "story": "And indeed, it was comical. But again, that was also part of Grok's personality - he was, indeed, a monster full of muscles, and could break all the bones of your body with just his pinkie, but he was also fun, a jokster, and while simple-minded, everybody at the party loved him.\n\nThat six months in the magic school of Tuslain gave a bunch of new funny things for Grok to do. He started with \"I CAST IRON\", screaming at the top of his lungs, just before smacking someone in his head. Then it became \"I CAST FIRE!\" and him throwing flaming, hot stones soaked in burning oil. Everybody laughed from his jokes...\n\n... until that day.\n\nAmbushed, the party fought as much as they could. But they lost, and Grok was almost unconscious, the ranger was hiding trying to find a way to save his friends, and the sorcerer was unconscious - the only one who could save everybody with some mass cure, and maybe that's exactly why he was targeted first. The cleric and the rogue where nowhere to be seen.\n\nLyla, the fighter, came to her party's camp too late, and she could see the bandits cicling around, trying to find her and the ranger. Luckily, she was able to sneak close to Grok, but she could see he was in a very bad condition - probably poisoned. She tried a telepathic spell, one she learned from an old magician, to communicate with her party. Grok tried to focus his eyes, and just said:\n\n\\- \"My focus. Need it. Also pink flower. Put in it\".\n\n\\- \"Grok, it's not time for that, we need to...\"\n\n\\- \"Need it. Trust Grok. Grok knows what Grok is doing\".\n\nLyla could not believe she was hearing that. Maybe Grok wasn't trying to be funny, he was, indeed, dumber than everybody though he was. Still, she could not waste time - she did give him his skillet, helped Grok to his feet, just as they were ambushed by two bandits - nothing Lyla couldn't handle, but Grok was still rummaging whatever was close to they, seaching for the damn pink flower.\n\nThe bandits, on the other hand, knew how to fight dirty. They did attack, but always targeting Grok, and Lyla as forced to take three arrows to her armor, one indeed piercing her arm, just to protect her friend. Until she heard the words:\n\n\\- \"I CAST WATER!\"\n\nShe looked at Grok, while he was just throwing water filled with flowers to the air, and the moment she opened her mouth to scream to him, so he could do something useful instead of daydreaming about being a wizard...\n\n... it started to rain.\n\nThe arrow dropped for Lyla's skin, the bruise nowhere to be seen. Grok was back on his feet, blinking to his friend, and with his \"battle weapon\" in hand, \"casted iron\" to the two bandits, who fell in the ground immediately.\n\nMoments later, the Rogue and the Sorcerer were at her side, cured from whatever the bandits did with them, and ready to battle, as if they were never even hurt in the first place. But the fight was quick and uneventful - for it was still raining, and the rain cured whatever attack each of them suffered. Screams were heard from the forest, when the Ranger took care of everyone that was still hiding, and the cleric appeared with other bandits tied to some magic binding, looking refreshed as if she had a good night's sleep in a four-star hotel after a good SPA session.\n\n\\- \"Grok... what did...\"\n\n\\- \"Sorry, Grok need sleep. Too tired, magic too dificulty. Ah... one thing. Important thing Grok needs!\"\n\n\\- \"Sure, whatever you want, please, tell us!\"\n\n\\- \"Grok wants fish. Can fish something and ask Ranger to cook for Grok? Tasty!\" - and in seconds, he was sleeping.\n\nThe party looked at each other, confused. It was a known fact that one needed intelligence to cast spells. The higher the intelligence, the stronger the spell. A \"mass cure\" was just possible by the highest academics of Tuslain's Magic School, and a \"mass cure and remove poison\" was essentially unheard of, being attributed to the grand mages of the past, almost a legend.\n\nSo... what the hell happened?"

We have no idea what's happening, for most of us fleed when we saw our own running to their ruin, throwing their weapons on the ground, not even looking back, Your Majesty. We are all scared now, we have no idea if he somehow hipnotised, converted, brainwashed our soldiers. We can't win, Your Majesty, if he was able to turn our own against us - as Your Majesty said, it's an _entire army_ that's now under his control!\"\n\nThe King grunted, and then left. He spent the whole week together with his advisors, and training a new army, not to overthrow the castle but to prepare for what he felt was the innevitable attack his kingdom would suffer.\n\nBut after three months, the attack never came. In fact, the family of the soldiers simply dissappeared, and more and more, the kingdom was losing citizens, for no particular reason. He knew it was treason, but somehow could not understand how that was happening. His advisors were also baffled - there was no sign of unrest, no weird people at the city that could be spies, and even when the King ordered for the gates to be closed, he woke up just to see the guards that were supposed to be on duty were gone, and the gates again were open.\n\nSo he disguised himself. He was old, but somehow was able to climb that hill, to enter the castle by the front door, and as soon as he got to the point of no return...\n\n... he paused. Tears formed into his eyes. He could... smell, what happened.\n\n... nobody would ever have a chance. Not against this. He had hidden a small dagger under his clothes, and the first thing he did was to throw the thing away. It made a distinct sound, alerting the owner of the castle, who just smiled, and with an inviting hand and a warm smile, ended up any kind of anger, of anguish, the King could have.\n\nHe motioned to a chair, and the King, ignoring all social constructs, happily seated on it, willingly, his body almost not his own anymore.\n\nThe man seated on the table, and then brought what the King was eyeing for this whole time, in a small tray. In a small cup, the King drank the tastiest coffee he ever had, and ate the tastiest cake that could ever exist.\n\nThe emotion was simply too much. His tears betrayed his mind, his body, washing away all signs of social constructions, hierarchy, hostility... at that moment, he was just a man, that after so many centuries, could finally feel the taste of a good coffee, a recipe lost in time since the times of the Great Wars.\n\nThe man just smiled, and kindly said:\n\n\\- \"I could teach you the recipe, if you want.\"\n\nAnd that's how another kingdom lost the war."
