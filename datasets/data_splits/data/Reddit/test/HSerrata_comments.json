        "writing_prompt": "Your friend is the gamemaster of your local roleplaying group. He found an old book and for fun read a passage from it.  Everyone was surprised when an actual demon showed up. They were even more surprised when the demon wanted to join your gaming session...",
        "story": "\\[Sunny Summon\\] \n\n\"...and thusly I invoke the power of Aurelio's Sun and call to the Void. Hear me speak your name and request an audience, Ballisea the Demon Queen,\" Justin was too busy enjoying the moment to notice the collective eye-roll from the rest of the group. Three of the five members were eager to start the game and the fourth, Justin's closest friend, was understanding enough. But, the passage sounded more like the high-minded journal entry of an edgy 14-year-old with no world experience than ancient words of power. Wade didn't know where Justin found the book, and he suspected the entire passage might have been written by his friend, but they were all there for entertainment and this was Justin's.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"... and, the Demon Queen did appear before the mortal king...,\" Justin sat down with a grin and began explaining the lore of their newest campaign. But, before he continued, a soft, gentle, female voice whispered as if directly in his ear.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"And then what happened?\" she asked.\u00a0 As soon as the question was complete, all five friends jumped to their feet and disrupted the table in the process.\n\n\n\n\"AAAUGH!\" Justin was up at the same time as everyone else and the table shifted.\n\n\n\n\"YEEOOO!\" Shane stood up so fast his chair fell over backwards as he spun around looking for the voice.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"WHAT THE FU-\" Wade felt a chill travel down his spine as the whisper gently caressed his eardrums. He knocked over the still open 3-liter bottle of soda all over the game board.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"AAEEIIUgh!\" Debbie slammed her hands down on the table for leverage as she rushed to her feet. She moved to the side as she stood and her hand pushed the pizza box off the table so the pie and box fell on the floor face down. It was still open too and only one slice was missing.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"GAAHHH!\" Devin, Debbie's twin, subconsciously moved closer t her as she moved closer to him and he glanced around the room like Shane for the mysterious voice.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt was a sudden ruckus. Each one was surprised as a whispered voice spoke to each one of them individually. Her voice didn't fill the room, it didn't need to.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"It's difficult to feel welcome after such a spectacle, and yet, you did summon me here; why?\" Her voice spoke again; but, this time it came from a central point and they all looked. It was late in the evening, though the sun hadn't set yet. Justin lived alone in a modest single family home that was in a pretty solid neighborhood. They were playing in the living room with a sturdy card table unfolded just for the occasion. The blinds were open enough to let the setting sunlight filter through and there was still enough light to not need any indoor lights on yet. But, that also meant that as part of Justin's spartan decor, one small corner of the living room was covered in black shadow. This is where her voice came from, and then a tall pale woman with bone-white ram horns stepped out of shadow, as if through a bead curtain. The five friends watched the shadows bulge, then simply fall away as her imposing form emerged.\n\n\n\nThere was a thud as Shane fainted.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"You're real? Really Ballisea?\" Wade asked. She looked at him, then giggled.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"You tried summoning me without knowing I'm real?\" As she spoke, two skeletons walked out of the shadowed corner to stand on either side of her. \"Allow me to make it absolutely clear how real I am,\" she giggled some more as the skeletons moved forward. Debbie screamed as Devin put himself in front of her, and Wade was surprised to see Justin step in front of him.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't know! It's my fault! It was just for a game! Take me, don't hurt them!\" he said.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"A game?\" Ballisea asked. She only tilted her head slightly, but the ram horns were large enough to make it an almost comical expression. She looked around the room and saw the table in disarray. \"Ahhh, a tabletop game...,\" she giggled and the skeletons disintegrated into white powder. \"A game where you create a new version of yourself to go on adventures in a fantasy world?\"\n\n\n\n\"That's right!\" Justin nodded eagerly. He didn't know where the conversation would lead, but it was a good sign that she dismissed her enforcers. \"We're just starting a brand new campaign using this book I found your summoning ritual in! I didn't know it was real!\" he said as he rushed to the table and picked up the soda-soaked sourcebook. Then, he put himself in front of Wade again to offer it to her\n\n\n\n\"Wade's a Paladin, Devin is a Lancer, Debbie is a Cyber Icon, and Shane is a Card Mage! We all used the new classes from this book too,\" he said. It was a gamble, but if she was really as powerful as portrayed in the book, the fact that she was still entertaining his explanations left him hopeful. \"Do you... maybe want to play with us?\" By this time, Wade, Debbie, and Devin had all managed to get Shane up off the floor, but he wasn't conscious yet. Ballisea smiled and shook her head.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Dear child, the game you speak of existed long before this Earth, and the tabletop experience isn't remotely the same thing, nor as entertaining as the AlterNet itself.\"\n\n\n\n\"It's real!??\" Justin asked. He had been too focused on the living breathing demon queen in front of him to consider anything else. But, if she was real, then maybe the rest of the book was too.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I think I will play with your group,\" Ballisea said. It happened so fast that Justin had time to wonder why everything was so bright all of a sudden, before he even looked around. He was already squinting when he realized he was on a hilltop overlooking a vast field of golden wheat. He spun around to make sure, and the rest of his friends were there too, along with Ballisea.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"IT'S REAL!\" Justin screamed. Even without any game trappings, he knew he was on another Earth. That alone convinced him.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Uh, does that mean they are too..?\" Wade asked. He pointed to a legion in military formation in the distance. They were marching straight toward the hill he stood on, and they were all skeletons.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Over here too..,\" Devin added as he pointed out a couple more battalions moving toward them from different angles.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Oh, this is promising to be quite entertaining already,\" Ballisea smiled. \"I think I'll watch you from somewhere else,\" she said as a black portal opened next to her. \"Welcome to the AlterNet,\" she said and stepped through. \"If your group survives long enough to entertain me, maybe I'll let you.\"."

        "writing_prompt": "You finally find the mythical lamp containing the All knowing genie who can answer any one question. Well prepared, you ask the one question you spent years on, \u201cWhat answer would you give had I asked the perfect question if you had to restate the question in your answer?\u201d",
        "story": "[Barley Answered]\n\nIt was perfect, obsessively so. Nadia wrestled with the wording for years after learning of the genie's existence. Wish granting genies were found as often as someone won the lottery; but, an 'All-knowing' genie who can answer any one question was a different situation entirely. She had already been trying to formulate the perfect wish as a 'just in case', hoping one day she might be that lucky. She changed her focus to try and come up with a flawless, informative question that would give her insight into the universe itself. \n\nAfter endless weeks and months, she'd finally crafted what she considered to be the ultimate question. She moved phrases around, changed the words and considered the meaning hundreds of thousands of times so that it couldn't be misinterpreted. Genie Lawyers were a common enough business, but she did not want to give away her idea, and she couldn't afford any of them anyway. Most of the time they required a cut of the wish; but, this genie didn't grant wishes, only knowledge. Still, even without their assistance, the wish was finally planned to perfection. And, as if the universe itself knew she was ready, Nadia finally found the mythical lamp containing the genie who could answer any one question. \n\nAlthough 'found' wasn't the best description. Nadia lucked into inheriting the lamp on a cool Wednesday morning. She had a regular habit of jogging along the beach at dawn before she got ready and headed to work, and she was never the only one there that early. There was a regular crowd of familiar faces every week, even if she didn't see them every day. That morning she saw one of those friendly strangers holding a very familiar lamp. The lamp of the All-Knowing genie wasn't the same golden oil lamp that the wish-granting genies usually had. \n\nA portly, young blonde woman in overalls was standing by the water holding something that looked like a tiny watering pail made of blue crystalline metal. And, she was winding her hand back about to launch it back into the ocean. \n\n\"WAIT!!\" Nadia dashed forward, and thanked her lucky stars it was someone she'd shared a smile in passing with most mornings. \n\n\"Hi,\" the younger woman did indeed wait and she relaxed her posture as Nadia rushed to her. \"Everything okay?\" she asked. \n\n\"Is that...,\" Nadia huffed to catch her breath. She wasn't out of shape by any definition, but it had been a sudden strain at top speed, and her body wasn't warmed up for that yet. \"... That's the All-Knowing genie!?\" she asked. \n\n\"Uhuh,\" the blonde nodded. \"I've seen you, my name's Barley,\" she smiled and shifted the lamp to one hand to offer Nadia a handshake.\n\n\"Nadia,\" she accepted the greeting. \n\n\"I'm done and I was just gonna throw it back; but, do you want it?\" she asked and offered the lamp. \n\n\"Really!?\" Nadia was shocked enough to ask the question even as she accepted it and took it out of Barley's hand.\n\n\"Sure, you're nice,\" Barley smiled. \n\n\"Thank you! Please don't think I'm rude, but I've been waiting a long time for this!\" she rubbed the lamp and blue smoke poured out of the end like water. It fell straight down without rising, yet it seemed to fill a solid shape like revealing an invisible glass. \n\n\"Sure,\" Barley giggled and stepped back, but only slightly. She was a curious person by nature. The smoke took the shape of scholarly gentleman standing upright on the sand. He wore a golden and blue graduation gown with spectacles that went well with his bushy silver beard. \n\n\"I am the -,\" he began, but Nadia interrupted him.\n\n\"I'm ready!\" she said. \n\n\"You see?\" The genie looked over at Barley, and the woman giggled with a nod. But, then, the genie sighed and set his gaze on Nadia. \n\n\"Speak your question.\"  Nadia had her phone ready. Sure, she memorized it, but there were to be no mistakes. Everything was perfect already and she needed to stick the landing. She'd put too much deliberation into each and every word to misspeak now out of pure nerves. She didn't risk wasting any preamble either.\n\n\"What answer would you give had I asked the perfect question if you had to restate the question in your answer?\" she asked. He smiled at her, and she heard Barley laugh a little bit more, but she was focused. \n\n\"This one matters most of all,\" the genie said. Then, he dissolved into smoke again and flowed back into the blue lamp. \n\n\"HEY!\" Something went wrong. \"THAT WASN'T A COMPLETE ANSWER!\" she yelled at it. \n\n\"It wasn't a complete question,\" Barley offered. \n\n\"YES IT -,\" Nadia was a nice person by nature. Sometimes she was easily distracted; but, in general she preferred to be pleasant. And, she was yelling at someone that had nothing to do with why she was angry. \"I'm sorry... but, it was,\" Nadia said with a softer tone. \"I put a lot of planning into that wish! It was complete!\"\n\n\"I'm not sure...,\" Barley shook her head. \"... but, you have given it a lot more thought than I have. Can you walk me through it?\" she asked. Nadia was still regretful about lashing out, and even more so when she realized Barley seemed to be on the 'simple' end of the spectrum. \n\n\"Okay,\" she nodded with a sigh. The frustration at her missed opportunity would return later; but, right now she could spare a moment for a friendly conversation. \"So, the genie knows everything right? And if he knows the answer to a question, he should also know the question that asks for that answer, with me so far?\" Nadia asked. There was a long enough silence for Nadia to listen to waves before Barley processed the information and nodded. \n\n\"The genie knows the answer and he knows the question, and so I thought up a way to ask the genie for both using a whole different question. And, that's the wish, 'what answer would you give had I asked the perfect question', gets the answer. And the part about, ' ...if you had to restate the question in your answer...,\" covers getting the question. Does that make sense?\" \n\n\"But, what's the question?\" Barley asked. \n\n\"The perfect one. The ultimate one, the answer to everything,\" Nadia answered. \n\n\"No such thing,\" Barley shook her head, then she shrugged. \"Perfect for what?\" \n\n\"What do you mean?\" Nadia asked. \"The genie knows perfect for what, he knows everything!\" She hadn't meant to raise her voice, and fortunately she realized it in time to calm down again. It was still a fresh nerve. \n\n\"Maybe, but I don't think that's how it works...,\" Barley shook her head. \"'Perfect' is subjective, your idea of it is different from everyone else's. And even then, there are infinity number of topics. You could have a perfect question about how to make good eggs, or you might have a perfect question about how to find meaning in your life,\" she said. \"There's no one universal perfection.\"\n\n\\n\\n\"But, he still gave me an answer...?\" Nadia asked. She could kind of make sense of Barley's points; but, the fact was her wish for knowledge was wasted as far as she could tell. \".. a useless answer I guess..?\" \n\n\"You said the genie should know what you meant by 'Perfect'.  Maybe he did? What question would you have asked him if you weren't trying to ask him the perfect one?\"\n\nNadia was glad for the conversation. Barley had given her an unexpected insight and it wasn't until that moment she realized it. She did have a perfect question in mind that she hoped was the one that got answered. She wanted the answer so badly that she lost sight of it to focus on getting all the words just right. But, Barley had accidentally brought it up. \n\n\"I want to find meaning...,\" Nadia said. She wanted the answers; she wanted to know the meaning of the universe, and more importantly, she wanted to know how, when, or where to find it. \n\n\"Well, that's not a question,\" Barley giggled. \n\n\"I know!\" Nadia raised her voice again, but it was more playful this time. \"That's the problem I had!\" she giggled along with Barley. And, the amusement somehow lined things up in her mind. She'd been going over the wish and her wants and even Barley's advice and the question just fell into place.\n\n\"What moments matter throughout my life, past present, and future...,\" she said idly as her mind worked. \"Which ones are important!\" the thought clicked. \"THAT'S WHAT I WOULD HAVE ASKED!\"\n\n\"Told'ya!\" Barley giggled. \"He totally answered your question.\" \n\n\"Damnit...,\" Nadia sighed. It was clear now. The genie knew she was making a mistake and that was the moment that mattered the most. Arguably, the perfect moment where everything could have gone differently.  \"But... he only answered part of it!\" \n\n\"The part you asked,\" Barley nodded with a smirk. \n\n\"But, that's not the whole context...,\" Nadia was arguing to make peace. The moment was gone, but she was still trying to let go and having Barley poke holes in her complaints was helping. \n\n\"You focused so much on the question you didn't say a thing about context. But, he gave you a great answer anyway,\" she said. \n\n\"I guess...,\" Nadia sighed. \"... but, it doesn't do me any good to know I messed up the most important moment in my life...\"\n\n\"When?\" Barley asked. \n\n\"Just now!\" Nadia said. She decided she was done and made a heaving effort to launch the lamp back into the sea as Barley was going to do. \"And, maybe he was right. But, there's nothing else I can do about that moment anymore,\" she said. \n\n\"Oh, I think you're still missing it a little bit,\" Barley giggled and shook her head. \"He wasn't talking about that moment that passed. He was talking about this one, right now,\" she smiled. \n\n"

        "story": "\\[Sunny Rage\\]\n\nMolly yawned as the merman host continued his presentation. It had already gone on longer than she thought and thus far, she hadn't learned a single useful thing.\u00a0 She was in a sunny classroom designed for a merfolk teacher, although she wasn't actually in a class and he wasn't a teacher. The classroom was staggered with stadium seating, and at the bottom in front was a ground-level pool with enough space for an instructor to move in and out of the water freely. Molly was the only one there for the presentation, it was exclusively organized for her.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"...which of course brings us to common mistakes made when identifying mermaids...,\" the presenter continued. But, Molly's attention was drawn to another student walking in. Her friend and teammate, Emily, had long silver hair and it shined on and off as Emily walked through sunrays to get to where Molly was and sat next to her.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Hey, almost done?\" Emily asked.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, I think so,\" Molly nodded. \"What's up?\"\n\n\n\n\"Ehh...,\" Emily took a moment to shrug and put on an embarrassed expression. \"... Kirk kind of accepted a challenge from Eph... sorry,\" she apologized to one friend for the actions of another.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"On the other hand, Sirens are completely different...,\" the presenter was undeterred by the interruption as if he didn't notice the extra visitor or their conversation at all.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"That's fine,\" Molly giggled with a nod. \"We're not in first place right now anyway, we can lose a few points, if he loses.\" But, Emily shook her head.\n\n\n\n\"Kirk accepted for the whole team...,\" she said.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Oh,\" Molly nodded again, this time with a sigh instead of a smile. \"Okay, that's fine too. It's good practice, either way, I guess. But, I'm definitely going to have to revoke his challenge privileges to avoid this happening again.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Totally, and I already gave him a lecture about it too,\" Emily agreed.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"When?\" Molly asked.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"That's why I came to talk in person,\" Emily said. \"So, it wouldn't be a surprise. Kirk and Eph agreed on Saturday; but, it'll probably pop up as a notification when you're done with this,\" she gestured at the speaker still giving his monotone explanation. \"Team Captain can still veto it.. but don't, please?\" Emily asked. \"And, don't tell him I asked you not to cancel it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Well, we're not in first place, but if we lose as a team we might get dropped to last... why not?\" Molly asked.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"You weren't there..,\" Emily replied. \"Eph was giving him a hard time, and he was really trying not to rise to the bait. Then, he started insulting me, you, and the rest of the team and that's when Kirk got mad. It's still only the Second Six Weeks, we have time to come back from last place. But, he was extra fired up, and he was trying to be better before... I dunno, I kind of wanna give him this, you know? Even if it doesn't work out, I want the team to have his back. I mean, it's not like we don't stand a chance. The AlterNet Crew only has five members, and they're all pretty average. Eph and Pavette are their strongest players and we can handle them pretty easily.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Okay, I won't cancel it then,\" Molly nodded. \"Oh wait, I'm about to finish,\" she said.\u00a0 Then, she stood from her seat with her hand in the air.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Yes, you have a question?\" the merman asked.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cSo mermaids and sirens are two different species?\u201d Molly asked.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cJust so,\" he nodded. \"My people, what you call mermaids or merfolk, share a common ancestor to you humans, making us distant cousins. What you call sirens, however, are fish that evolved to look and sound like humans to attract their favorite prey.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"Thank you,\" Molly nodded at him, then turned back to Emily. \"Done,\" she said. A message popped up in her view. \"And... there's the notification. Challenge accepted,\" she said.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Was that it? You just had to ask a question?\" Emily stood and followed Emily out of the classroom.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"The hard part is sitting through the lecture, it won't let me skip the quest text. Then, I had to ask a question at the end to show some sort of engagement.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, what was the quest?\" Emily asked. \"Mermaid only?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" Molly nodded. \"I'm happy with my loadout for tanking, but, I'm still missing some basic mermaid racial Abilities that I never bothered to get. Since completing quests on school grounds gets me Spirit Points too, I figured it was a good time to get them.\"\n\n\n\n\"Smart,\" Emily giggled. \"Is it true? What he explained about mermaids and sirens?\" They were now walking through the mostly empty halls. It was after school and most of the students were out challenging the world and each other.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Maybe on some Earths, but not really. The parts I heard were actually kind of nonsensical, but, procedurally generated does that text I guess,\" she giggled. \"And, that last part you heard was just useless filler.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"How so? I know mermaids and sirens get conflated with each other on most Earths I've been to, but they are two different species, right?\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh yes, absolutely,\" Molly nodded. \"I'm very much a mermaid and not a siren. That part was true, but the parts about 'what you call mermaids' and 'what you call sirens' was just NPC rambling.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I don't get it..,\" Emily shrugged. \"I know he was a Quest NPC, but, it sounds reasonable?\u00a0 I'm sure on some Earths sirens evolved the way he said.. it's possible, right?\"\n\n\n\n\"It is..,\" Molly nodded. \"Maybe it's just me, I get a little defensive about fake 'mermaid facts' because of what I am. But, it makes absolutely no sense to me. I asked him flat out if they're two different species,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"And he agreed...?\" Emily nodded.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, I know. It's just a little annoying that it's obvious I don't know the difference between a mermaid and a siren. And then his answer goes on to explain the differences pretending to use my language. 'What you call mermaids, what you call sirens...,\" Molly shook her head. \"The question automatically implies I don't know there's a difference and used the words interchangeably. Theoretically, I called the same creature both things. And that NPC has the gall to define the words in a way that puts himself in the camp of Mermaids? It really twists my tide pools, my people would NEVER call him a merfolk!\"\n\n\n\n\"Hey...,\" Emily shook her head. \"He's just an NPC...,\" she reminded her friend.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah...,\" Molly nodded with a sigh. \"I'm really mad at Kirk by the way.\"."

        "story": "\\[Stellar Moves\\]\n\n\"...and according to the archive, the secret door is right here...,\" Geonara held the borrowed book out toward the solid stone wall, and it shimmered before revealing a large iron door. She and her teammate, Pavette, were there to take down the Demon Lord. They were behind the castle at Geonara's advice. It wasn't particularly challenging and Pavette thought she could have made it solo. But, bringing Geonara along helped her skip all the patrols and go straight to the throne room. Even while still outside the main walls, the door would lead them straight there. Geonara's abilities as a Librarian allowed her to fudge some details of the quest. She couldn't assign an easier target; but, she could manipulate where they found the entrance.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Thanks,\" Pavette nodded at Geonara, then pushed the large door open. \"After yesterday's disaster, I'm not up to dealing with all the trash on the way,\" she added as she stepped into the throne room just beyond the entrance with Geonara close behind.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"You don't need to do this one today..,\" Geonara offered. \"If you wait, we can come back during the week with the whole team and do it right.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"If I wait, Eph might sign us up for another challenge,\" Pavette grumbled.\u00a0 She'd come to a stop a few feet away from the Demon Lord's throne so that she wouldn't engage the encounter yet.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Well, still,\" Geonara giggled. \"It's not like we can lose last place at this point.\" Despite her mood, that made Pavette smile too. That was the real reason she'd brought Geonara along. There was another girl on their team too, but Pavette felt she and Geonara were more on the same wavelength. And, Eph, the team leader, made it difficult to make friends outside the group.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Eh, we're already here,\" Pavette shrugged. \"Can you do anything about the drop so we only have to do it once?\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Not without the quest, and not without killing him at least once,\" Geonara shook her head.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Oh, well, maybe we'll get lucky,\" she nodded and drew the neon blue crystalline gun holstered on her hip.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Oh wait!\" Geonara interrupted as Pavette took a step toward the Demon Lord.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I can change the battle. Want to try that?\"\n\n\n\n\"Change it how?\" Pavette asked. Geonara shrugged.\n\n\n\n\"The story prompt for the party just says: 'An unexpected Battle takes place'.\"\n\n\n\n\"Sure,\" Pavette nodded, but she kept her gun ready. \"Let's find out.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"The party eventually found their way into the Demon Lord's throne room to find him waiting patiently. He had been ready all along...,\" Geonara began reading the story, and she motioned Pavette forward. \"...as the brave intruder approached, the Demon Lord jumped to his feet.\"\u00a0 The Demon Lord did exactly as she said and glared down at Pavette.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"And then...,\" Geonara tilted her head as she continued reading. \"... the music started.\" Pumping music filled the throne room and spotlights came on as the main lights dimmed. Geonara giggled. \"... it was a Dance Battle.\"\n\n\n\n\"DANCE BATTLE!!!\" The Demon Lord yelled raising his arms in challenge.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I don't know how to dance!\" Pavette yelled. She holstered her gun and looked at Geonara for advice. Meanwhile, the Demon Lord was shimmying and gyrating his way down the steps for his first volley of fresh moves.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Uhh,\" Geonara nodded and read through the details. \"Oh, you don't have to, it's based on the Dancer class,\" she said. \"That's what we're here for, right?\" She asked.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Oh, I think we got lucky!\" Pavette nodded with a giggle. She was a Spellslinger; but, her Specialization allowed her to use certain skills from other classes, and she was after one from the Dancer class. Now that she knew what to expect, she waited her turn as the Demon Lord flailed in front of her.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTechnically his kinetic assault was inflicting damage; but, it wasn't a lot and there was nothing she could do until her turn anyway. If things went well, the Demon Lord wouldn't get another turn. The music continued to pulse and after a supernatural spin, the Demon Lord pointed at Pavette with a long bony finger.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOn cue, purple stars took shape in Pavette's vision. At first, they appeared far away almost on the other side of the throne room; but, each beat drew them closer and closer in a staggered fashion. With her ability to equip skills from other Classes she researched plenty of them, and the Dancer intrigued her most of all. She was curious enough to learn how they play on the track and to her surprise they didn't have to dance at all. To keep Auras active on the track all a Dancer had to do was touch certain targets that only she could see. Of course, the challenge was to touch them in time with the beat. If she missed the timing it would ruin her combo progress.\n\n\n\nPavette tapped her foot to keep up and as the first set of stars reached her she moved her hands to make contact. She didn't have to move her body too much, for the most part the stars were heading right to her.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Augh, Ugh, Ouch,\" The Demon Lord complained with each successful move that Pavette completed. As she made flawless progress two glowing stars appeared at the back and moved toward her. One was glowing gold and the other red. They were both the last move and she would have to choose one to finish her turn.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Oh! Do the attack!\" Geonara spoke up as soon as she noticed the option in her book.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"'Kay,\" Pavette nodded. Geonara started to read.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"The Chosen One's travels were arduous and only strengthened the warrior. The Demon Lord was no match for the Hero's funky flow. On her very first showcase, the Chosen One left the villain razzled and dazzled; and, after a perfect set, she finished with fiery flair!\" Geonara read it as Pavette his the red star to trigger the attack.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"NOOOOOO!\"\u00a0 The Demon Lord cowered as a giant burst of flame erupted around him. The flames grew brighter and hotter for a moment, then faded away completely leaving nothing but ash. Pavette glanced down and a golden skill gem was buried in the pile.\n\n\n\n\"Got it!\" she giggled. \"Thanks a ton!\" she smiled at Geonara after she collected the loot. \"I was kind 'meh' coming in, and I didn't think it'd be over this soon. But, we're done and I'm feeling better,\" she smiled. \"You got anything you want to do?\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Well...,\" Geonara nodded. \"I don't think it would help the team all that much; but,... after this quest I kind of want to try Dancer too,\" she nodded. \"But... first I need to unlock the Princess specialization; will you help me with that?\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Sure,\" Pavette nodded. \"I don't know how, cause I chose it when I made my character; but, let's go find out,\" she smiled."

        "story": "[Rich Interpretation]\n\nFerris was only there out of curiosity. He had no way to quantify it; but, he was convinced he had the absolute worst luck in the world. For some reason, nearly everyone he met was rude, if not outright antagonistic. His financial situation wasn't ideal, and rude strangers meant he didn't have anyone he could really depend on as a friend. It was only 8:30 in the morning, and he was already thoroughly bitter at the world. Although, given his luck, it was hard not to be. But, as he stood there waiting to cross and continue his walk to work, a small shop materialized in the empty lot next to him. He felt lucky for the first time in his life. And, it was about time too, the universe certainly owed him. \n\n'Accursed Consignment' wasn't a normal store, and they capitalized on that. Any minute now, a post would go out on social media to tell everyone where they were located for the day. Ferris was there when it arrived and he hurried in to try and beat the rush. It appeared in his city pretty regularly; but, he'd never been a position to visit. And, the few times he considered it, he always assumed it would've been packed with people out to get their own magical items. But, this time was different. He was the first one there and he went in without hesitation. \n\nHe knew he was risking his job; but, it didn't matter. His boss was always on him about something anyway. Ferris had only been late a dozen or so times over the course of months. And, he quickly learned to keep his thoughts in his head; he only had to visit HR twice. The timing was too perfect. He knew his luck was about to turn around and he'd find just the thing in the shop so that he never had to work again. \n\nThe bell jingled against the door as he walked in, and he was pleasantly surprised by the shop's interior. He expected a pawn shop environment with glass cases and display racks and that was what he found. Yet, it was all so much more elegant than he expected. The white tile on the floor was spotless and it almost seemed to be glowing. The walls were decorated with deep red wallpaper and all the display cases were formed out of black wrought iron to keep the items contained. A slender, pale gentleman was seated behind the main counter reading a thick book, and he looked up at the sound of the bell with slight confusion. Then, he jumped to his feet when he noticed Ferris. \n\n\"Guess you weren't expecting anyone this early, huh?\" Ferris chuckled at the man being caught relaxing on the job. It identified the hapless clerk as either lazy or new, and he was already planning how to take advantage of that come negotiation time. Of course, Ferris did sit down at his job, but he was doing hard work, usually, and not just playing with magic trinkets. \n\n\"No...,\" the clerk chuckled gently with a shake of his head. \"I was not. You're the first customer,\" he said. \n\n\"Darn right I am,\" Ferris chuckled. \"I want to pick out the best thing you've got quickly before the rush gets here; what can you show me that'll get me rich?\" he asked as he reached the counter. \n\n\"I have quite a few items...,\" he nodded. \"...however, I must ask. You do know everything here is cursed, correct?\" \n\n\"I'm not an idiot,\" Ferris chuckled with a shake of his head. \"it's in the very uncreative name, I know they're 'cursed',\" he gestured with air quotes. \"That stuff only works if you believe in it, so show me what you've got.\" \n\n\"I don't mean to question your intelligence...,\" the clerk shook his head. \"It is merely a formality of the job. It's important to establish you're aware of the danger. You can't only believe in part of a curse; if you think it'll make you rich then the negative components work too..,\" he said. Curses were more complicated than that, but by now he knew Ferris was determined. So, he only said the things that needed to be said. \n\n\"I think I'm smart enough to tell the difference,\" Ferris nodded. \"I want to be rich today, by lunchtime would be great.\"\n\n\"Well, if you want something quick and easy...,\" the clerk reached into the display to pick up a red poker chip with a decidedly demon figure etched on the front. The clerk showed it to Ferris, and flipped it over to show the pitchfork and tail on the other side. \"... I call this one the 'Blood Token', he said. \"It's the ultimate rabbit's foot, if they were really lucky. Use this and you'll win any game of chance from a simple coin flip to scratching lottery tickets.\" \n\n\"Alright,\" Ferris nodded. It was time to put his negotiation plan into effect. \"So, your shop can appear magically out of nowhere; but, that doesn't mean I'm going to believe everything you tell me. Can I try it out first? Get some proof or something? Do you allow returns when it doesn't work?\" \n\n\"I haven't even told you how it works yet,\" the clerk chuckled and nodded. \"I've only told you what it does. However, I've got a good feeling about you. We don't normally accept returns once you leave the shop. But, I'd be glad to let you test it out before walking out the door. If it doesn't work to your satisfaction, I'll return your money.\" \n\n\"Yes! Oh wait, hold it for me!\" Ferris had a new plan all of a sudden. \"I forgot my wallet, be back in two seconds!\" he added as he dashed out the door. It was a lie; but, he bought himself enough time to dash into the convenience store next door before coming back. \n\n\"I'll take it, how much do I owe you?\" He made a show of opening his wallet to show off several hundred dollar bills. It was the majority of his savings; but, he kept it in his wallet just so anyone that sees him opening it gets an eyeful. He hoped he had enough for the token, he didn't have much more. \n\n\"$5.00 please,\" the clerk said. \n\n\"Five... hundred??\"Ferris asked. He couldn't have heard the clerk properly.\n\n\"No, just five dollars. If you have singles, that'd be great,\" the clerk said. \n\n\"You're kidding...,\" Ferris handed him a $5 bill, and he received the red token in exchange. \"It can't be this cheap, why is it so cheap?\" \n\n\"They're cursed...,\" the clerk laughed. \"If I could give them away, I would. However, they can only change owners via a transaction. $5 is just enough to not be nothing. Now, before you go testing it, I have to tell you how it works. Sorry, this part's also a little formal, curses are weird,\" he chuckled, then cleared his throat. \n\n\"Beware, although powerful, this cursed artifact will devour riches in accordance of its effects whenever you use it,\" the clerk said. \n\n\\n\\n\"Hey, you gave me the wrong thing!\" Ferris held the Blood Token in one hand as he dug into his pocket for a quarter. But, it was no longer red and instead became clean, soft white. \n\n\"It has a new owner,\" the clerk nodded. \"I feel like it won't be obvious to you, it'll change color back to red the more you use it,\" he added. \n\n\"I need to try it out,\" he said. He held his palm out to show the clerk a quarter. \"Call it in the air,\" he flipped it up, and the clerk chuckled. \n\n\"Heads,\" he said with a smile. \n\n\"Tails!\" Ferris was more ecstatic than he anticipated when he revealed the tails side up. It was a simple 50/50 chance, but he was confident the token did its thing. Still, he had to be sure. \n\n\"Again!\" he said and flipped it upward when the clerk nodded.\n\n\"Tails,\" the clerk replied. \n\n\"HEADS!\" Ferris cheered. \n\n\"ONE MORE!\" He didn't wait for the agreement and flipped the coin. \n\n\"Tails,\" the clerk repeated his previous guess. \n\n\"HEADS!\" He literally jumped for joy, like a school girl. He was excited he'd been right three times in a row; but, there was more to it than that. He had a guess about the rules of the artifact, and he looked at it to be sure. There, in the center of the perfect white token was a tiny red speck. It had worked. It was doing something, and he still had his quarter. \n\n\"I was right!\" he said with joyous glee. \"You're right though, curses are weird,\" he chuckled. \"You read the rules so formally, I knew there had to be a loophole! And, I thought to myself...,\" he was interrupted by an unexpected sigh, followed by a yawn. The excitement, and the jump especially, must have tired him out. He wasn't a young man anymore, that was for sure. But, his life would be easy from now on. \"...Well, if it doesn't state MY riches...,\" he let the thought trail off as he yawned again. \n\n\"That's a very clever interpretation,\" the clerk nodded. \"I take it you're satisfied with your purchase?\" \n\n\"Not yet! I .. uh, I just happen to have a scratch ticket on me, I've gotta try it out!\" Ferris answered as he dug the ticket out of his pocket. \n\n\"Since you're still in the store, I am required to advise you against doing that. You don't realize what you're doing,\" the clerk said. \"And, now I've advised you against it,\" he smiled. \n\n\"I like you,\" Ferris chuckled. \"When I get rich, maybe I'll buy you hot date,\" he said as he gripped the token and began rubbing off the silvery mess that was hiding his fortune. \n\n\"Two '7's' isn't much, plenty of tickets like to fake people out. But, if I get this third '7', I'm an instant millionaire!\" He paused to take in the moment that would change things forever. He scratched with his eyes closed, and then when he thought it was clear enough he opened and looked down. His knees instantly went weak and he lost his balance to collapse on the floor. \n\n\"Infinity.....wildcard????\" He couldn't even be bothered to feel embarrassed about being on the floor. He stared at the ticket just to be sure. He was so focused on getting three sevens, that he completely forgot about the higher prizes, and he found the top one. Any two numbers with an infinity wildcard paid the jackpot 1000 times. Along with the two sevens he already uncovered, he was now a billionaire. \n\n\"It's amazing!\" Ferris brought the token up to his lips to give it a kiss; but, it had changed. And, it was still changing. The red speck had bloomed to be about the size of his pinky nail, and the red seemed to be spreading out even as he watched it. \n\n\"Whoa... someone's losing a lot of money...,\" he chuckled weakly. The excitement had left him winded, and, he was now rich enough that he didn't care what anyone else thought about him being on the floor. He could nap there if he wanted to. He considered it. But, he wasn't quite that far gone into his ego yet. He didn't want to inconvenience the wonderful clerk at least. \n\n\"Hey, man. You got a couch or an office I can lay on for a few minutes? I'll give you a million bucks when I cash this in,\" he asked as he looked up at nothing. He heard footsteps as the friendly clerk walked around the counter and loomed over him. \n\n\"I apologize, my office isn't big enough for a desk, much less a couch. Although...,\" he nodded. \"...I know where you can rest. Before that, though, I'm curious about how you imagined that loophole so quickly. These are ancient objects created with magic and spite; what made you think it was limited to your riches?\" \n\n\"Heh, that's the secret. I NEVER thought it was limited to my riches. I was thinking outside the box from the very beginning,\" he said. It was a lot of talking. He paused to catch his breath, and he blinked a few times to try and clear the spots that started appearing. He'd never been this excited in his life. \"And, I proved it when I kept using the same quarter; it never took my money.\" \n\n\"Yes, forgive me. I could've asked that better. What I meant was, what made you think it was limited to your definition of riches?\" he asked. \n\n\"Huh?\" That question was harder than it should've been. Ferris' mind grew hazy. He couldn't remember why he was on the floor; but, that was okay. He was really excited about something. Everything was great. \n\n\"It is amusing though,\" The clerk chuckled as he looked down on Ferris. \"It didn't state your riches; and, it has no interest in whatever it is you think constitutes 'riches'. It's a cursed item, it knows what it wants,\" he reached down and plucked the red token out of Ferris' hand before it got cold. \"You never even asked why it's called the Blood Token,\" he chuckled as he turned to walk back to his seat behind the counter. Someone was already on the way to clean up the mess Ferris left behind.\n\n"
