All he had was $5000 in cash, a change of clothes, a pack of cigarettes, and a lighter. He sighed, pulled down the brim of his Colts hat, and stepped into the smoggy air of Indianapolis.",
        "story": "Getting kicked out of the orphanage wasn't what Blake had wished for on his 18th birthday. What he really prayed for, was that the matron would stop breathing down his neck and nagging at him to do his homework.\n\nInstead, she told him this was the last time she would ever nag at him and kicked him out. You're old enough, you're 18. No longer a child. As far as she was concerned, she had many hungry mouths to feed. Younger children who stood a better chance at adoption.\n\nNow he stood outside the door, all alone. All he had was $5000 in cash\u2014\n\n\"Wait, what orphan has $5000 right after leaving lol? If the orphanage matron couldn't afford to feed him where the money come from?\"\n\n\u2014All he had was no cash, a change of clothes, a pack of cigarettes\u2014\n\n\"Who the fuck let the kid smoke? Smoking isn't a cheap hobby yo. Where he get the money to buy a pack of smokes, dammit?\"\n\n\"Why are you such a smartass little kid? Anyway, let your grandpa Blake continue with his story okay? Moving on!\"\n\n\u2014All he had was a battered backpack with a change of clothes and his Colts hat. And a few missions. Like finding a place to stay, a job to earn money. But most importantly, who the fuck granted his stupid wish. After all, Blake was pretty darn certain he heard whispers at the back of his head when he prayed.\n\nHe wandered aimlessly in town. Concerned about being spat at or kicked out again if he entered one of those shophouses. Blake kept going until he saw a sign looking for new hires at a cafe.\n\nThe lady at the counter greeted him and asked him for his orders.\n\n\"I'm here about the job. This cafe hiring new wait staff right?\"\n\nShe nodded and gestured him to enter the backroom. And that is where she murdered him!\n\n\"Hey, gramps, not funny! I'm pretty sure that's not how the story goes!\"\n\nAlright, kiddo. Let's get back to the story. The lady, her name was Marianne, she was the owner of the cafe. Upon hearing Blake's story, she hired him on the spot.\n\n\"Lemme guess, that's grandma. This is one of those how I met your mother stories, but this time, with grandma.\"\n\n\"Marianne isn't my dear Maria!\"\n\n\u2014Anyway, Blake found a nearby shelter for the homeless where he lived there. He had a job and a roof over his head. But he had yet to discover if he was overthinking it, or if the voice who whispered at him that night was real or just...his imagination. The cafe served good food, and had a small, but dedicated clientele. Life wasn't easy, but it was alright. Blake was saving up money for reasons he wasn't sure of. Maybe buy a house one day and move out of the shelter. Get a car. Fall in love.\n\nAnd fall in love he did. With this gorgeous goddess who walked into the cafe. Such glorious long blonde hair like golden threads, luscious lips and...ah...she was so pretty, Blake just stood there as still as a totem pole instead of taking her order. Yes, your grandpa Blake was a dumbass back then. She shook him a little bit and whispered in his ear if he got her order and that's when he knew.\n\nThat was the same voice who whispered to him at night when he prayed and wished the matron of the orphanage would stop breathing down his neck. He wasn't dreaming. She was real. And she was a goddess.\n\nAfter being a typical rom-com moron who made the wrong order and spilled coffee on her dress, Blake offered to pay her back once he received his pay and gave his number to her. She gave him his number. He saved it under \"Maria\", the name she gave when he wanted to know her better.\n\n\"And you got Maria's number too.\"\n\n\"Totally did.\"\n\nAnyway, Blake called her to pay her back, but Maria turned down the money. So, they...just went out for a walk in the nearby park. And that's how we hit it off. Me, a silly mere mortal, and Maria, the goddess. Yea, your grandma was a real goddess. So beautiful, such an excellent cook. Its how your grandpa Blake knew how to cook so good. She was a great teacher.\n\nWe had children, and our children had children. Like you, little Jacob. But you see, goddesses don't stay on earth forever. They got things to do in heaven. She had to go, after a long, well at least in human terms, back to where she came from, above the skies. She left us many gifts before she went away. A car for your dad. Her bestest cookbook choke full of recipes for your mom. You got your favourite wooden horse from her, Jacob. And\u2014\n\n\"What did she leave you with?\"\n\n\"She left me with this awesome story I'm sharing with you.\"\n\n\"You just made all this up, didn't you? Grandma was cool, but she ain't a goddess.\"\n\n\"Hey, your grandpa Blake is great at cooking, don't you know? And I don't just mean food.\"\n\n\"Hah! Called it. You cooking a story again.\"\n\n\"You used to love your grandpa stories the same way you loved my food. You were such a huge fan of my cooking. So, Jacob, did I cook with this story?\"\n\n\"This one's real cheesy, but you get 10/10 because I think its something Grandma would've loved to hear from you if she were here with us.\"\n\nTogether they stood at Grandma Maria's grave, placing flowers and a bottle of her favourite sauce. Whether she was truly in heaven as a kind soul or a goddess, Jacob always did like to think she heard all of Blake's stories and chuckled at them."

        "writing_prompt": "After humans have finally discovered FTL travel, they receive a\u2014wait, what's that? A speeding ticket?",
        "story": "Some things just don't change. I got that same sinking feeling when I see police lights in the rear window, except this time, it's the viewing station of mankind's very first FTL space shuttle. Who would have guessed aliens were real, and that they had fucking space cops.\n\nThe spaceship with the blinding red and blue lights stopped beside mine. A column of light flashed in the alien ship. Said beam then shot into our space shuttle. The tentacled creature emerging from it had a black police cap and blue uniform, making me wonder if this was some universal galaxy standard.\n\n\"Greetings earthlings, who is your pilot?\" It grunted and snorted through some device which probably translated its noises into words we understood.\n\n\"That will be me,\" I replied through his little contraption, which translated my words into blorps, slorps and gurgling noises it seemed to comprehend. \"I'm Captain Raymus.\"\n\nIt tapped on another device, this time shaped like an octopus, which then spit out a piece of paper.\n\n\"Speeding ticket,\" the tone was as flat as a flatline you see in those hospital drama shows. \"You have travelled faster than light. How would you like to make payment? We accept fuel, psychic energy or precious metals.\"\n\n\"Cash?\" I tried digging the pockets of my space uniform but came up empty. \"Credit card?\"\n\n\"Is your planet registered with the Intergalactic Federation?\" The octopoid alien asked. \"If not, you may request membership in order to register your currency as one of the accepted forms of galactic trade.\"\n\n\"I'll have to speak with my supervisors on this,\" I was confused. \"Look, I'm just a test pilot. Testing out the first ever faster-than-light space shuttle, so\u2014\"\n\n\"Bwa Bwoo blorp blurp,\" the creature blobbered in a fierce tone that I was struggling to take seriously because he was so darn cute. \"That's what every race that first comes into our galaxy says. Always the same excuse. So many of you have rammed our most venerable god Cthulhu in the head while jamming your accelerators at full speed. First it was speedboats, then it was speed racers, and now FTL space shuttles. You wonder why Cthulhu is in a deep sleep, now you know,\" it waggled an angry, hissing tentacle at me.\n\n\"Wait, we humans aren't the first to invent FTL?\" I had to ask; there was so much valuable information to be had from this angry little tentacle boy in his police uniform. \"This is a new major breakthrough for us.\"\n\n\"Listen here, meatbag,\" the crackling voice from his translator bore the same anger as he did. \"Cthulhu has been here for eons. Many entities have shared this space with us before you learnt to light a fire. You humans ain't the first ones to discover faster than light travel. Some have done it centuries before you. Your major breakthrough is little toy. Xylonians have wormholes. Zandarians have interdimensional teleportation and space portals. There's Zmass Effectual Transportation. None of which would smash through the flesh of our god at faster-than-light speeds. So take your goddamned speed ticket and pay the fine. Since you're new, you have a one month limit to do so.\"\n\n\"And if I don't?\"\n\n\"We will vaporize your spaceship and feed you to our god,\" the alien glared at me with its many eyes.\n\nI scratched my chin. \"Isn't that punishment overly harsh for a speeding offense? It's a very minor offense. Perhaps we can negotiate, I know a friend of Cthulhu's, he can talk to you, or your god. He's octopus-shaped, lives in Innsmouth and\u2014\"\n\n\"To you humans, is small offense,\" it pouted at me and jabbed a tentacle at my chest. \"To us, you hit our god, that is big offense. I will beam back to my spaceship. Pay the fine as stipulated on your ticket within a month, or I will hunt you down to the edges of reality. There is no negotiation.\"\n\nI raised my hands in surrender. \"Fine, fine, I'll work something out with my bosses.\"\n\n\"Good meatbag. I look forward to your timely payment of your fine,\" it saluted me with a tentacle. \"I shall take my leave.\"\n\n\"Wait, I have some cheesecake in the fridge. Do you want some?\" I offered, pointing to the pantry. \"Do you think I could get a little deduction if you like it? Maybe have this penalty reduced to a warning.\"\n\n\"I cannot deduct your fine. You must pay exactly what is stated on ticket in an acceptable form of payment as listed,\" little octopus alien cop stood his ground. \"But I can delay your deadline or...\" he paused to sniff the slice of cake I brought out from the fridge in the pantry. \"I like this. This is soo divine, exquisite. Oh la la. You know what, human? I will shred your speeding ticket and print a warning ticket. There is no second time. Goodbye Captain Raymus.\"\n\nWith a flourish of happy tentacles, the alien cop beamed out of my space shuttle and back into his own, then blasted off into space in a few seconds.\n\nSome things just don't change. That weird mutant octopus god I met on earth loves cheesecake, and turns out, weird mutant octopus alien cop loves it as much as he does. Can't wait to tell him when I return to Earth and head back to Innsmouth. I bet Elvari will get a kick out of knowing that space octopuses have the same taste in desserts as he does."

        "story": "\"Big Foot is on the list?\" Lionel pointed at the list of animals on earth given to him. \"That's a legit choice?\"\n\n\"Is it so peculiar?\" I asked, spreading my arms. \"You won a lucky draw to be granted a wish to transform into any animal. In my town, where humans live alongside supernatural beings and entities of the Deep. You are talking to an eldritch god. Why does the existence of Big Foot surprise you this much?\"\n\nLionel shrugged. \"Always thought that was just a myth.\"\n\n\"I could grant your wish to be Big Foot.\"\n\n\"I'm not done flipping through this list,\" the human continued browsing my catalogue. \"Gotta say, your selection is crazy. Like shoggoths? Chthonians? Really?\"\n\n\"For as long as they exist on this earth, they are in this most comprehensive list. Even if some of these species are not native to earth,\" I nodded while sipping my tea. \"And as long as there is one specimen that roams the lands, I can make it happen.\"\n\n\"Is Big Foot native to earth?\" Lionel perked up with sparkling curiosity.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe deflated instantly. Ah, inquisitive humans always wanting the strange, bizarre options. Suddenly Big Foot wasn't such an attractive option now that he was told it was an earthly creation and not some migrant from the Abyss.\n\n\"Elder Things? Wow I\u2014\"\n\nI accidentally crushed the teacup in my hands and spilled my tea all over my robes.\n\n\"Lionel, that must be a mistake by one of my employees. The Elder Things may have once lived on earth, but they're dead. Extinct,\" I pressed a tentacle on the catalogue while my hands were occupied, wiping the mess I made. \"Pick something else. Anything else.\"\n\n\"So, they're not just fictional things Lovecraft came up with,\" he was deep in thought. \"Make me one of them! I want to go to Antartica. See the ruins discovered by the Miskatonic University. Dig their deepest, darkest secrets. Climb the Mountains of\u2014\"\n\n\"I will not allow it,\" I had to be firm on this one. \"No mortal should step into the Mountains of Madness. The Six-Star City buried beneath the snow must stay that way.\"\n\nHe was laughing. \"Did I hear correctly? The Eldritch God of Madness, Lord Elvari, telling me to stay away from the Mountains of Madness? Are you afraid?\"\n\n\"Your mind is not equipped to comprehend the shared memories of the Elder Things. The horrors they witnessed and fought against,\" I flipped through several pages to point to the page on dragons. \"Many humans like dragons. Huge, majestic beasts. Intelligent and long-lived. What's not to like about a dragon?\"\n\n\"This thing, next to Elder Thing, I can't even read the text,\" Lionel forcibly turned the pages back. \"But I want whatever that mysterious creature that is.\"\n\n\"You can't even comprehend the name, and you want that? It is in R'lyehian, an eldritch language of the Abyss,\" His mindset was frustrating to deal with, as much as this clerical error was. \"No human mind or soul was made to grasp\u2014\"\n\n\"Only one way to find out.\"\n\n\"No, I've made that mistake once,\" I stared deep into the man's soul and sighed. The depths of his determination to get that forbidden fruit only grew stronger the more I denied him of the obvious dangers ahead. \"But if you must, I insist you sign a contract stating that I am to bear no responsibility for the consequences of your wish and subsequent decisions and actions that come after it.\"\n\nHe signed it. Bound by my promise to honor the results of the lucky draw, his wish would be granted.\n\n**\n---\n\n\"Is it dead?\" The monster hunter Carmen asked me, her rifle still pointed at the twitching mass of faces that melted off this carcass like low-grade Halloween masks. Its toros splitting apart akin to a cracked melon, flailing appendages bending at bizarre angles. \"What in the fucking Abyss was that thing?\"\n\n\"It is truly dead,\" I replied, my gaze fixed upon the entity transformed by a wish. \"You are only witnessing the final death spasms of a monster that the Elder Things created as a living weapon many years ago, only for it to turn against its masters.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't it be a frozen popsicle alongside the rest of the Elder Things found in Antartica?\" Carmen's expression was a mix of disgust and morbid curiosity. \"Elvari, you owe me an explanation.\"\n\n\"It is a long story,\" I cleared my throat. \"One that started with a wish...\""

She'd mistake you for a pile of dog chum and nobody would fuckin' blame her for it!\"\n\n\"Did you think I was one of those cartoon villains you fight for fun on live TV for an adoring audience? My plan is already in motion. I completed my task list two weeks ago. You see, I'm telling you my plan just to watch you squirm. I can confidently share these details for two reasons : It is already too late to stop me. Oh, and nobody will believe you. Not after that Scamgate scandal. Confidence in superheroes are at their lowest.\"\n\n\"Clockmaster can go back in time! He is never too late to stop you.\"\n\n\"If only he wasn't on my payroll.\"\n\n\"What? When did the fuck did that happen?\"\n\n\"While you weren't looking. Let's be honest. You're an ass. I don't believe in petty little things that don't affect my grand plans. But you? You do stupid shit such as breaking Clockmaster's favourite limited edition pocket watch while drunk.\"\n\n\"That's it? He quit the Hero League to join you over that?\"\n\n\"That was merely the straw that broke the camel's back. If you thought you could do only good, you don't know yourself, or your team mates all that well. They hate you. Every single one of them. Valiant's skull is so thick you couldn't penetrate it with radiation. You ever heard that one? You're only the face of the League because you're handsome. Because you can sell Hero League merch. But deep inside, if they could help it, those heroes don't want to work with you. Don't want to come save you.\"\n\n\"This cannot be! I'm supposed to scout ahead until they disabled all your traps and joined me in your throne room!\"\n\n\"That's what they told you.\"\n\n\"No...\"\n\n\"This is a setup. Now if you'll excuse me, it is time I chuck you into that aircraft. It will be dropping its radioactive payload over Washington. Perhaps it will become a wasteland like New York. Perhaps not. Maybe, the superheroes of Hero League will band together to stop it. And you, Valiant, you'll be quite the martyr, fighting to control the aircraft and trying, but failing to stop it from exploding.\"\n\n\"I won't play into your game! We'll see what happens if I don't try to stop\u2014\"\n\n\"You won't stop this aircraft? Doesn't matter, for as long as you perish within. And I'm not a bond villain. I have surveillance built inside, and I will watch you die. Are you not a fan of escape games? Valiant, let's see you make a valiant escape.\"\n\n**\n---\n\nValiant didn't think the self-proclaimed Dark Lord Vandemar would make it so easy by slipping the key into his palm. Almost like a mockery, as though he was so sure the superhero wouldn't be able to break the chains. He felt almost, just almost ashamed to use the key than his superstrength to break through. This wasn't the time to talk about saving face when he was aboard an aircraft on autopilot, set to crash into Washington.\n\nRushing to the control room completely unopposed, he saw that the control panels were badly damaged. There was no way to land the plane safely or communicate. As if Vandemar needed to mock Valiant further, steering the plane worked. Just egging him to turn the aircraft away from Washington. Send it diving into an isolated place where he'd die alone. Where nobody would know it was him.\n\nThe Dark Lord knew him well. Valiant hated the idea of performing heroics nobody would see. Almost as much as how tempting it was to slam the plane into the Hero League HQ after being told of all the bullshit they whispered behind his back. But if there was one thing Vandemar got wrong, despite all of Valiant's faults, the dark lord seemed to have forgotten why Valiant became a superhero in the first place.\n\nWith a sigh, Valiant sat down on the empty pilot's chair and began steering the plane upwards. He would push the aircraft past the atmosphere and into space. It wasn't made for space travel, this much he knew, but he was banking on burning up and never landing. Better to burn brightly than fizzle out quietly."

        "story": "**Tinseltown's Most Terrific Tea Party! Admission is Free for All!**\n\nCarl hammered the sign down on the cracking concrete in front of the rusted, disused warehouse and stared at his partner Ralph. \"Bro, you sure this is going to lure in that pesky detective who keeps foiling Boss Bernando's plans?\"\n\n\"Carl, you dumbass!\" Ralph slapped him on the back of his head with a goat plush toy. \"Didn't boss make it clear? We're kidnapping the loved one of Detective Watson as bait. She wouldn't fall for such an elementary trick. But her dorky boyfriend will.\"\n\n\"Right, right. So, what do we know about Katrina Watson's boyfriend?\"\n\n\"He's obsessed with tea and cakes, and goats,\" Ralph read his briefing notes. \"We're serving chamomile tea, strawberry cheesecakes and he can go pet some goats at the back of this warehouse.\"\n\n\"What does he look like?\"\n\n\"Some goth LARPer who dresses like a necromancer in black robes. Pale, white-haired guy.\"\n\n\"That one?\" Carl pointed to the strange man sauntering towards them on...tentacles? Those have got to be some fake animatronic, right?\n\nRalph nodded, \"That one.\"\n\n\"Greetings humans!\" Their target waved at them with a cheery grin. \"Ah, the Tinseltown's Tea Party! Boy, am I glad to have free flow of tea and cakes! Where do I register?\"\n\n\"The guestbook's right here,\" Ralph presented to him the book he purchased from Poppa's Art and Craft shop just twenty minutes ago. \"Sign here.\"\n\n*Lord Elvari was here! :D*\n\n*Who doesn't love tea parties! :P*\n\n\"There! I've signed it. Let's get down to the party, shall we?\" He rubbed his hands, and those oddly realistic tentacles together. \"You can't have free lunches all the time, but I'm sure am glad free tea parties exist!\"\n\nCarl kept his head down and his mouth shut while Ralph led their gullible and eager target inside. The cheap plastic utensils, scrappy tablecloth they bought off a second-hand goods store, and the paltry Christmas decorations they salvaged from an impoverished orphanage, would that dork really buy it? About the only thing that costed more than pocket change was the exquisite porcelain teapot and silver serving platter for the cake. That's the most important things, Ralph said. The things that their target would focus on. And the tea, of course.\n\n\"You sure do have many armed guards for a simple tea party,\" Elvari scanned the sparsely decorated warehouse and pointed towards the gang members standing by armed and ready.\n\n\"Yea, we want to ensure our VIP party guest is secure in our premises,\" Ralph said. \"That'll be you, our honored guest.\"\n\n\"Why, thank you. How very considerate of you.\"\n\n\"Only the best for our guest,\" Ralph forced a smile on his face and gestured his kidnapping target towards the sole table and chair in the area. \"Would you like to take a seat and enjoy what we have to offer?\"\n\nThe weirdo in black robes plopped himself down on the chair and poured himself some tea. No sooner than he aimed his fork towards the cheesecake, the warehouse door slammed open.\n\n\"Freeze!\" Detective Katrina Watson shouted as she aimed her gun towards Ralph. \"You're under arrest for kidnapping...Elvari?\"\n\n\"Kidnapping?\" He sounded displeased. \"I was told this was a tea party!\"\n\n\"It's a kidnapping,\" Carl pressed the muzzle of his gun against Elvari's head. \"Detective, take a step closer and I'll blow his brains out.\"\n\n\"Which brain?\" Elvari asked in the puzzled tone. \"I have nine of these squiggly organs you call brains.\"\n\n\"Oh god Elvari, this is not the time for jokes!\" Kat bemoaned. \"Not when you're the target of a kidnapping attempt.\"\n\n\"But I do actually have nine brains in total...\" he pouted and tented his tentacles. \"I know...they've been accused of sharing one same braincell at times, but they're still nine separate brains.\"\n\n\"Boys, I'd advise you put your guns down,\" Kat spoke to the armed gangsters surrounding them. \"You have picked literally the worst target to kidnap to impede my investigations. Not because he's a big dork who thinks there could be a real tea party in an abandoned warehouse. Because he's an actual eldritch deity who could shatter your minds and have you pissing in your diapers in a psychiatric ward for life.\"\n\nThe men backed away with their guns down. A few ran out the door and never looked back. Ralph kept his gun on Kat, while Carl \u2014\n\n*Bang!*\n\nBlood trickled down from the side of Elvari's head. He sat still, eyes wide open, before blinking.\n\n\"That wasn't very nice of you,\" he frowned while his tentacles hissed angrily. \"I was suspicious of the abandoned warehouse setup, but the tea was just too good, so I thought I should be a gracious guest and play along. But playtime's over.\"\n\nA tentacle coiled around Carl's hand to twist it until audible cracking sounds echoed across the room, alongside the gangster's screams. His gun fell to the floor, as did his knees crashed down onto the concrete. Ralph let out gurgling noises when a tentacle throttled his throat. Both unable to protest while tentacles slapped them repeatedly in their faces. Elvari continued to sip his tea and stuffed his face with cake like it was a pleasant afternoon at his favourite cafe and totally not punishing two gangsters for a failed kidnapping attempt at an old warehouse.\n\n\"Elvari? You can stop now,\" Kat squeezed his shoulder. \"I've notified Officer Jenkins to come by and make an arrest, so please leave those two to be recognizable by other scam victims at a line-up, okay?"
