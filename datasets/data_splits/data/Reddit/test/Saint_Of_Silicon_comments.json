        "story": "Our future was bright. We had done away with the barbaric wars of our past, and ushered in an era of prosperity. Our understanding of nature advanced, and with it grew our technology. Fusions of the arcane and the mechanical, both powers complementing each other. But then came the Magorath.\n\nWhat we thought to be a minor asteroid streaked across the sky, creating a shock wave that shattered glass and flattened trees for miles. The first to reach the site were horrified by what they discovered. Writhing things so much like flesh, already spreading from the center of the impact crater. The messenger reported that the mass had dragged his companion screaming into the biomass.\n\nWe had not experienced major conflict in two generations. Our weapons had stagnated, it was thought they would never be needed again. We had such hope that these aliens could be negotiated with. Surely there was much we could have taught each other. But every effort to parley was ignored, and several highly respected diplomats were brutally murdered in the attempts to do so.\n\nWe rushed to turn plowshares into swords. The first battle mages in decades were hurriedly trained. Wands of incinerating flames were mass produced, and every able bodied person was in some way mobilized. The engines of war were reawakened, veterans too elderly to fight trained our young people. We had to relearn how to weave destructive spells, as well as how to manufacture arms. The only thing that seemed to slow down the Magorath was fire.\n\nThe Magorath grew at a horrifying rate, building a horrible city of flesh in the center of a blight hundreds of miles in radius. No attempt at negotiation, simply a ravenous hunger for more. Sacred places were consumed. The great arbors of Doria, the glass city of Coro, the spires of Gillia. Irreplaceable artifacts, locations at the core of our shared history and identity. They could not be reclaimed. Even if the Magorath could be pushed back, the purifying fire needed to do so would leave those sites little more than ashes.\n\nMages fought, burning scars into the land that would never go away. Fire and lightning, mana and blood. We began by trying to preserve the lives of our soldiers every way we could, but warm bodies were one of the few things we were not short on. What were a few hundred bright sparks compared to our total annihilation? Mages, barely trained enough to refrain from causing themselves to explode, were sent to the front, forced to learn in a crucible that killed or maimed so many.\n\nSuch was our desperation, that we turned to magics forbidden even when the nations of our world squabbled. Tinkering with disease, horrific experiments on things that still drew breath. The scientists and administrators who initiated the projects knew that history would judge them harshly, but also that their actions would be necessary if there was ever to be a historical account of our struggle. Samples of Magorath biomass were taken, and attempts were made to create arcane and chemical weapons tailored to fight the alien menace.\n\nFeverishly working, fast enough to avoid thinking of the horrible powers that were being tapped. Until, about a year into the conflict, the first of their weapons were ready. The Thaumic Plague was unleashed, spreading from the initiation site throughout the mass of pulsing tendrils and grotesque structures. In days, it was over. The Magorath had no defense against a weapon such as this, any protection it mustered being overcome by the Plague's mutations.\n\nThe means of our victory were explained to the world, and the world recoiled. We had defeated the hated enemy, but we had also opened a new and terrifying angle. The remilitarization meant that nations might once again send soldiers to die in wars of influence and conquest. But now, it was known that such terrible weapons were possible, and that we could very well destroy ourselves with the research needed to save us from the alien threat. Had we doomed ourselves with the very act that had preserved us against the Magorath?"

In desperation, they must find civilizations and a way to communicate them else they will be trapped on Earth. You are on such an exploration team.",
        "story": "The paradigm of materialism reigned for so long, most thinkers thought it was simply a fact. But we know better now. The realm of the mind exists separate from the physical, and the laws of this realm are different. One can will their seat of consciousness to pass through vast distances at many times the speed of light. We managed to give our explorers another sense, to make a mental map of the positions of stars in order to maintain their bearings on journeys across galaxies.\n\nOur exploration began in innocence. We were curious, seeking to better understand the wonder of the universe and all of its phenomena. We mapped countless exciting astrophysical discoveries, expanded our theories for predicting the material world. But one thing eluded us, intelligent life. We found many worlds with simple organisms, a few that even had creatures complex enough to have minds we could interact with. But they were all so very far from sapience. We accepted that the search would simply take a long time, and the universe was simply too big for us to be alone.\n\nBut trouble was brewing on the home front. Our mastery of the material world continued to accelerate. Despite our best efforts to direct the course of technological expansion, profoundly dangerous projects were undertaken. Then came The Plagues. We never learned where they started or who created them. Such information was lost to history. But our civilization was dealt a terrible blow. Billions were slaughtered by the diseases over the course of five years. The diseases were all designed to be impossible to defend against, constantly mutating to stay ahead of immune systems and other measures taken to halt the spread.\n\nFrom twelve billion to several hundred million in only two decades. The threat of new, even more terrible weapons that could be created by rogue actors loomed large over everything. The ecosystem too had been ravaged, both by our industry and The Plagues. Our world would not last forever, and we needed a means of escape.\n\nSo we began to search for another technological civilization. The thought was that we could speak to this hypothetical civilization, and ask them to create vessels for our minds. We would abandon our home world and our natural bodies, and take up residence in the alien produced vessels. We threw all our resources into this search.\n\nTime passed, we absorbed more losses. Lower population density slowed further pathogens, but some entered a sort of stasis, waiting to invade the body of the unlucky soul that made contact. Trillions of stars were searched, each decade whittling down our numbers. Our cradle was dying, but we could find no place to evacuate to.\n\nUntil, after so much time, we found a world that hosted a civilization of intelligent beings. They called themselves the Lutok. Their technological development had stagnated at a point similar to our bronze age. But they could see our projected spirits. We began to build bridges, fostering understanding and cooperation. Their languages did not have all the concepts we needed to fully explain ourselves, but we began to help them grow. Both for their betterment and our own need to escape.\n\nWe had to balance things. We could not allow their cultural development to lag behind the growth of their technology. We had already seen what misused wonder science could do to an entire planet. We taught them to be diplomatic instead of hawkish, altruistic instead of being self centered. It was not easy, and our own destruction loomed large in our minds as we uplifted them.\n\nTime equivalent to 250 years passed. Most surviving humans on Earth lived in closed system bunkers, the ecosystem a shadow of what it had once been. The Lutok were finally reaching the level of advancement necessary to create new bodies for our minds to attach to. The Lutok adored us, but there were not many of us left. We began to transfer. In the end, only ten million humans had survived to reach this point. Stepping across time and space, we were embodied on an alien world.\n\nOur goal was simple. We would prevent the Lutok from destroying themselves and their world, as we had done. Like adoptive parents, we would continue to steer their development. We shared many of the technologies we had deemed safe, and facilitated the regulations necessary to avoid creating suicide pact technologies. As I write, they are growing. The future is not certain, but our experience and guidance gives the Lutok a much better chance than we ever had. We are aggressively pushing them to create closed biospheres in order to preserve their ecosystems in case of tragedy, and to spread life to other worlds. We have come within a hair's breadth of extinction, and the wonder of intelligent life can not be allowed to die."

        "writing_prompt": "When the villain asked you how you didn't go insane from the constant evil thoughts they were whispering in the back of you mind, you were not sure how to explain that this is your normal state of mind and you didn't even notice anything had changed.",
        "story": "I know there was a time, a time when dark things did not fester in the lower layers of my mind. It was so long ago that I don't remember what it was like to not carry it with me everywhere. I remember when the content of my thoughts disturbed me, but now they are simply a part of my normal life. Horrific notions pass through my mind, but they do not loiter if I do not fixate upon them. The terrifying has become my status quo.\n\nDespite the state of my mind, I am a hero. I have saved many lives, and fought many monsters. In a way, the undercurrent of madness has made me stronger. I can look into the eyes of beasts meant to break your mind, and feel their efforts to perturb my calm roll off of me like rain on glass. People look to me as a foundation, an unshakable constant in their lives. They do not know why I am able to withstand the horror, only that it gives them hope.\n\nI have a mundane identity. I am supported by various government programs for heroes, so that I can work full time fighting villains and monsters. I climb the stairs to my apartment after a stroll in a nearby park, but I notice something is off. I locked the door behind me, but it is now unlocked. My pupils narrow, this might be dangerous. I enter with my wits about me, stepping cautiously forward and turning on lights. Then I see him, a man dressed in red and black, sitting in one of my living room chairs. I know that costume. He is Orpheus, a B tier villain who operates in the city.\n\nMy first instinct is to prepare for a brawl. Invading a hero or villain's personal life is against the rules of the games we play. But he is nonthreatening. \"I am sorry to intrude, but please, sit,\" he says, gesturing to the chair opposite him.\n\nI tilt my head, then take a seat, \"What the hell are you doing in my apartment?\"\n\n\"It will take some explaining. You'll likely be angry with me, but I simply had to know. Do you know what my powers are?\"\n\n\"I have a vague idea. Stuff involving telepathy and illusions.\"\n\n\"You know enough to understand then. I have been... experimenting on you for quite some time. I have driven people mad before, but despite my full attention for several months, you are every bit as stable as you've ever been. My question is... how?\"\n\nI glare at him. I hesitate to share any information with a villain, especially one who just confessed to trying to drive me insane. But he seems genuine now. I decide I will humor him. \"You could say that my inner world is already deeply unpleasant. I came from a deeply upsetting background. You say you've been doing it for months? I haven't even noticed a change.\"\n\nThere is fear in the man's eyes. \"If it weren't for the overwhelming evidence that you seem to be functioning, I wouldn't believe you. Do you have any idea how quickly a normal person would crumple beneath that psychological weight? You have my respect.\"\n\n\"You really shouldn't go around trying to drive good people insane. Or anyone for that matter.\"\n\n\"I told myself that it was okay for me to be bad, with what I had been through. But you challenge that notion more than anyone else I have ever encountered. Your inner world is hell, yet you are utterly devoted to doing good. Your existence is causing my excuses to fall apart. How? How are you able to be you?\"\n\n\"You get used to it,\" I say, then, after pausing briefly, \"Would you like to join the white hats? You could do a lot of good with your gift.\"\n\nThere is silence for a while, then Orpheus speaks, \"I... I will consider it. I have a lot of things I have to think about.\" With that, he rises and strides out of the door.\n\nSeveral months later, Orpheus signs a contract with the agency that employs me. In exchange for amnesty from his earlier crimes, he will serve alongside myself and other heroes. I smile knowingly at him, clapping a hand on his shoulder. \"Good choice.\""

        "writing_prompt": "The people are oppressed by the empire, and in their sorrow they seek a Messiah figure. The empire, rather than wait for such a figure to appear, decides to create their own fake one. This backfires.",
        "story": "I see myself as more of an innovator in the methods of social organization and control, not a 'tyrant.' My leadership and organization allowed our once humble nation to conquer the entire continent. Our castes serve their functions, from the lowliest peasant to the highest noble. But, of course, there is discontent. Peasants whose only connection to the past are excessively rosy tales from the time before me and mine rose to power. Their lives are better than they were, but still, they refuse to know their place. They tell stories of a figure, a hero who will rise from their ranks and liberate them from their manacles.\n\nFor a long time, I regarded these quasi religious notions of deliverance as being little more than an irritant. But, as I pondered, I saw that it might be an opportunity. What if I were to present one of my loyal lackeys to the masses, only for them to turn around and bend the knee before me as the rightful ruler of the empire. After all, I did not reach this position, the most powerful man in the world, by thinking inside the box.\n\nOur puppet is found. I have him trained in sleight of hand and basic illusion magic, so that he may perform 'miracles.' He is given general instructions, and inserted into one of the more populated villages. It takes a month for news of him to be picked up by one of my spy networks. The peasants have bought it, hook, line, and sinker. The pseudo religion centered around my servant is spreading like wildfire.\n\nI allow things to continue for about four months. The plan is working remarkably well, but the time has come to reap what I have sown. I send the coded message indicating my puppet to bring his flock in line with my goals, and bend the knee.\n\nTime passes,but  I receive no news of the messiah swearing loyalty to me. I send another messenger, but never hear back from her, either. The peasants throughout an entire province are on the verge of revolt. I realize that my puppet, chosen for dullness and servility, has turned on me. The situation is rapidly spiraling out of control.\n\nI consider having him killed, but that would make him a martyr, compounding the issue. My only hope is that he can be paid off with an elevation of status. He could serve as one of my governors, until the public excitement around him died and he could be killed quietly. The heralds I send with the new offer never return. All of my other armies are too distant, I am not dumb enough to order troops to attack people from the province they grew up in.\n\nI send orders to pull two armies back to the capital. Two days later, the siege begins. A massive rabble of undisciplined peasants, but they outnumber the soldiers I have in the area seven to one.\n\nThe walls hold for months. Morale is low. We are not sure when or if help will arrive. Until, one day in the early morning, I hear the screams. My armies have arrived, and the peasant uprising is obliterated. The traitor is killed in the chaos, but it is over. The threat has been dealt with, and I have learned a valuable lesson.\n\nBut then, as things limp back to the status quo, my spy networks light up. Like embers lofted by updrafts, notions of rebellion, of avenging a messiah, have spread across the agricultural heart of the empire. I simply lack the resources required to stomp all of them out before they explode into rebellions on their own. I thought it had been dealt with, but it seems the insurrection had only just begun. None of my past experiments had yielded such catastrophic results.\n\nArmies are used to cow the populace, each brigade assigned as far from its home land as possible. I begin a massive propaganda campaign, one involving every trick of rhetoric to convince people it was in fact me who was the messiah. I had been chosen, and all the people would need to do for deliverance was bend the knee, serve me as quietly and loyally as they did before the false prophet began his heresy. Books were rewritten, alternate histories edited out of the public consciousness.\n\nMy manipulation worked, but it was not without cost. I had to lower taxes on the peasantry, and implement some reforms allowing greater participation in the affairs of government. I was the god emperor now, but I needed political fodder to deceive people into thinking I was a benevolent and gentle ruler. The crisis was over, but it had forced a fundamental change. I could never allow myself, or whoever ascended to the throne after me, to make such blunders again. To never, ever underestimate the power of religion and faith."

        "writing_prompt": "A princess is imprisoned in an abandoned tower that once belonged to a wizard. The princess spends years slowly learning the art of wizardry from the scraps of arcane lore the wizard left behind, until finally becoming powerful enough to escape from her tower and take revenge upon her captors.",
        "story": "I was a threat to the succession, and the whole kingdom knew it. I was more popular with the people, but my older brother had the noble houses in his pocket. I knew he would make a move on me, I was too much of a threat to his power, but I did not expect the hammer to fall as soon as it did.  Bundled out of the castle, my head was placed in a black sack. Days of bumpy carriage rides, my throat parched from lack of water. Then, with little ceremony, it stopped. I saw I was outside of one of the great wizard towers of old. Shoved inside, the door sealed. In my pocket, I found a note from my brother, \"Understand that I could have had you killed. Your tenure at the tower is an act of mercy on my part. The enchanted kitchen will provide you with all the food and water you will need. There is no way out, but I believe a lifetime imprisonment is preferable to death.\"\n\nI fumed, furious. I ran up the stairs, trying every window and door. Wizard towers were usually made to be secure, and apparently this one was no exception. The closest thing to an opening was the glass ceiling of the highest spire. All of the obvious routes of escape had been blocked, but perhaps there had been some small oversight. I accepted that I would be there, at least for a while.\n\nI committed each floor and room to memory. There was still a well stocked library, and a vast trove of what I assume to be the old wizard's notes. Most of them were written in some code, wizards did not like to share what they learned with potential rivals. The food from the kitchen was bland, but apparently limitless. The privy seemed to clean itself. I had an enormous amount of free time in my hands, but despite intensive search, there was no way out.\n\nI had never had much flare for magic, the art did not come to me naturally. I began to meditate for hours at a time, and as I looked inside myself, I realized something. The spark was there, I simply had been too consumed with the outer world to notice it. I began to read voraciously. In two months, I could cast beginner level spells like mage light. My head was filled with symbols, gestures, and words. I would test the seals holding me prisoner to no avail, this tower was made to hold up against a full blown siege from other powerful wizards. What hope did a novice have?\n\nI exhausted the library in two years, there was nothing in it powerful enough to enable my escape. I realized my only hope was breaking the cypher on the old wizard's notes. It took me six months to gain a toehold, discover a few reliable patterns. Work accelerated. In nine more months, I could translate his work. They were made for arcane masters, I almost blew myself up when I fumbled one of them. But I learned, my understanding deepened with study and practice.\n\nIt became clear that I would need more brute force to have any hope of breaking the seal. It took decades for a wizard's magical capacity to reach its limit, and I had only been at it for three years. I could feel the power growing inside, but it would take time. I began to plan, plan what I would do to the treacherous bastards who tried to dispose of me.\n\nFive more years. With nothing else to do, I had become an expert in the arcane arts. My power lagged behind my understanding, but it was enough. With a crack of lightning and splintering wood, the door burst open. I tasted the fresh air. Freedom. Now, to exact vengeance.\n\nThe land had been ravaged by war, that much was clear. Burned villages and fallow fields. I carried a large amount of food with me from the infinite kitchen, so the desolation was not much of an impediment. I was not sure where in the country I was, but all of the roads ultimately led to the capitol. I would reach it eventually, and when I did, I would rain hell upon the bastards.\n\nI reached one of the cities, Westirioth. There I learned what had occurred. Two years after my imprisonment, civil war had come. The nobles had failed utterly in appeasing the peasantry and artisans, and the consequence was mass bloodshed. Brother had fought brother, but in the end, the upstarts were the victors. Apparently, my brother and his allies were already thoroughly dead.\n\nRevenge had been my goal for so long that its loss made me feel empty. I wanted to rend their flesh with a storm of ice and lightning, but others had done it for me. What to do? Then I saw an opportunity. The people would remember me, I had held their favor prior to my abduction. Perhaps I, now a wizard, could find a place in the new government.\n\nI was treated with suspicion at first, but several of my former servants were able to vouch for my identity. The government of the recently founded republic saw fit to employ me, and I became the head of a newly created agency of magical practice and research. I would have a voice in many governmental affairs, and the future seemed far brighter now than during the time of my departure. I would give all I could to help the nascent democracy succeed."
