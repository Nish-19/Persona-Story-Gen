Only to find when they are reviewing the \u201cjunk,\u201d their home is completely filled with once believed lost historical artifacts.",
        "story": "There was a Camera crew outside. That was strange. One of the things that had been critical to Elaine when they\u2019d been picking out their home had been that it was in a quieter neighborhood. It meant she didn\u2019t need to see things, explain things or explain things she didn\u2019t feel like explaining.\n\nBut there they were, in the middle of the sleepy neighborhood. With a sharply dressed hostess swearing at a clipboard.\n\nElaine let the curtains close. She had things to do today. A memoir to pen. A dinner to make. A child to entertain. A younger woman could have rubbernecked for a little longer, and an older woman could have too, but now?\n\nSomehow after retiring from the old work, Elaine felt busier than ever.\n\nThen, a sharp knock at the door.\n\nElaine had a philosophy about someone knocking. The first was a test for the weak hearted that trapped you into speaking to solicitors. The second was when someone needed you.\n\nThe person at the door knocked again.\n\nElaine huffed. But still got the door.\n\nThe woman at the door- or should Elaine say hostess- was prim and proper, already holding a microphone out to Elaine before she\u2019d managed to step into the doorway.\n\n\u201cHi! We\u2019re from channel four\u2019s Hoarders, and we\u2019re here to help you!\u201d The woman was beaming the entire time and laying it on entirely too thick.\n\n\u201cI think you have the wrong house,\u201d Eline answered before almost closing the door. She would have closed it the whole way, but a shined pink pump stuck itself in the crack.\n\n\u201cThis is 48 Hagathar Way?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\n\u201cA member of your household called us and said you needed help. Now. I know this can be hard but we\u2019re here to help you and\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cHoarders.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike the garbage house show?\u201d Elaine asked.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to call it a garbage house. We understand that you\u2019re struggling and\u2026\u201d the woman watched as Elaine opened the door back up. \u201cMay we come inside?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo?\u201d\n\n\u201cMom! Are those the people?\u201d Came a young voice from upstairs.\n\n\u201cWhat. People?\u201d Elaine asked in a voice usually reserved for using Cassandra\u2019s full name.\n\n\u201cThe hoarders people! I called them. One\u2014\u201c The girl stomped around upstairs to put herself together.\n\n\u201cCassandra Halland Ravensview!\u201d There it was.\n\n\u201cOne second, Mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Elaine turned back to the confused crew. \u201cShe does stuff like this. Doesn\u2019t know what kind of trouble you can start with a phone. What kid does, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, we\u2019re here to help,\u201d the Hostess said.\n\n\u201cGods.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my god! Linda Breakgale!\u201d Cass screamed from halfway down the stairs.\n\n\u201cThe one and only!\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on! I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\n\n\u201cShow her what, Cass?\u201d Elaine hissed.\n\n\u201cAll the junk! Come on.\u201d\n\nThe Hostess took a step forward, which gave Elaine a choice. She could either stay in the way and stop the woman, or try and talk her way out of this\u2026\n\nOr maybe it was time for \u2018that\u2019 conversation.\n\n\u201cCome in,\u201d Elaine said, but she still rolled her eyes as she said it.\n\n\u201cThank you so much for coming,\u201d Cass chattered, she spoke quickly at the best of times and now excitement had added its flair. \u201cI watch your show all the time online and I\u2019m so happy we can finally get my parents some help with the basement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe basement?\u201d The Hostess asked.\n\n\u201cYeah the basement. It\u2019s totally stuffed. It\u2019s nuts.\u201d Cass answered.\n\nThe Hostess looked over at Elaine.\n\n\u201cBy all means, follow the kid.\u201d\n\nCass was already at the top of the basement stairs, her sock covered feet almost sliding past it. She undid the bolt on the top of the door, a remainder of her toddler days, and flung open the door.\n\nGlittering golden light poured from the basement and showered the hall way of a shining coat of avarice.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all down here!\u201d Cass insisted.\n\nThe Hostess was less eager to follow this time, but after a moment she waved the camera man who\u2019d been following her forward. Elaine let him pass.\n\n\u201cSee? Look at this junk?\u201d Cass started down the stairs before the camera was around the corner, and was running back up just as they rounded it. \u201cLook!\u201d\n\nCass held her prize out to Linda Breakgale, who, for the first time in modern memory, was speechless on camera.\n\nIn the nine-year-old girl\u2019s hands, was a shining sapphire blade, cut from a single massive stone with runic instructions on either side of the blade. It caught impossible light, and smelled like the sea breeze.\n\n\u201cSee? Who even has stuff like this?\u201d Cass asked before she dropped the blade and went back downstairs to find another prize.\n\nLinda hesitated about catching a sword, so Elaine swooped in. After a moment, the hostess found her voice. \u201cIs\u2014Is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cViannafair, the Blade of Moon and Tides?\u201d Elaine suggested.\n\nLinda Breakgale nodded.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Elaine flipped the sword once to take a good look and both sides before leaning it against the wall. \u201cDo you take a lot of hints from nine-year-olds?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at this!\u201d Cass interrupted without acknowledging her mother\u2019s sardonic question. \u201cWhat even is this?\u201d\n\nA pearl white robe of shimmering starlight was crumpled into a ball in Cass\u2019s hands.\n\n\u201cThe Robe of Everlasting Starlight?\u201d Linda Breakgale asked.\n\n\u201cYeah, nobody in my family wears robes. Our basement if filled with stuff like this!\u201d\n\n\u201cO-oh\u2026\u201d\n\nOnce she\u2019d had enough fun watched Mrs. Breakgale emotionally melt into the floor, Elaine explained. \u201cYeah, we wanted her to want a normal job, so we hadn\u2019t told her what Mommy and Daddy did for work before we had her.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re?\u201d The camera started, speaking for the first time.\n\n\u201cElaina Mass, of Yoviron\u2019s Legacy,\u201d Elaine finished, \u201cand my daughter  is in so much trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet them to throw this out,\u201d Cass said, before throwing a petrified dragon\u2019s fang at Linda Breakgale\u2019s feet at the top of the stairs."

        "writing_prompt": "You have broken the strangest rule that your parents made, but instead of getting mad they give you a wand, a spell book for children, and a sword.  The last thing you heard from them for a while was \u201cwell, I warned you\u201d.",
        "story": "My father had always been the kind of man who patted you on the back instead of saying I love you. The kind of man who'd said 'interesting' when he'd accidentally put a screwdriver through his hand. The kind of man that, on their wedding day, told my mother she 'looked very nice.'\n\nHe saw me walk into the room and screamed. \"GOD FUCKING DAMMIT!\"\n\nI stopped in the doorway as he threw his copy of automotive magazine across the room and slapped his hands down on the couch cushions. After a second, he pinched his nose and I heard him swear over and over and over.\n\nI'd come to the living room to apologize for breaking his 'house rule', but this was not the reaction I'd expected.\n\nMy mom was the polar opposite of my father, they'd been attracted like magnets. She was the kind of woman who texted hearts 37 times an afternoon. The kind of woman who said nothing on her wedding day because she was busy blubbering. The kind of woman who...\n\nActually her pain tolerance was shockingly like my father's. Fancy that. Though she'd still cried when she found out swans could be gay, so the point still stood.\n\nMy mother rushed into the room skidding along the hardwood in a panic, asking what was wrong. Then she saw me in the opposite doorway. She stopped. Went silent. Then pale.\n\nDad was inconsolable. Mom needed no consoling.\n\n\"What's going on?\" I asked. Neither parent answered but I knew what they were going to say anyway so I spoke up for myself. \"I know you guys didn't want me to do this, but it's just for the concert and I really made sure I cleaned the shower and--\"\n\n\"She's your daughter,\" my Dad finally said.\n\n\"I think this comes from you,\" Mom spat.\n\n\"The fuck?\" I asked.\n\n\"You knew the rules young lady,\" Mom said. Since when did she take charge in discipline? \"And look what you did anyway.\"\n\n\"I dyed my hair red Mom, I can have it out in like a week if it's that big a problem.\"\n\n\"Fire truck red and she thinks she can just undo this,\" Dad sighed.\n\n\"I physically can, like right now but it'd fuck up my hair.\" Then, after a second, I turned to him, \"What the hell is going on? I came out to you like a month ago and and you just asked me if I still wanted to watch the baseball.\" I walked into the room. Dad still hadn't looked up. \"Now it's this?\"\n\n\"We didn't have a house rule against you liking girls,\" my Mom said. \"Why would we?\"\n\n\"Woulda made more sense then this stupid rule about dying hair/ Would you prefer I'd gotten a tattoo?\"\n\n\"Clearly!\" My Dad raised his voice. I jumped. Still wasn't used to that.\n\n\"Pause. Family meeting.\" I said. \"Can I grab the Talking Penguin?\" The Talking Penguin was a little statute we'd kept in the front hallway. If you were holding it, it was your turn to speak. It'd gotten us through ages 12-14.\n\nMy mom took a second, not because it looked like she needed one, but almost just because she was used to it. \"I can explain, you don't need the penguin. Herold can you grab her kit?\"\n\n\"My poor little girl,\" my Dad sighed. I raised an eyebrow as he pushed past me toward their bedroom.\n\n\"What's going on Mom?\"\n\nMy mother sighed, still eerily calm on the Janet scale. She took my Dad's place on the couch and patted for me to sit down. \"How do I explain this?\"\n\nI almost had snark for that, but I bit it down.\n\n\"Honey, we have a genetic condition in the family. It's called Main Character Syndrome. It used to be useful, but now it's just... well it's just asking for bad things to happen.\"\n\n\"Like we're shitty and self centered?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, like this.\" My dad was back in the room, dour again, and carrying a sword that I could have used as a snowboard. \"You're going to need this honey.\"\n\n\"What the hell?\" I asked. I turned to Mom, she was nodding sagely.\n\n\"You have an odd hair colour now honey, you're the main character. We're just waiting for the quest now.\"\n\n\"What quest?\" I asked.\n\n\"We don't know, but you're a teenager so it will probably start with me and your mother getting killed by someone,\" my Dad sighed. \"I knew what I was getting into when I married into this family. Love you both.\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked.\n\n\"How many stories do you read where the parents are in the picture?\" Mom asked. \"We raised you as a reader.\"\n\n\"I'm not just letting you die!\" I yelled back.\n\n\"Shouldn't have dyed your hair red,\" my Dad answered, like that made any sense, before throwing me the sword.\n\n\n\n\\n\\n\"You're. Not. Killing. My. DAD!\" I screamed in time with each strike, it helped me get more umph if I channeled emotion into my slashes. That was one of the many things I'd found out over the past days, and all of them had been useful. The mysterious stranger that'd approached the house fell backward, mostly because he was in pieces. I spat on the body and took a moment to catch my breath. Once I had air back in my lungs, I wiped some of the viscera off my face with the back of my hand. I was getting way too used to being covered in blood. Never thought that would be a habit.\n\nI prodded the man's divided arm with my toes. Still. Limp. Warm. Finally seemed like he was staying down.\n\nI spun the sword my Dad'd thrown me in the living room earlier this week. Mom'd told me to give her a name so I'd called her Olivia Rodrigo. Mom told me I needed a less copyrighted name so we dropped the Olivia. There were so many rules to being the main character. A million little things that were supposed to help me on my quest. Things to make me stronger. Things that made no sense in a world with Facebook and Snapchat, but Mom'd explained that the Main Character Syndrome came from a time when swords were normal so....\n\nThat had been most of my past week. I killed things. Mom explained things. I rolled my eyes. Rinse. Repeat. Stain the shower with red hair dye.\n\nI pulled out my phone, and texted my Mom, telling her that we were all clear outside but just when her three dots popped up I heard a squelch behind me.\n\n\"Oh my god, Bruh. Give up already!\" I sighed as I pulled Olivia Rodrigo out of the lawn. \"Just take the L.\"\n\nThe man that had stood up several times despite dismemberment was staggering back to his feet as he reassembled himself. The first time he'd walked up, he'd explained that he was going to kill my parents so that I could start my quest. The next four times, I hadn't given him time for an explanation before beginning operation limb removal. I took half a step back and shook some of the blood off my shoes.\n\n\"Why do you resist your quest?\" the man asked, his voice was rasping and broken, probably because he was still stitching his lungs back together.\n\n\"I don't know. Maybe because you're trying to kill my parents?\"\n\n\"Fate will not be denied.\"\n\n\"Fate can suck my dick,\" I snapped. I lunged with Rodrigo, cutting through the air. I'd gotten fast in the past days, but the man managed to side step my blade as he twisted his spine back into place.\n\n\"You cannot continue to deny it.\"\n\n\"Dude, you're the one who keeps having to rebuild yourself,\" I pointed out, \"I'm crushing this 'denying fate' thing.\"\n\n\"You know not the forces with which you meddle.\"\n\n\"YoU kNow NOt tHe ForCES wiTh WhIch YOu MeDDle,\" I mocked.\n\nThen a sound behind me. The door opening. Mom.\n\n\"I thought you said you were done.\"\n\n\"I thought I was.\" I protested. The man went to make a move and I kept my sword pointed at him.\n\n\"Did you crush his head last time?\"\n\n\"Ew. No?\"\n\n\"You have to do that or he keeps coming back,\" my Mom explained. I checked over my shoulder. The man kept trying to find a way around the sword to get to my Mom.\n\n\"Gross.\"\n\n\"Hailey. You'll be late for dinner. Dad will clean up.\"\n\n\"Fine.\" I slashed without giving the man a verbal warning this time and I caught his throat, then turned my Rodrigo to the broad side and held it up over my head. \"In my slay era I guess.\"\n\nThe splatter looked more like watermelon than I was comfortable with. Watermelon with skull in it at least.\n\n"

        "story": "\u201cAnd in that moment, right when the Dark Lord was gloating about the weakness in heroes hearts, I charged up from behind him and cracked his head in with my war hammer! Crumpled like a cloak.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne and done?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne and done!\u201d Thorin confirmed.\n\n\u201cHA! Classic boy!\u201d One of the older heroes slapped his knee as he said it and the table broke out into cheers. The tavern had already been rancorous, and it wasn\u2019t every night someone came back from saving another world.\n\n\u201cGood Ol\u2019 fashioned hubris,\u201d Thorin held up his stein, \u201cTo HUBRIS! May our enemies have it!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we only have what we deserve!\u201d The barkeep called from across the room.\n\n\u201cAye! And get my friends another round! All this gold from that world is weighing me down!\u201d Thorin pushed out from the table and patted the old-hand he\u2019d been talking to on the back. He had a lot of people to visit tonight. It\u2019d been a while since he\u2019d been back at The Valhalla.\n\nThorin approached the bar, and the Barkeep turned their attention away from their conversation and toward the man ordering the next round of drinks. \u201cLookin\u2019 for something cheap, I assume.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething hard if you have enough, but don\u2019t leave me beggin\u2019 on the street.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can sleep under one of the tables instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know my favorite place to wake up in the morning?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou talk in your sleep Thorin, I\u2019ll save a pillow for you under table three.\u201d The bartender added, before walking away to prepare the drinks. Once he was out of sight, or at least not staring at Thorin, the hero softened for a moment.\n\nComing back to the Valhalla was always a joy, but a bittersweet one. These heroes all went out into other worlds, getting summoned across space and time to stop calamity after calamity. It was the greatest profession someone could ask for, but Thorin couldn\u2019t help but miss parts of the world he went to save.\n\nHe\u2019d lived there for years, after all.\n\nThe bartender served Thorin first, exchanging another set of jabs before beginning to distribute the round. The cheers of free drinks added to the cacophony, snuggling in with bard songs, tall tales and gambling debts. Thorin considered the drink. There had been one back in Halensya, they called it Dragonglass. It\u2019d burned in such an interesting way. He\u2019d need to figure out the recipe, if it was something they could make in The Valhalla.\n\n\u201cI know that expression,\u201d a woman said as she leaned backward against the bar to join Thorin. \u201cFeelin\u2019 homesick for a place you\u2019re not from?\u201d\n\n\u201cHappens a bit every time, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo every one of us,\u201d she nodded along with what he\u2019d said. Kalena was an old hand in The Valhalla, a talented sorceress who\u2019d saved more realms than Thorin\u2019d seen. She always strode around the bar like a mobile rainbow, covered in colourful trinkets and fashions from the lands she\u2019d rescued from darkness. \u201cGot a question about your story if you\u2019ll lend an ear.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got two for a reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank ya kindly,\u201d-Kalena accepted her drink from the passing barkeep- \u201cIn your story, you mentioned a maiden. What happened to her?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Aerenae?\u201d Thorin suggested.\n\n\u201cYour story, not mine. Don\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know the name.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, Aerenae.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened with her? You talked about her at the start and then never told us how it wrapped up.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh,\u201d Thorin grunted. He took a drink of the near-toxic swill he\u2019d ordered for the bar instead of giving a proper answer.\n\n\u201cWell, consider my curiosity satiated.\u201d Kalena rolled her eyes as she said it. \u201cDon\u2019t wanna give the gory details. I get it. Just thought she was critical.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said no.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. Certainly not in the bar, but in this conversation.\n\n\u201cPardon?\u201d was how Kalena broke it.\n\n\u201cShe said no.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo a night with you?\u201d she clarified. \u201cAh, well. Happens to the best of us. Can\u2019t find the best fling on every plane an--\u201c\n\n\u201cI asked her back to The Valhalla with me.\u201d\n\nAnother pause in the conversation. This time it was Kalena waiting until the bar was loud enough to cover their voices again. \u201cYou asked her back?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she said no.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said no,\u201d Thorin reiterated. \u201cDidn\u2019t wanna leave her kingdom. Told me she couldn\u2019t. Not after everything that happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you tell her we save kingdoms all the time? Worlds even?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe knew where I was from, Kalena,\u201d Thorin sighed, \u201cand she said no. Now if you don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m trying to have fun drinking about everythin\u2019 else so I don\u2019t ruin a lifetime thinking about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThorin.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said no, that was the end of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d Kalena broke her casual backward lean against the bar, turning to match Thorin\u2019s hunched posture. Her multicolour bangles jingled as she fell into the conversation again. \u201cBut you\u2019re asking a girl back to the Valhalla. I\u2019m just wondering\u2026\u201c\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna tell her everything she told me. She had her reasons and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThorin, what the fuck are you doing here?\u201d Kalena cut him off. It wasn\u2019t like he was making the right argument. \u201cYou offered this Aerenae your one invite, and when she said no, you just left?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was I supposed to do? World was saved. She said no.\u201d\n\n\u201cStay. You stay there, you dumbass. Send back your medallion and we\u2019ll find another hero. Gods.\u201d\n\nThorin shot up. What the hell was he doing back here? He\u2019d saved a hundred worlds and nobody had ever tempted his invitation out of him. Now he was just going to... \u201cI need to talk to Odin.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you do,\u201d Kalena rolled her eyes as Thorin pushed off from the bar and sprinted toward the door. The bar fell silent as he ran.\n\nThen. Once the door was closed, the Old Hand Thorin\u2019d expounded his adventures to spoke up. \u201cHe going after that Aerenae girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cYessir!\u201d Kalena confirmed, \u201cHe\u2019s going back!\u201d\n\n\u201cGOOD MAN!\u201d\n\nThe bar broke into cheers. Another hero found their deserved fate, and this one had been obvious to anyone who\u2019d heard Thorin\u2019s story."

But it's filled with rather strange rules. What does: \"There's only ever one of each mascot inside the park. Check for eyeholes.\" even mean?",
        "story": "The computer room to the left had one piece of furniture in front of massive screens, a brown plastic chair bolted into the ground by a plate on each leg. It was a cold place, even for the cold building. It wasn't anything like she'd pictured when Cali'd signed up to work in Joyland, but then again these were all the backrooms and you couldn't find information about the employee experience online, only people bragging about how they'd been able to come for a vacation.\n\nBefore Cali had even sat down the screen sparked to life, light blue text on a dark blue background.\n\n[Please take a seat]\n\nA second after the text was on the screen, a manufactured voice repeated the request. Cali paused for a second at that. The voice was so...blatantly inhuman, like the robotic and stilted text-to-speech algorithms you saw in museums covering the turn of the century. The voice repeated. Cali complied.\n\n\"Thank you for joining us and welcome to the Joyland Team [Abbigail!]. In just a moment, I will be walking you through employee registration, but first [Abbigail] I have some questions for you.\"\n\nCali looked around the room with each instance of [Abbigail] not only was it clearly in a different voice than the rest of the speech and also not her name, but there wasn't anyone else it could have been referencing. As far as Cali could tell, she and Queen were the only ones who'd come in here within the past few minutes.\n\n\"Please confirm your preferred gender presentation [Abbigail].\"\n\nThe screen gave two options, which was a strange sight. Cali clicked female. At least one of the options had been hers.\n\n\"I am now going to preform an eye scan. Please stay still.\"\n\nCali waited for a moment, nothing seemed to happen but then the machine chimed like it was done.\n\n\"Just a moment. Processing.\"\n\nCali took another look around the room, trying to see if there was an ID badge or anything that the machine could have been scanning to get Abbigail from nowhere. Then again, she didn't have an ID badge yet, so it would have been strange for the machine to require one.\n\n\"It looks like you're wearing glasses. Please remove them and deposit them into the bin. They will be returned once you have finished orientation.\"\n\nPardon? Cali removed her glasses without thinking but didn't give them away. She wasn't one of those people who could get along without them. She needed them.\n\n\"Glasses cannot be worn in front of guests. Some stages of orientation will take place in front of guests. Please deposit your glasses into the provided bin.\"\n\nA small drawer popped out of the wall. Cali still didn't comply, but at least she spoke up. \"I need these to see. I can't do orientation without them.\"\n\nQuiet. Then the drawer retreated.\n\n\"You have been registered for class 2 visual adjustment surgery. This will be covered in full by your Joyland insurance. You may continue to wear your glasses for the time being, but you cannot wear them within the guest facing areas of the park. Your surgery is to take place on May 27th.\"\n\nCali sat up. Surgery? What the hell? How expensive did that have to be?\n\n\"Now [Abbigail], is there something you would prefer to be called?\"\n\n\"My name is Cali.\" Finally.\n\n\"Cali is not in the registered database of authorized names within Joyland. Please choose another.\"\n\nCali blinked twice and finally put her glasses back on. There was a list on the screen now. Dozens of feminine names, most of which were too old to have a population these days, or at least a population without nicknames. Blessedly. Caroline was an option.\n\n\"Thank you for making your selection [Caroline]. Your employee profile has been adjusted. Printing ID card.\"\n\nThe same drawer that had tried to take Cali's glasses popped out of the wall again, this time with a single laminated card in the center. The name was right, but the picture was wrong. A dark haired mousey girl was staring back at Cali. Just when she was about to speak up, the screen shut off, leaving the cold room dim.\n\nCali grabbed the ID card from the drawer, and three of the floor tiles partially lit, creating an arrow telling her to go down the hall. She'd have to talk to someone about the ID card. Maybe Queen? Then again, Queen didn't really strike her as the HR type.\n\n\\n\\nWhen Queen had said she might see her later, Cali hadn't expected her that to be almost right away, that just wasn't the way the language worked. That said, it didn't look like Queen had expected her either.\n\nThat and it barely looked like Queen. Somehow within the last twenty minutes Queen had gone from barely morning put together to a prim and proper Joyland employee. Her color scheme had gone from black to emerald, her lips had gone from plain to ruby and if that wasn't a wig, Cali had to ask how Queen did it because she was clearly a wizard. There was also something else different about her, but Cali couldn't put her finger on it.\n\nCali made all of those observations from the door and Queen had been starting at the same time, looking just as confused even though Cali looked, by all accounts, exactly the same. \"They let you keep your glasses?\" She asked after too much time had passed.\n\n\"I'm signed up for surgery about them.\"\n\n\"Well, lucky you. That should be covered,\" Queen half motioned to her eyes as she spoke, the blue glow behind them had dulled and faded into the normal hazel of her eyes, \"but you won't have any implants. They don't like the look of them. They'll keep it to corrective.\"\n\n\"That's still more than I thought I'd get,\" Cali said. Now that she was done getting shell shocked by Queen's transformation, she looked around the room. Whomever had designed this place had somehow wrangled a perfect mix between dressing room and corporate office.\n\n\"You're here faster than I thought,\" Queen commented. She was looking through the top drawers of her desk now and Cali cocked her head at the search. This place had so many drawers, where were the tablets and displays that kept track of everything for you? \"Didn't have many questions for the machine?\"\n\n\"It kept calling me Abbigail.\"\n\nQueen tsked at the name and approached once she had pulled a small penlight from the drawer. \"Miss her.\"\n\n\"Abbigail?\"\n\n\"Yep.\" Queen shone the pen-light in Cali's eye, and she flinched. Once she'd flinched away the first time, Queen used her free hand to catch Cali's chin and hold her in place. \"Did you give it a new name?\"\n\n\"Caroline was an option.\"\n\n\"Lucky again.\" Queen shone the light in the other eye and Cali tried to keep it open. \"Carta wasn't. Parkside I'm Quinn.\"\n\n\"Quinn? Not Queen.\"\n\n\"Queen isn't a traditional name Cali.\" The girl pause, holding the pen-light in her teeth for a moment and using her hands to pulled Cali's hair back. On the way in, Queen must have had horrid posture because she had several inches on Cali now. \"They had Quinn, which was close enough. I used Cass for a while but once people started calling me Queenie I switched it.\"\n\n\"Do people change their names a lot here?\" Cali struggled to speak as Quinn swapped a hand back to her cheek now that she had Cali's hair in one hand.\n\n\"Often enough, but you see 'em everyday so it won't be an issue.\" Queen ran the penlight along each line of Cali's face and eventually frowned. \"You're not wearing a faceplate.\"\n\n\"No,\" Cali said, \"I could never afford one. Do I need one?\"\n\n\"Your skin should be fine as is, it's pretty clear. Acid wash should cover it.\" As Queen spoke Cali realized what was so 'different' about the girl in this room. On the walk in, the lines of Queen's faceplate had been clearly visible, they were covered now, synthetic skin smoothing out the hard lines. \"Do you have any replacement parts that will show in the uniform?\"\n\n\"I don't think I do.\" Cali tried to get another look at the Uniform up close, assuming Queen was wearing it. She'd only seen it online before. \"Just a couple cuts from a hospital visit when I was younger.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\nCali didn't answer. Silence waited for Queen to press or let it go.\n\n\"Long as the cuts are in the midsection you should be fine. It'll make your mornign routine earlier. I have to cover up a whole aug phase when I prep.\"\n\nCali still took a little too long to respond. \"So they aren't allowed to see your augs in the park?\"\n\n\"Joyland is the happiest place on the planet Cali. Nobody's too poor to afford proper treatment in there.\" Queen patted Cali on the cheek. Cali couldn't wrap her head around the tone Queen'd used for that, a soft of saccarine hatred. Whatever it was, Queen cooled for the next sentence. \"I'll get the requisition in for the salicylic in and we'll be good to go get you into a uniform.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"Down the hall to the right, I'll meet you there and we can get you sorted. Looking proper for your time in front of the guests.\"\n\n\n\n"

        "story": "Oshvold the Heavy had seen a lot of things, both during his time as the Guild Leader and back in his adventuring days, but he wasn\u2019t quite sure he\u2019d ever seen anyone like Helena. \n\nShe had started out like most adventurers that came through his door. Eager to prove herself and frustrated with the types of jobs he\u2019d offered at the start, but there was a method to Oshvold\u2019s madness. Saving cats was a job that showed you if someone had followthrough, goblins would show you they could handle themselves in a fight. \n\nTo the adventurers, especially those that came from other guilds, the jobs were tedious, but to Oshvold, it was all research. Critical information gathering that let him run an efficient and safe guild hall. \n\nWell, as safe as guild halls got.\n\nNo amount of information gathering had prepared him for Helena. The woman pulled a small bundle of bounties out of her bag\u2013so she was who\u2019d been stealing his copies\u2013alongside the signatures marking job completion. \n\nOshvold suppressed his surprise as he grabbed his reading glasses, replacing his shock with a gruff, \u201cGuild rules say one job at a time.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d she said as she took her midnight hair out of her ponytail and let it fall. \u201cStuff was on the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the way? Hm.\u201d Oshvold read over the sheets. It was impressive that she\u2019d taken care of the bandit tribes, considering she usually worked alone, but then he flipped over the last sheet\u2013\n\nHe was right, he\u2019d never seen anything like her. That last writ was from the palace, the bounty for the Dragon King. How had she even gotten her\u2013 \u201cWhat rank are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cGotta cash those in order,\u201d she said, \u201cI should get to journeyman from the cats, then vanguard from the Northern Bandits which would make me legal for the\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah yeah,\u201d Oshvold waved a dismissive hand. \u201cYou know that the point of the limits ain\u2019t the logistics of it. It\u2019s to keep kids like you safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Helena said. \u201cIn that case the order doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nOshvold rolled his eyes. He was used to this sort of behavior from Wizards and other egg-heads who tried to game any system they got their ink splotched hands on. From what he understood, Helena couldn\u2019t tell ass from teakettle when it came to magic. \u201cWhat was your party for the Dragon King job?\u201d\n\n\u201cRowley.\u201d  \n\u201cRowley?\u201d Oshvold asked, it was just the first name and that didn\u2019t make any sense. Helena might have been confused about magic, but Rowley was confused about everything. \u201cYou brought Rowley with\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no. He just pointed me toward the right way at Jaggard\u2019s Crossing when I\u2019d lost my map so\u2026He helped. That puts him in my party right?\u201d\n\nOshvold looked down at the sheet. She was seriously saying she went alone and\u2013Well the King of Tarvineium had only signed her name on the bounty sheet. Did everyone else possibly die? \u201cDeceased?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Dragon King,\u201d Helena said with the stalwart tone that showed she didn\u2019t know she was answering the wrong question. \u201cOn the Dragon King quest. If we\u2019re talking the other quests there was a nest of hornets in one and then about 14 bandits.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwelve through fourteen might have made it. I wasn\u2019t sticking around to check. I had places to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did you have\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Dragon\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, the Dragon King,\u201d Oshvold nodded along as he caught onto the answer to his question. \u201cLook. Helena.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did good work here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you\\!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut.\u201d Oshvold slammed the pile of papers in front of her to draw her attention and set the scale for his next words. \u201cThe rails are there to keep you safe, Helena. You can\u2019t just go ignoring the order and embarking on high level missions alone.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll bring someone next time then.\u201d She offered a weak thumbs up. If it wasn\u2019t for professionalism Oshvold would have sworn, instead he just massaged his temples. \n\n\u201cJust one more question before payout,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy in the patheon did you feel like you had to do this?\u201d he asked. \n\n\u201cOh\\! That\u2019s easy. I was speaking to Sarif, the mage, and I asked if she\u2019d let me take her out to dinner. She didn\u2019t seem that interested.\u201d\n\nOshvold nodded. That sounded like Sarif. \n\n\u201cBut then I asked if I could change her mind, and she said I just needed to kill the Dragon King.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I did,\u201d Helena shook her head to fluff her freshly released hair, her armor clattering as she did. \u201cNow I just need to find her this evening to let her know I did it and that we can go on that date.\u201d\n\nOshvold was a professional at keeping his mouth shut, it was almost half his job, dealing with egotistical adventurers. That said, he couldn\u2019t keep the next words to himself. \u201cOh you poor girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me,\u201d Oshvold said to the blood soaked adventurer. \u201cYou defeated the Dragon King, wiped out the Northern Bandit Tribes, and rescued six cats from trees all because you wanted to impress Sarif?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Helena,\u201d he said, reaching across the table and grabbing her hands. \u201cSarif didn\u2019t really want you to kill the Dragon King.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why\u2019d she say it?\u201d \n\n\u201cShe said it instead of no,\u201d Oshvold explained. \u201cTo someone like you, killing the Dragon King is supposed to be impossible. Like the Infernum freezing over, or Illsmoth blinking every eye at once.\u201d\n\nHelena stared at Oshvold for a moment. \u201cSo she meant to say no?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why didn\u2019t she just say that?\u201d\n\nThere was a lot of things Oshvold could say to that. There was the fact that most people would understand what she meant. The fact that most people would get killed trying if they didn\u2019t understand Sarif\u2019s meaning. The fact that Sarif, above all, was a bastard. \n\nInstead he said none of them and only offered a small smile. \u201cNo idea Helena. Would you like your payment in Gold or Platinum?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\\!\u201d she seemed to forget her mild heartbreak at the mention of money. \u201cPlatinum please.\u201d\n\nOshvold turned away from the bar to find a safe and chuckled to himself once he was out of earshot. He was sure that he\u2019d never met anyone like Helena, but he was starting to wondering where he could find more of them."
