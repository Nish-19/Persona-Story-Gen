You can't \u2014 you *won't* allow him to take what you have built and run it into the ground for the sake of his endless ambition.",
        "story": "How do the stars know about mortal affairs? They\u2019re far too disconnected from our planet to even comprehend humanity, let alone understand our vast and often perplexing rights of becoming a king. Yet, he tells me that the stars say it\u2019s his turn to lead? To think he was even gaining support with such an absurd claim. What would my late mother think? She didn\u2019t go through the hell of bringing me into this world, only for some stars to steal my rightful spot as king. No, this ends tonight.\n\n \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a silly notion, really. A man chosen by the stars. What, is he a god? Does he intend to wow us with a miracle?\u201d I asked, sipping from my glass of wine. The formal dinner had been going as planned, with nobles mingling amongst themselves, each noble using this as an opportunity to appraise myself and this Starman. Working out who they wished to bend a knee to later. Nobles were loyal until opportunity arose. These men and women had sent their children to war for me, and now they were ready to turn to another side just because the coin might be a droplet better.\n\n \n\n\u201cIt is a silly notion, my lord. Although, it has gotten some popularity. I assume that\u2019s why you called this dinner and invited them here? To stamp your authority on this kingdom.\u201d Madam Dina said, the captain of my guards sticking by my side during all of this. In another life, I may have even asked her to be my queen. No woman had ever shown me so much love in my life. If not for our difference in class, I would have begged to have her by my side.\n\n \n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m hoping I can talk him out of this. If not, then I\u2019ll have to do what\u2019s right for the kingdom.\u201d\n\n \n\nMadam Dina thought about those words before nodding. \u201cUnderstood, my lord.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cDina. Do you think I\u2019ve been a just ruler?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cOf course, sir.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cNo. No, of course, sir. I want the truth.\u201d\n\n \n\nShe thought again, this time taking a lot longer to find her words. \u201cSir, you\u2019ve had a hard kingship. We\u2019ve had wars, famines and strife. All things you inherited from your parents. You\u2019ve made tough choices and killed people in the process. But we are safe now. Everything you did has led us to a better place. The people, however, still hold resentment towards those hard times. Which is why some Starman can grip their minds. They want to believe peace can exist without sacrifice.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan it?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve yet to see a kingdom manage that, sir. If there was such a king that could do it, I believe they truly would be chosen by the stars. You\u2019re a good man, despite what you may believe.\u201d She rested her leather glove against my hand. Not holding my hand, but allowing it to rest by it, touching my hand without holding it. I wanted to grip her hand, wanted to throw this stupidness aside. Yet, if the nobles saw me loving someone below me, they would jump to that Starman in seconds. A king\u2019s image was everything.\n\n \n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d I said, turning to the crowd. Pathetic, all of them. These drunkards were the backbone of our kingdom, the funnels that dripped gold into our war efforts and protection. If anything needed to be replaced, it was them. We had only started this party an hour ago and already they were tripping over one another, blowing wine scented breath into each other\u2019s noses as they bragged about whatever fortune they inherited this week. Disgusting, really.\n\n \n\nI downed the last of my wine, circling around the party, trying to avoid the nobles for now. I needed to find this Starman, the one who caused this mess to begin with. When I found him, he was on the balcony, stargazing. I moved to his side, expecting him to address his king. When he didn\u2019t address me, I joined him in looking at the stars, that finally causing him to speak.\n\n \n\n\u201cLovely night, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He said.\n\n \n\n\u201cIt is.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cHm,\u201d was all he responded with, blue eyes peering at the sky. There he was, the baby-faced man who had caused this mess. Clean shaven, eyes full of life, with fluffy brown hair. That mixed with the bright pink shirt he wore and his black pants had him standing out among the crowd of cherry-cheeked drunks.\n\n \n\nWe stood in silence, and I gazed at his stars. I saw no message hidden within them. Nothing that said I needed to be removed from the throne. If anything, the stars shone as brightly for me as they did for him. Then he turned to me, giving me a smile. \u201cYou want to throw me off this balcony, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n \n\nMy honesty caught him off-guard, that smile fading as he leaned into the railing, sighing. \u201cYou\u2019re a very blunt person. No wonder people think you\u2019re cruel. I can\u2019t blame you for wanting that. I have caused a stir over the last few weeks. The fact that you\u2019ve even allowed me into the castle is a sign that you aren\u2019t as wicked as people believe. You could have thrown me into a dungeon and done unspeakable things, and yet you didn\u2019t. Why is that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want my kingdom to be stained with more blood than it has to be. Every battle I\u2019ve fought was for their sake. Which is why I won\u2019t let you ruin everything. We have peace, we don\u2019t need a new king, we need stability.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cAgreed.\u201d\n\n \n\nThat wasn\u2019t what I expected to hear. He agreed with me? Didn\u2019t that go against everything he wanted? How could a potential leader agree with a king? \u201cI don\u2019t think I follow.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be king. I want to be a leader. Allow me to help you shape the future of your kingdom. You\u2019ve secured our peace. Now let\u2019s reform old policies and make the future fruitful. I don\u2019t want to overtake you, nor do I want your fame. I want to make things better, and I can do that by leading behind you. I\u2019ll be that hand on your shoulder, the one helping to move us forward.\u201d\n\n \n\nI considered his offer, leaning against the railing, inspecting the man. Everything about him seemed genuine. No hint of malice or a knife under his shirt, just someone who had ambition. A bit like me all those years ago. Maybe he was na\u00efve, but maybe we needed a certain bit of naivety. Someone who still thought things could change without bloodshed.\n\n \n\n\u201cAlright, leader. What would be your first point of order?\u201d I asked, testing what he could come up with.\n\n \n\n\u201cI would say you should marry your lovely knight. If you love her, marry her. She\u2019s always been by your side, has she not? Who cares about class?\u201d He winked before shaking his head. \u201cAh, that\u2019s not an order I can give. Let\u2019s focus on something simpler. How about lowering taxes? We shouldn\u2019t have any threat of war for at least twenty years. We can afford to lighten their taxes.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do that. If the people respond favorably, as I expect them to do. Then, I\u2019ll appoint you as my advisor. Though, know this. If you ever come for the throne, I will remove you.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a deal.\u201d\n\n \n\nThe next five years were prosperous for the kingdom. This Starman, bringing positive change to the kingdom, implementing everything from small to big changes. He knew every minor faction of the city, the ones that I often overlooked, and with this knowledge, he could bring their issues to me. Starman, I still struggle to call him by his real name. Maybe I\u2019m not immune to the glamour of such a title.\n\nStill, the biggest change he brought was the ring on my finger. A marriage that I didn\u2019t think would ever be possible. My knight, now being my lovely wife. Something that was worth all the gold in our kingdom. And while he doesn\u2019t seek fame or glory, I\u2019m still going to place him in our history books, for the future generations deserve to know of our shining star.\n\n"

        "writing_prompt": "\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me,\u201d the Guild Leader said to the blood soaked adventurer. \u201cYou defeated the Dragon King, wiped out the Northern Bandit Tribes, and rescued six cats from trees all because you wanted to impress a girl?\u201d",
        "story": "\u201cYou\u2019ve got it all wrong.\u201d Reiner said, using the guild\u2019s counter to clean his bloodied sword. The adventurer dragging the crimson iron along it, causing the blood to pool into cuts on the wood, leaving a permanent reminder of his visit.\n\n \n\nThe guild leader could only sigh, knowing better than to scold his best adventurer. The money he got from Reiner\u2019s antics was enough to cover any furniture he ruined with his lack of grace. \u201cGood, I would hate to think you would go through all this effort just to impress some lady. Especially when the guild has so many fine ladies already,\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Reiner hissed, stabbing his sword into the counter, meeting guild leader Jake\u2019s gaze. \u201cI didn\u2019t do all of this just to impress \u2018some\u2019 lady. I did it to impress the lady. The one of my dreams. The one that I\u2019ll create a new life with. Would you like to hear how I plan to create this new life? First, I will take off my,\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cNO, NO, NO, SHUT UP.\u201d Jake screamed, covering his ears. \u201cI know exactly how life\u2019s made. I have three children of my own.\u201d Jake could hardly believe this was the best their guild had. Actually, this was the best their entire region had to offer. Someone that other guilds often tried to poach. Most guilds were happy to put up with his strangeness if it meant having a weapon like him on their side.\n\n \n\nJake gave Reiner a look over. Here he was, standing caked in blood. The only color visible on his skin that wasn\u2019t red was the gold chain that dangled off his toned chest. Even his black hair had lost its color, mixed with the blood of his enemies, leaving only his eyes as the remaining visible color. A set of kind blue eyes that looked out of place on someone like him.\n\n \n\n \n\nReiner shifted a little until the guild leader\u2019s gaze, only to pull his sword out of the counter, tapping it against the wood instead. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you had three kids. Why haven\u2019t I ever met them?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious? You\u2019re always covered in blood.\u201d\n\n \n\nReiner looked at his blood covered form, and then back to Jake. \u201cSo?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll scare them more than any monster will.\u201d Jake struggled to lift the massive bag of gold onto the counter, watching it dent the already worn table. \u201cThat\u2019s your pay. Please take it and have a bath.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cA bath? And lose my natural scent? I need to be smelling as bloodied as possible or my love won\u2019t notice me. Don\u2019t you know the first thing about romance? How did you start a family if you didn\u2019t approach a woman while covered in blood?\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Jake knew it was impossible to talk sense to Reiner. Whatever world he lived in was not one that followed their social norms. \u201cGuess my wife preferred someone cleaner?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cHm.\u201d was all Reiner said, as if he didn\u2019t approve of Jake\u2019s wife's choice.\n\n \n\nBefore the conversation could get any stranger, a crashing sound came from outside, followed by the howling screams of the civilians. Everyone in the guild gripped their weapons, instinctively moving to their feet. Though, when they peeked through the windows of the guild, some sat back down.\n\n \n\n\u201cBRIOVILLA.\u201d One screamed.\n\n \n\n\u201cTHE QUEEN OF THE DAMNED.\u201d Another shouted.\n\n \n\nJake cursed, finding his blade. He wasn\u2019t as strong as he had been in his youth, but he wasn\u2019t about to let the queen of the damned kill his precious guild. \u201cEveryone stay inside. I\u2019ll go out and talk to her.\u201d\n\n \n\nBefore Jake could round the corner, Reiner placed a hand on his chest. \u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d The stony stare from the bloodied warrior made Jake\u2019s muscles relax, feeling like he could trust him to take on the world. Jake gave a nod, and went to secure the windows, getting his guild ready for the worst.\n\n \n\nReiner stepped outside, approaching the decay covered queen. Briovilla was a thin woman, one whose grey skin was covered in dark oily patches. The patches bubbling with her every breath, as if they were about to burst. She rolled her shoulders as she approached, pure white eyes observing the warrior that stood before her.\n\n \n\n\u201cYou killed my creations. Every single one of them. Do you understand how that makes me feel?\u201d The grass beneath her feet browned. The decay spreading towards Reiner, only to stop before it reached him, giving him a chance to retort. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I turn you into my next monster? You can replace the Dragon King you killed.\u201d\n\n \n\nReiner stepped onto the decayed grass, the skin on his legs peeling as he did. The actions causing the queen to pause, never having witnessed a human willingly step into her decay. \u201cBecause I love you. This was the only way to get you to notice me.\u201d He kneeled on the grass, the decay taking him faster.\n\nBefore the decay reached his neck, it stopped, returning his skin to its normal healthy blood covered tone. \u201cYou\u2019re willing to die for a chance to confess your love to me? How odd? And you find me appealing?\u201d She questioned, approaching his kneeled form, offering him her hand. \n\n \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the strongest woman I\u2019ve ever met. That is a beauty that no one else can manage. I wish to spend the rest of my life by your side.\u201d \n\n \n\nThe queen considered the proposal, having to admit, she found his blood-soaked form enchanting. \u201cVery well. I see no reason to not give you a chance. We will be leaving for our date. If it goes well, I\u2019ll make you mine. If it doesn\u2019t. I\u2019ll turn you into my pawn. So, you\u2019ll be forever by my side, regardless.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted. My father married the strongest woman he could find, and I will do the same.\u201d He accepted her hand and pulled himself back to his feet. Going to the guild, he forced open the door, causing everyone inside to jump from the sudden impact. \u201cI\u2019m leaving, most likely forever.\u201d He pointed at the bag of gold before giving Jake a grin. \u201cKeep that. It\u2019s your pay for putting up with me. I wish you a happy life, guild master.\u201d With that, he took the hand of the queen and left, leaving Jake staring at the browned grass outside.\n\n"

        "story": "\u201cYou don\u2019t have dragons? Every planet has dragons, even the Wimbles have dragons and their barely passed the fire stage of their development. I just don\u2019t understand how humanity doesn\u2019t have them.\u201d Bilk said, the green alien drinking beside Liam at the Uranus Blackhole bar. A name that Liam thought was funny, and that Bilk didn\u2019t really understand.\n\n \n\nLiam sniffed his drink, remembering he had to be careful when drinking off-world. If you felt a burning sensation in your brain after three sniffs, it wasn\u2019t safe to drink. Liam gave it three sniffs and felt a burning in his throat and behind his eyes. Both rather painful, but not near his brain, which he assumed meant it was safe. Downing the purple liquid, he grimaced before turning to his alien acquaintance.\n\n \n\n\u201cWimbles, wimbles? Oh, those fluffy things. Aren\u2019t they cute? Kind of reminds me of hedgehogs. You know you can adopt them on Earth? For five dollars a month, they\u2019ll drop off some food to their world and give you updates on a wimble of your choice. I even got to name mine. I called him Sonic.\u201d\n\n \n\nBilk gave him a disgusted look, sipping his drink. \u201cYou adopted it? You can\u2019t adopt them. That isn\u2019t how evolution works. They need to develop on their own.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s not as evil as it sounds. It\u2019s just giving them a leg up, that\u2019s all. Apparently, it helps get them past the awkward stages. Like puberty? In evolution terms? I guess? Turns ten thousand years into a few thousand.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s highly unethical.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cReally? Because I\u2019m almost certain an alien race adopted us humans all those years ago. A race that made us point our monuments at the stars. Was that you guys?\u201d Liam leaned in closer, as Bilk gave him a guilty look, pretending to be very interested in a game of Zorblis that was playing on the holographic screen in front of them. Watching the two teams try to guide the ball into the other side\u2019s net without getting shot by electric powered guns. The longer he tried to ignore Liam, the more intense the stare got, until he had to answer.\n\n \n\n\u201cOk, we did that too, but can you blame us? You were pathetic. All you did was sit around eating dirt. You needed a kick up the Tongus.\u201d He said, making a very brutal kicking motion. A motion that caused him to kick the bar\u2019s counter, bending his three toes back. \u201cBarqas.\u201d He cursed.\n\n \n\n \nLiam snickered, taking in the one-eyed creature beside him. To think they were at that stage in space travel where you could have a casual conversation with an alien. Space truckers always needed to refuel for their trips, no matter their alien race, which is why places like this made for such good watering holes. Plus, it had the bonus of offering a proper bed to sleep in, one that wasn\u2019t cramped below a roaring engine or toilet.\n\n \n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying you have dragons?\u201d\n\n \n\nBilk nodded, relieved the conversation had shifted. \u201cYes, powerful ones, too. I thought every planet had them. Unless yours died off? Now that I think about it, I don\u2019t recall any existing in our logs after our first visit to Earth. Yet, you had so many stories about them. How bizarre.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cMaybe we learned the stories from your people? Don\u2019t things spread that way? One of your ancestors might have mentioned a dragon and suddenly we started telling stories about them?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d Bilk didn\u2019t want to appear disappointed, but he couldn\u2019t help feeling a little let down. People claimed these Earthlings were interesting creatures, yet their planet appeared even more mundane than his own. \u201cWhat interesting creatures do you have?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cSnakes? Crocodiles? Frogs? I don\u2019t know what you would find interesting, honestly.\u201d Liam shrugged. He didn\u2019t want to play describe the animal all night, especially when he didn\u2019t have something that could checkmate a dragon.\n\n \n\nBilk rolled his one eye, an action that made him sway in his seat, clearly not used to the action he had seen many humans do. Gripping the counter, he balanced himself. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them all before. Want to see what my dragon looks like?\u201d\n\n \n\nOh, Liam hated situations like this. Situations where someone would pull out their phone and show you how much cooler their life was, while you just sat there and nodded, having to act like you weren\u2019t jealous of them. \u201cSure.\u201d He said, not having any reason to decline it.\nBilk scrolled through photos of him at various planets before landing on one of his dragon. The black furred creature having a small, curved tail and a pair of wings. It also had two soft, pointed ears on its head and sharp claws. Liam only gave it a confused nod, before looking at Bilk.\n\n \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a cat.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cat. Well, a cat with wings. We have cats, just not ones that look like that.\u201d\n\n \n\nBilk searched up what a cat looked like on his phone and was left awfully confused. It looked identical to his dragon, except for the wings. \u201cImpossible. How come yours doesn\u2019t have wings? Do they breathe fire still and fly around? Only recently have we even been able to domesticate them.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cNo, they don\u2019t do either of those things. They scratch sometimes. I think we domesticated them a long time ago, though.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cFascinating. Does that mean our dragons will soon lose their wings?\u201d Bilk wondered if he had made a scientific discovery, wanting to rush back to his planet and tell them the news. \n\n \n\n\u201cMaybe? I can\u2019t say.\u201d The conversation fizzled out after that, Bilk too preoccupied with his thoughts to continue with any other topic. Liam enjoyed the silence before giving the alien a nod of acknowledgement as he left. \u201cDragon cats? The galaxy is such an odd place.\u201d He mumbled to himself.\n\n"

        "story": "\u201cA DEAD BODY? Someone call 911.\u201d I screamed through the empty store, wishing someone would handle this horrifying situation for me. Despite my wailing, no one came to my rescue. The store was entirely empty, leaving me to deal with the body hidden behind the counter. The body belonged to a middle-aged woman, with pale skin and some nasty-looking scars across her shoulder and neck. I hesitantly stepped closer, only to spot her employee uniform.\n\n \n\nClutching my mouth, I did my best not to be sick. There she was, a body decorated in our employee uniform, like some present for us to find. Judging by the marks, she had to have been dead for days. Did someone intentionally do this? \u201cThis is sick. What sort of person would do something so awful?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cI know, making me work the Monday shift alone is brutal.\u201d The dead woman spoke, her eyelids opening, revealing her grey pupils which were now focused on me. \u201cI\u2019m Marissa, your coworker. Nice to meet you.\u201d She extended her hand, only to pause. \u201cYou ok, you look a little\u2026. Oh, no.\u201d\n\n \n\nThe last thing I remembered was a zombie? Or did someone get murdered? The foggy memories dancing in my head as I rested. What a dream. I woke up in the employee lounge, which was really an old utility closet with a couch in it. As soon as I shifted my weight, a spring jabbed my back, throwing me to my feet. \u201cOw. I can\u2019t believe I passed out at work. I\u2019m probably going to get written up for it.\u201d\n\n \n\nAs I opened the door, I found her standing outside, giving me a smile. \u201cHey.\u201d Before I could scream, she covered my mouth, whispering. \u201cWe have customers. Calm down. I know what you\u2019re thinking. How did I get paired with the coolest and hottest lady at this place? But that\u2019s no reason to start screaming. I won\u2019t bite, promise.\u201d\n\n \n\nI relaxed, and she released her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re a zombie. How hasn\u2019t anyone else noticed it? Is it make up? Did I miss a Halloween email? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWell, this is going to be hard to believe. Do you know that old man who lives down the road from here? The one that sometimes comes in and mumbles about peaches?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cOh, yeah. We call him James. Cause of that book, James and the giant peach. What about him?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a wizard who's been bringing the dead back to life. Anyway, he died before releasing our spell, so we\u2019re all kind of stuck here now.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cThe spell doesn\u2019t release after his death?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cNah, magics a bitch like that. So, I\u2019m kind of stuck here until I die? I mean, I could be stuck here forever. It\u2019s hard to say. Pretty sure necromancy has an expiration, though. Long story short, I needed cash and your boss would hire an echidna to work here if he could pay it below minimum wage.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\n \n\u201cYeah, below minimum wage sucks. Eh, then again, I don\u2019t work that hard, so you could argue I\u2019m screwing him.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cNo, about the zombie thing. I\u2019m sorry it happened to you. I\u2019m also sorry about screaming when I saw you.\u201d\n\n \n\nShe smirked, patting my head. \u201cNonsense. It would be weird if you didn\u2019t scream. I was hoping you would think I was a goth chick or something. Look, no hard feelings, ok?\u201d She moved to the counter, and I winced, worried she was going to scare off our employees. A zombie working at a fruit market, it didn\u2019t seem like something our customers would accept.\n\n \n\nI went to stop her, but it was already too late. She was at the counter, and the customer was standing there with his watermelon and carrots. They had already locked eyes. This was it. I covered my ears, waiting for the screams, but they never came. When I saw her mouth, have a nice day, I uncovered my ears, moving to her side.\n\n \n\n\u201cWhat? Why didn\u2019t they scream? Any normal person would scream.\u201d\n\n \n\nMarissa laughed, putting the money in the register. \u201cCustomers don\u2019t really pay attention to the people working in stores. As long as they get their goods, they couldn\u2019t care less whose standing behind the register. I could pull an arm off and ask them, cash or card? And they would just mumble cash before walking off. It\u2019s kind of funny.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWow.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cI know, right? Think about it, though. Can you honestly remember the last person who served you at a register? Like, sure. Maybe if you get outstanding service, but most people forget them as soon as they leave the line.\u201d\n\n \n\nI tried to remember the last person who served me. They had been tall? No, short? Hm. The longer I thought about it, the harder it got, until I gave up. \u201cGuess that\u2019s right. So, um. I know this is a personal question, but\u2026\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cHow did I die?\u201d She raised an eyebrow.\n\n \n\n\u201cYeah, sorry.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be. I would wanna know to. I died on my way home from a concert. Drunk driver smacked into my car and bang, dead. Real tragic thing. Before you say sorry, it\u2019s cool. I made my peace with it years ago. Also, before you ask. Yes, there is life after death. It\u2019s just not what you expect. It\u2019s way cooler. I would tell ya, but you get your memory wiped when you come back to life. All I remember is being there and it being nice.\u201d\nShe answered all my questions without me even asking them. Had she already had this conversation before? I guess that was what most people would ask. Joining her by the counter, I stared at her. It must have been lonely being dead. \u201cHey, want to hang out sometime?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cHang out? You don\u2019t need to pity me.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not pity. We can listen to that band you saw before you died.\u201d\n\n \n\nShe let out a bellowing laugh, holding her stomach. \u201cHey, dead girl. Want to listen to the band you saw before you died?\u201d She said, instantly making me feel guilty.\n\n \n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cRelax, I\u2019m messing with you. I still love that band, so sure. I\u2019ll meet up with you after this shift. It will be nice feeling human again.\u201d With that, we both returned to our shifts, starting our new friendship.\n\n"

        "writing_prompt": "\"So, what immortality do you have?\" \"What?\" \"Well everybody in this room has a type of immortality, I got hyper regeneration, the guy over the is a lich, the girl in leather can save and reload, and I am not bothered enough to keep talking so what is your immortality?\" \"Memory\"",
        "story": "\u201cMemory. As long as someone remembers me, I\u2019ll be able to come back to life.\u201d I explained, feeling everyone gaze my way. Had I said something wrong? Compared to everyone else in this room, my powers seemed underwhelming. If anything, I felt jealous of them.\n\n \n\nThe girl wearing the dragon print leather jacket was the first to speak, her nametag reading Gemma. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that make you immortal?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cOh, great question, Gemma. Real top of the class question. Aren\u2019t you meant to be the smart one?\u201d Trax flipped Gemma off, moving to my side, hooking his arm around my shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re all immortal. So, yes. That makes him immortal.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cThat obviously isn\u2019t what I meant, you nincompoop. If you had two brain cells left in your constantly regenerating body, you would understand what I meant,\u201d Gemma huffed, crossing her arms over her leather jacket, glaring in my direction. I couldn\u2019t tell if she was glaring at me or Trax, but her stony stare was enough to make my shoulders slouch.\n\n \n\nLeo coughed, the skeletal man\u2019s nametag a little hard to read since it was caught between his ribs. \u201cI think she means that he\u2019s technically the most immortal of us all. We can all die if we aren\u2019t careful. If Trax\u2019s flesh is completely destroyed, he can\u2019t return. There has to be a part of him left to come back to. Gemma can die if she forgets to save after coming back to life, and I can be killed by someone breaking my curse. Gemma\u2019s trying to say that this person can\u2019t actually die.\u201d\n\n \n\nTrax released me, giving my side a poke. \u201cOh, so he thinks he\u2019s better than me?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWhat? I never said that.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cBut I bet you\u2019re thinking it.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cTrax, stop it. He\u2019s been through enough. Don\u2019t scare him.\u201d Leo pulled Trax away, leaving me alone on the opposite side of the room. I felt naked, standing before three immortals who didn\u2019t seem that fond of me.\n\n \n\n\u201cHow does your power work? Please explain it to the best of your abilities.\u201d Gemma requested.\n\n \n\n\u201cWell, when I die. I go back to someone\u2019s memory of me. Sorry, I don\u2019t understand the specifics of it.\u201d\n\n \n\nGemma sighed. \u201cFigured you wouldn\u2019t. No one ever understands the specifics of their powers. I\u2019m still not sure how mine works.\u201d\n\n \n\nTrax grinned, flaunting himself through the room, hands raised in the air like a champion boxer who had delivered the knockout blow. \u201cSpeak for yourselves. I understand my powers.\u201d \n\n\u201cBecause your powers are easy-to-understand Trax.\u201d Leo said, only to lose his nerve when Trax looked his way. \u201cI mean, regeneration is a more commonly recognized form of immortality and\u2026.. I\u2019ll stop speaking now.\u201d\n\n \n\n \u201cGood choice.\u201d Trax sat himself down on a bunk-bed, swinging his legs after he did. \u201cSo, you\u2019re the chosen one. The messiah. The one that will be picked?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cPicked? Where am I?\u201d It felt odd to ask such a question this late into the conversation, but they had bombarded me with information. This was the first chance I had to think for myself. \u201cDid I get kidnapped?\u201d\n\n \n\nLooking around the room, I took in my surroundings. Bunk beds, tv\u2019s, a bathroom, small kitchen and some game consoles. It wasn\u2019t exactly a prison, and yet it didn\u2019t feel homely either. Like someone was doing their best to simulate what a home should be.\n\n \n\n\u201cThe lady said she had a few questions to ask us. Nothing sinister, she promised. Though I\u2019ve never been kidnapped for a questionnaire before.\u201d Gemma said.\n\n \n\n\u201cI assumed someone was going to kill me. People don\u2019t like monsters like myself.\u201d Leo whined.\n\n \n\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t like looking at you either. It\u2019s creepy seeing a skeleton walk around. Makes me feel like mine\u2019s going to crawl out of my body.\u201d Trax saw Gemma\u2019s frustrated stare, throwing his arms up in response. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s true. I don\u2019t care if it hurts his feelings and stop saying kidnapped. We aren\u2019t children. It\u2019s adultnapped.\u201d\n\n \n\nGemma shook her head. \u201cHave you always been this stupid, or does it get worse after every death? I\u2019m only half jesting too. Part of me wants to know.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cOh, go load a save you bitch. Wait, why are you here? Can\u2019t you escape? Same goes for you photographs. Why are you both here?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWell, I would have to die to escape. I also don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m in danger.\u201d I said.\n\n \n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me you're scared of dying? It only hurts the first three times. After that, you get used to it. No worse than getting a needle. Guess we should all just wait then.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s your name?\u201d Leo asked, looking at me.\n\n \n\n\u201cKen. Nice to meet you.\u201d I said, realizing I didn\u2019t have a nametag of my own. Maybe it was because I was the newest one here?\n\n \n\nThe door opened to the room, and a woman entered, dressed in a coffee stain covered lab coat. She sat herself on the couch and smiled. \u201cEveryone\u2019s finally here. I\u2019m Dr. Marue. Before you ask, no, I don\u2019t plan to kill you or experiment on you. I\u2019m only here to ask you a few questions.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWhat? You couldn\u2019t book a phone interview or send them by mail?\u201d Trax asked, pointing to the door she had entered through. \u201cAm I free to leave?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cGo right ahead. You won\u2019t be paid, though. It\u2019s a decent payday too. Five thousand each from my personal funds.\u201d\n\nTrax didn\u2019t move, kicking his feet up on the bunk-bed, laying down. \u201cNow you\u2019re speaking my language. Ok, I\u2019ll play along.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWait. Why would you kidnap us if you were planning on paying us to answer a few questions? Most of us would have agreed to come here if you explained the situation.\u201d Gemma said.\n\n \n\n\u201cOh, shut up. Who cares? She\u2019s paying us. There isn\u2019t much I wouldn\u2019t let her do to me for that sort of money.\u201d\n\n \n\nDr. Marue ignored Trax\u2019s comment. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not the only one currently searching for you four. I\u2019ll be quick. You\u2019re not the only immortals we\u2019re aware of. In fact, you\u2019re four out of fifty in our database. Sadly for us, not everyone uses their powers as responsibly as you four. We need a way to kill those that take advantage of their powers. Which is where you all come in. You\u2019re our chance of finding out their weaknesses. Now, I proposed we do that by asking questions. The other members of my team wanted to cut you open. I\u2019m hoping with your answers we can find a way to stop them without resorting to such drastic measure.\u201d\n\n \n\nThe room fell silent, all of us thinking about the possibility of ending up on a lab table. That sickening feeling in my stomach not going away, even when Trax tried to lighten the mood, using his cockiness to hide his nerves.\n\n \n\n\u201cFor the right price, I\u2019ll let them cut me up.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be cut up by them. Not when their goal is to cause you as much pain as possible.\u201d\n\n \n\nAfter that, Dr. Marue took us one by one to a private room, interviewing us about our abilities. The questions were standard. When did I discover my immortality? How does it work? Any side effects? Any weaknesses? Weaknesses being the only question I had a helpful answer to.\n\n \n\n\u201cI come back as that person\u2019s memory of me. If someone thinks of me as a big crybaby. Well, that\u2019s what I come back as. Not literally, a big crybaby. But I might revert back to a sulking child until I grow up again. At least, that\u2019s my theory. I just noticed that when I came back through my mother\u2019s memories, I was a lot more handsome than I had previously been. Not to mention a lot stronger, too. Since she thought highly of me in her memories, I received those benefits.\u201d\n\n  \n\u201cFasinating. So, a bad person with your abilities could weaken themselves? Or turn into a monster.\u201d She ground her teeth at that thought before guiding me to the door. \u201cThank you for your time. There\u2019s a bus waiting for you outside that will take you back into town. I apologize for the sudden questioning. I hope we can do this in a more relaxed manner next time.\u201d We shook hands and soon I was on the bus, counting the money she gave me. The bus didn\u2019t wait for the other three. Perhaps they had already been taken home while I was waiting for my turn? It was probably safer if we didn\u2019t know where each other lived. Still, I couldn\u2019t stop wondering what answers they gave as I headed home.\n\n"
