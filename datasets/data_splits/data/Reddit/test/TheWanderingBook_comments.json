        "story": "The world was filled with conflict.  \nSo many power systems abound in our lands, that it was obvious that there could be no true peace.  \nHeroes, villains with a myriad powers, and abilities, both innate, acquired or artificial, and technological.  \nMages, and barbarians, cultivators, and clerics, and warlocks and all sorts of different professions co-existed, and were always fighting for the right to be called: the best, the orthodox path towards the peak.  \nToday...an immediate armistice has been called.  \nAll villains, and criminals have been pardoned, all atrocities forgotten.  \nFormer mortal enemies now gather together, and plan and prepare...  \nPeople who sacrificed lives for their own gain, now work together with saints...  \nAll for one reason: dragon sightings have been confirmed.\n\n  \nIn ancient times...all the races that today fight for hegemony had the same status: food, toys and slaves...for the dragons.  \nBut the times have changed, and the dragons' might, and power have angered the Heaven's themselves...or at least, that was the leading theory.  \nFor one day...we humans, and everyone else found out that our \"masters\", our oppressors and jailers...have disappeared.  \nWe escaped from our prisons, and farms...and spread through the lands.  \nAeons, and eras have passed, until we all reached such highs that we could leave these lands, and wander the stars, yet none did, for we wanted it.  \nWe wanted to rule over our home-planet.  \nBut...despite our strengths, our power and confidence...the appearance of our old...enemies, have brought an overwhelming feeling of dread.\n\n  \nThe sightings were meagre, one dragon here...one dragon there, but...  \nA merchant city was razed to the ground due to selling an ancient dragon's skeleton.  \nA sect that focused on draconic martial arts have been destroyed, heads put on spikes, and display.  \nIt was a clear message.  \nThey were back, and they didn't like what they saw.  \nEveryone gathered around the strongest Empires, sects and families, and waited the day.  \nThe day they will attack.  \nAnd it has arrived.\n\n  \nIt was a gentle day, sun shining down on our lands...when I saw it.  \nShadows blanketing the endless skies, as clouds gathered, and a storm started out of nowhere.  \nTheir roars shook the lands, as beasts and birds fled everywhere.  \nI was atop a watchtower, power channeled into it, ready to fire the embedded spells...when they got closer.  \nBeings of such sizes were at front, that even demigod beasts would look like ants in front of them.  \nA flap of their wings pushed towering trees to the ground, flattening them, and despite still being quite far...I could feel the winds created by their flying.  \nA watchtower shot the first spell, and I followed suit.  \nI watched as a meteor sized lightning spell hit a dragon...and nothing.  \nIt flew forward, as if nothing happened...even though that spell could have leveled an entire city...  \nI chuckled, as I started pouring in more and more power into the watchtower.  \nI knew it was pointless, but I was of mediocre talent, and I hoped that I could buy time...until someone who can hold them back arrives.  \nThen I saw a dragon casually pick a watchtower...and eat it whole...and I burst out laughing.  \n\"Not me, oversized lizard!\", I roared, as I overcharged the watchtower, just as a maw was closing in, and it exploded into myriad lights.  \nMy last thoughts were of a wish...a simple wish that the explosion and my death weren't completely meaningless."

        "story": "In an endless world, a plain the size of a planet was filled to the brim with tents.  \nIn the main tent, the generals of each legion, and the Marshal of the entire army gathered, shivering around the table, as a young man toyed with a knife.  \n\"So, tell me, how are we still here, and not in the lands of the Ancient Empire?\", he asked.  \n\"Prince...the pass through this side is guarded...and we can't surround, or overwhelm with number, due to the pass's width...and...\", before the general could finish, a knife flashed, and his head was rolling on the floor, no blood spilt, the knife back in the hand of the young man.  \n\"It is one man, by himself, in a castle on a hill, castle that has been there for tens of thousands of years...ancient...  \nHow does the entire Northern Army of my Empire fail to take it?\", he calmly asked, but this calmness made the battle-hardened individuals shiver.\n\n  \n\"Prince, he awakened a royal Asura bloodline.\", the Marshal said.  \nAt this, the Prince stopped playing with the knife.  \n\"Which one?\", he asked.  \n\"Six-Armed Steel King Ashverosa's line, if it is the same or a branch's version, or a mutated one, it is yet unknown.\", she said.  \n\"You are a Dragonling, still young, but yet given the position of Marshal, oh Princess of Fire...fire melts steel, doesn't it?\", the prince continued.  \nThe generals froze, while the Marshal just sighed.\n\n  \n\"Perfect weapon mastery, and water, earth and steel element manipulation is what we observed as of now.  \nHe has insights into the laws of War, elements, weapons, and...Death.\", she said.  \n\"One of the Supreme Laws, huh?  \nHave you sent our succubi to charm him? Our spirits to tempt him? Bribe him?\", the prince continued.  \nThe Marshal fidgeted...and for the first time, the prince laughed.  \n\"So it's true! A duchess of our Empire! A pureblooded young fire dragon...has offered to wed an enemy!  \nAnd was...refused.  \nTell me, Princess of Fire...just how strong is he, for you to lower yourself that much in front of him?\", he asked.  \n\"Take a look yourself, Your Highness, for our attacks are never-ending...and been so for eight months now...\", she said, leaving the tent.\n\n  \nThe Prince left with the Marshal, and both flew high, watching the castle on the hill that led towards the mountains...and the single safe path into the lands of the Ancient Empire.  \nThere a six-armed grey skin tall man sat on the walls, as his hands never stopped throwing rocks, and spears at the approaching army.  \nEvery now and then, he jumped off with some spears, and wrecked havoc amidst the enemy lines.  \nThe earth fell and rose under his steps, the metal of the weapons and armors of the enemy shifted by his will, and a thick mist followed him, hiding him.  \n\"That's a pureblooded Asura, or at least it will be soon, as he continues to drink the blood of my people.  \nOffer him yourself, and my youngest sister, and tell him that he shall become an Archduke, or even a King under my father, the Emperor, only answering to Him and nobody else, and if he doesn't accept...  \nLevel the mountain, or dig a tunnel through it,  that will be easier than to win a fight of attrition against an Asura.\", the Prince said, as he left in an awful mood.  \nThe Marshal nodded, and gathered the generals once more, to discuss how to handle this...once and for all.  \nFor failure was not an option."

The reward?\n\n  \nA few days later, the Hero visited me.  \nAs soon as I saw him...coming in with two of my sisters...I roared, the huge bed creaking under my struggle.  \n\"Whew, even when your power are sealed, Brigitte, your body is still like a dragoness'.\" , he smiled, as my two sisters just...nodded along.  \n\"This is it? This is the reason The Valkyrie battalion was sent, instead of everyone?!  \nWe prided ourselves of being chosen to accompany you, as we thought it was a proof of our dedication, hard-work and talent!  \nAnd this is the true reason? WE ALL BECOME YOUR BRIDES?!\", I said.  \n\"Yeah, but don't worry, I chose you because of your dedication, hard-work and talent...  \nFew women look like you, few women have your stamina and damn, few women have the temper of you Valkyries...  \nI knew exactly what I wanted in exchange of my services, the moment I saw one of your teams, hunt a drake.\", he said.  \n\"MONSTER!\", I screamed at him, but he just nodded, as he...as he looked me up and down.\n\n  \n\"Yep, as I thought, you have the best body...especially when you aren't in your armor, and when you don't use chest binding.\", he said.  \nI spat at him.  \n\"Darling!\", one of my...one of the women exclaimed...as she quickly cleaned him with a handkerchief.  \n\"You already broke them...  \nThat's why you were hellbent in getting the Incubus blood, and the Dragon Bone Marrow.\", I said.  \nHe froze...before smirking.  \n\"Not the leader of the Valkyries for no reason, are we now?  \nDamn, that was a quick conclusion...yes, these two are mere concubines in my harem, so I didn't need to wait until the wedding to show them a thing or two.  \nBut don't worry, you will be my 2nd wife, as I will have to marry a princess to be the main one, still...you will be a legal partner of mine, be proud.\", he said.  \nThat's when I snapped.\n\n  \nThe seal on my powers broke, as I roared with anger, my powers turning to ash everything around me.  \nI kicked towards his groin with enough strength to shatter a mountain...yet...he stopped it with a finger.  \n\"Such dainty feet, and look at the flexibility of these toes...\", he said, as he grabbed my barefoot foot...and threw me into the wall.  \n\"Your generals, and you will be fun to break-in, little mares of mine.  \nHaha, being summoned as a Hero to this world is so fun.\", he said, as he turned to leave.  \n\"Big Sis...he is nice, and kind...\", one of the women said.  \n\"Yes...and in bed...you will come to realize that this is what we should do.\", the other said, as they left.  \nI stood there, embedded into the wall...and cried for the first time in my life.  \nNot because my future, not because I lost, not because all the lives my sisters sacrificed on the battlefield...  \nBut because I will have to watch the sisters I spilt blood with...becoming his toys...  \n\"It would have been better for all of us to die back then...\", I thought, as I tried to free myself, and start thinking of ways to avoid this..."

Mother, father, sisters, cousins...everyone... I did it.\", I broke down, crying, and once again, losing consciousness.  \nWhen I awoke, I tidied myself, found some human clothes in the palace, and started to sketch out my future plans.  \nI had debts to repay...and with all this treasure...I had a new kingdom to start...in...in their memory..."

Grandpa! I-Is that true?\", my youngest asked, with her innocent gaze.  \nMy in-laws, monsters they were with me...pampered and loved my kids to no end.  \n\"We...\", Liliana said.  \n\"Yes...we were wrong...we apologize.  \nCan you find it in you to forgive us...we want to see our family more often.  \nLong lives aren't a blessing, if they are not lived with our loved ones.\", Silvius chimed in.  \nI looked at them...and then at my kids.  \n\"Fine. Once a month I shall host a dinner for all of us...the holidays will be 50/50, once at my place, once at yours...  \nBut if even once you dare to question my love for your son...it's over.\", I said.  \nThey nodded and agreed, happy to be able to spent more time with their only son, and grandkids.  \nLater that night, my husband was really happy.  \n\"You are amazing.\", he said, kissing me.  \nHe must have been worried about this topic, because this night he was much more heated then usually, and I could see that our lives will be even happier from now on...if...and only if...  \nThe in-laws behave how they did today."
