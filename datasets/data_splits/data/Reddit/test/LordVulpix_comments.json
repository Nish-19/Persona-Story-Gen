        "writing_prompt": "\"No, mom. I'm not a grave robber, I'm a dungeon crawler. And no, it's not the same thing, dad!\"",
        "story": "I sat at the dinner table just looking over to my dear mother and father. It was the first time in five years that I could sit and chat with them. My party couldn't get a room in the Inn, my cleric nearly barred from her church and the worst of it all, my parents are the start of it. \"You called us grave robbers?\" I blurted out as my party relaxed in the other room. I could hear our cleric spit up the tea she was served as our barbarian just gave a quick hah.\n\n\"Well, you are. You said you do this all the time.\" My dear sweet mother said as she looks over. \"They did wipe their boots, right? I don't want grave soil on my new rug. Your father got that beautiful bear just last moon.\"\n\n\"We're not grave robbers, we're dungeon crawlers.\" \n\n\"Isn't that the same thing?\" My father who was busy rubbing a bit of oil on a fresh bow he was making for my brother's daughter. \n\n\"No dad, it's not the same thing.\" I could hear my party laughing to themselves as our wizard groaned a bit. I swear I heard coin passing hands.\n\n\"Well, son, what's the difference.\" Hecsaid, setting the bow down to look me in the eyes.\n\n\"The difference being, one is a job, the other is mental sickness.\" The barbarian sputtered and nearly choked on their drink if I heard right. \"We make good money and help people out doing it.\"\n\n\"People pay you to rob graves? Are they sick in the head?\" My father pressured as I heard the cleric mutter a soft sometimes, but my parents didn't hear her. I just face palmed. \n\n\"We don't rob graves, we go into caves, ruins and other mostly abandoned locations to stop monsters, cults and sometimes undead.\" I regretted that last mention instantly. \n\n\"Undead? Like skeletons and zombies? Where are they at? Graveyards? Crypts?\" My dad looked like he was about to get on a roll.\n\n\"We're stopping the grave robbers and necromancers that raise the dead. Hells, remember when Aunt Germina got sick really bad. That's cause some lich in Chult made this thing to consume every soul in the world. We stopped that!\"\n\n\"Ooh, and where was he?\" My dad asked firmly. \n\n\"The...\" I sighed as I remembered the name. \"Tomb of Annihilation, but they converted that tomb to some ancient gods of chult into this big area full of monsters, cultists and even a Beholder.\"\n\n\"See, grave robbers!\" My dad said and just froze up.\n\n\"Da... da... ugh... Mom talk some sense into him. We're not digging up corpses. We're stopping the bad guys for the good of the world. Even the gods have blessed us for our actions.\" I could hear whispers from my party in the silence that followed before my mom finally spoke.\n\n\"Well... even some of the gods are bad. Like that spider one, or the five headed dragon.\" I just put my head in my hands and groaned. \"Buuuut... Honey, if the gods say they are doing good, then they are. So maybe we shouldn't tell everyone he's a grave robbers. Maybe dungeon critter is better?\" She asked rather sincerely, leading to our cleric finally busting out laughing, causing the rest of them to join in.\n\n\"That's a good party name!!!\" The wizard said. \"DUNGEON CRITTERS!!!\" The laughter hurt me deep down in my soul."

        "writing_prompt": "You are a terrible mage, yet through pure, dumb luck you managed to defeat an archmage in a duel, thus taking their place according to ancient tradition. Many mages protest against giving such a prestigious position to a clearly unqualified candidate, including yourself.",
        "story": "\"Once a decade, the Archmage must accept a duel, even from the lowest of students. No one has challenged the Grand Archmage, Hero of Themas, Master Evoker and War Mage, in over 30 years. The Great and Powerful Davon.\" An announcer said as I stood just inside the arena. The grand mage sent out several balls of elemental power swirled around him. He crashed them into the arena and covered it in molten stone, large blocks sheets of ice and even flooded some of the arena.\n\n\"His opponent and challenger, the failure of a mage. The worst mage around even by his own admission. Bart!\" The roars of laughter just filled the arena. I had to think back to how this happened. I am just a stage magician at best.\n\n- Two Days Ago -\n\n\"And for my next trick! Pulling a rabbit out of a hat!\" I took my hat off and showed the crowd the inside of the hat. \"Nothing is in my hat, as you can see. Nothing at all. Nothing up my sleeves either.\" I rolled them up to show the few kids watching my bare arms. \"I say a few magic words and wiggle my fingers, presto alazamzim!!\" A puff of smoke escaped my hat and I yanked out a full sized lion who roared at me. I quickly shoved it back in. \"Oopse, wrong hat.\" The kids laughed as I tossed it off stage.\n\nOnly a second later did it roll back to my foot and stop. I was just about to conjure a deck of cards for the next set of tricks. \"Hey, get out of here, kitty. I got a show to do.\" I nudge the hat aside a only for a carrot to pop out. \"You're not tricking me this time.\" I took my hat and threw it off stage while casting a dispel magic causing it to lose its power. Once off stage I smiled. \"Must have woken him up during his cat nap!\" The kids where loving the bit, but as it rolled back on stage I knew someone was messing with me.\n\n\"Oh? You're back again, Mr Kitty? Well then take this! Ingnis!\" A shot of fire magic and the hat should have burned away, but my spell was countered. \"Oh, very funny. Ignis! Ignis! Eruptus!\" Three for three in a row.\" I dropped the act and saw an old man laughing in the corner of the theater. \"I see you like having a laugh, but this is my show here. If you want to challenge the worst mage to a stage show, come on up. Or are you too scared to lose a duel infront of some kids\"\n\nThe whole country felt the crackle of magic as I declared the duel. The man stopped laughing and he then gave a big sigh. \"Did you have to say the d word? Really?\" Once the archmage robes formed around him did I understand the gravity of the moment. \n\n\"Well... ffff-ferrets...\" I said causing a ferret to summon out of my pocket.\n\n- Today, duel day, dooms day, and other ominous words -\n\n\"Bart, any last words?\" The archmage said with a grim look on his face. \n\n\"A few! Let me show my best trick. Pulling a rabbit out of my hat.\" The crowd groaned and the archmage laughed before waving me on. \"As you can all see, there's nothing in the hat, and nothing up my sleeves.\" I showed the whole arena my hat before wiggling my fingers. \"Presto,  a rabbit!!!\" I yanked out a dragon head that spewed lightning and shoved it back in. The sound of silence made me look around only to see the Archmage convulsing on the ground from the lightning electrifying the water at his feet.\n\nA second or two and I just stared at my hat. \"Something is wrong with my hat...\" I then looked over. \"Is he okay?\" No sooner did I ask than I felt a rush of magic. The Archmage robes formed around my body and faded from his, leaving him in some still nice robes but not the important ones. \"Oh ferrets...\" My ferret popped out of my pocket and looked around for a moment before hiding in a new one. Angry jeers, boos and screams of rage filled the arena as I just looked around.\n\n I agreed with them, I bet on me losing too."

        "writing_prompt": "A thought is forced into the minds of all living beings: \"4 billion years ago I created life on 4 planets, you will now be teleported to a new dimension and fight for survival, those who do not fight will be erased from existence. Only one may survive.\"",
        "story": "\"'Four Billion years ago; I created life on four planets. You will now be teleported to a new dimension and fight for survival. Those who do not fight will be erased from existence. Only ONE may survive.' These words are what we all heard 25 years ago just before we where teleported to here with nothing but what we had on us at the time.\" A woman in a very nice suit said on a live broadcast across planet. \"Five years we fought and killed the monsters of our new home Kratos.\"\n\n\"At seven we fought the Zendrazi coalition for the first time. In one year we killed half of the Lizards before they surrendered and where assimilated into our nation. Our Ninth year we finally wiped out the Nation of North Korea and further assimilated Japan, South Korea and what remained of the United States.\" Cheers rang out as ceremonial flags where raised of the former nations with only North Korea being burned.\n\n\"Our tenth to twelfth years we fought the Russian and Chineese Armies and created the first Nuclear Bomb in this dimension. Thankfully, Radiation is consumed by the native plants of the Zendrazi and we have successfully claimed the sun scorched lands by now.\" More flags rose with the Russian and Chinese flag burning. Those from the Middle East, India and island nations where bordered in black.\n\n\"We still mourn the countries wiped out by the two once great powers.\" The woman speaking then shook her head. \"At year sixteen we watched in horror as the Kithran army was sent to slaughter the remainder of what was once the African Nations. Worse was when they faced off with the European Union. They withheld their nukes upon discovering that the Kithran where slaves to the fourth species and normally pacifists. Enraged the Union, the Australian Commandos and our own JTF went out to rescue them.\"\n\nThe Kithran flag started to rise with the Australian and European Union, though the flags of the union was bordered in black except for France and Great Britain. \"We welcomed the Kithran refugees to our fold with open arms and brought the Australian nation to our fold to fight the final enemy.\" A chorus of cheers rang out from the Kithran in the crowd. \n\n\"For the last six years we fought the hive minds of the Xept. We deployed the first antimatter bomb to destroy their overmind, the central intelligence that governed their hive clusters. We nuked and raided all the hives we could find. Even now we seek to wipe them off the face of Kratos!!!\" A blazing Xept banner was displayed though it was allowed to burn slower and longer.\n\n\"That leads us to today. On the twenty fifth anniversary of our arrival. We have taken in most of the human race, most of the Zendrazi and Kithran. We will continue to scour the Xept as we need, but still there is one foe left!\" The screen shifted to a large missile with the red maple leaf on a white band around the tip. \n\n\"Today we launch the first interdimentional missile at the ones who put us here. They said it themselves, 'Those who do not fight will be erased from existence.' And we the proud people of Canada will do the erasing!\" The Canadian Prime Minister said as the missile launched and vanished into a self made dimensional rift.\n\nA Torle'th youth turned from the screen showing the broadcast from the latest and longest running war world stream to see a bright flash of light. It took ten universes, hundreds of trillions of years and countless war world streams before the Torle'th where ever faced with any repercussions for their twisted actions. \n\nToo bad they didn't survive to learn from it."

        "writing_prompt": "You died in a past life, but woke up reincarnated as the god of a newly formed universe",
        "story": "\"Ugh... it's so dark. Can someone get the lights?\" I said and soon as the gods escaped my lips there where countless explosions and booms. I rolled around grabbing my head as I fought back the ringing in my ears. \"Agh!!! What the hell? What's going on?\" I started to move away till a bright big screen filled my vision, blinding me once more. \n\nWELCOME TO UNIVERSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM VERSION 4.22.76B. PLEASE INPUT A USER NAME AND START ARCHON CREATION.\n\n\"Archon? What's that? Am I in VR or something?\" I tried to remove a headset only to fing my face. \"The heck is all this?\" A new smaller screen popped up.\n\nYou are the god of this universe, and in charge. Once you make your archon they will be able to provide more help. They are your right hand and most loyal servant. No Morningstar incidents like in version 4 like in previous versions. \n\n\"No morning star? Wait, Lucifer Morningstar? So they may be my devil? Fun...\" I grumbled as I started up with a Username. Lord Vulpix was my go to in life, might as well use it here. Then the options for my Archon appeared, there where billions of presets ranging from  hot men and women to dogs, cats and even things only drempt up by Lovecraft. \n\nPressing the random button a few times showed me just how many options I had. I was staring at one that looked like if a Raptor had Hatsune Miku's hair but wearing a hotdog costume when I groaned at the choices. \"Seriously, too many options.\" \n\n\"Well, M'lord, you do have full creation over me.\" The Raptor said in a voice as deep as Morgan Freeman's. \"Maybe we can narrow down the options.\" I had recoiled away from them when they spoke and just stared for a second. \"I was fully aware from the first preview.\"\n\n\"Okay then. So, narrow it down. What are you supposed to be to me?\"\n\n\"I am your voice, right hand and helper. I interact with the mortals for you. I also manage the system and act to see things for you. Some try to use me as a lover or consort, but that isn't my job. You can make those later.\" \n\n\"So you're my system admin and IT guy?\" They sort of shrugged. \"You're also my avatar right? The others won't see me?\" \n\n\"Essentially, so you can choose what people see you as through me. I also can assume a form similar to the final form and their form. To gods you make you can even take the form yourself or another custom form. That can be changed at will. In fact, I can be edited in time.\" \n\n\"That does narrow things down some.\" I mused with some ideas and watched millions of options fade away before I could say anything. All the indescribable ones, and then many of the bug related ones. I took my time tweaking and creating my Archon till I had one I liked.\n\nWhen I was finished I looked them over with a smile. A slender red fox figure stood before me in simple cargo shorts. He was sporting six fluffy tails and long red hair. He was covered in fur like a traditional red fox. With a spin they posed before smiling. \"Great work, boss.\" He even had a more relaxed voice sounding like Chris Sabat. \n\n\"Great, now that that's done. What's next?\" I asked and then paused to see a whole universe around me. Nebula collapsing and forming stars at a rapid pace and galaxies forming around massive blackholes. \"How... how long did we take making you?\"\n\n\"Only one billion years. No worries the universe is on speed 10 right now till the formation of the first life form.\" My Archon said as we watched it run. \"You where more agnostic in your past life, so you're mind said to let things go. You can make direct changes, but right now there isn't many heavy elements or viable planets.\" \n\n\"Oh... makes sense.\" I sat there a second or two. \"So, next?\" \n\n\"Next, is all you, but making angels and your great evil is always a good step. My evil counterpart prevents me from going bad like in previous versions.\" \n\n\"So... more character creation?\" I asked with a grin."

        "story": "It had been seconds since the last grain of sand was to fall. Seconds since the last breath should have escaped his lips and seconds since I stood by watching. A beautiful crimson melted the pristine snow. Frozen almost in time this one man among many still held on. \n\nA fool worked his frozen hands to the bone, red ice tempting to turn the fingers black. \"I am death, who are you to stop my harvest?\" I asked of the living man.\n\n\"I won't let you have him. He's still breathing. He'll live.\" The medic said as he called for evacuation. \n\nI followed my harvest to the aid station and saw more waiting for my scythe, yet it was not yet time for many. I watched as mortals clad in white took my harvest from me.\n\nIt had been hours since I watched the hourglass empty. Hours since his last breath should have been and hours more since my scythe was denied. Warm, breathing by a machine and being filled with blood, my harvest was open to the world.\n\nBullets, shrapnel and even bones of his friends where removed. Yet he still lived as the doctor leaned over the body. My fury grew at being denied. \"Who are you to be tending to this corpse like it can live? It should be mine! I will reap what is ripe!\" I felt the fury of a man as the heart tempted to stop.\n\n\"No!\" The surgeon cried out as he grabbed the heart and started to massage and pump it by hand. \"Don't let that bastard win! Live, soldier! Live!\" \n\nIt had been days since the time had come. Days since his heart stopped and days that I have lingered. The soldier stood up for the first time since the land mine took his squad. The denial of his death filled me with wrath. \n\n\"You should be dead! You died in the snow and your time has come. You are but wheat to be reaped by my scythe and who are you to remain standing?\" I bellowed in his face. \"Lords, Kings and Ladies all bow down to me. How dare you stand before me?!\" \n\nThe look of cold determination halted my wrath as he looked me in the eyes. \"I'm just a soldier with a job to do. Now step in line, and you can reap the enemies with me.\" He marched past me as I felt his hourglass grow heavy with new sand.\n\nIt had been years since the sand started up again. Years since the mine, and years since I met him. Now I stand beside him as he lays in bed. Old, withered and fading. The ones who saved him had long been reaped, his enemies all harvested, and even his wife fell to my power. And yet, I still felt the indignation of a man who defied me. The man laid in bed, yet never bowed to me. Not once. \n\n\"Who are you to deny me?\" I asked with a hiss. \"To deny my domain so bluntly?\"\n\n\"I am a soldier. My enemies can never be allowed to win.\" He said with a weak breath. \"But... to my friends who I walked with for so long, I might let you win once in a while. Are you my friend or my enemy?\"\n\nI had no answer to that. When I finally reaped him I felt empty. Why did I feel so empty? Why?"
