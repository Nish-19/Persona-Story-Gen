        "story": "I stood confused in the middle of a spotlight. Everything beyond me was cast into shadows.\n\n\"Classify?\" I turned around. My hands flitted through my pockets, bombs, guns, vials, anything anything anything. My eyes danced through the darkness, not even a mote of dust to manipulate. I look directly up, burning my retinas.\n\n\"Check the translator. Can it hear well?\" the voice asked, the tone shifting as if towards and away. That question bought time, Multiple people. Multiple avenues. Multiple avenues. Multiple ways out.\n\n\"I stare.\" I said, looking up still at the lights above me. They were so very different than the ones I'd made. Coils and diodes. Coils and diodes. But these... these were different. No way to reach them.\n\n\"Turn down the light before you blind it.\" came a gruff voice in another direction. Higher than the other. Multiple rings of people. Multiple levels. ....... a hierarchy.\n\nI felt around in my mouth. \"It does hurt my eyes. We shouldn't hurt peons without cause, right?\" My voice muffled and distorted. \n\n\"Speak up. Get your hand out of your auditory.\" Came the first one.\n\nI ripped out a tooth and balanced it on my finger.\n\n\"You didn't answer.\" I said and threw the tooth into the light. It vaporized suddenly before it could hit the light at all. A bolt of purple light had come through, and for a brief instant, I could see creatures. Creatures.\n\nCreatures.\n\nOf Shapes.\n\nOf Colors.\n\nOf Sizes.\n\nI smiled. There was only one shot. But multiple guns. I start to rip out more teeth. It hurts. But not as much as looking up. \"Guards!\" A bolt of purple flys at my feet. I don't stop, but the air smells of ozone and death. How I missed it. I'm no threat. Not right now. But they can't know that. If they did. They wouldn't shoot me.\n\nI'm ready before the next bolt flys. I jump and twist my body into a needle, the purple bolt flows around my limbs and merely sears the flesh of my breasts. I cackle. A cage. A cage of light. A cage of light they'd need to open to allow their warning through. \n\nBut now. But now. But now! I'm out! I charge towards the nearest creature and grab them. Voices start to scream, a beautiful cacophony. A bolt fires and I swing my new shield to block, to deflect. It screams and I hear it plead in perfect human, yet as it dies, I notice the words become dis-jointed. Less understandable. Less human. Useful to know.\n\nI giggle as I leap across the rings, pure darkness is my friend. Lights are flooded. I slam into the creature of green coating, hard shelled, articulate tendrils gripping at the armament. I shove teeth into its eyes.\n\nI grab the tentacle holding the gun. It could work for anyone, it could work for only one. But if it's physical... if it's physical. I pull the trigger applying pressure on the tendril and purple death fires at one of the other guards. I cackle as I continue to fire, swinging the guard screaming in agony to block more return fire. I scatter others to draw their fire. To reveal their position. To allow me to aim. To fire.\n\nVery... very... very soon. the room is silent.\n\n\"I recall.\" I said, a smile quivering on my lips as I slowly walk towards the position of the first voice. A small red creature, spikes and teeth very apparent. It's hiding. Fearful. Some languages transcend species. I should know. I killed all the one in my universe.\n\n\"I recall recall recall, a question.\" I say as I point the heavy weapon at my feet and fire. Whimpers echo around in the darkness.\n\nI turn and address the rest.\n\n\"A peon. Should we hurt them, without reason?\" I whisper.\n\nNobody answers. None of them move, none of them seem to hear me. Good to know.\n\n\"SHOULD WE HURT A USEFUL PEON?\" I scream. I hear fearful sputtering.\n\n\"No. But there's no use in harming... in harming us.\" Such an odd voice, and from such an odd looking creature. Pink and floating. Already below my feet a patch of good is turning from black to brown to burgundy to maroon.\n\n\"Well, no reason to be afraid.\" I say as I walk towards it. \"I'm happy to join a club of fellow immortals.\"\n\nBut I am curious...\n\n\"First thing however...\"\n\nSo many things.\n\n\"You implied there are still mortal things alive out there.\""

We don't waaaaAAAAAaaaaaannnntttt... anyone knowing we're here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Just turn on the lights.\\\" a small girl's voice said from the top of the dark stairwell. With a barely audible click, light flooded the sub-basement and illuminated the two men nursing bumps on their heads. \\\"No one's awake, and my dad works late anyway.\\\" She said as she lightly walked down the steps and slapped the beam that the two men had smacked their heads on.\\n\\n\\\"Child, we can take it from here.\\\" said the larger and darker haired of the two men. \\\"Run on back to bed now. The... uh...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The safety inspection and repairs will be... dangerous. We'll have to activate the unsafe machine. To see what needs... safety parts. Attached.\\\" The smaller man said.\\n\\n\\\"Right.\\\" The small girl said. \\\"But my dad didn't build it with just an on-off switch.\\\" She smiled and lightly stepped ahead of them towards a door made of solid steel. \\n\\n\\\"We are smart night safety inspectors. We-\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And construction workers.\\\" The smaller man chimed in.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, we are smart night safety inspectors and construction workers. We can figure it out on our own.\\\" The larger man said.\\n\\n\\\"Of course.\\\" The little girl said as she typed in a 16 digit passcode she'd seen her dad enter a few dozen times. \\\"Just don't push the button.\\\" She said with a bow, waving the two men into the main chamber. Lights began to flicker on, illuminating an auditorium stretching deep into the ground. Seating lined the walls and a stone staircase descended to a central dais. Above floated a black cube.\\n\\n\\\"My dad spends every day here. It gets noisy. So mom put in the door.\\\" The small girl said as she jumped from row to row next to the stairs.\\n\\n\\\"Child, you'll get hurt if you keep jumping like that. It is much safer to go to bed.\\\" The larger man said as he slowly descended the staircase.\\n\\n\\\"Of course, Mr. Safety Inspector.\\\" The girl said in mid-air without looking at him.\\n\\n\\\"And construction worker.\\\" The smaller man said as he tried to keep pace with the larger man's steps.\\n\\n\\\"Of course, Mr. Night Safety Inspector and Construction Worker.\\\" the girl said as she made another leap. Her foot slid off the edge of the seating, but caught herself before fully falling.\\n\\n\\\"Child, go to bed. Thank you for your help, but it is time for sleep.\\\" The larger man said as he reached the black cube.\\n\\n\\\"He's right, little girl. It's going to be boring. You need to leave.\\\" \\n\\n\\\"Okay.\\\" The girl said. \\\"But I need to point out the button you shouldn't press first. It'd be DANGEROUS if you pushed it. You're making sure things are safe, right?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Child-\\\" The larger man started before a tug on his sleeve and a look from the smaller man stopped him.\\n\\nThe larger man approached the black cube and saw there was no interface, no keyboards, no screen to view, no sensors of any kind. \\\"Fine, child. You may show us the danger button. BUT\\\" His tone sounding more like thunder than human speech \\\"after you help,\\\" He held out a pinky longer than the girl's hand, \\\"you must promise\\\", the word 'promise' held a deep reverence, \\\"to go to bed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Okay!\\\" The girl said and shook on his pinky. A hand shot out quickly and gripped her shoulder.\\n\\n\\\"Child.\\\" The man said, \\\"do not make a promise you have no intention of keeping. Only dirt and wind do that.\\\" a tone of disappointment creeping in at the edges. \\\"Are you either?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"....no.\\\" The little girl said, a mix of anger, and indignity playing through her voice.\\n\\n\\\"Hey big guy. Lighten up. We don't want to send her running away.\\\" The smaller man said, tugging at the sleeves of the larger man while walking towards the cube. The larger man released the girl and she turned away, a scared expression on her face dancing beneath an angry one. \\n\\n\\\"So, how does this work?\\\" the smaller man said as he poked the black cube. A ripple of squares went through it. \\\"Huh.\\\" The man said and poked it from two places at once, observing how the cubic ripples converged against each other.\\n\\nThe girl said as she placed her palm against the black surface. It felt like ice. As she did a screen seemed to fade from the sheer black, on it were several buttons, switches and what the younger man could only describe as a doo-dad.\\n\\n\\\"So... um... which shouldn't...?\\\" The younger man asked.\\n\\n\"This one.\" The young girl said pointing at a lower green button.\n\n\"That one?\" The larger man asked pointing and accidentally clicking a purple button. The cube shifted and became a sphere. The two men jumped back.\n\n\"No. That's fine. Just push the blue button.\" The girl said, except as she rounded about the sphere, she found she could no longer reach the screen. \"Little help?\"\n\n\"No. Promise child.\" The larger man said.\n\n\"You didn't even know which one it was.\" The girl argued. \"I didn't help you if you don't even know what not to push.\"\n\n\"It's okay.\" The smaller man said crouching down to meet her eye level. \"It's the green one, right?\"\n\n\"Green is here.\" The larger man said and pointed at the top left of the screen at a non-descript green button.\n\n\"No, that's wrong.\" The smaller man said as he stood up and walked over to the screen. \"Correct, it's the wrong button.\" The larger man said. \"No, that's not it.\" The smaller man said. \"It's down there.\" The girl scoffed and said pointing towards the bottom right. \"There are too many green ones. Which-\" The larger man asked. \"This one.\" The smaller man said, slightly annoyed, pointing towards the green in the center. \"No, that's not right.\" The girl said. \"This is not the right wrong button?\" The larger man asked pointing towards the center. \"Don't push it.\" The smaller man said. \"No!\" The girl said and stomped up to the screen. \"Don't push...\" she jumped into the air as high as she could. \"THIS...\"\n\nThe sphere began to shift. Shrink. Expand. Ripples of cubes and sphere began to appear around its surface.\n\n\"Child! Run!\" \"Crap.\" \"uh oh.\"\n\nWithin a second, the black roiling mass expanded out to cover the entire room. And then, just as quickly, it returned to a cube floating above the dais.\n\n\n\n"

Because I don't, but I do think some form of punishment is warranted.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"...where is the most likely place your fellow assassins would be?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think they'll probably be in dreamland. If I'm keeping time right and that clock is telling the truth, I know I should be keeping track on my own, but it's hard. I know it's day but there's nothing wrong with catching a few extra hours so you can better topple a tyrant.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where do they feel safe enough to rest?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Probably nowhere if we're being honest. The king started hunting them before they actually committed any crimes! Did you know that? The king hunts people?

I wonder if they could do this with therapy! It'd make things go so much faster. And let's face it, all the blood on my hands? I'll definitely need it. I assume you must take a hit of this every now and then, or does suppressing all the blood on your hands mean you can't? I'm sure you've killed at least a dozen, right?

        "story": "I climbed the steps of my tower and cursed at my twice broken ankle. Lightning was storming outside, just the right natural conduit I needed to perform. The townspeople were gathered below as I stood above them. A flash of light illuminated the barren fields, the miles of stumps and, far in the distance, a castle.\n\n\"Many of you have lost!\" I scream above the tempest. \"Loved ones! Homes!\" Rain crashed so violently I gripped the parapets of the tower. Already the torrent soaked past cloak and into bone. \"We have lost our way of life!\" I feel a tingle on my neck. \"BUT NOT OUR DEAD!\" I screech into the night. Blinding pain and draconic roars fill my body and shatter my bones. I cry to the night as I hold the energy within.\n\n\"WITH THIS MIGHT!\" I scream towards the people.\n\nAnother strike finds my body. A guttural animal plea escapes my throat.\n\n\"WITH THIS PAIN!\" I scream at the castle.\n\nA final strike. My body convulses and I fall, the energy is too much. TOO MUCH! I only see blinding white and agony. My throat raw from screaming but I need to hold on. I need to do it.\n\n\"I SUMMON THE DEAD!\" I beseech the storm, and outstretch my hand.\n\nLightning connects my fingertips into the heavens and for just a moment the whole world is silent. I feel an ache. I can't stand. I feel death's approach.\n\nLightning strikes nearby and I register the thunder, as I attempt to roll onto my side. Screams sound another has found the Earth. I cry out in pain as my hand slips on the rain-slicked stones and I tumble back into a clump. I feel footsteps and my darling Yvette hauls me to stand under her shoulder. She had stayed below, despite my warnings. As always.\n\nWithout word nor motion, she brings me to the ledge and allows me to view the fields and chaos.\n\nMore bodies are standing, but oddly, while others are running.\n\nI raise my hand partway.\n\n\"My army of the dead.\" I whisper, clinging to my darling Yvette. She grips my hand and holds it out straight. She never learned my arts, but she understands what I attempt. I repeat myself after her help. \"My... army... of the dead.\"\n\nHalf of the remaining townspeople below stand at rapt attention, despite the typhoon, unbothered by the weather or their own decay. They hear me whether I whisper or shout.\n\n\"Kill the vampire.\"\n\nThey stay still. Staring at me and Yvette. No, no, they should have marched off. Marched to his doom. Why...?\n\nA lightning flash turns to horror in my heart and I raise my eyes to see a face of fury and disgust above me. Skin as pale as silk with a cloak of pitch black twisting in the chaotic winds. His clothes befitting the noble birth he has seized. \n\n\"You have made a *grave* error.\" A furious whisper seemed to chill all the blood in our veins. \"Did you think these creatures could end me? Did you think I would fear their mindless attempts?\" I clung to Yvette who stood gripping me as my body attempted to join the dead.\n\nAs if to prove his point, the fanged man swung low and reappeared above us all holding the skeleton of a young man. Decay having stolen his skin, the vampire his chance to grow tall. In death, and by my magic, he clawed at the monster holding him. Attempting to reclaim an ounce of the life that had been ripped from his veins. And in an instant, his skull was crushed. With each hand, the vampire crushed the spine, the collar, the shoulders, the arms, on and on until nothing but dust remained. \n\n\"You will *suffer*, mage. You could have served and lived a good life. An eternal life.\" \n\n\"It would not have been a good life.\" I hear Yvette answer in my stead. I feel the wind and I collapse, Yvette is gone and floating above me, her neck held in the vampire's hands. \"Look at me, fool. Beg her forgiveness for your folly.\"\n\n\"It... it is okay, my love.\" Yvette struggles to say, holding onto the iron arm of the undead king. \"You... always tried to do things on your own.\"\n\n\"I'm... I'm so... I...\" tears are in my eyes, stolen by the falling rain. \"YVETTE!\" I scream as I struggle to lift my head to see her.\n\n\"My flaw... is to rely on others.\" I hear her.\n\nSuddenly she falls and the vampire king turns to catch clouds of wooden stakes. I hear Yvette cry out and I see her bleeding near me. I try to crawl to her, but she is already standing. Rushing to me. I see. My darling Yvette. While I toiled with the dead. You toiled with the living. She grabs my cloak and flings us both off the tower into the crushing arms of the dead. The living hide between, holding weapons and firing, disappearing into the horde. \n\nI see the vampire above shudder as a single bolt pierces his leg, but he can not see its source in the rain and through my horde. My Yvette's army. Our war is far from over."
