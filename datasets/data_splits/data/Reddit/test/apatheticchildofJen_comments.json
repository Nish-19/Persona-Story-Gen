        "writing_prompt": "The prophecy foretold that The Great Evil would awaken 1000 years after his original defeat. As it turns out, the people took this very seriously, so when he awakened, he was met with an army of blessed knights, an evil containment system, and two dozen automated holy turrets aimed at him.",
        "story": "Now, you may think this is weird, right? I mean, humans taking a threat in the far future seriously enough to not only keep the story alive for the entire thousand years, but to also temporarily unite under a single banner to amass a military capable of stopping the Great Evil\u2019s rise? That\u2019s practically unheard of. But there was one major factor here. That prophecy wasn\u2019t the only one. It was part of a book of a thousand prophecies. One prophecy every year until the Great Evil rose. So naturally, when the kingdoms realised the 100% accuracy of the prophecies, which took an embarrassingly long time, they started preparing for each prophecy as they came, hoping to use each on to their full advantage, or suffer as little as possible from each prophecy. And then over the thousand years it just became tradition, preparing for each prophecy. So preparing for this prophecy was just par for the course.\n\nI joined the military when most people did, as my kingdom started the draft in preparation. We were some of the first to start preparing, so the other kingdoms had to catch up. Then it became a race to get the magic, technology and resources to defeat the great evil. It didn\u2019t much effect me, I just trained with my lance and shield all day, every day, for about 3 years. When the day came, we marched on the mountain. Almost 100,000 men, mages and engineers. Fortresses, trenched and siege equipment were prepped and we stood in lines, side by side with soldiers who, on any other day, would be our enemy.\n\nAnd now here I am, looking at the huge metal door that, over the thousand years, had been slowly rusting away. Despite our preparations, nervousness is still apparent in the entire line. With each bang of the thing trying to get out, the line shifts and nobles call out to keep us in formation. Large cracks start to form across the door as I hear the holy turrets charge up. The holy knights in reserve and on our flanks make clanking noises as they stretch and warm up.\n\nFinally, with one last crash, the doors come tumbling down and the Great Evil emerges.\n\nIt is difficult to describe the look on its face, as the beast is more of a huge shadowy cloud rather than possessing any recognisable features. But if I were to name it, I\u2019d have to say it\u2019s surprise.\nThe holy turrets open fire on the beast, drawing its attention as the armies of evil pour out of the door and through its legs.\n\nThe nobles and knights around us shout commands.\n\n\u201cPRESENT ARMS! ADVANCE!\u201d I repeat the commands, sending it down the line as I move to meet the horde.\n\nThe horde charges with no semblance of order, resulting in the first wave practically impaling themselves upon our lances and spears and the following waves being vulnerable from the sides. Blood splatters across my shield as I stab forward again and again, leaving a pile of bodies in front of us. We try to keep advancing, but the Great Evil has other plans. Between volleys from the holy turrets, catapults and ballistas, it swings at our lines, carving large holes in them. Holy knights move in to plug the gaps as the horde attempts to break through.\n\nThe more of the horde we kill, the more bodies pile up, making me stumble as we attempt to fight our way forwards.\nBefore I even know what\u2019s happened, a huge black cloud crashes through our ranks, sending me stumbling to the floor. The Great Evil\u2019s foot was right where I had once been, blocking the Holy knights from plugging the gap and leaving us scattered soldiers alone with the horde. I ditch my lance for the more manoeuvrable club and start fighting for my life. I battle my way through the horde, meeting up with a few spearmen and others like me, using shields and clubs. Together we form our own mini line, facing the horde as one. Despite being surrounded, we fight off the disorganised horde, backing up to rejoin the battle line on either side of the Great Evil\u2019s foot.\n\nA series of loud explosions ring out and a dark cloud passes over us. Just in time we dive out the way, though not all of us made it. The Great Evil stumbles back as holy knights rush to fill the gap in the line and assist those like us, trapped in front. A huge knight, like almost 7 foot and biceps as big as my head, runs up to us. She picks us up and straightens us out shouting over the din of the battle. \u201cWITH ME!\u201d We move with her, back towards the lines of holy knights as other scattered soldiers rally to us, by the time we rejoin the line, almost a hundred of us had rallied and the holy knights expertly rearrange their formation to fit us in.\n\nThen a call comes down the line. \u201cADVANCE!\u201d I repeat the call and start moving with my comrades, cutting down thousands of evil forces as we move forward, the Great Evil struggling under the pummelling of the holy turrets, catapults etc.\n\nFinally, the beast falls to the ground. The 5 mages destined to finally slay the Great Evil run forward and we move to cover them.\n\nOne particularly huge soldier charges towards our line. The archers attempt to fell the beast, but to know avail as it crashes straight into our line, impaling itself on our spears and lances but not falling. It throws me across the battlefield and I fall unconscious.\n\n\nI shoot up, looking around me for danger. I\u2019m in a large white tent, beds lining each side full of other people. Many are wearing bandages, like one I realise I have around my head. I teach up and touch to side of my head, hissing in pain. A nurse walks in and smiles.\n\u201cAh, you\u2019re awake. How\u2019re you feeling?\u201d\n\nI shrug. \u201cFine, I think. What happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got thrown by a troll. Most people that happens to are unconscious at least a week, you wear only a couple days.\u201d\n\n\u201cLucky me,\u201d I mutter. \u201cWhat about the battle?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we won that. As you might be able to tell from the fact we aren\u2019t dead. The chosen 5 killed the evil and the united armies slaughtered the army of the damned. Now everything can go back to as it was before.\u201d\n\nI slump back in my bed. \u2018As it was before.\u2019\n\n\u201cDoes that mean the kingdoms are still rivals?\u201d\n\nThe nurse shrugs as she walks out.\nThe army starts moving out a few days later and, by the time we make it home a few days after that, I\u2019ve been discharged by the medics. I immediately return home to my farm, thanking the stars that I am alive and embracing my wife and child."

        "writing_prompt": "Years ago, you donated your \u201cgenetic material\u201d to a secret organization in exchange for $30 million. Now, years later, there\u2019s a knock on your door, and you find yourself face-to-face with a group of superpowered teenagers claiming you\u2019re their father.",
        "story": "$30 million for my DNA? Of course I took that deal. I could put just $2 million in the bank and live off the interest, $30 million would set me up for life, and my children, and my children\u2019s children and, if we invested smartly, they\u2019re children too. You may think that was crazy and really shady, which was my thought too, but it was all legit. The doctor was genuine, the contract official and the government agent who greeted me too. They said I appeared to be the \u201cideal subject\u201d for their experiments. So a blood donation, cheek swab and\u2026 ahem other donation later and I was $30 million richer, well actually they gave me quite a bit more. Went back to Britain and lived my life normally, well I did once I explained to the fraud investigators where I\u2019d got the money from and paid my taxes for the massive income, putting me down to exactly $30 million or \u00a323,653,350.\n\nI hired a financial advisor and invested the money smartly. I paid off the mortgage, my student debt and the huge list of other debts I had to pay, barely made a dent. Then I got the teaching job I\u2019d always wanted. Money was no longer an issue, I simply took some of the interest of my investments and used it to supplement my income. Life was good, didn\u2019t really tell anyone about my good fortune, but close friends and family always got good gifts on birthdays and Christmas. I found a wife, got a couple of children, biological and adopted. I\u2019d say I almost forgot the incident, but it\u2019s hard to forgot the thing that is funding your lifestyle.\n\nAbout 20 years passed before the consequences showed up at my front door, literally and figuratively. I was home sick with a bug I\u2019m pretty sure my daughters brought home and waiting for the microwave to finish with my soup when a knock on the door sounded through the house. Despite having no reason to, I had a bad feeling about it, so bad I ended up picking up one of the kitchen knives as I made my way to the door, opening the door just a crack, bracing it against my foot and peaking through.\n\nA small gaggle of teenagers stood on the doorstep. They looked normal enough, wearing your standard teenage clothes. The youngest, maybe 12, wore a pink top with those sequins that made a different image depending if the sequins were pushed up and down. She was looking at it in awe and wonder as she cycled between the pony and castle. Then there was a maybe 14 year old who wore a tracksuit and joggers, looking like your typical chav. A 15 year old with a flowery dress and a jacket over the top and mismatched socks with her sandals and finally an 18 year old with smart trousers and a standard blue striped T-shirt with waistcoat stood at the front, smiling at me. Their clothes were a tad mismatched at times but they looked normal enough. I started to feel a little silly about bringing a knife before I noticed the tags and security tags still on their clothes. They were clearly thieves, so what were they doing here? My intrusive thoughts took over as I scanned for weapons, but found none as the 18 year old spoke.\n\n\u201cH-hello,\u201d he said nervously, \u201cthis is going to sound crazy, but in your son.\u201d\n\nI raised my eyebrow at him. \u201cNo you aren\u2019t. I haven\u2019t had sex with anyone except my wife. And I definitely haven\u2019t donated\u2026\u201d I froze, remembering when I donated my DNA. I looked at them closely and recognised a lot of my features in them, the blonde slightly curly hair, except for the 12 year old who\u2019s hair was blue and pink, the blue eyes and the oh so recognisable bump on the bridge of their nose that my mother had given me.\n\nThe 18 year old nodded. \u201cYes, we\u2019re your children.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou get my ADHD?\u201d\n\nThe kid shook his head. \u201cNo, we got autism.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d I had needed to test them, in case they were lying, \u201ccome on in.\u201d I opened the door wider and beckoned them in.\n\n\n\n\\n\\nThey followed me to the kitchen where I kept microwaving my soup and collapsed into the chair, even the small exertion of standing in the doorway wiping me out with my illness.\n\n\u201cSo, why would the American government want to make children with my DNA?\u201d\n\nThe kids all moved awkwardly to take different spaces in the kitchen. The 14 year old hopped up on the worktop while the 15 year old started rooting through the cupboards.\n\n\u201cUh, not exactly.\u201d The 18 year old said. \u201cThey wanted to make soldiers.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoldiers?\u201d My blood ran cold at the thought. \u201cAnd why would I be the \u2018perfect candidate?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo physical conditions of any kind, you were a \u2018blank slate\u2019.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure how to feel about that, was it a compliment? But that wasn\u2019t important at the moment.\n\nI scowled. \u201cAnd you\u2019re their \u2018soldiers\u2019. Children.\u201d\n\nThe 18 year old nodded, holding out his hand a conjuring a small flame in it. I almost fell out of my chair in shock as the flame appeared. The 15 year old slapped the 18 year old, who looked sheepish.\n\n\u201cWay to ease him into it,\u201d she told him off.\n\nI pointed to the flame. \u201cHow the Heck did you do that?!\u201d\n\nThe flame vanished as the 18 year old held his hands up placatingly. \u201cThe government wanted more than soldier, they wanted super soldiers. So the experimented with your DNA. I was their first success. My body naturally produces several flammable substances, liquid and gas, and I can release and ignite them. My skin is also naturally more fireproof.\u201d\n\nI was still staring in shock at his hands where the flame had been. I nodded slowly. \u201cOk,\u201d is all I can manage.\n\nThe 18 year old points to the 15 year old. \u201cThis is Bonnie. Biologically augmented nano n___ intervention environment. Or Bonnie for short. A bunch of nanobots in her body can alter her body physically to overcome most challenges. Increased strength, intelligence, seeing in various spectrums, water breathing anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAugmented doesn\u2019t start with an O.\u201d\n\nBonnie gives a shrug. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that when I chose the name, I thought it did, due to the \u2018or\u2019 sound.\u201d\n\nThe 14 year old steps forward. \u201cThe names Ex, my brain is quantumly linked with a quantum computer. If we were in a film, I\u2019d be the tech guy. Super smart, super fast thinking, can use the computer to hack any device.\u201d\n\nI nod. You\u2019d expect me to be even more surprised, but there\u2019s only so much surprise one man can have, and then it just reaches blind acceptance. \u201cAnd how\u2019d you get the name Ex?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe scientists always said that I was simply a part of the computer, an extension of it, so they,\u201d he pointed to the other kids, \u201cstarted calling me Ex.\u201d Finally I turn to the 12 year old girl. \u201cAnd you sweetie?\u201d\n\nShe looked to the other kids before standing straight and saying \u201cI\u2019m violet and I can change what I look like.\u201d Her hair then changed from pink and blue to bright red and then to blond, looking just like my own. She smiled at me with crooked teeth and I smiled back.\n\n\u201cOh that was wonderful. And how\u2019d you get your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy favourite colour is violet.\u201d Her skin then changed to match that colour.\n\nTurning towards the 18 year old I asked, \u201cdidn\u2019t catch your name, what is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cBlaze,\u201d he answered.\n\nI nodded, the reason seemed obvious.\n\nI made them a simple lunch, cooking up the rest of the soup before giving them juice and brownies for pudding.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re running from the government, you can\u2019t stay here long.\u201d They nodded solemnly, except for violet who just looked disappointed. \u201cI can get you food, clothes that\u2019ll stick out less and transport. I can also give you some money to keep you going.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t ask you to do that, that would be so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got \u00a324 million from donating my DNA. Money that I planned to pass down to my kids and their kids. Far as I\u2019m concerned, that money\u2019s just as much yours as it is mine.\u201d\n\nAnd so, without giving them room to refuse, I bought a second hand car that someone was selling on the street, a couple months worth of imperishable food, new clothes and then gave them \u00a310,000 and the best tips and tricks to save money I know. And with that they hugged me goodbye and left.\n\nBarely two days later, two black trucks appeared outside my door and a team of troops emerged. The almost pounded my door down before I answered, as my wife kept our children back.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYour children, where are they?!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want with my children? What\u2019ve they done? They\u2019re good kids! Go to school!-\u201c\n\n\u201cNot those kids!\u201d\n\nI furrowed my eyebrows. \u201cI don\u2019t have any other kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know they visited you! Where did they go?!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about! I don\u2019t have any other kids! I haven\u2019t even had another partner!\u201d\n\nA woman in a black suit walked up to the door, commanding the soldiers to stand down. \u201cWe know you know, we tracked them here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kids are you talking about?\u201d I repeated, playing my best furiously confused civilian.\n\n\u201cAnswer our questions or we\u2019ll take these kids instead.\u201d\n\nI growled and glared at them with the fury I\u2019d never felt before. \u201cDo not touch my kids. Any of them. I don\u2019t know where they went, I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to ask. There\u2019s nothing I can tell you that can help.\u201d The woman held my gaze for a moment before nodding.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s telling the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd before you attempt to arrest me to lure those children you experimented on to turn into soldiers, this is being recorded and, if I don\u2019t stop it, it will automatically be uploaded to the internet.\u201d I warned. We held each others\u2019 gaze for half a minute at least before she backed down.\n\n\u201cMove out. They aren\u2019t here.\u201d I slammed the front door and collapsed to the ground, shaking from the adrenaline.My family ran up to me and we embraced.\n\nMy kids will be fine, I have confidence in them. That\u2019s what I tell myself every night before I go to sleep.\n\n\n\n"

        "writing_prompt": "Today you just found out your roommate with strange hobbies, like knowing how to pick a lock, knows how every puzzle and cipher by heart, or how to commit tax fraud, and so many other things, wasn't a guy with ADHD, he was an ex-assassin and now you have a gun pointed at your face",
        "story": "\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d I told the man desperately. \u201cMy roommate is just a normal guy, you know?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t believe me! Just tell me where he is!\u201d The strange man shouted, sending spit flying at my face as he did.\n\u201cFine. He\u2019s at work, the local Lidl,\u201d I answered, hoping he\u2019ll believe me.\n\u201cAre you stupid?! If I can track down his house I can track down his work. And he\u2019s not there!\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s where he said he\u2019d. If he\u2019s not there, then I don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\nThe man narrowed his eyes at me before lowering his gun. \u201cHe must\u2019ve known I was coming, made a break for it.\u201d As he left, he put his finger to his ear and spoke into what I assumed was a radio. As soon as the door closed, I ran into my roommates bedroom to dig out he secret stash. I\u2019d already found it while cleaning a couple months ago, but hadn\u2019t opened it, figuring it was a disaster survival pack or something, but with the new revelations, I had other ideas. I went to the floorboards and lifted them up to find a puzzle box that I already solved the first time I found it, so quickly solved again to pull out a bag.\n\nAnd viola, money, fake identities and, most importantly, a burner phone. I dialled my friend\u2019s number and waited. Once he answered I didn\u2019t give him time for his usual greetings.\n\n\u201cSome guy is looking for you. I don\u2019t know who, but I know it\u2019s something to do with your assassin days.\u201d I hear a curse and then he starts to talk to justify but I cut him off. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to explain yourself, I know who you are now, I don\u2019t care who you were. What do you need?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat grab bag, take it to where I had my first birthday party.\u201d With that, he hung up. I furrowed my eyebrows. He\u2019d always told me he hadn\u2019t had a birthday party. So if it hadn\u2019t happened, it didn\u2019t happen anywhere, it happened nowhere. Ohhhh, I got it.\n\n30 minutes later, I found myself outside a pub a few miles outside of town. Normally you could get there in half the time, but I had to make sure I wasn\u2019t being followed. The pub was called Nowhere, people said it was because you could say to your spouse you were going \u2018nowhere\u2019 when they asked and not technically be lying.\n\nI handed my friend the bag, filled with some chocolate as an added treat before saying goodbye.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll miss you. Don\u2019t think the next roommate could replace you.\u201d But instead of agreeing, he shook his head.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be having another roommate. As long as they\u2019re coming after me, you\u2019re in danger. Go to this address,\u201d he handed me a small slip of paper, \u201cit\u2019s a safe house, you\u2019ll be safe there.\u201d\n\nNormally I\u2019d be disagreeing, I had a life and a job and family here, but being held at gunpoint still had me shaken, so I just nodded and we parted ways.\n\nI drove straight home, packing up quickly what I could and talking with the landlord. I told him I\u2019d recently inherited a house that came ready furnished, so I\u2019d be willing to sell him the furniture so he could rent the room as pre furnished. We came to a deal quickly and I walked away with some extra money in my account, that I immediately drained before driving.\n\nI didn\u2019t stop driving for almost 6 hours, not even for a toilet break, until I finally reached the address, somewhere in the middle of Scotland.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a modest house. 3 stories, as wide as my block of flats and a huge garden that I\u2019d have to measure in acres rather than metres.\n\nThe cupboards were wet stocked with non-perishables and a large amount of money, so I knew food wouldn\u2019t be an issue for a while. So I unpacked and settled into my new home, looking at the landline, wondering when the call would come in that I could go home."

I barely have time to breath a sigh of relief before the panic comes back at the sight of my friend having a panic attack on the floor, in the form of a parrot.

Feathers.\u201d\n\n\u201c2 things you can smell.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou. Bleach.\u201d I nod to him, smiling\n\n\u201cAnd one thing you can taste.\u201d I see something almost like mischief in the parrots eyes as it licks me. I let go quickly and the parrot flies onto my knee, laughing.\n\n\u201cYou.\u201d\n\nI chuckle along with it. \u201cFeeling better?\u201d My friend nodded, so I continue. \u201cSo what\u2019s up? What happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember me. I can\u2019t remember how to turn back.\u201d\n\nI frown. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember who I am. Where I end and the animals begin.\u201d\n\nI lift my friend up close to me. \u201cYou need a picture?\u201d\n\nMy friend shakes his head. \u201cDidn\u2019t work. I can\u2019t connect with my human form. What if\u2026 I\u2019m just not human enough anymore?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t connect with who you are?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo much has changed. New house, new job, my\u2026 mother. What if I\u2019m not the same?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne minute.\u201d I run up his stairs, running back down a couple minutes later with a photo album.\n\n\u201cI said that didn\u2019t help.\u201d\n\n\u201cBear with me,\u201d I tell him before opening at the first page, him in his mother\u2019s arms for the first time a week after his birth. \u201cYou remember your birth story? Your mother had to walk 2 hours from her hike to the nearest hospital. You were dangerously premature so were immediately c-sectioned. Your mum didn\u2019t even get to see you \u2018till the next day and couldn\u2019t hold you a week after that. They didn\u2019t take picture of you until that point because they said they\u2019d remember every second of that well enough that they wouldn\u2019t need a photo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that story, it\u2019s my own birth.\u201d\n\nI ignored him and kept talking, flipping a couple pages to him right after learning to walk at his dad\u2019s funeral. \u201cAnd your father died before you knew him. Killed in a hit and run. You were too young to understand, they had to close the casket because you kept trying to climb in with him. You then complained, worried he would be unhappy when he woke up as they buried them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for the reminder.\u201d\n\nI turned to when he was four, the first photo of the two of us. \u201cWhen we first met you were pretending to be a snake in the sand pit and we started playing. My mother was horrified, so you turned back to comfort her. Did not work. Took her 2 years to finally become comfortable around you. And you got grounded for revealing your secret so easily.\u201d I look to another photo on the same page of my friend in a tuxedo. \u201cAnd your mum got married to Dave. Wonderful guy. Took you a while to accept him. You finally when he played with you unknowingly while you were a dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know all this. You\u2019re just telling me my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur first day at school was crazy. We were sat on opposite sides of the class so you\u2019d \u2019go to the toilet\u2019 then sneak back in as a bug to spend time with me. The teachers had your parents take you to the doctors to get your bowels checked.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for bringing up that embarrassing memory.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour 6th birthday remains the best birthday party ever. Dave tried to bake a cake. It ended up the ugliest thing in the world but best tasting cake. We went to a water park with everyone in our class. You turned into a fish to scare and gaslight the other kids. We tricked Adam into thinking you were a mermaid,\u201d I chuckled at the memory and so did my friend.\n\n\u201cYou in high school was so cringy. You were trying to be edgy so hard and failed.\u201d I turned to a photo of him with a black wig that was worn very badly and rather hideous black clothes with 2 badges on and that\u2019s all. \u201cWhile you did that I became the teachers\u2019 favourite student and everyone was so surprised we were friends, but I got you out of so much trouble by vouching for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe tried to start a board games club together. Only one other guy showed up and he turned out to be an incel. So it was just us, playing board games every Monday. I always looked forward to that day. Everyone thought I was weird for loving Monday, but it was because I got to play with you. Then we immediately joined the board games club in college. And that was a disaster. We were both the worst in the club, competed for not getting last place. Remember that time we teamed up against one guy in risk and we still lost?\u201d My friend nods.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of all this?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe point is to remind you. You were not the same person throughout all that, you were mischievous as a child, wannabe edgy in high school and we were both finally discovering ourselves in college. And then Uni we were apart except for the holidays but you did change, became more confident and sure of yourself. But every time, despite changing, you were still able to shapeshift. It\u2019s not about if you\u2019d changed, because you\u2019ve always been changing. You forgot who you are but let me remind you. You are kind and mischievous and silly. You often present a false appearance to the outside world in more than just your shapeshifting, especially with strangers, but in company you are the most genuine and confident person I know. You are who you are now, but if you don\u2019t know who that is, you are also the result of everything you were. Remember who you were, everything you were and keep moving forward through the years and you\u2019ll remember who you are.\u201d\n\nMy friend takes a deep breath and starts to change. I quickly put him down and back away as my friend is standing in front of me agajn"
