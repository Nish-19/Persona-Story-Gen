        "story": "*\u201cI just finished the autopsy of your stab victim that you found in the street. He wasn\u2019t just stabbed multiple times, we have over 100 wounds from at least a dozen different edged weapons. He got the Julius Caesar or somebody really malicious. Just be careful canvasing the area.\u201d*\n\n\nBoth of them glanced at each other, then at their surroundings. Topher grabbed the phone up before Hamilton could.\n\n\n\n\"I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?\"\n\n\n*\"Unless their killer had a lot of time on their hands. Multiple attackers stabbed him to death. Again, be careful.\"*\n\n\n\"Understood. Contact Bellamy. Tell him to send an extra unit down here. We'll get started.\"\n\n\n\n*\"Sure thing.\"*\n\n\nBoth of them began looking around in earnest. There were still signs of the first responders that cordoned off the scene. The big question was how no one else noticed what had happened.\n\n\nThe body was laying in the street next to a vacant lot. But behind that sat a refinery practically on top of the fence at the back of it.\n\n\nAcross the road, several businesses that closed earlier in the evening. Down the block, an apartment building that had balconies that overlooked the road. All of the street lights worked.\n\n\n\"Did they dump the body here?\" Topher asked as he circled where the body had laid at.\n\n\n\"I can't rule it out.\" Hamilton agreed. \"But if they did, where'd they kill him at in the first place?\"\n\n\n\"Maybe a house. Maybe an apartment.\" Topher took a glance at the nearest one. The same one overlooking the street.\n\n\nBoth of them walked around the car and shined flashlights on the lot. The grass was shin high. And there were a few pieces of junk and trash strewn around.\n\n\n\n\"Odd thing is.\" Hamilton reconsidered. \"Report came back that he'd been killed recently. Considering the photos.\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, they killed him right here. Or really close by.\" Topher confirmed. The pair of them kept looking at the dirt.\n\n\n\n\"Hey. Look at this here.\"\n\n\n\nHamilton careful walked through the weeds towards Topher's position. He held the light up at shoulder height and waved it a little.\n\n\nThe lot was full of glass. Shattered glass that scattered a few feet before a small pile of it. Near it some grooves in the dirt, the weeds crushed and ripped away as they went back towards the sidewalk.\n\n\n\n\"Did somebody run a car up here?\" Topher asked him.\n\n\n\"Or they drove one away.\" Hamilton agreed.\n\n\n\"Think a camera caught anything?\"\n\n\n\"Good chance. It's not like we're out in the sticks exactly.\"\n\n\n\"Guy gets stabbed to death in the middle of the street. By a dozen people.\" Topher summarized again.\n\n\nHamilton was busy squinting past him. He raised his flashlight and Topher turned to look. Somebody in a light colored jacket was looking at their patrol car. Hamilton tapped his arm, and the pair began to walk through the weeds towards them.\n\n\n\"Lights off.\" Topher muttered.\n\n\n\nAs they came closer to the sidewalk, Hamilton decided to speak first.\n\n\n\"Hey, you. Police. Show me your hands.\"\n\n\n\nThe figure turned away from the car and began walking. The hood over their head unmoving as they strolled across the road and between the buildings that lined that side. The pair of them picked up their pace to catch up to the figure.\n\n\n\n\"Hey. Stop. I said stop.\"\n\n\n\nThe figure met the tiny gap between the buildings. No wider than a foot at most. Turned sideways misstep. And slid into the dark like it was a normal thing to do.\n\n\n\"Grab him!\"\n\n\nTopher tried and put his light up to the gap as he reached to do so.\n\n\nOnly for his hand to hit a small chain link fence across the gap. The person was nowhere to be seen.\n\n\n\"Where'd he go?\" Topher asked him. Hamilton was speechless himself. He walked over and checked the fence and kicked it just to be sure.\n\n\n\"The hell?\"\n\n\n\nBoth of them went back to the squad car. Nothing was out of place. They got back in and began to circle the block.\n\n\n\"How'd they do that?\"\n\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\n\"They have to come out somewhere.\" He snatched the radio up as they both watched the sides of the roads as Hamilton reached the corner and turned left.\n\n\n\n\"Call it in?\" Topher asked him next.\n\n\n\n\"Wait, wait...\"\n\n\nThey both glanced at the low buildings on this side of the block. To their concern, nobody came out of the gaps between them.\n\n\nHamilton didn't touch the gas. He just let the car roll as they kept the windows down and listened.\n\n\n\"Look.\" Topher flinched. \"Look!\"\n\n\n\"What? What?\"\n\n\nHamilton stopped the car at the next intersection, and then flicked the brights on. Just off the road, laid over the curb was a body.\n\n\nThe same light colored jacket that they saw moments earlier. Even under the streetlights, they could see the dark pattern spreading outward. Both exited the car, weapons drawn and slowly advanced.\n\n\n\"Hey... Hey, can you hear us? Sir?\"\n\n\nThe man was dead already. A series of punctures had turned the jacket from an off-white to a deep red color. The same hue staining the concrete underneath. Under the light they both spotted the awful gash crossing the body's neck. Topher almost sunk his fingers into the wound going for a pulse.\n\n\n\nThe first question was 'how?' The second was 'when?' The third was 'who?'\n\n\n\"334, dispatch.\" Hamilton radioed. \"We have a body on the 1100 block of... Walker Street. And 15th.\"\n\n\n*\"Roger, 334, units on the way.\"*\n\n\n\"What do make of that?\" Topher asked next.\n\n\n\"I called it in.\"\n\n\n\"No.\" Topher pointed in concern. \"That.\"\n\n\nOn the sidewalk, next to the body, was an arrow. It pointed down the road. It was made of the same blood pooling on the pavement."

        "story": "\"You fight the land. Why?\"\n\n\nHe asked the traveler. A despondent look across his face. \"Why?\"\n\n\nThe younger man simply pushed\u00a0himself a bit off the bed to look at him. The wraps covering his wounds stretching at the effort.\n\n\n\"Have to.\" He grimaced. \"Have to survive somehow.\"\n\n\nThe ears twitched at this. The elf running a hand over his beard.\n\n\n\"I'll never understand it.\" He remarked. \"Mortals. You can't comprehend magick like us. You can only use your might and your mind.\"\n\n\nHe stood and took stock of the odd items littering the table nearby. A leather pouch\u00a0full of odd paper and some odd bendy cards. The strangest playing cards Aristeinn had ever seen.\n\n\nA headpiece similar to what a paladin or knight would wear. But it was smooth. Light. Like no metal he'd expect. A colorful design circling the edges. A ring of keys, of which he couldn't begin to guess unlocked.\n\n\n\nTwo small handheld devices. Some tome of some sort? Aristeinn ran his hand over the odd symbols dotting raised lumps.\n\n\n\"No-ki-a?\" He asked over his shoulder. \"Is that your name?\"\n\n\n\"...No.\"\n\n\nAnd the last item, it was a handle, seemingly for a knife. But there was no blade. Until he poked the small latch he found and a blade sprang free from the handle.\n\n\n\"Interesting!\" Aristeinn remarked. \"I must say. You are a troubled lot. Always attacking our realm. But I must say, the craftsmanship is quite impressive.\"\n\n\nHe approached with the knife. The traveler wary of it for some reason. But he sat it in an open palm of theirs. Waiting until the young man worked the action and slowly closed the knife against a thigh.\n\n\n\"Why have you cut such paths that separate our worlds apart? How?\"\n\n\n\"Paths?\" The traveler spoke. \"What paths?\"\n\n\n\"Our land, our home. It shrinks by the day, it seems. To you, it might be a lifetime.\" Aristeinn explained. \"But to me. It was like last night. This forest. The land. It stretched forever.\"\n\n\nMarco eyed the pair of men outside the door. Swords at their sides. A lack of emotion in their faces.\n\n\n\"But, I've seen glimpse of the next world.\" Aristeinn carried on. \"The world linked to ours. How much you've claimed. How much you've uprooted.\"\n\n\n\"And?\" Marco urged carefully.\n\n\n\"What does defeating nature so harshly serve such men?\"\n\n\nThe elf seemed disturbed in his findings. Another kingdom so populated, yet so hauntingly distorted.\n\n\n\n\"...Well, I guess that's an age old question isn't it?\" Marco answered. His ribs still ached. \"I never thought of it. You see it as something new. It's been there forever to me.\"\n\n\n\nHe gave life to the idea. \"I'm used to it.\"\n\n\n\"Was it always like this?\"\n\n\n\"No. But that's how it is.\"\n\n\n\"You may serve your king as you wish.\" Aristeinn warned. \"But here, we rule with impunity. It'd be wise to show our woods respect. Or else.\"\n\n\n\"I can barely move.\" Marco muttered. \"It's not like I'm going anywhere anytime soon.\"\n\n\nWith that the elf stood and went back to the door. A weary look on his face.\n\n\n\n\"Very well.\" He sneered. \"Nirmala, you can keep this guest until he heals. But he is to be removed as soon as able.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, your majesty.\"\n\n\n---\n\n\nThe pair of them stared at the trees as they walked.\n\n\n\"...Shay, maybe he's dead up in here.\"\n\n\n\"He's not dead. I'm telling you.\"\n\n\nA tug on his shoulder caused him to look at the face in the dimming sunlight.\n\n\n\n\"You saw the wreck.\" Aurelio remarked as he messed with his bag. \"It looks like-\"\n\n\n\"If he's dead. Rillo?\" Shay waved the light like a fist, \"Where's the body?\""

        "story": "The sun shone brightly. The heat visible in the air even at midday. The temperature heading toward a local record.\n\n\nAn average summer day in such a place really.\n\n\nSo, of course, people are confused by the people walking around in coats, jeans, and heavy shoes. The hoods pulled tightly around their heads.\n\n\nNobody seemed to notice the slight moisture pooling with each step.\n\n\n\"They're all dead.\" One sighed softly. \"They're all deadd...\"\n\n\n\"Stop saying that.\"\n\n\nThe pair entered the small path towards the house. The walls closing in as they avoided the small piles of trash scattered on either side. The smell reminding them not of disgust. But the idea they still had time left.\n\n\n\n\"We're next.\"\n\n\n\"Kayla. Stop saying that.\"\n\n\nShe stopped moving entirely. Jeff stopped to check on her. He noticed the blood slightly gathering next to her legs. He made her look at him. Some of the skin above an eye had rubbed away. The raw underside a pink hue that flecked with red drips.\n\n\n\"Listen. I... We can fix this.\"\n\n\n\"Uh huh.\" She slowly answered. \"Right.\"\n\n\n\"Trust me.\" Jeff offered. Something seemed to land on his head. He brushed it thinking it to be a bug.\n\n\nSomething wet fell out of his hood and hit the pavement with a slight slap. The pair of them numbly stared at it longer than they thought.\n\n\nIt was his ear.\n\n\nHe gingerly leaned down and picked it up. Rubbing it on his sleeve to get the dirt off, he ignored the smear of red and put it in a pocket.\n\n\n\"Come on.\" He sighed. \"Not much farther.\"\n\n\nThe pair slowly climbed the stairs. The skin of their hands wanting to rip every time they had to touch a railing for support.\n\n\nThe woman in question supposedly lived at the top of the hill. The top of this dilapidated neighborhood. At the top of the hill. The hill may as well have been a mountain. They could see the whole beach from this place. And the city that stretched beyond the curve of the land. The ocean the cut off point of some great construction.\n\n\nJeff stopped. His hands aching. Kayla bumped into him and staggered herself.\n\n\n\"What?\" She asked. Wiping blood with her sleeve.\n\n\n\"I always wanted to come here.\" He breathed. \"Get some sun. Get away from it all.\"\n\n\n\"Careful what you wish for.\" She uttered.\n\n\nHe turned to look at her and gasped as part of his palm slid off. The flesh dangling on a slight peel in the paint on the rail. He reached to retrieve it, but winced and withdrew as he realized it was the same hand he tried to grab it with.\n\n\n\"Hurry.\" Kayla motioned. \"Hurry.\"\n\n\nThe small house sat in a dip on the slope. The treeline above it making it seem like the jungle had given it just enough room to be set there.\n\n\nAnd there the old woman sat.\n\n\n\"Ah. You finally found me.\" She greeted in a half hearted tone. \"Have you enjoyed your stay?\"\n\n\nShe waved a fan in front of herself. As if she was simply enjoying a breeze all to herself.\n\n\n\"I'd offer you a seat. But I imagine it wouldn't be wise.\"\n\n\n\"You have the cure for this?\" Jeff led with.\n\n\n\"Ay, I may.\" She smiled. \"But, I want to hear it first.\"\n\n\n\"...Hear what?\" Jeff asked her after several seconds of silence.\n\n\nThe birds sang in the trees. Audible even over the drone of civilization.\n\n\n\"An apology.\" The woman reminded them.\n\n\n\"We're sorry.\" Kayla spoke first. \"I don't know. What the others did.\"\n\n\nHer legs shook as she tried to step closer. The woman watched from her chair in interest.\n\n\n\"I don't know what they did.\" Kayla regrouped. \"But it... Wasn't worth...\"\n\n\nShe hit the dirt face first. Jeff tried his best to lean down and rouse her.\n\n\n\"Kayla?\" He whispered. \"Kayla??\"\n\n\nHe pushed her the best he could. Ignoring the skin further sliding on his hands. The bones poking through. The hit had taken some more off her face. She blinked with one eye and tried to breathe.\n\n\n\"Help her.\" Jeff ordered finally. \"Please.\"\n\n\n\"I've lived here. All my life.\" The old woman sat back. \"Watched people like you. Get off the boat. Get off the plane.\"\n\n\nOne passed overhead, the engines droning then fading into a rumble as it disappeared in the light.\n\n\n\"Take everything people offer. And leave a mess behind.\"\n\n\n\"Please.\" Jeff interrupted. \"She's going to\u00a0 die.\"\n\n\n\"-Where are the rest of you now?\"\n\n\nJeff simply hefted Kayla's body a little. He looked at her then at the witch.\n\n\n\"Do you love her?\"\n\n\nThe question took him aback. But he shook his head eventually side to side.\n\n\n\"You don't.\"\n\n\n\"I don't want her to die.\"\n\n\nThe woman walked over. And lifted the hood off his head. She could see the raw scalp and skull poking through matted hair. The hole where an ear used to be.\n\n\nThe woman. Well, she might be dead. She sure looked it. A smaller person would have less time. It was impressive she made it that far really.\n\n\n\n\"...Perhaps I overreacted.\" The witch admitted.\n\n\nJeff's face sagged a little. Blood trickled through his eyes. He thought wise of not touching them. Something dripped over Kayla, a clear liquid from a glass. The little drops stopped. The glass was offered to him next.\n\n\n\"Drink.\"\n\n\nHe carefully did. Considering the unknown as he did so. As raw as his tongue was, it felt like a mild relief.\n\n\nThe old woman explained. \"It may not save you. But it is the best thing I can do.\"\n\n\nJeff tried to speak again. But all the skin and fat dangling simply made him unable to.\n\n\n\"Perhaps one of you get another chance.\" The old woman promised.\n\n\n---\n\n\nKayla woke up. She couldn't really move. The sun poked through the blinds. The machines trying to keep her alive.\n\n\nThe doctors explained she'd been in an accident of some sort. An acid spill, apparently.\n\n\nShe had no clue why she was here. Apparently she'd been on a vacation alone. And she didn't know why she came there.\n\n\nWhen she finally recovered enough to use a wheelchair, she was taken aback by all the random people whose pictures she kept on her phone. Using a few fingers that remained to sweep through them just raised more questions.\n\n\n\nIt was almost like they were friends of hers or something.\n\n\n\"You need to rest.\" One of the orderlies offered.\n\n\nShe glanced up at the older woman as she smiled back. \"You've had a long journey.\"\n\n\nShe found it odd how familiar she was. But she guessed it was due to the time she spent in this place. Such a warm smile gave her comfort.\n\n\n\n\"...I guess so.\""
