        "writing_prompt": "After returning to the Shire, Bilbo Baggins struggles to adjust to the quiet life he once cherished, haunted by memories of dragons, dwarves, and distant lands. But as he shares tales of his adventures with curious young Hobbits, he begins to wonder\u2014was his journey truly over, or was it just the beginning?",
        "story": "Bilbo Baggins had started to get used to the cold; sleeping on cold, soaking wet grass, with wind blowing biting and bitter, cutting into his flesh as though dozens of knives or swords were so small you couldn't see them - when he had first left the Shire after Gandalf and Thorin had both tricked him and then roped him into it despite his misgivings about an adventure of all things, although much of it was down to the Hobbit's desire to have a quiet life, Bilbo had wondered how he was going to cope - but now the whole adventure was done, the tired Hobbit was trying to work out how he could adjust to his bed again!\nHe had only gone because the dwarves had ridiculed him, and then there was that little voice in the back of his mind, urging him to do something every other Hobbit found to be anathema.\nGoing on an adventure.\nAnd it wasn't only the bed he had problems with; there was the fact he had a fire again, a supply of food that was plentiful which meant he didn't need to forage or hunt anymore. He had returned to the Shire only a week ago, and despite his earlier beliefs that everything would go back to the way things had been as if Thorin and Gandalf and the other dwarves hadn't roped him into what he'd believed was nothing more than a foolish quest before he had found himself in the heart of Erebor and was looking over the enormous piles of gold, silver, jewels\u2026treasures the dwarves had taken over the decades before they had uncovered the Arkenstone before Smaug had arrived - Bilbo, not for the first time, wondered if dragons had some higher sense that allowed them to find treasures like gold and jewels, the sheer brutality of Smaug's attack on Erebor had been enough to drive the dwarves away would have been worth it for the dragon, who showed he was as greedy as Thror, Thorin's father.\nBut now\u2026.\nNow, after everything he had seen, the adventures he'd had - the trolls and tricking them, meeting the creature Gollum in the caves of the misty mountains (when he had met Gollum, Bilbo had wondered more about the strange creature, so twisted, malformed, with rotting teeth, wrinkly skin, with a terrible cough; there was no doubt in Bilbo's head the creature had suffered underneath without the sun for years, but there was something about the gnarled thing in the caves that was familiar), the whole mess with the spiders in Mirkwood before they were caught by the wood-elves, inlaid with the large adventure where he found himself confronted by Smaug, and twisting the dragons' mind with riddles while the Wood-elves and the Lake-Men demanded compensation for the troubles, especially after Smaug, enraged by the intrusion, wrongly believed the people of the lake had helped the dwarves get in.\nBilbo closed his eyes as he thought about the whole mess, shaking his head in sorrow as he thought about how many people had died just because a small group of them had helped him and the dwarves, but it had all been a mistake. Smaug had been paranoid, and he'd jumped to the wrong conclusions before he'd flown off to destroy Lake-town; fortunately for the town, Bilbo's news of what Smaug's weak point was and was able to kill the dragon before he could cause any more senseless destruction.\nWhen Thorin had refused to help pay the people and the wood elves, Bilbo had wondered what was wrong with the noble dwarf he had quickly come to admire and like, it was just a relief his original personality had reasserted itself and Bilbo hoped, in the dwarf's final moments, he was finally at peace.\nNews of the dragons' passing and the Battle of the Five-Armies had reached the Shire shortly after Bilbo had returned; passing merchants and travellers coming to the Shire either for business or to stock on their supplies as they passed through, talked about the whole thing from second-hand accounts about the destruction of Lake-Town, Smaug's death, eager to spread their gossip.\nBilbo hadn't bothered boasting about the adventures as he'd been more focused on getting his breath back. And even though everyone knew he had committed the ultimate sin for 'Hobbit-Kind' was he had gone out on an adventure, nobody was curious, although they would listen with polite and vapid disinterest to the accounts of the battle and the dragons' death.\nThat was the trouble with Hobbits; they were just so uninterested in the goings on beyond the Shires' borders that they gave any passers-by only uninterested looks and listened to them only out of politeness while counting down the seconds before they actually left.\nThe only Hobbits to show any kind of interest were the younglings; Bilbo had not boasted to the adults, knowing they would just dismiss him, but the children were another matter entirely.\nThey were blessed with dreams.\nHe constantly related to them about the existence of beings outside the Shire - the Trolls, the Wood-elves, the majesty of the dwarf civilisation that was at Erebor despite the decades the city had been abandoned, and the wonder of the Lake-Town, and the terrifying encounter with Smaug, Bilbo often wondered about the dwarves and Gandalf.\nWould he ever see or hear from them again?\nWould they desire his services as a 'burglar' once more?\nIf he had reflected on this before he'd gone with them indignantly, then Bilbo would have gladly washed his hands of them. But now, he genuinely hoped he could see them again. Sure, he knew he could go off on his own, but truthfully Bilbo wasn't sure he could muster the courage right now. Maybe in another few years?\nBut as he thought about the friends he'd made, Bilbo again had questions on his mind. Why did Gandalf specifically turn to him when there were other Hobbits?\nHe may never know."

        "writing_prompt": "After the War Doctor regenerates into a new form, she must navigate the universe as a young woman carrying the weight of the Time War, the guilt of Gallifrey's fate, and the hope of rediscovering who the Doctor truly is.",
        "story": "The War Doctor smiled, hiding his inner mischief which had barely survived through the duration of the Last Great Time War. \"And if I grow to be half the man that you are,\" he smirked when he saw his future incarnations turn smugly at each other, \"Clara Oswald,\" in his peripheral vision the War Doctor mentally danced a mental jig when he caught the reactions of his future selves, \"I shall be happy indeed.\" Clara chuckled as she stood up, putting away her cup, \"That's right,\" the young woman smiled. \"Aim high.\"\nIt had been a long time since he had gotten a kiss, especially from a beautiful young human; the Doctor had gotten over the prejudices of the Time Lords long ago, but he felt himself blushing as she kissed him. But his thoughts turned grim, \"I won't remember this, will I?\" He asked his future selves. The Eleventh Doctor sighed, and shook his head. \"The time streams are out of sync. You can't retain it, no.\" The War Doctor sagged and he saw the grim expression on the Tenth Doctor's face. To that version of him, he travelled the universe so sure he'd destroyed the Time Lords, and he'd buried all memories of his war time self away. The War Doctor had not expected anything less. Hell, he'd even stopped counting their ages and went back to the beginning, for heavens' sake because he believed he had killed the Doctor by becoming a Warrior instead.\n\"So I won't remember that I tried to save Gallifrey rather than burn it,\" he mused sadly, cursing the fact the Time Lords were gone so their ability to control the synch of the timelines was gone; while future Time Lords meeting their previous lives tended to lose their memories so they wouldn't recall anything until they became that incarnation so they were not forewarned, it was different for him as he was now, but the Tenth Doctor would not remember this either.\n\"I'll have to live with that,\" the War Doctor whispered before he realised what that meant. \"But for now, for this moment, I am the Doctor again. Thank you.\" The War Doctor smiled gratefully at his successors before he turned to the TARDISes; he felt a bit odd, and he wanted to leave now and go on his way before the timelines shifted. \"Which one is mine?\" He asked, seeing the expressions on his future selves was worth it when he walked to the shabbiest TARDIS there was. \"Ha!\" Slipping the key into the lock, the War Doctor walked inside the TARDIS, and his hands danced over the console and the TARDIS dematerialised. He closed his eyes and smiled at the sound; he was about to set the controls for anywhere in the universe when he felt a telltale burn in his chest, and a warm golden glow appeared.\nRather than be surprised or horrified, the War Doctor just smiled in acceptance; he had been exposed to time winds, shot at, electrocuted, subjected to bioweapons, and the effects of time destructors since entering the Time War; he'd been nearing the end of his current life anyway, but he had pushed himself on and on so he could keep fighting and making a difference in the War, but now the end of the war had come, Gallifrey was saved\u2026or had it been destroyed? He felt his memory going.\nHe had no more reason to be in this body anymore. It was time for a regeneration, for renewal.\n\"Oh yes, of course. I suppose it makes sense,\" he muttered, \"Wearing a bit thin,\" he said thoughtfully as he thought about his next life; he had never been good at controlling his regenerations, and he'd wanted to be ginger for centuries but the War Doctor merely made an offhand comment and a thought about his next life. \"I hope the ears are a bit less conspicuous this time, and I wish I was young\u2026.and maybe female,\" he added, wondering if it would be great if he began his new life with a fresh perspective\u2026..\nXxxxx\nThe Doctor breathed in through fresh lungs, looking down at their hands. They were smaller, younger. The skin was smooth, like an egg shell or a flower petal.\nSlowly, the Doctor ran a hand over their body, feeling their curves and longer, silkier hair, and the curves of their body.\n\"Oh, my,\" the Doctor whispered, \"I'm a woman now\u2026.I'm a woman\u2026and the last of the Time Lords,\" she whispered quietly and with pain. \"I'll never forgive myself for this\u2026.\""

        "story": "When she had found out she was pregnant and laid her egg, the first egg she had laid knowing there was a little one growing within its protective shell, Ginger had not been able to get away from the egg; one of the reasons she had been desperate to escape Tweedy's farm was to build a colony where their children would never have to live in fear of having their heads cut off if they couldn't lay any more eggs. Fowler had been too old, and even if the Tweedy's brought in a rooster to breed them, Ginger doubted she would have gone along with it. She wouldn't have wanted any of her children to live the same way she had grown up; frightened of the next day, scared of the future and what could happen.\nWhen she'd met Rocky and she'd assumed he could fly, Ginger had begun dreaming of the future she had once hoped for but had suppressed so it could never bother her while she focused on the present.\nTruthfully she had never imagined she could become a mother, but she had kept those thoughts to herself. But somehow, Ginger had a feeling Rocky knew; she had caught a few looks thrown her way from the American rooster, saying that he knew and understood what was in her mind. For all of Rocky's quirks and attitude problems, he was perceptive at times.\nWhen Molly hatched out of the egg, and Ginger was glad to name her daughter after her mother, Ginger was hit with a strong maternal desire to make sure her daughter, even if she was too much like her mother; she wanted to make sure Molly grew up happy, healthy, without a fear of what would happen today, tomorrow, and a week from now like Ginger had.\nGinger still remembered her mother; like herself, Ginger's mother had wanted to flee from Tweedy's farm, but when Ginger hatched, she became her mother's focus, but she did not want her daughter to suffer the way she had. Ginger would never know for sure if her mother had done it deliberately or if it was just bad luck, but her mother Molly had been taken to the barn because she had missed one too many egg collections. Ginger didn't know what was happening, but one of Molly's friends had told her the truth about Tweedy's farm. How it was a death camp, where the chickens were forced to lay eggs all the time, and if one chicken missed one too many collections, then they would be killed, plucked of their feathers and eaten.\nMolly, tragically, only had time for one last SQUARRRRK- before she died. Ginger had no idea if her mother had let out that one last defiant squawk to tell her daughter to never give up, and she hadn't. That day had played into her mind, bringing up nightmare after nightmare ever since. The desire to get everyone out of the farm came from that moment, that desire. And it was one of the reasons why Ginger had never stopped fighting as a result.\nAnd with every loss, every friend who died because of the Tweedy's, her desire to escape came. She was just relieved it had only taken a few years before they escaped, and she was just relieved that no other chicken had died after Edwina - she would never forget the way her heart almost stopped when they all thought Babs would die.\nWatching Molly sleeping, Ginger hoped that her desire to keep her young daughter, who was already showing herself to be so much like her it was scary, didn't come back to bite her.\nBut she did not want Molly to know or even experience the kind of horrors they all had.\nShe wouldn't, right?"

        "story": "-8-\n\"Will!\"\n\"Will!\"\n0-11 heard the shouts nearby, seeing the three lights. She had been hiding in this strange place for a long time now ever since the death of that kind man who was killed by the Bad people who were after her, but this place was not like the place she was used to; she had never been in the outside world before.\nShe was cold.\nShe was wet.\nShe was tired.\nWorse, she was lost.\nShe had been walking through this place for hours after hiding as quickly as she had left the kind man's home after he'd fed her, although she hadn't been able to answer any of his questions. She didn't know the answers herself; there was a blank place in her mind following her escape, and she didn't remember anything about anything, even how to say complicated words even if she knew she had the capacity.\nBut she had to keep moving; she had to escape from the Bad Men before they killed her like she had seen that woman murder the kind man; two of the bad people had tried to stop her, pointing guns at her before she used her gift to kill them instead and get away.\nShe had been wandering around for a long time, and then she had begun to get wet; the shirt the kind man had loaned her was soaked, and she was cold, soaked to the skin.\nShe did not know where she was. This place was not like the bright, warm place she had grown up in, and it was not long before she became lost. And then she found she was no longer alone.\n\"Byers! I've got your X-Men 134!\"\n0-11 crinkled her face into a frown, wondering what that meant as she edged closer. To her surprise, she saw three lights. Instinctively, she kept away, trembling with both cold and terror that these were the Bad people out to kill her.\n\"Guys, I really think we should turn back,\" one of them said.\n\"Seriously, Dustin?\" Another scoffed. \"You wanna be a baby, then go home already!\"\n0-11 frowned.\nHome?\nHow many times had Papa said the place she grew up in was 'home' when she knew it was not?\n\"I'm just being realistic, Lucas!\"\n\"No, you're just being a big sissy!\" The voice, this Lucas, said back.\n\"Did you ever think Will went missing because he ran into something bad?\" Dustin argued. \"And we're going to the exact same spot where he was last seen? - And we have no weapons or anything?\"\n0-11 quickly worked out these were not the Bad People, they were someone else's, and they were looking for someone, but who she didn't know, but she would have to be careful around them. She instinctively wanted to stay away from them, but her stomach growled. She took a step closer to get a better look, deciding to see if she could get a closer look and make her decision from there.\nUnfortunately, her unfamiliarity with the place she was, meant she didn't know how to keep quiet.\nSomething SNAPPED underneath her feet, and she froze in fear.\n\"Dustin, shut up,\" one of the voices said, leaving 0-11 frozen, wondering if they'd heard.\n\"I'm just saying, does that seem smart to you?\" This Dustin didn't seem to have heard her, but now she was closer she could see there were three of them and they were not bad people.\n\"Shut up. Shut up. Did you guys hear that?\"\n0-11 slowly made her way closer to them, seeing them shine their lights one way before another snapping noise had them swing around, and suddenly she was blinded by harsh light similar to the light she'd seen earlier, but what scared her the most about this light was it was just as unnatural as the light in Papa's home, and she blinked rapidly in the glare.\nShe hoped they were not bad people, and they helped her."

        "story": "-8-\n\"I must leave.\"\nEleven watched with a broken heart as the Bad Men swarmed and crowded around Mike's home. She felt tears trickle down her face as she realised, no matter what she did, she could never stay here. Eleven had hoped that with Papa now gone and so many other the Bad Men, she could stay with Mike and his sister, Nancy.\nShe liked Nancy. Nancy, like Mike, was good.\nEleven had hoped to stay with Mike and his family. She had wanted to go to school after discovering it was a learning place and to learn more about the world. Ever since she had woken up in that bed and was put in the bath, Eleven had been so sure, especially with how Papa spoke around her, that she had forgotten something, something important.\nShe was not sure if she could or ever would regain her memories, but she had nowhere to go; she was intimidated by everything around her, and it was only around Mike and his friends she felt safe (while she was still upset about how Lucas had lashed out at her when she had led them away from the Lab, from the Gate, it wasn't because she hadn't wanted to help Will and Barb; it was because she was scared they'd reject her when they learnt of her part in opening the Gate and causing all of this in the first place).\nThat was not quite true; Eleven had felt safe with the woman Joyce and her son, Jonathan. She could look for them, right? She knew where the Byers lived, after all. She could easily walk to the house. Could she? Could she stay with them?\nThe thought was tempting in Eleven's young, confused mind. But would they reject her? What if the Bad Men were nearby, and stopped her from getting inside their house? Worse, what if Joyce rejected her? The thought hurt her since she had liked the woman, who'd been ever so nice to her.\nAnd then the truth settled into Eleven's poor, battered mind. She had no place here in Hawkins. She could never be with Mike. She could never be normal, do normal things, like go to school, and go out without fear of being killed or snatched. The Bad People would stop her, and as the thought settled she knew she could never put Mike in danger, or anyone else.\nEleven could only make out some of what the Bad Men were saying.\nThey were saying she was Russian. What was Russian? What did it all mean?\nWhat was spy? Eleven did not understand anything about what they were saying, but she knew they were lying, and she knew friends did not lie, and she instantly knew these people were not her friends.\nEleven focused on Mike and Nancy.\n\"Goodbye, Mike, Nancy,\" she whispered, tears now trickling down her face as she thought about what she was destined to become now, and she turned and walked away, sticking to the shadows. Eleven had a good idea of where to go. She didn't know what she'd find, and she was scared, but she genuinely did not have a choice."

Haunted by the dark truths he uncovers, he must decide whether to confront the Sith Lord who betrayed him or seek allies in the shadows to ignite a spark of rebellion.",
        "story": "-8-\nThe Jedi or Sith Temple.\nIt had taken Anakin longer than he had hoped to reach Coruscant. After killing that darksider he had learnt was called an Inquisitor, Anakin had been aware if he had stayed on Naboo too long, it would only be a short time before he was caught. He had stowed away on the first cargo ship he could find, and while it had taken him on a long journey around the mid-rim, it had fortunately been just after the alarm had gone up for him.\nAfter a few stopovers, Anakin had learnt a lot about the galaxy. Finding out 10 years had passed since the end of the Clone Wars, had been a shock, but after learning the Jedi had tried to take over before Palpatine issued some kind of order for the Clones to attack the Jedi Temple and the Jedi out fighting in the war, Anakin was shocked.\nThere was even footage showing Jedi Masters including Master Windu and Master Fisto attacking Palpatine in the Chancellor's office with lightsabers, but the moment Anakin had seen it, outraged as he was after learning that instead of the Republic, there was now an Empire, and learning Palpatine was the Emperor before catching a glimpse of his hideously deformed face which was the result, it was said, of the attack which Anakin knew was not true as lightsabers could not cause such injuries, but when he had seen Palpatine's eyes, he had to accept the truth.\nEmperor Palpatine, the man who had been a friend, was a Sith Lord.\nAnd when he saw the footage of Windu's attack, Anakin sensed through the Force it was doctored; non-Force sensitives might feel something was wrong, but Anakin, being highly trained, knew much of it had been faked and by experts. But it had done its job perfectly, and it had helped ignite the anti-Jedi sentiments travelling through the galaxy like a disease.\nIt had not been long since Anakin had been on Coruscant, but as he walked through the streets away from the space docks, it was like Naboo, a totally different place. As on his wife's homeworld, stormtroopers marched in formation through the streets, but Anakin shielded himself using the Force as he moved through the streets to the Jedi Temple, trying to stop himself from feeling sick as he felt the Dark side become stronger and stronger.\nWhen he came to the Jedi Temple, Anakin had to stop himself from feeling sick.\nThe Jedi Temple had been his home ever since he had arrived here at the age of 9. It had long since been a beacon of comfort and warmth, and yet as Anakin laid eyes on the Temple, he thought he had stepped into some terrible world where the Dark Side had long since dominated the galaxy, and the Jedi had never been in a strong enough position to oppose the Sith. If buildings could scream or talk, this one was shrieking and sobbing. The Dark Side was swirling around the Temple, and through the Force, Anakin received terribly vivid visions.\nJedi screaming in panic.\nClone Troopers shooting at Jedi struggling to block and meet their blasts\u2026\nYounglings crying in panic\u2026\nAnger, fear, pain, grief, and suffering, all blasted at Anakin and staggered him. He felt physically sick just being here, and he almost missed the presence in the Force. If Anakin needed any more proof Palpatine was a Sith Lord, he thought he just had it. During his Jedi Training, Anakin had learnt that powerful Sith Masters and Sith Emperors were like a supernova of rage in the Force.\nBut if that were so, then Darth Sidious was like a black hole.\nAnakin was so deeply shaken by what he was sensing through the Force that he almost forgot to notice that the Jedi Temple was black, covered with large banners of the Imperial emblem. There were laser cannon blisters covering the Temple as well.\nGET OUT!\nGET OUT!\nAnakin was shaken out of his thoughts when he received a warning in the Force, and as he took notice, he became increasingly aware of a dark presence paying attention to him. Palpatine must have sensed his presence. The Dark Lord was actively seeking him out.\nHorrified, Anakin slowly and gently peeled back his probes, and backed away like an animal slowly backing off from a dangerous predator nearby. Shielding himself, Anakin raced into the Coruscanti night, putting his trust in the Force to help him get away from the evil in the Temple. As he ran, Anakin gave himself to the Light, feeling the comforting warmth which was like a warm blanket, which he needed after that experience, only he didn't know where he was running to.\nFinally, the Force told him to stop, and he looked around, panting for breath; quickly looking around, Anakin struggled to relax, but since he knew how dangerous it was to go unshielded from the Sith, Anakin needed a moment to calm down and reset his barriers. As he shielded himself, Anakin saw two people that he recognised, and he knew the Force had brought him here for a reason; he focused on Senator Bail Organa, knowing he was the one whom the Force was directing him."

To cover up his hurt, since Ned had been a lot like him, he had thrown himself into his work, listening to Octavius and following his own projects.\nAs for everyone else, well they were just stunned; Gwen Stacy had been openly spiteful towards Ned when Doctor Octavius proved what he had done, making him wonder if there was history between the two, but he didn't pry.\n\"Hey, Peter.\"\nPeter looked up - he had been looking over the design for Doctor Octavius's cybernetic tentacles, a sort of consolation prize and an apology the doctor had come up with, but truthfully he had never blamed Octavius for Ned's actions - and he saw Gwen standing with a few of the other kids.\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"D'you want to come out with us, spend some time at the cinema and out and about the city somewhere?\" Gwen asked, absently nudging her glasses on her nose.\nPeter had not planned on doing anything beyond doing some work to block out the pain he was feeling. He had thought he and Ned had been friends, and he was left reeling by the betrayal. Why had he done that?\nBut at the same time, he had been thinking about his future, and he was left wondering if Gwen was the future and not Mary Jane.\n\"Sure,\" he decided not to miss the opportunity.\nGwen smiled back at him and they both went out with the others together. They went to a cinema and then to a Domino's for some lunch. Along the way they stopped off in a few stores for DVDs and comics; ever since Doctor Octavius had gotten him more interested in cybernetics, Peter had been collecting books and comics depicting them in action, and he had been mining them for ideas.\nBut while he was out, he enjoyed his time with his friends and gradually loosened up. Peter had never really had any friends before. Oh, he'd had a few in High School. They were geeks like him, nerds who were bullied and sometimes humiliated daily by jocks and other bastards who had made their lives a misery. But as they chatted, laughed and ate and drank, Peter realised he had made a big mistake. He had spent years trying hard to get into the It Crowd, and he had failed miserably.\nNow he realised he shouldn't have bothered.\nBut while he did laugh and chat and ate and drank, Peter's mind was half on the cybernetics ideas he had.\nHe had been inspired by Darth Vader and the Borg to design prosthetics and an exoskeleton for divers and astronauts, but he was also thinking up ways of going further.\nHe pictured prosthetic organs replacing damaged lungs, hearts, and maybe even organs and muscles too complicated for modern-day replacements. What if he could create artificial organs for people with chronic heart disease, lung cancer, or a host of other fatal or near-fatal illnesses? It was certainly compelling enough as it was. Hell, at this moment in time, he was inspired to go further and design and create prosthetic eyes.\nBut what fascinated Peter the most was the fact the possibilities were virtually limitless where cybernetics was concerned. Dr Octavius himself was designing a harness with four tentacles which would allow him to multitask extremely efficiently and protect himself from harmful chemicals and radioactive elements.\nWhat if he could add more?\nWhy use four tentacles for technology and scientific experiments when he could go further, and send robots out with the same tentacle design and use them to crack open asteroids or explore the seabed?\nOne way or another, Peter decided, he would take cybernetics to a whole new level. Such technology had seen many boons since Iron Man appeared, but he had a feeling even Tony Stark would be hard-pressed to come up with many other ideas."

        "writing_prompt": "After returning home from the hospital, Selwyn Patterson is determined to find peace and regain control of his life, but the sound of a sudden bang shatters his fragile calm\u2014forcing him to confront the lingering shadows of recent events.",
        "story": "-8-\nSelwyn Patterson was relieved to be home, and he was relieved when Catherine finally left; while he adored the woman and saw her as one of his best friends, the last thing he wanted right now was to be patronised and fussed upon. He had spent what seemed like an eternity in hospital after he was shot by Marlon Collins who was manipulating Alton Garvey into shooting him out of bitterness for his bad luck in life. Alton, like Selwyn, had studied long and hard for a place in Police college, and they'd attended the same exam. Alton had been there early, and Selwyn had arrived late after his bicycle was ruined because he had helped someone.\nBoth young men had gone through their exam, only for Selwyn to be accepted and Alton was not. For the next 50 years, Alton had been forced to live a less privileged life, tending to his sick mother before her recent death, and he lost himself in the bottle. He had tracked Selwyn down to the Yacht club commemorating him, and he had taken a gun, but he hadn't planned on harming him. But Marlon Collins had, all to cover up how he had murdered somebody else. That disgusting little bastard.\nSelwyn had been lying in a hospital bed in pain, the bullet had pierced his thigh, and he had been relegated to walking with a cane and being rolled about in a wheelchair. But he didn't care, now he was home; here, he could get on with some paperwork he had taken with him to work on in the privacy and comfort of his home, and he could also enjoy different surroundings without time dragging on as it had when he'd been in the hospital bed.\nWhile the visits from his friends both at work and in his personal life had taken the edge off of the boredom, Selwyn had wanted nothing more than to leave. He hated being helpless.\nSlowly wheeling his chair inside the house, Selwyn looked around, thanking his luck that it was the same as it was when he had left it, finding it hard to believe a few days had passed rather than a few hours. He had not liked the idea of the award, but if there was one thing he had learnt during his time as Commissioner, there were moments where he had to smile, even if he hadn't wanted to.\nAs a DI and DS, Selwyn had been quietly contemptuous of many councillors and mayors over the years. But when he had become Commissioner of the Saint Marie Police force, he had needed to learn a whole new mindset, and he was pleased that he had. As he looked around his house, spotting his possessions, souvenirs and gifts from friends and family alike, his heart almost leapt as he spotted the photos of the various police teams he had worked with over the years, from the time when he had been part of the investigation into the disappearance of Marvin's brother, Linus, all the way to DI Humes' team (whenever he laid eyes on that, wishing Dwayne and Fidel well with their lives, he always felt ill just looking at Lily's picture; he could understand her point of view, of course, but he wished she had chosen a different path and now she was regretting it), through to the time of DI Goodman and DI Mooney, and now to DI Parker.\nThinking of his newest DI made him shake his head, wishing that DI Parker would just calm down, and not put his foot in it. Just as he was thinking that, a bang went off.\nSelwyn would forever swear blind he never leapt out of his wheelchair if anyone asked him, but he did. His heart pounding, he rushed to identify the source of the sound, and he realised that it was the sound of a car backfiring. When he realised that, only then did he calm down, he took several big breaths and filled his lungs with air, telling himself to just calm down. He went to the kitchen, grabbed a glass and some fruit juice from the fridge, and drank.\nAs the fruity orange juice trickled down his throat, only then did Selwyn calm down but he struggled not to react, as he thought about the last few days."

        "writing_prompt": "After one of your designs is stolen by a fellow apprentice, your mentor enforces strict rules to prevent further theft. But as you continue your work, you begin to suspect that someone else in the lab might be watching your every move a little too closely.",
        "story": "-8-\nPeter took a deep breath as he took the remote control he'd built and he entered a program into the robot's computer. Slowly, as if the robot was just waking up from a deep sleep, it moved forward. It was one of the most beautiful things he had ever seen. Shaped like an ultra-thin baby, coloured silver and blue, the robot walked slowly around the lab Dr Octavius had gifted to Peter, one of many he had given to the others.\nSomeone clapped, and Peter jumped.\nDr Octavius was standing in the doorway, smiling at him. \"Well, done,\" he complimented.\nPeter struggled to contain his blushes. \"Oh, Dr Octavius,\" he stammered, \"is everything alright?\"\nOctavius waved the question off. \"It's okay, Peter. I just wanted to see how you were getting on, and I'm pleased with the results. Is that your first robot?\"\nPeter shook his head. \"No,\" he said and he took the scientist to the back of the room, where there was a strange collection of metal lines.\n\"Your gyroscopic rollercoaster? Have you actually finished it?\" Octavius asked, interested.\n\"Almost, Doctor,\" Peter replied.\nPeter had come up with the gyroscopic rollercoaster not long after he had become a part of Octavius's team of apprentices. It was just a small side project, something to wow his mind while he worked with Octavius's resources. It was just a collection of rails and a gyroscopic capsule, which would ride across the lines without falling.\n\"But this is what I wanted to show you,\" Peter took some design plans and showed them to Octavius, who took them interestedly. Octavius studied them closely for a few minutes before he looked into Peter's face.\n\"You've got the designs of a cybernetic spacesuit and a diving suit, and plans for a robot for use in space here, Peter,\" Octavius smiled, \"this is extraordinary.\"\nPeter, while pleased with the scientists's praise, hadn't included everything but the basics of his work; while he doubted Octavius would ever steal any of his work, you never knew.\n\"Thank you, Doctor,\" Peter replied gratefully.\n\"Mmm, I have designed some robots for NASA in the past, but I like these thruster exhausts which would make working for the International Space Station to be more efficient, and I like the fact you have made it spider-like, by providing many limbs which contain a variety of tools and appendages,\" Octavius looked at him impressed. \"Do you think you can design a computer model for this?\"\n\"I will soon, but I want to iron out the kinks in the design.\"\n\"You'd better do it. Keep it up, Peter.\"\n-8-\nThe next day, Peter was searching the locked desk he'd been given for the design plans for the space robot. But he couldn't find it. He was sure he had placed it in there.\n\"Can all students please attend the main laboratory!\"\nIt was Doctor Octavius, and he didn't sound happy. Peter was tempted to ignore the summons, but he had learnt early on that Octavius valued punctuality to a T; miss a meeting and then he would throw you out. Quickly he left the lab, and he joined the others in the main laboratory.\n\"What's this about?\" He asked, looking around and noticing Ned Leeds wasn't there. Ned and he had become friends, even if even in his occasional obliviousness, he noticed that Ned was sometimes extremely jealous of the attention Peter received. It wasn't exactly his fault, but Ned focused more on computer technology than cybernetics.\n\"Beats me,\" Gwen glanced at him, blushing when she caught the look in his eyes.\nOctavius came in, stormed in, more like, and in his hands was a DVD. He put it on a computer and showed everyone. Peter watched in horror as Ned Leeds walked into Peter's laboratory, and managed to pick the lock on the desk. Everyone gasped as they saw him rooting through the files until he found some he was looking for, carefully putting everything back and then leaving the lab.\nOctavius turned off the computer and glared around the lab, furious, not with them but with Ned. \"Ned Leeds has been kicked out of this unit. He will not be coming back. Plagiarism and theft in this laboratory is not tolerated.\"\nPeter idly wondered if Octavius had suffered from it in the past, and he felt that would explain many of his stances.\n\"In all of the labs there are CCTV cameras, and I watch them closely not to spy on anyone, but to make sure this doesn't happen. Earlier on, I saw Ned shamelessly create a computer model of a piece of work I had seen Peter come up with, and I checked it out.\"\nWith that, Octavius picked up a file crossed the room and handed it over to Peter. \"Peter, please accept my apologies, I assure you this will not be happening again,\" he promised.\nBut something in his voice sounded like a threat."

        "writing_prompt": "Peter Parker lands a dream job working under the brilliant Dr. Otto Octavius, but as he navigates the awe-inspiring lab and bonds with fellow young scientists, he begins to question whether his lifelong pursuit of approval and unattainable goals is worth the cost of his own happiness.",
        "story": "-8-\nPeter Parker was both in awe and yet despair. Thanks to a friend, Dr Curtis Connor, whom he had met because he was connected to his father, Richard Parker, Peter had recently gotten a job under Dr Otto Octavius, one of the greatest scientific minds of the 21st century. The man was a genius in what seemed every single field of science.\nIt was not long before Peter was overawed; he had always prided himself on his own knowledge, but that mostly came because he wasn't entirely sure why his parents had left him years ago, but he was positive that they had left because he was not good enough, and so he had worked hard, studied hard, and sacrificed so much just to be the best.\nOctavius had surprised him; when Peter had gotten the job, in his less enthusiastic moments he had wondered what it would be like working for the man, and he had pessimistically wondered if Octavius would simply have him clean up and get him and the other assistants coffees or something mundane like that, but it hadn't happened like that. Octavius had instead taken Peter and the others under his wing, and when Peter had met them, he knew they would not get along with the likes of Flash Thompson. All of them were like him in so many ways; socially inept and awkward, preferring books and computers to socialising, loved sci-fi movies, and found it hard to meet others to understand them.\nThanks to various science journals and articles, and documentaries on the internet, Peter had seen clips showing particle accelerators, labs aimed at piercing the mysteries of the universe and NASA's laboratories, but Octavius's laboratory was filled, seemingly, with computers and technology he had never dreamt of.\nBut he was despairing because he had yet to try to make a move towards Mary Jane Watson, and to be honest he doubted he could ever make the beautiful redhead girl like him. But the miracle was there were other girls here, and he had found he had more in common with them than he ever did with Mary Jane.\nOne of the girls was a blonde girl called Gwen Stacy; she was beautiful and despite being socially awkward, she had a sense of fashion that was both simple and elegant.\nIn the meantime, he was focusing on his job. Octavius was both a boss and a teacher, and he set tasks for advancing human science for all of the apprentices he had gathered.\nBut while he was awed by the technologies and the fact he was making his own future while kids like Harry had it handed over to him on a plate, and Flash and others like him were given scholarships for things as mundane as sports, Peter was left wondering if his personal life would be better, this job was helping pay many of the bills which was a relief.\n\"Be careful there, Peter,\" a soft voice spoke, and Peter nearly jumped when he realised Dr Octavius was right behind him, he turned on his seat and saw him there. \"I want that formula to be stable, not too explosive.\"\nPeter turned and to his horror and embarrassment he realised Octavius was right, he had been concentrating so hard on worrying about his woes that he had half forgotten what he was meant to be doing. \"I'm sorry, Doctor,\" he hastily corrected the formula, double-checking it to make sure it wasn't too dangerous.\nOctavius frowned as if Peter was a complex puzzle. \"Come with me, Peter, I want to talk to you,\" he said and while Peter hid his embarrassment and trepidation, he dutifully followed. When they were in Octavius's office, the scientist came out with it.\n\"I'm not angry with you, Peter, nor Curt. You're a damn good scientist with an impressive scientific mind. But you remind me of myself, do you know why?\"\nRealising it wasn't a rhetorical question, Peter quickly shook his head, \"No.\"\n\"I was abused as a child, Peter. My father was a hard man who didn't care about me, my education, or my interests unlike my mother,\" Octavius made a face as he thought about his father, \"and more than once I would get distracted in my work until someone shook me out of it. And before you say a word, I know you're not abused, but I think you are being bullied, yes?\"\nPeter was stunned that this genius, this titan of science, was able to read him so well when so many failed.\nFortunately, Octavius didn't expect an answer to such a sensitive question. He leaned forward, \"Peter, you have something special within yourself. You have a brain, and I want to see it well used and I want to see you do well. Forget the people who tormented you. I forgot my father, and yet he has not even changed. I haven't looked back on him once, but I make sure my mother and sisters receive a good income. Focus on what's important to you, don't worry about anything else. Do you understand what I mean?\"\nPeter replayed the other man's advice, and he had to admit he liked what he was hearing.\nDr Octavius was right, why should he care what happened to Flash and the others? Okay, so he wanted to date Mary Jane, but was she truly attainable, or was he wasting his time there?"
