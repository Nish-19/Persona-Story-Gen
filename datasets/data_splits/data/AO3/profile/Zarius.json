        "story": "The night unveils and they are there, all sweat, no fear, in flight, each alight.\nThey are alive.\nAll of them.\nThe Noble family and their Doctor, of which two were present.\nOne was here on business, another for pleasure, at his best friend\u2019s insistence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit loud ain\u2019t it?\u201d said Donna as she raised her glass of gin and tonic to her lips.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re too loud, you\u2019re too old Mum\u201d said Rose as she got up from her seat at the family table to take to the floor, to mingle and bedazzle, to sparkle and glide.\n\u201cWhat does that say about him down there?\u201d Donna asked of her Doctor as they looked down from the balcony to see the fifteenth in the line of succession twirling with excess in his proud highland kilt, his spins attracting the eagled eyes of a few choice spectators. The DJ had noticed this spark on fire, and had turned up the volume.\nThe Fourteenth turned back to Donna, a big smile on his face.\n\u201cOnly as old as you feel\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd how do you feel space man?\u201d Donna asked.\n\u201cHe\u2019s thirsty, I\u2019m hungry\u201d replied The Doctor, kneeling back and folding his arms behind his head to lean on them.\n\u201cOh no, you\u2019re gonna work up an appetite first, I want you on that floor pronto\u201d\n\u201cBut all I know to do is some inflatable giraffe\u201d The Doctor insisted.\n\u201cMaybe this is the day you learn...by watching him doing that?\u201d Donna said, pointing to the Fifteenth and his radiant raving.\n\u201cFair point and you\u2019re coming along too, just to keep an eye on our daughter\u201d\n\u201cMy daughter, that\u2019s what you meant\u201d said Shaun, downing another drink, his fifth, in rapid succession.\n\u201cShaun, don\u2019t be a scrooge, he didn\u2019t mean it like that, he\u2019s a part of us now, you know it\u201d\n\u201cI know a lot more than you\u2019re willing to admit to\u201d said Shaun.\n\u201cYou\u2019re drunk\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t I call a cab then?\u201d Shaun said, slapping the table with his right hand several times as he tried to force some kind of hysteria from himself.\n\u201cI\u2019ll help him outside sweetheart, you go have fun\u201d Wilf said, winking at The Doctor as he helped a stumbling Shaun to his feet.\n\u201cOh, oh Wilf, no, don\u2019t try setting us up like this, I don\u2019t want any....\u201d The Doctor began, but Wilf wasn\u2019t having it.\n\u201cHe\u2019s almost at the acceptance stage son, don\u2019t be this far along in denial, now you take that jewel over there and you treat her right on that floor, you hear me?\u201d\nThe Doctor nodded, Wilf saluted The Doctor and headed with Shaun towards the exit.\nThe Doctor extended his hand to Donna, initially hesitant, Donna placed her hand in his and squeezed it tightly.\nThey led each other down the stairs and onto the floor.\nThe music continued to raise the temperature, everyone began wildly thrusting, trying to look bigger, reach higher.\nThey felt together, they felt connected, they felt release, and they felt loved.\nAt first timid in their approach, The Doctor-Donna soon blazed their trail across the floor as eyes connected and memories stirred. It was as if a wild fire had broken out, and no sprinkler could dose their flames.\nThe Fifteenth laughed and headed upstairs to the balcony, where he stopped a young blonde girl from dropping her glass.\nFortune may have favoured the girl he would come to know as Ruby Sunday tonight, but the fleeting curtain of night was still young, and for now Christmas truly belonged to him and Donna Noble.\n\u201cHow\u2019s old age feeling now Spaceman?\u201d said Donna as she gave The Doctor a maddening twirl.\n\u201cI\u2019m like the Earth as it turns, from endless winter to eternal spring\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s see by May if you dance any better\u201d said Donna cheekily, and gave him a kiss on the nose before daring him to come find her amidst the teeming mass of flirtatious flesh that was the packed nightclub crowd"

        "story": "The Toymaker, realizing The Doctor had a contrary answer to everything he could throw at him in regards to guilt, pressed ahead with his puppet show, and pivoted away from the point he was making.\n\u201cThen, he was meeting Graham, Yasmin, and Ryan. Graham was scared that the cancer, it would be returning, so he confided his fears in the good Doctor, hoping she would reassure him, but she said nothing, and he had to head into the unknown with her full of uncertainty, not knowing if he would continue to live or die in front of his friends\u201d\n\u201cDoctor? Do you have an answer to that?\u201d Donna asked the man seated beside her.\nThe Fourteenth Doctor gritted his teeth, his mind raced, scrambling to come up with something to say in regards to that.\nIn his Thirteenth incarnation, he had kept a great deal bottled up, all of them secrets , and feelings. Like so many incarnations before her, the Thirteenth feared more than anything else an ending of some sort, she always tried to avoid the tragedies.\nBut seeing the Toymaker remind him of Amy, Clara, and Bill, made The Doctor realize that there\u2019d been a phase where he had been slipping, he\u2019d gotten too big, too noisy, and in trying to downplay that, he\u2019d gotten far too complacent and careless.\nYaz was up next, seated opposite Graham.\n\u201cAnd then, the Doctor found love once again, this time with Yasmin Khan, who was being with her for the rest of her days, yes, but then, those days came to an end, and the Thirteenth, she was killed by The Master and in her last moments of life, chose to spend it in full view of a sunrise, und she was all alone. She left Yasmin in a park, und and never said goodbye.  Yaz\u2019s heart was left utterly broken\u201d\nThe scissors cut through Yaz and Graham\u2019s strings and they collapsed to the floor of the puppet theatre.\nDespite the nagging doubts in his mind, The Doctor steeled himself and gave his response.\n\u201cGraham would dedicate himself to keeping the planet safe whenever I was not there to defend it, and both he and Yaz would find solace with an abundance of allies, each with   trauma and tragedy to the front and back of them, at no point did any of their experiences break them, they are there for each other, tried and true companions all\u201d\nOh well that\u2019s alright then!\n\u201cWhat about Ryan?\u201d Donna whispered\n\u201cOh Ryan? He was the grown up in the fam, he knew when to cut out early, more to the point he convinced Graham to come with him\u201d\n\u201cWell...that\u2019s more than alright in my book, that, space man, is an achievement. Any man who can talk someone out of the adventure of a lifetime is someone worth listening to.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d The Doctor said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later. When you\u2019re ready, you\u2019ll listen\u201d\n\u201cListen to this Donna Noble, and listen clear, I will get you out of this, I love you\u201d\n\u201cLove you too, you great thin pastry\u201d\nAs the two leaned in for a kiss, The Toymaker continued his macabre show.\n\u201cAnd then, there came the Flux...\u201d"

But as they consider making the land down under their new home, they can\u2019t help but wonder\u2014can Spider-Man truly hang up his web in a place this far from home?",
        "story": "In Peter Parker\u2019s dreams, his life reran.\nNot every detail or memory, but the past several months felt inescapable.\nFrom his wife\u2019s theatre shutting down, to her being cast in a movie, to being hounded by The Hobgoblin, heading out to Hollywood on an out of this world road trip, they had done it all and then some.\nIt felt most unfair they had spent the second half of the year separated through a series of bizarre circumstances, from Peter wanting to be there for his Aunt as she tried to marry a subterranean monarch, to returning to New York and netting one of his first front page by-lines.\nAs his mind cycled through the memories again and at least once more, Peter came to realize the significance of them. These had been days of very real accomplishment, for both him and his wife.\nAnd today both had earned their reward.\nPeter\u2019s eyes slid open; the reruns were at an end.\nAnd the first face he saw was Mary Janes\u2019, her lush bright eyes staring into his, blinking in synch, she gently graced his forehead with a gentle kiss.\n\u201cYou sure can sleep Tiger. I was afraid they\u2019d soon be ready to take off again with us still on board\u201d\n\u201cAre we here Tigress?\u201d Peter asked.\n\u201cTake a look and see\u201d Mary Jane replied, inviting Peter to stare out of the plane windows.\nPeter did so, and his smile only grew bigger.\nHere they were, in the land down under, the plane had touched down in Sydney, Australia.\n\u201cI\u2019m curious Tiger; just what was it you were dreaming about?\u201d MJ asked.\n\u201cJust the Adventures we\u2019ve had, before the adventures to come\u201d Peter replied.\nMJ grabbed his hand and hoisted him up, arm in arm; they disembarked from the plane into the white-hot heat of the outback.\nPeter stared lovingly at MJ, and as he remembered just whose earnings had punched the ticket for this occasion, that sense of accomplishment was elevated by another wholesome sensation that gripped him.\nPride.\nHe was so proud of what MJ's work ethic had brought to their world, it rivalled the pride she herself felt being married to a streetwise superhero.\nBoth were one another\u2019s heroes, both had achieved their dreams.\nNone of those dreams had ever been that small, but they had taught themselves that they could be pursued and achieved.\nThis had not been their first dream, their first vacation, but it still felt altogether different compared to all that had come before them. This felt like the beginning of an unwritten chapter.\nThis felt like the future.\n\u201cMJ...do you think, we should stay here?\u201d Peter asked as he and MJ\u2019s feet touched the smooth hard slabs of the airport tarmac, solidifying their arrival.\n\u201cHere? For real? Not just for a few days?\u201d\n\u201cI fancy labelling myself the \u2018Outback Arachnid\u2019, does it sound good to you?\u201d\n\u201cYou could make a fortune coming up with Marvella movie titles Tiger\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to gauge just how popular your alter-ego is around these parts\u201d\nAn enthusiastic girl, an influence on social media, suddenly ran up to both of them, asking for an autograph.\n\u201cOh my gosh, you\u2019re Mary Jane Parker and her husband, we\u2019ve been following all your BTS on Marvella 2, can you believe the Horner\u2019s want to write that film off for tax? You can\u2019t let them do that to us, you\u2019re huge over here\u201d\nMJ obliged the girl and gave her a signed autograph.\n\u201cAnd before you ask, I\u2019ll be sure to like and subscribe\u201d MJ joked.\nPeter and MJ looked at one another, raising their eyebrows and smirking.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll be just fine Petey\u201d\n\u201cThen it\u2019s settled. You and me? Here for keeps?\u201d\n\u201cOne day at a time Tiger\u201d MJ cautioned, not wanting Peter\u2019s enthusiasm to run too far away with him.\nPeter shrugged, and hoisted her high in the air, twirling.\n\u201cLady, our daily routine is the simplest way to travel\""

        "story": "He didn\u2019t want to wake her.\nHe gazed at her luscious prone body, her head buried beneath two pillows.\nHe heard a shot ring out, Wilf out in the garden, trying to get one better on the moles.\nAs she snored, The Doctor smiled.\nShe could power her way through anything, nothing could disrupt her, not even the sounds of clapping thunder.\nHe caressed her locks of long red hair; it was this particular gesture that stirred her into consciousness.\nShe rose upwards, initially clinging the sheets to her chest. Then, when it became apparent who was in the room with her, she threw them down, revealing that she wasn\u2019t wearing anything.\n\u201cHey\u201d she said, switching on the night lamp to get a good look at her best friend. The love of all his lives.\n\u201cHi\u201d The Doctor said, taking a seat at the edge of the bed and wearily rubbing his eyes.\n\u201cYou having the same as the night before?\u201d she asked, giving his back a good rub to ease how tense he was.\n\u201cEvery time. It\u2019s all of them Donna, all of me...detaching, dying, regenerating, then, waking up elsewhere, reborn, renewed. Their lives came to an end, and by some miracle, began again, a TARDIS waiting for them where last they stood...and then they\u2019re off...out into the unknown...\u201d\n\u201c...And you?\u201d Donna asked, \u201cHow does it make you feel?\u201d\nThe Doctor looked into her eyes and matched it with a hearty gleam.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d feel alone, I thought, \u2018well there\u2019s\u2019 not much left of me is there? All the others have shut the door behind me, I\u2019m not dead I suppose, but who am I without all those other missing pieces? All those other incarnations? That\u2019s what I thought I\u2019d feel like, but look where I am, you and me, the TARDIS...\u201d\n\u201c...Our Rose\u201d said Donna.\n\u201cShe\u2019s not mine\u201d The Doctor argued, not wanting such a modest compliment, he didn\u2019t think it fair on Donna\u2019s now ex-husband, the man she ditched once it became clear who was truly in her heart.\n\u201cOh but she is\u201d Donna insisted, \u201cThe meta crisis passed down from you, to me, to her, you helped make her who she was spaceman, oh Shaun he did his part, but it\u2019s because of you that she was able to save the world. She\u2019s more than man, woman, or child, she\u2019s our experiences, all of time and space, all of you and me. Our daughter. Our blood, our life\u201d\nHer words soothed the man before her, a man who, day to day, was still adjusting to a regular run around the days before and the days ahead, who\u2019s recent bi-regeneration had done more than enable new life to gallop away, but for all those long dead stars that glittered along his time stream to reignite and shoot like comets across the stratosphere.\nAll of time, all of space, all of them.\nAnd he was the piece left on Earth, with the family he always wanted, with the love he\u2019d always craved.\nHe wrapped his arms over Donna\u2019s barren waist, and held on tightly as he hoisted her up.\n\u201cHow do you do it Donna Noble? How do you give me so much to live for?\u201d\n\u201cSimplest answer spaceman, by living, now kiss me\u201d\nThe Doctor pressed his lips to hers, and both folded themselves far beneath the sheets, eager to demonstrate how alive they truly were.\nDonna was so lucky to have this face back, this form, yet it did cause her to drift a little in their lovemaking, driving her to a momentary distraction.\n\u201cJust occurred to me...if the bi-regeneration gave new life to all your previous selves, and this body is a retread, a copy...that means there exists in the time stream....\u201d Donna began; The Doctor pressed his finger to her lips\n\u201cYeah, even more of me\u201d he replied, pointing to his face.\nAs she relaxed and let him inside of her, Donna knew she would dream of nothing else afterwards."

They 're lost, damaged...\"\n\"So am I, but we're all big boys, we'll get better\" Logan bragged\nJean stroked his rugged, stony face gently.\n\"Oh Logan, we all know you can't heal that fast\"\n\"...Jean...\"\n\"No, not Jean, not anymore, call me...Madelyn. Madelyn Pryor\"\n\"Why that name?\" Logan asked.\n\"...Because 'Prior' to the future, there was the past, and it's one I'm proud to have had, I'll cherish it always, my time with you, the X-Men, Scott, with Nathan.

Uncomplicated, sure of themselves, ready for anything.\nThese were the days and years where she felt most welcome.\nNow, with Roberto, a boy, a friend, and a bit of both combined, critically injured a few meters away from her, she realized she was no longer here to play, not when there was a price to pay.\nShe stood before her enemy; her thoughts cast themselves back to the first few words she had uttered to Roberto when he had dropped in on her earlier in the day, after her birthday plans had been denied to her.\n\u201cMagneto is a jerk\u201d\nAnd how appropriate now, that the foe she was staring down, draped in his all too familiar crimson red and purple armour, helmet attached, a formidable and seemingly impenetrable energy bubble surrounding him, was the physical embodiment of that who had jerked her around.\nThis wasn\u2019t a game, but it felt as though this was still playtime.\nCould she still have fun even if it were all business?\n\u201cI am Magneto, master of magnet\u201d decreed the simulation.\n\u201cCome again?\u201d asked Jubilee.\n\u2018Magneto\u2019 approached her, raising his arms, stacks of metal boxes raised them high and were thrust towards Jubilee\u2019s person, she darted left and right as they came crashing down, breaking open upon impact and revealing smaller components of metallic apparatus that, in turn, also became projectiles to throw at the hapless X-Man.\n\u201cX-Men, welcome to die\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re missing out on an \u2018you\u2019re there\u2019 Mags, not only are you a jerk even in this game, you\u2019re one major illiterate\u201d Jubilee remarked.\nObserving the action from his auditorium, Mojo turned to his comms and rattled censored obscenities in the ears of Spiral seated at the controls.\n\u201cI thought you sorted out those glitches during the last few beta runs\u201d Mojo yelled.\n\u201cSomeone within the system must have saved a few and are grafting them onto the existing patch\u201d Spiral said in an attempt to explain, something Mojo picked up on.\n\u201cListen to yourself; you\u2019re somehow trying to convince me that this was somehow somebody else\u2019s fault?\u201d\nSpiral muttered a few choice phrases of her own as Mojo berated her.\nMojo sulked, but only for a moment, he would not let the crushing reality of bad patching get in the way of his grand presentation.\n\u201cJust fix it, that little jubilant punk\u2019s bound to start playing the game any minute now, and when she comes to rise, oh what a fall she\u2019ll have when we trip her up. This game has to be perfect...we must preserve her every memory, her ideal vision of her world....were we to ever veer away from it, then just what would the point of nostalgia be? People want escapism, an opportunity to relive the past, let\u2019s not drag our memories into the dreg of tomorrow, this is the amber of yesteryear, and you are all welcome to die in it!\u201d"

He slicked his hair back, and in doing so, Hailey\u2019s world went into slow motion meltdown.\nMeanwhile, back in the real world, for all of this was playing out in Hailey's head, Scott was frantically snapping his fingers directly in front of his best friend, and getting no response. He took her glasses off and continued the action.\n\u201cHas she moved yet?\u201d  Beta asked.\n\u201cNot even a blink...she\u2019s totally shut down. Beta...be honest with me...has she been a robot this whole time?\u201d\n\u201cOh for crying out loud...\u201d Beta remarked, and kicked Hailey at the back of her heel to snap her out of her hypnotic glare.\nWith a spring in her step, Hailey threw herself into Scott\u2019s arms and sweetly whispered something important in his ear.\n\"It happens today\"\n\"What happens?\" Scott asked\nHailey's answer was but one word, and the promise of an eternal memory.\nJust one word.\nNo plan.\nNo pressure.\nIt just felt right.\n\u201cTomorrow\u201d\nStroking his face tenderly, she sealed her promise with the kiss of a lifetime."

        "story": "As Dwayne looked helplessly on as the superstars all filed out from the curtain and towards the centre of the ring to acknowledge the coronation of their hard  times hero Cody Rhodes as champion, an all too familiar and heinous feeling overtook him.\nHe hadn\u2019t felt it since the days when Black Adam was struggling in theatres. Right around the time he had, with confidence, claimed that the hierarchy of power was due to change in the DC Cinematic universe.\nPlans, of course, have a tendency to pivot and change just when the world is due a vision.\nSomething changes in the weather, the mood, the taste, is decided for the consumer, he had to believe that, it couldn\u2019t be because the people decided against it. It couldn\u2019t be because the people lacked taste, lacked common sense, and lacked any kind of vision.\nHe was a man of the people, the people\u2019s champion, ordained by those who lived through life with an attitude.\nWhat Dwayne felt was unwavering entropy enveloping all his sound and fury, signifying nothing.\nDwayne believed truly everything he did, moments, matches, mattered to the people. He refused to consider the idea the fans had decided what he was willing to share with them was of little substance, and of lesser significance.\nHis bloodline was being denied, his family was being denied. By the\npeople\n.\nThis man, Cody Rhodes, was their champion.\nDwayne had been bestowed the title of peoples champion by the house of Ali, solidified in a belt that he carried around his shoulders and around his waist.\nHe was in touch with the common man, the fan, the mood of the public. He had to be, it was why this new era of professional wrestling had taken off, he had sensed the change in the weather, and had pivoted.\nBut he done so only because he thought the night would be an easy win, for there was no challenge here, no herculean task. He had defeated Cody and company rather comfortably on night one, with minimal effort on his part.\nBut, perhaps that was the problem, whatever issue, it lay in the roots of his bloodline, his family.\nRoman had done what he could for him one night, but had failed him completely on another.\nFrom Gorilla position he had watched Roman put more effort into braggadocios behaviour, mocking Cody, putting aside weapons when the rules commanded their use, and delaying his responses far too much when pushed to seal the fate of his enemies.\nAs Cody celebrated with his friends, several plans of retribution formed in Dwayne's mind.\nHe would think back to the days when Cody\u2019s father Dusty was revered as more chaser than champion, and the reasons for why this was so.\nHe thought to more recent times, of how Daniel Bryan was challenged by the Authority. Overturning of decisions, title vacancies, indecisive refereeing, in-match turmoil. There could be so many games to play with the Rhodes to come.\nBut the glory would not go back to Roman. No, he needed to be made an example of. His own inability to set aside the spark that lit his fuse in Seth Rollins had extinguished the greatest title run of the early half of the 21st century, a return to gold would not undo such a blemish\nThe hierarchy of power had to change, there must be a new seat at the table.\nA phone call would be made, meetings would be arranged, and Jacob Fatu would soon join him.\nAnd soon new blood would be called upon to run through the line.\nFaster, stronger, bigger, better.\nThey would challenge the new normal, they would rise, they would conquer.\nAnd it would be all for the sake of the fans, for Dwayne knew them best.\nHe was of the people, by the people, and forever for the people."

        "story": "\u201cFamily is a choice\u201d\nJean\u2019s smile was all that was needed to assure Kurt that his words were wise, and that they had value.\nIn times like these, where all of his kind required, above all else, understanding and tolerance, it was important to put faith first in their hearts, and to let those they entrust with their love guide them to the next phase in their journey.\nTogether as a family. Together as a race.\nBut Jean caught herself thinking a great deal about Kurt\u2019s connection to Rogue, and how grief had brought them together in a masterful way. She recognised something in Rogue\u2019s instincts on that fateful day, something that centred her.\nSomething she had been missing since losing Remy.\n\u201cKurt....I saw what you did for Rogue in Mexico, she relied on your strength all so readily, yet you haven\u2019t been in touch all that long, I didn\u2019t mean to pry, but...that felt more like she was yearning, not reaching. Whatever it was she was looking for, I could empathically tell it wasn\u2019t solace\u201d\n\u201cThe brightest eyes see things clearer than the path of day within the grace of the sun. Even when the weather isn\u2019t as fair, there is no rain\u201d\nKurt gazed upon Rogue\u2019s comatose body, he gently stroked her warm southern hair, and delicately ran his finger down the side of her cheek as a small tear escaped its duct and gingerly ran down her face, a sign she was attempting to stir herself back to consciousness.\n\u201cNo rain at all\u201d\n\u201cIs it more comforting to lie?\u201d Jean asked.\n\u201cDoes Rogue hurt?\u201d Kurt asked, sidestepping the question asked to him.\n\u201cI can hear her thoughts, they are centred on Remy, Erick...Cody.....and...you. You\u2019re in the most esteemed company\u201d Jean remarked.\n\u201cBut does she hurt?\u201d Kurt insisted.\n\u201cNo...no, these thoughts are of healing\u201d Jean explained, \u201cIt goes back to what you said, she helped them live, before and after they gave a piece of themselves to her, she\u2019s relying on their love for her, their strengths, even their weaknesses bring her humility, humbling, allowing her mind a state of grace\u201d\n\u201cEven with all the faith I have for her, all the understanding for her love, I fear this form of healing is one for the mind, not the heart. She is sharply tooling herself. Experiences of squandered potential with Remy, guilt with Cody, shame with Carol...all combustible elements, she is sharply tooling herself into a weapon. She will soon be blessed with purpose. Built...for war\u201d\n\u201cNot a cloud in the sky and it\u2019s as if we know the storm is coming. I\u2019m sorry Kurt, I\u2019d try my best to help but if I were to give her a nudge in the opposite direction, I don\u2019t know if I could understand the choice I made tomorrow\u201d a saddened Jean replied.\n\u201cIt is not up to us to control who we love, all we are required to do is understand it\u201d Kurt said, draping the bed sheets neatly over Rogue\u2019s shoulders, blowing her a kiss.\n\u201cWhat do you understand about this?\u201d Jean asked.\n\u201cThat even within the grace of the sun, there is always fire\u201d"

A mind of evil.\nA great intelligence.\n\u201cYou going to stay and stare, or are you going to release me from the molecular bondage?\u201d The Doctor asked.\nRogue stood there slack jawed, for a spell, then gathered himself and did as he was requested.\n\u201cSorry, your story checks out...all your stories, it\u2019s funny, and you...suddenly act like it\u2019s all so new to you\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s still all new to me love and I don\u2019t want to contemplate what could be in store next for me if one of those faces on the scan proves true...\u201d\n\u201cWhy?

I wear that face, it isn\u2019t just appearing there to mark what will become of me, it is what I become. I become that intelligence, a being of sheer indomitable will, the ability to control and kill whenever and however I please. My people, lords one and all, spoke once of ascending beyond all demand for physical presence in the universe, they wished to bring about the end of linear time and become free of cause and effect. What if I achieve it? My god Rogue...what if that is my calling? It was said I would have many names before the end...beast, storm, Valeyard...and now...Intelligence\u201d\nRogue walked up to The Doctor and gently placed his hand on his.\n\u201cYou have an illness; your friend sounds like a good reliever of it\u201d\n\u201cSome illnesses you can\u2019t cure\u201d The Doctor admitted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to tow the line between present and future without a little bit of knowledge, but if you know yourself, then you know how to shape that future into something better to come\"\n\u201c\u201cI\u2019m a devil in scarlet and black, what would I know?\u201d The Doctor asked.\nRogue smiled and played another bopping track across the com speakers.\n\u2018\u2019Say you won't leave me no more\nI'll take you back again\nNo more excuses, no, no\n'Cause I've heard them all before\nA hundred times or more\nI'll forgive and forget\nIf you say you'll never go\n'Cause it's true what they say\nIt's better the devil you know (better the devil)\n(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)\u2019\u2019\nAnd just like that, The Doctor\u2019s spirits suddenly rose."
