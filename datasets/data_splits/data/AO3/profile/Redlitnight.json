        "story": "I'm not sure when it started.\nIt's the text I think. It's when he texts me that he's coming home and he doesn't put the heart after the goodbye and I think to myself that he's tired and I need to give him a break but my heart is breaking just a little bit.\nThen it's an evening when I turn over to cuddle him like usual and he shoves me off and mumbles something about being too warm and that would be fine but it never mattered for him. We'd cuddle with the covers off and sticky and sweaty but just giggle and shower together in the morning.\nThere\u2019s an evening when our favourite show is on and we usually cuddle and make out a little but this time he says he's going out with some friends from work. I'm too scared of coming off as overbearing, which I know I can be, so I tell him I hope he has a good time and he leaves.\nHe starts spending all our time together on his phone. It's work stuff he says and that\u2019s why he's been spending so much time at the office recently. He goes in early and works late and I wake up early and stay up late. I miss him.\nThere aren't any cheek or forehead kisses anymore. There's only ones on the lips and they're becoming shorter and shorter as if he views them as mandatory.\nI can't remember the last time he said that he loves me properly. He'll say a quick 'love you' if I say it first but he never initiates and never says the 'I'. I remember when he used to tell me a hundred times a day just so I would never forget. I'm not so sure he loves me anymore.\nGoodbye kisses are a thing of the past. I cling to the cinnamon taste of his lips and the way he smiled when I kissed him and caught him off guard. He hasn't kissed me in at least a week. He turns away when I try to kiss him and he laughs it off without looking at me.\nWhen I confront him, he laughs nervously and avoids my eyes. He blurts out a well-practiced spiel that doesn't actually answer any of my questions so I ask him directly if he loves me and he just says my name in such a devastating voice that that's the moment I break.\nI tell him not to stay because he feels like he has to. I tell him to get out and go to his sister's because I can't be with someone who doesn't love me. It isn't fair. He understands. He looks so broken and that\u2019s infuriating because it shouldn't be him who gets to feel like that.\nHe leaves and locks the door behind him and I fall to the ground sobbing.\nI'm sobbing because it's all wrong. I'm sobbing because he doesn't love me but he did once and I don't know where I went wrong. I don't know what I did to make him stop.\nAnd that made it all stop."

Will shifted and blearily opened one eye.\n\"Oh, hey darlin'. Couldn't sleep?\"\nShe nodded and he smiled, kissing her cheek and squeezing her as she jumped at a rumble of thunder.\n\"Poor thing,\" he murmured. At this, Nico started to stir. He propped himself up on the pillow and raised a hand to stroke through Maria's thick, black curls.\n\"Would a song help?\" Will asked with a bright smile. Nico rolled his eyes playfully as the corners of his mouth raised and Maria nodded, curling into Nico\u2019s side as her other father went to pick his guitar up from its home at the end of the bed specifically for instances just as this. Music calmed Will through his nightmares and they calmed Nico and Maria too.\nWill sat cross legged on the bed facing them and stated to play.\n\"Can't you see that it's just raining\nAin't no need to go outside\n\"But baby, you hardly even notice\nWhen I try to show you this\nSong is meant to keep ya\nFrom doing what you're supposed to\nLike waking up too earlu\nMaybe we can sleep in\nI'll make you banana panckes\nPretend like it's the weekend now\n\"And we could pretend it all the time\nCan't you see that it's just raining\nAin't no need to go outside\n\"But just maybe, lala ukulele\nMama made a baby\nReally don't mind the practice\n'Cause you're my little lady\nLady, lady, love me\nCause I love to lay here lazy\nWe could close the curtians\nPretend like there's no world putaide\n\"And we could pretend it all the time\nCan't you see that it's just raining\nAin't no need to go outside\n\"Ain't no need, ain't no need, mmmm mmmmm\n\"Can't you see, can't you see\nRain all day\nI don't mind\n\"But the telephone is singing\nRingng it's too early\nDon't pick it up\nWe don't need to we got everything\nWe need right here\nAnd everything we need is enough\nJust so east\nWhen the whole world fits inside of your arms\nDon't really need to pay attention to the alarm\nWake up slow, mm mm, wake up slow\n\"But baby, you hardly even notice\nWhen I try to show you this\nSong is meant to keep ya\nFrom doing what you're supposesnt\nLike waking up too early\nMaybe we can sleep in\nI'll make you banana pancakes\nPretend like it's the weekend now\n\"And we can pretend it all the time\nCan't you see that it's just raining\nAin't no news to go outside\n\"Ain't no need, ain't no need\nRain all day and I really, really, really don't mind\nCan't you see, can't you see?\nYou gotta wake up slow.\"\n\"Caro?\" Nico whispered. Maria was breathing heavier, her eyes closed. Nico smiled and kissed her head. Will carefully set his guitar down and joined them, pulling the covers over his family. He pecked Nico\u2019s lips and kissed his daughter's head before closing his eyes. They really were lucky.\n\"Goodnight.\""

        "story": "Dr. Will Solace was now twenty five, living with his twenty four year old fianc\u00e9, Nico Di Angelo, and teaching Biology at Goode High. He was perfectly happy with the way his life was turning out up until sixteen minutes past ten on a Monday morning when he realised he was six eggs short for the lesson. He groaned and banged his head on the desk. Originally, he'd only been three eggs short but it turned out that teenagers and fragile things are not a good combination so now there was no use delaying the inevitable. He would have to call Nico.\nWill motioned for the class to be silent and dialled the number. Nico was currently taking a sick day for the after affects of a particularly nasty cold he'd had for a couple of days and, whilst Will thought he would be okay to drive to Good High by now, Will knew that the son of Hades would not be pleased that Will was bothering him and especially not for eggs.\n\"Hey, babe,\" Will stood up and turned away from the class, putting on a falsely cheery accent.\n\"What do you want, Solace?\" Nico groaned. \"Aren't you supposed to be teaching?\"\nWill eyed his students. \"Yes, that's the problem. I'm going to need you to bring a carton of eggs to my lesson.\"\n\"Eggs?\" Nico repeated. \"What the Hades do you need eggs for? I thought you taught Biology not Cooking class.\"\n\"Please, darlin'. I'll do the dishes for a month.\"\n\"Three.\"\n\"Two.\"\n\"Done!\" Will could practically hear Nico shooting out of bed. \"I'll be there in ten minutes. Love you!\"\n\"Love you too,\" Will replied but Nico had already hung up. The class was staring at him, some curious and some bearing scary resemblance to Leo Valdez. Will slid into his chair again and blushed, clearing his throat and telling them to amuse themselves for a bit.\nExactly ten minutes later, the door was flung open and slammed shut as in burst Nico Di Angelo. He didn't even look particularly angry. He was just a fan of dramatic entrances. His eyes swept over the class, who were all staring gobsmacked at him, and stopped on Will, who stood up and headed over.\n\"Got your eggs, Doc,\" Nico announced louder than necessary with a smirk. Will took them and set them down on his desk.\n\"Thanks, hon. You're the best.\"\n\"I know that.\"\nWill raised an eyebrow and Nico sighed, crossing his arms. \"Fine. You're welcome.\"\nThe class was starting to mutter among themselves and the boy closest to them spoke up.\n\"This is your fianc\u00e9?!\" he exclaimed. Nico nodded.\n\"He's lucky, isn't he? So, you're the little shits that have to put up with him? I would pity you but I'm the one who has to live with him.\"\n\"Neeks! You can't swear at high school students!\" Will spluttered. Nico frowned, scrunching up his nose.\n\"Why not? They're all, like, sixteen. Except that one over there. He looks about twelve.\"\n\"Nico!\"\nNico rolled his eyes and huffed. He pecked Will's cheek and spun on his heels, stuffing a hand in his pocket and grabbing the door handle with the other. He turned around and winked.\n\"Love you, baby,\" he cooed, deliberately turning Will bright red. Nico laughed and blew him a kiss before leaving. A hundred curse words ran through Will's head but he composed himself and ignored his giggling class.\n\"Ahem,\" he clapped his hands together. \"Sorry about that. Where were we? Ah, yes. Eggs.\""

What does their perfect wedding look like, and how do their friends at Camp Half-Blood help make it unforgettable?",
        "story": "Nico rubbed his eyes, groaning. He hadn't meant to have a nap but he'd been in his cabin cuddling with his boyfriend of two years and he'd drifted off. He felt Will's arm around his torso tighten when he moved and smiled to himself. His back was held against a warm body, nose pressing into the back of his neck. He turned around and burrowed into Will's chest, sighing contentedly. Unfortunately, the peace wasn't to last.\n\"Neeks! Will!\" Jason burst through the door that Nico was sure he had locked, grinning like an idiot as he plopped himself down at the end of Nico's bed.\n\"Don't call me Neeks.\" The son of Hades scowled. He pushed himself up on his elbows as Will started to stir, loosening his grip, blinking and greeting the intruder. Nico smiled fondly at Will as he yawned and sat up, stretching like a cat.\n\"Okay, okay.\" Jason held up his hands but didn't appear sincere. \"Just come with me.\"\nHe grabbed the hand of Nico, who in turn grabbed Will's hoodie, and dragged the pair out of the cabin. Nico glanced at his boyfriend, who shrugged and entwined their hands as they followed Jason to the campfire. Nico was about to protest about being taken from a warm bed and a warm body to go to the campfire that was held every night but then he spotted his friends among the crowd and they were all wearing suspicious beams. As Jason, Nico and Will approached, they exchanged excited looks. Jason stood by his girlfriend, his grin almost maniacal now. Nico raised his eyebrows.\n\"What did you do this time?\" Will asked, obviously thinking the same thing.\n\"Nothing!\" Annabeth exclaimed. Nico's eyebrows shot further up his forehead. If Annabeth was in on it then gods know what was going on. She locked eyes with Piper, who nodded as her smile grew. Piper turned to Nico and Will and let out a giddy giggle.\n\"We were just sitting around the campfire singing songs,\" she started, \"when Chiron said he had an announcement and, oh gods, it's great news-\"\n\"And long overdue,\" Percy added. Leo nodded fervently. Nico frowned and noticed a similar expression on Will's face. He squeezed his hand.\n\"Anyway,\" Piper continued, \"he told us about the mortal world and about how-\"\n\"They legalised gay marriage!\" Jason interrupted.\n\"It should never have been invalid in the first place,\" Annabeth said in her tone that always led to a lecture about how unfair and messed up the mortal world was. Neither Will nor Nico were laying her much attention. They met each other's gaze with matching shocked expressions.\n\"Sunshine, you know what this means,\" Will said quietly. Nico nodded, tears pricking the corners of his eyes.\n\"I can marry you,\" he whispered, a smile forming on his face.\n\"It's legal!\" Will grinned.\n\"You can marry me,\" Nico said louder now. He didn't know if who he was telling but he had to say it. Will laughed and ran a hand through his hair in disbelief. Nico grabbed Will's face and pulled him down for a kiss. They pulled away and he let out a breathless chuckle.\n\"In ten years time, we'll have a house together.\" He sighed happily. \"We'll have a dog and a cat and a kid and we can be husbands, tesoro. We'll have a big ceremony and invite all our friends and family and you're going to look so handsome in your suit and we can get married!\"\nHe kissed Will again, looping his arms around Will's neck and feeling arms around his waist, pulling him close in return. Neither cared that the rest of the camp was probably staring at them. They broke apart and hugged so tightly that they struggled to breathe.\n\"I love you, Nico.\"\n\"I love you too, Will.\""

        "story": "After a long day at work, Nico was glad to be home. He unlocked the door and flopped onto the sofa, fully intending to fall fast asleep. He loved his job but you can only love something so much after doing it for ten hours straight (or gay in his case).\nJust as he was drifting off, he caught the faint sound of Will in his music room playing his guitar. Now, Nico might have been tired but he had always had energy for a kiss and a snuggle with his husband so he forced himself up, wrapping a blanket around him that trailer behind him as he trudged down the hallway.\nWill was singing, he soon realised with a smile. He loved Will\u2019s voice. It was calm and deep like the rumble before the rain and passionate and unqiue like the lightning that came after. Nico gently pushed the door open and leaned against the doorway. Will sat on a stool in the middle of the room with his eyes were closed and he was drowning in the music in a way that was stunning to behold.\nMy darling, my dear, my sweet\nIf you cry, don't cry for me\nBut if you want you need only\nTo release your whispers on the breeze\nMy darling, my dear, for me.\nMy darling, my dear, my sweet\nIf you smile then smile for me\nLet your sweet laughter\nCarry beyond rivers and trees\nMy darling, my dear, to me.\nAnd you find our dreams aren't reality\nAnd if you try and you hope\nBut you know the problem is me\nI'll leave\nYou be.\nMy darling, my dear, my sweet\nYou know I'd sail across the mighty sea\nI'd brave tundra and mountain\nBut it wasn't meant to be\nMy darling, my dear, be free.\nMy darling, my dear, my sweet\nOne day you'll find somebody to love endlessly\nAnd if you're drowning in sorrow\nMake sure they know to remind you how to breathe\nMy darling, my dear, my sweet.\nWill's fingers stilled but his eyes remained closed to hold onto the moment. Only when the blues of his irises came into view did Nico start to clap. Will jumped and set his guitar down as Nico walked behind him, slipping his arms around Will\u2019s shoulders and kissing his curls. Will looked up at him with a lopsided smile.\n\"My dad wrote that for my mum,\" he said. Nico nearly choked.\n\"Apollo wrote that?\"\n\"It's been known to happen.\" Will shrugged. \"He also wrote her some terrible ha\u00efkus so it isn't entirely out of character.\"\n\"He must of really loved her.\"\nWill stood and turned to encircle his arms around Nico\u2019s waist.\n\"He probably sang the same thing to all his lovers. He's melodramatic like that.\"\nNico chuckled, leaning forward to hug Will to him.\n\"Would you sing that for anyone but me?\" he asked mischievously. Will\u2019s arms tightened and he kissed Nico\u2019s forehead with a smile.\n\"Only for you, my sweet.\""

        "story": "Outside the snow fell steadily, softly blanketing the ground with crystals. The cold nipped at Will\u2019s skin, the snowflakes dancing around him and settling in his hair. His cheeks were flushes and his eyes sparkled with excitement.\nNico stood (with one of Will\u2019s jumpers on under a large coat, his ears hidden by a beanie and enormous boots leaving patterned footprints) observing his snowmen and adding the finishing touches whilst Will adored from behind him. The snowman was about an inch taller than Nico with onions for eyes, celery for a nose, pebble buttons and a crooked, pebble smile. Two arms sticking in different directions were buried in the snowman's sides and a red scarf hung around its neck.\nNico turned to Will, eyes bright and a grin on his pinkened face.\n\"What shall we call it?\" he asked, taking a step back and leaning into Will\u2019s side. It was a natural action by now after seven years of bliss and three years building snowmen in a backgarden they actually owned. Will thought for a moment.\n\"Edgar.\"\n\"Edgar?\" Nico snorted. Will jabbed his side playfully.\n\"Hey, don't be rude to Edgar!\"\nNico rolled his eyes with a quiet chuckle. \"Edgar it is now shall we go inside? It's freezing.\"\nWill nodded and they hurried into the warmth, leaving Edgar to enjoy his newfound life. They took off their coats and boots and Will sent Nico to set a film up whilst he made hot chocolate with marshmallows and whipped cream.\nWhilst he made the drinks, Will thought of his mother. They were going to see her on Christmas Eve and sleep over. They'd spend half of Christmas Day with her and the other half visiting Hazel, Frank and Reyna. On Boxing Day was the annual Camp Halfblood feast that all demigods were invited to so they'd get to see their friends. Nico and Will hadn't seen them for a while and of course they were looking forward to seeing Chiron and Mr. D too.\nWill set the mugs on a tray and carried it through. Nico sat curled up on the sofa drowning in several frayed blankets and flicking through the options on TV. Will smiled and set down the drinks on the coffee table, kissing Nico\u2019s head and sitting beside him whilst taking some of the blankets for his own. Nico automatically turned to curl into Will and Will\u2019s arms automatically wrapped around his shoulders to bring him closer. They merged close enough to almost become one.\n\"Which cheesy movie today?\" Nico pondered. \"A Christmas Carol?\"\nWill perked up in interest. \"Can we watched the Muppet version?\"\nNico rolled his eyes affectionately and kissed Will\u2019s collarbone chastely.\n\"Sure, tesoro.\"\nAs the movie started playing, Will kissed Nico\u2019s head again and used a finger to guide Nico\u2019s jaw up so that their eyes could meet.\n\"Happy seven year anniversary, darlin',\" he said.\n\"And to you, Doc.\" Nico grinned, leaning up for a kiss.\nThe rest of the night was filled with movies, marshmallows and making out. It couldn't have been a better anniversary."

His eyes were narrowed and his tongue poked out of the corner of his mouth in concentration.\nNico had spent the last two weeks in hell.\nOkay, maybe he was exaggerating a little bit but he spent far longer than two weeks in literal hell so he was allowed to. Either way, it was not fun being stuck with a cast on your leg and the worst part was that he still had weeks left to go.\nWill came around every day to entertain him and forcefeed him soup and ambrosia. Having your boyfriend as your doctor does have some benifits. He got kisses at every checkup and left with at least six stickers and it was actually kind of nice just having someone to cared for him. He'd never admit that, of course.\n\"How long is this going to take?\" Nico grumbled. Will didn't look up.\n\"It's masterpiece, darlin'. I've got to take my time.\"\nNico rolled his eyes. This was the downside. For the last fifteen minutes, Will had stopped entertaining Nico in favour of making him sit still with his leg on a cushion whilst Will decorated his cast with several glitter pens. Every time Nico tried to lean forward to see what was happening, Will pushed him back.\nHe'd regretted it the instant he told Will he could sign his cast. So far, Nico had managed to avoid letting anyone near the thing but he couldn\u2019t resist his boyfriend and the promise of as many games of mythomagic he wanted for the rest of the evening. Will was looking far too serious about his work for Nico not to be suspicious. When he said sign, he meant a name or a doodle not an entire art exhibit.\n\"It's going to be amazing, babe,\" Will assured him. \"I just have to finish.\"\nNico leaned back into his pillows and regretted his life decisions, which was becoming a common occurrence for him.\n\"Look, tesoro, not that I don't appreciate whatever this is but I'm really bored and-\"\n\"Done!\" Will interrupted him with one last line drawn. He sat up with a wide grin looking all too pleased with himself. \"Wanna see?\"\nHesitantly, Nico nodded. Will lit up and helped him up and to his crutches so he could look in the full length mirror in the bathroom.\n\"It's a little sloppy,\" Will told him. \"I did my best.\"\nNico lost his breath when he saw what was in the mirror.\nSmall doodles of hearts, suns and stars were spread across alongside some mini rainbows. What Nico was most focused on was the writing.\nGorgeous, brave, talented, loving, daring, helpful, sweet, stubborn, bold, kind, perfect.\nOn the rim of the top of the cast was written If lost, return to Will Solace.\n\"Will,\" Nico whispered. He could see Will\u2019s anxious face in the mirror as the boy rocked back and forth on his heels with his hands clasped together.\n\"Do you like it?\" he asked, a twinge of fear in his voice. Nico let out a breathy laugh and turned to pull Will down by his collar for a kiss.\n\"You're something else, Solace.\""

Before he could even open his mouth to object, Nico was sitting on a pair of shoulders advancing towards a cheerful Percy and a smug Annabeth who had just sent Piper to the bottom of the ocean.\n\"This is it,\" Nico said to himself. \"I am dead.\"\nHe was not dead but his dignity was.\nHe lost, although he blamed it on Percy cheating, and found himself wrapped in a towel on one of the blankets scowling at Will.\n\"I hate beach days,\" he said but, as he looked around at his friends laughing and messing around for the first time in a long time, he smiled to himself.\nThey would still pay, though."

        "story": "Nico and Will were in the Hades Cabin playing Mythomagic when the question arose.\n\u201cWill, have you ever kissed someone?\u201d\nThere was silence. Will could feel his cheeks turning bright red.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he answered somewhat hesitantly. Looking deep in thought, Nico nodded.\n\u201cCan you teach me?\u201d\nDespite how unfazed Nico looked by all this, Will was rivalling a tomato. Teach?\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been curious as to like... how you do it,\u201d Nico continued. \u201cAnd you\u2019re my best friend so obviously you are my go to.\u201d\nBest friend, Will repeated in his head. Just friends helping out friends. Buddies being buddies. His heart sank just a little but he smiled and went to sit on Nico\u2019s bed with his legs crossed. Nico did the same and sat opposite him.\n\u201cOkay, well,\u201d Will fumbled around for the words. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the basics. Pouting lips. You know about that, right?\u201d\nNico\u2019s head tilted to one side like an adorably confused animal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s where you go like this.\u201d Will made a kissing face as best he could. Nico snorted.\n\u201cYou look like a duck.\u201d\n\u201cWell then I know better to help you out in the future.\u201d\nNico grabbed Will\u2019s arms. \u201cWait, I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re a very handsome duck.\u201d\nHe dropped Will\u2019s arms and mimicked the face.\n\u201cLike this?\u201d his muffled voice asked. Will couldn\u2019t help but start laughing.\n\u201cIt does look like a duck!\u201d\nNico burst out laughing with him.\nIt took a few minutes but eventually they calmed down.\n\u201cOkay, we got the basics.\u201d Will caught his breath.\n\u201cWait but there\u2019s more right?\u201d Nico said. \u201cWhen people make out and stuff. They lick each other.\u201d\n\u201cOh my gods!\u201d Will was both cracking up and blushing hard enough he glowed.\n\u201cWhat? They lick each others\u2019 mouths and stuff.\u201d\n\u201cYeah I guess they lick each other.\u201d Will gasped for air.\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t they bite each other too? Eat each other?\u201d\nWill howled with laughter, rolling onto his side and clutching his stomach. Nico couldn\u2019t help but smile at the sight.\n\u201cWhat? What did I say?\u201d\nWill sat back up, a hand over his mouth to cover his laughter.\n\u201cOne last question, I promise,\u201d Nico implored. \u201cWhat do you do with your eyes?\u201d\n\u201cYou shut them,\u201d Will said. He closed his eyes for demonstration. When he opened them, Nico nodded thoughtfully.\nBefore Will could process it, Nico had shut his eyes, leaned forward and given him a brief but sweet kiss.\n\u201cLike that?\u201d Nico questioned nervously.\nWill\u2019s brain had stopped working. His mouth opened and closed aimlessly and his eyes were as wide as saucers.\n\u201cDid I get it wrong?\u201d\nWill shook his head. \u201cNo... You know, these things take practice.\u201d\nNico raised an eyebrow. \u201cReally? It\u2019s just mushing faces together. I think I did pretty good.\u201d\n\u201cYou did amazing,\u201d Will confirmed. \u201cBut there\u2019s other stuff too.\u201d\nHe shuffled closer, gazing into Nico\u2019s wide eyes. He raised his hands to cup Nico\u2019s face and tuck that bit of loose hair behind his ear.\n\u201cLike this?\u201d Nico lifted his hands to do the same to Will\u2019s face, brown eyes looking over every inch of it.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Will said quietly. \u201cThen you lean in.\u201d\nHe leaned in as he spoke until their lips were a breath away. He couldn\u2019t stop looking at how close they were.\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to close your eyes,\u201d Nico whispered. Will nodded.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nAnd he did."
