        "writing_prompt": "After discovering Harry Potter's living conditions at the Dursleys, Severus Snape storms into Dumbledore's office, determined to confront the Headmaster and ensure the boy never returns to that house again. What happens when the usually cold Potions Master takes Harry under his wing?",
        "story": "Severus Snape stalked through the corridors, leaving drops of water in his wake. An eleven-year-old boy trotted beside him, just as wet as Severus. He had a long robe wrapped around him, half of which was trailing behind him. Behind his glasses, the boy's eyes looked huge as he stared at his surroundings in wonder. The rain drummed on the windows while the sun was hidden behind the clouds. It was unusual weather for July.\nAt last, Severus came upon the gargoyle protecting the Headmaster's office, and he stopped abruptly. A second later he stumbled forward as Potter bumped into him, causing him to twist around with a reprimand ready on his lips.\nHowever, the wind blew out of his sails at the boy's frightened look, even as his anger increased. Twisting sharply again back towards the gargoyle, he barked the inane password.\n\"Fudge-o-tastic.\"\nPotter looked at him in confusion, but Severus ignored it, instead hurrying up the revolving staires.\nA huge wooden door was another obstacle in his plan to murder the Headmaster, but he was not going to let that stop him. He banged on the door, as maybe the sound could deafen him.\n\"Come in.\"\nDumbledore's mild tone only served to enrage Severus further. He banged the door open and it hit the wall behind it. Severus watched in satisfaction as Albus winced from the sound, but not for long.\nA moment later he had his wand out and pointed at Albus.\n\"Give me one good reason why I should not cast an 'innocent' spell,\" he said dangerously.\nAlbus did not get his wand out, but his hand strayed near the pocket it was placed in. \"I am a better dueler and you will ultimately lose.\"\nSeverus could not argue with that and lowered his wand. The Headmaster may be better off when it came to wands, but he held the upper hand in words.\nRelaxing his expression, Severus sat on the wooden chair in front of the desk. He nodded at Potter to take the other one and saw Albus raise his eyebrows in surprise. Potter must have been out of sight before.\n\"So,\" Severus started conversationally, hoping to unnerve the Headmaster. Severus did not\nhave\nconversations.\n\"That letter I showed you, addressed to\n'The Cupboard Under The Stairs'\nwas not the boy's '\nden'\nas you suggested.\"\n\"It wasn't?\" Albus asked in a tone that told Severus that that was not a surprise. Severus suppressed his anger forcefully.\n\"No,\" he said flatly, then changed the topic abruptly. \"Petunia must have become a close friend of yours in the past years. How is she under the impression that you have\nnever\nvisited her before? Not even eleven years ago.\"\n\"Seve\u2014\"\n\"She must have a terrible memory,\" Severus interrupted. \"Did you know that her family is struggling considerably? They could not even afford to buy Potter proper clothes! Did you offer to help them out?\"\nPotter tried to disappear in the chair as their eyes flicked to him.\n\"I thought I\u2014\"\n\"I\nunderstand\n! You could not afford to sponsor a family. You have just enough for yourself to go about helping all the poor people around the world! But then, that begs the question,\" Severus continued vindictively. \"Why didn't you offer to feed Potter? I am sure you agree that a growing child needs proper nutrition.\"\n\"Severus! List\u2014\"\n\"Oh yes, I forgot about the lack of funds,\" Severus ruthlessly spoke over him. \"However, you have a small group of people loyal to you who would give you any amount of galleons you require without question. Why didn't you ask them? Why didn't you ask me?\n\"But of course, you could provide for Potter financially, but you couldn't make them love him.\nA pity\n, as everyone deserves love, wouldn't you agree?\" Scorn dripped off every word, and Potter looked at him, blinking owlishly.\n\"Severus, I promised not to interfere in her parenting!\"\nAlbus at last managed to get a word in, much to Severus's dismay. No matter, he could work with it.\n\"Is that so? In the same way you could not interfere in some bullies' education. Who cared if the victim got hurt in the process?\"\nAlbus looked at him in disappointment. \"Severus, this is not about you.\"\n\"Let me finish,\" Severus scoffed. \"Where was I? Oh yes, the same way you could not interfere in a family's\nlove\n? Who cared if the child committed suicide?\"\n\"Severus, there is an impressionable\nmind\nhere!\"\n\"All the better for him to listen. Then he will not fall into your\ngames\nwith limited information!\"\n\"I don't have any games planned,\" Albus answered, looking at him with an expression that he could\nalmost\ncall hurt.\n\"You do not? So it was someone using Polyjuice Potion who told me to ignore the letter, saying that it was nothing? When you fully\nknew\nI had a reason to worry, that it was the sign of an abused boy.\"\n\"Harry is not abused, Severus. You are reading into it too much.\"\nSeverus stood up and banged his hand on the table, his eyes almost blinded with fury. \"\nWhy do you keep lying to me?\n\"\nAlbus raised his hands placatingly. \"Severus, you are mistaken. Sit down so we can discuss this as adults.\"\n\"\nDo not patronise me!\n\" Severus roared, but then a whimper made him freeze.\nHe turned, only to see Potter cowering in his chair. Severus usually enjoyed this sight from his students, but not today.\nHe composed himself and spoke quietly, only a tremble in his voice that revealed his rage.\n\"Potter is not going back, Albus, and if you even think of fighting me on this, give yourself one, long,\nhard\nlook.\"\nHe turned away and opened the door.\n\"Come, Potter,\" he commanded. \"The elves should have lunch ready.\"\nThe End"

        "writing_prompt": "Severus Snape begins to question his loyalties and choices as the war intensifies, leading him to a dangerous conversation with Lucius Malfoy that could change everything\u2014or nothing at all.",
        "story": "When he agreed, he didn't know what he was getting himself into.\nSeverus wouldn't say he regretted his choices, but there were times he felt a twinge of sadness. There were times he couldn't sleep, his heart heavy with guilt, because in its very essence, he was betraying Lucius.\nOh, he could make excuses, shrug off his responsibility with technicalities. Lucius was a murderer \u2014 but so was he. Lucius wasn't\nbad\n, he was just misguided \u2014 as he had been. Lucius was evil to the core\u2026 was he?\nCouldn't the same be said of Severus? Severus had just needed a chance, didn't Lucius deserve the same?\nSeverus did not know \u2014\nhe didn't know.\nWhat had brought on these thoughts, Severus wondered. And yet, he was only distracting himself. He knew what had brought them on.\nNarcissa's tearful face swam in his mind. Her voice had a strange echoing quality \u2014\n\"My son\u2026 my only son.\"\nYes, Narcissa's visit had shaken him up. It had been easier before, when he had been able to pretend that his role was only a technicality. It had become harder to avoid the truth once the Dark Lord had returned, but he had managed.\nHe had been a fool!\nHe got up suddenly and walked out of his bedroom, then came back in again almost immediately. He stared at the blue covers of the bed, frowning.\n\"... Will you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?\"\n\"I will.\"\nWould Lucius have escaped if he had gotten the chance that his son was given?\n\"If you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your way forward is clear.\"\nThe chance Severus himself had?\nMaybe Severus should be the one to give him an out. Offer a chance. Two comrades united in the greatest prank anyone had dared to do.\nIf only the stakes weren't so high.\nNo, he had to be responsible. He had to think of the bigger picture. What if Lucius refused? Or worse still, what if he\ntattled\n? And more importantly, could Severus take the chance? Was he selfish to\nnot\ndare take a chance?\nHe could test the waters. An innocent remark, a harmless question. After all, Lucius\ncouldn't\nprefer this life, could he? He couldn't\ntruly\nenjoy the violence.\nHe remembered Lucius, with his perfectly styled hair and rigid posture, a Prefect badge gleaming on his chest. He remembered his manipulative words which Severus had mistaken for kindness. How\ninnocent\nhe'd been \u2014 they\nall\nhad been.\nSeverus knew that Lucius had only allowed him to join his tight circle because Lucius had been recruiting, but he was certain that they had become friends somewhere along the way. He could not \u2014\nwould\nnot throw this friendship away.\nHis mind made up, he summoned his cloak to him, putting up his Occlumency shields. He needed to be calm and collected. He could not show weakness \u2014\neverything\ndepended on it.\nTaking a pinch of floo powder from the mantelpiece, he threw it in the fire.\n\"Malfoy Manor,\" he commanded, stepping in.\nWhen he stepped out to the parlour, there was no one in sight. Severus waited, knowing that Lucius would have been informed of his arrival.\nAlmost immediately footsteps sounded in the hall, and a moment later Lucius appeared, clad in a periwinkle robe. His long hair used to be tied up in a neat ponytail, but now it was the messiest Severus had ever seen, and his face was gaunt and haggard. Hope rose in Severus' chest \u2014 maybe it would not be as hard to convince Lucius as he had been expecting.\n\"Severus,\" Lucius greeted him, opening his arms wide. He always\ndid\nhave a flare for dramatics. \"Finally emerged from that den of yours? Come, my friend, what is this momentous occasion?\"\nSeverus' lips twitched as he followed Lucius through the hallways. It was all too easy to fall into their familiar banter.\n\"Why, can I not visit a friend without reason?\"\nLucius laughed, a strained laughter that made Severus hide a wince.\n\"It would have been prudent to come at the Christmas Ball, then, if you want to keep your free access to my house,\" Lucius said, gesturing for Severus to take a seat.\n\"Free access, Lucius?\" Severus said with the barest hint of a scoff. \"You know as well as I that that parlour of yours is warded tighter than a fortress.\"\nLucius chucked, nodding in agreement. An elf appeared with a crack and placed two cups of tea on the coffee table.\nBlue cups. Responsibility. Severus must not forget his purpose here.\n\"Not as tightly warded as your house, surely? After all, you have managed to keep the Headmaster's crooked nose out,\" Lucius said, stirring two spoonfuls of sugar in his cup.\nSeverus raised his eyebrows mockingly. \"Touch\u00e9.\"\n\"Is the Dark Lord still away?\" asked Severus carefully. He was treading into dangerous waters.\nLucius looked at him curiously, but replied unhesitatingly. \"You know he is, Severus. He did say that you would be the first one to be called when he comes back.\"\nA hint of jealousy was apparent in Lucius' voice, and Severus felt a wave of disappointment. There was not much hope if Lucius was still trying to compete for the Dark Lord's favour.\n\"Why do you ask?\" asked Lucius, as Severus knew he would.\n\"Making sure that I am still in the Dark Lord's favour,\" Severus replied with false amusement. Lucius laughed in understanding.\nThere was a moment of silence as Severus gathered his thoughts. The conversation seemed much less amusing now that Lucius didn't seem to have any doubts.\n\"Do you ever think\u2026 about the future\u2026 what you would do once we have won?\"\n\"This is not like you, Severus,\" Lucius said in concern. \"Is anything the matter? I would have suspected you were someone under Polyjuice if my wards weren't so secure.\"\n\"I am fine,\" Severus smiled thinly. He was nearing too close to the line. \"Exhaustion loosens my tongue, it seems, and war has never been called relaxing.\"\nLucius relaxed minutely and Severus released a slow breath.\n\"Retire from these pointless games with the ministry\u2026 find Draco a nice pure-blood witch,\" Lucius answered with a thoughtful look. Then he smiled. \"It will be nice to not have to hide who we are. Muggles will be finally in their rightful place!\"\nLucius leaned back with a self-satisfied look, unaware and uncaring of the dagger that had pierced Severus' heart.\nHe couldn't stay here, not now. He could not lie to Lucius and joke about the war, as if lives had not been lost. He stood abruptly.\n\"I forgot I have a volatile potion brewing in my lab. I have to return before it blows up.\"\nLucius waved his hand unconcernedly. It had happened often enough to not bother him.\n\"You know your way out,\" he said, not moving.\nSeverus nodded and swept past him to the door. As he turned to close the door behind him, he caught a look of sadness in Lucius' eyes. Maybe he was not as unbothered as Severus had thought.\nThe End"

        "writing_prompt": "After discovering Dumbledore's true plan for Harry, Severus Snape makes a fateful decision to defy both the Headmaster and the Dark Lord. What happens when loyalty, guilt, and love collide in the shadow of war?",
        "story": "Betrayal and Apologies\n\u201cYou have kept him alive, just so that he can die at the right moment?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?\u201d\n\u201cLately, only those whom I could not save,\u201d said Snape. He stood up. \u201cYou have used me.\u201d\n\u201cMeaning?\u201d\n\u201cI have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter\u2019s son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter \u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut this is touching, Severus,\u201d said Dumbledore seriously. \u201cHave you grown to care for the boy, after all?\u201d\n\u201cFor\nhim\n?\u201d shouted Severus. \u201cYou have used Lily's name to keep me shackled, and yet you are surprised when I object to\nher\nson being prepared for slaughter!\u201d\n\u201cLily would have been proud of Harry for doing what's right,\u201d Dumbledore said, trying to descalate the situation.\n\u201cLily did not give her life for Potter to throw it away,\u201d Severus retorted sharply, and yet, he was keenly aware that it would make no difference to Dumbledore.\n\u201cShe wouldn't have needed to, if not for the prophecy.\u201d\nThe retort died on Severus\u2019 lips, his heart clenching painfully.\nHe stamped down his rising fury before he did something he wouldn't regret but might damn them all in the end.\nHow dare he?\nThe audacity! As if\u2026\nSeverus needed no reminder of his part in Lily's death, not when he would forever wear the chains of his guilt. Everything he did \u2013 especially being forced to raise his head high and play his part \u2013 was because of the shackles his conscience had wrapped around his soul.\nNo, it was Dumbledore who needed reminding this time. Albus Dumbledore, who could do no wrong even as he was preparing his pawns for war and sacrifice, he who had forgotten true love even as he preached about it.\nSeverus became aware of his extended silence and dragged his mind to the present. His eyes focused on the Headmaster, who was surveying him through his half-moon glasses, well aware of the effect his words had on him.\nNo, it was time Dumbledore learned that he was not infallible.\nSeverus gave a short nod, as if conceding to the unspoken words, turned on his heel and left.\nHis gait mirrored the way his mind was racing as he stalked through the halls of Hogwarts, robes billowing. The frightsome expression on his face had students keeping their distance, but he hardly noticed.\nFinally reaching the entrance disguised as the stone wall, he slowed his pace. The minute the entrance closed behind him, his stoic expression fell, revealing his face etched with fury and pain in equal measure.\nHe allowed his thoughts to pass through his brain, ranging from \u2018\nI'll kill him\u2019\nto \u2018\nLily, forgive me. I never knew\n.\u2019\nBut beneath the fury and pain and guilt, beneath the incoherent mess of words crowding too fast to escape was one certain thought : \u2018\nI refuse. Harry Potter cannot die. Potter\nwill\nnot die.\u2019\nWhen Severus later remembered that night in a series of disjointed events, he was convinced that Gryffindor himself had gained possession of his body and mind, considering the brave, reckless, heroic and arrogant decision he had made. But Severus could not bring himself to regret it; even though his Slytherin mind shouted logic and reason and cunning and self-preservation at him.\nNow that the decision was made, his mind calmed down enough for him to make a plan. As much as he wished to kidnap Potter and go on the run with him, he knew it was impossible.\nThinking about hiding from the Dark Lord had his hair standing on end, but with\nDumbledore\nadded to it?\nThat\ncaused a full-bodied shudder.\nThe tiny niggle of thought about informing the Dark Lord of his soul was ruthlessly squashed. If\nhe\ndid not kill Severus on the spot for even\nknowing\nthe information, Lily would\ndefinitely\nkill him for trapping her son into a life of terrifying captivity.\nNo, what he needed was a well rounded plan that no one would think he'd make. He needed a plan with cunning, intelligence, bravery and loyalty.\nIn the end, the \u201cplan\u201d did not turn out to be as twisted as he thought it would be.\nAs Lily's son\u2019s (\u201cHarry,\u201d his mind whispered) eyes met his own, green meeting black, his tears overflowing with memories, he held one back. The one that, according to Dumbledore, was the most important of all.\nThe plan, in all its simplicity, required all his strength to execute. His bravery to know that he might be resigning himself to live the rest of his life in a world reigned by the Dark Lord. His cunning to look past his emotions and to know that no matter how much it irked him, it was best to do nothing. His wisdom to know when enough was\nenough,\nand Lily Potter's son did not deserve the betrayal Dumbledore had planned.\nAnd most of all, his loyalty. His loyalty to Lily, to look past his own need for revenge and know what Lily would truly want. His loyalty to\nHarry\n, who he'd been watching since he had been told that terrible secret; watching for traits that he found endearing, in hope that when the time came, he would not be a coward (and how he\ndespised\nthat word) and give in, in a foolhardy attempt to save the world and yet betray his closest friend.\nAnd what was the result of this small difference?\nWhen Harry lifted his head from the pensieve, his thought was not of his need to die. His brain did not halt at the idea of Voldemort's soul in him, pushing all thoughts out.\nNo, his mind went to Snape.\nSnape who protected him and loved his mother, and hated him yet came to love him, only to be hated in return. The man who put his trust in two powerful men, made himself vulnerable to them, and got betrayed in return. The\nonly\nman, perhaps, who could still tell him stories about his mother, provide an insight he'd never had the chance to get before.\nAnd so he had rushed out with a bezoar in his pocket, ignoring the call from Neville and Ginny, reaching just in time to see Snape coughing,\nalive,\nnot another life wasted because of him.\nAnd nor would there be, because he planned to sacrifice himself to Voldemort, even as it pained him to do so. He knew what he needed to do and Harry was going to do so without regrets.\nHe only wished he'd a chance to have a relationship with his mother's best friend, but he was going to meet her anyway, and wasn't that much better?\nThe walk to his death was the longest walk of his life, but he emulated Professor Snape. Professor Snape, with his face pale but jaw set, after showing the Dark Mark to the Minister, agreeing to return to Voldemort. Snape, who surely knew, as Harry did, about the possible threat to his life every time he faced Voldemort, even as an obedient servant.\nAnd it was Snape who assured him that death would be painless, not by his shade but his own real, vivid memory of the snake attacking Snape, sending fiery poison through his veins that burned and burned, until Harry decided he deserved to be saved, and wasn't that just hypocritical?\nIt was not Dumbledore who greeted him on the Way Between Lives, it was his mum. His mum who cried upon seeing her son for the first time in seventeen years, telling him to thank her best friend and seek forgiveness on her behalf, because how could she ever have taken him for granted?\nWhen Harry related this message and saw the way Snape's shoulders slumped, he understood, this was acceptance of forgiveness long overdue.\nThe End"

        "writing_prompt": "After a strange and vivid dream where Ron wakes up in a world where his mother is gone and he lives with cruel relatives, he begins to question the boundaries between dreams and reality. What if it wasn\u2019t just a dream?",
        "story": "\u201cWeasley! Up! It's Grenda's birthday today and I want everything to be perfect!\u201d\nRon woke up with a start, wondering who Mum had sent to wake him up. He looked around, confused. Why was it so dark, and where were his posters? Ron jumped as someone banged the floor.\n\u201cAre you up yet?\u201d\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Ron shouted back, annoyed by the insistent calling.\n\u201cWatch your tone!\u201d\nGrumbling, Ron made to get off his bed, only to find that it was much lower and narrower than he was used to. He stumbled and hit the floor with a thud, hitting his head on the wall.\n\u201cStop that racket at once!\u201d\nRon didn't bother replying, instead opening the door. As the room flooded with light, Ron understood: he was in the attic.\n\u201cMum,\u201d he called, running down the stairs. \u201cWhat was I doing in the attic, and where's our ghoul?\u201d\nHe reached the kitchen and froze in surprise. It was completely transformed. Everything was white and angular, and there was none of the floral decor his mum liked to put. There were a few muggle appliances, and a strange woman was in front of the stove, flipping an egg in a pan by hand.\n\u201cGo and put the bread in the toaster and set the table,\u201d snapped the woman. \u201cAnd be sharp! You sure took your sweet time getting downstairs.\u201d\nRon stared at her, trying to make sense of the strange world he'd woken up in. \u201cWhere's mum?\u201d\nThe woman twisted sharply, glaring at him so furiously that he cowered. \u201cWhat are you on about? I'm telling you, boy, I don't want \u2013\u201d\n\u201cThe Boy's giving you trouble again, Jenny? If so, say the word. Boy, listen to your aunt.\u201d\nRon turned sharply to see a tall man enter the kitchen. His red hair was slicked back, and glittering eyes looked out from beneath bushy eyebrows.\n\u201cYou hear me?\u201d said the man threateningly, and Ron gulped.\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\u201cThat's more like it.\u201d\nRon breathed a silent sigh of relief, then turned to the strange muggle contraption, finding the bread ima packet next to it. Thankfully, Hermione had recently explained how a toaster worked, and Ron was able to start toasting the bread with just a little trouble.\n\u201cWhere is your mind, you lazy boy,\u201d shrieked his aunt as Ron opened the third cupboard door, looking for the cutlery. \u201cYou know very well it's the last cupboard!\u201d\n\u201cSorry, Aunt Jenny,\u201d said Ron, remembering what the man had called her seconds before\nHe managed to open the right cupboard at last.\n\u201cWHAT DID YOU CALL ME?\u201d\nRon almost dropped the glass in his hand.\n\u201cAunt Jenny?\u201d Ron repeated, unsure.\n\u201cDo you hear that, George,\u201d shrieked Aunt Jenny, looking at Ron as if he had committed a murder. \u201cDon't you dare call me that again! It's Aunt Jennifer to you!\u201d\n\u201cYes, Aunt Jennifer,\u201d Ron muttered, his head spinning.\nWhere was his mum?\nAt last, the table was set, and Aunt Jennifer poured tea into cups. Ron made to go out the door when Aunt Jennifer's sharp voice stopped him.\n\u201cWhere do you think you're going?\u201d\n\u201cI'm not hungry,\u201d Ron muttered.\n\u201cGood,\u201d was the sharp reply. \u201cBecause you're not getting any breakfast after the stunt you pulled, but that doesn't get you out of the clean-up!\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d copied Uncle George mockingly. \u201cLook at him pretending to be stupid! He's acting as if he was born yesterday!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019s pretending George.\u201d Ron winced as Aunt Jennifer laughed a high, silly laugh.\n\u201cWhere's mum?\u201d Ron dared to ask again, scrubbing at a stubborn stain.\nThere was a clatter as Aunt Jennifer slammed her fork on her plate. \u201cAgain! You know very well she\u2019s dead, boy, and don't you ask another silly question!\u201d\nThe sponge fell from Ron's fingers as he turned to look at Aunt Jennifer with horrified eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s d\u2010dead?\u201d\n\u201cOut!\u201d said Uncle George. Ron did not waste a second and ran out the front door into the disturbingly tidy garden. He laid down on his front and cried bitterly. It did not occur to him to wonder how she died, or why the Burrow was changed, or why he was living here. He could not think beyond\nshe's dead\n.\nAnd so he cried until he fell into a half-asleep state when he heard a faint voice.\n\u201cHow was your day in the limelight?\u201d The words he\u2019d said to Harry echoed back at him.\n\u201cRon! You're going to miss breakfast!\u201d\n\u201cI'm up, I'm up! Give a man a chance, Hermione!\u201d\nSuddenly Ron remembered what had happened and he sat up straight in his dormitory bed.\n\u201cMum! Where's mum?\u201d he cried out frantically.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Hermione looked confused. \u201cShe's at home, of course.\u201d\nRon breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cJust a dream, then.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you dream happened to her?\u201d Hermione asked curiously.\n\u201cThat she was dead\u2026\u201d Ron trailed off as he heard a gasp. He caught sight of Harry just leaving the bathroom, but Harry immediately averted his eyes when he became aware of Ron watching him. Suddenly, Ron remembered what he\u2019d accused Harry of the previous night.\n\u201cHow was your day in the limelight?\u201d\nWith a burst of clarity, Ron understood.\n\u201cI'm sorry, Harry. I know you didn't put your name in the Goblet, I was just being a \u2013\u201d\n\u201c\u2014 a prat?\u201d Harry finished, and Ron laughed, his heart aching as Harry's face lit up with joy. Ron was never going to hurt his friend like that again, not when he knew what Harry had to deal with.\nThe End"

        "writing_prompt": "When Severus Snape is reluctantly roped into helping a \"poor boy\" by the overly enthusiastic hotel manager in Cokeworth, he never expects to come face-to-face with Harry Potter\u2014and promptly faints. What happens when the past he\u2019s tried to avoid collides with the present in the most unexpected way?",
        "story": "\u201c\nScuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an 'undred of these at the front desk.\u201d\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:\nMr. H. Potter\nRoom 17\nRailview Hotel\nCokeworth\n\u201cSeverus! Severus!\u201d\nSeverus looked up from the book he was reading, scowling. A wave of his wand had it\ndillusioned\n, then only he crossed the room and opened the front door.\n\u201cYes, Ms Gilbert. What damsel in distress am I to rescue?\u201d\nThe tense frown disappeared from Ms. Gilbert's face, replaced with an easy smile.\n\u201cAlways the comedic, Severus.\u201d She giggled.\nSeverus's frown deepened.\nMs. Mary Gilbert was a hotel manager in Cokeworth. The hotel didn't get any visitors, so Mary had plenty of time on her hands. The visitors she did get were low-life criminals through no fault of their own, or teens in trouble. Mary's heart would go out to them, and she tried to help as much as she could. When it was out of her ability, she called on Severus.\nMs. Gilbert was convinced Severus was a Knight in shining armour, even if his \u2018sword was too sharp\u2019. Severus hadn't done anything to give her that impression, and in fact went out of his way to be curt in hopes that she\u2019d stop turning up at his front door.\n\u201cOh, Severus,\u201d Ms. Gilbert sighed. \u201cIt's\nso\nheartbreaking, honestly. There's this family, and they're looking like they're on the run.\u201d\nSeverus pulled her in as she spoke, and pushed her in a chair, putting a kettle on. He knew she'd only stop once she finished her tale, so they might as well be comfortable.\n\u201cWorst of all, it looks like they're hiding a boy! I'd have thought he'd been kidnapped, if only he didn't act so familiar with them!\u201d\nSeverus hummed, placing a cup of tea in front of her. Ms. Gilbert took it, still talking a mile per minute.\n\u201cHis clothes are hanging off him, and his glasses are taped, and just this morning he got a \u2018undred letters in his mail. The strangest thing was when I tried to give them to him. His uncle fairly slapped his fingers away. He looked so forlorn, poor thing!\u201d\nMs. Gilbert finished her tale with a woebegone look on her face, looking at him expectantly.\n\u201cThe family is gone now?\u201d Severus enquired dutifully.\nMs. Gilbert beamed. \u201cNo, not yet. They only checked in for the night, but the wife\nbegged\nher husband to stay. Good thing too, I say, I can feed the poor kid up! He looks in need of a few days of proper meals! Now, how about a chat with the child? He's been walking around the grounds by himself. Cheer him up to see a friendly face \u2018round here\u2019.\u201d\nSeverus groaned loudly. Ms. Gilbert giggled.\n\u201cOh Severus, you're such a drama queen! \u2018Bout when are you coming?\u201d\nSeverus protested, but Ms. Gilbert somehow managed to wrangle a promise from him to talk to the \u2018poor boy\u2019 after dinner.\nTwo o'clock Severus found himself at the hotel's front desk, wondering how he kept getting into these situations.\n\u201cYER LOOKING FOR A BOY, YOU SAID? WHAT'S HIS NAME?\u201d shouted the deaf hotel clerk.\nSeverus nodded tiredly. \u201cAs I have told you numerous times before,\nI do not know.\nMs. Gilbert asked me to come around here to talk to a \u2018wonderful\u2019 (he said that in the most sarcastic tone he could manage) boy she'd met, who might\nappreciate\nmy company.\u201d\nSeverus was about ready to tear out his hair when the clerk just stared at him, looking confused. He spotted Ms. Gilbert running out of a room in the back.\n\u201cWhat's wrong, Mrs. Brighton?\u201d\n\u201cThis man keeps on asking for a boy but won't tell me his name!\u201d Mrs. Brighton complained indignantly.\n\u201cThat's because I don't know!\u201d Severus said, exasperated.\n\u201cWell, \u2018ow am I to find a boy whose name you don't know?\u201d Mrs. Brighton demanded.\n\u201cIt's alright,\u201d Ms. Gilbert broke in, patting Mrs. Brighton's arm. \u201cI know who he's speaking \u2018bout. Don't you worry \u2018bout it anymore.\u201d\nMrs. Brighton went back to her magazine, grumbling to herself and throwing Severus dark looks.\n\u201cCome along, Severus!\u201d Mr. Gilbert said, leading him out through large double doors. \u201cOh, I\nknew\nI could depend on you! The little tyke will be so happy, I'm sure! I've been telling him all about you!\u201d\nSeverus raises an eyebrow doubtfully. \u201cDon't say I didn't warn you when he runs away screaming.\u201d\n\u201cYou do say the most ridiculous things,\u201d Ms. Gilbert replied, giggling as if that was the funniest joke she'd ever heard. \u201cHere he is!\u201d\nSeverus looked curiously at the child playing by himself, kicking the grass aimlessly.\n\u201cHarry! Over here!\u201d\nA sense of foreboding came over Severus, which increased as the boy got nearer.\nHe was small and waifish, looking like a gust of wind could blow him over. He was wearing clothes so large that one shoulder was sliding off, and at least an inch of his trousers were browned by dragging on the ground. He wore round glass that reminded Severus of James Potter, and bright green eyes which he used to see on another face. On his forehead was a scar the shape of a lighting bolt.\n\u201cHarry Potter, in Cokeworth,\u201d Severus murmured in horror, and fainted."

        "writing_prompt": "Hidden under his invisibility cloak, Harry discovers that Snape visits the Astronomy Tower every Halloween to speak to someone who isn\u2019t there\u2014someone named Lily. What secrets will Harry uncover as he listens in the shadows?",
        "story": "Moonlight shone over the parapet, contrasting with the pitch-black stairway. Harry leaned against the shadowy wall, even though he knew he couldn't be seen under his cloak. Still, it was hard to believe a cloak could hide you so completely.\nIt was hard to believe anything. Each little bit of magic his wand produced made Harry's heart jump with wonder. His heart warmed at each smile sent his way. Happiness rushed through him each time he\nchose\nto eat something during meals.\nHarry was pulled out of his thoughts by the sound of footsteps. They sounded as if they were almost on him and Harry pressed against the wall, breathing slowly. Harry's heart hammered in his chest as a silhouette appeared in the doorway. It came closer and moonlight fell across his face, bringing greasy hair and a hooked nose into contrast. Harry covered his mouth in horror.\nSnape walked past him and leaned against the parapet. Harry let out a slow breath of relief, watching for a chance to leave undetected. Snape stood still for a long time, peering over the parapet.\n\u201cLily\u2026\u201d\nHarry tensed in surprise, but Snape hadn't moved.\n\u201cYour son defeated a mountain troll today. He got five points for it. What would you have done, I wonder. I hope you wouldn't have rewarded him, but you always did have a soft heart.\u201d\nHarry listened breathlessly, soaking the words in like a man dying of thirst.\n\u201cHe is just like Potter, you know? Except for his eyes.\u201d Snape sighed, and Harry thought he sounded very sad. \u201cI cannot bear to look at those eyes, or I might \u2013\u201d Snape cut himself off.\n\u201cYou would not approve of my treatment towards him. I know, but I can't help it. Just adding to my long list of sins, and this would fall on the lesser scale either way.\u201d\nHarry wondered what terrible thing Snape had done.\n\u201cI will protect him, just as I vowed. I hope that will be enough.\u201d\nSnape fell silent and Harry waited, wishing he would leave. After what felt like forever, when Harry's legs had long since gone numb, Snape finally straightened with a sigh and departed, his sharp footsteps fading down the stairway. Harry straightened too, mind racing a mile per minute.\n\u201cWhat did Snape mean? I need to come back, maybe I will learn more.\u201d\nHarry again stood leaning against the parapet, no longer afraid to be seen. How could he be? He had been hiding under it for over a year and had enough close encounters to firmly convince him that he was truly invisible.\nHogwarts no longer felt like a dream too good to be true, because the Wizarding World wasn't perfect. He knew that, before, had always known that, but to experience it was another thing. Now he had more than experienced it. His mind went to the evening when he and his friends had found Mrs. Norris petrified. He shuddered.\nHe had given up waiting for Snape to show up too. He had given up finding out what terrible thing Snape had done.\n\u201cSpeak of the devil\u2026\u201d Harry muttered softly, a nervous excitement bubbling within him.\nHe could hear Snape's footsteps, which he could now recognise by sound. Snape appeared and Harry didn't bother moving, as he knew he was well-hidden under the cloak.\nHarry watched as Snape leaned against the parapet, impatiently waiting for him to speak. And yet, Snape didn't. He just stared at the ground for a while, then straightened and walked away as Harry stared at him in disappointment.\nHarry leaned against the parapet, feeling calm after a long time.\nHe was always angry now-a-days. Just thinking about it now, Harry felt the anger re-ignite within him and he forcefully squashed it down, not wanting to spoil his first visit to the astronomy tower in years.\nFootsteps made Harry tense, before he remembered how Snape sometimes came up too. Harry watched with interest, secure under his invisibility cloak, wondering what Snape would say, if anything.\n\u201cThe Dark Lord is back\u2026\u201d Snape said.\nBet you're happy about it,\nHarry thought derisively.\n\u201cAnd your son is the reason. I know, it's not his fault, but\u2026\u201d Snape laughed mockingly, \u201callow me this small measure of comfort. It is the only thing that keeps me from leaving the world.\u201d\nSnape left, and Harry stared after him, an uncomfortable feeling in his chest.\nHarry waited under his invisibility cloak, leaning against the wall. He had figured out that Snape came up on Halloweens, and Harry wanted revenge. Snape was the reason Sirius was dead.\nWhen Snape came up, however, Harry froze.\nSnape looked miserable. More miserable than Harry had ever felt.\n\u201cLily\u2026\u201d Snape spoke as soon as he reached the parapet. \u201cIs this retribution? If it is, I have to commend you, it is a cruel retribution.\nI am to kill the only person who understands me in the whole world. I killed you, and now I am to kill \u2014\u201d\nHarry frowned in confusion. Snape hadn't killed his mother; that blame belonged to Voldemort and Pettigrew.\n\u201cPotter blames me for Black's death\u2026 I can see it in his eyes\u2026 he is ready to torture me for it like he tried to torture Bellatrix. What would he do if he hears I am the reason for your death, I wonder? Kill me, most certainly. Unfortunately, he is unlikely to ever find out\u2026\u201d\nHarry watched Snape go, forgetting about his revenge.\nHarry paced on the stone floor frantically, hidden under his cloak. What if he was wrong? What if Snape really had killed Dumbledore, really was a faithful Death Eater?\nThen I will kill him,\nHarry thought fiercely. And he would. He knew he would. Harry's heart tightened again as the image of Dumbledore lying awkwardly beneath the Astronomy Tower flashed in his mind.\nHarry wished Snape would hurry up. Harry still needed to find the Diadem before Voldemort got to Hogwarts. His scar twinged, and Harry saw a flash of the Gaunt House before Harry pulled himself out of Voldemort's mind.\nSnape's footsteps sounded hurried on the stairway, and soon he appeared, armed. He was holding a piece of parchment in one hand. Harry knew what it was, he had written it himself.\nCome to the place where you talk to Lily.\n\u201cPotter?\u201d\nHarry pulled off his cloak. \u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d\n\u201cYou need to leave,\u201d Snape said, ignoring the question. \u201cNot unless you are ready\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI am,\u201d Harry said quietly. \u201cToday one of us will die. I hope it is Voldemort.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you write that note?\u201d\n\u201cI want \u2014 no, need an explanation.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what gave you the impression I will explain anything?\u201d Snape sneered.\n\u201cYou don't have to, of course,\u201d Harry said calmly.\nThat made Snape pause.\n\u201cI heard you that night. Dumbledore told you to kill him, didn't he?\u201d\n\u201cSurprisingly correct, Potter,\u201d Snape said bitingly. \u201cIs that all? Or do you need me to confirm anything else for the Chosen One?\u201d\n\u201cAnd you sent the doe too, right?\u201d\nSnape nodded.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Harry turned to leave.\n\u201cPotter!\u201d\nHarry looked at Snape. \u201cYes?\u201d\nSnape gave him a vial and Harry took it, surprised. He looked at Snape for an explanation, but Snape left without saying anything.\nAlmost before Snape's footsteps faded completely, Harry heard a faint whisper, almost as if he wasn't meant to hear it. \u201cI am truly sorry.\u201d"

        "writing_prompt": "In a timeless temple lost to history, Tom Riddle encounters a mysterious boy named Harry Potter, who offers him a choice: to destroy or to create, to burn the world or to nurture its beauty. What will he choose when he wakes?",
        "story": "The sun shone brightly, making the interior appear darker. The air was still, and there was a strange kind of silence. There was no sound of birds or insects, and even his footsteps were silent \u2014 as though he were a ghost.\nTom didn't know when he had arrived. It could have been days, months, or even years, and yet he had not once felt the need to eat or sleep. He didn\u2019t dirty even as he wandered the hallways, looking pristine and clean as if just scrubbed a few minutes ago. It was as though time was an illusion that he didn\u2019t care to break.\nHe never got bored. There was always so much to look at. Leisurely, he admired the art and decoratives and even tried reading the scriptures. He spent a considerable amount of time examining the altar and the images which were decorated in the space above it. Not once did it occur to him to use any magic, not that he could if he wanted; he was sure he didn't have a wand. But that didn\u2019t trouble Tom.\nHe was absentmindedly waiting. What for? He didn\u2019t know. Was it a what, or was it a who? That knowledge alluded to him, too. All he knew was that he was waiting. Just the thought of the time he was waiting for filled him with a strange sense of excitement, fear and happiness, and he knew he would wait for an eternity if needed.\nTom looked away from the window, wanting to return to what he had termed \u201cThe Great Hall.\u201d It was many times bigger than the one at Hogwarts. He termed it this because it had a similar grandeur, as though it could have been built in the same era or by the same architects.\nHe retraced his footsteps, which he'd taken a million times, and stepped through the grand doors with the same excitement he had the first time. He scrutinised each statue and ornament, his fingers tracing over the carved details. Each new discovery filled him with calm and purpose as if he were documenting the place to commit it for eternity.\nTom closed his eyes and breathed deeply. He could hear quiet footsteps, the whispers of prayer and the chatter of the people. He could feel their purpose as they moved through the room, fulfilling their spiritual souls. He was so engaged in the ancient figure of Nyx and the past that it took him a while to realise that a singular voice was saying\nhis\nname. More importantly, the voice was\nreal.\n\u201cTom Riddle.\u201d\nTom opened his eyes, and a spark lighted within them. This was who he had been waiting for; he knew it.\nIt was a boy of his own age, scrawny and thin; he wore battered glasses and clothes which hung loosely off his thin frame. His black hair was sticking up in all directions, and his green eyes were curiously bright. He looked like a dishevelled orphan dropped off without any warning.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Tom asked curiously, not put off by his appearance in the least.\n\u201cHarry Potter. I'd offer you a handshake, but I'm afraid that's impossible.\u201d To prove his point, Harry reached towards a pillar. Instead of touching it, however, his hand went straight through it.\n\u201cAnd yet you don't look like a ghost,\u201d Tom mused. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause this isn\u2019t my dream,\u201d Harry answered matter-of-factly.\n\u201cSo this is a dream,\u201d Tom murmured, surprised yet unsurprised at all. \u201cIt's a strange kind of dream, considering I haven't woken up yet. You should when you become aware that you're dreaming.\u201d\n\u201cIs it?\u201d Harry asked, looking amused.\nTom felt a little slighted at being made fun of. \u201cIf this is my dream, why are\nyou\nhere?\u201d\n\u201cEasy, Tom,\u201d Harry replied, holding his hands up in a surrendering gesture. \u201cI am here because I know you best.\u201d\n\u201cWhat has that got to do with anything?\u201d\n\u201cAll in due time,\u201d Harry replied.\nTom did not feel any resentment at those words.\n\u201cI say it's about time for dinner,\u201d Harry said, glancing out of the arched windows.\nThe night had fallen suddenly, and the sky was dark, littered with millions of stars. Tom thought he could hear the singing faintly. He felt the words were important, but no matter how much he strained his ears, he couldn't make them out.\n\u201cThere,\u201d Harry said, and Tom looked back at Harry, only for his gaze to fall on a long table packed with all kinds of foods, some Tom didn\u2019t even recognise. Suddenly feeling famished, Tom slid into a seat and then paused.\n\u201cIt's only set for one.\u201d\n\u201cIt's not a long dream,\u201d Harry reminded, smiling gently. \u201cIt's all yours.\u201d\nTom demolished the food, eating as though he hadn't eaten in years. Finally, he leaned back, satisfied.\nHarry stood up, and Tom did the same by some unspoken order.\n\u201cDo you know when we are, Tom?\u201d Harry asked, walking towards the door. Tom stood up, adjusting his impeccable robes, and fell into step beside him.\n\u201cSome kind of temple,\u201d Tom answered.\n\u201cYes, this is the temple of Artemis, but I asked\nwhen\nwe are.\u201d\nFor the first time since he arrived, Tom felt truly surprised. \u201cAre we not in our time?\u201d\n\u201cWe are not in your time,\u201d Harry answered. Tom noticed the change in wording but didn't say anything.\u00a0 No, we are in what we call the bronze age.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are we here now?\u201d Tom asked.\n\u201cBecause we cannot be here in the future. There was a man, a madman they called him, who burned this temple to the ground.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cOnly he knows the true reason.\u201d\nTom felt inexplicably sad. He looked around the hallways they were walking through, at the vast ceilings and arched windows, at the marble floors. He imagined it all fallen, black and burnt, ruined.\u00a0 He imagined the silence, the blackened grass. He imagined the years past, as wilderness grew and the temple was forgotten, lost to history.\nTom turned to Harry, who was watching him all too knowingly.\n\u201cIt's a tragedy. Isn\u2019t there any way to stop it?\u201d Tom asked, already knowing the answer.\n\u201cNo, but there\nis\na way to stop another tragedy,\u201d Harry said. Tom felt his heart race. He felt something significant was about to take place, something that would change the world.\n\u201cYou have a choice, Voldemort. You are getting another chance. One will cause the world to burn, to be destroyed to ruins.\u201d\nTom felt a shudder pass through him.\n\u201cWith the other,\u201d Harry continued, looking around him. For the first time, Tom saw how old Harry's eyes looked, as if he were a hundred years older than he looked. \u201cYou will cultivate the world's natural beauty, enhance it, and make it more beautiful than ever before. Choose wisely.\u201d\nThe words faded away, and Tom's eyes started to blur. The coloured mixed into each other, turning into greys, and then Voldemort's eyes snapped open.\nHe sat up, heart racing, his sheets wet and sticky with sweat. He got out of bed, feeling like something was different. He felt a sense of trepidation as he walked toward the mirror hanging above the dresser opposite, and his reflection got clearer.\nHe stared at the face of Tom Riddle, lined with wrinkles and hair peppered with grey. He caught sight of a stack of papers on top of the dresser and picked them up with a shaking hand.\nOne was his NEWT results. Another was his contract from when he worked in Borgin and Burks. Another was the week's newspaper. The front cover was a picture of a burning bridge. The headline, \u201cTwo London Bridges Collapse\u201d, was embezzled in bold letters.\nAll Voldemort could see was the picture of the temple of Artemis burnt to the ground. His fist curled tightly, and he felt his anger flare, always so quick to ignite; this time, it was aimed at himself. His magic roused, wanting to be used, and the floor shook.\nA knock came on the door. \u201cMy Lord, Snape asks if he could be of any service.\u201d\nThat was Wormtail. Voldemort's lips curled, and making a split-second decision, he disappeared with only a roll of parchment and the clothes on his back, never to return.\nThe Death Eaters fled without the protection of their lord, and the world relaxed as the attacks slowed. A decade later, when Voldemort was only a name to many, an activist was born, contributing to the oppressed.\nAnd thus the world was saved from Voldemort's terror, as the Temple of Artemis was not."

        "story": "It is on a bright, clear night when Harry thinks of his crazy idea. He is in the Astronomy Tower, looking up at the dog star, thinking about Sirius.\nSirius had a bike, he remembers. Could he have gone to space with it? Harry thinks not, but it would be just the thing Sirius would do.\nHow would Sirius react\n, Harry thinks,\nif I found a way to go to space?\nThat is the beginning of his mad plan.\nThe next day finds Harry in Dumbledore's office. If Harry had been any less excited, he might have felt embarrassed at the memory of his last time being here. As it is, he is too enthusiastic about his plan to think of anything else.\n\u201cDo you like magical theory, Professor?\u201d\n\u201cWell, of course, my boy,\u201d is Dumbledore's bemused reply. \u201cAlas, I am way too busy to meddle in it as I used to.\u201d\n\u201cToo busy to help me meddle in?\u201d Harry asks, a downturn tilt to his lips.\nDumbledore's eyes dim with guilt. \u201cI\ncould\nsqueeze out the time\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d Harry's eyes shine. \u201cLet's prank Voldemort and send him to space!\u201d\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n\u201cI've already been researching,\u201d Harry continues, ignoring Dumbledore's surprise. \u201cThe main thing would be gravity \u2014 that is, after we manage to cross the atmospheric layer. But that would be easy with magic. I mean, if muggles have managed\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMuggles have gone to space?\u201d Dumbledore finally manages to get Harry's attention.\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Harry stares at Dumbledore with wide eyes. \u201cHow did you not know that?\u201d\n\u201cIt seems I'm behind on the news,\u201d Dumbledore ponders, stroking his beard. \u201cLet's start from the beginning. There is a way to circumvent gravity, you say? And what's that about atmospheric pressure?\u201d\n\u201cWe need a\nlong\ndiscussion\u2026 or maybe not. I've been studying the muggle landing and trying to translate that to magic, but maybe we need a new way?\u201d\n\u201cLet's not reinvent the wheel, Harry. Come, tell me about the muggle landing.\u201d Dumbledore sits forward, folding his arms on the desk.\nSo begins a long and interesting discussion on speed and pressure and gravity and rockets. Dumbledore listens intently, providing input in accordance with magic's perspective, and now and then Harry notes down a question he needs to look up in muggle books.\nThe couple barely take note as a plate appears by their side, filled with sandwiches. The shadows grow in the office, and the candles light themselves, and still, the discussion continues. At one point, Harry moves his chair next to Dumbledore's, the better to see the diagram Dumbledore starts drawing.\nIt is past midnight when they are jerked back to Earth.\n\u201cAlbus, where have you been?\u201d McGonagall's voice floats from the bottom of the revolving stairs. \u201cPotter's missing, and we haven't been able to get in contact with you. Severus is running spare with worr\u2014 oh!\u201d\nMcGonagall stands at the door, looking at the pair in surprise. Her eyes move to the untouched plate of sandwiches and the parchment painted with black ink, and over Harry and Dumbledore with smudged fingers. Even Harry's nose is spotted with ink.\n\u201cOh,\u201d McGonagall says again. She clears her throat and frowns professionally. She puts on her dignified voice. \u201cAre you diving into magical theory again, Professor Dumbledore?\u201d\n\u201cMinerva, my dear!\u201d Dumbledore exclaims joyfully. \u201cWe are planning a prank!\u201d\n\u201cA prank?\u201d Snape appears behind McGonagall, a sneer on his face. \u201cYou nearly gave us a heart attack for a\nprank\n? That is not to say we were worried, of course.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Dumbledore agrees.\nHarry's eyes dance between the professors, taking in the banter.\n\u201cSo\u2026 a weak sticking charm can help us overcome gravity \u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Dumbledore exclaimes, scribbling again frantically. \u201cAnd the vacuuming charm, if I could tweak the incantation, like so\u2026\u201d\nMcGonagall stares at them, the words of her next sentence stuck in her open mouth. Snape raises an eyebrow as if to say, \u201cAre you seeing that?\u201d\nMcGonagall closes her mouth with a snap, a mischievous glint In her eyes. She silently points her wand at the sandwiches. A couple floats in the air and shoots into Dumbledore's and Harry's mouth, cutting Dumbledore in the middle of his sentence.\nHarry takes the sandwich out of his mouth. \u201cHey, what's the big idea?\u201d\n\u201cJust a little bit of defying gravity,\u201d McGonagall replies airily, \u201cand making sure\nyou\ndon't disappear in a vacuum.\u201d\nDumbledore has the grace to look sheepish. \u201cYou're right, of course. Let's pause for lunch, Harry, then we can continue.\u201d\n\u201cLunch?\u201d comes Flitwick\u2019s squeaky voice. \u201cIt's past dinner. What are you doing here?\u201d\nFlitwick sneaks a look at the parchment as Harry splutters.\n\u201cDinner? But we just had breakfast!\u201d\n\u201cOohh,\u201d Flitwick exclaims. \u201cA freezing and banishing charm hybrid would\u2014\u201d\nSnape groans. \u201cThey need dinner, not another lunatic!\u201d\n\u201cWho's a lunatic?\u201d A jolly voice comes from behind them.\n\u201cLet me through, let me through,\u201d Sprout mutters, pushing at Snape and McGonagall still standing in the doorway.\n\u201cPomona, talk some sense into them!\u201d McGonagall says, throwing up her hands.\nProud looks at the trio behind Dumbledore's desk. \u201cOh dear. So that's where Harry's been. Someone ought to let his friends know.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone seems to be busy right now\u2026\u201d Snape says, turning toward the stairs.\n\u201cOh no, you don't,\u201d McGonagall warns. \u201cthey don't need traumatising.\u201d\nSnape looks mutinous but assents. His eyes dance around the occupants of the room, looking for someone to take his anger out on.\n\u201cPOTTER!\u201d\nEveryone jumps, falling silent.\n\u201cBut the gravity charm will interfere with\u2026\u201d\n\u201cALBUS! Have you looked at the\ntime\n?\u201d McGonagall's voice belies her frustration.\n\u201cWhy, of course,\u201d Dumbledore says mildly. \u201cIt was lunch a while ago. Could be about evening now.\u201d\nThere's four thumps as all the heads of House smack their heads. Dumbledore and Harry look concerned.\n\u201cEr, no offence,\u201d Harry says, \u201cbut are all okay?\u201d\n\u201cNo, we are not,\u201d Snape snaps. \u201cDidn't you know, Harry Potter is missing.\u201d\n\u201cOh no!\u201d Harry exclaims. \u201cWhere?\u201d\nSnape groans as Harry looks around, searching for \u2018Harry Potter'.\nMcGonagall falls into a chair. \u201cI give up.\u201d Sprout pats her shoulder sympathetically.\n\u201cYou're all barmy.\u201d Harry shakes his head. He turns back to the parchment. \u201cBut we have to consider the time aspect\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMr. Potter,\u201d Flitwick interrupts, drawing Harry's eyes to him. \u201c\nTempus.\n\u201d\n1:08 float in the air.\n\u201cOnly?\u201d Harry says in surprise. \u201cThere's plenty of time!\u201d\n\u201cPast\nmidnight\n, you dunderhead! Has gravity lost hold on you? Because your brain seems to be in space!\u201d\n\u201cBed,\u201d Dumbledore says, rolling up the parchment. \u201cWe'll return first thing tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps Harry ought to go to classes, Professor Dumbledore?\u201d Sprout reminds gently.\nDumbledore turns to Harry in surprise. \u201cYou missed all your classes!\u201d\n\u201c\nNow\nhe gets it,\u201d Snape mutters. Sprout shoots him a glare which he ignores.\n\u201cI'm hungry,\u201d Harry replies, finally eating the sandwich in his hand.\n\u201cSo am I,\u201d Dumbledore says, also starting to eat. \u201cAhh, the elves have really outdone themselves, haven't they?\u201d\nMcGonagall clears her throat for attention, but Dumbledore doesn't take notice.\n\u201cAlbus\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes my dear?\u201d Dumbledore asks, picking crumbs from his beard.\nMcGonagall gives him a pointed look.\n\u201cYes, yes, of course.\u201d Dumbledore turns to Harry. \u201cWe'll work on it in your free periods.\u201d\n\u201cAfter completing your homework,\u201dMcGonagall adds.\n\u201cIs that really\u2014\u201d Dumbledore protests, but four pointed glares change his mind and he acqisses. \u201cAfter your homework.\u201d\nThe next day, when Harry enters Dumbledore's office after breakfast, there is a strange clock on his desk.\n\u201cMinerva\u2019s way of making sure we don't lose track of time,\u201d is Dumbledore's explanation.\nHarry shrugs, pushing it out of his mind. \u201cSo, I had been thinking\u2026\u201d and they're off, both talking over each other.\nAn hour later, a voice shrieks at them. \u201cGravity is not real! Gravity is not real!\u201d\n\u201cOh no!\u201d Harry groans. \u201cNow we have to start over.\u201d\n\u201cIt's alright,\u201d Dumbledore assures him. \u201cIt's only the alarm. Classes are starting.\u201d\nHarry sighs, packing up, and promises to be back as soon as he can.\n\u2026\nA week later, Voldemort opens his eyes, feeling well-rested after a long time.\n\u201cBath,\u201d he commands with his eyes closed.\nNothing happens.\n\u201cBlasted Elf.\u201d Voldemort opens his eyes.\nHe stares around in disbelief.\nHis bed is on a rocky surface in the open air. There's nothing at all as far as Voldemort can see, except for the sidetracked beside the bed. On it is a piece of parchment.\nDear Voldie\nNot to worry, you are on the moon. Your lungs are getting oxygen from the earth, so you will survive. You only have to say the food you want, and you will get it within the hour.\nTo move without gravity, cancel the sticking charm, then cast the anchor charm to the place you want to go. The incantation is\nviverra.\nEnjoy your retirement!\nVoldemort puts the parchment down in disbelief. \u201cNYYAAAAAAAA!\u201d"

        "writing_prompt": "A young boy, convinced he knows everything about cooking, meets a professional chef who introduces him to a single word that changes how he sees the kitchen\u2014and himself.",
        "story": "Harry knew everything about cooking.\nEve\nrything.\nYou just had to look at the evidence to know it was true. None of Harry's classmates could cook an egg, let alone cook a meal. Some couldn't even make toast!\nHarry knew even more than Aunt Petunia. Why else would all the cooking fall to him? Thus, Harry knew everything about cooking.\nThat was why Harry was so confused as he watched the guest speaker cooking an omelette. She had a weird accent, but Harry was completely sure the word she was saying was \u2018season\u2019. And yet, Harry had never heard that word before.\n\u201cCan you see how it has gotten firm on the top, not so runny?\u201d The cook, Mrs. Chopra, asked the school, tilting the pan to show the egg. The class murmured various forms of assent. \u201cSo we will fold it gently, and\nvoila\n! You have a delicious omelette!\u201d\nMr. Lewis, their principal, started clapping his hands and the rest of the school followed his example.\n\u201cNow,\u201d Mrs. Chopra said, once the applause had died down. \u201cI, along with my team, will be cooking an omelette for each of you. If any of you have any questions, come forward to the cooking station.\u201d\nThere was a flurry of movement and sound as the students started chattering excitedly, moving away in groups. Harry watched some students go to the front, but most went towards the playground, determined to make the most of their unexpected break.\nHarry bit his lip, and then after a moment of hesitation, jumped off his chair and made a beeline for Mrs. Chopra.\nMrs. Chopra had a stern face which made the curious children decide to speak with one of the other guests. Harry thought she had kind eyes, and was only too glad not to have to fight with the other children for his turn.\n\u201cMrs. Chopra?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d Mrs. Chopra turned to him, her eyes crinkling around the edges. \u201cDid you enjoy the presentation?\u201d\nHarry nodded solemnly. \u201cBut I didn't understand a word that kept coming up. What do you mean by \u2018season your food\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cA very good question,\u201d Mrs. Chopra said, deftly cracking an egg into a bowl. \u201cSeasoning refers to the spices that go into your food, such as salt, pepper, chili, etc.\u201d\n\u201cOh! I didn't know it was called that! I never forget to season my food!\u201d Harry said proudly. Then his face fell. \u201cBut I can't cook as well as you, Mrs. Chopra. You're so fast, and you haven't spilled anything!\u201d\nMrs. Chopra's eyes danced with amusement. \u201cI disagree. I couldn't even make tea at your age.\u201d\n\u201cSo can nobody in my class,\u201d Harry said, brightening up, \u201cbut I cook every day!\nAnd\nseason my food, even though I didn't know it was called that.\u201d\n\u201cBy the time you get to my age, you will be a professional cook,\u201d Mrs. Chopra encouraged. She folded the egg and plated it, offering it to Harry. \u201cHere is an omelette, especially for you. Come sit by me and tell me about the things you cook.\u201d\nHarry beamed, taking the egg and sitting on a chair nearby. He basked in the attention, chattering to Mrs. Chopra about roasts and pies and pudding.\nMaybe Harry didn't know\neverything\nabout cooking, but he knew enough."

        "writing_prompt": "After weeks of enduring Umbridge's cruel detentions, Harry's hand refuses to heal, and Snape unexpectedly takes notice. What happens when the professor's sharp tongue is paired with an uncharacteristic act of care?",
        "story": "In the stillness and silence of Umbridge's office, Harry sat writing his lines. All that could be heard was the scratching of the Quill and the occasional meowing of Umbridge's cat portraits. Harry almost felt like he was in a dream, about to wake up soon.\nAlmost. The pain in his hand stopped him from falling into the dreamlike state completely. A pity, as perhaps the time would pass faster.\n\u201cThat will do.\u201d\nHarry dropped the quill with a silent sigh of relief, resisting the urge to clutch his injured hand. Umbridge held out her hand for her usual inspection, and Harry offered it, eager to be done. His bed in the dorm was like a siren, calling him to fall into the nothingness it brought.\n\u201cSame time tomorrow,\u201d Umbridge said, and Harry had a sudden urge to punch the smile off her face permanently. Almost as If she could hear his thoughts, her smile widened. \u201cAfter all, it hasn't sunk in just yet, has it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Professor.\u201d\nFinally, his hand was released, and Harry grabbed his bag and dragged himself out of the office and to Gryffindor Tower.\n\u201cThere you are! She kept you for much longer than usual, didn't she?\u201d\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Harry said tiredly, dropping into a chair in front of the fire. The usual bowl of dittany sat on the table, and Harry soaked his hand gratefully. Hermione watched anxiously.\n\u201cIt's still not healing properly.\u201d\n\u201cBetter than nothing,\u201d Ron said. \u201cYou can't risk Snape again, Hermione.\u201d\n\u201cAgain?\u201d\nHermione turned pink. \u201cI wanted to see if there was something stronger than dittany in Professor Snape's stores, but\u2014 well, he caught me.\u201d\n\u201cOh no! What happened?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, actually. He told me that the only reason Dittany wouldn't be working was if something was preventing it, and\n\u2018I'd better not hear you have been using Dark Magic, Granger.\u2019\n\u201d\n\u201cNo detention?\u201d Harry asked disbelievingly.\nHermione shrugged. \u201cI still don't understand what is wrong with dittany. We know the quill is not the problem as it was healing before. Why isn't it now?\u201d\n\u201cIt works enough,\u201d Harry mumbled, eyes closed. \u201cEnough for me to be able to\u2026\u201d\nHe was asleep before he finished the sentence.\nWhen Harry woke up, the bowl of dittany had fallen to the floor and there was an awful crick in his neck. His hand was throbbing dully and he lifted it up to look at it with bleary eyes.\nThe words were swollen and disfigured, and Harry could only make them out because he knew what it said. Harry touched it slightly and hissed at the burn, dropping his hand. Firmly pushing it out of his mind, he picked up the bag that he'd dropped the night before and settled down to do his homework. He doubted he would manage to finish even one essay, but he couldn't bring himself to care.\nHe changed his mind later that morning as he looked up at Snape's angry eyes.\n\u201cDetention, Potter. After dinner.\u201d\n\u201cCan't,\u201d Harry said. \u201cGot detention with Umbridge.\u201d\nSnape's lips thinned. \u201cAfter, then. Or is that too late for Mr. Celebrity?\u201d\nHarry could have argued that he did need to sleep, but he just didn't have the energy. Instead, he just nodded and started on his potion, ignoring Hermione's furious inquiries.\nAfter dinner found Harry back in Umbridge's office. It had been two hours, and Harry was dreading the long detention still ahead of him when Umbridge spoke.\n\u201cThat will do.\u201d\nHarry looked up in surprise. Umbridge had a sour look on her face that reminded him of Aunt Petunia.\n\u201cProfessor Snape could not find any other time for your detention, but you\nwill\nmake it up to me, Mr. Potter.\u201d\nHarry squashed down his disgust. \u201cOf course, Professor.\u201d\nHardly believing his luck, Harry started the long trek to the dungeons. Why did Snape's office have to be so far away?\nFinally, Snape's door appeared, and Harry lifted a heavy hand to knock on it.\n\u201cCome in!\u201d\nHarry pushed the door open with considerable effort.\n\u201cYou are late, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cJust back from detention,\u201d Harry said, too tired to glare. There were a few dozen cauldrons stacked in the corner, and Harry headed for them, before Snape's voice stopped him in his tracks.\n\u201cDid I say you were to do cauldrons?\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry turned to Snape. \u201cWhat am I going to do then?\u201d\n\u201cLines.\u201d Snape smiled cruelly.\nHarry stared. Since when did Snape have him do lines?\n\u201cWell?\u201d Snape snapped. \u201cGet on with it.\u201d\nFeeling like he was dreaming again, Harry sat down on the chair. Thankfully, the quill besides the parchment was a regular quill.\n\u201cWhat should I write?\u201d\n\u201cWhat should I write, Sir?\u201d\n\u201cI must do my homework on time.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Harry bent down to begin his lines, but he could still feel Snape\u2019s eyes on him.\n\u201cWhat is wrong with your hand, Potter?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry asked, confused. \u201cNothing.\u201d\nHe put the quill down and held up his hand for emphasis.\nSnape's brow furrowed. \u201cDo you think me a fool? Other hand.\u201d\nHarry reluctantly opened the left hand towards Snape, palm up. Snape yanked at it and turned it over, and Harry winced.\nIt looked even worse than it had in the morning. The whole area was bright red so that the harsh words couldn't be seen anymore, and bright yellow splotches were visible.\n\u201cHave you tried dittany?\u201d\nHarry looked back at Snape\u2019s sharp voice. He looked even angrier than normal, which was saying something.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry shrugged. It worked in the beginning, but slowly it just\u2014 stopped.\u201d\n\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d Snape asked, summoning a jar. Harry caught sight of the label as it flew into Snape's hand \u2014\nAntibacterial Aloe Cream.\n\u201cDunno,\u201d Harry said. \u201cA month, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cAre you feeling cold? Or feverish?\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry muttered, looking at Snape's desk. He felt exposed, and if his hand hadn't been so tightly held by Snape, he might have run off.\nFinally, Snape released his hand and drew his wand. Harry tensed.\n\u201cA diagnostic Charm.\u201d\nSnape waved his wand and Harry felt a warmth spread through him, which left as quickly as it had come.\n\u201cHow shocking. You have an infection. When did you last eat?\u201d\n\u201cDinner,\u201d Harry mumbled.\n\u201cLet me define eating, then. It refers to the act of putting food in your mouth, chewing, and swallowing it. Keeping that in mind, when did you last eat?\u201d\nHarry shrugged, going red with embarrassment.\nSnape sighed. \u201cYou have detention every day \u2014\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d Harry protested, his anger flaring up. \u201cWhat for?!\u201d\n\u201c\u2014 After dinner,\u201d Snape continued, speaking over him. \u201cYou have been unnaturally disruptive, and this is the only time I can spare out of my busy day to oversee your detentions.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Oh,\u201d Harry said, understanding. \u201cAlright, thanks.\u201d\n\u201cDo not thank me, Potter. The Wizarding World would self-destruct if they were to lose their celebrity. It is entirely self-interest, I assure you.\u201d\nHarry stared. Harry might be feeling hazy, but he was sure Snape had just made a joke.\n\u201cNow,\u201d Snape said, summoning a vial. \u201cA mouthful every morning and evening. Now get to bed, immediately.\u201d\n\u201cThe detention,\u201d Harry protested.\nSnape raised an eyebrow. \u201cDo you want to write lines?\u201d\nHarry blushed. \u201cNot particularly.\u201d\n\u201cThen get out of my sight.\u201d\nHarry stood up and turned to leave.\n\u201cThe vial, Potter.\u201d\nToo embarrassed to look at Snape, Harry snatched the vial and fled."
