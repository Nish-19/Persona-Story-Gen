That\u2019s the first edition. I can\u2019t believe you have it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m actually surprised no one wanted this sooner because Miss Marple is a fan favourite of Christie\u2019s works.\u201d Velma closed the gate. \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, and you tell me what the other book is that you thought might be a first edition.\u201d Hermione quirked her eyebrow.\n\u201cOh, yes.

They brew the best coffee and doughnuts in the area.\u201d Velma steered her to the left.\n\u201cBrilliant.\u201d Hermione smiled as they walked down the street.

The wizarding war had just ended, and she was angry at her father for his behaviour during it. So, the Doctor whisked her away.\nLuna rolled over and cuddled into the Doctor\u2019s body. \u201cMmm, my cuddly teddy,\u201d Luna mumbled in her sleep.\nThe Doctor quietly chuckled at Luna as she tightened her arms around her. She noticed that Luna felt chilled, so she moved her hands up to help warm her up. The Doctor realized that she needed to keep her love warm. She will need to fix the heat on the TARDIS later.\nLuna burrowed herself into the Doctor\u2019s body and threw a leg over hers. \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u201cI know, and you know it as well.\u201d The Doctor kissed her forehead. \u201cAre you warm enough?\u201d\nLuna happily sighed as she snuggled even more into the Doctor. \u201cYes, you are my snuggle bug.\u201d\n\u201cI should fix the TARDIS.\u201d The Doctor tried to move, but Luna wouldn\u2019t let her up.\n\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t going anywhere, my love.\u201d Luna tightened her arms around the Doctor\u2019s waist.\n\u201cAlright, my moon.\u201d She settled more into the bed, shifting Luna slightly before pulling the sheets up around her. \u201cWarm?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Luna kissed her neck. \u201cI\u2019m so glad that you took me away from England for a while.\u201d\n\u201cI am too, Luna.\u201d The Doctor kissed her head. \u201cYou helped me get through some things from my past.\u201d\n\u201cYou are welcome, my love.\u201d Luna burrowed. \u201cI know I need to go back sometime and help them recover from this war, but I just needed a getaway before I threw a wobble at my father and made it into a kerfuffle.\u201d\n\u201cYes, you do need to return eventually, but that\u2019s the great thing about this glorious machine: we can come back at the same time you left or a couple of days later if you want.\u201d The Doctor rubbed Luna\u2019s back, \u201cbut we don\u2019t have to talk about it right now.\u201d\n\u201cMmm\u2026brilliant idea about coming back a day or two later so I won\u2019t be tempted to try to change something within the final battle.\u201d Luna snuggled into her breasts. \u201cI love how warm and comfy you are.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d The Doctor gently squeezed her arms around Luna. \u201cOnce I fix the TARDIS, I am going to take you to someplace fun before we go back to Earth.\u201d\n\u201cWith animals?\u201d Luna\u2019s voice sounded hopeful.\n\u201cWe can go to a planet full of animals.\u201d The Doctor murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll ask TARDIS where it is.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, or a place full of books.\u201d Luna noticed that the Doctor froze. \u201cWhat?\u201d Luna looked up into her eyes.\n\u201cNo Library, please.\u201d The Doctor begged.\n\u201cOI!\u201d Luna shifted her body to stare into the Doctor\u2019s eyes more. \u201cI\u2019m never going to force you to go back to a place that was a bad memory. My friend, Hermione, would be disappointed, but I will never force you.\u201d\nThe Doctor relaxed once again. \u201cThank you, my moon.\u201d The Doctor kissed her lips sweetly.\n\u201cOf course, my love.\u201d Luna caressed her cheek before laying her head down on her chest. \u201cLove our snuggling time.\u201d\n\u201cMe, too. Let\u2019s get some sleep. In the morning, we\u2019ll fix the TARDIS.\u201d The Doctor shifted Luna to her side so she could spoon her.\n\u201cGood night, my love.\u201d Luna tilted her head to get a kiss from the Doctor.\n\u201cGood night, my moon.\u201d The Doctor kissed her forehead before tucking the sheets around them. She enjoyed having Luna in her arms as she rested for the night."

Hermione shook her head. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cBecause they would have taken me out of here.\u201d Hermione looked up at her pleadingly. \u201cThey are still threatening it in the letter.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want me to send your parents a letter explaining what happened?\u201d The professor inquired.\n\u201cNo, I will talk to them after the year is through.\u201d Hermione sighed.\n\u201cIf you run into problems, please message me, and I will come to help.\u201d Minerva patted her hand.\n\u201cThank you, Professor McGonagall.\u201d Hermione smiled.\n\u201cYou are welcome, Miss Granger.
