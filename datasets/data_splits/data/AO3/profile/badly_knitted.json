        "story": "\u201cThis is all JJ\u2019s fault,\u201d Dee muttered sourly, his voice rough. His nose was so clogged up he was having to breathe through his mouth, which was making his throat dry and sore, although that might also have something to do with the bad cold he was currently suffering. \u201cShould be a law against people comin\u2019 to work when they\u2019re sick.\u201d\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t have the luxury of staying home when they\u2019re infectious,\u201d Ryo reminded his partner. \u201cIf they don\u2019t work, they don\u2019t get paid and then they can\u2019t pay their bills.\u201d\n\u201cJJ don\u2019t have that excuse. He\u2019s independently wealthy. Comin\u2019 in here coughin\u2019 and sneezin\u2019 all over everybody, spreadin\u2019 his misery around!\u201d\n\u201cHalf the precinct\u2019s been out with colds or the flu recently,\u201d Ryo pointed out. \u201cWe\u2019re shorthanded. I\u2019m sure JJ would\u2019ve preferred to stay home until he felt better. Besides, aren\u2019t you being a bit of a hypocrite? You came to work.\u201d\n\u201cThe difference bein\u2019, I\u2019m not sneezin\u2019 on people and I\u2019m makin\u2019 sure to wash my hands or use sanitiser.\u201d Dee was taking pains to catch his sneezes in tissues, not wanting to infect anyone else with his germs. \u201cJJ threw himself at me and sneezed right in my face!\u201d\n\u201cHe apologised.\u201d\n\u201cSO not the point! Told him often enough I don\u2019t want him jumpin\u2019 all over me, tryin\u2019 to kiss me, even when he\u2019s not germ central, but he never listens. Maybe I should\u2019a called the CDC on his ass!\u201d\n\u201cI think the CDC has more important things to do than rounding up people suffering from the common cold.\u201d Ryo sounded amused.\nDee glared at his partner. \u201cThought I could at least count on some sympathy from you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m being plenty sympathetic. I got you tissues, orange juice for the vitamin C, cold meds, painkillers, throat lozenges, and a bunch of other things. I even fetched you chicken noodle soup for your lunch.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you did, and I\u2019m grateful.\u201d Dee paused to sneeze into another tissue, then blew his nose, sounding like a foghorn. \u201cDamn. My nose is so sore I prob\u2019ly look like Rudolph.\u201d\n\u201cJust a bit. Have you been using the cream I gave you? It should help with the soreness.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d Dee slathered his hands in sanitiser again, then downed the rest of his OJ in a couple of gulps.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more in the refrigerator if you want it, unless someone else has been drinking it. I got a six pack.\u201d\n\u201cI owe ya. I promise if you get this frickin\u2019 cold, I\u2019ll take care o\u2019 you just as well.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt it. Think you could manage to maybe do a bit of work now? Or are you going to just sit there while I do it all, because if that\u2019s the case, you should\u2019ve stayed home.\u201d\n\u201cNah, I can work, but maybe you should deal with any phone calls, so I\u2019m not sneezin\u2019 and splutterin\u2019 all over the receiver. Don\u2019t wanna accidentally infect the next person uses it.\u201d\n\u201cSounds fair. I\u2019m not sure most people would understand what you\u2019re saying right now anyway.\u201d\nDee spread soothing cream over his sore nose and grimaced. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re prob\u2019ly right. I should just sit here and suffer in silence.\u201d Picking up his pen, he focused blearily on his paperwork. \u201cJJ is SO gonna pay for this; I will get my revenge if it\u2019s the last thing I do.\u201d\nThe End"

        "story": "Dee had known it would be difficult, Ryo being away in D.C. for a few months, working with the Sea Hag, but it was a good career move, and he hadn\u2019t wanted to stand in his lover\u2019s way. It wasn\u2019t as if it would be permanent, no more than twelve to fifteen weeks, but he\u2019d grown accustomed to Ryo\u2019s company at work, and spending two or three nights a week together. Now he felt like he was missing a limb.\nHe kept reminding himself that it must be at least as tough on Ryo, who would be missing Bikky too. The house ape was staying with Carol and her aunt while Ryo, was away, something both Dee and the boy had been relieved about at the time, but by this point Dee would have welcomed even the brat\u2019s company. They could have commiserated with each other over how much they missed Ryo.\nIt wasn\u2019t even as if Dee was spending all of his time alone. He was working with the same bunch of guys as he always did, minus his partner of course, and he knew he was welcome to hang out with them when the workday was over. At the end of their shift, he\u2019d even joined them at the bar a few times for a couple of beers before heading home, but it wasn\u2019t the same, and he always wound up leaving early.\nThat was no better, because it just meant going home to an empty apartment and another night alone, or going to Ryo\u2019s place to check up on things there and mope the night away surrounded by reminders of everything he was missing. Every room in Ryo\u2019s apartment held memories of laughter, arguments, lovemaking, or just hanging out and talking. He missed that simple companionship most of all.\nThe worst part of it was that he couldn\u2019t skip over to Washington on his days off, or even talk to his lover on the phone, because Ryo was working on an undercover assignment. Spacey was keeping Dee apprised on how things were going, and he grudgingly admitted to himself that he owed her for that, but it still chafed that the man he loved was so far out of reach. He longed to hear Ryo\u2019s voice, to the point that he\u2019d even taken to calling his lover\u2019s home phone every night, just to listen to the message on his answering machine. How pathetic was that?\nTime was, Dee had relished the single life, free from many of life\u2019s responsibilities, being able to play the field, love \u2018em and leave them. Since meeting Ryo though, the solitary life had lost its appeal. More than anything he wanted to fall asleep in his lover\u2019s arms every night, and wake up beside him every morning, preferably for the rest of their lives.\nFive weeks down, at least another seven to go, and Dee was beginning to wonder if he\u2019d survive the enforced separation. His world had never felt so empty. Yet he knew if another such career opportunity came Ryo\u2019s way, he\u2019d still encourage his partner to take it. He never wanted to be the reason Ryo turned down a potentially career-making assignment. As much as he hated being without his baby, he had to put Ryo\u2019s ambitions ahead of his own selfish needs. His lover deserved nothing less. If it meant being a solitary guy for a few weeks, he\u2019d just suck it up and deal.\nAnd when Ryo did finally return to New York, Dee was gonna make sure his lover knew exactly how much he\u2019d been missed. He was already planning their reunion, and it was gonna be epic.\nThe End"

The crime scene they were currently leaving was mercifully free of blood and gore, the victim having been strangled, but somebody was still dead.\n\u201cSorry, just thinkin\u2019 you\u2019re lookin\u2019 very color-coordinated today; your nose matches your sweater.\u201d\nIf anything, that just deepened Ryo\u2019s frown into a scowl. \u201cWhat d\u2019you expect?

What\u2019s up? Are ya comin\u2019 down with my cold?\u201d\nRyo sighed. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. Sorry, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s nearly Christmas and another family\u2019s lost a loved one. It\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not, so we\u2019ll find out who\u2019s responsible and make sure they pay the price. It\u2019s what we do.\u201d Dee studied his lover. \u201cDoesn\u2019t change the fact that your nose matches your sweater. How come ya don\u2019t have a scarf today?\u201d\n\u201cBikky couldn\u2019t find his this morning, so I let him take mine.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot. Probably deserve a dad of the year award, but still an idiot; the kid\u2019s gonna be indoors most of the day, and here you are, out in the cold for hours, freezin\u2019 your nose off!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cYour nose says otherwise.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the car now, it\u2019ll soon warm up, along with the rest of me.\u201d Ryo rubbed his nose with a gloved hand.\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll get cold again next time we haveta go anywhere!\u201d\n\u201cI can myself a new scarf on my way home tonight.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not gonna help ya the rest of the day though, is it?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll survive. Let\u2019s get back to the precinct; maybe we won\u2019t have to go out again today.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019re the chances of THAT happenin\u2019?\u201d Dee grumbled as he started the engine.\n\u201cSlim, but we can hope.\u201d\n\u201cHope\u2019s \u2019bout all we do in this job. You wanna stop for coffee on the way back?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, that would be good.\u201d\nThe following morning, Ryo arrived at work early, wearing his new scarf. When Dee arrived a short while later, wrapped up well against the freezing temperatures, he was holding a small parcel, which he dropped on his partner\u2019s desk.\n\u201cHere ya go.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\u201cOpen it and find out.\u201d\nShrugging, Ryo did as suggested; inside, on an elasticated strap, was a red knitted triangle like a tiny hat, complete with bobble. \u201cWhat on earth\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nose cosy,\u201d Dee explained. \u201cGot myself one too. Lowering his scarf, he revealed his nose, covered in black wool and tipped with an eye-catching green bobble. \u201cWhaddaya think?\u201d\nFor a long moment Ryo could only stare; then he burst out laughing. \u201cYou can\u2019t wear that for work!\u201d\nDee grinned. \u201cFor emergency use only, I swear. I figured we could keep \u2018em in our coats, just in case of lost scarves, or for when we need a little extra protection. Try yours on, make sure it fits. If it does, I\u2019ll have my neighbour make ya a few more. Gotta have spares.\u201d\nBlushing slightly, Ryo slipped the band over his head and settled the nose cosy in place. It was surprisingly comfortable, not to mention warm.\n\u201cHow do I look?\u201d\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d Dee grinned. \u201cRed\u2019s always been a good color on ya.\u201d\nThe End"

        "story": "They\u2019d had big plans for a tropical getaway in the middle of the New York winter, two weeks, or even just ten days, somewhere the sun was always shining, the weather was blissfully hot, and all they had to do was swim in the sea or laze on the beach. It would have been bliss, and yet here they were, still in New York; they hadn\u2019t even gotten as far as making reservations and booking airline tickets, which was just as well under present circumstances.\nRyo sighed heavily. \u201cSo much for our vacation.\u201d\n\u201cTell me about it.\u201d Dee followed his lover over to the sofa in their apartment, collapsing onto it with a heartfelt groan. \u201cJust think, if it hadn\u2019t been for a run of bad luck, we could be soakin\u2019 up the sun in paradise instead of soakin\u2019 up the cold and freezin\u2019 our asses off in the middle of the worst snowstorm to hit the city in over twenty years. We should\u2019a booked back in December instead of decidin\u2019 to wait until the New Year.\u201d\nAll flights in and out of New York and New Jersey had been cancelled since the storm hit three days earlier, the heavy snow, ice, and gusting winds rendering the runways at all three airports unusable.\n\u201cWhat good would that have done?\u201d Ryo tucked his legs under him on the sofa to keep his feet warm in the chilly apartment. He\u2019d turned the heating up as soon as they\u2019d come in, but it would take a while for the increase in temperature to become noticeable. \u201cWe still wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to go, would\u2019ve had to cancel and probably lose our deposit. In a way we\u2019ve saved money by waiting to book.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and then spent it all on fixin\u2019 my frickin\u2019 car, among other things.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault the transmission had to be replaced. Parts break down, no matter how well you\u2019ve taken care of your car, especially with the roads being in such bad condition. Just be glad the axle didn\u2019t get broken too.\u201d\n\u201cI am, believe me, but we could\u2019a done without that expense, on top of helpin\u2019 Mother with her medical bills.\u201d\n\u201cHer health is more important than a vacation, and besides, all leave\u2019s been cancelled anyway. It\u2019s all hands on deck, with everyone working overtime.\u201d\nAs if the bad weather and unexpected bills weren\u2019t enough to deal with, the NYPD was currently investigating a series of violent home invasions, hampered by the fact that it was cold and flu season. So many people were out sick that every precinct in the city was shorthanded, and most of those well enough to work were pulling twelve-hour shifts.\n\u201cGuess I should be grateful we\u2019re gettin\u2019 overtime pay. Maybe in a few months we\u2019ll have our savings back where they were before everything went to hell.\u201d Dee shifted closer to Ryo, wrapping one arm around his baby, pulling him close and kissing the top of his head. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry we didn\u2019t get to paradise. Maybe next winter we\u2019ll have better luck.\u201d\nLeaning his head on Dee\u2019s shoulder, Ryo smiled. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to fly to a tropical island resort to find paradise, Dee; it\u2019s right here. As nice as a couple of weeks of sun, sand, and sea might have been, as long as we\u2019re together I don\u2019t need anything else.\u201d\n\u201cYou really mean that?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. The most luxurious tropical getaway ever would be meaningless without you there.\u201d Ryo sat up and leaned in for a kiss. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m hungry. Makes me glad I put stew in the slow cooker this morning before we left for work.\u201d\nDee sniffed the air, smiling in anticipation of a hot meal to chase away the wintery chill. \u201cYou\u2019re full of good ideas like that.\u201d He unfolded himself from the sofa and offered his hand, pulling Ryo to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll help ya with the dishin\u2019 up.\u201d\nAs he followed his partner into the kitchen, Dee thought over what Ryo had said, realising he was right. Being with his amazing lover, sharing their life together, the bad parts as well as the good, was better than paradise, because it wasn\u2019t just a once in a while thing, it was every day. He could go without expensive vacations, and everything that went with them, because he already had the one thing he couldn\u2019t do without, the man he loved with all his heart.\nThe End"

Even havin\u2019 a change of clothes in our lockers isn\u2019t enough in weather like this. We get soaked, go back to the precinct, get changed, go out again, get soaked again, but this time we don\u2019t have anything dry to change into.\u201d He stared gloomily through the windshield at the pouring rain.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got umbrellas.\u201d\n\u201cWhich aren\u2019t gonna be any use at all if we haveta chase anyone.

We could say we couldn\u2019t find this guy, and we\u2019ll give it another try tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll probably still be raining tomorrow; all we\u2019ll have done is put off the inevitable. Besides, if we arrive back at the precinct dry, Chief Smith will know we\u2019re lying.\u201d\n\u201cWe just can\u2019t win, can we?\u201d\n\u201cNope. Guess that means we should stop procrastinating and get on with our job.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe if we just give it another ten minutes the rain might stop.\u201d Dee leaned forward and peered out the window, trying to see the clouds overhead; there was no sign of them breaking up anytime soon.\n\u201cOr the rain might get heavier, and the guy we\u2019re after might spot us and slip away without us noticing.\u201d\n\u201cWhich wouldn\u2019t go down well with the old badger.\u201d Dee groaned.\n\u201cIf we have to chase our suspect and he gets away because of the weather, we can at least tell the Chief we tried our best.\u201d\n\u201cI guess.\u201d Grimacing, Dee pulled on a woollen beanie, turned his coat collar up, and took leather gloves out of his pocket. \u201cSuppose we\u2019d better show willin\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll come quietly,\u201d Ryo said, adjusting the hood of his coat so that, hopefully, it wouldn\u2019t come off if they had to give chase.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Dee drawled. \u201cLike that\u2019s ever gonna happen.\u201d\nExchanging one last look of mutual commiseration, they shoved the car doors open and plunged out into the deluge.\nThe End"

It was way below freezing out, everywhere was covered in a layer of ice, and there would probably be an advisory come morning for everyone to stay home if at all possible. The last thing the local emergency services needed was more bad accidents and stranded travellers to deal with.\nUp until a few hours ago, Ianto had been hoping Jack would suggest they stay home as well, safe in the warmth of their cosy penthouse flat. But then the power had gone out, and the howling gale raging outside just seemed to be sucking all the warmth out through the walls. If it kept up, soon it would be as cold indoors as it was outside.\nThey should have been fine, the generator in the basement should have kicked in as soon as the power went off, but it was either out of fuel, had developed a fault, or the sudden drop in temperature had caused it to seize up. Whatever, they had no power, no light, no heat, and no chance of even boiling the kettle for a hot water bottle or two. He and Jack might well freeze to death right there in bed, with every blanket they owned already piled on top of them.\nIt had been the cold that had woken them, alerting them to the loss of power. Just getting out of bed, braving the bitter cold to fetch the spare blankets, had left them both shivering and they\u2019d burrowed back under the covers as quickly as they could. But by then they were half frozen, the bed was cold, and they\u2019d huddled together, teeth chattering, trying to rub some warmth into each other.\n\u201cThis is ridiculous!\u201d Ianto mumbled against Jack\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cTell me about it.\u201d Convulsive shudders racked Jack\u2019s body. Over the past century or so he\u2019d acclimatised to British weather, to a degree, but he\u2019d spent his early years on a world that was mostly desert, and he still hated the cold. Ianto suspected that was the main reason he wore his greatcoat so much of the time. \u201cHow can it be this cold? We\u2019re in Cardiff, not the Arctic!\u201d\n\u201cYou know what Tosh said. Climate change affecting weather patterns, and an ice storm getting pushed further south than usual thanks to the prevailing wind.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not getting any thanks from me,\u201d Jack muttered. \u201cMaybe I should fetch my coat from downstairs.\u201d\n\u201cThat would mean getting out of bed again,\u201d Ianto pointed out. \u201cYou haven\u2019t warmed up yet from the first time.\u201d\n\u201cIt might be worth it. I could fetch a few pairs of socks too. And those jumpers your sister gave us at Christmas.\u201d\n\u201cI might even be willing to wear one.\u201d Ianto was cold enough that even the hideous matching green sweaters, each decorated with a large, fuzzy Christmas pudding, suddenly seemed appealing.\nWhile they were still trying to get up the courage to go in search of more clothes to put on, their bedroom door swung open, then closed again, so quietly that neither man was aware they had company until something large and fluffy found its way into bed with them.\n\u201cNosy!\u201d Ianto suddenly felt horribly guilty. He\u2019d completely forgotten that the Fluff was now living with them. It had its own room on the flat\u2019s lower level, complete with bunkbeds. \u201cAre you cold too?\u201d\n\u201cHumm,\u201d the alien denied, squeezing in between its human friends, and arranging itself like a cross between a fur-covered body pillow and an enormous teddy bear.\n\u201cOooh!\u201d Jack wrapped his arms around their unexpected bedmate. \u201cIt\u2019s so warm!\u201d\nOn Nosy\u2019s opposite side, Ianto snuggled close, feeling heat radiating out of the Fluff. It was better than any number of hot water bottles, and he tucked his frozen feet under a thickly furred loop of the snakelike body.\n\u201cSaved by the Fluff.\u201d Ianto smiled in the darkness; he\u2019d already almost stopped shivering.\nIn the morning, whether or not the power was back, he and Jack would have to do something about fixing the generator, but at least tonight they wouldn\u2019t freeze thanks to their alien friend.\nForget about dogs or cats; happiness was a warm Fluff.\nThe End"

        "story": "A haze of traffic fumes hung over the freeway, something Dee would have scarcely noticed a few short years ago but which now made him frown.\n\u201cGreat, more air pollution; just what we need. Like we don\u2019t get enough of that in the city.\u201d Since quitting smoking, he\u2019d started to really pay attention to air quality, probably because he could smell the difference now that his nose was no longer numbed from the constant stink of cigarette smoke.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be out of it once we get off the freeway,\u201d Ryo said, lounging in the passenger seat.\n\u201cIF we ever manage to get off.\u201d Dee\u2019s eyes were fixed on the taillights of the car in front, impatiently waiting for it to move forward again. \u201cWe\u2019re barely movin\u2019. How far to the next exit?\u201d\nRyo sat up straighter in his seat, looking ahead past a seemingly endless line of cars, then twisted around to look back the way they\u2019d come, his keen eyes searching for road signs, but not seeing any.\n\u201cNot sure, couple of miles maybe?\u201d\n\u201cDamn! The rate we\u2019re goin\u2019, probably take us an hour or more. Should\u2019a taken the last exit we passed.\u201d\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know there were tailbacks ahead, and the freeway\u2019s usually the fastest route.\u201d\n\u201cNot today it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s like everything\u2019s conspirin\u2019 to keep us from gettin\u2019 outta the city.\u201d\n\u201cTechnically we\u2019re already out.\u201d Ryo gestured back over his shoulder. \u201cNew York\u2019s back that way.\u201d\n\u201cFor all the good that does us. We\u2019re still chokin\u2019 on fumes instead of breathin\u2019 fresh country air.\u201d\n\u201cIt never used to bother you.\u201d\n\u201cOnly \u2018cause I didn\u2019t know any better. Now I do, and this sucks. The rate we\u2019re movin\u2019 right now, the weekend\u2019s gonna be over before we get anywhere.\u201d The car ahead mover forward maybe ten yards and Dee slipped the Charger into gear, creeping forward. He checked the righthand lane and flicked on his turn signal, inching across when there was enough of a gap to squeeze his car into. \u201cWe\u2019re gettin\u2019 off at the next exit, and I don\u2019t care if that adds a few miles. At least once we\u2019re off the freeway we can wind the windows down and breathe.\u201d\n\u201cFine by me.\u201d Ryo smiled, sliding back down in his seat. He preferred travelling the smaller roads anyway; the scenery was better.\nHalf an hour later, they were gliding down the off ramp, leaving the grey haze behind them. Ryo could practically see the tension draining out of his lover as they picked up speed.\n\u201cNow that\u2019s more like it! We got the open road ahead of us, and hardly a car in sight!\u201d\n\u201cDo you even know where you\u2019re going?\u201d\n\u201cNope, you\u2019ll haveta dig out the map and navigate, so we don\u2019t wind up gettin\u2019 lost.\u201d\nLaughing, Ryo fetched the map book out from under the seat. \u201cI can do that.\u201d\n\u201cCabin in the mountains, here we come!\u201d Dee whooped. Winding the window down, he breathed deeply. Already the air tasted so much better.\nThe End"

        "story": "\u201cYou\u2019re always at work,\u201d Rhiannon complained when she finally managed to get her brother on the phone.\n\u201cI have a job,\u201d Ianto replied patiently. \u201cA job that requires me to actually be at work every day. Not everyone gets to work from home or set their own hours.\u201d\n\u201cI know that! But every time I call you, you\u2019re at work. Doesn\u2019t matter what day it is, or how late it is, you\u2019re always there. Don\u2019t you ever get a day off?\u201d\n\u2018Not if I can avoid it,\u2019 Ianto thought to himself. For him, taking a day off meant coming back to three times the amount of work, and half of his colleagues complaining about not being able to find what they needed. Either that, or they\u2019d blow up his phone all day asking where to find things and he\u2019d get no peace at all.\n\u201cSurprising as it may sound, not all jobs are nine to five, Monday to Friday. I have responsibilities outside of regular office hours.\u201d\n\u201cAt a tourist information office? Pull the other one, it\u2019s got bells on.\u201d\nUnseen by his big sister, Ianto rolled his eyes. He didn\u2019t enjoy lying to his family, but it was as much for their safety as it was for his own. \u201cI have a lot of paperwork to do, brochures and schedules to order, and I need to keep up to date on all local events. That means on my own time I have to go out and view the attractions so I can better inform the people who come to me for information. And it\u2019s not like I can hire a cleaner, so all the cleaning and maintenance falls to me as well. There\u2019s a reason I got an award from the Welsh Tourist Board.\u201d He smirked to himself; the little trophy and framed certificate were very nice, although he\u2019d donated the cash prize to charity.\n\u201cYou got an award?\u201d\n\u201cYep! Second year running.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d care. You\u2019ve made it abundantly clear you don\u2019t approve of my career choice.\u201d The fact that he actually worked for Torchwood and the tourist office was more of an incidental sideline was immaterial. \u201cI take my work very seriously.\u201d The Torchwood side of things especially, but like the old saying went, if a job was worth doing, it was worth doing well, and he wasn\u2019t about to slack off on any aspect of his work.\n\u201cOf course I care! I just think you could do better. You were always the smart one of the family.\u201d\n\u201cI enjoy my work, Rhi. It\u2019s varied, and I get to meet a lot of interesting people.\u201d Some of them weren\u2019t even human. \u201cI would think you\u2019d be happy that I\u2019m doing something I enjoy. Anyway, I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t call me just to complain that I\u2019m always working.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, I didn\u2019t.\u201d A long silence followed.\nFinally, Ianto asked, \u201cWell? Why did you call?\u201d\nRhiannon sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten,\u201d she admitted sheepishly.\nThe End"

        "story": "Now that he and Dee are\u2026 not merely dating but in a committed relationship, everything should be different, but it\u2019s not. Bikky and Dee still don\u2019t get along, and the boy acts like the two adults are being gross if they so much as touch each other, never mind kiss. It\u2019s unreasonable, but it makes Ryo uncomfortable being affectionate with his lover when his foster son is around.\nDee says Bikky will get over it, which is probably true; given enough time, he\u2019ll learn to accept that this is how things are, and they\u2019re not going to change just because a twelve-year-old kid doesn\u2019t approve. Unfortunately, knowing that at some time in the future Bikky will come to terms with him and Dee being together doesn\u2019t help Ryo right now.\nHe doesn\u2019t know whether it\u2019s homophobia on Bikky\u2019s part or just a profound dislike of Dee in particular, but whatever it is, it\u2019s putting Ryo off, and maybe that\u2019s the whole point. Maybe Bikky thinks that if he keeps acting up, Ryo will eventually decide that being with Dee isn\u2019t worth the grief he\u2019s getting. Well, if that\u2019s the case then it\u2019s not going to work.\nRyo had thought long and hard before accepting not only his own sexuality, which he\u2019d fought against for as long as he could remember, but the fact that he was in love with Dee and likely had been for a long time. Even that first kiss, unwanted at the time, had made him feel things he\u2019d never felt before, and there\u2019s no way he\u2019s giving up what he\u2019s found with Dee. For the first time in his life, he\u2019s in a relationship that feels right, natural, honest\u2026 He\u2019s happy, and as much as he loves Bikky, he\u2019s not going to let the boy dictate who he dates.\nOkay, yes, having Bikky glaring at them all the time is less than fun, but keeping his distance from his lover when the boy\u2019s present won\u2019t do anyone any good. So after dinner, when Dee offers to help him with the dishes, he doesn\u2019t pull away when his lover puts his arms around him from behind. Instead, he turns his head to meet Dee\u2019s lips in a slow, gentle kiss, and when Bikky starts making disgusted noises, Ryo ignores him.\nIt's not as if they\u2019re making out hot and heavy on the sofa, groping each other; Ryo would never do that, not if he knew Bikky was home and might see, but that doesn\u2019t mean he and Dee should completely avoid kissing and touching.\nWhen the kiss ends, Dee lets him go and Ryo turns back to the sink, gets on with washing dishes while Dee dries and puts everything away. They make coffee and settle on the sofa to watch TV, and as Ryo leans against his partner, with Dee\u2019s arm around him, he pretends not to see Bikky\u2019s scowl.\nHe still feels awkward and uncomfortable, but like Bikky, he\u2019ll just have to get over it.\nThe End"

It\u2019s rainin\u2019, in case ya somehow managed to miss that little detail.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026 But\u2026\u201d JJ looked down at his stylish designer clothes, now soaked all down the front, and tried ineffectually to wipe himself off, before realising he was only making it worse. \u201cMy cute outfit! I have to go change.\u201d Turning on his heel, he scurried away to the locker room, leaving the man of his dreams still dripping.\nTurning to his partner, Dee managed a wry smile. \u201cY\u2019know, it\u2019s almost worth gettin\u2019 drenched just to see the expression on JJ\u2019s face.\u201d Like JJ had a few minutes earlier, he looked down at his sodden clothes. \u201cBut only almost. Feels disgustin\u2019.\u201d\nFor a long moment, Ryo didn\u2019t say a word, just stared at Dee in disbelief. Finally he found his voice. \u201cHow on earth did you manage to get so wet? Did you forget your umbrella?\u201d Dee was usually better organised than that, ready for whatever the weather might throw at him, knowing how unpredictable conditions could be in spring.\n\u201cOddly enough, no, which is why my hair\u2019s still mostly dry. I was doin\u2019 fine, a bit damp around the ankles but nothin\u2019 major. Then I stopped at a crosswalk, waitin\u2019 for the lights to change, and some damned delivery truck goes barrelin\u2019 past way too fast, straight through the biggest rainwater puddle in the whole frickin\u2019 city and\u2026\u201d Dee shook his head. \u201cIt was like bein\u2019 hit with a tidal wave. I would\u2019a stepped back, but there were too many people standin\u2019 behind me, waitin\u2019 to cross. They were lucky, pretty sure I got the worst of it.\u201d\n\u201cPoor Dee.\u201d Ryo looked torn between sympathy and laughter. \u201cHadn\u2019t you better go and change into something dry?\u201d All cops knew to keep a couple of changes of clothes in their lockers, just in case; police work could be messy.\n\u201cYeah, I will in a minute, just don\u2019t wanna be alone in the locker room with JJ, both of us gettin\u2019 changed. Kinda think I\u2019m gonna need to shower first anyway. I had to walk eight blocks like this.\u201d\nRyo wrinkled his nose. \u201cUgh.\u201d He could just imagine how Dee must have felt as the icy rainwater soaked through to his skin, chilling him. \u201cYou must be freezing!\u201d There was a bitter wind blowing.\n\u201cYeah. Just hope there\u2019s some hot water left.\u201d Dee sighed. \u201cHope we don\u2019t haveta go out until the rain stops. For once, I think I\u2019d rather stay in and do paperwork.\u201d\nThe End"
