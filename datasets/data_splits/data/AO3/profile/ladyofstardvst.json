        "writing_prompt": "Haunted by the scars of his past and the weight of his choices, Fenris wrestles with his disdain for magic and his growing love for someone who believes in saving the very thing he fears most. What happens when loyalty, love, and conviction collide?",
        "story": "Fenris cannot begin to imagine how it would feel to betray you.\nHe thinks about the possibility sometimes, during the sleepless nights he spends among the ruins of his old life. The pull of his anger seems fueled by the ghost of Danarius, haunting him through old journals written in his hand, or aging books he finds with his old master's scrawl pressed into the margins. A house crest on an old tunic here, an heirloom Tevinter antique there. The memories are not so loud now, so fresh, but they still scratch and scream and loom with every dull ache from the lyrium kissing his skin, even if its only in his subconscious.\nAnd yet, his ire is projected onto you, in the silent moments. He\nknows\nbetter than to dwell on them, knows that you of all people will be by his side to the bitter end. It was, after all,\nyou\nwho took his hand and kissed the ache away from his knuckles on the eve of Danarius's final demise. You, who took up his cause alongside yours, without a question, without hesitation, without a doubt. You, in all your graceful, graceless beauty extending your hand to him again and again and\nagain\n, never once wavering in welcoming him into your little chaotic family.\nHe recalls how he has fearlessly died for you, without a hesitant thought of his own. How he's carried you home and dressed your wounds after excruciatingly rough nights when the weight of the world rests oh, so heavy on your shoulders. He does this, without even wondering why he stays until you fall asleep, a book cradled in his bruised hands by the fire. Fenris, who is wary of your friendship with Anders, worry settling deep into his bones that one day you'll live to regret the kindness you extend to him on faith and grace alone - when the Abomination gives you nothing but half truths and the promise that you're far better off not knowing the extent of his heart.\nAnd yet, he is no fool blinded by heartache and this new feeling of steadfast loyalty. He has to choke down a pull from an old vintage bottle hidden in the depths of the wine cellar as he realizes - and not for the first time- that even with his deepening disdain for magic and apostates and Magisters, he could never imagine smashing all he has built here to pieces.\nThis is home, now, whether he fully realizes it or not.\nYou\nare his home, in all your stubbornness and your passive aggressive optimism that maybe - by some miracle of\nany\nkind - this battle could end in anything other than bloodshed. It's in these moments especially, that Fenris begins to wonder if it's not you, truly, who he blames - but himself, at the root of it all. He, who has sworn to protect not only himself, but others from the wrath of magic used in unholy ways. And then, of course, he comes to Kirkwall and falls in love with someone who wishes to help the Circle instead of hinder it.\nHe comes to this conclusion as he's greeted by the bottom of the bottle and a swift knock on the weathered front door of his estate. And, quick as they come, all those thoughts slither away back to their shadows as you enter. The door clicks closed behind you, and Fenris simply stops. Stares. Almost drops the bottle hanging loose and precarious from his fingertips. Moonlight shines down into the foyer through filthy, filmy windows, illuminating your silhouette in a glowing halo of silver divinity. It's a sight he's seen a thousand times, yet he's always knocked breathless by the beauty radiating from you eternally, incandescently. Especially when you're fighting side by side, covered in unmentionable ruin.\nHis name falls through your lips, soft and gentle and kind as you meet him where he stands in the middle of the room. His eyes immediately soften and his posture relaxes the closer you come to touching him. He reaches for you on instinct, palm coming to graze your cheek in a gentle caress, with a heart bound to beat right out of his chest. The sting of aged wine is long forgotten. Thoughts of treachery and betrayal are distant memories from a lifetime ago. It's nothing he'll ever think about again, he thinks, because\nhow could he\nwhen you're so impossibly bewitched with\u00a0 one another?"

        "story": "Sometimes it surprised you, how quickly you had fallen. You were spellbound, in a fantastical sense. Reckless, in a cynical sense. Heartfelt, head over heels in the wild sort of way that only makes sense, regarding matters of the heart.\nWhen the sun began its slow crawl onwards the horizon, there was a\nclink\nsomewhere by your bedroom window.\nYou paused.\nNothing but silence beyond the glass, nothing but the low hum of Dokken softly killed the calm inside. It had been a long day, you realized, so -\nNo. There it was again.\nAnd again.\nAnd\nagain\n.\nThe vinyl sleeve hanging from your fingertip slipped through to rest on a bed - half made, the clothes worn to work blending seamlessly into the chaos as eyebrows scrunched together.\nTowards the window you went, eyes seeing nothing but the old brick building next door, ivy climbing up eaves and curling around window panes with ease. The streets were quiet for a summer evening, but the wind slipping through the screen was sweet.\u00a0 The air was becoming a shade of pastel pink that begged to be touched, cried out for company to kiss under its glow.\nIt was peaceful, finally, the summer of \u201886. The reminder pulled your ribs in tight with a sharp tug, and another heavy wave of relief threatened to buckle your knees. Your fingers went to graze the ribcage scar courtesy of the Demobats themselves -\nThat never happened though, thanks to the rock soaring through the air, its trajectory sailing perfectly for your face.\nA yell.\nA perfectly timed duck for cover.\nClink\n.\nA laugh, echoing up, up, up through the window from the alley below.\nYou knew that laugh. Missed that laugh.\nFell in love with that laugh.\nThe screen slid out and you swore its sharp creak had joined in to mock you with the laughter from below.\n\u201cWhat the\nfuck\n, Munson?\u201d\nHis laughter dies down, an echoing cackle in the sleepy neighborhood. Golden sunlight lit up the smile he saved only for you, when he straightened from the hunched over crouch he fell into during the laughing fit.\nBrown eyes drifted up to find you, leaning casually out the window. The rosy air slipped glasses over his eyes, and he swore you weren\u2019t as irritated as you looked. If he wasn\u2019t mistaken, the corners of your lips were fighting to stay down.\nAnd so Eddie bows, raises his eyes just so, and meets the eyes that have enchanted him with every waking moment since you had met.\n\u201cI beg your forgiveness, your majesty. I only wished to steal a moment of your time, if I may.\u201d\nYou feigned disinterest, turning your gaze from the knight before you, rising to survey the grounds to your kingdom.\n\u201cAnd if I forgive you for wasting my time and giving me cause to fear for my life?\u201d you called down. \u201cHow do you intend to right these wrongs, good ser?\u201d\nEddie had to catch his breath before he could answer. Regality hugged you tight, in the way serenity painted your features was beautiful in this waning, blushing light. A smile, graceful and bright won against your frown, when your eyes settled on him once more.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Munson? Cat got your tongue?\u201d"

        "writing_prompt": "In a crumbling, forgotten tower, you and Prince Aemond steal a rare moment of solace, contemplating the weight of duty, the bitterness of fate, and the fragile warmth of a love hidden from the world.",
        "story": "In a long forgotten tower, two lone figures contemplated a tear in the fabric of their lives.\nThey lounged on a narrow staircase, dirty and crumbling with age. Dust motes drifted through the air from abandonment. Honey gold streams of sunlight illuminated the floaters through two cloudy window panes above them. It was a challenge to make out what the design in the stained glass used to be, through the grime. Cracks spiderwebbed from a single focal point where something smashed through it long ago; yet this accident is what provided them with the most light.\nSilence, heavy with reality painted the air they breathed. It was a discomfort. It was a wakeup call. It was the only moment they could slip away like this, for a while.\nA sigh escaped your lips, shaky with the weight of a life forever changed in an instant - though not for the better. You began to wonder if anyone\u2019s life changed for the better, anymore. Maybe someone, somewhere, was draped across another set of stairs in another far off place with their lover, like you did now. Only it wasn\u2019t the fate of the realm they were contemplating, but something lovely. Something kind. Something worth celebrating.\n\u201cAegon is going to be king.\u201d\nIt felt like a sin, to speak the words aloud.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nA pause.\n\u201cYour idiot brother -\u201d you cut yourself off, upon feeling Aemond tense - hardly noticeable, had he not been stretched on the stone before you, chest pulled back against your own. His fingers began to toy with your hands clasped around his waist. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t find his own\ncock\nif it wasn\u2019t attached to his body.\u201d\nThe tension in the stairwell lessened at your jest. It became less frigid, less ominous, when the prince himself gifted you mercy wrapped in a silver bow. Effortless laughter sung through the darkness and brightened the sunlight illuminating the gloom\u2019s restless cage. Though short lived, and quiet as it was - it was a moment you would come to cherish.\nThis moment\nwas now imprinted upon decaying stone, the song of the prince\u2019s laughter to live on in this disrepair forever.\n\u201cBe that as it may,\u201d a trace of lightness remains in his words. You feel idle patterns drawn on your leg, tension slowly easing with Aemond\u2019s hushed words. \u201cHe will sit the Iron Throne with mother\u2019s guidance, and we will all bear witness to the fool emboldened with power from a kingdom\nhe doesn\u2019t want.\n\u201d\nBitterness poisons the air once again. Aemond relaxed farther into you, safe from listening little birds here. No one knew about this place. No one knew this is where you came, when life grew heavy with the burdens of living.\nAnother pause.\nCarefully crafted, should have been the words that fell through your lips - except times are desperate now, and you and Aemond had never hid behind the games of court. Not with one another.\n\u201cIt should be\nyou\n. The realm would\nthrive\nunder your rule.\nYou\u2019re\nthe one guiding your family through the dark with the Queen.\u201d\nAemond hums. The drawing on your leg ceases, replaced by a palm sliding up your thigh to give a gentle squeeze.\n\u201cDesire for a crown has plagued your mind, has it?\u201d\nIt\u2019s unexpected, the laugh abruptly rolling off your tongue. It\u2019s a sweet sound, your laughter. Familiar.\nWarm\n. Aemond allows himself an easy smile in the dark.\n\u201cAbsolutely not. You know I have no lust for the weight the Queen carries.\nBesides\n-\u201d your hand rests upon Aemond\u2019s, his thumb absently stroking your thigh. \u201cI enjoy our life together with little more than what is expected of us.\u201d\nLips brush his cheek. Aemond leans into your touch, head tipping back with the intent to kiss you\nproperly\n, before duty beckons him back from this moment held out of time.\nIt\u2019s gentle, when his lips meet yours. Hands intertwined wherever they lay, reassurance gliding silently from skin to skin. A moment belonging to you and Prince Aemond alone; a balm over old wounds that may reopen anew."

        "story": "There was always something magical about the world, once dusk arrived.\nEven when it seemed the entire universe had fallen sideways, and your life had been placed on pause - if only temporarily - there remained, under the battered, stained surface of your story, an unmistakable awe that lingered at the fraying edges; a kind of raw beauty impossible to miss.\nEven if you weren\u2019t searching for it, if you weren\u2019t mindful of it staring right back at you point blank, so aggressively\nclose\nto your face - it seeped in through the cracks. Always, lately, when it was the least expected, and, honestly? When it was most\nunwelcome\n.\nThis evening was a stunning example, really.\nThe sun had begun its fall into the night, dipping down behind wispy clouds and tree branches that reached tall and desperate, if only to feel the last kiss of the sun\u2019s dying rays until dawn. Golden fingers fell through the canopies of their leaves scattered along the property, painting the ground in shadowed filigree patterns across tall, deep green grass.\nThose wispy clouds had gone from feather gray and lily white to become beautifully stained with the palette of the sunset. Golds, deep oranges and radiant mauves were shining bright where the colors blended with the deepening violet of the sky above.\nAnd yet,\nup\nis not where you were looking this time.\nHe was illuminated in the glow of stray sunbeams, rocking gently on the porch swing hidden around an alcove on the front porch - a charming detail that set this particular safehouse apart from the rest - in time with the gentle breeze. It ruffled the pages of the book held open in one hand - gloved, always - while the other remained draped across the back, next to him.\nIt had jarred you, the first few days the two of you had been here, just how peaceful someone could look when removed from the harshness of the field. The contrast of something so simple as\nquiet\n\u2026it was different here. Everything was. Now, though, you had come to learn that this was just Simon being\nSimon\n. He had shed the skin of\nGhost\n, slowly, if not hesitantly, the longer you were holed up far away from any front line.\nThe mask, however, was not so quickly cast aside.\nRegardless, that didn\u2019t stop you from admiring how Simon looked in the sunlight instead of shadows.\n\u201cYou gonna keep fuckin\u2019 starin\u2019 at me, or can I help y'with something?\u201d\nFuck.\nYour recovery was quick, if not a little rushed, when you realized his brown eyes had risen from the pages to narrow at you instead.\n\u201c\nYeah\n, Riley, you can fuckin\u2019 help me with something,\u201c you snort for good measure. \u201cTake your fuckin\u2019 tea before I burn the shit outta my hand, would ya?\u201d\nHe sees through it, anyway.\n\u201cGive it \u2018ere, then,\u201d gloved fingers wiggle in your direction, the arm draped across the swing reaches toward you.\nYou step to fill the remaining gap, the sun\u2019s tendrils of gold slipping over you as you do. Bright flashes blinded you through the trees as you held a steaming mug out towards Simon. Gloved fingers brushed gently, quickly, over your own.\nWhile you were busy trying not to drop the mug or go blind -\npermanently\n, this time - Simon\u2019s eyes hadn\u2019t left you. The descending sun had gifted you with a halo, bright, bold, and\noh\n, so divinely ethereal he had to focus on his breath, had to tighten his grip on the mug, the book, had to feel the solid wood of the weathered bench beneath him to stay\ngrounded\nbecause -\nFuckin\u2019 Christ\n, he couldn\u2019t look away.\nSimon Riley had never been a religious man, but seeing you all glowing golden radiance inspired him to fall to his knees and\npray\n.\nHe didn\u2019t know what the fuck he\u2019d say, didn\u2019t even know if you would answer whatever fell through his lips, but he knows he\u2019s never seen you like\nthis\n.\nRelaxed. Peaceful. Makin\u2019 him tea just how he liked it, for no fuckin\u2019 reason. You\u2019ve done that often enough in the past couple of weeks that he knew it wouldn\u2019t be scalding, wouldn\u2019t be burnt or too strong. None of that extra, frilly shit would be tainting it either.\nThat\u2019s something he liked about you. How you paid attention to the people you\ncared\nabout -\nSimon freezes.\nOh\n."

        "writing_prompt": "On a quiet, snowy night in Skyhold, you find solace on the battlements, lost in thought under the stars. But when Cullen finds you, his warmth and gentle words remind you that even the Inquisitor doesn\u2019t have to carry the weight of the world alone.",
        "story": "The battlements were quiet that night.\nTorchlight shone faint in the darkness. The range between the dying embers had grown long and sparse where a sentry was not required. Absolute darkness reigned wholeheartedly, where repairs to the old crumbling masonry had not yet been completed. Only the starlight kept you company here, on this stretch of stone that had become yours and yours alone. Moonlight\u00a0 illuminates the heart you allow to bleed on your sleeve in the presence of no one but the Maker, Andraste, the Elvhen gods of old.\nSkyhold was at peace, after such a harrowing win. A raging celebration had cloaked your base from the stables all the way to Leliana\u2019s aviary - a collective exhale, finally, breathed new life into not only the Inquisition itself, but those supporting the cause you had, once upon a time, questioned on your own. It was infectious, this taste of victory, especially when the road to get here was long and cruel and tedious. Roaring fires have calmed to kindling now, the rest of the Keep not too far behind for the night.\nThere was still much to be done, but this night provided a vital respite that no one seemed to oppose.\nIt was a calm thing, at such an hour so late. The pathways up into the depths of the stronghold were occupied by the occasional pair, group, lone survivor stumbling to bed in their own corner of the castle.\nYour time was your own, now - and by the way Bull kept sliding rounds of Maraas-Lok your way - it was a welcome thing, slipping away from your friends. Dawn was fast approaching, and you hoped to at least have your head about you when the time came to greet it. Sleep sounded a welcome way to temper the evening, but - exhausted as you were - it would never stay for long. So, here you came. Slipped away through the shortcut passages that were less traveled, less well known among those that weren\u2019t under your direct chain of command.\nNot many knew to look for you here. Save Cole, because he was\nCole\n. He watched over you, here at Skyhold. Out of sight, always, but without a doubt, at your back nonetheless. Leliana, of course - the Nightingale was\nspymaster\nof the Inquisition for a reason. And, finally -\n\u201c\nOh\n, I - there you are. I\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d\nCullen\n.\nSo lost in your thoughts as you were, with your gaze tipped up, up,\nup\n, towards silver-lined clouds wisping over bright constellations and velvety darkness alike. The steady breeze gliding over your skin had a calming effect this evening. Gentle as it was, a natural balm to any sleepless night, especially on the worst ones. You hadn\u2019t realized this serenity had been broken by heavy footfalls on stone, and, hidden by the wind swirling past, was the familiar rustle of the fur cloak he never went without.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I leave you fast asleep in my quarters?\u201d\nStarlight painted a smile upon your lips, and you wore it with all the grace and beauty of the Divine. Cullen had to stop, when your face turned from the heavens to him, down here on Thedas. If it weren\u2019t for the brisk mountain air grounding him here and now, he would be drifting away, lost in the radiant presence of the Inquisitor -\nhis\nInquisitor. A smile began to rise upon his lips, and he ducked his head in shadow. A blush began to bloom, and he knew you wouldn\u2019t leave it be.\n\u201cYou did,\u201d he says to the stones. \u201cAnd\nyou\n-\u201d He steps closer, eyes tipping up towards yours, watching him. There\u2019s a glint in your eye; the one he\u2019s learned to mean\nmischief\n. At his expense tonight, no doubt. \u201c - slipped away without a trace.\u201d\nA small laugh escapes you, loud in contrast to the quiet of the night. Your hands drummed upon the chipped stone in front of you, an idle movement to occupy your body. You had become so much more restless, since you were crowned\nInquisitor\n.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to wake you.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t think I\u2019d notice you were gone?\u201d This time it was Cullen, who chased away the silence with a quiet laugh of his own. He reaches for you, a hand skimming along your spine. It\u2019s gentle, his touch, softer without the leather gloves always hugging his skin. \u201cMy love, I\nalways\nnotice when you\u2019re gone.\u201d\nYour smile is warm, his words taking root in your chest to grow a beautiful garden in your heart. As for it reaching your eyes, as it so often does\u2026\nCullen notices, of course, when it\ndoesn\n\u2019t.\nHis smile wavers, all space between you disappearing when you lean into his touch. Your name is quiet, when it leaves his lips. It\u2019s spoken with reverence, always his favorite prayer to sing even when you are no longer near.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d\nIt was unintentional, to laugh at his question. And yet, that didn\u2019t stop the sound from spilling into the night, swirling above with the snow that had just begun to fall. They were both gentle in delivery, the flakes weightless and fluffy as they shone bright in the rays of moonlight that remained. The clouds were thick and glowing now, heavy under the weight of unfallen snow. Your voice was loud in the darkness, loud in comparison to the quiet worry that Cullen always held for you.\nBut, the world had become heavy, even in victory. Leading the Inquisition came with a price you kept to yourself, most days.\nHeavy is the head\n, as they say.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have a choice\nbut\nto be, do I?\u201d\nHis touch stills, and you both turn your eyes out towards the darkness, out into the world beyond Ferelden, beyond Orlais, where trouble is no doubt lurking. Somewhere, it\u2019s hunting for you. It never stops.\nThe breath Cullen takes is unsteady, yet his tone remains soft.\nTender\n. \u201cIn front of the Inquisition? Your troops and allies? No, I\u2019m afraid not - the stakes\u2026 None of us have that luxery.\nThough\n-\u201d\nIt\u2019s gentle, when he pulls you into him. You breathe in the comfort of leather and sandalwood, the faint air of celebration and strong liquor still clinging to him for dear life. The hand that isn\u2019t holding you rises to rub circles along your back. Traces soothing lines down your side to twine his fingers through your own. It doesn\u2019t take long before you\u2019re burying your face into his furs.\nCullen says your name again, all quiet and warm and strong. \u201cYou have a choice with me.\nAlways\n.\u201d a kiss is pressed to your crown, and it lingers. Lingers.\nLingers\n. \u201cWith all of us in your council, really. Just as we know we have a choice around\nyou\n.\u201d\nToo soon are you creating space from one another, but Cullen is stepping back to tilt your chin up from the safety of him, to the uncharted glory of the sky. Snowflakes are swirling just a little bit quicker now, the wind coming to bite, rather than soothe. You bring your eyes down to meet his veiled amber gaze, breath shaking at the warm look he\u2019s giving you now. It\u2019s the one you\u2019ve seen only\u00a0 when you come home\nhurt\n.\nYou nod, the heaviness of your crown resting a little easier now. A little less heavy, but a little more snug. Cullen offers you a smile - something small, something\naching\n, and he begins to tug you forward by the hand. You don\u2019t fall into him again, because he\u2019s walking backwards in time with your steps, back the way he had come.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, love. What do you say we continue this back inside? It\u2019s getting a little too\ncold\nfor my taste.\u201d\nA smile of your own begins to take shape upon your lips. \u201cWelcome to the dregs of the Inquisition,\nCommander\n. Most of us don\u2019t have a shiny rack of Templar armor to cozy under, believe it or not.\u201d\n\u201cOh, is that what you think? That it is\nwarmer\nthan it is\ndreadfully heavy\n?,\u201d he tugs you harder with the next step, and this time he has to catch you so you don\u2019t trip. The noise of shock that pierces through the snowfall mixes with a laugh as Cullen keeps teasing. \u201cI brave the cold to find you, and then you twist your dagger where you can, hm?\u201d\n\u201cI\nsuppose\n-\u201d you begin. The grin spreading across your lips is coated in irony and dripping with sugary sweetness. \u201c- someone other than\nSera\nshould keep you on your toes. Unless, of course, you\u2019d rather I leave it all up to her and her bees-\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t like the bees?\u201d\n\u201cInquisitor.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201c\nMaker\u2019s breath\n- just - I - let\u2019s go inside.\u201d Cullen huffs, turning on his heels to leave you laughing in the face of the dark of the night. Snow was catching in his furs, his golden hair still glowing bright in the ethereal glow of snowfall - a beacon for you, in the darkness. The grip on your hand tightened, and you couldn\u2019t help squeeze back, laughing an apology as you finally kept pace with his strides.\nWhen you begin to shiver, the weight of a fur cloak is slung around your shoulders; the warmth burying you in a wave of peace - the first you\u2019ve felt in\nmonths\n- and you rode that wave all the way to your quarters through dawn."

        "story": "The diner was becoming restless.\nLast call was lingering just around the corner, and the last of the brave souls were getting nervous. There were still a few hours left of the night, before the sky began to lighten to slate gray, then navy blue, eventually reaching golden rays through the sleepy Indiana town - except it was no longer as sleepy as it used to be.\nWith the sun just out of reach, the commute home always felt longer than it actually was. Jumping at every midnight shadow slithering just past your eyesight - it was easy, now, for people to be afraid of every little thing. It kept them alert. Kept them\nexhausted\n.\nIt\u2019s been this way ever since the rumors began. Reports of attacks have been filed numerous times; they began a few weeks after Vecna had been chased into hiding. Yet, there was still tension in the air. The kind that was thick -\ngummy\n, almost, and hard as hell to shake.\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped all of it officially being chalked up to the symptoms of confusion. Mass hysteria, apparently, was why the whole town had stories of seeing all consuming shadows and a pair of glowing eyes. A few report hearing low laughter lingering in those very shadows. Some people say they woke up with blood staining the neckline of their clothes or pillows, yet no wounds were ever found. Nothing else was ever wrong, nothing out of place.\nYou and Eddie remained unbothered.\nExcept, of course, when night had fallen. Ever since the latest soiree into the Upside Down, and ever since Eddie came back\u2026\ndifferent\n, sleep wouldn\u2019t always come. And, to be honest - you didn\u2019t always\nwant\nit to come.\nThat\u2019s how you ended up here, usually. The two of you had been coming to the small diner ever since, on those long nights that seemed to drag out so long you couldn\u2019t remember what\ntired\neven felt like. The booth you occupied this time, was cozy in the back corner, though you kept yourselves\nseparate\n, always, from the rest of the late night regulars.\n\u201cMy sister said there was something crawling around her roof the other night.

It was heavy-like, she said, like its weight was almost too much for the roof to\ntake\n.\u201d\nEddie snorted into his fries. \u201cThey really believe whatever the hell they want, huh?\u201d\nHe loops fingers through yours over a sticky, canvas primed tabletop. Squeezes, when yours loop back through his with a kind of practiced grace; all effortless and tender in a gesture so small. His eyes drift from the plate of greasy crinkle cuts to the two guys still arguing at the counter up front.\nHe\u2019s amused, hiding a smirk behind another handful of fries he gracefully crams into his mouth. His teeth flash under the fluorescents. A chill sweeps fingers down your spine, cold and quick and merciless.\nYou shiver.\nEddie notices.\n\u201c\u2026 are they getting to you?\u201d\nA laugh catches in your throat, and you hide it with a nervous gulp of Eddie\u2019s milkshake. He frowns at your theft, so you take an extra sip with smiling eyes. Next thing you know, he\u2019s trying\u00a0 to kick you under the table, and\nmisses\n.\n\u201d\nHardly\n,\u201c you try not to cringe. \"They\u2019ll believe anything to keep their peace of mind, especially so soon after\u2026everything.\u201d\nHis eyes linger, letting them flash bright in the overheads when your attention falls down to the scraps of shared fries and mauled pie crusts spread between you. Eddie\u2019s known you for a while now. Has learned to read your posture and your tone - knew your tells almost better than any campaign he\u2019s ever had the pleasure of playing. This bothered you, the vampirism.\nMaybe not the act of Eddie becoming, being,\nembracing\nthis change, as much as\nwhat\nit demanded of him. Of you. Of the town. The Upside Down kept following you home. It had\neveryone\n, this time, always looking over their shoulders, feeling like easy prey for a pair of eyes that might not even be watching. This wasn\u2019t the kind of life you wished on anyone, because it was, in truth, a waking nightmare.\nYou would never tell Eddie any of this, and he knew that too.\nYet it was clockwork, the way conversation died out slowly, once the last call arrived on tendrils of wispy fog. Silence clung to the last few remaining patrons - either daredevils or\nidiots\n, you were never sure which - once the siren call beckoned them home. The sound of church bells rung loud here, the nearest parish only a block away.\n\u201cThat never stops being creepy as\nfuck\n,\u201d someone says, their voice hushed the nearer they come to the glass doors. It\u2019s the only thing between\nall\nof them and the - what was the cheesy name the Hawkins Post started using?\nThe\nHawkins Terror\n.\n(That\u2019s\nwhat they decided to call me? Have they no imagination?!\n)\nLike a glass door would stop Eddie, if he ever became that desperate.\nThe man was right, though. Hollow bells sounded from all four corners of the town proper, their cries of warning cutting full and lifeless through the valleys of town. It was eerie, the timing. Eerie, how often fog rolled in at this time of night at all.\n\u201cIt\u2019s\nshowtime\n,\u201d Eddie watched the rest of the patrons file out into the night. You didn\u2019t miss the way his lips quirked, or the way his eyes widened in anticipation of what was so close he could almost taste it. \u201cReady to go?\u201d\nYour hand slips out of his when he slides out of the booth, extending it once again in a lavish bow.\n\u201cLead on, you fucking dork.\u201d\nHe pulls you up with a flourish, pulls you into his chest and gives your cheek a soft kiss. It was all one swift move, practiced often and, of course, always on you. If this\nvampire thing\ndid anything for his ego, Eddie had no problems going with the flow of it,\nliterally.\nThe air was cold, when you stepped into the mist. Two locks\nclick\nmuted through the night behind you as fog hugs your body, kisses your skin and offers to escort you home. It\u2019s lifted enough to improve visibility, yet seeing too far down the road wasn\u2019t in the stars for the night.\nThey did seem to be hiding, after all.\n\u201c\nYou kids get home safe\n!\u201d\nIt\u2019s the guy from earlier - the one going on about his sister. He\u2019s watching Eddie open the van door for you, watching as you use Eddie for leverage to climb inside. He started doing this last week, and every night since. Makes sure you both get down the street before taking off like a bat out of hell towards his own destination.\nIt was heartwarming, the way some people still kept an eye on others, instead of just themselves. Just as quick as that thought broke through, it was always -\nalways\n- overcome by a creeping sense of dread. You never knew if anyone would go missing in the night. Never knew who would appear in the paper next, with a front page story recounting their hellish nightmare and bloody sheets.\nYour stomach turned over the fries, revolting against the implications.\n\u201cHave so far - you be careful too!\u201d you call back with a wave, before Eddie shuts you inside. The man sends a wave of his own - a streak in the gloom swallowing the quiet town whole. Eddie kept his mouth shut. Kept his eyes on\nyou.\nNeither of you spoke on the drive back to your apartment. Judas Priest fell through the speakers, filling the void when you had nothing to say. It was jarring, when the van brakes squealed loud enough to be heard over the music, as Eddie pulled to a stop. In the stillness, fog engulfed the van idling at the curb, blanketed in its impenetrable gray grasp.\n\u201cYou should probably get those checked.\u201d\nEddie huffs a laugh that you\u2019re pretty sure is meant to be more of a\nscoff\n. \u201cWhat, you\u2019re gonna tell me who to eat next?\u201d\n\u201c\nWhat\n? Jesus\nChrist\n, Eddie.\u201d\nHis hand slips to your thigh, and he gives a gentle squeeze. It wasn\u2019t easy for him, the feeding. He felt like he had finally become the monster Hawkins swore he used to be. You supposed he\nwas,\nbut he also\nwasn\u2019t\n. He had kept his heart, and kept his mind. He retained his memory and his morality and everything that made him\nEddie.\nThings were just\u2026 different, now. He just incorporated\nblood\ninto his diet, is all.\nHuman\nblood.\n\u201c\nNo\n, actually, I - I\u2019m\nsorry\n. It\u2019s - it\u2019s just getting harder to be\nin there\nwith everyone\ntalking\nand I can\u2019t\nsay anything, y\u2019know -\u201d\nYou cut yourself off. Eddie rubs a hand over his face. Squeezes your thigh just a little bit\ntighter\n. A shaky sigh fell through your lips, your head falling back against the headrest. Eddie doesn\u2019t say anything. Your voice was quiet, as you kept filling the silence growing over guitars and heavy bass lines.\nAnything\nto fend off the tension growing thicker and\nthicker\nbetween you. \u201cYou could always -\nyou know\n- try animals again? You\u2019re already avoiding half the town.\u201d\n\u201cWe already\ntried\nanimals.\nTwice\n. Did you forget how sick I was? I almost got us\ncaught -\n\u201d\n\u201cRight, right -\nyeah\n- sorry. You could - I mean -\nwell\n.\u201d\nA hesitation on your part. A hitch in breath on Eddie\u2019s.\nYour name falls through his lips, warm and desperate and\nhungry.\n\u201cDon\u2019t hold back on me now, sweetheart. I gotta go soon if I don\u2019t wanna fuckin\u2019 explode in a few hours.\u201d\nRight. The\nsun thing.\n\u201cWhat about -\nshit\n, I dunno. What about another\ntown\n?\u201d\nThe grip on your thigh goes slack.\nSilence builds. The tension became amplified in the small space. It rose, and rose, and\nsnapped.\n\u201cJesus goddamn Christ.\u201d\nYour head turned, eyes finding Eddie looking right at you. His expression was hidden, in the dark, but the glow of his eyes were not. \u201c\nYeah\n?\u201d\nHe takes a breath, eyes never leaving yours.\u201c\nYeah\n.\u201d\nMaybe Hawkins\ncould\nrest easy, if only for a little while."

        "writing_prompt": "The sunrise paints the sky in breathtaking colors, but all you can see is the blood on your hands and the man behind you, insisting you leave him to die.",
        "story": "Your nightmare started like this.\nThe sunrise reflected in the eyes of Simon Riley, and you knew this would be the last time you ever saw him. Brilliant pinks and bright cerulean blue looked back at you, instead of his unmistakable deep, warm brown. The colors streaked together adding plums and violets to the painting that would leave Claude Monet breathless with envy.\nThere was a pull of something strong, something sad coiling within the depths of your heart, yet you found it hard to care, hard to\nnotice\nwhen beauty such as this, rose tall above him to envelope you in the arms of a nightmare staged to be a dream. Golden clouds shone ethereal in the midst of the colors staining his irises, the sole collector of a piece so priceless he would only have to pay with his life. That didn\u2019t matter yet, when the sparkle in Simon\u2019s eyes was\nhis\nand his alone - the very ones, in fact, that enamored you so shamelessly every time you looked into them, no matter the color they were wearing.\nEventually, you woke up from that dream, unsure why it read like a nightmare, when the blood was staining\nyour\nhands, and not the ones cradling your jaw under the rising sun.\nAnd yet this time, there was no dream. This was slowly becoming a waking nightmare, and no one ever had a\nchance\nwith those. That distant, punch-drunk love was now accompanied by something else. Something\nother\n.\nSomething so\nincredibly familiar\nyou had to press\npause\non the subconscious chaos swirling too fucking fast as it roared loud enough in your ears; it even rivaled the soft thundering of the ocean rising into view.\nYou and Ghost crashed through the treeline and onto rocky soil, rocky sand, high tide just beginning to creep up the shore. It hit you then, when you stopped halfway down the beach. The uneven terrain had forced you both to slow down so you didn\u2019t\ngo down\n. It was a textbook lightbulb experience, in the moments that uneasy pace gifted your mind a chance to\ncatch the fuck up\n. You knew what it was, now. What had been gnawing at your nerves for the last half mile and why it seemed familiar, unsettlingly so.\nIt was the feeling from that dream months ago. That same pulling, that same coil of sadness wrapping itself a new home inside your heart, your stomach, flowing through your veins. Except it was accompanied by dread, now. The very same kind of quiet dread telling you this was truly a nightmare, when you swore it was a dream.\n\u201cGo.\u201d\nThat couldn\u2019t have been right. The water was so loud now, it was a strain to hear your own breathing. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you didn\u2019t hear me. Fuckin\u2019 go.\u201d\nThe arm slung around your shoulders pulled away, and Ghost leaned his weight on the leg without a tourniquet failing to do it\u2019s fucking job.\nHe speaks with steel, because he\u2019s\nGhost\nnow. The urgency of your lieutenant was dominating the pale shadow of tenderness lurking in the shadows, if you knew how to listen for it.\n(You heard it plain as day. Plain as the facts laid bare before you, yet you pretended not to see them.)\n\u201c\nGhost\n-\u201d\nThe rising sun, now beginning to peek over the writhing horizon, began to light up the spray of the ocean. If only you were surprised by this sudden streak of martyrdom - yet it was never sudden, not really. And he would not dare consider himself a martyr.\nGolden beams rose slowly and languid against a sky so vibrant, so haphazardly painted with the colors that mirrored your nightmare. You began to understand now, looking down at your hands. You were wearing gloves this time, but they were covered in blood all the same. All of\nthis\n- it was becoming hard to look at. Your hands jammed themselves in the first pockets they found.\nSoon enough, your eyes fell down, down,\ndown\nback to Earth, back to Ghost trying to keep off his injured leg.\nThat serpent of sorrow coiling surely around your heart constricted, something sharp and horrible when you remembered your shoddy medskills, how he would need a proper medic - and\nsoon\n- unless he preferred to see the shores of England again from a body bag.\nYour eyes slid to the spray quickly, all golden glitter sparkling in the sunrise, a precursor to the stars no doubt already waiting in the wings for their turn to grace the skies once again. And yet, you took none of it in. Not the tide inching closer and closer to your boots caked in muddy blades of grass and rock now stained with blood. Not the wild roar of the waves, gargantuan, almost, in the very near distance. Not even the way they reflected the sky painted above you in a palette so ethereal, Claude Monet would be breathless with envy.\nAll of it was lost, horribly muted among the cataloged scene of your extraction gone, no doubt, sideways. Ghost was shot. Your rendezvous had changed. Your team had been separated, all of you pursued, all of you trying to clear another day. And yet, all of this paled in comparison with the knowledge of Ghost -\nSimon\n- bleeding out way too fast and insisting that you fucking\nleave him.\nIf you were a perfect soldier, you would have done so immediately.\n\u201c\nDid I fuckin\u2019 stutter?\nGet out of here, meet the rest of the team -\u201d he cuts himself off, glances down at the pretty trail of blood he\u2019d been kind enough to leave behind. Simon looks to the ocean, endless and vicious and impossibly beautiful before him. Flashes from\nbefore\nbegin to greet him, an old friend that stopped coming by, long ago. \u201cI\u2019ll buy you some time.\u201d\n\u201cLike\nhell\n-\u201d\n\u201c\nThat\u2019s an order\n.\u201d it was rough, his voice. Harsher than usual, and trying like hell to hide something. You suspected, though pushing at this juncture would be unwise, and you knew better than to waste such precious time. It wasn\u2019t instinct, but you flinched anyway. All traces of training had begun to slip away seamlessly and disappear into the sea.\nPerhaps Price\nwas\nright. You should have listened when he advised you to reconsider accepting this assignment.\nNext to you, Simon pushed away the old memories, pushed away the weekend he spent on a beach nicer than this one with his nephew back home. It was harder to push away the evening he brought you to the North Sea to watch the stars rise and share their stories, one by glittering one. He tried to forget the way your eyes reflected starlight, tried to ignore the memory of your smile shining brighter than the moon had, once it rose to bathe the world in glory.\nBut, Simon had never been good at pushing you away.\nHe was dying, he guessed. Between the worry he learned to read on your face, the set of your shoulders, the argument you tried to raise. And, then, there was the wonder about what had broken within him so quickly, so unexpectedly to entertain these memories here, in the middle of a\nfucking mission\n, of all places.\nGhost\nhad learned to shut shit that off.\nSimon\n, it seemed, was succeeding on cracking the mask from\nwithin\n-\n\u201cOh, right. You\u2019re ordering me to\nleave you to die,\nthen\n? Is this how you want to throw away everything we\u2019ve grown to be?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re still feelin\u2019 fuckin\u2019 generous, you can make your grand rescue with the team, yeah?\u201d\nRight.\nRight\n.\nIt was a waste, the cruel beauty of the world squandered on a moment such as this. As the sun\u2019s rays broke through the last precious minutes of dawn\u2019s fading blue hour, you held Simon\u2019s gaze through the last rays of night. The sunrise was reflecting in the eyes of Simon Riley, and you knew this would be the last time you ever saw him. Brilliant pinks and bright cerulean blue looked back at you, instead of deep, warm brown. The colors streaked together adding plums and violets to the painting that would leave you cursing Monet\u2019s name until the day you died.\nThat didn\u2019t matter yet, when the sparkle in Simon\u2019s eyes was\nhis\nand his alone - the very ones\u00a0 enamoring you so shamelessly, even now, in the midst of the hardest thing you will ever have to do.\nHe reaches for you, and you reach back without a thought, without a care for the precious time you were surely wasting. Simon reaches for you, grabbing hold of your arm to tug you closer, your own gloved hand wrapping around his wrist, sleeve soaking through with blood. Ghost has gone now, melted away for a moment, leaving Simon one last minute of clarity with you, untainted by the sins of his past. When he finally meets your eyes, there\u2019s peace in them.\nYou feel fabric along your jawline, sliding gently to tilt your chin to face him fully. It\u2019s hard to see him like this - if only because it\u2019s happening anywhere other than behind your closed doors. Those beautiful eyes of yours drift shut, and the rustle of fabric on plastic drowns out the ocean, inches away now as the tide continues to rise.\nIt\u2019s something you\u2019ve memorized, the feeling of his lips brushing along yours. It\u2019s a comfort, a plea on your part how you kiss him back with everything you\nfeel\n, because words simply have no place here. For Simon\u2019s part, the gesture is repaid with all the familiar softness and desperation he holds, in this moment - an apology in the only way he knows how. An apology for\nwhat\n, exactly, you weren\u2019t sure.\nSimon felt responsible for so,\nso\nmany things.\nA moment passes, maybe two. Time slips by, a fictional figment that slows everything down and muddles your senses. You stay like this for as long as you dare, and then only a second longer before it\u2019s\nyou\n, who pulls away from him first. Tentatively, slowly, heart now fully entwined with that coiling serpent nestled permanently among your heartache. If you don\u2019t leave\nnow\n- it becomes clear to yourself that you never could. Then, all of\nthis\nwould have been for nothing.\nSo, you let go.\nSimon Riley slips through your fingertips, eyes hardening as he lets go of your jaw, the curve of your waist. You see it clear as crystal, when the sun\u2019s golden rays fall on the deep brown belonging to\nGhost\n, now, that this moment is all you have.\nHe braces on his good leg, mask sliding back into place and grip tightening on the only sidearm he has left. There\u2019s a nod forward, a playful glint warming up the cold depths of Ghost\u2019s eyes. \u201c\nGo\n.\u201d\nNightmares, you realize, are something you never truly shake. They linger, always, hiding in the shadows of a subconscious, or making a home in the forefront of your mind, always haunting, always taunting you for the rest of your life.\nYou harden yourself like Ghost taught you, and push everything down, down,\ndown\nthe fucked up rabbit hole you tumbled through of your own free will. \u201cGive 'em hell, Simon.\u201d\nWithout wasting a heartbeat, you turn and r\nun."

But tonight, something feels different\u2014tense\u2014and Jason\u2019s cryptic departure leaves you questioning if you\u2019re in over your head.",
        "story": "The diner floors were stickier than yesterday.\nThe place smelled like bacon grease and syrupy sweetness, a familiar balance to a fresh pot of coffee, strong and sharp, brewed only moments ago. A regular continued his weekly ritual of breakfast for dinner, an interesting contrast to the classic cheeseburger and greasy crinkle cut fries littering tables across a cozy hole-in-the-wall on the outskirts of Gotham City. You never complained, not when it shook up the agonizing monotony of faces blurring together - tourists, mainly. People passing through. Most locals didn\u2019t come this far out just for a\nburger\n, or a fuckin\u2019 cup of coffee -\nExcept for him, this one. Jason Todd.\nRed Hood.\nAnd, more often than not? His criminal of the week usually had goons slinking around your alleys and open booths to boot. They ordered before a shift. Topped off after a shift. Came through in pairs, small groups, ordering enough food to feed a small fucking horse.\nThey talked loudly, too. Not usually anything worth hearing, thanks to the ones with a little more awareness in the old clunker upstairs,\nbut\n. Tourists never wanted to get involved, and the few regulars that lingered sure as shit knew better. But you\u2026well, no one ever suspected the waitstaff, after all. Not when they were tipped well enough it was an obvious incentive to forget anything they could have heard, on the off chance.\nBut Jason Todd paid you better.\nNerves seemed to be getting the better of you this evening - but the routine of a Thursday kept you grounded here, in the present. The scrawl of your pen to pad, the sound of ice clinking in the bottom of a glass before the iced tea hits.\nBreathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out.\nIt was enough - at least until they arrived, anyway. Night was fast approaching. It was almost time.\n\u201cHey,\u201d your name is called from the far end of the counter before an empty mug slides through your peripheral to stop, magically, right in front of you. \u201cTop me off, if you don\u2019t mind. You look like you need something\nlow-risk\nto do.\u201d\nThe laugh that falls through your lips is uneasy. Strained.\n\u201cIs it that obvious? Because I thought I was hiding it quite well, actually. No one\nelse\n,\u201d you emphasized, the splash of coffee on ceramic glaze filling your pause. \u201cSeems to have noticed. Except\nyou\n.\u201d\nYou slide the mug back to Jason, swirling the last of his french toast in the last puddles of raspberry syrup. He smirks, of course, no doubt about to gift you with another one of his charming quips, he seems all too fond of. \u201cWell -\u201d\nHere we go.\n\u201cI imagine no in here was trained to see these things -\u201d\n\u201c- by the world\u2019s greatest detective.\u201d\n\u201c- by the world\u2019s greatest detective.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you left it out this time.\u201d\nJason snorts into his coffee. \u201cLeft out what?\u201d\nYour eyes roll, feet bringing you to stand before him. The chances of being overheard here were, again, highly unlikely - especially this close to the kitchen where the radio was always loud enough to spill quietly through the window - but, alas.\nPrecautions\n.\n\u201c\n\u2018Not to mention, everything I\u2019ve picked up on my own.\u2019\nHm?\u201d\nIt was your turn to smirk, when Jason paused, steaming mug hovering just above the countertop. His eyes narrowed at you, who had an eyebrow quirked and an expression that was becoming - no, that\u2019s\nnot\n- no. He\u2019s too good at this, as you so kindly reminded him. Trick of the light made him read you wrong for a second, that\u2019s all.\nHe recovers just as quickly - you hadn\u2019t noticed anything amiss - and sets the mug down. \u201cI haven\u2019t said it that much.\u201d\n\u201cAh, but you know you\u2019ve said it\noften\n.\u201d it\u2019s warm, the laugh that follows. Matches the grin growing across your face like a ray of afternoon sunshine. Jason tightens his grip on the mug and slips on the mask of a sardonic smile -\nThe bell over the door jingles.\nYour smile slips. Body tenses. Eyes slip down to glance at Jason, whose demeanor has changed right along with yours.\n\u201cYou got this,\u201d he says. It\u2019s barely audible over the music, over the casual chatter that just entered the diner. \u201cI\u2019m not goin\u2019 anywhere. Promise.\u201d\n\u201cEven if shit gets dicey?\u201d\n\u201cWhy the\nfuck\nwould it get dicey?\u201d\n\u201cJust covering my bases.\u201d\nBreathe in. Breathe out.\nJason mumbles something you don\u2019t quite catch.\nSmile. Project.\n\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t my favorite group of misfits. Sit anywhere you like, guys.\u201d\nA salute is sent your way with a\nThanks, darlin\u2019\ncalled over the endless stream of conversation. Complaints. Schedule conflicts. Somethin about\nmissing my daughter\u2019s birthday party for this job. A fuckin\u2019\nSaturday\n, can you believe it?\n\u201cNot off to a great start,\u201d you mumble. Menus find their way into your hands.\n\u201cIs it ever?\u201d Jason asks.\nYou snort. \u201c\nFather of the yea\nr.\u201d\nJason chokes.\nThe next hour passes in a flash. It\u2019s nothing major so far - minor league tips you\u2019re able to fish out from the small talk, piecing together bits and baubles from the growing list of random - yet\nimportant, apparently\n- chunks of conversation you\u2019ve collected over the past few weeks. It\u2019s the most stressful part of your evenings, when they arrive. An afternoon of quiet ease and a languid pace trades itself in, seamlessly, for quicker steps and an even brighter smile. You don\u2019t rush, as much as pick up your pace. You don\u2019t beam, but you do provide extra banter. You don\u2019t lurk, but you linger. No one thinks twice about weaponizing hospitality - at least, not in a\ndiner\n.\nThe most important part, you\u2019ve learned, is that questions aren\u2019t needed. Jason gave you a few tips in the beginning, and you were quick to pick them up.\nThey trust themselves around you\n, he said once. It was hushed, noted in-between sips of strawberry milkshake, while he watched you refill sugar packet baskets - while you watched them from across the floor. In two minute\nintervals\n.\n\u201cHow can you tell? I assumed they were too prideful or too dumb to know when to keep their mouths shut.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Jason offers you a crooked smile. Slurps the rest of the milkshake. \u201cThat too. But not those guys. See their posture? They loosen up when you go over there, and they don\u2019t immediately can it, either.\u201d\nYou snort, eyes glued to the task at hand. \u201cWell. I\u2019ve noticed, but - why assume I don\u2019t know who they are though? That still sounds really fucking\ncareless\n.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the question,\nhe said.\nIsn\u2019t it?\nThe memory hit you like a fucking brick the second you picked up their change and hid their hush money in a lock box in the back. It felt like all the air had been knocked out of you for a second, and it was - it was -\nfuck\n.\nIt all made sense now, the bits and pieces that had been so important to Jason.\nHis eyes were on you, when you came back out. Felt them trailing you all the way back to their empty table with cleaner and a rag. You didn\u2019t dare look anywhere other than forward.\nBreathe in, breathe out.\nThe bell over the door jingled a departure.\nBreathe in, breathe out.\n\u201cHey - you good?\u201d\nBreathe in, breathe out. Breathe in -\nYour name sounded harsh, louder near your face. The rough shake of your shoulder jarred you back into the present, the now, the here, the\nholy fucking shit.\nThe world started spinning again.\n\u201cWhat? Oh- yeah.\nYeah\n, yeah I\u2019m-\u201d\nEyes drifted downwards, and it seems you had been rather aggressively scrubbing the table so hard the salt and pepper shakers tipped onto the floor.\n\u201cJust - lost in my head, apparently.\u201d The waitress - she was new to the city, new to this type of clientele - stood in front of you, brows falling together. She was nice, and had a contagious laugh. There was a broom in her hand. You reached for it. She pulled it back.\n\u201cYou sure? You see a ghost out here or somethin\u2019? Because you look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u201d\nA strangled laugh dispelled some of the tension growing within you, before it\nsnapped\n. \u201cLong night,\u201d you reached for the broom again. \u201cI\u2019ll clean it up-\u201d\n\u201c\nActually\n,\u201d she took a step back, effectively out of reach. \u201cThat guy you always chat with? You know -\nthe cute one\n? He left a bit ago. Looks like he left you a solid tip this time. I wouldn\u2019t leave it sitting there if I were you.\u201d\nYou glance towards Jason\u2019s stool at the counter, and - she was right. He was gone. \u201cRight. Hey, listen - I\u2019m uh, gonna take a breather for a sec - out back? Yell if you need me.\u201d\n\u201cSure thing.\nWait\n, you know what? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you found his number tucked into a wad of cash one of these nights\u2026\u201d\nYou didn\u2019t stick around to hear the end of that sentence.\n\u2014\u2013\nGotham was a force of nature when night fell.\nSirens approached the diner, gift wrapped in a blanket of mist and muted neon lights. Flashing colors shimmered and echoed through alleyways and front windows alike, while sounding close enough to keep your eyes open, yet far enough away you weren\u2019t worried. Especially here, shrouded in a sliver of darkness choked with fog and a bricked up dead end to your left.\nThe fog shifted through a breeze, and the damp chill engulfed you in a grounding, bitter hug. A wave of calm was, as always, quick to follow. \u201cI think I need a\nfuckin\n\u2019 raise, Todd.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Jason emerged from the gloom, stopping in front of you. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d\n\u201cI got something. It\u2019s -\nJesus\n. Have you ever seen me like this?\u201d\nJason pauses. Looks at you the best he can through the haze, but the dull glow of a shitty lightbulb by the back door doesn\u2019t give him much to work with, though he\u2019ll still see enough. He always does, even when there is no light.\nHe looks away, eventually. Expression unreadable in the shadows. Unreadable, probably, by design. \u201cNo,\u201d he says.\nThat\u2019s all he says. You may not be able to read his face, but you sure as shit can read the tension setting in his shoulders and settling in the way he clenches his jaw.\n\u201cAre you - you\u2019re okay to go back in? I shouldn\u2019t be seen in there so soon, but\nyou\nneed to be. If it\u2019s too much, I can buy you ten minutes to -\u201d\n\u201cI can do it. Just needed to -\nshit\n, I don\u2019t know. Question my life choices, I suppose. Plus you left, and you only pay me up front when you\u2019re lurking back here waiting for my break. So.\u201d\nJason huffs a laugh, handing you the copy of his bill with an address scratched on the back. \u201cYou\u2019ll get your raise.\u201d\n\u201cSee you soon, then.\u201d\nHe nods. Doesn\u2019t say anything, but takes a step towards you. Took a step into what little pool of light you have, muffled though it is through the fog. He hesitates, in this little pocket of quiet, but pushes through it anyway. Pushes through the memory of that look he thinks you gave him earlier, and -\nPanics.\nFucking\njumps ship.\n\u201cSee you when you\u2019re done.\u201d\nJason turns, and the night swallows him whole."

        "writing_prompt": "A storm rages outside, but the true tempest brews within the castle walls as Prince Aemond seeks you out, guilt and tension heavy in the air after a heated argument. Will the storm outside mirror the one between you, or will the calm finally break through?",
        "story": "The afternoon air was thick with tension and dripping destruction, though you seemed to be none the wiser. So swept up were you, in the beauty of deep blue skies and the path of charcoal gray clouds as they passed by on the warm wind. The parchment balanced on your knee was half forgotten, the pot of ink and writing quill sitting on the windowsill as a mere figment, now. A storm must be brewing over the sea, and you wondered if you would experience it before night fell and sleep welcomed you with wide open arms.\nPrince Aemond was many things, on many occasions, for many people. He was calculating, yet\ntempered\n. Unforgiving, attentive.\nImpulsive\n, and intelligent. He was\nwild\n, yet subtlety - veiled or otherwise - had proven to be a quality that he had shown little interest in practicing. It was something he never seemed to regret, even if it meant spiraling petty feuds into further disarray, or simply tugging on fraying threads during family dinners that lead to hurled threats and slamming doors. It was a little cocoon of his own making, this calmly crafted life of controlled chaos.\nYet you were the exception - both you\nand\nHeleana - until, of course, it was only you that remained shielded no longer.\nYou were oblivious, in your daydreams, to the chaos raging fierce and strong in your own home - until the door to your rooms flew open to\ncrack\nsharply on the wall behind.\nAemond didn\u2019t expect to find you here. With the evening promising rain and fury, he assumed you\u2019d be enjoying the fresh air as long as time allowed,\nbut\n. He had come here to breathe, yet the irritation simmering slow and hot and vicious under his skin craved a release of any kind, as it always does.\nRegret\nwas hardly an intimate word for Aemond, yet it lingered, unyielding, clouding his mind once the red melted from his vision and his blackened heart returned to gold.\nThe way he\u2019d allowed his lack of care to send you slamming the door to your apartments as you left him -\nfuming\n, in the wake of your own reciprocated wrath - well. It left him feeling anything other than comfort.\nIt was a whirlwind in the flesh, truly, the tense words he had flung to bite at your heart. Cold, calm fury battered them aside, broke through the weakening shield Aemond held fast around himself in an excuse to project without circumstance. Without consequence. He hadn\u2019t been able to draw blood of course, you knew him too well to know it wasn\u2019t\nyou\nthat had cracked his everlasting dragonskin.\nYou, however, had always been a different story.\nArmed to the teeth with words that would puncture, pierce, cut to bleed and\ntwist\n, when pushed too hard, too far; a cloak of blame had been settled upon your shoulders, and it was not yours to bear. You tore it off with a simple tug, flourished the fabric in such a way that it clung to the Prince himself, the villain in this particular instance, but not a villain at heart.\nAemond was left staring where you had once been; a window that was open, brilliant view of the darkening sky echoing behind you, the sole outlet for the latest qualm that had been one push, one prod, one irrelevant instance too far - because,\nwell\n.\nAs collected as he usually was, there was always\nsomething\nthat would push anyone over the edge.\nRegardless, he had never once abandoned the training grounds to take his ire out on you. He sought only your company after all; a sun, a saint, an equal to temper what always tried to break through the rising tide.\nSeven\nfucking\nhells.\nIt wasn\u2019t a surprise, when he did not follow you through your rooms, or down the glowing hall.\nSconces were being lit as a false twilight fell, the sweet, early arrival of blue hour inspired haste in the servants lighting your way to the library. The shadows were chased away, one by one; yet the shadow that still enveloped your path was not of nature\u2019s doing, nor was it your own.\nWooden doors loomed before you, bracketed by torches bright and warm and welcoming. You had stalked all the way here you realized, swift and mindless in where your feet had been taking you. Anger still burned through your veins, when you pushed the door open with your whole body. Hinges groaned with the sudden movement jarring them awake.\nSilence engulfed you once the door fell shut. Familiarity took you into its arms under the soft light of candles guttering in the fresh stir of air - rarely, did anyone come here at this hour. The knowledge that you wouldn\u2019t be disturbed tempered your fire.\nThe sigh that left your lips was ragged. Shaken.\nHurt\n.\nThis was something new from Aemond - something that made you wonder\nwhat\nin the\nseven hells\njust\nhappened\n.\nYour feet carried you to the nearest window, and the breeze that met your skin was a soft caress tasting of salt and comfort - probably - since that was something you would not be receiving anytime soon, you imagined. Not from the one you wished, at least.\nHe made that\nquite fucking clear\n, actually.\nThe drawl of distant rumbling welcomed you as you journeyed farther into the room, fingers trailing along the old wooden tables in your wake. The emptiness was peaceful, the candlelight warm and soft in stark contrast with the scene you just left to simmer. You went to the windows, drawing them in tight, before the rain could intrude where it did not belong.\nAnger was a fickle thing,\nyou thought, turning a corner. The goal was to become lost in the maze of shelves piled high with long forgotten crumbling volumes. To find a tome that caught your eye in the looming shadows, then settle in with it while you tucked yourself up into one of the few window seats with the raging sea below as your steadfast companion.\nYou\u2019d stay here with your false peace until your eyes drifted closed and your head leaned against rain spattered glass. Unless, of course, you were confident that retracing your steps to venture back wouldn\u2019t reignite what brought you here in the first place. Perhaps then, you would be cooled enough to seek each other\u2019s company, as your heart so longed to do, even now.\nEven so, the distant rumbling grew louder with each page you turned. Rain crackled into the glass as the wind whipped past. The more you read, the pages became even more brown and stiff as they slowly shared with you their age.\nThe storm, once far out of your sight, seemed to be right on top of you now as it unleashed its fury hard and strong and fast as it battered itself again and again and\nagain\nagainst the city below, and punished the castle walls themselves.\nIt was because of this, that every sound coming from within was, of course, as good as silent.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d find you here.\u201d\nHis voice filled what little lull a storm of this magnitude could give. It slid over your skin, soft as silk, slipped in through the little cracks along with the rain and wind and thunder alike.\nPrince Aemond stood in the glow of torchlight, illuminated wholly in the warm caress of flickering flame. He remained some distance from you, mindful of the space you held both for yourself, and, more pressingly - the distance you created when he pushed you oh, so splendidly away earlier that evening.\n\u201cWell,\u201d your eyes slid away from the prince, to instead find the paragraph they had been pulled away from. Your next words were spoken idly, if not with remnants of\nferocity\ncoating them as you resumed reading. \u201cYou\ndo\nknow where I like to hide.\u201d\nAemond shifts his weight - it\u2019s caught out the corner of your eye - and a shadow promptly slips across you to blanket the words on the pages. It was, by design, a darkness you weren\u2019t able to see through, not with the storm outside batting aside the sun\u2019s dying rays with its gray clouds and veils of rain.\nIntentional\n.\n\u201cSo you\nare\nhiding from me.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018\nHide\n\u2019 is not the word I would use.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d\nThe book snapped shut in your hands on a sigh dragged from the weary depths of your heart. They were both, unfortunately, swallowed by another rolling volley of thunder. The timing was so dramatic, so absolutely\nyou\n, that it wasn\u2019t Aemond\u2019s fault when it inspired a harsh roll of his eye.\nHe could be dramatic too, if only to distract you from the way his lips quirked, the flash of a smile threatening to show itself in the darkness, or in the shine of the firelight still kissing fragments of his skin. Aemond knew this wasn\u2019t the time for jokes, yet even he could appreciate the irony of the trap\nhe\nlaid, and, quite gracefully, stepped right into.\nLightning forked through the sky on another crash of thunder, the flash cold in contrast to the warmth of the library. It was jarring, how the harsh, white light exposed everything, always, quickly and quietly before it melted back into the safety of blowing rain and raging waves.\nAnd yet, it was enough. Enough to see the tension weaving its way through Prince Aemond\u2019s jaw, and the set of his shoulders. How he hid his hands behind his back, no doubt clasped and curled in an unbreakable grip. Aemond clearly found no comfort here tonight. He held himself wound tight - even more so, almost, than he did when all the eyes watched him while at court.\nYou, on the other hand, were relaxed, given the circumstances. Lounging comfortably in the window seat while allowing the peace and the stillness to wash over you in the place you felt safest in all of King\u2019s Landing.\nGuilt\n, you realized, still sitting in his shadow.\nThis was what his guilt looked like.\nYou had wondered if Aemond could even feel such a thing.\n\u201cNo,\u201d you answered his question slowly. Let the bite fade from your voice and fall into the storm. Let it melt back into nothing. \u201cI believe I would choose \u2018\nisolate\n\u2019. I assumed neither one of us wanted that conversation to continue while clawing at each other\u2019s throats, as we were.\u201d\nAemond took a breath, inhaled loud and sharp in time with a sheet of rain being pushed against the windowpane. He looked away as you watched him, your feet uncurling from their place on the seat, the volume slipping through your fingers to rest beside you.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d\nYou stepped from the shadows and went to him, still hiding in the safety of the dark. He longed to reach for you, longed to feel your skin, warm from the fire, warm from the peace you always seemed to carve for yourself - but his fingertips were cold from the time he spent solitary in your rooms after you had gone. The fires burned to ashes as he tempered himself, once again, into honed steel that the prince sheathed - if only so he could see you again, without drawing blood once more. Now that he found you, he feared you would find only ice under his touch, instead of comfort.\nIt made his heart\nache\n.\nAnd\nyou\n-\nAemond shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, when he found his fingers threaded through yours. A hand glided up to rest on his jaw, guiding it gently to face you. The fire was gone from your eyes, tension nowhere to be found in your body language. He could see in you, just how much you could read him, even when he said so little. Even when he said everything he didn\u2019t mean.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d you took a step backwards toward the entrance, tugging on his hand as you did so. The corners of your lips quirked, the prelude of a small smile illuminating the shadows Aemond still hid in. \u201cLet\u2019s go brew some tea and\u2026maybe we can talk.\u201d\nHis head dips in agreement, oddly silent since he last spoke. It was almost as if\u2026as if he wasn\u2019t sure the words that wanted to spill out would be the right ones.\nKind\nones. Instead, his chilled fingers finally curled gently around your own.\nAll he can bring himself to say is, \u201cLead on, darling.\u201d\nSo you do, leading him through gloomy shadows deepened by the storm, to hallways illuminated by torches, by lightning, by\nyou\n."
