        "story": "\"There's a report in the local paper about the strange lights which have been seen in St Andrew\u2019s churchyard,\u201d I remarked to Holmes one morning.\u00a0 \u201cIt would appear that many of the residents are growing alarmed.\u00a0 With the approach of All Hallows Eve, it seems many of the more superstitious are fearing the worst.\u201d\n\u201cI am sure there is nothing to be afraid of,\u201d Holmes replied.\u00a0 \u201cIndeed, it is my intention to prove that, while there may be something going on in the churchyard, there is nothing supernatural about it.\u201d\nNothing more was said, and it wasn\u2019t until I few days later when I was once more reading the local paper that I began to laugh and couldn\u2019t resist reading out the article:\nWITCHES SEEN IN GRAVEYARD\nFor several days St Andrew\u2019s Church has been the site of unnatural blue lights which have floated just above the graves.\u00a0 Then last night, our intrepid correspondent saw a coven of witches enter the graveyard, each bearing their broom, shortly after the lights once more became visible.\u00a0 He believes the witches started to perform some sort of ritual and it was not long afterwards that a number of men were seen running from the graveyard.\u00a0 Our correspondent did not remain, having no wish to encounter the witches for himself.\nI would have questioned Holmes as to what he thought of this, but at that moment I heard a knock on the front door followed by Lestrade\u2019s footsteps coming up the stairs.\n\u201cDo come in, inspector, and have a seat,\u201d Holmes said.\n\u201cThank you, Mr Holmes.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure how much you were involved with last night\u2019s activities, but I\u2019m sure you are due my thanks.\u201d\nMrs Hudson, who had followed the inspector in, carrying our coffee, muttered something which I suspected wasn\u2019t too complimentary.\nLestrade, however, turned to our landlady and said, \u201cWhile we do not encourage members of the public to engage with our local villains, on this occasion we are very grateful to you and your ladies for their assistance.\u00a0 You will be delighted to hear that nearly all the gang willingly surrendered themselves to us and had no problem in naming the ringleaders.\u00a0 It appears that it is one thing to use apparently supernatural means to frighten the local population, but it was quite another when it was turned against them.\u201d\n\u201cAnd so it should be,\u201d Mrs Hudson said, before departing.\nBy now I was no doubt looking suitably puzzled, so Holmes very kindly decided to provide an explanation.\u00a0 \u201cAs I told you when you first mentioned the problem to me,\u201d he began, \u201cI had determined to reproduce the blue lights myself.\u00a0 I had just succeeded in my task when Esme came in to clean and called out, \u2018Mrs Hudson, those lights are here too.\u2019\u00a0 Before I had time to explain, our redoubtable landlady had arrived, bearing a broom together with a bucket of water.\u00a0 I hurriedly explained that water would be of no use, but that baking soda might well prove effective, as indeed would the broom she was carrying.\u00a0 I tried to explain the chemistry behind the process, but this did not seem to be of any interest, since she simply said, \u2018Come, Esme, we have work to do.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cBut surely, Holmes,\u201d I protested, \u201cyou should have warned her against dealing with the problem herself.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d he replied, \u201clike your newspaper\u2019s correspondent, I had no wish to encounter a coven of witches.\u201d"

        "story": "While in London, Adam and Lucas had exchanged Christmas presents.\u00a0 These including the traditional charity shop purchase of a hideous tie from Lucas to Adam, which would be worn for Christmas lunch and then discarded; Adam never reciprocated, knowing that Lucas would wear the tie simply to annoy Harry.\u00a0Instead he gave him a warm sweater which with luck would last out the year before general wear and the vagaries of their job would require its replacement.\u00a0 Then there were the usual books and tickets which both knew the other would enjoy.\nAdam had also carefully selected a few presents for Father Christmas to deliver to the werewolf, and it was these that were being unwrapped now.\nHaving excitedly bounced round the room, the werewolf had carefully sniffed all the presents and gently touched a couple with his paw before beginning to open them.\nHe tore the paper off the first one to reveal three small boxes.\u00a0 Instantly he tried to open one of the boxes, so Adam hastily removed it, holding it up and saying, \u201cThese are cookie mixes.\u00a0 We need to make them up and bake them first.\u00a0 See, there are cookie cutters to go with them.\u00a0 If you\u2019re careful you might even be able to cut them out yourself.\u201d\u00a0 The werewolf nodded in understanding and Adam put the packets on one side.\u00a0 The cookies didn\u2019t appeal to him, but he was sure the werewolf would have no trouble in eating all of them by himself.\nThe werewolf then ripped the paper off the second present and shook out the contents, before giving a harrumph of delight and presenting it to Adam.\u00a0 \u201cYou want to wear it now?\u201d\u00a0 The werewolf nodded, so he tied the bandana, which showed Kandinsky\u2019s\nComposition vii\n, round his neck.\u00a0 \u201cYou can wear it when Harry takes you on a mission.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be delighted.\u201d\u00a0 The grin this remark received echoed Adam\u2019s own thoughts that Harry would hate the brightly coloured bandana but wouldn\u2019t be able to complain as it was Art.\nThe next present the werewolf chose was small and when unwrapped proved to be a wooden whistle.\u00a0 The werewolf picked it up in his teeth and blew it.\u00a0 It made a noise similar to a bird\u2019s cheep.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s so you can draw attention to something without having to howl,\u201d Adam explained.\u00a0 \u201cIf you blow it correctly you can play two or three distinct notes.\u201d\u00a0 The werewolf experimented and found there were indeed three different notes.\u00a0 He then proceeded to play\nThree Blind Mice\n.\u00a0 After he\u2019d played that for the third time, Adam suggested he open his next present.\nThis was a DVD.\u00a0 The werewolf placed it on the floor, read the title and wagged his tail.\u00a0 \u201cYou can watch it this afternoon if you like,\u201d Adam said.\u00a0 The tail wagged even faster.\u00a0 Adam was pleased, he\u2019d thought the werewolf would enjoy\nWhite Christmas\n.\nThe final present was larger.\u00a0 Having pulled the paper off, the werewolf rubbed his face in it and again wagged his tail.\u00a0 \u201cYou needed a new blanket, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Adam said.\u00a0 \u201cAnd this is not just any blanket.\u201d\u00a0 He opened the dark blue blanket out, to show that it too said\nWhite Christmas\n.\u00a0 The werewolf bounced round in happy circles.\nThen he sat down, looked at all his presents once again, and gave a very happy howl."

What you want for your own family is one thing, dictating to others is entirely different.\u201d\n\u201cAnd anyway,\u201d Jo added, \u201cit would be perfectly possible for the husband to resign and the wife to continue to work.\u201d\nGiles looked at her and shook his head. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not the way it is.\u201d\nJo\u2019s expression was such that Ros messaged her, \u2018You look like an angry cat, who\u2019s about to spit at someone.

Harry noticed this, but instead of asking him to do so, began, \u201cCongratulations, in half a morning you have managed to alienate the whole of my team. One could almost think you were an enemy agent, but even they would have the sense to know that by doing this they would make absolutely no progress.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.

You will be reassigned.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShut up! And sit there while I make the necessary phone call.\u201d\nA few minutes later, Harry said, \u201cRight, you\u2019re to report to Section M.\u201d\nGiles left, clearly furious at the way he\u2019d been treated.\n\u201cWill there be any comeback?\u201d Ros asked.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry replied. \u201cAt the moment he\u2019s a liability to any team he\u2019s assigned to, and there\u2019s far too great a risk he\u2019d compromise any operation he was involved in. He\u2019s applied to go abroad, but without being able to blend in, which he clearly can\u2019t, he could be dead within a week.
