        "story": "\"The only truth is music\" - Jack Kerouac\nAmidst the great Dwarven halls, with the strike of pick and hammer conducting the percussive beat of honest toil, music grew like weeds amidst freshly tilled soil. From their earliest days, crafting down in the dark, dwarves had lifted their voices in song, the caverns they carved into their mountainsides carrying the tunes from dawn until dusk. They sang, and the earth that cradled them sang back, sharing in their joys and sorrows.\nTo his shame, Bilbo had been surprised that the Company all played instruments. In his prejudice, he had failed to understand how a dwarf could be made rough and course by hard work, but still carry the grace in their fingers to play with any skill. They all soon proved him wrong. There was not a dwarf among them who did not seem to have a flute or pipe ferreted away in their pack, and they came out often, their tunes bright and cheery as they made their way over the land.\nYet it was only once they were back in Erebor that Bilbo realised that even their celebration of music had been whittled away by necessity. They had kept with them the instruments they could carry as they fled. Only now that the Lonely Mountain was slowly reclaiming its splendour did the Master Craftsmen turn their attentions to their heritage once more. Slowly, the voices of those dwarves hard at work and raised in song were joined by the tuneful dapple of strings and flutes and brass.\nStill, to Bilbo, it felt as if one part of Erebor's great orchestral rebirth was missing. He knew, from stories told on the roads over Middle-earth, that Thorin, in his youth, had played the harp. Balin had confided in him, his eyes bright with recollection, how beautifully he had once played, before the dragon came and turned all he loved to ash. The instrument had been left behind amidst the embers of Thorin's old life: too big and unwieldy to be saved.\nThat was why he was here with Bofur, up in the wrecked remnants of the royal chambers, opening up old doorways and viewing the calamity confined within their walls.\n'A right mess, this is,' Bofur murmured, his usual good humour eclipsed by the destruction. 'It'll take years to repair.'\n'And Thorin has prioritised every other part of the mountain.' Bilbo sighed. He understood why he did it. Thorin's heart lay with his people. He did not care for the symbols of status that his grandfather had held in such high esteem. He would rather sleep on a rug before an open fire than live in luxury while his people went hungry.\nBofur grunted, and now, at last, there was a touch of a sparkle in his eye. 'He won't get a choice in the matter before long. For now, the dwarves arriving in Erebor are grateful for his humbleness, but soon they'll insist he climb back on his pedestal and stop getting his hands dirty. You'll have to soothe a lot of ruffled feathers.'\nBilbo cast a look in Bofur's direction, shaking his head before lifting his torch higher. 'That's why we're here, remember? To do something for Thorin, since he will not take the time to do it for himself.'\n'First, we have to find the thrice-damned thing, assuming Smaug left any of it behind.'\nThat was a valid concern. Even here, after traversing the ruined, twisted staircase, made narrow and precipitous by Smaug's ruination, he could see signs of the dragon's invasion. Gouges scored the walls, disrupting the marble's exquisite sheen. Tapestries had been ripped from their moorings, their fine silks and gold thread hoarded amidst the mountain of treasure. Delicate glass windowpanes, worthless to the wyrm but expensive all the same, had been smashed in his wrath. What remained was a skeleton of grandeur, and one that would linger in its sad state for some time yet.\n'Bilbo, here!' Bofur's voice was hushed, as if he had disturbed some poor soul's tomb.\nBilbo crept forward, lifting his lantern higher to let its light pour into the chamber he'd revealed. It was then, with a flash of grief, that he realised a body of a sort had found its rest here. The once graceful arch of a harp lay, its pillar broken and its soundboard cracked. Many of the strings had snapped or come loose from their pegs. It was a sad sight, but something in him rebelled, determined to find whatever small life might linger in the instrument's shattered frame.\n'There must be something we can do.'\nBofur rubbed a finger up the bridge of his nose before adjusting his hat with his palm, his dark eyes black and thoughtful in the meagre light. 'I'm a toy-maker,' he pointed out. 'I don't think \"we\" is the word you're looking for, but...' He hunkered down, setting the lantern on the floor and sucking in a breath through his teeth. 'It's not rotten. That's a start. Looks like it was smashed against the wall. Key bits of the frame will have to be replaced, and that needs the right kind of wood and hands with the skill to fix it.'\n'But it can be done?' He didn't mean to sound quite like that \u2013 achingly desperate \u2013 but the dwarf he loved carried a multitude of hurts. Not merely the physical ones, which had almost claimed his life, but ones upon his soul. This, Bilbo knew, was as much part of the healing as Oin's tinctures and constant nagging to rest and eat.\n'Aye, I think so. It'll be a challenge, but I know more than one dwarf who lives for this sort of thing, and to do it for our King? They'll rise to the occasion.' Bofur gave Bilbo a look, full of the soft fondness of friendship. 'This was a grand idea, Bilbo. Leave it with me.'\nIt took time, as all such things did. True craftsmanship could not be rushed, and the broken body of Thorin's old harp was an invalid in need of delicate care. Bilbo dropped by often, nervous, at first, that Master Mothi would view his presence at an intrusion. However, the kind old dwarf, busily training an apprentice, was more than happy to talk about his craft as long as Bilbo kept his hands in his pockets.\n'I remember when my master first built it,' he confided one day, as his gnarled hands stroked along the sound box, testing it for any small flaw that might break the harp's voice. 'The look on the face of the young prince as he played! I recall his only complaint was one he made to his mother, and that was a criticism of his grandfather's decorative taste.'\n'How do you mean?'\n'The old king had it carved and covered from crown to base in gold leaf. Delicate work. Challenging, too. It made the harp more fragile. The sound a touch less pure. My master was unhappy to do it, but we had our instructions.'\n'No gold, this time,' Bilbo decided, feeling in his heart how Thorin would rather the wood's grain could shine through. He would wish the strings to sing with their truest voice, more admiring of the harp's function than its form.\n'Perhaps an inlay, here?' Mothi stroked his palm down the front of the pillar. 'Something shallow, so as not to compromise its strength. I have a wonderful alloy: brass with a touch of mithril. It gives a wonderful sheen and need never be polished. Geometric, perhaps?'\nBilbo hid a smile before inclining his head. He had not wanted to say anything about the graceful lines of the harp, though he had noticed that there were some fundamental differences between the ones he had seen in Rivendell and this specimen. Even broken, he could tell Thorin's harp had a subtle angularity to its form, something sharper, where the elves favoured the sweeping curve.\n'Will it be much longer?' he asked, eyeing the framework, which to him looked as good as whole, but as yet unstrung.\n'Another week, maybe two.' Mothi gave him a knowing look. 'You cannot rush perfection.'\n'And I would not wish you to. Thank you.'\nHe tried to set it from his mind, the secret slowly taking shape beneath Mothi's hands. During the day, when there was much to be done, he did a fair job. Yet it was in the evening, when he and Thorin retired to their shared chamber in the overseer's quarters that he felt the strange, amorphous absence of it. He observed how Thorin seemed to not know how to draw the boundary between work and rest. He carried his tension with him, his mind forever caught up in the needs of his kingdom without a moment of respite.\nSo it was that, the day the harp was ready, and stolen carefully into their chambers, Bilbo found himself alight with nervous anticipation. He hoped that this had been the right thing to do. He prayed that he was healing a wound in Thorin's being, rather than ripping off a scab to leave him bleeding anew.\n'We need to finish treating with the merchant guild. They have their eye on the treasury, as always, but I will not allow them to \u2013' Thorin's words stumbled to silence as he preceded Bilbo over the threshold. His next breath was an odd little hitch, as if his lungs had forgotten how to work, and Bilbo sank his teeth into his bottom lip, praying he had not made a grave mistake.\n'This is...' Thorin swayed before stepping forward, reaching out with shaking fingertips to rest them against the harp's pillar like a healer checking for a pulse, reaching for the life that resided once more in the instrument's beautiful frame. The strings gleamed, waiting to be stirred into song, and Bilbo was almost sure he could hear them humming softly, like a cat purring in the presence of one who loved it. 'Where did you find this?'\n'The Royal Wing.' Bilbo shifted forward. 'It had been broken and forgotten, but there was enough of it left to save.' He swallowed, thinking how those words were not for the harp alone. They could be said about the kingdom around them and the line that ruled it just as easily. 'Master Mothi remade it, keeping as much of the original as he could. I thought you deserved something out of all this that was yours alone.'\nThorin turned, sweeping Bilbo into his arms, his brow a warm press against Bilbo's own. It was an assertive embrace, as if Thorin were trying to press everything he could not put into words down into Bilbo's bones, and the kiss that followed it had Bilbo's toes curling against the flagstones.\n'You like it, then?' he managed, delightfully breathless when Thorin reluctantly eased back, those rich blue eyes all softness and delight.\n'More than almost anything, except for you,' Thorin promised, his voice low and resonant in a way that set love thrilling through Bilbo, spreading beneath his ribs to pool in the hollow of his belly.\n'Will you play?' he asked, feeling as if it were some moment of truth. He had heard Thorin sing, his voice soft and deep, but this was another matter. He knew how talented those hands could be, and now he wanted to see them there, coaxing sound from an instrument that had been silent for far too long.\n'It would be a crime not to, though I warn you, I am out of practice.'\nThough Bilbo could well-believe the claim, he could hear no flaw in Thorin's playing. At first, perhaps, he was a touch hesitant, learning this old friend anew, but before long the music swelled around them, filling their chamber with its magic. It was not the ethereal, haunting melody of the elves, but something faster and deeper, the pitch of the harp more resonant: fitting for the booming mountain halls. It made Bilbo's heart race and quickened his blood. He let his eyes drift shut, the better to lose himself in the melody, and it was only when Thorin stopped that he opened them once more.\n'That was beautiful,' he murmured, feeling a little drunk \u2013 transported to somewhere glorious by Thorin's playing.\n'Would you like to learn?'\nBilbo's first thought was an instinctive refusal: the instrument too fine and his skill non-existent. Yet there was a gleam of something in Thorin's eye that made him think about how dwarves saw music \u2013 not as something to be performed for praise, but something to be shared with one another: the good and the bad. Skill was not as essential to them as the simple act of creation, and that was something he knew Thorin sought to share with Bilbo at every opportunity.\n'I can't even read a stave,' he warned, reaching out to take Thorin's hand and allowing himself to be guided closer, to cradle the harp between his spread legs like a lover, and set hesitant fingers upon its strings.\n'You don't need to. We rarely write down our songs. They are fluid things, learned and adapted, simplified and embellished.' Thorin stood behind him, bending to place his larger, broader hands over Bilbo's own. Warm, calloused fingers showed him how to move, teaching him where to pluck the strings and where to soothe them, leading him through it like he might lead a partner through a dance.\nAnd so it was that, slowly, music raised its voice once more in the halls of the Lonely Mountain once more. The tune carried, bright and true, through the turn of the seasons until the melody of love at the kingdom's heart became a symphony of prosperity for the whole realm to enjoy.\nFor all the years to come."

        "story": "Peregrinate - to travel or wander from place to place.\nGwaine didn't need much. A bit of coin in his pocket and some ale in his belly was enough to inspire contentment. All the other things people tended to seek \u2013 a home, friends, lovers who stayed longer than one night, a family \u2013 they held little interest for him. They tied him down. He'd rather be free and easy, without a responsibility in the world. That way when his life went to shit, there was no one to blame but himself.\nHe hadn't started out like that, of course. No one did. He'd been a kid once, with dreams and ideals. He'd thought of being a knight under the king's banner. He'd known it was his calling. Right up until the day it turned out that a knight should be loyal, but a king need not bother.\nHis pa died in a battle he should never have fought, and he and his ma were left with nothing. He didn't blame his mother for following her love to the grave. He would have done the same, if all he had left to keep him in the world was a life of poverty and a son full of rage.\nLeaving was the easiest choice. It didn't matter where he was or what was happening, he had learned to go before he wore out his welcome. He wandered \u2013\nperegrinated\n\u2013 he remembered that from his tutors. After all, only commoners walked places. A lord, even a disgraced one with no bloody horse, would not stoop to mere walking.\nHe had to admit it sounded better in his head. It sounded purposeful. Better than the truth, anyway, which was that he fell from one tavern to the next, either charming or punching anyone who took offence at his presence.\nThat was how he ended up in a brawl, a knife wedged in his thigh and hurting like the blazes. That was how he came 'round later to a sweet, dark-haired lad with the brightest smile he'd ever seen, and a blond pillock who swung a sword as easy as if it were breathing.\nIn his defence, Gwaine had always given Camelot a wide berth. It was a troubled land, from all that he'd heard, so he could forgive himself for not immediately recognising Prince Arthur. Still, just because he didn't know his precise name or title didn't mean he couldn't read the breeding in him. He was a noble through-and-through, with all the arrogance that went with it.\nIf not for Merlin, he would probably have limped away there and then. He'd never have gone to Camelot. He'd certainly never have gone back once he left the first time, eager to get away before the friendship could lose its shine.\nIf not for Merlin, he'd not have had this life, and it would have been a crying shame.\nThese days, he was a knight on his own terms, not because of the blue in his blood, but because he was good with a sword. He had friends who joked and smiled and teased, but always with a fondness that robbed their words of any sharpness.\nLeon was gracious, and Gwaine had never met a more steadfast man. Elyan was always there to talk to and never held any judgement for the stupid mistakes Gwaine made, even now. Lancelot's compassion put them all to shame, yet he never made them feel bad for their petty, human thoughts. He made them better men, of that Gwaine was certain. Percival was a wonder. He could probably stop a charging bull with his bare hands, but Gwaine had never known a more gentle soul.\nThey'd die for each other. He just hoped it never came to that.\nHe didn't think it would. For all that he was a prat, Arthur was one of the few good royals Gwaine had ever met. A man had to dig deep to reveal his kindness \u2013 because that bastard father of his had taught him all the callous cruelty that came with power \u2013 but it was there. All it needed was someone to let him know, in all the subtle little ways, that compassion was a strength, not a weakness, and that being a decent human being wouldn't make him a bad king.\nThat was Merlin's job. Well, that and keeping the rest of them on their toes. He could have been like one of the breathless pages, chasing after the knights with hero worship in his eyes. He could have been an obsequious little toad, always looking to ingratiate himself to his so-called superiors. Thank the gods that he was anything but.\nHe poked holes in Arthur's ego and made sure none of them ever got too big for their britches. He pointed out when any single one of them was being a fool, often with a glimmer of absolute glee.\nHe reminded them that, underneath all the trappings of rank, they were men at heart, all made of the same stuff and all of equal value.\nGwaine had spent years travelling the realms and calling it freedom, ignoring the loneliness that consumed him like rot. Now, he had friends who were as good as any family. They knew him. Not just the jokey facade he put on to please the world, but what lay underneath. He no longer had to roam, looking for something and denying it all the while.\nHe'd found home, and it wasn't a place like he'd always believed. It was the people who proudly claimed him as theirs, the bad bits, as well as the good.\nHis wandering days were over."

        "writing_prompt": "As Thorin and Bilbo uncover a long-lost mural deep within Erebor, they stumble upon the story of a mysterious figure from Dwarven legend\u2014a queen who was not born a dwarf but became one through love and sacrifice. What secrets does her tale hold, and how might it echo in their own lives?",
        "story": "Rebuilding Erebor was, at times, a journey of rediscovery. The fateful day the dragon came, it shattered Thorin's people and obliterated their home. Yet there was more to the mountain than gold and a place for a dwarf to lay his head. It was a cultural centre: one of the pillars of Dwarven history, and to lose it had struck the race as a whole a mighty blow. Now, as they peeled back the shadows of Smaug's occupation and reopened old rooms, those stories were steadily making their way back into the light.\nPerhaps, if not for Bilbo, he would not notice how much they reclaimed day-by-day. After all, the dwarves remembered the broad-strokes of their own stories, if not the details. They did not need explanations, but to Bilbo it was all unknown. He was hungry to immerse himself in a world that was utterly new, and through him, Thorin saw it all with fresh eyes.\n'This is... incredible.' Bilbo stood with his head tilted back, eyeing the vast mural they had uncovered. It had been obscured by the accumulation of dust and cobwebs, the filth blurring the stone even as the shadows hid it from sight. Now, lamps and braziers threw off the darkness, and clean water had cast aside the shroud of the years to reveal what lay beneath.\nShades of gold and jade, silver and cobalt gleamed as bright as the day they had been set into the wall. It was the line of Durin, their family tree set out in complete clarity, going back through the ages to a time long before Erebor or Khazad-d\u00fbm. Back into an era where fact bled into myth and grew grander in every retelling.\nThere were pictures, and Thorin smiled to see fragments of himself littered through the past. His nose there, on some distant relative. The particular twist of his hair there on another. Dwarves who looked uncannily like Fili cropped up more than once, and Kili's smile was a trait that ran true, tilted at that certain angle.\n'There is one of these in here for each of the Dwarven families of note that held good standing during my grandfather's time.' He stepped back, the better to take in the broad splay of it \u2013 admiring the depth of the colours and that sharpness of the outline. It was a miracle Smaug had not clawed it apart. He had believed some of this knowledge lost. 'I used to sit in here on my mother's knee as she told me about them: my ancestors. My blood-line.'\nHe looked over at Bilbo, seeing him standing on tiptoes and squinting upwards, trying to make out something in particular. Following his gaze, Thorin gave a huff of mirth. Of course, there was one person who stood out more than the others: dark-eyed, beardless... different. A young woman who had become a queen and then slowly vanished into family legend.\n'Who is she?' Bilbo asked, knowing Thorin was looking in the same direction. 'Other than absolutely not a dwarf.'\n'She was a dwarf in every way that mattered,' Thorin murmured in response, admiring the way the light struck Bilbo's russet curls to gold and caressed the swell of his cheeks. 'She was adored by her people and respected by all the lords of the land.'\n'But?'\n'But...' Thorin tilted his head in acknowledgement. 'She was not a dwarf by blood. Unfortunately, the history we still have, be it written or remembered, does not tell us her race. There were rumours. Stories. If they are true, they would be remarkable.'\nBilbo shifted closer, pressing his arm to Thorin's. 'I think stories are as real as you make them. One day, dwarves will probably wonder if we really freed a mountain from a dragon's tyranny, or if it\u2019s all a metaphor for something else. Or a complete fiction to help someone establish their personal glory.' He tilted his head towards the mural. 'So, tell me her story. The one you're not certain you believe.'\n'She lived a very long time ago, and she claimed the heart of one of my ancestors, back when our name was Duthin, not Durin. We still sing of their love in some of our oldest, most traditional songs, but while her devotion was remarkable, it was her sacrifice that stirred the hearts of many.'\n'Sacrifice?' Bilbo frowned, his mouth twisting in uncertainty. 'What did she give up?'\n'Everything that she was.' Thorin sighed. 'This is the part my mother told me. The part that sounds too fantastic to believe. When Mahal made the dwarves of the mountain, some of the souls he used escaped to live free of earthly ties. They are the spirits of the mountain. Some are bent to chaos, such as the Ithin, while others are the small blessings of a place: a light where none should shine. Then, there are the Peri.'\nBilbo cocked his head, inquisitive. He did not interrupt or demand to know more. Instead, he waited, watching Thorin with an open, interested gaze. In the torch-light, his betrothal bead sparkled, and something in Thorin's chest lurched, fierce and loving, at the sight.\n'They were \u2013 well, there are many stories, but the one most people believe is that the Peri are mischievous spirits. The ones who steal your tools when you're not looking or lead you astray, but they mean no harm by it. In fact, they are often the ones miners call upon in the direst circumstances, and sometimes, they answer. It is said that she rescued one of my distant forefathers from a landslide in the mountain mines. He was lost and alone in the deepest, living dark, and when he reached out a hand, she took it. They walked for days to reach the surface once more. He knew only her voice and the touch of her fingers.'\nThorin wet his lips, the story welling up in him, as pure and true as the day his mother had spoken of it. 'Yet a short way from salvation, he collapsed, too spent to move another step. He could not rise. He could not call out for help in the hopes that someone would come and find him. Instead, she carried him out, and in doing so she gave up that which made her a Peri.\n'Some say she was like a mithril mist: one that took a physical form in the sunlight. Others say she had wings, but they fell away when she stepped beneath the open sky. Another sliver of the story is she gave up an immortal, divine existence to walk the world at his side. There is much she is meant to have sacrificed for his survival, because she fell in love, down in the mountain's heart, and she could not bear to see him die.'\n'And he made her his queen.' Bilbo stared up at the mural once more, and Thorin could see how he drank in the sight of her \u2013 this person who was not a dwarf by birth, but had become one in every other aspect: loved and loving in turn. 'What was her name?'\nThorin could not help the curl of his smile. He did not put it past Bilbo to believe everything he had spoken, but there was one coincidence he suspected his hobbit would struggle to swallow. 'Bilba. Her name was Bilba.'\nHe chuckled as Bilbo huffed, shaking his head in disbelief. 'You're making that up.'\n'I'm not. I swear it upon my throne. I'd forgotten all about her and the stories my mother told, though there was something familiar about your name when I first heard it.' He turned to his hobbit, looking down into that doubtful face. The story of Bilba and her beloved may be more myth that anything else these days, but it still rang true. Now, he stood before the hobbit he loved \u2013 the one who would rule at his side once they were wed \u2013 and he thought of how much he had left behind.\nBilbo had given up his home, his kin and his life. He had abandoned everything he had ever known to follow Thorin on his own tortuous journey to reclaim his kingdom. He had bartered with elves for the lives of the line of Durin, and he had conquered a king's madness. Then, as if all that wasn't enough, he had offered Thorin his heart.\nBilbo had been his salvation in more ways than one, and Thorin would never allow himself to take that devotion for granted. Perhaps Bilba had given up everything to see that the dwarf she loved survived, but she had gained much in return for her sacrifice. She had been immortalised in song and myth, celebrated by the dwarf who loved her and all who came to know her name.\nAnd it would be no different for Bilbo. Erebor already loved him, and they would continue to do so long after he and Thorin went to their rest. His name would be written into their histories, with Thorin's alongside, and they would never truly be forgotten. Not until the unmaking of the world.\nAnd until then, they would live a long, happy life in each other's arms. Of that, Thorin had no doubt."

First, there had been Paige, her body trembling in his arms as she rejected the bite, her eyes bright with pain as the last breaths lurched in her chest. Then there was his family, trapped and burned alive by Kate Argent and her treachery. She may have been the one to set the fire, but he had given her the opportunity. He had trusted a grown woman, one who would have had no interest in a boy like him. He had been naive, and his family were dead as a result.\nLaura. He hadn't even been able to protect Laura.\nThere were days when he knew it would be easier if he just stopped trying. Just stopped caring. Maybe if the only one who had ever been hurt by his failures was himself, it wouldn't matter so much.\nBut people had died.\nHe could have been a lone wolf, an Alpha without a pack. That felt preferable to having others rely on him to lead, where every choice he made could end in disaster. Yet in the end, some small part of him rebelled. That piece of him that still looked for the family he had lost, even now, would not let him give up.\nBecoming an Alpha was a massive strain, both physically and psychologically. It shoved every Wolf instinct he'd ever had to the fore, leaving him struggling against his more basic instincts. The need to gather a pack had been a driving force, and in the end, it had overcome his fear of what the future could hold.\nHis Wolf chose his pack, and his humanity rationalised his decisions. Erica, Boyd and Isaac all had need. The bite could help with their health, their isolation, their abuse. It gave strength to those who needed it. His humanity said he was helping them. His Wolf snarled that they were the people least likely to refuse or reject him. No one, after all, would really be in his pack if they had any other choice.\nExcept that it turned out, none of it was that simple. Nor did a pack just emerge, fully formed and functional. It was all about negotiation. He had to learn about his betas: their strengths and weaknesses. Erica was determined and loyal, but impulsive. Boyd was an excellent strategist but prone to overthinking, and Isaac? Isaac would have laid down his life for any one of them, because he'd been taught that he was worthless.\nSnarling and dominance didn't work. He knew that, and he had to bite back the urge time and again. Sometimes he even succeeded. It was rough going at first, but eventually, he began to pull together the shattered pieces of his life, and the betas came with him. They put the train depot behind them and moved into the loft, which was still pretty Spartan, but at least the roof didn't leak. Gradually, it went from being a shell of a place to something like home, with mismatched sofas and a temperamental TV, comfortable beds and a fridge stuffed to over-flowing.\nAnd at some point, it had become far more than a den for wolves.\nDerek stood in the kitchen, staring at the gaggle of teenagers currently sprawled around and fighting over what movie to watch. There were textbooks left open on the coffee table. Forgotten, screwed up essays and battle plans littered the carpet like malformed snowballs. There were nail-polish bottles and magazines, bags and sports equipment. The place was a mess, but it was a happy one. There was laughter and teasing and the simple joy that came from being alive and understood.\nIn them, he had found something worth protecting, and he would never let them down."

The knights had joined in, because they could be right bastards sometimes, and Gwen had frozen in the act of helping him clear the dishes, staring at him from behind Arthur's back in abject horror.\nUnfortunately, while the knights were not very in tune with the castle gossip, the same could not be said for Guinevere, who had heard a thing or two and knew that Merlin was most certainly\nnot\na virgin.\nWhich left only one option.\n'Er...?'\nHe could lie. He could absolutely lie and say Arthur was talking out of his arse, as usual, but something told him Gwen wouldn't believe a word he said. She was ardent in her rage, almost incandescent with it, and he had a healthy dose of respect for her anger. She was no delicate maiden. Only Morgana scared him more, and it was a close-run thing.\n'You \u2013 you \u2013' Gwen's chest heaved, which in any other circumstance would be a pleasant sight. Right now, though, he couldn't be sure if she was dragging in breath to scream for the guards.\n'Gwen, please, I can explain!' He reached out a hand, and her flinch of retreat was enough to make him jerk back, apologies already frothing from his lips. 'It's \u2013 I \u2013 I use it for Arthur! You know what he's like, the danger he's always in. I use it to keep him safe. Him and Camelot! I haven't hurt anyone!' He winced at that, before quickly amending, 'At least, no one who didn't deserve it.'\nShe stared at him, the warming pan on its long handle held between them like a sword. He could see the whites of her eyes all the way around, and he shifted to the side so he wasn't standing between her and the door. It was an obvious gesture, and one that seemed to break through the sharpest edge of her uncertainty.\n'Are you\ninsane\n?' she demanded, her voice high and thin, muffled by the cloth stacked shelves around them. 'Merlin, they will kill you. They will find out, and they will kill you. You have to \u2013 you have to stop. Don't use it. Don't learn any more than you already have. Who even taught you? Don't they know the danger they're putting you in?' Her hair fluttered as she breathed hard. 'Not just from \u2013 from the King! Magic corrupts. It turns you evil.' The glimmer of tears embellished her lashes, her mouth wobbling horribly. 'Even if you're good now, you won't be in the end!'\nShe pressed the back of her hand to her lips, the warming pan going lax in her grip. Gently, Merlin stepped forward, keeping each movement slow as he relieved her of her makeshift weapon. It would be easiest to just agree with her, to lie and promise not to use it, but this was Gwen. He couldn't do that to her. Nor could he have her believing he was some sort of naive simpleton, dabbling in magic in a kingdom where it was outlawed.\n'You're wrong.' He said it softly, apologetically. 'About so many things. Gwen, no one taught me this. I've always had magic, since before I even cut my first tooth. If it was going to corrupt me, it would have done so by now. It's not \u2013 it's not bad.' His voice throbbed over the words, desperate, because he'd spent years hearing the whispers of others and fearing he was as monstrous as they all suggested. '\nI'm\nnot bad.'\nShe hiccupped, her nostrils flaring as she took in a deep breath through her nose. 'You already had magic when you came to Camelot?' she asked, shaking her head in slow disbelief. 'You came here knowing what you are? What could happen to you? You\nstayed\n?'\nBefore he could answer, the door opened, whispering on its hinges as Lancelot darted through the narrow gap, sallow and worried. His dark eyes went to Guinivere, his heart, as always, carried in their depths, but it was Merlin he reached for, clasping a hand over his shoulder and asking a hundred questions with a single glance.\n'Gwen's not stupid, unlike some people.' Merlin swallowed hard. 'She knows.'\n'Wait,' Gwen managed, barely hesitating as Lancelot shut the door firmly behind him. 'He knows?' She turned on Lancelot. 'You\nknew\nand you didn't tell me?'\n'It was not my secret to impart.'\n'And you!' She spun on Merlin, her hands clenched into fists at her side before she thumped him, hard, on the shoulder. 'You told Lancelot before you told me? I was the first friend you made in Camelot! I liked you when you were a sad, stinking boy in the stocks!'\n'Ow! Ow! It's not like I told either of you. You found out!' Merlin raised his hands to ward off any further blows, breathing out a sigh of relief when Gwen subsided, just a fraction.\n'When?' she narrowed her eyes at Lancelot in a manner that suggested he would be fortunate to share the pleasure of her kisses any time soon.\n'The griffin.' Lancelot's hands where still held out, appeasing. 'My lance burst into magical blue flame, and Merlin was the only one still standing to cast such a spell. He saved us, Guinevere. My blow would have done nothing to the beast if not for his help.'\n'That's \u2013 it's \u2013' She shook her head, slumping down onto a laundry chest as she stared blankly at the flagstones. It made Merlin's heart ache for her. She wasn't like Lancelot, worldly and well-travelled. She had lived in Camelot all her life. How many executions had she witnessed? How many times had magic attacked her home and threatened her safety? How many years had she listened to Uther's rhetoric on sorcerers and believed the words of her king?\nAnd yet, she still had not screamed for the guards.\n'He keeps us safe, Guinevere,' Lancelot promised. 'I don't know all that he has done, but it has been for us. For his friends. He would never offer us harm. If I thought him a danger to anyone, I would not have kept his secret. I would not have risked my life for him.'\nThat got Gwen's attention, and she blinked at him, realisation crumpling her features. 'The King would execute you too, for hiding what he is.'\n'It will never come to that.' Merlin said it with utmost certainty. He would enchant Lancelot into silence to save him if he had to. 'I won't let it. If I'm ever dragged to the pyre of the headsman, I will go alone.'\nGwen's brown skin took on a greyish tinge at that, and at last her eyes met his, looking at him as if she were searching for the man she knew in the face of a stranger. It was a desperate, heartfelt gaze, carrying with it the weight of the world, and Merlin saw the moment she found her resolve.\n'No. No, you won't, because that's not going to happen.' She brushed a hand over her face, dashing away the tears that had threatened, but never quite fallen. 'You're my friend. You always have been, and you always will be.' Her voice wobbled before she seemed to master it. 'I can't say I understand, or that I accept it \u2013 not yet. Not completely, but... But Merlin, I can't condemn you either. I don't think I ever could.'\nShe let out a tight sound as he reached for her hand, her grip surprisingly strong as she yanked him into an embrace. It was awkward, he had to bend over to get his arms around her, but there was strength there too: comfort and promise, and he let out a shaking breath of relief as he hugged her back.\n'Thank you. And if, somehow, my magic ever does corrupt me? I've got you and Lancelot to set me straight. One way or the other.'\nHe hunkered down, putting himself on Gwen's level so he could look into her eyes, hoping she could see his sincerity. He meant every word he said. It was not magic that corrupted people, but the power that came with it. If he ever fell victim to that, then he hoped his friends would have the strength to stop him.\n'Okay?'\nGwen swallowed, letting out a shuddering breath as she slowly nodded her head. Her hand gripped his, tight and fierce. 'Okay,' she agreed.\nDistantly, the sound of Gaius calling for him reached Merlin's ears, and he swore quietly. He'd promised to gather herbs, and now he looked over his shoulder at the door, wondering if he could possibly delay.\n'Go,' Gwen urged, pursing her lips until they bleached white. 'I'll be all right.'\n'You're sure?' He looked over at Lancelot, seeing the promise in his eyes. He wouldn't leave Gwen alone. He would provide a target for her questions and her ire.\n'Tell her whatever she wants to know,' Merlin said at last, giving Gwen a quick squeeze and straightening up, 'and if Lancelot doesn't have an answer, ask me. I'll \u2013 I'll answer honestly.' Even as he said it, he felt almost dizzy with the implications of it. Here were two people. bound to him not by blood, but by friendship: two accidental guardians to the secret that would see him dead.\nHe wanted to trust them \u2013 he\ndid\ntrust them, but... Well, there was always a \"but\".\n'Go,' Lancelot urged. 'Before Gaius sends out a search party.' Tentatively, he took a seat by Gwen on the chest, shoulder-to-shoulder, offering her everything: silent support or a willing punching bag on which she could vent her emotions.\n'All right, and thanks.' He included Gwen in his gratitude, knowing she would understand the depths of it. He wasn't just talking about this moment; he was speaking of the choice she had made. Uncertain she may be, but she had looked between the laws of Camelot and the life of a friend, and chosen the latter.\nHe only hoped that, one day, all his friends would do the same."

        "story": "The cooks had outdone themselves for the feast, piling the tables with meats and confections. There was enough food groaning upon the tables to feed the Lower Town for a week. Merlin's stomach growled, pointedly reminding him that it had been a long time since lunch.\nUther was showing off for a visiting lord, exaggerating Camelot's wealth and power by whatever means possible. It was not just the dinner that was sumptuous. Arthur and Morgana were both dressed in their finest, with precious metal and jewels sparkling on fingers or at the turn of their wrists. Arthur had a bracelet polished to such a shine that it dazzled Merlin every time he held out his goblet to be refilled. The end result was that he was standing at Gwen's side, weary, hungry, and with a headache growing at his temples.\n'What, exactly, is it?' Gwen murmured, utilising that servant-ly skill of speaking out of the side of her mouth. Merlin envied her. If he tried to do that he slurred like a drunkard.\n'What?'\n'That. In the middle. Near the carrots.'\nMerlin squinted at it. He had vague memories of the cook tenderising something, her biceps bulging with every swing as she explained to an under-cook what she was doing. 'Thin layers of beef and pork rolled together, and cooked.' It was more meat than most people saw in a week. Was one dead animal not enough to grace the King's table?\n'Beef and pork?' Gwen whispered, sounding doubtful. 'Are you sure?'\n'It's something to do with unity, apparently.' At least, that's what the steward had said, pompous as always. 'Mixing flavours, or something. Like beef and pork. Bork.'\nA splutter of laughter escaped Gwen's lips, and Merlin didn't stifle his grin, not even when Arthur glanced over his shoulder. Serving at feasts was a long, boring, thankless duty. His belly grumbled and his feet ached, but Gwen's giggle at least made it a little more bearable.\n'And that?' she asked, 'near the trifle?'\n'Pear and apple pie.'\n'Would that be pepple or papple?' she said innocently, biting her lip as Merlin snorted. 'I don't care what it's made of,' she confessed a moment later. 'I just wish they would hurry up and eat so I could go home.'\nMerlin hummed in agreement, not sure what he needed more: a good meal or the comfort of his bed. Somehow, he suspected neither need would be fulfilled soon. He had a horrible feeling he'd forgotten to restock Gaius' herbs. That was sure to earn him The Eyebrow.\nA quick glance at the high windows of the hall made him swear under his breath. Night was already well-advanced. He was used to hunting down plants in the dark, but if he didn't get started soon, he wouldn't get the task done before Arthur required him for morning duties.\n'Are you all right?' Gwen whispered.\n'Just remembered that Gaius urgently needed some Evening Primrose. I meant to get it earlier, but \u2013' He trailed off, gesturing at the feast with one hand. 'I didn't have time.'\nGwen made a sympathetic noise of understanding, shifting her weight onto one foot and wriggling the other to get the blood flowing back to her toes. 'Maybe Arthur will sleep in?'\nMerlin made a doubtful noise. Prince Prat had been moderate in his drinking tonight, which meant he was probably planning an early training session. If so, he'd want to be awakened not long after sunrise, regardless of how late he stayed up tonight.\nIt was another candle-mark before Morgana excused herself, smiling as she was waved off with a benevolent hand from Uther. Gwen shot Merlin a sympathetic look, surrendering her wine-jug to someone else and resting a hand on his elbow in brief comfort. A moment later, she was gone, following meekly in Morgana's wake.\nThankfully, Arthur followed her example not much later, and Merlin breathed a quiet sigh of relief as he followed him up to his chambers, bustling about his duties on aching feet as he prepared the prince for bed. He listened to him complaining about the splendour of the feast when their granaries were running low and nodded at the correct intervals. He did not miss the opportunity to point out how much Arthur had eaten, giving him a subtle prod in his (flat, toned) waist and laughing when Arthur tried to swat him in response.\n'Good night, Sire,' he murmured at last, pausing at the door to look back into the shadows of the room. Arthur managed a sleepy mumble from where he was cocooned safe and warm within his bed, and Merlin ignored his stab of jealousy. It would be a while yet before he found his rest, if he managed it at all.\nWith a lantern in one hand and the bag for collecting herbs slung over his shoulder, he made his way out of the gate, nodding to the sentries. The men gave him pitying looks, but they noted his departure. If nothing else, it was a matter of safety. That way if Merlin didn't return, they would at least know where he had been heading.\nIt was a long, dark, damp sort of night, where the air itself felt like the breath of some great beast. Merlin spent hours traipsing around, tripping over more than once. By the time he had all that he needed, dawn was a silver line upon the horizon and he had acquired half-a-dozen new bruises to his name.\nBlinking gritty eyes, Merlin resigned himself to a day spent half-asleep as he slogged back into Camelot, the braziers lighting the way with their cheery glow. He yawned as he entered the courtyard, blinking stupidly when a small figure stopped in front of him, forcing him to stumble to a halt.\nGwen's smile was all sympathetic dimples, and in her hand, offered up like ambrosia, was a slice of the papple pie, steaming softly in the morning chill. 'I almost lost my hand grabbing you a slice,' she explained. 'I thought you'd like it more than the scraps of bork.'\n'You're a goddess.' Merlin beamed at her before guiding her over to the rim of the well. Prizes like this were made to be shared, and none deserved it more than Gwen, who was thoughtful to the core. They perched on the stonework, passing the single fork back and forth between them as they demolished the buttery crust and the fruity innards. As they did so, the sun began to show its face, painting the cool blues of the sky in pink and gold.\n'You didn't have to do this. You must have been up late.'\n'Not as late as you,' she chided, her voice soft as she relieved him of the empty plate. 'Maybe let George look after Arthur today?'\n'I can't do that,' Merlin murmured. 'He'll have my job out from under me in a heartbeat.'\nGwen snorted. 'A year ago, you would have been delighted to be free of Arthur's servitude.'\n'Yeah, well... Now I'm not so sure Arthur could actually survive without me, and I don't need to live with that kind of guilt.' Merlin grinned, rolling his eyes as the morning bell chimed through the citadel. 'He may be Prince Prat, but he's sort of grown on me. Like mould.'\n'Oh, hush. You love him really.'\n'Yeah,' Merlin deadpanned. 'I adore being insulted and getting things thrown at my head on a daily basis. What's not to love?'\n'Well,' Gwen began, 'if you want to avoid that sort of thing, you could try such novel ideas as being on time, and actually doing the chores Arthur asks of you?'\n'Where would be the fun in that?' He hopped down from the rim of the well, the bag of herbs thumping against his hip as his mirth fell away into something softer. 'Thanks for this, Gwen. I mean it. And hey, the papple pie wasn't bad. Maybe the cook's onto something?'\n'Better than the bork, anyway.' She grinned, holding out her hand. 'Give that to me.' She gestured to the bag. 'I'll drop it off with Gaius. My lady won't awaken for a while, yet. I doubt you're going to be equally blessed.'\nAs if summoned by her words, there was the distinctive sound of one of the lead-paned windows being opened, and he winced as Arthur's distinctive bellow shattered the tranquillity.\n'\nMer\n-lin!'\nGwen laughed at the expression on his face, ushering him away with a wave of her hand. With one last grin, Merlin darted off. Life in Camelot could be a trial. Between looking after Arthur and keeping his secret, there were times he wondered why he had not set the citadel to his back months ago, but it was days like today that reminded him why he stayed.\nIn the end, it had nothing to do with dragons or destiny, and everything to do with the friends he had made. Friends like Gwen, Morgana and even, he supposed, Arthur. Despite everything, Camelot had become the place he called home.\nAnd that would never change."

What future do you see unfolding between them, and how might destiny intervene?",
        "story": "Pig's bones, runes, the obscurity of tarot: there were many tools with which Alan Deaton had learned to divine the future. All of them, he knew to treat with respect. They had ways of distilling the murk of possibility to portend the most likely path. He had turned to such methods more than once in his life, yet as he stood there in his veterinary surgery, watching Stiles Stilinski and Derek Hale snipe at each other, he needed no such assistance. He could see the path before them as clear as day.\nOf course, nothing was written in stone. A twist of fate could change everything, and yet as he observed them, he suspected that their destiny had a deep foundation. He witnessed the sharp edges and hurts that only time could heal, but he also saw that perhaps that day was closer than any of them might anticipate. Already, they had made progress, moving from a relationship based on nothing but intimidation and sarcasm. Now, he could see how they were starting to slot together, still striking sparks, perhaps, but learning to shore up one another's weaknesses and acknowledge their strengths.\nRelief was not an emotion he often entertained, yet in that moment, Alan allowed himself to relish the rush of it. What had happened to the Hale pack, and to Beacon Hills as a result, was nothing short of a calamity. The balance, once held in such perfect equilibrium, had tumbled into chaos, embellished with the agony of grief. Derek had not been born to lead, and yet despite his trauma, he faced the challenges before him. Still, Alan had feared he would struggle through his life in solitude. A lone wolf.\nThat seemed less likely, these days. A year ago, Alan would have been confident to place a sizable bet on such an outcome. Now, it seemed he would have lost, and he was glad for it. He had not wished to see Talia Hale's last surviving son fade to nothing but an echo of himself. He wanted to witness Derek seize both his heritage and his future with both hands. He wished to see him engage, rather than drifting through life, falling from one disaster to the next. He knew the apathy that, until recently, had haunted those hazel eyes, and he knew what lay at its end.\nExcept it seemed that Stiles had changed all that. Derek looked at him, and his face came alive. All that cold distance and bitter indifference fell to the wayside, revealing the vulnerable, hurting, healing man that lay beneath. Now, Derek was almost fanatical in his efforts to keep Stiles safe. Deaton had seen, with his own eyes, how Stiles had become Derek's number one priority, and it was a focus that Stiles returned in equal measure. Despite their differences and their arguments, time and again, they chose each other.\nNow, he saw them growing closer, the snarls losing their ferocity and the jibes their sharpness. They touched each other more. Stiles had initiated that, which was a bold move, as Derek hardly welcomed physical contact, but where he might flinch from others, he reached for Stiles in turn. Shoves softened to nudges, and grasping hands smoothed to flat palms, holding one another steady. Enmity found its truce as friendship set its roots, and now it hovered on the brink of something more.\nOh yes, Alan could see the future there, as plain as day.\nDerek Hale and Stiles Stilinski. A werewolf and his mate."
