        "writing_prompt": "Imprisoned in the Tower of London as a prisoner of war, Alexander Hamilton finds unexpected solace in the company of a clever raven, but as days pass without word of his fate, he begins to wonder why King George himself has summoned him across the ocean.",
        "story": "Alexander could hear the pattering of the rain from the Tower\u2019s barred window, raindrops splashing against the brick. He held out his hands, allowing the water to gather before closing his eyes and taking a drink. Sighing, he plunked back onto his cot and closed his eyes. He only knew time was passing as the sun rose and fell, as well as when the few meager meals were passed to him throughout the day.\nExhaustion had clung to him like a shadow those first few days. He had slept as much as he could during the nights aboard the ship that was spiriting him to England, though the guards had a nasty habit of waking him whenever he started to fall asleep. He had been taken from the ship in Portsmouth in a carriage to the Tower via orders by King George. Those first few nights in his prison cell, despite the slight chill of late spring, Alexander slept for nearly two days. It had alarmed the Tower guards enough that a physician was called for and he was examined, only for the doctor to conclude that he was indeed just suffering from exhaustion.\nNow he was awake and pacing the tiny confines of his \u201cquarters\u201d as the guards here liked to call them. To be honest, Alexander was expecting less as a prisoner of war; but his cell was fairly sized with a bed and a small table with a pitcher of water and a basin for washing. When he arrived at the Tower, he\u2019d been told that he would have an audience with the King. But days had gone by, and he still had no news of such a meeting.\nAlexander paced the length of his cell, thinking. What would be the purpose of going through all the trouble of capturing him? Why him? Surely being a Lt. Colonel was not important enough to be taken all the way to England and have an audience with King George of all people. There were high ranking generals from their side that should have garnered the \u201chonor,\u201d not him. And why an interview with the monarch of England? If that man thought he\u2019d get any information out of Alexander Hamilton, he would be sadly mistaken.\nHe drew a hand to his face and scrubbed at the stubble beginning to form into a full beard. The days of silence with only the sounds of the door shuttering open and the ravens below had begun to drive him slightly mad. It was so strange for him to experience loneliness after spending so much time in solitude following his mother's passing. But then, he had his military \u2018family.\u2019 At headquarters, he was surrounded by the everyday cacophony of the other soldiers talking, hurrying in an out with heavy footfalls. In the evenings, he, Laurens, Lafayette and the other aides gathered for supper and spoke voraciously or told jokes and laughed.\nNow he was in enemy hands, thousands of miles away from home and alone. There would be no rescue, only perhaps a prisoner exchange if he were lucky. At worst-but he didn\u2019t have to think about that. He was one of many, including Washington that were in open rebellion against the King of England and the penalty was death in any case. He didn\u2019t care. This rebellion would go on without him; Washington could surely find another right-hand man to carry out his correspondences and put up with his fits of temper.\nTo die a soldier\u2019s death would be the highest honor to his mind. Still, it nagged at him to be dragged all the way across the ocean for whatever nefarious purpose the monarch had in mind for him. Alexander knew the need to respond cautiously to questions by anyone (but especially the King) in order to avoid unintentionally revealing any information.\nA low gurgling croak garnered his attention. Looking up, Alexander saw the dark plume of a raven perched on the window\u2019s tiny ledge. The bird brought him a sense of joy as he gazed upon it. He strode to the window, feeling a cold breeze that made him shiver slightly.\n\u201cAfternoon, Archimedes.\u201d Alexander said while he fished in his pocket for the last bit of bread from breakfast earlier that day, breaking it into pieces and offering a bit to the raven. For entertainment, Alexander had taken to dropping bread into the courtyard when the guards weren\u2019t looking, then left it on the windowsill in hopes that they would fly up. Not long after, his plan had worked, a raven perched there every day to take proffered food from Alexander, and he in turn, had a little company in this cold, silent tower cell. He didn\u2019t know the birds' names (or if they even had one), but a bird had done so enough times that he had given it a name.\n\u201cHello.\u201d it responded in a clear enough tone that one could mistake it as a human. Alexander found that ravens were intelligent and with enough practice, would repeat words taught to them. He scratched under the raven\u2019s bill at its neck. He aimlessly pet the raven though his thoughts were elsewhere.\nAlexander let his shoulder sag and hand drop, the raven perching its head to one side with curiosity. He didn\u2019t want to die here, as just another traitor to the Crown...he wanted to die in battle, in glory and perhaps with his name in history books. Now he might not have that opportunity again.\nHe took a deep breath and closed his eyes, determined to find the courage to face whatever was about to happen. He opened them again, steeling himself for whatever was to come. For himself, for General Washington, for the Revolution. The raven squawked and flew away, leaving Alexander alone with his thoughts and his fate."

        "writing_prompt": "As the Revolutionary War drags on with mounting losses and dwindling morale, George Washington finds himself haunted by past failures and the weight of his soldiers' lives. One sleepless night, he vows to devise a strategy that could turn the tide\u2014but at what cost?",
        "story": "George Washington understood what losing was like. He had lost men horrifically when he was led into a massacre. He still could hear those men even in his sleep years later. He vowed to never allow such a thing to happen again, and he was determined to always be valiant in battle. He was known for his courage and bravery and for the numerous times he led his troops.\nThese last few months of the Revolution had been nothing but losses, both perceived and real. He needed a victory to reestablish his credibility and morale. He knew that the next battle would be crucial. Washington needed to make sure his troops were prepared and ready for the challenge.\nThe Brandy Wine campaign had ended in a draw, his beloved Major General Lafayette was shot in the leg as they retreated. And days ago, he thought his right-hand man Hamilton had perished in the Schuykill River, only for the young man to re-appear when they were drinking to his memory. The solemn atmosphere soon turned to laughter at their youngest appeared in the door, sopping wet from the river with a scowl.\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t it stop?\u201d George sighed, tapping his quill, the ink making messy, uneven splotches on the parchment.\nSighing, Washington stood and pushed his chair out from the desk, its screech loud as it slid on the floor. \u00a0He paced, thinking. The number of victories didn\u2019t balance with the losses they had this year in battle. These could not go on.\nDespite the training from Von Stuben and the improved military discipline, their defeats had still been humiliating, their victories costly, and the enemy seemed as numerous as ever. He had done his best, he knew. And that, after all, was all God and men could ask of him.\nGeorge took a step towards the door and taking a candle, strode down the hall towards the aides' room. Opening it quietly, as it was past midnight. He peered in and found, surprisingly, that Alexander lay asleep on his camp bed, snoring softly. Washington knew the young man worked too hard; the work piled on his shoulders like snow on a roof. In the other bed was Laurens, also sleeping soundly, if not more loudly by the sound of the snores.\nHe next took steps towards the second to last door of the wing and opened it slightly to reveal a lantern burning bright, a figure slumped in a chair next to the occupied bed. Stepping in, he saw Lafayette-Gilbert shifting uncomfortably in his bed, his face shining with sweat as he twisted in dreams. The Marquis twisted his head to the side, the flannel sliding from its place.\nWashington stepped in, placing the candle on a sideboard before turning to his young French friend. Taking the cloth, he dipped it in a nearby basin of water, squeezed out the excess, and returned it to Lafayette\u2019s forehead.\nHazy brown eyes opened as the Frenchman formed a smile on his lips as he whispered, \"Mon General.\" Weakly, he lifted his hand, attempting to reach out to Washington. Graciously, George took hold of Lafayette's hand and gave it a reassuring pat. \"Rest now, my friend. Sleep well and recover for me.\"\nGeorge let go of Lafayette's hand, carefully placing it back on the plush mattress. Lafayette's eyes, the color of rich chocolate, fluttered shut as he drifted back into a peaceful slumber. Picking up the candle again, Washington stepped back into the hallway and silently closed the door behind him. He returned to his quarters, setting the candle back down on his desk and opened a missive about military strategy from South Carolina.\nHe would work harder, vowed to put in extra effort, refine his military strategies, and ultimately emerge victorious, ensuring the safety of those entrusted to his command."

        "writing_prompt": "After a wine-fueled afternoon in the New Jersey woods, Lafayette bets he can retrieve honey from a wild beehive, dragging Hamilton, Laurens, and Mulligan into a chaotic misadventure involving angry bees, a pond, and a very unimpressed General Washington.",
        "story": "On a beautiful April day, four officers from the Continental Army made their way through the lush forests of New Jersey, their horses trotting gracefully. It was a rare day off, no more letters needed to be written, no more battle plans to draw up. Washington's aides gathered closely, sharing laughter that may have been a touch too boisterous, all thanks to the influence of a bottle of wine thoughtfully provided by Lafayette.\n\u201cN\u2019ah, bu- ya know what would be nice? Sumzin\u2019 I\u2019ve not had in a loooong while?\u201d Lafayette commented rather drunkenly, accidentally veering his horse off the road a bit.\nAlexander hiccupped feeling only slightly less drunk compared to the other three. \u201cWhat, Gilly?\u201d\nLafayette frowned, \u201cDon\u2019t call me \u2018Gilly\u2019, Mon Deui!\u201d He seemed to lose his train of though for a moment, his eyebrows knitting. \u201cI\u2019ve not had honey in a long time.\u201d\nNow it was Laurens turn to look a bit baffled. \u201cYou\u2019re spoiled\u2026.mon ami. We haven\u2019t had honey for...four years!\u201d And he put up four fingers to illustrate his point.\n\u2018America surely has bees, do they not?\u201d Lafayette whined, \u201cThey occur naturally as well in these woods, perhaps!\u201d He puffed out his chest. \u201cI know how to get it too! When I was a child in my hometown, I was able to bring home a whole honeycomb for my maman!\u201d\n\u201cMy friend, you\u2019re stories range from the fantastical to the ridiculous. \u201c Hercules muttered, his horse accidentally steering into Lafayette\u2019s before whinnying and returning to the road.\n\u201cI bet you a shilling that I can find some honey and bring it back to camp with us! Lafayette announced.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not even worth betting on, Laff,\u201d Laurens huffed. \u201cPlus, shouldn\u2019t you be using Continental Dollars for money?\u201d\n\u201cAh very well! I bet a whole Continental Dollar then.\u201d Lafayette waved a hand dismissively.\n\u201cStill not much to bet on,\u201d Groused Hercules.\nLafayette stopped his horse suddenly, giving a grunt of frustration as he sloppily jumped off his horse, then staggered into the woods.\n\u201cGilly!\u201d Alexander cried, also jumping off his horse to follow, which the others soon did as well. They hiked through the underbrush not far behind the Frenchmen.\nThey heard buzzing and Lafayette pointed up to a tree. \u201cThere, what did I tell you! It was easy to find them, no?\u201d\nSaid bees were swarming madly around the hive several feet above their heads as if they anticipated someone would attack them.\n\u2018Uh Laff, are you sure this is a good idea?\u201d Alexander asked warily, glancing from his friend to the beehive.\nLafayette waved a hand dismissively, \u201cOf course, of course! Now first, we have to get the bees to leave the nest. Alexandre, go get some leaves, Mulligan go get some rocks.\u201d\nWithin a few minutes, Hercules had made a circle with the rocks, while Hamilton piled leaves in the middle. Lafayette clapped his hands, \u201cWe must set fire to the leaves. The smoke will drive away the bees.\u201d\nAlexander looked slightly perplexed. \u201cUh\u2026.\u201d he padded his pocket\u2019s trying to find flint and steel. His eyes lit up as he called out, \u201cGot it!\u201d He sparked the leaves, the smoke rising and the bees' movements slowing, some even abandoning the hive.\n\u201cNow we must get it down.\u201d Lafayette instructed. \u201cAlexandre, you\u2019re the smallest of us, climb up and cut it down, will you?\u201d\nAlexander stared at his friend with wide, frantic eyes.\n\"\nGilbert\n, have you lost your mind?!\"\nHe glanced up at the high branches.\nLafayette pouted his lips. \u201cPlease? For me, Mon Ami?\u201d He put his hands together in a pleading gesture.\nAlexander rolled his eyes. \u201cAlright Gilbert. But if I break my arm\u2026.\u201d\nGilbert laughed. \u201cDon't worry, I won't let that happen. We\u2019ll help you up.\u201d\nHercules and Lafayette folded their hands and helped Alexander' grab onto the lowest branch. The West Indian climbed until he reached the beehive, leaning against the tree. \u201cThrow me up a branch or something I can hit it with!\u201d\nLaurens tossed a stick into the air, and Alexander swiftly snatched it, playfully swatting at the beehive in hopes that it would fall. The bees, however, were far from amused and swiftly swarmed towards him in a chaotic frenzy. Hamilton let out a startled yelp as he hurriedly descended, clumsily tumbling from the final branch and landing unceremoniously on his backside. The buzzing grew louder as the men got to their feet and ran as fast as they could. In no time, the bees swarmed closer, unleashing their fury by inflicting painful stings upon the men's faces, necks, and hands.\nStartled by the sight of a pond, it was Lafayette who screamed, \"Quickly, my friends, let's dive into the water!\" Without hesitation, all four men submerged themselves, keeping their heads underwater and holding their breaths until the bees dispersed.\nLafayette was the first out of the water. He was met with three drenched figures emerging from the pond, their uniforms clinging to their bodies. Their eyes were fixed on him, filled with a mixture of annoyance and disbelief.\n\"Next time, I won't trust your claims of being a nature enthusiast when you were younger, Laff,\" Hercules grumbled.\nThe four officers scrambled back to the horses, mounting them and racing back to camp with all due speed.\n~*~\nLaurens opened to the door cautiously, poking his head around it and motioned for the others to follow. The three other aides kept watch, hoping not to be seen by the General.\n\u201cHopefully the General is in his study, or out on a ride-\u201d Alexander began. \u201cPerhaps we can get upstairs and remove our wet clothes to dry before-\u201d\n\u201cGentlemen?\u201d The deep timbre of George Washington called from the stairwell, and the men froze in the spot. \u201cWhich one of you would you like to tell me why you all are sopping wet?\u201d\n\u201cEm\u2026. Your Excellency\u2026\u201d Laurens started, glancing at his friends and flummoxing for an explanation.\n\u201cMon General\u2026.\u201d Lafayette jumped in next trying to come up with an explanation that didn\u2019t include them being drunk for the whole of the afternoon.\n\u201cI accidentally struck a fallen beehive when we were trotting. We angered a bunch of bees enough that we had to take evasive action and dive into a pond, sir.\u201d Alexander remarked calmly.\nThe General's face was a mixture of bemusement and chagrin at his officers. \u201cAre you injured?\u201d\n\u201cJust some bee stings sir.\u201d Alexander acknowledged, wincing at the one on his hand.\n\u201cVery well, have McHenry see to them and then report back to me. There are some new missives to see to.\u201d Washington ordered.\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d the four men said in unison while saluting. When they heard the door to Washington\u2019s quarters close, they looked at each other with more than a little disbelief that they\u2019d gotten away with the lie.\n\u201cThanks, Hammie.\u201d Laurens patted him on the shoulder. \u201cQuick thinking on your part.\u201d\nThe four men went upstairs to have their stings seen to, fervently wishing that the only ones who would know of the day's events would stay between them.\n*~*\n\u201cOw!\u201d Alexander winced in pain as Doctor McHenry carefully applied alcohol to his bee-stung hand.\n\u201cAre you going to tell me what really happened, Hammie?\u201d the doctor asked, looking up at him with raised eyebrows as he wiped an alcohol-sodden piece of gauze on his forehead. \u201cConsidering that I can smell the liquor on your breath\u2026.\u2019 McHenry remarked with a raised eyebrow.\nAlexander remained calm while saying, \u201cWe had to have something to drink to relieve some of the pain of being stung so badly.\u201d\n\u201cMmhmm.\u201d McHenry replied. The doctor continued to clean and treat Alexander's bee stings, all the while shooting him a skeptical look. \"I don't recommend self-medicating with alcohol for bee stings, before or after the matter.\" McHenry said with a mischievous smile. \"Next time, come to me right away so I can treat you properly.\"\nAlexander nodded sheepishly, knowing he had been caught in a lie. Dr. McHenry was the one person he could rely on, without a doubt, to look after them and safeguard their silly escapades from the prying eyes of the General."

        "writing_prompt": "After James Madison is struck by lightning and falls into a coma, Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, unlikely allies, must navigate their shared guilt and grief while holding onto hope for their friend's recovery.",
        "story": "The rain poured relentlessly throughout the entire afternoon on that fateful June day. Inside the Philadelphia congress room, the atmosphere was charged with tension, mirroring the rumbling thunder outside. Even as the congressional session drew to a close for the day, the rain continued to fall steadily. Exiting the building, the men paused briefly to gauge the intensity of the rain before venturing out.\nJames Madison had finished a coughing fit near the doors when Thomas Jefferson stood next to him. \u201cYou alright, Jemmy?\u201d\nMadison put a hand up to signal that he was fine.\nThomas gazed out at the rain-soaked streets. \"Are you absolutely certain you want to brave this downpour and walk home?\"\nJames nonchalantly shrugged his shoulders. \"Walking in the rain is nothing new to me, Thomas,\" he retorted, his tone tinged with a hint of irritation towards his friend's over-protectiveness. \u201cBesides, I need to think on the matter of Hamilton\u2019s Assumption Bill.\u201d\nThomas snorted derisively, \u201cYou\u2019re really going to consider it? \u00a0What about the South?\u201d\nMadison shook his head. \"I won't cast my vote on it, that's for sure. However, Hamilton did manage to present some compelling arguments. Perhaps I can turn the other delegates of the North to it.\" \u00a0He popped open his umbrella, taking a few steps down the stairs before turning back with a wave, \u201cHave a good day, Thomas.\u201d\nThomas opted to wait for the rain to stop before making his own way home, in case he accidentally encountered any puddles along the way. Even if that meant that he bumped into Hamilton if the Treasury Secretary deigned to go home at a decent time. He glanced down the street to see Jemmy, who had paused to place a hand on a lantern post to cough into his handkerchief.\nThomas glanced towards the stairwell and caught sight of Hamilton making his way down the steps. Hamilton seemed lost in thought, his gaze fixed on the rain outside, completely oblivious to Thomas's presence.\nThomas was taken aback when he noticed Hamilton flinching at the sudden boom of thunder that echoed through the air. Both of them had heard it, and it seemed to have caught Hamilton off guard.\nThey heard a chilling scream from a short distance that Thomas could feel in his bones, the fear heightening within him. He looked out to see James thrown several feet backwards from the post he had been leaning against and now lay prone on the pavement.\n\u201cOh, god, Jemmy!\u201d Thomas shouted, abandoning his corner of the building, no longer caring about anything but James. He knelt next to his friend. \u201cJemmy!\u201d Thomas shouted, eyes wide with shock. He slapped his fellow Virginian lightly on the cheek in hopes of waking him.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d the voice of Hamilton cried, kneeling on the other side of the stricken Virginian. He looked from Madison to the lantern post. \u201cI think he got hit by lightning.\u2019 He placed to fingers to the man\u2019s neck, then under his nose. \u201cShit, he\u2019s not breathing!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Thomas exclaimed and looked up wild-eyed at the Treasury Secretary, his eyes racing back to Jemmy.\n\u201cHelp me get him back inside the building.\u201d Alexander commanded. Thomas was still looking horrified down at his friend.\n\u201cHamilton lost his temper. \"Jefferson, pull yourself together! For God's sake, help me!\u201d They heard a clap of thunder that cracked in the sky and winced, Hamilton more so than him. \"Do you want to be struck by lightning as well?!\"\nThomas suddenly snapped out of his daze, his eyes focusing on Madison. Without hesitation, he firmly grasped his shoulders, while Hamilton swiftly took hold of his legs. Together, they hurriedly made their way back into Federal Hall, gently placing him on a nearby bench.\nHamilton quickly peeled away James\u2019 coat and waistcoat, interlocking his fingers and pressing on Madison\u2019s chest in short intervals.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u2019 Jefferson shouted while watching the Treasury Secretary push on Madison\u2019s chest.\n\u201cReviving his heart is crucial. Once his heart starts beating, the other organs will naturally follow suit.\" \u00a0Alexander said breathlessly as he continued to pump Madison\u2019s chest. \u201cI\u2019ve read about it in medical books when I briefly studied medicine. And I\u2019ve seen it done on the islands.\u201d\nJefferson stood in silence, his hand hanging by his side, his fists clenched tightly as he helplessly observed Hamilton's desperate attempts to revive his friend.\nHamilton shouted over his shoulder, \u201cJefferson, get over here and keep checking for a pulse!\u201d\nThomas rushed over to his friend's side, avoiding eye contact with Jemmy's ashen complexion as he gently pressed two fingers against his pulse point. In that moment, he fervently whispered a silent prayer, hoping to sense the reassuring rhythm of a heartbeat. \u00a0He shut his eyes tightly, taking his friend\u2019s limp hand, silently urging\nCome on, Jemmy!\nIt was reminiscent of when he had experienced the loss of Martha, her complexion drained and her vitality fading. The last moments they shared were etched in his memory. He had locked himself away after her passing, fully embracing grief like a blanket pulled over himself to shield him from the light.\nHe waited, his heart pounding in his chest, as he felt warmth in Jemmy\u2019s trembling hand. He heard a gasp and felt a pulse at his friend\u2019s neck. Jefferson watched with untold relief and eyes wide at his friend\u2019s chest rising and falling again.\nHamilton's breaths were ragged as he desperately attempted to push his disheveled hair away from his face and watched his former friend breathe. \u201cThank God.\u201d Alexander whispered. He turned to Jefferson, \u201cWe need to get him to a hospital. I got his heart going, but he still needs medical attention.\u201d\n\u201cI think he\u2019d prefer to be taken home. Dolley can care for him, and we can summon a doctor from there.\u201d Thomas replied, looking down at his friend.\nAlexander seemed to contemplate this for a moment, then nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll go hail a cab. See if we can\u2019t get the driver to help us carry him.\u201d He rushed out onto the pavement without an umbrella, calling for a cab with a wave of his hand. After speaking with the driver for a moment, both men returned to the entryway to carry Jemmy to the awaiting carriage, putting him on the opposite bench while Hamilton and Jefferson sat on the other side. As the coach began to move, the two men stared ahead, not speaking for a while.\n\u201cHamilton, I...I didn\u2019t thank you for saving his life. That was quick thinking on your part.\u201d Thomas finally said. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been there\u2026. I don\u2019t think he would have made it.\u201d\nThe Treasury Secretary shrugged. \u201cIt was just luck I had seen the procedure before.\u201d He stared out of the window and said with a quieter tone. \u201cI've witnessed countless lives lost in the past, and I\u2019ll do everything I can to save others.\u201d\nThomas nodded dumbly, not really sure what to say to that.\nIt was not far from Federal Hall that they stopped in front of a red-brick two story townhouse, and Thomas sprang out. He turned to Hamilton, \u201cI\u2019d better go tell Mrs. Madison about the situation to prepare her.\u201d\nThomas did so, and Alexander could see the plump, middle aged woman who answered the door when he knocked. The woman\u2019s face became pale, and she placed her hands to her lips in shock. Thomas signaled for them to bring James inside the house. Both Alexander and the driver worked to bring the ailing Virginian up the stairs. Dolley directed them to a guest room on the first floor while she hustled out the door to get a doctor who lived two doors down.\nHamilton and Jefferson waited at James\u2019 bedside in silence. Thomas picked up Jemmy\u2019s hand to squeeze it as a signal to the man that he was there but gasped. \u201cMy God!\u201d\nAlexander sprang out of his seat as he hurriedly made his way towards Madison. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nThomas pushed up James\u2019 shirt sleeve to reveal fern like patterns on the skin where the lightning must have traveled up the arm.\n\u201cHamilton,\u201d Jefferson\u2019s voice shook, \u201cWhat if James is permanently damaged? What if the lightning strike affected his brain?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re still his friend, Thomas.\u201d Hamilton replied quietly. \u201c\"Just make sure you're there for him.\"\nNot long after, a tall, stately looking man with a receding hairline holding a doctor\u2019s bag entered. \u201cMr. Jefferson?\u201d He glanced over to Alexander.\n\u201cI\u2019m Mr. Hamilton.\u201d Hamilton added quickly, shaking hands briefly.\n\u201cMrs. Madison tells me that James has been struck by lightning?\u201d He said, removing bottles of medicine and a spring lancet from his black bag.\n\u201cHe-\u201d Jefferson began hoarsely before clearing his throat and trying again. \u201cHe was. Mr. Hamilton did chest compressions to restart his heart.\u201d\nThe older man\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of that technique before. Someday I must see it in action. Now gentleman, I need to examine my patient, so I\u2019d appreciate it if you would both wait outside. You as well, Mrs. Madison.\u201d\nThey cleared the sickroom, waiting instead in the sitting room. Mrs. Madison paced, then in want of something to do, went to make them tea.\nAn even greater silence ensued before he spoke up again. \u201cYou said you studied medicine briefly?\u201d\nHamilton raised his shoulders. \u201cI did. I had every intention to become a doctor but\u2026. I struggled with chemistry.\u201d *\nJefferson\u2019s eyebrows rose at that. \u201cI assumed you never struggled with anything, Hamilton.\u201d\nHamilton smiled sadly. \u201cYou assumed incorrectly. But I'm glad I decided to pursue law instead. It's been the right path for me.\" He sneezed, which prompted a \u2018bless you\u2019 from Jefferson and Mrs. Madison.\nAn hour later, the doctor emerged once again, his face filled with concern as he cast a quick glance at the trio anxiously waiting for any news on Jemmy\u2019s condition. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Mr. Madison is in a coma.\u201d\nThe shock was evident on the faces of all three of them. Mrs. Madison quickly reached for a handkerchief, using it to conceal her overwhelming sorrow. \u00a0\u201cWill...will he\u2026.?\u201d Mrs. Madison began but couldn\u2019t seem to allow herself to fully ask the question that was on everyone\u2019s mind.\n\u201cI will tell you, it may be some time before he wakes, if at all. I do not know if there was damage to his brain, we will not know until he awakens. \u00a0But I have bled him and hopefully his humors will balance out enough to mitigate the damage.\u201d The doctor continued.\nAt that moment, Alexander sneezed into his elbow, which prompted another \u2018bless you\u2019 from the other three occupants in the room. \u201cMr. Hamilton, Mr. Jefferson, you\u2019ve been in those wet clothes for over an hour. You need to go home and change before you both catch a chill. I will return tomorrow to check in on him.\u201d\nWith a solemn understanding, both men exchanged meaningful looks, silently acknowledging the shared sorrow that weighed heavily upon them. Their message was clear; they understood and respected each other's pain.\n\u201cI...I should return home.\u201d Hamilton said quietly, not meeting Jefferson\u2019s eyes, \u201cI\u2019m sure Eliza is waiting for me. If you\u2019ll excuse me?\u201d He nodded to them before departing from the Madison\u2019s residence. Jefferson soon did the same, sinking into the carriage to spirit him back to his own house.\nThomas wearily ascended the stairs to his townhouse, his steps faltering as he reached his destination. With a sense of familiarity, he entered his library, shutting the door behind him to embrace the solace it offered. Overwhelmed by the deafening silence, he surrendered to despair, burying his face in his hands and weeping uncontrollably."

        "writing_prompt": "When James Madison collapses during a visit to Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, a long-held secret about his health is revealed, testing the strength of their friendship and the burdens they share.",
        "story": "Jemmy\u2019s visits to Monticello were always the highlight of his journeys home. They met during a break in government early in April 1794. James Madison work as a House Representative did not allow him many days of reprieve to visit his friend at his house in Virginia, so those time that he could meet with his friend were always appreciated.\nJemmy sipped his brandy that had been proffered by Thomas, listening to the ticking grandfather clock.\nHe took a sip while their was a lull in their conversation. \u201cI noticed the bust of Alexander Hamilton you had added to your entryway hall. Thomas.\u201d He looked down at the brandy\u2019s dark amber color. \u201cThat surprises me.\u201d\nThe former Secretary of State merely shrugged. \u00a0\u201cThey will oppose themselves in death and in life.\u201d\nMadison took another sip of whiskey. \u201cI hope you aren\u2019t telling me something, Thomas.\u201d\nThomas laughed a little. \u201cNo, I\u2019m in good health, Jemmy. So is Hamilton, I hear.\u201d He gave his friend a concerned look replacing the mirth. \u201cYou don\u2019t look well, Jemmy. Your hand is twitching.\u201d\nJames glanced at his trembling hand, his lips pursed in concern. \"It's nothing to worry about, Thomas. I've simply been writing excessively lately.\" Rising to his feet, he added, \"May I borrow your water closet?\"\nJefferson frowned at Jemmy\u2019s avoidance of the question. \u201cYou know where it is, Jemmy.\u201d\nJefferson watched as his fellow Virginian nodded and exited the sitting room, leaving him alone with his thoughts. A heavy sigh escaped his lips as he shook his head in disappointment. He couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness, wishing that Jemmy would let down his guard and confide in him as Thomas often confided in him.\nHe waited patiently, listening to the grandfather clock in a corner, sipping slowly at his brandy. Looking up, Thomas found that it had been nearly ten minutes since his friend had left. His eyebrows knitted, concerned. Thomas got up and paced for a few minutes, more time ticking away and his worry heightening. \u00a0Finally, he gave a resigned sighed and went to find Jemmy.\nThomas cautiously approached the water closet, tapping gently on the door only to find it open. \u00a0An unsettling feeling gnawed at him. \"Jemmy?\" He called out, walking down a hallway that led to the kitchen. Perhaps his friend had gone for a glass of water. Silence greeted him, and his stomach twisted into knots.\nHe turned down a hallway. \u201cJemmy?\u201d He found his friend lying face down prone on the tiled floor, blood smearing the tile. He rushed over to his side, kneeling away from the blood that had oozed from his head.\n\u201cJimmy!\u201d He qently flipped his friend over, revealing a deep gash on his forehead. Stepping back in shock, he urgently called for help. \u201cJerome!\u201d\nHis servant appeared, taken in the scene with a little shock before meeting Jefferson\u2019s eyes. \u201cSend for his doctor, quickly now! And tell Daniel to come help me!\u201d\n*~*\nTwenty minutes later, Thomas was called into the room where Jemmy was being examined.\nDoctor Renault spoke up after straightening up. \u201cHe\u2019s alright, Mr. Jefferson. He just hit his head on the table he was trying to steady himself on perhaps.\u201d James sported a square bandage that concealed the left corner of his head, \u00a0his eyebrows knitted even in unconsciousness. His expression grew more serious. \u201cMr. Madison suffers from epileptic fits at times.\u201d\nThomas cast a quick glance at his companion, his voice trembling as he echoed, \"Epileptic fits?\" He repeated with a tremble. Jemmy never mentioned that he suffered from that.\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t usually very terrible, though things like alcohol can sometimes trigger them.\u201d Doctor Renault continued. \u00a0 Could that be the reason behind Jemmy's small sips of whiskey during their conversation?\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine, Mr. Jefferson.\u201d Doctor Renault remarked, packing up his bag. \u201cMr. Madison will likely need something to replace the lost blood. I recommend some broth or hearty soup. He\u2019ll probably be dizzy, so you might want him to stay in bed for a while.\u201d \u00a0He nodded to Thomas. \u201cGood day, Mr. Jefferson.\u201d\n*~*\nWhen Jemmy woke sometime later, he found Thomas in a chair next to him. His friend came over to the bed, face darkened with worry. \u201cJemmy? How are you feeling?\u201d\nThe tall Virginian saw Madison wince. \u201cMy head aches.\u201d He muttered, putting a hand to his forehead and felt the bandage with a frown.\n\u201cYou fell down in one of the hallways, Jemmy.\u201d Thomas said quietly, \u201chit your head on the edge of a side table, apparently.\u201d He poured a glass of water for Jemmy and handed it to him. His friend took it with a nod, then drank it down. \u201cWhen you were going to tell me you suffered from epilepsy, Jemmy?\u201d he asked quietly.\nJames looked at the glass rather than at Thomas. \u201cI suppose the Doctor told you?\u201d\nThomas pursed his lips. \u201cHe did.\u201d He sat next to Jemmy again in the chair. \u201cWhen are you planning to tell me?\u201d\n\u201cI was going to tell you tonight.\u201d He looked down, his voice breaking. \u201cForgive me, Thomas. I didn\u2019t want to burden you with my suffering.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re my friend, Jemmy. I share your burdens and you share mine.\u201d He placed a reassuring hand on his friend\u2019s shoulder. \u00a0He stood, \u201cNow, I\u2019ve had my cook make you up a nice hearty soup. Doctor Renault said you would need to build back your blood. Shall we dine in here or would you like to sit in the dining room?\u201d\n\u201cHere would be fine, if that\u2019s alright with you?\u201d Thomas saw by the relaxed shoulders that a weight being lifted off Jemmy's shoulders. He smiled at his friend and thanked him for the kind gesture. They sat down to eat, enjoying the warm soup and the company.\nAs they finished their meal, Jemmy couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of contentment and peace. They both knew that no matter what challenges they may face, each had a friend by his side who would always be there for him."

        "writing_prompt": "While investigating suspicions of treason, Alexander Hamilton stumbles upon a dangerous conspiracy involving Benedict Arnold, British soldiers, and a trap set just for him\u2014now bound and at their mercy, how will he escape?",
        "story": "Alexander Hamilton was wary around Benedict Arnold these days. He had respect for the man; he was a good soldier after all. And he was a brave one as he was shot in the leg during the battle of Quebec that caused a permanent limp, and again in the second battle of Saratoga that he recovered from with little difficulty. They had been cordial and professional during their meetings, but Alexander sensed a change in the man, he seemed cagey and on edge all the time. He had read the letter from Peggy Shippen to Arnold. Though not couched with overt undertones of treason, they had begun their suspicions of the pair, and Alexander was sent under false pretenses to Arnold\u2019s house to gather surveillance.\nGeneral Washington sent Alexander to deliver a message to General Arnold. \u00a0Alexander calmly approached the entrance of the luxurious mansion that Arnold had recently acquired. Mrs. Peggy Arnold, formally Peggy Shippen answered the door herself, which surprised him. He however bowed and straightened up before asking, \u201cIs General Arnold at home?\u201d\nHer pretty expression turned confused. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d\n\u201cLt. Colonel Hamilton, ma\u2019am.,\u201d he answered, touching his cap. \u201cI have a letter for your husband from General Washington.\u201d\nHer expression was one of puzzlement as she stepped out of the door frame to let him step inside. \u201cI\u2019ll tell my husband that you\u2019re here, Colonel Hamilton.\u201d\nAlexander waited at parade rest as the woman disappeared and Arnold appeared, saluting him as he closed the distance between them. \u201cColonel Hamilton? What brings you here?\u201d\nWith a respectful salute, he passed the letter to General Arnold. \"A message from General Washington, sir.\"\n\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Arnold returned pleasantly. \u201cI appreciate you making the trip to deliver this.\"\nAlexander merely nodded. \u201cJust doing my duty, sir.\u201d\nArnold gave him a tight-lipped smile. \u201cWell, thank you, Hamilton. I-\u201d\nAt that moment, another soldier entered the parlor who Alexander knew was Major Anderson. \u201cAh, Colonel Hamilton, good day.\u201d\nHamilton nodded his head. \u201cGood day, Major Anderson, I just came to deliver a letter to General Arnold. I shall take my leave now that my duty has been dispensed. Good day, gentleman.\u201d He bowed shallowly, then exited the house.\nAlexander still felt something was off even as he mounted his horse. Better to stay out of sight and observe. He walked his horse onto a high cliff that was hidden by trees but had a good view of Arnold\u2019s house. It wasn\u2019t long before Arnold and Anderson appeared outside. His attention returned to the Redcoats galloping up to the house and got off their horses before saluting both. Why was Arnold meeting Redcoats...their enemy? With a sickening realization, Hamilton realized that Arnold and Anderson were turncoats.\nHe was about to turn tail and race back to General Washington\u2019s headquarters when a rather large stone tumbled down the cliff face loud enough that it caused the soldiers to look up at Alexander\u2019s position on the cliff, as he ducked behind a tree to hide himself. Both the turncoats and the British soldiers scrambled back onto their horses.\nAlexander ran towards where he had hidden his horse and took off with hope that they would not follow, taking a less traveled road to throw them off the scent. Silently he prayed that there would be a shelter or home he could duck into for shelter and safety.\nHe didn\u2019t hear a horse\u2019s cantor behind him and allowed his heart to slow. Alexander rode a while until he saw a small ramshackle wood home whose chimney smoked merrily. He sighed in relief as he slowed his horse until he reached it. Alexander went to the back of the house to the stables found no horses. Odd. Perhaps the men of the household were out for work. Leaving his horse there, Alexander went to the front door and knocked. There was no answer.\nHow curious Alexander thought. After a few knocks, Alexander tentatively jiggled the doorknob and twisted it, surprised to find that it was open. Cautiously stepping in, he called loudly enough to be heard in the small house, \u201cHello? Is anyone at home?\u201d He was again met with silence. His senses heightened; Alexander could sense something was not right about this situation. He pulled out his pistol and held it out, just in case.\nHe went from the tiny parlor to the kitchen, finding that no one seemed to be here. Sweat began to trickle down his forehead to his neck. Alexander heard a thump from a far room and his heart raced again and he heard the sound again. His eyes went wide when he found a dark-haired peasant woman and her daughter tied up and gagged back-to-back, looking up at him with terrified eyes. \u00a0Holstering his weapon, Alexander rushed to their side to untie them, freeing them of their gags.\n\u201cI\u2019m Lt. Colonel Hamilton.\u201d He said gently. \u201cWhat happened, ma\u2019am?\u201d\nThe woman said between breathless sobs, \u201cA-a Redcoat came in here, he said they were waiting for an enemy soldier to pass by!\u201d\nFrom behind him, he heard the click of a gun. \u201cNice to meet you, Colonel Hamilton.\u201d a high toneless man\u2019s voice rang behind him.\nAlexander raised his hands and stood to face the man who was a rough looking British soldier. How did you know I\u2019d be here?\u201d He growled.\nThe soldier flashed a wide grin, revealing his teeth. \"We've been tailing you ever since you set foot in West Point. The Major predicted you'd start poking around once he showed up. It was only a matter of time before you made your move.\"\nAlexander's stomach churned with unease. It was all a trap. The letter from Washington was genuine, but encountering Arnold and Anderson with the British troops was a setup. The moment he attempted to slip away back to his camp, he was being shadowed.\n\u201cGeneral Arnold will reward me for capturing you.\u201d The soldier sneered, disarming Hamilton of his pistol and saber. Wrenching Hamilton\u2019s hands behind his back, he shouted to the woman. \u201cGet me some rope, woman!\u201d\nThe lady of the house nodded with fright and retrieved the ropes and offered them to the British Soldier who sneered. \u00a0\u201cTie him up!\u201d At her hesitation, he yelled \u201cNOW, WOMAN!\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that,\u201d Alexander snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re frightening the lady and her child.\u201d\nThe British soldier laughed cruelly, not taking Alexander seriously. \"Oh, and who's going to stop me? You, the prisoner?\"\nShe jumped and did as she was told, tying the rope around him, all the while casting him an apologetic glance that met his gaze. His response was a mere nod, silently acknowledging that she was taking this action solely to protect herself and her daughter from harm.\nThe Redcoat pushed Alexander in front of him, then turned back his head to the woman. \u201cThank you for your hospitality, ma\u2019am.\u201d\nHe kicked Alexander in the back, making him stumble and the officer to laugh. \"We have plans for you, Hamilton.\""

        "writing_prompt": "In the freezing winter at Morristown, a young Alexander Hamilton battles a relentless illness, haunted by memories of loss, until an unexpected caretaker\u2014Lady Washington herself\u2014offers him comfort, hope, and a reminder of his resilience.",
        "story": "Alexander shivered uncontrollably as he lay in his tent at Morristown. The bitter cold seemed to seep into his bones, and his chest burned with each painful breath he took. He knew he was sick, but he had hoped that it was just a minor cough or cold. He had taken ill before the battle of Trenton but insisted on marching to the battlefield. He had also taken part of in the battle of Princeton, his health only slightly better. But in the days after the battles, his condition only worsened. Despite his illness, Alexander tried to remain stoic and soldier on. He continued to fulfill his duties as best as he could, but it was clear to his comrades that he was struggling.\nOne evening in mid-January, Hercules found Alexander stumbling slightly back to his tent and walked alongside him. \u201cHey Alex? You alright?\u201d His eyebrows knitted with concern, \u201cyou look a little pale.\u201d\nAlexander just waved a dismissive hand after a coughing fit. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Herc; it\u2019s just cold.\u201d\nHer\nHis friend gave him an unconvinced look, but soon changed the subject. \u201cDid you hear who\u2019s coming to Morristown?\u201d At Alexander\u2019s puzzled expression, Mulligan said, \u201cThe General\u2019s lady.\u201d\n\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Alexander said distractedly.\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t sound enthusiastic or anything.\u201d Hercules said, rolling his eyes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as though she\u2019s going to visit the men in the cabins, Herc.\u201d He sighed, though I have orders for the men to freshen them up and clean up the camp.\u201d He gave his friend a re-assuring smile. \u201cI\u2019m going to turn in for a while. We have to start work tomorrow.\u201d\n~*~\nThe next day, Alexander oversaw the men as they worked to clean up the camp in preparation for Mrs. Washington's visit. He worked tirelessly, making sure that every detail was perfect, and every task was completed to his high standards.\nAs the day wore on, Alexander couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of pride as he saw the camp begin to transform into a more presentable and welcoming place. He knew that the General\u2019s lady would be impressed with their efforts, and he was determined to make sure that everything went smoothly.\nWhen General\u2019s Washington's wife finally arrived, Alexander stood off to the side, watching with a sense of satisfaction as she waved to the men from inside her carriage. When the carriage passed by, Alexander coughed harshly.\n\u201cAlex?\u201d Mulligan held his shoulder as he coughed.\n\u2018\u2019'm alright.\u201d Alexander said breathlessly.\nHercules held his shoulders and guiding him back to his tent.\n~*~\nOne night, as the wind howled outside and the snow fell heavily, Alexander's condition took a turn for the worse. He was wracked with violent coughing fits, and his breathing became labored.\n\u201cAlex?\u201d Laurens called after knocking on his private quarters. When there was no answer, Laurens entered the tent at his leave. He found the younger man doubled over trying to catch his breath.\nHe heard Laurens yell and his comrades rushed to his side, their faces grim with worry. \"We need to get him to the hospital tent,\" one of them said urgently. They carefully lifted Alexander and carried him through the freezing night to the medical tent.\nA doctor came into his view, peering down at him. To his friends, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nA muffled voice called above him, \u201ccoughing\u2026. can\u2019t breathe\u2026\u201d\nAlexander's forehead was met with a cool touch. \"He's running a fever,\"\u00a0someone exclaimed. His chest was exposed, with a hand pressed against it.\nIt was impossible for him to control the shiver that ran through his body. An illness was extremely dangerous. especially so when combined with the lack of proper food rations and the freezing temperatures. However, before he could dwell on these thoughts any further, Alexander succumbed to the overwhelming fatigue and drifted into a shallow slumber.\n*~*\nHe felt something soft being lifted to his shoulders, a quiet feminine voice gently hushing him. Was that his mother trying to comfort him while he was ill? Alexander felt so cold even as flushes of heat stole over his body. \u00a0He opened his eyes to find an old woman with a round face and a kind expression looking down at him. His foggy brain took a moment to realize that she was not one of the nurses that cared for patients, but Lady Washington herself.\n\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d he croaked tiredly trying to nod his head slightly, though it made his headache.\nShe smiled sweetly. \u201cWould you care for some water?\u201d With a slight nod, the Lady lifted his head and pressed a tin cup to his lips. He took a few sips before shaking his head to signal that he didn\u2019t want any more. Her expression became a little sad, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re so ill, Captain Hamilton.\u201d Her look was one of concern. \u201cMy husband wrote me that you were to be promoted to Colonel and become his new aide-de-camp.\u201d She swept a hand through his sweaty hair and half-smiled. \u201cYou are so young! Though, much could be said for that young Frenchman\u2026. \u00a0Monsieur Lafayette?\u201d\nAlexander laughed a little which turned into a cough.\nLady Washington offered him more water. \u00a0We shall get you better, young man.\u201d\nAlexander nodded weakly, grateful for her kindness. \u201cThank you, ma\u2019am. I appreciate your care.\u201d\nLady Washington patted his hand gently before standing up. \u201cRest, Captain Hamilton. I will check on you later.\u201d\nAs she left the room, Alexander felt a sense of comfort wash over him as his tired eyelids began to fall. He was in good hands with Lady Washington looking out for him.\n*~*\nHis fever didn\u2019t abate that night; in fact, it raged like a wildfire while he turned in its throes, a cold cloth pressed to his forehead while a feminine voice repeated quietly that he would be okay.\n\u201cCome Brave Heart, you can beat this fever.\u201d He heard Lady Washington\u2019s voice; she whispered soothing words, her hand brushing back his damp hair. He groaned in pain, his body trembling with chills as the fever and pained coughs continued to torment him. But her presence brought a sense of comfort, a sliver of hope in the darkness of his sickness.\nDespite the passing days, his fever continued to rage, leaving him in a state of confusion. In those brief moments of wakefulness, he could only make out the faces of Lady Washington and the doctor. Alexander's delirium caused him to be trapped in the suffocating heat that reminded him of the nights he battled illness while his mother succumbed to it.\nClutching his blankets tightly, he whimpered, desperately pleading, \"Please... I don't want to die.\" His tormented mind remained on that island, in the same bed where his mother took her last breaths, unable to escape the haunting memories.\nLady Washington reached out, grasping Alexander's hand in comfort. \"You will not die, my dear. We will care for you and help you through this sickness.\"\nThe doctor worked tirelessly, administering medicines and cool cloths to bring down his fever and relieve his terrible coughing fits. Lady Washington's eyes were calm even as she continued to sit by his side, offering words of encouragement and prayers for his recovery.\nAs the days passed, Alexander's delirium began to lift, his fever broke, leaving him weak but alive.\nHe slowly regained his strength. He looked up one morning to find the Great Lady humming quietly while darning socks. Alexander glanced gratefully at Lady Washington, his voice hoarse as he whispered, \"Thank you.\"\nLady Washington smiled softly, brushing a strand of hair away from his flushed face. \"You are strong, Alexander. You have survived so much already, Brave Heart.\u201d\nAlexander never forgot the kindness and compassion shown to him by Lady Washington. She had been his saving grace in his time of need, and he carried her memory with him."

        "writing_prompt": "After his duel with Aaron Burr, Alexander Hamilton awakens in a misty realm, greeted by familiar faces from his past and guided by Saint Peter. As he navigates the afterlife, he reunites with loved ones, old friends, and even his mentor, George Washington, while grappling with the legacy he left behind. What awaits Alexander in this eternal second act?",
        "story": "\u201cAlexander Hamilton?\u201d A voice echoed through the mist, calling out his name.\nStartled, Alexander blinked his eyes open, only to discover that he was completely enveloped in a thick fog.\n\u201cH-hello?\u201d Alexander said nervously. Hadn\u2019t it been a clear morning in New Jersey when-?\nHe gasped, feeling his side for a wound that no longer seemed to be there. He remembered the tear-stained faces of Eliza and Angelica and the innocent oneks of his children in his last moments, then darkness.\nThe fog lifted, and an ancient looking man stood before a white marble podium. If Alexander\u2019s heart was still beating, it surely would have been beating loudly in his chest. \u201cA-are you...Saint Peter?\u201d The last part of his question was asked with awed reverence.\nThe old man nodded. \u201cI am, Alexander; son of Rachel Faucette and James Hamilton senior.\u201d\nAlexander gulped. \u201cI\u2019m-I\u2019m dead, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\nSaint Peter's solemn voice confirmed his fears. \"Yes, Alexander, I'm afraid so. However, there is solace in knowing that you have arrived in the realm of Paradise.\"\nAlexander looked behind him perplexed, then back to St. Peter. \u201cBut...\u201d He seemed to hesitate. \u201cI\u2019m allowed here after\u2026..\u201d He didn\u2019t finish the sentence as there was no doubt any of his indiscretions on Earth were known here in Heaven.\nSt. Peter nodded knowingly. \"Yes, Alexander, we are aware of your past mistakes. But here in Heaven, all are forgiven. Your sins have been washed away, and you are now welcomed with open arms into the kingdom of God.\"\nAlexander was taken aback by the sheer grace and forgiveness being offered to him. He felt a weight lifted off his shoulders and tears welled up in his eyes. \u201cI was foolish\u2026\u201d he sniffled and tried to wipe away the tears. \u201cBut\u2026.I didn\u2019t think Aaron would have shot me.\u201d\nSt. Peter placed a comforting hand on Alexander's shoulder. \"We understand, Alexander. Earthly conflicts and misunderstandings often lead us astray. Aaron, too, will find his peace and redemption in God's loving embrace.\"\nAlexander's tears began to subside as he listened to St. Peter's reassuring words. A sense of peace washed over him, and he felt a newfound sense of gratitude for the forgiveness and love that surrounded him in Heaven.\n\u201cNow,\u201d Saint Peter put a hand onto his shoulder and walked to a set of gilded gold gates that towered high above both their heads that opened soundlessly. \u201cThere are some people who are awaiting you.\u201d\nAlexander found himself floating slightly off the clouds underneath his feet as he moved without feeling it. A familiar place came into view as the mist cleared; a house on a bluff overlooking the sea. In the garden, he saw a woman kneeling over a bed of flowers, wearing a bonnet that he remembered from all those years ago.\n\u201cMother.\u2026\u201d He whispered, tears nearly coming to his eyes again as they set on the woman who had raised him and died after so many hardships she suffered in her life.\nThe soft exclamation seemed to garner her attention enough for her to look up. Now, she looked as she did when he was young; beautiful and free of the sadness that sapped it away.\nHis mother stood and ran to him, embracing him fondly with tears streaming down his face. \u201cAlexander!\u201d When she stepped out of his arms, she regarded him with fondness. \u201cLook at you, all grown up.\u201d she pushed a tendril of hair from his forehead. She smiled, \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, Alex. You\u2019ve done so much I could never dream of.\u201d She kissed his cheek. \"Your wife Eliza is lovely.\u201d\nThere was a dart in his heart at the mention of Eliza since his arrival in Heaven. \u201cI was foolish mother, I engaged in a duel and lost everything.\u201d\nShe stroked his cheek. \u201cYou haven\u2019t, Alexander. God willing, you family will arrive in time, and you\u2019ll be re-united.\u201d\nHis shoulders sank as he nodded. \u201cI suppose so.\u201d The pain of missing Eliza and his family was still raw, even in the afterlife. But he took comfort in his mother's words, knowing that there was still hope for a reunion.\n\u201cPa!\u201d Phillip Hamilton appeared from what seemed to be nowhere, looking nothing like he had as he died, cold, pale and frightened. Alexander embraced his firstborn son tightly, gazing into those familiar brown eyes that mirrored his own in his youth. \"Why are you here already, Pa? Is everything okay with Mom?\" his expression filled with worry as he peered past his father's shoulder.\n\u201cShe\u2019s fine, Phillip.\u201d He held his son\u2019s shoulder. He shifted, \u201cI-I was in a duel.\u201d\nPhillip Hamilton\u2019s face was a mixture of disbelief and disappointment that Alexander never thought he would want to see on his son's face. \u201cWhy? After my death and what the family went through\u2026..\u201d\nAlexander couldn't bear to meet his son's gaze. \"I understand, I truly do. I realize now that I should have been more careful and had you refuse the duel...and mine. I've disappointed you and our family. My foolish pride led to your death, and I...\"\n\u201cNo, Pa, you didn\u2019t!\u201d Phillip said. \u201cMa, she\u2019s-she strong, she and our family can get through anything.\u201d Now tears were falling from his son\u2019s face even as he tried to smile. \u201cWhen I arrived, Grandmother Rachel met me. She\u2019s been showing me around.\u201d\nRachel elbowed the younger Hamilton. \u201cHere now, I\u2019m not old enough to be called Grandmother!\u201d she laughed, and it was like a remembered melody in his ears.\n\u201cYour Maman has been telling me stories about when you were young.\u201d Phillip grinned.\n\u201cNot the embarrassing ones, surely?\u201d Alexander said with some mock horror.\nRachel burst into laughter, her cheeks turning rosy with warmth as the sound of mirth filled the air.\nDuring a lull in the conversation, Phillip piped up, \u201cOh! You should go find your friends! Mr. Laurens couldn\u2019t stop talking about you!\u201d\nThe idea of not just seeing Laurens, but perhaps even Washington, brought a fresh wave of happiness over him. He nodded, \u201cI\u2019ll see you both later?\u201d\nAs Alexander ventured forward, a tavern materialized from the ethereal mist. As he stepped inside, a lively scene unfolded before his eyes. American and British soldiers mingled together, their laughter and songs filling the air, as if they had momentarily (permanently) escaped the harsh realities of war. Alexander\u2019s eyes widened as he saw Laurens sitting at the bar with a mug of beer, talking voraciously to the soldier next to him. Lauren's eyes went wide at the sight of his friend.\nJohn Laurens hurried over to Alexander's side, embracing him tightly. \"Alex!\" he exclaimed with excitement. \"Just look at you! A distinguished old gentleman now!\"\nAlexander chuckled and playfully rolled his eyes. \"Appreciate that, John!\"\n\u201cHave a drink with me, Alex. You\u2019re here earlier than I expected.\u201d\nHe was about to start to tell his story, when he felt a firm hand on his shoulder, while John\u2019s face took on a reverent look.\n\u201cHello son.\u201d As the familiar deep voice resonated in his ears, he swiftly hopped off the bar stool and stood tall, d to face General-no-President Washington.\n\u201cSir!\u201d Alexander gasped, instantly saluting Washington as though he were back in the army.\nWashington's lips curled into a slight grin. \"No need for formalities anymore, Alexander. Just call me George.\"\n\u201cGeorge, I-\u201d He flubbed, trying to find the right words. What to say? Alexander decided on something that he would not have done when the man was alive as Washing-George abhorred close contact; Alex gave him a hug and was surprised to find that the General returned it.\nWashington clapped a hand on his shoulder, a gesture that was both reassuring and comforting. \"It's good to see you, my boy. I've been following your journey from afar, and I must say, you've done me proud.\"\nAlexander's eyes welled up with tears at the praise from his mentor. \"Thank you, George. None of it would have been possible without your guidance and wisdom.\"\nWashington chuckled, the sound warm and familiar. \"You were always a bright young man, Alexander. And now, here you are, in the company of angels.\"\nGeorge smiled. \"Join us for a drink. There's plenty to discuss.\" Before long, the heartbreaking news of his departure came to light, leading to tears being shed.\nTears quickly transformed into laughter as he initiated a spirited drinking anthem from the Revolutionary era, which he was well acquainted with. It wasn't long before the entire tavern enthusiastically joined in, creating a joyous and lively atmosphere.\nWith his mother and son\u2019s hand in his, the promise of a reunion with Eliza on the horizon, Alexander Hamilton knew that he was finally where he belonged.\nAmid the lively atmosphere of the tavern, he raised his voice and exclaimed, \u201cTo a happy immortality!\u201d The entire crowd erupted in cheers, sharing in his sentiment."

        "story": "Alexander and Eliza eagerly awaited the arrival of the ship carrying the esteemed Marquis de Lafayette at the bustling New York harbor. The news of this French revolutionary hero's visit had stirred up immense excitement, as it seemed the entire city had flocked to the docks to greet him.\nFinally, the ship called the Eagle arrived in the Harbor with much fanfare. There was a roar of cheers as Lafayette appeared at the gangplank, waving and blowing kisses.\nAlexander chuckled, \"He really knows how to steal the spotlight!\"\nAnd you don\u2019t, darling?\u201d Eliza teased.\n\u201cC\u2019est Moi? Never!\u201d He gave her an amused smile.\nLafayette quickly spotted Alexander and Eliza in the midst of the bustling crowd, exchanging greetings with a warm smile. \"My friend!\" he called out, waving enthusiastically. \u00a0The sea of people seemed to part as Lafayette made it to the Hamilton\u2019s side, embracing Alexander with a fierce hug.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, mon ami!\u201d Alexander grinned ear to ear, then gestured to Eliza, \u201cYou remember my wife, Eliza?\u201d\nThere was a twinkle of amusement as he took her hand to kiss, huskily saying. \u201cEnchante encore, Madame Hamilton.\u201d\n\u201cHow was your journey over, Laff?\u201d Alexander asked.\nLafayette's face twisted into a scowl. \"The ocean was incredibly turbulent. I had to stay holed up in my cabin for most of the voyage.\"\n\u201cAh well, you\u2019re a good soldier, just a lousy sailor.\u201d Alexander joshed, patting his shoulder in a mock conciliatory manner. He elbowed his friend. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll tell the porter where to take your bags. You\u2019ll be staying at our house.\u201d\n\u201cMerci, Mon Ami!\u201d Lafayette beamed.\n*~*\n\u201cAh, so here is le petite princess!\u201d Lafayette exclaimed as Eliza took the baby from her maid\u2019s arms and placed them into the Frenchman\u2019s arms. Angelica gurgled as Lafayette gently rocked her with a grin on his face. \u00a0\u201cShe looks like your dear wife, Mon Ami.\u201d\nAt Alexander\u2019s mock pout he amended with a laugh, \u201cThough she has your face, Alexandre.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re very natural at that, Monsieur.\u201d Eliza said with a giggle.\nNow it was Lafayette\u2019s turn to chuckle, \u201cAnd why not? I have three little ones of my own.\u201d\nEliza smiled kindly. \u201cHow is your wife and children, Monsieur Lafayette?\u201d\nLafayette's face softened as he spoke fondly of his family. \"They are all well, merci. My wife is my pillar of strength, and my children bring so much joy to our lives.\"\nEliza nodded, clearly pleased to hear about their well-being. \"I am glad to hear that. Family is such a blessing, isn't it?\"\nLafayette nodded in agreement. \"Indeed, it is. I am truly grateful for my loved ones.\" He cooed at the baby who gurgled happily.\nFrom the back, they heard a door shut loudly and small footfalls on the wood floors. Phillip came in, wearing his nicest dark blue suit that had patches of dirt on it.\n\u201cPhillip Hamilton!\u201d Eliza admonished, \u201cYou were not to get your suit dirty as we were expecting company!\u201d\nThe youngest Hamilton boy just gave him a toothy smile and looked only slightly sorry. \u201cSorry, mamma.\u201d\nAlexander just put a hand on his son\u2019s back and chuckled. \u201cMonsieur Lafayette, this is my son, Phillip.\u201d\nLafayette's eyes twinkled as he looked down at Phillip, his face breaking into a warm smile. \"Ah, a chip off the old block, I see,\" he said teasingly. \"I was causing trouble too when I was your age.\"\nLafayette's easy charm and playful banter put Phillip at ease, and soon the three of them were engaged in lively conversation, sharing stories and jokes as if they had known each other for years. The elder Hamilton looked on with a sense of contentment, happy to see his son forming an easy acquittance with the Frenchmen.\nAlexander smiled at the sweet interactions between the two, before his felt tears well up.\nIf only Laurens were here to share in this....\n*~*\nLater in the night, after the children and Eliza had gone to bed, Lafayette found a light burning from under the door of Alexander\u2019s office. Knocking softly he heard a soft \u201cCome in.\u201d\nAlexander was slouched in his desk chair with a drink in his hand, a bottle half empty on the desk.\n\u201cMon ami? You\u2019re drinking without me?\u201d He said trying to sound amused.\nAlexander gave him a sad smile and gestured to the couch. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d\nHe found another glass and poured some alcohol and handed it to the Marquis.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Lafayette began, twirling the liquid in the glass. \u201cWhy are you down here drinking alone, Mon Ami? Have I done something to make you unhappy?\u201d\nAlexander blurted out a firm \"No!\" before shuffling awkwardly in his chair. He gave his friend a sad look. \u201cI love that you\u2019re here, but\u2026.\u201d He took a sip of his drink. \u201cIt reminds me of our drinking days back in the army. I\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cYou miss Laurens, don\u2019t you?\u201d Lafayette said quietly.\nAlexander nodded, his eyes welling up with tears. \"I miss him every day,\" he admitted. \"I can't believe he's gone. Not-not like this.\" He looked up to Lafayette, holding a hand to his mouth and swipe away the tears. \u201cWhy-why did he have to die, Laff?\u201d he asked hoarsely. \u201cThe war was over. He didn\u2019t have to fight any more...\u201d\n\u201cAlexander,\u201d Lafayette sighed, \u201cJohn fought because he believed in the cause. He wanted to set slaves free and the only way he thought to do so was to fight.\u201d\nAlexander furrowed his brow, still struggling to understand. \"But was it worth it? Was his sacrifice worth it in the end?\"\nLafayette paused, choosing his words carefully. \"John's sacrifice, like all sacrifices made for freedom and justice, may not always seem worthwhile in the moment. But his legacy lives on, Alexander. His bravery and his passion will inspire generations to come. We must honor his memory by continuing the fight for the ideals he believed in.\"\nHe reached out and squeezed Alexander's hand in a gesture of support. \"I understand, my friend. Laurens was a great man, and he will always live on in our memories.\"\nThe two friends sat in silence for a moment, lost in their thoughts and memories of their fallen comrade. Finally, Lafayette spoke up. \"Let's raise a glass to his memory and his legacy.\"\nAlexander managed a small smile through his tears and raised his glass. \"To Laurens,\" he said softly.\n\"To Laurens,\" Lafayette echoed, clinking their glasses together. And in that moment, they found comfort in each other's presence and in their shared grief."

        "writing_prompt": "After a heated political rivalry drove them apart, Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson find themselves united by concern for their mutual friend, James Madison, who lies unconscious after a mysterious accident. Can old wounds heal in the face of shared worry, or will their differences keep them divided?",
        "story": "Thomas had contemplated the idea of sending a note to Congress to tell them he was ill but decided against it. Jemmy was right, The Assumption Bill debate was too important to skip. He didn\u2019t feel much like debating (or rather arguing) with Hamilton today.\nBy the time he arrived at Federal Hall, Hamilton was sitting only a few seats away from his own chair. The Treasury Secretary sat with a pensive and melancholic expression. His head rested in his hand as he gazed into a fixed spot in the corner of the room, lost in his own contemplation.\nThomas coughed lightly, avoiding direct eye contact as he greeted, \"Secretary Hamilton, good morning.\" He settled into his regular chair, purposefully averting his gaze from the vacant seat next to him that belonged to Jemmy.\nHe clasped his hands and furrowed his eyebrows at Hamilton\u2019s distant expression. No doubt the Treasury Secretary had also considered skipping today\u2019s session.\n\u201cSecretary Hamilton?\u201d Jefferson called to Hamilton before sitting.\nAlexander started and glanced over to him slightly surprised. \u201cSecretary Jefferson.\u201d\u00a0 he said politely acknowledging him.\nThe silence was telling as they both couldn\u2019t come to grips with the empty seat between them.\nAlexander folded his hands on his own desk and stared ahead. \u201cH-have you seen Jemmy today?\u201d\nThomas nodded silently, \u201cLast night. He was still unconscious.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026.\u201d Alexander said quietly, looking everywhere but at Thomas.\nNow Thomas furrowed his eyebrows at the Treasury Secretary. \u201cHaven\u2019t you gone to see him?\u201d\nAlexander sadly shook his head, \"Unfortunately, Jemmy...James and I drifted apart as friends a while back, mainly because of our differing views on the South.\"\nThomas looked at Alexander with concern. \u201cBut he\u2019s still your friend, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\nAlexander sighed heavily.\n\u201cHe was, but I fear it may be too late to mend our friendship now. And seeing him in that state, it just brings back memories of what we used to be.\u201d He looked away. \u201cThere were days when he was sick, but he still wanted to work.\u201d\n\u201cThen if you can\u2019t be friends, at least be there for him.\u201d Thomas said, echoing the words Alexander had said to him on that terrible day. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not too late for you to patch up your friendship.\u201d\nAlexander nodded. \u201cYeah. I-I\u2019ll do that. Thanks...Thomas.\u201d\nI\u2019ll come with you to see Jemmy...if you\u2019d like.\u201d Jefferson remarked.\nAlexander looked grateful for the offer and nodded. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate that.\u201d\nHad he really taken advice from Thomas Jefferson?\n*~*\nThey walked together in silence for a while, Thomas' cane tapping on the pavement as they journeyed to the Madison's residence. The sky above was cloudy and reflected the mood of the two men.\nThomas broke the silence by asking, \"How long have you known James?\"\nAlexander nonchalantly shrugged his shoulders, a wistful smile playing on his lips. \"Back in the early days of the republic, we were united by our shared vision at the first Continental Congress. Together, we penned the Federalist Papers along with John Jay. However, when I proposed the Assumption Bill, our paths diverged, and our friendship dissolved.\u201d\nThomas nodded, understanding the weight of their shared history and the complexities that had since pulled them apart. Alexander's words painted a picture of a friendship once strong and unbreakable, now marred by differences in ideology and politics.\nAlexander hesitated as they reached the door of the Madison\u2019s residence. They were greeted by Dolley Madison, who wore a sad smile. \u201cGood day, Mr. Jefferson.\u201d Confusion clouded her expression as she glanced over at Alexander. \"Mr. Hamilton?\"\u00a0 She ushered them into the foyer.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I think Jemmy could do with some company.\u201d\nAs they followed Dolley into the parlor, Alexander couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia. The room was filled with memories of the time spent here with James, debating ideas, and crafting their arguments for the Federalist Papers.\nThomas glanced over to his fellow secretary and cleared his throat. \u201cHamilton, why don\u2019t you go see James first? Go...talk to him, so to speak.\u201d\nAlexander hesitated, then with a kind nod agree quietly. \u201cThank you, Mrs. Madison...Mr. Jefferson.\u201d\nHe glided quietly into the room where James Madison lay in his sickbed. Alexander's mouth was dry, he wondered what to say to his former friend. Would Jemmy even hear him as he was unconscious?\n\u201cHello, James. It\u2019s Alexander.\u201d He sat heavily in the armchair near the bed. Looking to the bedside table, he saw a book and read its spine. It was James' favorite book on Philosophy by John Locke. Alexander\u2019s mouth gaped slightly. Had Jefferson been reading this to James these last two weeks?\nReluctantly, he reached out and gently grasped his friend's wrist, noticing the faint scars left behind by the lightning strike. He took a deep breath and spoke. \u201cJames, you\u2019re not allowed to die, do you hear me? You\u2019re- you were my friend. Politics tore our friendship apart and I regret it every day. Even when you side with Jefferson and taunt me. Just-\u201d his words were shaky now. \u201cYou have to wake up, Jemmy. Your poor wife is worried, Jefferson is worried. I\u2019m...I\u2019m worried. I don\u2019t want to lose you as a colleague and a f-friend. You\u2019re too brilliant to lose.\u201d\nTears welled up in Alexander\u2019s eyes as he poured out his heart to his unconscious friend. He sat there for what seemed like hours, lost in his thoughts and memories of their happier past meetings. Eventually, he gently squeezed James\u2019 hand and stood up, wiping away his tears.\nHis words spent, he picked up the book and flipped through the pages. \u201cShall I read to you?\u201d He took a breath and began to read. \u201c...t\nhus we may conceive how words, which were by nature so well adapted to that purpose, came to be made use of by men, as the signs of their ideas.\n\u201d\n~*~\nFour days had passed since he'd seen Jemmy. He had made a point of going over to see him every day to either talk or read to him. On a sunny day, a sudden, urgent knock echoed through the door. Eliza's brow knitted in confusion, for it was a rare occurrence to have Alexander's undivided attention on his day off. Instead of his usual writing, he found solace in watching their children gleefully playing on the floor.\nGlancing away from the book in his hands, he let out a small sigh before placing it on the table. \"I'll go check who it is, my love. It seems quite urgent.\"\nEliza frowned. \u201cIf it\u2019s a political matter\u2026\u201d she began with a hand on her hip.\nAlexander raised a hand as if to shoo away the worry as he went to the door. Opening it, he found Thomas Jefferson, standing on the stoop, who looked in unusual disarray. His hair was even wilder than normal, and the Virginian\u2019s eyes were puffy and bloodshot. Yet, as he glanced at Alexander, a smile spread across his face.\u00a0 \u201cAlexander, it\u2019s Jemmy. He\u2019s awake.\u201d\nAlexander's heart skipped a beat as his eyes widened. \"He's awake? Jemmy's alive?\" He hesitated for a moment, resisting the urge to embrace his rival.\u00a0 He called over his shoulder, \u201cEliza!\u201d Then he returned his attention to the Secretary of State. \u201cHow is he? I mean, is he-?\u201d\nThomas\u2019 shoulders rose. \u201cHe seems fine? The lightning doesn\u2019t seem to have had any permanent effects.\u00a0 The doctors are baffled. He\u2019s still going to need some time to recover though.\u201d\nInstantly, Eliza appeared with a puzzled expression. \u2018What is it Alexander? Why on earth are you yelling so?\u201d\nHe turned and took her shoulders. \u201cJemmy\u2019s awake, Eliza! He pulled through!\u201d He exclaimed, kissing her on the cheek. \u201cHoney, I should go see him. I\u2019ll be home later, alright?\u201d\nEliza\u2019s face was one of love. \u201cOf course, sweetheart. Please give my best wishes to Dolley and wish Mr. Madison a speedy recovery for me?\u201d She pecked him on the cheek.\nAlexander gave a firm nod and swiftly exited the house, brimming with anticipation to mend his friendship and extend his unwavering support while Jemmy was on the mend.\nTHE END"
