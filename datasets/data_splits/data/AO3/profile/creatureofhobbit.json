        "writing_prompt": "A boy trapped decades in the past uses his drawings to preserve memories of the family and life he left behind, even as the lines between holding on and letting go blur with each passing day.",
        "story": "For Mikkel, drawing was his way of keeping his memories alive.\nInes didn\u2019t like it if he ever talked about the life he\u2019d left behind in 2019, with Ulrich and Katharina, Magnus and Martha, and a part of him understood why, but at the same time, Mikkel didn\u2019t want to lose those memories of his original family. So he\u2019d draw variations on the themes of those he used to draw as a younger child which Katharina had kept on the fridge door for ages, a family group, Ulrich and Katharina, Magnus, Martha and Mikkel. He just didn\u2019t show them to Ines; he\u2019d show her pictures like ones he\u2019d drawn of her, the one he\u2019d drawn of Hannah Kruger when they first got together, or the one of Sloth from the Goonies (since Ines had never watched that, she wasn\u2019t familiar with the character, but still found it a relief that Mikkel was drawing a fictional character rather than anything to do with his original family).\nHe did show Ines a picture he\u2019d drawn of Harry Houdini, although she thought that was for some school project; although he didn\u2019t talk about him in this house, Mikkel still chose to maintain that interest as a way of holding on to another tie to his life with the Nielsen family. For a long time, he\u2019d looked at his bedroom wall when he\u2019d woken up, expecting to see his The Great Mikkel Houdini picture on there, then the truth would slowly dawn on him once more.\nHe\u2019d drawn one of a youth wearing a yellow raincoat, although the youth\u2019s face was obscured; this was Mikkel\u2019s way of dealing with his feelings towards Jonas, once his favourite of his siblings\u2019 friends who was always there for an ultimate fist bump, now the person who had led him through the caves back in time to 1986. No matter how he tried, Mikkel could never understand why Jonas would have led him away from his life; sometimes he thought it must have been some kind of accident and Jonas had had no idea what was going to happen, other times he was convinced Jonas had done it deliberately for some reason Mikkel would never understand. Eventually, in a moment of anger, Mikkel had ripped that drawing up into pieces.\nSometimes he\u2019d drawn the caves, still thinking that one day he would try and go back through them and see if he could find his way back to 2019 that way, yet he\u2019d stopped planning on that after variations on the theme of a recurring nightmare where he\u2019d go back into the caves only to come face to face with a velociraptor and realise he\u2019d gone back to prehistoric times, or keep wandering through the caves and never arriving anywhere at all, or whichever way he went, he would always end up stuck in 1986. Then had come the day when Ulrich had turned up at his house. For that one moment, when his father had returned to him, Mikkel had allowed himself to believe that the nightmare was over, that he could finally return to the life where he was Mikkel Nielsen and not Michael Kahnwald, to his friends, to his mother, only for Ulrich to be taken away from him, back to that ward once more, and Mikkel was returned to the life he\u2019d spent months desperate to escape.\nAfter that, Mikkel had given up hope, kept up the hobby but found it easier to draw anything that didn\u2019t relate to his past life; the chalet Ines had taken him to for a holiday, more movie characters, animals, Hannah. Until the day came when he heard the announcement of his own birth, became more and more aware of his younger self\u2019s existence as Hannah and Jonas were close to the Nielsens, knew that November 2019 was drawing ever closer, and found himself drawing the caves once more."

        "story": "Hannah had noticed Michael was distracted, of course, yet how could he explain that it was coming up to the time of his own birth in the original timeline? Jonas had even made a comment about it when Martha had told him that the new baby her mother was expecting was due around that time, said something like wouldn\u2019t it be funny if the new baby was born on Michael\u2019s birthday. (He\u2019d kept celebrating his original birthday when he first arrived in the 1980s; he\u2019d wanted to hold onto at least one thing from his life before, and that had been the easiest thing to keep. He\u2019d spent so long answering to a name that was not his own, not turning round when someone called out Michael because he still kept expecting to hear Mikkel, and living in a house that was not the one he still thought of as home, was celebrating his birthday on the correct day too much to ask?)\nHe could still remember a time in his past, in Jonas\u2019s future, when Jonas had come over on Mikkel\u2019s birthday with a little present for him. Magnus had asked Jonas how he even remembered Mikkel\u2019s birthday, and Jonas had shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s the same day as my dad\u2019s.\u201d Young Mikkel, at the time, could have had no way of knowing the significance of that; he\u2019d just thought it was cool that he shared a birthday with Jonas\u2019s father, although he didn\u2019t really know the guy. Hannah Kahnwald was over at their house quite a lot, but he didn\u2019t usually go with her. Today, Michael understood why that was; it had been easier for him to avoid spending time with the Nielsens, knowing he could never truly be part of their family again, always worried about the possibility of letting slip something that hadn\u2019t happened yet, or something that Michael Kahnwald shouldn\u2019t have known about.\nMichael had known what Hannah was going to say as soon as she\u2019d walked in, gesturing at him with her phone: \u201cUlrich just texted, Katharina\u2019s had the baby. It\u2019s a boy, and they\u2019re going to call him Mikkel.\u201d Jonas had cheered, said something about how he\u2019d told Martha it was going to be today. As Jonas started asking when they could go over and see the baby, and Hannah was trying to explain that Ulrich and Katharina probably weren\u2019t ready for visitors that day but as soon as they were, they\u2019d call her and she\u2019d take him over, Michael felt like he\u2019d been punched in the stomach. He\u2019d known for ages that this day was coming, but until now he\u2019d put off dealing with thinking about the day when his two timelines were going to collide.\nHe'd thought about making an excuse when Ulrich and Katharina called inviting the Kahnwalds over to meet the new baby, but had quickly realised he couldn\u2019t \u2013 even if he\u2019d come up with a convincing story for Hannah and cried off on that specific day, they were going to keep asking, and Winden was a small town, Hannah was friends with the Nielsens, Jonas was friends with Magnus and Martha, they had mutual friends. One way or the other, Michael was going to meet Mikkel.\nHannah could sense something wasn\u2019t right, kept asking Michael if he was okay as they made their way over, Jonas clutching the teddy bear they had bought (Michael remembered that teddy, still had it in his cupboard in 2019, he just hadn\u2019t remembered before now who\u2019d given him that one as he\u2019d had so many toys at the time). A part of him was tempted when she said that if he wasn\u2019t feeling well, maybe he should go back home, but he knew he shouldn\u2019t take up the offer; he had to get this over with one way or the other.\nUlrich greeted them at the door, ushered them in to where Katharina, looking tired, was holding baby Mikkel; Martha took the teddy bear from Jonas while Magnus made a comment about how he wished they\u2019d take the baby away with them because his crying had been keeping him awake. As Ulrich launched into a story about how his car had a flat battery and Peter Doppler had to give him a jump start before he could actually get Katharina to the hospital, Michael thought about how he had heard all these stories so many times before, never knowing that one day he would be witnessing all of this himself. For one moment he wondered if there was anything he could do to change things, to warn Ulrich and Katharina of what was about to happen in 2019, to keep the family together, but he knew that he wouldn\u2019t be believed, that if he said anything he\u2019d most likely just end up on the same ward where Ulrich would spend the last thirty years of his life. Michael had thought so much about that over the years, the time Ulrich had come back for him and they had been so close to getting back to their own time before they were captured, Michael returned to Ines, Ulrich to the ward, and wondered whether he could have done anything differently then, too, so that they would have been able to escape.\n\u201cWould you like to hold him?\u201d Katharina asked. Michael took a step back, flinching; Hannah saw this but misinterpreted, told them how it had taken Michael a few weeks before he\u2019d dared to hold Jonas without worrying he was going to drop him. How could Michael explain that he didn\u2019t know what would happen if he was to hold his younger self? While he thought most likely nothing would happen, that he would just hold himself for a few minutes and then pass himself back to Katharina or Ulrich, he couldn\u2019t help but remember something from some comic book where some character\u2019s encounter with their younger self had caused some kind of implosion.\nKatharina was looking at him oddly; realising there was nothing else for it, Michael reached out and took the baby from her. As he looked down at his sleeping younger self for the first time, nothing happened, baby Mikkel slept on, and Michael felt momentarily foolish for having expected anything else. He\u2019d got this hurdle out of the way, but Michael knew that a new struggle was only just beginning."

How can he ever know which world is the truth, and which is just a dream he\u2019s afraid to leave?",
        "story": "Even as Michael laughs with Hannah in the kitchen, teases Rex about being late for school again, a part of him doesn\u2019t dare fully relax into this moment he\u2019d thought he would never experience again. He heads into work, things seem to be going well there; Bird\u2019s back, cracking his usual jokes, no longer dead at the hands of his new partner Ed Hawkins, and he\u2019s in talks about a promotion into Captain Harper\u2019s job, acting captain in the interim but they\u2019re hoping it\u2019ll be permanent. Meanwhile, in this universe, Efrem Vega has his promotion to detective again and Michael\u2019s partnered with him once more; for all Michael had been dubious about him when they were first paired in Hannah\u2019s World, they had become friends, found they worked well together, so Michael\u2019s happy to still have Vega as his partner while getting to work closely with Bird.\nThen he heads home, hangs out in the kitchen with Rex listening to his story about something Cole had done in school earlier that day, and yet even as Rex is telling the story, Michael\u2019s only half listening because the other half of him can\u2019t stop thinking about how lucky he is to be able to have this conversation with Rex at all, knowing that in just a few minutes Hannah\u2019s going to walk through the door and he\u2019ll be able to talk with them both in a way that he had previously taken for granted.\nWhen Hannah and Rex go to bed, Michael remains in the kitchen, brewing himself some extra-strong coffee; Hannah makes some joke about how he\u2019s never going to be able to sleep that night. Michael can\u2019t bring himself to tell her that that\u2019s the whole point, that he\u2019s scared that if he goes to sleep, he\u2019ll find himself in the same nightmare again, where one of them, his wife or his son, is lost to him one day, then the next day he\u2019ll wake up and find the other one gone.\nAs he sits there watching some stupid reality TV show repeat that he usually wouldn\u2019t watch in a million years but is choosing to sit through anything, any old garbage that will keep him awake, he tries to tell himself that maybe there would be a way it wouldn\u2019t happen, that he could keep going to sleep and waking up in this world, with both Hannah and Rex. Hannah\u2019s there right now, waiting for him to come up to bed, yet Michael remains in the kitchen, not daring to close his eyes in case he wakes up in that prison cell again, trapped with no one believing his story about what really happened the night of the accident, Rex dead, Bird dead, Harper free and still in her position as captain. Or maybe he\u2019ll wake up in Rex\u2019s world, with Bird still alive, Harper in custody; in this world Michael will be free, yet knowing that if he stays in that world, he will never see Hannah again.\nThat time he\u2019d got stuck in Hannah\u2019s world after his encounter with Ed, he\u2019d come to believe that Hannah\u2019s world was the real one; as he\u2019d made the decision to turn his back on the version of him in the cells, he\u2019d come to the conclusion that Rex\u2019s world was the real one; Michael wants to believe that this world he\u2019s in now, where both his wife and his son survived the accident, is the real one, the one he\u2019s going to stay in. Dr. Lee would probably tell him right about now that he\u2019d constructed this one himself because he couldn\u2019t let go of either Hannah or Rex; and a part of Michael wonders if he\u2019s right, so he\u2019s determined to resist sleep, in case he finds himself trapped in one of the other worlds, unable to return to this one."

        "writing_prompt": "In a world where genetic perfection once defined worth, Elena, created from the DNA of a long-dead actress, now helps others navigate a society that values individuality over flawlessness. How do you rebuild an identity when the very thing you were designed to be no longer matters?",
        "story": "The former beauty contestants Elena\u2019s helping as part of her foundation are all finding it hard to adjust to the fact that their looks, their perfect health with all diseases eradicated, no longer hold the same value they did under the old Genetically Enhanced Men regime. Elena understands this; before she had got to know Mina, she had been just the same as them, or at least thought she was, and it had taken time for her to adjust too, and even longer for her to understand that she could help them.\nIt seemed strange sometimes for Elena to think of how she\u2019d believed, back when she was in primary school, that she was even more perfect than the rest of her GEM classmates because her parents had chosen to create her from the genes of that long since dead actress Angelina, rather than using any of their own genes, and even stranger now for her to think that at the time, she\u2019d thought it mattered. Sometimes Elena thought it was a good thing that she didn\u2019t share any genes with these people who didn\u2019t understand her and had made no attempt to even try; it had made it easier for her to pretend growing up that Clare, the nanny who had been the real mother figure in her life, was her actual mother. Other times, she\u2019s wondered why her parents had thought it even mattered that she had this actress\u2019s genes, why Elena\u2019s having the perfect appearance had mattered more to them than her actually being a part of them. Sometimes, she\u2019s wondered if she would have had a closer relationship with her parents if she had shared their genetic material.\nIt\u2019s something she\u2019s talked about with Sebastian sometimes; Sebastian did share genetic material with his parents, had still felt enough of a bond with his father to respond to the bogus summons that his father had sent via Mina\u2019s uncle Matthew, yet in the light of his father\u2019s actions, Sebastian has admitted that he\u2019s sometimes wished that he didn\u2019t share genes with his parents. All of them, Mina, Ginge, Angela and Cam, Daniel and Elena herself, have told Sebastian that they don\u2019t hold him responsible for anything that happened with his father, that they see him as a totally different person, that it\u2019s Sebastian\u2019s choices, not his genes, that make him who he is. Sebastian\u2019s coming to accept that, and Cam especially has been a help to him as he\u2019s had the same struggle with his own father; as he and Ginge are helping with the rehabilitation of Margaret Murgatroyd\u2019s army of clones into society, he\u2019s imparting the same message to them. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he\u2019d said to Elena, \u201cI even believe it.\u201d He\u2019d been partly joking, but Elena knew that there was some truth in it, that doubts still sometimes crept in even as Ginge and their other friends worked hard on convincing him.\nShe\u2019s talked about it to some extent with Mina, too \u2013 Mina, whose mother had experimented on her genes in a different way, given her the abilities that had made her see herself as a freak for years. Elena had had it drummed into her for so many years that the likes of Mina and Angela were blemished, flawed, yet as she spent some time with Mina, she came to the conclusion that the more unique features of the so-called Blemished were actually more interesting than her own so much prized for being those of the actress. Anna Hart had intended for Mina to become the perfect weapon; it may have gone in a way that she had never imagined but Mina\u2019s power had helped them win the fight against the Ministry, yet Elena knew a part of Mina was always going to struggle with the knowledge that her powers had ultimately killed her father. From what Elena understood, Mina had never quite got to the point of wishing not to be related to her mother, Anna\u2019s sacrifice of her life for Mina\u2019s at the end having gone some way towards Mina making her peace with her, but Mina was still able to understand where Elena was coming from.\nAs for the friends she\u2019d had back in Area 14 before the GEM regime was overthrown\u2026they\u2019re trying to adjust to the new regime, although after everything that Elena\u2019s been through, she feels like she has nothing in common with them any more. It makes her sad to think of all her shared history with Clarissa, how they\u2019d only just reconciled after their big fight right before the Miss Area 14 contest and now Elena felt like she and Clarissa had moved apart again. Clarissa could never understand all the things Elena had seen during her time in London with the resistance, how Jake had shown her (just as she had been starting to understand from Mina) that there was a whole new world beyond the Ministry, beyond the world of Genetically Enhanced Men, of beauty contests and reality TV. To her old friends, all that stuff that feels so superficial to Elena now still matters. They still meet up; Elena doesn\u2019t want to let go of all those years of friendship, she\u2019ll still try and keep it going for as long as she can, but when they see each other, it\u2019s awkward and they don\u2019t have a lot to say to each other now. It\u2019s easier for Elena to be around people like Mina and Sebastian, people who have experienced the war, people she finds it easier to relate to now.\nPerfection no longer matters in the new society forming under Mary\u2019s rule; other values are what matter now, differences are prized and valued. It\u2019s not \u201cperfect\u201d, but it\u2019s as good as it\u2019s ever likely to get, and that\u2019s good enough for Elena."

Caroline said Lisette\u2019s had a sale on this weekend. I could be getting my blisters in a much more productive way.\u201d\n\u201cWasn\u2019t it yours, Jess?\u201d Amy asked innocently. \u201cI seem to remember you were the one who suggested we all go when you found out Michael was really into this nature stuff,\u201d gesturing towards the new guy in their class, Jessica\u2019s latest crush who was just ahead of them chatting with Winston and Todd.\nLila, meanwhile, glanced at Jessica\u2019s strappy sandals. \u201cMaybe you wouldn\u2019t have had the blisters if you were wearing some more suitable footwear,\u201d she smirked. \u201cDidn\u2019t Liz offer to let you borrow a pair of her walking boots?\u201d Glancing at Lila\u2019s trainers which had clearly only been bought within the last couple of days and not broken in yet, Jessica suspected that Lila was struggling just as much with blisters as she was, but didn\u2019t say anything.\n\u201cShe\u2019s right, Jess,\u201d Elizabeth cheerfully said as she and Enid walked past them, trying to catch up with Todd. \u201cI did tell you those sandals weren\u2019t suitable footwear.\u201d\n\u201cAnd seriously, is no one else getting as bitten by these mosquitoes?\u201d Ignoring her sister, Jessica slapped at her leg, trying not to think of the bites that would be visible on her leg very shortly, and grimaced at the muddy streaks she\u2019d just noticed on her feet. It had seemed so simple at the time, signing them all up for this hike as soon as she\u2019d found out Michael was organising it. Lila and Amy had complained about it when they first found out, although Lila had eventually come round to the idea and Amy had caved after that. However, Jessica was now starting to wish she\u2019d listened to Lila and Amy\u2019s earlier objections, or at least to Elizabeth\u2019s advice about what to wear. She hadn\u2019t given much thought to\u2026mud, mosquitoes, grass, narrow paths, getting hot and sweaty. But at least it wasn\u2019t raining like it had all day yesterday.\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna go\u2026catch up with Winston,\u201d Lila said. \u201cI want to ask him a question about\u2026our history assignment.\u201d She ran off up the path towards him before Jessica had chance to respond.\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Jessica said to Amy. \u201cI have history with Winston. Lila isn\u2019t even in that class. What\u2019s she talking about?\u201d As Jessica watched, Lila caught up with the guys who had now been joined by Elizabeth and Enid, pushed herself right between Winston and Michael, elbowing Winston out of his own conversation.\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why she changed her mind,\u201d Jessica hissed at Amy as Lila stumbled in what was completely obviously an attempt to make Michael think she\u2019d injured herself so he\u2019d help her along, even carry her if he thought it was that bad. Actually, in other circumstances Jessica would have had to hand it to her, and she\u2019d certainly used that one herself in the past with (ugh) Jeremy Randall. Possibly even where Lila had got the idea. But right now, when Lila was throwing herself at the guy Jessica wanted to be with herself, despite being meant to be her best friend, Jessica couldn\u2019t wait for them to get to their intended destination of the lake so she could push Lila right in it.\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think it exactly worked out for her,\u201d Amy pointed at where Lila, having misjudged where to fall, had landed in a puddle, getting completely covered in mud, and had leapt up so fast to get out of the mud that it was completely obvious to Michael, and everyone else watching, that she wasn\u2019t injured at all.\nSuddenly, Jessica was feeling a lot better."

Jackie wasn\u2019t here; Jackie didn\u2019t get to dictate Shauna\u2019s choices any more.\nBack in middle school, and at the start of freshman year, Jackie had had a crush on a different guy every week, getting over them as quickly as they\u2019d started, and as Shauna had walked home from Jackie\u2019s before Jeff arrived, she hadn\u2019t really thought that this time would be any different. A couple of dates maybe, and then Jackie would be talking about someone else. But instead, they\u2019d carried on dating, become the couple that everyone would have expected to become prom king and queen, if Jackie had lived to make it to prom.\nSometimes, there had been times when Jeff had picked Jackie up from Shauna\u2019s for their dates instead of her own place; Shauna wondered whether, as he walked up her drive to collect her tonight, he\u2019d be thinking of those days, if he\u2019d have that moment of expecting Jackie to be the one to open the door and she\u2019d then see the flash of disappointment in his eyes when he realised Shauna and not Jackie was waiting at the door. She\u2019d admitted as much to Taissa and Van the day before; Taissa had said that she shouldn\u2019t think like that, that Jeff had chosen to date her because he wanted to date her. As Shauna opened the door to Jeff, she saw the look on his face as he took her in, knew that she\u2019d made the right choice of outfit, and thought maybe the night was going to be okay.\n\u201cHe took me somewhere fancier,\u201d Jackie\u2019s voice whispered in Shauna\u2019s ear as they walked into the Italian restaurant. \u201cDo you remember? He took me to that very expensive French place.\u201d\nYes, Shauna did remember, and yes, it had been one of the factors in why Shauna had chosen the Italian instead, because it was somewhere that held no associations with Jeff\u2019s relationship with Jackie. But as they walked in, as people turned round to stare at them as if to ask what she was doing there with her best friend\u2019s former boyfriend (there had been enough news coverage at the time, including interviews with Jeff that he said were just made up because his father had told the press where to go and they never really spoke to him, that everyone pretty much knew Jeff as Jackie\u2019s boyfriend at that point), Shauna found herself thinking that maybe it would have been a better idea to have gone somewhere outside of Wiskayok, somewhere that people wouldn\u2019t know them.\n\u201cWant me to say something?\u201d Jeff asked as he saw some couple staring at them taking their seats; Shauna shook her head. \u201cLet\u2019s just leave it, they\u2019re not worth it.\u201d In her mind\u2019s eye, she saw Jackie grinning at the couple, saying \u201cTake a picture, it\u2019ll last longer.\u201d\nShe\u2019d imagined this so many times, what she would say to Jeff when she saw him again, how she\u2019d explain to him about Jackie, where she would even start the whole conversation about the baby (that still hadn\u2019t happened; she\u2019d thought she was going to bring that up when she first got home, but their first meeting had been awkward enough that she didn\u2019t think it was the moment.) It was stupid, they\u2019d never had any trouble thinking of things to say to each other before, why was Shauna finding it so hard now? She should just bite the bullet and blurt out something, nothing either of them could say could be that bad, right?\n\u201cSo, I met up with Jackie\u2019s family yesterday,\u201d Jeff began.\nOkay, maybe Shauna was wrong.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell them we were coming here tonight,\u201d Jeff continued, and Shauna thought that was probably the best thing; she wasn\u2019t ready for that conversation with Jackie\u2019s family, especially if this ended up being their first and last date, so she just mumbled something about how it had been a while since she\u2019d talked to them and should really make the effort.\n\u201cThey miss you, Shipman,\u201d Jackie\u2019s voice sounded in her ear again. \u201cRemember when you were round there practically every day?\u201d\nIt was a relief when the waiter came to take their order, Shauna quickly ordered her pasta, then started asking Jeff about the furniture store he was working at. Jeff started telling her a story about a particularly difficult guy he\u2019d had to deal with the day before, and as Shauna laughed at the story, she started thinking that maybe she\u2019d been worrying about nothing, that the night was going to go well after all.\nUntil their orders arrived. And it wasn\u2019t what Shauna had ordered. In a twist of fate, the chicken dish they\u2019d brought over was exactly what Jackie would have ordered.\nThe waiter was very apologetic, said the order was for another table and he hadn\u2019t realised the mistake because one of those diners had given the same order as Jeff, and Shauna didn\u2019t want to make a big deal of it; he couldn\u2019t have known that he\u2019d just served her Jackie\u2019s favourite. But Shauna found herself getting angry at him, demanding another pasta free of charge.\n\u201cShauna, I think that really was an accident,\u201d Jeff began, but Shauna snapped \u201cJackie\u2019s favourite food, the kind of date you\u2019d go on with Jackie, everyone\u2019s staring at us wondering what you\u2019re doing with me instead of Jackie. Maybe this whole thing was a big mistake.\u201d\nThey ate their meal in silence, paid up and left; Shauna could tell that Jeff wasn\u2019t really sure what to say next. She started thinking about the time they\u2019d spent together before; while \u201cbunk ups on the back seat of Jeff\u2019s car after Jackie had been dropped off at home\u201d wasn\u2019t exactly an ideal date, it was all they had known before, and she did want something different from that.\n\u201cWhat I should really have done,\u201d Shauna began, \u201cis suggested that we do something just for us, whether that\u2019s hanging out at your place watching crap television, or just getting the hell out of Wiskayok for the night. But not the same kind of dates you used to go on with Jackie. Something spontaneous.\u201d\n\u201cThat works for me,\u201d Jeff seemed relieved that Shauna had calmed down and wasn\u2019t yelling any more. \u201cNext week, we can try something again. I\u2019ll surprise you. But it won\u2019t be a formal date like this one.\u201d\nAs they got into Jeff\u2019s car, Shauna thought about the awkward conversations she still had to have with Jeff, but knew tonight wasn\u2019t the night to bring those subjects up. She should have known better after everything that happened with Jackie; the night would have gone so much better had she just been honest with herself and Jeff."

How do you hold it all together when the person you fear most is yourself?",
        "story": "This was where Taissa had wanted to be. She should be happy right now. She\u2019s senator, for fuck\u2019s sake, she\u2019s freaking senator, she beat that asshole Bathurst. It was what she had wanted ever since she was in elementary school, watching her parents swearing at Reagan every time he was on the news. She\u2019d had the whole life plan, and as she\u2019d been discussing with Shauna, she\u2019d more or less kept to it. She\u2019d got the degree she had always planned to achieve, she\u2019d started the political career, she and Simone had married after getting together in their third year of college, and Sammy had completed their family. She had the life she had always intended to have.\nAnd yet right now Taissa felt like she hadn\u2019t won anything at all; her marriage to Simone was hanging by a thread, and Taissa wasn\u2019t even sure at this point whether she even wanted to fix it, would have been considering it at all if she didn\u2019t have Sammy. Even if Taissa did decide to go back and try and fix the marriage, she didn\u2019t know whether Simone would be open to the idea once she was out of hospital or whether she\u2019d decide to walk away. Simone had been saying throughout the campaign that Taissa was prioritising her career over her family; Taissa was now admitting to herself that if she\u2019d really still been in love with Simone, she might have made more effort to put their marriage before her campaign. Something she\u2019s also been asking herself, but hasn\u2019t admitted out loud to anyone as yet, is whether Simone still loved Taissa either; Simone had threatened to go to the press if Taissa didn\u2019t step down as senator and get help. Was going to the press really the action of someone who wanted to make their marriage work?\nAnd it was starting to feel as though it may have all been for nothing anyway. Taissa had gone to the count fully expecting that she wouldn\u2019t have won, she had her concession speech all prepared, and had been trying to tell herself that maybe it would all be for the best anyway, because it would give her the opportunity to fix things with her family. Of course, at that point, she hadn\u2019t yet discovered the shrine in the basement, had no idea that Other Tai was back.\nIt seemed strange to Taissa now that she\u2019d actually worried about other people\u2019s perceptions of what had happened out there in the wilderness, making smart remarks about cannibalism like Bathurst or that kid who\u2019d said it to Sammy, or Diane fishing for information at that dinner. Now that Taissa knows that Jeff was the blackmailer, she doesn\u2019t fear anything about that time being made public; after the experience he\u2019d had after the crash when the press were hounding him for information and then made up stupid shit when he wouldn\u2019t engage, Jeff was hardly likely to go to the media, and besides, he was never really going to do that to Shauna. It was Other Tai that Taissa feared now, never knowing when the other one was going to appear, fearing that she may appear when Taissa was making some public appearance as senator, fearing even more that she may come to the surface when Taissa was alone with Sammy.\nVan was who Taissa needed right now; Van, who had tried offering Taissa real options for help rather than threats about the press, Van, who had slept tied to Taissa every night to keep her safe, Van, with whose help the other Taissa had seemingly disappeared years ago. Now just when Taissa thought there might be another chance for them, here Van was telling her she\u2019d been diagnosed with cancer, that she had months to live. And while Lottie had seemed to be implying that the wilderness was pleased with them, would give them something in return, Taissa had always been less convinced by all that stuff than Van and the others. She found herself facing a future where she would lose Van, just as they had found each other again.\nTaissa had, on paper, achieved everything she\u2019d ever wanted, yet it felt to her as though she was back where she had started."

        "writing_prompt": "After stepping away from the throne and choosing love over duty, a young former Crown Prince faces an uncertain future\u2014what does life look like when the path ahead is no longer set in stone?",
        "story": "It\u2019s the first time in a long time that Wilhelm has no clue what\u2019s around the corner for him. For most of his life, he\u2019d expected to be a working royal, technically Erik\u2019s heir until such time as Erik had children of his own, so unlikely to ever have to actually take the throne. Then when Erik died, Wilhelm had known that his destiny lay somewhere else entirely, that he was to take the throne in Erik\u2019s place. Now he\u2019s made the choice to be honest with his family, to say that he doesn\u2019t want to be Crown Prince any more, that he\u2019s chosen Simon, he no longer knows what lies in store.\nHe doesn\u2019t know where he\u2019s going to be going to school for the next academic year; while he knows that Hillerska\u2019s closure is being appealed, he\u2019s not sure how successful that\u2019s going to be. Yes, everyone involved in the initiation will have gone, yes, the school will be under new management, but will that be enough for the appeal to be successful? Wilhelm knows that if the attempt to appeal the closure does fail, his parents could always choose to send him back to his old school from before he started Hillerska, or find somewhere else altogether, but he\u2019s not sure whether he would want that now, to be at a school without Simon, Felice and Sara.\nAugust\u2019s called, thanking Wilhelm for speaking to his parents about making him the heir to the Swedish throne. Wilhelm\u2019s not sure how their relationship will be in the future; although they are family, until recently they had never been friends, and there\u2019s still enough water under the bridge that he\u2019s not sure how easy it will be for them ever to really be close. At one point, he hadn\u2019t thought he could forgive August for the sex tape, and more recently August\u2019s shattering of Wilhelm\u2019s illusions about Erik by revealing Erik\u2019s role in the initiation had driven a wedge between them; yet a part of Wilhelm actually thinks he wouldn\u2019t mind now talking about Erik with August, since August had reassured Wilhelm that Erik would have loved him. They\u2019ll still see each other again as cousins; after all this time of disliking August, Wilhelm considers the idea that they could become something closer to friends.\nWilhelm\u2019s never thought about the idea of a career. Why would he? Until now, he\u2019d never expected to have any choice in the matter; whether as Crown Prince or another working royal, heir to Erik, the choice had already been set in stone for Wilhelm. For Simon and Sara and Felice, Rosh and Ayub, even August\u2019s friends, futures not fixed in the same way, they had always expected to have some kind of career; Wilhelm knew Simon had wanted a career in music, although he had never been sure that it would actually happen. If he\u2019s honest with himself, he has to admit that he\u2019ll never truly leave the public eye; even though he has taken the step back from the throne, he\u2019s still well enough known that he\u2019ll always be recognised as a member of the royal family, never able to blend into the background and live a truly normal life in the way that his friends can. Will anyone even take him seriously when he does apply for a job, or will they decide that the downsides of the media attention outweigh the benefits of hiring him, or think he\u2019s just playing at being a regular person before going back to the Bank of Mama and Papa, back to the royal family? They would have no worries on that score; Wilhelm knows he doesn\u2019t want to go back to that life, was never really happy even as he went through the motions of the public appearances. And once the news is officially out there that he has abdicated as Crown Prince, Wilhelm knows that in the short term at least, he\u2019ll be getting lots of media attention as Sweden processes the news (he\u2019s already thought that he\u2019d better suggest to Simon that he avoids looking at social media for at least the first few weeks, to avoid the comments from idiots.) Although August did say when they spoke that hopefully, as new Crown Prince, he\u2019ll be able to turn at least some of the media focus to himself, take it off Wilhelm and Simon.\nBut a lot of this is either out of his hands anyway (the future of the school), or things that Wilhelm can take time to make a decision about rather than having to commit to anything straight away (any future career); Wilhelm doesn\u2019t know what the future holds for him, but maybe right now he doesn\u2019t need to. He can enjoy this summer with his friends, with Simon."

        "story": "Mikkel had never seen it himself, because his parents\u2019 VCR had given up the ghost not that long after he was born and they never bothered replacing it, but when it was coming up to Ulrich and Katharina\u2019s wedding anniversary party, his parents got out the wedding photos, and Magnus and Martha talked about the times when they\u2019d been made to watch the wedding video. At least, made to watch it was the way Magnus had put it; Martha had admitted that at the time, she\u2019d enjoyed seeing her mother\u2019s wedding dress and Hannah Kahnwald\u2019s bridesmaid\u2019s dress.\n\u201cRemember how we used to laugh at Aleksander Tiedemann\u2019s hair in the video?\u201d Martha giggled, elbowing Magnus and turning to a picture of Ulrich with Aleksander and Peter Doppler.\n\u201cHey, Aleksander\u2019s hair was very much in the fashion for the time,\u201d Ulrich had laughed, gesturing towards the picture of himself. \u201cIt was certainly no worse than any of ours.\u201d\n\u201cGrandmamma Albers doesn\u2019t look very happy,\u201d Mikkel said as he turned over the page. He couldn\u2019t remember Helene Albers very well; his grandmother had died two years earlier, and Mikkel hadn\u2019t spent a lot of time with her before that apart from Christmas Day sometimes when he had to. He was okay with that, though; he mostly remembered her as scary, disapproving of everything, and he felt a lot more comfortable with Grandmamma Nielsen, even if she did sometimes start crying and talking about how he reminded her of Papa\u2019s brother Mads.\n\u201cYour Grandmamma Albers never liked me,\u201d Ulrich explained, \u201cand she didn\u2019t think that your mother and I should be getting married. That\u2019s why she looks miserable.\u201d\n\u201cWasn\u2019t that her usual expression?\u201d Magnus asked. Ulrich shushed him, but with a wink that said he agreed.\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve confirmed everything with the food and drink, Charlotte\u2019s bringing a few bits, Hannah says she\u2019s got some plates and glasses for us, you kids just have to make sure you\u2019ve tidied up and helped with the decorations before you even think about going to the lake with Jonas and Bartosz tomorrow,\u201d Katharina said as she walked in. Martha immediately leaped up from her seat and started carrying some stuff upstairs; Mikkel giggled and said to Ulrich \u201cMartha doesn\u2019t want to miss out on spending time with Jonas.\u201d\nUlrich laughed, asking Magnus if he planned on inviting Franziska Doppler to join them. Magnus was saved from answering by Martha walking back in and saying that Bartosz was really disappointed that he wouldn\u2019t be able to make the party, since his parents\u2019 celebratory dinner for the hotel opening was the same night.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d Katharina replied. \u201cBartosz would have been more than welcome.\u201d Mikkel picked up on the emphasis on Bartosz\u2019s name, and wondered why, despite them being in the wedding photos, his parents weren\u2019t really friends with Bartosz\u2019s parents like they were with Jonas\u2019s, and Franziska and Elisabeth\u2019s, but decided that wasn\u2019t the moment to ask.\n\u201cIs the 80s playlist ready?\u201d Katharina asked.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing good with it,\u201d Martha replied. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to replicate the songs from your wedding reception, so we have Heaven Is A Place On Earth, Never Gonna Give You Up, 99 Red Balloons\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe ones you suggested, Jonas\u2019s mother gave us some, and Martha got the rest from what she remembered of the wedding video!\u201d Mikkel said.\n\u201cJust be grateful you never had to actually sit through the video,\u201d Magnus snorted, lightly hitting Mikkel on the back of his head.\nAs Michael sits towards the back of Winden Church, watching Katharina walk down the aisle towards Ulrich, Hannah as bridesmaid, as he watches Ulrich and Katharina\u2019s first dance to 99 Red Balloons, he wishes he had the chance to tell Magnus he just caught the live show."
