How do you navigate a partnership with someone who solves cases effortlessly but challenges your patience at every turn?",
        "story": "Morse, Robbie had heard that long before he met the man himself, was\u2026 difficult. Which was not the word his colleagues had used precisely, but still, it came close enough, and he felt that one should have respect for a superior officer, especially one who had his success rate, Even if he never seemed to have found a sergeant who worked well with him. But that, too, didn\u2019t have to mean anything \u2013 some people just preferred working alone, and Morse certainly brought the results that they needed, so that no one had ever complained, apart from, if he remembered correctly, Superintendent Strange, but there were a few\nstrange\nrumours going on about him and the lodge, too, so he thought their boss probably didn\u2019t have a leg to stand on when it came to this.\nStill\u00a0 morse had a reputation, so when he had happened across him on a case, he hadn\u2019t expected much. He\u2019d probably have the whole thing solved in a day or two, and Robbie would be left to do the paperwork, which was usually the case anyway. He supposed it was something to have met the big man, anyway.\nApart from \u2013\nWell, it was something else to actually\nsee\nhim work. If it had not been for DCI Morse\u2019s well-known\u2026 opinions eh would call them he would have assumed that the man should have been even above Superintendent Strange in rank at this point, but instead, here he was, solving one of the most complicated murders Robbie had ever seen like it was nothing.\nAfterwards, they went their separate ways, naturally.\nUntil the next case where Morse needed a sergeant and Robbie was available. He thought so at the time, at least \u2013 later much alter he would learn that morse had actually requested him and that strange, utterly relieved that he would finally ask for someone by name, had immediately handed Robbie over like a parcel even though he would never have said it like that in front of either of them.\nAnd so, here they were, with another case under their belt, doing the paperwork in Morse\u2019s office, or perhaps, rather, Robbie doing most of it while Morse was busy listening to some classics LP or another, but that too, he had known before..\nIf he had ever imagined something like that, he would perhaps have thought that Morse would just go and not keep him company, so he supposed that was something, and he knew through the grapevine that hr controlled every piece of paperwork that passed his desk anyway even if he didn\u2019t want anyone to know.\nWhen eh was done, he stood up and handed Morse the files, feeling ever so slightly down. He actually enjoyed working with him, much as yes, he could be a difficult, miserable sod, but that was neither here nor there anyway\u2026\n\"That was good work\" Morse then sad as if it was nothing.\nIt actually rendered him speechless for a second \u2013 had Morse just \u2013 he really had to mark this date in his calendar. This was undoubtedly the pinnacle of his career, unless he actually managed to do the bloody course and become an inspector, as Val aways said he would, but Robbie always figured she was a bit biased when it came to him and what he was capable of.\n\u201cI \u2013 I \u2013 \u201c he cleared his throat. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d\nMorse looked at him and nodded, once, twice, seemingly thinking about something, then saying, \u201cYou\u2019re without a governor at the moment, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cThere are only so many inspectors who need a bagman, and currently they all have one.\u201d He always told himself not to be too disappointed when yet another one of his colleagues was picked. True, he usually prided himself on getting along with pretty much everyone, so why he of all people should not yet have been asked to be someone\u2019s bagman, but anyway, that was neither here nor there, and \u2013\n\u201cI could use someone. If you want to work with me, that is.\u201d\nHe needed a moment or two to understand what Morse was saying, just because he would never have thought it possible. Yes, he had enjoyed working with him on that aces, notwithstanding the fact that a woman had lost her life, but still, this was DCI Morse, and he would never \u2013\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s not mandatory. There is no \u2013\u201c\n\u201cYes, sir I would like that very much\u201d he interrupted him before he could let that chance pass him by even though he still hadn\u2019t quite grasped what was happening.\n\u201cAlright then\u201d. He raised an eyebrow. \u201cTime for a drink at the pub, le-wis.\u201d\nAnd even though it was just the beginning of him leaving way too large of a portion of his wages at public houses, he would never regret it."

        "story": "At first, he cannot believe it.\nThis is, this is finally it.\nRight there, in the file he has been working on through sheer boredom, is a list of accounts on the Kaiman islands, hidden in plain view. He doubts anyone who has not done a little shuffling and coding themselves would be able to figure it out.\nWhich is why Peter gave him the file, of course. He\u2019s supposed to tell him immediately, and then they can shut this down, get the money back to those it belongs to.\nBut\n, a voice in Neal\u2019s head whispers,\ndoes it really matter\n? It\u2019s gone, and there is every reason to suppose the victims were insured for that kind of thing. He most likely could grab the cash for himself and no one would be the wiser, only that he would have everything eh could need to \u2013 need to \u2013\nHe quickly outs a plan together. He could be out of here by the middle of next week.\nAnd then Peter steps out of his office, does the two-finger-point, and he automatically gets up to see him.\n\u201cAnd?\u201d Peter asks because of course at the moment he can only mean that one case. That many millions going missing tend to make the higher-ups nervous.\n\u201cHe\u2019s certainly creative\u201d Neal says, playfully opening and closing the file because this is what peter expects from him and the last thing he needs is to arouse suspicion. \u201cThinks outside the box, has a tendency to \u2013\u201c\n\u201cYes, yes, but I definitely don\u2019t need a detailed critique of his work. I need to know what he did with the money.\u201d\nAnd this is when he makes his mistake, although not in the way he would have supposed he would, if he\u2019d thought about it at all. \u201cHow do you know\u201d he says \u201cthat I haven\u2019t figured it out already? Might make a run for it.\u201d\nPeter chuckles \u2013 as if it\u2019s a joke when this is Neal Caffrey they are talking about, the man an entire Bureau of agents couldn\u2019t catch until Peter Burke figured out his one weakness, and he almost feels a little angry.\nUntil the next words escape Peter\u2019s mouth.\n\u201cI know you better\u201c he says, when he really doesn\u2019t. When, as a matter of fact, he should be aware that Neal hasn\u2019t really changed, did not take any of the lessons he was supposed to learn to heart, was only ever trying to get away.\nNeal looks at him, in his hands his ticket out of here, to another life, one without a nine-to-five job, where he gets to do what he wants again, perhaps live in Paris or Rome or Florence, where he has no responsibilities, no watch dogs, no ties holding him down \u2013\nAnd he realizes that Peter knows, but that he cannot stop him. What he needs is there in the file, and he has a right to read it because he is his CI, and what he does in his spare time\u2026\nHe looks into his eyes and those words, those four words, keep repeating themselves in his head.\nI know you better. I know you better. I know you better.\nReally what does it matter that he is about to prove Peter wrong? He has disappointed him often enough. And leaving, that\u2019s all he\u2019s ever wanted since he took this deal, isn\u2019t it? It got him out of prison, but this was never supposed to last. It was just his ticket out of his cell so he could go look for Kate, and then of course that \u2013 that \u2013\nAnd after, what else was he supposed to do? If he hadn\u2019t stuck around, the FBI would have been after him faster than he could blink, so he had to wait just a few more months, and then there was so much to do, or a case that he couldn\u2019t leave just to Peter because it would have meant him all but camping in his office again, and then he would have been in El\u2019s black books\u2026\nMore time has passed than Neal wants to admit himself, although he wants to dwell on the reason, the real reason for that even less.\nI know you better.\nHe looks into Peter\u2019s eyes and makes the decision without being aware of it, without thinking,\nyes, let\u2019s do this.\nInstead, he just answers, \u201clet me take another look.\u201d And he opens the file.\nNo all is lost yet. He might \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s a code. Let me see what I can do about it.\u201d\nAnd he knows he\u2019s done it now because even if he pretended not to figure it out, Peter would realize there was something.\nAnd yet there is no regret, no anger at himself, nothing.\nPeter nods at him, smiling. \u201cAlright. Let me know.\u201d\nAnd he nods back and returns to \u2013 his desk."

        "story": "When it came to humans, Crowley had learned that early on, there was always something. One could never trust that they were done, even if they had managed to gather in a group and build a city and procured everything they needed to live comfortably; no, there was always something more, and that something more usually consisted on them fighting over nothing, or at least nothing that made sense. It was one of those things that made them so frustrating and so interesting at the same time.\nAt elates, even he would admit that, this Solomon fellow was rather clever. Being a judge, settling disputes left and right. New, technically he should have been against all of that, being a demon and so on, but at the same time\u2026 you had to admire him, just a little-. Most humans, no, most demons, he \u2013 heaven. Most angels would not have done such a good job, which he was very aware of because he had once worked closely with Gabriel and it had not been a pleasant experience.\nQuite different from that very first time he had met \u2013\n\u201cAngel\u201d he greeted him, strolling up to Aziraphale, who was watching the proceedings utterly enchanted, as he was wont to when humans proved how clever they could be.\nHe turned to him. \u201cHe \u2013 oh. Crowley.\u201d\nAt times like these, he wondered if Aziraphale remembered when they had first met, when they had still been angels, but it didn\u2019t matter. All that was long gone now, simply because he had dared asked questions, and now they were hereditary enemies, or at least supposed to be, although that had never stopped them from getting on since Eden, even though from his perspective, Aziraphale would have had every reason to get angry at him.\n\u201cPretty clever that Solomon, you have to admit\u201d he said. \u201cSeeing which woman would be ready to give the child up rather than watch them being cut in half.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d Aziraphale replied, looking at him and frowning. It\u2019s \u2013 I mean \u2013 only \u2013 a little bit ruthless for someone who is supposed to be so God-fearing\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut effective. Humans will talk about this for millennia to come.\u201d He could already see a man scribbling away on one of those clay tablets that were all the range, these days. Undoubtedly this was one of those scenes that would get passed down, although it would probably get a bit distorted across the years because that was how things tended to work out when they got involved.\nCrowley personally found it rather interesting, but he knew some of the other demons were more angry than anything else \u2013 probably supposed to be because that was what they were, and the angels \u2013\nBetter not go there. Apart from \u2013 his angel, he had never really gotten along with any of them, even back when he was still an angel himself.\nNot that he had fared any better with the other demons. He was starting to think that Aziraphale was just an exception \u2013 as wonderful and as strange as it was disconcerting, and yet he would not have traded their\u2026 relationship (not a relationship, of course not, not like that, nit like the humans, why was he even thinking about that, it was utterly ridiculous, it could not be, it would not be, and he was going to stop thinking about this right now).\n\u201cI do hope the child will have a good life\u201d Aziraphale said, wringing his hands, and Crowley did not know what to say. Human lives could be very fickle and complicated, so\u2026\n\u201cShe would not have done this just to let them fall later\u201d he said vine though he was far from certain about this. So, instead, he decided to nudge him and move on. Only that he was surprised at the words that escaped his mouth.\n\"it's a new day, let's go\". He had no idea why he would say something like that, and whether it would work \u2013 first of all, there were not really days in Heaven or Hell, so they were not used to this sort of talk and second of all, why should Aziraphale go with him? It was asinine to \u2013\n\u201cThere is a nice little tavern three streets over.\u201d\nHe blinked then looked at the angel, then towards where he was pointing, ridiculous of course because not even they with their powers could see that far without performing a miracle, and while he could easily have done so, doing it in front of Aziraphale would mean that his \u2013 friend? Were they fiends? He thought so, but he had no idea if Aziraphale felt the same way, but this was only in his thoughts, so his friend \u2013 yes he would be asked to explain the miracle, so he didn\u2019t think about and indeed turned back to him.\n\u201cAlright then\u201d he agreed and off they were."

        "story": "In the beginning, Camille would be the first to admit, she had hated working with Richard. He had seemed pedantic, rude and unlikeable, and in some ways, she would admit that he was\u2026 just\u2026 not the way she had thought. Yes, he did not quite understand social cues now and then, and he could be stubborn when running down a lead, but she had come to realize he also cared deeply about the victims and that each and every case should be wrapped up because it was his duty to do so.\nAnd this was just another example.\nAlice Morgan had been found dead a week ago on the beach, and there was almost nothing to go on. The tide had gotten to her before she had been found \u2013 really it was a miracle that she had not been swept away by the sea, which was undoubtedly what the murderer had wanted \u2013 there was little evidence, no reason why someone should murder her, nothing.\nCamille had seen enough such cases over the course of her career to feel that it was hopeless, and was all but resigned to that fact.\nRichard, as it turned out, not so much.\nThey had all gone home for the day. There was nothing to be done until they got the lab results back, although Camille was rather sure that that would lead to nothing, either, so she did it best not to think about it \u2013\nUntil she\u2019d realized she\u2019d forgotten her wallet at the station because she\u2019d had to reorganise her purse and her drawers (maman, when she told her alter, would make some comments about imitating a certain someone, but there would be enough interesting developments for her to deal with anyway) and quickly returned to grab it. And what she found was Richard still going through the evidence.\nShe glanced at her watch \u2013 close to ten pm. She had known he worked long hours, of course, just like she was aware that he found it difficult to sleep anyway with the weather (and she was trying, really trying, to get him to find a place with a proper AC, figuring he would not be so cranky if eh wasn\u2019t so hot all the time).\nWondering if she should say something, then deciding that against all odds, they were friends, she cleared her throat as she stepped into the station. \u201cRicard, I didn\u2019t know you were still here\u2026\u201d\nHe looked up and blinked, clearly needing a moment or two to recognize her, and she would have Eben worried if she ah dot come to understand him much better than she had at the beginning. He had simply been lost in thought and she just had to wait.\nThen he asked, \u201cCamille? Is there something you need?\u201d as if he was not working late into the night.\n\u201cI just needed something from my desk, that is all\u2026\u201d after a moment or two she added \u201c\u00a7I didn\u2019t think anyone would still be here.\u201d\n\u201cI told you before, in London we usually have two teams, so really, this is just me trying my best\u2026\u201d\nAnd naturally he had not mentioned it to anyone because why would he. She suppressed a sigh than sat down at her desk. \u201cFine, let\u2019s go over it again.\u201d\n\u201cI \u2013 oh \u2013\u201c he was clearly surprised \u201cCamille, you don\u2019t have to \u2013 I am sure you have plans \u2013 \u201c\n\u201cAs a matter of fact I don\u2019t, and even if I had, why should you work away all alone?\u201d\nIt was then that he shrugged and said quietly \u201cI\u2019m used to it.\u201d\n\u201cRichard\u201d she tried, \u201cWe really have to make sure we\u2019re well-\u201c\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving up\u201d he interrupted her stubbornly. The victim serves justice, and \u2013\u201c\nAnd she realized that this was not about Richard being right, or proving himself better than the rest of the team, or anything else she would have assumed just after he had been transferred here.\nNo, this was simply about solving the case, giving the victim back whatever dignity they could have, and she raised a hand to quietly say, \u201cRichard, I know.\u201d\nThis interrupted him mid-rant and he looked at her, then nodded, as if he was shocked that she had agreed.\nThen a groan made itself known and she raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have dinner, did you?\u201d\n\u201cI \u2013 \u201c he cleared his throat. \u201cI figured this was more important \u2013\u201c\n\u201cIt is important, but you need to keep up your strength.\u201d She made a quick decision. \u201cCome on, I can make you something quick at my place.\u201d\nHe blushed. \u201cCamille, I \u2013 just \u2013 It\u2019s very kind of you, but \u2013 \u201c\n\u201cNo buts. Come on.\u201d And against all odds, he followed her.\nAt least in later years, she didn\u2019t have to tell him to come to dinner. Sending one of their children to fetch Dad usually did the trick."

Decades? His life?\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you should play with fire. But of course that\u2019s it \u2013 you grew bored and you wanted to spice things up a bit.\u201d\nNow he was growing uncomfortable, not euclase Dean Winchester continued to berate him, but because he had hit the nail on the head.

Then, she inquired, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d Tone, she had learned early on, was everything with Richard; and she was very careful lest she sound accusatory or even as if she was ridiculing him.\n\u201cI \u2013 yes, I am now, thank you.\u201d\n\u201cRichard\u2026\u201d\nHe took a deep breath. \u201cI have to apologize.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just sometimes I get these \u2013 these thoughts and \u2013 there was this really big critter, you see and \u2013 \u201c he took another deep shaky breath. \u201cIt just \u2013 goes round and round in my head and I can\u2019t stop it. It\u2019s not \u2013 It\u2019s not normal of course, I mean \u2013\u201c\nNo, it most likely wasn\u2019t\u2026 from all that she knew of him, she would guess obsessive-compulsive (not that she liked him any less for it, and she was ready to bet the others felt the same). \u201cAnd? Do you feel better now?\u201d\nHe nodded miserably and she reached out to lay a hand on his arm. \u201cRichard, you have to know that \u2013 yes, I am aware this can\u2019t be easy for you. But there are ways to manage.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how? I can\u2019t get off this bloody island \u2013 \u201c\nNow, that was not something she liked to hear but she moved on from it, for now. \u201cI meant \u2013 well \u2013 you could be looking for a place with proper doors and windows \u2013\u201c\n\u201cHave you seen the prices around here? And it\nhas\nto be close to the station, and it\ndoesn\u2019t\nhave to be too big, alright, maybe that wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but \u2013 \u201c\nShe stayed quiet so he wouldn\u2019t realize what he had just divulged, instead saying, \u201cI will gladly help you.\u201d\nThat shut him up.\nAnd so, she was the one to grab a notepad for once and start making a list.\nHe did protest when it came to some things \u2013 seafood and different clothes \u2013 but she told him that some things had to give, and eventually,\neventually\n, she won that fight.\nReally, it was only the beginning of some happy developments.\nEven if it meant that she had to deal with these \u2013 Richard insisted on calling them \u201cepisodes\u201d when really it was nothing.\nAnd in that, he too, mellowed over the years, the fact that she eventually found him pouring over an encyclopedia of insects with their five-year-old proving it."

        "story": "So far, things had been going as well as they could be expected to. He was trying to influence young warlock towards Hell, while Aziraphale was doing the same but into the other direction, and as far as Crowley could tell from his experience which was rather\u2026 a lot more than he would admit to because he had always had a soft spot for kids, no matter whether they were literal hell spawn or not, Warlock was as ordinary as he could be.\nAnd then Aziraphale came to him, looking worried and haggard, and he knew something was up.\nWhat had happened? He certainly had not been interested in nuclear weapons during the lesson last week, and he had looked rather bored when Crowley had told him that bedtime story about Godzilla last night \u2013\n\u201cIt\u2019s just \u2013 oh dear \u2013 you better come.\u201d\nNormally they tried to make it seem like they didn\u2019t know one another so he immediately felt worried as they repaired to Warlock\u2019s room.\nAs first, he didn\u2019t think too much of it \u2013 he was playing with one of his Lego sets\u2026\nAnd then he heard what he was\nactually\nsaying.\n\u201cAaaaaaaaah, it burns, save yourselves!\nNoooooooooooooo Father!\nIt\u2019s got me it\u2019s too late tell your mother I love her\u2026l\u201d\nAll in all it was a rather impressive display, he would say that, especially since the child in question was only six years old, but that didn\u2019t distract him from the fact that the theme of his play was rather dark and that this was not something a child should come up with\u2026 on the other hand, maybe it was. Yes, he knew children, but that also meant he was aware they could come up with all kinds of stuff.\nBut that Aziraphale had called him in meant that there might be more to this story.. as a matter of fact, when he turned to him, he looked\u2026 guilty?\nBut why should he feel guilty, if there was one thing he knew, it was that they had an arrangement when it came to Warlock \u2013 one of many over the centuries, although they all paled in front if the big one that had been in place almost since they had known each other \u2013\nThere was only one explanation, he realized, and that was that the angel had mentioned something he shouldn\u2019t have.\n\u201cDid you stick to the plan?\u201d he asked even though it was a very stupid inquiry. Not because of his thought process, as just demonstrated, but because it was the wrong wording (and eh should know If there was one thing he could count on when it came to Aziraphale, it would that he would remain on the path he was absolutely sure God had chosen for him \u2013\nOnly that he looked \u2013 well \u2013 not very comfortable right now and yes \u2013 here came the hand-wringing \u2013\nSomething was up. \u201cAngel\u201d he hissed. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cWell he wanted to hear about the destruction of Pompei\u201d.\n\u201cWhat \u2013 the \u2013 he\u2019s five! How did he even know about that?\u201d\n\u201cAs far as I can understand, he was playing by himself in a corridor\u201d that often happened with children of rich parents, Crowley knew, all the money in the world and yet they ended up with little to no friends, he would have to talk to Mrs. Downing about kindergarten again, they could not just let this happen \u201cand his father had a meeting bin his office and the door was open and someone compared the current geopolitical situation with 79 AC.\u201d\nWhich was idiotic because, well, most of what was wrong with things currently was the humans fault. Crowley knew that, his angel knew that, and they knew it too. But of course that was not what Warlock would take from the story, as he was clearly demonstrating because he was currently watching family melt in his mind with relish.\nThis did not seem very heavenly to Crowley. Didn\u2019t even seem very hell-y either, if he was being honest. They would have let them suffer more.\nNot that he was about to suggest that. They had enough trouble as it was.\n\u201cFine. So what do we do now?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about taking him there \u2013\u201c\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just tell his parents were taking a small child on a holiday, and he\u2019d probably have fun. That would be counterproductive.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you suggest then \u2013\u201c\n\u201cLet me try.\u201d\nAnd, with his experience when it came to children, ten minutes later he had Warlock stage a rescue operation that would never have worked in real life, but who was he to judge? As far as he was concerned this was progress.\nAnd if Aziraphale stayed and watched them both with something like awe on his face, neither of them would mention it for the next few decades to come."

        "story": "The thing was, Peter had known from the beginning that this was a really really terrible idea. Much as the Chairman would protest that the Captain should be able to handle all of this because he hadn\u2019t seen his family in years, because it was his duty, because he should know better \u2013 the Chairman wasn\u2019t human, it was as plain and simple as that. They didn\u2019t talk about that, of course, because it would not be very wise, but still. The point was, he could not, would not get that Dev was suffering just by being in the town he had grown up in, knowing his family lived and breathed and laughed within its walls and had no idea that there was someone missing from their midst.\nBut with all of that\u2026 there was something else, and that was that Peter was reasonably sure he was the only one who knew how bad it was. Partly because he and Dev were not accustomed to hide things from one another, and partly because\u2026 well\u2026 mow that he was building up the Guard, no one would dare to question how he was doing and what he was feeling.\nNo one except Peter that was, but they were friends \u2013 as a matter of fact, Dev was the first friend he had ever made in his life.\nAnd so, he kept a close eye on Dev, even closer than usual, that was \u2013 with magic involved, it was always a good idea to Saty on one\u2019s guard, in case anyone tried anything, so he was already careful. It was one of the things he\u2019d had to accept when he had chosen this life, but he did not regret it and very much suspected that he never would.\nNow, when it came to them, they were used to what they called their bad nights. When Peter remembered the cane or dev woke up from a dream believing to be sixteen years old again with Joan and Sam clamoring for his attention, when a case reminded them that time was fleeting and that any day they might \u2013 they had experience dealing with such things, that was what he meant to say, but all of this \u2013 is what usually just that \u2013 a bad night. Not a constant deluge of being reminded what they could not have, and it was easy to tell that it was wearing Dev down, only that he would not admit I because he would not risk being sent back to London, so there was no way that he could just\u2026 ask. Because there were lines he did not cross, not when it came to Dev\u2019s family.\nOr maybe not because he woke up and could just tell it was a Abd night. They usually could, although peter knew that he himself had had much more bad nights than Dev over the years, although his friend would deny that.\nHe got up and went into the living room and found Dev standing at the window, staring out at the city he had tried so hard to get back to, only that it was not the city he had left behind on that fateful day.\n\u201cHey\u201d he said as usual, sitting down because asking would lead to nothing. He knew him too well for that.\nIt took a while but eventually Dev walked over and sat down too, staring at his folded hands.\nPerter continued to wait.\n\u201cNo\u201c he finally said, even though Peter had as of yet asked no questions, quietly like a confession, like something shameful even though it was not, it very much was not, \u201cI\u2019m not okay\u201d.\nAn understatement of course, the bloody understatement of the bloody century, but there was nothing they could o about it. Even if Dev could have left Oxford again \u2013 which he would have refused to do anyway \u2013 it would not have done any good, now that he had seen them, now that they were playing happy family in front of him \u2013 no, not playing, just\nbeing\na happy family, and that made everything worse, so much worse \u2013\nPeter did not know what to say. How could he even begin to understand? Dev himself was the closest thing he had ever had to a family, and he wasn\u2019t quite sure being taken in after almost having been devoured by a vampire counted.\nHe stared down into his tea, wishing it could be something stronger but at the same time aware that this was a slippery slope, a very slippery slope indeed, and that he might not stop if he ever started.\n\u201cI \u2013 \u201c he finally began because despite the many, many nights they had spent like this, he still didn\u2019t know what to say.\nDev glanced at him then, smiled and said, \u201cThank you, Peter.\u201d\nAnd for some reason, it was enough yet again."

        "story": "\u201cThis is getting ridiculous, wouldn\u2019t you say, Father?\u201d Lady Felicia asks one day as they are having tea in the rectory garden.\nWhile he is aware that she is prone to overexaggeration, much as dear Mrs. M is prone to taking the Bible too seriously, and has long since grown accustomed to their respective\u2026 well\u2026 spleens, he simply raises an eyebrow and asks, \u201cWhat exactly is ridiculous, Lady F?\u201d\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t act like that. Sid and the dear inspector. You have to admit it\u2019s obvious, only they won\u2019t admit it to themselves.\u201d\nHe has to say that, as of late, it truly is rather mysterious as to why these two have not been able to figure things out. Sid has not done any breaking and entering in months, unless it be for a case, and Inspector Sullivan has grown more and more lenient in certain ways, to the point where he will only put up a token it of resistance when Father Brown himself shows up at a crime scene. Honestly, it\u2019s sort of a nice change of pace, even if he says so himself.\nStill \u2013 there are some things they have to consider because, despite God declaring that love comes from him and as such is a gift to be treasured, there are people who do not agree, who think that some forms of love should not be allowed, that it is sinful when it truly is not, when it really could not be, not like this, when both of them clearly feel the same.\nIt\u2019s rather sad, and he wishes the world were different, despite living in the best possible world, naturally, but still\u2026\n\u201cIt does appear that the inspector is no longer nearly as annoyed with Sid as he used to be\u201d he therefore declares diplomatically, because it\u2019s the closest he can come to actually admitting any of this out loud out of sheer habit, and she gives him a knowing smile.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time to... encourage them wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d\n\u201dI don\u2019t think the Inspector would like that very much\u201d is his honest answer.\n\u201cOh he\u2019ll thank me later\u201d she says and he knows from experience that eh can\u2019t dissuade her, but at least he has a good enough opinion of the inspector\u2019s heart not to worry too much.\nAs it turns out in the coming weeks, Lady felicia\u2019s plan is to throw them together as much as possible and hope for the best. Which might of course work, but at the same time, eh has the feeling that the inspector might need a bit more encouragement than that. Sid \u2013 oh, he\u2019s under no delusions in that regard. Sid is probably more than ready to throw caution to the wind, but then, he\u2019s not working for the police and has seen the inside of a jail more than once, even though until now he\u2019s gotten off lightly.\nAnd so, he watches the two of them clear out lady F\u2019s shed because apparently the Gardner doesn\u2019t have time, which is a lie, or work away on her car, because for some reason the chauffeur seems to have gone the way of the gardener (at elates that\u2019s an activity they both enjoy) and then, on a rather memorable occasion, keep the two small girls of her visiting cousin occupied (as it turns out to no one\u2019s surprise, the good inspector is better at keeping everyone in check while Sid takes care of the entertainment).\nAs far as he can tell, at least they seem to be getting along now, and to no longer pretend that they don\u2019t like each other, although they clearly have not gone any further\u2026\nAgain, it is not his life, and he really should not know about this, thinking of the church, so he decides to let things take their course, and it seems that they do, about two weeks later, if he is right.\nHe certainly has never seen Inspector Sullivan smile at a crime scene, but the real surprise is that he simply looks at him and shrugs. \u201cComing to take a guess, Father?\u201d\n\u201cI just want to pray for the poor soul, and see if I can identify them.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case\u2026 be my guest.\u201d\nHe decides not to comment because certainly the inspector has his reasons.\nSaid reasons how up ten minutes on their favorite motorbike and Father brown, even if he does say so himself, does a very good impression of a man who is much too busy realizing why the inspector is hurrying over the street.\nEven so, he catches Sergeant Goodfellow\u2019s eyes and they smiled at one another.\nAt least he will be able to tell Lady Felicia that all is well the next time she comes over for tea.

There is finally proper tea around every corner, as opposed to just one place on an entire island that serves it (not that he would ever say so out loud on saint Marie, catherine must never know), it rains (real rain, cold, wet, terrible rain) and he can walk down the streets without being assaulted by colours everywhere (although eh will admit that he doesn\u2019t mind the colours too much, all things considered. They are\u2026 well, they liven up a place, he is ready to admit that if only to himself).\nAlthough at the same time\u2026 something is missing, and he just can\u2019t put his finger on it, which frustrates him because it\u2019s basically his job to do just that.\nHe\u2019ll figure it out eventually, he tells himself, because he always does. He doesn\u2019t mention it to anyone, of course, because it is ridiculous.\nPlus, it\u2019s not like anyone could actually help him in this regard (or so he thinks). After all, he doesn\u2019t really have friends (if he doesn\u2019t count Camille and his team on Saint Marie) and when it comes to his parents.. well\u2026 they are not.. that close (like Camille and Catherine, for example). And he\u2019s not in the habit of making small talk anyway (although dad called him a chatterbox not long ago because he was describing the market on the island and got carried away).\nBut really, if he were to review his stay in London so far, eh would say that all has been going rather well. The lats few days especially, when he was wrapping everything up and working through when he can return to Saint maire, which will be in five days time, not that he is counting.\nAnd then Mum jumps on him the second he enters their house, telling him she\u2019s made tea, and at first he doesn\u2019t understand why she seems so eager, and then \u2013\n\u201cSo you say Saint Marie is lovely at this time of the year?\u201d\n\u201cHot.

And Camille specially \u2013\u201c And then he\u2019s off explaining again that she is after him to install an A/C, but that it would be a waste in his shack.\nAfter he falls silent, Mum seems to think about something or other, so he searches fort a topic of conversation and has started asking after old Mrs. Webster from next door, when \u2013\n\u201cI saw your eyes light up\u201d his mother then declares in one of those non-sequiturs she loves, and Richar is once again lost.\n\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\nShe shakes her head. \u201cWhen you mentioned Camille. I saw your eyes light up.\u201d\n\u201cI \u2013 what does that even mean?\u201d Eyes do not light up. He is aware it\u2019s used metaphorically, of course, but even so, he could never quite understand what people meant by it.\nShe gives him a look he remembers from his teen years when he dared try and smoke cigarettes in his room \u2013 alright, one cigarette, one afternoon, and that expression put a stop to it immediately. But he\u2019s no longer a child, so \u2013\n\u201cTell me more about Camille\u201d she then demands, and he can\u2019t really say anything against that because she is his second in command, and he likes to imagine a friend, even if he would dispute the fact as he did already once before when she seemed to suggest such.\nAde so, he talks about Camille and how she made him agree to small talk in the mornings and spending time at la Kaz after the day is done and that she likes to show up and drag him out of his \u201cmonastic cell\u201d as she insists on calling it and that he usually goes with her because it\u2019s easier\u2026 undoubtedly Mum, who has always appreciated her own company too, otherwise she would hardly have married his father, who can be even more silent than Richard on any given occasion, will understand that it can be frustrating for him \u2013\nBut for some reason, she just keeps smiling, and he keeps talking and\u2026\nHe forces himself to stop because certainly no one should know this much about a colleague, but Mum simply smiles again and pats his hand. \u201cI\u2019m sure your differences are not all that great, dearest. It will all work out.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not quite sure what she means, but instead focuses back on what he has to pack.\nMum will tell him, she usually does.\nAs she indeed does, five years later when she convinces Dad to move to Saint Marie once and for all so they can watch their grandchildren grow up, Camille more than happy to help her parents-in-law settle in."
