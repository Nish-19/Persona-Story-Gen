        "writing_prompt": "After an off-world mishap leaves Daniel tangled in thorny vegetation, Jack offers his \"help\" with a mix of teasing and questionable grooming advice. What happens next?",
        "story": "Glaring at his reflection in the mirror, Daniel painstakingly unravelled bits if bramble-like twig from his hair. He\u2019d already tried combing them out, only succeeding in pulling out half his hair in the process, but he couldn\u2019t shower until he got rid of every last thorny bit, and it was taking forever.\nThe worst part was that it was his own fault. Jack had warned him to watch where he was stepping, the ground had been slick and muddy following a heavy shower, but Daniel had been more interested in the ruins he could see in the valley below them than in what was beneath his own feet. Which turned out to be a monumentally bad lapse of judgement.\nSlipping and falling because of his own carelessness had been embarrassing enough, but skidding at high speed downslope on his butt, flying off the edge of the path, somehow somersaulting in midair, and plunging headfirst into a clump of the thorny native vegetation had been downright humiliating, especially since it had meant Jack and Teal\u2019c had to pull him out. At least his glasses had protected his eyes, but his face and hands had gotten scratched to glory. To add insult to injury, Jack had found the whole thing hilarious, awarding him a score of five out of ten, telling him he needed to work on his landing.\n\u201cNeed a hand there?\u201d\nSpeak of the devil\u2026 Daniel closed his eyes and gritted his teeth, not wanting to endure more teasing. \u201cI can manage.\u201d\n\u201cYou sure? There\u2019re some twigs back here might give you some trouble since you don\u2019t have eyes in the back of your head. Not that I know of.\u201d\nFumbling though his hair, Daniel yelped as he impaled a finger on a particularly sharp thorn, and Jack sighed. \u201cY\u2019know, Daniel, if I\u2019d known you were so eager to try flying, I would\u2019a given you lessons. All ya had to do was ask.\u201d\nShoulders sagging, Daniel resigned himself to enduring another round of light-hearted mockery. \u201cReally,\u201d he said, tone flat as the proverbial pancake.\n\u201cYeah, maybe not.\u201d Fingers tugged at the back of Daniel\u2019s hair, and a couple more pieces of twig were tossed into the bin. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re wearing those big curlers. You know, like the battleaxe housewives in the funnies.\u201d\n\u201cI suspect those would be less painful.\u201d\n\u201cLess thorny at least. Might have to cut some of these out.\u201d Jack resumed tugging again.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Daniel froze, visions of Jack hacking at his hair filling his head.\n\u201cThe twigs, not your hair; smaller pieces should come out easier.\u201d Jack kept working for a few minutes. \u201cAlthough shaving your hair off might be quicker.\u201d\nStaring into the mirror, Daniel met Jack\u2019s eyes, and smiled faintly. \u201cNot sure I could get away with the bald look. Unlike Teal\u2019c, I don\u2019t have the head for it.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d Jack agreed, smirking slightly.\n\u201cStill, maybe it\u2019s time for a haircut. Travelling off-world, my hair\u2019s becoming a bit of a liability.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an option,\u201d Jack agreed. \u201cAnd I happen to know a great barber if you need one.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Jack. I\u2019ll keep that I mind.\u201d\nThe End"

        "story": "\u201cOne last question, Mr Jeffries,\u201d Ryo said briskly, bringing the conversation to a close. \u201cCan you tell us where you were last Saturday afternoon between one and four?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. I was supposed to have the day off, I don\u2019t generally work weekends, but I got called in to an unscheduled board meeting, so I was there most of the afternoon. Arrived at the office around noon and didn\u2019t get home until after five.\u201d\n\u201cYou work for Orien Finance, is that correct?\u201d\n\u201cYes, detective.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming someone there can corroborate your presence at this meeting?\u201d\n\u201cQuite a few people, yes. All heads of department were there. It was compulsory.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine then. Thank you for your time.\u201d Ryo and Dee stood to leave.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t be of more help. Let me show you out.\u201d Richard Jeffries showed the detectives to the door, and once outside, spoke hurriedly. \u201cDon\u2019t bother calling my work, there wasn\u2019t a meeting that day, that\u2019s just what I told my wife and if she finds out the truth, she\u2019ll kill me. Seriously!\u201d\nDee frowned. \u201cAre you sayin\u2019 you don\u2019t have an alibi for last Saturday?\u201d\n\u201cNo, of course I do. I just wasn\u2019t where my wife thinks I was. Look, I love her, and there\u2019s pretty much nothing I wouldn\u2019t do for her, but last Saturday her pregnant sister was throwing a gender reveal party, and I hate those things. I\u2019d rather have my eyeballs removed with a spoon than spend several hours listening to a bunch of people making a big deal of announcing what\u2026 uh\u2026 reproductive organs their kid has.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t blame ya for that,\u201d Dee agreed. \u201cOne of our work colleagues got dragged along to one, told me it put him off ever havin\u2019 kids.\u201d\n\u201cSo, if you weren\u2019t at work, where were you?\u201d Ryo got things back on track.\n\u201cWith three of my buddies at the Marine Park Golf Course. It was a great afternoon, I finished the course four strokes under par, best I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d Jeffries\u2019 eyes lit up at the memory. \u201cMy wife hates golf though. If she knew I skipped her sister\u2019s party to go play eighteen holes, I swear she\u2019d never let me hear the end of it.\u201d\n\u201cSo your golfing buddies are your alibis?\u201d\n\u201cYes, them and our caddies, and a few other folks saw us. Even chatted to a young couple who were ahead of us. The husband landed in a sand trap.\u201d Jeffries thrust a folded piece of paper at Dee in the guise of a handshake. \u201cThat\u2019s the names, addresses, and phone numbers of my buds, plus our tee time and the number for the golf course. Call them, they\u2019ll all tell you I was there, just please don\u2019t let my wife find out!\u201d\n\u201cLong as your alibi pans out, you\u2019ve got nothin\u2019 to worry about,\u201d Dee assured him. \u201cWe won\u2019t need to talk to ya again. But if you think of anyone who might have had a grudge against your former co-worker, anyone who might have wanted him dead, you\u2019ll let us know, right?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, detective. I mean, I didn\u2019t like Gus Lockwood, truth is I don\u2019t think anyone did, he wasn\u2019t a likeable guy and when he got himself fired, everyone was pretty happy about it, but I can\u2019t think of anyone who would have wanted to kill him. That\u2019s pretty extreme, even for a guy like Gus. I hope you catch his killer.\u201d\nRyo nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll do our best. Good day, Mr Jeffries.\u201d\nAs they got into their car, Dee passed the slip of paper to his partner. \u201cGuess that means we\u2019ve got another alibi to check out.\u201d\n\u201cAll part of the job. You want to talk to the golfing buddies first or drive out to the golf course?\u201d\n\u201cGolf course,\u201d Dee decided. \u201cOn an afternoon like this, who knows, the buddies might be fittin\u2019 in a few holes. Besides, if we can talk to a few people at the club, we might not haveta talk to Jeffries\u2019 pals at all.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe we should take up golf,\u201d Ryo joked. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be relaxing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nDee shot his partner a look. \u201cYou\u2019d better not be serious.\u201d\n\u201cWe could sign up for lessons.\u201d Ryo said, snickering at the expression on Dee\u2019s face.\n\u201cOver my dead body!\u201d\nThe End"

        "writing_prompt": "After a long day of chasing toddlers, cleaning up chaos, and wrangling mischievous pets, Ianto finally collapses into bed\u2014only for Jack to come home late from work with stories of his own. How do two exhausted partners find comfort in the chaos of their shared life?",
        "story": "Arriving home from work just after midnight, Jack quickly undressed in the dark, crawling into bed beside his husband with a sigh of relief.\n\u201cIs that you?\u201d Ianto mumbled, woken by the mattress moving beneath him.\n\u201cIt better be,\u201d Jack replied. \u201cIf you were expecting someone else, we need to talk. Just not tonight.\u201d\n\u201cTwpsyn,\u201d Ianto managed through a cavernous yawn. \u201cLike I\u2019d have the energy for anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d Propping himself up on one elbow, Jack leaned over to kiss Ianto. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t I just wish!\u201d\n\u201cRough day of house-husbanding?\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d\nJack was impressed by how much feeling Ianto could cram into such a short non-word. He cuddled up against his husband. \u201cSorry. If it\u2019s any consolation, work wasn\u2019t a picnic either. The Rift was running riot, and Gwen and Owen were squabbling like toddlers again. Speaking of toddlers, how were the twins? Or shouldn\u2019t I ask?\u201d Gareth and Jenna currently had the sniffles, noses dripping all over the place, although it didn\u2019t seem to be slowing them down any; at twenty months old, Ianto was convinced they must be somehow related to the Energiser bunny.\n\u201cLife was so much easier before they became mobile, when they were still just eating and pooping machines, never moving from where we put them. Gareth got away from me when I was changing his nappy, went running around the flat stark naked like an Olympic sprinter, or maybe a streaker. Took all three Fluffs almost twenty minutes to round him up. I would have helped, but Jenna got hold of the baby powder and was waving it around, looked like it was snowing indoors, and then she started sneezing, and I had no idea so much snot could come out of such a tiny nose. I had to clean her up and change her clothes. On the plus side, her cold\u2019s been much better since then. Gareth\u2019s still snuffly though.\u201d\n\u201cPoor Ianto.\u201d\n\u201cYes, poor me. After I dealt with Jenna, and got a clean nappy on Gareth, I had to dump them both in their playpen and mop up after him. He left\u2026 a bit of a trail. After that, I had to bath the Flufflets, while Nosy took a shower, and after THAT, I had to take a shower myself. By that point, I just wanted to crawl under the bed and hide, but there was a massive pile of laundry to do, the Holy Terrors were getting hungry, and I needed to refuel as well.\u201d Ianto heaved a weary sigh. \u201cFinally got them settled and asleep around eleven and crawled into bed.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then I woke you up.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t be helped.\u201d\n\u201cIf I\u2019d known what you had to deal with today, I would\u2019ve just crashed on the sofa.\u201d\n\u201cGood thing you didn\u2019t, it\u2019s still a bit wet from where I had to clean it.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d\n\u201cBesides, I sleep better when you\u2019re beside me. Means you\u2019re home and safe. Goodnight, cariad.\u201d\nJack smiled. \u201cGoodnight, Ianto. Sweet dreams.\u201d\nThe End"

        "writing_prompt": "After fainting at a crime scene and waking up in the ER with a stitched forehead, you realize the real challenge isn\u2019t the injury\u2014it\u2019s surviving the relentless teasing from your partner, Dee, who seems to find your misfortune endlessly entertaining.",
        "story": "Ryo was feeling embarrassed, but that was nothing new. Embarrassment was a fact of life since he\u2019d met Dee. What was far worse was that he felt like a complete idiot, which was fair since he\u2019d basically done this to himself. Here he was in the ER, having a cut on his forehead stitched, and all because he\u2019d fainted at a crime scene and hit his head on the rusted lip of a trash can as he\u2019d fallen. How stupid could he get?\nHe\u2019d seen plenty of murder scenes before, many of them far gorier than the one he and Dee had been attending. It was a relatively simple stabbing, and he knew full well that his fainting hadn\u2019t had anything to do with the blood, or the stench of rotting garbage. He was also well aware he\u2019d probably get teased relentlessly by his colleagues about fainting at the sight of blood. Well, let them laugh; it wasn\u2019t as if he could stop them.\nThe truth was, it had been roasting in that alley, and he\u2019d gotten overheated because he was still wearing both his suit jacket and his tie. Added to that, he was bordering on dehydration because he hadn\u2019t had anything to drink since breakfast and had spent half the morning chasing a suspect on another case, and\u2026 Well, he\u2019d simply gotten dizzy when he\u2019d stood up too fast after bending to get a closer look at the knife wounds to the victim\u2019s chest.\nOne moment he\u2019d been straightening up, turning to say something to Dee, and the next, the world had tilted alarmingly and the ground had seemed to rush up to meet him as he\u2019d toppled forward, before everything had gone black. He didn\u2019t even remember hitting his head.\nHe couldn\u2019t have been out for more than a couple of minutes, and probably less than that, but when he\u2019d opened his eyes, it had been to see Dee bending over him, berating him for\u2026 something. He\u2019d kind of missed that part, his head had been throbbing, his ears still ringing from the impact, and his brain too muzzy to take anything in. Probably it had been something about not taking better care of himself, which made him feel worse because how long would it really have taken to remove his jacket and tie, leave them in the car, and drink the bottle of water Dee had handed him an hour ago? Come to that, why was he even wearing a suit on the hottest day of the year, with temperatures edging past a hundred degrees? It was a miracle he didn\u2019t have heat stroke. Or maybe he did. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising.\nOnce the nurse had inserted the last of three sutures just above his left eyebrow, Ryo went back to sipping from the cup of water Dee had handed him. It was the third one in the last hour and he had to admit he felt a lot better for it, despite his aching head. Nevertheless, he\u2019d be stuck here for another few hours under observation, just to make sure he didn\u2019t have a concussion.\nTaking another slow sip of water, Ryo leaned back against the pillows, closing his eyes against the bright lights. It was blessedly cool in here, thanks to the air conditioning. Taking his jacket and tie off and rolling up his shirtsleeves didn\u2019t hurt either. If he was back at work tomorrow, which he hoped he would be, he planned on dressing more sensibly in chinos and a short-sleeved cotton shirt in deference to the summer temperatures; that was what he should have been wearing today, if he\u2019d had any sense. Dee was never going to let him hear the end of this.\nThe End"

        "writing_prompt": "On a planet with low gravity, your team struggles to stay grounded\u2014literally\u2014while navigating the strange terrain. But the real challenge begins when you discover you're not the only ones bouncing around.",
        "story": "Most of the planets they travel to through the Stargate are similar to earth. One sun, a breathable atmosphere, water, vegetation, in most cases including trees, more or less in the expected shades of green. Some planets are inhabited, mostly by humans, descendants of those the Goa\u2019uld took from earth to be bred as slaves. Occasionally they come across a humanoid but not exactly human race, like the Nox, but that\u2019s rare.\nSometimes they\u2019ll encounter native wildlife, birds, insects, fish, the odd animal, some of them very odd indeed, but as a rule, such creatures prefer to stay hidden, and who can blame them? Even animals soon learn that what comes through the Stargate isn\u2019t necessarily friendly.\nThis planet looks similar to the last half-dozen SG-1 has travelled to. The MALP didn\u2019t detect anything harmful in the atmosphere. The air is perhaps a little richer in oxygen than earth, but otherwise, there\u2019s not much to mark it out as an alien world, until they get there.\nO\u2019Neill bounds down the steps from the Stargate with an uncharacteristic spring in his step. It\u2019s not intentional, and it takes him by surprise.\n\u201cWatch your step!\u201d he says as the rest of the team arrive.\n\u201cWhy? Oh!\u201d Carter jumps down to join the Colonel and bounces into the air again the moment her feet touch the ground. O\u2019Neill reaches out to steady her as she touches down again, a bit off-balance. \u201cThank you, Sir. Gravity must be quite a bit less than earth normal.\u201d\n\u201cYa think?\u201d\n\u201cHow much less?\u201d Daniel goes past in a series of long leaps. \u201cThis is fun!\u201d\nTeal\u2019c raises an eyebrow and calmly descends the steps, flexing his knees to reduce the risk of unexpected rebound.\n\u201cI estimate somewhere between fifty-five and seventy percent of earth normal. I can\u2019t be more accurate than that without running a few tests.\u201d\n\u201cHow come nobody picked up on this before we came through?\u201d O\u2019Neill is moving around cautiously, not wanting to inadvertently aggravate his bad knee or jar his back. He\u2019d rather not wind up in the infirmary. Again.\n\u201cThe MALP\u2019s too heavy, Sir; any effect on it would have been negligible.\u201d\n\u201cHuh.\u201d O\u2019Neill glances around the clearing. \u201cDaniel! Stop bouncing around like a damn kangaroo and get back here!\u201d\nFor once Daniel follows orders. Well, he\u2019s still bouncing a bit, it\u2019s almost impossible not to, but at least he rejoins the others, grinning excitedly, the way he usually only does when there are ruins to poke around in.\n\u201cAlright, we stick together, and no acrobatics. Last thing we need is someone breaking their leg, or their neck.\u201d O\u2019Neill\u2019s looking directly at Daniel as he says that, and Daniel deflates a little.\n\u201cFine, but you\u2019re taking all the fun out of this.\u201d\n\u201cBetter that than having you bounce right off the edge of a cliff. Are you going to do as you\u2019re told, or do I need to put you on a leash?\u201d\n\u201cJaaack!\u201d\n\u201cNo bouncing! I mean it!\u201d\nThat is, of course, a pointless order; trying not to bounce is far more tiring than walking normally, and they can\u2019t walk normally without bouncing, so here they are, moving across the landscape like a bunch of khaki grasshoppers. Even the packs they\u2019re carrying do little to weigh them down.\nJack smiles slightly as he bounds onto a grassy hummock and off the other side. Daniel\u2019s right, it is kinda fun.\nThe End"
