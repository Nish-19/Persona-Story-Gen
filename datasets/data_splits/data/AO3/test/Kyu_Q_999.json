        "writing_prompt": "In a quiet chamber bathed in golden light, Annatar weaves jewels into Celebrimbor's hair, each gem a whispered promise, each touch a fleeting moment of devotion. But beneath the tenderness lies a shadow\u2014what truths remain unspoken between the Maia and the elf?",
        "story": "The sun was nearing its zenith, and the light filtered through the tall windows of their private chamber in soft, golden beams. It cast an ethereal glow upon the two figures within, making the room seem suspended between reality and some otherworldly realm.\nThe light played upon the fine lines and contours of Celebrimbor\u2019s face, making him look almost sublime, as though he were carved from light itself. Annatar sat perched in Celebrimbor\u2019s lap, his fingers deftly weaving delicate jewels into the elf\u2019s dark hair - it was as if he were offering a prayer to some higher power, and in a way, he was. Each gem, whether sapphire, diamond, or ruby, caught the light, adding a constellation of glittering stars to the already striking midnight of Celebrimbor\u2019s locks.\nThey were alone in the quiet room, the only sounds being the soft murmur of the wind outside and the occasional clink of metal as Annatar reached for another jewel from the small velvet box beside him. There was no rush, no pressure. Just the slow, deliberate act of adorning Celebrimbor, of turning his beloved into a vision that could have rivaled the splendor of the Valar themselves.\nToday, the rings and their grim purpose were far from Annatar's mind. There were no dark thoughts, no heavy burdens weighing down his heart. There was only this moment, where the world beyond ceased to exist and it was just them - Annatar and his beloved, enshrined in their own sanctuary of light and affection.\nCelebrimbor, for his part, seemed content to indulge Annatar\u2019s whims. He sat still, his back against the plush cushions on the wide settee, his arms loosely wrapped around Annatar's waist, as the Maia adorned his dark hair with jewels.\nTo an onlooker, it would have seemed like a scene from a dream - an image of devotion and love, of absolute adoration. And, for Annatar, it very much was.\nAnnatar leaned in, pressing a feather-light kiss to Celebrimbor\u2019s temple as he secured a small, delicate sapphire above his ear. \u201cPerfect,\u201d he whispered, his voice almost reverent. \u201cYou look divine. Like a star in the heavens.\u201d\nCelebrimbor chuckled softly, his head tilting slightly as he glanced at Annatar with a fond, amused smile. \u201cYou have a flair for exaggeration, my love,\u201d he said, though there was no denying the warmth in his gaze, the way he leaned into Annatar\u2019s touch. \u201cIt\u2019s just a few jewels.\u201d\nAnnatar\u2019s eyes sparkled with something almost feral, his grin widening as he pressed a gentle kiss to the corner of Celebrimbor\u2019s lips. \u201cNothing is ever \u2018just\u2019 anything when it comes to you, Tyelpe,\u201d he said, his voice carrying a hint of playfulness, but underneath it lay something deeper, something almost solemn. \u201cYou don\u2019t see yourself the way I do.\u201d\nHe leaned back slightly, his eyes roving over Celebrimbor\u2019s face, the curve of his lips, the sharp line of his jaw, the eyes that had fallen closed in contentment, the elegance that seemed to radiate from him in effortless waves. Annatar felt something fierce and tender rise in his chest, a feeling that was almost too much to contain, too big for even him to grasp fully.\n\u201cI sometimes think,\u201d he continued softly, his fingers now tracing the delicate shell of Celebrimbor\u2019s ear, where he had placed a small, intricate cuff adorned with moonstones, \u201cthat you could have been one of the Ainur. A Valar, even.\u201d There was a wistful note in his voice, a yearning for a reality that could not be.\nCelebrimbor opened his eyes, glancing at Annatar with a soft smile. \u201cA Valar?\u201d he repeated, amusement lacing his tone. \u201cI am far from that, I assure you.\u201d\nAnnatar shook his head, his fingers gently twining another jewel into Celebrimbor\u2019s hair. \u201cNo, you would have been perfect. You are perfect. Kind, wise, strong - everything a good Valar should be.\u201d\nCelebrimbor chuckled softly, the sound vibrating through Annatar\u2019s chest. \u201cYou speak as if you\u2019ve forgotten the many faults I have.\u201d\n\u201cFaults?\u201d Annatar echoed, his voice filled with mock disbelief. \u201cWhat faults, Tyelpe? If you have any, they are but the tiniest blemishes on a diamond, insignificant against your brilliance.\u201d\nCelebrimbor raised an eyebrow, clearly amused by Annatar\u2019s words, but he allowed the Maia his whimsy. It was rare for Annatar to indulge in such fanciful thoughts, to be so open with his affection, and he didn\u2019t want to break the spell.\n\u201cYou would have made a fine ruler of Maiar, my lord,\u201d Annatar continued, his voice soft, almost wistful.\nThe elf let out a soft sigh, his eyes closing again as he savored the warmth in Annatar\u2019s words, the sheer adoration that shone in his gaze. He felt the weight of the jewels in his hair, each one a symbol of Annatar\u2019s love, of his desire to adorn and protect. \u201cAnd what would you do then, my dear? If I were a Valar?\u201d\nAnnatar pressed his forehead against Celebrimbor\u2019s, his breath mingling with the elf\u2019s, his heart thundering in his chest. \u201cIf you were a Valar, if I could make you one, I would serve you as your most loyal Maia. I would follow you without question, without hesitation. There would be no desire for anything more than to be by your side.\u201d\nThere was something almost sad in his tone, a longing that Celebrimbor couldn\u2019t quite place. He opened his eyes and reached up, his hand gently cupping Annatar\u2019s cheek, forcing him to meet his gaze. \u201cYou would?\u201d he asked, his voice tender.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Annatar whispered, his eyes dark and serious. \u201cI would worship you like the very sun and stars. I would be yours, completely, without lies, without hesitation. You would never need to doubt my loyalty.\u201d\nCelebrimbor blinked, taken aback by the intensity in Annatar\u2019s eyes, by the raw sincerity in his words. He raised another hand, cupping Annatar\u2019s cheek, his thumb brushing over the Maia\u2019s cheekbone with a gentleness that seemed almost out of place in such a powerful hand. \u201cYou speak as though I am some ancient deity, Annatar, when I am but an elf. No more than that.\u201d\nAnnatar\u2019s heart ached at the simplicity of those words. \u201cIf the world were fair, you would be a Valar, and I would serve only you, as I do now.\u201d He placed another jewel, a diamond this time, near the crown of Celebrimbor\u2019s head, his fingers brushing against the silky strands with almost painful tenderness.\nCelebrimbor chuckled softly, one hand sliding down to rest against Annatar\u2019s chest, feeling the steady beat of his heart beneath his fingertips. \u201cBut would you not get jealous, my love? If other Maiar were to serve me as well?\u201d\nAnnatar froze for a moment, his fingers stilling as he considered the thought, a brief flash of possessiveness crossing his mind. \u201cI would be, I suppose,\u201d he admitted, leaning in to press a kiss to Celebrimbor\u2019s lips, soft and sweet. \u201cBut as long as I was the one to adorn you like this, to worship you as I do now, I think I could bear it.\u201d\nCelebrimbor\u2019s hand moved to cup the back of Annatar\u2019s neck, deepening the kiss for a moment before they pulled away, foreheads resting together. \u201cYou say the most beautiful things,\u201d he whispered, his eyes half-closed as he took in the Maia\u2019s words, the sincerity in his gaze.\n\u201cIt is easy, when I have you to inspire me,\u201d Annatar replied, his fingers resuming their work. He added another jewel, and then another, each one placed with care, each one a declaration of his devotion. \u201cYou have no idea how often I wish things were different. That you were\u2026 more?\u201d\n\u201cIs being an elf not enough for you?\u201dCelebrimbor asked, his eyebrows raising slightly, a hint of amusement in his eyes.\nAnnatar\u2019s gaze softened, his hand coming up to caress Celebrimbor\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou misunderstand me, love. You are more than enough. It\u2019s that the world doesn\u2019t deserve you as you are. If I could, I would elevate you to the heavens. You would be more than\u2026say\nMelkor\never was, in his prime. Beautiful, powerful, kind and just - everything he wasn\u2019t.\u201d\nHis voice dropped to a whisper, and he closed his eyes, as though the thought itself was too beautiful, too painful to bear. \u201cIf only\u2026 things were different.\u201d\nCelebrimbor was silent for a long moment, his eyes searching Annatar\u2019s face, his own heart aching at the unspoken sorrow in the Maia\u2019s voice. He knew there were things Annatar would not - could not - say, secrets he kept close to his chest, burdens he bore alone. But in this moment, Celebrimbor felt the weight of something unnameable between them, a shadow that lurked just beyond the reach of the sunlight.\nHe tilted Annatar\u2019s chin up, forcing the Maia to meet his gaze. \u201cWe cannot change what is, Annatar,\u201d he said gently, his voice steady and sure.\nAnnatar swallowed hard, his eyes shimmering with a depth of emotion that seemed almost too vast for his form to contain. He nodded, unable to speak, his throat tight, as he placed the last jewel in Celebrimbor\u2019s hair - a large, radiant star sapphire that sat in the center above his forehead, catching the light and refracting it in a dazzling array of colors. Annatar sat back, his eyes drinking in the sight of Celebrimbor, now adorned like some celestial being, a vision of light and dark.\n\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he breathed, his hand trembling slightly as he reached out to cup Celebrimbor\u2019s face, his thumb brushing gently over the curve of his cheek. \u201cMy beautiful, perfect Tyelpe.\u201d\nFor a moment, Celebrimbor saw the barest flicker of something in Annatar\u2019s eyes - a vulnerability, a longing so deep and raw that it took his breath away. He leaned forward, his hands sliding around Annatar\u2019s waist, pulling him close. \u201cAnd I am yours,\u201d he whispered, his lips brushing against the Maia\u2019s. \u201cWhether I am elf, Valar, or something in between. I am yours.\u201d\nAnnatar\u2019s breath hitched, his eyes closing as he leaned into Celebrimbor\u2019s embrace, his arms wrapping around him tightly. \u201cIf only that were enough,\u201d he murmured, the words barely audible, lost in the rustle of fabric.\nAnnatar closed his eyes, savoring the warmth, the gentleness. He wished, with every fiber of his being, that it could be enough. That he could be content with this, with just the two of them, without the weight of his plans and ambitions. But he knew it was a fleeting wish, a dream that could never last.\nBut for now, it was. For now, he could let himself believe in this, in the warmth of Celebrimbor\u2019s arms, in the sweetness of his kiss. For this moment, he allowed himself to believe in a future that could never be, in a reality where he could stay by Celebrimbor\u2019s side without fear, without deceit.\nHe would let himself imagine that they were more than what they were - two beings caught in a web of fate and deceit. He would pretend that they were just lovers, lost in a moment of peace and intimacy, without the shadow of what was to come hanging over them.\nFor this one afternoon, he was content to be here, in Celebrimbor\u2019s lap, placing stars in his hair and pretending that they could be happy. Even if it was all a lie, he would hold onto it for as long as he could.\nAnd maybe, just maybe, in that small, hidden part of his heart, he could believe that it wasn\u2019t entirely a lie. That there was some truth to the love he felt, to the devotion that shone in his eyes as he gazed at Celebrimbor.\nHe leaned in, pressing a kiss to Celebrimbor\u2019s forehead, just below the radiant sapphire, his lips lingering there. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered, the words a vow, a promise that he couldn\u2019t keep but wanted to more than anything. \u201cMore than you will ever know.\u201d\nHe could pretend, for just another moment, that there was no shadow on the horizon, that they could stay like this forever, wrapped in each other\u2019s light - that for this one, brief moment, everything was perfect."

        "writing_prompt": "Annatar, the master of deception, finds himself tangled in a life he never expected\u2014waking up each morning in the arms of Celebrimbor, the elf he\u2019s come to love. How long can he balance the warmth of this newfound peace with the shadow of his true intentions?",
        "story": "The morning sun filtered softly through the windows of their shared chambers, casting a gentle golden glow over the room. The air was warm, the bedding luxurious, and Annatar was nestled comfortably beneath it, wrapped in the arms of his husband. He could feel Celebrimbor stirring beside him, and as much as he wanted to remain in the pleasant half-dream that held him, the warmth of the waking world was tugging at him, insisting he acknowledge the day.\nHere, in Eregion, mornings were far kinder than they had ever been before. There were no harsh commands from a mad Lord, no looming shadows or endless hours of grueling labor. No oppressive darkness, and the silence was neither filled with dread nor foreboding.\nHere, the mornings were filled with light, warmth, and the soft rustling of leaves outside their window. Here, there was Celebrimbor - gentle, patient, and steadfast. The thought alone made Annatar sigh contentedly as he felt Celebrimbor shift beside him.\nA gentle pressure against his cheek made him stir at last, his lips curving into a small smile even before he opened his eyes. Another kiss, then another, soft as the touch of a breeze. Annatar remained still, letting the sensation wash over him.\nHe let out a quiet hum of pleasure as another kiss landed, this time on his cheek, and another, traveling down toward his jaw. It was a ritual Celebrimbor often indulged in when he thought Annatar was still asleep, lavishing him with affection as if he couldn\u2019t help himself.\nIt was a far cry from the mornings Mairon had known, and the contrast only deepened the sense of comfort Annatar felt. In Angband, mornings had been cruel. Cold reminders of the endless demands of his lord, the relentless pursuit of power, and the ever-present danger of what failure might bring.\nAnnatar allowed himself a moment to simply breathe, to take in the peace of this morning. In Angband, there had been no such luxuries - no soft beds, no quiet mornings with a lover beside him. Morgoth had demanded obedience, demanded perfection, and Mairon had given it, if only to survive. He had crafted, schemed, and built empires - only for it all crumble in the end.\nBut Celebrimbor didn\u2019t need to know any of that. He didn\u2019t need to know the depths of Annatar\u2019s past, or the darkness that lingered in his heart. He only needed to know that Annatar was here, in this moment, thoroughly enjoying every bit of attention he lavished upon him.\nAnnatar shifted slightly, cracking his eyes open to catch a glimpse of his husband\u2019s face - so full of affection, so content in this peaceful moment. It was an image he wanted to savor. He let his eye close again, burying himself deeper into the blankets and into Celebrimbor's embrace.\n\"Are you still asleep, or are you simply enjoying being spoiled?\" Celebrimbor's voice was soft, teasing, as yet another kiss brushed against Annatar's skin, this time at the corner of his mouth.\nAnnatar let out a low chuckle, still not fully opening his eyes. \"Do I need to choose?\" he murmured, his voice a little rough with sleep, but undeniably pleased.\nCelebrimbor laughed quietly, his hand moving to stroke Annatar\u2019s hair in slow, gentle motions. \"You\u2019re spoiled enough as it is,\" he said affectionately. \"But I suppose I\u2019m to blame for that.\"\n\"You are,\" Annatar agreed, his lips curling into a smirk even as he kept his eyes closed. \"But I won't complain. Mornings like these are infinitely preferable to what I once knew.\"\nThere was a pause, and Annatar regretted letting the comment slip. Celebrimbor's hand stilled in his hair, and Annatar could feel the slight tension that came with his husband's curiosity. But Annatar was quick, and before Celebrimbor could ask any questions, he tilted his head slightly, nuzzling into his touch.\n\"All you need to know, love,\" Annatar murmured, his voice low and tender, \"is that I thoroughly enjoy waking up like this. With you.\"\nThe tension melted away almost instantly, and Celebrimbor\u2019s hand resumed its gentle caress through Annatar's dark hair. \"As you should,\" he replied, leaning down to press another kiss to his forehead. \"One day, you\u2019ll tell me what that comment meant.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" Annatar conceded, his smirk softening into a genuine smile as he allowed himself to relax fully again. \"But not today. Today, I think I deserve a little more indulgence, don\u2019t you too?\"\nCelebrimbor sighed, but it was full of fondness. \"You\u2019re incorrigible,\" he muttered, though his tone was nothing but affectionate.\nAnnatar hummed in agreement, shifting slightly to curl closer to Celebrimbor, feeling the warmth of his body against his own. He lifted a hand to trace the curve of Celebrimbor\u2019s jaw, his touch as soft as the kisses he had received earlier.\n\"Do you ever tire of this?\" Annatar asked, his voice a quiet murmur. \"Waking up just to indulge me?\"\nCelebrimbor smiled, shaking his head. \"Never,\" he said, without hesitation. \"I think I enjoy it as much as you do.\"\nAnnatar let out a soft hum of amusement, his fingers threading through Celebrimbor\u2019s dark hair. \"I am a very lucky Maia,\" he said, his tone light but sincere. \"To have such a devoted husband.\"\nCelebrimbor\u2019s smile softened, and he leaned in to kiss him again, this time on the lips, slow and gentle. \"And I, a very lucky elf.\"\nFor a moment, Annatar\u2019s heart twisted, a fleeting reminder of the lie that lingered beneath his skin - the lie he had crafted so carefully, the persona he had built to make Celebrimbor trust him. He pushed it aside, buried it deep. There was no need to think of such things now.\nHe kissed Celebrimbor back, his hand slipping to rest at the small of his back. \"Then we might both be fortunate,\" Annatar whispered against his lips.\nThey stayed like that for a while longer, wrapped in the warmth of each other, the world outside forgotten. Annatar\u2019s past was a distant memory, a shadow that hovered at the edges of his mind but did not touch the present. Here, in this bed, in Celebrimbor\u2019s arms, he could pretend that this was all there was - that this peace, this love, was everything.\nHe knew it wouldn\u2019t last forever. One day, his plans would come to fruition, and the peace would shatter. But for now, in the morning light, with the elf he had come to love so deeply, Annatar allowed himself the luxury of forgetting what the future held - the luxury of feeling something he hadn\u2019t allowed himself to feel in a long time.\nContentment."

        "writing_prompt": "In the quiet of Valinor, Celebrimbor dreams of Annatar\u2014his betrayer, his beloved. The Valar attempt to guide him toward healing, but how do you let go of a love that was both your greatest joy and deepest ruin?",
        "story": "Celebrimbor turned away from Nienna\u2019s touch, curling into himself on the bed at last, as if he could shut out the weight of their sorrow. His mind, exhausted from endless cycles of grief and confusion, finally surrendered to sleep - deep and dreamless at first, mercifully void of the torment that usually awaited him.\nBut then, slowly, a golden light filled the room.\nWhen he opened his eyes, a familiar warmth washed over him. His heart stirred, a flicker of recognition sparking in his chest.\nAnnatar.\nHe blinked, sitting up as he took in the sight before him. No one else was there - no Nienna, no Irmo, no Est\u00eb. Only him.\nOnly\nAnnatar.\nHis beloved, the one who had once filled his life with warmth, even if that warmth had ultimately burned him.\nIt was too good to be true, yet that was exactly how it had always been with Annatar. Too perfect, too radiant, too intoxicatingly beautiful. But here he was, standing by the bedside, his golden eyes shining with that same soft glow Celebrimbor had come to associate with love, with comfort, with devotion.\nAnd for a brief, fleeting moment, Celebrimbor allowed himself to believe it was real. To believe that his Annatar had come back to him, that the torment of the past had somehow been washed away.\nAnnatar moved closer, his hand reaching out to cup Celebrimbor\u2019s face, just as he had done so many times before. That familiar touch, that warmth\u2026 Celebrimbor\u2019s heart clenched with longing.\nBut before he could speak, Annatar\u2019s mouth opened, and the words that spilled from his lips were ice.\n\u201cListen, Tyelpe,\u201d he said, and the tone - it was\nwrong\n, cold and sharp, laced with a cruelty that sent a chill down Celebrimbor\u2019s spine. Not the warmth of Annatar, but the venom of Sauron. \u201cIt was all a lie. Everything. You were never cherished. You were never loved. You were nothing but a tool. You were always just something to be used.\u201d\nCelebrimbor blinked, the words felt\u2026\nwrong.\nNot just the words, but the way they were spoken. The tone, the phrasing - it was all wrong. Annatar, even at his most cruel, had never spoken to him like this. Even when he revealed his true nature, when the mask of the golden Maia fell away, he had never been this\u2026 detached.\nCelebrimbor didn\u2019t flinch. He didn\u2019t recoil. Instead, a dry, humorless laugh escaped his lips, almost involuntary, as if some part of him had grown tired of this charade. He looked into Annatar\u2019s eyes - those golden, familiar eyes - and now saw the cracks in the illusion.\nAnother humorless laugh escaped his lips before he could stop it. He shook his head slightly, feeling the weight of the dream fall away, like an illusion dissolving before his eyes.\n\u201cThat\u2018s not him, Lord Irmo,\u201dhe murmured, barely loud enough for the Valar, who he knew must be watching from beyond the dream, to hear.\nAnnatar\u2019s expression shifted, a flash of surprise flickering across his face. It was so vivid, so accurate to the way Annatar had looked at him in life, that it almost made Celebrimbor falter. But he pressed on.\nHe reached out, grabbing Annatar\u2019s wrist with a gentleness that surprised even him. He pulled him closer, their faces now mere inches apart. The golden light flickered in Annatar\u2019s eyes, but Celebrimbor\u2019s gaze remained steady, unyielding.\n\u201cListen, Annatar,\u201d he said, his voice low, steady. \u201cI love you. I\u2019ve loved you from the very start. Even if most of it was lies, you can\u2019t deny that some of it was real. I\u2019ve seen you -\ntruly\nseen you. Like you\u2019ve seen me. I will never unsee you.\u201d\nThe words hung between them, heavy with a bittersweet finality. And there was a flicker of something - something almost startled - in the Maia\u2019s eyes. His expression faltered for a brief second, as if caught off guard by the words. The illusion held, but barely. And in that moment, Celebrimbor\u2019s heart softened, even in the midst of the dream.\nHe pulled Annatar into an embrace, wrapping his arms around him and burying his face into the familiar warmth of his shoulder.\nIt was the closest thing to relief he had felt in what seemed like an eternity.\nEven if this was a dream, even if it was a lie, it felt real enough. Real enough to bring some comfort, some fleeting sense of peace.\nAt last, the dream dissolved, and Celebrimbor woke again, blinking in the soft morning light of Valinor. He almost grumbled in irritation, the soft embrace of the dream slipping away as reality set in.\nFor a brief, fleeting moment, he felt the warmth of Annatar\u2019s embrace linger around him like a ghost. He hadn\u2019t wanted to wake, not from this. Not from\nhim\n.\nThe light that had bathed the dream, the vivid sensation of Annatar\u2019s hand on his face, had been so real - so painfully, beautifully real - that for a few precious moments, he had believed it. He sighed, closing his eyes again, trying to hold onto that feeling just a little longer.\nThe sound of hushed voices finally reached his ears. Undoubtedly, Nienna, Irmo, and Est\u00eb were gathered near him, speaking quietly amongst themselves. Their voices were low, almost inaudible, but Celebrimbor caught fragments of the conversation.\n\u201c\u2026perhaps it was too much,\u201d Nienna was saying, her voice filled with concern.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was the right choice,\u201d Irmo was saying, his tone contemplative. \u201cIt may have brought him closer to the truth. Maybe it was progress\u2026\u201d\nEst\u00eb\u2019s face was calm, though her expression held a trace of pity as she responded, \u201cThe dream didn\u2019t shatter him, but I fear it only reinforced what he already believes. Is it progress if he still clings to that which harms him?\u201d\nCelebrimbor couldn\u2019t help but sigh. He shifted in the bed, sitting up slowly, and the movement caught the attention of the Valar. Nienna\u2019s sad eyes turned to him, her expression softening, while Irmo and Est\u00eb regarded him with a mixture of concern and curiosity.\n\u201cHow do you feel, Tyelpe?\u201d Nienna asked, her voice as gentle as ever.\nCelebrimbor ran a hand through his dark hair, the faintest traces of a smile on his lips - though it was more tired than anything else. \u201cHow do I feel?\u201d he repeated, his voice dry, hollow. \u201cI suppose that depends on what you were hoping for.\u201d\nIrmo stepped forward, his gaze serious yet patient. \u201cWe were hoping to guide you toward acceptance, Celebrimbor. To help you see the truth of what has happened, and to let go of what binds you.\u201d\nCelebrimbor snorted softly, shaking his head. \u201c\nAcceptance\n?\u201d he muttered under his breath, his voice laced with bitterness. \u201cWhat exactly am I meant to accept? That I was a fool? That I trusted someone who played me from the start? That everything I believed in was a lie? I\nknow\nthe truth.\u201d\nHe looked up then, meeting Irmo\u2019s gaze head-on. \u201cLord Irmo, you induced that dream,\u201d he continued, his voice hardening, \u201cYou tried to make Annatar cold, cruel. Tried to force me to see the darkness in him.\u201d\nIrmo nodded slowly. \u201cI wanted to help you confront the truth.\u201d\n\u201cTruth?\u201d Celebrimbor repeated, his lips twitching into a faint, bitter smile. \u201cAnd yet you got it wrong. He wouldn\u2019t have spoken like that. He wouldn\u2019t have used those words. You made him too cold. Too cruel. He wasn\u2019t always like that. Even at his worst\u2026 he knew me too well.\u201d\nThe silence that followed was heavy, thick with unspoken tension.\nTruth be told, Celebrimbor already knew what they feared. He had known for some time now.\nHe\nshould\nlet go. He\nshould\nheal. He should hate the one who had manipulated, used, and ultimately destroyed him. He should want to forget the lies, the betrayal, the darkness that had consumed him.\nHe didn\u2019t want to.\n\u201cI know who Annatar really is,\u201d Celebrimbor said, his voice barely above a whisper now. \u201cI know what he did to me. But I also know that no other could\u2019ve brought me where he did. I loved him for it. I still do.\u201d\nThat, more than anything, seemed to silence the Valar. They had heard this before, of course, but it never grew easier for them to understand. To hear Celebrimbor speak of love when the very one he loved had betrayed him so deeply.\nBut Celebrimbor knew, even Sauron\u2019s lies had threads of truth woven into them.\nHe had seen the surprise in Annatar\u2019s eyes when he pulled him close in the dream. That had been bittersweetly accurate.\nFor once, the dream had felt right. The expression, the flicker of genuine feeling behind those golden eyes -\nthat\nwas real. That was the Annatar he knew. The one who had adored him, even if it had been twisted by darker motives.\nNienna\u2019s tears had begun to flow again, her sorrow for him endless. Est\u00eb stood quietly, her expression unreadable, but there was no disappointment in her gaze - only quiet empathy. Irmo\u2019s face remained thoughtful, though he said nothing for a long while.\nI love you,\nhe had whispered to the illusion in his dream. And it hadn\u2019t felt like a lie.\nNow, sitting in the sterile reality of his chamber, the memory of the dream felt more like a gift than anything else. He didn\u2019t care if the Valar thought it a step backward.\nAfter a long pause, Irmo finally spoke again. \u201cIt is your choice, Tyelperinquar. But understand this - clinging to what was, to what\nyou believe\nwas real, may not bring you the peace you seek.\u201d\nCelebrimbor closed his eyes, exhaling slowly. He lay back in the bed, staring up at the ceiling. \u201cI don\u2019t seek peace,\u201d he said softly.\nNo, he didn\u2019t need peace. All he wanted was the memory of Annatar, of the golden light, of the lies that had felt so achingly real.\nEst\u00eb\u2019s expression softened, no longer tinged with disappointment, but with something like understanding. Irmo, however, remained quiet, his gaze thoughtful, as if he was weighing Celebrimbor\u2019s words carefully.\nEst\u00eb finally spoke now. \u201cYou still believe that some part of him truly cared for you?\u201d Her voice was soft, almost as if she had begun to understand his feelings.\n\u201cI\nknow\nhe did,\u201d Celebrimbor replied, his tone unwavering."
