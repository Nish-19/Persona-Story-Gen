        "story": "-8-\nLove or Money.\n-8-\nNaomi was studying Darlene sympathetically as they walked towards the police station. \"Are you okay, Darlene? You're very quiet.\"\nDarlene spared her a smile, but it didn't reach her eyes. Something the DS noted instantly. \"No,\" she sighed, \"I was just thinking about the case yesterday.\"\nNaomi sighed herself. The last case they'd worked on involving Ellis Baxter and his cryptocurrency mining rig had been a complicated one. Ellis's body had been found without the insulating gloves to protect himself outside an electrical substation that Baxter had tapped to collect the power needed to make the rig, basically, a super-computer, mine the cryptocurrency, a get-rich-quick scheme organised by Ellis and Ivan McQuillan (Naomi was a smart girl, but finance and things to do with cryptocurrency were beyond her comprehension), make a fortune out of thin air, had blown after the girl he had seen behind his girlfriend's - Petra McQuillan, Ivan's daughter - back.\nLaurette Duschamps was the murderer, a girl Darlene had known years ago. Laurette had tried to use her past relationship with Darlene to her advantage, and it had nearly succeeded - but the Inspector had reviewed the hard drive that Ellis had stored the cryptocurrency on, and found out Laurette had stupidly transferred the money to an account in her name from the wallet. Even more stupidly, she had given it to the police to throw them off.\n\"Darlene, it wasn't your fault. You've done nothing wrong,\" Naomi said quietly.\n\"That's what Inspector Parker says,\" Darlene looked down sadly, \"he says my empathy is my greatest strength.\"\n\"He's right. Listen if you are talking about misjudging someone, look at me,\" Naomi said, and Darlene looked into her friend's face, surprised by this sudden turn, \"I spent years believing my best friend back home on St. Barnabus had been burnt by her stupid, drunk mother\u2026only to discover her father had set the whole thing up, without bothering to look for another way of getting rid of her, and nearly burning Monique to death.\"\nDarlene remembered the case well. A part of her believed Mr Hayes had gotten what he deserved, even if she didn't like thinking that way.\n\"How did you cope with it?\"\n\"Not a lot of choice; it was worse for Sammy than it was for me, he had to apologise to Odette and Monique, and that hurt him a lot,\" Naomi sighed, thinking about her old friend and mentor, who had taught her and helped her so much, but there had been times when he had condescended her, treated her like a kid.\nSammy had left St. Barnabas and was now travelling the world. But he would never forget how the community had pushed him, pressured him to get rid of Odette, for writing that report and clear Rex Hayes even if he wasn't under suspicion.\n\"I was only a kid at the time. I just went along with the flow when I knew full well he had gone home and got Monique away from the fire. But I had spent 15 years of my life remembering her bitterly, hating her for nearly burning her child to death. But my memories of her, despite something being out of it with the booze, showed a kind-hearted, loving woman. Looking back, I should have asked questions, but I never thought about it.\"\n\"You were just being human, honey,\" Darlene told her friend gently, \"you were not to blame; you were becoming a police officer, and you were focusing on your career; there's no doubt in my head if Odette had shown up, you would have asked questions.\"\nNaomi smiled and nodded, but she was remembering the last time she had spoken to her best friend. Monique and her mother were taking it easy, especially since Odette's own sister had murdered the man who had grown closer to her, and had been a replacement mother to Monique.\nSeeing the scale of Hayes' lies which had torn the family apart\u2026it had broken her heart because she had seen the way it had hurt Monique.\n\"Darlene, while it's similar, you didn't know Laurette had murdered someone.\"\n\"But I should have been more objective,\" Darlene looked away. \"You didn't know her parents; they were self-serving criminals, they only cared for themselves. Marlon only stole to put food on the table and support his little sister and give his mother some help, but what they did took it too far.\"\n\"Then she was worse than they were; she acted like a con artist, Darlene; she showed a side to her that said she was better than her parents, but she was worse than they were. Okay, maybe she hated her parents for what they'd done over the years, but she clearly took after them because she had grown up thinking it was normal. Who knows what she was planning to do at the Hub before she learnt about the cryptocurrency rig? Maybe she planned to use the Hub for something else; we'd need to find that out for ourselves soon. But, anyway, I don't think anybody else who believed in her would be in the quagmire you're in now, Darlene. You're one of the kindest people I know, it wasn't your fault. You were a massive help during the investigation; if you were protesting about her involvement in the case, then you would have slowed us down, but it never happened.\"\nNaomi sighed, knowing Darlene would be like this for a while, so she hugged the older woman gently. \"Just\u2026learn from this. That's all you can do; we all make mistakes, and make misjudgements.\"\nDarlene smiled back, \"Thanks, Naomi,\" Darlene said gratefully.\n\"Of course, you're my friend, it's my job,\" Naomi smiled."

        "story": "-8-\nHe got burned.\n-8-\n\"Why was everyone surprised by the Inspector's ex?\" J.P. asked Marlon while he watched as his younger friend sorted out his belongings, deciding what to keep and take with him to his new posting in Jamaica while he went to look after his little sister, Jocelyn. Marlon's mother had been upset both of her children were going, but she had become proud of the man her son had become, and she promised to send him some cash to see him through, ignoring Marlon's protests and promises everything would be okay.\nMothers were like that.\nMarlon had been wondering when his old friend would ask a question about that. He and J.P had been chatting about little things, like how things had been going with Rosie and the twins, his hopes for a relationship with Naomi at some point, and what it was like in Jamaica in general but Marlon had expected a question about the Inspector's personal life, especially since Naomi and Darlene were both shocked.\n\"Okay, so get this, recently the Inspector started a blog; DS Bordey suggested he write on during a recent call. I wasn't sure it would take off, but he started writing short stories about the various cases he's worked on, and what he pieced together from the case files of the past cases after he'd asked the Commissioner's permission, but he filled the blog with product reviews about the various things he uses. You know the Inspector, J.P.,\" Marlon said as he sorted through some shirts.\n\"I think I've got a general idea, Marlon,\" J.P nodded, remembering how Inspector Parker had driven him, DS Dumont, Ruby, and DS Cassell crazy with his mosquito sprays. \"Anyway what happened?\"\n\"Well, recently the Inspector's blog got liked by this fan, called Sunset Chaser.\"\n\"And Sunset Chaser turned out to be an old flame?\" J.P shook his head. \"Why did he look startled and looked like his world had exploded inward, then?\"\nMarlon looked down for a second, choosing his words as carefully as he could. \"He got burned, J.P. During the Christmas before last, he was already reeling from DS Cassell just left.. leaving after having a crush on her,\" he said.\nJ.P had known about the crush, and he could well understand how the Inspector felt. \"Go on.\"\nMarlon turned to face him, \"Okay, so, listen, he met an English girl called Sophie, she was here posing as a tourist.\"\n\"What do you mean, posing?\" J.P asked, worriedly.\n\"Sophie was the sister of a woman the Inspector locked up, and committed suicide in prison,\" Marlon replied grimly as he remembered those shocking days when the Inspector's own DC and girlfriend showed they were liars. \"Her real name was Rebecca Walmslow, and she came to Saint Marie to get revenge. She murdered someone in a case we considered a suspect, but we didn't have the evidence to arrest him. Anyway, we and the Inspector worked it out at roughly the same time, without the help of the Internal Affairs inspector who came out here. She'd only come out here to arrest the Inspector, and she didn't care about at least trying to do more. There were so many red flags springing up during the case, but she ignored them, all she was interested in was arresting DI Parker, but she gave us some time to at least try to clear his name; you should have seen the Commissioner himself putting her down after she'd read the Inspector his rights. But anyway, we arrested Sophie, and cleared the Inspector's name, but it shattered him, and it's taken him a while to get back on his feet; we were even wondering if he would decide to leave Saint Marie.\"\nJ.P had been silently listening to the story for the last few minutes in growing horror, picturing some of it in his mind. \"What happened afterwards?\" He whispered.\nMarlon sighed, \"What do you think? The Inspector was never really the same afterwards; whenever he saw or heard someone having a successful date, or talking about a relationship, he would go silent, and he would be upset. He stayed, of course, but he's been worried about relationships since, and I can't blame him. A few of us have tried to encourage him to move on, and find someone, but he's been reluctant. But with this Zoe girl, I dunno\u2026 when he got a fan on his blog, he was suspicious of her when she showed a lot of interest, and I only hope it doesn't lead to another disappointment. He barely managed to get out of the last one okay. But like I said, me, Darlene, and Naomi, we all wondered if the Inspector would leave Saint Marie, but luckily he hasn't.\"\nJ.P thought he was being a bit pessimistic, but he hadn't been on Saint Marie for a couple of years, and he had only had sporadic contact with Marlon since he'd left to take up his opportunity in Jamaica. \"How badly was he suspicious?\" he asked quietly.\n\"He thought it might have been Rebecca Walmslow; he asked the Commissioner to check to make sure she wasn't taunting him from prison, even if she wasn't supposed to have unsupervised internet access,\" Marlon said as he went back to packing.\nWhile J.P could well understand DI Parker's point of view he thought it was a little paranoid.\n\"And only a couple of days ago, Darlene scolded him for being demanding about her giving him some pictures of herself,\" Marlon went on.\nJ.P flinched. \"Wow, that does sound paranoid.\"\n\"I know, but you can't blame him, I guess. I only hope this goes well for him, J.P,\" Marlon said.\nJ.P nodded slowly in agreement, knowing from his own experiences that romance was a tricky thing."

        "story": "-8-\nShe was cold, she was just so cold; she had been in the Upside Down for only a few minutes since she had beaten the Demogorgon by ripping it to very, very small pieces, and yet she had found a way out. Eleven stood in front of it, and she studied it. She saw it was small, far too small.\nTaking a deep breath, Eleven held out a hand, and she pictured the crack in front of her widening, becoming larger and larger\u2026opening it to give her the room to crawl out.\nShe flinched a little in pain, feeling the sensations in her mind before she finally succeeded in widening the hole. Eleven forced her way through and looked around curiously.\nShe had expected to find herself still at the school, at the same time she had left, but instead, she was in broad daylight and there was a brick wall in front of her, and the hole leading into the Upside Down was another brick wall.\nHearing the sounds of cheering, she walked down the sides of the two brick walls, and she came to a street, her view of it blocked by lines of cheering people, who were laughing and yelling so incoherently that Eleven wondered if they were speaking differently. Eleven found a small gap in the crowd and found a moving line of men wearing dark uniforms with red shirts. She stiffened when she saw they were carrying guns, but Eleven relaxed when she realised they were not looking for her, she still studied them closely while making sure she wasn't swept away from the gate.\nShe looked around, realising this wasn't Hawkins; the buildings were too close together, and nothing like the wider spaces she was accustomed to. Dark banners lined with a strange red symbol were flying everywhere, but while Eleven was confused and worried she continued watching.\nA loud voice boomed over the crowd, startling her and making her scream, but it was drowned out by the crowd's cheers.\n\"Every day brings us closer to the future, and for so long it has been neglected. Our country has been sick. Our country needs healing,\" the voice boomed loudly, \"Norsefire will heal this country. Norsefire will ensure everyone gets work, live fairly, no longer will you be living on a pittance while undesirables get your money, and take the food out of your mouths. ENGLAND PREVAILS!\"\nWhile the puzzled Eleven was left wondering what Norsefire and England were, she winced and jumped, and nearly exploded with her powers at the amount of cheering, it was so loud. But she found herself increasingly nervous and not liking this, and she turned and walked back to the gate she had opened up. To her relief, nobody stopped her.\n-8-\nIt wouldn't be until much later, when Eleven had joined the Byers family in California, and she began studying history that she discovered the history of Nazi Germany.\nOne day, she brokered the subject to her family.\n\"Wait, you found another way out of the Upside Down, and it led to England, of all places?\" Jonathan said.\nEleven nodded. \"Yes. But it wasn't until recently I realised what that meant.\"\n\"And, you think you saw what looked like a Nazi demonstration there?\" Will asked.\n\"The way those men with guns were walking down the street reminded me of the history tapes in class, that and the banners, and the way someone boomed over a radio that something called Norsefire would ensure everyone would work, live fairly, and deal with undesirables was very similar,\" Eleven said, \"but from what I know, that sort of thing hasn't happened in England.\"\n\"No, it hasn't,\" Joyce glanced at her sons, making a mental note to try to speak to Murray if the paranoid idiot would pick up the phone. \"So what do you think happened?\"\n\"I think I travelled in time, although I don't know if what I saw is what's going to happen.\"\n\"What?\" Joyce blinked in confusion.\nBut Will got her meaning. \"Oh, you mean it might be an alternative timeline that you saw, like that evil Hill Valley in Back to the Future 2.\"\nEl smiled fondly as she remembered that movie. She had been introduced to dozens of them recently since her arrival in California. \"It's possible, but what could make such a future?\"\nNobody could answer her question."

        "story": "Jesse glanced at Randolph, seeing that his older friend and mentor (was he going too far thinking that way?) staring at the oil-covered water and rocks with disgust and horror.\n\"I love my van, but I wish we didn't have to use gas,\" Randolph muttered.\nJesse knew how he felt; after seeing the way Willy's sister Luna was covered with oil, and she was very sick. While the orca was not in the best of condition, Jesse could tell she was a lot like her brother. Jesse only hoped that he and Luna spent more time together, just to see what she was like, and to see how similar she was to her brother.\nBut right now, he and Randolph were taking a break from helping Luna. The pair of them had spent a lot of time scavenging for the ingredients for an old Indian remedy Randolph had learnt as a child before giving the mixture to the sick orca. The poor thing had gratefully taken it, sensing the sincere desire to help.\nNow it was just a waiting game.\n\"I know,\" Jesse was quiet, but his voice carried; Randolph turned in the corner of his eye. \"It's weird, you see things like this, spills like this, and you think they're so far away. But here, I can smell it. And I hate it. It's worse than a gas station.\"\n\"It is. Do you know what oil is?\"\nJesse turned.\n\"It's old plants, animals that have been compressed, mixed with other chemicals. It's the same with coal. The people who harvest it refuse to look for anything better, and places like this cove, which are havens for nature, they suffer for it whenever a spillage happens.\"\nJesse bit his lip, remembering Nadine's tearful reaction. \"What's going to happen?\" He asked quietly. \"With the whales and the cove?\"\nRandolph looked tired.\n\"I don't know,\" he sighed. \"I don't trust that oil bastard. I hated working in the aquarium; Dial was a nasty piece of work, more concerned with money than anything else. Animals are going to be scrubbed and given antibiotics to help them recover from the effects of the oil. Many are dying, and some of them are barely holding on by threads. Luna is lucky, Jesse,\" Randolph said seriously, turning to face his younger friend, \"and I hope she recovers, but even an old Indian remedy is not a guarantee of success.\"\n\"I know,\" Jesse replied, although he was a little worried now.\nRandolph sagged a little, and sighed, \"It's not the reunion you would have wanted with Willy, and a chance to meet his pod, is it?\" He asked wryly.\n\"No. I mean, I did see them when I saw those guys putting a leak into his tank, and I realised one of the reasons why he refused to perform at the park; he wanted to be with his family and he knew of the threat against him, and I realised I could see them when I was on the boat and saw a few of the orcas in the sea. When I accidentally dropped my harmonica into the water, Willy actually dove down and got it,\" Jesse smiled an awed smile at his friend, who returned it with one of his own, \"but when I saw Luna on the beach\u2026,\" he shook his head. \"I only hope we can help them this time.\"\n\"Yeah, and not depend on the oil company; don't depend on their promises, Jesse. They mean nothing. All these bozos care about is profit; they'll be more likely to capture the pod survivors, and put them into captivity.\"\nJesse glanced sharply at him, but he conceded the argument. He was too tired to fight, and if he had to admit it to himself, he could actually see it happening."

        "writing_prompt": "You\u2019ve gone undercover as a nanny for the ruthless and paranoid drug lord Miranda Priestly, tasked with infiltrating her inner circle. But as you grow closer to her adoptive daughter, the line between duty and survival begins to blur.",
        "story": "-8-\nI'm a police officer, undercover, the dangers of being undercover.\nUndercover work was nothing glamorous, and nothing like what you saw in the movies; there were no secret meetings, well there were, but they were carefully planned out and conducted so as not to arouse suspicion. And working to get into Miranda Priestly's inner circle and not make the drug trafficker suspicious was not an easy task. Miranda had not reached the top of the food chain by being sloppy or careless; no, the woman was dangerously smart, vicious, and paranoid. She liked being two or three steps ahead of everyone else.\nIt was little wonder she had managed to beat the odds, and she had lasted this long. You only had to look into Miranda's face, see the hard, cold cast of it, and see she was not one to cross.\nFlorence had been aware of Miranda Priestly's reputation for a long time; before she worked with DI Goodman, she had some friends in Jamaica, who had struggled to arrest her. As the Commissioner had claimed, witnesses who came forward vanished, but what she didn't understand until she arrived in Jamaica was how Ottis Benjamin had gotten caught up with her in the first place, and more research for her role had yielded some details about that.\nOttis had been seen near Miranda's business and then her home, but why? Surely Ottis had learnt enough about Miranda's reputation to know she wasn't someone to play games with?\nWhen she had briefly met Ottis during the Gabriel Taylor murder case, Florence hadn't been impressed; to her, Ottis was a thug, and the mindless way he had threatened Gabriel proved that.\nOh, the knife might have intimidated people and would have worked out in his favour, but Ottis hadn't known that Gabriel was just as violent, except in a different way. Ottis was the kind of criminal who lacked the subtle approach most used, but Florence was surprised Miranda would go so far as to kill him.\nWhy?\nWhat was happening?\nWhat was going on?\nAt first, the Jamaican police had struggled to find the answers to their questions, but as she had discovered Ottis had been seen near Miranda before his death. There was evidence Miranda and her organisation were cleaning up the mess, but the undercover unit wanted to get to the bottom of it all, not just Ottis Benjamin's murder, but they wanted to close down Miranda's network and any other criminal organisation she controlled or had vested interests in. Florence could understand that, given how brutal and violent Miranda was, from what she had learnt about the woman's reputation.\nBut if you looked at her past, you could well understand and even sympathise with it. Miranda and her family had grown up in poverty, raised by a loving mother before Miranda had turned to crime, and then rose through the ranks and gained power through it, gradually building up her drug empire over the years.\nThanks to her intellect, Miranda had stopped dozens of police investigations, and been behind the disappearances of so many people who threatened to bring her down. That was one of the reasons why everyone was so surprised when they did more digging until they finally discovered the connection between Miranda Priestly and Ottis Benjamin. When witnesses vanished, they vanished, they were never seen again. Ever. They weren't left behind on public beaches.\nWhen Florence had learnt about the undercover job, where she would serve as a nanny to Miranda's adoptive daughter, Dolores, she had been excited, but she had been worried as well; she knew if she went for the job, her life would be in danger for a long time. If everything went well, then Florence's involvement in her arrest would go unnoticed. But sadly real life rarely worked that way; there was not a shred of doubt Miranda had corrupt police officers in her payroll, they would have the means to discover the operation and who had betrayed her suddenly, even if Florence didn't appear in court.\nNo matter what, someone was bound to talk, and when they did she would be looking over her shoulder in witness protection.\nThat scared her.\nShe didn't like the idea of being locked away from friends, and loved ones, for god knew how long, but she knew what the Commissioner was saying, especially after he drove her to where Patrice was murdered. This wasn't a decision to be taken lightly. Florence had done a lot of soul-searching before she decided to say yes.\nNow, all she had to do was make sure she could keep up the facade long enough so then Miranda wouldn't try to kill her."
