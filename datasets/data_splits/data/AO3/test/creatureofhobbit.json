        "writing_prompt": "In a post-apocalyptic world, Jonas wanders through a graveyard filled with familiar names, clinging to hope that somewhere, somehow, the people he\u2019s lost\u2014his best friend, his family, and Martha\u2014might still be alive.",
        "story": "Some were names of people Jonas had only known by sight, if at all; some, like Torben Woller, had been people he\u2019d met at occasions Charlotte Doppler or Ulrich Nielsen had organised and invited coworkers to as well as family friends, so he\u2019d known them to some extent. Others, like Aleksander Tiedemann, he had known well; Jonas paused by Aleksander\u2019s grave for a moment, thinking of old memories such as Aleksander helping Jonas and Bartosz with their homework when they were in primary school, and how he\u2019d appreciated the fact that Aleksander usually turned up to Bartosz\u2019s school events (although he understood better now why his father often hadn\u2019t, and regretted those moments of frustration he\u2019d felt when Michael hadn\u2019t attended events his friends\u2019 fathers had). There may well have been other graves of people Jonas had known well, but had just not come across them yet; if the recording of Claudia Tiedemann from September 2020 was to be believed, few people from Winden had survived the events of 27th June.\nThere was no grave for Bartosz, for Magnus, for Franziska; Elisabeth had explained through Silja that none of the three of them had ever been seen again after the apocalypse, described the hours she and Peter had spent searching for Franziska and Charlotte at the time. She had also explained that there had eventually come a time when the search for any survivors had stopped; Jonas didn\u2019t know whether the others had made it out of Winden 2020 before the apocalypse or if they still remained somewhere undiscovered in what was left of the town, although he held on to hope for the former. While Jonas and Bartosz had been on the outs at the time Jonas had been sent to 2052, Bartosz had been his best friend since they were in kindergarten; Jonas hoped that somewhere out there he had survived.\nGrandma Ines was here; apparently she died in December 2019, months earlier than the mass burials of 2020, yet her grave resembled those hurriedly put together after 27th June; Jonas could understand that Hannah may not have had the funds to have put together much of a funeral, but had she really had to arrange a grave that was at the opposite end of the graveyard from Michael\u2019s? Jonas remembered that she had ripped Ines out of the family photograph for reasons he didn\u2019t feel he understood at the time; this smacked of Hannah\u2019s final act of revenge against Ines. Admittedly, he\u2019d been angry with Ines himself after having realised that Ines had known the truth about his father for who knew how long, but she was family, she should have been there. As for Hannah herself, Jonas still didn\u2019t know what had happened to her; there was no grave for her, no one seemed to know what had become of her following the apocalypse.\nJonas stood by the grave of Michael Kahnwald (he still struggled to think of his father as being Mikkel Nielsen); Michael had lain in this grave for 34 years, yet for Jonas it was only one year since he had got up that morning to find his father dead. As he laid the old family photo on top of his father\u2019s grave, thought back to the days when they had all been a family together and time travel was nothing more to him than a TV show plot, he wished he still had the piece that had contained Ines, so that they could have been a family again.\nLastly, Jonas approached the grave of Martha, who according to the date on her gravestone had also died on 27th June 2020. His older self had said that the future already existed and therefore there was nothing he could do to change the timeline back when Mikkel first went missing, and at this point there appeared to be no way for him to escape 2053 anyway. All looked futile, yet Jonas had not given up hope that there could be some way that Martha could be saved."

        "writing_prompt": "Trapped in the afterlife at your old high school, you and the other ghosts have spent years trying to figure out how to cross over. But when one of you finally escapes, it stirs up old resentments, impossible dreams, and a dangerous temptation to break the rules.",
        "story": "They\u2019ve all talked about it enough times over the years, and as the longest serving member of the Split River High Afterlife Support Group, Rhonda\u2019s sat through more of these discussions than any of them. After Maddie had finally managed to communicate to those friends of hers, Simon, Nicole, Xavier and Claire, that Janet had stolen her body, and they\u2019d all set off on the road trip to bring her back, Maddie had started the conversation again, only this time with a difference.\nBefore, when they\u2019d talked about the places they\u2019d missed, where they would go if they got the chance to leave Split River High, it had always been a hypothetical conversation. Wally had reminisced about the tree he\u2019d fallen out of at his grandparents\u2019 place and broken his arm when he was about six years old, how he\u2019d always given the tree dirty looks every time he saw it when he visited them since, but how he actually wouldn\u2019t mind seeing it again now. Janet used to talk about how she\u2019d like to see her home again; Charley had asked once wouldn\u2019t she find it weird seeing it again with strangers living there, and she\u2019d shut him down. There hadn\u2019t been the opportunity for Rhonda to ask Janet whether she had tried going back to her old home while she was in Madison\u2019s body, but Rhonda wondered now whether she had, and whether Charley had been right. As for Rhonda herself, there wasn\u2019t anywhere in Split River that she particularly gave a shit about ever seeing again. Certainly not home, with a father who was never there, probably banging his secretary, and a mother who was more interested in having a clean and tidy show house than actually being there for Rhonda. But if she did get the chance to go somewhere that wasn\u2019t the high school, she\u2019d quite like to go to Berkeley, where she should have gone had she lived.\nThey could talk about getting to see Niagara Falls, or vacationing on the beach in Aruba, all they liked, but they knew they were never going to get the chance to go anywhere other than good old Split River High. And then suddenly there was Maddie, talking about how something as trivial as going to the grocery store was going to have so much more meaning for her now that she\u2019d been trapped in the high school, and part of Rhonda was happy for her, but another part resented her for it, was struggling to stop herself from pointing out that she was telling this to a bunch of people who were never going to get that chance again and were still stuck in the same old high school.\nThey\u2019d all developed their own coping mechanisms; while most of them had been there for so long now that they were okay with being in the same room where they originally died, Rhonda remembered Charley taking a while to be able to bring himself to go into the dining room, and she\u2019d eventually caught on to the fact that Janet used to try and find out the dates of the fire drills ahead of time so she could get herself away from the rest of them and panic in peace (she also used to factor in the obligatory idiot senior setting off the alarm as a last day prank, but struggled with any other pranks, alarms set off by cigarettes, faults with the system causing an unexpected alarm). Rhonda herself had certainly avoided Manfredo\u2019s room for a while until it was refurbished into separate classrooms.\nOf course, there was still the possibility that she could cross over, but Rhonda was starting to have doubts about that as well. Martin, that asshole, had been stringing her along with his bullshit about being able to help her cross over, when he\u2019d been doing nothing of the kind, and Rhonda frankly doubted he even knew how to himself. After Dawn had crossed over, and the guys had started wondering whether looking back at their past was going to help them, rather than hinder as Martin always said, they had all been trying. So far, none of them had managed; Charley and Wally were still optimistic that they might get there, Rhonda less so. She wasn\u2019t going to lie, there was a part of her that quite enjoyed the idea of them all crossing over, while that asshole Martin remained trapped in the high school where he\u2019d tried to keep everyone else stuck with him so he wouldn\u2019t be alone, giving them duff advice to achieve that. Possibly a more fitting punishment for him than going to the other place, which she\u2019d also wondered about.\nOne time, she\u2019d asked Wally whether he would have ever considered doing what Janet did, possessing someone else\u2019s body so he\u2019d have the opportunity to be with Maddie in the physical world. He\u2019d immediately shut that down, saying Maddie had talked to him about how she felt about knowing that Janet had been possessing her body, and he knew that she wouldn\u2019t want to be with him in that way. Rhonda had immediately backed off, saying it was a joke, and started talking to Charley about something else. It wasn\u2019t something Rhonda actually intended to do, and she hadn\u2019t had the full facts when she\u2019d talked to Martin about him \u201cdoing for her what he did for Janet.\u201d But while she wasn\u2019t going to admit it to Wally, a part of her had wondered about the idea, about what it would be like to get the hell out of the school just once, even just for an hour.\nShe wouldn\u2019t do it; Maddie\u2019s path out of this shithole was in getting her body back, Rhonda\u2019s would be crossing over. She didn\u2019t know how, or when, but one day Rhonda would get there."

Now, he must uncover the secrets of a decades-old tragedy to help Maddie reclaim her stolen body.",
        "story": "As Simon walked away from Maddie, or at least what he had thought was Maddie before he\u2019d come to the conclusion that for the last few weeks he\u2019d been talking to something created by his imagination, he thought that in confronting her, in facing up to it, that would be the end of it. The video Nicole had sent him was clear enough; Maddie was alive, she was heading out of town without even bothering to tell him, her supposed best friend. He\u2019d been creating a version of Maddie in his mind, talking to her, even trying to solve her supposed murder, and Maddie had made the choice to cut him out of her life with no explanation.\nHe went home and called Nicole; they talked for a while about what that video of Maddie in Xavier\u2019s truck might mean, and speculated on why Maddie might have taken off like that but weren\u2019t able to come up with anything that made sense to them both. He called Claire to ask if there was any update on Xavier; Claire said that he wasn\u2019t awake yet and his asshole father had sent her away from the hospital, but she was going to go back the next day and would contact him if she heard any more.\nMaddie didn\u2019t appear to him. Simon didn\u2019t think anything of that; he thought he\u2019d put an end to the matter when he finally told that figment of his imagination goodbye, and he wasn\u2019t going to see her again. (Except maybe in the back of a police van, if anyone did successfully track her down; Simon was annoyed with himself that he still cared.)\nHe headed into school the next day, took his seat in Anderson\u2019s classroom and waited for the sub to arrive, then blinked in surprise at the sight of Maddie sat in her old chair.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not here!\u201d he snapped.\nClaire\u2019s friend Ava gave him a weird look; Nicole walked in and took the seat next to him, asking what he just said.\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s not here,\u201d Simon improvised. \u201cMy notebook. It\u2019s on my bedroom floor.\u201d Nicole seemed to buy that; Simon was determined to keep his focus on the lesson, ignoring Maddie sat at her desk, reaching out to him. When the class ended, he made sure he was first out of the door, ignoring the sound of Maddie\u2019s voice calling out to him, made his way to his next class without waiting for Nicole. Maddie wasn\u2019t there in his next class; Simon flashed back to a conversation they\u2019d had before about how he could only see Maddie in a room where someone had died, and figured that no one must have ever died in this classroom.\nStop being such an idiot,\nSimon told himself.\nThis isn\u2019t real.\nHe got through the rest of the school day, ditching lunch in the cafeteria so he wouldn\u2019t have another sighting of Maddie, headed home, took a call from Claire saying Xavier had woken up, but was still very groggy and it might be better to wait until the next day to stop by.\nMaddie didn\u2019t appear; Simon knew she wouldn\u2019t, because she wasn\u2019t real.\nThe weekend passed; Simon went round to Nicole\u2019s, Sunday they visited Xavier in hospital, where he was less groggy now but said he couldn\u2019t remember much about the accident and hadn\u2019t got a look at the driver of the truck. Simon and Nicole didn\u2019t show him the video; Claire had asked them to leave it for a bit, give Xavier a bit more time to recover before having that conversation with him. Simon was okay with that; he still wasn\u2019t sure if he should show it to anyone. He might have considered the police if he\u2019d had any confidence in how it would be handled; unfortunately, the sheriff was Xavier\u2019s father, who was an ass.\nMaddie didn\u2019t appear at the hospital. Why would she? She wasn\u2019t real.\nSimon headed into school on Monday morning, confident that after a couple of days with no Maddie manifestations, he\u2019d finally closed the door on it\u2026until he got as far as the football field for his first period gym class, only to see Maddie sitting on the bleachers.\nYou\u2019re not here,\nhe told himself as he tried to focus on class, looking anywhere but where Maddie was, trying to ignore her shouts.\n\u201cJanet Hamilton!\u201d Maddie was yelling. \u201cLook it up. Fire in the labs, 1958. That\u2019s who was driving the truck. That\u2019s who\u2019s stolen my body.\u201d\nHe wanted to dismiss it, yet at the same time, he was no longer sure; why would a figment of his imagination conjured up to help deal with his grief be shouting at him about someone he\u2019d never heard of? Wally Clark, sure; Simon could have come up with that name, since there was a stadium in the grounds named after that guy and Simon had seen it at every gym class since freshman year. And he thought he remembered some older kid, a friend of his cousin, telling him the legend of the girl who got murdered by her guidance counsellor; he didn\u2019t remember his cousin\u2019s friend mentioning her name, but it wasn\u2019t impossible he\u2019d said it was Rhonda. But Janet Hamilton, a fire in 1958, that meant nothing to him.\nThere wasn\u2019t going to be anything, Simon thought as he typed into Google. Just some stories about genealogy records, an amateur production of Hamilton starring Janet whoever, stupid shit that wasn\u2019t going to mean anything to him. But when Simon looked at the search results, the first hit that came up was a fire in the science lab at Split River High in 1958, claiming the lives of teacher Everett Martin (another name Maddie had mentioned to him before) and a pupil named Janet Hamilton. If the Maddie Simon had been seeing really was a figment of his imagination, how could she have given Simon this name and story that he\u2019d had no reason to know about, and then have the story turn out to be true?\nThat wasn\u2019t the only thing that had turned out to be true that Simon couldn\u2019t otherwise have known; he\u2019d have had no way of knowing about Anderson\u2019s fraud with the old band uniforms without Maddie, or that the number Anderson had called belonged to Claire (who Simon wasn\u2019t even really friends with at that point and didn\u2019t even have her number). And if she was really a construct of his imagination, why did she never appear when he was at home, or in town, or anywhere other than the high school? So, much as it sounded impossible, Simon had to admit to himself that Maddie must have been real, that she was telling the truth and that was this Janet character on that video driving the truck.\nFirst thing he was going to do when he got to school was find Maddie, and then start brainstorming about how he would track down this Janet. He\u2019d make it up to her; he\u2019d help her get her body back."

        "story": "He hadn\u2019t thought it through initially.\nA few years had gone by in between the lab fire which had caused Everett Martin and Janet Hamilton to become trapped in Split River High as ghosts and Rhonda becoming the first to join them; a few years in which Janet had been his only company, barely able to tolerate his presence, unable to forgive him for the accidental starting of the fire which had claimed both their lives.\nRhonda\u2019s presence had been a relief; finally, there was someone there who didn\u2019t know the history of the fire and was quite happy to accept a version of events where Everett\u2019s own negligence hadn\u2019t been to blame. Having someone else there broke the tension that had existed between himself and Janet, and as time went by, as they were joined by Dawn, by Wally, by Charley, it became easier still.\nYet Everett continued to fear a day when they would all cross over, leave Split River High behind, leave him trapped in this building where he had remained since 1958. So it had been easy, at least at first, to act as though he was helping them to cross over while having no intention of doing anything of the kind; he\u2019d been a teacher, part of the afterlife longer than any of them, the other ghosts had expected him to know what he was talking about and hadn\u2019t questioned him. (Janet had been the only one to ever call him on it, to ask him why, if he knew anything at all about how to cross over, he\u2019d never attempted it himself. But she\u2019d only ever said that to him when they were alone, never in front of others, so none of the other ghosts ever picked that up and asked the same question).\nThe truth was that Everett didn\u2019t want to face up to his own past, to admit that the fire had been caused as part of his own incompetence. Yes, there had been people who had said afterwards that it had been his fault, but the school had successfully hushed that up, trying to avoid the Hamiltons\u2019 lawsuit, and eventually the matter had died a death. It was accepted as an accident, Everett told any new ghosts that someone else had caused it any time the subject came up, and he was able to avoid thinking about it. Time went by, there was no one there who could contradict his version of events (well, except for Janet, but she had never publicly done so). But the other ghosts\u2026Everett had studied them all, knew the circumstances of all their deaths, and knew that it would be a lot easier for them to face their own pasts, that eventually they should have the means of crossing over.\nAnd he\u2019d got away with it for years; ghosts had come, but none had gone, Janet had never contradicted his story, Everett Martin remained safe. Then had come the day when Dawn had crossed over, having talked about the day of her death with Maddie, having heard Maddie say that she was a good friend. What had seemed an unobtainable ideal was now a reality; it was only a matter of time before the ghosts crossed over, left him behind. Charley already seemed on the right path with the letter he had dictated for Emilio, Wally too was starting to deal with his history with his family and football. And now Charley, Rhonda, Wally and Maddie were starting to look into him, to question him.\nThe day was coming; Everett knew he couldn\u2019t run from it any longer. It had started with Dawn, continued with Maddie Nears as she reclaimed her body, with the other ghosts losing their faith in him. They understood now that he had never been trying to help them cross over, they knew how to do it without him. He saw the ghosts, Charley, Rhonda, Wally, even Janet, crossing over, rushing straight at him as they did, letting him know what they thought of him and his lies. And Everett would be there, condemned to live out eternity in Split River High."

        "story": "Ethan was beginning to wonder if he was the only person who had realised it was nearly Christmas.\nMaybe it wasn\u2019t. Maybe it was like Narnia here, where it was always winter and never Christmas. But that couldn\u2019t be right; Victor had told him once that it was weird when the leaves started falling from the trees because they didn\u2019t usually do that. For Ethan, it was weirder that it had never happened before here; it happened every year in the outside world, everyone knew that.\n\u201cDo you think Mom and Dad remember it\u2019s nearly Christmas?\u201d he asked Julie at one point.\nJulie rolled her eyes. \u201cMom and Dad are so busy arguing right now that I\u2019m not sure they remember we even exist. Why do you think Kenny moved out? I\u2019m surprised no one\u2019s heard them in the outside world and sent a search party to find us.\u201d\nThat was true. But still, even if his parents hadn\u2019t remembered, maybe someone else did; Donna might remember, or Kenny, or Boyd. Maybe not Victor; he hadn\u2019t even marked his own birthday for years until Henry arrived in town and wanted to mark it with him. But someone had to have remembered. Ethan wondered how they celebrated it here. Did they do something in the diner, or in Colony House, or did everyone just celebrate it with their own families?\n\u201cWhat is there to even celebrate anyway?\u201d Julie asked when Ethan put this question to her. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck in this shithole, no friends, no grandparents, and you\u2019re sure not going to get a visit from Santa here.\u201d Actually, Ethan had caught on about Santa the previous year because he realised Santa used the same wrapping paper as his parents, but that wasn\u2019t the point. After everything that had happened, the town needed to do something to celebrate Christmas, to have just that one happy day.\nTurned out, it wasn\u2019t only his family who hadn\u2019t known it was Christmas. Bakta had arranged a grand reopening of the diner which most people were at, and Ethan thought that would be a good opportunity to ask how those who had been in the town for a Christmas before now usually celebrated.\n\u201cChristmas?\u201d Kenny had said. \u201cHuh. I hadn\u2019t even noticed.\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t face it last year,\u201d Kristi replied. \u201cThat was my first one here, without Mari.\u201d\n\u201cWho even gives a shit?\u201d Randall snorted.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s Christmas!\u201d Ethan exclaimed. \u201cChristmas is important. We have to do something. Boyd, Donna, you\u2019ve been here the longest. What do you usually do?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Christmas is important?\u201d Boyd rounded on Ethan. \u201cWe just lost four people in this last week. I\u2019ve been trying to keep everyone alive, working together, instead I\u2019ve got people not letting me do that, turning on each other, trying to do their own thing. And I\u2019m trying to hold my family together. I\u2019ve been trying to find a way of getting us all home, and finally I thought there was some hope of that, but we\u2019re still just as trapped here with those things. And Christmas is important?\u201d\n\u201cHey, back up there,\u201d Jim interrupted, taking a step right up close towards Boyd\u2019s face. \u201cWho the hell said you could talk to my kid like that?\u201d\n\u201cOkay, maybe we should all just take a few seconds to calm down here,\u201d Kenny said as he hurriedly stepped between the two, Jade coming to his aid to hold Jim back. But Ethan saw none of this, because he had already turned to run out of the door.\n\u201cI was a bit harsh on him there, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d Boyd asked.\n\u201cWe all know what you\u2019ve done for us, and we\u2019re all grateful,\u201d Kenny began, \u201cbut none of what\u2019s happened was Ethan\u2019s fault. He maybe didn\u2019t pick the best moment to bring it up, but he\u2019s a kid. At Ethan\u2019s age, Christmas is a big deal.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, the reason I asked Kenny about reopening the diner in the first place was to try and boost all our morale,\u201d Bakta pointed out, \u201cand this sounds like the kind of thing I had in mind. I\u2019m going to open this place to the whole town on Christmas Day. Donna, can I count on Colony House, want to give me a hand?\u201d\n\u201cWhen I was looking at the stuff in the basement and found the camera, I\u2019m sure I saw a box of Christmas decorations,\u201d Elgin put in. \u201cI\u2019ll go look again and if I find them, I\u2019ll bring them over and decorate the place for you.\u201d\n\u201cThen I guess it\u2019s settled,\u201d Boyd replied. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a Christmas.\u201d\nEthan didn\u2019t know why Julie was so insistent on going over to the diner that morning. Usually, she wouldn\u2019t even have been out of bed for at least another two hours. And he hadn\u2019t a clue where either of their parents were; still, at least they hadn\u2019t woken him up arguing again.\n\u201cWhy did you want to come here?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d Julie replied as she pushed open the door.\n\u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d\nEthan glanced around to see what he thought must be everyone from the town; Kristi and Marielle, Henry and Victor, Elgin and Randall, and there was his mother.\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t the only person who wanted a Christmas,\u201d Henry explained, gesturing towards Victor. \u201cI\u2019ve missed so many Christmases with my son. I\u2019m not going to miss out on the first chance we get to spend Christmas together in years.\u201d\n\u201cDoes this look straight to you?\u201d Elgin asked from the top of a stepladder, Randall holding it steady, as he fixed the corner of a Merry Christmas banner to the wall.\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re good,\u201d Randall replied.\n\u201cThere, that\u2019s the last one.\u201d Elgin jumped down from the ladder. \u201cWho knew that Colony House would hold this many Christmas decorations? Even if that banner does say Happy New Year 1979.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you could have left that one,\u201d Randall laughed.\nKenny and Jade walked in, carrying big crates of the fresh vegetables towards the kitchen, where Bakta and Donna were preparing a delicious-smelling roast dinner. \u201cWhere do you want these?\u201d Kenny asked.\n\u201cJust over there,\u201d Bakta gestured towards a worktop before fiddling with the oven controls.\n\u201cYou do realise it\u2019ll be bread and water for the next month to make up for this, right, kid?\u201d Donna said, but Ethan saw the smile at the corners of her mouth.\n\u201cHere, let me give you a hand with that,\u201d Jade had put his crate down where Bakta indicated, and stepped over to help Jim, who had just walked in through the door with a heavy box.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in that?\u201d Ethan asked.\n\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d Jim smiled. \u201cThis is from the bar.\u201d\nAs Ethan took a seat next to his mother, Boyd broke away from his conversation with Ellis to approach him. \u201cHey, Ethan. I\u2019m sorry I snapped at you before. You were right, we all needed this, and I should have listened to you instead of dismissing the idea.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Ethan replied. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\nAs Boyd turned to head back to Ellis, Ethan called out to him again. \u201cHey, Boyd?\u201d\nBoyd turned back around.\n\u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d\n\u201cAre you glad we did this now after all?\u201d Kenny asked as he and Boyd sat down to their dinner with Jade, Ellis, Fatima, Kristi and Marielle.\nBoyd watched as Ethan chatted and laughed with Jim and Tabitha, as Julie started moving the chairs so Elgin and Randall could join their group, as Bakta and Donna finally took their seats among a big table from Colony House, as Victor saw Sara standing alone and called her over to join him and Henry at the table next to Ethan\u2019s.\n\u201cYeah, I think this has done us all good,\u201d he replied. \u201cAll this working together to give the kid as good a Christmas as we could, it was what we needed. It helped to give us all something else to focus on.\u201d\nOh, fuck.\nBoyd suddenly remembered where he had heard those words before, spoken by the one person who wasn\u2019t here.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute. Kristi, Marielle, don\u2019t let these guys help themselves to my pigs in blankets.\u201d He ran out of the diner, made his way towards the ambulance where Acosta had been sleeping, unable to face any of the others after the welcome she had previously received.\n\u201cHey, Acosta. So, we all just put together a Christmas celebration, and I realised you were right in what you said before, about us all needing something to focus on. I shouldn\u2019t have shut you down at the time. So come on, join us in the diner. There\u2019s plenty of food.\u201d\nAcosta looked awkward as she walked in the diner, but Bakta started preparing another plate of food, and Kenny immediately waved her over, said there was a spare seat next to him (where she sat with her back facing the big table from Colony House, who had been Nicki\u2019s friends).\nAs Boyd looked around at all his friends, he wondered if this would become the new tradition for the town. Maybe it would continue next year; maybe they would have found their way back home by then. But either way, whatever happened, Christmas wouldn\u2019t be just forgotten about again."
