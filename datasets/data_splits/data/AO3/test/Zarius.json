        "story": "Peter stood there, his hands in his pockets, waiting for Mary Jane to say something.\nHer hair had been tied back for the duration of breakfast, but now, with MJ fiercely undoing her head band, it was coming loose.\nThere she stood, her long scarlet locks flowing down,\n\u201cWhat do you expect from me Peter?\u201d she asked. Tapping her foot on the floor.\n\u201cAnger of the righteous variety. 100 percent\u201d Peter replied.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much that, it\u2019s just...I\u2019m five percent disappointed\u201d\nPeter raised an eyebrow, most curious.\n\u201cDisappointed always hurts\u201d he admitted.\n\u201cI mean, you could have come back with more than cuts and bruises\u201d she continued.\n\u201cOr not come back at all, you don\u2019t need to bring it up\u201d Peter said, trying to assert control of his own reprimanding, to take ownership of what he had done.\n\u201cYou just did\u201d MJ replied, her arms folded, she stared upward at the ceiling, then directed her looks to Peter, her expression shifted from a stern disciplinarian to lustful and loving.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the five percent comes from Tiger, five percent I can handle, and five percent I can mend\u201d\nMJ skilfully undid her belt buckle, and slid out of her jeans.\nShe walked over to Peter and wrapped her arms around him, gently pressing her lips to his nose and giving it a gentle peck. Her right hand brushed delicately against his bruised features.\n\u201cShow me the suit\u201d she said.\nPeter obliged, and conjured forth his outfit.\n\u201cHow does it look on me?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s... enterprising. You certainly \u2018arrive\u2019 with it, and when you leave, nobody will forget you were there, or what you did for them\u201d\n\u201cMayday picked out the design\u201d Peter said.\n\u201cBold girl\u201d MJ continued, already thinking of a place and time to spend with her daughter as a reward for lending her insight and creativity to her dad\u2019s cause.\n\u201cThis whole task ahead of me is bold MJ...I don\u2019t know what it is, but I feel there\u2019s untold millions of me out there, millions of worlds, where I give just a hundred percent, when I should be  giving it a thousand. I know I haven\u2019t left second or third gear yet, but when I shift gears, it has to be full on Turbo. I can\u2019t get across the track without someone waiting at the finish line. Be that for me MJ, help me race ahead\u201d\nMJ pricked his nose with a gentle tap of her fingertip before wrapping both arms around her shirt and tugged it over her head. She quickly unhooked her bra and stood before Peter wearing nothing but a black thong.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to take me out there, into the city, into the wild, I\u2019m going to feel the barren sky on my naked back, I\u2019m going to take in the sights, the sounds, the scents, the sensations of the day, and then you are going to carry me home...and after that, we\u2019re going for a run of a different sort...and, tiger, for my sake, you\u2019d\nbest not finish\n\u201d"

        "story": "Ruby Sunday, her story now on a different trajectory than that of her dear friend,  turned and made her graceful exit from the TARDIS, The Doctor stood with his back turned, staring at the console, his fingers etching ever closer to the master switch.\nOne flick and it would be all waiting for him. All of time, space, and adventure. His infinite calling.\nAnd as he took a moment to pause, the tears came flooding down once again.\nSurely they should have stopped by now. Evil had been averted. Chaos prevented, an empire had been reduced to ash and ruin, he had brought death to its own door, and life had prevailed.\nThe tears had plagued him for as long as he had been encountering the many splinters of Susan Triad, or felt the cold and sensitive touch of a snowflake brought about by a lively Ruby. Just why had he been in a highly emotional state?\nHe allowed himself the pause to reflect on what he believed to be the case, and what he believed in could not be entertained further, not if he wished to continue traversing creation and righting wrongs wherever he was needed.\nBut that was just it, everything he had been told to believe in all of his lives had proven to be misdirects and manipulations, and now the one thing he wasn\u2019t certain about was the intent of his ship.\nIt also tied back to what he had told Ruby when they first travelled together, that he had no job, no responsibility, that he had freedom, and yet, he had come to find the TARDIS had none, that it was at the beck and call, the manipulations and machinations, of another greater, stronger force that had bent it to its almighty will.\nHis mind drifted back to the days of the Eleventh, the encounter with the dark entity known as House, a predator of Time Lords, and his strange family, one of whom became the host body for what he believed to be the very essence of the TARDIS itself.\nIt had told him that she never took him to where he wanted to be, but where he was needed.\nMy god\n, thought The Doctor,\nWas that a warning? Or a lie? A trick? Or perhaps a means of conveying what was required of me along? To serve as a means by which to assert dominance and death across the fabric of the universe?\nWhat does he believe now?\nThe choice brought him to tears.\nFor the sake of preserving sanity in the universe, to bring comfort to civilisations, and joy to the world, he could not afford to invite any signs of doubt to intrude upon him, for doubt would bring disaster, and too many had seen that from him, and too many hearts had been broken trying to shield them from it too.\nJust ask Susan.\nThe Doctor fought back the tears, he wondered if they would persist for as long as he was faced with this choice, perhaps it didn\u2019t matter any longer, perhaps it did, it wasn\u2019t just about him, but the soul of his chariot, pulled now by a force it could call its own, but The Doctor could tell it would be pained by each step it took onto a new world, perhaps it would malfunction more, perhaps it would be disloyal through more fault of its own.\nOr perhaps it would try to do better.\nFor The Doctor\u2019s sake, he would have to take its word for it\nBut who\u2019s word?\nThe word of Idris?\nOr the word of Sutekh?"
