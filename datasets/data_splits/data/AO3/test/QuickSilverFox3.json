        "writing_prompt": "In a quiet caf\u00e9 tucked away from the bustling streets, a retired Pok\u00e9mon champion tries to enjoy a moment of peace with his Arcanine, only to have his solitude interrupted by a familiar face\u2014and the memories of a love he thought he'd lost.",
        "story": "The cafe is crowded, not overtly so, but Cody still recalls his Arcanine to his ball before he ducks inside. The decoration is typical of most of the other\u2019s in this area, a few posters plastered over a noticeboard dominating one wall that catches Cody\u2019s eye before any of the other kitsch items can, and he\u2019s already ducking his head and turning away before he can fully register what he\u2019s seeing. There are only so many times that he can stand seeing his own face depicted in glorious technicolour, the scar that runs over his temple only included at his insistence, before he\u2019ll flee back to his apartment and refuse to leave it for another week. He had only wanted to complete his badges and make sure his Pokemon were happy, everything else is\nextra\n.\nCody tugs his cap down further over his face and turns towards one of the tables tucked away to the side. He catches Dex\u2019s eye as he goes, the owner peering over the glass top of the counter, his Machamp looming over his side and, for a moment, Dex\u2019s shadow possesses four arms settled on his hips. Dex waves one broad hand in greeting, his Machamp already beginning to make up a couple of dishes, and Cody returns the motion with a small salute before he returns his attention towards the table. He slides onto the seat facing away from the window, the imagined itch of eyes branded into the back of his neck already. Once he is situated, Cody thumbs the button of his Pokeball, careful to keep the ball down by his side before returning it to his bag. His Arcanine yawns, his tongue lolling out of his mouth before he settles back on his haunches, expectantly. Cody reaches across to scratch behind his partner\u2019s ears, the Pokemon\u2019s tail knocking against the floor with low rhythmic thumps, before he leans against Cody\u2019s hand and settles back down onto the floor.\n\u201cCody!\u201d Dex crows as he bustles out from behind the counter, a stretch of plates splayed across one arm and a heavy mug clutched in his other hand. Steam billows from the mug and Cody\u2019s attention sticks to it, the distant memory of his morning cup already burning a hole in his stomach as it had been accompanied by very little else. He hadn\u2019t realised how hungry he was until this moment.\n\u201cDex,\u201d Cody answers, standing up to greet the other man properly once the plates had been distributed over the table. Dex\u2019s hugs were legendary like sinking into a warm bath with your belly full and a fire burning merrily in the fireplace. \u201cHow\u2019ve you been?\u201d\n\u201cBetter now that my favourite sponsor is here!\u201d Dex keeps his voice low but even that is loud enough for Cody to flinch, throwing his gaze towards the still-closed door.\nHe leans into Dex\u2019s hold, sneaking out one hand to fumble at one of the chips poking out of the basket. \u201cI\u2019m your only sponsor.\u201d Cody bites into the chip and near-enough moans. It\u2019s perfection, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and flavoured exactly how Cody likes them.\n\u201cThat you are,\u201d Dex chuckles, ruffling Cody\u2019s hair and finally releasing him. Cody\u2019s cheeks are flushed, embarrassment quick on the heels of any of his actions recently, but he still reaches for another chip, tucking himself back into his seat. Dex has also brought a bowl for his Arcanine, now sitting upright, his attention focused on that single spot, and he glances up at Cody, his paws clicking against the wood floor. Cody nods and at his signal, his Arcanine surges forwards, shoving his face into the bowl. His tail begins wagging again, impacting against the side of Cody\u2019s leg like a blow. He weathers it as best as he can, picking amongst the plates and setting a handful to one side. They weren\u2019t intended for him, after all.\nCody is about to reach for his phone, the phantom buzzing sensation now crawling over the back of his skull, when the door rings behind him, swinging open with a gust of frigid air that is only barely mitigated by the fire Pokemon at his side. He turns to inspect the person, initially a glance over his shoulder but he turns fully when he takes in the man pushing the door closed, his collar drawn up over his face. The Absol at his side shakes itself free of the lingering rain and pads over to Cody\u2019s table immediately, taking the most direct route by ducking beneath the tables and scrambling over one chair that had been left askew. Obi-Wan draws his scarf free, peeling the damp fabric away from his skin with a grimace and folds it on itself, draping it over his shoulder. His hair is dark with the rain, the colour diluted from auburn to a deep rich brown, and a small puddle forms at his feet, settling into the void of his shoes. He swipes a hand over his eyes, his gaze skimming over the handful of occupied tables before he settles onto Cody. Obi-Wan raises a hand in greeting, his grin immediate, and the gathered grey clouds and the ever-present gaze of the world didn\u2019t matter anymore.\nObi-Wan reaches him in a matter of moments, following the same pathway that his Absol did, and he leans down to hug Cody in the same moment. Cody\u2019s cap shifts to the side, exposing the scar wrapped across his temple, and Obi-Wan presses a kiss to it before Cody can begin to tense up. The ghost of his lips burns into Cody\u2019s skin as Obi-Wan adjusts his cap, pulling it back into place before he slides into his seat across from Cody. \u201cHello, love. Long time, no see.\u201d\n\u201cHi,\u201d Cody manages. His heart feels restricted, somehow too full and wrung empty at the same time. He doesn\u2019t brush his fingers across the aching spot on his temple, the space he somehow hopes bruises so he\u2019ll have some physical to tie this memory to. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d\nObi-Wan\u2019s smile shifts into something soft and sweet. He reaches out through the network of plates to twine his fingers through Cody\u2019s, his thumb working over the calluses on his palm. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you too. Let\u2019s not part again.\u201d"

        "writing_prompt": "Working the holiday rush at a bustling caf\u00e9, Obi-Wan finds himself distracted by his coworker Cody\u2019s festive charm, secret drink experiments, and the mistletoe hanging precariously above the counter.",
        "story": "The bell above the door chimes and Obi-Wan swallows back a groan along with the scaldingly sweet dregs of his drink. The limited edition syrups wash over his palette with all of the subtlety of the line woven around the scant handful of tables, expectant eyes locking onto Obi-Wan. It isn\u2019t too far away from how he watches Cody; a desperate clawing hunger that can only be blunted and never satiated, and Obi-Wan smiles at the next customer in the queue, an old ache beginning to burrow into his cheeks.\n\u201cWelcome! What can I get for you?\u201d\nIn the moments between, amongst the hissing rush of steam from the failing coffee machine and the whir of the grinder that makes its displeasure known each and every time it deigns to function, Obi-Wan watches Cody. His apron is neatly tied around his waist, the deep red of the festive accessories perfectly complimenting his dark eyes and hair, the golden wash of glitter streaked over his cheekbones, and his shirt has something emblazoned across it beneath his apron that Obi-Wan can just make out the shape of. A mug lands on the saucer in front of Obi-Wan, mismatched red to the delicate floral pattern emblazoned around the rim of the plate, and he blinks down at it, his thoughts disrupted and crashing into each other in one glorious pile-up. He has the large iced mocha already set to one side, just waiting the whipped cream and skin-staining sprinkles to adorn it, and the triple shot latte which barely passes muster but he knows the dead-eyed stare of the regular well enough by now and he can remember his own days as a student vividly so he doesn\u2019t argue, so what is the newest concoction that Cody had delivered to him? He glances up, raising his brows at Cody in a silent question.\n\u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d Cody calls, grinning widely over at Obi-Wan and his heart stutters to an expectant stop in his chest, restarting when Obi-Wan coughs, a flush overtaking his face, and he looks away. Cody continues, unperturbed. \u201cLet me know what you think.\u201d\nThere isn\u2019t much of a lull during the festive season, what would have been long stretches of time with minimal foot traffic and too many hours since his break and to quitting time at once are now disjointed and impossible to predict. The mug sits untouched until the current rush subsides, barely enough space to think let alone hide behind the bulk of the coffee machine to sip at the mug. It haunts him, however, the thought of it innocently huddled on the counterr, doing nothing more than existing but Obi-Wan is consumed by it. \u201cThank you!\u201d Obi-Wan repeats, his grin verging on plastic, as artificial as the sweetness lingering over the back of his tongue and the canned music spilling from the speakers. It is a small mercy that it is a collection of instrumental tracks instead of the hit singles that would make his ears bleed by the second shift.\nCody hums along with the music, punctuating the beat by tapping a pen against the top of the register. It is a heavyset machine, the buttons polished to high sheen, and the gentle hits from Cody reverberate dully beneath the offbeat tune. Obi-Wan drifts back to his usual spot and picks up the mug. It\u2019s cooled somewhat but still has some warmth lingering so Obi-Wan sets his back against the counter as he picks it up, shielding himself from any potential customers who would wander in for the next couple of minutes. The drink is sweet, warmed through with spices and Obi-Wan groans into the mug, tipping his head back as he drains it.\n\u201cGood?\u201d Cody slides along the counter, picking up a cloth from the cleaning solution and beginning to wipe down the already clean wood. He\u2019s a line of heat against Obi-Wan\u2019s side, a blessing given the thin fabric of his shirt as he had discarded his jumper into the breakroom several hours ago.\nObi-Wan nods, his teeth knocking against the edge of the mug as he does so. He licks his lips, chasing remnants of the drink. \u201cVery. What is it?\u201d\n\u201cYou know how we got that gingerbread syrup that tastes more like faintly sweet nothing?\u201d\nObi-Wan nods, shifting to lean further into Cody.\n\u201cI made my own.\u201d Cody shrugs, trying to downplay his creation, but there\u2019s a flush over the tips of his ears and his gaze sneaks back to inspect the mug in Obi-Wan\u2019s hands too many times to be pure coincidence.\n\u201cYou are a wonder, Cody.\u201d\nThe bell rings and they both lean out around the machine, relaxing back when they recognise a familiar face, Rex\u2019s blonde hair mussed from the damp cap held in one hand as he knocks his boots clean. Rex snorts and Cody leans back out, the cloth balled up in his hand and ready to be thrown despite the deliberate casual lean against the clounter. \u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d\n\u201cYou know you\u2019re beneath mistletoe, right? Bad luck to break tradition.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t save him from the cloth thrown at his head and Rex ducks with a laugh. Cody rocks back onto his heels but Obi-Wan isn\u2019t looking, tracking his movement out of the corner of his eye. Rex is right. The plant is innocuous, a cluster of pale berries amongst the dark green sweep of the leaves, all tied up above Obi-Wan and Cody with a neat red ribbon.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Cody sighs. He scrubs a hand through his curls, biting at the tip of his tongue. Obi-Wan waits, his heart in his throat, his mind empty, and Cody glances over at him. \u201cWould\u2013 Can I kiss you?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nCody cups Obi-Wan\u2019s jaw, drawing him down into a kiss. It\u2019s everything Obi-Wan had hoped it would be and his hands fall to Cody\u2019s waist, gathering his apron in the desperate press of his palms. It\u2019s soft and sweet and Obi-Wan hums low in his throat, leaning closer. Breaking away, Cody leans back in and kisses Obi-Wan once more, his grin wide enough to\nhurt\n.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to do that for a while,\u201d Cody murmurs against Obi-Wan\u2019s mouth. He rocks back on his heels and tugs the neck of his apron down to reveal a graphic of mistletoe inverted. \u201cStarted to feel a little desperate.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201d Rex calls and Cody curses at him as Obi-Wan folds into laughter, pressing his hands to his burning cheeks."

        "writing_prompt": "Trapped in a cramped storage cupboard during an enemy search, Commander Cody and General Obi-Wan Kenobi find themselves closer than ever, their unspoken feelings threatening to spill over in the quiet, stolen moment.",
        "story": "\u201cHere.\u201d\nCody barely has a moment to register the pressure of Obi-Wan\u2019s hand around his wrist before he\u2019s pulled sideways. The door slides shut behind them with a click that echoes in the recesses of Cody\u2019s brain, the final notch in a tally he\u2019s been keeping since he first walked onto the bridge and saw Obi-Wan. He is completely and utterly fucked.\nThe cupboard \u2014 because calling it anything else would be an insult \u2014 is lined on both walls with shelving. Cody blinks in the sudden and complete darkness, waiting for his eyes to adjust. His helmet lies discarded somewhere on a higher level, a lucky shot cracking the visor and rendering it unusable, but the small beacon wired into it would still be active and they would be found. Eventually. Cody may be dead by then, his heart which carries by itself a price tag of seven hundred credits giving out due to the strain of how close Obi-Wan is to him. He can make out the flutter of Obi-Wan\u2019s lashes, the faint floral scent that clings to his breath as he sighs, his mouth pursing into a faint whistle.\nIt is how they trained them in Kamino, whistles and hand gestures, twisting them one way and then the other like a pack of hunting shrills, and Cody looks where Obi-Wan indicates. He can just make out the impression of his hand, one still wrapped around Cody\u2019s wrist, the blunt reflective sheen of a callus that swallows up the side of his thumb, before Obi-Wan releases him. His hand falls to his side and Cody misses the moment of contact. It would be for the best. He is used to surviving on rations stretched as far as they could go and Obi-Wan\u2019s touch could be divided up similarly.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Obi-Wan murmurs. His face is tipped towards Cody\u2019s ear, his hair falling free from the rough bun he had hurriedly tidied himself into before they stepped onto the ship and the strands fall across Cody\u2019s shoulder like a tidal wave. There\u2019s an absence of scent to it, the neutral nothingness that comes with the products supplied to the clones, and Cody\u2019s thoughts slowly tip into Obi-Wan in the showers before he tears himself back into rote procedure.\nHe\u2019s dead. He is never going to leave this cupboard.\nCody swallows and the sound echoes in the cavern of his skull, too loud to be anything other than a point blank blaster cocked against his temple. \u201cSorry for what, sir?\u201d\nObi-Wan catches himself on the edge of a laugh, biting it back as his shoulders shake. He lowers his head, pressing his forehead to Cody\u2019s shoulder before he breathes in and straightens up once more. Grief breaks into fragments across his brow blending with the lingering joy, his lower lip caught between his teeth. He clears his throat softly and Cody\u2019s attention snapping back to him. \u201cI should have tried to pick a better hiding spot,\u201d Obi-Wan says, an apology layered beneath his words. He presses his regrets into Cody\u2019s hip, the motion hidden from the door by the bulk of their bodies and the fall of Obi-Wan\u2019s robes, close but still apart.\n\u201cNext time, I\u2019d like one that has a caf machine installed.\u201d Cody leans into Obi-Wan\u2019s touch still. It is like he is starving, trying to tear himself away from a banquet. He can carve half-moons into his flesh from the jagged edges of his nails and sear the brush of Obi-Wan\u2019s fingertips into his bones and it will never be enough. He wants to kiss him, but he can\u2019t. Cody is a good soldier, he follows his orders, and Obi-Wan is his General. There isn\u2019t a space for them yet, not here, not like this.\n\u201cI will try my best in the future.\u201d\nThey are silent for a long moment. Distantly, the wail of an alarm begins to sound and the light bleeding through the narrow gap of the doors flickers a deep red. In the fresh hue, Cody looks up at Obi-Wan, meeting his gaze. \u201cWhat are you thinking, sir?\u201d\n\u201cLots of things,\u201d Obi-Wan answers automatically. His mouth curves into a small smile that doesn\u2019t go anywhere near his eyes, the same expression he wears when a politician breaks into his orbit, manufactured politeness brandished like a saber to get them away from him. Cody doesn\u2019t know what the Force feels like, how an entire universe's worth of input could cram itself into a single person\u2019s mind, but he squeezes Obi-Wan\u2019s hand. A tremor runs through the other man, a realigning of planets because of Cody\u2019s touch and he wonders if the Force feels better than this, if shifting the flow of the universe could compare to holding Obi-Wan\u2019s hand.\nObi-Wan continues, his voice perfectly level in stark opposition to the shiver rattling his teeth. \u201cI am thinking that I really would like to kiss you.\u201d\nCody starts, his breath tearing through his chest before he rights himself in the same moment, perfected Kaminoan engineering at work. \u201cI\u2019d like you to kiss me.\u201d\n\u201cNot like this, but\u2014\u201d Obi-Wan cups Cody\u2019s jaw in his free hand, smoothing his thumb over Cody\u2019s cheek, \u201c\u2014hold still, love.\u201d\nCody obeys. The ship could fall out of the sky and every single one of his brothers could tear open the door to this cupboard and Cody wouldn\u2019t move. Obi-Wan leans closer, pressing his cheek to Cody\u2019s before he turns his face closer. He blinks deliberately, his lashes dragging against Cody\u2019s skin, his breath warm as he exhales, and Cody closes his eyes. He wants to remember this. It is an unconventional kiss, but they have never done things in the typical way.\nObi-Wan straightens slowly. \u201cI will be able to kiss you properly after the war.\u201d\n\u201cI liked that kiss,\u201d Cody murmurs, his voice cracking, his cheeks suddenly burning. Obi-Wan chuckles, squeezing Cody\u2019s hand once more.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d"

        "writing_prompt": "Two overworked women with mismatched schedules finally have a rare morning off together in their cozy, cluttered apartment\u2014what small, quiet moments make it feel like home?",
        "story": "The flat is quiet when Obi-Wan manages to wrangle the door open through a mess of foliage and delicate string lights that throng their hallway. No need to worry about alarms or a security system when they had the normal mess and clutter of everyday life. She steps over Cody\u2019s work boots, placed into the same spot every day, and loosely toes her own shoes off next to them. The sole gapes wide as she does so, revealing the softer innards of fabric straining away from rubber, and she ignores it as best as she can.\nTape is a godsend and where tape wouldn\u2019t fix it, there is a small tube of superglue in one of the drawers she can ask Cody to try. The pads of Obi-Wan\u2019s fingers are still discoloured from her last attempt at trying to fix a pair of her shoes so she\u2019ll pass the problem to more capable hands. Her jacket is summarily discarded onto the back of the sofa and she lingers long enough to retrieve her lanyard and keys from the pocket, returning them to their forced exclusion into the small bowl on the counter for the next two days. The time off from work stretches luxuriously empty, free from any mandatory training or social obligations, and Obi-Wan skirts around the potential issue of their unique living arrangement as she flicks on the kettle, pulling one mug out of the cupboard, pausing and returning for another. Cody has the next couple of days off as well, a rarity with their opposite working schedules. Obi-Wan makes Cody\u2019s cup of coffee how she likes it, strong and sweet and a splash of milk first despite Obi-Wan\u2019s moral objections to the concept, and rifles through her small collection of tea. There is no caffeine in her immediate future if she wants to sleep for any part of the morning; another hidden delight of adulthood that\u2019s tripped her over and bruised up her face. She chews on the tip of her tongue as she draws a bag free, dropping it into her cup and chasing it with the boiling water.\nA door creaks further in the apartment and Obi-Wan rocks back onto her heels, a dozy prickle of contentment resting on the nape of her neck. Cody\u2019s steps are steady, sleep-slow and her slippers smack against the floor as she makes her way into the sitting room. Much of her isn\u2019t visible, a walking plaid blanket that hides her face and her curls, but the tattoo over her calf is clearly visible with one of her pyjama trouser legs drawn up over her knee while the other falls to the floor.\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Obi-Wan says, breaking into a yawn that she doesn\u2019t bother to hide behind her hand. Her manners are ingrained into her bones but even that runs thin and fallow after so long spent at work.\n\u201cG\u2019morning,\u201d Cody responds, her words muffled through fabric and sleep. Obi-Wan can picture her expression, her eyes still mostly closed and her gaze filtered through her impossibly long lashes and her grin easily worn in.\nObi-Wan follows her, both mugs in hand, and places them onto the clear spaces on their cluttered coffee table. She has options for seating, the low slouch of a battered armchair Obi-Wan carried to her student dorm, then flat, then four different flatshares before this one or the other end of the sofa that Cody has already claimed, piled high with blankets and a handful of cushions that Cody would claim as family heirlooms at the first hint of decluttering. She sits on Cody\u2019s legs stretched out over the seat before she wriggles backwards into the hollow created. Cody grunts, shifting her legs straighter before she reaches down to tug a section of the blanket free, pulling it over Obi-Wan.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in early,\u201d Cody mumbles. She\u2019s partially spilled out of the blanket now wrapped around her waist. She stretches and her shirt rises with the motion, everything about her solid and real and beautiful.\nObi-Wan hums in agreement, leaning sideways against Cody who absorbs the motion with a soft sound. She wraps an arm around Obi-Wan\u2019s shoulders, playing with the loose edge of her sleeve. \u201cMove your head up a bit? You\u2019re lying right on my tit.\u201d Obi-Wan does so, her face flushed but it\u2019s fine. It happens. Cody continues, her voice a little more structured as she wakes, \u201cFigured you\u2019d like the bed to sleep after your night shift so I came out here for the morning. It\u2019ll be nice having us both around the house, little human company to prove I\u2019m not just another cog in the machine.\u201d\nIf Cody is a cog, then she would be the best cog imaginable, something brimming with lots of interlocking teeth, a fundamental piece of the machinery. Obi-Wan tells her this because why wouldn\u2019t she? It makes perfect sense.\nCody tips her head back as she laughs, the sound vibrating through Obi-Wan like it would rattle all the broken pieces in her chest back together. She curls closer, crossing her legs one over the other and then swapping them back, and Cody rights herself carefully, smearing the heel of her palm across her eyes. She curls her hand around Obi-Wan\u2019s head, drawing her face upwards. The air hangs still and heavy, steam curling from their mugs nearly forgotten on the table, and Cody leans down, kissing Obi-Wan. She tastes like coffee and a stale tang of sleep and like home. Obi-Wan grins against her mouth, pressing herself closer, the mugs and sleep entirely forgotten."
