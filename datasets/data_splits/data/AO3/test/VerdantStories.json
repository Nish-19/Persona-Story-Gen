        "writing_prompt": "When Marella's uncontrollable fire abilities threaten to consume everything around her, only Linh's calm determination can bring her back\u2014but in the aftermath of the blaze, a confession ignites a different kind of flame between them.",
        "story": "Marella Redeck was different. She looked at the world differently. But the world looked back at her with hatred. A long story short, Marella had a crush on someone.\n\u2014-----\nShe walked out of her lesson with Fintan tiredly.\n\u201cHow do I summon Everblaze?\u201d She had asked,\n\u201cYou don\u2019t, it calls for you.\u201d Fintan had responded.\nShe leaped to Choralmere where Linh was still staying. A hot tug kept pulling her. She did her best to ignore it but it was like ignoring getting stabbed. Linh opened the door with a smile and headed out to meet her.\n\u201cHey Mare.\u201d Linh said,\nShe was the one person who could call her that.\n\u201cHi Linh.\u201d She replied.\nMarella felt her cheeks warm. But before anyone could say anything else, Marella collapsed under the pressure of the hot tug. She was no longer in control; fire was. Before she knew it her hand was raised and yellow-white fire came down to her. Linh screamed and started gathering water. Quan and Mai Song threw frissin on the fire putting it out. But the fire was resilient and it came back time and time again.\n\u201cMARELLA!\u201d Linh screamed as her parents tried to drag her away.\nMarella would have responded but she wasn\u2019t Marella anymore all that was there was fire.\nLinh pulled out of her parents grasps and ran straight into the fire using her water to protect her. Marella was in the center of the blaze fighting for control of her ability.\n\u201cMarella.\u201d Linh said through a coughing fit. Smoke inhalation. \u201cCalm the blaze.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d Marella weeped.\nLinh walked closer to her, \u201cYes you can. You're Marella freaking Redek and you can do this!\u201d\nWhen Marella tried again and failed Linh got her heaving deep breaths.\n\u201cIn and out Mare, in and out.\u201d She coaxed.\nWhen Marella tried again the Everblaze stopped. The fires went out with only a small trace that they were ever there.\n\u201cEfflorescence.\u201d Linh breathed,\nIn the center of the efflorescence was a tall red and blue flower. Colors overlapping in an array of petals. Marella sighed in relief and wonder.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d She told Linh.\n\u201cIt was all you, Mare.\u201d Linh told her.\nMarella shook her head in defeat. She breathed in deeply, enjoying the scented air. Linh stood by her wrapping her in a quick hug.\n\u201cI\u2026 .\u201d Marella tried to say,\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Linh said, tilting her head to the side.\n\u201cI\u2026love you.\u201d She said, the latter as quiet as a single slow drop of water in a hurricane.\n\u201cMarella I couldn\u2019t hear you.\u201d Linh pointed out.\n\u201cI love you.\u201d Marella said again louder and faster.\n\u201cI love you too, Mare.\u201d\n\u201cNo like love love you.\u201d\n\u201cI do too.\u201d\nMarella looked at Linh in a new light.\n\u201cYou love me.\u201d She squeaked,\nLinh nodded, \u201cI worried you wouldn't feel the same so I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d\nMarella laughed in joy. Their hands came together and they smiled. Some wouldn't accept them. And that\u2019s just natural but that wouldn't stop them for acting on their emotions."

        "writing_prompt": "When Keefe wakes Sophie up in the middle of the night with a craving for human snacks, their adventure to Walmart turns into a chaotic, snack-filled night under the Panakes tree\u2014complete with laughter, confessions, and an impromptu snack war.",
        "story": "\u201cFoster? Foster?\u201d Keefe whispered straight into her ear.\n\u201cMmwhatdoUwaaanT.\u201d Sophie said clearly still wanting to sleep.\nShe had set up outside under the Panakes tree again but she wasn\u2019t expecting a certain blond boy to wake her up.\nKeefe started tickling her and she snapped awake and gripped his wrist.\nHe smirked, \u201cYou look cute when you're angry.\u201d\nShe blushed, \u201cShut up, tell me why you had to wake me up.\u201d\n\u201cCan you blame a guy for wanting to bother a certain girl?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the real reason. Tell me.\u201d\n\u201cFine I just wanted to see you.. \u2026 .and I want human snacks.\u201d\nSophie groaned, \u201cFine but it\u2019s coming out of your birth-fund.\u201d\nKeefe jumped to his feet and clapped his hands excitedly. Honestly Sophie had to blush. It was adorable.\n\u2014-\nSo now they were standing outside of a Walmart after Sophie had teleported them. They had picked up Dex just so they could get human money but he went home straight after.\nKeefe did a double-take between the store and Sophie. When Sophie nodded he practically bolted inside. Sophie walked in after him and grabbed a shopping cart. Keefe was already in the snack aisle when Sophie walked into it. He was looking at pretty much every label on the snacks and practically screamed in delight when he saw some packs of E.L Fudges.\n\u201cGrab them, if you want them.\u201d Sophe said through a yawn.\nHe didn\u2019t just grab one he grabbed ten. Sophie face-palmed and grabbed a bucket of cheese-puffs. Keefe grabbed: three different types of goldfish, eight fudge stripes (only because of the elf on the packaging), four packs of chips-ahoy, and six packs of circus animals. Whereas Sophie grabbed: four oreo packs, a pack of Hostess cupcakes, and a bag of pretzels.\nThey went to the self-checkout (mainly to avoid questions about where their parents were) and started scanning. Keefe insisted on scanning the E.L Fudges but gave up after the tenth try. Sophie gave him a sympathetic smile and scanned the barcode. Keefe\u2019s jaw dropped as she got through all the snacks (and some Snickers from the shelf next to the self-checkout) in less than twenty seconds.\nThey leaped back to Havenfield as soon as they were out of sight.\n\u2014--\nThey sat underneath the Panakes tree and Keefe immediately dove into the E.L Fudges.\n\u201cSave some. You're going to want more later.\u201d Sophie warned as she opened a cupcake.\nIt was nothing compared to mallowmelt but it was still delicious. The cream center was slightly questionable after all this time without snacks like this but she still ate it.\n\u201cYou know, I never thought I\u2019d eat human snacks under a Panakes tree. What about you?\u201d Keefe said after six cookies.\n\u201cDefinitely not.\u201d\n\u201cIf I had thought about it I\u2019d be very happy though.\u201d\nSophie laughed, \u201cYeah me too.\u201d\nShe opened the bucket of cheese-puffs next. The cheese powder stuck to her fingers after just brushing the puffs.\n\u201cWhat are those?\u201d Keefe asked, pointing to the cheese-puffs.\nShe laughed again, \u201cCheese-puffs, want some?\u201d\nAs if he needed an invitation he had already stuffed seven into his mouth at a time. They opened the Chips-Ahoy next.\n\u201cThese are pretty dry aren\u2019t they?\u201d Keefe said,\n\u201cDefinitely, but I think it\u2019s just a human cookie thing.\u201d\nOreos came next. Again they were kinda dry but the cream definitely helped. Sophie definitely saw Grady and Edaline looking out the windows a few times. Parents.\n\u201cThis is the best thing I\u2019ve put in my mouth.\u201d Keefe said after stuffing a cupcake into his mouth.\n\u201cI doubt it\u2019s the \u2018best thing\u2019 but they are pretty good.\u201d\nThe fudge stripes, according to Keefe, \u201cwere just knock-off E.L Fudges.\u201d Sophie had tried to explain that they were made by the same people but he didn\u2019t listen. At this point everything had been opened and several wrappers and snacks littered the grass.\nSophie shoved some pretzels into her mouth as Keefe fidgeted with a Snickers bar.\n\u201cYou know, I think this might be the best night ever.\u201d\n\u201cIt has been pretty awesome.\u201d Sophie agreed.\n\u201cI mean human snacks and Sophie Foster, how could it get better?\u201d\nNow Sophie was blushing. The light from the moon illuminated the blush too.\nSophie yawned. Keefe brushed some cheese dust off the corner of her mouth.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d have a good night without you.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t give me all the credit. You're the one who forced me to take you to Walmart.\u201d\n\u201cI still don\u2019t get why they call it Wall art.\u201d\n\u201cWalmart, Keefe and you're changing the subject.\u201d\nKeefe laughed and looked straight into her eyes, \u201cEven if I hadn't woken you up it would've been awesome since I got to see you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so cheesy!\u201d\n\u201cNot as cheesy as these things.\u201d Keefe gestured to the now mostly empty bucket of cheese-puffs.\nSophie threw a pretzel at him and it got stuck in his hair.\n\u201cYou want to start a snack war Foster?\u201d He said arming himself with the Snickers bar held out like a sword.\nThey laughed it off. They looked at each other and pressed their lips together. Keefe\u2019s lips moved from her mouth to the spot between her neck and ear. Sophie moaned elation filling her. Their lips met again and Sophie pulled them closer together, wrapping her arms around him. Keefe added a delicate nibble to her lower lip. She shivered in a good way and let it keep going. Dang she\u2019d never stop loving him. They broke apart.\n\u201cHow about that snack war?\u201d Sohe asked. Tossing another pretzel into his hair.\nKeefe grinned, \u201cOh it is so on!\u201d\nSnacks flew for around ten minutes. Neither of them remembered falling asleep under the tree, but they did. Neither wanted the night to be over. But even the best things come to a close. That doesn't stop anyone from wondering how they can make one night last forever."

        "story": "Luz knew from the second she accepted the Titan\u2019s power she wouldn't be back forever. A sharp pang of guilt hit her when she called out that she was back when she appeared back in the spot where she had died the first time. And every time the pattern in her chest flickered slightly it was a reminder that she would fall back down in the In Between. She knew it would be painful for her, and everyone she left behind. But it would be worth it.. \u2026. . Right? To stop Belos and save the Isles. She had to do this. Did she? If she had never followed Owlbert through the portal on that summer morning none of this would have ever happened. She knew that. It was a thought that plagued her mind every single time she woke up while they were trapped in the human realm. Followed by the thought of \u201cYou could end this all. All you need is a knife, or rope, or deep water.\u201d She hadn\u2019t told anyone she had thought of taking her life. Better to hide behind an illusion of contentment. But Hunter saw it. He saw it every time she pretended things were normal. Because he felt guilty too. Her fault as well.\nBut something smacked her in the face in this downward spiral. Hunter wouldn't exist if she hadn\u2019t come to the Boiling Isles. Amity would still be wrapped around her mothers finger. Willow would've never switched to the plant track. Gus (technically Agustus if she had just gone to camp) would be forever doubting himself with Willow as his only friend (and vice versa). Vee would still be trapped, she wouldn't be able to run forever. Matt would think he still had to prove himself. Eda would\u2019ve never opened up. King would keep living in denial. And the Collector, they would still be trapped with no way out (a fate he never deserved). The magic mixers (Jerbo, Viney and Barcus) would still be in the detention track. Luz smiled as she was lifted to the air, the Titan\u2019s power starting to leave her body.\n\u201cEda, King, thank you for being a part of my life.\u201d Luz said, before the Titan\u2019s spirit moved on and so did she.\nDeath was much more pleasant this time around. And she even smiled when she hit the strangely warm water in the In Between. She closed her eyes letting a few tears loose as she left the realm she loved. No one to pull her out of the water: she sank.\nLuz\u2019s eyes opened as she felt warmth. Not the all consuming warmth of the water but of love and the good feelings Luz missed. She looked in front of her.\n\u201cD\u2026. Dad?\u201d She said not quite believing it.\n\u201cHi Little Light.\u201d Manny said, opening his arms toward her.\nLuz ran towards him. A lifetime's worth of hug in one embrace. Luz cried happily wrapped in her father\u2019s warm hug.\n\u201cYou did so good Luz. My good witch.\u201d He said right in her ear neither breaking the hug.\nLuz agreed for the first time in a very long time. She had saved the realm she loved and the people she loved.\n\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Manny asked, pulling away and holding out his hand to Luz.\nLuz nodded, taking his hand. And the best part was she really was."

        "story": "Amity loved Luz, more than she would ever admit. So when she saw Luz chopping off her hair she jumped at the opportunity to help. She loved discussing Azura with Luz who had such interesting insights including the fact that she also shipped Azura and Hecate. Amity wanted to give everything to Luz. She wanted to be there whenever she had another panic attack. She wanted to read Azura with her. So to say she was crushing on Luz was a major understatement.\n\u2014----\n\u201cHey,\u201d Amity greeted Luz who was curled up on a chair reading.\n\u201cHey.\u201d She said back,\nThat already felt like a win. Sometimes with Luz she would just remain silent or wave.\n\u201cSo I had a question.\u201d Amity started.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Luz asked,\n\u201cWhy did you want to cut your hair so bad?\u201d\nLuz bit her lip and looked down at her hands with those obscure magenta eyes Amity had gotten lost in many times.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me I was just curious.\u201d\n\u201cI want to tell you I just- d- I don\u2019t know how.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve found it\u2019s best just to blurt it out. No beating around the bush.\u201d\nLuz chuckled and Amity felt her face warm.\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m- it\u2019s- I\u2019m a grimwalker.\u201d She choked out barely above a whisper.\n\u201cOh Titan.\u201d Amity cursed, \u201cThat\u2019s a copy of a dead person right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, how did you know?\u201d\n\u201cI may or may not have read a few things while working at the library.\u201d\nLuz giggled a little but her smile faded.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\nAmity smiled, and mimed zipping her lips shut.\n\u201cSo what does that have to do with your hair?\u201d Amity asked,\n\u201cThe girl I\u2019m a copy of had the exact same length of hair as I did before I cut it after escaping the Empress\u2019s mind.\u201d\n\u201cSo when it was growing out again it triggered you.\u201d Amity guessed.\n\u201cRight.\u201d Luz confirmed, \u201cSpeaking of hair when I first met you, you had green hair. Why the change?\u201d\n\u201cOh, green is what Odalia prefered since she was trying to make me her little doll.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s abomination colored right?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hair now, it\u2019s abomination colored.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, only my dad has caught that. How did you?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Luz started getting flustered, \u201cWell you\u2019re an abomination witch, abominations, purple, it just fit.\u201d\nAmity laughed and Luz\u2019s face went red and she cracked a rare smile.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so brave.\u201d Amity whispered.\n\u201cHow so.\u201d Luz said, genuinely confused.\n\u201cWell, you were in the Empress\u2019s mind, found out all of this stuff and still kept fighting. Not to mention how amazing you were at fighting and at being the Silver Soldier. Then I\u2019m just some doll, and a constant disappointment.\u201d\n\u201cWHAT!? NO! You\u2019re not a disappointment and you\u2019re not a doll! You\u2019re so pretty and cool and classy and I can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t realize that! You\u2019re amazing Amity and I-\u201d Luz cut herself off before she could finish that sentence. Her face went livid and she slapped her hand over her mouth. Amity\u2019s face went tomato mode and hope filled her eyes. Luz ran out of the room.\n\u2014-----\nLuz loved Amity, it was really easy to tell. She always stumbled on her words when she was around and could never stop thinking about a certain cotton candy haired goddess. She would do anything for Amity. But she wasn\u2019t prepared to accidentally blurt out her feelings to her.\n\u201cHOLD ON! YOU DID WHAT!\u201d Hunter yelled in shock.\n\u201cI accidentally confessed to Amity, and now she\u2019s going to hate me!\u201d Luz replied.\n\u201cIT\u2019S ABOUT TIME!\u201d Hunter practically screamed.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get it Hunter, she\u2019s going to hate me.\u201d Luz cried burying her face in pillows.\n\u201cLuz, Amity isn\u2019t going to hate you.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know!\u201d\n\u201cLuz tell me how did she react after you said all those things?\u201d\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m not good at reading people Hunter.\u201d\n\u201cJust tell me what was the look in her eyes?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to laugh.\u201d\n\u201cTry me.\u201d\n\u201cShe looked\u2026.. .. \u2026. .. . Hopeful.\u201d\nHunter looked victorious as he left Luz\u2019s room. Luz heard a few small knocks on her open door. When she looked up she saw Amity hiding behind an Azura book.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything I understand if you hate me-\u201d Amity started.\n\u201cWAIT YOU THOUGHT I WOULD HATE YOU!\u201d Luz cried,\n\u201cYES!?\u201d\n\u201cI THOUGHT YOU WOULD HATE ME!\u201d\n\u201cWHY WOULD I HATE YOU?!\u201d\n\u201cI DON\u2019T KNOW?!!\u201d\nThey stared at each other and laughed.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Luz asked, gesturing to the Azura book in her hands.\n\u201cOh, they just published Azura book 6, I thought I could use it as a peace offering.\u201d\n\u201cTHEY PUBLISHED AZURA BOOK 6!\u201d Luz screamed happily.\n\u201cYEAH!\u201d Amity also cried happily.\n\u201cDo you want to read it together?\u201d Luz asked, shyly.\n\u201cI\u2019d love to, but first,\u201d Amity\u2019s face turned pink, \u201cdid you mean all those things you said earlier?\u201d\nLuz\u2019s face went supernova as she nodded, \u201cI- I really think you're pretty and you\u2019re so much braver than I am. I mean you stood up to your awful m-\u201d\nLuz was cut off by Amity\u2019s lips pressing against hers. Luz was shocked at first but melted into it, she lifted her hand to cup Amity\u2019s chin. Amity broke the kiss looking shocked at herself and fearful.\n\u201cOh, crikey.\u201d Luz breathed,\n\u201cI cannot believe I just did that.\u201d Amity mumbled eyes still wide.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I just said that! \u2018Oh crikey,\u2019 how did I even think that!\u201d\nAmity smiled and pressed her lips against Luz\u2019s cheek, \u201cI dunno I kind of liked it.\u201d\nLuz looked over at Amity grinning, \u201cAlright then, shall we read Azura?\u201d\n\u201cYes we shall.\u201d Amity giggled and they cuddled together on Luz\u2019s bed and read Azura. Ghost and Stringbean curled up in their owners laps.\n\u201cDo you want to be my girlfriend?\u201d Luz blurted,\n\u201cYES!\u201d Amity practically screamed.\nThey grinned and their lips pressed together again to seal the deal."

She had become head counselor of the Aphrodite cabin easily. She was not shy.\n***\nAfter they defeated Gaia, Piper just felt broken. Leo was gone. He couldn\u2019t be dead. He couldn\u2019t.\nEven without the grief of losing Leo, she felt\u2026 off. She was supposed to be happy\u2026 right? She had an awesome boyfriend, friends, she had saved the world. But something was wrong. She didn\u2019t know how to feel. Something was\u2026 well.. wrong.\nShe remembered playing capture the flag with Annabeth. How the daughter of Athena got when she focused. The way blond curls fell down her face. How Piper just wanted to brush them behind her ear. The ruthless way she fought.\nShe shook her head. No. She was in love with Jason. She wanted to be with him. She remembered how happy she had been when Jason kissed her on that roof\u2026 but that was fake. A trick of the Mist, giving her memories that weren\u2019t real.\nBut no\u2026 she did love Jason\u2026 she did! But why did she feel\u2026 hollow. Empty. Back then she chocked it up to the grief that came from losing Leo.\nShe thought back to Annabeth. A girl who was confident. Always had a plan. And\u2026 no, no, that was silly. Piper was with Jason, Annabeth was with Percy. That was the way it was supposed to be.\nRight?\nIt was constant dumb thoughts like that, that left her reminding herself\u2026 that she loved Jason. She\ndid\n.\nAphrodite pushing her\u2026 Hera putting false memories in her head.\nNo, she wanted to be with the son of Jupiter. She\ndid\n, really\u2026 right?\nAnnabeth, confident, beautiful, smart, Annabeth.\nBut that was just silly,\ndumb\nthoughts\u2026 that was all it was.\nShe felt more and more empty. It was suffocating, and she wanted out. She imagined this was what it was like for Percy to drown for the first time. It wasn\u2019t\u2026 real. It wasn\u2019t. Just grief, a trick, a.. an\u2026 she didn\u2019t know.\nShe didn\u2019t know how to feel, and she hated it. She was a daughter of Aphrodite for the gods\u2019 sake! She\u2026 she was the one who was supposed to break hearts.\nAnnabeth\u2019s hand brushed Piper\u2019s\u2026 her heart leapt into her throat.\nNo\nPiper\u2026 didn\u2019t love Jason. Not like a girlfriend should anyway. She didn\u2019t\u2026 want to be his girlfriend.\nThen what did she want?! For as long as she remembered all she had wanted was Jason.. for as long as she had known him.\nAphrodite pushing her\u2026 Hera putting false memories in her head.\nBut\u2026 she knew.. she\ndid\n!\nRight\n?\nIf she did\u2026 Why did she feel empty?\nShe thought about Annabeth again. Why\nalways\nAnnabeth. Someone who\u2026. Someone she\ncouldn\u2019t\nhave.\nWas that what it was? Knowing she couldn\u2019t have what she wanted\u2026 even though her entire life had been giving her what she wanted\u2026 she couldn\u2019t have\nthis\n. This. One. Thing.\nIt felt like a sick joke.\nA daughter of Aphrodite stuck on a dumb\ncrush\n. She was supposed to break other people\u2019s hearts\u2026 not the other way around.\nShe broke up with Jason. For what? Annabeth? Someone she could\nnever\nhave.\n***\nPiper McLean was not shy. Until a certain daughter of Athena made her heart leap.\nShe wasn\u2019t shy until she wanted something she wouldn\u2019t take.\nIcarus flew too close to the sun, Piper flew into it."
