        "story": "Lucanis Dellamorte was not fucking good at this.\nHe should look away from you, stationed resolutely at his side. Any minute now, his eyes would slip to focus on the other side of the room, or out past the trees swaying in the distant breeze. Except now, the candlelight has flickered to illuminate you in a bright wash of amber light. Every trace of lingering shadow is chased away by the brightness, flame still swaying faithfully to a tune only known to fire.\nYour hands were gentle as they worked under the dim light. Calm. Methodical. There was a pattern to how you did things. It was something he itched to ask about, but knew better than to pry about a past not offered willingly.\nHe still hasn't looked away when you further disinfect the slash on his forearm, or when you glance up at the sharp inhale he allows himself to express at the sting. Eyes meet in the dark, over blood and salve and a cavern of things he wants to say,\nthinks\nabout saying, imagines endlessly,\nruthlessly\nabout\ndoing\n-\nOnly, he doesn't.\nCan't\n. Wouldn't know where to even begin, should he learn that you've carved your own well of sorrows, your own deep pit full of longing for the assassin constantly in your midst. And yet, before you gather yourself to do what Lucanis simply, genuinely\ncannot\n, because -\nMaker\n. Who is he, to look away from such a beauty that rivals Andraste herself?\nYour apology is soft, accompanied by a smile that doesn't reach your eyes. He promises to forgive you, but only if you swear to him that he won't lose a limb under your questionable care. The laugh that follows is enough to stop his heart. He feels a small smile of his own reveal itself, and you linger like this, until the golden moment\nshatters\n.\nBefore you turn back to changing his dressings (at your deepest, most incredible insistence) he saw something new in your eyes. A fresh expression graced your features, captivating as they are on their own. Something that, if he didn't know better, resembled a resigned sort of\nheartache\n.\nThe candle flickers once more, in time with the finishing steps of your task. You gather your materials, and Lucanis still cannot\nfucking\nlook\naway\n, Maker what is\nwrong\nwith him - but then you're standing, bidding him a good night and trying to slip back to your own space without incident.\nHe reacts instead of\nthinks\n- his hand taking your wrist just before you move out of reach. You turn back, praying he won't hear the way your heart picks up speed, or the hitch in your breath when you bring your eyes to look at him. His voice is quiet when he speaks, smooth in contrast with the rough war of shadow and light the candles impress upon him.\nThank you\n. He clears his throat, seems unsure what to say next.\nSleep well\n.\nYou're acutely aware of his fingertips on your skin. The burn is hot and fierce and soft and Maker it's too much.\nOf course\n. Your response is quick. A little strained.\nAnytime, Lucanis.\nHe feels you slip through his grasp and watches you leave, wondering what, exactly, it is you think of him."

        "story": "Commander\nCullen Rutherford\nbegs himself to\nget a fucking grip.\nThe war table sprawls before him, mid-afternoon sun descending quick and cold behind snow kissed mountaintops. It leaves a chill in the air, something brisk and soulless to compliment the shadows gathering in the corners of the room.\nThe aforementioned table has not yet spoken any magical words of wisdom, nor has it moved any of his pieces to show him where best to place the newest wave of ready recruits. Tapered candles burn slow and languid in their sconces, yet they've been lit long enough that they resemble mere stubs now, instead of the tall towers they once were.\nThey resembled pale shadows of themselves, much like the lot of you, still staring at the map, still glancing at one another in the flickering flames hoping something else comes to mind before this session is adjourned.\nAnything,\nCullen wishes,\nbut another moment of\nthis.\nYou've been here most of the day, and\nMaker\n, does it show in the tired eyes of those gathered 'round. That hasn't stopped his mind from wandering throughout the day however, eyes all but fixed on you, regardless of the task at hand.\u00a0 He lingers on the way your mouth pulls into a tired smile at something Leliana has said, though all Cullen hears is your laugh, sparkling through the room in an echo that warms the cold mountain chill from his bones.\nAndraste have mercy.\nHe finds himself wrapping one hand tightly around the pommel of the ever present sword gilding his hip, while the other clings to the edge of the scuffed wooden table. With leather gloves adorning his hands, no one will notice the tightness with which he clings to his chosen anchors. No doubt were his knuckles white with the strain. With the\nforce\n. Yet, as much as he would hope, in this moment, that no one could tell how he longs to reach for you, gilded golden, holy, divine, always so,\nso\nwretchedly\nbeautiful\n- he knows Leliana is no fool. Nor are you, for that matter. The slight tremble in his hands can be hidden, but his eyes will always betray him.\nHe clears his throat, stumbling over his breath when you catch him staring from across the room. His name falls softly through your lips, sounding ever more like a hymn, even with the laziness of sleep weaving through your voice.\nYou coming?\nThe steel of the sword bites through his glove as he nods and follows you through the heavy door. Without thinking, his other hand lifts to graze along your lower back, guiding you while he trails behind. He returns your smile, hesitant, too wrapped up in the way you're looking at him, much as he thinks he's been fawning over you all day.\nRidiculous\n, he insists.\nThere's absolutely no way -\nyou're his\n- the -\nInquisitor\n,\nand he's\nsure\nthat -\nHe feels your hand slip into his. It takes him a moment, to realize what you've done. To realize what you're\ntelling\nhim. It's jarring, the realization that he doesnt\nknow anything\n, actually. Except, if Commander Cullen Rutherford knows anything at all, it's how much he's been\ndying\nto curl his fingers around yours and press a soft kiss to your knuckles.\nSo when he walks you to your quarters for the night, that's exactly what he does."

        "writing_prompt": "Late at night, with the weight of the world pressing heavy on your shoulders, a knock at the door reveals someone who understands that burden all too well.",
        "story": "It was a strange thing, carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders. You don't even remember when it draped itself all cold and snug across your silhouette, or when it decided it was here to stay. This was a burden you never expected to hold, to carry with you during each passing moment, with every grounding inhale and exhale you took. It wasn't a welcome thing, these days; it had become so,\nso\nheavy, yet it was not something so easily discarded. Not even for a moment of blessed peace.\nOn the sleepless nights, a fire usually crackles and dances until it wears itself down to embers in the ashes, glowing soft and cozy as the moons begin to set in the sky. You would busy yourself with everything and nothing at all, to pass the time.\nThis night, however, seemed different.\nFelt\ndifferent. You've let the hearth remain dark and cold, favoring the soft amber glow of candlelight instead. They chase away reaching shadows the crescent moon cannot touch. The comfort of a clay mug warms your fingers, curls of steam swirling off into the night. You've made yourself comfy in your favorite window to watch the landscape beyond, brightening by the gradual ascension of the moons.\nAnd then you hear it. Soft footfalls. Faint, even in the blissful silence of an hour so late. They cease, hesitant outside the closed door, only to shift after a moment. The figure continues to linger, linger,\nlinger\nuntil finally\n,\na knock echoes through the wood.\nYou're unsurprised to find Lucanis standing on the other side.\n\"Can't sleep?\" he says, hand curved around the door when he eases it open.\n\"Fast asleep, actually.\"\nHe huffs a laugh from where he stands. \"Funny.\"\n\"According to you, I'm\nalways\nfunny.\" the barb is said with curved lips and a gesture to the chair nearby when he can't decide how to answer.\nHe's grateful for the offer, how you let his silence slip through the cracks. It's\nridiculous\n, he thinks. He's a\nCrow\nfor fuck's sake. Seduction, charm - it was\nliterally\npart of his\ntraining;\nyet when it comes to\nyou -\nwell. Lucanis is absolutely delighted you don't twist the knife in his pride like Harding has started doing.\nMercilessly,\nmay he add.\nHe settles into the chair and pretends he can't feel you watching his every breath, his every shift until he's comfortable. When he looks at you again, he can see it almost instantly: the toll of what your lives have become. How you've grown and faltered, how you've shined and how you've crashed and burned. It's there, all of it, weaving it's way into your body language, your features, captivating as they are. And, of course -\nof course\n. He sees the way you catch him reading you, only to turn quickly back to the window, then to the contents of what remains in your mug.\nThat's what tipped him off, hearing you in the kitchen.\nSilence, once again, nestles itself into the space, a warm blanket draped with care over the heaviness of a night bearing nothing but memory. It's something you've grown accustomed to, this comfortable stillness filling up the atmosphere when you and Lucanis are alone like this. It's nice.\nReassuring\n, even. Like a little pocket held out of time and space, curated solely for both of you to catch your breath.\nIt's becoming something familiar, something Lucanis maybe even\nrelies on\n, if only a little bit, when he remembers the crushing weight that he too, carries within him. This could be dangerous, he knows, whatever is blooming slow and soft and true between you, yet he's surprised to realize he doesn't much care.\nHe watches you swirl the dregs of your cup, curling steam no longer framing the divine contours of your face. His fingers grip the wood of the chair tight enough that it bites into calloused palms. He needs - well, to be honest, he needs a fucking\nminute,\nactually, or he's going to jump out of his fucking\nskin.\nA fucking\nCrow\n- more like an\nembarrassment\n.\nNaturally, it takes him little time to see an opportunity before he simply takes it.\n\"Let me get you another,\" he nods to the mug, resting loose in your grip, now that it's drained dry. \"You stay where you are. Embrace the quiet while you can.\"\n\"I - it's -\" You realize too late how you were never able to successfully\nlie\nto Lucanis. You had allowed him to learn you, and learn you\nwell\n. An agreement stumbles through your lips instead. The cup is raised in surrender, with no thought to hide the exhaustion coating your voice with its poisoned tongue. \"\nThank you\n. Oh, and I made -\"\n\"I know.\" He says, pausing when his fingers slide over yours to cradle the pottery. Your eyes meet, and neither of you move from the warmth, or the thrill of comfort that such a small touch brings you both.\nAnd then, quick as it was cast, the spell shatters.\nYou melt into a teasing grin, still holding the attention of those lovely amber eyes. He doesn't seem to notice you're covering the frantic beating of your heart.\n\"Ah, so the Prince of Crows knows my drink order, does he? I\nam\nsomeone important after all.\"\nLucanis rolls his eyes and snatches the cup away. His turn is quick, not to hide his smirk, but the heat rising in his cheeks and nestling in his heart. What he can't hide, however, is the smooth rumble of laughter as he crosses the room. He lingers once more at the threshold, head angled toward your place in the window. He's unsure he should speak of it, but he decides he\nmust\n, if right now, he cant offer you anything more.\nHis quiet words, when they reach you, are both a balm on your aching heart and a swift punch to the gut all the same.\n\"This is something we carry\ntogether,\nyou know. Lean on us, Rook. Anytime you need.\"\nThen the shadows of the hallway swallow him whole."

        "writing_prompt": "On a quiet, sleepless night, you find yourself lingering outside Lucanis Dellamorte's door, hesitant to knock but unable to walk away. When his voice calls out, inviting you in, the weight of the world on your shoulders begins to lift\u2014if only for a little while.",
        "story": "Night had fallen slow and steady like molasses, with warm honey golds giving way to deep indigo dusk and, eventually, melting into the embrace of a velvety midnight nightfall. Silence has nestled in like an old lover, an even older friend. Firelight shone luminous, shadows blanketing the negative space between flames in an age old dance of graceful balance, this domesticated sort of starlight\n.\nIt was hard not to notice it, this balance, when that seemed to be what brought you here, lingering just outside the threshold of\nLucanis\u2019s\nroom.\nThe door wasn\u2019t closed, but instead it nestled close to the threshold, kissing itself shut but not enough to latch. A curled fist hovered in the midair, poised to knock a soft melody over the wood worn with the never ending passage of time. Hesitation kept you rooted in your place, stillness settling into your bones. It held you back from knocking, from feeling the sting of wood on bare skin, from calling through the door to ask for entry.\nAnd yet \u2013 you chose this specific moment on purpose \u2013 this liminal space shaking itself awake once everyone else had gone to sleep. Except for you, of course. And Lucanis, because you remember him saying once how he never sleeps anyway. This wasn\u2019t the first time you had passed these quiet hours together, after all.\nAnd still, you stood silent, unmoving, breath held in the face of anticipation \u2013\ncowardice,\nif we\u2019re being honest \u2013 because, well. This time feels different.\nA sharp inhale catches on your teeth when your name is called from inside the room. It\u2019s soothing, his voice. Gentle.\nCoaxing.\nThere\u2019s question in it, that one thing in this whole entire mess that belongs to you, and you alone. Names are special things.\nPrecious\n. And gods, you love how yours sounds falling through his lips.\nIt\u2019s routine by this point, your mind scarcely aware of how so much tension melts back into the shadows, muscles freed from this bondage they did not want,\nnever\nwant. How breath flows easier, flows deeper to mimic the thrum of your heartbeat slowing at the muscle memory, the familiar feeling of\ncomfort\nthat stirs itself awake simply by being in the presence of Lucanis Dellamorte.\n\u201cAre you going to stand there all night, or do you want to come in?\u201d\nHis voice carries through the door once more, louder in his offering and closer than it had been a moment ago. A shuffle follows, giving away his next steps forward as they echo enough to slip through the cracks. This was, of course, for\nyou\n, this noise \u2013 you knew from experience how the Crow could remain unknown for as long as he chose.\nThe question haunts your mind, yet your limbs seem to melt from the paralysis that wove its way into your heart upon your arrival. It melted completely, hopelessly, miraculously at the sound of his voice, the lilt of Antiva dispelling any enchantment of the mind. The comfort of it twines with your bones, lungs, heart, blood \u2013 though it happens a little quicker than usual, when you he calls to you a third time.\nThis is something you\u2019ll allow for yourself, you think, if only for a night. Feet carry you the last step forward with a curled palm falling open to bring the wood creaking onward under your touch. You enter, steps soft but sure. He\u2019s already on his feet, remnants of his evening gathered in one hand instead of two. It\u2019s something small that registers, by the way he meets you halfway into the room when he sees your face upon turning the corner.\nWhile you see a beautiful man setting down his distractions, silhouette glowing ethereal in flickering candlelight, Lucanis sees the weight of the world still clinging to your shadow like the ghost of a memory unwanted, a dream dying and tainted and fraying at the edges. He reads\nanxiety\nin the tilt of your shoulders, and\nworry\nas it pulls down your mouth, imprisoning the magnetic smile that makes him forget his own name. He sees the weight of it all, and how, at least tonight, you want nothing more than to carry it\ntogether\nrather than bear all of this\nalone\n.\nLucanis Dellamorte may not be able to give you everything you want, but he\u2019ll always be able to give you\nthis\n.\n\u201cTalk to me,\u201d he says. The tone he chooses is the one that always inspires you to tell him anything and everything, everything and nothing at all. You see through his trick, but this is exactly why you\u2019re here, after all. And you do, eventually, talk to him \u2013 when you remember your voice is a living thing inside you, something to be used. In the seconds that follow, the moments you spend watching him after he speaks, however \u2013 everything is lost. It\u2019s a shock, almost, to hear such kindness, see the webs of something\nnew\nglimmer like morning dew in those gorgeous amber eyes. They always did seem to make you forget how to breathe.\nWhile you gather yourself, you miss the veiled urgency slipping into his movements, the way he\u2019s quick to discard the remaining blade in hand to reach for you-\nExcept he stops mid-step, mid-reach, hoping that he hasn\u2019t misread you, even though he knows he hasn\u2019t.\n\u201cI -\u201d you pause. Breathe. Dart eyes to a far corner of the room. A ragged sigh tears through the cage of your throat. \u201cI don\u2019t think I want to be alone tonight, and I \u2013 well. You said you\u2019re shit at sleeping. So.\u201d\nThe smile flashed in his direction makes his chest ache, brows falling together at the way its dimmed considerably, in the hours since he last had been graced at dinner. High voltage dwindled down to a barely glowing ember. He can\u2019t help but reach for you once more, distance closing breath by breath, beat by beat of his heart no longer steady because -\nSuddenly, you\u2019re reaching for one another at the same time, each a moth fluttering closer, closer,\ncloser\nto a flame that would ignite, burn, resurrect, or maybe even all of the above. This is something\nnew\n.\nIt\u2019s a welcome thing though, the way his hand curls around your arm solid and steady, while the other gently guides your chin to look at him, candle flames dancing among the concern settling heavily in the corners of his eyes, the downward tilt of his mouth. When you look at him after a moment of settling in to the feel of his touch \u2013 grounding, as it always is \u2013 a wisp of a smile plays softly upon his lips, a soft rumble rolls through his chest a moment later. The warmth of fingers feathered, still, along your jaw flutter to trail down your other arm.\nIt\u2019s impossible, not to stare. But you have to do\nsomething\n, because getting lost in the touch, in the nearness of Lucanis was not in the stars this night. They were not aligned for such a thing. Not yet.\nIt\u2019s impossible still, not to smile, as infectious as they are \u2013 those flashes of contentment he seems to feel around you.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he denies. Corrects. \u201cI believe I said I\ndidn\u2019t\nsleep. Not that I was\nshit\nat it.\u201d\n\u201cOh, mhm,\u201d you hum a laugh of your own, weak as it is. It shines through shadows curling around your shoulders, dissipating them little by little. \u201cSo you did. My apologies, Master Crow.\u201d\nLucanis allows you this jest, if only because of the turn the night has taken, but that does not stop the roll of his eyes or the groan that is so quick to answer your halfhearted laughter. He knows you well enough, now, to play along until you\u2019re loose enough to lay down the burdens of your heart \u2013 though perhaps tonight it may be done with a little help.\n\u201cCome now,\u201d he drawls, low and smooth and dripping a honeyed sweetness. The fingers cascading down your arm slow to a stop upon reaching your wrist, and curl gently around it with a squeeze. \u201cYou and I both know that\u2019s a lie, and it\u2019s never wise to lie to a Crow.\u201d\nThis time, the laugh spilling through your lips comes easier, echoing through the room with a reticent warmth, coaxed forth by this very pointed truth. Framing this sound is a smile, wider and real and radiant, as diminutive as it is. It lingers, even still, the knot in your stomach loosening if only a little, and a glimmer grows in your eyes with appreciation. Lucanis reads this \u2013 as you know he will \u2013 and, in turn, his own eyes soften\njust enough\nfor you to convey\nmessage received\n.\n\u201cCome,\u201d he says again, guiding you back towards the door. A steady hand falls to caress the small of your back, the smile painting your lips growing a little wider as it does. \u201cLet\u2019s get you something warm to drink.\u201d"
