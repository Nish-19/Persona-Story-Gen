        "story": "\u201cScars are just another kind of memory.\u201d - M.L. Stedman\nIt was his own stupid fault, Merlin thought grimly. His usual clumsiness and an unguarded moment was all it took.\nHe had been helping set up for Uther's latest stupid feast, and he'd slopped red wine all down the front of a blue tunic. In theory, he could have dismissed the stain with a spell, but the smell would have haunted him all evening. Arthur might know that all the time he was apparently in the tavern he was dealing with some magical crisis or other, but the same could not be said for the rest of the court. His reputation was bad enough as it was without adding fuel to that particular fire.\nHe'd ducked into one of the rooms where they stored the fresh laundry, pulling free a tunic he'd not yet collected before peeling himself free of the clinging fabric. The rustle of cloth meant he didn't hear the creak of the door, and the voice that rang out behind him made him jolt in surprise.\n'What happened to your back?'\nArthur's voice sounded tense, stiff and uncertain. The brush of warm fingers against the three, pale lines across his shoulder-blade made Merlin jolt in alarm. He whirled around, the tunic still clutched in his hands as he blinked stupidly, his words caught somewhere in his throat.\nNot that it mattered. Arthur was too busy staring at the starburst scar the size of a grown man's hand that lay right in the centre of his front, over his heart. A frown of confusion melted beneath a mask of horror, and Merlin swallowed hard as all the colour fled Arthur's face.\n'What happened to your chest?!'\n'Er...' Merlin winced, because although he had told Arthur about his magic \u2013 about everything he had done in his name, the good and the bad \u2013 he had rather glossed over some of the details. He hadn't done any of it for Arthur's gratitude, after all. He didn't need his thanks or his sympathy, but he couldn't deny that some of his choices had left their marks on his body for the world to see.\n'Why are you in here?' he managed, hoping to derail the conversation as he hastily tugged on the fresh garment, shoving his arms through the sleeves as he hid the scars from sight. 'Did you need something?'\n'I need you to tell me what happened.' Arthur's blue eyes snapped with an aimless, volatile sort of anger. His arms were folded across his chest, making his tunic strain at the shoulders, and the scowl on his brow suggested he wouldn't be easily swayed from his questioning. 'Merlin, who hurt you?'\n'It was ages ago. It doesn't matter.'\nHe went to duck around Arthur, mumbling something about the feast preparations. Yet before he got more than a few paces, strong fingers snagged his wrist. It wasn't a tight grip, Merlin could have broken free with ease, but he still came to heel like a dog obeying its master.\n'No, I'm not letting you leave,' he murmured, the rumble of his words sending a bolt of heat arcing down Merlin's spine. It snatched the air from his lungs, leaving him breathless and tense as Arthur turned him back around, shifting his grip to Merlin's shoulders as he stared into his eyes. 'Not until you tell me the truth. Who. Hurt. You?'\nThe anger in that expression wasn't aimed at him; Merlin knew that well enough. There was nothing Arthur hated more than feeling helpless. He was protective of his knights where Uther was dismissive of their loyalty and their sacrifice, but the gleam in his eye went beyond that. Dread had stolen the warmth from his face, and he was watching Merlin with the kind of intensity that some would find unnerving.\n'Sigan and his stupid gargoyles' \u2013 He jerked his thumb over his shoulder, indicating the scars on his back before tapping one finger over his heart \u2013 'Nimueh and a fireball.' They were such simple words for the horror of stony claws raking his back and the flash and burn of the incendiary spell that had hit him square in the chest, but in the end, they summed it up pretty neatly. 'It's fine, Arthur. They healed.'\nHe frowned, not understanding the expression on Arthur's face. The knights took injuries for him all the time, and while he praised their courage, he never looked like that \u2013 as if someone had reached into his guts and wrenched them out of him, leaving him hollow.\n'That's not the point.' Arthur's grasp moved from his shoulders, drifting down his arms to his hands. It was a soothing gesture, one Merlin wasn't even sure was consciously done. Yet even he could feel how Arthur's touch mapped the calluses on his palms and the small scars that were an apprentice healer's mark: tiny burns and the occasional slim white line where the herb-knife had slipped and sliced skin instead. Those didn't cause him any distress, and Merlin realised it was because they were expected: wounds received in the execution of his duties.\nDuties which, even knowing about his magic, Arthur clearly didn't realise involved protecting him with as much determination as any one of his knights.\n'You've got scars,' Merlin pointed out, thinking of the starburst from the Questing Beast's bite, among others.\n'I'm a knight. A prince.' He didn't add \"a target\"; he didn't have to. They were both thinking it. 'I've been trained to fight since I could walk. You... haven't.'\nMerlin snorted. That was an understatement. Still, he could practically see the spin of considerations in Arthur's head, and some magical sense forewarned him that if he didn't speak quickly, he'd find himself on the duelling field being beaten half-to-death in the name of \"practice\".\n'Wielding a sword wouldn't have saved me from either of these, and it's not like I can train in battle-spells, is it?' He shrugged one shoulder, unwilling to disturb Arthur's hand from where it still gripped his, tracing idle, tormenting little patterns against his skin. He didn't think Arthur realised what he was doing: how each caress made Merlin's breath come from deeper in his chest. It made his heart feel like it pumped hot honey, rather than blood, around his veins. 'It's not exactly discreet.'\nArthur pulled as face, but he didn't argue. It had been slow, steady work, getting him to see just how much damage the ban on magic had caused. Arthur would not care for his own sake: he was not interested in doing anything the easy way, but he was beginning to see how his people could suffer from its lack. Now, he looked at Merlin with fresh realisation. 'You can't learn how to defend yourself. Not without risking exposing your magic to all of Camelot.'\nIt was a flat statement of fact, one that he could not deny. It wasn't just that he could not practice; even studying the theory was a risky endeavour. As long as Uther still sat upon the throne, then Merlin had to work from the shadows and hope that he and Arthur both survived to see better days.\n'Armour.' Arthur said it softly. 'I cannot change the laws of Camelot, but there's is nothing to say a servant cannot wear armour. You could enchant it, couldn't you? Extra spells to protect you from magic. You've done it to mine.' One golden eyebrow lifted in challenge, as if daring Merlin to deny it. 'No one will question it. They know you come on almost every patrol with us, and more than one person has remarked upon the fact that you do not wear anything but the tunic on your back. Truthfully, I should have done something about that long before now.'\nMerlin pursed his lips. The rumours in court were already rife, and armour would just be another sign of his favour. Already, people noticed how Arthur let Merlin get away with disobedience that bordered on treason, sometimes, and they had taken note.\nIt was tempting to argue: to say he didn't need it. Armour wouldn't protect him from magical attacks, but he could see the desperation in Arthur's gaze. Those eyes had dipped to the laces of Merlin's tunic, as if envisioning the scar beneath. There was a haunted slant to his expression, as if he were imagining how that day could have ended.\nThe hand around Merlin's tightened, firm and sure, and when Arthur lifted his eyes once more, he looked resolute. 'I won't see you hurt again,' he said, speaking like a king laying down the law. 'Not if I can help it. One day, it will be different.' He swallowed. 'One day, you will be able to practice your magic without having to hide, but for now, let me help keep you safe. Please?'\nMerlin blinked, his heart heaving in a dizzying whirl. Arthur had never spoken of this before. He almost couldn't believe his ears, and he shifted where he stood, one hand reaching out as if he could pin Arthur's words \u2013 this very moment \u2013 motionless in place.\n'Do you mean it?' he rasped, trying to fight the urge to lean forward but unable to stop himself. 'You'll return magic to Camelot?'\n'Yes.' Arthur tilted his head to the side, a faint smile curving his lips at whatever he saw in Merlin's face. 'I swear it.'\nBeyond the door, the sounds of hurrying servants broke through the heavy air between them. It was enough to send a ripple of awareness through the tiny room \u2013 to make Merlin realise how close they stood to each other. All around them the balance of their friendship seemed to wobble, breathless, but it was Merlin, not Arthur, who stepped back in retreat.\n'I \u2013 I don't know what to say.' A grin spread over his face, bright and unstoppable. 'Thank you!'\nAnd if he hadn't already loved Arthur for more months than he cared to count \u2013 hidden and unacknowledged \u2013 he would have fallen there and then to see Arthur's bright, boyish grin light up the room.\n'You're welcome, Merlin.'\nBuckles chimed as Arthur slid them into place, sheathing Merlin in the armour he had commissioned. It was not the glittering mail and stalwart plate of his knights, but soft leather with scale pressed between: light and flexible, but strong enough to shield Merlin from the worst the world had to offer.\nHe wet his lips, looking up at him under his lashes as his pulse thrummed helplessly. The promise he had made still echoed in his mind. No doubt accompanied it; he would not go back on his word. Not after he'd seen the vicious light of hope lend its glow to Merlin's features.\nBesides, magic was not the only thing he planned to change when he took the throne. He could not admit how he felt for Merlin now, not while his father still lived and all the expectations of the court were against them. He would not make Merlin suffer that.\nInstead, he did what he could to protect the man who had stolen his heart. He would keep him safe in whatever way he could, and one day, he would be free to claim the love that Merlin promised him with every glance.\nThey would have their golden age, together. Arthur would make sure of it."

        "writing_prompt": "A scruffy young raven, outcast by her kin, takes up residence in your chambers, much to the dismay of your court. But as the bird grows into a striking and mischievous companion, you realize she may be more than just a pet\u2014she's family.",
        "story": "There was a tatty-feathered lump in the middle of the bed, trembling amidst the furs. One pale blue eye watched him, the pupil like a pinprick in the bright daylight, and Bilbo let out a little sigh. The ravens were, on the whole, meant to stay at Ravenhill. They received and delivered their messages via the birdmasters, and though he and Thorin were frequent visitors, ravens in the mountain itself were not looked upon kindly, by dwarf or bird. They were creatures of the open sky, after all. They were not fond of the earth's dark heart.\nThe only reason this one was here, he suspected, was because he'd left the doors open to the royal gardens, up on the peak. Though why it had made itself at home, rather than returning to its own kind, Bilbo could not be sure. Now he was left wondering what to do with the bird, which croaked at him and then said, in perfectly serviceable Westeron, 'No.'\n'I beg your pardon?' Bilbo goggled at it. The older ravens understood Khuzdul and spoke a bit of it. The birdmasters had been teaching the hatchlings both the dwarven language and Westeron, which implied this one was newly fledged. It still didn't explain why it chosen his bed as its roost. 'This isn't your home. Shoo!'\n'No.'\n'Yes!' Bilbo bit his lip. He wasn't going to reduce himself to arguing with a bird. Not even a raven, which were clever enough in the Shire and frightfully intelligent in the Lonely Mountain.\nHe was just contemplating bundling it up and releasing it back into the garden when a hesitant knock came at his door. It was not Balin's officious tapping, nor Dori's quick rat-a-tat-tat. Thorin and his sister-sons didn't bother to announce their presence, and Dis tended to call his name. No one among the Company sounded that uncertain, and Bilbo found himself face-to-face with Brinn, one of the bird-masters, hovering awkwardly on his threshold.\n'Your Majesty,' she managed, sounding as if she had run all the way here from Ravenhill. 'I apologise. I saw one of the ravens...'\nHe smiled, beckoning her in and gesturing through to the bedchamber. 'I discovered it a short while ago. It seems in no hurry to leave.'\nThe dwarf sighed: the long, exhausted sound of a person at their wit's end as she eyed the quivering, feathered body. 'Trix.' There as real grief in the dwarf's tone of voice, and Bilbo stepped forward.\n'What's wrong? Is the bird ill?'\n'No, no it's not that. She's one of this year's chicks. One of a large clutch. The others bully her: pluck out her feathers and steal her food. She's getting thinner by the day. I fear she's not long left for the world: that they'll drive her to her death. I tried to make her leave for the Greenwood, thinking she'd be safer, but...'\n'But she won't go.' Bilbo's heart crumpled in his chest. He knew what it was to be bullied. As a faunt he had been as troublesome as the other young hobbits, but as a tween he'd struggled to fit in. He had wondered if there was something fundamentally wrong with himself as the other hobbits his age shunned or mocked him. It was part of why the start of his quest with the Company had been so challenging. He'd felt like an outsider all over again, and not just because he was a hobbit among dwarves.\nLife was cruel, but Bilbo wasn't.\n'Let her stay. Get me some scraps of rabbit from the kitchen. I'll see her fed. Is she friendly?'\nBrinn shut her mouth with a snap, looking at him with uncertain eyes. 'Yes, Your Majesty, but...'\n'Then that settles it.' Bilbo nodded his head, just once, decisive, and tried to ignore the intensity of Brinn's doubtful gaze. 'Anything I should know?'\n'She'll foul outside. All the ravens have enough sense for that. She's \u2013 smart, even by Ravenhill standards. Won't King Thorin \u2013?'\n'Don't worry. You can leave him to me.' Bilbo offered her a reassuring smile. Thorin may complain, but he wouldn't deny Bilbo's wishes. Not in something such as this. Trix needed help, and Bilbo intended to give it.\nThat was that.\n******\nA year later, Bilbo sighed, jamming his hands on his hips and glaring at Trix. Gone were the scruffy, tatty feathers. Instead, she was a creature of striking beauty: jet black until the light struck her just so, at which point her feathers gleamed with beautiful iridescent purples and blues. Her pale eyes were far too knowing, currently half-closed with mischievous pleasure.\n'Did you hide it?' he demanded, throwing his hand in the air when she gave a crackling croak, and her reply escaped her, all innocence.\n'No.'\nShe knew hundreds of words and took spectacular delight in mimicking the dwarves of the Company with eerie accuracy. Yet still, her favourite thing to say was the word she had first uttered to Bilbo.\n'Yes you did. Don't think you can lie to me,' he grumbled. One of Trix's favourite games was finding a random hole or gap, and then carefully selecting an object that would fit in it. He spent far too much of his time crawling around retrieving his possessions from where she'd dropped them down the back of the furniture.\nShe chortled in a striking mimicry of Dis when she'd heard a bawdy joke and took off from the back of the chair, flaring her wings before swooping up onto his shoulder. Her claws dug into the reinforced fabric patches that Dori had sewn into Bilbo's jacket, and he reached up to stroke her breast gently with the back of his finger. 'Leave the beads,' he warned, knowing she would pluck free his braids in no time and make off with the precious, glimmering stones that adorned his curls. 'I don't have time to do them again. Bard's coming.'\nThat pleased Trix, who jumped up and down on his shoulder, making him grunt. She may only be a bird, but she was a full-grown raven, sizeable and no small burden. She liked Bard almost as much as she liked Bilbo, though her affection for both of them paled in comparison to her unholy devotion to Thorin.\nNot that Bilbo blamed her. He could see why. Besides, the feeling was mutual. After three days of protests upon her arrival, all of Thorin's disapproval had been proved little but a front when Bilbo caught him cradling Trix in his arms like a house cat and scratching the crown of her head. Now, the two of them were rarely separated. She even joined him in the bath!\nThe thud of the door announced Thorin's arrival, and Bilbo huffed as Trix abandoned him for her more favoured perch. He had to admit, her presence did lend a certain sinister gravitas to Thorin's appearance, especially at court, when they both looked equally serious and dour. Now, however, they were simply being foolish. Thorin lavished attention on Trix as she gurgled and crooned in appreciation, raking her beak through his long hair and rearranging it more to her liking.\n'Sometimes I think you love that bird more than me,' Bilbo grumbled, but he was smiling while he said it.\n'Definitely not,' Thorin promised, placing a satchel in the arm-chair before scratching beneath Trix's beak. 'She may be a close second, however. She is more intelligent than all my council combined.'\n'I'm telling them you said that,' Bilbo warned, though, to be fair, he was fairly sure the council, which was comprised almost entirely of the Company, would agree. 'You only love her so much because the last time Thranduil visited, she stole all the berries from his crown one by one.'\nThorin grinned at the memory, a bright, boyish expression that made him look decades younger, though his denial followed on swift-wing. 'I liked her before that.' He tilted his head, looking Bilbo up and down, no doubt taking in his harried expression. 'What has she stolen this time?'\n'My crown.' Bilbo glared at Trix, who rattled her beak at him. 'I can't show up without it. Everyone will think you've demoted me.'\nThorin wrapped an arm around Bilbo's waist, steering him around so that the kiss he bestowed upon him slanted deliciously across his lips. It was hot and toe-curling, and if they weren't about to be late for a very important feast for visiting dignitaries, Bilbo would happily have given up his search and dragged Thorn into bed. Instead, he broke away with a faint whimper of regret, already shaking his head.\n'Thorin...'\n'She didn't take your crown,' he murmured, stepping back and reaching into the bag he'd deposited on his arrival. The glimmer of mithril and gold in his hand was familiar, and Bilbo sighed, shaking his head in confusion.\n'You had it?' What were you doing with it?'\nThorin held it out, waiting for Bilbo to take it carefully in his grasp. 'You've heard what they've taken to calling us, these past few months?'\nBilbo huffed. 'They call\nyou\nthe Raven King,' he murmured.\n'It's not just me who has earned that moniker. You know Trix always accompanies us in court. I thought perhaps we should make something of it.' He rested his fingers over a new engraving amidst the oak leaves and acorns.\nHis crown matched Thorin's, smaller only so that it would fit his head. And there, amidst the bower of the branches, was an etched raven, its feathers subtly darkened to pewter.\nThorin took it from his grasp, resting it upon Bilbo's head. The weight was significant, but not as bad as it could have been: the mithril made sure of that. It meant Bilbo had no difficulty holding his head high, and he could bear witness to the hot, lustful look Thorin sent his way: something both proud and proprietary that never failed to steal Bilbo's breath away.\n'Perfect.'\nWith a faint croon of interest, Trix swooped back to Bilbo's shoulder, bobbing up and down before her beak tapped, oh-so-carefully, against the rendition of herself in the metal. 'Good,' she said, firm and proud, as determined as any queen, and Bilbo laughed, ruffling her feathers before sweeping them gently back into place.\nWhen he looked back at Thorin, it was to see the matching crown upon his brow, with an identical embellishment at the right temple, where anyone who glanced his way could see it. The sight of him, finely dressed and perfectly regal, was enough to make Bilbo's heart flutter in his ribs, and he reached out for Thorin's hand, entwining their fingers.\n'Are you ready?' Thorin asked, waiting for Bilbo's firm nod before he gestured towards the door of their chamber. 'Then, shall we?'\nAnd as they departed to see to their duties, Trix took up her perch on Thorin's shoulder: no longer a bullied hatchling outcast from her kin, but as treasured part of Erebor's court, known and respected by all.\nShe had found her flock, featherless as they were, and she would never leave them."

        "story": "Frigid air ached in his lungs, burning all the way down as Merlin huddled deeper into his coat. It was a frost-cracked, star-struck night. The moon's crescent smirked, low and fat on the horizon, and every breath escaped him in a cloud of steam. A north wind sliced through Camelot, whipping around the street corners. It was as sharp as any blade, and he flinched from it as the braziers guttered and danced.\nAnyone with an ounce of common sense would be safe indoors, stoking the fires high and curling up in a nice, warm bed. Gaius had, at least, sounded apologetic when he'd sent him out gathering frostwort: a delicate flower of potent properties that only bloomed on nights such as this.\nHe had filled Merlin's pockets with roasted chestnuts, now long gone, and promised to stoke the fire high for him. Still, that didn't change the fact that he was numb to the bone, and his poky little room in Gaius tower was a long way from the hearth. It would be warm only in comparison, and he grimly resolved to put on every piece of clothing he owned before he climbed under his blankets.\nThe cobbles of the courtyard had turned treacherous, each rounded stone capped with ice. He had to pick his way across, and more than once he almost slipped to smash himself on the unforgiving ground. Not that he would feel it, numb as he was. He could see the glow of candles from Arthur's chambers, and a flicker of a frown crossed his brow. He'd handed off his duties to George. Even Arthur couldn't argue that his comfort trumped the medical needs of the populace. Still, he would have expected him to be in bed by now.\nHis ears ached and his face felt stiff. Even his eyelashes were strangely brittle. He winced and swore his way up the castle steps, gasping gratefully as the stone edifice sheltered him from the clutching fingers of the wretched wind. The soldiers on guard were huddled in the cradle of the arch, and they both shot him sympathetic looks as he stamped his feet and chafed his palms together before giving up and sticking his fingers under his armpits.\n'The prince requests your presence in his chambers.'\nGeorge at least managed to sound apologetic as he emerged from the shadows, his hand held out to take the bag of herbs from Merlin's possession. 'I'll see that these get to Gaius.'\n'Thanks,' Merlin managed, wincing as the word slurred through his lifeless lips. 'Any idea what he wants?'\n'I'm afraid not. He has been tended for the night but he seemed \u2013 out of sorts.'\nMerlin managed a grunt. He didn't much relish the idea of Arthur in a mood. His body wasn't the only thing frozen stiff. His mind felt like an icy river, glassy and motionless. The few thoughts he did have moved achingly slow in his thick skull. More than anything, he wanted to climb into a nest of blankets and stay there until spring. Instead, he bullied himself up the sweeping staircase towards the royal chambers, grumbling as he went.\nThe castle may be out of the wind, but the masonry was tomb-cold. The torches, candles and braziers were small pools of fleeting warmth in the long corridors. Merlin flitted from one to the next, lingering as long as he dared in their brief respite. It meant by the time he arrived at Arthur's chamber door, he had only been shown a brief flavour of what it was to be warm: enough to set the shivers marching through his so fiercely that every breath stuttered.\nHis fingers felt sausage-thick around the latch as he shouldered his way inside, shutting the door in his wake and trying not to whine in relief as warm air folded around him like a cocoon. The fire had been stoked high and tended for what must have been hours. Arthur's chambers were not as grand as the King's, but nor were they modest. In the winter they sprouted extra rugs on the flagstones and additional blankets on the bed: all the comforts a prince would require. Merlin was almost sick with envy.\n'Took you long enough.' Arthur complained, rising from where he was sat in his fur-draped chair. He wore a long sleep tunic and a pair of plain breeches. His feet were unshod, with only thick socks to protect his toes as he strode towards Merlin. Firm hands grabbed his shoulders, bullying him and shoving him every closer to the hearth before practically man-handling him down onto the rug in front of the roaring blaze.\n'I had to get \u2013'\n'Frostwort. I know. George was very thorough in informing as to me why you were not attending your duties.'\nThere was a heavy dose of reproach in Arthur's words, but his heart didn't seem to be in it. If he meant to chastise Merlin for leaving George to deliver the bad news, then he missed his mark. It was enough to make Merlin consider him from beneath his thawing lashes, reading all the little signs he suspected Arthur didn't want him to see.\nA couple of years as his man-servant meant that Merlin had swiftly learned to look beneath Arthur's words. His lips often said one thing while his expression said another. His actions often embellished the truth, rather than contradicted it. Now, he saw how that brow was furrowed with more concern than genuine annoyance, and how Arthur was looking him over like he was a horse at market, more than a little bit critical of what he was seeing.\n'What?' he managed defensively, stretching out his hands towards the flames as a fresh shiver rumbled through him from head to foot.\n'Did you go out in that?' He gestured to Merlin in general, indicating his outfit.\n'Yeah,' he replied, dragging out the word. 'They're my clothes?'\nArthur made an angry noise in the back of his throat: a brief pulse of sound before he turned to the table, pouring himself some wine. A moment later, he hunkered down at Merlin's side, gripping his wrist and pressing something into his palm. Merlin blinked stupidly at the metal cup and the rich, red drink steaming softly within its confines.\n'Drink it,' Arthur ordered, like a prat. 'It'll warm you up. If I send you off to Gaius' now, you'll wake up with a cold and be no use to anyone.'\nMerlin hid his grin behind the rim as he lifted it to his lips, obligingly taking a sip and closing his eyes as the hot drink warmed him from his belly outwards. It was a blessing. He felt like he was slowly coming back to life, and he savoured the rich flavour of spiced wine.\nIt was not the first time that they had shared a drink in front of the fire. It had happened more and more, these past few months, as Arthur sought to work through the latest challenges of the court. Merlin didn't flatter himself in believing he wished for his advice, though he offered it anyway. Sometimes Arthur even listened.\nThis was different, though. Arthur didn't seem to be lost in the latest diplomatic entanglement or plotting how to get the best out of a new batch of knights. Instead, he was watching Merlin as he sipped from his own cup, his expression calm but for the hint of worry that clouded his gaze. More than once, he parted his lips as if to say something, but each time he swallowed his words back.\n'Thanks,' Merlin managed when the cup was almost empty. His voice sounded rough to his own ears. Now that he was warming up, he felt heavy and lethargic. He loathed the idea of stepping outside of the haven of Arthur's rooms and into the frigid hallways with all his heart. 'I needed that. It was colder out there than I thought.'\n'Did you actually think before you went wandering off into the woods in the middle of one of the coldest nights of the year?' Arthur looked at him sharply, his eyebrows raised. 'You didn't even take a cloak. It's not like there aren't plenty going spare.'\n'It would have been more trouble than its worth in the woods. They get tangled on things!'\n'Gloves, then!' Arthur gestured to his fingers, which had turned bright pink as the heat came back to them. 'You must have some!'\n'Not... really?' Merlin pulled a face. Gloves were something that every member of the court had, fine things of leather and nubuck, elegant and lined with fleece. Gaius had a knitted pair with no fingers to help ease the ache the cold brought to his knuckles without limiting his dexterity. They were old and tatty, falling to pieces, and his need was far greater than Merlin's. 'It's all right, Arthur. I'm fine. I'm all warmed up now. See?'\nArthur managed to convey with a mere look how much he disbelieved Merlin's claim. 'You're still shivering.'\nMerlin pursed his lips, not quite able to stifle the way his body had stirred itself into a fine, all-over tremble. It was as if it had been reminded of heat and was now lodging its protests that it had been made to suffer.\n'Stay there.' Arthur commanded, setting his empty cup aside and getting to his feet. 'You can go when your nose has returned to a normal colour. It's practically glowing.'\nHe moved with the same steady grace as always as he padded across the room, leaning over his desk and reaching for his quill. Gods alone knew what kind of paperwork he had to be doing at this time of night, but Merlin didn't argue. Instead, he drew his knees up to his chest, draping his forearms over their peaks and propping his chin atop them.\nHe watched Arthur through drooping lashes, admiring the way the firelight played across his skin and struck sunlight through his hair. The sleep tunic he wore was hardly the sturdiest garment. It clung to his shoulders and hung open at the laces, revealing strong collar bones and the golden hair that gleamed, downy, upon Arthur's chest. It was nothing Merlin hadn't seen before when he helped Arthur with his bath, and yet there was something almost coy about the sight: artless and appealing.\nMerlin huffed, shoving those thoughts down as he had numerous times in the past. Arthur may be a prat, but there was no denying that he was easy on the eyes: a classic golden prince \u2013 Camelot's pride and joy.\nIt was all most people ever saw: a valiant knight who would one day be their king, with all the arrogance that went with such expectation. They never witnessed Arthur's uncertainty or regret, nor his well-hidden compassion. Arthur had been trained all his life to see caring as a weakness, yet it had not made him hard or cold. Instead, he showed his care in stealthy, subtle ways, like plying a freezing manservant with warmed wine.\nThe thought made Merlin smile, warmed more by Arthur's action than the alcohol slipping softly through his veins. He barely noticed his eyes drifting shut, nor the deepening lethargy sweeping over him. At some, dim point, he thought he sensed a hand on his shoulder, something urging him to lie down on the thick rug before the hearth. Someone murmured something, but he hadn't the strength to do more than grumble in response. A weight settled over him, and the smell of clean wool filled his nose.\nThere was a moment of breathless hesitation before a warm hand rested in his hair, ruffling it with exceptional care. The bit of Merlin that clung onto the waking world by its fingertips knew that it was Arthur. If he so much as twitched, Arthur would flee like a deer bolting from a hunter. Instead, he kept his breathing slow and steady, hovering on the cusp of blissful oblivion as a whisper reached his ears, so achingly tender that he could almost believe it was nothing but a hopeful, desperate dream.\n'Goodnight, Merlin.'\nA week later, there was a large bundle for Merlin sitting on the workbench in the healing rooms. A fine, long coat made of dark-dyed wool, and a pair of hide gloves lined with rabbit fur.\nHe wasn't sure what warmed him more: the garments designed to keep winter's worst bite at bay, or the subtle, crooked smile that tilted Arthur's lips the first time he saw Merlin wearing them."

        "writing_prompt": "When Bilbo Baggins left the Shire for his grand adventure, Lobelia Sackville-Baggins saw an opportunity to claim Bag End for herself. But when news of Bilbo's unexpected fate reaches Hobbiton, her plans\u2014and her pride\u2014are thrown into chaos.",
        "story": "The Shire had never known such fuss as it did the day Bilbo Baggins went tearing out of the door on his so-called adventure. It was like a great boulder falling into a calm pool, sending shock-waves throughout Hobbiton. His was the name on everyone's lips, and their whispers teetered wildly between envy and disdain. Who would have thought it? The staid, sensible Baggins boy, losing his head like that and dashing off in the company of\ndwarves?\nLobelia sniffed, idly checking her reflection in a polished pan at the market stall and adjusting the plume on her hat. It was a foofaraw: as if anyone cared about what became of him! He had been living by himself in that massive Smial for decades now, hoarding the family silver and content in his confirmed bachelorhood.\nNo, Bilbo Baggins could saunter off into the great wide world and never come back, for all she cared. That branch of the family had always been odd. Too much Took, perhaps. Better for the Shire as a whole that they were no longer skulking up on that hill while everyone else fooled themselves into thinking that they were respectable.\nShe smiled to herself. Respectable hobbits did not rush off without warning. They did not abandon pride and property to hare off over the horizon with barely a word to anyone. He'd left no instruction about Bag End. She doubted he'd even paused to clean out the pantry!\nWell, she would see to that. She would step forth as a benevolent custodian to the place (and the family silver). A year and a day; that was all she needed. If Bilbo Baggins did not set foot back in the Shire in that time, then he would lose all legal claim, and she would be perfectly positioned to swoop in and take possession.\nFor the good of the community, of course.\nIf she had thought that the West Farthing was making a fuss about nothing the day Bilbo Baggins left, it paled in comparison to the uproar that swept through the land the day they were delivered news of his fate. People were meeting in the lane \u2013\nin the lane!\n\u2013 to talk about it, as if they were common farmers without a parlour between them! His was the name on every pair of flapping lips, and each time the tale reached her ear it had only seemed to grow more outlandish: armies and dragons, elves and orcs!\nAs if Bilbo Baggins had the courage to say boo to a goose!\n'Ah, Lobelia. There you are.'\nShe paused with one hand on the gate to Bag End, her chest heaving from her fast-march along the road to check on the Smial, as she did every day. There were a mere three weeks remaining before she could lay a legal claim.\nIt had been an exercise of patience to don the mask of a concerned relative and say she was tending it in Bilbo's absence while she kept an eye on what would soon be hers. Now, she found the Mayor of Michel Delving standing at her front door, along with Primula Baggins and her husband Drogo.\nBitter unease unfurled through her chest, and she pinned a smile upon her face that felt more like a snarl.\n'Mayor! What brings you here?'\nHe looked at her with twinkling eyes that suggested her affable mask was not as well-placed as she might like. He was a Bolger, on his mother's side, she recalled. Far too sharp for anyone's comfort.\n'The matter of Bag End. You see, we have received a letter from Master Bilbo Baggins as to his likely permanent absence from the Shire. It includes instruction from him with regard the dispersal of his assets.' The mayor smiled as if he were enjoying a good joke as he pulled a sheaf of papers from his breast pocket. 'He has included an itemised list. I am here to offer my personal thanks for your custodianship of the property and to inform you that your services will no longer be required.'\nA strangled protest caught in Lobelia's throat. The collar of her blouse felt far too tight, and her grip on the gate-post threatened to crack the aged wood. 'Instruction?' she wheezed, 'But \u2013'\n'It was a true kindness for you to step forward and take care of Master Baggins' property in his absence, unasked,' the mayor continued breezily. 'But now that it seems he has chosen to stay in Erebor with his husband, the matter of the dispersal of his holdings must be put to rest in line with his wishes.'\n'Husband?' She squinted, her bonnet wobbling precariously as she tilted her head. 'I didn't hear anything about a husband...'\n'Ah, yes.' The mayor retrieved his monocle, squinting down at the papers before him and moving a ribbon to one side, careful not to disturb the hefty seal that swung from it like a pendulum. Behind him, Primula Baggins smothered a smile, as if she were enjoying the wretched man's performance. It was clear he had no need to check the identity of this so-called husband. Officious, bothersome busybody of a bureaucrat!\n'One King of Erebor, Thorin II. It seems that Bilbo's adventure had a happy ending, for all those who deserved such things.' Something sharp glinted in the mayor's gaze, and Lobelia was abruptly reminded that the Bolgers had been nursing a ridiculous feud with the Sackvilles over a tract of land that no Bolger could prove any rightful claim to, because the Sackvilles had \"mislaid\" the paperwork.\nAs was their prerogative.\n'Bag End is to go to Bilbo's closest surviving relatives, Drogo and Primula Baggins, as are all the contents therein, and anything that may have been removed from the premises during his absence. He has charged me with seeing this matter to its resolution.'\n'We just need the keys, Lobelia,' Primula said, her youthful face all smiling innocence and hidden cunning. She was a Brandybuck before she was married: out for all they could get. Then there was Drogo, who gave the impression of being an affable, easy-going young man. He had watched the whole exchange in placid silence, and now he met her gaze with neither expectation or accusation.\nTry as she might, she could see no way out of it. Perhaps if Primula and Drogo had merely attempted to claim the smial as theirs, she could have fought it. Yet without the rule of law, there was no civilisation, and she could not very well lean on it herself one day only to turn her nose up at it the next. Not without gaining the kind of reputation that put even a hobbit to shame.\nShe considered it, though. For long moments, she contemplated her options. She thought of a hobbit, in the singular, who had lived in a smial big enough for a family of twelve while she and Otho had made do. She thought of her reputation, which carried its own share of tarnish. She knew what people said behind her back, as if they weren't all as greedy as each other, and for once in her life she chose the wiser course.\nThe key felt light in her hand as she handed it over to Primula, placing it neatly in to her waiting palm. It was not surrender, she told herself. Not precisely. It was a tactical retreat. Perhaps, in time, Bag End would come to her regardless.\n'Thank you,' Primula murmured, closing her fingers around the key before ducking her head. 'There was one other thing Cousin Bilbo said. He knows you always admired the family silver. He wanted you to have it, with his thanks.'\nA waspish retort that Bilbo Baggins had never offered her a word of thanks in his life hovered on the tip of her tongue, but she swallowed it back, inclining her head as Primula stepped inside to retrieve the box. It settled, heavy, in Lobelia's arms, and in its weight she wondered if she felt something like an ending.\nShe had spent most of her life helplessly resenting Bilbo Baggins, and yet here she was, in the Shire still, while he had moved on to better things. Maybe, in the end, there was nowhere else either of them would rather be. Her, here, in the land she had always called her home, and him, in far off parts, where every day was another little adventure.\nIn the privacy of her head, she grudgingly wished him well, and then went home to polish up the silver."
