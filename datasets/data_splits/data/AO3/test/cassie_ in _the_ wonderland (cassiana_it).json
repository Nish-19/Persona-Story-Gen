        "writing_prompt": "At a grand feast celebrating the alliance between Rohan and Gondor, \u00c9omer, the proud King of the Mark, finds himself seated beside Loth\u00edriel, the sharp-witted and captivating daughter of Imrahil. Amidst subtle glances, unspoken tensions, and a buttery apple turnover, their fates begin to intertwine\u2014will duty or desire prevail?",
        "story": "On the terraces of the Citadel, a gentle breeze wafted through the air. Low tables, large cushions, and thick carpets were arranged with care, the linen cloths embroidered with the symbols of Rohan, and the white muslin of Gondor reflected the sunlight. Upon them lay silver platters filled with simple yet delightful fare: savory pies, salads of fresh fruit, slices of seed bread dipped in Dol Amroth's oil, portions of roast with a crisp crust, and morsels of spiced meat. Carafes of refreshing juices, white and red wine, sweet ratafia, and sparkling mead glimmered in the sun. Some elvish silk drapes had been stretched between decorated poles adorned with ribbons and red vine tendrils to provide shade for the guests.\nNot long before, the Citadel had been animated by a grand parade of Gondorian warriors, their silver armor shining beneath the warm autumn sun, and their long pikes reflecting rays of light. The Rohirrim knights had demonstrated their valor in a jousting exhibition: their powerful and agile steeds moved with perfect precision and grace, while the riders showcased their legendary equestrian mastery. Following this, the elegant knights of Dol Amroth glided onto the scene, their capes billowing like sails, as some sailors from the maritime realm displayed their skill in knot and rigging games, throwing ceremonial ropes and nets into the air, amidst the admiring applause of the spectators.\nThroughout the ceremony, \u00c9omer had maintained a composed expression, befitting a King of the Mark. Yet, every so often, his gaze inevitably slipped towards the beautiful daughter of Imrahil. Her attire, rich as befitted a princess, was of refined simplicity. The silver and blue cloak fluttered lightly in the breeze, occasionally revealing the amber skin of her shoulders, and, Bema help him, a generous portion of her collarbones. But it was Loth\u00edriel's face that truly captured \u00c9omer's attention: her bright eyes and full lips seemed to hide a secret smile.\nLoth\u00edriel, for her part, did not fail to notice the fleeting yet fervent glances the King of Rohan cast her way. She felt flattered, intrigued by the contrast between his imposing presence and the apparent shyness that shone through his gestures. Gracefully, she offered him a few subtle smiles, hoping that \u00c9omer would grasp the message hidden behind her composure. He was no Boromir, of course, and she would never forget him. However, there was something about this warrior king that reminded her of him, and she was ready to give him a chance. Her father had hinted at a promise, and Loth\u00edriel, fully aware of the role she was meant to play from birth, intended to honor it to the best of her ability. If the sovereign she was destined for was to be that proud barbarian king, well, she would not be intimidated.\nLater, after the horses and their riders had been refreshed, the foot soldiers and sailors found respite, and every noble of the court had settled at the long, informal low tables prepared for the feast, \u00c9omer was called loudly by the Dol Amrothian brothers with whom he had forged a sincere friendship as well as a steadfast military alliance. With a nod of his head, King Elassar gave his consent, and so \u00c9omer found himself seated right next to Loth\u00edriel. Perhaps it was mere coincidence, or perhaps not: Imrahil's knowing smile did not entirely escape him, making him suspect that the princess's family had orchestrated the meeting. In any case, he preferred it this way: he felt more at ease among the jovial and witty knights of Dol Amroth than among the pompous and haughty nobles of Gondor. Not to mention, it had the undeniable advantage of sitting next to the princess. It mattered little if the prince\u2014her father\u2014had had a hand in it. He continued to watch her as she laughed and conversed animatedly with her brothers, revealing more of her sharp wit and undeniable beauty. Though distracted by the charms of his neighbor, \u00c9omer still managed, albeit with some difficulty, to respond to the jests of his newfound friends. At one point, one of the guests offered Loth\u00edriel another glass of ratafia, and before she could accept, \u00c9omer interjected in a measured tone:\n\u201cSurely the princess would prefer a glass of fresh spring water.\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel was taken aback and, without allowing the others to hear, whispered with a tone betraying her displeasure:\n\u201cI thank my lord for his concern, but you are not a relative to whom I must account for my libations.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, I am not your kin.\"\nA \u201c\nnot yet\n\u201d lingered between them for a moment, an unspoken tension that vibrated the air with unexpressed possibilities. Realizing he had overstepped, \u00c9omer made an embarrassed grimace and replied:\n\"Please forgive my intrusion.\u201d\nIt was for this reason that \u00c9omer, to ease the atmosphere, offered her a delicacy typical of Rohan: a buttery apple turnover.\n\u201cI recall you particularly enjoyed it when you had the chance to taste it.\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel immediately understood that it was a gesture of peace, a way to apologize and to convey that his attentions were sincere. She took a bite, and when \u00c9omer saw her tongue licking the filling from her lips, he felt a shiver run down his spine. He struggled to maintain his composure, but within him, he was nearly going mad: may Bema help him, that girl would be his undoing!"

        "writing_prompt": "Late at night, the King of Rohan and his queen sneak into the pantry for a forbidden snack, only to find that stealing cured venison is far more complicated\u2014and far more amusing\u2014than they anticipated.",
        "story": "If anyone\u2014a kitchen boy, a maid, or, Eru forbid, even the housekeeper Wynhild\u2014had wandered near the pantry in the quiet hour just before dawn, they would have heard a muffled exchange from the depths of the storeroom:\n\u201cTry shifting this bowl here\u2026\u201d\n\u201cEasy, you\u2019re you're on me.\u201d\n\u201cOh, does that bother you, my lady?\u201d\n\u201cGet off me; I can\u2019t pull it out!\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps if you lean a little this way\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt won\u2019t fit\u2026 it\u2019s too big!\u201d\n\u00c9omer let out a quiet chuckle, at which Loth\u00edriel, half-crouched within the pantry shelf and half outside it, rolled her eyes with a huff.\n\u201cValandil, you\u2019re so childish.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m the King of Rohan, you know!\u201d\n\u201cA twelve-year-old king, apparently.\u201d\nThe two figures were rather indecently close, barefoot and dressed only in light nightclothes. They had ventured into the kitchens with the hope of finding them still deserted for a late-night snack or an early breakfast. With uncharacteristic gentleness, \u00c9omer shifted his wife\u2019s warm figure, promising himself to show her more vigorous attentions later.\n\u201cLet me do it. There it is\u2026 if I just pull like this\u2026\u201d\nWith a heavy thud, \u00c9omer tumbled backward, and Loth\u00edriel stifled a snicker. He quickly scrambled up, rubbing his bruised rear, but soon raised in triumph the cause of their entire escapade:\n\u201cBehold, my dear: an authentic roll of cured venison, made by the skilled hands of our spice masters. No need to thank me for such a delicacy.\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel watched her royal husband with a half-incredulous, half-amused smile, as he held the large salami with the pride of a merchant at the autumn fair. All of this because they had engaged in a lighthearted debate over the delicacies of their respective homelands, and \u00c9omer had insisted on making her taste his beloved homeland treat without delay, as though he himself had crafted it. Now holding his prize, \u00c9omer took her hand and said:\n\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d\nHis large, bare feet thudded heavily along the wooden planks of the hallways, while Loth\u00edriel tiptoed behind him, her thin nightgown fluttering in her wake. Once safely behind their chamber door, \u00c9omer let out a relieved sigh.\n\u201cThank B\u00e9ma that Wynhild didn\u2019t catch us, or she\u2019d have given me a hard time, king or not.\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel laughed at the thought; in truth, the old housekeeper of Edoras scared her, though Wynhild had been nothing but sweet and kind to her.\n\u201cBut have we gotten the servants into trouble? I\u2019d hate to think someone else might pay for our, well, indiscretions.\u201d\n\u00c9omer, who had already taken a hearty bite of the salami and was chewing contentedly, paused to think. To Loth\u00edriel, he looked like a great golden-haired squirrel with the morsel stuffed in one cheek. How he could be both a fierce warrior and a wise sovereign as well, was a mystery she had yet to solve. His voice came out muffled as he swallowed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, but if it ever gets out, I\u2019ll say the sweet Queen of the Mark was struck by an irresistible craving for spiced meat in the dead of night\u2014and who would deny anything to the future mother of the next royal heir?\u201d\nHe crossed his arms, looking quite pleased with his idea, but Loth\u00edriel\u2019s eyes widened at the bold lie, and she covered her face with her hand, foreseeing trouble ahead."

        "writing_prompt": "A sea princess, now queen of a landlocked kingdom, finds herself torn between the rolling waves of her past and the endless green fields of her future. How does she navigate her new life, her love, and the call of two worlds?",
        "story": "\u00c9omer stood by the window of the royal chamber, gazing out but not truly seeing the rooftops of Edoras below. The cool morning breeze brushed against his bare chest, raising the fine golden hairs upon his skin. Unbothered by the chill or the goosebumps it caused, he turned to look upon his bride. Loth\u00edriel was still nestled in the soft bedding of their marriage bed, dark curls spilling over her peaceful face. Her breathing was deep and steady, a clear sign that she remained in the depths of slumber. \u00c9omer\u2019s eyes softened, his lips curving into a gentle smile. He cast his gaze back to the fortress-city his ancestors had built, as the first sounds of harnesses clinking reached his ears, mingling with the early calls of birds and the murmurs of soldiers and workers beginning their day.\nA soft murmur from the bed furrowed the king\u2019s brow, and he turned once more to Loth\u00edriel. She had shifted, her golden arms draped across the white pillows, the sheet tangled around her waist. A corner of the thick blanket had slipped to the floor, revealing the chubby curve of her thigh. \u00c9omer licked his lips, wondering if he had been too rough or too eager the night before. He had tried to be gentle, mindful of her inexperience, but despite his efforts to please her, he had found himself unable to resist the urge to sink deeply into the warmth of her womb, drinking of her honeyed lips like a man dying of thirst.\nLost in the memory, he did not hear the soft rustle of the sheets as a small, cool hand slipped into his own, large and warm.\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep, or is this the hour you rise? Perhaps I should begin your day, as befits my new role as wife?\u201d\n\u201cLoth, no. You are queen now; you may return to your rest if you wish.\u201d\n\u00c9omer brought her hand to his lips with a smile, pressing a chaste kiss to her fingertips. He gazed at her with eyes bright with desire. She was so beautiful, partially covered by the white sheet, glowing like the dawn veiled in mist. The sight stole his breath, but his brow furrowed for a moment.\n\u201cAre you\u2026 well? Was your rest sufficient?\u201d\nHe feared to ask if she felt any discomfort, or if his passion had displeased her in any way. Loth\u00edriel adjusted the sheet around her bare body, suddenly shy at the memory of the night. She bit her lower lip, trying to hide a small, satisfied smile.\n\u201cMy sleep was more than\u2026 satisfactory, my lord.\u201d\n\u201c\u00c9omer. Only \u00c9omer.\u201d\n\u201cOnly \u00c9omer. I was very tired, perhaps you had something to do with that.\u201d\nThey both smiled. Loth\u00edriel turned toward the window, her profile framed against the dark wood of the walls, her gaze taking in the same landscape her husband had absently observed only moments before. From their high vantage point, they could see the green pastures dotted with white flowers, stretching endlessly toward the distant mountains. Just then, a gust of wind rippled across the grassy plains, making the white blossoms dance like foam on the waves.\n\u201cSo, this is my new land,\u201d Loth\u00edriel murmured. \u201cSo different, so green.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you will reign over its people and herds alongside me.\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel did not answer, her gaze still fixed on the wind-swept fields.\n\u201cIt looks like a sea, though so different from the one I used to watch from my windows in Dol Amroth. Yet no less vast, no less dangerous, and worthy of love and respect all the same.\u201d\n\u00c9omer\u2019s brows knit together, a thorn of worry pricking his heart.\n\u201cDo you long for home, Sea Princess?\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel shook her head and placed her hand over \u00c9omer\u2019s chest. She smiled softly and replied,\n\u201cMy home is here: wherever your heart is, there my dwelling shall be.\u201d\n\u00c9omer felt his worries melt away, his features softening into a smile as tenderness filled his heart. He gathered Loth\u00edriel into his arms, capturing her lips in a loving kiss."

        "writing_prompt": "A young \u00c9omer, determined to prove himself, sets out to tame the most unruly and untamable horse in the stables\u2014a fiery stallion named Firefoot. But will his stubbornness and ingenuity be enough to win the trust of the proud beast?",
        "story": "\u00c9omer groaned as he lowered his bruised limbs into the icy water of the tub outside the barracks. He was one of the most promising riders of his generation, or so Commander Elfhelm had told his cousin Th\u00e9odred. \u00c9omer hadn\u2019t meant to eavesdrop, but nonetheless, his young chest had swelled with pride upon hearing it.\nBut now the bruises covering much of his body painfully reminded him that he had yet to tame a horse of his own. The water was cold, but his mind burned with frustration. He had failed to tame Firefoot, and the defeat weighed more heavily than the blows he had taken.\nA group of young riders passed by, laughing and joking, their faces already alight with the prospect of an evening in the tavern. One of them, a tousle-haired youth, glanced his way and laughed.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to bury my face between Beylith\u2019s sweet breasts!\u201d\nThe others joined in his laughter, urging their companion on as he gestured wildly, describing the curves of the young woman.\n\u201cThey say they are softer than the blankets of our commander!\u201d\n\u201cOh, speaking of the commander\u2019s blankets, our \u00c9omer knows something about that!\u201d added another companion with a lewd grin.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go suck Orom\u00eb\u2019s cock instead?\u201d \u00c9omer retorted darkly. Had he not been naked, he would have risen to teach those fools a lesson\u2014though it had happened before. But now, his body was too sore to incite a brawl.\n\u201cCome on, lads! Our \u00c9omer, after all his tumbles, must have a sore bum!\u201d\nAs the group moved away, \u00c9omer splashed the water with a hand, sending droplets flying all around. Let them go and have their fun; stallions were not tamed by idle chatter, and he would show them that. His thoughts returned to Th\u00e9odred and what his cousin had said. He didn\u2019t want to disappoint him. He had been chosen for something greater, \u00c9omer knew that. Yet, he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of failure. When they had lost their parents, Uncle Th\u00e9oden had taken him and his little sister in with open arms, raising them as his own children, and Th\u00e9odred had taken an immediate liking to them. \u00c9omer felt he owed much to them both, and it was his duty to make them proud.\nThat\u2019s why he had eagerly accepted the offer to join one of the eoreds of the Mark and had worked hard during training. Yet, when he first laid eyes on that horse, he had felt an immediate connection with the beast. Firefoot\u2019s powerful, taut muscles, his brooding gaze, and his temper, which seemed ready to send flames flaring from his nostrils at any moment, had discouraged more than one rider. In truth, even the most skilled horsemen had failed to tame him. And that was exactly what \u00c9omer wanted.\nFor the past several days and that very afternoon, \u00c9omer had attempted to tame him, but Firefoot had been just as determined not to cooperate. That afternoon, \u00c9omer had spent hours throwing the reins over Firefoot and trying to ride him bareback, only to be bucked off again and again\u2014once, twice, five, fifteen times. A decent circle of onlookers had gathered around the training ring, laughing, cheering, though whether for him or the horse, \u00c9omer wasn\u2019t sure.\nEven Commander Elfhelm and Th\u00e9odred had paused to watch. At first, \u00c9omer hadn\u2019t noticed, so focused was he on his efforts, drenched in sweat and thoroughly disheveled.\n\u201cHow long has this been going on? Perhaps you\u2019d have better luck with a pony, boy!\u201d Th\u00e9odred teased good-naturedly. \u00c9omer grimaced, attempting once again to stay on the unruly horse. Elfhelm chuckled.\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know for sure that he was a horse, I might mistake them both for two mules. I can\u2019t tell which of them is more stubborn.\u201d\nBut there was fondness in the commander\u2019s tone.\nNow, \u00c9omer rested his head on the edge of the tub with a sigh. The water had warmed a little, and the bruises hurt less, certainly less than his wounded pride. He looked up at the stars; Borgil glowed red beside the constellation Remmirath, the small blue flowers Varda had set in the skies before the beginning of time. \u00c9omer knew little of cosmology, but he cherished the legends of his ancestors, and the red fury of Borgil reminded him of the proud T\u00farin, Dragon-slayer. The air around him turned cold, and the boy shivered.\nHe heard a soft clatter of hooves and a gentle whinny coming from the stables nearby. The astute grumble of his empty stomach shook him from his melancholic stupor. An idea sparked in \u00c9omer\u2019s mind: if that horse was anything like him, as everyone joked, then there was one thing he surely couldn\u2019t resist.\nAfter hurriedly drying off and pulling on his tunic and boots, \u00c9omer crept into the kitchens, still thick with the scent of roasted meat and warm bread. He snatched half a honey loaf and soaked it in the savory, rich gravy left from the roast. Quickly, he darted to the barrels and crates filled with fruits and vegetables in the pantry and grabbed a few carrots and an apple. Slipping through the shadows of the barracks, he stealthily approached Firefoot\u2019s stall with his treasures hidden under his cloak.\nThe horse eyed him darkly, blowing warm air from his nostrils. When \u00c9omer attempted to stroke the soft hair of his nose, Firefoot kicked out, striking the wooden stall with a thundering thud.\n\u201cShh, easy there. Easy. I\u2019ve brought you something.\u201d\nHe held a large, juicy carrot under the horse\u2019s nose, letting Firefoot catch the scent of his fingers mingling with the treat. For a moment, the horse didn\u2019t move, only twitching his ears and flaring his nostrils.\nIf Firefoot was stubborn, \u00c9omer was no less so. They stood locked in a battle of wills for what felt like an eternity. At last, \u00c9omer\u2019s patience was rewarded. Slowly, and with a hint of wariness, Firefoot grasped the carrot with his teeth.\n\u201cGood lad. My fine steed. We\u2019ll be friends, you and I, won\u2019t we? Together, we\u2019ll do great things, win honor and glory.\u201d\nAs the horse crunched through the unusual offering, \u00c9omer rubbed the dark, velvety coat between his ears, showering him with praises and soft words.\nIt took more than two carrots, however, to win over the moody horse. Days of patient dedication, furtive nighttime visits to the stables, bruises, and gentle strokes were needed. But at last, Firefoot began to tolerate his presence. Slowly, through praise, bruises, caresses, and rewards, \u00c9omer earned his trust.\nFor a few weeks, it seemed as though \u00c9omer had given up on taming the brooding stallion, but that morning, under the curious and watchful eyes of Th\u00e9odred and the commander, \u00c9omer made his long-prepared display. He leapt onto Firefoot\u2019s back, who bucked and tossed his head, but \u00c9omer\u2019s hands held the reins firmly. Before the astonished gaze of his comrades-in-arms, the young rider spurred Firefoot into a gallop, and with a mighty leap, they soared over the fence\u2014right over the commander\u2019s head. A chorus of cheers greeted his feat, and when \u00c9omer wheeled the horse around and returned, he saw a newfound respect in his cousin\u2019s eyes."

Write a scene that explores their quiet intimacy and the strength they find in each other.",
        "story": "Sunlight filtered into \u00c9owyn\u2019s bedchamber, casting gentle spirals of dust in the air. Naive had just drawn back the curtains, letting the morning light flood the room. The faithful handmaiden moved quietly, careful not to disturb her lady. After arranging the pillows, she curtsied and made her way to the door to fetch the breakfast tray. On the threshold, she met Faramir, who smiled at her kindly.\n\u201cGo on, Naive. I will take it from here.\u201d\nHe spoke with his usual calm and reassuring voice. Naive cast one last glance at her lady to ensure she was awake and then curtsied again, leaving the room. Faramir approached the bed quietly, his gaze immediately settling on \u00c9owyn. She was still lying amidst the bedclothes, her hair disheveled, though already more animated than in recent days. Despite her weariness, a renewed light shone in her eyes, and her cheeks no longer looked so pale. She greeted him with a shy smile.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here. I\u2019m hardly presentable.\u201d\nFaramir sat at the edge of the bed and took her hand.\n\u201cAnd where do you think I\u2019ve been while you were unwell, my love? Not even Naive could keep me away.\u201d\n\u201cFoolish husband. You look just as worn, with shadows under your eyes.\u201d\nFaramir shook his head as if to brush off such concerns.\n\u201cDo you feel up to eating something? Here, drink this; it\u2019s warm.\u201d\nHe offered her a steaming cup of chamomile and buttered a small scone. \u00c9owyn accepted the tea eagerly but shook her head when he moved to feed her, though she brushed her hand against his jaw in thanks.\n\u201cWould you call for Naive, please? I need a bath after this long illness.\u201d\n\u00c9owyn\u2019s attempt to rise from the pillows betrayed her lingering weakness. Faramir, who had remained by her side, watched her with a gentle yet resolute expression.\n\u201cI\u2019ve given Naive the morning off. She, too, worked tirelessly to tend to you.\u201d\n\u00c9owyn huffed, crossing her arms, though her hands quickly fell back into her lap, as if her weariness prevented her from holding them up for long.\n\u201cBut I need a bath! Perhaps Nestriell or Reanna could\u2026\u201d\nHer voice sounded impatient, yet carried an undertone of fatigue. Faramir laughed softly and rose, moving toward the hearth, where a fire crackled softly.\n\u201cI will attend to it. I\u2019ve already had plenty of hot water brought up and the fire stoked.\u201d\nReturning to her side, he stopped a mere step away, his tone calm yet resolute.\n\u201cYou\u2019re under no obligation. Perhaps you should not even see me in such a state,\u201d murmured \u00c9owyn, averting her gaze, her cheeks tinged with a faint blush. Faramir leaned down, taking her hand and pressing a gentle kiss to her fingers.\n\u201cBut I wish to. And do you not?\u201d\nHis words were a soft whisper, and his eyes met \u00c9owyn\u2019s, which, for a moment, glistened with a rare brightness, freed from their burden of shame. Gently, he helped her rise from the bed, slipping soft lapin slippers onto her feet and guiding her to the adjacent bath. Like the rest of Emyn Arnen\u2019s castle, it was crafted from pale stone, lit by grand arched windows draped in heavy curtains. \u00c9owyn missed the warmth of Meduseld\u2019s wooden walls and floors, where one could walk barefoot without a chill. A merry fire crackled in the hearth, and soft white rugs surrounded the large tub. Before the fire, a few metal buckets were steaming, and Faramir poured the hot water into the tub, adding a few drops of peony-scented oil. With a small sigh, \u00c9owyn allowed herself to be led toward the tub. Though she longed to shake off the remnants of illness, the idea of Faramir seeing her in such a state weighed heavily upon her. Yet his hand, so strong and certain in hers, brought comfort, though\u2026 there was still a small knot of shame she couldn\u2019t quite untangle.\n\u201cI must be dreadful: my hair is all matted, and I must smell\u2014\u201d\nShe made a face, but Faramir gave no sign of hearing her complaint, guiding her carefully into the warm water. \u00c9owyn couldn\u2019t help a small sigh of relief.\n\u201cWhere would you like to begin?\u201d\n\u201cMy hair.\u201d\nFaramir\u2019s lips lifted into a slight smile, and he lathered soap in his hands. With gentle strokes, he worked the suds through her flaxen hair, untangling it carefully. He relished the feel of her hair in his hands, the weight of it, its familiar silken strands. Once her hair was thoroughly lathered, he began massaging her scalp in slow circles with his fingertips. \u00c9owyn sighed languidly, her eyes closing as she relaxed into the soothing rhythm, shifting subtly in the water, causing soft ripples. She adored the feel of his hands on her, whether in tender caresses like these or in rougher embraces no less devoted than this one. The fire crackled, releasing its soothing scent, and outside, the daylight began to wane, casting shadows across the bath.\n\u201cWait, I\u2019ll light a few candles.\u201d\nFaramir rose and moved around the room, lighting several long beeswax candles that filled the space with a faint honeyed fragrance. \u00c9owyn stirred.\n\u201cLeave them. It would spare you from seeing these graceless limbs.\u201d\n\u201cOh, foolish wife! Even were you withered like an apple forgotten in a cook\u2019s basket, I could not love you less than I do now.\u201d\nFaramir returned to her side, pressing a soft kiss to her brow.\n\u201cYou always manage to charm with those lofty words of yours. But not even the sweetest Elvish songs could turn back time.\u201d\nShe said this with a small splash in his direction, to which Faramir laughed heartily and replied:\n\u201cNo, time flows ever onward. But it cannot weaken the love I bear for you. Now, raise your arms.\u201d\nWith deliberate movements, Faramir passed a cloth infused with fragrant foam under her arms, along the curve of her shoulders, collarbones, and neck. She inhaled the delicate fragrance rising from the water, pleased at the thought that it would soon linger upon her skin. A strand of Faramir\u2019s dark hair brushed against her shoulder as he leaned closer to her ear.\n\u201cStand,\nmelethril n\u00een\n(my love): I want to rinse you thoroughly.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019ll be soaked!\u201d\n\u00c9owyn protested, for she still enjoyed the warmth of the bath and wasn\u2019t quite ready to reveal the scars and marks that time had etched upon her. Faramir smiled, pulling his hair back and fastening it in a knot behind his head.\n\u201cA small price I\u2019ll gladly pay for so fair a sight! Come now, don\u2019t make me do all the work.\u201d\nHe kissed her shoulder playfully, making her shiver. \u00c9owyn sighed, then rose to her feet, placing a hand on her husband\u2019s shoulder to steady herself. Laughing, she wrapped her arms around him in defiance, just as he had prophesied.\n\u201cOh,\ndagnirig\n!\u201d\nFaramir muttered in playful resignation, using the Sindarin word which she knew meant little bratt. To appease him, she showered his lips and jaw with light kisses. Smiling, Faramir rose to fetch another bucket of warm water, while \u00c9owyn wrung out her hair. Turning back to her, he nearly caught his breath: water ran down her alabaster skin, and her hair, gathered to one side, draped over her shoulder. To his eyes, she appeared like a Maia risen from the waters.\n\u00c9owyn looked at him, unsettled by the intensity of his gaze. She felt vulnerable, as though he saw something in her that she herself would never deem worthy of such adoration. Faramir shook his head with a gentle smile. He stepped closer, dipping a cloth in clean water, then softly swept it over her arms, her shoulders, down her body. Silence thick with intimacy stretched between them, filled only by the delicate dripping of rain and the faint hiss of candles. Without breaking their gaze, Faramir knelt and brushed his lips tenderly against her abdomen.\n\u201cDo you see? Always you bring me to my knees, \u00c9owyn.\u201d\nHer cheeks flushed, and despite herself, she felt flattered, a sweet confusion stirring within her. Meeting her reflection in his adoring eyes, she finally saw herself as radiant and beautiful\u2014an image that banished all her shame, leaving only the knowledge of a love that saves and heals."
