You can check it out.\u201d Willow waved towards her large purse.\n\u201cSweet.\u201d Pansy grabbed the bag and pulled it onto her lap. \u201cI have to believe there\u2019s one in here.\u201d\nPansy unzipped it and started to rifle through it. \u201cWhat the heck?\u201d She pulled out a wooden stick. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s a stake from when I used to help Buffy. I always had one on me in case of an emergency.\u201d Willow took it and twirled it between her fingers. \u201cI forgot it was in there.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d Pansy resumed her search for a pen. She noticed there was a photo and pulled it out. \u201cBloody Hell, you look so young.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Willow looked confused until Pansy gave it to her. \u201cOH!\u201d\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Pansy looked over her shoulder.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my Prom during my Senior year.\u201d Willow nodded.\n\u201cProm?\u201d Pansy sounded confused. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that is?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have dances?\u201d Willow appeared surprised.\n\u201cWell, yeah, but by the time it was my final year, we were thick in a war, so no dances.\u201d Pansy shook her head.\n\u201cAw\u2026you would have had fun.\u201d Willow smiled. \u201cI went with Oz here.\u201d She pointed to the short guy next to her. \u201cHe was a werewolf, but he left shortly after to get better control of his wolf side.\u201d\n\u201cHe never attacked you?\u201d Pansy\u2019s eyebrow arched.\n\u201cNo, he would stay in a special cage for him,\u201d Willow explained.\n\u201cOh, nice. I don\u2019t see Faith.\u201d Pansy pointed out.\n\u201cFaith.\u201d Willow sighed. \u201cShe was in a troublesome mood at the time, plus she didn\u2019t go to our school when she met us. She just came to the Library to meet with her Watcher.\u201d\nPansy nodded. \u201cAh. Which one is Buffy?\u201d\n\u201cThis one.\u201d Willow showed her.\n\u201cShe\u2019s short.\u201d Pansy wasn\u2019t expecting Buffy to be shorter than Willow.\n\u201cShe is, but she has a powerful body,\u201d Willow smirked. \u201cPlus, she was in love with a vampire.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Pansy pulled away. \u201cAre you joshing me?\u201d\n\u201cNo, really. She was in love with Angel.\u201d Willow bobbled her head.\n\u201cAnyways, when did you start dating women?\u201d Pansy was curious.\n\u201cCollege.\u201d Willow exhaled.\n\u201cDo you miss your friends?\u201d Pansy pointed to the Prom picture.\n\u201cYes and no.\u201d Willow shook her head. \u201cI miss their companionship, but I don\u2019t miss the patrols at all. I\u2019ll go with Faith if she ever asks, but she won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cShe won\u2019t?\u201d Pansy\u2019s voice had a shocked tone.\n\u201cNo, she prefers to go alone.\u201d Willow shrugged. \u201cCan we talk about something else?\u201d\nPansy dug down to the bottom of Willow\u2019s bag, felt something slim and pulled it out. \u201cAHA!\u201d\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Willow put her stake and picture back into the bag. \u201cRemind me to call them later.\u201d\n\u201cSure thing, darling.\u201d Pansy kissed her before putting her purse back where it was.\nWhen Pansy turned back towards her, Willow cupped her face and started kissing her deeply. She moaned into Willow\u2019s mouth, wrapping her arms around her.\nWillow leaned into her and forced Pansy to lean back onto the couch arm. \u201cGosh, I love you, Pans.\u201d\n\u201cI love you, too, Willow.\u201d Pansy tightened her arms and popped them into their bedroom for some afternoon delight. The pen laid on the floor, forgotten."

You would do this?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Hermione, we have been best friends since our first year. There isn\u2019t anything I wouldn\u2019t do for you.\u201d Harry knelt in front of her. \u201cDraco and I talked this over and over, and we decided that we would do this if you three were willing to help us become fathers at least once.\u201d\nHermione started to cry. Her lovers wrapped their arms around her to comfort her. \u201cAre you serious about this, Ginny? What about your Quidditch career?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun, but it\u2019s hard on the body. I have talked to Daily Prophet, and they are hiring me to cover Quidditch instead.\u201d Ginny smiled at her lover.\n\u201cHermione, you are our breadwinner at the Ministry.

It would be funny if you had a redhead with my looks.\u201d\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Ginny smirked cheekily.\nHermione just squealed happily. \u201cWe are going to have a family!\u201d\nLuna and Ginny smiled at her, \u201cYes, my lion.\u201d\n\u201cYes, my darling, and we made an appointment for the end of the week at St. Mungo\u2019s to start the process for both of us since we don\u2019t know if it will work the first time.\u201d\n\u201cBrilliant.\u201d Hermione jumped and pulled Harry and Draco up. \u201cThank you.\u201d She gave them a hug that rivalled Mrs. Weasley\u2019s.\n\u201cHermione, I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Harry gasped.\n\u201cOh, sorry.\u201d She let them go immediately. \u201cSeriously, thank you.

Did I ruin your shoes?\u201d\nHermione shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d She walked to the counter to grab some napkins. \u201cCan you refill her drinks and add a black tea, please?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly, ma\u2019am.\u201d The girl hurried to get them as she pointed to the mop for Kara.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The blonde grabbed a mop to clean up the mess.\n\u201cI\u2019ve reordered your drinks and mine as well.\u201d Hermione smiled at her as she stood up from cleaning off her shoes.\n\u201cI can\u2019t let you pay for those, miss.\u201d The woman objected as she rinsed the mop to clean some more.\n\u201cMy name is Hermione.\u201d She held out her hand.\n\u201cOh, and mine is Kara. Kara Danvers.\u201d The woman beamed.\n\u201cYes, you can allow me to pay for those.\u201d Hermione held up her hand. \u201cbecause I was too close to you to allow you to clear past me.\u201d\nKara searched her brown eyes. \u201cBut I should buy you a drink instead.\u201d\nShe sighed as she took in the piercing blue eyes. \u201cHow about this?\u201d She tapped her chin. \u201cI tend to work through my lunches, and I need someone to remind me to eat.\u201d\n\u201cTsk, Hermione.\u201d Kara shook her head. \u201cYou sound like Lena Luthor.\u201d She laughed at her surprised look. \u201cShe does the same thing.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I knew I liked her for a reason,\u201d Hermione smirked. \u201cI work at LCorp in one of the labs.\u201d\n\u201cSplendid. I can bring both of you lunch and make sure that you eat.\u201d The blonde clapped happily.\n\u201cYou bring Lena lunch?\u201d Hermione arched her brow.\n\u201cYep,\u201d Kara popped the p. \u201cI had noticed that she was working too hard, so I sometimes make sure that she relaxes a bit, even if it\u2019s just a half hour.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d Hermione smiled. \u201cI love chicken salad sandwiches or salads of all sorts.\u201d\n\u201cGot it.\u201d She tapped her head.\n\u201cHere you go, miss and Kara.\u201d The girl interrupted them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Hermione.\u201d She smiled at the girl behind the counter as Kara returned the mop to its station. \u201cHow much?\u201d They settled the bill as the blonde carefully picked up the drink carrier from the counter. She grabbed her tea, and they went out of the caf\u00e9.\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you later, Hermione.\u201d Kara beamed at her.\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019m looking forward to it, Kara.\u201d Hermione waved as she walked towards LCorp.\nThe blonde stared for a moment until she realised that she was going to be late and took off in the opposite direction."
