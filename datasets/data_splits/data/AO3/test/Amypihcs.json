        "story": "As much as it could be seen as a dismissal, as a lack of appreciation for one\u2019s services, Sherlock Holmes couldn\u2019t but be happy about his husband\u2019s discharge.\nHe had known of it for at least one day more than his dearest had, working in the intelligence offered striking possibilities when one was showing up to the office and not only working from home, but he had only left London on his own leave when Watson\u2019s letter had arrived.\nAnd there he was, in Sussex, enjoying the sweet October sunshine in the year of our Lord nineteen-seventeen from atop the railing he and Watson had built more than 10 years prior, waiting for his Captain.\nDr Watson wasn\u2019t surprised to not find Holmes waiting for him at the station with their car, it was their agreement. No station Welcomes and Goodbyes as having to stifle their feelings in those moments would have certainly made them more painful. He breathed in deeply the fresh country air and set off for his walk toward their bee-house, as Holmes called it.\nNothing could be better than half an hour of evening walk toward home, or rather, nothing but seeing one\u2019s husband jump down from a railing and grin from ear to ear as one walks into one\u2019s own garden.\nNeither of them properly\nran\ntoward the other, they weren\u2019t as young as that any more as much as Holmes\u2019 athletics still belied his true age. Holmes waited for him and Watson dove into his arms, breathing in deeply, relaxing after months of tension as he felt his husband\u2019s strong, thin arms around his shoulders and his solid, sinewy body in his arms.\n\u201cI missed you.\u201d He sighed, breathing in his scent, tobacco, lemons, aftershave.\nHolmes broke the hug with a smile. \u201cI missed you too.\u201d He answered, then he kissed him, his hands buried in his hair, moaning as he felt his Watson\u2019s arms tighten once more on his back as he answered the kiss with just as much vigour.\n\u201cI\u2019m back home.\u201d Gasped Watson when they separated out of need for air.\n\u201cYou are, my dearest. \u2013 Holmes\u2019 breath was just as laboured as he replied, ruffling his husband\u2019s hair with his fingers. \u2013 Short hair doesn\u2019t suit you my love.\u201d\n\u201cIt will grow again, I also liked it better before this war. Is that my vest?\u201d Chuckled the doctor, well used to his husband\u2019s sometimes strange demonstrations of affection.\nHolmes laughed as he played with his Watson\u2019s uniform\u2019s belt and buttons. \u201cHow did you deduce?\u201d\nIt was a game, of course, their game. \u201cIt\u2019s too large on you, my darling, and a bit too short. Also, you have no clothes of this colour. \u2013 The doctor stroked one of his Holmes\u2019 sharp cheekbones. \u2013 You needn\u2019t look so worried, Holmes. What do you deduce of me?\u201d\nHolmes smiled once more, and in that golden light he looked just like the young chemist he was when they had met. \u201cYou lost almost a stone, but you will be better in some weeks. You need to sleep properly as you are quite tired. Those dark circles under your eyes speak of anxiety, my John, and of pain. I could say your leg more than your shoulder, if I didn\u2019t know that you\u2019ve been hurt two weeks ago\u2026\u201d Holmes let his voice fade softly as he moved his hand to his husband\u2019s side.\n\u201cIt\u2019s but a graze, my dear. Some shrapnel during a rescue mission, I barely noticed it until I had finished with the poor chap\u2019s surgery. It\u2019s but a scratch, I stitched it close myself.\u201d\n\u201cI should like to check for it myself, my dear. As much as I know that your stitches are the best, you must have hidden it from your subordinates for quite a long time to end up stitching it on your own.\u201d He stated\n\u201cThose boys were shaking already, I couldn\u2019t let them know that I was hurt. \u2013 Watson kissed his husband again and then placed a warning finger on his lips. \u2013 I will let you fuss, my dear fellow, but only after some good tea and in preparation for a proper bath.\u201d He smiled.\nMr Holmes grinned at the proposition and lead his husband inside, draping himself on his shoulders as soon as they reached the kitchen. \u201cWe are home now, John.\u201d\n\u201cYes. Yes, we are, my dearest Sherlock.\u201d Answered the doctor."

        "writing_prompt": "After years apart, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson have settled back into their old routines, but Holmes has a request: keep their latest cases unpublished to maintain the illusion of his death. How does Watson balance his loyalty to Holmes with his passion for storytelling?",
        "story": "It was almost crazy, thought Dr Watson, how easily they had set back into their old familiarity.\nHolmes had been back for less than a month and already it felt natural to think once more to 221b like \u2018home\u2019, and to visit Holmes there as \u2018going home\u2019.\nAnd there he was in fact going, since Holmes had organized a little evening program for the two of them: dining at 221b, a concert together, a stroll across London and then back home.\nThe detective greeted the doctor from the floor, inviting him to sit down besides him and sharing a soft kiss. \u201cI\u2019m glad you had a nice day at the practice, Watson.\u201d\nThe doctor chuckled. \u201cMagic tricks again, Holmes? I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve found a way to avoid those who want to speak with you without shooting at them from the windows.\u201d\n\u201cI need to put the Index in proper working order again, my darling, your help would be fundamental in this.\u201d\nThe doctor chuckled and squeezed the younger man to himself. \u201cI should be delighted to help you with that.\u201d\nHolmes thanked him with a smile, leaning for a moment in his hold and answering only with a non-committal \u2018uhm\u2019 to his partner\u2019s worries about the tension in his shoulders.\n\u201cI\u2019m just thrilled for tonight, my dear. Everything\u2019s alright.\u201d He smiled.\nThe evening turned out charming indeed, Mrs Hudson\u2019s cooking being as superb as usual and the concert made even better by the chance to attend it in a private box, where the two men could share opinions unseen and unheard and Holmes\u2019 hands were free to tap every particularly enjoyable passage on his partner\u2019s leg.\nAs they came out of the hall, they were almost giggling, delighted by each other\u2019s comments on the performance and thrilled by each other\u2019s presence. Despite the slight humid chill of a late April night they made their way home on foot, arm in arm, just as they used to do years prior and just as they did back then, they climbed up home together.\nArrived at the sitting room, Holmes froze for a second and clicked his tongue.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still too early to go to bed. \u2013 He stated, kicking his shoes away and discarding his coat on the back of a chair. \u2013 Come, we might chat a bit more if you\u2019re agreeable.\u201d\nThe doctor laughed at his Holmes\u2019 antics, but removed his shoes, coat, tie and collar as well. \u201cWhat do you feel like, my dear?\u201d He asked, sitting on the couch where Holmes had tapped it and stealing a quick kiss from his lips.\nThe detective laughed, grabbing the blanket Mrs Hudson had brushed and folded on the couch\u2019s arm and laying it on the two of them, tucking his own legs into it and leaning with his head on his husband\u2019s good shoulder. \u201cJust this. \u2013 He murmured. \u2013 Just us.\u201d\nDr Watson almost startled at Holmes expressing his tenderness so clearly and with such calm, but recovered quickly, hugging his partner close to himself, playing with his fingers on his shirt, caressing him in slow strokes of his side. \u201cJust us, then. \u2013 He answered, putting a tender kiss on his partner\u2019s slicked back hair. \u2013 It feels good.\u201d\n\u201cIt does. \u2013 Purred the detective, then he changed tone. \u2013 John, I apologize. I do need to ask you for something.\u201d Holmes interrupted himself for a moment, changing his position slightly, so to be able to play with his husband\u2019s shirt front himself, then started again after Watson\u2019s understanding \u2018uhm\u2019.\n\u201cRemember your request about publishing your stories again? I do think that we should avoid doing it. After this last case especially. I want us to be safe, my darling. Let those enemies of mine who don\u2019t consult the newspapers think to me as dead for a while still. \u2013 He paused, hearing his Watson sigh. \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, my dear, but it\u2019s the safest course of action.\u201d He added.\nWatson kept his silence for a few more minutes, still slowly caressing his husband\u2019s body, then sighed again. \u201cI suppose \u2013 He began. \u2013 that you considered all the possible consequences of those stories, right?\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d Nodded Holmes.\n\u201cVery well then. I would never put us in danger, you know it.\u201d\nHolmes nodded, letting go of the last of the tension in his body. \u201cThank you for your understanding, Watson. Of course, I should be delighted if you kept up your habit of keeping a record of our cases, who knows, maybe in some years it will be safer to publish those.\u201d\nThe doctor chuckled, squeezing his husband\u2019s waist in thanks. \u201cThank you my dear. It\u2019s so very beautiful to have you back.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s so very beautiful to be back, my darling.\u201d"

        "writing_prompt": "Sherlock Holmes finds himself consumed by the tension of a high-stakes case, but Dr. Watson insists that even the greatest minds need rest. What secrets and vulnerabilities might surface as the two retreat to find solace in each other\u2019s company?",
        "story": "As soon as he and Watson saw Milverton's carriage leave, Holmes exhaled, trying to let go of some tension as he sat down in his Watson's armchair cross legged, trying to force his racing brain to stop.\nIn an attempt to calm down, he regulated his breathing trying to follow a pattern he would employ for a meditation.\nThe effort didn't last more than five minutes, as he sprang once more up from the chair and started roaming the room.\n\"You look very much like a caged tiger, Holmes.\" Observed the doctor from Holmes' desk chair.\n\"I failed, Watson. But even if I did, we still learnt something, we do have something that we can exploit.\"\n\"Vanity?\" Asked the doctor.\n\"Vanity, fear, arrogance. All of these things. But for now my brain is racing too much to form a proper plan.\" Holmes huffed again, letting himself fall inelegantly on the couch.\nThe doctor turned on the desk chair observing his partner.\nHe was incredible. Holmes could make seem graceful what the rest of the world would call inelegant, the doctor saw it clearly: the energy contained in those long limbs, the tension that still held him coiled tight.\nHe clicked his tongue and put down his pipe. \"Come, my dear fellow. You need to rest, Holmes.\" He ordered.\nThe detective hissed between his teeth and protested. \"I can't take a nap at half past Six, Watson. I need to find a way to untangle that girl from this case.\"\n\"You will think better to it if you first allow your brain some rest. Once you're calmer organizing the facts will be much easier and they'll appear much more clear.\" He insisted with a smile, offering his partner is hand.\nThe detective smiled and took it, rising from the sett\u00e9e. \u201cIt is risky for us in this case.\u201d\n\u201cIt would be if he knew of the depth of you ambitions, my dear. He doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cStill, we can\u2019t afford to let our guard down yet.\u201d Sighed Holmes.\nThe doctor shook his head and leaned up to kiss his partner. \u201cYou are so ridiculously tall, my dear. \u2013 He murmured as their lips separated. \u2013 If we climb up to my bedroom and tell Mrs Hudson that we\u2019re not to be disturbed we should be safe.\u201d\nHolmes sighed again, cupping his partner\u2019s face. \u201cYou are too good a man, John Watson.\u201d\n\u201cCome then. Come up.\u201d Smiled the doctor, leading him upstairs by the hand.\nThe two of them didn\u2019t undress further than taking off their shoes, jackets and waistcoats, but tucked in under the blankets to snuggle close, with Watson hugging his partner close and Holmes relaxing as soon as he felt his husband\u2019s strong arms around himself.\n\u201cNow, my dear, you could try rest a bit. \u2013 Smiled the doctor kissing his Holmes\u2019 hair. \u2013 Or to tell me why you\u2019re so tense.\u201d\n\u201cI knew he would refuse my deal, that\u2019s the point. I knew he would refuse to lower his price and I knew of his\u2026 heartlessness. I just can\u2019t suffer blackmailers. And the professional kind even less than the opportunist one.\u201d Answered Holmes.\n\u201cHolmes, are you thinking to Mr Trevor?\u201d Enquired the doctor.\nHolmes breathed in deeply, shakily, then nodded. \u201cYes. I\u2019m thinking of Victor Trevor and of his father. The callousness of blackmailers\u2026 It\u2019s just the worst of all.\u201d\n\u201cAre you afraid, dear Holmes? \u2013 Asked Watson, then he reassured his husband. - There\u2019s nothing bad in it.\u201d\n\u201cAfraid? Yes, probably I am afraid. Afraid of my Index, afraid of Milverton, afraid for us. We need to be really careful Watson, doubly so than usual.\u201d\n\u201cIt is very brave of you to fight against a man who could destroy what you built in so many years, my darling. I\u2019m very proud of you.\u201d\n\u201cThank you my Watson. Hold me close, please. I wonder. Sometimes I do wonder if some of the people we catch and we let get away think me some sort of blackmailer, preparing my field for the future, I mean.\u201d\nDr Watson sighed deeply once more, holding his partner even tighter. He knew the reason of his worry. Just like Milverton\u2019s or Moriarty\u2019s, Holmes\u2019 knowledge of London, of England and of what happened under the shiny fa\u00e7ade high society put on for the public was immense. The doctor rubbed his husband\u2019s back, tracing with a thumb the shape of his scapula and feeling his spine. He mused that probably both Holmes\u2019 desire to disprove the fear that he could blackmail his clients in the future and the client\u2019s desire to recompense a man so that he could not be tempted to could be behind both Holmes\u2019 high fees for his more high class client and the princely recompenses many of these men and women offered to him.\n\u201cYour clients know your worth Holmes. They know that you wouldn\u2019t blackmail them and they pay you very well so that you will not be tempted to. You are an honest man and people know, otherwise why wouldn\u2019t you be employed with the police? Or why wouldn\u2019t you exploit your remarkable brain for crime. Your Index and my records are a measure of safety for us, they help us stay safe after 1895, among other things.\u201d\nThe detective sighed deeply, feeling himself melt in his husband\u2019s arms. \u201cThank you Watson.\u201d He said simply.\n\u201cNothing to thank me for, old boy. \u2013 Answered the doctor, glad to feel his husband\u2019s arm finally circle his body. \u2013 Now we should try to catch some sleep. You have been sleeping awfully little in the last days.\u201d\n\u201cThe best of men, yet always a doctor. \u2013 Joked Holmes a bit weakly. \u2013 You are right my dear fellow, maybe thinking to a plan would be easier after some sleep.\u201d\n\u201cClose your eyes then, Holmes. I\u2019ll keep watch.\u201d Promised Watson softly, kissing his hair protectively."

        "writing_prompt": "After a high-profile blackmailer is found dead, Mycroft Holmes pays an unexpected visit to Baker Street, urging Sherlock and Watson to take a \"vacation.\" But is his concern for their safety, or is there something more sinister afoot?",
        "story": "Mr Holmes chuckled as he heard the doorbell. He had expected such a call since their nocturnal visit to Mr Milverton.\nHe leaned back on his chair, swirling his solution so as to make all his copper crystals dissolve. \"Watson, would you be so kind as to open the door... Approximately now?\" He asked with a smile.\nThe doctor puffed on his pipe, putting down his book and moving toward the door. \"Are you expecting someone, dear fellow?\" He asked.\n\"Not quite, but i thought this visit probable. \u2013 Asked Holmes, then he raised his voice, taking on a theatrical tone. \u2013 Mycroft! What a surprise, brother mine.\"\nMr Mycroft Holmes didn't let himself be disturbed by the door opening suddenly in front of himself and by his brother's theatrical welcome. He had known Sherlock since his birth, he knew perfectly well that such behaviour was to be expected.\n\"Sherlock! \u2013 He greeted back. \u2013 Don't you try to pretend to be surprised. Good day, doctor.\"\nSherlock Holmes smiled slyly observing his brother's anxious demeanour and moved languidly covering his solution with a watch glass and then sitting opposite to him, on his own armchair, impudently slinging his legs over one of the armrests. \"Should I pretend not to know the reason of your surprise or I can communicate it to my Watson?\" He asked.\nMycroft Holmes straightened his posture, glaring at his brother. \u201cIf you know what lead me to alter my usual round, please. \u2013 He gestured toward an imaginary public. \u2013 Please, share your findings with us, Sherlock. Why am I here?\u201d\nSherlock Holmes slouched deeper in his armchair, a ghost of a laugh on his lips. \u201cWatson, my dear, would you mind handing Mycroft some brandy? It will be great for your nerves, brother. \u2013 He smiled again. \u2013 You are here because of Mr Milverton\u2019s murder, right? You have somehow guessed that I was there that night.\u201d\nMycroft glared harder at his brother, but accepted the glass of brandy, draining it in one gulp. \u201cAnd why, brother mine, are you so relaxed about this?\u201d He asked with barely contained anger.\nSherlock Holmes sighed deeply and moved to sit in a more proper way, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees, fingertips touching just under his nose. \u201cBecause, brother mine, you have no evidence. \u2013 He stated, a smile playing on his lips. \u2013 Nobody, not you, not that butler, not the servants, not even Milverton\u2019s murderess or the police can prove anything about our presence there. Now, you\u2019re a much cleverer man than this and than I am, and we both know it. What do you really want?\u201d\nThe older Holmes clenched his jaw, then relaxed it. \u201cYou had a case?\u201d\n\u201cAnd an open bill with him.\u201d Nodded Holmes.\n\u201cDid he know?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I would have never allowed him. Watson thinks he suspected somehow.\u201d\nMycroft nodded, gravely. \u201cDoctor. I know I can expect more prudence of you that I can from my brother. \u2013 He stated. \u2013 If ever Sherlock allows you to start publishing those stories again, let this one wait for some years before publishing it.\u201d\nWatson nodded and smiled. \u201cI thank you for the acknowledgement, Mr Holmes, but if you know of my prudence you should know I will take all the measures I can to ensure that nobody can recognize the people involved. Nobody but themselves of course. And I won\u2019t of course publish any story anytime soon.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes smiled, proud. \u201cI won\u2019t give my permission until we are close to retirement, as you both know.\u201d\n\u201cAnd as I agreed. - Smiled Watson back. \u2013 We are not that much crazy, Mr Holmes. I know that sometimes, certain things can\u2019t be allowed to circulate.\u201d\n\u201cI still remember that your story of \u2018The Second Stain\u2019 turned the cabinets in a knocked wasp nest.\u201d Sighed Mycroft.\n\u201cAnd yet I didn\u2019t publish it before the people directly involved had retired, and I didn\u2019t publish it without taking care of changing around few names and dates so as to make them unrecognizable-\u201d\n\u201cTo anyone but themselves, yes, yes. \u2013 Interrupted Mycroft. \u2013 Still. Be careful you two, a vacation for a while wouldn\u2019t be such a bad idea.\u201d He advised.\nAt this Sherlock Holmes laughed. \u201cJesus above, Mycroft, you\u2019re really feeling paranoid today, are you not? Is Lestrade the issue? You can make him think whatever you want him to think and you know it as well as I do. Still. Watson has been bugging me to rest after this case, have you not, my dear fellow?\u201d He grinned asking to his parter.\nWatson sighed, smiling sweetly to his partner but addressing the man\u2019s brother. \u201cYou know him better than I do, Mr Holmes. You know his feelings about blackmailers, he strained himself during this case. If you can convince him to take a short vacation, I\u2019ll be forever grateful for that.\u201d\nMycroft Holmes laughed, for the first time in their encounter. \u201cI do think a good start would be getting some dinner into you both, then I\u2019m sure that maman\u2019s house on the Channel should be quite free, and if you send word a few days earlier you know you\u2019ll find it perfectly ready for a short, restorative stay.\u201d\nThe detective smiled, staring in his brother\u2019s light grey eyes, trying to guess his thoughts. \u201cYou sent word already?\u201d He asked.\nMycroft tutted softly. \u201cGuesswork now, Sherlock? Get up from that armchair and into your coat. You two are coming to the Diogenes for dinner today.\u201d He smiled, getting up himself from his seat and snickering as he saw his brother stretch theatrically before finally rising far too gracefully for a man, Mycroft could tell, that had spent the afternoon stooped over his chemistry bench."

        "story": "Dr John Watson tensed up in his bed, opening his eyes at the sound of soft footsteps.\nHe tried to force himself to relax, to force his instincts to calm down, to listen to the heavy rain hitting the road and the window panes, but couldn\u2019t manage.\nHe expected it to happen, of course, and the footsteps weren\u2019t what had waken him up. First it had been pacing down in Holmes\u2019 room and the sitting room, books being taken up and put down again in annoyed, sharp moves, the sounds coming up from the first floor were almost enough for the doctor to picture his partner\u2019s frantic moves.\nThe violin followed with its high, discordant, haunting notes, played without even bothering with the bow in an attempt to soothe his nerves.\nIt had been five minutes since Holmes had played the last note, and now he was clearly coming up.\nFew seconds later, the door slowly opened to a tall, skinny, pale figure in a white nightshirt. The detective stopped a bit at the threshold, trying to calm his breathing, trying to guess if the doctor was still asleep.\nWatson took him out of his doubt. \u201cI\u2019m not sleeping Holmes. \u2013 He breathed. \u2013 Come here, my dear fellow, don\u2019t you stand there. It\u2019s a chilly night.\u201d\nAs the doctor moved to leave him space and open the covers, the detective padded softly toward the bed and climbed in at Watson\u2019s invitation.\nHe didn\u2019t lie down, but sat against the headboard with his knees tightly drawn against his chest and his arms hugging his legs. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I woke you up, Watson.\u201d He uttered in the dark.\nThe doctor smiled. \u201cI was having issues sleeping as well. \u2013 Lied Watson. \u2013 Come, lie down.\u201d\nHolmes shook his head imperceptibly. \u201cCan\u2019t. It\u2019s dangerous. \u2013 He breathed in shakily. \u2013 I\u2026 I can\u2019t sleep\u2026\u201d He admitted.\nDr Watson sighed once more and rose, bolting the door of his bedroom. \u201cIt\u2019s safe, I promise. I\u2019m here to keep a look out, Holmes, please. Lie down with me.\u201d He asked, trying to calm his partner down.\n\u201cMay I stay here?\u201d Asked the detective, shyly.\nDr Watson sighed again, brushing his partner\u2019s hair away from his forehead and kissing him there softly. \u201cOf course. You will always have a place here. We care for each other, remember?\u201d He murmured.\nThe detective trembled a bit but let himself slide under the covers, moaning softly as he felt his Watson\u2019s arm circle his chest and hold him tight.\n\u201cI know nights like this one are scary, Sherlock. I promise I know. But here we are safe.\u201d He said reassuringly.\n\u201cThank you John. I\u2019m very sorry, it\u2019s such a childish thing-\u201d\n\u201cShush. \u2013 Interrupted the doctor. \u2013 You have nothing to thank me for, Sherlock Holmes, and it\u2019s not a childish thing. I felt in the same way when I returned from Afghanistan. I\u2019m sure you remember.\u201d\nThe detective shook his head. \u201cI remember, but it\u2019s different. You had been wounded, I\u2026 I am the one who\u2019s hurt you now, I\u2019m not a victim.\u201d He protested.\n\u201cYou were hurt also. I have no doubt you have some new scars on yourself, my darling, and of course you were never safe for three years. That will hurt a man. Even the strongest one, even Sherlock Holmes.\u201d Stated Watson.\n\u201cBut it was my decision. It\u2026 you are right, I\nhad\na choice, I could tell you, but. But I didn\u2019t. And now I\u2019m violating a boundary of yours again.\u201d\nDr Watson sighed deeply. \u201cWe stated already that you weren\u2019t thinking clearly at Reichenbach, and I have no reason to doubt that. And your actions came from your desire to keep me safe, and I can\u2019t fault that either, even if you took the choice away from me. I understand why you\u2019ve done it, I would have likely done the same.\u201d\nHolmes sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re a better man than I, John. I doubt you would\u2019ve lied to me for three years.\u201d\nThe doctor sighed, kissing his partner\u2019s hair. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would have managed to hold on for so long. \u2013 He admitted. \u2013 But I too would have returned to a man whom I love and who I think loves me. Just as you did, Holmes.\u201d\nHolmes nodded his acquiescence, and the doctor continued.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re violating no boundary, Holmes. The time I asked you for concerns making love again, building again what we had, our reciprocated confidence, not asking for a hug or some company when you can\u2019t sleep. You will always have a place in my heart and in my bed, my dear fellow.\u201d\nHolmes sighed and smiled a small smile. \u201cThank you John. You are truly the best and wisest man I\u2019ve ever known. \u2013 He shivered a little, the doctor hugging him tighter. \u2013 Thank you.\u201d He concluded, so softly Watson almost didn\u2019t hear it.\nHe sighed and stroked his silky hair again. \u201cNothing to thank me for, dearest. Now try to sleep a bit.\u201d\nThe detective nodded as the doctor kissed his forehead again.\n\u201cGoodnight John.\u201d He whispered.\n\u201cGoodnight Sherlock.\u201d Answered Watson as sleep began to dawn on them both again, hoping for a dreamless slumber."
