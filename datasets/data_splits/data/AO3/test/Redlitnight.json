        "story": "The best feeling in the world was waking up next to Nico Di Angelo. Will had been living for five years experiencing this every morning. Beside Will, curled up with his tangled hair spread around his head like a dark halo, lay the Son of Hades. His dark lashes cast shadows over his angled face with the lightest of freckles barely noticeable against his olive skin. His lips were slightly parted and a pale pink that looked so kissable. He was thoroughly snuggled under the blankets, warm and cozy and safe.\nWill carefully got out of bed and went to go make breakfast. He made toast with fruit and yogurt and brought it back into the bedroom to set on their bedside table. Then he leaned down and started peppering Nico\u2019s face with kisses.\n\"Wake up, my love,\" he whispered with a kiss to Nico\u2019s adorably scrunched up nose. \"We're going to Hazel's this afternoon.\"\nNico groaned and rolled over, holding a pillow over his head. Will smiled wryly and waited for a few seconds before he pounced and started tickling his husband. Nico yelped in indignation and turned bright red and breathless from laughing so much.\n\"Will!\" he protested. \"Will! Stop!\"\n\"You gettin' out of bed?\"\n\"Fine!\"\nWill\u2019s hands ceased tickling and wrapped around Nico\u2019s waist instead as he sat up, moving to sit between Will\u2019s legs. Will rested his chin on Nico\u2019s shoulder and chastely kissed his neck.\n\"I made you breakfast in bed.\"\n\"That's very sweet but I don't forgive you for waking me up.\"\n\"I'm sorry, darlin', but it's eleven and we said we'd be there at two!\"\nNico leaned back into Will\u2019s warm, welcoming embrace.\n\"That's ages away.\"\n\"Not for two people with no perception of time.\"\n\"Fair point. How's my wonderful husband today?\"\nWill grinned. He didn't think he would ever get sick of hearing that. Nico asked every morning. What started off as \"my wonderful doctor\" turned into \"my wonderful best friend\" which in turn led to \"my wonderful boyfriend\" and not too long after but plenty long enough it was \"my wonderful fianc\u00e9\". Two years ago it changed into \"my wonderful husband\". Will\u2019s grin grew wider with every progression. It was his favourite part of the morning.\n\"Better for seeing you,\" he responded like he always did. He saw Nico smiling and gentle took Nico\u2019s jaw to turn his head and kiss the smile on his lips. It was even brighter when they parted.\n\"I love you,\" Nico said.\n\"I love you too.\"\n\"I love you even more for the breakfast in bed.\"\n\"Oh, is your love conditional?\"\n\"Would the constable love us if we didn't feed her?\"\n\"Good point.\"\nTheir cat, Connie, was lying at the foot of the bed fast asleep. In actual fact Connie was short for Constellation but Nico and Will always called her Constable. She was ginger and black with green eyes and a lazy attitude. The Constable's love was very much conditional but she was their baby so they didn't mind.\nWhen Nico finished eating, he turned on his side to curl into Will with a satisfied sigh. Will\u2019s arms wrapped loosely around him. He kissed Nico\u2019s head and gave him a squeeze.\n\"We gotta get up, Nico.\"\n\"No,\" Nico whined. \"I'm so comfy. Please, Doc.\"\n\"It's your sister.\"\nNico frowned and leaned up to kiss Will shortly before dragging himself out of bed.\n\"Fine. I'll go shower.\"\nHe turned back with a mischievous smile.\n\"Wanna join me?\""

        "story": "\u201cHow was your day, honey?\u201d Will asked as Nico came through the door carrying two bags of groceries and dumping them ceremoniously on the kitchen counter. Will out the kettle on.\n\u201cTense,\u201d Nico admitted. \u201cMaeve and Lucy split up so that was awkward.\u201d\n\u201cThey did?\u201d Will frowned. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cLucy thought Maeve was cheating on her and asked to see her phone and the answer was no.\u201d\n\u201cWas she cheating?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know but they had a big blowout over it.\u201d\nWill poured the coffee and handed it to Nico, who kissed his cheek on gratitude.\n\u201cI see where Maeve\u2019s coming from. Everyone has private conversations. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re cheating.\"\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t trust each other then I don\u2019t think you should be together.\u201d Nico shrugged. \u201cYou know you could go through my phone anytime, right?\u201d\nWill hesitated. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nNico placed his coffee on the counter and moved to slide his hands up Will\u2019s chest with a teasing smile contradicted by the innocent tilt of his head.\n\u201cYou can check my phone. I mean, obviously I\u2019d prefer you not to be reading through all my private messages because that wouldn\u2019t be healthy but if I ask you to respond to a text for me or something and you glance at some stuff that\u2019s okay.\u201d\nHe kissed Will shortly.\n\u201cBesides, I\u2019ve hit the jackpot anyway,\u201d he continued. \u201cIntense jealousy and controlling behaviour is abusive. Looking through cute photos of us on my phone is cool. Anything as long as you don\u2019t look at my search history.\u201d\nWill chuckled and kissed Nico again.\n\u201cCould you use some sleep?\u201d Will asked once they parted.\n\u201cI could stay up for a little longer,\u201d Nico suggested with a glint in his eyes.\n-\nWill wasn\u2019t a particularly jealous guy. When Nico received a text from a friend and told Will to answer it for him, he did end up looking through some other apps but it was mostly so he could tease Nico about all the games he was playing and Nico was right over his shoulder the whole time.\nHe ended up in the photos app out of curiosity. Nico had a look on his face that suggested he was up to no good.\n\u201cWhat photos have you been taking?\u201d Will asked. Nico wrapped his arms around Will\u2019s stomach and snuggled into his side.\n\u201cImportant ones.\u201d\nWill started scrolling through. There was one of Hazel with a milkshake, one of Jason pulling a funny face, one of Kayla and Austin jumping into a river.\nThen there was one of Nico kissing Will\u2019s cheek, one of Nico and Will on their date, one of Will laughing, one of Will building a fort in the woods, one of Will and Nico dancing, one of Will reading, one of him watching a sunset, one of him sitting on a rock, one of him eating ice cream, one of him chatting happily with his siblings.\nWill kept scrolling and there were so many of just him in these small moments he hadn\u2019t even realised Nico had thought to capture.\n\u201cWhy so many of me?\u201d Will asked. Nico smiled.\n\u201cI\u2019m a photographer, Will. My job is to take pictures of the world so I\u2019ve taken lots of mine.\u201d\nWill put the phone down to hold Nico close, kissing him in a way that tried to convey just how much this meant, how much Nico meant. Here in their apartment with loved ones and each other was more than enough. He could live in their world forever."

        "story": "\"Hello, my little hell spawns! Today is a very special day because I finally persuaded my boyfriend to be in a video with me!\"\n\"You forced me to, more like,\" Will interjected. Nico turned away from the camera to stick his tongue out.\n\"This is my Will and he has graced us with his presence today for a makeup challenge where I get to put whatever makeup on him I like and he isn't allowed to see.\"\n\"I'm very nervous.\"\n\"You should be.\" Nico kissed Will\u2019s cheek. Will rolled his eyes fondly and rubbed their noses together, forgetting momentarily that they were on camera. Never mind. They could edit that bit out.\nNico kissed Will briefly on the lips, unable to contain his mischievous grin.\n\"Close your eyes,\" he whispered. Will pulled the sleeves of his jumper down and sighed but dutifully closed them. Nico was wearing one of Will\u2019s jumpers, which was far too big for him, so he rolled up the sleeves to the elbow and got out a makeup pallet.\n\"I want it to be known,\" he said. \"That I do my own makeup every day so whatever I create here will be deliberately bad. Now, whilst we do this challenge, I have printed a list of questions I get to ask Will to make this even worse for him. And they're all about me. Thank you for the suggestions by the way!\"\n\"Hang on, this wasn't agreed on!\"\n\"Do you love me?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Do you trust me?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Well, you'll have to trust me on this.\"\nNico got a brush and got to work.\n\"Question one is when is my birthday?\"\n\"January 28th,\" Will replied.\n\"What's my favourite movie?\"\n\"The Grinch. It's all we watch during Christmas.\" Will snorted. \"I like to think he embodies you. A grumpy old man who's really a big softie.\"\n\"Be aware that I'm doing your makeup right now and could do anything to that pretty face of yours.\"\nWill grinned. \"You think I'm pretty?\"\nNico rolled his eyes, picked up a different brush and started on a new colour. The video was meant to be jokey but he was actually taking this quite seriously. The corner of his\u00a0 tongue stuck out of his mouth in concentration and his eyes were narrowed and focused.\n\"What would be my three wishes if I had a genie?\"\nWill thought for a moment. \"For all the queerphobes in the world to be sent to live on Mars, to bring back life and to own McDonald's.\"\n\"All except the bringing back life.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Let the dead stay dead. Alright, next question. Do I want kids?\"\nWill choked on his own spit. Nico patted him on the back, amused.\n\"You okay, tesoro?\"\n\"Yep.\" Will nodded. \"That just caught me by surprise. I don't know. Do you?\"\n\"Maybe.\" Nico shrugged. \"But at the same time I have more than enough right now.\"\n\"That's sweet.\"\n\"Alright, I'm done. Ready to see?\"\nWill shuddered. \"No.\"\n\"Three, two, one, open your eyes!\"\nWhen Will caught sight of himself, his jaw dropped. Brightly coloured face, round ears, button nose.\n\"You did not. Nico, you did not turn me into a carebear!\"\nNico burst out laughing.\n\"Don't bother tuning in for the next video,\" Will advised. \"There might not be a Nico left to run it.\"\n\"And on that note, bye!\""

        "story": "A loud thud made Nico jolt awake. He scrambled to his feet, eyes darting around the room. He rubbed his eyes, grabbing his sword and holding it out stiffly in front of him.\n\"Who's there?\"\nThere's a groan and Nico spins around to find a body-shaped heap on the floor. Nico took a step back. Where was King Minos when you needed him?\nThe heap started to rise.\n\"Who are you?\" Nico demanded. \"Are you a god?\"\nA head lifted to reveal a freckled, gangly guy with blue eyes and curly hair. He looked kind of like a god. Or at least he looked pretty godly. Nico tried to steady his shaking hands. The possibly-a-god's eyes widened, scanning Nico from head to toe. Nico flinched, taking another step back. He was powerful. He was the Ghost King. He could take this guy on.\n\"Woah!\" The guy held up his hands, sensing Nico\u2019s anxiety. \"I'm not a god. Or a monster. You're not going to believe this but I'm your boyfriend.\"\nNico nearly dropped his sword.\n\"Obviously I'm not your boyfriend yet,\" the guy started to ramble. \"Maybe not for a few years. By the way, what year is it? How old are you? Where are we? Also, I hope time isn't still going because you're going to be super annoyed if I miss our date. Not you you. You like my you. But not mine because you're your you. But not this you because that would be wildly inappropriate. I'm not a pedophile. I promise. You're, like, twenty. Where I come from. Completely age appropriate. I feel like I'm digging myself into a hole. I should shut up.\"\nNico's mouth opened and closed a few times. \"What kind of weird monster are you?\"\n\"Not a monster!\" The guy interjected. \"My name is Will. I'm just a guy. Not on any mythomagic cards. You're a mythomagic guy at this age, right?\"\n\"Mythomagic is for kids.\" Nico scowled.\n\"Take that as a no then.\" Will winced. \"Look, I just want to get back to my home. In the future. So, um, sorry to bother you. Do you happen to know where the exit is?\"\nNico stared at him. \"It's a Labyrinth. No one knows where the exit is.\"\nWill blinked. Then he took a deep breath, tilted his head to the air and let out a silent scream.\n\"Of course it's a Labyrinth!\" He threw his hands in the air. \"Why would anything ever be simple? I wanted pizza and Shrek. Was that too much to ask?\"\nNico kept his sword firmly in between them. \"Sorry about your pizza. I'm going to go now.\"\n\"Wait, wait!\" Will said. \"You're smart. You know your way around a Labyrinth. Any chance you could help a guy out?\"\n\"If I say no, will you follow me?\"\nWill hesitated. \"Probably.\"\nNico sighed. \"Come on, then. There's a ghost around here somewhere, by the way.\"\nWill nodded. \"Good to know.\"\nNico made Will go first, sword lightly prodding Will\u2019s back. They walked for a while, narrowly avoiding getting caught in some traps. Will got snatched up by a net and Nico nearly got hit by an arrow but mostly they were unscathed.\nNico made a point not to talk as they walked. He still wasn't sure if Will was a demigod or if he was messing with him and it was better safe than sorry.\nEventually, they rounded to a dead end. Nico turned to try another path but Will stopped.\n\"Something's off,\" he said, pulling a rock from his pocket.\n\"Why do you have rocks in your pocket?\" Nico wrinkled his nose.\nWill frowned. \"It's a cool rock.\"\nHe threw it and it rolled right through the supposed wall.\n\"Huh,\" Will said. He took a tentative step forward. Then another. He stood right in front of the wall and was about to walk through when...\nHe vanished.\nNico jumped back in alarm, poking his sword at the air where Will had just been. He was about to start calling for Will when he heard King Minos' voice.\n\"My lord?\" Minos asked. \"Are you alright?\"\nNico hesitated. \"Yeah, I... I thought I saw something.\"\nHe turned away. He didn't have time for this. Bianca needed him."

One sleepless night, they find themselves dancing in the kitchen, holding each other close as the weight of their shared past fades into the rhythm of the present.",
        "story": "Will awoke to an empty bed.\nHe frowned, rubbing his eyes with his forearm. It was dark and the room was lit by a red night light that Nico had bought for them both after Tartarus.\nTartarus. Gods, that was a long time ago but it felt torturously raw.\nWill could still feel Nico's warmth on the other side of the bed. He tried to focus on it and steady his breathing.\nNico's okay. He's safe.\nWincing, Will pushed himself to sitting. The dark blobs of the cocoa puffs sat scattered around the room. Some lay at the foot of the bed, others in the corners of the room and some nestled in the closet.\nWill pulled on a tank top, rubbing the material with his thumb to ground himself. He stood up and padded along the corridor to the kitchen.\nHe felt every bit of tension being harshly expelled from his body, replaced with knee-weakening relief, when he saw Nico making themself a cup of coffee.\nNico glanced up, stiffening and then forcing himself to relax. They were twitchy in the way they only were after a nightmare.\n\"Hey, baby.\" Will breathed steadier.\nNico said nothing, abandoning his coffee and moving to wrap themself tightly around Will. Will responded with equal ferocity, nosing against Nico's temple then burying his face in dark curls. He pulled Nico closer, melding them together as close as was physically possible.\nHe could feel Nico's hands grasping at the thin material between his shoulder blades. They swayed slightly, matching each other's breathing.\nThey'd started the habit of regulating themselves like this since returning from Tarturus.\nWill felt his heart rate slow down, fear giving way to exhaustion.\n\"You good, honey?\" he murmured.\n\"Yeah.\" Nico inhaled sharply, clutching tighter. \"Are you?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nNico moved his head back to scan Will's face. They liked to check for injuries after nightmares.\nWill tried to smile reassuringly. He raised a hand to cup Nico's cheek.\n\"I'm alright,\" he said. Nico nodded jerkily.\n\"I know that in here.\" He pointed to their head, grimacing. \"But not in here.\" They layed their hand on their heart.\nWill nodded, firmly kissing Nico's forehead.\n\"I can relate to that,\" he said. \"I love you very much.\"\nNico hummed. \"You too.\"\nWrapping a hand around Will's neck, they brought him down for a short kiss.\nWill smiled, nudging their noses together. \"Pretty baby.\"\nNico scowled. \"I think you mean fearsome warrior.\"\n\"That too,\" Will agreed. \"Got me someone who can do both.\"\nNico laughed quietly. \"You're ridiculous.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nNico rested his head on Will's chest.\n\"It's still nighttime,\" Will reminded them.\n\"Stay up for a little longer,\" Nico muttered sleepily. They shifted to grab their phone off the counter and put on a playlist before settling back in his place, shrouded in comfort.\nWill moved them from side to side until they were semi-dancing.\nNico smiled, allowing himself to be spun and swayed. He hummed along to the music\u066b tugging Will into a twirl.\n\"How could a heart like yours ever love a heart like mine?\" they sang softly. \"How could I live before? How could I have been so blind? You opened up my eyes. You opened up my eyes.\"\nEventually, their dancing dissolved into simply holding each other close.\nNico stifled a yawn. Will handed him their phone and gently guided them back to bed.\nThey curled up together, Will resting his head on Nico's chest to listen to his heartbeat.\n\"Pretty baby,\" he said again as he traced the outline of Nico's collarbone.\nHe smiled when Nico didn't respond, already fast asleep."
