        "story": "\u201cHannah!\u201d\nHannah Abbott glanced up from her journal. Her eyes fell on the clock on the opposite wall, and she frowned. What was her dad doing back so early?\n\u201cHANNAH!\u201d\nHannah jumped. Her dad never screamed. Never.\n\u201cComing,\u201d she called, placing the journal on her desk, she raced downstairs.\n\u201cWhat's wrong,\u201d she began as soon as she reached the landing, but half the words got caught in her throat. Her dad was standing by the fireplace, spotted with ash. His eyes were bloodshot and he looked half dazed.\n\u201cDad?\u201d Hannad asked, voice trembling with fear and uncertainty.\nHer father's eyes caught hers and her breath caught.\n\u201cHannah\u2026\u201d her father said heartbrokenly, \u201cyour mum\u2019s dead.\u201d\nHannah\u2019s world shattered. \u201cD-dead?\u201d\nHer eyes pleaded silently for a denial, for confirmation that everything was normal, that nothing changed. But it never came.\n\u201cNO!\u201d Hannah didn't recognise the scream that emerged from her own throat.\nA tear ran down her dad's cheek, and the sight broke something within Hannah.\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d she repeated. \u201cShe c-can't\u2026 she's \u2014 she's\nMum\n.\u201d\nEven as she said it, she knew that it made no sense. Just because it was her Mum didn't mean she was invincible. Even though it felt that way.\nUsed\nto feel that way, Hannah amended in her head. Because now her mum was gone and she was never coming back, and how was her heart still beating?\n\u201c\u2026nah\u2026 Hannah\u2026\u201d\nHannah looked around dazedly, confused to find herself on the floor. Her dad was looking at her, concern etched on his face.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Hannah asked, wincing at the rasp in her voice.\n\u201cYou went unresponsive,\u201d her dad said quietly, helping her up. \u201cI've called Susan, she'll be here soon. Come rest on the couch.\u201d\nHannah leant on her father heavily, feeling as if she'd lost control of her own body. She felt like she was in a dream, about to wake up soon.\n\u201cSusan?\u201d\n\u201cYour mother and her aunt were together at the Ministry,\u201d her father informed her. \u201cHer parents were attacked too.\u201d\nHannah heard the words left unsaid. Susan was now an orphan.\n\u201cShe's going to live with us. She was going to come tomorrow, but we moved the schedule ahead.\u201d\n\u201cBut \u2014 won't she \u2014\u201d Hannah began to protest, but her father's hand on her arm stopped her.\n\u201cShe will feel better here than in an empty house, and you two need each other,\u201d her dad said gently. \u201cDon't worry about it, Hannah. Just focus on yourself, okay?\u201d\nHannah nodded, more to show she heard than any form of agreement. Her dad smiled sadly and patted her knee, standing up.\n\u201cI will go and arrange for the funeral. Call if you need anything.\u201d\nHannah watched silently as her dad flooed out, stopping herself from calling out to him. What if he got lost, or had an accident, or \u2014 or \u2014\nNo, she wouldn't think of that, she\nwouldn't\n.\nHannah wrapped her arms around herself and watched the floo; waiting, waiting, waiting\u2026\nShe was asleep before she knew it.\nWhen Hannah blinked her eyes open, it was long past dark. The house was silent and Hannah looked around bleakly.\nShe started as she caught sight of Susan sitting next to her, staring blankly into space. She didn't seem to be aware that Hannah had awoken, and Hannah didn't feel like disturbing her.\nHer eyes were bloodshot and swollen, and there were tear tracks on her face. Her usual clean and tidy clothes were rumpled, and her hair was gathered into a wild bun on top of her head. Hannah imagined she didn't look any better.\nHannah moved and Susan turned to her. Hannah froze, feeling irrationally guilty. Susan shot her a tiny smile which didn't reach her eyes, and Hannah grimaced in return.\n\u201cThey're gone,\u201d Susan said.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Hannah replied sorrowfully. \u201cI'm \u2014\u201d\nShe cut herself off. Meaningless platitudes were not what Susan needed right now, though Hannah was truly sorry.\n\u201cLet's make dinner,\u201d she said instead, though she didn't think she could eat.\nSusan gave her a look which clearly showed what she thought of that, and Hannah conceded defeat. There was no way she could comfort Susan, just as she knew there was no way anyone could comfort her right now.\n\u201cWhen I said I'd adopt you, that wasn't what I had in mind,\u201d Hannah said a while later. Her heart soared as Susan giggled.\n\u201cI'll give you this win,\u201d Susan conceded.\nIt's not much of a win,\nHannah thought, but just smiled in mock-arrogance. She leaned back against the couch and held Susan's hand in hers, just as they often did in the dorms after classes. There were no smiles and laughter, but as Hannah squeezed Susan's hand and received a squeeze in turn, she knew they would be just fine."

        "story": "\u201cHarry, you're back.\u201d\nHarry looked up at Severus from his position on the floor, having fallen as he exited the floo. He stood up and dusted himself off before Severus stopped him.\n\u201cDon't do that, you are dirtying the floor,\u201d Severus admonished, waving his wand to vanish the ash. \u201cHow is Mr. Weasley?\u201d\nHarry had gone to visit Mr. Weasley at St. Mungo's.\n\u201cStill bleeding,\u201d Harry said, \u201cbut he's much better. The healers are confident he'll live.\u201d\n\u201cI'll keep working,\u201d reminded Severus.\nHarry nodded. \u201cI know. Thanks, Severus.\u201d\nSeverus nodded, then to Harry\u2019s surprise, led him to the sofa. On the table were a couple cups of tea, along with a bunch of Harry\u2019s favourite treats. Far from relaxing him, the sight made Harry even more worried.\n\u201cSeverus, what's up?\u201d\nSeverus seemed to hesitate, mixing sugar with deliberation and putting a couple of coffee biscuits on his plate. Severus didn't like coffee.\nFinally, Severus sat down on the wingback chair opposite and looked at Harry with the blank expression Harry used to associate with the Potions Master till last year.\n\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d Severus said, and Harry rolled his eyes.\n\u201cYou don't say?\u201d\nSeverus didn't even glare at Harry, and Harry felt the dread in his heart build up.\n\u201cBefore I begin, I want you to know that,\u201d Severus began, a faint trembling in his voice Harry only heard because he knew Severus so well, \u201cIf I could turn back time and undo what I\u2019ve done\u2026\u201d\nSeverus trailed off, looking at his cup, and Harry grabbed a ginger biscuit and bit into it aggressively. Severus still hadn't spoken by the time the crumbs had disappeared from Harry's mouth, so Harry interrupted the silence.\n\u201cSeverus, you're scaring me.\u201d\nHe tried to make it come out forcefully, but he couldn't stop the pleading tone entering his voice.\nSeverus looked up with a pained expression. \u201cNot enough, in my opinion. It should have never come to this point\u2026\u201d\nHe said the last part to himself, and Harry felt the first stirring of anger within him.\n\u201cYou don't have to, you know,\u201d Harry said coldly. \u201cI can go back to the Dursleys if you want. I'm sure I can survive a few more years.\u201d\nSeverus stared at Harry in surprise. \u201cWhat\u2014\u00a0 that's not what I meant! I just meant\u2014\u201d He cut himself off with a groan and put his head in his hands. \u201cI cannot do this.\u201d\n\u201cThat's good,\u201d Harry declared. \u201cCause I'm not going anywhere.\u201d\nIf possible, Severus looked back up with an increasingly mournful look. \u201cSee? That's what I meant! You weren't supposed to barge in here so that we could play Happy Families! I was supposed to get you out of\nthat\nhouse and not think any more of it, and definitely was not supposed to\u2014 supposed to\u2026\ncare\n,\u201d Severus whispered the last word as if it were some scandalous word. Harry could do no more than stare at Severus with his mouth hanging open, not having expected that outburst.\n\u201cSo you're saying you regret coming to care for me? Harry said, staring at Severus, who had begun shaking his head, looking at Harry with an imploring look. \u201cThat perhaps you had told Dumbledore and dusted your hand off me? That, ultimately,\nI'm\nmore trouble than I'm worth?\u201d\nThat, more than anything, seemed to snap Severus out of his melancholy. For the first time that evening, Harry saw a hint of the man he'd come to know, as Severus carefully sat down his cup and came to sit next to Harry on the couch. Harry turned to look at him.\n\u201cThat was uncalled for, I apologise,\u201d Severus said, then nodded at Harry's doubtful look. \u201cWhen I said it shouldn't have come to this, I meant us growing closer and coming to care for each other without you knowing the full truth.\u201d\nHarry was almost afraid to breathe, but he had to know. \u201cWhat full truth?\u201d\nWhat had Severus in such a state?\nThen Severus told him everything. About his mother and the prophecy and the part he played in it, and his vow and subsequent effort to keep Harry safe. Harry didn't say a word, listening to Snape raptly, who was speaking almost as if he had forgotten Harry was there.\n\u201cAnd, when I found out about the Dursleys, I planned to go to Dumbledore, but he waved away my concerns. I let him placate me, but your hand was the last straw.\u201d\nHarry's eyes darted to his scarred hand then back to Severus\u2019 face, who was still speaking.\n\u201cand last year's tournament weighed heavily on my mind, and could I really ignore the danger you were in? After all, a little help wouldn't hurt anything. I could help you then we could part ways, pretending that nothing had happened, and I could continue paying my recompense by serving the Dark Lord. But now\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNow?\u201d Harry whispered pleadingly, not sure what he wanted. Apologies? Assurance?\n\u201cI don't think I can lie to the Dark Lord any longer,\u201d Severus confessed. \u201cLove leaves marks, and I've only ever loved Lily as much as I love you now. Not even the strongest Occlumency shields will hide that. My only question is, what do you want to do? I understand if you'd never want to associate with me. I should have given you the choice \u2014\u201d\nHe cut himself off as he finally dared to look at Harry's face, only to see tears freely flowing down his cheeks.\n\u201cI'm sorry,\u201d Severus whispered, then fell silent, awaiting Harry's judgement.\nHarry aggressively wiped the tears from his cheeks and stood up.\n\u201cI'm sorry, I can't do this now,\u201d he choked out, shaking his head as Severus made to interrupt him. \u201cI'm angry, don't get me wrong, but I\ncan't\nignore the last few months. I\nwon't.\u201d\nhe finally looked at Severus. \u201cI'll forgive you. Not yet, but I will. I think you deserve that much.\u201d\nWith that, Harry left for his room, Severus staring after him."

        "writing_prompt": "After a chaotic interrogation at Gringotts, Harry and Hagrid find themselves accused of theft and caught in the middle of goblin rivalries. When the goblins start fighting each other, Hagrid seizes the chance to escape\u2014but why did Griphook lie, and who\u2019s really behind the break-in?",
        "story": "Harry yawned, wishing he could sit down. He wrapped his arm around himself to fend off the cold.\n\u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d roared the goblin.\n\u201cFrom the vault,\u201d Hagrid answered yet again.\n\u201cSo you admit to the theft?\u201d\n\u201cNo! I am telling you, it was ma responsibility. I had the letter an\u2019 everything!\u201d\n\u201cAnd you cannot produce the letter, can you?\u201d leered Longsword.\n\u201cBecause I gave it to Griphook!\u201d Hagrid answered, his voice the loudest it had been.\nFinally Longsword changed from the script he'd been following for hours.\n\u201cWe will see about that.\u201d He pressed a hidden knob on the door. \u201cGriphook!\u201d\nHarry sighed, wishing they'd be released soon.\nAfter Harry had taken his gold from his vault, he and Hagrid had climbed back in the carriage, along with Griphook. They had only ridden for a few seconds before that had come to a very sudden stop. Harry would have flown right out if Hagrid hadn't caught him at the last second.\nThereafter, they were taken to the empty room they were currently in. It was more like a cell with stone walls and no windows, and one lantern lighting enough to see each other's silhouette. Then the goblins proceeded to interrogate them for hours, asking the same half a dozen questions in a million different ways.\nFrom what Harry had been able to figure out, there was a break-in in the very same vault Hagrid had taken the small package from. The goblins seemed to take that as proof that they were thieves, though Griphook had taken them there himself.\nHarry looked up as the door opened and Griphook came in, accompanied by another Goblin who had interrogated them before. Hagrid swore and Harry looked at him in surprise. Surely Griphook would tell the truth?\n\u201cDid this hoodlum give you the authorisation letter to vault 713?\u201d\n\u201cNo, he did not,\u201d Griphook answered in a monotone voice.\n\u201cThen why did you take him to the vault?\u201d Longsword asked sharply\n\u201cI did not,\u201d answered Griphook.\nHarry couldn't believe his ears. Would Griphook really blame them like that? One look at him convinced Harry that he would. Griphook didn't even look at them, even as Longsword crowed triumphantly.\n\u201cI told you I caught the thief!\u201d he said. \u201cBut you wouldn't listen, would you?\u201d\nThe other goblin frowned. \u201cNow, wait a minute. I was the first to suggest the possibility. You cannot take all the credit!\u201d\n\u201cCan't I, Gournot?\u201d Longsword said with a grin. \u201cWhat will you do about it? You've already been found untrustworthy. Who do you think the Chief will listen to?\u201d\nGournot growled, raising his spear. \u201cAnd do you not remember the incident which gave me that name?\u201d\n\u201cPah!\u201d said Longsword, raising his spear too. \u201cChild's play! I have been fighting much longer than you, and you know it!\u201d\nHarry watched the by-play in disbelief. It seemed as if the goblins had forgotten all about them. Even Griphook was staring into space, not even seeming to notice anything around him. Harry chanced a glance at Hagrid, and Hagrid\u2019s lips twitched. He looked back at the goblins in interest, who had started sparing. The sound of clanging filled the room, accompanied with inhuman growls and grunts. Neither seemed to be able to land a hit on each other.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a competition with you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Hagrid said to the goblins, but only Harry could hear him. Hagrid glanced at Harry significantly and nodded his head at the door, and Harry nodded back, a nervous excitement spreading through him. He waited as Hagrid watched the goblins, waiting for their chance.\nLongsword finally managed to get a hit in, and Gournot roared, moving faster. Longsword raised his spear to block the next hit.\n\u201cYou could have killed me, you fool!\u201d\nHagrid grabbed Harry's hand and they ran out of the room as silently as they could.\n\u201cI will have your head!\u201d Harry heard as the door closed behind them, but he was distracted as Hagrid picked Harry up swiftly and started running faster than Harry thought possible. Harry's cheeks turned red with embarrassment.\n\u201cPut me down, Hagrid!\u201d he whispered fiercely, but Hagrid shook his head.\n\u201cToo slow.\u201d\nAfter a few minutes, Hagrid slowed. \u201cCan ye hear tha\u2019?\u201d\nHarry listened carefully, then nodded. Hagrid put Harry down. \u201cFollow ma lead, \u2018arry.\u201d\nHe set a swift pace down the corridor, straight towards the voices that they could hear. They turned round the corner and came face to face with the goblins, who looked at them in surprise.\n\u201cAnd where are you going?\u201d\n\u201cLongword said the exit was here, but I can't find it\u201d Hagrid grumbled. \u201cHis idea of a joke, I suppose.\u201d\nThe goblins smiled, a smile that was all teeth.\n\u201cFollow me,\u201d one said, twisting around.\nHagrid breathed a dramatically loud sigh of relief. \u201cThank goodness.\u201d\nSooner than Harry expected, they were back in the huge marble room.\nThe place was in a disarray. Goblins milled around, all carrying spears. They glared menacingly as they caught sight of Hagrid Harry, and Harry averted his eyes.\nHagrid pulled Harry to the doors, Harry running to keep up with Hagrid's long legs.\nThe goblins opened them, looking as if they wished they could keep them locked forever. Harry raced forward, not wanting to take the chance.\nFinally they were out. The sun was almost near the horizon, and Harry guessed it was past two p.m. They had been in there for over four hours.\nHe blinked in the sun, looking at Hagrid. \u201cWhere to now?\u201d\n\u201cI need to tell Professor Dumbledore,\u201d Hagrid answered apologetically. \u201cSorry, \u2018arry. I will pick ye up for yer things later. I'll drop ye at yer relatives now.\u201d\nHarry nodded disappointedly, biting his tongue to keep from arguing. He knew it wouldn't help.\n\u201cWhy did Griphook lie, Hagrid?\u201d he asked instead. \u201cAnd will they arrest us for running away?\u201d\nHarry imagined a dozen goblins at the Dursleys' front door, all carrying spears. He shivered.\n\u201cHe was probably under the control of whoever robbed the bank, \u2018arry. And that's why I need ter go to Professor Dumbledore. He will soon set them straight. Not need ter worry abou\u2019 it.\u201d\nHarry nodded doubtfully as they reached the underground.\n\u201cThis is your train ticket, and this one is for the bus. That should take ye to Wisteria Walk. You will know yer way from there?\u201d Hagrid said, handing him a couple of tickets. Harry nodded in answer, and Hagrid patted him heavily on his shoulder.\n\u201cTha\u2019s great! I will see you then!\u201d\nHe walked off, waving to Harry, and Harry waved back, wondering if he'd get to see Hagrid and Diagon Alley ever again."

But when Neville refuses to leave his side, their conversation reveals unexpected strength, shared burdens, and the true power of love and friendship.",
        "story": "Harry laid on his bed, staring at the ceiling listlessly. He ignored the bustle and laughter around him, as the other boys made the most of the last day of school before summer.\n\u201cC'mon, I'm hungry!\u201d\n\u201cWhere's my sock?\u201d\n\u201cMe ma's expecting a letter. Barmy, I say! She'll see me tomorrow!\u201d\n\u201cComing, Harry?\u201d\nHarry blinked out of his stupor. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI'm going downstairs. Are you coming?\u201d Ron repeated patiently.\n\u201cGo on,\u201d Harry said, turning his gaze back to the ceiling.\nThe fifth-year boys' dorm had better things for him to stare at, but Harry was bone-tired, exhausted from all the thoughts jumbled in his head. While the other boys rushed around to get ready to leave, Harry took the time to try and clear his mind.\n\u201cAll right.\u201d Ron's voice was reluctant. \u201cSee you in the hospital wing?\u201d\nHarry hummed noncommittally. He knew he should have sounded a bit more eager to see Hermione, who was still in the hospital wing, but he just didn\u2019t have it in him at the moment.\nFinally, there was silence and Harry sat up, only to freeze. Neville was sitting on his bed, staring at Harry. Harry stared back until \u2013\n\u201cCan you please just\u2026 go?\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d Neville asked mildly.\n\u201cI don't want you here right now,\u201d Harry replied aggressively, ready to tear his hair out in frustration. He felt as if he would break down any moment, and how would that look? Harry felt embarrassed even thinking of it.\n\u201cWe don't have to talk.\u201d\n\u201cUgh, fine!\u201d Harry flopped back on the bed. \u201cWhy do I even bother?\u201d\nThere was a few minutes of silence before Harry couldn't bear the guilt anymore. He knew Neville was just trying to be helpful.\n\u201cI'm sorry,\u201d Harry muttered.\n\u201cIt's alright.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it isn't. I shouldn't have snapped at you like that,\u201d Harry replied.\n\u201cI think you're justified.\u201d\nHarry turned to look at Neville, who was still sitting on his bed, staring at him.\n\u201cWhat are you doing anyway?\u201d Harry asked curiously. \u201cAren't you hungry?\u201d\n\u201cI'll go to the kitchens later. I just don't think you should be alone.\u201d\nHarry's mood soured again. \u201cI'm not a nutcase, you know.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Neville assured him. \u201cEven sane people need friends. I should know.\u201d\nHarry couldn't argue with that, so he remained silent, looking at Neville. He remembered the timid boy who ran off with the Hat during his sorting, and he marvelled at the confident young man before him.\nIf Voldemort had chosen Neville, would Neville have managed? After a moment of contemplation, Harry decided that he would have, probably better than Harry himself. Neville had the ability to succeed in what he put his mind to, and he had more empathy than him.\nAfter all, Harry hadn't managed to be better in Potions despite his dream to be an Auror.\nLooking at Neville now, Harry was glad to have him as a friend. Harry himself hadn't been a good friend\u2014he still wasn't\u2014but perhaps he could try to be better.\n\u201cYou did wonderfully,\u201d Harry said suddenly, wanting Neville to know. \u201cAt the Ministry, I mean.\u201d\nNeville's face lit up. \u201cYou think so?\u201d\nHarry nodded firmly, sitting up. \u201cYes, I do. And\u2014I'm glad you're here, Neville.\u201d\nNeville smiled as his shoulders loosened. Maybe he had been afraid Harry would scream at him. Harry didn't know, but he felt guilty.\n\u201cI\u2026 I miss Sirius. It's a pain right here,\u201d Harry said hoarsely, placing his hand on his chest as a stabbing pain pierced through him again. \u201cAnd\u2014I'm feeling so helpless\u2026 and scared.\u201d\nThere, he'd admitted it.\nNeville nodded sympathetically before saying, \u201cYou know we're here with you, right? We'll be fighting till the end. We won't \u2014 none of us \u2014 we'll never give up.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but\u2026\u201d\nBut the prophecy,\nHarry completed in his head, but he couldn't say it. Dumbledore had been clear about that.\n\u201cBut?\u201d Neville prompted, and Harry had an overwhelming urge to tell him everything. Harry would have wanted to have known if Voldemort had chosen Neville\u2026\n\u201cThere's a prophecy.\u201d\n\u201cDid you manage to hear it?\u201d Neville asked.\n\u201cDumbledore told me\u2014after we got back.\u201d\nNeville remained silent, watching him. Harry stared at his hands.\n\u201cIt basically said that I kill Voldemort\u2014or he kills me.\u201d Harry looked up, overwhelmed all over again by the weight of the task in front of him.\nWhy had Voldemort chosen him? He wasn't anyone special. Could Harry even go through with this all? How was he supposed to lead them all when he hadn't been able to save Sirius, his own godfather?\n\u201cHow do I do that, Neville?\u201d Harry asked helplessly, his voice rising with uncertainty. \u201cVoldemort has got years and years of experience, and what have I got? Nothing! Except for love, apparently.\u201d\n\u201cLove is not nothing,\u201d Neville said fiercely. Harry raised his eyebrows in surprise.\n\u201cIt's not,\u201d Neville reiterated, seeing Harry's look. \u201cIt's love that gave me the courage to join up. Love that made me determined to learn in DA. Love that kept us all going when everything seemed hopeless in the Ministry. Love is the reason we all stand with you, Harry. Love is not nothing.\u201d\n\u201cThat's what Dumbledore said,\u201d Harry said after a moment. \u201cAnd that it was my mother's love and sacrifice that kept me alive. It burned Quirrell in our first year too.\u201d\n\u201cThere you have it!\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026 sometimes I wished it hadn't. I\u2014I wish she'd stepped away and saved herself instead.\u201d\n\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d Neville said, looking sadly at him. \u201cI feel the same way about my parents. But I reckon\u2026 that they would feel the same if they had been in my place.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said hoarsely, not having thought of that before. \u201cThey would have.\u201d\n\u201cAnd remember what Luna said? We'll see them again\u2014all of them. Mum and Dad, sane and well, and your parents and Sirius and Luna's mother\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d Neville nodded empathically. \u201cLuna knows what she's talking about. Well, except when it comes to her strange creatures\u2026\u201d\nHarry managed a small smile, appreciating Neville's attempt to lighten the mood. \"Yeah, Luna and her creatures. Sometimes I think she makes them up just to distract us.\"\nNeville grinned, sensing the shift in Harry's mood. \"Could be. Still, it's nice to think about, isn't it? A world with Wrackspurts and Nargles.\"\nHarry chuckled softly, the tension in his shoulders easing. \"Imagine if there really were Wrackspurts flying around. It would make sense, considering how fuzzy my head has been lately.\" He batted his hand around his face as if chasing bothersome flies away.\nThey looked at each other for a moment, then burst out laughing.\nHarry's stomach grumbled and he suddenly remembered he had missed lunch. \u201cKitchens?\u201d\nNeville nodded in agreement. \u201cI'm famished.\u201d\nThey went out to the common room and through the portrait hole, walking in silence, until Harry remembered something.\n\u201cYou know the prophecy I was talking about?\u201d Harry asked quietly.\n\u201cYes?\u201d Neville furrowed his brows.\n\u201cIt referred to both of us\u2014until Voldemort chose me.\u201d\nNeville was silent for a long time, and Harry started wondering if he should have kept that to himself.\n\u201cI'm glad it was you, then,\u201d Neville said shakily. \u201cI'm not brave like you, or talented.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Harry protested, but Neville shook his head.\n\u201cI'm not, Harry, and I'm not ashamed of it\u2014not any longer\u2014but we can pretend it's both of us. It's both of our responsibility, got it? You don\u2019t have to do this alone.\u201d\nHarry remained speechless, staring at Neville. \u201cI don't know what to say.\u201d\n\u201cThen don't.\u201d Neville bumped his shoulder. \u201cI know you'd have done the same for me. That's love.\u201d\nIf that was love, then love was just as powerful as Dumbledore had always believed.\nHarry was glad he hadn't managed to push Neville away. His steps had a spring to them as they walked to the kitchen, feeling hopeful for the first time since Sirius died."

        "story": "Harry was a natural healer \u2014 always had been. It had been his saving grace many a time.\nWhen Uncle Vernon had locked him out during Christamas and he'd woken up with a cough that wouldn't go away until he was blue in the face. Harry was sure that if he hadn't woken up the next day completely fine, he might not have survived the month.\nThere was also the time Dudley had punched him so hard that his glasses had shattered, millions of tiny shards flying everywhere. Miraculously, the burning in his eyes lasted for a few seconds at most.\nThere were other incidents too, small ones that Harry barely noticed. The skin healing over from a burn while cooking, a broken nose healing in seconds. Scrapes and bruises disappearing overnight.\nIt was maybe for this reason Harry hoped (perhaps naively) that he could help Neville's parents. Their condition had been at the back of Harry's mind since he'd first heard about it from Dumbledore, but it had moved to the forefront since Moody's class.\n\u201cHarry? Harry?\u201d\nHarry blinked, focusing on Ron and realised they had reached the Great Hall and Harry had been standing beside the Gryffindor table like an idiot. Judging by the way people were beginning to stare, it had been quite a few minutes, at least. Blushing, Harry moved to sit down next to Ron.\n\u201cAll right, mate?\u201d Ron asked, his brows furrowed in concern.\nHarry nodded.\n\u201cI was just\u2014 did you see Neville in class?\u201d\nRon shuddered dramatically.\n\"Yeah. It's strange, innit? Neville's reaction.\u201d\nHarry nodded, reaching for the potatoes.\n\u201cWhere's Hermione?\u201d\n\u201cBlimey,\u201d Ron said, raising his eyebrows. \u201cYou were really out of it, weren't you? She said she forgot her Charms book.\u201d Ron lowered his voice to a whisper. \u201cAnd Moody called Neville away after class.\u201d\n\u201cI'd be happy if Moody wasn't the reason for Neville needing someone in the first place,\u201d Harry said worriedly.\n\u201cI know.\u201d Ron agreed. \u201cBut Hermione wouldn't listen \u2014 said Moody's a professor and he'd know what to do.\u201d\n\u201cAre you still on about that?\u201d\nHarry and Ron jumped as Hermione spoke from behind them.\n\u201cNeville is fine,\u201d Hermione continued. \u201cLook.\u201d\nHarry turned to look and sure enough, Neville entered the Great Hall looking much better, if still not cheerful.\n\u201cWhat did Moody want?\u201d Ron asked curiously as Neville reached the table.\n\u201cHe gave me a book on plants,\u201d Neville said, holding up the book. \u201cAnd said I am Professor Sprout's best student.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you are,\u201d Harry said encouragingly. \u201cI could have told you that. Pie?\u201d\n****\nFor the most part life went back to normal and Harry pushed Neville\u2019s parents out of his mind. The task became much easier when his name was pulled out of the Triwizard Tournament. His own trouble heaped on him until he was drowning in them, and there was nothing to remind him of the couple wasting away in St Mungo's, unaware of the passing time.\nUntil there was.\nAfter overhearing the Order's conversation with Mr. Weasley in St. Mungo's, Harry had left in a daze, not even hearing the calls of his friends behind him. He entered the lift subconsciously and left again on the first stop. It was only after he had walked the entire corridor and heard Neville's voice that he came back to himself.\nSuddenly curious, Harry stepped into the long-term patient ward. He stopped at the entry way, looking around at the chaos.\nIn a section of the room, rounded off by curtains, there was a disturbance. A man lay in a bed by the wall, looking up mindlessly. Next to him was a woman in a hospital gown, seeming distraught. Neville was trying to speak to the woman in a calming voice.\nJust then, half a dozen Healers rushed into the room, pushing Harry out of the way. Neville too stood to the side, not seeming to notice Harry.\nWith a jolt Harry realised that that the couple were Neville's parents. He swallowed against the sudden lump in his throat and thought vaguely of leaving, but something kept him frozen in place.\nIt seemed as if Neville's mother was having an episode. Half a dozen Healers were trying to get her in bed. She was resisting with surprising strength, scratching and kicking mindlessly. Neville's dad was in bed beside his wife's, not even reacting to the commotion around him.\nHarry caught sight of Neville's face and his heart broke at the terror in his eyes. Before Harry knew what he was doing he had walked forward and laid a hand on Neville's mum's arm. She seemed to relax at his touch and Harry had no trouble guiding her back into bed.\nUnexpicably, Neville's dad took note of the silence and started trying to get out of bed, his eyes darting about wildly. Harry turned to him and pushed him gently back on bed.\nIt was only when Harry turned back to leave he noticed the looks he was getting by the people gathered around him. Harry fidgeted, unable to meet anyone's eyes.\n\u201cSorry for \u2014\u201d Harry began, but a smiling faced Healer spoke over him.\n\u201cNo need. You just made our job a lot easier. What is your name?\u201d\nHarry hesitated, glancing at Neville nervously. \u201cSeamus Dean.\u201d\nNeville tried not to look too surprised.\n\u201cWell, Mr. Dean. I'm afraid you're not allowed to be here. Are your parents here?\u201d\n\u201cAh \u2014 yeah, I lost my way. I was going to\nCreature Induced Injuries\n\u2026\u201d\nHarry trailed off as the healer nodded. \u201cJust go down to the first floor and a healer can guide you to the correct room.\u201d\nHarry thanked her and turned to leave before Neville's voice stopped him.\n\u201cH \u2014 Seamus\u2026 thank you.\u201d\nHarry nodded, avoiding Neville's eyes. \u201cAnytime.\u201d\nHe escaped as fast as he could and reached the lift just as Ron and Hermione came out, looking anxious.\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d Hermione exclaimed. \u201cWe've looked everywhere for you!\u201d\nHarry allowed himself to be pulled in the chatter, taking one last look at the ward where Neville's parents resided.\n*****\nOn the last day of the holidays when Harry was being trounced by Ron in a game of chess, Mrs. Weasley stuck her head through the door.\n\u201cHarry dear, can you come down to the kitchen please? Professor Snape would like a word.\u201d\nHarry cut himself in the middle of sending a pawn to sacrifice himself. \u201cSnape?\u201d\n\u201c\nProfessor\nSnape,\u201d Mrs. Weasley said reprovingly. \u201cBe quick, he says he can't stay long.\u201d\nWondering what trouble he'd gotten himself into, Harry followed Mrs. Weasley to the kitchen.\nThere Harry found Snape and Sirius standing on opposite corners of the kitchen, glaring at each other.\nSirius broke off his glare at Harry's entrance and smiled a strained smile.\n\u201cWhat is is this about, Sirius?\u201d Harry asked, ignoring Snape.\nSirius opened his mouth to answer but Snape spoke over him.\n\u201cMr. Potter, how nice of you to grace us with your presence.\u201d\nHarry glared, a hot flush coming to his cheeks.\n\u201cOr should I say Seamus Dean?\u201d\nAll at once Harry felt himself go pale. Snape smiled smugly while Sirius looked from Snaoe to Harry.\n\u201cWhat is he talking about, Harry?\u201d\n\u201cOf course Potter won't tell you. If he was going to, he would have said something before. Tell me, Potter, what were you doing on the third floor of St. Mungo\u2019s while the rest of the Order were on the first?\u201d\n\u201cI got lost,\u201d Harry said shortly. \u201cOr is that not allowed?\u201d\n\u201cAnd you didn't think to tell\nanyone\nabout the meeting you had?\u201d\n\u201cI didn't think it was important.\u201d\n\u201cPotter thought it was not important, so of course it wasn't. Nevermind the search going on for Seamus Dean\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry said incredulously. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nSnape looked at Harry as if he was an idiot.\n\u201cYou don't think people would search for the person who cured a seemingly incurable disease?\u201d Snape snarled. \u201cI knew you were an idiot, but not this much of an idiot!\u201d\n\u201cDon't shout at my godson!\u201d Sirius broke in. \u201cYou've got no right!\u201d\n\u201cThen explain to your godson the importance of not putting his nose in other people's business!\u201d\n\u201cSo you're saying he\nshouldn't\nhave healed the Longbottoms? You would say that, wouldn't you? It must be such a blow to your Death Eaters friends.\u201d\nJust then Harry managed to find his voice. \u201cThey're healed? Neville's parents. Are you sure?\u201d\n\u201cDon't act so surprised, Potter,\u201d Snape said sourly. \u201cYou healed them.\u201d\n\u201cBut I just put them to sleep!\u201d Harry protested.\n\u201cSo you confess you put them in a healing sleep?\u201d Snape clarified.\n\u201cYe\u2014 what, no! I just helped them to bed and they fell asleep on their own!\u201d\n\u201cThen explain to me why they woke up completely healed?\u201d\nHarry shook his head, unsure what to think. \u201cI don't know. Maybe \u2014 maybe someone came in the night and gave them a potion or something.\u201d\n\u201cVery good,\u201d Snape said, his voice thick with sarcasm. \u201cSomeone came in the night without anyone knowing, did not introduce themself, and gave an inexistent potion for a one-of-a-kind disease. Maybe if you thought more\u2014\u201d\nTo Harry\u2019s relief, Sirius cut in again. \u201cWhat is this, an interrogation?\u201d\nSnape seemed to gain control of himself and stepped away from Harry.\n\u201cI got my confirmation,\u201d he said tensely. \u201cYou can go back to your mindless activities.\u201d\n\u201cMany thanks,\u201d Sirius retorted. \u201cAnd tell Dumbledore to come talk to Harry himself!\u201d\nSnape acted like he didn't hear him and left, robes billowing.\n******\nDumbledore did end up talking to Harry on his first night back at Hogwarts. He asked a few questions that Harry answered as best as could, trying not to get annoyed at Dumbledore's insistence to avoid Harry's eyes. Still, Neville's face of wonder as he spoke about his parents chased Harry's anger away even as he answered pointed questions about his natural ability to heal. He was just glad Neville got his parents back."
