        "story": "The last thing he expected was that Peter\u2019s \u2013 well, he doesn\u2019t even know what to call it. Re-education seems a little harsh, considering the historical connotations, and everything else is just\u2026 wrong. Rehabilitation? He doesn\u2019t think he ever really was one of those who needed that. Yes, he forged art and lied and stole, but that\u2019s hardly worth a place in hell. Restitution? Not the proper word to use, and anyway, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s giving back any of what he stole. The FBI already seized most of it, and what little there remains is not exactly the most expensive of the bunch.\nThe point is, he really didn\u2019t think he\u2019s changing in any way, shape or form. He might have a nine-to-five, but he hates it (or so eh thought). It\u2019s nice to have dinner with Peter and Elizabeth sometimes but it doesn\u2019t take away the fact that he can only walk so far without being arrested (he was convinced). It\u2019s one thing to be able to solve cases and help people, but another when one is forced to do so (he believed).\nSo, really, he was just a crook who flew too close to the sun, as Mozzie put it, got caught, then got lucky and that is why he is not in jail and biding his time. Easy, right?\nAs it turns out, not so much.\nHe\u2019s been going through some files. Nothing big, nothing that needs their immediate attention, but if he doesn\u2019t, there\u2019ll be repercussions, mainly that Peter will have to do it on his own, he\u2019ll be late for dinner, and Elizabeth will be annoyed, not to mention that Diana and Jones will roll their eyes, and anyway, it\u2019s easy enough work for a few hours. Mozzie sends him a text that they need to talk, but that can mean anything and is not alarming really so he decides to ignore it until he gets home that night.\nMozzie is waiting for him, having opened a bottle of wine, of course.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asks when her realizes his friend his unnaturally excited, even for his standards.\nAs it turns out, it\u2019s a von Alt. Not extremely well known over here, but fetching a lot in Europe, so \u2013 perfect. Also, currently being house in one of the smaller museums in Manhattan, being on permanent loan from a millionaire how seems to consider it his duty to let other people enjoy works of art too instead of letting them rot in some vault or another which, from what he knows of that kind of people, is positively philanthropic. Also a bit stupid, but it just gives them the chance to\u2026 to\u2026\nHe says no without even thinking about it. There\u2019s just something that rubs him the wrong way. Also, it\u2019s next week, and there\u2019s an audit coming up, not to mention Diana and Jones will be in court, and Peter is \u2013\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done worse\u201d Mozzie say and he automatically opens his mouth to argue only to realize that in fact, they have, They have, as mentioned before, stolen and lied and cheated, and he has never even batted an eye, because it\u2019s unfair that some people have nice things and they don\u2019t. It\u2019s just how life works \u2013 sometimes you have to help justice along if you actually want to see it done\u2026\nBut this\u2026 well\u2026 this is not one of those times. This is literally just them being annoyed that another rich guy has a painting. If he were hiding it away, that would be one thing, but it\u2019s literally on loan to the gallery, and so people get to see it. Everyone is happy with that, apart from people who want it for themselves or need the money, and\u2026\nWell\u2026 Neal does get paid. Not a lot. But there\nis\ncompensation. And anyway, if something happened and Peter realized what was going on \u2013 always a risk, although until now, it just added to the gun of it \u2013 he\u2019d hunt them down again because this is Peter they are speaking of.\n\u201cI know\u201d he finally answers because he realizes Mozzie expects him to. \u201dIt\u2019s just \u2013 \u201c and then he realizes he has no idea what to say to even start to explain what\u2019s going on in his head, because it seems that part of him is a law-abiding citizen all of a sudden and it\u2019s a little bit too much for him to comprehend.\n\u201cLook I\u2019m not saying never, alright? I\u2019m just saying some other time\u201d he tries to save himself, only for Mozzie to raise an eyebrow.\n\u201cFine, fine, mon fr\u00e8re, just don\u2019t expect me to join you on your new side any time soon.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no new side, he thinks, shaking his Hea. He\u2019s just being careful and deliberately choosing what to do, that\u2019s all.\nIf only he could believe himself."

        "story": "Half a year ago, it had not been part of the plan that he should run into an old friend from college \u2013 if he wanted to call Dean Winchester a friend, when in reality they had been \u2013 but that was not the point.\nNo, here he was lying low in Lawrence, Kansas, his Mustang needed some loving care, and he just happened to enter a shop and see Dean Winchester.\n\u201cCrowley!\u201d\nAnd the rest, as they said, had been history.\nHe had now spent the last six months in this good-for-nothing town and any investigation he had had to be worried about had long since blown over. He could leave, and he would.\nHe just wanted to spend one last evening with Dean, as they had done so often lately.\nThey had been talking about nothing important \u2013 Dean had ben complaining about a blind date his brother had sent him on \u2013 when his \u2013 friend? \u2013 suddenly turned to him and asked, \u201cWhat about you, anyway? No one special on the horizon?\u201d\nAnd he could have told him that he usually got what he wanted, only he couldn\u2019t, because Dean Winchester had been the one thing he had ever had to leave behind.\n\u201cYou were the first\u201c. The words tumbled out of his mouth before he could stop himself.\nDean stared at him. \u201cWhat are you \u2013\u201c\n\u201cAnd the last\u201d he admitted, feeling as defeated as he sounded, because eh had seen what his life would have been like if he had chosen a different path, if he had decided to act back then, he might have been \u2013\nMight have been \u2013 but that was deluding himself, as he very well knew. He was never meant for a straight path in life, and it was good that eh had acted accordingly. He would only have dragged Dean Winchester down in the mud with him, and what then? He would have come to hate him, eventually anyway. His lovers usually did. But in this case, he didn\u2019t think he would have been able to bear it.\nDean looked at him, then shook his head slowly, as if contemplating something.\nThen, \u201cYou really took your time, peaches.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, his confusion only getting stronger when Dean kissed him.\n\u201cYou were no exactly \u2013 no that\u2019s not true\u201d Dean eventually explained. \u201cBut I could always tell it was you. Kept an eye on the news, you see, just out of\u2026 But doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\nHe laughed because there was nothing else to do.\nDean chuckled himself. \u201cI know. Well, now that that\u2019s out in the open, how do we proceed?\u201d\n\u201cWhat \u2013\u201c\n\u201cWhat do we do about this? Because I\u2019m not about to leave my life behind. I\u2019ve got my shop, and my niece and nephew, and Sammy \u2013 Sammy would never let me get away, and man, I can\u2019t imagine what bobby would do, so you have to \u2013\u201c\n\u201cWhat makes you think I would even want \u2013\u201c\nAnd then Dean kissed him. Kissed him like it was nothing, like the years had not passed and eh found himself responding and remembering why he had always been the most exhilarating man he had ever met.\nWhen they broke off, Dean asked, \u201cSo?\u201d\nIt should not have been easy \u2013 or no \u2013 it should have been easy. He should have known exactly what he wanted, ands that it was to leave and continue on his path. Some things were not meant to be, and so he couldn\u2019t just \u2013\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to come up with a plan.\u201d\nDean kissed him again.\nA year later\n\u201cNo, no, of course we understand, Agent \u2013 you\u2019re not the first, just an unfortunate coincidence \u2013\u201c And Dean led the woman out of their house with the practice of someone who did so on a regular basis.\n\u201cThat should be enough visits from the feds for the rest of the year, don\u2019t you think?\u201d he asked, coming into the living room. \u201cAt least until they work their way through the pile yet again.\u201d\n\u201cYou never know\u201d he replied.\nDean shook his head. \u201cWould have been easier if we\u2019d manage to make it look like you were dead \u2013\u201c\n\u201cOh\u201d he brightened up \u201dI am sure \u2013 \u201d\nOne look from his husband made it clear that plan was not going to go anywhere. Apparently they would be stuck handling the agents for quite some time to come.\nNot that he could bring himself to mind too much. Business was booming, even Sam had calmed down somewhat when it came to their, as most people believed it, whirlwind romance, and most importantly, he had Dean.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I could rely use a glass of Craig\u201d he declared.\nThere really was nothing to do but to oblige, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to mind all too much about it."

        "story": "He\u2019d been working, if he wanted to call this working and not indentured servitude, which, if you asked Neal, was still debatable, at the FBI for about a year and a half now, as Mozzie got never tired of reminding him. Not that it changed much \u2013 he was simply sitting out his sentence, but thankfully not in a cell, and he couldn\u2019t deny that he did good, occasionally, which might not have done much for his reputation but nonetheless left him feeling somewhat accomplished at the end of the day.\nAnd really, all in all, it wasn\u2019t too bad. He might not have been his own master, but he planned to rectify that soon, and anyway, for now, it was even sort of fun to have a 9 to 5 job most of the time since he had never really known what that was.\nAnd he couldn\u2019t deny that he enjoyed spending time with Peter \u2013 as a matter of fact, one of the reasons he had already more than once drawn back from making definitive plans was that he would never see him, Elizabeth or the other people he had slowly come to call his friends once he was done here.\nBut well, while he was still here, he might as well take this seriously because it got Peter off his back and made people think he was resigned to this, so he might as well just have some fun\u2026 by taking it seriously (it did not have to makes sense to other people, as he would have told Mozzie).\nAnd so, when a new case rolled around and he shared the team\u2019s frustration at not being able to lay hand on the suspect and another agent just strolled in acting like he was the next big thing, Neal just\u2026 snapped.\nAgent Linder had been going on and on abet this case, how he was the one who first realized something was off about the bank statements, how he deserved to bring in the culprit, how it would bring him forward and he would finally get some much-deserved recognition (it was clear what he was angling for, but good luck with that, Neal knew they were still waiting for Peter to want Organized Crime).\nWhat he meant to say was, he just couldn\u2019t take it anymore, and so, when the man finally needed to take a deep breath\u2026\n\u201cLet me remind you\u201c Neal said impatiently. \u201cWe need a warrant to be able to search the place, or rather, to ensure that everything we find can be used in court, bevues if it can\u2019t, we might as well do nothing at all.\u201d\nLinder shot him a dirty look, but he couldn\u2019t have cared less. If they wanted to get this guy off the streets, then they had \u2013\nIt was then that he realized what he had just said, and what he had been thinking, and he quickly went to get coffee.\nHe shook his head at himself as he poured himself a cup. That case last week where he had yet again pretended that he was an FBI agent must be catching up with him. Thank God Mozzie had not been around, he would never have heard the end of it.\nHe had hoped that his outburst had gone unnoticed, but that had perhaps been too much to ask, especially with Peter Burke around. Art first, he didn\u2019t think much of it when his friend joined him \u2013 Peter was worse than him when it came to coffee, as June\u2019s depleted Italian roast stash could attest \u2013 but then he causally said, \u201cYou were right, of course.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d he agreed automatically then asked just to make sure \u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\u201cWith Linder just now. We can\u2019t do anything without a warrant, and with the evidence we have now, or lack thereof, no judge would sign one.\u201d\n\u201cJust wanted to save some time. He is rather insufferable.\u201d\n\u201cYou can say that again\u201d Peter told him, uncharacteristically grinning (well the grinning in itself was not uncharacteristic, but that he should do so while complaining about a\u00a0 colleague certainly was). \u201cI am just glad you reminded him of the correct procedure.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go so far.\u201d\nPeter shrugged even though it was clear he did not agree.\n\u201cWhatever, don\u2019t get used to it. I just wanted to take him down a peg or two.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, of course, never\u201d Peter agreed. \u201cNothing else going on here.\u201d\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t you forget it.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\nHe really, really did not, for even years later, after all was said and done and he\u2019d finally admitted some truths to himself and done what ought to be done after his sentence was complete, his friend Peter Burke still laughed every time Special Agent Neal Caffrey reprimanded a young colleague for risking a case by not following the correct procedure."

        "story": "She was a beautiful lady, alright. There was a reason she was the flagship of the Federation, destined to go where no man had gone before; and she would go far, he knew that \u2013 well, even farer than she had before. Granted, he didn\u2019t know much about this Captain Kirk as of yet, just that he had seemed to be a boy wonder at the academy, and those might work out for the best or end up useless; but as long as he had something to tinker with and an engine to take care of, he would be alright.\nAfter all, he had been through many a storm already with different ships, how difficult could it be?\nA few emergencies later, he had to admit he had not reroll considered what it would mean to have to make things up on the fly when everything went wrong, but still, he managed. After all, that was what he was here for. He was not just tinkering away on old cars in Edinburgh, as his grandfather had done; he was working on a spaceship.\nStill, it was not a welcome surprise when they suddenly found themselves dead in the water \u2013 dead in space, he supposed he should call it.\nThe life support still worked, but other than that, nothing. Which in some way was good news because at least he had time to figure out what was going on without them suffocating in the meantime.\nStill, he knew what he had to do in such a moment as this, so he made his way unto the bridge.\n\u201dScotty, how did this happen?\u201d were the first words out of the captain\u2019s mouth and despite everything, he had to suppress a smiled. The instructors in the academy had always told him he should stay professional because no captain worth a damn would call him by a nickname, but Captain Kirk had proven them wrong right from the start.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know sir, but I am working on it.\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cSpock?\u201d\nMr. Spock, as could be expected for any good scienced officer, had a few theories, but nothing concrete as yet, whereas the good doctor was slightly worried about the crew, as he always was, but rather happy that sickbay was still fully operational, so to speak.\nKirk nodded at him and he returned to the engine room to figure out what was going on.\nIt didn\u2019t take long to learn that actually, everything should have been working perfectly. There really was no reason for it not to, apart from the fact that they were in space and everything was possible, there. He quickly did the math. Wall in all, things were not too bad \u2013 they still had a little over 84-hours until they would all end up dead; they\u2019d had to dela with much less.\nWhat he hadn\u2019t counted on was how it would feel too slowly watch all their theories crumble to dust while absolutely nothing changed. It was just as well thy were blessed with such a Captain as Jim kirk and such a first officer as Mr. Spock, because these two at least kept a cool head. And Doctor McCoy for all that he could start complaining as soon as he woke up in the morning, also knew what to do in such moments as this.\nStill, they had to find something, and soon.\nIt was young Chekov who gave him the idea. \u201cYou know, sir, in Russia, we used to do something called\nschemitsa\n. Bear hunting. It was\u2026 a trap. When a bear tried to get through, it would get stuck and either starve or be killed when the hunters returned.\u201d\nHe nodded more out of politeness but then realized that this might actually make sense. Trapping her in this place, waiting for whoever had laid the trap to come back\u2026\n\u201cSir\u201d he hit the intercom, \u201dI\u2019ll need more scans of the area immediately surrounding the Enterprise. I think there might be something there.\u201d\n\u201cConsider it done, Mr. Scott\u201d the Captains\u2019 voice replied.\nA few minutes later, he had the scans. Yes \u2013 just a small but significant higher concentration of epsilon rays than should have been there. It might not have been much, but it was what he could get, and he would work with it.\n\u201cSir!\u201d he all but shouted through the intercom again. \u201cI Think I\u2019ve got it!\u201d\nIt was a little bit more complicated than just dismantling the set of rays that had been laid out like a bear trap in Chekov\u2019s story, but still, three hours later they were free, and he was rather sure it would make an interesting report for the captain to send in.\nWhen he entered the Bridge, the captain said, \u201cWell done, Mr. Scott.\u201d\n\u201cAye, thank you, Captain. All in a day\u2019s work.\u201d"

        "story": "Neal liked to think that even when he had still been looked for by the FBI, he had had standards. There were some things he simply\u00a0 would not do, and endangering people had always been one of them. Peter knew that, and it was probably one of the reasons he had chased him down, yes, but also been friendly and professional once he\u2019d got him, and why they were close friends now.\nStill, of course he was wary when it came to Neal. He had not always been on his best behaviour, and he had perhaps realized what he truly wanted, where he belonged, a little too late, but that didn\u2019t mean \u2013 at least he hoped it didn\u2019t \u2013 that he couldn\u2019t work himself back in his good graces.\nAnd then Agent Lane happened, was sent over to White Collar to make sure everything was above board because of course there was talk that Peter didn\u2019t know how to keep a separation between work and his private life and he and Neal were too close \u2013 thankfully not in\nthat\nway because no one could fathom Peter cheating on Elizabeth, not even the biggest of gossips \u2013 but in the whole \u201cwe are family\u201d way which made Neal feel a little bit guilty because \u2013 well \u2013 again, he had not been as much of an asset as he should have Eben considering the conditions under which he\u2019d been released inti Peter\u2019s custody. Still, no one seemed to really care, and then Agent Lane waltzed in with his talks of regulations and how CIs should be treated and that Peter had not filled out the necessary forms, which was deictic because this was Peter Burke they were talking about and\nof course\nhe had submitted all the paperwork he needed to, only that when someone wanted to make someone\u2019s life a living hell they usually found ways to succeed.\nIt was not difficult to tell that Peter had been rather stressed lately.\nAnd now here they were, and a forged van Eyck has just shown up, and Neal could just tell that Lane was trying to trace it back to him, only that \u2013 well \u2013\nIt was rather awkward, considering everything, but he was innocent. He had no idea where this forgery even came from, but nonetheless this man was determined to see it traced back to him and therefore to Peter, and his friend was not even talking to him about this, which seemed to indicate that he at least suspected him \u2013\nNeal knew it shouldn\u2019t have hurt. It did regardless.\nBut even so, even if there was not\u2026 all of this to deal with, he would still have been worried because it just wasn\u2019t normal for them not to speak for a few days not anymore, and he was just as worried as if it had been Mozzie or El or June or Diana or Clinton\u2026\nHe really had developed quite the social circle, he suddenly realized. There had been a time when he had avoided that, if only to make it easier to leave.\nBut that was neither here nor there \u2013 right now, he had other things to deal with.\nAnd so he went to see Peter in his office.\nHe was working away on some files but immediately raised his head. \u201cAh Neal. Anything wrong?\u201d\nThere was no suspicion in his gaze, so he probably didn\u2019t\nreally\nthink he had the painting stashed away somewhere which was an improvement to the beginning of their work relationship, all in all, and Neal sat down and shrugged. \u201cNot really. Just don\u2019t really get along with the new guy, that\u2019s all.\u201d\nPeter grimaced. \u201cHis assessment will only take two more days, or so he tells me. No idea what he hopes to find.\u201d\nHe was about to say something when he sighed and said, \u201cThe truth is \u2013 Neal, you should keep your head down. If guys like this want to find anything, they usually do, and I don\u2019t want to \u2013\u201c\n\u201cSo what if we give him something to chase?\u201d he suggested because he already had a few ideas. After all, they had to figure out a way to do their work, while they could not do efficiently with the guy hanging around, and something like calling in anonymous tips about stolen art was hardly against the law\u2026\n\u201cNeal\u2026\u201d\n\"I won't let you down\" he promised, knowing even as he did so that Peter had no reason to believe him.
