        "writing_prompt": "At Elsinore Junior Academy, the staff room is haunted by the ghost of a former headmaster, the students are chaos incarnate, and the supply teacher is starting to wonder if the camel rumors are true. What could possibly go wrong next?",
        "story": "Horatio was about to enter the staff room of Elsinore Junior Academy at the end of a trying week, which was basically every week, so this could be rephrased as the end of the current trying week.\nHowever, Fortinbras, the latest supply teacher, stopped him and said, \u201cPlease tell me that isn\u2019t a ghost in the staff room.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it is,\u201d Horatio said, \u201che always comes for the after school review.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s the last headmaster, can\u2019t let things go, despite being dead.\u201d\n\u201cThey warned me this was a strange place, but that\u2019s ridiculous. What does he do?\u201d\n\u201cNot a lot. Complains a bit, but everyone ignores him, rather like they did at the time in fact.\u201d\nHoratio opened the door, and they went in together. Horatio looked across the room and said, \u201cYou\u2019d better move out of that chair.\u201d Since the ghost didn\u2019t move, he added, \u201cOr Claudius will sit on you.\u201d The ghost reluctantly moved and sat on the filing cabinet.\n\u201cMaybe you can fill me in on something else,\u201d Fortinbras continued. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to the teacher I\u2019m currently replacing?\u201d\n\u201cThat was Hamlet, he\u2019s on sick leave. He kept seeing things.\u201d\n\u201cBut the ghost is real!\u201d\n\u201cThings no-one else could see. He spent one day convinced there was a camel in his room. The kids thought it was hilarious, of course.\u201d\n\u201cThat explains why they all laughed when camels came up in my geography lesson.\u201d\n\u201cYes, probably best to avoid them for the moment. Also, weasels and whales. Claudius found out about that when he saw half the class carrying buckets of water down the corridor and upon enquiry was told Sir had told them to fetch it. Claudius sent them to tip the water down the sinks and went into the classroom to find this was the second half of the class and the first half had already poured theirs all over the floor.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re having me on!\u201d\n\u201cI can show you photos to prove it. The caretaker had to come and dry it up.\u201d\nBy now, most of the rest of the staff had come into the staff room and Claudius followed them. \u201cRight, he said, \u201ccan I have a quick rundown of this week\u2019s disasters. Forget the minor ones, or we\u2019ll be here until Monday morning. And where\u2019s Polonius?\u201d\n\u201cOn his way to hospital,\u201d Gertrude said. \u201cHe was running some ball games with his class in the playground when he tripped over one of the marker cones and fell onto the playground, temporarily knocking himself out. We think he\u2019ll be okay, but it seemed a wise precaution.\u201d\n\u201cSo long as he\u2019s back by Monday, he can take all weekend to recover. What else?\u201d\n\u201cSomething\u2019s eaten all the nuts and berries from my nature table,\u201d Ophelia said.\n\u201cOne of your pupils?\u201d\n\u201cOh no. I think we have mice.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right them. Mice are all part of nature. You did remove the deadly nightshade berries, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cYes, as you requested. I\u2019m glad none of the mice got to eat them.\u201d\n\u201cThe mice probably have more sense, which is more than can be said for most of your class. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some very exciting news,\u201d Rosencrantz said.\n\u201cThe music club have been invited to perform at the junior school festival,\u201d Guildenstern added.\n\u201cHave you thought about what you will play?\u201d Claudius asked.\n\u201cWe have six recorder players who are really doing well now,\u201d Rosencrantz replied.\n\u201cGood. And how tunes do they know?\u201d\n\u201cJust Three Blind Mice,\u201d Guildenstern said, \u201cbut they can play it very well.\u201d\n\u201cThen I suggest you had better politely decline the invitation. If there\u2019s nothing else, then we can just have a quick discussion of the proposed school trip. Laertes, where are you suggesting we visit?\u201d\n\u201cA trip on the River Thames would be nice,\u201d the ghost said. \u201cI\u2019d enjoy that.\u201d\n\u201cFirstly, I am not taking our lot anywhere near large bodies of water. And secondly, you are not coming with us,\u201d Claudius said firmly. \u201cLaertes?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a few enquiries, but so far, as soon as they know I\u2019m from Elsinore Junior Academy, they instantly find they\u2019re fully booked up until the end of next term.\u201d\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t that surprise me?\u201d"

        "writing_prompt": "When a strict new curate takes over your small village choir, his lofty musical ambitions clash hilariously with the choir's... unique approach to rehearsals.",
        "story": "Tom Hill and I were slightly late for choir practice one evening, as we had had to wait for Tom\u2019s son, George, who had been delayed, to convey us there. We had assumed that the choir would begin without us, for it was not unusual for someone to be late most weeks, since at least half worked on the farms around the village and cows calving and escaping hens are no respecters of choir rehearsal times. However, to our surprise, we heard no singing, but instead the new curate looked disapprovingly at us, and said, \u201cGood, we can now begin. Please take your places without any further delay.\u201d\nWe were rehearsing for a special service for St James Day, our church name day. We struggled through the opening hymn, with the curate stopping us several times to correct pronunciation. To my mind this was a pointless exercise, we are in the middle of rural Sussex and most of the choir managed to revert to their usual accents every time we started a new verse.\nThe curate then handed out the music he had chosen for the anthem. \u201cWe shall be singing in four parts,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease look through your part and we will practise the first section tonight. As you can see, this is in four sections, and we shall therefore need additional rehearsals before the service.\u201d\nThere was general mutterings about this. We normally fit in a few extra rehearsals before Christmas and Easter, but summer evenings are too important to give up extra time. Many who are at work during the day will be in their gardens in the evening, tending to not only their flowers, but also the vegetables which will be important to their families for the autumn and winter. In addition, both our cricket umpires sing in the choir, and they would therefore not miss midweek matches.\nThe curate seemed oblivious to these protests and instead, after a few minutes said, \u201cRight, we will try the first ten bars.\u201d\nHe started to conduct, and everyone waited patiently. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you singing?\u201d he snapped.\n\u201cWe\u2019re waiting for you to sing the tune to us,\u201d the church warden said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve given you the music, what more do you need?\u201d\nI realised the majority of the choir members were looking at me, so reluctantly I explained. \u201cMost of the choir don\u2019t read music. You need to sing the tune and then they\u2019ll copy it.\u201d\n\u201cHow did they get to be in the choir? This is ridiculous. I\u2019m going to speak to the vicar.\u201d\nHe stormed out but had failed to realise the vicar\u2019s cat had strolled into the church earlier and had been enjoying the evening sunshine as it came through one of the windows. Hearing the footsteps coming down the aisle, the cat leapt up and made a dash for the door, tripping the curate up in the process.\nHaving picked himself up, the curate left the church.\n\u201cHe should have rehearsed his exit,\u201d one of the basses sitting behind me said.\nThe choir decided unanimously to head for the Red Lion before the man should return."

        "story": "\u201cStop moaning and be grateful,\u201d John Watson said. \u201cAt least we\u2019re inside, which means we\u2019re not quite as cold as we would be otherwise.\u201d\nSherlock Holmes, who was wearing a skeleton outfit, groaned. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the Haunted House is a proper insulated building, it\u2019s just a couple of sheds, plus the reindeer stable, converted for the occasion.\u201d He looked critically at John. \u201cIs that ghost costume padded? You look bigger than you did yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a thick jumper underneath my sheet. The one you told me was extremely unflattering. Which it may be, but it\u2019s also warm.\u201d John tried, and failed, to keep the smugness out of his voice.\nSherlock was about to reply when the Tannoy blared.\nPlaces everyone. The gates open in ten minutes.\nTogether they headed towards the Haunted House. Partway they passed a dragon which was lying on its side, groaning, and waving its legs rather ineffectively in the air.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d John said cheerfully, \u201cwe\u2019ll let Greg know you need some help.\u201d\nThere was what sounded like muffled swearing from the dragon, which tried to kick John with one of its back legs. John moved out of its way and said, \u201cTemper, temper!\u201d\nWhen they reached the Haunted House, they found Anderson standing mournfully outside.\n\u201cSomeone eaten all your apples?\u201d John asked.\n\u201cI wish,\u201d Anderson replied. \u201cNo, I\u2019m stuck out here, making toffee apples in the cold, while Sally gets to be inside.\u201d\n\u201cShould have worn a woolly hat!\u201d\nOnce inside, John greeted Sally with, \u201cI hear you\u2019ve been promoted to an inside job.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed. \u201cIt gets quite windy outside which was blowing the candy floss everywhere.\u201d\n\u201cAs I thought,\u201d Sherlock said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t concern for your welfare, but not wanting to lose candy floss.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not bothered about the reasoning. I\u2019m inside and I don\u2019t have to listen to Anderson\u2019s moaning.\u201d\nAt that point Greg arrived. \u201cRight,\u201d he said, \u201cremember you\u2019re to make them squeal with fright, not cry with fear. It\u2019s to be a pleasurable experience. We don\u2019t want any more complaints.\u201d\n\u201cWhose been complaining?\u201d Sherlock asked.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t you. Apparently the dragon bit someone yesterday. Some kid decided to put their head in the dragon\u2019s mouth to see what was there. And the dragon closed its mouth. Forcibly. There were tooth marks on the kid\u2019s neck.\u201d\n\u201cDragon ate our Albert!\u201d Sally said.\n\u201cWhat? How do you know the kid was called Albert?\u201d Sherlock asked.\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d John said. \u201cOh, speaking of dragons, it\u2019s fallen over and can\u2019t get back up again.\u201d\n\u201cIt will,\u201d Greg said. \u201cI\u2019ll prod it with St George\u2019s spear.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why is there a dragon? They\u2019re not traditional Hallowe\u2019en creatures.\u201d\n\u201cMycroft got a cheap George and the Dragon costume. We\u2019re not using the George part, although the spear is quite useful. The dragon costume needs adjusting. At the moment Seb\u2019s at the front and Jim\u2019s at the back. Molly thinks it would work better with Jim at the front, but Seb doesn\u2019t fit in the back half. I must be off, dragon to right, punters to welcome. Have a good day, folks!\u201d\nWith that Greg departed, ignoring the various rude words flung in his direction."
