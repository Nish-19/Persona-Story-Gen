What secrets does her gray corner hold, and what does it mean for a world that forgot how to live without color?",
        "story": "The whole world could still be gray, as it was in the past, in those old movies. But then one day colors came, sometime between then and here. I think it must have been the wars. After the wars people said, We need some reason to be less upset. Someone suggested, Colors? The world agreed that colors were needed, to pull everyone out of the despair of the dying, and all those piled-up bones. Colors were brought in. They were just carted in on trucks, and everyone took their fill. It was a job for every person on the planet to put colors where they ought to be. Some things were decided in advance, like making the grass green, and you\u2019d get a ticket if you made yours red or blue. But other things you could decide, like the color of your shirt. It was a small committee of people who made the big decisions, they were necessary, but then so was every humble individual, doing their own job. The world sighed in relief: everything was so much more beautiful now! And for several days there were no wars, just people enjoying the colors, but humans adapt quickly to what is beautiful and nice, and then the wars started up again, and the committee was disbanded.\n\nA long time ago I was part of this committee\u2014not the original one, but the commemorative one, made up of the committee\u2019s daughters. We gathered to take notes about what had really happened in those conversations, so that we could tell the world. We asked our fathers, What was it like to be on the committee? How did the meetings go? But they had lost their memories, some of them, and others were angry at the other committee members, and wouldn\u2019t tell us why. We gathered very little information to save for the world, for posterity. Then we disbanded, too. We said to ourselves, Let\u2019s just enjoy the colors. Who cares how they got here? So we did. We became just like everyone else, not archivists of the past, but regular folks walking through the colors of the present, as if we didn\u2019t know anything.\n\nThen, one day, Amanda thought we should actually just talk to the people of the world who had participated in dispersing colors over the land, just regular folk, the ones who did it. The rest of the daughters were tired, but I wanted to do it with her, because I liked her and it sounded fun. I asked if she thought I should bring my movie camera, and she said yes, we could make a documentary. We went to a little town and just stood in the square and accosted people who were going about their Sunday shopping and asked them what it was like when there started to be colors, and had they participated in coloring everything? We only asked the old people. Most people didn\u2019t want to talk to us, but one old woman did. She invited us back to her apartment for tea.\n\nHer apartment was full of colors, just like the rest of the world, except for one corner, which was still gray. It was her own secret corner that hadn\u2019t been colored\u2014perhaps the only place in the world like this! The world would have been agitated to know that a corner had not been filled in; but she said that in fifty years, sixty, seventy, she had not let anyone in. She preferred to give up husbands and friends, so she could keep one corner of the world not colored.\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\nIt was clearly restful to her to have it, as restful as a little gray mouse that\u2019s a friend. Oh, she told us, as she spoke for the camera, avoiding eye contact with it, her fingers playing with her teacup on her little china saucer, it was all anyone could talk about\u2014what color are you going to make this? What color are you going to make that? Isn\u2019t it all so beautiful now? How did we ever live with all that grayness? Why did it take the world so long? Isn\u2019t it nice how we are all co\u00f6perating?\n\nShe was making little sour expressions as she imitated those people from so long ago, many of whom were dead now, she said. She had got into the craze for a little while too, coloring everything in sight, even things that weren\u2019t in her jurisdiction to color, like the neighbor\u2019s fencing.\n\nBut one day she returned to her apartment, where she hadn\u2019t yet filled in the corner. She had been coloring other things, she had just put it off. She thought, I\u2019m tired, I\u2019ll do it tomorrow. She told us this with downcast eyes. And what happened? Well, tomorrow turned into tomorrow, as it does for so many of us. It kept appearing on her to-do list, like one of those items that are there for so many months you don\u2019t even notice them anymore. And the months turned to years, and somehow she never did it. What is it with those things that never make it off the list? Is it that we actually don\u2019t want to do them? Or that we don\u2019t even need to do them? We put them on there because we think we should. Why don\u2019t we just take them off already? So finally she took it off, and by that time the world didn\u2019t even have enough color left that she could use to fill in the corner.\n\nShe stayed in that apartment\u2014various friends encouraged her to move, for the immigrants were moving into her building, and so her friends thought that she ought to move. But, although she wasn\u2019t a fan of the immigrants, she didn\u2019t mind them so much, they were nice neighbors, and that dull corner reassured her in a funny little way. She looked at it every day as she took her tea. No, she didn\u2019t have anybody over, and, yes, her lovely immigrant neighbors thought she was a snob, but really what was she supposed to do if one of them found out, and said something to somebody? She couldn\u2019t take the risk. And so she didn\u2019t take the risk. She finally stood up to let us out, very very sadly. She told us to please not air our documentary, or write about it, until she died. She wanted to live with that little corner like that until she died, and not be taken away or to jail, or for somebody from some committee to come and color it in, so we agreed, because we felt sorry for her, and we liked her.\n\nWell, she finally died last year, and next week our documentary airs, but we are sad about it. Mostly we wish we hadn\u2019t been waiting for this anniversary, the one-year anniversary of her death, with the sort of desire everyone feels to show the world what they\u2019ve made. We\u2019re proud of the short film we created, and that we found this story, but not that she had to die in order for us to put it into the world. Better that she had lived, and lived with her corner, than that we got to show our film. Why is there always so much sadness when something good occurs, a balance between the good and the bad? Couldn\u2019t she have said, Show your film to the world! and felt safe that no one cared any longer about one little corner not being filled in? No, but perhaps she knew something we did not, about colors, and grayness, and corners, and what is allowed to you in your privacy, in your tiny little apartment, and what is not.\n\n"
