        "writing_prompt": "After moving into their dream apartment, Romi witnesses a neighbor's tragic death, but as the days pass, she begins to suspect the act was somehow meant to shatter her own carefully constructed life.",
        "story": "Three days after they moved into their new apartment, the woman who lived above them, on the eighth floor, jumped out of her window. Romi was just coming back from the coffee shop, carrying two lattes, when the neighbor hit the sidewalk. Romi dropped the tray, spilling coffee all over herself, and her eyes locked in on the stains on her sweatpants so she wouldn\u2019t have to see anything else. She heard running, panting, and voices shouting. Within seconds, a crowd had gathered, and the sweaty guy who cleaned the lobby was calling an ambulance. Someone said that the woman\u2019s name was Rinat or Ronit, and someone else said that she\u2019d seen her crying in the elevator a few days earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s because of COVID,\u201d the cleaner said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s committing suicide these days. They were just talking about it on the news.\u201d\n\nThe distant sirens mingled with the vibration of Romi\u2019s cell. It was Daniel, but she didn\u2019t want to tell him anything over the phone. She touched her cheeks to make sure she wasn\u2019t crying, took a deep breath, and walked into the building. \u201cHey!\u201d she heard the cleaner calling after her, and, when she turned around, he yelled, \u201cLady, where d\u2019you think you\u2019re going? You\u2019re a witness.\u201d \u201cA witness to what?\u201d Romi asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d But the cleaner wouldn\u2019t back down. \u201cYou were the closest one!\u201d he shouted. \u201cLook\u2014her blood\u2019s all over your clothes!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not blood. It\u2019s coffee. I dropped my coffee,\u201d Romi said. \u201cWell, it looks like blood to me,\u201d the cleaner proclaimed. \u201cThe police should have a look at it.\u201d Romi froze for a moment, but, when her phone started vibrating again, she kept walking. \u201cHey!\u201d the cleaner yelled again, but then a different male voice said, \u201cPoor girl. Leave her alone.\u201d\n\nDaniel opened the door irritably. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering my calls?\u201d he asked, but, before she could explain, he saw the stains on her sweats and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Are you O.K.?\u201d Romi wanted to tell him about the neighbor who\u2019d jumped and about the bossy cleaner and about how the stains on her pants would probably never come out, but all she could manage was a strange whimper. Daniel gave her one of his feeble hugs in which he barely touched her. \u201cCome on, baby, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\nShe told him everything. She wanted to feel sorry for the neighbor and say how horrible it was and how she must have really been suffering, but all that came out was anger. They\u2019d plunked down 3.4 million shekels for this apartment. Daniel\u2019s mother had given them almost a million and a half, and they\u2019d taken out a twenty-three-year mortgage for the rest. Twenty-three years! If Daniel got her pregnant now, having post-traumatic sex, she thought, the kid would grow up, finish school, join the army, fight a war, and be discharged\u2014and she and Daniel would still be paying for the apartment every month. And every time he came home from kindergarten\u2014this kid who didn\u2019t even exist yet\u2014or from high school, or on leave from the army, he would step over the spot where that Rinat or Ronit woman\u2019s body now lay.\n\nThe sales pitch for their apartment building had been that it was for \u201cupwardly mobile young professionals.\u201d People who bought homes here wanted to improve their lives: they took out loans, they poured in blood, sweat, and tears, and for what? So that some Rinat or Ronit would jump out her window and crush the life out of them? Even if the woman was depressed, she could at least have acknowledged that she wasn\u2019t the only person in this world and had the decency to kill herself in her bed or in the bathroom. If she simply had to jump out a window, then why not do it at a hotel instead of onto her neighbor\u2019s head? \u201cI don\u2019t want this,\u201d Romi told Daniel. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live here anymore. I can\u2019t live in a building where people jump.\u201d \u201cCalm down, babe,\u201d Daniel said, lightly stroking her back. \u201cIt\u2019s not the building. It\u2019s one woman who jumped. Poor thing. It has nothing to do with us at all.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not a poor thing,\u201d Romi fumed. \u201cI\u2019m the poor thing! Me and you and your mom. For this she dipped into her pension? So some neighbor whose name we don\u2019t even know could commit suicide right on our heads?\u201d\n\nThe woman\u2019s name turned out to be Sarit, and the next day Daniel insisted that they go to the funeral. He said that they needed closure, and that, as far as he was concerned, it was either a funeral or couples therapy. Romi had no desire to go to the funeral, but therapy sounded even worse, like a cross between mud wrestling and divorce court. Daniel typed the cemetery\u2019s address into Waze, and they hardly spoke the whole way there. When they arrived, he insisted on buying flowers from some religious guy who was selling half-wilted bunches out of black buckets. There were maybe ten other people there, and the only one she recognized was the cleaner from the lobby, who hurried over and said that it was totally unacceptable that she\u2019d left before the police got there yesterday. Instead of standing by her and telling the cleaner to leave her alone, Daniel nodded and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re right,\u201d and the cleaner walked away and came back a minute later with an elderly couple whose eyes were puffy. \u201cYou see?\u201d he said, gesturing at Romi. \u201cThis is the neighbor I told you about, who saw your daughter fall.\u201d The elderly man nodded and held out his hand, and, even though Romi and Daniel were very strict about social distancing, they both shook his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Isaac,\u201d he said, \u201cand this is Shoshana.\u201d After a moment, perhaps because no one else said anything, he added, \u201cWe\u2019re Sarit\u2019s parents,\u201d and, as soon as he said that, Shoshana started crying. \u201cWhen she fell,\u201d Isaac asked Romi, \u201ccould you see her? Her face?\u201d Romi didn\u2019t answer. She didn\u2019t know what to say, and she hoped that, if she waited long enough, Daniel would say something to get her out of it. But Daniel was quiet, and they all stood in silence, except for the mother, who kept weeping.\n\nThat night, Daniel fell asleep instantly and started snoring. Romi lay awake in bed for almost an hour, and then she got up, rolled a joint, and went out onto the balcony. A friend of Daniel\u2019s had sold them the pot; it smelled like cookies and was really potent. Romi looked down over the railing and tried to find the spot where the Sarit woman had hit the ground. At the funeral, the cleaner had talked about how the gray sidewalk had been covered with blood, but now, from seven floors up, everything looked clean and fresh, and a young couple were standing there making out.\n\nWhen Romi had told Daniel that she was angry at the woman for deciding to kill herself right as she was walking up, Daniel said that she was self-centered and it was time for her to grasp that not everything in the world had to do with her. But now, as she watched the couple practically fucking on the neatly trimmed hedge in front of her building, she couldn\u2019t help thinking that it definitely did have something to do with her. And that maybe Sarit had once believed that the new smell coming from the walls and the gleaming white marble in the lobby would restart her life, and then, when she\u2019d looked out and seen Romi coming back from the coffee shop in her sweats, she\u2019d had the impression, from that high-up vantage point, that Romi was happy and living in a perfect marriage, that she and Daniel were as close as the two paper cups in her coffee carrier. And maybe Sarit couldn\u2019t take it anymore, so she\u2019d jumped out the window in order to ruin everything for Romi. Just as Romi was dying to plummet onto those moaning lovers and knock the lust out of them.\n\n"
