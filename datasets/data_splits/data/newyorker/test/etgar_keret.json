        "writing_prompt": "After moving into their dream apartment, Romi witnesses a neighbor's tragic death, but as the days pass, she begins to suspect the act was somehow meant to shatter her own carefully constructed life.",
        "story": "Three days after they moved into their new apartment, the woman who lived above them, on the eighth floor, jumped out of her window. Romi was just coming back from the coffee shop, carrying two lattes, when the neighbor hit the sidewalk. Romi dropped the tray, spilling coffee all over herself, and her eyes locked in on the stains on her sweatpants so she wouldn\u2019t have to see anything else. She heard running, panting, and voices shouting. Within seconds, a crowd had gathered, and the sweaty guy who cleaned the lobby was calling an ambulance. Someone said that the woman\u2019s name was Rinat or Ronit, and someone else said that she\u2019d seen her crying in the elevator a few days earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s because of COVID,\u201d the cleaner said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s committing suicide these days. They were just talking about it on the news.\u201d\n\nThe distant sirens mingled with the vibration of Romi\u2019s cell. It was Daniel, but she didn\u2019t want to tell him anything over the phone. She touched her cheeks to make sure she wasn\u2019t crying, took a deep breath, and walked into the building. \u201cHey!\u201d she heard the cleaner calling after her, and, when she turned around, he yelled, \u201cLady, where d\u2019you think you\u2019re going? You\u2019re a witness.\u201d \u201cA witness to what?\u201d Romi asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d But the cleaner wouldn\u2019t back down. \u201cYou were the closest one!\u201d he shouted. \u201cLook\u2014her blood\u2019s all over your clothes!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not blood. It\u2019s coffee. I dropped my coffee,\u201d Romi said. \u201cWell, it looks like blood to me,\u201d the cleaner proclaimed. \u201cThe police should have a look at it.\u201d Romi froze for a moment, but, when her phone started vibrating again, she kept walking. \u201cHey!\u201d the cleaner yelled again, but then a different male voice said, \u201cPoor girl. Leave her alone.\u201d\n\nDaniel opened the door irritably. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering my calls?\u201d he asked, but, before she could explain, he saw the stains on her sweats and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Are you O.K.?\u201d Romi wanted to tell him about the neighbor who\u2019d jumped and about the bossy cleaner and about how the stains on her pants would probably never come out, but all she could manage was a strange whimper. Daniel gave her one of his feeble hugs in which he barely touched her. \u201cCome on, baby, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\nShe told him everything. She wanted to feel sorry for the neighbor and say how horrible it was and how she must have really been suffering, but all that came out was anger. They\u2019d plunked down 3.4 million shekels for this apartment. Daniel\u2019s mother had given them almost a million and a half, and they\u2019d taken out a twenty-three-year mortgage for the rest. Twenty-three years! If Daniel got her pregnant now, having post-traumatic sex, she thought, the kid would grow up, finish school, join the army, fight a war, and be discharged\u2014and she and Daniel would still be paying for the apartment every month. And every time he came home from kindergarten\u2014this kid who didn\u2019t even exist yet\u2014or from high school, or on leave from the army, he would step over the spot where that Rinat or Ronit woman\u2019s body now lay.\n\nThe sales pitch for their apartment building had been that it was for \u201cupwardly mobile young professionals.\u201d People who bought homes here wanted to improve their lives: they took out loans, they poured in blood, sweat, and tears, and for what? So that some Rinat or Ronit would jump out her window and crush the life out of them? Even if the woman was depressed, she could at least have acknowledged that she wasn\u2019t the only person in this world and had the decency to kill herself in her bed or in the bathroom. If she simply had to jump out a window, then why not do it at a hotel instead of onto her neighbor\u2019s head? \u201cI don\u2019t want this,\u201d Romi told Daniel. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live here anymore. I can\u2019t live in a building where people jump.\u201d \u201cCalm down, babe,\u201d Daniel said, lightly stroking her back. \u201cIt\u2019s not the building. It\u2019s one woman who jumped. Poor thing. It has nothing to do with us at all.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not a poor thing,\u201d Romi fumed. \u201cI\u2019m the poor thing! Me and you and your mom. For this she dipped into her pension? So some neighbor whose name we don\u2019t even know could commit suicide right on our heads?\u201d\n\nThe woman\u2019s name turned out to be Sarit, and the next day Daniel insisted that they go to the funeral. He said that they needed closure, and that, as far as he was concerned, it was either a funeral or couples therapy. Romi had no desire to go to the funeral, but therapy sounded even worse, like a cross between mud wrestling and divorce court. Daniel typed the cemetery\u2019s address into Waze, and they hardly spoke the whole way there. When they arrived, he insisted on buying flowers from some religious guy who was selling half-wilted bunches out of black buckets. There were maybe ten other people there, and the only one she recognized was the cleaner from the lobby, who hurried over and said that it was totally unacceptable that she\u2019d left before the police got there yesterday. Instead of standing by her and telling the cleaner to leave her alone, Daniel nodded and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re right,\u201d and the cleaner walked away and came back a minute later with an elderly couple whose eyes were puffy. \u201cYou see?\u201d he said, gesturing at Romi. \u201cThis is the neighbor I told you about, who saw your daughter fall.\u201d The elderly man nodded and held out his hand, and, even though Romi and Daniel were very strict about social distancing, they both shook his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Isaac,\u201d he said, \u201cand this is Shoshana.\u201d After a moment, perhaps because no one else said anything, he added, \u201cWe\u2019re Sarit\u2019s parents,\u201d and, as soon as he said that, Shoshana started crying. \u201cWhen she fell,\u201d Isaac asked Romi, \u201ccould you see her? Her face?\u201d Romi didn\u2019t answer. She didn\u2019t know what to say, and she hoped that, if she waited long enough, Daniel would say something to get her out of it. But Daniel was quiet, and they all stood in silence, except for the mother, who kept weeping.\n\nThat night, Daniel fell asleep instantly and started snoring. Romi lay awake in bed for almost an hour, and then she got up, rolled a joint, and went out onto the balcony. A friend of Daniel\u2019s had sold them the pot; it smelled like cookies and was really potent. Romi looked down over the railing and tried to find the spot where the Sarit woman had hit the ground. At the funeral, the cleaner had talked about how the gray sidewalk had been covered with blood, but now, from seven floors up, everything looked clean and fresh, and a young couple were standing there making out.\n\nWhen Romi had told Daniel that she was angry at the woman for deciding to kill herself right as she was walking up, Daniel said that she was self-centered and it was time for her to grasp that not everything in the world had to do with her. But now, as she watched the couple practically fucking on the neatly trimmed hedge in front of her building, she couldn\u2019t help thinking that it definitely did have something to do with her. And that maybe Sarit had once believed that the new smell coming from the walls and the gleaming white marble in the lobby would restart her life, and then, when she\u2019d looked out and seen Romi coming back from the coffee shop in her sweats, she\u2019d had the impression, from that high-up vantage point, that Romi was happy and living in a perfect marriage, that she and Daniel were as close as the two paper cups in her coffee carrier. And maybe Sarit couldn\u2019t take it anymore, so she\u2019d jumped out the window in order to ruin everything for Romi. Just as Romi was dying to plummet onto those moaning lovers and knock the lust out of them.\n\n"

        "story": "Yogev and I sit on the tattered couch in his brother\u2019s living room, waiting for the Molly to kick in.\n\nYogev\u2019s brother is a dealer. He hates it when people call him a dealer. Says he\u2019s just buying for friends. But he\u2019s the mother of all dealers. Looks like a lizard. Cold-blooded. Takes money from his own little brother, but gives him a thirty-per-cent discount, like he\u2019s generosity personified. While we wait for the high to kick in, he drones on about how this is primo shit, super pricey, and how he paid top dollar to the Dutchman who sold it to him and now he\u2019s losing money on us. Yeah, right, Dutchman. I guarantee he bought the whole stash from some Arab kid in Jaffa. \u201cWhen this shit goes to your head, it\u2019s straight to the penthouse!\u201d he gushes. \u201cRocket launch. No stops.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I say to Yogev. \u201cWe bought it, we popped it, now it\u2019s beach time.\u201d Yogev\u2019s plan is to get high and go pick up girls on the beach. He did it with his brother once\u2014got lit and went down to the promenade and came home with a Norwegian tourist. Normally, he wouldn\u2019t have the balls to talk to a girl like that, especially not in English. But the Molly made Yogev feel powerful, like a superhero. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he told her. \u201cIf God appears on Earth right now and grants me one wish, I\u2019ll ask him for ten minutes to go down on you. If he says, \u2018You can have another one,\u2019 I\u2019ll ask for eternal life. If I get a third, I might go for peace in the Middle East\u2014throw a bone to my country. But, if he cheaps out and all I get is one, then it\u2019s just going down on you.\u201d Then he looked up at the clouds, like some dipshit, like he really was waiting for God to appear. The Norwegian chick laughed and said, \u201cYou\u2019re cute. Fucked up, but cute.\u201d They spent the whole night going at it in his brother\u2019s apartment. She was so happy, she had tears streaming down her face. He cried, too. From the joy, from the high, from both.\n\nEtgar Keret on writing as anger management.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I tell Yogev for the second time. \u201cWe paid, we swallowed, let\u2019s get the fuck out of here. We said we\u2019d go to the beach to find girls.\u201d Yogev doesn\u2019t move. This is the fourth time he\u2019s done Molly. And it\u2019s always the same thing. He doesn\u2019t feel anything. Then he takes a shit. The stuff goes to his head only after he drops a load. It\u2019s like uncorking a bottle. \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna happen until I take a dump,\u201d he says. And the last thing he wants is for the urge to come when he\u2019s out. The bathrooms at the beach are all wet and stinky and there\u2019s never any paper. Even when there is, it\u2019s scratchy, it doesn\u2019t breathe, like those napkins you get at a hummus joint next to a gas station.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the stick up your ass?\u201d Yogev\u2019s lizard brother asks me, flicking his forty-inch TV on to the fashion network. \u201cScared you\u2019ll lose your high before you get downstairs? This is primo shit. It\u2019ll give you ten hours at least. I guarantee it.\u201d\n\nI keep sitting there without saying anything. I\u2019m not in the mood for a fight. On the fashion network, a flat-chested but pretty model is being interviewed. She talks a lot, but we can\u2019t hear what she\u2019s saying, because the TV\u2019s on mute. Yogev\u2019s brother gives her a horny look. He didn\u2019t take anything\u2014he\u2019s just horny. Like Yogev, I\u2019m not feeling the Molly yet. It\u2019s my first time taking it. \u201cPut some music on,\u201d Yogev says, but his brother doesn\u2019t budge, just keeps looking at the model moving her lips and being careful not to smear her mascara when she wipes a tear from her eye.\n\nPodcast: The Writer\u2019s Voice\nListen to Etgar Keret read \u201cMitzvah.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot now,\u201d the lizard hisses, without taking his eyes off the screen. \u201cYou\u2019re interrupting the words I\u2019m making up for her.\u201d\n\nI try to help out. \u201cSeriously, dude,\u201d I say to the lizard, \u201cplay us some music.\u201d\n\nYogev\u2019s brother puts a finger on his lips, like a teacher shushing me. \u201cSh-h-h,\u201d he says. \u201cSee her now? She\u2019s saying, \u2018It\u2019s been seven years since I got any, and I am so ready for it.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cSeven?\u201d I say. \u201cThat chick isn\u2019t even twenty yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen four,\u201d Yogev\u2019s brother says, and lights a cigarette. \u201cDon\u2019t interrupt.\u201d\n\nYogev\u2019s getting impatient: \u201cGo on, give us some music. And a Coke.\u201d His brother picks up a remote control from the table and turns on the stereo at top volume. It\u2019s trance. But the crap kind. Mindless beats. \u201cAnd a Coke,\u201d Yogev repeats.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any Coke,\u201d his brother snaps. \u201cThere\u2019s water in the tap.\u201d\n\n\nYogev says he can\u2019t be bothered to get up, and then he heads off. But not to the kitchen. To take a shit. I watch the model do a hair toss at the camera, and I can finally feel the Molly kicking in. Yogev keeps up his soundtrack: \u201cNow she\u2019s saying, \u2018I\u2019d kill to be sucking on some dick right now, but only with a hot guy who knows what he\u2019s doing.\u2019 In other words\u201d\u2014he flashes his gross smile at me\u2014\u201cyou\u2019re outta luck, loser.\u201d\n\nSara Bareilles talks with Rachel Syme\n\n\nThrough the thumping bass line, I hear Yogev hollering in the bathroom like he\u2019s trying to lift a two-hundred-pound weight. And then a plop. Or maybe I just imagined that. It almost sounded too loud. Like someone threw a brick in the toilet. A minute later, he comes out, sweating, and says, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\nOutside, the sky is blue and reddish. The colors of the cars and the traffic lights get all mixed up in my head, but in a good way. A dry breeze cools my face. A bendy bus honks and almost runs me over. Yogev turns seaward, moving fast: every second we waste on Allenby Street is a second with no hot tourist. I try to keep up.\n\nBy the Great Synagogue, a bald guy with a big black yarmulke stops us and mumbles something about a mitzvah. \u201cNot a penny on us,\u201d Yogev lies, but the bald guy keeps talking. Says he\u2019s not after money. Tells us about some eighty-year-old dude called Sasson, who comes every day for evening prayers and on Saturday mornings, too. Sixteen years the man hasn\u2019t missed a service. But today he didn\u2019t show up. So they call his cell phone and his son answers: Sasson\u2019s in the hospital. Broke his pelvis in the shower. And now the sun\u2019s setting and they\u2019re short one man for a quorum. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get ten men for the minyan, it won\u2019t work,\u201d the bald guy says with a sigh, like the prayers are a cell phone that has to be charged with the right cable. \u201cDo a mitzvah, guys, make up the minyan for us.\u201d\n\nYogev laughs like an idiot. At first, he thought the bald guy was a bum, and now he\u2019s confused. \u201cMe? Now? Prayers? Are you for real?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be religious,\u201d the bald guy insists. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to believe. Do it for your fellow-man. It\u2019s like if my car got stuck and you helped me jump it.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Yogev says. \u201cAnd what makes you think I\u2019d help you jump your car if you got stuck?\u201d\n\nThe bald guy comes close and puts his hand on my shoulder. He smells. Like airplane food. He looks at me with his enormous eyes\u2014the eyes of a cow the second before it\u2019s slaughtered. To me, in my state, it looks like he\u2019s about to cry.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d I say to Yogev. \u201cLet\u2019s pray, no big deal. Come on, it\u2019s going to be a blast.\u201d\n\nYogev shakes his head and walks away, toward the sea. Splitting off from Yogev and staying on my own in the middle of Allenby, high as a kite, seems like a bad idea. But I also can\u2019t leave the cow-eyed bald guy. I want to fuck, but I also want to be a good person. And praying is super easy. Much easier than talking to girls.\n\nThe synagogue is huge but empty. The bald guy brings me a prayer book and a white yarmulke with golden embroidery. It has a stain on it. Not exactly a stain but a kind of sticky patch caked with dirt. It\u2019s a gross shade of brown, but it\u2019s on the side that doesn\u2019t touch your head, so I put the yarmulke on and fasten it with a hair clip. I haven\u2019t opened a prayer book since my bar mitzvah. Nine years, and I still remember my portion by heart, and how I was so afraid to mess up, and how they threw candy at me afterward and one piece hit me in the eye.\n\nThere are eight guys there in addition to the bald one. Almost all of them have one foot in the grave. There\u2019s only one young dude, with an earring, and eyebrows plucked like a girl\u2019s. Of course he\u2019s the one who stands next to me, really close. Shows me where we are in the book. The letters are a blur, and they look blue, but all I have to do is mumble anyway. When we get to the end of the page, he turns it for me. Maybe he\u2019s not gay. Maybe he\u2019s just nice. Or maybe he\u2019s gay and nice.\n\nMy phone rings. It\u2019s Yogev. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d I ask him.\n\n\u201cNo clue,\u201d he answers, but he sounds chill, like it\u2019s all good.\n\n\u201cTurn it off,\u201d Earring Dude whispers. \u201cThis is God\u2019s house. It\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nI hang up, but Yogev calls back a second later. I don\u2019t pick up, so he texts, but it\u2019s just random letters that don\u2019t form any words. I hope he\u2019s O.K. I want to help him, but I feel bad about Earring Dude. And about God. They\u2019re up to Shema Yisrael, and I remember that one, so I shout it out because I want everyone to know I know all the lyrics.\n\nWhen the prayers are over, all nine of the men shake my hand and say I did a mitzvah. The fact that I hung up the phone when Earring Dude asked me to is what won them over. The bald guy asks if I need a ride somewhere. He has a moped. I try calling Yogev, but it goes to voice mail. \u201cTake me to the beach,\u201d I say, and the bald guy nods and hands me a helmet. He drives really fast. Or maybe that\u2019s just how it feels because I\u2019m high. I hold on to him and try not to tip over. When he drops me off at the promenade, I say thanks and walk away, but he calls after me, pointing at my head. He wants his helmet back.\n\nEven though it\u2019s dark, there are still people on the beach. Two women are walking toward me. One of them\u2019s tall. Pretty. If I were Yogev, I\u2019d probably say something to her. She and her friend walk past me, and I just keep standing there. But then the pretty one turns back. \u201cAre you O.K.?\u201d she asks. \u201cYou\u2019re shaking.\u201d It\u2019s the pretty one who says that, not her pimply friend. It\u2019s the pretty one who\u2019s worried about me. She takes an interest. She cares about me. It must be a reward from God.\n\nI want to tell her something. Something good. But I can\u2019t think of anything. I try to remember what Yogev told that Norwegian girl, and I stretch out a smile and say, \u201cIf God comes down from a cloud right now and grants me a wish, I\u2019ll ask for ten minutes to go down on you.\u201d I know there\u2019s another part, but I can\u2019t remember it.\n\nThe ugly one says, \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d The pretty one makes a hurt expression and they both turn and walk away. Maybe it wasn\u2019t a reward from God after all. Or maybe it was, but it didn\u2019t work because I couldn\u2019t remember the ending of the spiel. Only that it was funny. Something to do with peace in the Middle East.\n\nI walk around looking for Yogev. Maybe he\u2019s back at his brother\u2019s place with a girl, and the lizard is in the living room watching the fashion network and dubbing some Chinese model with high cheekbones while Yogev blows his wad. No way. He has to be here somewhere. I just need to keep looking. All of a sudden, I fall on the sand. Or did someone knock me down? A guy is hovering above me like Superman. He\u2019s kind of tall. He says something that sounds like a curse, and then he kicks me or throws something heavy at me. I think it was a kick. My head is spinning from being high. Or from being kicked. The pretty girl\u2019s there, too, and so is her friend. The pretty one grabs Superman and pulls him off me. Maybe it was God after all. Maybe it\u2019s my reward for not taking Yogev\u2019s call in the synagogue. That stoner could be anywhere by now. But he\u2019s probably farther down the beach, sitting next to a tourist, asking what her horoscope sign is in his crappy English. Superman gets away from the pretty girl, runs back, and gives me another kick in the ribs. \u201cDoron, stop!\u201d the pretty one screams. \u201cEnough!\u201d She has a gentle voice, even when she\u2019s shouting. A pretty girl\u2019s voice. He keeps kicking me.\n\nI wake up on the beach. I can only open one eye. There\u2019s sand stuck to my face. Stuck to the blood on my face. Superman is gone. But the pretty girl\u2019s still here, handing me a can of Coke. She says they didn\u2019t have any water at the kiosk. I try to drink, but I can\u2019t swallow. A guy in a baseball hat comes over. The pretty girl tells him something about what I said or about that guy, Doron, who beat me up. The baseball cap looks at me and says, \u201cHe should lie down,\u201d and the pretty girl tries to smile, but the smile is lopsided. She says something I can\u2019t understand, and then the word \u201cambulance,\u201d and although her mouth is completely crooked now and she\u2019s almost crying, she\u2019s still pretty. I\u2019ve never been with a pretty girl. I don\u2019t even mean sex\u2014just sitting on the same towel at the beach, talking. It was really nice of her to buy me a Coke. \u2666\n\n"
