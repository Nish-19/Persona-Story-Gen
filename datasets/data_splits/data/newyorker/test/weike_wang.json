        "story": "To please his mother, a writer attempts a children\u2019s story. The mother doesn\u2019t usually read fiction but will read a children\u2019s story and, if it\u2019s good, show it to all her friends. In his mother\u2019s eyes, the writer is, by and large, an anomaly. She believes that writing is a skill, not a vocation, and to make up stories for anyone other than children is a silly way to occupy one\u2019s time.\n\nSo here is his attempt at a story that maybe his mother will read and show her friends.\n\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a clown. The clown lived in a village that had no other clowns, for each village was allotted only one. The job of the clown was to scare some children but amuse others. He had balloons and face paint and could juggle. Half the time, he appeared without warning, and the other half he provided notice of the when, where, and what. Children had a fifty-fifty chance of receiving each option: the clown could either burst out from under their bed to juggle hatchets (no notice) or appear at their birthday party to juggle balls (notice given). If a child was amused once, there was no guarantee that this would happen again. Still, the chance of that child\u2019s being scared was no higher than it would have been, because, in this fair and made-up world, the clown existed to teach a lesson: that events of fear and events of joy are independent, and independent events must have independent probabilities.\n\nThe writer thinks this last sentence will please his mother. In her home country, she\u2019d taught math and begun work on a textbook, but then came instability, uprisings, and she and his father had had to leave. For a long time and openly, she\u2019d hoped that her son would carry on her work. \u201cMy son, the writer of textbooks\u201d is how she would have introduced him\u2014instead of simply \u201cmy son.\u201d\n\nThe mother now lives in a facility, and he visits her there. He gives her a printout of the children\u2019s story, and she reads it. From bed, she says, \u201cYou must have footnotes with proper notation. How else is a child supposed to understand that for independent events the probability of A equals the probability of A given B, and the probability of B equals the probability of B given A? It\u2019s not clear. But what\u2019s clear is that you\u2019re writing about me,\u201d she says, tapping her finger on the page at the word \u201cclown.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re clearly writing about your father and me, and none of my friends will want to read that.\u201d\n\nThe writer\u2019s father is no longer with them and was neither a funny man nor a person who had opinions about clowns. He and the writer\u2019s mother had been married for forty-seven years, most of which were arduous and sombre. In the new country, they\u2019d had to work menial jobs. It did not help that the father had a horrendous temper, made worse by his belief that everyone around him was belittling him, and by the fact that everyone was. So he raged and lashed out at home and left all the bathroom cleaning to his wife.\n\n\u201cAlso, I want a happy ending,\u201d the mother says, folding up the story and setting it on her nightstand. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to write happy.\u201d\n\nHe asks how she could know that if she has never read anything of his.\n\n\u201cI hear things from my friends,\u201d she says. \u201cThey all say you\u2019re too serious and no one knows what you mean.\u201d\n\nBecause she raised and didn\u2019t abandon him, because of her troubles and the unfinished textbook, the writer returns to his story to see what he can do.\n\nOne day, the children gathered in the village square to take a vote. Future clown encounters, they argued, had to either all be happy or all be scary. One of these options had to win, and they would not accept an in-between. They needed to have certainty. They voted unanimously for happiness, of course, and then, in parallel lines, wearing hats and safety equipment, the children marched to the hut at the edge of the village where the clown lived. They barred the door and windows from the outside. They lit a torch and told the clown inside that if he didn\u2019t change his metrics, they would burn down the hut. The clown refused: the rules of his tenure were fixed, and if he gave in to the children\u2019s request the village would oust him and replace him with another clown. The children encircled the hut and held hands. They chanted gibberish and made menacing expressions that were subpar. Then they threw the torch onto the hut\u2019s straw roof. \u201cFear and joy!\u201d the clown lectured, until he suffocated and could no longer be heard. The children cheered as the flaming hut caved in and crushed him; then, in parallel lines, they marched back to the village square, where the adults were waiting.\n\nHaving learned what the children had done, the adults were grim. With the clown gone, they now had to scare or amuse the children themselves. Up to this point, the adults had had a contract of emotional neutrality. They dealt with the feeding, sheltering, and not abandoning, while the clown dealt with the rest. News travelled to other villages of what the children had done, and the children of other villages followed suit, which meant that clowns were soon in short supply and the over-all profession lost its prestige. As the adults of these murderous, arsonist children were forced to take on new roles, they found the rule of independent probabilities failing them. Some could bring only fear, and the probability of future fear was dependent on the probability of past fear, as well as on the parent\u2019s over-all chance of penitence. Others could only bring joy, and, likewise, that probability was dependent on other factors, such as the children\u2019s response to repeated joy, to guaranteed joy, and to the adults\u2019 ability to sustain joy through their socioeconomic status.\n\nThe clowns never returned, and the adults became parents, and their children became adults who begot more children, whom they had to parent. Thus was born, in these villages, the idea of conditional probabilities and, with it, the practice of conditional love.\n\nAfter the mother reads the story, she is silent for long enough that the son thinks she has died, in bed, with her eyes open. He waves a frantic hand in her face until she blinks.\n\n\u201cYou must be making fun of me,\u201d she says.\n\nThe writer says he would never dare.\n\n\u201cYou are,\u201d she says, with patience and firmness.\n\nThe writer truly would never dare.\n\nThe mother looks at her son in disbelief that she has brought such a person into the world. A person incapable of writing a children\u2019s story or a happy ending. Is this a result of too much imagination or too little? Is this revenge? \u2666\n\n"
