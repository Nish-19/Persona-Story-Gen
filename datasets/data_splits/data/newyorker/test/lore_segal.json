        "story": "Ladies\u2019 Lunch over and talk for the moment exhausted, we continued to sit around the table by the window that overlooked the Hudson River, to sip our wine, pour ourselves another glass. It was here that Bridget asked what everybody thought about this idea of \u201cfinding oneself.\u201d \u201cIs there a character in Homer, in Shakespeare, in the Bible who thinks to ask, \u2018Who am I?\u2019 \u201d And the conversation was off again.\n\n\u201cBesides Lear,\u201d Farah said, \u201cwho asks \u2018Who is it that can tell me who I am?\u2019 And don\u2019t you love the question \u2018Who does he think he is\u2019 or \u2018Who do you think you are\u2019 followed by a rhetorical exclamation point?\u201d\n\nLucinella\u2019s chair faced east. She had been watching people on the neighboring rooftop, and she said, \u201cThey\u2019re having a party, and they didn\u2019t invite me!\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know those people?\u201d Ruth asked her.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lucinella said.\n\nIlka said that her search began with her grandmother Ilonka, the one she was named for. \u201cShe died before I was born, but I\u2019ve seen an old sepia photograph\u2014two photographs, actually, taken by someone standing outside the open door to her bedroom. Great Aunt Mali used to let me play with\u2014what did they call it?\u2014the stereopticon, on Sunday afternoons when my mother\u2019s cousins used to get together in Mali\u2019s apartment just outside Vienna. I don\u2019t think I remember my father being there. Tante Mali was immensely fat and old, with a sweet, lovely face. She and little Onkel Maxl ended up in Mauthausen. The magic of the stereopticon made the flower in a water glass on the bedside table, made the glass, three-dimensional and more real than the sepia grandmother sitting up in her crocheted bed jacket.\u201d\n\nLotte frowned irritably when she said, \u201cI will never understand why something made to look three-dimensional or virtual excites us more than the real thing in front of our noses. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cMimesis,\u201d Farah said. \u201cIs it Aristotle or is it me who said that we like a likeness, in which, I guess, we search for ourselves?\u201d\n\nIlka was following her own thought: \u201cThe room is lit from the left, so there must be a window in the corner that one can\u2019t see around. Secrets of the sepia bedroom: someone picked that flower and put water into the water glass; someone had set the glass on the bedside table. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean!\u201d Lotte said. \u201cWhat does it tell us about who we are that we are tenderly intrigued by an imaginary person walking through an old photograph but couldn\u2019t care less about our neighbor passing our window at this very moment?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mother found Ilonka\u2019s old ice skates,\u201d continued Ilka. \u201cThe grandmother in the bed jacket ice-skating blew my mind. I mean, when were skates even invented?\u201d\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\nRuth consulted her smartphone. She said, \u201cIn 3000 B.C.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d Lucinella said. \u201cLook! The people on the roof! They\u2019re bringing out the cake. It\u2019s a birthday party.\u201d\n\n\u201cBirthdays,\u201d Bessie said. \u201cPeople talk of the pathos of having missed their own, or their kid\u2019s birthday, or graduation. Tell me one thing that ever signified at a birthday party, a graduation, at Thanksgiving, a Seder, a wedding even\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA funeral,\u201d Farah said.\n\nRuth said, \u201cNext Ladies\u2019 Lunch will be at my place. The agenda: Tell some one thing that has thrown light on Who You Are.\u201d\n\nThe next time the friends met, around Ruth\u2019s table, Ilka read them what she had written about the morning she woke in her first English foster home, in 1938: \u201cThere, on a chest of drawers, was the suitcase my mother had packed for me. I lay in the strange bed and wondered what I was supposed to do. Presently I got up, I dressed slowly, and opened the door to the hallway. Where were all the people? The previous night there had been an old woman and her daughter who had fetched me from the station and brought me to this house where all the lights were on in all the rooms and a lot of smiling people stood around looking at me. A maidservant in a long white apron had taken me upstairs to the bathroom and run a bath. I understood that she meant me to get in, but I was ashamed and wouldn\u2019t undress, and in the morning I could not remember having been brought up to this bedroom. I stepped out into the hallway and listened to the silence. A door stood ajar. I looked inside and saw a dressing table. A mirror, with photographs stuck into the frame, reflected a brush, a comb, and a pincushion in the shape of a heart. I gave the door what I told myself might have been an accidental push. It revealed the corner of somebody\u2019s bed covered with a shiny green counterpane. I knew that I must not walk into other people\u2019s bedrooms\u2014should not be looking in. Was I allowed\u2014was I meant\u2014to use these stairs? I crept down to the next floor where there were a number of doors, but all of them were shut.\u201d\n\n\u201cBedrooms,\u201d Bessie said. \u201cIt was Robbe-Grillet, if you please, who showed us that we were part of the room\u2019s geography before we were able to give an account of the color of the wall or form a relationship with this or that piece of furniture. Try it! Imagine yourself into bed in your first bedroom; notice that you know the direction your feet are pointing, and you remember the location of the door in relation to the window.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you define yourself as the who who inhabited that first bedroom?\u201d Ruth asked her.\n\n\u201cWhy do I have to define myself?\u201d Bessie asked.\n\nIlka said, \u201cWell, I am the refugee who tells the old story.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I,\u201d Lucinella said, \u201cam the uninvited.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Lotte said. \u201cYou are here at the Ladies\u2019 Lunch. But why am I the person at the party who argues with everything anybody says?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I,\u201d Farah said, \u201cam the one who brings up the things nobody is interested in thinking about.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d Ruth said to Bridget, \u201cit\u2019s you who got us asking ourselves who we are. What do you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat there isn\u2019t any Who,\u201d Bridget said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a silly question.\u201d\n\n"

        "story": "\u201cMy birthday party was in March,\u201d Ilka told Bridget. The two old friends were walking on Riverside Drive at the turn of the season when you learn all over again that forty-nine degrees requires more than a jacket. \u201cAnd I got what seemed an inspired present, a little . . . a . . . a . . . a what do you call the animal with the exoskeleton?\u201d Ilka frowned, impatient and irritated at what was not, at that moment, available to her. \u201cI always mean to figure how, routinely and with minimal fuss, to apologize for another word I can\u2019t find in my head, cannot form in my mouth. Bridget, what\u2019s the obvious\u2014what is the first animal you think of that carries its roof so conveniently attached on its own back?\u201d\n\n\u201cA tortoise,\u201d said Bridget.\n\n\u201cA little tortoise,\u201d Ilka said. \u201cEine kleine Schildkr\u00f6te. I called it my Kr\u00f6terl. That was the week of the Hitler takeover.\u201d\n\nBridget had stopped and turned to her friend, who was saying, \u201cNo way am I going to remember which of the six or seven little girls brought what turned out to be an embarrassment. That thing sat and didn\u2019t do anything. Just sat there. We shoved it, we pushed, we poked, we nudged. It withdrew its head under its roof and would not and would not move. My mother to the rescue. Mutti took all the children into the bathroom. You have to understand that this is a bathroom in Vienna and it\u2019s the thirties. Mutti had to go find the matches and light the wall-mounted gas heater and warm two inches of water to cover the bottom of the tub, and she put in the Kr\u00f6terl, which began immediately to march, and it marched round and round the bathtub at the speed of an Olympic footrace.\n\n\u201cThe next day, the three Brown Shirts walked in and gave us twenty-four hours to be out of our apartment.\u201d If Ilka frowned, it was to find herself, still and again rehearsing her ur-story.\n\n\nWhen the ready tears that strangled Bridget\u2019s throat allowed her to speak, she asked, \u201cWhere could you go?\u201d\n\nIlka said, \u201cThey took me to Edith\u2019s, a school friend. Mutti and Vati found beds with . . . people.\u201d\n\nBridget was a writer with an indigestible Irish past of her own. Now she kept walking, alert to a fertile convergence in her understanding of the raw chill of a March day and the meaning of the word \u201capartment\u201d: of having no choice but to leave a place where one was apart; of being without, that is outside walls of one\u2019s own, and without a roof. Not to have a roof.\n\n\u201cAnd the tortoise?\u201d Bridget asked Ilka. \u201cDid you take it with you?\u201d\n\nIlka thought, and she said, \u201cI look back and I don\u2019t see. . . . The Kr\u00f6terl didn\u2019t come to Edith\u2019s with me.\u201d\n\nBridget said, \u201cBut you remember walking out the door of your apartment? Did your mother take it? Did your father take the Kr\u00f6terl?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I remember,\u201d Ilka said, \u201cis the bathroom in our old apartment, mornings, my father sharpening his straight razor on the leather strop attached . . . was it to the doorknob? Sounds like Bluebeard\u2014my poor Vati! And my recurring mishaps because I did not like to go into the bathroom after dark. My father\u2019s terry-cloth robe, which hung on top of my mother\u2019s robe behind the bathroom door, would put a ghostly sleeve on my shoulder.\u201d\n\nBridget tended to invoke Henry James. She was trying to remember\u2014what was it that James had said about a chatty old lady across the dinner table at one of those Victorian country weekends? The story of a dowager\u2019s unwillingness to vacate the family home, the germ, if the old gossip would stop with the unusable detail\u2014\u201cthe fatal futility of Fact,\u201d James called it\u2014that could be shaped into his next novel.\n\n\u201cBefore Hitler,\u201d Ilka was saying, \u201cwe used to summer in the mountains. I keep wanting to turn and ask my mother about the consignment of Enzian that followed us home\u2014the blue, upturned bell of the gentian that grows as if without a stem from the ground. Who sent such a mass of these bluest blue flowers that the only place large enough was the bathtub?\u201d\n\n\u201cDead or alive,\u201d worried Bridget. \u201cThe tortoise dead or alive must have gone somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen my kids were little,\u201d Ilka said, \u201cI got them a stuffed toy, a soft sculpture, a green Kr\u00f6terl. The -erl ending is the Viennese diminutive; in German it would have been a Kr\u00f6tchen. It must still be somewhere around the apartment. It was a hand puppet. You could put your hand inside and make it draw its head back under its stuffed cotton roof.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour e-mail,\u201d Bridget said, \u201cwhere I write you, is MyKroeterl38@usa.com.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my address,\u201d said Ilka. \u2666\n\n"

        "story": "\u201cIforget,\u201d Ilka says to the friends around the table. \u201cDo we allow ourselves to tell our dreams?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a good one?\u201d Bessie asks her.\n\nBooks & Fiction\nEarly access to new short stories, plus essays, criticism, and coverage of the literary world.

In this dream, there is some fatal thing I need urgently to say to my cousin Frieda, but she is on the far side of an abyss, and then she is on the other side of a wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the urgent thing you need to say to her?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dream doesn\u2019t specify.\u201d\n\nThe friends, who have been meeting for lunch for some thirty years, live in a fifteen-block area on the Upper West Side. They talk the politics you expect on the Upper West Side of New York, except when Ilka is talking to them about her cousin Frieda Fishgoppel, professor of philosophy, now emerita.\n\nIlka says, \u201cThe dream is something to do with our most recent reconciliation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy reconcile when you know that you will keep quarrelling?\u201d Farah asks.\n\n\u201cOur project,\u201d Ilka says, \u201cis to be reconciled to quarrelling.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why do you keep the argument going?\u201d asks Ruth, the bona-fide retired activist. \u201cYou disagree with everything she stands for and disbelieve what she believes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd believe,\u201d Ilka says, \u201cin her inalienable right to believe what I disagree with. It\u2019s in the nature, on my part certainly, of a demonstration, proof that we live in a democracy where people\u2014and people we love\u2014may have different, have wrong, opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she is game to let you keep disagreeing?\u201d asks Bridget.\n\n\u201cNnnnno,\u201d Ilka says rather slowly. \u201cBut I like, I love, the intelligible, passionate language in which she disagrees. Frieda is in love with her truths in a way I do not love mine. And you all know that she was my ticket to America\u2014my old ur-story.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell it again,\u201d the friends say, and settle themselves on their chairs.\n\n\u201cAfter the end of the war,\u201d Ilka says, \u201cFrieda searched for the western, Viennese branch of our family. The generation of the grandparents who weren\u2019t dead of old age had been killed in the camps, but there were cousins who had emigrated to Uruguay, to Paraguay, to the Dominican Republic, to Argentina. An uncle went to Canada. Frieda sent the visa for me to come to New York. She settled me in her funny little apartment in Washington Heights\u2014in the fifties, there were so many of us we called it Washingstein Heights. She handed me an Oxford English Dictionary and hurried back to New Haven for her exams. She would come in to see if I was O.K., bring me \u2018David Copperfield\u2019 or a Jane Austen. I had arrived speaking minimal English, but all the refugees were soon reading novels in English, though maybe not the Henry James that Frieda brought me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was her field?\u201d Ruth asks.\n\n\u201cFrieda\u2019s first Ph.D. was in literature, and her dissertation was about antisemitism in her favorite writings from\u2014I don\u2019t exactly remember\u2014was it \u2018Beowulf\u2019 to Eliot?\n\n\u201cFrieda and I still e-mail. If we don\u2019t hear from each other, we worry. \u2018The earth is flat and has four sharp corners,\u2019 she writes me. \u2018It\u2019s easy to drop off the edge.\u2019 She has not replied to my last, and so I promptly assume that she has fallen! She is in emergency! Or, this time, did I go too far?\u201d\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\n\u201cBut what about?\u2019\u2019 Bridget asks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to remember\u2014what were we saying on the bus in Jerusalem?\u201d Ilka muses. \u201cFrieda and I were travelling with a group of Americans\u2014that was in the eighties. We were sitting, talking, and she remembers that I got up and walked away and that I got off the bus. I remember that we did not talk for the last leg of the trip. We didn\u2019t get together back in New York until Lotte invited both of us to dinner. She left us in a room together with the door shut, and Frieda and I started to laugh. You and I, we said to each other, we don\u2019t have to go on doing this. You know what I will say, and I know what you are going to answer. But to this day we are still arguing the same opposing politics without having made a dent in each other\u2019s opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer wrong opinion, which leads her to vote on the wrong side,\u201d Ruth says.\n\n\u201cWhich she believes to be the right side as fully as she believes that yours and mine is wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you know the disastrous consequences of hers,\u201d Ruth says.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I walked off the bus, I suppose,\u201d says Ilka.\n\n\u201cBut you go on talking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe go on talking.\u201d\n\nBridget says, \u201cYou keep not telling us what you argue about.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I am more interested in the fact, the nature, of disagreement,\u201d Ilka says. \u201cAlso, it keeps the conversation from going to Israel, though Frieda says, correctly I think, that \u2018to not go there\u2019 is to silence speech.\u201d\n\nRuth asks, \u201cSo exactly what is the dispute?\u201d\n\nIlka says, \u201cOne way of putting it is that I choose to think of myself as a humanist, a child of Adam, where Frieda thinks of herself as a child of God-chosen Abraham. The DNA, as she says, will be the same.\n\n\u201cI search for what Isaac, the progenitor of Israel, has in common with his brother Ishmael, progenitor of Canaan: They both laugh if you tickle them and bleed when you prick them, which drives poor Frieda frantic. She says Shakespeare probably never met a Jew in his life. She challenges\u2014no, she demolishes\u2014my dearest belief, that it\u2019s the imagination which could save the world, that if we imagined our neighbor\u2019s griefs we would not do to him what we don\u2019t want him to do to us. Frieda says that, having imagined what it\u2019s like to be the abused Jew, Shakespeare confiscates half his fortune, hounds him ignominiously off the stage, and makes him convert.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to open a bottle of wine,\u201d Farah says. \u201cIlka, go on.\u201d\n\nIlka says, \u201cFrieda argues that the basis for our innate difference is my inclination for seeing sameness where hers is for seeing distinctions. Where I search for harmony in equality, she sees how one thing\u2014one people, history, ethos\u2014is distinct from another. Frieda says that for me distinctions spell the disruption of harmony; that, for her, harmony is a lie where distinction is present.\n\n\u201c \u2018Harmony?\u2019 I holler. \u2018What, me? Aren\u2019t I your favorite contrarian, your in-house skeptic who tests your every certainty by opposing my uncertainties? Do, please, notice,\u2019 I tell her, \u2018that I end with my universal question mark.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut then she asked if I and you\u2014my \u2018Lunch Ladies\u2019\u2014still vote on the left, and I said, \u2018You bet,\u2019 and we were back on the bus, you see. I e-mailed her: \u2018I\u2019m discouraged.\u2019 She answered, \u2018For the record (if there is a record) I feel terrible, not simply discouraged but terrible.\u2019\n\n\u201cI wrote her, \u2018I don\u2019t know if it will ease your distress, but I reconfirm my love and friendship if you will accept them with the acceptance also of our irreconcilable differences, which are totally unchanged after half a century\u2019s disputation.\n\n\u201cShe answered, \u2018Noted. Confirmed and renewed.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIlka says, \u201cAnd then I dreamed that there was something essential that has to be prevented.\u201d \u2666\n\n"
