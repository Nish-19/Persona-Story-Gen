        "writing_prompt": "In a desolate alley, a hitman waits for instructions from his elusive boss, only to encounter a mysterious woman whose presence feels like both a warning and a trap. What happens when the line between predator and prey begins to blur?",
        "story": "The gunman lights a cigarette, watches despondently as dusk falls upon the empty alley. He is alone in a lonely place, summoned here to receive instructions from a master criminal known only as the Boss, but the Boss isn\u2019t here. No one is. It\u2019s spooky. He feels like a marked man. The Boss is known for his ruthlessness. When he orders a killing, someone dies. The gunman would like there to be witnesses for what happens next, but the alley\u2019s deserted.\n\nHe glances at his watch, a gift from the Boss. Face a gold coin, no numbers. A joke, probably: time is money. Or, maybe, money is time; it depends on what you\u2019re short of. The Boss is a great joker. The watch hands are hair-thin, like the edge of a razor blade, hard to see, especially in this fading light. There and not there, like time itself. Which is perhaps not being clocked\u2014perhaps that\u2019s what the numberless face is saying. How can you measure the shit you\u2019re buried in? He doesn\u2019t know what keeps the watch running. Battery inside, maybe. When the battery dies? Don\u2019t think about it.\n\nOn one assignment or another, the gunman has wasted a few suckers in alleys like this, but not many. His specialty is knocking them off in train stations and hotel lobbies or on the street in broad daylight. There\u2019s a greater risk of getting nabbed, so always an extra thrill. Which is why he took up doing the Boss\u2019s dirty work. Thrills remind him that he\u2019s alive, when not much else does.\n\nOverhead, a street lamp comes on, its yellow light a mere stain under the dimming sky. Then a woman passes. It\u2019s about time, the gunman thinks. Has she been sent by the Boss? Is she his witness? His victim? His executioner? His hand is inside his jacket, resting on the butt of the revolver holstered under his armpit. Probably just an innocent working girl, looking for a pickup, wandering into a place where she doesn\u2019t belong. Which wouldn\u2019t stop the Boss from targeting her. Or using her.\n\nYou looking for someone, sister? he asks, lurking in the shadows, his cigarette bobbing as he speaks.\n\nI don\u2019t know, she says. She casts an inquisitive gaze at him, then quickly looks away. A signal? He should perhaps throw himself behind the trash cans, but her tender scrutiny has fixed him where he stands.\n\nShe walks slowly away into the shadows at the far end of the alley, then swivels and walks back again toward the light. She appears frightened, lost. Touchingly vulnerable. Above her, the street lamp sways rhythmically, causing shadows to stretch and recede, stretch and recede, like a slowly beating heart. She pauses under it and looks around, clearly thinking about something. She\u2019s no beauty, but she has sweet ways. His hard heart softens. He takes his hand off the revolver.\n\nRachel Maddow talks with David Remnick\n\n\nWhen she turns to walk down the alley again, the gunman flicks his cigarette away and walks with her, moving as she moves. Left, right, left . . . it\u2019s a kind of dance. She asks if he\u2019s making fun of her. He says he doesn\u2019t know how to make fun. In truth, he feels caught up in something fundamental. Benumbing. A feeling he hasn\u2019t had before. Abstract, yet oddly erotic.\n\nIt won\u2019t do any good, she says, reading him.\n\nYeah, I know, lady. But I like it.\n\nThey reach the dark end of the alley, still moving together, and turn back toward the swaying street lamp. The alley seems almost to fade away, the lamp\u2019s glow to brighten. There are bats twittering somewhere. Time itself seems to stop, even though he knows it\u2019s still grinding inexorably toward something messy. The Boss has plans that haven\u2019t happened yet. Never mind. Worry about them when they do.\n\nWhen their dance ends, night has fully descended, sharpening the contrast between the pool of lamplight they have stepped into and the rest of the world, lost in the darkness beyond. That was great, he says. She looks up at him, her face pale but radiant in the light. She nods. Her sad smile seems to say, Yes, but it\u2019s not enough, is it? She stares down at her feet, and when she does so, her face is masked in shadow. Is she about to betray him? he wonders. Does he care?\n\nShe starts suddenly, glances back down the alley. He follows her gaze. Uh-oh. Something is moving. His hand, too slowly, is inside his jacket. Watch out! she cries, and throws herself in front of him. A shot rings out. She collapses into his arms. Holding her, he fires impotently into the darkness. His bullets ricochet through the alley like ironic laughter. Hang on, baby! he pleads, but it\u2019s too late.\n\nIt must be . . . why . . . she whispers, and dies in his arms.\n\nHis heart hardens again. Rage bites at the corners of his eyes. He doesn\u2019t understand a fucking thing.\n\n"

        "writing_prompt": "A seaside puppet show featuring the infamous Citizen Punch takes a darkly comedic turn as the rowdy crowd cheers on his chaotic antics\u2014but what happens when the line between performance and reality begins to blur?",
        "story": "Citizen Punch, sitting under his humped back and sugarloaf hat on the lip of the little stage, his floppy legs dangling, is performing for the rowdy seaside audience below him. \u201cLife is shit,\u201d he says with his peculiar wheezle.\n\n\u201cYay!\u201d they yell.\n\n\u201cPeople are better off dead!\u201d\n\n\u201cYay!\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me your money!\u201d he says. They do.\n\nHe loves his audience. They love him. But he hates them, too. They\u2019re people, and people are mostly disgusting. Sometimes he wants to hit them so hard that he can watch their heads spin. Pow! Bash! Whirr! So hard that they never recover. Ka-BLAM! No loss. They\u2019re stupid arse-kissers at best. But they do adore his arse, which he bares from time to time, taking pleasure in their adoration. \u201cIt\u2019s your best feature,\u201d the foxy Professor tells him, helping him display it. Looks like a knuckled fist, and is sometimes used as one. BOP! Sur-PRISE! He adores it, too. It\u2019s when the dummies are puckered up at his knuckled backside that he feels closest to them. Gives them his happy face to show his appreciation, make them feel good.\n\nNot everybody loves him back. There are always a few rotten barrels in every apple, as the Professor says. No problem. His people take care of them. \u201cThat\u2019s the way to do it!\u201d Punch tells them. \u201cTotal losers! Throw \u2019em the hell outa here!\u201d His people hate do-gooders as much as he does. \u201cWe all know life\u2019s just a joke,\u201d he squawks, \u201cbut those patsies think it has meaning! They\u2019ll never get the gag, not even when they\u2019re hit by the punch line. Lay it on! Bigly!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s that, Mr. Punch?\u201d It\u2019s the Bottler. The Bottler is his fixer. Every honest man needs one. He beats on his big tin drum and tootles his pipes and works the yokels, squeezing them for cash. A genius. \u201cAre you telling jokes again?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Bottler, I\u2019m talking about the tragedy of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa ha, that\u2019s a good one! You always break me up, Mr. Punch!\u201d\n\n\u201cBelieve me! Life\u2019s the worst deal ever, Bottler! It\u2019s an outrage! Shouldn\u2019t be allowed! But, when you get snookered and there\u2019s nobody to sue, all you can do is jump into the muck and swing your slapstick, bust a few heads, have as much fun as you can before the show closes! No one wins, but, like the Professor says, bullies last longest!\u201d\n\n\u201cA beautiful credo, Mr. Punch! You are, as everybody says, a philosopher, a visionary, and a true disbeliever!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am also a fighter, as you know. The world has done us no favors. It\u2019s been against us from the start. We gotta get tough, take it apart, eat it up!\u201d\n\n\u201cTruer words were never uttered, Mr. Punch. Listen to all your fans! They\u2019re applauding you!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. They love my eloquence, my smarts. And they\u2019re so generous! The suckers have nothing, and it\u2019s like they can\u2019t give me enough. Now, go take up a collection!\u201d\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\nJudy drops by with Baby. She can be a very nasty woman, Judy. From time to time, he has to belt her one. Give her credit, she always belts him back, the ugly beak-nosed bitch. They say he has a dick for a nose, but so does Judy. Gender equality! As for Baby, Punch doesn\u2019t know how he begat the little shit machine, but Judy assures him that he did. She asks him now to mind the brat while she gets her snarly hair tarted up. That\u2019s an invitation to toss squalling Baby out the window. \u201cYI-I-i-i-iii!\u201d He has the kid on a string, hauls her back up, throws her out the window again. Listen to her scream! He loves it! The crowd loves it!\n\nJudy doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s gone to yell at the authorities about him, and now the scowling Doctor is standing where she was. The Doctor tells Punch that he belongs in the madhouse. He is mentally unbalanced. To prove it, the Doctor wraps his flabby arms around a slapstick as big as he is and\u2014pow!\u2014knocks Punch head over heels into the wings. Punch springs back, snatches the slapstick, and\u2014\u201cUnbalanced, my ass, baldy!\u201d he yelps\u2014smacks the Doctor with it. The Doctor\u2019s an old guy; it\u2019s easy. Laughing, Punch whacks him again. And again. Once more. He\u2019s dead.\n\nA brass-buttoned, red-nosed Constable turns up while he\u2019s still pummeling the dead Doctor and tells Punch that he\u2019s under arrest. \u201cYou\u2019re breaking the law,\u201d he says. What a laugh!\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what else gets broken,\u201d Punch cackles gleefully and lays into the Bobby with his stick. Ka-whack! WHAM! The Bobby\u2019s helmet head cracks open, but he picks himself up and hits Punch with a subpoena. Punch hits him with a subpoena. Biff! Boff! He\u2019s got the Bobby on the ropes! The crowd\u2019s loving it! They shout out encouragement, and Punch pauses to take a bow. The broken-headed Bobby, on his dangling feet, swings his massive cudgel with both arms. The crowd tries to warn Punch, but too late\u2014thwock! Punch is down. The Constable safety-pins Punch\u2019s floppy hands to his pants and hauls him off to stand trial.\n\nThe Judge in his white wig calls for testimony from the victims. Pretty Polly says that Punch raped her. Joey the Clown says the same, and so does Crocodile.\n\n\u201cGuilty!\u201d the Judge announces gravely, bringing his gavel down. \u201cCitizen Punch must hang for his diabolical crimes!\u201d\n\nThe crowd cheers at that. What? Then, when Punch asks the court for mercy, the Judge responds by rapping Punch\u2019s head with his gavel\u2014knock! knock! The crowd on the beach whoops it up. The traitors! After all he\u2019s done for them! It\u2019s not fair!\n\nAnd now here comes the hooded Hangman to carry out the Judge\u2019s sentence! Not a nice fellow. The crowd agrees. No one loves a hangman. The Hangman throws the noose over Punch\u2019s head, but he ducks away. \u201cIt\u2019s too small!\u201d Punch cries out in his kazoo-like voice, as the noose bounces off him.\n\n\n\u201cIt fits all customers,\u201d the Hangman insists.\n\n\u201cNo, look, it\u2019s too small even for you!\u201d Punch squawks.\n\nThe Hangman shows Punch that he\u2019s wrong by dropping the noose over his own head, and Punch kicks him off the stage, hanging the Hangman! Punch has the howling crowd once more in the palm of his hand. But that hand is pinned to his britches.\n\nThe Judge himself comes to complete the grim ceremony. Judy\u2019s there as a witness, along with Joey the Clown, loose-jointed old Jim Crow, Toby the Dog, loudmouth Mr. Scaramouche, and the Bobby, looking smug under his yawning helmet.\n\nWhile the Judge is looping the noose over Punch\u2019s head, his white wig falls off: It\u2019s the Devil himself! Grinning like a no-see-no-hear monkey! The Devil is greeted by the fickle crowd below with friendly boos and laughter. He smiles his wicked smile and says, \u201cHello, Mr. Punch. And goodbye, Mr. Punch.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, Your Honor! I don\u2019t care if you hang me\u2014life\u2019s nothing more than a dirty joke, good riddance\u2014but I have to pray to my Maker, and I can\u2019t do that with my hands pinned to my arse.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince when have you become religious, Mr. Punch?\u201d\n\n\u201cSince the day I first saw you, Your Honor, a model for all honest thieves. The Almighty props me up, fingers me where it feels good, I\u2019d be limp as a rag without him, but you\u2019re the one who fondles my black heart!\u201d\n\nThe Devil, flattered, relents. \u201cNo tricks now, Mr. Punch!\u201d\n\nPunch, freed, grabs up a slapstick and wallops him with it. The Devil laughs off the blow and fights back with fire and brimstone. Punch turns his stick into a cricket bat and swats the stinking brimstone back at the Devil. The Devil\u2019s judicial robes catch fire, and he shrinks away inside them, shrieking obscenities.\n\nPunch surveys the bleating lowlifes ringed around him on the beach, cheering, laughing, waiting for the next act, but their whoops sound fake, their howls of laughter hollow. Some are even turning away, as if to say they\u2019ve seen it all before. Sad. Punch is disillusioned. He works his ass off, beating up on everybody, sending them all to Hell or worse, and no one shows him the least appreciation. What\u2019s it all for?\n\nThe Professor doesn\u2019t know but tells him that he can\u2019t quit. \u201cLife\u2019s a scam,\u201d he says, \u201cbut there\u2019s nothing to do, except make shit up and carry on. See how rich you can get, who you can fuck over. Nothing else matters.\u201d\n\nPunch can feel the Professor getting into his head, tickling the doubts away. Grinning again his hawkish grin, he picks up his slapstick.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way to do it!\u201d the Bottler says, working the crowds at his feet. \u201cUh-oh! Look out, Mr. Punch! Ha ha! Here comes Judy!\u201d\n\n"
