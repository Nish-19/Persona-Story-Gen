        "story": "When she checked her boarding pass, she was in the middle of the row, and there was a man in a blue suit on the aisle, who gave her a big bleached-white smile as he stood to let her past. The window seat stayed unoccupied for a while, and her hopes rose when a man with a clipboard boarded the plane, his hair gauzy with dew. But there were still people in the aisle, and one of them now stopped beside her row: a huge boy, who was trying to make space for a rucksack in the overhead bin. His belly was right there\u2014she could see it as his green shirt parted company with the belt of his jeans. The rucksack did not fit, so he clasped it to his chest as he turned sideways to squeeze past her and into the window seat. He was wearing a Peruvian hat in brown-and-white wool with a design of llamas and a flap over each ear, and there were tassels dangling from the flaps down to his collar line. A teen-ager. Ninety per cent muscle, thirty per cent puppy fat; he might have another few inches still to go. Once he was seated\u2014she did not know how he did it, but the bag was wedged between his legs and eased under the seat in front, and somehow this huge child made himself small for her. Tucked away. Almost decorous. The guy on the aisle had a newspaper, a big broadsheet, which he opened with a shake, but the child by the window gave her room. He did not smell, not even his hat. His eyes, when she checked, were shy and brown.\n\nThe bones of her back were pulled into the upholstery as the plane tilted and split from the runway, so she was travelling chest first, heart first, her pelvis cupped in the angle of the seat, and it was difficult\u2014with gravity pulling her backward like this\u2014to think of anything but getting up there. After a while, there was a bing-bong over the loudspeakers, but nothing changed and no one moved. The plane cut through a skein of dark-gray cloud, through a layer of liquid light, into another cloud that started as dark as steel wool, then thickened to gray and turned slowly white. In a moment, they would be free of it.\n\nPippa loved the moment of breaking out into the upper air, so blue and bright. She thought it would happen any second now, but the engines shifted and the plane started to bank and turn, and then turn again. They were still flying through whiteness, so there was no horizon to judge their angle by, but the three of them in the row were definitely canted over, once and then again. The man in the shiny suit dropped toward her shoulder, and the boy was pushed against the fuselage wall. His eyes\u2014all their eyes\u2014were drawn toward the window as the plane kept turning, not banking now so much as falling. The plane dropped and dropped. They fell from thick white through fog that was loose with unshed rain, until they were back out where they had started: the huge under-cloud dusk of earthbound weather. And now it was hard to tell if the plane was still turning, or if it was just falling. Another shift brought them to a steeper angle and to the idea that the nose was down: the plane might start to spiral through the air.\n\nNo one wanted to look at anyone else, because, if their eyes met, that would mean they were about to be killed. They could see the countryside below: a small city to one side, mountains directly beneath. The ground was approaching, though not very fast. It did not look dangerous, or even real, but she realized that it had been going on for a long time: this question of flying or falling. There was a sharp pain in her stomach, but her mind was completely clear. Her mind told her that she might die within the next sixty seconds or so. She had a leisurely amount of time to laugh at her fear and then to be afraid again, to consider last thoughts and blink them away: her husband and her three children asleep in their beds.\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\nIt was a strangely buoyant sensation, this falling. The human beings in the plane were dropping at the same speed as the metal around them, so they were no longer forced against the fuselage. She understood the immense weight of the falling plane and the lightness of their bodies inside it.\n\nThey had hit a thermal, perhaps\u2014or the opposite of a thermal\u2014a gap in the mountain air. She looked for a lake below them, or some other feature that might make a chimney of cold they would tumble down, but there was nothing in the landscape that she could read in that way.\n\nThe boy in the window seat turned up to look at her, one hand lightly braced along the wall of the plane, the other holding on to the arm rest. And when she looked down at him\u2014because he was almost directly below her now\u2014she saw something she had not seen since her babies each opened their eyes for the first time. A full human being. Utterly himself. A new person in her life. And what use was that to her now?\n\nHe was seventeen, maybe eighteen. She was forty-three years old. In the lozenge of light that fell from the other side of the plane (which was now the top side), she saw that his eyes were not brown but amber. Sallow skin, black hair\u2014his eyes were beautiful, but it was hard to tell if he was beautiful. Boys were a bit of a mystery to her. Despite the attention-seeking hat, he was not the object of anyone\u2019s attention. He was\u2014and, of course, this was what the hat was all about!\u2014in disguise.\n\nThe boy was lurking inside this ridiculous hat, ironic and hidden. And, yes, he was terrified, but he was also shaking the woollen tassels, saying, \u201cReally? Now?\u201d And this helped her, quite a lot. She thought she might hold his hand. Or touch his hand, which was clenched around the tip of the arm rest; it looked white, as though fear had made him cold. She thought she could warm it out of him a little. The skin of his hand was right there.\n\nBut, sometime before the mountain tops\u2014long before\u2014at three thousand feet or five thousand feet, they came out of it, whatever it was. The plane levelled: their bodies grew heavy again as it started to climb. They turned in silence to the seats in front of them. Pippa resisted an urge to touch the gray plastic of the tray table. The boy pulled earbuds up from his green shirt pocket and she closed her eyes.\n\n"

        "writing_prompt": "Years after a high school love triangle caused a rift between them, Jen and Lucy unexpectedly reunite in a yoga class. As they navigate the awkwardness of their shared past, unspoken truths and lingering emotions begin to surface.",
        "story": "Everyone said that Jen had run off with Lucy\u2019s boyfriend, though she had not run off with Lucy\u2019s boyfriend: he had run off with her. Also, it happened a good three months after he and Lucy had broken up.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that,\u201d Sharon said. \u201cHe was Lucy\u2019s.\u201d\n\nHe really wasn\u2019t, but Jen found she could not say as much, because Lucy had locked herself in a toilet cubicle and people said that she was throwing up in there, she was so upset. Lucy was in love, and Jen was maybe not in love. So he was Lucy\u2019s because Lucy said he was, and everyone agreed with that. Everyone except the guy, who was called John Dolan.\n\nJohn Dolan said that Jen was the one he\u2019d wanted all along.\n\nHe had broken up with Lucy at Christmas; they all knew that. It was supposed to be a time of joy and good will, not of ghosting and dumping, so the holiday had been ruined for everyone, especially for Lucy\u2019s mother. And it was March when he got with Jen, a full\u2014count them\u2014thirteen weeks later. And, by the way, she wanted to remind people, he made the first move. A move that felt so right, it did not occur to Jen that he had once wrapped his arms around Lucy the way he was now wrapping his arms around her, saying, \u201cSo, hey?\u201d\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d she said back.\n\nLater, she did mention her friend. She said it after they\u2019d finished their first, long kiss, which took place outside, against the trunk of a huge, budding tree. She nestled into his shoulder and looked back at the house, where everyone partied on, oblivious. And, with a sudden, unforeseen pang, she said, \u201cWhat about Lucy?\u201d\n\nHe was so surprised, he started.\n\nHe might have said, \u201cWho?\u201d\n\nLater, when it was all a big drama, he folded Lucy back into the story, as if she had some role in their getting together.\n\n\u201cIt was you all along,\u201d he said.\n\nThey were in his mother\u2019s car, up in the hills, where the darkness was huge. Saturday night was happening elsewhere, and it felt as if they were hiding from everyone they knew.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\nJen thought this was a bit of a lie. She thought it would be more truthful to say that he\u2019d never wanted Lucy in any serious way. Or that he used to like Lucy and then he didn\u2019t like her\u2014these things happen. What did \u201call along\u201d mean, anyway? John Dolan was talking the way Lucy talked, as though people belonged to other people. You could be involved in other people\u2019s wanting, whether you knew it or not.\n\nHe leaned in and whispered into her hair.\n\n\u201cIt was you I liked.\u201d\n\nShe could hear the melancholy in the lie, as she looked at the city lights spread below. All his sadness opened out for her.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\nJen felt a tiny, lifting sensation in her chest. She would sleep with John Dolan. She had been reluctant but now she would give in, not because her body wanted it (so much!) but because of this new, sweet untruth. He had loved her all along.\n\nThis was when they were in the last year of school and everyone was panicking about final exams. Lucy was so upset about John Dolan that she tanked biology, so it was actually really serious, because first Jen stole Lucy\u2019s boyfriend and then she stole her future as a veterinarian. Jen had ruined Lucy\u2019s life.\n\nSo that all happened in 2004 and now it was 2024. No one knew where John Dolan was and no one cared. There were hundreds of John Dolans on LinkedIn; it was hard to know if he was even online. Lucy popped up, whether you wanted to see her or not. Many snaps of her three children, who, Jen thought, always looked perfect and never looked happy. Also pictures of her lovely house with its coffered wooden ceiling and its color scheme in a pale yellow that Lucy called \u201cprimrose\u201d and Jen called \u201comelette.\u201d\n\nJen was online a lot in 2024 because she was in a nervous breakdown, or a time of transition, or whatever you wanted to call it. Her marriage was over. She had one fabulous spark of a child, who, according to his school, had behavioral difficulties, a raging, grieving boy who hated his mum and missed his dad. Her job was unsatisfying but well paid, and she despised\u2014that is not too strong a word\u2014everyone in the yoga class where she went to calm down, especially the wisp of a woman who leaned both hands on her knees in Baddha Konasana and said that tightness in the hips was sometimes trauma-related. It just wasn\u2019t, Jen wanted to say, and all the scented candles in the world could not tell her otherwise.\n\nShe was crying in Savasana one day, or releasing water down the sides of her perfectly still face, when she saw Lucy pick her way through the mats, on an early exit from the room. It was just a glimpse as Lucy passed above her, looking about ten feet tall, her thigh long and planar like a sculpture of a leg, her hair in a swishing ponytail, and her face oddly blotched, which, Jen decided later, might have been a problem with her filler.\n\nShe scrolled all evening, eating pizza from a grease-stained box. Everything in Lucy\u2019s life was sunny and right. A man, presumably her husband, cooked on a barbecue. A daughter in a tulle skirt twirled on a green lawn. No sign of a job or a profession (but why post about that?).\n\nA few weeks later, Jen glimpsed Lucy through her own legs, in a downward-facing dog, and was relieved when Lucy did not recognize her dangling there. Lucy floated into Chaturanga in a way that was beautiful and unreal. Later, she lifted a leg and swung it to the side without a wobble. This was before her three-minute headstand, during which she looked a little worried and her face flushed red. Her filler was definitely a bit lumpy, upside down.\n\nJen felt stuck to the mat as she waited for Lucy to leave at the end of class, but she seemed in no hurry this week, and they were both still for a very long time. And, because she had nothing else to do, Jen began to survey her body, the way she had been instructed: fingers, wrist, forearm, shoulder, up over her scalp, all the way down to her toes, which she relaxed one by one. Before. During. After. All along. She found it was women she was counting. The other women in her ex-husband\u2019s life twitched into her mind, toe by toe. The silly one, the one who did not matter, the one who would not leave him alone. She thought of his voice as he lied to her, how she wanted to fill that hollow melancholy with her love as, for some reason, her heart now rose to do, filling the silent room, its many supine women and two stunned men, the wisp at the front with her prayer bell, the light-filled window, the street beyond.\n\nShe let her hand loll sideways onto the wooden floor, which was slick with the condensed sweat of all their bodies but also nicely cool.\n\nHe really was Lucy\u2019s boyfriend. That had been a wrong thing to do.\n\n\u201cOh, my God!\u201d Lucy was standing right over her, whisper-squealing, her hand doing a tiny, private flutter of hello. \u201cHow are you? Sh-h-h. How are you? It\u2019s me. It\u2019s Lucy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, my God! How are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so good,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cDon\u2019t you love this class? It is so nice to see you. Oh, my God!\u201d \u2666\n\n"
