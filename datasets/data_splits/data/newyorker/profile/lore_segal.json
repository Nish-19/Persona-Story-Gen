        "story": "On one of the first days of the New Year, Jack called Hope. \u201cLet\u2019s have lunch,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got an agenda.\u201d No need to specify the Caf\u00e9 Provence on upper Broadway, or the time\u2014fifteen minutes before noon, when they were sure of getting their table by the window.\n\nThey did the menu, heard the specials. Hope said, \u201cI\u2019m always going to order something different,\u201d but ordered the onion soup. Jack ordered the cassoulet, saying, \u201cI should have the fish.\n\n\u201cAnd a bottle of your Merlot,\u201d he told the unsmiling proprietress, \u201cwhich we will have right away.\u201d\n\nBooks & Fiction\nEarly access to new short stories, plus essays, criticism, and coverage of the literary world. Paid subscribers get author interviews and poems.\n\nSign up\nBy signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll share a salad,\u201d Hope said. She saw Jack watch the proprietress walk off in the direction of the bar, in a remarkably short skirt for a woman of fifty. Hope saw the long, brown, athletic legs, bare even in January, with Jack\u2019s eyes. Jack, a large man, with a heavy, dark face, turned to Hope. \u201cSo?\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K., I guess. You?\u201d\n\nJack said, \u201cMy agenda: if we were still making resolutions, what would yours be?\u201d\n\nHope\u2019s interest pricked right up. \u201cI\u2019m thinking. You go first.\u201d\n\nJack said, \u201cI\u2019m going to watch what I eat. It\u2019s not the weight; it\u2019s the constantly thinking of eating. I don\u2019t eat real meals unless Jeremy comes over.\u201d Jeremy was Jack\u2019s son.\n\nHope said, \u201cI\u2019m going to watch what I watch and then I\u2019m going to turn the TV off. It\u2019s ugly waking mornings with the thing flickering. It feels debauched.\u201d\n\nJack said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to order books from Amazon till I\u2019ve read the ones on my shelves.\u201d\n\nHope said, \u201cI\u2019m going to hang up my clothes even when nobody is coming over. Nora is very severe with me.\u201d Nora was Hope\u2019s daughter.\n\nThe wine arrived. Jack did the label-checking, cork-sniffing, tasting, and nodding. The salad came. Hope served their two plates. Jack indicated Hope\u2019s hair, which she had done in an upsweep. \u201cVery fetching,\u201d he commented.\n\nZooey Zephyr\u2019s Defense of Trans Lives in a Deep-Red State in \"Seat 31\"\n\n\n\u201cThank you. Here\u2019s an old new resolution: Going to learn French. What was the name of my teacher when we got back from Paris? I once counted eleven years of school French, but it was you who always had to do the talking.\u201d\n\nJack said, \u201cI want to learn how to pray.\u201d\n\nHope looked across the table to see if he was being cute. Jack was concentrating on folding a whole lettuce leaf into his mouth.\n\nHope said, \u201cI\u2019ll never understand the principle of not cutting it into bite size.\u201d\n\nThe onion soup came, the cassoulet came. Jack asked Hope if she would like to go back.\n\n\u201cGo back? Back to Paris!\u201d Jack and Hope had lived together before marrying two other people. Jack subsequently divorced his wife, who had subsequently died. Hope was widowed.\n\n\u201cTo Paris. To Aix,\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cSomething I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you,\u201d Hope said. \u201cWere you and I ever together in an old, old garden? Did we walk under century-old trees? Did we lie down in the grass and look into tree crowns in France, or was that in England? Was it an old English garden or is this a garden in a book?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s to keep us?\u201d Jack said.\n\nThere were a lot of reasons, of course, to keep them from going back. Two of the littlest were at this moment flattening their noses against the outside of the restaurant window. Ten-year-old Benjamin stuck his thumbs in his ears and wiggled his fingers at his grandfather. Hope made as if to catch her granddaughter\u2019s hand through the glass. This made little Miranda laugh. And there was Hope\u2019s daughter, Nora, with baby Julie in a stroller, and Jack\u2019s son, Jeremy, standing out on the sidewalk.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to the bathroom,\u201d Hope mouthed to her daughter.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Nora mouthed back, her face sharpened with irritation. The baby was crying.\n\n\u201cShe knows I can\u2019t hear her through the glass,\u201d Nora said to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy said, \u201cYou stay with the kids. I\u2019ll go in and get him. I\u2019ll see what your mother wants.\u201d Jeremy walked into the restaurant, passing Jack and Hope on his way to the corner where, an hour ago, he had folded up his father\u2019s wheelchair. Hope stood and came around the table to kiss Jack and be kissed goodbye.\n\n\u201cOn the double, Dad,\u201d Jeremy said. \u201cI need to get back to the office.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call you,\u201d Jack said to Hope. \u201cWe\u2019ll have lunch.\u201d\n\nHope was mouthing through the window again and Nora said, \u201cJulie, shut up, please! Mom, what?\u201d The baby had started screeching.\n\nHope pointed in the direction of the ladies\u2019 room. Nora signalled, You need me to go with you? Hope shook her head no. One of the reasons for the Caf\u00e9 Provence was that its bathrooms were on the street floor, not in the basement, down a long stair.\n\nGathering her coat and bag, Hope opened the door to the ladies\u2019 room and saw, in the mirror above the basins, that her hair was coming out of its pins. She removed all the pins and stood gazing at the crone with the gray, shoulder-length hair girlishly loosened. Hope saw what Diane Arbus might have seen and was appalled, and being appalled pricked her interest right up. \u201cI\u2019ve got an agenda: the Arbus factor of old age,\u201d Hope looked forward to saying to Jack the next time it would be convenient for Jeremy and Nora to arrange lunch for them at the Caf\u00e9 Provence. \u2666\n\n"

        "writing_prompt": "After being moved to an assisted-living home against her will, Lotte insists she has \"died\" and begins recounting her life as if it\u2019s already over. Her friends, scattered and aging themselves, must decide how far they\u2019ll go to bring her back to the world of the living\u2014or if she\u2019s already gone.",
        "story": "It mattered that Lotte\u2019s apartment was commodious. Lotte liked to boast that when she lay in bed and looked past the two closest water towers, past the architectural follies and oddities few people notice on Manhattan\u2019s rooftops, she saw all the way to the Empire State Building. On the velvet sofa in Lotte\u2019s living room, from which she could observe the Hudson River traffic as far as the George Washington Bridge, the caregiver sat watching television.\n\n\u201cGet rid of her,\u201d Lotte said.\n\nSamson dropped his voice, as if this might make his mother lower hers. \u201cAs soon as we find you a replacement.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll get rid of her,\u201d Lotte said.\n\nSam said, \u201cWe\u2019ll go on interviewing till we find you the right one.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho will let me eat my bread and butter?\u201d\n\n\u201cMom,\u201d Sam said, \u201cbread turns into sugar, as you know very well.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t care,\u201d Lotte said.\n\n\u201cIf she lets you eat bread for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, she\u2019ll get fired.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Lotte.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u201cSarah,\u201d Sam said to the caregiver, \u201cI\u2019ll take my mother to her ladies\u2019 lunch if you\u2019ll pick her up at three-thirty?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat O.K. with you?\u201d Sarah asked Lotte.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Lotte.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u201cLadies\u2019 lunch\u201d is pronounced in quotation marks. The five women have grown old coming together, every other month or so for the last thirty or more years, around one another\u2019s table. Ruth, Bridget, Farah, Lotte, and Bessie are longtime New Yorkers; their origins in California, County Mayo, Tehran, Vienna, and the Bronx might have grounded them but do not in these days often surface.\n\nRuth was a retired lawyer. She said, \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten, of course, who it was said that there are four or five people in the world to whom we tell things, and that\u2019s us. Something happens and I think, I\u2019ll tell the next ladies\u2019 lunch.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue! It\u2019s true,\u201d Lotte said. \u201cWhen I suddenly sat on my rear on the sidewalk outside my front door, I was looking forward to telling you.\u201d\n\nLotte had turned out to need a hip replacement. Dr. Goodman, the surgeon, was a furry man like a character in an Ed Koren cartoon, only jollier. He had promised Lotte, \u201cFrom here on it\u2019s all good.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m eighty-two years old,\u201d Lotte had said.\n\nGoodman told her, \u201cI\u2019m on my way to the ninety-second birthday of a patient whose knees I replaced eleven years ago.\u201d\n\nBessie said, \u201cAnd I told you, from my poor Colin\u2019s experience, that the recovery is not so much like Goodman\u2019s cheery projection.\u201d These days, it depended on the state of Colin\u2019s health and Colin\u2019s mood whether Bessie was able to take the train in from Old Rockingham.\n\n\u2022\n\nToday\u2019s lunch was at Bridget\u2019s, so she got to set the agenda: \u201c \u2018How to Prevent the Inevitable.\u2019 I mean any of the scenarios we would rather die than live in.\u201d Bridget was a writer who still spent mornings at her computer.\n\nRunning the New York City Marathon at Age Eighty-Six\n\n\nFarah, a recently retired doctor, said, \u201cThe old problem of shuffling off this mortal coil.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf shuffling off,\u201d Lotte said.\n\n\u201cAnd it was you who said you wanted to see it all, to see what would happen to the end,\u201d Farah reminded Lotte.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t counting on the twenty-four-hour caregiver or the heart-healthy diet,\u201d said Lotte. \u201cYou doctors need to do a study of the correlation between salt-free food and depression.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Sarah seems pleasant enough,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat she\u2019s in my living room,\u201d Lotte said, \u201cwatching television; that she\u2019s in my kitchen eating her lunch, which she does standing up; that she\u2019s in my spare room asleep, and in my bathroom whenever I want to go in.\u201d\n\nRuth asked Lotte what Sarah did for her. \u201cDo you need a caregiver to help you dress?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lotte said.\n\n\u201cYou need a caregiver to help you shower?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lotte said.\n\n\u201cGet your meals?\u201d\n\n\u201cGod, _no! _\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what do you need help with?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe caregiver,\u201d Lotte said.\n\n\u201cGo away,\u201d she said to Sarah, who had come to take her home. The four friends\u2019 mouths dropped to see their friend raise her arm at the caregiver and slap the air.\n\n\u2022\n\nThey were of an age when they worried if one of them did not answer her telephone.\n\nBessie, Lotte\u2019s oldest friend, had known Sam since he was a baby. She called him from Connecticut. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the caregiver pick up Lotte\u2019s phone?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s gone. There was just too much abuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me! What? That nice Sarah? You\u2019re talking elder abuse?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore like caregiver abuse,\u201d Sam said.\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike Mom would change the channel Sarah was watching on the TV. She\u2019d come into the kitchen and pack away the food Sarah was preparing for her lunch, and turn on the light when Sarah was asleep. It was getting bizarre. I\u2019m here waiting with her for the new woman.\u201d\n\n\u2022\n\nBessie e-mailed the friends in New York to look in on Lotte.\n\nBridget went to see Lotte. Bridget, Lotte, and Shareen, the new caregiver, sat looking out on Riverside Drive. Lotte said, \u201cShareen drives in from New Jersey. Shareen has a five-year-old who brushes his own teeth. Shareen told him that if he doesn\u2019t brush, a roach will grow in his mouth.\u201d\n\nBessie phoned Lotte. \u201cHow is the new caregiver?\u201d\n\n\u201cIntrusive,\u201d said Lotte.\n\nWhen Farah called Lotte, it was Sam who picked up the phone. \u201cShareen is gone. Mom locked her\u2014I can\u2019t make out if it was into or out of the bathroom, but it wasn\u2019t that. Shareen did not want to have to manhandle Mom to stop her eating sugar by the spoonfuls.\u201d\n\n\u201cLotte is angry,\u201d Farah said. \u201cAfter making your own decisions your life long, it must be hell having someone tell you what you can eat and when to shower and what to wear.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause her own decisions are not tenable,\u201d Sam said. \u201cGreg is coming in from Chicago.\u201d Gregor was Lotte\u2019s younger son. \u201cWe\u2019re going to check out this nice assisted-living home. It sounds really nice. Upscale.\u201d\n\n\u201cSam? You\u2019re moving Lotte out of her apartment?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo a nice home in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cA home in the country. You discussed this move with Lotte?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she has agreed?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes, she has. In a way,\u201d Sam said. \u201cShe said next year, maybe. Listen. Mom cannot deal with the round-the-clock caregivers. And believe me that she does not, does not, want to move in with Diana and me.\u201d\n\n\u2022\n\nBridget phoned Sam. \u201cSo, what\u2019s this place you want to move Lotte into?\u201d\n\n\u201cCalled Three Trees. It\u2019s in the Hudson Valley,\u201d Sam told her. \u201cMy brother will help me move Mom in, and move the stuff she\u2019s fond of\u2014the famous velvet sofa.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she will have an apartment of her own?\u201d\n\n\u201cA bedsitter, neat and convenient, with her own bathroom and a breakfast nook.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer own nook,\u201d Bridget said. \u201cWhat\u2019s outside the window?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Hudson River view, unfortunately, is on the other side of the building. Trees. There\u2019s a little parking lot and lots of green. Listen. We know Mom would prefer Manhattan\u2014which would have been a hell of a lot more convenient for Diana and me to visit her\u2014but who can afford something nice in the city?\u201d\n\nBridget said, \u201cIt\u2019s that none of us drives these days. How are we going to visit?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the advantages is that there will always be people around.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes Lotte think this is an advantage?\u201d\n\nSam said, \u201cI have never been in a situation where there hasn\u2019t been somebody to talk with.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have,\u201d said Bridget.\n\n\u201cAnd I would know she\u2019s getting three proper meals.\u201d\n\nGod. Poor Lotte, thought Bridget. And poor Sam. \u201cYou\u2019re not a happy camper,\u201d she said to him, wondering what the phrase came from.\n\n\u2022\n\nRuth, an old activist, had an idea. She said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Sam.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you closed on the Hudson Valley place?\u201d she asked him.\n\n\u201cGreg and I are going up on Thursday.\u201d\n\nRuth said, \u201cWill you give us a couple of days to figure something out?\u201d\n\n\u201cBelieve me, there is nothing to . . . Yes, sure. O.K. But I need to get Mom and her stuff moved before Greg leaves for Chicago.\u201d\n\nRuth said, \u201cCould Lotte live alone if\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\n\u201cSam, wait. Could Lotte live alone if the four of us\u2014the three of us if Bessie can\u2019t come in\u2014take turns checking on Lotte, to see what she needs and if anything is wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cMom would put sugar on her bread and butter.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds delicious,\u201d Ruth said.\n\n\u201cShe would never change her clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably not.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe would have one shower a week. She would not shower.\u201d\n\n\u201cSam! So what!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot on my watch,\u201d Sam said. \u201cThings need to be done right.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, they don\u2019t. Why do they need to be right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Mom messed up her medicines, Greg and I had to rush her to Emergency. She might have died.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. She might. Your mother might have died in her own bed, in sight of the Empire State Building and the George Washington Bridge. No, but Sam, we will go up and check on her. Let\u2019s try it\u2014a couple of days.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if she falls down again?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe falls down. Sam, I\u2019ll sleep over there tonight.\u201d\n\nRuth slept over at Lotte\u2019s, and Lotte fell going from her bed to the bathroom. Ruth called Sam, and Sam and Gregor came and took Lotte to Emergency.\n\n\u2022\n\nSamson and Gregor moved their mother, the sofa, and whatever else out of Lotte\u2019s ample apartment could be made to fit, into the bedsitter in the Hudson Valley. Greg flew back to Chicago.\n\n\u2022\n\nWhen the ladies\u2019 lunch met in Farah\u2019s apartment, the agenda was Lotte\u2019s rescue. Farah had a plan.\n\nThey brought each other up to date.\n\nLotte had phoned Ruth from Three Trees. Ruth said, \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize her voice. I mean, I knew that it was Lotte, but her voice sounded different, strangled, a new, strange voice.\u201d\n\n\u201cLotte is furious,\u201d Bessie said.\n\n\u201cYes, I know that voice,\u201d Bridget said. \u201cLotte called me. She remembered my sitting with her and Shareen. She wanted me to get Shareen\u2019s phone number. Shareen drives a car. Lotte wants Shareen to come and pick her up at Three Trees and drive her home to the apartment. Which is not going to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow when I go abroad I tell everyone Im a Canadian goose.\u201d\n\u201cNow when I go abroad I tell everyone I\u2019m a Canadian goose.\u201d\nCopy link to cartoon\nLink copied\n\nShop\n\u201cLotte called me,\u201d reported Farah. \u201cShe wants us\u2014her and me\u2014to rent a car together. I told her I haven\u2019t renewed my license. I doubt if I could pass the eye test. Not a problem, Lotte said. She would drive.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes she even have a license?\u201d\n\n\u201cLotte hasn\u2019t driven in ten years.\u201d\n\nBessie said, \u201cSam called me and he was fit to be tied. Wanted to know if I had something to do with Lotte buying a car. Buying a car! Me? I have never actually bought a car in my life. Lotte believes that she has bought a car and keeps calling this dealer to send her the keys.\u201d\n\nBessie had called Lotte and asked her, \u201cWhat\u2019s this about a car?\u201d Lotte said, \u201cIt\u2019s down there in the parking lot.\u201d \u201cWhat kind of a car is this?\u201d Bessie had asked her, and Lotte said, \u201cI\u2019m waiting till they send me the virtual key.\u201d\n\n\u2022\n\nFarah\u2019s plan: Farah had an eighteen-year-old grandson, Hami. He would have his license as soon as he passed his test. \u201cHe\u2019ll drive us to Three Trees, and we will bring Lotte back.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBetter be soon,\u201d Bessie said. \u201cSam is putting Lotte\u2019s apartment on the market.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe test is this Monday.\u201d\n\nBut Hami failed his test.\n\n\u2022\n\nBridget phoned Lotte at Three Trees. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot good.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is the food?\u201d\n\n\u201cSalt free.\u201d\n\n\u201cJudging from your voice, you\u2019re getting a little bit used to being there?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you come and get me and take me back to my apartment?\u201d\n\n\u201cLotte, we just really wouldn\u2019t know how. For the moment, might it be a good idea to accommodate yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. But I need to go home,\u201d Lotte said.\n\n\u201cHave you found anyone to talk to?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Alana. She sits next to me in the dining room. Alana has three children and five grandchildren, the oldest nineteen, the twins age thirteen, and a nine- and a five-year-old. Would you like me to tell you what their names are?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you like me to tell you where each of them goes to school?\u201d\n\n\u201cLotte . . . \u201d\n\n\u201cMinnie Mansfield has a grandson. His name is Joel, and Joel has a friend whose name is Sam, like my Sam. Shall I tell you which colleges Sam and which colleges Joel are considering going to?\u201d\n\n\u201cLotte . . . \u201d\n\n\u201cMinnie\u2019s sister\u2019s granddaughter,\u201d said Lotte, \u201cis thinking of taking a gap year before she goes to Williams.\u201d\n\n\u201cLotte . . . \u201d\n\nLotte said, \u201cI have not told Alana or Minnie that I\u2019ve died. I thought awhile before telling Sam, but he was fine. He was really very good about it, my poor Sam.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean that you feel as if . . . \u201d Bridget hesitated between saying \u201cas if you have died\u201d and \u201cas if you are dead.\u201d\n\nLotte said, \u201cNo. I am dead. If I saw Dr. Goodman\u2014or any doctor\u2014he would look down my throat and see the four yellow spots dead people have. When you write the story, the question is whether, now that I am dead, I can die again, a second time, or is this what it is from here on.\u201d\n\n\u201cLotte, you want me to write your story?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already written how I got rid of Sarah and Shareen, and the roach in Shareen\u2019s five-year-old\u2019s mouth, and about Sam and Greg putting me here in the boonies.\u201d\n\n\u201cLotte,\u201d Bridget said, \u201cwe\u2019re mobilizing ourselves. We\u2019re trying to figure out how to come and visit you.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood! Oh, oh, good, good!\u201d Lotte said. She wanted them to give her enough lead time so she could arrange a ladies\u2019 lunch in the Three Trees dining room. \u201cThen I\u2019ll tell you how I lay down on my sofa\u2014this was last Friday\u2014just to take a nap, and when I woke up I knew that I was going to die, and I died.\u201d\n\n\u2022\n\nSam has taken time off twice this month to go and visit his mother. He feels that she is settling in. \u201cWhen she says that she has died she means died to the old New York life in order to pass into the new life at Three Trees.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you think she means?\u201d Bessie asks him.\n\n\u201cWhat else could she mean?\u201d\n\nBessie is silent a moment. She says, \u201cLotte has stopped calling me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sam says. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t call me, and she doesn\u2019t return Diana\u2019s calls.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t pick up her phone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Sam says.\n\n\u2022\n\nBessie is pretty much stuck in Old Rockingham. Colin seems to be on the decline. Poor Bridget didn\u2019t make it to the last ladies\u2019 lunch, because she had one of her frequent debilitating headaches, but she wants to come along if Ruth and Farah figure out how to go and visit Lotte.\n\nThe idea to hitch a ride with Sam when he drives up to Three Trees gets screwed up because Lotte does not return Farah\u2019s call. \u201cAnd then I guess I forgot to call her,\u201d Ruth says. \u201cIn any case, there wouldn\u2019t have really been time to change my doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d\n\n\u2022\n\nHami has got his license and has driven his new secondhand car to his first semester at Purchase.\n\n\u2022\n\nFarah and Bridget still mean to figure out some way to go up and see Lotte, maybe in the spring, when the weather is nicer. \u2666\n\n"

        "writing_prompt": "As a child, you spent a day hiking in the Alps with your father, a memory that has stayed with you for decades. Now, at ninety, you revisit the story you wrote about that day, uncovering the emotions, regrets, and fleeting moments of joy that shaped your life.",
        "story": "That Henry James, when he got old, rewrote his early work was my excuse for revisiting, at ninety, a story I had written in my twenties. I was ten years old when I had to leave Austria, so the day with my father in the Alps must have taken place on our last family holiday, the previous August.\n\nI wished Mutti were coming, but she had woken with one of her migraines. I stood outside the hotel, in the grass, getting my shoes wet with dew, waiting and wanting for nothing. \u201cLight tinkled among the trees,\u201d and the \u201cgrasses gleamed sword-like,\u201d says my story. Curious how our language asks for similes. What is something \u201clike\u201d? The sky was \u201clike liquid light,\u201d I wrote. \u201cLiquid\u201d is close, but it\u2019s not quite the right word. \u201cThe mountain\u2019s back looked like something sculpted; one had the feel of the distant footpath in the fingertips. Between the mountain and myself, the land cupped downward, containing light like a mist.\u201d How was it \u201clike a mist,\u201d the essence of which is to obscure? I remember it as a white, chilly presence. A dog barked and barked and barked and the purity of the air carried the sound to where I stood waiting.\n\nOn the road at the end of the hotel gardens, a group of silent walkers passed at the steady pace of those who have a day\u2019s march ahead of them, young people. I followed them with my eyes. This was the moment that the sun crested the mountain\u2014a sudden unobstructed fire. It outlined the young people\u2019s backs with a faintly furred halo, while here, in the garden, it caught the head of a silver dandelion, fiercely, tenderly transfigured into light. I experienced a bliss of thought, new and inevitable, and I said, \u201cLieber Gott, if I ever ask you for anything, you don\u2019t even have to listen, because nothing is necessary except this.\u201d I knew that was right because of my vast happiness, and then my father called me and we walked out of the garden and started up the road.\n\nMy Vati was a tall man in excellent spirits. In August, the Viennese banks closed. In the mountains, my father wore knickerbockers and an Alpine hat with a feather. In his pocket he had a book in which to look up the names of the wayside flowers, trees, and birds. As we climbed, he pointed through the pines to the village farther and farther away below us. Vati\u2019s plan was to reach the Alm by noon and take our lunch in the Alm hut. Did I know, he asked me, what an Alm was? It was a meadow high in the mountains where the cowherd brought all the cows from the valley to spend the summer eating the healthful upper grass, but I was being the world-famous ice-skating star Lucinda in her velvet dress with a skirt that swirled when I did my world-famous pirouette and I couldn\u2019t listen to what my father was explaining.\n\nOh, but the sky was blue! It is bluest when you lie on your side and look through the grasses that grow by your cheek. I watched a spider climb a stalk that bent under its weight.\n\nI sat up. People were coming along the path, two men\u2014young men walking together, one talking, using his hands. The other, who walked with his eyes to the ground, brought up his head and said something that made the first one shout with laughter. I watched them. They slowed their steps to look back at the people coming behind them. One of the girls called gaily, and the two groups joined. That was what I wanted to do when I got older\u2014walk with friends, talking together and laughing.\n\nI looked after them with a suddenly sharpened interest. \u201cYou know something? Vati? I think those are the people I saw on the road this morning, when I was waiting for you. Vati, do you think they are the same people?\u201d\n\nVati was asleep. It was rare, it was awesome, to see a sleeping grownup. His two shoes pointed skyward. Where his trouser leg folded back it exposed a piece of leg above the sock. I averted my eyes.\n\nWe resumed our ascent and it was hot and grew hotter. The climb became harder and steeper, until I thought I could not lift my foot to take the next step, and the next, and the next for the several hours it took us to reach the top.\n\nDigital Culture Wars with Naomi Klein\n\n\nIt was many years later, lying in the semi-dark and stillness, cleaned up and dry, after birthing my baby, my first\u2014I could see where she lay wrapped, not crying, and everything was well\u2014that I remembered sitting at long last, after climbing beyond my strength, under a tree in the shade, breathing in and out.\n\nYou know you have reached the top of the mountain when you are looking at a new world, the existence of which, a moment ago, you could not have suspected, ranges upon ranges paling into the blue distance, and here a peak rising and a second and a third, the relation in which they stand to one another becoming familiar under the blue sky. On the green expanse the cows graze, or move a step from here to there. When they lower their slow heads to chew the grass, the bells around their necks softly jingle.\n\nMy young folk sat at a long trestle table in the Alm hut. The cowherd, who sat with them, had a pipe between his teeth. The rumble of his voice, interrupted by the young people\u2019s chatter and laughter, made its way to the table where my Vati and I were having our Mittagessen. It was a meal that I still think about and have not been able to reproduce: Kaiserschmarrn (the Emperor\u2019s Pancake) served with blueberries. Alpine blueberries grow low to the ground and are both sweeter and sharper than the fruit you know. And a glass of fresh cow\u2019s milk.\n\nI ate and watched. The girls were pretty and talked; the boys were tall and thin. I could see their knees. I loved how they clapped one another on the back and put pepper in one another\u2019s soup and liked one another. I wanted to talk about them and I asked Vati who they were and where they were going, but he quieted me with a gesture. Vati, a city man, took an interest in the Alpine type and wanted to listen to what the cowherd was saying.\n\nThere was a general movement\u2014the meal was breaking up. The young people gathered themselves. Vati and I followed them out of the cool dark of the hut into the sheer heat of midday. One of the boys, whose yellow hair jutted over his forehead, stood by the door adjusting the straps of his rucksack. Vati also took an interest in young people and questioned the boy about his party and their plans. Leaning against my father\u2019s leg, I listened to the boy\u2019s companionable answers and felt that life could offer no better happiness. Vati was reminded of his own young touring days and launched upon an anecdote. It was hot. I squeezed my eyes against the fierce brightness in which the blond boy\u2019s head expanded and contracted among the little waves of heat. Vati\u2019s voice proceeded upon the air, wanting to convey an idea of the exact conical rock formation that had been attempted. He described the attempt, and the failure that he, Vati, had predicted. I watched the boy\u2019s hands play nervously with the ends of his straps and said, \u201cVati!,\u201d saw the boy\u2019s eyes steal to where his companions waited a little way along the path, and said, \u201cVati, let\u2019s _go! _\u201d Vati was recounting the witty remark made by himself in connection with said attempt and failure, laughing largely, recalling the occasion. The blond boy cackled foolishly. I saw the boy looking foolish and tugged on Vati\u2019s sleeve. \u201c_Let\u2019s go! _\u201d The boy excused himself, had his hand wrung long and heartily, dived for his freedom, and was received with laughter and a round of applause.\n\n\nMy face burned and I did not turn to look after the young people. They were going farther on and Vati and I started on our homeward journey.\n\nThe intensity of the midday light had burned the color out of things and deadened them. I was angry with the boy who had not wanted to hear Vati\u2019s story and had wanted to get away from Vati. I hated the young people who had clapped their hands and had laughed. My father was walking along in a flow of spirits, and I was sorry for him because I had not cared to listen to the things he wanted to tell me. I resented and disliked this bad feeling, which would not let me be comfortable and be Lucinda the world-famous skating star.\n\nAnd I began to grizzle. I was tired, I said. There was a stone in my shoe and I didn\u2019t feel like carrying my cardigan. Vati stopped his yodelling and looked at me. There was no stone. Vati put the cardigan in his backpack. I rubbed my right temple with the back of my right hand and said I wanted to go home. We were going home, Vati said, we were on our way home, but I meant home now. Vati said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be home soon, we\u2019re almost home, in a couple of hours.\u201d He offered to tell me the story of Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, and the fight between the mongoose and the snake, but he had told it to me before. \u201cHow about an ice cream when we get home?\u201d I understood that my father did not know what to do with me when I was like this, and I was afraid. I knew that this was God\u2019s awe-full answer, for hadn\u2019t I told him in the morning, \u201cIf I ever ask you for anything, you don\u2019t have to listen, because nothing is necessary except this.\u201d\n\nThe sun was gone, all light absorbed by the ring of mountains that stood around us, soft and velvet purple, without the play of color or movement save for our panicked descent. My father had hold of my wrist and hurried me along so that the stones rolled underfoot. \u2666\n\n"

As the months pass and excuses pile up, the friends begin to wonder: who is Frank James, and why does he keep disappearing?",
        "story": "The February Ladies\u2019 Lunch met at Ruth\u2019s Riverside Drive apartment, so it was for her to set the agenda: You remember how we said that we\u2019re the five people to whom we tell our stories? Well, I have a story for you.\n\nGreat, said Lotte.\n\nGood, said Farah and Bessie.\n\nA number of stories, Ruth told them. And at the end there is a puzzle.\n\nGood egg, said Bridget.\n\n\u2022\n\nRuth said, There was this party at Sylvia\u2019s that turned out to be a shiva for Sylvia\u2019s aunt.\n\nLotte and I were there, said Bessie.\n\nBooks & Fiction\nEarly access to new short stories, plus essays, criticism, and coverage of the literary world.

I told her, Thanks, very kind, but I\u2019ll find one when I need to sit.\n\nGet you a drink? she said.\n\nI told her, Sylvia! I can manage. The cane is for balance.\n\nAnd I should stop fussing and go away?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to go away, I said. We laughed and Sylvia said she hoped it was O.K. that she had given Frank my number. He was dying to talk to me.\n\nFrank? Which Frank is this?\n\nRuth, you know. Frank James.\n\nFrank James, yes. Oh, I think it\u2019s that I think of him as James Frank.\n\nSylvia said, Frank works in a gallery on Bleecker Street and wants to know about your old buddy, your client\u2014what was Dario d\u2019Alessi? Anyhow he wants to talk to you.\n\nSo why doesn\u2019t he walk over and talk?\n\nSylvia said, He says he\u2019s afraid of you.\n\nI was annoyed. That is such nonsense. What does it even mean? Where is he?\n\nOver there, said Sylvia, walking out the door.\n\n\u2022\n\nIt had irritated her, Ruth told the friends, to find herself waiting for Frank to call. The prospect of telling her old Dario stories, she said, had opened a window onto such a chunk of time. She called Sylvia and asked for James\u2019s number.\n\nJames? Sylvia said. Which James is this?\n\nFrank, I mean, Frank James, who wants to talk to me.\n\n\u2022\n\nRuth had dialled and hung up because she couldn\u2019t think, at that moment, whether it was James or Frank. Frank. She dialled. Frank, this is Ruth. Your asking about Dario d\u2019Alessi has started all these stories in my head.\n\nFrank said, That\u2019s what I hoped. God! That\u2019s what I want. I Googled you. You were Dario d\u2019Alessi\u2019s lawyer.\n\nI was, she had told him. There was paperwork to do with the people he hired to fabricate\u2014fabricate, that was the word\u2014one of his sculptures. I got to go upstate with him into this sort of hangar where men were working on a twenty-foot black curl. I was never happier. I loved listening to the craftsmen talking with each other.\n\nCrossword Puzzles with a Side of Millennial Socialism\n\n\nGod! Frank said. How did you meet him?\n\nRuth said, I was one of the groupies who hung around whenever he came to New York. Years later, I visited him in the Italian Alps, in his place. It was like a Mesa Verde cave dwelling, if you can imagine a Bauhaus cave carved out of the Italian mountainside. Did you know him?\n\nMe. No! No, Frank said. I saw him once coming out of a restaurant on East Seventeenth and I walked behind him for a number of blocks. He went into a grocery and I watched him through the window. He came out, went into a liquor store, and came out with a bottle. Then he got into a bus going west.\n\nRuth told her friends, I had the thrill of thinking: So that\u2019s what Dario did on the way over to my place\u2014like watching a scene happening thirty years ago. But then Frank said: I was just twenty, too young and shy to go up to this man and tell him that I loved his show. So that must have been Dario\u2019s first exhibit, years before the one at the Guggenheim. Before I even knew him. I told Frank that Dario might have been grateful. Dario used to talk about the desolation of that early success and his first New York visit before he knew people.\n\nFrank said the gallery had just acquired a d\u2019Alessi. Called \u201cHatch.\u201d\n\nI remember, I remember! I remember the bunch of us sitting with a bottle of Malbec, trying to come up with a name for a new d\u2019Alessi piece, to replace \u201cUntitled.\u201d It had to be what Clement Greenberg called a word \u201cindependent of meaning,\u201d in the days when our favorite cartoon was of a museumgoer wiping a tender tear in front of a Russian Constructivist painting. You don\u2019t know till you try how hard it is to think of words that signify no object, or feeling, or value. I\u2019d wake up in the night with a sense of triumph: \u201cBout!\u201d\u2014but that means \u201cstrife.\u201d \u201cUpstanding\u201d got shot down because it commented on its opposite\u2014\u201cstanding down.\u201d There are so many stories! I said.\n\nFrank said that I was a resource and asked whether he could take me to lunch, but the day of the lunch he called for a rain check. Major snafu at the gallery. I\u2019ve invited him up for a drink.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe March Ladies\u2019 Lunch met at Bessie\u2019s.\n\nFrank James had not made it to Ruth\u2019s for that drink. Someone from the gallery called. Frank was out of state and would call as soon as he got back.\n\nThe friends said, Tell us the d\u2019Alessi stories you were going to tell Frank James.\n\n\u2022\n\nRuth said, Here\u2019s something I didn\u2019t understand when I was visiting Dario. I called his attention to a man, a farmer, sitting on the pavement in the village square with a little goat on his lap. The man held the animal\u2019s hoof the way you might hold a child\u2019s or a young girl\u2019s hand. Dario said, He\u2019s going to take the goat to be slaughtered, which I always remembered afterward the way you remember something that doesn\u2019t add up.\n\n\u2022\n\nRuth said, Dario took me on a climb. He climbed like a mountaineer\u2014one foot after another at an even pace. I impressed myself by overtaking him. Then I had to sit down and recover my breath while he moved steadily on and up.\n\n\u2022\n\nAnd the terrifying drive up the mountain road to see the oldest houses on the highest range. You have to understand that Dario was the world\u2019s worst driver. On the way back we ran out of petrol. Because you are statistically more likely to come upon a wayside shrine where someone plunged to death than a gas pump, the locals\u2014unlike Dario\u2014drive with a spare can of gas. Dario and I sat with the car door open and we sat and we sat until the milkman\u2019s truck tootled up the road. The milkman siphoned off enough gas to get us back to Altomonte. Dario took out his wallet\u2014I had enough Italian to understand that the milkman said No, no no, no grazie! Signor Dario, no! che mi faccia un autografo. I wondered how many upstate New York milkmen would prefer a de Kooning or a Rothko signature to a couple of twenties.\n\n\u2022\n\nAt Farah\u2019s lunch in April, as Ruth reported that Frank James had cancelled another appointment, the friends began to smile. One of those spring colds that are so famously hard to shake.\n\n\nFarah asked her, Is this getting to you? Are you annoyed with him?\n\nRuth said, I would have said no way, except that I\u2019m telling you about it.\n\n\u2022\n\nBessie\u2019s husband, Colin, was not well, so she did not come to the May lunch at Lotte\u2019s.\n\nFrank had had to go and get a grown son out of some snafu and hadn\u2019t made it to the latest appointment.\n\nHere was the puzzle, and it engaged the five friends\u2019 powers of speculation:\n\nLotte said, First thing, if someone tells you they have a snafu, a cold, a son, is to believe them. Farah said, One can imagine a twenty-year-old too shy to approach a man with a famous name, but what stops the middle-aged New Yorker from crossing the room to speak to a woman . . .\n\nAn old woman, Ruth said.\n\nAt a New York party\u2014\n\nA New York shiva, Ruth said.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe June Ladies\u2019 Lunch met at Bridget\u2019s.\n\nFrank had not made it to Ruth\u2019s place, and Bridget said she had a story: I asked my delightful twenty-year-old niece, Lily, if she remembers refusing to come into the house if my ninety-year-old mother was in. Lily says she remembers that my mother wore the earpiece of her glasses across her ear instead of tucked behind it and she had been spooked. She remembers crying and not wanting to come in.\n\nLily was how old? asked Lotte.\n\nSix years, maybe.\n\nAnd how does that throw light on a grown man not talking to Ruth at a party.\n\nAt a shiva, Ruth said.\n\nBridget said, Just another story that doesn\u2019t add up.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe Ladies\u2019 Lunch met back at Ruth\u2019s early in July, before everybody dispersed for the summer. No, Frank had not come. Frank had called.\n\nThe friends smiled.\n\nFrank said that there was a fire in the apartment next to his apartment.\n\nThe friends laughed.\n\nBridget said, Maybe there was a fire?\n\nIt\u2019s possible, Ruth said.\n\n"
