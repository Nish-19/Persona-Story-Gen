        "writing_prompt": "After the arrival of a mysterious pair of escalators in the middle of her department store, Kitty begins to feel her life shifting in strange and unexpected ways\u2014up or down, she can't quite tell.",
        "story": "Kitty was suspicious of the escalator, or, more properly, the escalators, as there were two of them, one falling and one rising, anchored side by side in the middle of the main shopping floor. She disliked the push of the motor, and, under that, the light clacking sound of something she could not analyze. A chain perhaps, that ran loose, deep in the machine.\n\nThey were new. The space where they appeared had been boxed in for months, floor to ceiling, with cheap wooden panelling, painted blue. First, a hole was knocked in the floor, and then another in the ceiling above, she supposed. They worked at night, but even during the day men came out from behind the panelling, filthy and smiling, and went back in again: ordinary Dublin men who worked whenever, and installed escalators in the middle of the night. She wondered how much they were paid.\n\nKitty tried to take to them, but she couldn't. She was disturbed by the sight of them out among the merchandise. She disliked the way they talked to each other loudly and laughed as if they owned the shop. They interrupted the conversation, somehow. You'd be selling a bed, talking about springs, you'd be with a young couple, pushing into the mattress in a cozy sort of way, and who would stroll past but the lean blond one, maybe, with the dirty-looking tan, adjusting his zip on the way back from the loo.\n\nNot that she minded men. She had two grown sons at home, so she was used to it: the cheerfulness, the indifference, and the mess. Though sometimes she turned around in the kitchen and was shocked by the sheer size of them\u2014all that protein and carbohydrate, the muscle and milk of them, as though she had fed a couple of potted plants, and grown triffids.\n\nThen, one morning, she walked in and the men were gone. The place was perfect; the carpets fresh and new, the hoarding dissolved into thin air, and, in the middle of the floor, a pair of escalators, one going up and the other coming down. The steps tugged lightly at each other as they passed, snagging and loosening all day long. They ticked in the corner of her eye, making her feel balanced, or dizzy, depending on the light. They were so clean. The up escalator always mounting itself, stair over stair; the down escalator falling like syrup, burying itself slowly in the flatness of the floor.\n\nThey were beautiful, and they never stopped, and finally they got on her nerves. Nothing happened in the Bed Department. People bought a bed, or they did not buy a bed. Kitty used to like the open space, the hummocky slabs of mattress, the headboards like tombstones in a giant graveyard. \"Who's been sleeping in my bed?\" But all her satisfaction was gone now. The way people lay down and curled up, in the middle of the crowd. The old couples sitting on either side of the mattress and looking over their shoulders at each other in a way that was almost coy; the giggles and the silences. Most people buying a bed were in love, she used to think, or hopeful at least of finding love. Now they just bounced up and down or put their dirty feet up or looked like they could kill for a decent night's sleep.\n\nShe was at home one evening, washing the dishes, when the phone rang. It was a young man who said he was looking for a Kevin Daly. Kitty was listed as K. Daly in the phone book, and she didn't want to give too much away. She said that there was no Kevin Daly at that number, and the young man asked if she was sure. He said that he was looking for a Kevin Daly he used to know, a man who had gone to school in Malahide. \"I'm sorry,\" Kitty said, but they were talking to each other now. He told her that Kevin Daly was his brother, long out of touch. Then he said that Kevin Daly was actually his father, but that he did not know he was his father, or he did not know that he was his son. He said that he was looking for his father because his mother was sick and that was why she had given him his father's name, finally\u2014Kevin Daly, and the fact that he'd gone to school in Malahide. \"It was a schooltime romance,\" he said. Kitty just said \"Sorry\" a lot, the way you might say \"I see.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" she said.\n\n\"So that's why\u2014you know?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\nHe asked did she have a brother called Kevin Daly, or a cousin, and she just said, \"No, sorry.\" But he was quite insistent, as though she might be harboring the man. \"No really, I'm sorry,\" she said, and put down the phone.\n\nThe next day, Kitty expected someone to float down the escalator into the Bed Department and call her by name. She did not know who it might be. A girl, maybe, with green eyes, or a slender young boy. She imagined a man in a perfect black suit\u2014something extra about him, anyway, like Cary Grant. A young man with curly red hair gazed at her\u2014or through her\u2014all the way from the floor above, and she wondered, bizarrely, if he was the person she was waiting for. Also what he might say to her, if he was.\n\nThen a figure did appear that made her heart turn, and it took a while before Kitty realized that it was her own mother, sailing down from Fabrics and Soft Furnishings like a queen.\n\nCritics at Large Live, featuring Julio Torres\n\n\n\"I didn't recognize you,\" Kitty said.\n\nHer mother was in town looking for a shower curtain and had thought she would pop in to say hello. But after that there was little enough to talk about. Kitty was used to seeing her at home; out in the open, she seemed surprisingly well dressed and mute.\n\n\"Well, you always know where to find me,\" Kitty said to her, with a stranger's smile.\n\nKitty ended up seducing a man from the local Drama Society, a little to his surprise. He had been courting her for months, but in an old-fashioned sort of way. He was sixty-plus, and Kitty was forty-plus; that was the kind of age gap you could expect, with two nearly grown sons. They were both in a production of \"Johnny Belinda,\" a play about a deaf-mute who gets pregnant, though it comes out right in the end. Kitty did the interval coffees and had a walk-on in the final scene; Tom, for that was the man's name, did the set. He was good with his hands, he said, as he bent over a sawhorse in the scene dock, and Kitty flicked a glance at him to see what he meant\u2014but all he meant was that he was good at making things. Nice. In a way. He drove her home after rehearsal most nights, and one evening they stopped out to eat. After which, Kitty asked him in for a drink.\n\nTom. He said all he needed was a couple of hours to fit two dimmers where the old light switch was, but she'd need to redecorate, after. He looked at the photos on her mantelpiece. He was recently bereaved. His daughter had told him to join the Drama Society, so there he was. In a moment, Kitty thought, he would tell her about his teeth, that they were all his own. Faded brown eyes, silver hair, a handsome where-did-it-all-go-wrong face. They were on the sofa, safe enough. Kitty's older son lumbered in from the pub, and stayed to be introduced. Her younger one was upstairs with his own TV. They were nice boys. They did not expect their mother to seduce old geezers in the front room, and neither did the geezer. It was awkward all the way through, and quite satisfying. Kitty did not tell him about her ex-husband, as he did not talk about his dead wife. She did not tell him that her husband had strayed, that she had done everything to keep him, up to and including porn videos in the bedroom, and that, when she finally left, the judge held that desertion against her and awarded him the house. She did not tell him how her husband had moved a woman in, two weeks after walking out of court. She did not tell him how the boys had followed her eventually to her bedsit and looked after her, as only young boys can, how together they had made their way here, to the outer suburbs and a decent life. Nor did she tell him that she was pregnant, when she realized that she was pregnant. She just let him, and the Drama Society, lapse, soon after the curtain had rung down on \"Johnny Belinda,\" and before anyone could be surprised.\n\nAt first, she thought it was the change of life. She stood in the Bed Department and waited for hot flashes. She did not mind growing old as long as it meant growing easy, but it did not seem to be working out that way. There was an agitation, a turbulence in her blood. She rode all the way up to Accounts to query her pay slip, and she landed back down in the Bed Department with a thump. She walked the floor and sat on the beds. She had a terrible need to lie down on one of them. One Monday evening, during stocktaking, she actually did lie down. She simply reclined. She let her back sink into a double-sprung Slumberland, and felt she might never rise again.\n\nIt was not until she bought three pots of apricot jam that the penny dropped. She did not even bother to take a test. She felt that swooping blankness she had felt with each of the boys, so delicious, like diving into a pool and finding you can breathe. The child was no bigger than a pip in the flesh of her stomach. She took it for walks and little outings. She gave it a go on the escalators and on a park swing, scuffing the coarse sand under her feet and feeling a little mad. What would she tell the boys? As for the people in the Bed Department\u2014Jackie, who shared the floor with her, and the customers who came in to look or buy\u2014they all looked empty to her, like husks. As though she were the only real thing left. It was like that film with the pods, and she wanted to run away somewhere, to a deserted lighthouse, or a shack by the beach, and sit in a shaft of light while her baby grew.\n\nTom rang. His voice was a shock.\n\n\"I just thought I'd check up on you.\" He sounded close, he sounded right inside her ear. Kitty had to remind herself that there were miles of cable between them, a maze of electricity and static.\n\n\"I'm fine,\" she said. \"How are things?\"\n\n\"Good. Good.\"\n\nIn the pause, she felt sorry for him. He wasn't used to this kind of thing.\n\n\"And yourself?\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, flying,\" she said. \"Flying form.\" And he took the hint and let it go.\n\nThen, one morning, the down elevator sighed and stopped. People clumped down the steps carefully, almost aslant, squinting at the lines that were strangely solid now, though they still seemed to shift beneath their feet. Kitty was glad she wasn't on the thing when it ground to a halt. It would make you look so foolish. As it happened, the escalators were empty, apart from a young woman on the other side, who seemed to surge suddenly up. Whoosh.\n\nKitty knew it didn't mean anything, but she feared for her baby, which was now just eleven weeks old. She could not bear the lopsided sight of the stalled steps; they were like someone endlessly limping at the other end of the shop floor. She took a very long lunch, and when she came back a man had taken the panel off the bottom of the broken side. She was right about the chain\u2014there it was, looping around the steps that were wedges, actually, when you looked at them side-on. They packed around the central pivot like big slices of metal pie, then separated out on the way up, dangling their triangular bases into space.\n\nThe escalator man glanced at her as she stared into the works, and then went back to his phase tester, tipping the metal gently here and there. He had hair on the backs of his hands, fine and light: one of those furry men with cushioned muscles and uncertain eyes. Kitty stood for a long time, making him uneasy. He glanced over his shoulder again, but he did not really see her\u2014which was fine.\n\nKitty lost the baby at thirteen weeks, or lost something, at any rate. She looked at the blood on the wad of toilet paper and wondered if she was in the change of life, after all. Perhaps she had imagined the baby, perhaps it had never been there in the first place. She called in sick and went to bed and could not cry.\n\nAt the weekend, she drove her younger son to his soccer game in the Fifteen Acres. She had to park a distance away, because he was embarrassed by the car. Also, he did not like having his mother on the sidelines anymore, so Kitty, amused, went for a walk instead. She thought she might look for the deer. And, almost as she thought it, there they were, a herd of does and their fawns, standing or lying, and all of them chewing, watching, as she now watched, a pair of children and their toy plane buzzing at the other end of the glen.\n\nShe felt sure now that it had been a baby\u2014that she had not been fooled. Her stomach was still warm and aching from it. The deer chewed on and did not mind her, while the toy plane buzzed and sputtered and fell to the ground.\n\nThe change of life.\n\nHer life was changing, that was for sure, though she seemed to be standing still. But up or down? she wondered. Up or down? The children threw the plane back into the air, and it circled again on the end of its wire. Kitty walked on. It had been a baby, she knew it. She had been visited. How could it be down, when she felt such joy. \u2666\n\n"

        "story": "It was the year\u2019s turning. These few hours like the blink of a great eye\u2014just enough light to check that the world is still there, before shutting back down.\n\nSometime in the midafternoon, he had an impulse to go home, or go somewhere, and when he lifted his head, of course, it was dark outside. It just felt wrong. Two hours later, he was in the multi-story looking for his car and he couldn\u2019t find the thing. It was like a lost dog. He clicked the key fob over and over, but there were no answering lights flashing orange on Level 2, where he usually parked, or on Level 3. He went up the little stairs to Level 4, then along the tiny path on the side of the ramp to 4A, brushing against the live cars that were stuck on the slope, nose to tail. He glanced into the windows as he went past and there was a gone look to the drivers\u2019 faces; they\u2019d already left for home.\n\nOut there, it was Christmas, but he did not think it was Christmas inside the multi-story, the only place in Dublin that had no fairy lights. He walked the last ramp to Level 5. Above him, the black concrete angles of the car-park roof gave way to the night sky, and the car was right there, out in the weather. He took a moment to glance up and around him at the longest night of the year.\n\nIt felt like the end of things. Made you want your religion back. He looked out over the landscape of west Dublin, the square industrial units set among dark young trees, and he entertained the possibility that it would not work this time. This time, the world would spin deeper into shadow. And, because the exit ramps were still jammed, he stayed a minute to check the solstice on his phone. For some reason, it didn\u2019t always happen on the same day, but in 2016 it came just when you thought it should, on the twenty-first of December. Not at midnight, though\u2014\u201cthe event,\u201d as the Web site called it, would happen at 10:44 a.m. Irish time. Somewhere in that moment, whether he believed it or not, the sun would pause in the sky above him, or seem to pause. It would stop in its descent and start its slow journey back to summer and the middle of the sky.\n\nOr this year, he thought, it might not bother.\n\nThe M50 was at a crawl, and there was the usual nightmare getting off at the Tallaght exit. He could see the red tail-lights running in a sequence toward him until he pushed his own brake pedal down. It would be stop-start all the way to Manor Kilbride.\n\nA full forty minutes later, the dual carriageway turned into the old Blessington Road, and oncoming traffic shot by so close he flinched in the glare of the lights. This was the part of the journey that he loved best: the street lamps gave way to the idea of countryside, and there was a song on the radio as the road opened up ahead. The music made him feel like he could keep driving forever. It was a love song, or a sad song. It reminded him of a time in his life, some town he was in, he could not say where. The loss of that place made him unsure of this one. Or indifferent\u2014as though he could clip an oncoming car and it wouldn\u2019t matter. And he didn\u2019t know what he was thinking, until a truck bellied past, sucking the air from the side of the car.\n\nIt gave him a fright. He checked all the mirrors and shifted in his seat, set his hands more deliberately on the steering wheel. After the turnoff, he followed his own headlights down a country lane, and when he got to the house he sat in the parked car for quite a while.\n\nThe night was very big out here.There were three texts on his phone; ten, fifteen minutes apart.\n\nWhen home?\n\nWill I put yr name in the pot?\n\nFood anyway, half-seven.\n\nWhen he comes in the door, there is the smell of cooking, the sound of pans and of water pouring into the sink. His daughter is failing to set the table and complaining about the Dakota Access Pipeline. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, so unfair,\u201d she says, and her family neither agrees nor disagrees, because that\u2019s just asking for it. Ruth is fifteen. She is arguing with her own shadow, her mother, her teachers, none of whom care about the Dakota Access Pipeline, or not enough for her. \u201cWe live in County Wicklow,\u201d her mother sometimes likes to remind her. But Ruth does not see what location has to do with anything, and he would admire this more, he might even take up the discussion, but she is back on her phone.\n\nHe glances over her shoulder and, for once, she lets him see.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust,\u201d she says. A person called chikkenpenis has sent a funny picture to do with Kanye\u2019s breakdown, a video clip that jerks and repeats, endlessly. It\u2019s hard to know what the joke is. And what kind of person spells \u201cpenis\u201d right and \u201cchicken\u201d with two \u201ck\u201ds?\n\nBridget Everett and Amy Sedaris talk with Inkoo Kang\n\n\n\u201cIs that someone you know?\u201d\n\nRuth just rolls her eyes, types with two thumbs. Cracks up laughing, saying, \u201cOh, my God. Oh, my God!\u201d\n\nHe looks into the kitchen, where his wife is trying to serve up stir-fry out of a too-heavy pan. She is in her track pants. Upstairs all day, at a guess, translating some car manual for solid German euros. Her hair is in a scrunchie, which does not suit her. He tries to remember the song he heard on the radio as he goes over to help, but \u201cGo, go. Out!\u201d she says, and it is gone.\n\nHalfway through dinner, he becomes aware that Ross, his son, is talking to him about something or someone called Stripey. His son says that Stripey knew about death because he always went to Tiger\u2019s grave. After a moment, he realizes that Stripey is a cat and so is Tiger. The ones at the childminder\u2019s, when Ross was little. Cats from many years ago.\n\n\u201cAnimals believe in death,\u201d his son says.\n\n\u201cYou think?\u201d This is a big statement for a ten-year-old. \u201cMaybe he was just waiting for the other cat to come back out of there. I mean, maybe he doesn\u2019t know what the ground is. Maybe he doesn\u2019t believe in the ground.\u201d\n\nThe boy\u2019s face goes still, and he looks at his plate.\n\nRuth goes, \u201cKcchchhhh,\u201d does a Carrie hand out of the grave. And there is an immediate fight. Shouting, pushing.\n\n\u201cHey, hey, that\u2019s enough!\u201d he says.\n\nWhen they are settled, his wife casts a baleful look at him, and he shoots one back. What have I done now?\n\n\u201cI think the cat was sad,\u201d she says to Ross. \u201cI think Stripey missed Tiger, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nShe has put her hand on the loose fist his own hand makes beside his plate. This is one of the things they fight about. Stop undermining your own son. Which irritates the hell out of him. Because the boy has to learn how to roll with the punches. \u201cCould have been hungry,\u201d he says. \u201cYum yum. Dead cat.\u201d\n\nRuth starts to laugh. And Ross obliges him with a crooked smile.\n\nHis wife pushes back from the table, starts collecting the plates, though they are only just finished.\n\n\u201cSorry that was so,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was just a rustle-up.\u201d\n\n\u201cLovely,\u201d he says.\n\nOh, great, he thinks. On the longest night, his wife with that look in her eye that says, Christmas is coming and it is all turning to shite.\n\n\nCorrection. His wife with a look that says, Christmas is coming and it is all your fault.\n\nHe pours a glass of wine and almost spills it on himself falling asleep on the sofa after the news. He was dreaming about weather, or discussing the weather with his dreaming self: all autumn it had been so dry, high pressure, clear skies, the leaves drying to dust on the trees, falling like smoke, they\u2019d hung on so long. It occurs to him that Tiger was Stripey\u2019s mother. The cat\u2019s mother, no less. He says as much to his wife, who is sitting across the room. She looks at him.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says. And he suddenly remembers that his own mother is dead\u2014a fact he manages to forget for days at a time.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d make a better go of the names,\u201d he says.\n\nLater, he mutes the TV to check on a noise, and hears his daughter singing upstairs. She has her headphones on, her voice half in her head, half in the room.\n\n\u201cGoddam truck,\u201d he says. \u201cNearly had the wing mirror. You know the bend.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe careful,\u201d his wife says. \u201cThis time of year, they\u2019re all drinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all wrecked,\u201d he says. \u201cI was half asleep myself. No, not asleep.\u201d She looks slightly shocked. \u201cJust a bit.\u201d\n\nUnmoored. That is the word he is looking for. Recently he feels\u2014he has felt\u2014unmoored.\n\nHe used to have a place in his mind where he could go. Hard to say where it was, but his mother has been dead since April, so maybe this was the place she used to occupy. Because he can\u2019t go there anymore. It was the song reminded him.\n\n\u201cI was listening to the radio,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe radio?\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like an inner monologue or anything; he did not sit around talking to his mother all day. It was more like a silence. He had lost a great and wonderful silence. The traffic came against him, and he felt unprotected, bullied by the lights. Because he had no one on his side anymore. Not even his wife.\n\n\u201cYes, the radio. In the car. You know, I wish, for once, you\u2019d let me say something without repeating it back at me, like some kind of gom.\u201d\n\nShe lets this sink in for a moment and then gets up out of the big armchair and leaves the room. He can hear the sound of her starting to unload the dishwasher in the kitchen.\n\nAnd \u201cMutual!\u201d he wants to shout after her. \u201cFucking mutual!\u201d He wants to tell her how he sat in the car, outside his own house, thinking, Whatever happens when I walk in the door, that\u2019s the thing. When I walk in the door, I will find it. The answer or the question, one or the other. It will be there.\n\nAnd what did he find? These people. This.\n\nEven in her sleep she is affronted, her body straight in the bed beside him, her head twisted to face the wall. The earth spins them toward morning, and he cannot close his eyes for the vertigo; he has to urge it on. He wakes without knowing he has slept, and the house is busy around him\u2014the sound of the front door, finally, and silence. It is after nine o\u2019clock, but when he comes into the kitchen Ross is still at the table, stuck on his phone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Christmas concert,\u201d his son says, as if that explains something.\n\nThe office is closed but he still has a mad number of payments to process before the end of the year, so he takes a coffee back to bed and opens his laptop there.\n\nHe clicks on a spreadsheet, then he starts reading the news instead and wandering about online.\n\nRoss comes in to show him something. He climbs across the duvet, bringing the phone screen so close that his father has to push the thing a distance away. It is a video of two tigers, play-fighting in the Siberian snow.\n\nThey are pretty impressive, the tigers.\n\n\u201cFantastic,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd Ross is so pleased his cheeks glow with it.\n\nIt is 10:38 and, outside, the sun has not cleared the tops of the winter trees.\n\n\u201cLook up \u2018solstice,\u2019 \u201d he says, spelling it out for him and then typing it on his own keyboard, because he is running out of time now. He has six minutes to do this, to tell his child that the world will keep turning. No matter what happens, the sun will always rise in the morning, the planet\u2019s orbit will tilt them toward the light. He finds a video clip of a cartoon earth circling a harmless, small sun, but Ross says he already knows about the solstice. They covered it at school.\n\nIt is 10:42.\n\nThe boy is sitting cross-legged on the bed beside him. Ross shuts his eyes, and \u201cSh-h-h,\u201d he says. \u201cIs it happening?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it now?\u201d\n\nThe seconds pass. The boy squeezes his eyelids tighter.\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nRoss keeps his eyes shut for another moment, then punches the air. He turns to his dad and they look at each other, full of mischief and amazement. Because it happened. Nothing happened, but they know it was there. The tiny stretch of daylight that will become summer.\n\nHis wife is home. She is standing in the doorway watching them. They look up and smile at her.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she says. \u2666\n\n"
