        "story": "Short story about a woman who marries an ice man... I married an ice man. I first met him in a hotel at a ski resort. \"Look, that's an ice man,\" my friend whispered. The iceman was tall, and he seemed to be young, but his fingers were rimed with a white frost that looked as if it would never melt. Something about him pierced me to the heart. I made up some excuse not to go out, and stayed in the hotel. I felt compelled to talk to the ice man no matter what. \"I don't ski,\" he said. \"I just like to sit here and read and look at the snow. You're interested in me, aren't you? You want to know what an ice man is.\" I held back from asking personal questions. Instead, the iceman talked about me. Somehow, he knew all about me. \"How do you know so much about me?\" \"I can't read minds or anything. I just know.\" Eventually we started dating. We always sat on a bench in the park and talked.\" \"Why don't you talk about yourself? How did you come to be an ice man?\" \"I don't know. I don't even know if I had parents.\" I fell seriously in love with this ice man. The ice man loved me just as I was\u00f3in the present. My mother and my older sister were strongly opposed to my marrying the ice man. \"You don't know a thing about his background.\" So we got married. Nobody blessed the wedding, and no friends or relatives were happy for us. We rented a tiny apartment, and the ice man made a living by working at a cold-storage meat facility The two of us lived a happy life together, without bothering or being bothered by anyone. I even started to love having sex with the ice man. We wanted to have a child but that didn't seem to be possible. It may have been that human genes and ice-man genes didn't combine easily. I found myself with time on my hands. I would finish up all the housework, and then having nothing to do. I was still young, and doing the same thing day after day. \"How would it be if the two of us went away on a trip somewhere, just for a change?\" \"Well, if you really want to go on a trip so badly, I don't have anything against it.\" \"How about visiting the South Pole?\" It seemed as soon as I spoke the words \"South Pole,\" something changed inside him. I had a premonition that if we went to the South Pole something would happen to us, but I couldn't find a good reason to cancel the trip. When we stepped off onto the ground of the South Pole I felt my husbands body lurch. something inside the ice man had been secretly violently shaken. He walked enthusiastically from place to place as if he couldn't get enough of it. He learned the local language quickly. I felt as though my husband had betrayed me and left me to care for myself. I eventually lost my strength. The airplane that had brought us there wad long since gone, and the runway was covered with ice. \"Winter has come It looks as though we'll have to stay here until next spring.\" About three months after we arrived, I realized I was pregnant. The child would be a little ice man. I could feel its chill inside me, Our new family would never again set foot outside the South Pole. I am lonelier than anyone else in the world.\n\n"

        "writing_prompt": "In 1971, you cooked spaghetti obsessively, as if each strand held the key to understanding your solitude. One rainy afternoon, the phone rang, and a voice from the past asked for help. What do you do when the comfort of boiling pasta collides with the weight of someone else's troubles?",
        "story": "Nineteen-seventy-one was the Year of Spaghetti.\n\nIn 1971, I cooked spaghetti to live, and lived to cook spaghetti. Steam rising from the pot was my pride and joy, tomato sauce bubbling up in the saucepan my one great hope in life.\n\nPublished in the print edition of the November 21, 2005, issue.\n\nI went to a cooking specialty store and bought a kitchen timer and a huge aluminum pot, big enough to bathe a German shepherd in, then went around to all the supermarkets that catered to foreigners, gathering an assortment of odd-sounding spices. I picked up a pasta cookbook at the bookstore, and bought tomatoes by the dozen. I purchased every brand of spaghetti I could lay my hands on, simmered every sauce known to man. Fine particles of garlic, onion, and olive oil swirled in the air, forming a harmonious cloud that penetrated every corner of my tiny apartment, permeating the floor and the ceiling and the walls, my clothes, my books, my records, my tennis racquet, my bundles of old letters. It was a fragrance one might have smelled on ancient Roman aqueducts.\n\nThis is a story from the Year of Spaghetti, 1971 A.D.\n\nAs a rule, I cooked spaghetti, and ate it, by myself. I was convinced that spaghetti was a dish best enjoyed alone. I can\u2019t really explain why I felt that way, but there it is.\n\nI always drank tea with my spaghetti and ate a simple lettuce-and-cucumber salad. I\u2019d make sure I had plenty of both. I laid everything out neatly on the table and enjoyed a leisurely meal, glancing at the paper as I ate. From Sunday to Saturday, one Spaghetti Day followed another. And each new Sunday started a brand-new Spaghetti Week.\n\nEvery time I sat down to a plate of spaghetti\u2014especially on a rainy afternoon\u2014I had the distinct feeling that somebody was about to knock on my door. The person who I imagined was about to visit me was different each time. Sometimes it was a stranger, sometimes someone I knew. Once, it was a girl with slim legs whom I\u2019d dated in high school, and once it was myself, from a few years back, come to pay a visit. Another time, it was William Holden, with Jennifer Jones on his arm.\n\nWilliam Holden?\n\nNot one of these people, however, actually ventured into my apartment. They hovered just outside the door, without knocking, like fragments of memory, and then slipped away.\n\nSpring, summer, and fall, I cooked and cooked, as if cooking spaghetti were an act of revenge. Like a lonely, jilted girl throwing old love letters into the fireplace, I tossed one handful of spaghetti after another into the pot.\n\nI\u2019d gather up the trampled-down shadows of time, knead them into the shape of a German shepherd, toss them into the roiling water, and sprinkle them with salt. Then I\u2019d hover over the pot, oversized chopsticks in hand, until the timer dinged its plaintive note.\n\nSpaghetti strands are a crafty bunch, and I couldn\u2019t let them out of my sight. If I were to turn my back, they might well slip over the edge of the pot and vanish into the night. The night lay in silent ambush, hoping to waylay the prodigal strands.\n\nSpaghetti alla parmigiana\n\nSpaghetti alla napoletana\n\nSpaghetti al cartoccio\n\nSpaghetti aglio e olio\n\nSpaghetti alla carbonara\n\nSpaghetti della pina\n\nAnd then there was the pitiful, nameless leftover spaghetti carelessly tossed into the fridge.\n\nA Public Defender's Radical Approach to Representing The January 6th Rioters\n\n\nBorn in heat, the strands of spaghetti washed down the river of 1971 and vanished.\n\nI mourn them all\u2014all the spaghetti of the year 1971.\n\nWhen the phone rang at 3:20 p.m. I was sprawled out on the tatami, staring at the ceiling. A pool of winter sunlight had formed in the place where I lay. Like a dead fly I lay there, vacant, in a December spotlight.\n\nAt first, I didn\u2019t recognize the sound as the phone ringing. It was more like an unfamiliar memory that had hesitantly slipped in between the layers of air. Finally, though, it began to take shape, and, in the end, a ringing phone was unmistakably what it was. It was one hundred per cent a phone ring in one-hundred-per-cent real air. Still sprawled out, I reached over and picked up the receiver.\n\nOn the other end was a girl, a girl so indistinct that, by four-thirty, she might very well have disappeared altogether. She was the ex-girlfriend of a friend of mine. Something had brought them together, this guy and this indistinct girl, and something had led them to break up. I had, I admit, reluctantly played a role in getting them together in the first place.\n\n\u201cSorry to bother you,\u201d she said, \u201cbut do you know where he is now?\u201d\n\nI looked at the phone, running my eyes along the length of the cord. The cord was, sure enough, attached to the phone. I managed a vague reply. There was something ominous in the girl\u2019s voice, and whatever trouble was brewing I knew that I didn\u2019t want to get involved.\n\n\u201cNobody will tell me where he is,\u201d she said in a chilly tone. \u201cEverybody\u2019s pretending they don\u2019t know. But there\u2019s something important I have to tell him, so please\u2014tell me where he is. I promise I won\u2019t drag you into this. Where is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know,\u201d I told her. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him in a long time.\u201d My voice didn\u2019t sound like my own. I was telling the truth about not having seen him for a long time, but not about the other part\u2014I did know his address and phone number. Whenever I tell a lie, something weird happens to my voice.\n\nNo comment from her.\n\nThe phone was like a pillar of ice.\n\nThen all the objects around me turned into pillars of ice, as if I were in a J. G. Ballard science-fiction story.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know,\u201d I repeated. \u201cHe went away a long time ago, without saying a word.\u201d\n\nThe girl laughed. \u201cGive me a break. He\u2019s not that clever. We\u2019re talking about a guy who has to make a lot of noise no matter what he does.\u201d\n\nShe was right. The guy really was a bit of a dim bulb.\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t about to tell her where he was. Do that, and next I\u2019d have him on the phone, giving me an earful. I was through with getting caught up in other people\u2019s messes. I\u2019d already dug a hole in the back yard and buried everything that needed to be buried in it. Nobody could ever dig it up again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like me, do you?\u201d she said suddenly.\n\nI had no idea what to say. I didn\u2019t particularly dislike her. I had no real impression of her at all. It\u2019s hard to have a bad impression of somebody you have no impression of.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said again. \u201cBut I\u2019m cooking spaghetti right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said I\u2019m cooking spaghetti,\u201d I lied. I had no idea why I said that. But the lie had already become a part of me\u2014so much so that, at that moment at least, it didn\u2019t feel like a lie at all.\n\n\nI went ahead and filled an imaginary pot with imaginary water, lit an imaginary stove with an imaginary match.\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d she asked.\n\nI sprinkled imaginary salt into the boiling water, gently lowered a handful of imaginary spaghetti into the imaginary pot, set the imaginary kitchen timer for eight minutes.\n\n\u201cSo I can\u2019t talk. The spaghetti will be ruined.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t say anything.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, but cooking spaghetti is a delicate operation.\u201d\n\nThe girl was silent. The phone in my hand began to freeze again.\n\n\u201cSo could you call me back?\u201d I added hurriedly.\n\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re in the middle of making spaghetti?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you making it for someone, or are you going to eat alone?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll eat it by myself,\u201d I said.\n\nShe held her breath for a long time, then slowly breathed out. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you could know this, but I\u2019m really in trouble. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t help you,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some money involved, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe owes me money,\u201d she said. \u201cI lent him some money. I shouldn\u2019t have, but I had to.\u201d\n\nI was quiet for a minute, my thoughts drifting toward spaghetti. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got the spaghetti going, so . . .\u201d\n\nShe gave a listless laugh. \u201cGoodbye,\u201d she said. \u201cSay hi to your spaghetti for me. I hope it turns out O.K.\u201d\n\n\u201cBye,\u201d I said.\n\nWhen I hung up the phone, the circle of light on the floor had shifted an inch or two. I lay down again in that pool of light and resumed staring at the ceiling.\n\nThinking about spaghetti that boils eternally but is never done is a sad, sad thing.\n\nNow I regret, a little, that I didn\u2019t tell the girl anything. Perhaps I should have. I mean, her ex-boyfriend wasn\u2019t much to start with\u2014an empty shell of a guy with artistic pretensions, a great talker whom nobody trusted. She sounded as if she really were strapped for money, and, no matter what the situation, you\u2019ve got to pay back what you borrow.\n\nSometimes I wonder what happened to the girl\u2014the thought usually pops into my mind when I\u2019m facing a steaming-hot plate of spaghetti. After she hung up the phone, did she disappear forever, sucked into the 4:30 p.m. shadows? Was I partly to blame?\n\nI want you to understand my position, though. At the time, I didn\u2019t want to get involved with anyone. That\u2019s why I kept on cooking spaghetti, all by myself. In that huge pot, big enough to hold a German shepherd.\n\nDurum semolina, golden wheat wafting in Italian fields.\n\nCan you imagine how astonished the Italians would be if they knew that what they were exporting in 1971 was really loneliness? \u2666\n\n"
