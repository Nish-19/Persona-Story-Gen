        "writing_prompt": "In a world where people can split themselves into two younger versions at any point in their lives, one woman refuses to split, defying societal norms. What happens when her choice begins to unravel the delicate balance of this strange society?",
        "story": "The first story Maya wrote was about a world in which people split themselves in two instead of reproducing. In that world, every person could, at any given moment, turn into two beings, each one half his/her age. Some chose to do this when they were young; for instance, an eighteen-year-old might split into two nine-year-olds. Others would wait until they\u2019d established themselves professionally and financially and go for it only in middle age. The heroine of Maya\u2019s story was splitless. She had reached the age of eighty and, despite constant social pressure, insisted on not splitting. At the end of the story, she died.\n\nIt was a good story, except for the ending. There was something depressing about that part, Aviad thought. Depressing and predictable. But Maya, in the writing workshop she had signed up for, actually got a lot of compliments on the ending. The instructor, who was supposed to be this well-known writer, even though Aviad had never heard of him, told her that there was something soul-piercing about the banality of the ending, or some other piece of crap. Aviad saw how happy that compliment made Maya. She was very excited when she told him about it. She recited what the writer had said to her the way people recite a verse from the Bible. And Aviad, who had originally tried to suggest a different ending, backpedalled and said that it was all a matter of taste and that he really didn\u2019t understand much about it.\n\nBooks & Fiction\nEarly access to new short stories, plus essays, criticism, and coverage of the literary world.

She\u2019d said that a friend\u2019s daughter had attended one and enjoyed it very much. Aviad also thought that it would be good for Maya to get out more, to do something with herself. He could always bury himself in work, but, since the miscarriage, she never left the house. Whenever he came home, he found her in the living room, sitting up straight on the couch. Not reading, not watching TV, not even crying. When Maya hesitated about the course, Aviad knew how to persuade her. \u201cGo once, give it a try,\u201d he said, \u201cthe way a kid goes to day camp.\u201d Later, he realized that it had been a little insensitive of him to use a child as an example, after what they\u2019d been through two months before. But Maya actually smiled and said that day camp might be just what she needed.\n\nThe second story she wrote was about a world in which you could see only the people you loved. The protagonist was a married man in love with his wife. One day, his wife walked right into him in the hallway and the glass he was holding fell and shattered on the floor. A few days later, she sat down on him as he was dozing in an armchair. Both times, she wriggled out of it with an excuse: she\u2019d had something else on her mind; she hadn\u2019t been looking when she sat down. But the husband started to suspect that she didn\u2019t love him anymore. To test his theory, he decided to do something drastic: he shaved off the left side of his mustache. He came home with half a mustache, clutching a bouquet of anemones. His wife thanked him for the flowers and smiled. He could sense her groping the air as she tried to give him a kiss. Maya called the story \u201cHalf a Mustache,\u201d and told Aviad that when she\u2019d read it aloud in the workshop some people had cried. Aviad said, \u201cWow,\u201d and kissed her on the forehead. That night, they fought about some stupid little thing. She\u2019d forgotten to pass on a message or something like that, and he yelled at her. He was to blame, and in the end he apologized. \u201cI had a hellish day at work,\u201d he said and stroked her leg, trying to make up for his outburst. \u201cDo you forgive me?\u201d She forgave him.\n\nThe workshop instructor had published a novel and a collection of short stories. Neither had been much of a success, but they\u2019d had a few good reviews. At least, that\u2019s what the saleswoman at a bookstore near Aviad\u2019s office told him. The novel was very thick, six hundred and twenty-four pages. Aviad bought the book of short stories. He kept it in his desk and tried to read a little during lunch breaks. Each story in the collection took place in a different foreign country. It was a kind of gimmick. The blurb on the back cover said that the writer had worked for years as a tour guide in Cuba and Africa and that his travels had influenced his writing. There was also a small black-and-white photograph of him. In it, he had the kind of smug smile of someone who feels lucky to be who he is. The writer had told Maya, she said to Aviad, that when the workshop was over he\u2019d send her stories to his editor. And, although she shouldn\u2019t get her hopes up, publishers these days were desperate for new talent.\n\nHer third story started out funny. It was about a woman who gave birth to a cat. The hero of the story was the husband, who suspected that the cat wasn\u2019t his. A fat ginger tomcat that slept on the lid of the dumpster right below the window of the couple\u2019s bedroom gave the husband a condescending look every time he went downstairs to throw out the garbage. In the end, there was a violent clash between the husband and the cat. The husband threw a stone at the cat, which countered with bites and scratches. The injured husband, his wife, and the kitten she was breastfeeding went to the clinic for him to get a rabies shot. He was humiliated and in pain but tried not to cry while they were waiting. The kitten, sensing his suffering, uncurled itself from its mother\u2019s embrace, went over to him, and licked his face tenderly, offering a consoling \u201cMeow.\u201d \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d the mother asked emotionally. \u201cHe said \u2018Daddy.\u2019 \u201d At that point, the husband could no longer hold back his tears. And, when Aviad read that passage, he had to try hard not to cry, too. Maya said that she\u2019d started writing the story even before she knew she was pregnant again. \u201cIsn\u2019t it weird,\u201d she asked, \u201chow my brain didn\u2019t know yet, but my subconscious did?\u201d\n\nA Family Reckons with a Father\u2019s Wish to Be Preserved Using Cryonics in \u201cEternal Father\u201d\n\n\nThe next Tuesday, when Aviad was supposed to pick her up after the workshop, he arrived half an hour early, parked his car in the lot, and went to find her. Maya was surprised to see him in the classroom, and he insisted that she introduce him to the writer. The writer reeked of body lotion. He shook Aviad\u2019s hand limply and told him that if Maya had chosen him for a husband he must be a very special person.\n\nThree weeks later, Aviad signed up for a beginners\u2019 creative-writing class. He didn\u2019t say anything about it to Maya, and, to be on the safe side, he told his secretary that if he had any calls from home she should say that he was in an important meeting and couldn\u2019t be disturbed. The other members of the class were mostly elderly women, who gave him dirty looks. The thin young instructor wore a head scarf, and the women in the class gossiped about her, saying that she lived in a settlement in the occupied territories and had cancer. She asked everyone to do an exercise in automatic writing. \u201cWrite whatever comes into your head,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t think, just write.\u201d Aviad tried to stop thinking. It was very hard. The old women around him wrote with nervous speed, like students racing to finish an exam before the teacher tells them to put their pens down, and after a few minutes he began writing, too.\n\n\nThe story he wrote was about a fish that was swimming happily along in the sea when a wicked witch turned it into a man. The fish couldn\u2019t come to terms with his transformation and decided to chase down the wicked witch and make her turn him back into a fish. Since he was an especially quick and enterprising fish, he managed to get married while he was pursuing her, and even to establish a small company that imported plastic products from the Far East. With the help of the enormous knowledge he had gained as a fish who had crossed the seven seas, the company began to thrive and even went public. Meanwhile, the wicked witch, who was a little tired after all her years of wickedness, decided to find all the people and creatures she\u2019d cast spells on, apologize to them, and restore them to their natural state. At one point, she even went to see the fish she had turned into a man. The fish\u2019s secretary asked her to wait until he\u2019d finished a satellite meeting with his partners in Taiwan. At that stage in his life, the fish could hardly remember that he was in fact a fish, and his company now controlled half the world. The witch waited several hours, but when she saw that the meeting wouldn\u2019t be ending any time soon she climbed onto her broom and flew off. The fish kept doing better and better, until one day, when he was really old, he looked out the window of one of the dozens of huge shoreline buildings he\u2019d purchased in a smart real-estate deal, and saw the sea. And suddenly he remembered that he was a fish. A very rich fish who controlled many subsidiary companies that were traded on stock markets around the world, but still a fish. A fish who, for years, had not tasted the salt of the sea.\n\nWhen the instructor saw that Aviad had put down his pen, she gave him an inquiring look. \u201cI don\u2019t have an ending,\u201d he whispered apologetically, keeping his voice down so as not to disturb the old ladies who were still writing. \u2666\n\n"

What happens when love, pride, and chaos collide in a crowded mall?",
        "story": "Icelebrate the kid\u2019s birthday the day after. Always the day after or the day before, never on the actual date. Always the same shit. Why? Because his honor the judge decided that the kid has to be with his mommy on his birthday, even if she\u2019s a bitch and a liar who fucks every jerk who smiles at her at work. Daddy is less important.\n\nLidor and I go to the mall together, not for a present; the last time I was in a duty-free shop, I bought him a remote-control multicopter drone. Eighty-nine dollars\u2014eighty-nine!\u2014and they didn\u2019t even put batteries for the remote in the box. So we\u2019re going to the mall to pick up some batteries, but I tell Lidor that it\u2019s to have fun. What can I tell him? Not only did Daddy bring his present a day late but he didn\u2019t even check to see if there were batteries inside? No way.\n\nThe bitch. Yesterday I say to her, Let me come to the party, just for ten minutes. To give the kid a kiss, take a shot of him with my cell when he blows out the candles, and then I\u2019ll leave. But she starts with the threats and the restraining orders, texts her boyfriend, the law clerk, while she\u2019s on the line with me\u2014I can actually hear her tapping\u2014and says that if she sees me anywhere near the building she\u2019ll make my life hell.\n\nLidor wants us to fly the drone first and then go to the mall, but there are no batteries in the remote, and I don\u2019t want to tell him that, so I say, We\u2019ll go to the big candy store on the third floor, the one with the SpongeBob SquarePants helium balloons and the lady with yellow teeth who yells, \u201cCome in! Come in! Buy candy for the little boy,\u201d and I\u2019ll buy him another present there, whatever he wants.\n\nLidor says, The mall\u2019s great, but first the drone. I lie to him, tell him that the mall closes early. Luckily for me, he\u2019s still young enough to believe.\n\nThree in the afternoon and the mall is packed. To be with him for his birthday, I had to take half a day off work. Judging by how mobbed the mall is, I must be the only person in this country who works. But Lidor, what a sweet kid, he laughs all the time, never whines, not even when we have to wait in line forever to get inside.\n\nAt the escalator, he wants to go up the down side, for the fun of it, and I go along with him. It\u2019s a good workout for both of us. You have to run as fast as you can so you won\u2019t be dragged down, have to strain the whole time not to fall on your ass. Just like in life. A hunchbacked old lady who is coming down tries to argue with us, asks why we don\u2019t go up the regular way, like everyone else. She\u2019ll be in her grave in another minute, and this is what bothers her? I don\u2019t even answer her.\n\nWhen we get to the candy store on the third floor, the lady with yellow teeth isn\u2019t there, only a pimple-faced teen-ager, as thin as a chopstick. I say to Lidor, \u201cPick out whatever you want. But only one thing, O.K.? And whatever it is, even if it costs a million shekels, Daddy will buy it for you, promise. What does Lidor want?\u201d\n\nThe kid is excited, walks around the store like a junkie in a pharmacy, looks at the shelves, picks things up, tries to decide. Meanwhile, I use the time to buy AAA batteries. Pimple-Face doesn\u2019t ring them up on the register, even though I wave the money in front of him. \u201cWhat are we waiting for?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cFor the kid to decide,\u201d he says, and pulls a string of gum out of his mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll ring them up together.\u201d And, before I can say anything, he starts playing with his cell.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nSwift Justice: A Taliban Courtroom in Session\n\n\n\u201cDo them separately, man,\u201d I insist, shoving the batteries into the bag with the drone. \u201cBefore the kid comes over. It\u2019s a surprise.\u201d Pimple-Face rings them up, and the cash-register drawer springs open with a ding. He doesn\u2019t have small bills to make change for me, so he loads me down with coins.\n\nJust then, Lidor comes over. \u201cWhat did you buy, Daddy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d I say. \u201cJust some gum.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is it?\u201d Lidor asks.\n\n\u201cI swallowed it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s bad to swallow gum,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can stick to your stomach.\u201d\n\nPimple-Face gives a stupid laugh.\n\n\u201cYou want a present or what?\u201d I say, changing the subject. \u201cCome on, pick out something.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want that,\u201d Lidor says, pointing to the cash register. \u201cSo I can play with Yanir and Lyri, like we have a candy store.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t sell the cash register,\u201d I say. \u201cPick out something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want the cash register,\u201d Lidor persists. \u201cDaddy, you promised.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said to pick out something that\u2019s for sale.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a liar!\u201d Lidor yells and kicks my leg as hard as he can. \u201cJust like Mommy says. You\u2019re all talk.\u201d\n\nThe kick hurts, and, when something hurts me, I get pissed off. But today I manage to control myself. Because I love my son more than anything else in the world, and today\u2019s a special day, his birthday. I mean, the day after his birthday. The bitch.\n\n\u201cHow much do you want for the cash register?\u201d I ask Pimple-Face, as cool as can be.\n\n\u201cWhat are you, six years old?\u201d he says with a crooked smile. \u201cYou know it\u2019s not for sale.\u201d He says \u201csix years old\u201d as if Lidor were a moron or something, and I realize now that he\u2019s trapped me. I have to choose a side\u2014either I\u2019m with him or I\u2019m with Lidor.\n\n\u201cA thousand shekels,\u201d I say and extend my hand. \u201cWe shake on it now, and I go down to the A.T.M. and come back with the money.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not mine,\u201d he says, squirming. \u201cI just work here.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo whose is it?\u201d I ask. \u201cThe lady with yellow teeth?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he says, nodding. \u201cTirza.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo get her on the phone,\u201d I say. \u201cLet me talk to her. For a thousand shekels, she can get a new register. A better one.\u201d\n\nLidor looks at me like I\u2019m some kind of a superhero. There\u2019s nothing greater than to have your kid look at you that way. It\u2019s better than a vacation in Thailand. Better than a blow job. Better than punching someone who has it coming. \u201cGo ahead, call her,\u201d I say and give him a little push. Not because I\u2019m angry. For the kid.\n\n\nHe taps in the number and walks away from us, half whispering into the phone. I follow him wherever he goes, Lidor behind us. He looks happy. He was already happy earlier, when I picked him up, but now he\u2019s flying.\n\n\u201cShe says no,\u201d Pimple-Face tells me and shrugs as if the word had come from God.\n\n\u201cGive her to me.\u201d I gesture with my hand.\n\n\u201cShe says stores don\u2019t sell their cash registers,\u201d he says. I grab the phone away from him. That makes Lidor laugh. Daddy\u2019s making Lidor laugh.\n\n\u201cYoull feel a pinch and then a burn.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll feel a pinch and then a burn.\u201d\nCopy link to cartoon\nLink copied\n\nShop\n\u201cTirza,\u201d I say. \u201cHi, this is Gabi, a good customer of yours. You don\u2019t recognize the name, but you\u2019d know my face in a second. Listen, I need you to help me out here. A thousand shekels\u2014you not only buy a new register, but I owe you a favor.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd where the fuck will we ring up the thousand?\u201d Tirza asks on the other end of the line. She\u2019s in a noisy place; I can hardly hear her.\n\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t ring it up,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat am I, the Tax Authority? A thousand shekels straight into your pocket. Come on, what do you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cPut him on the phone,\u201d she says impatiently.\n\n\u201cThe teen-ager?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Tirza says, starting to sound angry. \u201cPut him on.\u201d\n\nI hand the phone to Pimple-Face. He talks to her for a minute, then ends the call. \u201cShe says no,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\nLidor takes my hand. \u201cCash register,\u201d he says in his most serious voice. \u201cYou promised.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo thousand,\u201d I say to Pimple-Face. \u201cCall her back and tell her I\u2019ll give her two thousand, a thousand now and another thousand tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Pimple-Face starts.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t take out more than a thousand at a time,\u201d I interrupt him. \u201cI\u2019ll bring the other thousand tomorrow morning. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll leave you my driver\u2019s license as a guarantee.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe told me not to call anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s sitting shivah for her father. She doesn\u2019t want to be disturbed.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry for your loss,\u201d I say, putting a consoling arm around his shoulder. \u201cSo think about it. Two thousand is a lot of money. If she finds out later that I offered it and you said no, she\u2019ll tear you a new one. Listen to a grownup\u2014it\u2019s not worth getting into trouble over a small thing like this.\u201d\n\nI press the bottom of the cash-register drawer and, bam, it opens. It\u2019s a trick I learned when I worked at the Burger Ranch, after the Army. \u201cTake out the money,\u201d I tell him, but he doesn\u2019t move, so I collect the money for him and stick it into the front pocket of his jeans.\n\n\u201cStores don\u2019t sell their cash registers,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWho cares,\u201d I say. \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s a sweet deal. Wait here for me, and I\u2019ll be back in five minutes with a thousand shekels so the bills in your pocket don\u2019t get lonely.\u201d\n\nBefore he can answer, I take Lidor by the hand and go down to the A.T.M. Sometimes the machine gives me problems, but today it spits out the thousand in blue two-hundred-shekel bills without arguing.\n\nWhen we get back, a sweaty fat guy with a mustache is talking to Pimple-Face. I know him, he owns the frozen-yogurt stand next door. When Pimple-Face sees us come in, he points at me. I wink at him and put the thousand on the counter. \u201cHere,\u201d I say. Pimple-Face doesn\u2019t move. \u201cCome on, take it already! Lighten up!\u201d I pick the bills up and try to shove them into his pocket.\n\n\u201cLeave him alone,\u201d Fat Guy says. \u201cHe\u2019s just a kid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cI promised my son. Today\u2019s his birthday.\u201d\n\n\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d Fat Guy says and tousles Lidor\u2019s hair without even looking at him. \u201cWant some ice cream, buddy? A present from me\u2014a cup of ice cream with whipped cream and chocolate syrup and gummy bears on top.\u201d The whole time he\u2019s talking his small eyes stay fixed on me.\n\n\u201cI want the cash register,\u201d Lidor says, moving away from him and pressing up against me. \u201cDaddy promised.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will you do with a cash register?\u201d Fat Guy asks but doesn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cWe have one, too, but only because the tax people make us use it. It\u2019s not good for anything. It just makes noise. What do you say\u2014let Daddy take you to the computer store on the second floor and buy you an Xbox instead. For a thousand shekels, you can get the best one, with Kinect and everything.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t say anything. I actually like the idea. It\u2019ll save me a lot of trouble here, and later, too, with Lilia, when I take him back home. Because the minute Lilia sees the cash register, she\u2019ll start carrying on.\n\n\u201cSo what do you say?\u201d Fat Guy asks Lidor. \u201cXbox is the best. Races, chases, whatever you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cCash register,\u201d Lidor says, hugging my legs tightly.\n\n\u201cLook at what an angel he is,\u201d I say and try to hand the money to Fat Guy. \u201cHelp me make him happy on his birthday.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my store,\u201d Fat Guy protests. \u201cI don\u2019t even work here. I\u2019m just trying to help\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re not.\u201d I move so close to him now that my face almost touches his.\n\n\u201cI have to go back to the store.\u201d Fat Guy shrugs and says to Pimple-Face, \u201cIf he tries anything, call the police,\u201d and leaves. A real hero.\n\nI put the thousand shekels on the counter, unplug the register, and start rolling up the cord, and, when Lidor sees that, he claps his hands.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling the cops,\u201d Pimple-Face says, and begins punching in numbers. I grab the phone away from him again.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s his birthday today. Everyone\u2019s happy, don\u2019t ruin it.\u201d Pimple-Face looks at his phone, which is in my hand, then at me, and runs out of the store. I put Pimple-Face\u2019s phone on the counter and pick up the register. \u201cNow we\u2019ll leave here fast,\u201d I say to Lidor, my voice cheerful, as if this were a game. \u201cWe\u2019ll go back home and show Mommy what you got.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lidor says, stamping his feet. \u201cFirst we fly the helicopter and then we go home. You promised.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say in my gentlest voice. \u201cBut the cash register is heavy. Daddy can\u2019t carry it and fly the helicopter at the same time. Now the register and tomorrow, right after school, we\u2019ll go fly the helicopter in the park.\u201d\n\nLidor thinks for a minute. \u201cNow the helicopter,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd tomorrow the cash register.\u201d And right then, just in time, Pimple-Face comes running back into the store with a security guard.\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d the guard says. He\u2019s a short, hairy guy, looks more like a pinscher than like a security guard.\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d I give him a wink and put the cash register back in place. \u201cJust trying to make the kid laugh. It\u2019s his birthday today.\u201d\n\n\u201cHappy birthday, kid,\u201d the guard says to Lidor, as if he couldn\u2019t care less. \u201cMany happy returns. But now you and your father have to leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lidor says. \u201cWe have to go and fly the helicopter.\u201d\n\nIn the park, Lidor and I play with the multicopter drone. The brochure says that it can fly forty metres high, but after about fifteen metres it can\u2019t pick up the signal from the remote, its propeller stops spinning, and it falls. Lidor likes that.\n\n\u201cWho loves Lidor the most in the world?\u201d I ask, and Lidor answers, \u201cDaddy!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how much does Lidor love Daddy?\u201d I ask while the multicopter drone spins around him, and he yells, \u201cA whole bunch!\u201d\n\n\u201cUp to the sky,\u201d I shout. \u201cUp to the moon and back!\u201d\n\nMy cell starts vibrating in my pocket, but I ignore it. It must be Lilia. Above us, the drone is getting smaller and smaller. In another second, it\u2019ll be out of our field of vision and will fall. Then we\u2019ll both start running across the grass and try to catch it, and if Lidor beats me to it again he\u2019ll laugh that killer laugh of his. There\u2019s nothing nicer in this stinking world than the sound of a kid laughing. \u2666\n\n"

        "story": "P.T. sees him first. We\u2019re on our way to the park to play ball when he suddenly says, \u201cDaddy, look!\u201d His head is tilted back and he\u2019s squinting hard to see something far above me, and before I can even begin to imagine an alien spaceship or a piano about to fall on our heads my gut tells me that something really bad is happening. But, when I turn to see what P.T. is looking at, all I notice is an ugly, four-story building covered in plaster and dotted with air-conditioners, as if it had some kind of skin disease. The sun is hanging directly above it, blinding me, and as I\u2019m trying to get a better angle I hear P.T. say, \u201cHe wants to fly.\u201d Now I can see a guy in a white button-down shirt standing on the roof railing looking down at me, and, behind me, P.T. whispers, \u201cIs he a superhero?\u201d\n\nInstead of answering him, I shout at the guy, \u201cDon\u2019t do it!\u201d\n\nThe guy just stares at me.\n\nI shout again, \u201cDon\u2019t do it, please! Whatever took you up there must seem like something you\u2019ll never get over, but, believe me, you will! If you jump now, you\u2019ll leave this world with that dead-end feeling. That\u2019ll be your last memory of life. Not family, not love, only defeat. If you stay, I swear to you by everything I hold dear that your pain will start to fade and, in a few years, the only thing left of it will be a weird story you tell people over a beer. A story about how you once wanted to jump off a roof and some guy standing below shouted at you . . .\u201d\n\nBooks & Fiction\nEarly access to new short stories, plus essays, criticism, and coverage of the literary world.

He probably can\u2019t hear me because of the noise coming from the road. Or maybe it isn\u2019t the noise, because I heard his \u201cWhat?\u201d perfectly well. Maybe he\u2019s just hard of hearing.\n\nP.T., who\u2019s hugging my thighs without being able to completely encircle them, as if I were some kind of giant baobab tree, yells at the guy, \u201cDo you have super powers?\u201d\n\nBut the guy points at his ear again, as if he were deaf, and shouts, \u201cI\u2019m sick of it! Enough! How much can I take?\u201d\n\nP.T. shouts back at him, as if they were having the most ordinary conversation in the world, \u201cCome on, fly already!\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019m starting to feel that stress, the stress that comes with knowing that it\u2019s all on you.\n\nI have it a lot at work. With the family, too. Like what happened back then, on the way to Lake Kinneret, when I tried to brake and the tires locked. The car started to skid along the road and I said to myself, \u201cEither you fix this or it\u2019s all over.\u201d Driving to the Kinneret, I didn\u2019t fix it, and Liat, who was the only one not buckled in, died, and I was left alone with the kids. P.T. was two and barely knew how to speak, but Amit never stopped asking me, \u201cWhen is Mommy coming back? When is Mommy coming back?\u201d\u2014and I\u2019m talking about after the funeral. He was eight then, an age when you\u2019re supposed to understand what it means to die, but he kept asking. Even without the constant, annoying questions, I knew that everything was my fault and I wanted to end it all, just like the guy on the roof. But here I am today, walking without crutches, living with Simona, being a good dad.\n\nI want to tell the guy on the roof all this. I want to tell him that I know exactly how he feels and that, if he doesn\u2019t flatten himself like a pizza on the sidewalk, it\u2019ll pass. I know what I\u2019m talking about, because no one on this blue planet is as miserable as I was. He just has to get down from there and give himself a week. A month. Even a year, if necessary. But how can you say all that to a half-deaf guy who\u2019s four stories above you?\n\nMeanwhile, P.T. pulls on my hand and says, \u201cHe\u2019s not going to fly today, Daddy. Let\u2019s go to the park before it gets dark.\u201d\n\nLiz Cheney talks with David Remnick\n\n\nBut I stay where I am and shout as loudly as I can, \u201cPeople die like flies all the time, even without killing themselves. Don\u2019t do it! Please don\u2019t do it!\u201d\n\nThe guy on the roof nods\u2014it looks like he heard something this time\u2014and shouts at me, \u201cHow did you know? How did you know she died?\u201d\n\nSomeone always dies, I want to yell back. Always. If not her, then someone else. But that won\u2019t get him down from there, so instead I say, \u201cThere\u2019s a kid here,\u201d and point at P.T. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to see this!\u201d\n\nP.T. yells, \u201cYes, I do! Yes, I do! Come on and fly already, before it gets dark!\u201d It\u2019s December, and it really does get dark early.\n\nIf the guy jumps, that\u2019ll be on my conscience, too. Irena, the psychologist at the clinic, will give me that after-you-I\u2019m-going-home look of hers and say, \u201cYou\u2019re not responsible for everyone. You have to get that into your head.\u201d And I\u2019ll nod, because I know that the session will end in two minutes and she has to pick her daughter up from day care, but it won\u2019t change anything, because I\u2019ll have to carry that half-deaf guy on my back, along with Liat and Amit\u2019s glass eye.\n\n\u201cWait there for me!\u201d I scream. \u201cI\u2019m coming up to talk to you!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t go on without her. I can\u2019t!\u201d he shouts back.\n\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d I yell, and I say to P.T., \u201cCome on, sweetie, let\u2019s go up to the roof.\u201d\n\nP.T. gives an adorable shake of his head, the way he always does right before he sticks the knife in, and says, \u201cIf he flies, we can see better from here.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t fly,\u201d I say. \u201cNot today. Let\u2019s go up there just for a minute. Daddy has to tell the man something.\u201d\n\nBut P.T. persists, \u201cSo yell from here.\u201d His arm slips out of my grasp and he throws himself down on the ground, as he likes to do with Simona and me at the mall.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s race to the roof,\u201d I say. \u201cIf we get there without stopping, P.T. and Daddy get ice cream as a prize.\u201d\n\n\u201cIce cream now!\u201d P.T. wails, rolling around on the sidewalk. \u201cIce cream now!\u201d\n\nI have no time for this crap. I pick him up. He squirms and screams, but I ignore him and start running toward the door to the building.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to the kid?\u201d I hear the guy shout from the roof. I don\u2019t answer. Maybe his curiosity will keep him from jumping long enough for me to get up to the roof.\n\nP.T. is heavy. It\u2019s hard to climb all those stairs when you\u2019re holding a five-and-a-half-year-old kid in your arms, especially one who doesn\u2019t want to go up the stairs. By the third floor, I\u2019m completely out of breath. A fat redheaded woman who must have heard P.T.\u2019s screams opens her door a crack and asks who I\u2019m looking for, but I ignore her and keep climbing. Even if I wanted to say something to her, I don\u2019t have enough air in my lungs.\n\n\u201cNo one lives upstairs,\u201d she calls after me. \u201cIt\u2019s just the roof.\u201d\n\nWhen she says \u201croof,\u201d her shrill voice breaks, and P.T. yells back at her in a tear-filled tone, \u201cIce cream now! Now!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t have a free hand to push open the peeling door that should lead outside\u2014my arms are full of P.T., who doesn\u2019t stop flailing\u2014so I kick it as hard as I can. The roof is empty. The guy who was on the railing a minute ago isn\u2019t there anymore. He didn\u2019t wait for us. Didn\u2019t wait to see why the kid was screaming.\n\n\u201cHe flew,\u201d P.T. sobs. \u201cHe flew and because of you we didn\u2019t see anything!\u201d\n\nI start walking toward the railing. Maybe he changed his mind and went back inside, I try to tell myself. But I don\u2019t believe it. I know he\u2019s down there, his body sprawled at an unnatural angle on the sidewalk. I know it, and I have a kid in my arms who absolutely should not see that, because it would traumatize him for the rest of his life, and he\u2019s already been through enough. But my legs take me toward the edge of the roof. It\u2019s like scratching a wound, like ordering another shot of Chivas when you know you\u2019ve had too much to drink, like driving a car when you know you\u2019re tired, so tired.\n\n\nNow that we\u2019re almost at the railing, we start to feel the height. P.T. stops crying, and I can hear both of us panting and an ambulance siren in the distance. It seems to be asking me, \u201cWhy? Why do you need to see it? You think it\u2019ll change anything? Make anyone feel better?\u201d\n\nSuddenly, the redhead\u2019s high-pitched voice commands me from behind: \u201cPut him down!\u201d I turn around, not really understanding what she wants.\n\n\u201cPut me down!\u201d P.T. shouts, too. It always gets him going when a stranger butts in.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a kid,\u201d the redhead is saying, but her voice is suddenly soft. She\u2019s on the verge of tears. The sound of the siren is getting closer, and the redhead starts walking toward me. \u201cI know you\u2019re suffering,\u201d she says. \u201cI know that everything is so hard. I know, believe me.\u201d There\u2019s so much pain in her voice that even P.T. stops flailing and stares at her, mesmerized. \u201cLook at me,\u201d she whispers. \u201cFat, alone. I had a child once, too. You know what it is to lose a child? Do you have any idea what you\u2019re about to do?\u201d Still in my arms, P.T. hugs me tight. \u201cLook at what a sweet child he is,\u201d she says, already beside us, her thick hand stroking P.T.\u2019s hair.\n\n\u201cThere was a man here,\u201d P.T. says, fixing his huge green eyes\u2014Liat\u2019s eyes\u2014on her. \u201cThere was a man here, but now he flew away. And, because of Daddy, we didn\u2019t get to see him.\u201d\n\nThe siren stops right below us and I take another step toward the railing, but the redhead\u2019s sweaty hand grabs my arm. \u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d she says. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nP.T. has a scoop of vanilla in a plastic cup. I order pistachio and chocolate chip in a cone. The redhead asks for a chocolate milkshake. All the tables in the ice-cream parlor are filthy, so I clean one for us. P.T. insists on tasting the milkshake and she lets him. She\u2019s called Liat, too. It\u2019s a common name. She doesn\u2019t know about my Liat, about the accident. She doesn\u2019t know anything about us. And I don\u2019t know anything about her. Except that she lost a kid.\n\nWhen we left the building, medics were putting the guy\u2019s body into the ambulance. Luckily, it was covered with a white sheet. One less image of a corpse in my mind.\n\nThe ice cream is too sweet for me, but P.T. and the redhead look happy. With his cup in one hand, he reaches out for her milkshake with the other. I don\u2019t know why he always does that. After all, he\u2019s still eating his own ice cream\u2014why does he need more? I open my mouth to say something to him, but the redhead signals that it\u2019s O.K. and gives him her almost empty cup. Her child is dead, my wife is dead, the guy on the roof is dead.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so cute,\u201d she whispers, as P.T. strains to suck up the last drop of milkshake in the paper cup. He really is cute. \u2666\n\n"
