A long story short, Marella had a crush on someone.\n\u2014-----\nShe walked out of her lesson with Fintan tiredly.\n\u201cHow do I summon Everblaze?\u201d She had asked,\n\u201cYou don\u2019t, it calls for you.\u201d Fintan had responded.\nShe leaped to Choralmere where Linh was still staying. A hot tug kept pulling her. She did her best to ignore it but it was like ignoring getting stabbed. Linh opened the door with a smile and headed out to meet her.\n\u201cHey Mare.\u201d Linh said,\nShe was the one person who could call her that.\n\u201cHi Linh.\u201d She replied.\nMarella felt her cheeks warm. But before anyone could say anything else, Marella collapsed under the pressure of the hot tug. She was no longer in control; fire was. Before she knew it her hand was raised and yellow-white fire came down to her. Linh screamed and started gathering water. Quan and Mai Song threw frissin on the fire putting it out. But the fire was resilient and it came back time and time again.\n\u201cMARELLA!\u201d Linh screamed as her parents tried to drag her away.\nMarella would have responded but she wasn\u2019t Marella anymore all that was there was fire.\nLinh pulled out of her parents grasps and ran straight into the fire using her water to protect her. Marella was in the center of the blaze fighting for control of her ability.\n\u201cMarella.\u201d Linh said through a coughing fit. Smoke inhalation. \u201cCalm the blaze.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d Marella weeped.\nLinh walked closer to her, \u201cYes you can. You're Marella freaking Redek and you can do this!\u201d\nWhen Marella tried again and failed Linh got her heaving deep breaths.\n\u201cIn and out Mare, in and out.\u201d She coaxed.\nWhen Marella tried again the Everblaze stopped. The fires went out with only a small trace that they were ever there.\n\u201cEfflorescence.\u201d Linh breathed,\nIn the center of the efflorescence was a tall red and blue flower. Colors overlapping in an array of petals. Marella sighed in relief and wonder.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d She told Linh.\n\u201cIt was all you, Mare.\u201d Linh told her.\nMarella shook her head in defeat. She breathed in deeply, enjoying the scented air. Linh stood by her wrapping her in a quick hug.\n\u201cI\u2026 .\u201d Marella tried to say,\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Linh said, tilting her head to the side.\n\u201cI\u2026love you.\u201d She said, the latter as quiet as a single slow drop of water in a hurricane.\n\u201cMarella I couldn\u2019t hear you.\u201d Linh pointed out.\n\u201cI love you.\u201d Marella said again louder and faster.\n\u201cI love you too, Mare.\u201d\n\u201cNo like love love you.\u201d\n\u201cI do too.\u201d\nMarella looked at Linh in a new light.\n\u201cYou love me.\u201d She squeaked,\nLinh nodded, \u201cI worried you wouldn't feel the same so I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d\nMarella laughed in joy. Their hands came together and they smiled. Some wouldn't accept them. And that\u2019s just natural but that wouldn't stop them for acting on their emotions.",

A sharp pang of guilt hit her when she called out that she was back when she appeared back in the spot where she had died the first time. And every time the pattern in her chest flickered slightly it was a reminder that she would fall back down in the In Between. She knew it would be painful for her, and everyone she left behind. But it would be worth it.. \u2026. . Right? To stop Belos and save the Isles. She had to do this. Did she? If she had never followed Owlbert through the portal on that summer morning none of this would have ever happened. She knew that. It was a thought that plagued her mind every single time she woke up while they were trapped in the human realm. Followed by the thought of \u201cYou could end this all. All you need is a knife, or rope, or deep water.\u201d She hadn\u2019t told anyone she had thought of taking her life. Better to hide behind an illusion of contentment. But Hunter saw it. He saw it every time she pretended things were normal. Because he felt guilty too. Her fault as well.\nBut something smacked her in the face in this downward spiral. Hunter wouldn't exist if she hadn\u2019t come to the Boiling Isles. Amity would still be wrapped around her mothers finger. Willow would've never switched to the plant track. Gus (technically Agustus if she had just gone to camp) would be forever doubting himself with Willow as his only friend (and vice versa). Vee would still be trapped, she wouldn't be able to run forever. Matt would think he still had to prove himself. Eda would\u2019ve never opened up. King would keep living in denial. And the Collector, they would still be trapped with no way out (a fate he never deserved). The magic mixers (Jerbo, Viney and Barcus) would still be in the detention track. Luz smiled as she was lifted to the air, the Titan\u2019s power starting to leave her body.\n\u201cEda, King, thank you for being a part of my life.\u201d Luz said, before the Titan\u2019s spirit moved on and so did she.\nDeath was much more pleasant this time around. And she even smiled when she hit the strangely warm water in the In Between. She closed her eyes letting a few tears loose as she left the realm she loved. No one to pull her out of the water: she sank.\nLuz\u2019s eyes opened as she felt warmth. Not the all consuming warmth of the water but of love and the good feelings Luz missed. She looked in front of her.\n\u201cD\u2026. Dad?\u201d She said not quite believing it.\n\u201cHi Little Light.\u201d Manny said, opening his arms toward her.\nLuz ran towards him. A lifetime's worth of hug in one embrace. Luz cried happily wrapped in her father\u2019s warm hug.\n\u201cYou did so good Luz. My good witch.\u201d He said right in her ear neither breaking the hug.\nLuz agreed for the first time in a very long time. She had saved the realm she loved and the people she loved.\n\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Manny asked, pulling away and holding out his hand to Luz.\nLuz nodded, taking his hand.

Their eyes met and Keefe felt his cheeks grow warm.\n\u201cWell,\u201d he started keeping the mask on, \u201cyou're either ditching or lost and you're clearly not ditching.\u201d\n\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I be ditching?\u201d She challenged.\n\u201cAre you ditching?\u201d\n\u201cNo, what are you doing here?\u201d She asked him. Her voice was soft and timid, Keefe's cheeks grew warm again.\n\u201cI ditch whenever I can. Lady Belva has the worst crush on me, I mean I can\u2019t blame her, but it\u2019s still awkward you know.\u201d He paused,\n\u201cPlus now I get to meet the mysterious new girl so I\u2019d say ditching paid off.\u201d\nShe cocked her head at Keefe, studying him slightly and her cheeks grew a pink hue.\n\u201cI\u2019m hardly mysterious.\u201d She said still blushing.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see. So where are you supposed to be?\u201d He asked, ignoring the burning in his cheeks.\n\u201cAlchemy with Lady Galvin.\u201d She answered, then she glared at her wrist.\n\u201cOhh she hated me. She told me to \u2018impress her\u2019 so I turned the table to silver. Maybe don\u2019t mention that we're friends.\u201d\nKeefe smirked and she blushed.\n\u201cSo why are you out here?\u201d\n\u201cI exploded my elixir.\u201d\nKeefe laughed, \u201cDid you do any damage?\u201d\n\u201cOnly to her cape.\u201d\n\u201cWoah woah woah, do you realize how big that is! That cape is her pride and joy! Did she send you to the principal's office?\u201d\n\u201cNo, she sent me to the Healing Center; some of it got on my wrist.\u201d She glared at her wrist again.\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t you go over there then?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d She turned white as the words left her mouth.\n\u201cWhy did you turn as white as the glass?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d She started walking in the other direction.\n\u201cBoy are you going the wrong way; follow me.\u201d\nLuckily she followed.\n\u201cSophie?\u201d Elwin called as they walked through the door, \u201cI thought I\u2019d have to drag you back here to check on you.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d She said as Keefe cocked his head at her.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here Keefe?\u201d Elwin asked when he saw the boy behind the girl, evidently named Sophie.\n\u201cJust helping a fellow prodigy.\u201d Keefe replied.\n\u201cI see, you had to miss your session to do so.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d He said with an exaggerated sigh, \u201cbut Sophie needed help so what could I do.\u201d\n\u201cWell, take a seat.\u201d He told the two.\u201d\n\u201cThis looks like an acid burn. How'd you manage that?\u201d\n\u201cUmm, a slight accident in my Alchemy session.\u201d\nKeefe made explosion-like noises and mimed an explosion then added, \u201cDestroyed Lady Galvin\u2019s cape!\u201d\nElwin laughed, \u201cWish I could've seen that!\u201d\nSophie glared.\n\u201cSorry, let's get this treated.\u201d\nAs Elwin fixed the burn he turned to Keefe, \u201cShould I write you a pass.\u201d\nHe nodded, \"What a good idea.\u201d\n\u201cSessions not over for another 30 minutes so I\u2019d walk slow.\u201d\n\u201cOh I can\u2019t leave until I know Sophie\u2019s okay.\u201d\nElwin rolled his eyes and finished up with Sophie, and sent them away.

        "comment": "Keefe leaped to Havenfeild with Sophie, wondering for the millionth time if he should back out.\n\u201cWelcome home!\u201d Edaline called from the doorway. \u201cI thought I\u2019d stay outside to watch our new family of gremlins but also to warn you Sophie. Sandor and Grady are up in your room plotting some clever punishments for running away without your bodyguard. And Dex you should go home to face the wrath of Lovise, and wait is that Dex?\u201d\n\u201cNo Dex leaped home.\u201d Sophie replied as her and Keefe walked to the doorway.\n\u201cKeefe is that you?\u201d Edaline asked.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Keefe fidgeted with the strap of his bag nervously, \u201cSurprise.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you're back, we've missed you around here.\u201d Edaline said as she pulled him into a hug.\n\u201cR.. . really?\u201d\nEdaline nodded, \u201cHow are you feeling, do you need to talk about anything, and oh if you're not comfortable talking about some things that's totally okay, but I\u2019m here if you need to talk.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Keefe cleared his throat a few times but still sounded choked up when he said, \u201cSo that's what a mom is supposed to sound like. Good to know.\u201d\nEdaline pulled him in harder, enough for him to tease her about letting him breathe.\n\u201cYou and Foster should have a strangle hugging contest, it's hard to tell who would win but Foster almost knocked me over.\u201d\n\u201cDid she now?\u201d Edaline asked as she turned her gaze to Sophie, who was now staring at her shoes like they held the secrets of the universe.\n\u201cSo.. . what do you need? I baked a fresh ban of mallowmelt this morning\u2013\u201d\n\u201cYES PLEASE!\u201d Keefe interrupted Edaline.\n\u201cAnd some bottles of youth right?\u201d Sophie eventually asked.\n\u201cTHAT WOULD BE AMAZING!!\u201d Keefe said, jumping up and down.\nEdaline conjured the treats and Keefe teared up as she did so.\n\u201cOkay this is even better than I remembered! I\u2019m never leaving again!\u201d Keefe said after chugging a bottle of youth and eating two slices of mallowmelt.\n\u201cOh really?\u201d Sophie asked, tone teasing.\nKeefe didn\u2019t know what to say to that. It was hard to make jokes to change the subject when he couldn\u2019t read Sophie\u2019s emotions.\nLuckily Sophie changed the subject.\n\u201cSo.. . are you going back to Elwin\u2019s or\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMmh I dunno, I never thought about that.\u201d Keefe answered.\n\u201cYou could stay here, I mean Jolie\u2019s room is open.\u201d Sophie suggested.\n\u201cThanks but I\u2019m pretty sure that the most dangerous place I could be is locked in a house with your dad and Gigantor.\u201d\n\u201cWe could set you up under the Panakes.\u201d Edaline suddenly piped up. \u201cSophie used to sleep out there all the time.\u201d\n\u201cI remember, but I think I want somewhere without memories attached to it.\u201d Keefe said, trying to ignore the slightly hurt expression that was on Sophie\u2019s face. \u201cWhat is she thinking? What is she feeling?\u201d Keefe thought\n\u201cIf I may.\u201d A voice asked, making Keefe jump. It was Flori Sopie\u2019s gnomish bodyguard.\n\u201cIf you are looking for something new we could set you up a place in the gnomish grove.\u201d Flori suggested.\n\u201cUh sure I\u2019m down for a gnomish slumber party.\u201d\nFlori grinned, \u201cI\u2019ll prepare a bed.\u201d\n\u201cWell, this is definitely not how I thought today would go.\u201d Keefe said after he finished the last of the mallowmelt.\n\u201cMe neither.\u201d Sophie told him.\n\u201cI also didn\u2019t plan on forgiving me so quickly, I had multiple scenarios in mind. I even brought the first thing in the bribery one.\u201d\n\u201cBribery? Gifts?\u201d Sophie asked.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Keefe reached into his bag and pulled out a small stuffed elf plush.\nSophie burst into giggles when he pulled it out.\n\u201cI know it's silly but I know you like stuffed animals and I mean look at his little elf face.\u201d Keefe said quickly, making the elf do a little dance.\nSophie giggled again and said, \u201cI love it seriously.\u201d\nKeefe almost wanted to smile but he halfheartedly tossed her the elf.\n\u201cGood I almost didn\u2019t bring it in case.. .oh Flori\u2019s waiting for me bye.\u201d And he sprinted off leaving Sophie in the golden light of Havenfield.",

        "comment": "Hornfels suggested I write down everything that happens first solo launch forward (I almost asked which first solo launch but sadly didn't) I find it kinda pointless but whatever.\nLog #1\nI guess I should start with the day the loop started but eh I don\u2019t really want to\u2026.\n\u2013one fight with Hornfels later\u2013\nSo my first day when I went to get my launch codes afterwards the stupid Nomai statue stuck me in a stupid loop -_- (I still really want to smash it) went to the Attlerock TO SEE THE BEST GUARDIAN EVER AKA ESKER!!! After I looked around for a while and found pretty much nothing new (I explored it plenty back when I lived there) And so I dipped and went to see Gabs. We talked for a bit then I headed out to Brittle Hollow. I may have fallen into the black hole but as I got to the white hole I watched the sun close in on itself and blow up.\nLog #2\nI was majorly confused after that because I woke up on my solo launch day as if it never happened. So I went to see Gabbro in case they knew anything about it. They did. Gabbro theorized that because we both made \u201cSerious eye contact with a Nomai statue\u201d that it got us both stuck in a kind of loop. We laughed for a bit but then I realized.. . Feldspar might be still alive. To recap, before I went to Brittle Hallow I picked up a harmonica in my signalscope. I shared my realization with Gabs and they took it hard but we formed a plan to go to Dark Bramble together to see if they were still alive.\nLog #3\nFELDSPAR IS AN ABSOLUTE JERK! Gabs and I made it to Dark Bramble and we found Feldspar. They sucked! They were a jerk. Their story was basically \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell stories to Hatchlings so I crashed in a space plant\u201d that LITTLE BRAMBLE SEED! (Hehe I made that insult because bramble seeds are toxic and take over everything) Gabbro was just as livid as I am! Anyway I punched Feldspar in the face and tried to forget the whole experience.\nLog #4\nCrashes #15\nBoring crashes #0\nI\u2019ve been crashing a lot to get out my anger still in a violent way but eventually decided that exploring will get my mind off of the Feldspar incident. I ended up at Ash Twin and did some weird ritual type thing that will do something interesting.\nLog #5\nIT WAS VERY INTERESTING VERY INTERESTING! It copied what was supposed to be myself but instead brought a different me from a different universe HATCHITE! We went to see Gabbro and they were hilariously confused. Gabbro convinced us to go back to the village (mainly to see if Gossan had a heart attack) and they pretty much did. Sadly the sun exploded soon after but it was a great moment. Bonus it got my mind off Feldspar.\nLog #6\nI went back to Brittle Hollow and had a nice chat with Riebeck they warned me not to fall in the black hole (rolled my eyes at that slightly embarrassed) anyway I got to try out the translator Hal and I made IT WORKED! I got to look at what the Nomai writing actually said IT WAS SO COOL! I radioed Hal to tell them (I\u2019ll save you the gross details of that conversation)\nLog #6\nTHE JERKFACE FELDSPAR RADIOED GABBRO! Trying to cheer them up I took them out exploring and we found something. A UNIDENTIFIED ASTRAL BODY! Well technically it was a spaceship not a planet or something BUT STILL! We looked around and there was a whole ecosystem inside. We made plans to explore it during the next loop.\nLog #7\nThe loop reset itself and somehow Hal got pulled in with us. Poor dude he was so confused while I chatted with Gabbro trying to understand what had happened.\nLog #8\nThis is Hal filling in for Cobble; they are having some\u2026\u2026\u2026issues to say the least. Anyway for whatever reason Cobble is insane right now and I have a few theories why\u2026..\nLog #9\nGABBRO IS THE CURE TO ALL! This is still Hal hopefully for the last time. Gabbro went into where they are keeping Cobble and somehow fixed it I don\u2019t know I\u2019ll never understand romance.\nLog #10\nGabbro and I are fixing this. We are racing through Dark Bramble and making a new universe like my strange memories did.\n*small chuckle* sorry Hornfels,\nLog #11\nIT DIDN\u2019T WORK GABBRO AND I STILL WOKE UP IN OUR SPOTS. But somehow it still worked. There are no more loops, we are just still in our universe.\nLog #12\nGabs and I finally got to explore the stranger. We found new writing and collected a sample for Hal and Hornfels\nLog #13\nThe younger hatchlings asked us for the story hopefully we don\u2019t convince them we have brain damage",

        "comment": "Sophie stepped out of the shadows. She had been watching Keefe from behind one of the trees in the gnomish grove.\n\u201cFoster?!\u201d Keefe said, startled. He had been drawing, sitting on the roots on a nearby tree.\n\u201cHi.. .Hi Keefe.\u201d Sophie said nervously. She had paced around her room for what had to be hours trying to figure out how to admit to Keefe that she had started liking him more than a friend.\nSophie walked over to sit next to him, but tripped on a root closeby leading Keefe to jump up and grab her before she hit her face flat on the hard dirt.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Keefe's obvious concern flooded his voice.\n\u201cN\u2026.no, thanks though.\u201d Sophie could feel her face slowly turning red.\n\u201cGood to see not everything changed while I was gone.\u201d He said mush more cheerful than he had been for the past few days since he came back.\nSophie just nodded as he stood up. The green notebook had fallen off his lap, the one he described as \u201cthe hard stuff\u201d, the page that it had fallen on was Sophie\u2019s first cognate practice with Fitz. It had opened on this page before, the moment Sophie had tried to get Keefe\u2019s feelings out by being sneaky and not admitting her own.\nKeefe hadn\u2019t noticed and just asked her if she wanted to take a walk. When she nodded he grabbed her hand Sophie\u2019s face burned as bright as the sun as she felt his warm hand against hers. Keefe led her to a beautiful part of the grove, shimmering lights coming from the plants around them.\n\u201cWow..\u201d Sophie said awestruck.\n\u201cDid you know this was here?\u201d\n\u201cNo but Flori mentioned it. She was trying to get Sandor to bring Griezel here for a date, since it's so romantic.\u201d She didn\u2019t realize her slip until she saw Keefe\u2019s face turning red.\n\u201cI am glad I got to come here with you.\u201d Sophie added maybe a little a little too quickly.\nShe knew she had to get it out before anymore embarrassment or clumsiness stopped her.\nSo she took a deep breath and started, \u201cI know you said you got over a lot of things when you left. And maybe that includes what you told me in your note. But I just started to realize how much I care about you, and it makes me sad if it is true. That you don\u2019t like me in that way anymore. Because it means I missed my chance to be with this really awesome guy that makes me laugh, and doesn't care if I make a few mistakes. And it's fine I don\u2019t want to guilt you into liking me again, I just needed to tell you.\u201d\nShe\u2019s done it and it was terrifying. But also so relieving.\n\u201cSophie.\u201d Keefe said as her gaze met his, \u201cYou do realize that this could get very messy.\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m unmatchable?\u201d\n\u201cNo, the Council can feed their lists to the gorgodon for all I care. But I wasn\u2019t lying when I told you that my mom could use anything I care about, or anyone I care about, to get to me.\u201d\n\u201cI know, but I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m already on your mom's list of targets, plus I\u2019m ready for her.\u201d She removed her hand from Keefe\u2019s and reached back to pat Hope\u2019s holster, but Keefe grabbed her hand back before she could touch it and cradled it in his.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid.. . that might not be enough.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make it enough. But if you think that's the only reason.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not. Do you want me to list off all the complications?\u201d\nSophie shook her head, \u201cAll I care about is how you feel, if you\u2019re only doing this,\u201d She gestured toward their hands which had been intertwined again, \u201c because you don\u2019t want to hurt my feelings\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTrust me this is all I\u2019ve wanted since I first saw you wandering the halls in the middle of session. I knew right then I had met someone incredibly special and that has proven to be true every moment I spend with you.\u201d\nSophie didn\u2019t know how to respond, her mind filled with too many promises, confessions, and complications. That didn\u2019t seem like enough and like too much. So she lifted her head tilting her toes up to line her lips with his. Leaving a tiny wisp of space, a small chance for him to change his mind. Keefe closed the distance between them and everything became new. The soft press of their lips, to the way their breaths seemed to fall perfectly in sync. He pulled away after what felt like too long yet too short. Leaning back to study her.\n\u201cNo regrets right?\u201d He asked somehow, filled with awe and worry.\n\u201cAbsolutely none.\u201d She said smiling, his relieved smile was the cutest and sweetest thing she had ever seen, but it faded a little as he said.\n\u201cI can\u2019t mess this up, don\u2019t let me mess this up.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d She assured him as she tilted up to steal one more quick kiss.",

Get the help you need!",
        "comment": "Biana came home crying not that anyone would notice. Her father Alden was working with Fitz on something and her mother Della was too busy spying on her father for the Council. No one really cared about Biana. When she came to them they told her to go away. Fitz would call her a crybaby. Alden would pay her no mind. And Della would do the worst. She would chat with Biana but never really listened to her.\nShe ran up to her room. Another person, another one! Revealed that they only wanted to be friends with Biana because she was related to Fitz.\n\u201cI\u2019m not worth anything.\u201d A voice inside her head whispered. \u201cNo one would want to be with me.\u201d\nBiana pressed her head against her pillow trying to silence the voice.\n\u201cI\u2019m not beautiful. I\u2019m a mistake.\u201d\nBiana screamed and threw her heels into the wall.\n\u201cNo matter how hard you try, no one will love you or care for you.\u201d The voice continued to answer. Biana jumped up and ran. She ran outside of the house and ran laps around it. Running had been the only thing that stopped the voices. Leaving her too exhausted to think.\nShe walked back inside. She went to the pantry and grabbed some Prattles. No one invited her down for dinner as per usual. Biana walked to her room and just munched on Prattles. She set the box down on her nightstand and got started on changing. She threw off her sweaty uniform and pulled on a plain black tunic and her softest gray leggings. She skipped her shower and just got into bed. Tears leaked back down her face. She heard the rest of her family eating dinner and no one remembered the youngest Vacker.\n\u201cThey will never love you.\u201d The voice crept back in.\nBiana woke and groaned. It was Saturday she was stuck in Everglen. She didn\u2019t have any friends besides the ones who just wanted a look at her brother. She pulled on a teal tunic with flower embroidery and kept her gray leggins on. She didn\u2019t bother to do her hair.\n\u201cMorning sweetie!\u201d Della sang.\nBiana shrugged and made herself a breakfast salad. Fitz walked down and said nothing to Biana. He just grabbed a single piece of fruit then leaped away. Alden came down next but again said nothing to Biana, grabbed a single piece of fruit and went back to his office.\nBiana started hearing the voice again, \u201cYou\u2019re worthless. You're ugly.\u201d Biana pressed her hands to her ears and dropped the knife she was using to cut the fruit. Della pid it no mind. Biana crouched down and grabbed the knife. She finished making her salad and sat down. Della had already left. She ate alone again.\n\u201cNo matter what you do you\u2019ll always be worthless.\u201d The voice said.\nBiana let herself cry. No one would care, they never did.\nShe put her dish in the sink and went to her favorite spot. She grabbed her book and her running shoes and went to a blooming purple tree. She sat beneath it and started to read. When the voice stirred she pulled on her shoes and ran. She ran a total of 30 laps that day trying to avoid the voice it still crept in.\n\u201cWhy hide it when you know you're a mistake?\u201d The voice whispered. She ran inside, grabbed some mallowmelt and ran to her room. She ate slowly at the slices, tears streaming down her face. The voice was relentless. When she finished her last slice she ripped off her tunic and leggings and turned on the shower. She looked into the mirror as the water heated up. The girl looking back at her had tear stained cheeks, her teal eyes looked slightly bloodshot. Her dark bags under her eyes could rival Edaline\u2019s. And her chocolate brown hair was tangled. She stepped under the colorful spray of water and tried so hard to think good things about herself but the voice always won.\nBiana got into bed once she was done with her shower and layed down. The glittering stars hanging from her canopy glittered a teal light. It was supposed to be calming but it just reminded her about her \u2018perfect\u2019 family and unrealistic expectations.\n\u201cYou're worthless. You're a mistake. No one will love you!\u201d The voice shouted.\nBiana jumped out of bed ready to run again but instead she walked over to her desk and grabbed her imparter. She let out a shaky breath and hailed Elwin.\n\u201cHi Biana.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat did you need?\u201d\nBiana\u2019s tears spilled over as she told him about the voice and how neglected she\u2019d been feeling,\n\u201cHave you told your parents?\u201d He asked, turning away to wipe his own tears.\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried.. . but Della doesn\u2019t listen and Alsen and Fitz don\u2019t talk to me.\u201d She said as tears doubled over.\n\u201cLeap to Foxfire now.\u201d Elwin said before he turned off the imparter.\nBiana walked to the Leapmaster, 10,000, shouted, \u201cFoxfire!\u201d Then walked onto campus grounds. Elwin was waiting in the healing center.\n\u201cElwin.\u201d She said.\n\u201cAh, Biana, come here.\u201d Elwin replied.\nBiana did so.\n\u201cWhat you told me matches with symptoms of severe depression so I whipped up something that should help a little.\u201d He said as he placed a small container into Biana\u2019s hand.\nBiana\u2019s voice failed so she walked over and wrapped Elwin in a hug.\n\u201cT.. . . Thank you.\u201d She managed to get out.\nElwin hugged back and said it was nothing. But he didn\u2019t know how much it meant to Biana. She had been neglected and alone for most of her life and the fact that someone cared was something huge.",

Sometimes with Luz she would just remain silent or wave.\n\u201cSo I had a question.\u201d Amity started.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Luz asked,\n\u201cWhy did you want to cut your hair so bad?\u201d\nLuz bit her lip and looked down at her hands with those obscure magenta eyes Amity had gotten lost in many times.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me I was just curious.\u201d\n\u201cI want to tell you I just- d- I don\u2019t know how.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve found it\u2019s best just to blurt it out. No beating around the bush.\u201d\nLuz chuckled and Amity felt her face warm.\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m- it\u2019s- I\u2019m a grimwalker.\u201d She choked out barely above a whisper.\n\u201cOh Titan.\u201d Amity cursed, \u201cThat\u2019s a copy of a dead person right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, how did you know?\u201d\n\u201cI may or may not have read a few things while working at the library.\u201d\nLuz giggled a little but her smile faded.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\nAmity smiled, and mimed zipping her lips shut.\n\u201cSo what does that have to do with your hair?\u201d Amity asked,\n\u201cThe girl I\u2019m a copy of had the exact same length of hair as I did before I cut it after escaping the Empress\u2019s mind.\u201d\n\u201cSo when it was growing out again it triggered you.\u201d Amity guessed.\n\u201cRight.\u201d Luz confirmed, \u201cSpeaking of hair when I first met you, you had green hair. Why the change?\u201d\n\u201cOh, green is what Odalia prefered since she was trying to make me her little doll.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s abomination colored right?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re hair now, it\u2019s abomination colored.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, only my dad has caught that. How did you?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Luz started getting flustered, \u201cWell you\u2019re an abomination witch, abominations, purple, it just fit.\u201d\nAmity laughed and Luz\u2019s face went red and she cracked a rare smile.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so brave.\u201d Amity whispered.\n\u201cHow so.\u201d Luz said, genuinely confused.\n\u201cWell, you were in the Empress\u2019s mind, found out all of this stuff and still kept fighting. Not to mention how amazing you were at fighting and at being the Silver Soldier. Then I\u2019m just some doll, and a constant disappointment.\u201d\n\u201cWHAT!? NO! You\u2019re not a disappointment and you\u2019re not a doll! You\u2019re so pretty and cool and classy and I can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t realize that! You\u2019re amazing Amity and I-\u201d Luz cut herself off before she could finish that sentence. Her face went livid and she slapped her hand over her mouth. Amity\u2019s face went tomato mode and hope filled her eyes. Luz ran out of the room.\n\u2014-----\nLuz loved Amity, it was really easy to tell. She always stumbled on her words when she was around and could never stop thinking about a certain cotton candy haired goddess. She would do anything for Amity. But she wasn\u2019t prepared to accidentally blurt out her feelings to her.\n\u201cHOLD ON! YOU DID WHAT!\u201d Hunter yelled in shock.\n\u201cI accidentally confessed to Amity, and now she\u2019s going to hate me!\u201d Luz replied.\n\u201cIT\u2019S ABOUT TIME!\u201d Hunter practically screamed.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get it Hunter, she\u2019s going to hate me.\u201d Luz cried burying her face in pillows.\n\u201cLuz, Amity isn\u2019t going to hate you.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know!\u201d\n\u201cLuz tell me how did she react after you said all those things?\u201d\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m not good at reading people Hunter.\u201d\n\u201cJust tell me what was the look in her eyes?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to laugh.\u201d\n\u201cTry me.\u201d\n\u201cShe looked\u2026.. .. \u2026. .. . Hopeful.\u201d\nHunter looked victorious as he left Luz\u2019s room. Luz heard a few small knocks on her open door. When she looked up she saw Amity hiding behind an Azura book.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything I understand if you hate me-\u201d Amity started.\n\u201cWAIT YOU THOUGHT I WOULD HATE YOU!\u201d Luz cried,\n\u201cYES!?\u201d\n\u201cI THOUGHT YOU WOULD HATE ME!\u201d\n\u201cWHY WOULD I HATE YOU?!\u201d\n\u201cI DON\u2019T KNOW?!!\u201d\nThey stared at each other and laughed.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Luz asked, gesturing to the Azura book in her hands.\n\u201cOh, they just published Azura book 6, I thought I could use it as a peace offering.\u201d\n\u201cTHEY PUBLISHED AZURA BOOK 6!\u201d Luz screamed happily.\n\u201cYEAH!\u201d Amity also cried happily.\n\u201cDo you want to read it together?\u201d Luz asked, shyly.\n\u201cI\u2019d love to, but first,\u201d Amity\u2019s face turned pink, \u201cdid you mean all those things you said earlier?\u201d\nLuz\u2019s face went supernova as she nodded, \u201cI- I really think you're pretty and you\u2019re so much braver than I am. I mean you stood up to your awful m-\u201d\nLuz was cut off by Amity\u2019s lips pressing against hers. Luz was shocked at first but melted into it, she lifted her hand to cup Amity\u2019s chin. Amity broke the kiss looking shocked at herself and fearful.\n\u201cOh, crikey.\u201d Luz breathed,\n\u201cI cannot believe I just did that.\u201d Amity mumbled eyes still wide.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I just said that! \u2018Oh crikey,\u2019 how did I even think that!\u201d\nAmity smiled and pressed her lips against Luz\u2019s cheek, \u201cI dunno I kind of liked it.\u201d\nLuz looked over at Amity grinning, \u201cAlright then, shall we read Azura?\u201d\n\u201cYes we shall.\u201d Amity giggled and they cuddled together on Luz\u2019s bed and read Azura. Ghost and Stringbean curled up in their owners laps.\n\u201cDo you want to be my girlfriend?\u201d Luz blurted,\n\u201cYES!\u201d Amity practically screamed.\nThey grinned and their lips pressed together again to seal the deal.",

        "comment": "\u201cFoster? Foster?\u201d Keefe whispered straight into her ear.\n\u201cMmwhatdoUwaaanT.\u201d Sophie said clearly still wanting to sleep.\nShe had set up outside under the Panakes tree again but she wasn\u2019t expecting a certain blond boy to wake her up.\nKeefe started tickling her and she snapped awake and gripped his wrist.\nHe smirked, \u201cYou look cute when you're angry.\u201d\nShe blushed, \u201cShut up, tell me why you had to wake me up.\u201d\n\u201cCan you blame a guy for wanting to bother a certain girl?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the real reason. Tell me.\u201d\n\u201cFine I just wanted to see you.. \u2026 .and I want human snacks.\u201d\nSophie groaned, \u201cFine but it\u2019s coming out of your birth-fund.\u201d\nKeefe jumped to his feet and clapped his hands excitedly. Honestly Sophie had to blush. It was adorable.\n\u2014-\nSo now they were standing outside of a Walmart after Sophie had teleported them. They had picked up Dex just so they could get human money but he went home straight after.\nKeefe did a double-take between the store and Sophie. When Sophie nodded he practically bolted inside. Sophie walked in after him and grabbed a shopping cart. Keefe was already in the snack aisle when Sophie walked into it. He was looking at pretty much every label on the snacks and practically screamed in delight when he saw some packs of E.L Fudges.\n\u201cGrab them, if you want them.\u201d Sophe said through a yawn.\nHe didn\u2019t just grab one he grabbed ten. Sophie face-palmed and grabbed a bucket of cheese-puffs. Keefe grabbed: three different types of goldfish, eight fudge stripes (only because of the elf on the packaging), four packs of chips-ahoy, and six packs of circus animals. Whereas Sophie grabbed: four oreo packs, a pack of Hostess cupcakes, and a bag of pretzels.\nThey went to the self-checkout (mainly to avoid questions about where their parents were) and started scanning. Keefe insisted on scanning the E.L Fudges but gave up after the tenth try. Sophie gave him a sympathetic smile and scanned the barcode. Keefe\u2019s jaw dropped as she got through all the snacks (and some Snickers from the shelf next to the self-checkout) in less than twenty seconds.\nThey leaped back to Havenfield as soon as they were out of sight.\n\u2014--\nThey sat underneath the Panakes tree and Keefe immediately dove into the E.L Fudges.\n\u201cSave some. You're going to want more later.\u201d Sophie warned as she opened a cupcake.\nIt was nothing compared to mallowmelt but it was still delicious. The cream center was slightly questionable after all this time without snacks like this but she still ate it.\n\u201cYou know, I never thought I\u2019d eat human snacks under a Panakes tree. What about you?\u201d Keefe said after six cookies.\n\u201cDefinitely not.\u201d\n\u201cIf I had thought about it I\u2019d be very happy though.\u201d\nSophie laughed, \u201cYeah me too.\u201d\nShe opened the bucket of cheese-puffs next. The cheese powder stuck to her fingers after just brushing the puffs.\n\u201cWhat are those?\u201d Keefe asked, pointing to the cheese-puffs.\nShe laughed again, \u201cCheese-puffs, want some?\u201d\nAs if he needed an invitation he had already stuffed seven into his mouth at a time. They opened the Chips-Ahoy next.\n\u201cThese are pretty dry aren\u2019t they?\u201d Keefe said,\n\u201cDefinitely, but I think it\u2019s just a human cookie thing.\u201d\nOreos came next. Again they were kinda dry but the cream definitely helped. Sophie definitely saw Grady and Edaline looking out the windows a few times. Parents.\n\u201cThis is the best thing I\u2019ve put in my mouth.\u201d Keefe said after stuffing a cupcake into his mouth.\n\u201cI doubt it\u2019s the \u2018best thing\u2019 but they are pretty good.\u201d\nThe fudge stripes, according to Keefe, \u201cwere just knock-off E.L Fudges.\u201d Sophie had tried to explain that they were made by the same people but he didn\u2019t listen. At this point everything had been opened and several wrappers and snacks littered the grass.\nSophie shoved some pretzels into her mouth as Keefe fidgeted with a Snickers bar.\n\u201cYou know, I think this might be the best night ever.\u201d\n\u201cIt has been pretty awesome.\u201d Sophie agreed.\n\u201cI mean human snacks and Sophie Foster, how could it get better?\u201d\nNow Sophie was blushing. The light from the moon illuminated the blush too.\nSophie yawned. Keefe brushed some cheese dust off the corner of her mouth.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d have a good night without you.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t give me all the credit. You're the one who forced me to take you to Walmart.\u201d\n\u201cI still don\u2019t get why they call it Wall art.\u201d\n\u201cWalmart, Keefe and you're changing the subject.\u201d\nKeefe laughed and looked straight into her eyes, \u201cEven if I hadn't woken you up it would've been awesome since I got to see you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so cheesy!\u201d\n\u201cNot as cheesy as these things.\u201d Keefe gestured to the now mostly empty bucket of cheese-puffs.\nSophie threw a pretzel at him and it got stuck in his hair.\n\u201cYou want to start a snack war Foster?\u201d He said arming himself with the Snickers bar held out like a sword.\nThey laughed it off. They looked at each other and pressed their lips together. Keefe\u2019s lips moved from her mouth to the spot between her neck and ear. Sophie moaned elation filling her. Their lips met again and Sophie pulled them closer together, wrapping her arms around him. Keefe added a delicate nibble to her lower lip. She shivered in a good way and let it keep going. Dang she\u2019d never stop loving him. They broke apart.\n\u201cHow about that snack war?\u201d Sohe asked. Tossing another pretzel into his hair.\nKeefe grinned, \u201cOh it is so on!\u201d\nSnacks flew for around ten minutes. Neither of them remembered falling asleep under the tree, but they did. Neither wanted the night to be over. But even the best things come to a close. That doesn't stop anyone from wondering how they can make one night last forever.",

        "comment": "Tonight was Sophie\u2019s Winnowing Gala. She let out a deep breath and got ready. For her gown she chose an ice blue one with lace but not too many frills. The sparkles and swirls along the bodice were beautiful. And it wasn\u2019t a problem that the gown was her latest favorite color. She had Vertina walk her through makeup and a simple updo tying her hair back with ice blue ribbon. She also spritzed some of her Panakes perfume on. Before she walked out the door she studied her first list, dragging her fingers along name one. Then she walked out the door and into the pasture Grady and Edaline had set up for parties.\nShe met up with her adoptive parents and saw the proud grins on their faces. It had been months since they had beat the Neverseen but they never stopped being proud.\n\u201cYou ready kiddo?\u201d Grady asked, looking like he really wanted to cancel and send her to her room, not ready to let her grow up.\nSophie sighed, \u201cAs ready as I\u2019m going to get.\u201d\nEdaline just gave her a squeezing comforting hug then she went onto the dance floor. She looked around for him, and when she spotted him her heart melted. Keefe was dressed in a brown jerkin with gold leaf patterns. Their eyes met and Keefe walked toward her.\n\u201cWell Foster, may I have this dance.\u201d He said with a smirk.\n\u201cYou may.\u201d She decided to play along.\nAs she danced with Keefe she could feel Fitz, her number 11, staring, or maybe glaring would\u2019ve been a better word, at them.\nSophie sighed, \u201cHe always does that when we're together.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Keefe said,\u201dbut don\u2019t let him get to you.\u201d\nThe two continued to dance, stopping only to get some food. They grabbed some cake and when no one was watching they ran up to the pasture with Calla\u2019s Panakes tree. They sat, backs against the smooth braided bark of the tree.\n\u201cWell you sure know how to party, Foster.\u201d Keefe said with a wink.\n\u201cUrg I hate this I only went through with it so Grady wouldn\u2019t kick you out the moment you step foot at Havenfield.\u201d Sophie muttered.\n\u201cHa! He can try, I'm not leaving my girlfriend for that long.\u201d\nSophie gasped and blushed. They\u2019d been dating for months but they hadn\u2019t really used those titles yet. And they weren't just dating because of matchmaking, though that was a welcome bonus considering Keefe was her number one and she was his number one.\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Keefe said, after she stayed quiet.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s just\u2026.um..\u201d\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t expecting me to use the word were you?\u201d Keefe said after Sophie stopped.\nShe blew out a breath, \u201cYeah, I mean it\u2019s not unexpected but\u2026.I didn\u2019t expect it.\u201d\n\u201cI know, I can feel it.\u201d\nSophie sat up and looked straight at Keefe, \u201cIs this a recent thing or\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean I\u2019ve felt flickers for a few days but. Flickers aren\u2019t normal.\u201d\n\u201cKEEFE! Why didn\u2019t you tell me!?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it still wasn\u2019t normal, like I said they were just flickers.\u201d\n\u201cHmm you have a point. But as penance I\u2019m making you a shirt that says \u2018Brown eyed elves give me all the feels.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cHa! Smooth.\u201d Keefe laughed.\n\u201cI learned from the best.\u201d She told him with a playful shove.\nKeefe hadn\u2019t had his empathy back to normal in months. He\u2019d been trying so hard to get it back up and now it just suddenly does?...\n\u201cHow do you think it started?\u201d Sophie asked as they turned their play fight to snuggling.\nKeefe blew put a breath, \u201cI\u2019m honestly not sure.\u201d\n\u201cWell at least it\u2019s working.\u201d She pointed out.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nThey looked down at the pasture seeing the glowing lights of the party.\n\u201cWhat do we do know?\u201d Sophie asked after a moment of silence.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I do know one thing.\u201d Keefe said\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou're the only person I need.\u201d\nSophie blushed. Then when she thought about it she saw it from Keefe\u2019s perspective. He had to grow up in an awful tower with parents that not only didn\u2019t love him, though Cassius does just burys it, but a mother who was a leader of the Neverseen. While Sophie had grown up in a loving human home, then when she moved to the Lost Cities and amazing adoptive family. Not to mention the biological parents who, once the Neverseen were defeated, came out specifically to help Sophie out of her matchmaking pit.\nShe leaned over and kissed Keefe lightly.\n\u201cWhat was that for.\u201d He asked after she leaned back onto the braided bark.\n\u201cI dunno just felt like I should.\u201d\nHe smiled, \u201cLiar.\u201d\nSophie grinned, \u201cI can\u2019t be good at everything.\u201d\n\u201cMmmhh.\u201d He said they tirned their gaze back to the glowing lights.\nGrady and Edaline had spotted them. Edaline gave mushy grins while Grady, looked like he wanted to grab Sophie and drag her back. But he didn\u2019t which probably had to do with Edaline\u2019s arm in front of him. She rolled her eyes, parents. She thought.\nKeefe gently pushed her chin towards him, \u201cHey, we said we weren't going to hide remember.\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d\nThey both leaned towards each other. Leaving a tiny space. At the same moment they brushed their lips together. Brushing turned everything new. Keefe\u2019s lips went into the nook beyween hers and his hand went up to cup her chin. While Sophie wrapped her arms around his abdomen, brushing along his body. When they broke away they were both smiling. And when they looked down at the party Grady looked desperate to run up there, but Edaline had him pinned.\nThe two laughed and kissed again. This time Keefe went directly for the nook adding a delicate nibble. Sophie embraced it. She tried to dig deeper in enjoying the beautiful moment and never wanting it to be over. Keefe\u2019s hand went up to the side of her head cradling it. Sophie put her arms around his shoulders and neck area bringing them closer. When Keefe pulled away their forheads still connected. Sophie leaned in to the little nook between his head and neck resting there. While Keefe pulled her closer leading them to not even be an inch apart. Their hands entertwined and they sat their. Feeling Calla\u2019s songs in the air and having two teenage alicorns running around them. They soon fell asleep neither breaking apart. And for the moment Sophie didn\u2019t have any worries. She knew Grady was still fighting Edaline to break them up. She knew the possibility of the Neverseen escaping their individual prisons was a possibility. But she just stayed in the moment. Keeping her thoughts here under the Panakes tree where she and her boyfriend were snuggling.\nOne last sentence from both of them at the same time, \u201cI love you.\u201d",
        "writing_prompt": "At her Winnowing Gala, Sophie finds herself caught between the expectations of her adoptive family, the lingering stares of an old flame, and the quiet, unwavering support of Keefe\u2014her number one match and the boy who always seems to know what she needs before she does."

And as soon as he stepped out of the light he was bombarded with human emotions overwhelming his sensitive empathy. Tears took to Keefe\u2019s eyes as he tried to find the quietest corner in the busy human city. He considered leaping home but it was too late. Keefe knew one of Forkle\u2019s cameras had caught him on the few days he stopped leaping for a little while. If he came back his mom would surely hurt Sophie to hurt him again. So he kept forward.\nKeefe did his best to ignore the sharp pain going through his head as the emotions of the humans flooded his mind. He had the hood of the cheap blue hoodie, he hadn\u2019t given back to Fitz when they ran away to the Black Swan, covering his trademark hairstyle and face.\n\u201cKeep walking.\u201d He told himself as a clear new blade of pain shot through his head. The small bag he had brought was blowing slightly in the wind as he walked.\nHe got to his location, a large hotel, rather quickly after a rather hard talk with one of the locals. The longer he didn\u2019t talk the scarier it got. He walked inside to be bombarded with floral decorations.\n\u201cWell, it looks like humans have an even worse obsession than elves.\u201d He said under his breath as he walked up to the desk.\n\u201cHere to get a room.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, does room 405 work?\u201d The woman at the counter asked him.\n\u201cSure.\u201d He pulled out the money he had made when he sold his mother\u2019s jewelry.\nThe lady took the money, eyes wide, and handed him the key. Keefe walked up the stairs trying to shut off his empathy the way Sophie had described how she shut off her enhancing. But it didn't work, the emotions were just as strong. He got to his room and surveyed the area.\n\u201cMore flowers. Fantastic.\u201d He said as he saw how the room was decorated.\nFinally he changed into simple light blue pajamas and got into the bed. The blankets were coarse compared to the gnomish beds he grew up with, and the cushioning was even worse, but most of all it didn\u2019t feel like home. Then he drifted into an uneasy sleep.\nHe was alone, darkness wrapped around him and shortly a flashing light hit the crown on his head. Confusion turned to pain, and pain turned into an intolerable nightmare.\nSleep, his mind whispered, that's what he wanted. But when someone else's mind whispered back, \u201cokay sleep.\u201d His mind closed off into a section of him he didn't recognize.\nKeefe woke up sitting up quickly, sweating severely. His heart was racing as he tried to convince himself, \u201cNightmare. It was just a nightmare.\u201d But he wouldn\u2019t believe it. Mrs. Stinkbottom had fallen to the floor but when he squeezed the stuffed gulon it didn\u2019t help as much as he needed. So he pulled himself out of bed and went to the small bag he had packed, fingering a small metal object the imparter Grady had made him take.\nHe held the object to his mouth and whispered, \u201cShow me Grady Ruewen.\u201d\nGrady\u2019s face appeared seconds later. He looked weary but okay. He soon asked, \u201cWhat's wrong Keefe?\u201d\n\u201cI.. .\u201d He couldn\u2019t find the right words.\nGrady seemed to realize so he went on, giving Keefe updates and assuring him that Sophie was fine. He had just worked up the courage to ask Grady, \u201cHow does she deal with nightmares?\u201d When he heard the front chimes signaling that someone was entering the Havenfeild manor. Grady said a quick goodbye and turned off the impartr leaving Keefe back to the empty room.\nKeefe started deep breaths trying to shake off the nightmare. But it wasn\u2019t a nightmare, and it was no coincidence he had it. This was the first time he had actually slept since leaving the Lost Cities, knowing that the experience in Loamnore would haunt him. The nightmare was a replay of every horrid painful feeling that had occurred.\nSince the nightmare wasn\u2019t going to leave him, Keefe focused on changing. Pulling on the black Batman shirt he had also not given back. Just touching it made him feel better. Remembering how much Foster had cared, how much she helped him. It was like having her back for a few moments. He soon added dark blue jeans and simple black and white tennis shoes. He lingered in the bathroom staring at his reflection. He hadn\u2019t really seen himself since before Loamnore. And he didn\u2019t like what he saw.\nHe looked at the mirror and saw a miserable boy. His hair unstyled and his smirk gone. He remembered teasing Foster about near death experiences and nightmares and he saw a hypocrite. Someone who had gone through the experiences, and still teased her. He also had started having the haunting images of the nightmare in the back of his head. His photographic memory, betraying him.\nHe stared at the reflection and left the room before even touching the hairbrush.\n\u2014-----\nIt was the fourth month in Humanland. Nightmares haunting him every night. He kept trying to block the human emotions but nothing worked. Eventually he just turned numb. He woke up sweating from the nightmare and from the bombardment of emotions and something switched. Something he couldn\u2019t control, something he couldn\u2019t turn back on.\nEventually when he had to get air, he stepped outside. He went to the library where Mr. Wright had died with his daughter. Where his mom had killed them. Nothing triggered. He stopped by a small flower shop, bought small forget-me-nots and walked to the cemetery. He dropped the flowers by the two graves and left. He walked for hours that day trying to find the green door. But it was gone. He went back to the hotel and started drawing in his green journal. He drew the scene he had done that morning, the two graves with the forget-me-nots. He tucked the notebook away, changed into his pajamas and prepared for another horrible night.\nKeefe woke up. It wasn\u2019t the usual waking up sensation, where sweat trickled down his face and his heart raced. Instead it was steady and he heard a knocking at the door. He jumped up and walked towards the door and opened a crack. When he saw the familiar beautiful face and looked into her brown eyes his smirk returned and he soon whispered, \u201cFoster.\u201d\nThen Sophie lunged and tackled-hugged him.\n\u201cUm, not that I\u2019m not happy to see you Foster but how did you find me? Also at some point I\u2019m going to need to breathe.\u201d He had meant the words but just seeing Sophie again was like taking a deep breath for the first time.\n\u201cSorry!\u201d She immediately said letting go of him.\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize!\u201d Keefe told her sternly, \u201cI had a feeling you would strangle me if I saw you again.\u201d\n\u201cYou really weren't planning on coming back. Were you?\u201d She asked, looking sad as she said it.\nKeefe blew out a breath, \u201cI.. .---\u201d\nHe was interrupted by Bangs Boy piping up, \u201cDon\u2019t we have a job to do?\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Sophie said quickly, \u201cSo Tam, do you want him to stand or sit or.. .\u201d\n\u201cHang on Bangs Boy is doing what now??\u201d Keefe interrupted.\nSophie gave him a brief explanation about a shadow ripple thing that Umber had put in his heart. Telling him that, that was how they had found him. Even explaining Vespera\u2019s deal and the strange power source.\n\u201cWow.. .\u201d He said, confused and shocked.\n\u201cSo.\u201d Sophie said turning back to Tam, \u201cShould he sit er?\u201d\n\u201cSitting might be wise.\u201d Tam finally said.\nKeefe sat down on one of the many chairs in his hotel room and stared at Tam, \u201cWhat now?\u201d\nKeefe was answered by Tam\u2019s shadow crawling across the floor to Keefe\u2019s feet.  Tam lifted his hand and then retracted it sharp and hard. Keefe suddenly felt like King Dimitar had, yet again, sliced open a deep gash under his rib cage sharp pain flaring as soon as Tam made the motion. Then a shadow slithered away and Tam lifted it with his power and held it there.\n\u201cDone.\u201d Tam said, sweating.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Sophie asked Keefe. He had started clutching his chest and rubbing the spot with his scar.\n\u201cYeah but that pull was like getting kicked in the ribs.\u201d It was true but it wasn\u2019t even close to the pain that had actually occurred, but Keefe didn\u2019t want to remind Sophie about the sparring match.\n\u201cSorry, I was worried that if I palled for longer it would drag out the pain.\u201d Tam soon said.\n\u201cYeah it probably would have.\u201d Keefe said while shrugging, \u201cThanks.. . um. Huh I can\u2019t think of a non weird way of saying, \u2018thanks for removing the creepy shadow ripple thing from my heart\u2019\u201d\nTam grinned, \u201cYou're welcome.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Dex finally said after a few moments of silence.\nTam was still holding the ripple so Keefe suggested, \u201cHere put it in this way when it goes out with the garbage, if it still somehow works, it will lead my mom to a pile of trash.\u201d He said tossing Tam an empty plastic water bottle.\nSophie smiled but it looked a bit forced.\n\u201cFoster this power source you told me about. We HAVE to destroy it. I don\u2019t care if it's going to help me, we need to make sure my mom can never get her hands on it.\u201d\nSophie nodded, but Keefe knew that wasn\u2019t enough. He stood up and went to the bedroom section of his room.\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Sophie called.\n\u201cTo get my stuff I\u2019m coming with you!\u201d",

        "comment": "Sophie sat in the rain. No umbrella in sight. When she looked up she saw her older sister, Jolie, offering her an umbrella, smiling, Amy is behind her. Sophie takes it gladly but doesn't smile. It's hard to smile when you're in pain.\n\u2014--------\nSophie and Amy were adopted by Grady and Edaline, two rich parents who loved them as if they were their own flesh and blood. Jolie was biologically related to their parents and was 17 whereas Sophie was 15 and Amy was 12.\n\u201cSophie, it's time for school!\u201d Edaline called from downstairs.\nSophie groaned High School sucked.\n\u201cSophie, it won't be that bad.\u201d Edaline said gently, shaking her shoulder when she came in.\nShe gave Edaline a dubious look and joined Jolie at the table.\n\u201cC\u2019mon Soph it can\u2019t be worse than yesterday.\u201d Jolie said sweetly.\n\u201cThen you and I have different definitions of \u2018worse.\u2019\u201d Sophie said,\nAmy came downstairs shortly after and immediately grabbed four fresh butterblasts.\n\u201cSave some for the rest of us Me-me.\u201d Jolie said, playfully shoving Amy.\n\u201cIf you want some, grab some.\u201d Amy shot back.\nSophie laughed and grabbed four of her own.\n\u201cWell I guess I\u2019m outnumbered.\u201d Jolie laughed and grabbed the last four.\nAmy left with Edaline to go to school soon after, Jolie and Sophie left for the bus stop minutes later.\n\u201cSoph about last night-\u201d Jolie started.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d Sophie interrupted.\n\u201cWhat did they do?\u201d Jolie asked.\nSophie sighed, \u201cThey said it was my fault that Amy\u2019s and mine parents died.\u201d\nJolie stopped and glared, \u201cWhy.\u201d\nSophie shrugged, \u201cThey're just jerks, I'm over it.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t lie to me Sophie.\u201d\nThe bus showed up that moment and Sophie practically bolted to her seat next to Marella and Dex.\n\u201cHi Sophie!\u201d Dex said a little too loudly.\n\u201cMorning Dex, Marella.\u201d Sophie said.\nMarella nodded. She was a quiet pixie-like girl. Whereas Dex was loud and fairly tall. Sophie was kind of the middle person, not loud but not quiet, not tall but not short.\nFitz and his Football friends chatted loudly in the back seat. Dex rolled his eyes, mumbling \u201cWonderboy\u201d under his breath. Marella had similar sentiments but Sophie was indifferent. He was a boy, there wasn\u2019t anything especially annoying about him unlike Keefe Sencen. Sophie had never met him but all the teachers said he was trouble, so she did her best to avoid him.\nThey got off the bus quickly and Sophie practically ran to her locker; she was too late. She had known since the year started that Keefe Sencen\u2019s locker was right next to hers. But normally she can beat him there today was different. And for extra joy she lost her schedule, so she had no clue where she was going. She started toying with the lock as Keefe kinda watched her.\n\u201cWhat do you want!\u201d Sophie said after five minutes.\nKeefe jumped back a few steps startled. Before he could reply Stina walked behind Sophie and knocked everything Sophie was carrying onto the ground.\nStina cackled, \u201cSophie Foster you cluts how could you drop everything?\u201d\nSophie blushed; embarrassed. And started picking up her stuff, only for it to be knocked out of her hands again.\n\u201cWhat the heck!\u201d Sophie heard Keefe shout.\nStina looked shocked, \u201cIt was her clumsiness not me.\u201d She protested.\nSophie kept her head down.\n\u201cAre you brain dead? I watched you knock her stuff. What is wrong with you?\u201d Keefe continued.\nStina rolled her eyes and signaled for her minions to follow her, \u201cI\u2019m putting her in her place Sencen and worry about yourself.\u201d Then she walked away.\nSophie worked on picking her stuff up again but all of it was collected and being handed to her by Keefe.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Keefe asked when Sophie didn\u2019t take the things Stina had knocked out of her hands.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the ulterior motive!\u201d She snapped.\nKeefe looked confused, \u201cUm there is none, just take your stuff.\u201d\nSophie blushed and grabbed her things but as she turned to walk away she heard him call, \u201cIf you want to know the motive here it is: Stina was bothering you so I tried to help!\u201d\nShe turned around fuming, \u201cLeave me alone I don\u2019t need another Stina.\u201d\n\u201cDid I or did I not stop Stina?\u201d\n\u201cOh please I know what you do; you're the prankster, the one who\u2019s always in detention.\u201d\nKeefe looked hurt, \u201cI really was just trying to help.\u201d He said.\nSophie sighed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry most people don\u2019t like me so I just expect it.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do people not like you?\u201d\nSophie shrugged, \u201cYou're guess is as good as mine.\u201d\n\u201cI noticed you lost your schedule.\u201d Keefe noted changing the subject.\n\u201cYeah, what\u2019s it to you?\u201d\nHe smirked, \u201cElwin has all of the students' schedules, so he knows where you're going after you visit him.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know my way to his office.\u201d She mumbled.\n\u201cThat\u2019s an easy fix, follow me.\u201d\nAnd surprisingly she did.\n\u201cHere we are!\u201d Keefe announced as he opened the door.\nElwin looked up from his desk and laughed, \u201cThat explains the dramatic entry, what do you two need.\u201d\n\u201cI lost my schedule.\u201d Sophie mumbled.\n\u201cAnd you Keefe.\u201d\n\u201cJust helping out a fellow student.\u201d\nIn no time Sophie had her schedule and she found herself wanting to be near Keefe. When he started walking to his class she ran to catch up.\n\u201cLet\u2019s compare schedules.\u201d She suggested. And Keefe looked relieved and happy as they did so.\nAnd they found that most of their classes were the same.\n\u201cThis way Foster on to Chemistry!\u201d Keefe declared.\nSophie laughed and blushed as she took his hand.\nThey spent the whole walk talking, exchanging phone numbers, telling jokes, and just overall being friends. When they got to Chemistry Sophie groaned, \u201cI\u2019m terrible at Chemistry.\u201d\nKeefe laughed, \u201cJust do whatever Dex does, that's my strategy.\u201d\n\u201cYou know Dex?\u201d\n\u201cNot personally but he\u2019s the Chemistry wizard.\u201d\n\u201cAhem!\u201d Mrs. Galvin said loudly, \u201cUnless you would like to share with the class, sit down.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should we? We can learn just as well standing!\u201d Keefe countered.\n\u201cThat\u2019s another week of detention Mr. Sencen and one for you to Miss Foster.\u201d Mrs. Galvin declared.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Foster-Ruewen.\u201d Sophie said, annoyed.\n\u201cAnother week Miss Foster.\u201d Mrs. Galvin said again.\n\u201cNo seriously, my last name is Foster-Ruewen!\u201d\n\u201cFoster-Ruewen, it is now time to sit down and stop telling fairy tales.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m adopted my original last name was Foster, but now because of my adoptive parents it\u2019s Foster-Ruewen!\u201d Sophie tried to explain.\nMrs. Galvin just sighed, and Sophie sat down defeatedly.\n\u201cNice argument.\u201d Keefe whispered.\n\u201cI was just trying to fix my name. What's so wrong with that?\u201d She whispered back.\n\u201cEverything is bad with Mrs. Galvin.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Sencen and Miss Foster Principle Alina\u2019s office now!\u201d Mrs. Galvin shouted.\nSophie\u2019s eye twitched and as she and Keefe walked out she yelled, \u201cMy last name is Foster-Ruewen.\u201d\nThey didn\u2019t go to the principal's office, instead they ditched until their next class.\n\u201cTwo days a week with her is going to be a nightmare!\u201d Sophie groaned.\n\u201cI know right she\u2019s evil.\u201d Keefe said laughing.\nSophie groaned again.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you're adopted.\u201d Keefe said after a moment of silence.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s not the first thing I tell people.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cBoth my parents died in an accident and my little sister and I were adopted by the Ruewen\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cOh, wow.\u201d\n\u201cYup.\u201d Sophie said, trying to end the conversation and kicking the wall.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Keefe said.\n\u201cIt happened a few years ago, it's fine.\u201d\n\u201cTime doesn't make it better or worse.\u201d Keefe argued.\nSophie had ignored him at this point and focused on counting the bricks in the wall.\n\u201cFoster? Ffffffoooooossssssttttteeeeerrrrrr!?\u201d Keefe said right in her ear.\n\u201cGah! Keefe what!\u201d Sophie said, rubbing her ear.\nKeefe laughed and Sophie did too.\n\u201cJust making sure you were listening.\u201d Keefe said through laughs.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t to have you know.\u201d She said defiantly.\nKeefe just kept laughing.\nThey ended up doing this a lot through their High School years. It brought Sophie\u2019s mood up a lot then their senior year Keefe asked her to Prom.\n\u201cMe? Why me?\u201d Sophie asked after he dropped the question randomly.\n\u201cYou're my best friend and I\u2019d rather be at a dumb party with my friend than be at my house.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d love to, it just shocked me.\u201d\nKeefe grinned, \u201cFantastic I\u2019ll meet you at your place?\u201d\n\u201cYup, but be warned about my dad you should\u2019ve seen him when Brant asked Jolie out.\u201d\nKeefe laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s worth it.\u201d\nHours later Jolie is helping Sophie get ready, Biana along for the ride. Biana and Sophie had become friends when they both made fake excuses to go to the Healing Center instead of PE, one of the few classes she had without Keefe.\n\u201cRed, red is definitely her color.\u201d Biana argued.\n\u201cNo gold it\u2019ll bring out the highlights in her eyes.\u201d Jolie said.\nSophie sat on the bed watching them argue.\n\u201cShe\u2019s going with Keefe red will make her look extra striking.\u201d Biana countered.\n\u201cTheir going as friends gold is the obvious choice, much less bold.\u201d Jolie argued\n\u201cGuys!\u201d Sophie interjected.\nThey both looked at her.\n\u201cWhat if you mix them?\u201d Sophie asked.\nJolie and Biana did a double take between each other and Sophie.\n\u201cLET'S DO IT!\u201d They both yelled.\nJolie and Biana had put together an outfit that consisted of a simple red dress with a gold waistline and cuffs, with red ribbon for her hair glittered with gold sequins, and a gold eyeliner. For shoes they chose red flats with gold bottoms.\n\u201cWow.\u201d Sophie breathed as she looked in the mirror even Jolie\u2019s best friends, Vertina, looked shocked.\nJolie and Biana fist bumped each other. Then the doorbell rang and Sophie sprinted to beat her dad to the door. When she opened it Keefe smiled at her then his jaw dropped as she opened the door fully.\nKeefe was wearing a simple black suit with gold highlights.\nSophie smiled, \u201cHey Keefe.\u201d\n\u201cHi,\u201d he said, still awestruck.\nBefore they could leave Grady gave the \u201cdad talk\u201d for 258 seconds, and yes Sophie counted, to Keefe.\nSophie and Keefe walked to the High School just chatting. Keefe commented multiple times about how Sophie looked.\nWhen they got there Marella was dancing with Linh under the stars, Tam practically stalking them.\nKeefe and Sophie said hello and walked inside.\n\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Sophie asked Keefe.\n\u201cDance obviously Foster.\u201d He said as he dragged her onto the dance floor.\nIt didn't take long before Keefe got her invested in the music and they danced for a while. When the slow started they ran off to the concessions table.\n\u201cHey Foster, do you like anyone like Marella likes Linh?\u201d Keefe asked.\nSophie laughed, \u201cNothing I can think of off the top of my head. You?\u201d She lied.\n\u201cJust one girl that\u2019s the only detail I\u2019m giving.\u201d\n\u201cC\u2019mon Keefe give me one hint.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d\nThen Keefe\u2019s lips pressed against hers. Sophie fully embraced it pulling them closer. Keefe\u2019s lips went into the continent nook between Sophie's, adding a delicate twist. Sophie was the one who pulled away smiling.\n\u201cI lied, I've had a crush on you since you took me to Elwin\u2019s office that first day.\u201d Sophie said as Keefe studied her.\nKeefe laughed, \u201cMe too Foster me too.\u201d\n\u2014------\nYears past and Sophie and Keefe hadn\u2019t seen each other in those years. Sophie had gone to Yale on a full scholarship while Keefe hadn\u2019t gone to school yet.\nSophie was sitting in the small cafe she worked at washing cups. It was a slow day and no one had come in. It was Sophie\u2019s senior year and she smiled at the memories she made while here. Many men tried to pursue her but they were rejected each time. There was only one boy she loved. Even though she hadn\u2019t seen him in years. She was in the back when the door swung open.\n\u201cBe there in a moment.\u201d Sophie called as she set the cup down. \u201cHow may I help you?\u201d Sophie asked as a familiar looking girl stood at the counter.\n\u201cI need a Pumpkin Spice Latte right now.\u201d She said, \u201cAnd make it snappy Sophie Foster.\u201d\n\u201cStina Heks, I thought I recognized you. I\u2019ll get your order right away.\u201d Sophie said.\nBut when Stina grabbed the Latte from Sophie she clutched it too hard on purpose spilling it on the counter and on Stina.\n\u201cAhh look what you\u2019ve done Foster!\u201d Stina screamed.\nBefore Sophie could respond a male voice interjected, \u201cBack to the same stunts are we Stina? Aren't we all adults here?\u201d\nStina snapped around, \u201cOf course you would ruin my fun Sencen.\u201d\nSophie threw off her apron and ran towards Keefe. When she got to him Keefe pulled her into a tight hug.\n\u201cMissed you too Foster.\u201d Keefe said softly.\nApparently Keefe had gotten into Yale for an art major and had started about two years ago.\n\u201cWhy didn't you tell me?\u201d Sophie complained.\n\u201cMissed me badly didn\u2019t you?\u201d Keefe said, smirking.\nSophie blushed, Keefe smirked wider and a universal law was returned.\nThey got married a few years after that.
