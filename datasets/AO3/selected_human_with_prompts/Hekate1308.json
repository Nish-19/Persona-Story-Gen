He could leave, and he would.\nHe just wanted to spend one last evening with Dean, as they had done so often lately.\nThey had been talking about nothing important \u2013 Dean had ben complaining about a blind date his brother had sent him on \u2013 when his \u2013 friend? \u2013 suddenly turned to him and asked, \u201cWhat about you, anyway? No one special on the horizon?\u201d\nAnd he could have told him that he usually got what he wanted, only he couldn\u2019t, because Dean Winchester had been the one thing he had ever had to leave behind.\n\u201cYou were the first\u201c. The words tumbled out of his mouth before he could stop himself.\nDean stared at him. \u201cWhat are you \u2013\u201c\n\u201cAnd the last\u201d he admitted, feeling as defeated as he sounded, because eh had seen what his life would have been like if he had chosen a different path, if he had decided to act back then, he might have been \u2013\nMight have been \u2013 but that was deluding himself, as he very well knew. He was never meant for a straight path in life, and it was good that eh had acted accordingly. He would only have dragged Dean Winchester down in the mud with him, and what then? He would have come to hate him, eventually anyway. His lovers usually did. But in this case, he didn\u2019t think he would have been able to bear it.\nDean looked at him, then shook his head slowly, as if contemplating something.\nThen, \u201cYou really took your time, peaches.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, his confusion only getting stronger when Dean kissed him.\n\u201cYou were no exactly \u2013 no that\u2019s not true\u201d Dean eventually explained. \u201cBut I could always tell it was you. Kept an eye on the news, you see, just out of\u2026 But doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\nHe laughed because there was nothing else to do.\nDean chuckled himself. \u201cI know. Well, now that that\u2019s out in the open, how do we proceed?\u201d\n\u201cWhat \u2013\u201c\n\u201cWhat do we do about this? Because I\u2019m not about to leave my life behind. I\u2019ve got my shop, and my niece and nephew, and Sammy \u2013 Sammy would never let me get away, and man, I can\u2019t imagine what bobby would do, so you have to \u2013\u201c\n\u201cWhat makes you think I would even want \u2013\u201c\nAnd then Dean kissed him. Kissed him like it was nothing, like the years had not passed and eh found himself responding and remembering why he had always been the most exhilarating man he had ever met.\nWhen they broke off, Dean asked, \u201cSo?\u201d\nIt should not have been easy \u2013 or no \u2013 it should have been easy. He should have known exactly what he wanted, ands that it was to leave and continue on his path. Some things were not meant to be, and so he couldn\u2019t just \u2013\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to come up with a plan.\u201d\nDean kissed him again.\nA year later\n\u201cNo, no, of course we understand, Agent \u2013 you\u2019re not the first, just an unfortunate coincidence \u2013\u201c And Dean led the woman out of their house with the practice of someone who did so on a regular basis.\n\u201cThat should be enough visits from the feds for the rest of the year, don\u2019t you think?\u201d he asked, coming into the living room. \u201cAt least until they work their way through the pile yet again.\u201d\n\u201cYou never know\u201d he replied.\nDean shook his head. \u201cWould have been easier if we\u2019d manage to make it look like you were dead \u2013\u201c\n\u201cOh\u201d he brightened up \u201dI am sure \u2013 \u201d\nOne look from his husband made it clear that plan was not going to go anywhere. Apparently they would be stuck handling the agents for quite some time to come.\nNot that he could bring himself to mind too much. Business was booming, even Sam had calmed down somewhat when it came to their, as most people believed it, whirlwind romance, and most importantly, he had Dean.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I could rely use a glass of Craig\u201d he declared.\nThere really was nothing to do but to oblige, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to mind all too much about it.",

Plus, he really had been careful when it came to one-night stands in the past few months, so it was time to scratch that particular itch.\nSadly, it was not to be, because a surprise waited for him today.\n\u201cWe need to talk\u201d Dean announced as quickly as he could \u2013 he had barely had time to sit down. \u201cThis can\u2019t go on. If you receive another shipment from Chicago \u2013 the kind I don\u2019t know anything about and I wouldn\u2019t even admit to under torture \u2013 \u201c\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nDon\u2019t play coy with me Peaches, I am talking about you having to shut down part of your operation at least for the time being.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see \u2013\u201c\n\u201cSomeone blabbed, that\u2019s it, and now people are on alert.\u201d\n\u201cI have always made sure that my employees know that they should be very careful when speaking to others about their jobs.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that worked out great\u201d Deans aid sarcastically, and Crowley resisted the urge to roll his eyes because no one was going to turn him into a petulant five-year-old, not even one of the most enchanting men he had ever met. \u201cSo now you\u2019ve got a private detective after you, and if he uncovers anything \u2013\u201c\n\u201cThere is nothing to uncover\u201d he interrupted him smoothly because well, there ought not to be and he would make sure that \u2013\nAnd then Dean looked at him and he became very aware that this man did indeed know everything. He had no idea how. Yes, he was a lawyer, but Crowley had always made sure that those he\nworked\nwith either only knew of his legal or his illegal activities, and that there never was a cross between them, only that Dean Winchester \u2013\nBut how? It made no sense at all, it was utterly ridiculous \u2013\nAnd then he shook his head. \u201cYou might be careful, but some in your organization are not as loyal as you think. Or no \u2013 I know you \u2013 you enjoy the risk, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nHe was still trying to find an answer when he exploded, \u201cDamn you, Crwoley! You\u2019re smarter than this! One of the reasons I like you so much as a client. I always thought you would never do something to risk your business, both of them, and yet you insist on having people like Simmons on your pay roll who hate your guts \u2013\u201c\n\u201cEveryone hates my guts\u201d he pointed out correctly because he was not about to start lying again now when they were finally honest with open another \u2013 and he himself was, now that he thought about it, honest with anyone for the very first time in \u2013 years? Decades? His life?\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you should play with fire. But of course that\u2019s it \u2013 you grew bored and you wanted to spice things up a bit.\u201d\nNow he was growing uncomfortable, not euclase Dean Winchester continued to berate him, but because he had hit the nail on the head. While he would never have called being on top of things truly boring, things could grow stale after a while, and just a little \u2013\n\u201cAlright we need to clean this up.\u201d\n\u201cWe do?\u201d he asked before he could stop himself.\nDean glared at him-\n\u201cWhat I want to say\u201d he quickly explained \u201cis that I am very capable of \u2013\u201c\n\u201cI know you are but I want to avoid a death toll in the dozens, you know it would only catch someone\u2019s attention, and then we\u2019d be right back at the beginning. Much easier to frame them for something, especially because they have to be guilty of certain things working for you. The trick is not to let on anything about \u2013 well, you know. But let\u2019s see.\u201d\nAnd Dean Winchester, who he until now had considered one of the most law-abiding persons he had ever met (although he would alter admit that he would have thought him still as attractive as he did if that had indeed been the case) settled down to a lengthy discussion about his\u2026 more illegal activities and what they would have to do to make sure Crowley was safe.\nHe would say this.\nHe had most definitely not expected that.\nA year later\n\u201cRansom called from Tulsa, don\u2019t worry, I handled it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, I was busy with the new contracts anyway \u2013\u201c\nHis husband grinned at him. \u201cI\u2019ll look them over later just to make sure.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t quite certain how Dean had taken over the legal side of \u2013 well all sides of his business, but he was not going to complain.\n\u201cAnyway. What\u2019s for dinner?\u201d",

Peter knew that, and it was probably one of the reasons he had chased him down, yes, but also been friendly and professional once he\u2019d got him, and why they were close friends now.\nStill, of course he was wary when it came to Neal. He had not always been on his best behaviour, and he had perhaps realized what he truly wanted, where he belonged, a little too late, but that didn\u2019t mean \u2013 at least he hoped it didn\u2019t \u2013 that he couldn\u2019t work himself back in his good graces.\nAnd then Agent Lane happened, was sent over to White Collar to make sure everything was above board because of course there was talk that Peter didn\u2019t know how to keep a separation between work and his private life and he and Neal were too close \u2013 thankfully not in\nthat\nway because no one could fathom Peter cheating on Elizabeth, not even the biggest of gossips \u2013 but in the whole \u201cwe are family\u201d way which made Neal feel a little bit guilty because \u2013 well \u2013 again, he had not been as much of an asset as he should have Eben considering the conditions under which he\u2019d been released inti Peter\u2019s custody. Still, no one seemed to really care, and then Agent Lane waltzed in with his talks of regulations and how CIs should be treated and that Peter had not filled out the necessary forms, which was deictic because this was Peter Burke they were talking about and\nof course\nhe had submitted all the paperwork he needed to, only that when someone wanted to make someone\u2019s life a living hell they usually found ways to succeed.\nIt was not difficult to tell that Peter had been rather stressed lately.\nAnd now here they were, and a forged van Eyck has just shown up, and Neal could just tell that Lane was trying to trace it back to him, only that \u2013 well \u2013\nIt was rather awkward, considering everything, but he was innocent. He had no idea where this forgery even came from, but nonetheless this man was determined to see it traced back to him and therefore to Peter, and his friend was not even talking to him about this, which seemed to indicate that he at least suspected him \u2013\nNeal knew it shouldn\u2019t have hurt. It did regardless.\nBut even so, even if there was not\u2026 all of this to deal with, he would still have been worried because it just wasn\u2019t normal for them not to speak for a few days not anymore, and he was just as worried as if it had been Mozzie or El or June or Diana or Clinton\u2026\nHe really had developed quite the social circle, he suddenly realized. There had been a time when he had avoided that, if only to make it easier to leave.\nBut that was neither here nor there \u2013 right now, he had other things to deal with.\nAnd so he went to see Peter in his office.\nHe was working away on some files but immediately raised his head. \u201cAh Neal. Anything wrong?\u201d\nThere was no suspicion in his gaze, so he probably didn\u2019t\nreally\nthink he had the painting stashed away somewhere which was an improvement to the beginning of their work relationship, all in all, and Neal sat down and shrugged. \u201cNot really. Just don\u2019t really get along with the new guy, that\u2019s all.\u201d\nPeter grimaced. \u201cHis assessment will only take two more days, or so he tells me. No idea what he hopes to find.\u201d\nHe was about to say something when he sighed and said, \u201cThe truth is \u2013 Neal, you should keep your head down. If guys like this want to find anything, they usually do, and I don\u2019t want to \u2013\u201c\n\u201cSo what if we give him something to chase?\u201d he suggested because he already had a few ideas. After all, they had to figure out a way to do their work, while they could not do efficiently with the guy hanging around, and something like calling in anonymous tips about stolen art was hardly against the law\u2026\n\u201cNeal\u2026\u201d\n\"I won't let you down\" he promised, knowing even as he did so that Peter had no reason to believe him. With everything he had done in the past few years, with how much trouble he\u2019d brought him, there was absolutely no reason to \u2013\nAnd Peter said \u201cFine\u201d and nodded at him and Neal was once more left to marvel at this man who for some reason decided to make him his project.\nTime to call Mozzie.",

After all, that was what he was here for. He was not just tinkering away on old cars in Edinburgh, as his grandfather had done; he was working on a spaceship.\nStill, it was not a welcome surprise when they suddenly found themselves dead in the water \u2013 dead in space, he supposed he should call it.\nThe life support still worked, but other than that, nothing. Which in some way was good news because at least he had time to figure out what was going on without them suffocating in the meantime.\nStill, he knew what he had to do in such a moment as this, so he made his way unto the bridge.\n\u201dScotty, how did this happen?\u201d were the first words out of the captain\u2019s mouth and despite everything, he had to suppress a smiled. The instructors in the academy had always told him he should stay professional because no captain worth a damn would call him by a nickname, but Captain Kirk had proven them wrong right from the start.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know sir, but I am working on it.\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cSpock?\u201d\nMr. Spock, as could be expected for any good scienced officer, had a few theories, but nothing concrete as yet, whereas the good doctor was slightly worried about the crew, as he always was, but rather happy that sickbay was still fully operational, so to speak.\nKirk nodded at him and he returned to the engine room to figure out what was going on.\nIt didn\u2019t take long to learn that actually, everything should have been working perfectly. There really was no reason for it not to, apart from the fact that they were in space and everything was possible, there. He quickly did the math. Wall in all, things were not too bad \u2013 they still had a little over 84-hours until they would all end up dead; they\u2019d had to dela with much less.\nWhat he hadn\u2019t counted on was how it would feel too slowly watch all their theories crumble to dust while absolutely nothing changed. It was just as well thy were blessed with such a Captain as Jim kirk and such a first officer as Mr. Spock, because these two at least kept a cool head. And Doctor McCoy for all that he could start complaining as soon as he woke up in the morning, also knew what to do in such moments as this.\nStill, they had to find something, and soon.\nIt was young Chekov who gave him the idea. \u201cYou know, sir, in Russia, we used to do something called\nschemitsa\n. Bear hunting. It was\u2026 a trap. When a bear tried to get through, it would get stuck and either starve or be killed when the hunters returned.\u201d\nHe nodded more out of politeness but then realized that this might actually make sense. Trapping her in this place, waiting for whoever had laid the trap to come back\u2026\n\u201cSir\u201d he hit the intercom, \u201dI\u2019ll need more scans of the area immediately surrounding the Enterprise. I think there might be something there.\u201d\n\u201cConsider it done, Mr. Scott\u201d the Captains\u2019 voice replied.\nA few minutes later, he had the scans. Yes \u2013 just a small but significant higher concentration of epsilon rays than should have been there. It might not have been much, but it was what he could get, and he would work with it.\n\u201cSir!\u201d he all but shouted through the intercom again. \u201cI Think I\u2019ve got it!\u201d\nIt was a little bit more complicated than just dismantling the set of rays that had been laid out like a bear trap in Chekov\u2019s story, but still, three hours later they were free, and he was rather sure it would make an interesting report for the captain to send in.\nWhen he entered the Bridge, the captain said, \u201cWell done, Mr. Scott.\u201d\n\u201cAye, thank you, Captain. All in a day\u2019s work.\u201d",

Honestly, it\u2019s sort of a nice change of pace, even if he says so himself.\nStill \u2013 there are some things they have to consider because, despite God declaring that love comes from him and as such is a gift to be treasured, there are people who do not agree, who think that some forms of love should not be allowed, that it is sinful when it truly is not, when it really could not be, not like this, when both of them clearly feel the same.\nIt\u2019s rather sad, and he wishes the world were different, despite living in the best possible world, naturally, but still\u2026\n\u201cIt does appear that the inspector is no longer nearly as annoyed with Sid as he used to be\u201d he therefore declares diplomatically, because it\u2019s the closest he can come to actually admitting any of this out loud out of sheer habit, and she gives him a knowing smile.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time to... encourage them wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d\n\u201dI don\u2019t think the Inspector would like that very much\u201d is his honest answer.\n\u201cOh he\u2019ll thank me later\u201d she says and he knows from experience that eh can\u2019t dissuade her, but at least he has a good enough opinion of the inspector\u2019s heart not to worry too much.\nAs it turns out in the coming weeks, Lady felicia\u2019s plan is to throw them together as much as possible and hope for the best. Which might of course work, but at the same time, eh has the feeling that the inspector might need a bit more encouragement than that. Sid \u2013 oh, he\u2019s under no delusions in that regard. Sid is probably more than ready to throw caution to the wind, but then, he\u2019s not working for the police and has seen the inside of a jail more than once, even though until now he\u2019s gotten off lightly.\nAnd so, he watches the two of them clear out lady F\u2019s shed because apparently the Gardner doesn\u2019t have time, which is a lie, or work away on her car, because for some reason the chauffeur seems to have gone the way of the gardener (at elates that\u2019s an activity they both enjoy) and then, on a rather memorable occasion, keep the two small girls of her visiting cousin occupied (as it turns out to no one\u2019s surprise, the good inspector is better at keeping everyone in check while Sid takes care of the entertainment).\nAs far as he can tell, at least they seem to be getting along now, and to no longer pretend that they don\u2019t like each other, although they clearly have not gone any further\u2026\nAgain, it is not his life, and he really should not know about this, thinking of the church, so he decides to let things take their course, and it seems that they do, about two weeks later, if he is right.\nHe certainly has never seen Inspector Sullivan smile at a crime scene, but the real surprise is that he simply looks at him and shrugs. \u201cComing to take a guess, Father?\u201d\n\u201cI just want to pray for the poor soul, and see if I can identify them.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case\u2026 be my guest.\u201d\nHe decides not to comment because certainly the inspector has his reasons.\nSaid reasons how up ten minutes on their favorite motorbike and Father brown, even if he does say so himself, does a very good impression of a man who is much too busy realizing why the inspector is hurrying over the street.\nEven so, he catches Sergeant Goodfellow\u2019s eyes and they smiled at one another.\nAt least he will be able to tell Lady Felicia that all is well the next time she comes over for tea. If she has not yet noticed herself, that is.",

He certainly had not been interested in nuclear weapons during the lesson last week, and he had looked rather bored when Crowley had told him that bedtime story about Godzilla last night \u2013\n\u201cIt\u2019s just \u2013 oh dear \u2013 you better come.\u201d\nNormally they tried to make it seem like they didn\u2019t know one another so he immediately felt worried as they repaired to Warlock\u2019s room.\nAs first, he didn\u2019t think too much of it \u2013 he was playing with one of his Lego sets\u2026\nAnd then he heard what he was\nactually\nsaying.\n\u201cAaaaaaaaah, it burns, save yourselves!\nNoooooooooooooo Father!\nIt\u2019s got me it\u2019s too late tell your mother I love her\u2026l\u201d\nAll in all it was a rather impressive display, he would say that, especially since the child in question was only six years old, but that didn\u2019t distract him from the fact that the theme of his play was rather dark and that this was not something a child should come up with\u2026 on the other hand, maybe it was. Yes, he knew children, but that also meant he was aware they could come up with all kinds of stuff.\nBut that Aziraphale had called him in meant that there might be more to this story.. as a matter of fact, when he turned to him, he looked\u2026 guilty?\nBut why should he feel guilty, if there was one thing he knew, it was that they had an arrangement when it came to Warlock \u2013 one of many over the centuries, although they all paled in front if the big one that had been in place almost since they had known each other \u2013\nThere was only one explanation, he realized, and that was that the angel had mentioned something he shouldn\u2019t have.\n\u201cDid you stick to the plan?\u201d he asked even though it was a very stupid inquiry. Not because of his thought process, as just demonstrated, but because it was the wrong wording (and eh should know If there was one thing he could count on when it came to Aziraphale, it would that he would remain on the path he was absolutely sure God had chosen for him \u2013\nOnly that he looked \u2013 well \u2013 not very comfortable right now and yes \u2013 here came the hand-wringing \u2013\nSomething was up. \u201cAngel\u201d he hissed. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cWell he wanted to hear about the destruction of Pompei\u201d.\n\u201cWhat \u2013 the \u2013 he\u2019s five! How did he even know about that?\u201d\n\u201cAs far as I can understand, he was playing by himself in a corridor\u201d that often happened with children of rich parents, Crowley knew, all the money in the world and yet they ended up with little to no friends, he would have to talk to Mrs. Downing about kindergarten again, they could not just let this happen \u201cand his father had a meeting bin his office and the door was open and someone compared the current geopolitical situation with 79 AC.\u201d\nWhich was idiotic because, well, most of what was wrong with things currently was the humans fault. Crowley knew that, his angel knew that, and they knew it too. But of course that was not what Warlock would take from the story, as he was clearly demonstrating because he was currently watching family melt in his mind with relish.\nThis did not seem very heavenly to Crowley. Didn\u2019t even seem very hell-y either, if he was being honest. They would have let them suffer more.\nNot that he was about to suggest that. They had enough trouble as it was.\n\u201cFine. So what do we do now?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about taking him there \u2013\u201c\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just tell his parents were taking a small child on a holiday, and he\u2019d probably have fun. That would be counterproductive.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you suggest then \u2013\u201c\n\u201cLet me try.\u201d\nAnd, with his experience when it came to children, ten minutes later he had Warlock stage a rescue operation that would never have worked in real life, but who was he to judge? As far as he was concerned this was progress.\nAnd if Aziraphale stayed and watched them both with something like awe on his face, neither of them would mention it for the next few decades to come.",

        "comment": "It was nothing new that Richard had\u2026 problems when it came to acclimatizing himself to Saint Marie, much as Camille and her mother and the rest of the team had been trying their best. He did accept their invitations now and then, these days, it was true, but he was still wearing the same suits he had when transferring here, was obviously not trying to find a home (which really, he should because the shack was no place to live. What if he ever wanted to\u2026 get something better for\u2026 certain reasons? He could hardly stay on the beach then\u2026), and when it came to the island\u2019s style of living\u2026\nBetter not touch that particular subject, but still.\nTrue, though, all of this did not explain everything, and Camille would blame herself for it for quite longer than she\u2019d let anyone know.\nBut the point was, she had driven to the shack yet again on an evening where there was not much to do. Usually, she found Richard reading, but today, he was on his knees on the floor, seemingly searching for something, and she cleared her throat.\nHe looked up and she was taken aback by the somewhat frantic look in his eyes.\n\u201cRichard? Is everything alright?\u201d she asked even though it was clear it very much wasn\u2019t.\n\u201cI \u2013 I \u2013 there was a bug, it was the size of a small puppy, and I blinked and it was gone, and \u2013\u201c\nShe would have assumed he was hallucinating if she didn\u2019t know there were indeed a few large insects on Saint Marie.\nThere was a very quiet noise in a corner, the sort of thing she did not pay attention to because she had grown up here. Richard, of course, was a different matter.\n\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d he asked his eyes wide, reeling around, and Camille knew she had to act.\n\u201cAlright that\u2019s it. Veranda\u201d. And she gently contemplated him outside and into a chair out there. \u201cTake a few dep breaths.\u201d He did as she hurried inside and got a cold bottle of mineral water from the fridge (that really was making some unnatural noises \u2013 she would have to ask about that eventually, but later, once everything was\u2026)\n\u201cHere\u201d she said, passing him the bottle, and was relieved to find he wasn\u2019t too out of it to realize that she wanted him to take a deep drag and breathe.\nThey were silent for a minute or two and then Richard said quietly \u201cThank you\u201d.\nShe wanted, but there was nothing. Then, she inquired, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d Tone, she had learned early on, was everything with Richard; and she was very careful lest she sound accusatory or even as if she was ridiculing him.\n\u201cI \u2013 yes, I am now, thank you.\u201d\n\u201cRichard\u2026\u201d\nHe took a deep breath. \u201cI have to apologize.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just sometimes I get these \u2013 these thoughts and \u2013 there was this really big critter, you see and \u2013 \u201c he took another deep shaky breath. \u201cIt just \u2013 goes round and round in my head and I can\u2019t stop it. It\u2019s not \u2013 It\u2019s not normal of course, I mean \u2013\u201c\nNo, it most likely wasn\u2019t\u2026 from all that she knew of him, she would guess obsessive-compulsive (not that she liked him any less for it, and she was ready to bet the others felt the same). \u201cAnd? Do you feel better now?\u201d\nHe nodded miserably and she reached out to lay a hand on his arm. \u201cRichard, you have to know that \u2013 yes, I am aware this can\u2019t be easy for you. But there are ways to manage.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how? I can\u2019t get off this bloody island \u2013 \u201c\nNow, that was not something she liked to hear but she moved on from it, for now. \u201cI meant \u2013 well \u2013 you could be looking for a place with proper doors and windows \u2013\u201c\n\u201cHave you seen the prices around here? And it\nhas\nto be close to the station, and it\ndoesn\u2019t\nhave to be too big, alright, maybe that wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but \u2013 \u201c\nShe stayed quiet so he wouldn\u2019t realize what he had just divulged, instead saying, \u201cI will gladly help you.\u201d\nThat shut him up.\nAnd so, she was the one to grab a notepad for once and start making a list.\nHe did protest when it came to some things \u2013 seafood and different clothes \u2013 but she told him that some things had to give, and eventually,\neventually\n, she won that fight.\nReally, it was only the beginning of some happy developments.\nEven if it meant that she had to deal with these \u2013 Richard insisted on calling them \u201cepisodes\u201d when really it was nothing.\nAnd in that, he too, mellowed over the years, the fact that she eventually found him pouring over an encyclopedia of insects with their five-year-old proving it.",

        "comment": "Morse, Robbie had heard that long before he met the man himself, was\u2026 difficult. Which was not the word his colleagues had used precisely, but still, it came close enough, and he felt that one should have respect for a superior officer, especially one who had his success rate, Even if he never seemed to have found a sergeant who worked well with him. But that, too, didn\u2019t have to mean anything \u2013 some people just preferred working alone, and Morse certainly brought the results that they needed, so that no one had ever complained, apart from, if he remembered correctly, Superintendent Strange, but there were a few\nstrange\nrumours going on about him and the lodge, too, so he thought their boss probably didn\u2019t have a leg to stand on when it came to this.\nStill\u00a0 morse had a reputation, so when he had happened across him on a case, he hadn\u2019t expected much. He\u2019d probably have the whole thing solved in a day or two, and Robbie would be left to do the paperwork, which was usually the case anyway. He supposed it was something to have met the big man, anyway.\nApart from \u2013\nWell, it was something else to actually\nsee\nhim work. If it had not been for DCI Morse\u2019s well-known\u2026 opinions eh would call them he would have assumed that the man should have been even above Superintendent Strange in rank at this point, but instead, here he was, solving one of the most complicated murders Robbie had ever seen like it was nothing.\nAfterwards, they went their separate ways, naturally.\nUntil the next case where Morse needed a sergeant and Robbie was available. He thought so at the time, at least \u2013 later much alter he would learn that morse had actually requested him and that strange, utterly relieved that he would finally ask for someone by name, had immediately handed Robbie over like a parcel even though he would never have said it like that in front of either of them.\nAnd so, here they were, with another case under their belt, doing the paperwork in Morse\u2019s office, or perhaps, rather, Robbie doing most of it while Morse was busy listening to some classics LP or another, but that too, he had known before..\nIf he had ever imagined something like that, he would perhaps have thought that Morse would just go and not keep him company, so he supposed that was something, and he knew through the grapevine that hr controlled every piece of paperwork that passed his desk anyway even if he didn\u2019t want anyone to know.\nWhen eh was done, he stood up and handed Morse the files, feeling ever so slightly down. He actually enjoyed working with him, much as yes, he could be a difficult, miserable sod, but that was neither here nor there anyway\u2026\n\"That was good work\" Morse then sad as if it was nothing.\nIt actually rendered him speechless for a second \u2013 had Morse just \u2013 he really had to mark this date in his calendar. This was undoubtedly the pinnacle of his career, unless he actually managed to do the bloody course and become an inspector, as Val aways said he would, but Robbie always figured she was a bit biased when it came to him and what he was capable of.\n\u201cI \u2013 I \u2013 \u201c he cleared his throat. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d\nMorse looked at him and nodded, once, twice, seemingly thinking about something, then saying, \u201cYou\u2019re without a governor at the moment, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cThere are only so many inspectors who need a bagman, and currently they all have one.\u201d He always told himself not to be too disappointed when yet another one of his colleagues was picked. True, he usually prided himself on getting along with pretty much everyone, so why he of all people should not yet have been asked to be someone\u2019s bagman, but anyway, that was neither here nor there, and \u2013\n\u201cI could use someone. If you want to work with me, that is.\u201d\nHe needed a moment or two to understand what Morse was saying, just because he would never have thought it possible. Yes, he had enjoyed working with him on that aces, notwithstanding the fact that a woman had lost her life, but still, this was DCI Morse, and he would never \u2013\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s not mandatory. There is no \u2013\u201c\n\u201cYes, sir I would like that very much\u201d he interrupted him before he could let that chance pass him by even though he still hadn\u2019t quite grasped what was happening.\n\u201cAlright then\u201d. He raised an eyebrow. \u201cTime for a drink at the pub, le-wis.\u201d\nAnd even though it was just the beginning of him leaving way too large of a portion of his wages at public houses, he would never regret it.",

But he\u2019s no longer a child, so \u2013\n\u201cTell me more about Camille\u201d she then demands, and he can\u2019t really say anything against that because she is his second in command, and he likes to imagine a friend, even if he would dispute the fact as he did already once before when she seemed to suggest such.\nAde so, he talks about Camille and how she made him agree to small talk in the mornings and spending time at la Kaz after the day is done and that she likes to show up and drag him out of his \u201cmonastic cell\u201d as she insists on calling it and that he usually goes with her because it\u2019s easier\u2026 undoubtedly Mum, who has always appreciated her own company too, otherwise she would hardly have married his father, who can be even more silent than Richard on any given occasion, will understand that it can be frustrating for him \u2013\nBut for some reason, she just keeps smiling, and he keeps talking and\u2026\nHe forces himself to stop because certainly no one should know this much about a colleague, but Mum simply smiles again and pats his hand. \u201cI\u2019m sure your differences are not all that great, dearest. It will all work out.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not quite sure what she means, but instead focuses back on what he has to pack.\nMum will tell him, she usually does.\nAs she indeed does, five years later when she convinces Dad to move to Saint Marie once and for all so they can watch their grandchildren grow up, Camille more than happy to help her parents-in-law settle in.",

The point was, he could not, would not get that Dev was suffering just by being in the town he had grown up in, knowing his family lived and breathed and laughed within its walls and had no idea that there was someone missing from their midst.\nBut with all of that\u2026 there was something else, and that was that Peter was reasonably sure he was the only one who knew how bad it was. Partly because he and Dev were not accustomed to hide things from one another, and partly because\u2026 well\u2026 mow that he was building up the Guard, no one would dare to question how he was doing and what he was feeling.\nNo one except Peter that was, but they were friends \u2013 as a matter of fact, Dev was the first friend he had ever made in his life.\nAnd so, he kept a close eye on Dev, even closer than usual, that was \u2013 with magic involved, it was always a good idea to Saty on one\u2019s guard, in case anyone tried anything, so he was already careful. It was one of the things he\u2019d had to accept when he had chosen this life, but he did not regret it and very much suspected that he never would.\nNow, when it came to them, they were used to what they called their bad nights. When Peter remembered the cane or dev woke up from a dream believing to be sixteen years old again with Joan and Sam clamoring for his attention, when a case reminded them that time was fleeting and that any day they might \u2013 they had experience dealing with such things, that was what he meant to say, but all of this \u2013 is what usually just that \u2013 a bad night. Not a constant deluge of being reminded what they could not have, and it was easy to tell that it was wearing Dev down, only that he would not admit I because he would not risk being sent back to London, so there was no way that he could just\u2026 ask. Because there were lines he did not cross, not when it came to Dev\u2019s family.\nOr maybe not because he woke up and could just tell it was a Abd night. They usually could, although peter knew that he himself had had much more bad nights than Dev over the years, although his friend would deny that.\nHe got up and went into the living room and found Dev standing at the window, staring out at the city he had tried so hard to get back to, only that it was not the city he had left behind on that fateful day.\n\u201cHey\u201d he said as usual, sitting down because asking would lead to nothing. He knew him too well for that.\nIt took a while but eventually Dev walked over and sat down too, staring at his folded hands.\nPerter continued to wait.\n\u201cNo\u201c he finally said, even though Peter had as of yet asked no questions, quietly like a confession, like something shameful even though it was not, it very much was not, \u201cI\u2019m not okay\u201d.\nAn understatement of course, the bloody understatement of the bloody century, but there was nothing they could o about it. Even if Dev could have left Oxford again \u2013 which he would have refused to do anyway \u2013 it would not have done any good, now that he had seen them, now that they were playing happy family in front of him \u2013 no, not playing, just\nbeing\na happy family, and that made everything worse, so much worse \u2013\nPeter did not know what to say. How could he even begin to understand? Dev himself was the closest thing he had ever had to a family, and he wasn\u2019t quite sure being taken in after almost having been devoured by a vampire counted.\nHe stared down into his tea, wishing it could be something stronger but at the same time aware that this was a slippery slope, a very slippery slope indeed, and that he might not stop if he ever started.\n\u201cI \u2013 \u201c he finally began because despite the many, many nights they had spent like this, he still didn\u2019t know what to say.\nDev glanced at him then, smiled and said, \u201cThank you, Peter.\u201d\nAnd for some reason, it was enough yet again.",

He might not have been his own master, but he planned to rectify that soon, and anyway, for now, it was even sort of fun to have a 9 to 5 job most of the time since he had never really known what that was.\nAnd he couldn\u2019t deny that he enjoyed spending time with Peter \u2013 as a matter of fact, one of the reasons he had already more than once drawn back from making definitive plans was that he would never see him, Elizabeth or the other people he had slowly come to call his friends once he was done here.\nBut well, while he was still here, he might as well take this seriously because it got Peter off his back and made people think he was resigned to this, so he might as well just have some fun\u2026 by taking it seriously (it did not have to makes sense to other people, as he would have told Mozzie).\nAnd so, when a new case rolled around and he shared the team\u2019s frustration at not being able to lay hand on the suspect and another agent just strolled in acting like he was the next big thing, Neal just\u2026 snapped.\nAgent Linder had been going on and on abet this case, how he was the one who first realized something was off about the bank statements, how he deserved to bring in the culprit, how it would bring him forward and he would finally get some much-deserved recognition (it was clear what he was angling for, but good luck with that, Neal knew they were still waiting for Peter to want Organized Crime).\nWhat he meant to say was, he just couldn\u2019t take it anymore, and so, when the man finally needed to take a deep breath\u2026\n\u201cLet me remind you\u201c Neal said impatiently. \u201cWe need a warrant to be able to search the place, or rather, to ensure that everything we find can be used in court, bevues if it can\u2019t, we might as well do nothing at all.\u201d\nLinder shot him a dirty look, but he couldn\u2019t have cared less. If they wanted to get this guy off the streets, then they had \u2013\nIt was then that he realized what he had just said, and what he had been thinking, and he quickly went to get coffee.\nHe shook his head at himself as he poured himself a cup. That case last week where he had yet again pretended that he was an FBI agent must be catching up with him. Thank God Mozzie had not been around, he would never have heard the end of it.\nHe had hoped that his outburst had gone unnoticed, but that had perhaps been too much to ask, especially with Peter Burke around. Art first, he didn\u2019t think much of it when his friend joined him \u2013 Peter was worse than him when it came to coffee, as June\u2019s depleted Italian roast stash could attest \u2013 but then he causally said, \u201cYou were right, of course.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d he agreed automatically then asked just to make sure \u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\u201cWith Linder just now. We can\u2019t do anything without a warrant, and with the evidence we have now, or lack thereof, no judge would sign one.\u201d\n\u201cJust wanted to save some time. He is rather insufferable.\u201d\n\u201cYou can say that again\u201d Peter told him, uncharacteristically grinning (well the grinning in itself was not uncharacteristic, but that he should do so while complaining about a\u00a0 colleague certainly was). \u201cI am just glad you reminded him of the correct procedure.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go so far.\u201d\nPeter shrugged even though it was clear he did not agree.\n\u201cWhatever, don\u2019t get used to it. I just wanted to take him down a peg or two.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, of course, never\u201d Peter agreed. \u201cNothing else going on here.\u201d\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t you forget it.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\nHe really, really did not, for even years later, after all was said and done and he\u2019d finally admitted some truths to himself and done what ought to be done after his sentence was complete, his friend Peter Burke still laughed every time Special Agent Neal Caffrey reprimanded a young colleague for risking a case by not following the correct procedure.",

        "comment": "In the beginning, Camille would be the first to admit, she had hated working with Richard. He had seemed pedantic, rude and unlikeable, and in some ways, she would admit that he was\u2026 just\u2026 not the way she had thought. Yes, he did not quite understand social cues now and then, and he could be stubborn when running down a lead, but she had come to realize he also cared deeply about the victims and that each and every case should be wrapped up because it was his duty to do so.\nAnd this was just another example.\nAlice Morgan had been found dead a week ago on the beach, and there was almost nothing to go on. The tide had gotten to her before she had been found \u2013 really it was a miracle that she had not been swept away by the sea, which was undoubtedly what the murderer had wanted \u2013 there was little evidence, no reason why someone should murder her, nothing.\nCamille had seen enough such cases over the course of her career to feel that it was hopeless, and was all but resigned to that fact.\nRichard, as it turned out, not so much.\nThey had all gone home for the day. There was nothing to be done until they got the lab results back, although Camille was rather sure that that would lead to nothing, either, so she did it best not to think about it \u2013\nUntil she\u2019d realized she\u2019d forgotten her wallet at the station because she\u2019d had to reorganise her purse and her drawers (maman, when she told her alter, would make some comments about imitating a certain someone, but there would be enough interesting developments for her to deal with anyway) and quickly returned to grab it. And what she found was Richard still going through the evidence.\nShe glanced at her watch \u2013 close to ten pm. She had known he worked long hours, of course, just like she was aware that he found it difficult to sleep anyway with the weather (and she was trying, really trying, to get him to find a place with a proper AC, figuring he would not be so cranky if eh wasn\u2019t so hot all the time).\nWondering if she should say something, then deciding that against all odds, they were friends, she cleared her throat as she stepped into the station. \u201cRicard, I didn\u2019t know you were still here\u2026\u201d\nHe looked up and blinked, clearly needing a moment or two to recognize her, and she would have Eben worried if she ah dot come to understand him much better than she had at the beginning. He had simply been lost in thought and she just had to wait.\nThen he asked, \u201cCamille? Is there something you need?\u201d as if he was not working late into the night.\n\u201cI just needed something from my desk, that is all\u2026\u201d after a moment or two she added \u201c\u00a7I didn\u2019t think anyone would still be here.\u201d\n\u201cI told you before, in London we usually have two teams, so really, this is just me trying my best\u2026\u201d\nAnd naturally he had not mentioned it to anyone because why would he. She suppressed a sigh than sat down at her desk. \u201cFine, let\u2019s go over it again.\u201d\n\u201cI \u2013 oh \u2013\u201c he was clearly surprised \u201cCamille, you don\u2019t have to \u2013 I am sure you have plans \u2013 \u201c\n\u201cAs a matter of fact I don\u2019t, and even if I had, why should you work away all alone?\u201d\nIt was then that he shrugged and said quietly \u201cI\u2019m used to it.\u201d\n\u201cRichard\u201d she tried, \u201cWe really have to make sure we\u2019re well-\u201c\n\u201cI\u2019m not giving up\u201d he interrupted her stubbornly. The victim serves justice, and \u2013\u201c\nAnd she realized that this was not about Richard being right, or proving himself better than the rest of the team, or anything else she would have assumed just after he had been transferred here.\nNo, this was simply about solving the case, giving the victim back whatever dignity they could have, and she raised a hand to quietly say, \u201cRichard, I know.\u201d\nThis interrupted him mid-rant and he looked at her, then nodded, as if he was shocked that she had agreed.\nThen a groan made itself known and she raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have dinner, did you?\u201d\n\u201cI \u2013 \u201c he cleared his throat. \u201cI figured this was more important \u2013\u201c\n\u201cIt is important, but you need to keep up your strength.\u201d She made a quick decision. \u201cCome on, I can make you something quick at my place.\u201d\nHe blushed. \u201cCamille, I \u2013 just \u2013 It\u2019s very kind of you, but \u2013 \u201c\n\u201cNo buts. Come on.\u201d And against all odds, he followed her.\nAt least in later years, she didn\u2019t have to tell him to come to dinner. Sending one of their children to fetch Dad usually did the trick.",

Not the proper word to use, and anyway, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s giving back any of what he stole. The FBI already seized most of it, and what little there remains is not exactly the most expensive of the bunch.\nThe point is, he really didn\u2019t think he\u2019s changing in any way, shape or form. He might have a nine-to-five, but he hates it (or so eh thought). It\u2019s nice to have dinner with Peter and Elizabeth sometimes but it doesn\u2019t take away the fact that he can only walk so far without being arrested (he was convinced). It\u2019s one thing to be able to solve cases and help people, but another when one is forced to do so (he believed).\nSo, really, he was just a crook who flew too close to the sun, as Mozzie put it, got caught, then got lucky and that is why he is not in jail and biding his time. Easy, right?\nAs it turns out, not so much.\nHe\u2019s been going through some files. Nothing big, nothing that needs their immediate attention, but if he doesn\u2019t, there\u2019ll be repercussions, mainly that Peter will have to do it on his own, he\u2019ll be late for dinner, and Elizabeth will be annoyed, not to mention that Diana and Jones will roll their eyes, and anyway, it\u2019s easy enough work for a few hours. Mozzie sends him a text that they need to talk, but that can mean anything and is not alarming really so he decides to ignore it until he gets home that night.\nMozzie is waiting for him, having opened a bottle of wine, of course.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asks when her realizes his friend his unnaturally excited, even for his standards.\nAs it turns out, it\u2019s a von Alt. Not extremely well known over here, but fetching a lot in Europe, so \u2013 perfect. Also, currently being house in one of the smaller museums in Manhattan, being on permanent loan from a millionaire how seems to consider it his duty to let other people enjoy works of art too instead of letting them rot in some vault or another which, from what he knows of that kind of people, is positively philanthropic. Also a bit stupid, but it just gives them the chance to\u2026 to\u2026\nHe says no without even thinking about it. There\u2019s just something that rubs him the wrong way. Also, it\u2019s next week, and there\u2019s an audit coming up, not to mention Diana and Jones will be in court, and Peter is \u2013\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done worse\u201d Mozzie say and he automatically opens his mouth to argue only to realize that in fact, they have, They have, as mentioned before, stolen and lied and cheated, and he has never even batted an eye, because it\u2019s unfair that some people have nice things and they don\u2019t. It\u2019s just how life works \u2013 sometimes you have to help justice along if you actually want to see it done\u2026\nBut this\u2026 well\u2026 this is not one of those times. This is literally just them being annoyed that another rich guy has a painting. If he were hiding it away, that would be one thing, but it\u2019s literally on loan to the gallery, and so people get to see it. Everyone is happy with that, apart from people who want it for themselves or need the money, and\u2026\nWell\u2026 Neal does get paid. Not a lot. But there\nis\ncompensation. And anyway, if something happened and Peter realized what was going on \u2013 always a risk, although until now, it just added to the gun of it \u2013 he\u2019d hunt them down again because this is Peter they are speaking of.\n\u201cI know\u201d he finally answers because he realizes Mozzie expects him to. \u201dIt\u2019s just \u2013 \u201c and then he realizes he has no idea what to say to even start to explain what\u2019s going on in his head, because it seems that part of him is a law-abiding citizen all of a sudden and it\u2019s a little bit too much for him to comprehend.\n\u201cLook I\u2019m not saying never, alright? I\u2019m just saying some other time\u201d he tries to save himself, only for Mozzie to raise an eyebrow.\n\u201cFine, fine, mon fr\u00e8re, just don\u2019t expect me to join you on your new side any time soon.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no new side, he thinks, shaking his Hea.

        "comment": "At first, he cannot believe it.\nThis is, this is finally it.\nRight there, in the file he has been working on through sheer boredom, is a list of accounts on the Kaiman islands, hidden in plain view. He doubts anyone who has not done a little shuffling and coding themselves would be able to figure it out.\nWhich is why Peter gave him the file, of course. He\u2019s supposed to tell him immediately, and then they can shut this down, get the money back to those it belongs to.\nBut\n, a voice in Neal\u2019s head whispers,\ndoes it really matter\n? It\u2019s gone, and there is every reason to suppose the victims were insured for that kind of thing. He most likely could grab the cash for himself and no one would be the wiser, only that he would have everything eh could need to \u2013 need to \u2013\nHe quickly outs a plan together. He could be out of here by the middle of next week.\nAnd then Peter steps out of his office, does the two-finger-point, and he automatically gets up to see him.\n\u201cAnd?\u201d Peter asks because of course at the moment he can only mean that one case. That many millions going missing tend to make the higher-ups nervous.\n\u201cHe\u2019s certainly creative\u201d Neal says, playfully opening and closing the file because this is what peter expects from him and the last thing he needs is to arouse suspicion. \u201cThinks outside the box, has a tendency to \u2013\u201c\n\u201cYes, yes, but I definitely don\u2019t need a detailed critique of his work. I need to know what he did with the money.\u201d\nAnd this is when he makes his mistake, although not in the way he would have supposed he would, if he\u2019d thought about it at all. \u201cHow do you know\u201d he says \u201cthat I haven\u2019t figured it out already? Might make a run for it.\u201d\nPeter chuckles \u2013 as if it\u2019s a joke when this is Neal Caffrey they are talking about, the man an entire Bureau of agents couldn\u2019t catch until Peter Burke figured out his one weakness, and he almost feels a little angry.\nUntil the next words escape Peter\u2019s mouth.\n\u201cI know you better\u201c he says, when he really doesn\u2019t. When, as a matter of fact, he should be aware that Neal hasn\u2019t really changed, did not take any of the lessons he was supposed to learn to heart, was only ever trying to get away.\nNeal looks at him, in his hands his ticket out of here, to another life, one without a nine-to-five job, where he gets to do what he wants again, perhaps live in Paris or Rome or Florence, where he has no responsibilities, no watch dogs, no ties holding him down \u2013\nAnd he realizes that Peter knows, but that he cannot stop him. What he needs is there in the file, and he has a right to read it because he is his CI, and what he does in his spare time\u2026\nHe looks into his eyes and those words, those four words, keep repeating themselves in his head.\nI know you better. I know you better. I know you better.\nReally what does it matter that he is about to prove Peter wrong? He has disappointed him often enough. And leaving, that\u2019s all he\u2019s ever wanted since he took this deal, isn\u2019t it? It got him out of prison, but this was never supposed to last. It was just his ticket out of his cell so he could go look for Kate, and then of course that \u2013 that \u2013\nAnd after, what else was he supposed to do? If he hadn\u2019t stuck around, the FBI would have been after him faster than he could blink, so he had to wait just a few more months, and then there was so much to do, or a case that he couldn\u2019t leave just to Peter because it would have meant him all but camping in his office again, and then he would have been in El\u2019s black books\u2026\nMore time has passed than Neal wants to admit himself, although he wants to dwell on the reason, the real reason for that even less.\nI know you better.\nHe looks into Peter\u2019s eyes and makes the decision without being aware of it, without thinking,\nyes, let\u2019s do this.\nInstead, he just answers, \u201clet me take another look.\u201d And he opens the file.\nNo all is lost yet. He might \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s a code. Let me see what I can do about it.\u201d\nAnd he knows he\u2019s done it now because even if he pretended not to figure it out, Peter would realize there was something.\nAnd yet there is no regret, no anger at himself, nothing.\nPeter nods at him, smiling. \u201cAlright. Let me know.\u201d\nAnd he nods back and returns to \u2013 his desk.",

        "comment": "When it came to humans, Crowley had learned that early on, there was always something. One could never trust that they were done, even if they had managed to gather in a group and build a city and procured everything they needed to live comfortably; no, there was always something more, and that something more usually consisted on them fighting over nothing, or at least nothing that made sense. It was one of those things that made them so frustrating and so interesting at the same time.\nAt elates, even he would admit that, this Solomon fellow was rather clever. Being a judge, settling disputes left and right. New, technically he should have been against all of that, being a demon and so on, but at the same time\u2026 you had to admire him, just a little-. Most humans, no, most demons, he \u2013 heaven. Most angels would not have done such a good job, which he was very aware of because he had once worked closely with Gabriel and it had not been a pleasant experience.\nQuite different from that very first time he had met \u2013\n\u201cAngel\u201d he greeted him, strolling up to Aziraphale, who was watching the proceedings utterly enchanted, as he was wont to when humans proved how clever they could be.\nHe turned to him. \u201cHe \u2013 oh. Crowley.\u201d\nAt times like these, he wondered if Aziraphale remembered when they had first met, when they had still been angels, but it didn\u2019t matter. All that was long gone now, simply because he had dared asked questions, and now they were hereditary enemies, or at least supposed to be, although that had never stopped them from getting on since Eden, even though from his perspective, Aziraphale would have had every reason to get angry at him.\n\u201cPretty clever that Solomon, you have to admit\u201d he said. \u201cSeeing which woman would be ready to give the child up rather than watch them being cut in half.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d Aziraphale replied, looking at him and frowning. It\u2019s \u2013 I mean \u2013 only \u2013 a little bit ruthless for someone who is supposed to be so God-fearing\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut effective. Humans will talk about this for millennia to come.\u201d He could already see a man scribbling away on one of those clay tablets that were all the range, these days. Undoubtedly this was one of those scenes that would get passed down, although it would probably get a bit distorted across the years because that was how things tended to work out when they got involved.\nCrowley personally found it rather interesting, but he knew some of the other demons were more angry than anything else \u2013 probably supposed to be because that was what they were, and the angels \u2013\nBetter not go there. Apart from \u2013 his angel, he had never really gotten along with any of them, even back when he was still an angel himself.\nNot that he had fared any better with the other demons. He was starting to think that Aziraphale was just an exception \u2013 as wonderful and as strange as it was disconcerting, and yet he would not have traded their\u2026 relationship (not a relationship, of course not, not like that, nit like the humans, why was he even thinking about that, it was utterly ridiculous, it could not be, it would not be, and he was going to stop thinking about this right now).\n\u201cI do hope the child will have a good life\u201d Aziraphale said, wringing his hands, and Crowley did not know what to say. Human lives could be very fickle and complicated, so\u2026\n\u201cShe would not have done this just to let them fall later\u201d he said vine though he was far from certain about this. So, instead, he decided to nudge him and move on. Only that he was surprised at the words that escaped his mouth.\n\"it's a new day, let's go\". He had no idea why he would say something like that, and whether it would work \u2013 first of all, there were not really days in Heaven or Hell, so they were not used to this sort of talk and second of all, why should Aziraphale go with him? It was asinine to \u2013\n\u201cThere is a nice little tavern three streets over.\u201d\nHe blinked then looked at the angel, then towards where he was pointing, ridiculous of course because not even they with their powers could see that far without performing a miracle, and while he could easily have done so, doing it in front of Aziraphale would mean that his \u2013 friend? Were they fiends? He thought so, but he had no idea if Aziraphale felt the same way, but this was only in his thoughts, so his friend \u2013 yes he would be asked to explain the miracle, so he didn\u2019t think about and indeed turned back to him.\n\u201cAlright then\u201d he agreed and off they were.",
        "writing_prompt": "After witnessing Solomon's famous judgment, Crowley and Aziraphale find themselves debating the cleverness and morality of human ingenuity\u2014until Crowley suggests a nearby tavern, and the two unlikely companions set off, their centuries-old bond as complicated as ever."
