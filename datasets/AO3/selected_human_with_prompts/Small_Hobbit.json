        "comment": "Tom Hill and I were slightly late for choir practice one evening, as we had had to wait for Tom\u2019s son, George, who had been delayed, to convey us there. We had assumed that the choir would begin without us, for it was not unusual for someone to be late most weeks, since at least half worked on the farms around the village and cows calving and escaping hens are no respecters of choir rehearsal times. However, to our surprise, we heard no singing, but instead the new curate looked disapprovingly at us, and said, \u201cGood, we can now begin. Please take your places without any further delay.\u201d\nWe were rehearsing for a special service for St James Day, our church name day. We struggled through the opening hymn, with the curate stopping us several times to correct pronunciation. To my mind this was a pointless exercise, we are in the middle of rural Sussex and most of the choir managed to revert to their usual accents every time we started a new verse.\nThe curate then handed out the music he had chosen for the anthem. \u201cWe shall be singing in four parts,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease look through your part and we will practise the first section tonight. As you can see, this is in four sections, and we shall therefore need additional rehearsals before the service.\u201d\nThere was general mutterings about this. We normally fit in a few extra rehearsals before Christmas and Easter, but summer evenings are too important to give up extra time. Many who are at work during the day will be in their gardens in the evening, tending to not only their flowers, but also the vegetables which will be important to their families for the autumn and winter. In addition, both our cricket umpires sing in the choir, and they would therefore not miss midweek matches.\nThe curate seemed oblivious to these protests and instead, after a few minutes said, \u201cRight, we will try the first ten bars.\u201d\nHe started to conduct, and everyone waited patiently. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you singing?\u201d he snapped.\n\u201cWe\u2019re waiting for you to sing the tune to us,\u201d the church warden said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve given you the music, what more do you need?\u201d\nI realised the majority of the choir members were looking at me, so reluctantly I explained. \u201cMost of the choir don\u2019t read music. You need to sing the tune and then they\u2019ll copy it.\u201d\n\u201cHow did they get to be in the choir? This is ridiculous. I\u2019m going to speak to the vicar.\u201d\nHe stormed out but had failed to realise the vicar\u2019s cat had strolled into the church earlier and had been enjoying the evening sunshine as it came through one of the windows. Hearing the footsteps coming down the aisle, the cat leapt up and made a dash for the door, tripping the curate up in the process.\nHaving picked himself up, the curate left the church.\n\u201cHe should have rehearsed his exit,\u201d one of the basses sitting behind me said.\nThe choir decided unanimously to head for the Red Lion before the man should return.",

You look bigger than you did yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing a thick jumper underneath my sheet. The one you told me was extremely unflattering. Which it may be, but it\u2019s also warm.\u201d John tried, and failed, to keep the smugness out of his voice.\nSherlock was about to reply when the Tannoy blared.\nPlaces everyone. The gates open in ten minutes.\nTogether they headed towards the Haunted House. Partway they passed a dragon which was lying on its side, groaning, and waving its legs rather ineffectively in the air.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d John said cheerfully, \u201cwe\u2019ll let Greg know you need some help.\u201d\nThere was what sounded like muffled swearing from the dragon, which tried to kick John with one of its back legs.

I\u2019m inside and I don\u2019t have to listen to Anderson\u2019s moaning.\u201d\nAt that point Greg arrived. \u201cRight,\u201d he said, \u201cremember you\u2019re to make them squeal with fright, not cry with fear. It\u2019s to be a pleasurable experience. We don\u2019t want any more complaints.\u201d\n\u201cWhose been complaining?\u201d Sherlock asked.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t you. Apparently the dragon bit someone yesterday. Some kid decided to put their head in the dragon\u2019s mouth to see what was there. And the dragon closed its mouth. Forcibly. There were tooth marks on the kid\u2019s neck.\u201d\n\u201cDragon ate our Albert!\u201d Sally said.\n\u201cWhat? How do you know the kid was called Albert?\u201d Sherlock asked.\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d John said. \u201cOh, speaking of dragons, it\u2019s fallen over and can\u2019t get back up again.\u201d\n\u201cIt will,\u201d Greg said. \u201cI\u2019ll prod it with St George\u2019s spear.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why is there a dragon? They\u2019re not traditional Hallowe\u2019en creatures.\u201d\n\u201cMycroft got a cheap George and the Dragon costume. We\u2019re not using the George part, although the spear is quite useful. The dragon costume needs adjusting. At the moment Seb\u2019s at the front and Jim\u2019s at the back. Molly thinks it would work better with Jim at the front, but Seb doesn\u2019t fit in the back half. I must be off, dragon to right, punters to welcome.

What you want for your own family is one thing, dictating to others is entirely different.\u201d\n\u201cAnd anyway,\u201d Jo added, \u201cit would be perfectly possible for the husband to resign and the wife to continue to work.\u201d\nGiles looked at her and shook his head. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not the way it is.\u201d\nJo\u2019s expression was such that Ros messaged her, \u2018You look like an angry cat, who\u2019s about to spit at someone.

I presume your views are similar to mine, but you haven\u2019t got the confidence to express them.\u201d\nLucas went white and moved towards Giles. As he did so, Malcolm put his hands on his shoulders and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and find Adam?\u201d\nAs Lucas headed out of the Grid, Ros marched into Harry\u2019s office. \u201cUnless you want a dead body on the floor, I suggest you get rid of your latest recruit,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhich weapon is being employed?\u201d Harry asked.\n\u201cLethal venom spat by Jo, strangulation with a cable by Malcolm, or I\u2019ll use unarmed combat. But if you would prefer we deal with the corpse ourselves, I can recall Adam and Lucas to dispose of the body.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d Harry went to his door and called out, \u201cGiles, a word, please.\u201d\nGiles walked into Harry\u2019s office and failed to close the door behind him. Harry noticed this, but instead of asking him to do so, began, \u201cCongratulations, in half a morning you have managed to alienate the whole of my team. One could almost think you were an enemy agent, but even they would have the sense to know that by doing this they would make absolutely no progress.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand. I simply\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou leapt in without any concept of the dynamics of the office. We are supposed to be preparing you to enter the field, but that means learning to blend in and particularly keeping your mouth shut until you have a good understanding of the situation. You will be reassigned.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2026\u201d\n\u201cShut up! And sit there while I make the necessary phone call.\u201d\nA few minutes later, Harry said, \u201cRight, you\u2019re to report to Section M.\u201d\nGiles left, clearly furious at the way he\u2019d been treated.\n\u201cWill there be any comeback?\u201d Ros asked.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry replied. \u201cAt the moment he\u2019s a liability to any team he\u2019s assigned to, and there\u2019s far too great a risk he\u2019d compromise any operation he was involved in. He\u2019s applied to go abroad, but without being able to blend in, which he clearly can\u2019t, he could be dead within a week. He\u2019s not happy, but at least this way he might live long enough to see the children he seems to be setting so much store on.\u201d",

        "comment": "One fine day in winter the Ferret trotted off to Regent\u2019s Park.\u00a0 He had various thoughts about what he should include in his spring production and a brisk walk would help him put them into some sort of order.\nWhen he entered the park, he spotted a piece of paper blowing along.\u00a0 He jumped on it, to discover I was a hand-drawn map, with an X in the middle of it.\u00a0 Clearly it was a treasure map.\nJust then a little girl came running up.\u00a0 She stopped when she saw the Ferret standing on the map and he saw she looked rather upset.\u00a0 He decided the map must belong to her.\u00a0 Being a good-hearted ferret, even though he wanted to find the treasure himself, he didn\u2019t want the little girl to cry.\u00a0 So, carefully, he moved his back paws off the map, while keeping his front paws on it to prevent it blowing away again.\nThe little girl bent down to pick the map up.\u00a0 \u201cDo you want to help me?\u201d she asked.\u00a0 \u201cMy brother\u2019s drawn the map and hidden some special biscuits for me to find.\u201d\nWhile the Ferret wouldn\u2019t have minded finding gold or jewels, the idea of finding biscuits was even better, so he nodded, and the little girl set off, the Ferret bouncing along beside her.\n\u201cMy name is Maddie,\u201d the little girl said.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know your name, but you look like the squirrel in my book, except you don\u2019t have a tail like a squirrel.\u00a0 And you might not like having a squirrel name, so I shall simply call you Teddy, because that\u2019s my favourite name.\u00a0 Will that be all right?\u201d\nThe Ferret nodded, because he quite liked the name Teddy as well.\nWhen they had walked along the path a little way, Maddie sat down and spread the map out on the ground.\u00a0 \u201cI got this far, but I wasn\u2019t sure where to go from here.\u00a0 I\u2019m not very good at reading maps.\u201d\nThe Ferret wasn\u2019t the best map reader either, but the lake was clearly marked on the map, and he could see the lake.\u00a0 The path they needed to follow headed towards the lake, so he set off in that direction and Maddie followed him.\u00a0 They soon came to a point where two paths met and looking at the map again, the Ferret could see they needed to take the path which went lellarap, or something similar, to the lake.\nHe trotted on until he could see a number of park benches beside the path.\u00a0 He stopped and Maddie put the map down again.\u00a0 She pointed to the benches on the map and counted \u2018one, two\u2019.\u00a0 Together they set off for the second bench.\nThere were people sitting on the bench, and Maddie called, \u201cI\u2019ve found you.\u201d\nMaddie sat down on the bench and the Ferret slipped underneath.\n\u201cDid you follow the map all by yourself?\u201d her brother asked.\n\u201cI had a bit of help from my new friend, Teddy,\u201d Maddie replied.\n\u201cWhat friend is this?\u201d the lady in a uniform asked.\u00a0 The Ferret assumed this was a nanny.\u00a0 \u201cI was watching you and didn\u2019t see you speak to anyone.\u201d\n\u201cTeddy\u2019s like a squirrel, only without the big fluffy tail.\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, of course he is.\u201d\u00a0 The nanny spoke in the sort of voice the Ferret had heard when people think they know everything, when in fact they don\u2019t.\u00a0 \u201cNow you\u2019ve found us, would you like a biscuit?\u201d\n\u201cYes, please.\u00a0 May I have two please?\u201d\n\u201cAll right, as they aren\u2019t very big.\u00a0 But no more, or you won\u2019t eat your dinner.\u201d\nA few seconds later a biscuit shaped like a star came through the gap in the slats of the bench, and the Ferret happily ate it.\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Nanny said it was time they were going, and she and the two children departed.\u00a0 The Ferret then emerged from under the bench and trotted back home.\u00a0 He\u2019d had a lovely morning, made a new friend, and eaten a delicious shortbread biscuit.",

        "comment": "Horatio was about to enter the staff room of Elsinore Junior Academy at the end of a trying week, which was basically every week, so this could be rephrased as the end of the current trying week.\nHowever, Fortinbras, the latest supply teacher, stopped him and said, \u201cPlease tell me that isn\u2019t a ghost in the staff room.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it is,\u201d Horatio said, \u201che always comes for the after school review.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s the last headmaster, can\u2019t let things go, despite being dead.\u201d\n\u201cThey warned me this was a strange place, but that\u2019s ridiculous. What does he do?\u201d\n\u201cNot a lot. Complains a bit, but everyone ignores him, rather like they did at the time in fact.\u201d\nHoratio opened the door, and they went in together. Horatio looked across the room and said, \u201cYou\u2019d better move out of that chair.\u201d Since the ghost didn\u2019t move, he added, \u201cOr Claudius will sit on you.\u201d The ghost reluctantly moved and sat on the filing cabinet.\n\u201cMaybe you can fill me in on something else,\u201d Fortinbras continued. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to the teacher I\u2019m currently replacing?\u201d\n\u201cThat was Hamlet, he\u2019s on sick leave. He kept seeing things.\u201d\n\u201cBut the ghost is real!\u201d\n\u201cThings no-one else could see. He spent one day convinced there was a camel in his room. The kids thought it was hilarious, of course.\u201d\n\u201cThat explains why they all laughed when camels came up in my geography lesson.\u201d\n\u201cYes, probably best to avoid them for the moment. Also, weasels and whales. Claudius found out about that when he saw half the class carrying buckets of water down the corridor and upon enquiry was told Sir had told them to fetch it. Claudius sent them to tip the water down the sinks and went into the classroom to find this was the second half of the class and the first half had already poured theirs all over the floor.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re having me on!\u201d\n\u201cI can show you photos to prove it. The caretaker had to come and dry it up.\u201d\nBy now, most of the rest of the staff had come into the staff room and Claudius followed them. \u201cRight, he said, \u201ccan I have a quick rundown of this week\u2019s disasters. Forget the minor ones, or we\u2019ll be here until Monday morning. And where\u2019s Polonius?\u201d\n\u201cOn his way to hospital,\u201d Gertrude said. \u201cHe was running some ball games with his class in the playground when he tripped over one of the marker cones and fell onto the playground, temporarily knocking himself out. We think he\u2019ll be okay, but it seemed a wise precaution.\u201d\n\u201cSo long as he\u2019s back by Monday, he can take all weekend to recover. What else?\u201d\n\u201cSomething\u2019s eaten all the nuts and berries from my nature table,\u201d Ophelia said.\n\u201cOne of your pupils?\u201d\n\u201cOh no. I think we have mice.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right them. Mice are all part of nature. You did remove the deadly nightshade berries, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cYes, as you requested. I\u2019m glad none of the mice got to eat them.\u201d\n\u201cThe mice probably have more sense, which is more than can be said for most of your class. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some very exciting news,\u201d Rosencrantz said.\n\u201cThe music club have been invited to perform at the junior school festival,\u201d Guildenstern added.\n\u201cHave you thought about what you will play?\u201d Claudius asked.\n\u201cWe have six recorder players who are really doing well now,\u201d Rosencrantz replied.\n\u201cGood. And how tunes do they know?\u201d\n\u201cJust Three Blind Mice,\u201d Guildenstern said, \u201cbut they can play it very well.\u201d\n\u201cThen I suggest you had better politely decline the invitation. If there\u2019s nothing else, then we can just have a quick discussion of the proposed school trip. Laertes, where are you suggesting we visit?\u201d\n\u201cA trip on the River Thames would be nice,\u201d the ghost said. \u201cI\u2019d enjoy that.\u201d\n\u201cFirstly, I am not taking our lot anywhere near large bodies of water. And secondly, you are not coming with us,\u201d Claudius said firmly. \u201cLaertes?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a few enquiries, but so far, as soon as they know I\u2019m from Elsinore Junior Academy, they instantly find they\u2019re fully booked up until the end of next term.\u201d\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t that surprise me?\u201d",

        "comment": "\u201cInspector Slack, Sergeant Lake, how delightful to see you both,\u201d Miss Marple exclaimed.\u00a0 \u201cDo come and have a seat.\u201d\nThe two men, having left their coats and hats with the little maid, entered the sitting room, and sat down in the armchairs Miss Marple had indicated.\n\u201cNow,\u201d she continued, \u201cI suppose you\u2019re here to ask me about the unfortunate death at the Old Schoolhouse.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Miss Marple,\u201d Inspector Slack replied.\u00a0 \u201cIt all seems reasonably clear, but there are one or two small details that don\u2019t fit in, and I was hoping you might be able to provide some local colour to explain them.\u201d\n\u201cI shall certainly endeavour to help.\u00a0 Would you like to try a little of my sloe gin, while you\u2019re here?\u00a0 I\u2019ve recently bottled it.\u201d\nSlack smiled politely.\u00a0 \u201cThank you.\u00a0 I shall enjoy that.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you, sergeant?\u201d\n\u201cJust a drop, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Lake replied.\nMiss Marple stood up and poured three small glasses, one with just under half the amount in the other two.\u00a0 She handed glasses to the two men, before sitting down and taking a sip of her own glass.\nSlack drank a large mouthful and then sat motionless, his eyes blinking rapidly.\u00a0 Lake bit his lip to stop himself laughing, while Miss Marple merely nodded.\n\u201cThat carries a punch,\u201d Slack said.\n\u201cI presume you were expecting something rather like rose hip syrup,\u201d Miss Marple said.\u00a0 \u201cAnd certainly not anything as strong as sloe gin.\u00a0 I assume you haven\u2019t tried it before.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u00a0 And I assume you\u2019re going to draw some sort of comparison with our current case.\u201d\nMiss Marple\u2019s eyes twinkled.\u00a0 \u201cBecause I am a little old lady, you were sure that anything I would make would be similar to a sweet sherry.\u00a0 In the same way, you\u2019ve looked at the murder of Commander Weatherall, and decided that the gardener is a strong young man, who was known to have argued with the commander on at least two occasions, and therefore must be guilty.\u00a0 This is even though the gardener took a great pride in the garden, the source of the arguments, and would be unlikely to have killed the commander so that he crashed into the lilac bush.\u201d\n\u201cYes, that was one of the details.\u00a0 I was hoping you might say the gardener wanted to get rid of the lilac, but Weatherall objected.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it was quite the opposite.\u00a0 At the same time, you disregarded the stepson, who had equal opportunity to kill the commander.\u201d\n\u201cThere seemed no reason for him to do so.\u00a0 Everyone said their relationship was cordial.\u00a0 Weatherell provided the young man with an allowance, which was more generous than what he will receive under the will, so he wasn\u2019t likely to gain by Weatherell\u2019s death.\u201d\n\u201cI would say the relationship appeared cordial to outsiders, but I noticed on the two occasions when I was invited to tea at the Old Schoolhouse, that the stepson did not join us, despite being in the house and when we went into the garden after tea, the commander and his stepson took care to avoid each other.\u00a0 As for the allowance, what has the young man been spending it on?\u00a0 He lives at home and as far as I am aware has no expensive hobbies or indulgencies.\u00a0 No, I suspect he has been saving his allowance for some time.\u00a0 I have a feeling, from something his mother said, that the young man wanted to go abroad, but his stepfather wasn\u2019t in favour of the plan.\u00a0 So, if the commander had threatened to stop the allowance if the young man did go, then there would be ample reason for him to want to murder his stepfather.\u201d\n\u201cNo-one mentioned any of this.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure neither the young man, nor his mother, would be likely to admit to anything.\u00a0 And I may be wrong, but it\u2019s an avenue I believe worth pursuing.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Miss Marple.\u00a0 Once again, you\u2019ve been very helpful.\u00a0 Right, Lake, we have work to do.\u201d\u00a0 Slack stood up and headed for the door.\n\u201cInspector, don\u2019t you want to finish your drink before you go?\u201d\nSlack gave Miss Marple a rueful look.\u00a0 \u201cNo, thank you.\u00a0 I think I\u2019ve made enough false assumptions for one day.\u201d",
