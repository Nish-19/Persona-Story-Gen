She was heading to LCorp for her first day of work when a woman stumbled with her tray full of drinks. Hermione tried to get out of the way but wasn\u2019t quick enough, so the tray flew out of her hands.\n\u201cShoot, Miss Grant isn\u2019t going to be happy.\u201d The blonde looked down at the mess before looking up at the woman she ran into. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.

Kara Danvers.\u201d The woman beamed.\n\u201cYes, you can allow me to pay for those.\u201d Hermione held up her hand. \u201cbecause I was too close to you to allow you to clear past me.\u201d\nKara searched her brown eyes. \u201cBut I should buy you a drink instead.\u201d\nShe sighed as she took in the piercing blue eyes. \u201cHow about this?\u201d She tapped her chin. \u201cI tend to work through my lunches, and I need someone to remind me to eat.\u201d\n\u201cTsk, Hermione.\u201d Kara shook her head. \u201cYou sound like Lena Luthor.\u201d She laughed at her surprised look. \u201cShe does the same thing.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I knew I liked her for a reason,\u201d Hermione smirked. \u201cI work at LCorp in one of the labs.\u201d\n\u201cSplendid. I can bring both of you lunch and make sure that you eat.\u201d The blonde clapped happily.\n\u201cYou bring Lena lunch?\u201d Hermione arched her brow.\n\u201cYep,\u201d Kara popped the p. \u201cI had noticed that she was working too hard, so I sometimes make sure that she relaxes a bit, even if it\u2019s just a half hour.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d Hermione smiled. \u201cI love chicken salad sandwiches or salads of all sorts.\u201d\n\u201cGot it.\u201d She tapped her head.\n\u201cHere you go, miss and Kara.\u201d The girl interrupted them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Hermione.\u201d She smiled at the girl behind the counter as Kara returned the mop to its station. \u201cHow much?\u201d They settled the bill as the blonde carefully picked up the drink carrier from the counter. She grabbed her tea, and they went out of the caf\u00e9.\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you later, Hermione.\u201d Kara beamed at her.\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019m looking forward to it, Kara.\u201d Hermione waved as she walked towards LCorp.\nThe blonde stared for a moment until she realised that she was going to be late and took off in the opposite direction.",

I can\u2019t see my kids because I miss them?\u201d George smirked.\n\u201cDad, we left you a month ago.\u201d Freddie rolled his eyes.\n\u201cHave some Butterbeer, and I will show you why I wanted to see you both.\u201d George poured them both a drink from a pitcher.\n\u201cOkay, I have been studying for the NEWTS; I think Aunt Hermione would be proud,\u201d Freddie replied.\nGeorge just stared at him in shock. \u201cWho are you, and what have you done with my son?\u201d\n\u201cNothing; I just want to pass these final exams so I can help you with your business.\u201d Freddie defended himself.\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d George rubbed his hands. \u201cWhat about you, Roxie?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m studying my OWLs, but not as hard as Freddie here.\u201d She thumbed her brother.\n\u201cDon\u2019t let your Mother hear that.\u201d George chuckled as he noticed that they were done with their drinks. \u201cAre we ready, Freddie?\u201d\n\u201cDad!\u201d Freddie rolled his eyes, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\nThey all walked out of the pub, and George steered them towards the abandoned Zonko\u2019s Shoppe.\n\u201cHere, Freddie.\u201d George handed him a set of keys. \u201cGo on.\u201d\n\u201cDad?\u201d Fred looked confused as he opened the door.\n\u201cWelcome, Freddie, to our newest branch of WWW.\u201d George cheered. \u201cYou are to run it once you graduate from Hogwarts, and Roxanne can help you during school breaks.\u201d\n\u201cREALLY?\u201d Freddie perked up. \u201cMy shoppe!\u201d\n\u201cYes, son, I have watched you over the years absorbing the information on my baby, and you have earned the right to do this too.\u201d\n\u201cThank you!\u201d Freddie engulfed him in a hug. \u201cI love you, Dad.\u201d\n\u201cI love you, too, Freddie,\u201d George muttered. \u201cCome here, Roxanne.\u201d He pulled her into the hug as well. \u201cLove you both.\u201d\n\u201cDoes that mean I can decorate it any way I want?\u201d Freddie perked up.\n\u201cYes and no. You have to find something that is you and not house colours.\u201d George replied. \u201cWe can\u2019t show preference in a business.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, Dad!\u201d Freddie flicked his wand and cleared the place of all the cobwebs and dust. He flicked it again and painted the walls bright orange, making them all groan at the brightness. \u201cJust kidding.\u201d The final flick turned each wall a shade of the four houses of Hogwarts. \u201cNow, House Unity.\u201d\n\u201cBrilliant son!\u201d George clapped his shoulder. \u201cWe will officially open the first Hogsmeade visit next school year.\n\u201cSweet.\u201d Freddie beamed. \u201cI promise to do you right.\u201d\n\u201cI know you will, both of you.\u201d George grinned. \u201cNow go! Have fun!\u201d\n\u201cSee you when we get home!\u201d Freddie hugged him and gave him the key to lock up.\n\u201cThank you, Dad. You made his year.\u201d Roxanne smiled at her father.\n\u201cYou are welcome, my girl.\u201d George ushered her out the door. \u201cGo study.\u201d\n\u201cLove you!\u201d Dominique ran out the door and grabbed more quills before going back to school.",

Ever since the Ministry destroyed the Dementors, the prisoners got their souls back and have been escaping Azkaban prison more readily. The Auror division has been busy hunting the escapees. \u201cI followed his trail to here in Southwark part of London.\u201d\u00a0 She catches a glimpse of him running with a blonde woman. \u201cOh, great, someone I would need to obliviate.\u201d\n\u201cBARTY! STOP!\u201d The Doctor heard behind him but kept on running. \u201cBarty Crouch Jr, stop in the name of Scotland Yard!\u201d He glanced behind him and was surprised to see that the woman was looking at him.\n\u201cWait, Rose, I think this woman is confused.\u201d The two of them halted and turned around to face the young, bushy-haired woman. \u201cCan I help you, miss?\u201d\n\u201cBarty, don\u2019t play coy with me and let the woman go!\u201d Hermione commanded as she pulled out her wand and pointed it at them.\nThe Doctor was confused by the name. \u201cBut I am not this Barty fellow, miss?\u201d He raised his eyebrow.\n\u201cI am PC Granger, and I have been hunting you, Barty.\u201d Hermione huffed. \u201cI followed your trail to here.

Prove it.\u201d\n\u201cHmm\u2026ever heard of Torchwood.\u201d The Doctor inquired.\n\u201cNo, should I have?\u201d Hermione looked puzzled.\n\u201cHmm.. this is going to be tougher to prove.\u201d The Doctor tilted his head back.\nRose looked behind Hermione and saw a man who looked almost like a carbon copy of the Doctor. \u201cMiss, is that him behind you?\u201d\nHermione twirled around and yelled, \u201cStupefy! Incarcerous!\u201d\nShe caught Barty Crouch, Jr, unawares and was able to capture him before he could disappear again.\nShe turned back around and saw the surprised looks on their faces. \u201cListen, do I need to remove the scene from your head?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but does that mean you are an auror for the magical world?\u201d The Doctor questioned her.\n\u201cYes, I am. You do know the magical world?\u201d Hermione looked at him with a shocked look.\n\u201cI do, and I am surprised that I have a doppelganger wizard.\u201d The Doctor slowly approached the body. \u201cI can see now why you thought that I was him.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sorry about that.\u201d Hermione looked contrite. \u201cI have been hunting him and his ilk for days now.\u201d Hermione sighed as she stood him up. She smirked at his shocked look. \u201cI think I took him by surprise, or he was surprised to see you, Doctor.\u201d\n\u201cProbably the latter,\u201d The Doctor laughed. \u201cI have that issue sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I need to transport him back to the Azkaban prison, but we need to figure out a better system since we got rid of the Dementors.\u201d Hermione groaned.\n\u201cThose things are vile.\u201d The Doctor looked at her in surprise. \u201cWhere are they now?\u201d\n\u201cWe destroyed them somehow because all the lost souls returned to the prisoners,\u201d Hermione explained. \u201cI should let you both go on to whatever you two were doing.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, PC Granger. I live not far from here.\u201d Rose pointed to a tall building. \u201cWe were just about to go on another adventure.\u201d\n\u201cHave fun.\u201d Hermione slapped a portkey on Barty before turning it on. \u201cGoodbye!\u201d They disappeared.\n\u201cWell, now, that was weird.\u201d Rose looked at her Doctor.\n\u201cIt was strange to see someone look identical to you even if they are human.\u201d The Doctor laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\u00a0 They ran to the TARDIS.",

Help with something?\u201d\n\u201cNo, my dear child.\u201d Minerva sat down next to Hermione and patted her hand. \u201cI saw you run out of the hall and wanted to check on you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I should have realised that they would have noticed the change.\u201d Hermione sighed.\n\u201cYour parents?\u201d\n\u201cYes. They sent me a letter scolding me about reducing my teeth to normal size.\u201d Hermione started to cry again.\n\u201cOh dear.\u201d Minerva rubbed her back to comfort her. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Don\u2019t they work with teeth?\u201d\n\u201cYes, they do, but they said that I should be happy with how they looked instead of trying to get them fixed,\u201d Hermione grumbled. \u201cWhen I got hit with that spell, I took advantage of allowing Madame Pomfrey to shrink it a bit smaller.\u201d\nMinerva nodded.\n\u201cI sent them a picture of Viktor and me that Colin took during the Yule Ball, and of course, instead of telling me how beautiful I looked, they berated me for my teeth.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t they know about the spell hitting them?\u201d Minerva asked. Hermione shook her head. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cBecause they would have taken me out of here.\u201d Hermione looked up at her pleadingly. \u201cThey are still threatening it in the letter.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want me to send your parents a letter explaining what happened?\u201d The professor inquired.\n\u201cNo, I will talk to them after the year is through.\u201d Hermione sighed.\n\u201cIf you run into problems, please message me, and I will come to help.\u201d Minerva patted her hand.\n\u201cThank you, Professor McGonagall.\u201d Hermione smiled.\n\u201cYou are welcome, Miss Granger. Let\u2019s get you something to eat before classes start.\u201d Minerva stood up.\n\u201cGood idea. One piece of toast isn\u2019t enough for my learning fuel.\u201d Hermione rose and pushed her chair in. \u201cThank you for checking on me, professor.\u201d\n\u201cI need to prepare for my first class. Please eat.\u201d Minerva and Hermione split ways at the staircase.\n\u201cSee you later, professor.\u201d Hermione waved as she went down the stairs to find Harry waiting with a small stack of toast as she had done for him. \u201cThanks, Harry.\u201d Hermione beamed.\n\u201cBetter?\u201d Harry sounds concerned.\n\u201cYes, the letter upset me, but I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Hermione took a bite.\n\u201cGood.\u201d Harry flashed her a smile as they walked out the door for the Care for Magical Creatures class.",

        "comment": "Hermione\u2019s Search\nBy: SnarkyGranger1\nHermione Granger was travelling in the southern part of the United States when she came upon a mystery bookstore in North Vercherie, Louisiana. \u201cDinkley\u2019s Mystery Shoppe.\u201d She read the sign. \u201cThat sounds promising.\u201d Hermione walked into the store, setting off the little bell above the door.\n\u201cHello, welcome to Mystery Inc.\u2019s Bookstore.\u201d A woman of average height, wearing a baggy orange sweater with a pleated red skirt, knee socks and Mary Jane shoes. She had on square glasses, which was a change from Harry\u2019s round ones.\n\u201cHi, I am looking for a particular mystery book.\u201d Hermione smiled at the woman.\n\u201cYou came to the right place.\u201d The woman beamed. \u201cMy name is Velma Dinkley, the owner of this place.\u201d\n\u201cHi, Velma. I am Hermione Granger.\u201d They shook hands. \u201cI have been travelling the country for two weeks on vacation to find this book and haven\u2019t had much luck.\u201d\n\u201cWhich book are you searching for?\u201d Velma moved around the counter to help her. \u201cAre you British?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I am.\u201d Hermione smiled. \u201cI have been collecting Agatha Christie books and trying to buy their first editions if possible.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I have one or two of her books, but I am not positive that they are first.\u201d Velma walked towards the back of the store. \u201cI keep my rare editions back here along this wall. It helps me keep an eye on them.\u201d She pointed to a hidden video camera.\n\u201cSmart idea, Velma.\u201dHermione praised her as Velma opened a caged door. \u201cThe book that I am looking for is \u2018The Thirteen Problems\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cOh, Miss Marple\u2019s first appearance.\u201d Velma perked up as she removed a book from the shelf and opened the book to see the copyright. \u201cIt says nineteen twenty-seven.\u201d\nHermione beamed at Velma. \u201cThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the first edition. I can\u2019t believe you have it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m actually surprised no one wanted this sooner because Miss Marple is a fan favourite of Christie\u2019s works.\u201d Velma closed the gate. \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, and you tell me what the other book is that you thought might be a first edition.\u201d Hermione quirked her eyebrow.\n\u201cOh, yes. Let\u2019s see.\u201d Velma reopened the gate, ran her fingers along the spine, and pilfered the book off the shelf. \u201cHere we go, Hermione!\u201d Velma handed her a book.\nHermione took it, and her eyebrow rose at the title. \u201cMurder in the Calais Coach?\u201d Hermione tilted her head as she thought about it. \u201cWait, is this the American version, and it had a different name for the first edition?\u201d\n\u201cYes, very good. I was curious to see if you did your research.\u201d Velma broadly smiled. \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, and I was the research queen in school,\u201d Hermione smirked.\n\u201cI was, too!\u201d Velma grinned. \u201cIt drove everyone in my group crazy.\u201d\n\u201cMine, too!\u201d Hermione shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll take these and want to know if you want to go for coffee?\u201d\n\u201cCoffee sounds good right now.\u201d Velma took the two books to the counter and rang them up for Hermione. \u201cHow will you be paying?\u201d\n\u201cCredit card, please.\u201d Hermione pulled at her black Gringotts card that had a British bank name on it. \u201cIt will take me a few paychecks, but it\u2019ll be worth it.\u201d\n\u201cJinkies!\u201d Velma swiped the card and had her sign the slip before putting it under the till drawer. \u201cLet me lock the drawer up in the back, and we can go down the street for good coffee.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want me to step out?\u201d Hermione pointed to the door.\n\u201cNo, I trust you.\u201d Velma took the cash drawer, went into the office, and locked it into the safe. She locked the door to the office and met her by the main door. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\nWhen they exited the store, Velma flipped the sign and locked the door. \u201cI am ready for a break anyway.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s good.\u201d Hermione smiled. \u201cWhich way?\u201d\n\u201cThis way to a local coffee shop. They brew the best coffee and doughnuts in the area.\u201d Velma steered her to the left.\n\u201cBrilliant.\u201d Hermione smiled as they walked down the street. It was the start of their friendship that lasted for years to come.\nVelma was so happy to find a kindred spirit to share her favourite books.",

Hermione opened the map and tapped it with her wand. \u201cI solemnly swear I am up to no good.\u201d The map slowly appeared on the blank paper. Hermione started to search for a particular person. She almost couldn\u2019t find her. Hermione\u2019s eyes widened when she realised that the person was right outside her room. She dashed to the portrait and opened it.\n\u201cLavender!\u201d\n\u201cHermione!\u201d\n\u201cPlease come in.\u201d\nLavender floated into the room and looked around. \u201cNice room, Hermione.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Hermione tapped the paper again. \u201cMischief Managed.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s how Harry, Ron and I managed to stay out of trouble most of the time.\u201d Hermione shook her head.\n\u201cAh. I kept seeing Harry looking at it at times.\u201d Lavender nodded. \u201cEven Ron was playing with it when we were dating.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Hermione looked up at her, expression changing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Lavender looked confused.\n\u201cI said that I\u2019m sorry, Lavender. I failed you.\u201d\n\u201cHermione, you didn\u2019t fail me.\u201d\u00a0 Lavender shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault that I died.\u201d\n\u201cBut I got that werewolf off of you. I should have made sure that you got help before I dashed away.\u201d\n\u201cListen, Hermione, I\u2019m not mad at you. You were in a tough situation, and I imagine you were going somewhere specific before you helped me.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I was, but it still doesn\u2019t excuse me from actually saving you from bleeding to death.\u201d Hermione slumped on the bed.\n\u201cRubbish.\u201d\nHermione looked up in surprise.\n\u201cThere were plenty of other people around, Hermione, who could have helped, including one of our professors.\u201d Lavender expounded as she stepped closer to her. \u201cI want to thank you, though.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! Why?\u201d Hermione\u2019s voice raised.\n\u201cBecause you did momentarily help me, just enough to get him off of me and allowed me to die in peace amongst the rubble.\u201d Lavender went to move Hermione\u2019s hair and forgot that she couldn\u2019t.\nHermione shivered at Lavender\u2019s cold hand going through her. \u201cI always forget how cold ghosts are.\u201d Then she looked up. \u201cAre ghosts cold?\u201d\n\u201cI might feel cold to you, but we really aren\u2019t.\u201d Lavender shook her head. \u201cPlease, Hermione, don\u2019t feel guilty. If I had survived, I would have felt like I owed you a life debt.\u201d\n\u201cA lift debt?\u201d Hermione tilted her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t think those still existed anymore.\u201d\n\u201cThey do, and I would like you to do me a favour, please.\u201d Lavender looked hopeful.\n\u201cAnything?\u201d Hermione sat up straight.\n\u201cCan you please go see Parvati and make sure that she\u2019s okay?\u201d Lavender sagged. \u201cI miss my best friend, and I know she probably misses me, too.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I will. When we have the next break, I\u2019ll go and visit her and Padma. Neither of them came back this year. Actually, not many did.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder if they went to a different school to finish.\u201d Lavender pondered.\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s possible, and I didn\u2019t go that route because I wanted to finish here where I started.\u201d Hermione dipped her head.\n\u201cGood for you, Hermione!\u201d Lavender smiled at her. \u201cGo and show this magical world what you are made of!\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Lavender.\u201d Hermione beamed at her. \u201cI\u2019ll let you out unless you want to go through the door.\u201d\n\u201cOpen it, please?\u201d When Lavender replied, there was a knock on the portrait. \u201cOh, someone is here.\u201d\nHermione went over and opened it, and it revealed Ginny and Luna. \u201cHey, girls, come in.\u201d\nGinny and Luna came in and stopped when they saw Lavender. \u201cHey, Lavender. Are we interrupting something?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it was perfect timing because I have to go.\u201d Lavender floated closer to the portrait and waited for Hermione to open it. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cAnytime. I\u2019ll let you know if I hear anything.\u201d Hermione smiled at her lost dormmate. \u201cGood night.\u201d\nLavender floated out, and Hermione shut it.\n\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Ginny asked.\n\u201cOh, just clearing some air between us, and she asked me a small favour, which I\u2019ll do later.\u201d Hermione grinned at her two friends. \u201cSo, what are we doing tonight?\u201d\nLuna and Ginny started talking about some ideas that they had as Hermione listened.\nThank you, Lavender, for soothing my mind.",
