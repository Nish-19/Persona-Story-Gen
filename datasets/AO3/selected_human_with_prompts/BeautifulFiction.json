        "comment": "Pig's bones, runes, the obscurity of tarot: there were many tools with which Alan Deaton had learned to divine the future. All of them, he knew to treat with respect. They had ways of distilling the murk of possibility to portend the most likely path. He had turned to such methods more than once in his life, yet as he stood there in his veterinary surgery, watching Stiles Stilinski and Derek Hale snipe at each other, he needed no such assistance. He could see the path before them as clear as day.\nOf course, nothing was written in stone. A twist of fate could change everything, and yet as he observed them, he suspected that their destiny had a deep foundation. He witnessed the sharp edges and hurts that only time could heal, but he also saw that perhaps that day was closer than any of them might anticipate. Already, they had made progress, moving from a relationship based on nothing but intimidation and sarcasm. Now, he could see how they were starting to slot together, still striking sparks, perhaps, but learning to shore up one another's weaknesses and acknowledge their strengths.\nRelief was not an emotion he often entertained, yet in that moment, Alan allowed himself to relish the rush of it. What had happened to the Hale pack, and to Beacon Hills as a result, was nothing short of a calamity. The balance, once held in such perfect equilibrium, had tumbled into chaos, embellished with the agony of grief. Derek had not been born to lead, and yet despite his trauma, he faced the challenges before him. Still, Alan had feared he would struggle through his life in solitude. A lone wolf.\nThat seemed less likely, these days. A year ago, Alan would have been confident to place a sizable bet on such an outcome. Now, it seemed he would have lost, and he was glad for it. He had not wished to see Talia Hale's last surviving son fade to nothing but an echo of himself. He wanted to witness Derek seize both his heritage and his future with both hands. He wished to see him engage, rather than drifting through life, falling from one disaster to the next. He knew the apathy that, until recently, had haunted those hazel eyes, and he knew what lay at its end.\nExcept it seemed that Stiles had changed all that. Derek looked at him, and his face came alive. All that cold distance and bitter indifference fell to the wayside, revealing the vulnerable, hurting, healing man that lay beneath. Now, Derek was almost fanatical in his efforts to keep Stiles safe. Deaton had seen, with his own eyes, how Stiles had become Derek's number one priority, and it was a focus that Stiles returned in equal measure. Despite their differences and their arguments, time and again, they chose each other.\nNow, he saw them growing closer, the snarls losing their ferocity and the jibes their sharpness. They touched each other more. Stiles had initiated that, which was a bold move, as Derek hardly welcomed physical contact, but where he might flinch from others, he reached for Stiles in turn. Shoves softened to nudges, and grasping hands smoothed to flat palms, holding one another steady. Enmity found its truce as friendship set its roots, and now it hovered on the brink of something more.\nOh yes, Alan could see the future there, as plain as day.\nDerek Hale and Stiles Stilinski. A werewolf and his mate.",

        "comment": "Kakorrhaphiophobia - The fear of failure\nDerek Hale was a failure. Sometimes it felt as if everything he touched turn to ash. First, there had been Paige, her body trembling in his arms as she rejected the bite, her eyes bright with pain as the last breaths lurched in her chest. Then there was his family, trapped and burned alive by Kate Argent and her treachery. She may have been the one to set the fire, but he had given her the opportunity. He had trusted a grown woman, one who would have had no interest in a boy like him. He had been naive, and his family were dead as a result.\nLaura. He hadn't even been able to protect Laura.\nThere were days when he knew it would be easier if he just stopped trying. Just stopped caring. Maybe if the only one who had ever been hurt by his failures was himself, it wouldn't matter so much.\nBut people had died.\nHe could have been a lone wolf, an Alpha without a pack. That felt preferable to having others rely on him to lead, where every choice he made could end in disaster. Yet in the end, some small part of him rebelled. That piece of him that still looked for the family he had lost, even now, would not let him give up.\nBecoming an Alpha was a massive strain, both physically and psychologically. It shoved every Wolf instinct he'd ever had to the fore, leaving him struggling against his more basic instincts. The need to gather a pack had been a driving force, and in the end, it had overcome his fear of what the future could hold.\nHis Wolf chose his pack, and his humanity rationalised his decisions. Erica, Boyd and Isaac all had need. The bite could help with their health, their isolation, their abuse. It gave strength to those who needed it. His humanity said he was helping them. His Wolf snarled that they were the people least likely to refuse or reject him. No one, after all, would really be in his pack if they had any other choice.\nExcept that it turned out, none of it was that simple. Nor did a pack just emerge, fully formed and functional. It was all about negotiation. He had to learn about his betas: their strengths and weaknesses. Erica was determined and loyal, but impulsive. Boyd was an excellent strategist but prone to overthinking, and Isaac? Isaac would have laid down his life for any one of them, because he'd been taught that he was worthless.\nSnarling and dominance didn't work. He knew that, and he had to bite back the urge time and again. Sometimes he even succeeded. It was rough going at first, but eventually, he began to pull together the shattered pieces of his life, and the betas came with him. They put the train depot behind them and moved into the loft, which was still pretty Spartan, but at least the roof didn't leak. Gradually, it went from being a shell of a place to something like home, with mismatched sofas and a temperamental TV, comfortable beds and a fridge stuffed to over-flowing.\nAnd at some point, it had become far more than a den for wolves.\nDerek stood in the kitchen, staring at the gaggle of teenagers currently sprawled around and fighting over what movie to watch. There were textbooks left open on the coffee table. Forgotten, screwed up essays and battle plans littered the carpet like malformed snowballs. There were nail-polish bottles and magazines, bags and sports equipment. The place was a mess, but it was a happy one. There was laughter and teasing and the simple joy that came from being alive and understood.\nIn them, he had found something worth protecting, and he would never let them down.",

A lord, even a disgraced one with no bloody horse, would not stoop to mere walking.\n---\nGwaine muses on what it is to find a home.",
        "comment": "Peregrinate - to travel or wander from place to place.\nGwaine didn't need much. A bit of coin in his pocket and some ale in his belly was enough to inspire contentment. All the other things people tended to seek \u2013 a home, friends, lovers who stayed longer than one night, a family \u2013 they held little interest for him. They tied him down. He'd rather be free and easy, without a responsibility in the world. That way when his life went to shit, there was no one to blame but himself.\nHe hadn't started out like that, of course. No one did. He'd been a kid once, with dreams and ideals. He'd thought of being a knight under the king's banner. He'd known it was his calling. Right up until the day it turned out that a knight should be loyal, but a king need not bother.\nHis pa died in a battle he should never have fought, and he and his ma were left with nothing. He didn't blame his mother for following her love to the grave. He would have done the same, if all he had left to keep him in the world was a life of poverty and a son full of rage.\nLeaving was the easiest choice. It didn't matter where he was or what was happening, he had learned to go before he wore out his welcome. He wandered \u2013\nperegrinated\n\u2013 he remembered that from his tutors. After all, only commoners walked places. A lord, even a disgraced one with no bloody horse, would not stoop to mere walking.\nHe had to admit it sounded better in his head. It sounded purposeful. Better than the truth, anyway, which was that he fell from one tavern to the next, either charming or punching anyone who took offence at his presence.\nThat was how he ended up in a brawl, a knife wedged in his thigh and hurting like the blazes. That was how he came 'round later to a sweet, dark-haired lad with the brightest smile he'd ever seen, and a blond pillock who swung a sword as easy as if it were breathing.\nIn his defence, Gwaine had always given Camelot a wide berth. It was a troubled land, from all that he'd heard, so he could forgive himself for not immediately recognising Prince Arthur. Still, just because he didn't know his precise name or title didn't mean he couldn't read the breeding in him. He was a noble through-and-through, with all the arrogance that went with it.\nIf not for Merlin, he would probably have limped away there and then. He'd never have gone to Camelot. He'd certainly never have gone back once he left the first time, eager to get away before the friendship could lose its shine.\nIf not for Merlin, he'd not have had this life, and it would have been a crying shame.\nThese days, he was a knight on his own terms, not because of the blue in his blood, but because he was good with a sword. He had friends who joked and smiled and teased, but always with a fondness that robbed their words of any sharpness.\nLeon was gracious, and Gwaine had never met a more steadfast man. Elyan was always there to talk to and never held any judgement for the stupid mistakes Gwaine made, even now. Lancelot's compassion put them all to shame, yet he never made them feel bad for their petty, human thoughts. He made them better men, of that Gwaine was certain. Percival was a wonder. He could probably stop a charging bull with his bare hands, but Gwaine had never known a more gentle soul.\nThey'd die for each other. He just hoped it never came to that.\nHe didn't think it would. For all that he was a prat, Arthur was one of the few good royals Gwaine had ever met. A man had to dig deep to reveal his kindness \u2013 because that bastard father of his had taught him all the callous cruelty that came with power \u2013 but it was there. All it needed was someone to let him know, in all the subtle little ways, that compassion was a strength, not a weakness, and that being a decent human being wouldn't make him a bad king.\nThat was Merlin's job. Well, that and keeping the rest of them on their toes. He could have been like one of the breathless pages, chasing after the knights with hero worship in his eyes. He could have been an obsequious little toad, always looking to ingratiate himself to his so-called superiors. Thank the gods that he was anything but.\nHe poked holes in Arthur's ego and made sure none of them ever got too big for their britches. He pointed out when any single one of them was being a fool, often with a glimmer of absolute glee.\nHe reminded them that, underneath all the trappings of rank, they were men at heart, all made of the same stuff and all of equal value.\nGwaine had spent years travelling the realms and calling it freedom, ignoring the loneliness that consumed him like rot. Now, he had friends who were as good as any family. They knew him. Not just the jokey facade he put on to please the world, but what lay underneath. He no longer had to roam, looking for something and denying it all the while.\nHe'd found home, and it wasn't a place like he'd always believed. It was the people who proudly claimed him as theirs, the bad bits, as well as the good.\nHis wandering days were over.",

        "comment": "The Shire had never known such fuss as it did the day Bilbo Baggins went tearing out of the door on his so-called adventure. It was like a great boulder falling into a calm pool, sending shock-waves throughout Hobbiton. His was the name on everyone's lips, and their whispers teetered wildly between envy and disdain. Who would have thought it? The staid, sensible Baggins boy, losing his head like that and dashing off in the company of\ndwarves?\nLobelia sniffed, idly checking her reflection in a polished pan at the market stall and adjusting the plume on her hat. It was a foofaraw: as if anyone cared about what became of him! He had been living by himself in that massive Smial for decades now, hoarding the family silver and content in his confirmed bachelorhood.\nNo, Bilbo Baggins could saunter off into the great wide world and never come back, for all she cared. That branch of the family had always been odd. Too much Took, perhaps. Better for the Shire as a whole that they were no longer skulking up on that hill while everyone else fooled themselves into thinking that they were respectable.\nShe smiled to herself. Respectable hobbits did not rush off without warning. They did not abandon pride and property to hare off over the horizon with barely a word to anyone. He'd left no instruction about Bag End. She doubted he'd even paused to clean out the pantry!\nWell, she would see to that. She would step forth as a benevolent custodian to the place (and the family silver). A year and a day; that was all she needed. If Bilbo Baggins did not set foot back in the Shire in that time, then he would lose all legal claim, and she would be perfectly positioned to swoop in and take possession.\nFor the good of the community, of course.\nIf she had thought that the West Farthing was making a fuss about nothing the day Bilbo Baggins left, it paled in comparison to the uproar that swept through the land the day they were delivered news of his fate. People were meeting in the lane \u2013\nin the lane!\n\u2013 to talk about it, as if they were common farmers without a parlour between them! His was the name on every pair of flapping lips, and each time the tale reached her ear it had only seemed to grow more outlandish: armies and dragons, elves and orcs!\nAs if Bilbo Baggins had the courage to say boo to a goose!\n'Ah, Lobelia. There you are.'\nShe paused with one hand on the gate to Bag End, her chest heaving from her fast-march along the road to check on the Smial, as she did every day. There were a mere three weeks remaining before she could lay a legal claim.\nIt had been an exercise of patience to don the mask of a concerned relative and say she was tending it in Bilbo's absence while she kept an eye on what would soon be hers. Now, she found the Mayor of Michel Delving standing at her front door, along with Primula Baggins and her husband Drogo.\nBitter unease unfurled through her chest, and she pinned a smile upon her face that felt more like a snarl.\n'Mayor! What brings you here?'\nHe looked at her with twinkling eyes that suggested her affable mask was not as well-placed as she might like. He was a Bolger, on his mother's side, she recalled. Far too sharp for anyone's comfort.\n'The matter of Bag End. You see, we have received a letter from Master Bilbo Baggins as to his likely permanent absence from the Shire. It includes instruction from him with regard the dispersal of his assets.' The mayor smiled as if he were enjoying a good joke as he pulled a sheaf of papers from his breast pocket. 'He has included an itemised list. I am here to offer my personal thanks for your custodianship of the property and to inform you that your services will no longer be required.'\nA strangled protest caught in Lobelia's throat. The collar of her blouse felt far too tight, and her grip on the gate-post threatened to crack the aged wood. 'Instruction?' she wheezed, 'But \u2013'\n'It was a true kindness for you to step forward and take care of Master Baggins' property in his absence, unasked,' the mayor continued breezily. 'But now that it seems he has chosen to stay in Erebor with his husband, the matter of the dispersal of his holdings must be put to rest in line with his wishes.'\n'Husband?' She squinted, her bonnet wobbling precariously as she tilted her head. 'I didn't hear anything about a husband...'\n'Ah, yes.' The mayor retrieved his monocle, squinting down at the papers before him and moving a ribbon to one side, careful not to disturb the hefty seal that swung from it like a pendulum. Behind him, Primula Baggins smothered a smile, as if she were enjoying the wretched man's performance. It was clear he had no need to check the identity of this so-called husband. Officious, bothersome busybody of a bureaucrat!\n'One King of Erebor, Thorin II. It seems that Bilbo's adventure had a happy ending, for all those who deserved such things.' Something sharp glinted in the mayor's gaze, and Lobelia was abruptly reminded that the Bolgers had been nursing a ridiculous feud with the Sackvilles over a tract of land that no Bolger could prove any rightful claim to, because the Sackvilles had \"mislaid\" the paperwork.\nAs was their prerogative.\n'Bag End is to go to Bilbo's closest surviving relatives, Drogo and Primula Baggins, as are all the contents therein, and anything that may have been removed from the premises during his absence. He has charged me with seeing this matter to its resolution.'\n'We just need the keys, Lobelia,' Primula said, her youthful face all smiling innocence and hidden cunning. She was a Brandybuck before she was married: out for all they could get. Then there was Drogo, who gave the impression of being an affable, easy-going young man. He had watched the whole exchange in placid silence, and now he met her gaze with neither expectation or accusation.\nTry as she might, she could see no way out of it. Perhaps if Primula and Drogo had merely attempted to claim the smial as theirs, she could have fought it. Yet without the rule of law, there was no civilisation, and she could not very well lean on it herself one day only to turn her nose up at it the next. Not without gaining the kind of reputation that put even a hobbit to shame.\nShe considered it, though. For long moments, she contemplated her options. She thought of a hobbit, in the singular, who had lived in a smial big enough for a family of twelve while she and Otho had made do. She thought of her reputation, which carried its own share of tarnish. She knew what people said behind her back, as if they weren't all as greedy as each other, and for once in her life she chose the wiser course.\nThe key felt light in her hand as she handed it over to Primula, placing it neatly in to her waiting palm. It was not surrender, she told herself. Not precisely. It was a tactical retreat. Perhaps, in time, Bag End would come to her regardless.\n'Thank you,' Primula murmured, closing her fingers around the key before ducking her head. 'There was one other thing Cousin Bilbo said. He knows you always admired the family silver. He wanted you to have it, with his thanks.'\nA waspish retort that Bilbo Baggins had never offered her a word of thanks in his life hovered on the tip of her tongue, but she swallowed it back, inclining her head as Primula stepped inside to retrieve the box. It settled, heavy, in Lobelia's arms, and in its weight she wondered if she felt something like an ending.\nShe had spent most of her life helplessly resenting Bilbo Baggins, and yet here she was, in the Shire still, while he had moved on to better things. Maybe, in the end, there was nowhere else either of them would rather be. Her, here, in the land she had always called her home, and him, in far off parts, where every day was another little adventure.\nIn the privacy of her head, she grudgingly wished him well, and then went home to polish up the silver.",

It was not just the dinner that was sumptuous. Arthur and Morgana were both dressed in their finest, with precious metal and jewels sparkling on fingers or at the turn of their wrists. Arthur had a bracelet polished to such a shine that it dazzled Merlin every time he held out his goblet to be refilled. The end result was that he was standing at Gwen's side, weary, hungry, and with a headache growing at his temples.\n'What, exactly, is it?' Gwen murmured, utilising that servant-ly skill of speaking out of the side of her mouth. Merlin envied her. If he tried to do that he slurred like a drunkard.\n'What?'\n'That. In the middle. Near the carrots.'\nMerlin squinted at it. He had vague memories of the cook tenderising something, her biceps bulging with every swing as she explained to an under-cook what she was doing.

Serving at feasts was a long, boring, thankless duty. His belly grumbled and his feet ached, but Gwen's giggle at least made it a little more bearable.\n'And that?' she asked, 'near the trifle?'\n'Pear and apple pie.'\n'Would that be pepple or papple?' she said innocently, biting her lip as Merlin snorted. 'I don't care what it's made of,' she confessed a moment later. 'I just wish they would hurry up and eat so I could go home.'\nMerlin hummed in agreement, not sure what he needed more: a good meal or the comfort of his bed. Somehow, he suspected neither need would be fulfilled soon. He had a horrible feeling he'd forgotten to restock Gaius' herbs. That was sure to earn him The Eyebrow.\nA quick glance at the high windows of the hall made him swear under his breath. Night was already well-advanced. He was used to hunting down plants in the dark, but if he didn't get started soon, he wouldn't get the task done before Arthur required him for morning duties.\n'Are you all right?' Gwen whispered.\n'Just remembered that Gaius urgently needed some Evening Primrose. I meant to get it earlier, but \u2013' He trailed off, gesturing at the feast with one hand. 'I didn't have time.'\nGwen made a sympathetic noise of understanding, shifting her weight onto one foot and wriggling the other to get the blood flowing back to her toes. 'Maybe Arthur will sleep in?'\nMerlin made a doubtful noise. Prince Prat had been moderate in his drinking tonight, which meant he was probably planning an early training session. If so, he'd want to be awakened not long after sunrise, regardless of how late he stayed up tonight.\nIt was another candle-mark before Morgana excused herself, smiling as she was waved off with a benevolent hand from Uther. Gwen shot Merlin a sympathetic look, surrendering her wine-jug to someone else and resting a hand on his elbow in brief comfort. A moment later, she was gone, following meekly in Morgana's wake.\nThankfully, Arthur followed her example not much later, and Merlin breathed a quiet sigh of relief as he followed him up to his chambers, bustling about his duties on aching feet as he prepared the prince for bed. He listened to him complaining about the splendour of the feast when their granaries were running low and nodded at the correct intervals. He did not miss the opportunity to point out how much Arthur had eaten, giving him a subtle prod in his (flat, toned) waist and laughing when Arthur tried to swat him in response.\n'Good night, Sire,' he murmured at last, pausing at the door to look back into the shadows of the room. Arthur managed a sleepy mumble from where he was cocooned safe and warm within his bed, and Merlin ignored his stab of jealousy. It would be a while yet before he found his rest, if he managed it at all.\nWith a lantern in one hand and the bag for collecting herbs slung over his shoulder, he made his way out of the gate, nodding to the sentries. The men gave him pitying looks, but they noted his departure. If nothing else, it was a matter of safety. That way if Merlin didn't return, they would at least know where he had been heading.\nIt was a long, dark, damp sort of night, where the air itself felt like the breath of some great beast. Merlin spent hours traipsing around, tripping over more than once. By the time he had all that he needed, dawn was a silver line upon the horizon and he had acquired half-a-dozen new bruises to his name.\nBlinking gritty eyes, Merlin resigned himself to a day spent half-asleep as he slogged back into Camelot, the braziers lighting the way with their cheery glow. He yawned as he entered the courtyard, blinking stupidly when a small figure stopped in front of him, forcing him to stumble to a halt.\nGwen's smile was all sympathetic dimples, and in her hand, offered up like ambrosia, was a slice of the papple pie, steaming softly in the morning chill. 'I almost lost my hand grabbing you a slice,' she explained. 'I thought you'd like it more than the scraps of bork.'\n'You're a goddess.' Merlin beamed at her before guiding her over to the rim of the well. Prizes like this were made to be shared, and none deserved it more than Gwen, who was thoughtful to the core. They perched on the stonework, passing the single fork back and forth between them as they demolished the buttery crust and the fruity innards. As they did so, the sun began to show its face, painting the cool blues of the sky in pink and gold.\n'You didn't have to do this. You must have been up late.'\n'Not as late as you,' she chided, her voice soft as she relieved him of the empty plate. 'Maybe let George look after Arthur today?'\n'I can't do that,' Merlin murmured. 'He'll have my job out from under me in a heartbeat.'\nGwen snorted. 'A year ago, you would have been delighted to be free of Arthur's servitude.'\n'Yeah, well... Now I'm not so sure Arthur could actually survive without me, and I don't need to live with that kind of guilt.' Merlin grinned, rolling his eyes as the morning bell chimed through the citadel. 'He may be Prince Prat, but he's sort of grown on me. Like mould.'\n'Oh, hush. You love him really.'\n'Yeah,' Merlin deadpanned. 'I adore being insulted and getting things thrown at my head on a daily basis. What's not to love?'\n'Well,' Gwen began, 'if you want to avoid that sort of thing, you could try such novel ideas as being on time, and actually doing the chores Arthur asks of you?'\n'Where would be the fun in that?' He hopped down from the rim of the well, the bag of herbs thumping against his hip as his mirth fell away into something softer. 'Thanks for this, Gwen. I mean it. And hey, the papple pie wasn't bad. Maybe the cook's onto something?'\n'Better than the bork, anyway.' She grinned, holding out her hand. 'Give that to me.' She gestured to the bag. 'I'll drop it off with Gaius. My lady won't awaken for a while, yet. I doubt you're going to be equally blessed.'\nAs if summoned by her words, there was the distinctive sound of one of the lead-paned windows being opened, and he winced as Arthur's distinctive bellow shattered the tranquillity.\n'\nMer\n-lin!'\nGwen laughed at the expression on his face, ushering him away with a wave of her hand. With one last grin, Merlin darted off. Life in Camelot could be a trial. Between looking after Arthur and keeping his secret, there were times he wondered why he had not set the citadel to his back months ago, but it was days like today that reminded him why he stayed.\nIn the end, it had nothing to do with dragons or destiny, and everything to do with the friends he had made. Friends like Gwen, Morgana and even, he supposed, Arthur. Despite everything, Camelot had become the place he called home.\nAnd that would never change.",
        "writing_prompt": "After a long night of gathering herbs for Gaius, Merlin returns to Camelot only to be greeted by Gwen with a stolen slice of pie and Arthur's bellowing voice echoing through the courtyard\u2014just another day in the life of a servant with a secret destiny."

        "comment": "Rebuilding Erebor was, at times, a journey of rediscovery. The fateful day the dragon came, it shattered Thorin's people and obliterated their home. Yet there was more to the mountain than gold and a place for a dwarf to lay his head. It was a cultural centre: one of the pillars of Dwarven history, and to lose it had struck the race as a whole a mighty blow. Now, as they peeled back the shadows of Smaug's occupation and reopened old rooms, those stories were steadily making their way back into the light.\nPerhaps, if not for Bilbo, he would not notice how much they reclaimed day-by-day. After all, the dwarves remembered the broad-strokes of their own stories, if not the details. They did not need explanations, but to Bilbo it was all unknown. He was hungry to immerse himself in a world that was utterly new, and through him, Thorin saw it all with fresh eyes.\n'This is... incredible.' Bilbo stood with his head tilted back, eyeing the vast mural they had uncovered. It had been obscured by the accumulation of dust and cobwebs, the filth blurring the stone even as the shadows hid it from sight. Now, lamps and braziers threw off the darkness, and clean water had cast aside the shroud of the years to reveal what lay beneath.\nShades of gold and jade, silver and cobalt gleamed as bright as the day they had been set into the wall. It was the line of Durin, their family tree set out in complete clarity, going back through the ages to a time long before Erebor or Khazad-d\u00fbm. Back into an era where fact bled into myth and grew grander in every retelling.\nThere were pictures, and Thorin smiled to see fragments of himself littered through the past. His nose there, on some distant relative. The particular twist of his hair there on another. Dwarves who looked uncannily like Fili cropped up more than once, and Kili's smile was a trait that ran true, tilted at that certain angle.\n'There is one of these in here for each of the Dwarven families of note that held good standing during my grandfather's time.' He stepped back, the better to take in the broad splay of it \u2013 admiring the depth of the colours and that sharpness of the outline. It was a miracle Smaug had not clawed it apart. He had believed some of this knowledge lost. 'I used to sit in here on my mother's knee as she told me about them: my ancestors. My blood-line.'\nHe looked over at Bilbo, seeing him standing on tiptoes and squinting upwards, trying to make out something in particular. Following his gaze, Thorin gave a huff of mirth. Of course, there was one person who stood out more than the others: dark-eyed, beardless... different. A young woman who had become a queen and then slowly vanished into family legend.\n'Who is she?' Bilbo asked, knowing Thorin was looking in the same direction. 'Other than absolutely not a dwarf.'\n'She was a dwarf in every way that mattered,' Thorin murmured in response, admiring the way the light struck Bilbo's russet curls to gold and caressed the swell of his cheeks. 'She was adored by her people and respected by all the lords of the land.'\n'But?'\n'But...' Thorin tilted his head in acknowledgement. 'She was not a dwarf by blood. Unfortunately, the history we still have, be it written or remembered, does not tell us her race. There were rumours. Stories. If they are true, they would be remarkable.'\nBilbo shifted closer, pressing his arm to Thorin's. 'I think stories are as real as you make them. One day, dwarves will probably wonder if we really freed a mountain from a dragon's tyranny, or if it\u2019s all a metaphor for something else. Or a complete fiction to help someone establish their personal glory.' He tilted his head towards the mural. 'So, tell me her story. The one you're not certain you believe.'\n'She lived a very long time ago, and she claimed the heart of one of my ancestors, back when our name was Duthin, not Durin. We still sing of their love in some of our oldest, most traditional songs, but while her devotion was remarkable, it was her sacrifice that stirred the hearts of many.'\n'Sacrifice?' Bilbo frowned, his mouth twisting in uncertainty. 'What did she give up?'\n'Everything that she was.' Thorin sighed. 'This is the part my mother told me. The part that sounds too fantastic to believe. When Mahal made the dwarves of the mountain, some of the souls he used escaped to live free of earthly ties. They are the spirits of the mountain. Some are bent to chaos, such as the Ithin, while others are the small blessings of a place: a light where none should shine. Then, there are the Peri.'\nBilbo cocked his head, inquisitive. He did not interrupt or demand to know more. Instead, he waited, watching Thorin with an open, interested gaze. In the torch-light, his betrothal bead sparkled, and something in Thorin's chest lurched, fierce and loving, at the sight.\n'They were \u2013 well, there are many stories, but the one most people believe is that the Peri are mischievous spirits. The ones who steal your tools when you're not looking or lead you astray, but they mean no harm by it. In fact, they are often the ones miners call upon in the direst circumstances, and sometimes, they answer. It is said that she rescued one of my distant forefathers from a landslide in the mountain mines. He was lost and alone in the deepest, living dark, and when he reached out a hand, she took it. They walked for days to reach the surface once more. He knew only her voice and the touch of her fingers.'\nThorin wet his lips, the story welling up in him, as pure and true as the day his mother had spoken of it. 'Yet a short way from salvation, he collapsed, too spent to move another step. He could not rise. He could not call out for help in the hopes that someone would come and find him. Instead, she carried him out, and in doing so she gave up that which made her a Peri.\n'Some say she was like a mithril mist: one that took a physical form in the sunlight. Others say she had wings, but they fell away when she stepped beneath the open sky. Another sliver of the story is she gave up an immortal, divine existence to walk the world at his side. There is much she is meant to have sacrificed for his survival, because she fell in love, down in the mountain's heart, and she could not bear to see him die.'\n'And he made her his queen.' Bilbo stared up at the mural once more, and Thorin could see how he drank in the sight of her \u2013 this person who was not a dwarf by birth, but had become one in every other aspect: loved and loving in turn. 'What was her name?'\nThorin could not help the curl of his smile. He did not put it past Bilbo to believe everything he had spoken, but there was one coincidence he suspected his hobbit would struggle to swallow. 'Bilba. Her name was Bilba.'\nHe chuckled as Bilbo huffed, shaking his head in disbelief. 'You're making that up.'\n'I'm not. I swear it upon my throne. I'd forgotten all about her and the stories my mother told, though there was something familiar about your name when I first heard it.' He turned to his hobbit, looking down into that doubtful face. The story of Bilba and her beloved may be more myth that anything else these days, but it still rang true. Now, he stood before the hobbit he loved \u2013 the one who would rule at his side once they were wed \u2013 and he thought of how much he had left behind.\nBilbo had given up his home, his kin and his life. He had abandoned everything he had ever known to follow Thorin on his own tortuous journey to reclaim his kingdom. He had bartered with elves for the lives of the line of Durin, and he had conquered a king's madness. Then, as if all that wasn't enough, he had offered Thorin his heart.\nBilbo had been his salvation in more ways than one, and Thorin would never allow himself to take that devotion for granted. Perhaps Bilba had given up everything to see that the dwarf she loved survived, but she had gained much in return for her sacrifice. She had been immortalised in song and myth, celebrated by the dwarf who loved her and all who came to know her name.\nAnd it would be no different for Bilbo. Erebor already loved him, and they would continue to do so long after he and Thorin went to their rest. His name would be written into their histories, with Thorin's alongside, and they would never truly be forgotten. Not until the unmaking of the world.\nAnd until then, they would live a long, happy life in each other's arms. Of that, Thorin had no doubt.",

        "comment": "'You're a\nsorcerer\n!'\nThe scent of laundry soap threatened to make him sneeze, and he eyed the empty warming pan in Gwen's hand with a healthy dose of trepidation. She looked like she was sorely tempted to throw it at his head. Her hair tumbled down around her face, and her eyes were alight with anger and no small trace of fear.\nIt had been brave of her to drag him in here to make her accusation, but now she looked as if she regretted it, and he hated to see the glimmer of terror on her face.\nThis was all Arthur's fault. He had to be the one to crow about it \u2013 about unicorns and the people they associated with: virgins and sorcerers. Arthur, of course, had delighted in ribbing Merlin about his supposed innocence, as if he hadn't lost his virginity years ago and miles away, back in Ealdor. The knights had joined in, because they could be right bastards sometimes, and Gwen had frozen in the act of helping him clear the dishes, staring at him from behind Arthur's back in abject horror.\nUnfortunately, while the knights were not very in tune with the castle gossip, the same could not be said for Guinevere, who had heard a thing or two and knew that Merlin was most certainly\nnot\na virgin.\nWhich left only one option.\n'Er...?'\nHe could lie. He could absolutely lie and say Arthur was talking out of his arse, as usual, but something told him Gwen wouldn't believe a word he said. She was ardent in her rage, almost incandescent with it, and he had a healthy dose of respect for her anger. She was no delicate maiden. Only Morgana scared him more, and it was a close-run thing.\n'You \u2013 you \u2013' Gwen's chest heaved, which in any other circumstance would be a pleasant sight. Right now, though, he couldn't be sure if she was dragging in breath to scream for the guards.\n'Gwen, please, I can explain!' He reached out a hand, and her flinch of retreat was enough to make him jerk back, apologies already frothing from his lips. 'It's \u2013 I \u2013 I use it for Arthur! You know what he's like, the danger he's always in. I use it to keep him safe. Him and Camelot! I haven't hurt anyone!' He winced at that, before quickly amending, 'At least, no one who didn't deserve it.'\nShe stared at him, the warming pan on its long handle held between them like a sword. He could see the whites of her eyes all the way around, and he shifted to the side so he wasn't standing between her and the door. It was an obvious gesture, and one that seemed to break through the sharpest edge of her uncertainty.\n'Are you\ninsane\n?' she demanded, her voice high and thin, muffled by the cloth stacked shelves around them. 'Merlin, they will kill you. They will find out, and they will kill you. You have to \u2013 you have to stop. Don't use it. Don't learn any more than you already have. Who even taught you? Don't they know the danger they're putting you in?' Her hair fluttered as she breathed hard. 'Not just from \u2013 from the King! Magic corrupts. It turns you evil.' The glimmer of tears embellished her lashes, her mouth wobbling horribly. 'Even if you're good now, you won't be in the end!'\nShe pressed the back of her hand to her lips, the warming pan going lax in her grip. Gently, Merlin stepped forward, keeping each movement slow as he relieved her of her makeshift weapon. It would be easiest to just agree with her, to lie and promise not to use it, but this was Gwen. He couldn't do that to her. Nor could he have her believing he was some sort of naive simpleton, dabbling in magic in a kingdom where it was outlawed.\n'You're wrong.' He said it softly, apologetically. 'About so many things. Gwen, no one taught me this. I've always had magic, since before I even cut my first tooth. If it was going to corrupt me, it would have done so by now. It's not \u2013 it's not bad.' His voice throbbed over the words, desperate, because he'd spent years hearing the whispers of others and fearing he was as monstrous as they all suggested. '\nI'm\nnot bad.'\nShe hiccupped, her nostrils flaring as she took in a deep breath through her nose. 'You already had magic when you came to Camelot?' she asked, shaking her head in slow disbelief. 'You came here knowing what you are? What could happen to you? You\nstayed\n?'\nBefore he could answer, the door opened, whispering on its hinges as Lancelot darted through the narrow gap, sallow and worried. His dark eyes went to Guinivere, his heart, as always, carried in their depths, but it was Merlin he reached for, clasping a hand over his shoulder and asking a hundred questions with a single glance.\n'Gwen's not stupid, unlike some people.' Merlin swallowed hard. 'She knows.'\n'Wait,' Gwen managed, barely hesitating as Lancelot shut the door firmly behind him. 'He knows?' She turned on Lancelot. 'You\nknew\nand you didn't tell me?'\n'It was not my secret to impart.'\n'And you!' She spun on Merlin, her hands clenched into fists at her side before she thumped him, hard, on the shoulder. 'You told Lancelot before you told me? I was the first friend you made in Camelot! I liked you when you were a sad, stinking boy in the stocks!'\n'Ow! Ow! It's not like I told either of you. You found out!' Merlin raised his hands to ward off any further blows, breathing out a sigh of relief when Gwen subsided, just a fraction.\n'When?' she narrowed her eyes at Lancelot in a manner that suggested he would be fortunate to share the pleasure of her kisses any time soon.\n'The griffin.' Lancelot's hands where still held out, appeasing. 'My lance burst into magical blue flame, and Merlin was the only one still standing to cast such a spell. He saved us, Guinevere. My blow would have done nothing to the beast if not for his help.'\n'That's \u2013 it's \u2013' She shook her head, slumping down onto a laundry chest as she stared blankly at the flagstones. It made Merlin's heart ache for her. She wasn't like Lancelot, worldly and well-travelled. She had lived in Camelot all her life. How many executions had she witnessed? How many times had magic attacked her home and threatened her safety? How many years had she listened to Uther's rhetoric on sorcerers and believed the words of her king?\nAnd yet, she still had not screamed for the guards.\n'He keeps us safe, Guinevere,' Lancelot promised. 'I don't know all that he has done, but it has been for us. For his friends. He would never offer us harm. If I thought him a danger to anyone, I would not have kept his secret. I would not have risked my life for him.'\nThat got Gwen's attention, and she blinked at him, realisation crumpling her features. 'The King would execute you too, for hiding what he is.'\n'It will never come to that.' Merlin said it with utmost certainty. He would enchant Lancelot into silence to save him if he had to. 'I won't let it. If I'm ever dragged to the pyre of the headsman, I will go alone.'\nGwen's brown skin took on a greyish tinge at that, and at last her eyes met his, looking at him as if she were searching for the man she knew in the face of a stranger. It was a desperate, heartfelt gaze, carrying with it the weight of the world, and Merlin saw the moment she found her resolve.\n'No. No, you won't, because that's not going to happen.' She brushed a hand over her face, dashing away the tears that had threatened, but never quite fallen. 'You're my friend. You always have been, and you always will be.' Her voice wobbled before she seemed to master it. 'I can't say I understand, or that I accept it \u2013 not yet. Not completely, but... But Merlin, I can't condemn you either. I don't think I ever could.'\nShe let out a tight sound as he reached for her hand, her grip surprisingly strong as she yanked him into an embrace. It was awkward, he had to bend over to get his arms around her, but there was strength there too: comfort and promise, and he let out a shaking breath of relief as he hugged her back.\n'Thank you. And if, somehow, my magic ever does corrupt me? I've got you and Lancelot to set me straight. One way or the other.'\nHe hunkered down, putting himself on Gwen's level so he could look into her eyes, hoping she could see his sincerity. He meant every word he said. It was not magic that corrupted people, but the power that came with it. If he ever fell victim to that, then he hoped his friends would have the strength to stop him.\n'Okay?'\nGwen swallowed, letting out a shuddering breath as she slowly nodded her head. Her hand gripped his, tight and fierce. 'Okay,' she agreed.\nDistantly, the sound of Gaius calling for him reached Merlin's ears, and he swore quietly. He'd promised to gather herbs, and now he looked over his shoulder at the door, wondering if he could possibly delay.\n'Go,' Gwen urged, pursing her lips until they bleached white. 'I'll be all right.'\n'You're sure?' He looked over at Lancelot, seeing the promise in his eyes. He wouldn't leave Gwen alone. He would provide a target for her questions and her ire.\n'Tell her whatever she wants to know,' Merlin said at last, giving Gwen a quick squeeze and straightening up, 'and if Lancelot doesn't have an answer, ask me. I'll \u2013 I'll answer honestly.' Even as he said it, he felt almost dizzy with the implications of it. Here were two people. bound to him not by blood, but by friendship: two accidental guardians to the secret that would see him dead.\nHe wanted to trust them \u2013 he\ndid\ntrust them, but... Well, there was always a \"but\".\n'Go,' Lancelot urged. 'Before Gaius sends out a search party.' Tentatively, he took a seat by Gwen on the chest, shoulder-to-shoulder, offering her everything: silent support or a willing punching bag on which she could vent her emotions.\n'All right, and thanks.' He included Gwen in his gratitude, knowing she would understand the depths of it. He wasn't just talking about this moment; he was speaking of the choice she had made. Uncertain she may be, but she had looked between the laws of Camelot and the life of a friend, and chosen the latter.\nHe only hoped that, one day, all his friends would do the same.",

She's getting thinner by the day. I fear she's not long left for the world: that they'll drive her to her death. I tried to make her leave for the Greenwood, thinking she'd be safer, but...'\n'But she won't go.' Bilbo's heart crumpled in his chest. He knew what it was to be bullied. As a faunt he had been as troublesome as the other young hobbits, but as a tween he'd struggled to fit in. He had wondered if there was something fundamentally wrong with himself as the other hobbits his age shunned or mocked him. It was part of why the start of his quest with the Company had been so challenging. He'd felt like an outsider all over again, and not just because he was a hobbit among dwarves.\nLife was cruel, but Bilbo wasn't.\n(For the prompt \"Raven\" - For Mim)",
        "comment": "There was a tatty-feathered lump in the middle of the bed, trembling amidst the furs. One pale blue eye watched him, the pupil like a pinprick in the bright daylight, and Bilbo let out a little sigh. The ravens were, on the whole, meant to stay at Ravenhill. They received and delivered their messages via the birdmasters, and though he and Thorin were frequent visitors, ravens in the mountain itself were not looked upon kindly, by dwarf or bird. They were creatures of the open sky, after all. They were not fond of the earth's dark heart.\nThe only reason this one was here, he suspected, was because he'd left the doors open to the royal gardens, up on the peak. Though why it had made itself at home, rather than returning to its own kind, Bilbo could not be sure. Now he was left wondering what to do with the bird, which croaked at him and then said, in perfectly serviceable Westeron, 'No.'\n'I beg your pardon?' Bilbo goggled at it. The older ravens understood Khuzdul and spoke a bit of it. The birdmasters had been teaching the hatchlings both the dwarven language and Westeron, which implied this one was newly fledged. It still didn't explain why it chosen his bed as its roost. 'This isn't your home. Shoo!'\n'No.'\n'Yes!' Bilbo bit his lip. He wasn't going to reduce himself to arguing with a bird. Not even a raven, which were clever enough in the Shire and frightfully intelligent in the Lonely Mountain.\nHe was just contemplating bundling it up and releasing it back into the garden when a hesitant knock came at his door. It was not Balin's officious tapping, nor Dori's quick rat-a-tat-tat. Thorin and his sister-sons didn't bother to announce their presence, and Dis tended to call his name. No one among the Company sounded that uncertain, and Bilbo found himself face-to-face with Brinn, one of the bird-masters, hovering awkwardly on his threshold.\n'Your Majesty,' she managed, sounding as if she had run all the way here from Ravenhill. 'I apologise. I saw one of the ravens...'\nHe smiled, beckoning her in and gesturing through to the bedchamber. 'I discovered it a short while ago. It seems in no hurry to leave.'\nThe dwarf sighed: the long, exhausted sound of a person at their wit's end as she eyed the quivering, feathered body. 'Trix.' There as real grief in the dwarf's tone of voice, and Bilbo stepped forward.\n'What's wrong? Is the bird ill?'\n'No, no it's not that. She's one of this year's chicks. One of a large clutch. The others bully her: pluck out her feathers and steal her food. She's getting thinner by the day. I fear she's not long left for the world: that they'll drive her to her death. I tried to make her leave for the Greenwood, thinking she'd be safer, but...'\n'But she won't go.' Bilbo's heart crumpled in his chest. He knew what it was to be bullied. As a faunt he had been as troublesome as the other young hobbits, but as a tween he'd struggled to fit in. He had wondered if there was something fundamentally wrong with himself as the other hobbits his age shunned or mocked him. It was part of why the start of his quest with the Company had been so challenging. He'd felt like an outsider all over again, and not just because he was a hobbit among dwarves.\nLife was cruel, but Bilbo wasn't.\n'Let her stay. Get me some scraps of rabbit from the kitchen. I'll see her fed. Is she friendly?'\nBrinn shut her mouth with a snap, looking at him with uncertain eyes. 'Yes, Your Majesty, but...'\n'Then that settles it.' Bilbo nodded his head, just once, decisive, and tried to ignore the intensity of Brinn's doubtful gaze. 'Anything I should know?'\n'She'll foul outside. All the ravens have enough sense for that. She's \u2013 smart, even by Ravenhill standards. Won't King Thorin \u2013?'\n'Don't worry. You can leave him to me.' Bilbo offered her a reassuring smile. Thorin may complain, but he wouldn't deny Bilbo's wishes. Not in something such as this. Trix needed help, and Bilbo intended to give it.\nThat was that.\n******\nA year later, Bilbo sighed, jamming his hands on his hips and glaring at Trix. Gone were the scruffy, tatty feathers. Instead, she was a creature of striking beauty: jet black until the light struck her just so, at which point her feathers gleamed with beautiful iridescent purples and blues. Her pale eyes were far too knowing, currently half-closed with mischievous pleasure.\n'Did you hide it?' he demanded, throwing his hand in the air when she gave a crackling croak, and her reply escaped her, all innocence.\n'No.'\nShe knew hundreds of words and took spectacular delight in mimicking the dwarves of the Company with eerie accuracy. Yet still, her favourite thing to say was the word she had first uttered to Bilbo.\n'Yes you did. Don't think you can lie to me,' he grumbled. One of Trix's favourite games was finding a random hole or gap, and then carefully selecting an object that would fit in it. He spent far too much of his time crawling around retrieving his possessions from where she'd dropped them down the back of the furniture.\nShe chortled in a striking mimicry of Dis when she'd heard a bawdy joke and took off from the back of the chair, flaring her wings before swooping up onto his shoulder. Her claws dug into the reinforced fabric patches that Dori had sewn into Bilbo's jacket, and he reached up to stroke her breast gently with the back of his finger. 'Leave the beads,' he warned, knowing she would pluck free his braids in no time and make off with the precious, glimmering stones that adorned his curls. 'I don't have time to do them again. Bard's coming.'\nThat pleased Trix, who jumped up and down on his shoulder, making him grunt. She may only be a bird, but she was a full-grown raven, sizeable and no small burden. She liked Bard almost as much as she liked Bilbo, though her affection for both of them paled in comparison to her unholy devotion to Thorin.\nNot that Bilbo blamed her. He could see why. Besides, the feeling was mutual. After three days of protests upon her arrival, all of Thorin's disapproval had been proved little but a front when Bilbo caught him cradling Trix in his arms like a house cat and scratching the crown of her head. Now, the two of them were rarely separated. She even joined him in the bath!\nThe thud of the door announced Thorin's arrival, and Bilbo huffed as Trix abandoned him for her more favoured perch. He had to admit, her presence did lend a certain sinister gravitas to Thorin's appearance, especially at court, when they both looked equally serious and dour. Now, however, they were simply being foolish. Thorin lavished attention on Trix as she gurgled and crooned in appreciation, raking her beak through his long hair and rearranging it more to her liking.\n'Sometimes I think you love that bird more than me,' Bilbo grumbled, but he was smiling while he said it.\n'Definitely not,' Thorin promised, placing a satchel in the arm-chair before scratching beneath Trix's beak. 'She may be a close second, however. She is more intelligent than all my council combined.'\n'I'm telling them you said that,' Bilbo warned, though, to be fair, he was fairly sure the council, which was comprised almost entirely of the Company, would agree. 'You only love her so much because the last time Thranduil visited, she stole all the berries from his crown one by one.'\nThorin grinned at the memory, a bright, boyish expression that made him look decades younger, though his denial followed on swift-wing. 'I liked her before that.' He tilted his head, looking Bilbo up and down, no doubt taking in his harried expression. 'What has she stolen this time?'\n'My crown.' Bilbo glared at Trix, who rattled her beak at him. 'I can't show up without it. Everyone will think you've demoted me.'\nThorin wrapped an arm around Bilbo's waist, steering him around so that the kiss he bestowed upon him slanted deliciously across his lips. It was hot and toe-curling, and if they weren't about to be late for a very important feast for visiting dignitaries, Bilbo would happily have given up his search and dragged Thorn into bed. Instead, he broke away with a faint whimper of regret, already shaking his head.\n'Thorin...'\n'She didn't take your crown,' he murmured, stepping back and reaching into the bag he'd deposited on his arrival. The glimmer of mithril and gold in his hand was familiar, and Bilbo sighed, shaking his head in confusion.\n'You had it?' What were you doing with it?'\nThorin held it out, waiting for Bilbo to take it carefully in his grasp. 'You've heard what they've taken to calling us, these past few months?'\nBilbo huffed. 'They call\nyou\nthe Raven King,' he murmured.\n'It's not just me who has earned that moniker. You know Trix always accompanies us in court. I thought perhaps we should make something of it.' He rested his fingers over a new engraving amidst the oak leaves and acorns.\nHis crown matched Thorin's, smaller only so that it would fit his head. And there, amidst the bower of the branches, was an etched raven, its feathers subtly darkened to pewter.\nThorin took it from his grasp, resting it upon Bilbo's head. The weight was significant, but not as bad as it could have been: the mithril made sure of that. It meant Bilbo had no difficulty holding his head high, and he could bear witness to the hot, lustful look Thorin sent his way: something both proud and proprietary that never failed to steal Bilbo's breath away.\n'Perfect.'\nWith a faint croon of interest, Trix swooped back to Bilbo's shoulder, bobbing up and down before her beak tapped, oh-so-carefully, against the rendition of herself in the metal. 'Good,' she said, firm and proud, as determined as any queen, and Bilbo laughed, ruffling her feathers before sweeping them gently back into place.\nWhen he looked back at Thorin, it was to see the matching crown upon his brow, with an identical embellishment at the right temple, where anyone who glanced his way could see it. The sight of him, finely dressed and perfectly regal, was enough to make Bilbo's heart flutter in his ribs, and he reached out for Thorin's hand, entwining their fingers.\n'Are you ready?' Thorin asked, waiting for Bilbo's firm nod before he gestured towards the door of their chamber. 'Then, shall we?'\nAnd as they departed to see to their duties, Trix took up her perch on Thorin's shoulder: no longer a bullied hatchling outcast from her kin, but as treasured part of Erebor's court, known and respected by all.\nShe had found her flock, featherless as they were, and she would never leave them.",

        "post_title": "'What happened to your back?'\nArthur's voice sounded tense, stiff and uncertain. The brush of warm fingers against the three, pale lines across his shoulder-blade made Merlin jolt in alarm. He whirled around, the tunic still clutched in his hands as he blinked stupidly, his words caught somewhere in his throat.\nNot that it mattered. Arthur was too busy staring at the starburst scar the size of a grown man's hand that lay right in the centre of his front, over his heart. A frown of confusion melted beneath a mask of horror, and Merlin swallowed hard as all the colour fled Arthur's face.\n'What happened to your chest?!'\n-----\n(Prompt: Incendiary - for Seadeepy)",
        "comment": "\u201cScars are just another kind of memory.\u201d - M.L. Stedman\nIt was his own stupid fault, Merlin thought grimly. His usual clumsiness and an unguarded moment was all it took.\nHe had been helping set up for Uther's latest stupid feast, and he'd slopped red wine all down the front of a blue tunic. In theory, he could have dismissed the stain with a spell, but the smell would have haunted him all evening. Arthur might know that all the time he was apparently in the tavern he was dealing with some magical crisis or other, but the same could not be said for the rest of the court. His reputation was bad enough as it was without adding fuel to that particular fire.\nHe'd ducked into one of the rooms where they stored the fresh laundry, pulling free a tunic he'd not yet collected before peeling himself free of the clinging fabric. The rustle of cloth meant he didn't hear the creak of the door, and the voice that rang out behind him made him jolt in surprise.\n'What happened to your back?'\nArthur's voice sounded tense, stiff and uncertain. The brush of warm fingers against the three, pale lines across his shoulder-blade made Merlin jolt in alarm. He whirled around, the tunic still clutched in his hands as he blinked stupidly, his words caught somewhere in his throat.\nNot that it mattered. Arthur was too busy staring at the starburst scar the size of a grown man's hand that lay right in the centre of his front, over his heart. A frown of confusion melted beneath a mask of horror, and Merlin swallowed hard as all the colour fled Arthur's face.\n'What happened to your chest?!'\n'Er...' Merlin winced, because although he had told Arthur about his magic \u2013 about everything he had done in his name, the good and the bad \u2013 he had rather glossed over some of the details. He hadn't done any of it for Arthur's gratitude, after all. He didn't need his thanks or his sympathy, but he couldn't deny that some of his choices had left their marks on his body for the world to see.\n'Why are you in here?' he managed, hoping to derail the conversation as he hastily tugged on the fresh garment, shoving his arms through the sleeves as he hid the scars from sight. 'Did you need something?'\n'I need you to tell me what happened.' Arthur's blue eyes snapped with an aimless, volatile sort of anger. His arms were folded across his chest, making his tunic strain at the shoulders, and the scowl on his brow suggested he wouldn't be easily swayed from his questioning. 'Merlin, who hurt you?'\n'It was ages ago. It doesn't matter.'\nHe went to duck around Arthur, mumbling something about the feast preparations. Yet before he got more than a few paces, strong fingers snagged his wrist. It wasn't a tight grip, Merlin could have broken free with ease, but he still came to heel like a dog obeying its master.\n'No, I'm not letting you leave,' he murmured, the rumble of his words sending a bolt of heat arcing down Merlin's spine. It snatched the air from his lungs, leaving him breathless and tense as Arthur turned him back around, shifting his grip to Merlin's shoulders as he stared into his eyes. 'Not until you tell me the truth. Who. Hurt. You?'\nThe anger in that expression wasn't aimed at him; Merlin knew that well enough. There was nothing Arthur hated more than feeling helpless. He was protective of his knights where Uther was dismissive of their loyalty and their sacrifice, but the gleam in his eye went beyond that. Dread had stolen the warmth from his face, and he was watching Merlin with the kind of intensity that some would find unnerving.\n'Sigan and his stupid gargoyles' \u2013 He jerked his thumb over his shoulder, indicating the scars on his back before tapping one finger over his heart \u2013 'Nimueh and a fireball.' They were such simple words for the horror of stony claws raking his back and the flash and burn of the incendiary spell that had hit him square in the chest, but in the end, they summed it up pretty neatly. 'It's fine, Arthur. They healed.'\nHe frowned, not understanding the expression on Arthur's face. The knights took injuries for him all the time, and while he praised their courage, he never looked like that \u2013 as if someone had reached into his guts and wrenched them out of him, leaving him hollow.\n'That's not the point.' Arthur's grasp moved from his shoulders, drifting down his arms to his hands. It was a soothing gesture, one Merlin wasn't even sure was consciously done. Yet even he could feel how Arthur's touch mapped the calluses on his palms and the small scars that were an apprentice healer's mark: tiny burns and the occasional slim white line where the herb-knife had slipped and sliced skin instead. Those didn't cause him any distress, and Merlin realised it was because they were expected: wounds received in the execution of his duties.\nDuties which, even knowing about his magic, Arthur clearly didn't realise involved protecting him with as much determination as any one of his knights.\n'You've got scars,' Merlin pointed out, thinking of the starburst from the Questing Beast's bite, among others.\n'I'm a knight. A prince.' He didn't add \"a target\"; he didn't have to. They were both thinking it. 'I've been trained to fight since I could walk. You... haven't.'\nMerlin snorted. That was an understatement. Still, he could practically see the spin of considerations in Arthur's head, and some magical sense forewarned him that if he didn't speak quickly, he'd find himself on the duelling field being beaten half-to-death in the name of \"practice\".\n'Wielding a sword wouldn't have saved me from either of these, and it's not like I can train in battle-spells, is it?' He shrugged one shoulder, unwilling to disturb Arthur's hand from where it still gripped his, tracing idle, tormenting little patterns against his skin. He didn't think Arthur realised what he was doing: how each caress made Merlin's breath come from deeper in his chest. It made his heart feel like it pumped hot honey, rather than blood, around his veins. 'It's not exactly discreet.'\nArthur pulled as face, but he didn't argue. It had been slow, steady work, getting him to see just how much damage the ban on magic had caused. Arthur would not care for his own sake: he was not interested in doing anything the easy way, but he was beginning to see how his people could suffer from its lack. Now, he looked at Merlin with fresh realisation. 'You can't learn how to defend yourself. Not without risking exposing your magic to all of Camelot.'\nIt was a flat statement of fact, one that he could not deny. It wasn't just that he could not practice; even studying the theory was a risky endeavour. As long as Uther still sat upon the throne, then Merlin had to work from the shadows and hope that he and Arthur both survived to see better days.\n'Armour.' Arthur said it softly. 'I cannot change the laws of Camelot, but there's is nothing to say a servant cannot wear armour. You could enchant it, couldn't you? Extra spells to protect you from magic. You've done it to mine.' One golden eyebrow lifted in challenge, as if daring Merlin to deny it. 'No one will question it. They know you come on almost every patrol with us, and more than one person has remarked upon the fact that you do not wear anything but the tunic on your back. Truthfully, I should have done something about that long before now.'\nMerlin pursed his lips. The rumours in court were already rife, and armour would just be another sign of his favour. Already, people noticed how Arthur let Merlin get away with disobedience that bordered on treason, sometimes, and they had taken note.\nIt was tempting to argue: to say he didn't need it. Armour wouldn't protect him from magical attacks, but he could see the desperation in Arthur's gaze. Those eyes had dipped to the laces of Merlin's tunic, as if envisioning the scar beneath. There was a haunted slant to his expression, as if he were imagining how that day could have ended.\nThe hand around Merlin's tightened, firm and sure, and when Arthur lifted his eyes once more, he looked resolute. 'I won't see you hurt again,' he said, speaking like a king laying down the law. 'Not if I can help it. One day, it will be different.' He swallowed. 'One day, you will be able to practice your magic without having to hide, but for now, let me help keep you safe. Please?'\nMerlin blinked, his heart heaving in a dizzying whirl. Arthur had never spoken of this before. He almost couldn't believe his ears, and he shifted where he stood, one hand reaching out as if he could pin Arthur's words \u2013 this very moment \u2013 motionless in place.\n'Do you mean it?' he rasped, trying to fight the urge to lean forward but unable to stop himself. 'You'll return magic to Camelot?'\n'Yes.' Arthur tilted his head to the side, a faint smile curving his lips at whatever he saw in Merlin's face. 'I swear it.'\nBeyond the door, the sounds of hurrying servants broke through the heavy air between them. It was enough to send a ripple of awareness through the tiny room \u2013 to make Merlin realise how close they stood to each other. All around them the balance of their friendship seemed to wobble, breathless, but it was Merlin, not Arthur, who stepped back in retreat.\n'I \u2013 I don't know what to say.' A grin spread over his face, bright and unstoppable. 'Thank you!'\nAnd if he hadn't already loved Arthur for more months than he cared to count \u2013 hidden and unacknowledged \u2013 he would have fallen there and then to see Arthur's bright, boyish grin light up the room.\n'You're welcome, Merlin.'\nBuckles chimed as Arthur slid them into place, sheathing Merlin in the armour he had commissioned. It was not the glittering mail and stalwart plate of his knights, but soft leather with scale pressed between: light and flexible, but strong enough to shield Merlin from the worst the world had to offer.\nHe wet his lips, looking up at him under his lashes as his pulse thrummed helplessly. The promise he had made still echoed in his mind. No doubt accompanied it; he would not go back on his word. Not after he'd seen the vicious light of hope lend its glow to Merlin's features.\nBesides, magic was not the only thing he planned to change when he took the throne. He could not admit how he felt for Merlin now, not while his father still lived and all the expectations of the court were against them. He would not make Merlin suffer that.\nInstead, he did what he could to protect the man who had stolen his heart. He would keep him safe in whatever way he could, and one day, he would be free to claim the love that Merlin promised him with every glance.\nThey would have their golden age, together. Arthur would make sure of it.",

        "post_title": "He watched Arthur through drooping lashes, admiring the way the firelight played across his skin and struck sunlight through his hair. The sleep tunic he wore was hardly the sturdiest garment. It clung to his shoulders and hung open at the laces, revealing strong collar bones and the golden hair that gleamed, downy, upon Arthur's chest. It was nothing Merlin hadn't seen before when he helped Arthur with his bath, and yet there was something almost coy about the sight: artless and appealing.\nArthur may be a prat sometimes, but he shows he cares in the little things.\n(Prompt word: Wretched - For Natty)",
        "comment": "Frigid air ached in his lungs, burning all the way down as Merlin huddled deeper into his coat. It was a frost-cracked, star-struck night. The moon's crescent smirked, low and fat on the horizon, and every breath escaped him in a cloud of steam. A north wind sliced through Camelot, whipping around the street corners. It was as sharp as any blade, and he flinched from it as the braziers guttered and danced.\nAnyone with an ounce of common sense would be safe indoors, stoking the fires high and curling up in a nice, warm bed. Gaius had, at least, sounded apologetic when he'd sent him out gathering frostwort: a delicate flower of potent properties that only bloomed on nights such as this.\nHe had filled Merlin's pockets with roasted chestnuts, now long gone, and promised to stoke the fire high for him. Still, that didn't change the fact that he was numb to the bone, and his poky little room in Gaius tower was a long way from the hearth. It would be warm only in comparison, and he grimly resolved to put on every piece of clothing he owned before he climbed under his blankets.\nThe cobbles of the courtyard had turned treacherous, each rounded stone capped with ice. He had to pick his way across, and more than once he almost slipped to smash himself on the unforgiving ground. Not that he would feel it, numb as he was. He could see the glow of candles from Arthur's chambers, and a flicker of a frown crossed his brow. He'd handed off his duties to George. Even Arthur couldn't argue that his comfort trumped the medical needs of the populace. Still, he would have expected him to be in bed by now.\nHis ears ached and his face felt stiff. Even his eyelashes were strangely brittle. He winced and swore his way up the castle steps, gasping gratefully as the stone edifice sheltered him from the clutching fingers of the wretched wind. The soldiers on guard were huddled in the cradle of the arch, and they both shot him sympathetic looks as he stamped his feet and chafed his palms together before giving up and sticking his fingers under his armpits.\n'The prince requests your presence in his chambers.'\nGeorge at least managed to sound apologetic as he emerged from the shadows, his hand held out to take the bag of herbs from Merlin's possession. 'I'll see that these get to Gaius.'\n'Thanks,' Merlin managed, wincing as the word slurred through his lifeless lips. 'Any idea what he wants?'\n'I'm afraid not. He has been tended for the night but he seemed \u2013 out of sorts.'\nMerlin managed a grunt. He didn't much relish the idea of Arthur in a mood. His body wasn't the only thing frozen stiff. His mind felt like an icy river, glassy and motionless. The few thoughts he did have moved achingly slow in his thick skull. More than anything, he wanted to climb into a nest of blankets and stay there until spring. Instead, he bullied himself up the sweeping staircase towards the royal chambers, grumbling as he went.\nThe castle may be out of the wind, but the masonry was tomb-cold. The torches, candles and braziers were small pools of fleeting warmth in the long corridors. Merlin flitted from one to the next, lingering as long as he dared in their brief respite. It meant by the time he arrived at Arthur's chamber door, he had only been shown a brief flavour of what it was to be warm: enough to set the shivers marching through his so fiercely that every breath stuttered.\nHis fingers felt sausage-thick around the latch as he shouldered his way inside, shutting the door in his wake and trying not to whine in relief as warm air folded around him like a cocoon. The fire had been stoked high and tended for what must have been hours. Arthur's chambers were not as grand as the King's, but nor were they modest. In the winter they sprouted extra rugs on the flagstones and additional blankets on the bed: all the comforts a prince would require. Merlin was almost sick with envy.\n'Took you long enough.' Arthur complained, rising from where he was sat in his fur-draped chair. He wore a long sleep tunic and a pair of plain breeches. His feet were unshod, with only thick socks to protect his toes as he strode towards Merlin. Firm hands grabbed his shoulders, bullying him and shoving him every closer to the hearth before practically man-handling him down onto the rug in front of the roaring blaze.\n'I had to get \u2013'\n'Frostwort. I know. George was very thorough in informing as to me why you were not attending your duties.'\nThere was a heavy dose of reproach in Arthur's words, but his heart didn't seem to be in it. If he meant to chastise Merlin for leaving George to deliver the bad news, then he missed his mark. It was enough to make Merlin consider him from beneath his thawing lashes, reading all the little signs he suspected Arthur didn't want him to see.\nA couple of years as his man-servant meant that Merlin had swiftly learned to look beneath Arthur's words. His lips often said one thing while his expression said another. His actions often embellished the truth, rather than contradicted it. Now, he saw how that brow was furrowed with more concern than genuine annoyance, and how Arthur was looking him over like he was a horse at market, more than a little bit critical of what he was seeing.\n'What?' he managed defensively, stretching out his hands towards the flames as a fresh shiver rumbled through him from head to foot.\n'Did you go out in that?' He gestured to Merlin in general, indicating his outfit.\n'Yeah,' he replied, dragging out the word. 'They're my clothes?'\nArthur made an angry noise in the back of his throat: a brief pulse of sound before he turned to the table, pouring himself some wine. A moment later, he hunkered down at Merlin's side, gripping his wrist and pressing something into his palm. Merlin blinked stupidly at the metal cup and the rich, red drink steaming softly within its confines.\n'Drink it,' Arthur ordered, like a prat. 'It'll warm you up. If I send you off to Gaius' now, you'll wake up with a cold and be no use to anyone.'\nMerlin hid his grin behind the rim as he lifted it to his lips, obligingly taking a sip and closing his eyes as the hot drink warmed him from his belly outwards. It was a blessing. He felt like he was slowly coming back to life, and he savoured the rich flavour of spiced wine.\nIt was not the first time that they had shared a drink in front of the fire. It had happened more and more, these past few months, as Arthur sought to work through the latest challenges of the court. Merlin didn't flatter himself in believing he wished for his advice, though he offered it anyway. Sometimes Arthur even listened.\nThis was different, though. Arthur didn't seem to be lost in the latest diplomatic entanglement or plotting how to get the best out of a new batch of knights. Instead, he was watching Merlin as he sipped from his own cup, his expression calm but for the hint of worry that clouded his gaze. More than once, he parted his lips as if to say something, but each time he swallowed his words back.\n'Thanks,' Merlin managed when the cup was almost empty. His voice sounded rough to his own ears. Now that he was warming up, he felt heavy and lethargic. He loathed the idea of stepping outside of the haven of Arthur's rooms and into the frigid hallways with all his heart. 'I needed that. It was colder out there than I thought.'\n'Did you actually think before you went wandering off into the woods in the middle of one of the coldest nights of the year?' Arthur looked at him sharply, his eyebrows raised. 'You didn't even take a cloak. It's not like there aren't plenty going spare.'\n'It would have been more trouble than its worth in the woods. They get tangled on things!'\n'Gloves, then!' Arthur gestured to his fingers, which had turned bright pink as the heat came back to them. 'You must have some!'\n'Not... really?' Merlin pulled a face. Gloves were something that every member of the court had, fine things of leather and nubuck, elegant and lined with fleece. Gaius had a knitted pair with no fingers to help ease the ache the cold brought to his knuckles without limiting his dexterity. They were old and tatty, falling to pieces, and his need was far greater than Merlin's. 'It's all right, Arthur. I'm fine. I'm all warmed up now. See?'\nArthur managed to convey with a mere look how much he disbelieved Merlin's claim. 'You're still shivering.'\nMerlin pursed his lips, not quite able to stifle the way his body had stirred itself into a fine, all-over tremble. It was as if it had been reminded of heat and was now lodging its protests that it had been made to suffer.\n'Stay there.' Arthur commanded, setting his empty cup aside and getting to his feet. 'You can go when your nose has returned to a normal colour. It's practically glowing.'\nHe moved with the same steady grace as always as he padded across the room, leaning over his desk and reaching for his quill. Gods alone knew what kind of paperwork he had to be doing at this time of night, but Merlin didn't argue. Instead, he drew his knees up to his chest, draping his forearms over their peaks and propping his chin atop them.\nHe watched Arthur through drooping lashes, admiring the way the firelight played across his skin and struck sunlight through his hair. The sleep tunic he wore was hardly the sturdiest garment. It clung to his shoulders and hung open at the laces, revealing strong collar bones and the golden hair that gleamed, downy, upon Arthur's chest. It was nothing Merlin hadn't seen before when he helped Arthur with his bath, and yet there was something almost coy about the sight: artless and appealing.\nMerlin huffed, shoving those thoughts down as he had numerous times in the past. Arthur may be a prat, but there was no denying that he was easy on the eyes: a classic golden prince \u2013 Camelot's pride and joy.\nIt was all most people ever saw: a valiant knight who would one day be their king, with all the arrogance that went with such expectation. They never witnessed Arthur's uncertainty or regret, nor his well-hidden compassion. Arthur had been trained all his life to see caring as a weakness, yet it had not made him hard or cold. Instead, he showed his care in stealthy, subtle ways, like plying a freezing manservant with warmed wine.\nThe thought made Merlin smile, warmed more by Arthur's action than the alcohol slipping softly through his veins. He barely noticed his eyes drifting shut, nor the deepening lethargy sweeping over him. At some, dim point, he thought he sensed a hand on his shoulder, something urging him to lie down on the thick rug before the hearth. Someone murmured something, but he hadn't the strength to do more than grumble in response. A weight settled over him, and the smell of clean wool filled his nose.\nThere was a moment of breathless hesitation before a warm hand rested in his hair, ruffling it with exceptional care. The bit of Merlin that clung onto the waking world by its fingertips knew that it was Arthur. If he so much as twitched, Arthur would flee like a deer bolting from a hunter. Instead, he kept his breathing slow and steady, hovering on the cusp of blissful oblivion as a whisper reached his ears, so achingly tender that he could almost believe it was nothing but a hopeful, desperate dream.\n'Goodnight, Merlin.'\nA week later, there was a large bundle for Merlin sitting on the workbench in the healing rooms. A fine, long coat made of dark-dyed wool, and a pair of hide gloves lined with rabbit fur.\nHe wasn't sure what warmed him more: the garments designed to keep winter's worst bite at bay, or the subtle, crooked smile that tilted Arthur's lips the first time he saw Merlin wearing them.",

        "comment": "\"The only truth is music\" - Jack Kerouac\nAmidst the great Dwarven halls, with the strike of pick and hammer conducting the percussive beat of honest toil, music grew like weeds amidst freshly tilled soil. From their earliest days, crafting down in the dark, dwarves had lifted their voices in song, the caverns they carved into their mountainsides carrying the tunes from dawn until dusk. They sang, and the earth that cradled them sang back, sharing in their joys and sorrows.\nTo his shame, Bilbo had been surprised that the Company all played instruments. In his prejudice, he had failed to understand how a dwarf could be made rough and course by hard work, but still carry the grace in their fingers to play with any skill. They all soon proved him wrong. There was not a dwarf among them who did not seem to have a flute or pipe ferreted away in their pack, and they came out often, their tunes bright and cheery as they made their way over the land.\nYet it was only once they were back in Erebor that Bilbo realised that even their celebration of music had been whittled away by necessity. They had kept with them the instruments they could carry as they fled. Only now that the Lonely Mountain was slowly reclaiming its splendour did the Master Craftsmen turn their attentions to their heritage once more. Slowly, the voices of those dwarves hard at work and raised in song were joined by the tuneful dapple of strings and flutes and brass.\nStill, to Bilbo, it felt as if one part of Erebor's great orchestral rebirth was missing. He knew, from stories told on the roads over Middle-earth, that Thorin, in his youth, had played the harp. Balin had confided in him, his eyes bright with recollection, how beautifully he had once played, before the dragon came and turned all he loved to ash. The instrument had been left behind amidst the embers of Thorin's old life: too big and unwieldy to be saved.\nThat was why he was here with Bofur, up in the wrecked remnants of the royal chambers, opening up old doorways and viewing the calamity confined within their walls.\n'A right mess, this is,' Bofur murmured, his usual good humour eclipsed by the destruction. 'It'll take years to repair.'\n'And Thorin has prioritised every other part of the mountain.' Bilbo sighed. He understood why he did it. Thorin's heart lay with his people. He did not care for the symbols of status that his grandfather had held in such high esteem. He would rather sleep on a rug before an open fire than live in luxury while his people went hungry.\nBofur grunted, and now, at last, there was a touch of a sparkle in his eye. 'He won't get a choice in the matter before long. For now, the dwarves arriving in Erebor are grateful for his humbleness, but soon they'll insist he climb back on his pedestal and stop getting his hands dirty. You'll have to soothe a lot of ruffled feathers.'\nBilbo cast a look in Bofur's direction, shaking his head before lifting his torch higher. 'That's why we're here, remember? To do something for Thorin, since he will not take the time to do it for himself.'\n'First, we have to find the thrice-damned thing, assuming Smaug left any of it behind.'\nThat was a valid concern. Even here, after traversing the ruined, twisted staircase, made narrow and precipitous by Smaug's ruination, he could see signs of the dragon's invasion. Gouges scored the walls, disrupting the marble's exquisite sheen. Tapestries had been ripped from their moorings, their fine silks and gold thread hoarded amidst the mountain of treasure. Delicate glass windowpanes, worthless to the wyrm but expensive all the same, had been smashed in his wrath. What remained was a skeleton of grandeur, and one that would linger in its sad state for some time yet.\n'Bilbo, here!' Bofur's voice was hushed, as if he had disturbed some poor soul's tomb.\nBilbo crept forward, lifting his lantern higher to let its light pour into the chamber he'd revealed. It was then, with a flash of grief, that he realised a body of a sort had found its rest here. The once graceful arch of a harp lay, its pillar broken and its soundboard cracked. Many of the strings had snapped or come loose from their pegs. It was a sad sight, but something in him rebelled, determined to find whatever small life might linger in the instrument's shattered frame.\n'There must be something we can do.'\nBofur rubbed a finger up the bridge of his nose before adjusting his hat with his palm, his dark eyes black and thoughtful in the meagre light. 'I'm a toy-maker,' he pointed out. 'I don't think \"we\" is the word you're looking for, but...' He hunkered down, setting the lantern on the floor and sucking in a breath through his teeth. 'It's not rotten. That's a start. Looks like it was smashed against the wall. Key bits of the frame will have to be replaced, and that needs the right kind of wood and hands with the skill to fix it.'\n'But it can be done?' He didn't mean to sound quite like that \u2013 achingly desperate \u2013 but the dwarf he loved carried a multitude of hurts. Not merely the physical ones, which had almost claimed his life, but ones upon his soul. This, Bilbo knew, was as much part of the healing as Oin's tinctures and constant nagging to rest and eat.\n'Aye, I think so. It'll be a challenge, but I know more than one dwarf who lives for this sort of thing, and to do it for our King? They'll rise to the occasion.' Bofur gave Bilbo a look, full of the soft fondness of friendship. 'This was a grand idea, Bilbo. Leave it with me.'\nIt took time, as all such things did. True craftsmanship could not be rushed, and the broken body of Thorin's old harp was an invalid in need of delicate care. Bilbo dropped by often, nervous, at first, that Master Mothi would view his presence at an intrusion. However, the kind old dwarf, busily training an apprentice, was more than happy to talk about his craft as long as Bilbo kept his hands in his pockets.\n'I remember when my master first built it,' he confided one day, as his gnarled hands stroked along the sound box, testing it for any small flaw that might break the harp's voice. 'The look on the face of the young prince as he played! I recall his only complaint was one he made to his mother, and that was a criticism of his grandfather's decorative taste.'\n'How do you mean?'\n'The old king had it carved and covered from crown to base in gold leaf. Delicate work. Challenging, too. It made the harp more fragile. The sound a touch less pure. My master was unhappy to do it, but we had our instructions.'\n'No gold, this time,' Bilbo decided, feeling in his heart how Thorin would rather the wood's grain could shine through. He would wish the strings to sing with their truest voice, more admiring of the harp's function than its form.\n'Perhaps an inlay, here?' Mothi stroked his palm down the front of the pillar. 'Something shallow, so as not to compromise its strength. I have a wonderful alloy: brass with a touch of mithril. It gives a wonderful sheen and need never be polished. Geometric, perhaps?'\nBilbo hid a smile before inclining his head. He had not wanted to say anything about the graceful lines of the harp, though he had noticed that there were some fundamental differences between the ones he had seen in Rivendell and this specimen. Even broken, he could tell Thorin's harp had a subtle angularity to its form, something sharper, where the elves favoured the sweeping curve.\n'Will it be much longer?' he asked, eyeing the framework, which to him looked as good as whole, but as yet unstrung.\n'Another week, maybe two.' Mothi gave him a knowing look. 'You cannot rush perfection.'\n'And I would not wish you to. Thank you.'\nHe tried to set it from his mind, the secret slowly taking shape beneath Mothi's hands. During the day, when there was much to be done, he did a fair job. Yet it was in the evening, when he and Thorin retired to their shared chamber in the overseer's quarters that he felt the strange, amorphous absence of it. He observed how Thorin seemed to not know how to draw the boundary between work and rest. He carried his tension with him, his mind forever caught up in the needs of his kingdom without a moment of respite.\nSo it was that, the day the harp was ready, and stolen carefully into their chambers, Bilbo found himself alight with nervous anticipation. He hoped that this had been the right thing to do. He prayed that he was healing a wound in Thorin's being, rather than ripping off a scab to leave him bleeding anew.\n'We need to finish treating with the merchant guild. They have their eye on the treasury, as always, but I will not allow them to \u2013' Thorin's words stumbled to silence as he preceded Bilbo over the threshold. His next breath was an odd little hitch, as if his lungs had forgotten how to work, and Bilbo sank his teeth into his bottom lip, praying he had not made a grave mistake.\n'This is...' Thorin swayed before stepping forward, reaching out with shaking fingertips to rest them against the harp's pillar like a healer checking for a pulse, reaching for the life that resided once more in the instrument's beautiful frame. The strings gleamed, waiting to be stirred into song, and Bilbo was almost sure he could hear them humming softly, like a cat purring in the presence of one who loved it. 'Where did you find this?'\n'The Royal Wing.' Bilbo shifted forward. 'It had been broken and forgotten, but there was enough of it left to save.' He swallowed, thinking how those words were not for the harp alone. They could be said about the kingdom around them and the line that ruled it just as easily. 'Master Mothi remade it, keeping as much of the original as he could. I thought you deserved something out of all this that was yours alone.'\nThorin turned, sweeping Bilbo into his arms, his brow a warm press against Bilbo's own. It was an assertive embrace, as if Thorin were trying to press everything he could not put into words down into Bilbo's bones, and the kiss that followed it had Bilbo's toes curling against the flagstones.\n'You like it, then?' he managed, delightfully breathless when Thorin reluctantly eased back, those rich blue eyes all softness and delight.\n'More than almost anything, except for you,' Thorin promised, his voice low and resonant in a way that set love thrilling through Bilbo, spreading beneath his ribs to pool in the hollow of his belly.\n'Will you play?' he asked, feeling as if it were some moment of truth. He had heard Thorin sing, his voice soft and deep, but this was another matter. He knew how talented those hands could be, and now he wanted to see them there, coaxing sound from an instrument that had been silent for far too long.\n'It would be a crime not to, though I warn you, I am out of practice.'\nThough Bilbo could well-believe the claim, he could hear no flaw in Thorin's playing. At first, perhaps, he was a touch hesitant, learning this old friend anew, but before long the music swelled around them, filling their chamber with its magic. It was not the ethereal, haunting melody of the elves, but something faster and deeper, the pitch of the harp more resonant: fitting for the booming mountain halls. It made Bilbo's heart race and quickened his blood. He let his eyes drift shut, the better to lose himself in the melody, and it was only when Thorin stopped that he opened them once more.\n'That was beautiful,' he murmured, feeling a little drunk \u2013 transported to somewhere glorious by Thorin's playing.\n'Would you like to learn?'\nBilbo's first thought was an instinctive refusal: the instrument too fine and his skill non-existent. Yet there was a gleam of something in Thorin's eye that made him think about how dwarves saw music \u2013 not as something to be performed for praise, but something to be shared with one another: the good and the bad. Skill was not as essential to them as the simple act of creation, and that was something he knew Thorin sought to share with Bilbo at every opportunity.\n'I can't even read a stave,' he warned, reaching out to take Thorin's hand and allowing himself to be guided closer, to cradle the harp between his spread legs like a lover, and set hesitant fingers upon its strings.\n'You don't need to. We rarely write down our songs. They are fluid things, learned and adapted, simplified and embellished.' Thorin stood behind him, bending to place his larger, broader hands over Bilbo's own. Warm, calloused fingers showed him how to move, teaching him where to pluck the strings and where to soothe them, leading him through it like he might lead a partner through a dance.\nAnd so it was that, slowly, music raised its voice once more in the halls of the Lonely Mountain once more. The tune carried, bright and true, through the turn of the seasons until the melody of love at the kingdom's heart became a symphony of prosperity for the whole realm to enjoy.\nFor all the years to come.",
