        "comment": "If anyone\u2014a kitchen boy, a maid, or, Eru forbid, even the housekeeper Wynhild\u2014had wandered near the pantry in the quiet hour just before dawn, they would have heard a muffled exchange from the depths of the storeroom:\n\u201cTry shifting this bowl here\u2026\u201d\n\u201cEasy, you\u2019re you're on me.\u201d\n\u201cOh, does that bother you, my lady?\u201d\n\u201cGet off me; I can\u2019t pull it out!\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps if you lean a little this way\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt won\u2019t fit\u2026 it\u2019s too big!\u201d\n\u00c9omer let out a quiet chuckle, at which Loth\u00edriel, half-crouched within the pantry shelf and half outside it, rolled her eyes with a huff.\n\u201cValandil, you\u2019re so childish.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m the King of Rohan, you know!\u201d\n\u201cA twelve-year-old king, apparently.\u201d\nThe two figures were rather indecently close, barefoot and dressed only in light nightclothes. They had ventured into the kitchens with the hope of finding them still deserted for a late-night snack or an early breakfast. With uncharacteristic gentleness, \u00c9omer shifted his wife\u2019s warm figure, promising himself to show her more vigorous attentions later.\n\u201cLet me do it. There it is\u2026 if I just pull like this\u2026\u201d\nWith a heavy thud, \u00c9omer tumbled backward, and Loth\u00edriel stifled a snicker. He quickly scrambled up, rubbing his bruised rear, but soon raised in triumph the cause of their entire escapade:\n\u201cBehold, my dear: an authentic roll of cured venison, made by the skilled hands of our spice masters. No need to thank me for such a delicacy.\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel watched her royal husband with a half-incredulous, half-amused smile, as he held the large salami with the pride of a merchant at the autumn fair. All of this because they had engaged in a lighthearted debate over the delicacies of their respective homelands, and \u00c9omer had insisted on making her taste his beloved homeland treat without delay, as though he himself had crafted it. Now holding his prize, \u00c9omer took her hand and said:\n\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d\nHis large, bare feet thudded heavily along the wooden planks of the hallways, while Loth\u00edriel tiptoed behind him, her thin nightgown fluttering in her wake. Once safely behind their chamber door, \u00c9omer let out a relieved sigh.\n\u201cThank B\u00e9ma that Wynhild didn\u2019t catch us, or she\u2019d have given me a hard time, king or not.\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel laughed at the thought; in truth, the old housekeeper of Edoras scared her, though Wynhild had been nothing but sweet and kind to her.\n\u201cBut have we gotten the servants into trouble? I\u2019d hate to think someone else might pay for our, well, indiscretions.\u201d\n\u00c9omer, who had already taken a hearty bite of the salami and was chewing contentedly, paused to think. To Loth\u00edriel, he looked like a great golden-haired squirrel with the morsel stuffed in one cheek. How he could be both a fierce warrior and a wise sovereign as well, was a mystery she had yet to solve. His voice came out muffled as he swallowed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, but if it ever gets out, I\u2019ll say the sweet Queen of the Mark was struck by an irresistible craving for spiced meat in the dead of night\u2014and who would deny anything to the future mother of the next royal heir?\u201d\nHe crossed his arms, looking quite pleased with his idea, but Loth\u00edriel\u2019s eyes widened at the bold lie, and she covered her face with her hand, foreseeing trouble ahead.",

        "comment": "The white Elven ship rode the golden waves that rolled around its hull, the low sunlight casting iridescent rainbows upon the pearly foam, and the gulls cried as they circled around the swan-shaped figurehead. A solitary Elf had long been leaning against the railing, gazing at what was no longer in sight. Jet-black hair, simply braided, hid a face marked more by experience than by the long passage of years.\n\u201cWhy do your eyes, which always looked forward, now turn back?\u201d\nA female voice interrupted his reverie, and a tall, golden-haired figure approached him, her hair gleaming like starlight. He replied in a somber tone:\n\u201cTruly, they see only a liquid curtain of silver, my dear friend.\u201d\n\u201cTears, Elrond?\u201d\nGaladriel\u2019s hand came to rest beside Elrond's, and the stones of Nenya and Vilya glimmered faintly; the rings, once so powerful, now bereft of their forged powers, yet not of the memories they carried. At last, Elrond turned his face toward Galadriel. They had known each other for so long, through entire ages in which unimaginable things had occurred, that their bond transcended the very concept of friendship. She smiled gently at him, waiting for a response, and the Elf shook his raven braids, shrugging his shoulders:\n\u201cFor all these years, we have, I have done nothing but look and sigh for Aman like the rest of my people, and yet I have fought and suffered indescribably for this Middle-earth. I do not know, it seems to me that I have left behind more than I will ever find in the Blessed Land\u2026 I have left her behind.\u201d\nElrond finished in a whisper, the pain for his lost daughter weighing on his shoulders, and he bowed his head to hide the anguished expression on his lips. Galadriel laid her hand on his in silent understanding:\n\u201cArwen has made her choice, as you made yours: she has chosen a mortal life, and long and painful will be her years of solitude. She will wander the lands of men in solitary waiting. Perhaps few are the years in which she will know full and perfect happiness compared to our elven life, but it will be a life of love, and the memory will suffice for her.\u201d\n\u201cYou have become wise, Galadriel. Where is the proud warrior maiden who defied Gil-galad and even the Valar themselves?\u201d\nGaladriel\u2019s lips curved in an indulgent smile:\n\u201cOh, foolish and vainglorious girl. I believe she has been forged by years and experiences.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, I believe so too.\u201d\nFor a few minutes, the two Elves remained contemplating the horizon, each lost in their own thoughts, their fingers intertwined in silent conversation. The first evening star shone in the east, and the cold sea breeze made Galadriel shiver.\n\u201cMy friend, do not linger in the evening shadows of a sorrowful old heart. Soon, I hear in the distance a melody: the two young ones from the Shire are singing one of their amusing hobbit songs. And what a wonder: if my ears do not deceive me, I recognize the voice of Mithrandir!\u201d\nGaladriel gathered up her long gown, dampened by salty droplets, and offered her arm to Elrond:\n\u201cI accept your counsel, but I would prefer the company of an old friend, should he agree to join me.\u201d\nElrond bowed his head in a gracious nod, and his stern face softened into a smile. He took his friend's arm, and together they walked the white wooden planks of the deck towards the music and laughter.",

        "post_title": "During a boat trip with the brothers of Dol Amroth, \u00c9omer is confronted with an old superstition of the Mark. While Loth\u00edriel, blissfully unaware, enjoys herself steering the sails, \u00c9omer struggles to maintain his dignity amidst the teasing of the Amrothian brothers, who never miss a chance to poke fun at him.",
        "comment": "\u00c9omer sat uneasily on the edge of the cushioned bench in the small boat that the princes of Dol Amroth had convinced him to board. The vessel was a miniature replica of the grand swan ships typical of their fleet, offering every comfort despite its smaller size\u2014softly padded seats, a canopy to shield from the sun, and even a tiny galley.\nIt was not the sailing itself that troubled him, though the King of the Mark was certainly unaccustomed to the boat\u2019s sway and the feel of bare feet on salt-slicked wood. What truly furrowed \u00c9omer\u2019s brow was the figure standing at the prow. Loth\u00edriel, laughing with her brother Erchirion as she helped manage the sails, was a vision of beauty and freedom. Barefoot, skirts hitched to ease her movements, and her hair tied hastily with rebellious strands whipping in the sea breeze, she was a sight both delightful and painfully distracting to \u00c9omer. And yet, in his heart, there stirred a superstitious fear.\n\u201cWell, \u00c9omer, what\u2019s with that face?\u201d\nAmrothos called out as he plopped down beside him.\n\u201cYou look as if the sea\u2019s gotten the better of you.\u201d\nErchirion chimed in, sitting across from him. \u00c9omer ground his teeth.\n\u201cI am not seasick.\u201d\n\u201cThen what is it? We didn\u2019t invite you aboard to sulk in a corner, and we certainly didn\u2019t leave one brooding bore behind only to find another onboard!\u201d\nAmrothos teased, flashing a grin at Erchirion, clearly referring to their elder brother Elphir, who had stayed behind to tend to his duties. \u00c9omer merely shrugged, but the brothers were not easily deterred.\nErchirion laughed aloud, noticing where \u00c9omer\u2019s gaze had wandered.\n\u201cIt seems our friend doesn\u2019t quite approve of a certain presence on this ship, brother.\u201d\nAmrothos followed \u00c9omer\u2019s line of sight and snickered.\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d\n\u201cI am only wondering if her behavior is fitting for her station,\u201d \u00c9omer replied dryly.\nThe brothers exchanged knowing looks, and Amrothos shrugged.\n\u201cYou know how my sister is. She insisted on joining us\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026and we can deny her nothing,\u201d Erchirion finished with a grin.\n\u00c9omer was about to retort when the boat lurched unexpectedly, nearly throwing them from their seats. Loth\u00edriel let out a triumphant cheer as she righted the sail. She glanced back at \u00c9omer with a mischievous smile, and he, raising a hand in greeting, returned to his brooding, staring out over the waves. Yet the princes of Dol Amroth were not done with him.\n\u201cSomething still seems to trouble our Horse Lord,\u201d Erchirion remarked with mock seriousness.\n\u201cCome now, \u00c9omer, confess to your friends. Have we not shared glory, blood, and dust on the fields of battle?\u201d Amrothos added with a laugh.\n\u00c9omer sighed, knowing they would give him no peace until he spoke.\n\u201cYou are worse than washerwomen at the riverbank,\" he grumbled. \"Very well. Since you won\u2019t cease pestering me until I tell you, here it is.\u201d\nThe brothers chuckled, awaiting his revelation.\n\u201cIn my land, it is believed that having women aboard ships brings ill fortune and disaster. There, I\u2019ve said it.\u201d\nHe concluded with a scowl, daring them to mock him.\nAmrothos and Erchirion struggled to contain their laughter until Amrothos finally burst out, \u201cThat\u2019s the strangest thing I\u2019ve ever heard!\u201d\n\u201cCome now, friend,\u201d Erchirion added, still chuckling. \u201cDol Amroth thrives under such superstitions, and our women are a common sight upon our ships.\u201d\n\u00c9omer crossed his arms, frowning. He knew they wouldn\u2019t let it go so easily. And indeed, his torment was not over, for Erchirion, struck by sudden inspiration, nudged his brother.\n\u201cLet\u2019s call Loth\u00edriel over\u2014she can surely set our friend\u2019s mind at ease.\u201d\n\u201cAn excellent idea, brother.\u201d\nAmrothos grinned. \u00c9omer\u2019s eyes widened in alarm, and he moved to rise and stop them, but another roll of the boat sent him crashing back onto the bench.\n\u201cFor the love of B\u00e9ma\u2026\u201d he muttered under his breath, cursing both himself and the moment he\u2019d agreed to this accursed voyage!",
        "writing_prompt": "\u00c9omer, unaccustomed to the sea and its strange customs, finds himself aboard a Dol Amroth ship with the lively and free-spirited Loth\u00edriel, whose presence stirs both his heart and his superstitions.

        "comment": "\u00c9omer stood by the window of the royal chamber, gazing out but not truly seeing the rooftops of Edoras below. The cool morning breeze brushed against his bare chest, raising the fine golden hairs upon his skin. Unbothered by the chill or the goosebumps it caused, he turned to look upon his bride. Loth\u00edriel was still nestled in the soft bedding of their marriage bed, dark curls spilling over her peaceful face. Her breathing was deep and steady, a clear sign that she remained in the depths of slumber. \u00c9omer\u2019s eyes softened, his lips curving into a gentle smile. He cast his gaze back to the fortress-city his ancestors had built, as the first sounds of harnesses clinking reached his ears, mingling with the early calls of birds and the murmurs of soldiers and workers beginning their day.\nA soft murmur from the bed furrowed the king\u2019s brow, and he turned once more to Loth\u00edriel. She had shifted, her golden arms draped across the white pillows, the sheet tangled around her waist. A corner of the thick blanket had slipped to the floor, revealing the chubby curve of her thigh. \u00c9omer licked his lips, wondering if he had been too rough or too eager the night before. He had tried to be gentle, mindful of her inexperience, but despite his efforts to please her, he had found himself unable to resist the urge to sink deeply into the warmth of her womb, drinking of her honeyed lips like a man dying of thirst.\nLost in the memory, he did not hear the soft rustle of the sheets as a small, cool hand slipped into his own, large and warm.\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep, or is this the hour you rise? Perhaps I should begin your day, as befits my new role as wife?\u201d\n\u201cLoth, no. You are queen now; you may return to your rest if you wish.\u201d\n\u00c9omer brought her hand to his lips with a smile, pressing a chaste kiss to her fingertips. He gazed at her with eyes bright with desire. She was so beautiful, partially covered by the white sheet, glowing like the dawn veiled in mist. The sight stole his breath, but his brow furrowed for a moment.\n\u201cAre you\u2026 well? Was your rest sufficient?\u201d\nHe feared to ask if she felt any discomfort, or if his passion had displeased her in any way. Loth\u00edriel adjusted the sheet around her bare body, suddenly shy at the memory of the night. She bit her lower lip, trying to hide a small, satisfied smile.\n\u201cMy sleep was more than\u2026 satisfactory, my lord.\u201d\n\u201c\u00c9omer. Only \u00c9omer.\u201d\n\u201cOnly \u00c9omer. I was very tired, perhaps you had something to do with that.\u201d\nThey both smiled. Loth\u00edriel turned toward the window, her profile framed against the dark wood of the walls, her gaze taking in the same landscape her husband had absently observed only moments before. From their high vantage point, they could see the green pastures dotted with white flowers, stretching endlessly toward the distant mountains. Just then, a gust of wind rippled across the grassy plains, making the white blossoms dance like foam on the waves.\n\u201cSo, this is my new land,\u201d Loth\u00edriel murmured. \u201cSo different, so green.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you will reign over its people and herds alongside me.\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel did not answer, her gaze still fixed on the wind-swept fields.\n\u201cIt looks like a sea, though so different from the one I used to watch from my windows in Dol Amroth. Yet no less vast, no less dangerous, and worthy of love and respect all the same.\u201d\n\u00c9omer\u2019s brows knit together, a thorn of worry pricking his heart.\n\u201cDo you long for home, Sea Princess?\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel shook her head and placed her hand over \u00c9omer\u2019s chest. She smiled softly and replied,\n\u201cMy home is here: wherever your heart is, there my dwelling shall be.\u201d\n\u00c9omer felt his worries melt away, his features softening into a smile as tenderness filled his heart. He gathered Loth\u00edriel into his arms, capturing her lips in a loving kiss.",

But the furry little disaster leads him to a glade where he encounters a young princess who seems to have won the puppy's heart... and perhaps the heart of the King of the Mark as well.",
        "comment": "The tall, blond man snorted through his nose, carelessly brushing aside the foliage in the small park of the Citadel of Minas Tirith, kicking at twigs and leaves that blocked his path. He muttered\u2014no, more like growled\u2014to himself:\n\"Where has that wretched beast gone? I swear, the moment I get my hands on it, I\u2019ll wring its neck!\"\nHe swore to himself then and there that he would never again do a favor for his sister. Better to hole up in the stables and tend horses for the rest of his days, something he was already attempting with little success. The sound of joyful barking drew him toward a small clearing. There, he immediately noticed the white puppy bouncing and barking gleefully around a figure crouched low to the ground. The figure was clearly of noble birth: her heavy, amaranth-colored skirt lay spread around her on the grass like the petals of a flower, making her seem like some woodland creature. Her dark curls framed her shoulders, hiding her face.\n\u00c9omer\u2019s lips tugged up at the corners despite himself at the sight, wondering if perhaps he had stumbled upon one of Queen Arwen\u2019s Elves.\nMeanwhile, the puppy danced about her, a little cloud of pure happiness. A sarcastic puff of air escaped \u00c9omer\u2019s lips, and she lifted her face. \u00c9omer nearly fell to his knees then and there; his heart raced madly, his palms dampened so quickly that he had to resist the urge to wipe them on his trousers. The sound of her laughter shattered the last shred of dignity the King of the Mark clung to, forcing him to clear his throat several times.\nLoth\u00edriel placed a hand over her chest in a small gesture of surprise.\n\"Oh! Is this little one yours? I hope you don\u2019t mind that I\u2019ve kept him entertained with a bit of play.\"\nHer voice was sweet, and the slightest trace of a southern accent lingered beneath the well-spoken Westron she used. \u00c9omer knew that his own accent, by contrast, was rather rough, and for a moment, he regretted not having taken more lessons when he had the chance. He scratched his beard and gruffly replied:\n\"Actually, he belongs to my sister.\"\n\"He is so sweet and utterly adorable, truly delightful!\"\nLoth\u00edriel offered her hand, and \u00c9omer rushed forward to help her up. Her grip was firm on his arm, and for a fleeting moment, he caught the faint scent of apples from her dark hair. With a wry smile, he remarked:\n\"It\u2019s curious that you\u2019d say that, given that he behaves more like a goblin from the mines.\"\nIn response, the puppy bared its tiny teeth in a growl. Loth\u00edriel giggled and scrunched her nose in a mischievous little smirk.\n\"Perhaps he is sensitive to the stern ways of the valiant knight who watches over him.\"\nFor a moment, \u00c9omer stiffened at the subtle rebuke, but the playful glint in Loth\u00edriel\u2019s eyes made him dissolve into laughter. Oh, if only he could subject\nher\nto the kind of care he had in mind!\nHe bowed his head in a slight nod as the puppy wagged its tail around their legs. Their eyes met in a conversation that required no words. But the faintly alarmed voice of a court lady interrupted the moment:\n\"Princess! It is time to return to your duties.\"\n\u00c9omer pressed his lips together in frustration. Loth\u00edriel furrowed her brow in a small gesture of displeasure but widened her lips in a smile.\n\"As you heard, my lord, my duties call me.\"\nShe bent to give the puppy one last affectionate pat, then made her way toward her companion, giggling and whispering as she went. \u00c9omer stood frozen in the center of the glade, cursing himself for not having had the presence of mind to ask for a meeting\u2014or at least her name. Absently, he picked up the trembling, growling puppy and ran his fingers through its curls. In a low voice, he muttered:\n\"Perhaps I won\u2019t throw you to the sharp fangs of some passing orc after all.\"\nIn response, the dog barked and sank its tiny teeth into his hand.

        "comment": "It had become a cherished habit for the Prince of Ithilien and his future bride to take their morning meal together in the herb gardens of the Houses of Healing in the Citadel of Minas Tirith. A table was always set for them in the aromatic garden, a place dear to them both, for it had witnessed the blossoming of their love and many moments of intimate joy. To them, it seemed a foretaste of their wedded life, and they indulged in it with the greatest delight.\n\u00c9owyn was pouring strong Rohirric coffee into their cups, a taste Faramir had acquired, though he could only tolerate it if it was drowned in milk and sugar. This peculiarity never failed to exasperate his future spouse, who would teasingly chide him with playful resignation. As he buttered a slice of soft milk bread from the King's bakery, Faramir began:\n\u201cMy dear \u00c9owyn, I heard an interesting story this morning.\u201d\nHe offered the bread to the lady, who raised an inquisitive eyebrow.\n\u201cWhat story? Are we speaking of an intriguing epic of high sovereign deliberations or the usual courtly gossip? You know well I adore the former and despise the latter.\u201d\n\u00c9owyn concluded, taking a bite of the bread. Her eyes sparkled with mischievous mirth, and her golden hair shone like molten honey in the sun. Faramir leaned forward, once again admiring the beauty of his betrothed, and brushed a rebellious black lock from his forehead.\n\u201cAs to that, it is for you to judge, fair lady.\u201d\n\u201cOh, enough with riddles!\u201d\nHe leaned back in his chair, smiling, for he always enjoyed teasing the fiery nature of the White Lady. Her blue eyes flashed as she menacingly wielded the small knife, stabbing a particularly plump herring. Faramir showed the palms of his hands, exclaiming:\n\u201cNever would I seek to arouse the ire of my sweet lady.\u201d\n\u00c9owyn scoffed mockingly and let the unfortunate fish fall onto the buttered bread. Meanwhile, Faramir had picked a particularly juicy strawberry from the bowl before him and offered it to his future bride as a peace offering. She closed her eyes, her lips parting to savor the plump fruit with delight, and it was in moments like these that Faramir longed all the more for their wedding day to come swiftly. \u00c9owyn\u2019s voice distracted him from his less-than-virtuous musings.\n\u201cSo, this story. Do not make me beg, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I shall leave your supplications for our wedding night!\u201d\nA forcefully thrown napkin stifled his laughter. As he composed himself, the stern look in \u00c9owyn\u2019s eyes urged him to speak.\n\u201cWell, your brother \u00c9omer and Loth\u00edriel were seen in a stable.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no! And what were they doing?\u201d\n\u201cIt seems they were grooming a horse. Or rather, \u00c9omer was teaching my cousin to groom a horse.\u201d\nFaramir replied with an amused smile. \u00c9owyn's eyes widened, and she burst into laughter.\n\u201cTypical of my brother: courting a girl in a stable! He couldn't be more Rohirric if he tried.\u201d\nFaramir took her hand as she shook her head and said:\n\u201cNot all use sweet words and gift heirlooms. Yet, it seems to be working.\u201d\n\u00c9owyn's expression softened at the memory of the evening when Faramir had draped her mother's precious cloak over her shoulders, giving her his heart along with it. Suddenly, her expression turned into a frown.\n\u201cI know that wrinkle between your eyes, what troubles my lady?\u201d\n\u201cI wonder if Loth\u00edriel will be able to handle him. \u00c9omer is a good man, but he is impetuous and can be stubborn.\u201d\nFaramir held \u00c9owyn\u2019s hand between his and bent to place a small kiss on it.\n\u201cI know someone like him, a fearless and passionate maiden. She too is of Rohan... and yet, she fell into my arms like a ripe, sweet fruit.\u201d\n\u00c9owyn, despite herself, smiled.\n\u201cBraggart! If Loth\u00edriel is made of the same stuff as her cousin, she will surely enchant him with her melodious words.\u201d\n\u201cShe will: Loth\u00edriel has a keen mind and a resolute character, though her youthful features might suggest otherwise.\u201d\n\u00c9owyn looked at him with affection and felt confident that her brother had found a companion capable of standing up to him.\n\u201cSo, we shall have another wedding to organize.\u201d\n\u201cI prefer to organize ours. Or, better yet, I prefer to think of when I shall have my bride all to myself.\u201d\n\u00c9owyn chuckled, a sound new to her lips, and covered her mouth with her hands. Faramir, smiling, gently lowered them and pressed a loving kiss on her lips.",

        "post_title": "\u00c9omer feels overwhelmed by social pressures and is concerned about the whispers circulating among the Gondorian courtiers regarding his status as a king and his courtship of Princess Lothiriel. His sister \u00c9owyn seeks to reassure him.",
        "comment": "\u00c9omer could perceive them, the whispers behind the affable smiles of the Gondorian courtiers: here is the barbarian king, here he is, with his rough manners courting our princesses, he and his uncouth horsemen tarnishing the white roads of the Kingdom, preying upon innocent maidens. And their women, Valar!, call them shield maidens, yet they can fight and ride bare-legged! So incessant were the murmurings and whispers of scandalized women and disgruntled fathers. \u00c9omer would have liked to laugh at those foolish rumors since he had witnessed for himself how the timid Gondorian maidens nearly threw themselves into the tents of his riders, and conversely, how he had had to growl more than once at some lewd glances thrown by the Gondorian nobles at the daughters of the Mark. He could have ignored and laughed at those nonsensical tales, but his temper boiled at the thought that the honor of his people was less than immaculate in the eyes of their new allies. \u00c9omer stood observing the landscape from the palace balconies, the camp of the \u00c9orlingas at the gates of Minas Tirith resounding with the neighing of horses, distant songs and shouts, and the rhythmic clinking of blacksmiths at work on their anvils. The knuckles of his hand were white as the stone he gripped, his face marked by hard, thin lines that somewhat marred his fair, noble beauty. He raised his eyes to the snow-capped peaks of the distant mountains, seeking in their placid, immaculate beauty some relief from the troubling thoughts that beset him.\n\u201cThere you are: I was looking for you, brother.\u201d\nThe voice of \u00c9owyn brought him back to the present. The White Lady approached him and observed the camp for a moment. In a casual tone, she playfully teased him:\n\u201cIt seems that the King of Rohan is hiding.\u201d\n\u00c9omer straightened, his mouth a thin line, his eyes tempestuous:\n\u201cI am not hiding! I was merely seeking a moment of peace from the incessant chatter of these Gondorian\nb\u00e6dling\n(eunuchs)!\u201d\n\u00c9owyn chuckled, raising her hands:\n\u201cI come in peace! And let them say what they will. They are but gossip, mediocre talk from the envious.\u201d\n\u00c9omer clenched his fists, frustrated. He shook his head, the boiling anger simmering just beneath the surface:\n\u201cThey speak as if we are barbarians, as if we are unworthy of their company or their daughters. It infuriates me.\u201d\nShe tilted her head and rested her index finger on her chin in thought:\n\u201cIs it because of Lothiriel? Do you fear she may give credence to the whispers? She is young, yet well-tempered by the trials of war and the harsh art of command.\u201d\n\u00c9omer turned again towards the mountains, avoiding his sister's gaze, a veil of uncertainty in his voice:\n\u201cShe looks at me with little less than disdain, fear clouds her eyes. I can see it.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps what you see reflected in her eyes is the fear of your own heart. I see neither disdain nor fear in her.\u201d\n\u00c9omer pressed his lips together, not entirely convinced. When Aragorn had proposed forging alliances with the southern kingdoms, he had not imagined that among the commitments would be the need to take as his bride a spoiled little princess, the daughter of his dear friend from Imrahil of Dol Amroth. Yet, Lothiriel had struck him with her exquisite beauty and sharp wit. \u00c9omer turned and leaned against the stone balustrade, crossing his arms:\n\u201cYou have grown wise, sister. Nonetheless, Lothiriel is little more than a child; I am not certain she will be able to discern the truth from the slanders.\u201d\n\u201cGive her the credit she deserves! Not all Gondorians are of short wit and dull spirit, as my future husband well demonstrates!\u201d\n\u00c9owyn replied passionately, defending her newly acquired family. \u00c9omer softened, smoothing his brow, and smiled:\n\u201cLove does you good, sister.\u201d\n\u00c9owyn bowed her head as a soft rose hue spread across her pale cheeks, a self-satisfied smile stretching her lips. Then, lifting her gaze, she asked with a mix of sweetness and challenge:\n\u201cAre we happy, \u00c9omer?\u201d\nThe question caught him by surprise, and for a moment he remained silent, studying his sister's face and reflecting upon himself. Then, with a slight curl of his lips:\n\u201cWe shall be, I promise you. There is a light in your eyes that I have not seen in far too long, and I think the credit belongs to the Steward.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, it is so.\u201d\nMurmured \u00c9owyn with an irrepressible smile. \u00c9omer furrowed his brow and left the parapet he had leaned against:\n\u201cBut if I find that handsome Gondorian has laid hands upon you, by the balls of Bema, I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPrecisely for this I sought you! We must decide which ribbons you will wear for our handfasting ceremony.\u201d\n\u00c9owyn took her brother's arm, dragging him away.",

As they navigate their growing feelings, the backdrop of celebration reveals the challenges and expectations of their noble standings.",
        "comment": "On the terraces of the Citadel, a gentle breeze wafted through the air. Low tables, large cushions, and thick carpets were arranged with care, the linen cloths embroidered with the symbols of Rohan, and the white muslin of Gondor reflected the sunlight. Upon them lay silver platters filled with simple yet delightful fare: savory pies, salads of fresh fruit, slices of seed bread dipped in Dol Amroth's oil, portions of roast with a crisp crust, and morsels of spiced meat. Carafes of refreshing juices, white and red wine, sweet ratafia, and sparkling mead glimmered in the sun. Some elvish silk drapes had been stretched between decorated poles adorned with ribbons and red vine tendrils to provide shade for the guests.\nNot long before, the Citadel had been animated by a grand parade of Gondorian warriors, their silver armor shining beneath the warm autumn sun, and their long pikes reflecting rays of light. The Rohirrim knights had demonstrated their valor in a jousting exhibition: their powerful and agile steeds moved with perfect precision and grace, while the riders showcased their legendary equestrian mastery. Following this, the elegant knights of Dol Amroth glided onto the scene, their capes billowing like sails, as some sailors from the maritime realm displayed their skill in knot and rigging games, throwing ceremonial ropes and nets into the air, amidst the admiring applause of the spectators.\nThroughout the ceremony, \u00c9omer had maintained a composed expression, befitting a King of the Mark. Yet, every so often, his gaze inevitably slipped towards the beautiful daughter of Imrahil. Her attire, rich as befitted a princess, was of refined simplicity. The silver and blue cloak fluttered lightly in the breeze, occasionally revealing the amber skin of her shoulders, and, Bema help him, a generous portion of her collarbones. But it was Loth\u00edriel's face that truly captured \u00c9omer's attention: her bright eyes and full lips seemed to hide a secret smile.\nLoth\u00edriel, for her part, did not fail to notice the fleeting yet fervent glances the King of Rohan cast her way. She felt flattered, intrigued by the contrast between his imposing presence and the apparent shyness that shone through his gestures. Gracefully, she offered him a few subtle smiles, hoping that \u00c9omer would grasp the message hidden behind her composure. He was no Boromir, of course, and she would never forget him. However, there was something about this warrior king that reminded her of him, and she was ready to give him a chance. Her father had hinted at a promise, and Loth\u00edriel, fully aware of the role she was meant to play from birth, intended to honor it to the best of her ability. If the sovereign she was destined for was to be that proud barbarian king, well, she would not be intimidated.\nLater, after the horses and their riders had been refreshed, the foot soldiers and sailors found respite, and every noble of the court had settled at the long, informal low tables prepared for the feast, \u00c9omer was called loudly by the Dol Amrothian brothers with whom he had forged a sincere friendship as well as a steadfast military alliance. With a nod of his head, King Elassar gave his consent, and so \u00c9omer found himself seated right next to Loth\u00edriel. Perhaps it was mere coincidence, or perhaps not: Imrahil's knowing smile did not entirely escape him, making him suspect that the princess's family had orchestrated the meeting. In any case, he preferred it this way: he felt more at ease among the jovial and witty knights of Dol Amroth than among the pompous and haughty nobles of Gondor. Not to mention, it had the undeniable advantage of sitting next to the princess. It mattered little if the prince\u2014her father\u2014had had a hand in it. He continued to watch her as she laughed and conversed animatedly with her brothers, revealing more of her sharp wit and undeniable beauty. Though distracted by the charms of his neighbor, \u00c9omer still managed, albeit with some difficulty, to respond to the jests of his newfound friends. At one point, one of the guests offered Loth\u00edriel another glass of ratafia, and before she could accept, \u00c9omer interjected in a measured tone:\n\u201cSurely the princess would prefer a glass of fresh spring water.\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel was taken aback and, without allowing the others to hear, whispered with a tone betraying her displeasure:\n\u201cI thank my lord for his concern, but you are not a relative to whom I must account for my libations.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, I am not your kin.\"\nA \u201c\nnot yet\n\u201d lingered between them for a moment, an unspoken tension that vibrated the air with unexpressed possibilities. Realizing he had overstepped, \u00c9omer made an embarrassed grimace and replied:\n\"Please forgive my intrusion.\u201d\nIt was for this reason that \u00c9omer, to ease the atmosphere, offered her a delicacy typical of Rohan: a buttery apple turnover.\n\u201cI recall you particularly enjoyed it when you had the chance to taste it.\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel immediately understood that it was a gesture of peace, a way to apologize and to convey that his attentions were sincere. She took a bite, and when \u00c9omer saw her tongue licking the filling from her lips, he felt a shiver run down his spine. He struggled to maintain his composure, but within him, he was nearly going mad: may Bema help him, that girl would be his undoing!",

While the silence of the Shire reigns outside, within the home of Sam and Rosie, a vibrant atmosphere anticipates an event that will transform the tranquility of the night into a memorable moment for the hobbit family.",
        "comment": "The stars of evening already shone high in the sky above Bag End, the late roses and daffodils swayed in the gentle yet brisk breeze of early autumn, while the crickets lingered to sing their last summer songs and the frogs answered with their languid symphony. The hobbits slept peacefully in their comfortable beds, comforted by the crackling fires and the peace that had reigned in the Shire for many long years. Even the mayor's house was wrapped in silence and peace, save for a single light that shone in waiting. The lady of the house sat in the quiet, mending the small clothes that grew steadily into a larger pile in the basket at her feet. Her children lay asleep here and there, curled up on the sofa, nestled before the fire, clutching the large cushions adorned with gold and green designs of Rohan. Wooden blocks, rag dolls with pointed ears, toy horses, soldiers in Gondorian armor, and other toys were scattered on the floor, as if they had fallen into an enchanted sleep where their little owners had left them. Rosie shook her golden curls with a sigh; she had not been able to send the little ones to bed before their father's return. So, she had resigned herself to letting them stay up until their tired limbs, weary from a long day of games, races, and soon-settled squabbles, were overcome by the heavy blanket of sleep. She brought both hands to caress her belly, swollen with new life, and smiled at the baby's movement within. Her Sam often told her she was too indulgent with the children:\n\"They will say that the mayor of Bag End has raised a brood of wild goblins.\"\nHe would often chide, but Rosie would shrug with a smile and quietly respond:\n\"Let them say so, dear Sam. Let them say so.\"\nAnd when he continued to fret over the children\u2019s behavior, she would sternly retort:\n\"Have the respectable citizens of Hobbiton traveled to Mordor and helped bear the Ring through those dreadful lands even to its destruction? Have the honorable hobbits of Bag End who might offer reproach faced the unspeakable perils to which their mayor has been exposed? It is for these deeds that they place so much trust in you, not for how your children are raised.\"\nRosie, with her tireless love for the family, showed a protective fierceness akin to that of a weasel, and like the weasel, she stood with determination and agility, ready to defend every member of her family with strength and cunning. Now a stocky figure, cloaked in a heavy dark mantle, travel bags, and a staff, made its way up the path to the house. His shoulders were bowed toward the ground as if bearing the weight of days and roads traveled, but his step was merry, as much as his weariness allowed, as if his furry feet themselves were impatient to reach home. It was Frodo's ears, the second-born, that first caught the sound of the latch lifting, his little eyes snapped open as the young hobbit exclaimed:\n\"Papa! Papa is back!\"\nImmediately, his siblings woke to welcome the much-anticipated guest, while their mother tried to quell their excitement:\n\"Gently, Frodo! Hamfast, don't bump into your brothers! No, Merry, your father can't listen to your new song right now! Pippin, don't wave that wooden sword around, you might poke someone's eye out! Elanor, Rose, please help me up. Ooh. Come, Goldilocks, give me your hand.\"\nWhen Rosie finally managed to rise from her chair, Sam was already surrounded by the brood of little hobbits clamoring for his attention. He smiled, bestowing caresses, kisses, and words of praise. Rosie held onto the doorframe, observing the scene with tender eyes, but nothing was more loving than the look her husband gave her when their eyes met over the heads of their children.\nIt took a few more frenzied moments before the little hobbits could be persuaded to go to bed, too excited by Sam's return and unsettled by their interrupted first sleep, but finally the house was blessed by a quiet silence, enveloped in a darkness no longer filled with unknown terrors but rich with peace, like a cloak wrapping it in the warmth and tranquility of a safe haven. A single light still shone, the fire crackled cheerfully in the kitchen, casting a soft glow on the furniture and the time-worn wooden floor. Sam sat at the table, his feet still muddy, and a myriad of tiny lines around his blue eyes spoke of his weariness. He covered his open mouth with one hand in a yawn. Rosie bustled about him, nimble and quick despite her pregnancy. She asked:\n\"Have you eaten?\"\n\"A morsel on the road, but I wouldn't refuse a bowl of that good mushroom soup whose scent I caught from the start of the path.\"\nRosie chuckled as she placed a steaming bowl of soup in front of her husband, and Sam eagerly plunged his spoon into the soup, stuffing a large spoonful into his mouth. Rosie didn\u2019t have time to warn him before he withdrew with a groan, pressing both hands to his lips. With an indulgent smile, Rosie poured him a generous serving of wine:\n\"I was going to tell you to blow on it or you\u2019d burn yourself!\"\nSam mumbled something as he reached for the glass, taking a large gulp of wine to soothe his tongue. Rosie approached him lightly, an affectionate look passing between them as she sat at the table. She handed him a thick slice of toasted bread to dip in the soup. They spoke of their respective days in hushed voices so as not to wake the children, enjoying that moment of calm.\n\"It has been a long day,\" said Sam, lifting his tired but satisfied gaze. Rosie placed a hand on his shoulder:\n\"You brought the warmth of your presence into this cold night. We missed you so much...\"\nSam smiled, caressing his wife's hand in return:\n\"Let's say the little ones made that abundantly clear! And now that the house is warm, I can enjoy a bit of peace with my lady.\"\nThey rose together, and Rosie led him to the bath, helping him undress with loving gestures, gently washing away the weariness and grime of the journey along with the foam. Sam thanked her with a tender kiss as they slipped beneath the covers of their bed. The fire burned in the hearth, no less warm than the fires of their hearts. Sam took Rosie\u2019s hand in his, and she rested her head on his shoulder, their gazes intertwined as if it were the strongest bond at that moment, and indeed, it was so.",

        "comment": "\u00c9omer groaned as he lowered his bruised limbs into the icy water of the tub outside the barracks. He was one of the most promising riders of his generation, or so Commander Elfhelm had told his cousin Th\u00e9odred. \u00c9omer hadn\u2019t meant to eavesdrop, but nonetheless, his young chest had swelled with pride upon hearing it.\nBut now the bruises covering much of his body painfully reminded him that he had yet to tame a horse of his own. The water was cold, but his mind burned with frustration. He had failed to tame Firefoot, and the defeat weighed more heavily than the blows he had taken.\nA group of young riders passed by, laughing and joking, their faces already alight with the prospect of an evening in the tavern. One of them, a tousle-haired youth, glanced his way and laughed.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to bury my face between Beylith\u2019s sweet breasts!\u201d\nThe others joined in his laughter, urging their companion on as he gestured wildly, describing the curves of the young woman.\n\u201cThey say they are softer than the blankets of our commander!\u201d\n\u201cOh, speaking of the commander\u2019s blankets, our \u00c9omer knows something about that!\u201d added another companion with a lewd grin.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go suck Orom\u00eb\u2019s cock instead?\u201d \u00c9omer retorted darkly. Had he not been naked, he would have risen to teach those fools a lesson\u2014though it had happened before. But now, his body was too sore to incite a brawl.\n\u201cCome on, lads! Our \u00c9omer, after all his tumbles, must have a sore bum!\u201d\nAs the group moved away, \u00c9omer splashed the water with a hand, sending droplets flying all around. Let them go and have their fun; stallions were not tamed by idle chatter, and he would show them that. His thoughts returned to Th\u00e9odred and what his cousin had said. He didn\u2019t want to disappoint him. He had been chosen for something greater, \u00c9omer knew that. Yet, he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of failure. When they had lost their parents, Uncle Th\u00e9oden had taken him and his little sister in with open arms, raising them as his own children, and Th\u00e9odred had taken an immediate liking to them. \u00c9omer felt he owed much to them both, and it was his duty to make them proud.\nThat\u2019s why he had eagerly accepted the offer to join one of the eoreds of the Mark and had worked hard during training. Yet, when he first laid eyes on that horse, he had felt an immediate connection with the beast. Firefoot\u2019s powerful, taut muscles, his brooding gaze, and his temper, which seemed ready to send flames flaring from his nostrils at any moment, had discouraged more than one rider. In truth, even the most skilled horsemen had failed to tame him. And that was exactly what \u00c9omer wanted.\nFor the past several days and that very afternoon, \u00c9omer had attempted to tame him, but Firefoot had been just as determined not to cooperate. That afternoon, \u00c9omer had spent hours throwing the reins over Firefoot and trying to ride him bareback, only to be bucked off again and again\u2014once, twice, five, fifteen times. A decent circle of onlookers had gathered around the training ring, laughing, cheering, though whether for him or the horse, \u00c9omer wasn\u2019t sure.\nEven Commander Elfhelm and Th\u00e9odred had paused to watch. At first, \u00c9omer hadn\u2019t noticed, so focused was he on his efforts, drenched in sweat and thoroughly disheveled.\n\u201cHow long has this been going on? Perhaps you\u2019d have better luck with a pony, boy!\u201d Th\u00e9odred teased good-naturedly. \u00c9omer grimaced, attempting once again to stay on the unruly horse. Elfhelm chuckled.\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know for sure that he was a horse, I might mistake them both for two mules. I can\u2019t tell which of them is more stubborn.\u201d\nBut there was fondness in the commander\u2019s tone.\nNow, \u00c9omer rested his head on the edge of the tub with a sigh. The water had warmed a little, and the bruises hurt less, certainly less than his wounded pride. He looked up at the stars; Borgil glowed red beside the constellation Remmirath, the small blue flowers Varda had set in the skies before the beginning of time. \u00c9omer knew little of cosmology, but he cherished the legends of his ancestors, and the red fury of Borgil reminded him of the proud T\u00farin, Dragon-slayer. The air around him turned cold, and the boy shivered.\nHe heard a soft clatter of hooves and a gentle whinny coming from the stables nearby. The astute grumble of his empty stomach shook him from his melancholic stupor. An idea sparked in \u00c9omer\u2019s mind: if that horse was anything like him, as everyone joked, then there was one thing he surely couldn\u2019t resist.\nAfter hurriedly drying off and pulling on his tunic and boots, \u00c9omer crept into the kitchens, still thick with the scent of roasted meat and warm bread. He snatched half a honey loaf and soaked it in the savory, rich gravy left from the roast. Quickly, he darted to the barrels and crates filled with fruits and vegetables in the pantry and grabbed a few carrots and an apple. Slipping through the shadows of the barracks, he stealthily approached Firefoot\u2019s stall with his treasures hidden under his cloak.\nThe horse eyed him darkly, blowing warm air from his nostrils. When \u00c9omer attempted to stroke the soft hair of his nose, Firefoot kicked out, striking the wooden stall with a thundering thud.\n\u201cShh, easy there. Easy. I\u2019ve brought you something.\u201d\nHe held a large, juicy carrot under the horse\u2019s nose, letting Firefoot catch the scent of his fingers mingling with the treat. For a moment, the horse didn\u2019t move, only twitching his ears and flaring his nostrils.\nIf Firefoot was stubborn, \u00c9omer was no less so. They stood locked in a battle of wills for what felt like an eternity. At last, \u00c9omer\u2019s patience was rewarded. Slowly, and with a hint of wariness, Firefoot grasped the carrot with his teeth.\n\u201cGood lad. My fine steed. We\u2019ll be friends, you and I, won\u2019t we? Together, we\u2019ll do great things, win honor and glory.\u201d\nAs the horse crunched through the unusual offering, \u00c9omer rubbed the dark, velvety coat between his ears, showering him with praises and soft words.\nIt took more than two carrots, however, to win over the moody horse. Days of patient dedication, furtive nighttime visits to the stables, bruises, and gentle strokes were needed. But at last, Firefoot began to tolerate his presence. Slowly, through praise, bruises, caresses, and rewards, \u00c9omer earned his trust.\nFor a few weeks, it seemed as though \u00c9omer had given up on taming the brooding stallion, but that morning, under the curious and watchful eyes of Th\u00e9odred and the commander, \u00c9omer made his long-prepared display. He leapt onto Firefoot\u2019s back, who bucked and tossed his head, but \u00c9omer\u2019s hands held the reins firmly. Before the astonished gaze of his comrades-in-arms, the young rider spurred Firefoot into a gallop, and with a mighty leap, they soared over the fence\u2014right over the commander\u2019s head. A chorus of cheers greeted his feat, and when \u00c9omer wheeled the horse around and returned, he saw a newfound respect in his cousin\u2019s eyes.",

        "comment": "Thiten H\u00fbb began as a small fishing village, then became a charming trading port, and finally transformed into a delightful and exclusive holiday resort. Over the years, even the princes of Dol Amroth found refuge in this enchanting place with their families. It was situated in a small bay, well protected from stormy winds and waves that could erode its shores, as well as from the incursions of the pirates of Umbar. A villa of rough white stone, called B\u00e2r L\u00e1ranen, stood almost perched over the sea. Pink and violet bougainvillea climbed along its walls, and a row of olive trees, myrtles, and lemons surrounded and concealed it from view. A staircase carved into the rock led down to the small private cove, where a dock was built, and the princes' boats were always moored. These said princes, all young men between eighteen and twenty-five years of age, dressed in cool raw linen tunics and trousers rolled up to their ankles, were busy joking amongst themselves. They threw jests and colorful skeins of thread at each other and splashed water with their bare feet. Their laughter rose high into the light turquoise sky, rivaling the cries of the seagulls.\nNot far away, sitting with a discontented expression and her chin resting on her hand, Loth\u00edriel watched them with pouting lips. This particular year she felt more isolated than ever: during the winter she had given her first tribute as a woman and now could no longer participate in the rambunctious activities she loved to do with her brothers and cousins. She still remembered when just the year before, she could lift her skirts and walk barefoot around one of the boats while Elphir called her:\n\"Come, Looloo, help us prepare the nets!\"\n\"Alright, but I would like to come with you!\"\nErchirion had smiled and tousled her hair:\n\"You're too little for these things. Maybe next time.\"\nShe had turned her face away, annoyed, and had sighed in despair:\n\"Always next time...\"\nMeanwhile, the three brothers had boarded the boat, and as they moved away on the sparkling water, Amrothos had shouted back to her, laughing:\n\"Don't worry, Looloo. I'll teach you to fish next time. I promise!\"\nBut now that she was old enough to follow her brothers, that same condition prevented her from joining them. While the court at B\u00e2r L\u00e1ranen was small and life more relaxed, Loth\u00edriel found herself facing the new restrictions imposed by her transition to adulthood, making her even more annoyed and frustrated.\n\"Loth\u00edriel, straighten those shoulders and wear your hat.\"\nThe stern but gentle voice of her aunt Ivrinel cut through the air, her authoritative commands ringing clearly. Loth\u00edriel immediately straightened up, but in a tiny act of rebellion refused to wear the hat, letting the sun's glare hide her impending tears. She dearly loved her aunt, who had tried to be a guardian and affectionate companion since her mother's death, but she was not yet ready to yield to the impositions of her new condition.\nBored, she sat on the small woven straw chair and watched her aunt placidly weaving cotton thread. Amrothos noticed his sister's gaze and approached her quietly:\n\"Hey, Looloo, you could make yourself useful and learn as well: then you could weave our nets!\"\nLoth\u00edriel jumped and replied sharply:\n\"Don't call me that.\"\nShe tried to maintain her composure, and even though she adored her childhood nickname, it made her feel small and vulnerable. But Erchirion gave a complicit chuckle and supported his brother:\n\"And maybe you could wipe that gloomy expression off your face: you're making the sky darken!\"\n\"Ah, leave it be, Erchirion,\" Amrothos intervened, \"She's just upset because she can't play like a child anymore.\"\nShe glanced at her elder brother Elphir, who ignored her completely, focused on the fishing gear, making her feel even more invisible and isolated.\nAs every summer, the older cousins from Minas Tirith used to spend a few weeks at Thiten H\u00fbb as guests of their uncle, to rest from the exertions of academic studies and military training. Mostly, to escape the atmosphere of sadness and the suffocating pressure always present in the Steward's house.\nEven Faramir had approached her and smiled with an expression of pity in his eyes. This hurt her more than anything, but she stoically pressed her lips together. Faramir said gently:\n\"Don't fret too much, nethig: we will catch a fish for you. The fattest and tenderest, and we will roast it tonight with the most fragrant herbs in your honor.\"\n\"It's not the same.\"\nShe replied sullenly. He shrugged, being used to sharp responses and brusque manners since childhood. Even now, away from the pressure of Minas Tirith, Faramir maintained that patient calm he had learned as a child. He pulled back his hair and, with a little smile, went to confer with Elphir. Loth\u00edriel immediately regretted the rudeness she had shown to Faramir, hunched back over her chair, and bit her lip. At that moment, Boromir turned towards her, haloed by the sun's reflection. His long black hair waved in the breeze, and to her eyes, he appeared as one of those legendary heroes of ancient times: Beren or Tuor or even Elendil, whom she used to sigh over during her evening readings. Boromir, in turn, approached the young girl with an enchanting smile, and she immediately straightened up and tucked a dark curl behind her ear. If Faramir, with his sweetness and patience, was close to her heart as a brother, Boromir, with his charisma and imposing presence, represented everything she imagined in a hero. When he smiled at her, her heart began to beat faster, and Loth\u00edriel felt nervous and happy. For some time now, thinking about her cousin caused a sort of stir that made her agitated and euphoric at the same time, as if she had drunk a few drops too many of the sweet rose wine that Aunt Ivrinel hid in her dresser. Boromir addressed her playfully:\n\"So, little one, why don't you come fishing with us anymore?\"\nLoth\u00edriel squirmed in her chair as she felt the heat rise to her cheeks:\n\"It's just... that... I can't anymore.\"\nShe stammered, trying not to reveal too much. She was terribly embarrassed by her secret, yet she felt the need to appear mature and worthy in front of him, though somewhat intimidated by his presence. A flash of understanding crossed Boromir's blue eyes, so he crouched beside her and said in a warm, reassuring voice:\n\"Don't worry, Loth\u00edriel, we will find something fun to do together.\"\nBeing called by her full name made her feel special and important. She couldn't suppress a flirtatious smile as she asked:\n\"Really?\"\n\"Yes, really. Gweston!\"\nHe replied with a warm, enveloping laugh, placing a hand on his heart. Then he stood up and gave her a gentle pat on the head before joining the other boys. Loth\u00edriel watched him go, feeling the spot where he had touched her sizzle, her heart still in turmoil. She hoped he would keep his promise, and her lips curled into a satisfied smile.\n\"Loth\u00edriel, come help me with this thread.\"\nThe firm but gentle voice of her aunt called her back to reality. Indeed, Ivrinel's attentive eyes had not missed the sighs and yearnings of her niece. Loth\u00edriel sighed slightly but obediently approached her aunt. As she walked over, she cast one last glance at the boys on the boat sailing away on the shimmering sea. With a sigh, she began to work alongside Ivrinel, but her mind kept returning to that smile and that promise. She vowed that one day she would find a way to spend time alone with Boromir, and that thought filled her heart with a sweet and eager anticipation.",

        "comment": "Sunlight filtered into \u00c9owyn\u2019s bedchamber, casting gentle spirals of dust in the air. Naive had just drawn back the curtains, letting the morning light flood the room. The faithful handmaiden moved quietly, careful not to disturb her lady. After arranging the pillows, she curtsied and made her way to the door to fetch the breakfast tray. On the threshold, she met Faramir, who smiled at her kindly.\n\u201cGo on, Naive. I will take it from here.\u201d\nHe spoke with his usual calm and reassuring voice. Naive cast one last glance at her lady to ensure she was awake and then curtsied again, leaving the room. Faramir approached the bed quietly, his gaze immediately settling on \u00c9owyn. She was still lying amidst the bedclothes, her hair disheveled, though already more animated than in recent days. Despite her weariness, a renewed light shone in her eyes, and her cheeks no longer looked so pale. She greeted him with a shy smile.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here. I\u2019m hardly presentable.\u201d\nFaramir sat at the edge of the bed and took her hand.\n\u201cAnd where do you think I\u2019ve been while you were unwell, my love? Not even Naive could keep me away.\u201d\n\u201cFoolish husband. You look just as worn, with shadows under your eyes.\u201d\nFaramir shook his head as if to brush off such concerns.\n\u201cDo you feel up to eating something? Here, drink this; it\u2019s warm.\u201d\nHe offered her a steaming cup of chamomile and buttered a small scone. \u00c9owyn accepted the tea eagerly but shook her head when he moved to feed her, though she brushed her hand against his jaw in thanks.\n\u201cWould you call for Naive, please? I need a bath after this long illness.\u201d\n\u00c9owyn\u2019s attempt to rise from the pillows betrayed her lingering weakness. Faramir, who had remained by her side, watched her with a gentle yet resolute expression.\n\u201cI\u2019ve given Naive the morning off. She, too, worked tirelessly to tend to you.\u201d\n\u00c9owyn huffed, crossing her arms, though her hands quickly fell back into her lap, as if her weariness prevented her from holding them up for long.\n\u201cBut I need a bath! Perhaps Nestriell or Reanna could\u2026\u201d\nHer voice sounded impatient, yet carried an undertone of fatigue. Faramir laughed softly and rose, moving toward the hearth, where a fire crackled softly.\n\u201cI will attend to it. I\u2019ve already had plenty of hot water brought up and the fire stoked.\u201d\nReturning to her side, he stopped a mere step away, his tone calm yet resolute.\n\u201cYou\u2019re under no obligation. Perhaps you should not even see me in such a state,\u201d murmured \u00c9owyn, averting her gaze, her cheeks tinged with a faint blush. Faramir leaned down, taking her hand and pressing a gentle kiss to her fingers.\n\u201cBut I wish to. And do you not?\u201d\nHis words were a soft whisper, and his eyes met \u00c9owyn\u2019s, which, for a moment, glistened with a rare brightness, freed from their burden of shame. Gently, he helped her rise from the bed, slipping soft lapin slippers onto her feet and guiding her to the adjacent bath. Like the rest of Emyn Arnen\u2019s castle, it was crafted from pale stone, lit by grand arched windows draped in heavy curtains. \u00c9owyn missed the warmth of Meduseld\u2019s wooden walls and floors, where one could walk barefoot without a chill. A merry fire crackled in the hearth, and soft white rugs surrounded the large tub. Before the fire, a few metal buckets were steaming, and Faramir poured the hot water into the tub, adding a few drops of peony-scented oil. With a small sigh, \u00c9owyn allowed herself to be led toward the tub. Though she longed to shake off the remnants of illness, the idea of Faramir seeing her in such a state weighed heavily upon her. Yet his hand, so strong and certain in hers, brought comfort, though\u2026 there was still a small knot of shame she couldn\u2019t quite untangle.\n\u201cI must be dreadful: my hair is all matted, and I must smell\u2014\u201d\nShe made a face, but Faramir gave no sign of hearing her complaint, guiding her carefully into the warm water. \u00c9owyn couldn\u2019t help a small sigh of relief.\n\u201cWhere would you like to begin?\u201d\n\u201cMy hair.\u201d\nFaramir\u2019s lips lifted into a slight smile, and he lathered soap in his hands. With gentle strokes, he worked the suds through her flaxen hair, untangling it carefully. He relished the feel of her hair in his hands, the weight of it, its familiar silken strands. Once her hair was thoroughly lathered, he began massaging her scalp in slow circles with his fingertips. \u00c9owyn sighed languidly, her eyes closing as she relaxed into the soothing rhythm, shifting subtly in the water, causing soft ripples. She adored the feel of his hands on her, whether in tender caresses like these or in rougher embraces no less devoted than this one. The fire crackled, releasing its soothing scent, and outside, the daylight began to wane, casting shadows across the bath.\n\u201cWait, I\u2019ll light a few candles.\u201d\nFaramir rose and moved around the room, lighting several long beeswax candles that filled the space with a faint honeyed fragrance. \u00c9owyn stirred.\n\u201cLeave them. It would spare you from seeing these graceless limbs.\u201d\n\u201cOh, foolish wife! Even were you withered like an apple forgotten in a cook\u2019s basket, I could not love you less than I do now.\u201d\nFaramir returned to her side, pressing a soft kiss to her brow.\n\u201cYou always manage to charm with those lofty words of yours. But not even the sweetest Elvish songs could turn back time.\u201d\nShe said this with a small splash in his direction, to which Faramir laughed heartily and replied:\n\u201cNo, time flows ever onward. But it cannot weaken the love I bear for you. Now, raise your arms.\u201d\nWith deliberate movements, Faramir passed a cloth infused with fragrant foam under her arms, along the curve of her shoulders, collarbones, and neck. She inhaled the delicate fragrance rising from the water, pleased at the thought that it would soon linger upon her skin. A strand of Faramir\u2019s dark hair brushed against her shoulder as he leaned closer to her ear.\n\u201cStand,\nmelethril n\u00een\n(my love): I want to rinse you thoroughly.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019ll be soaked!\u201d\n\u00c9owyn protested, for she still enjoyed the warmth of the bath and wasn\u2019t quite ready to reveal the scars and marks that time had etched upon her. Faramir smiled, pulling his hair back and fastening it in a knot behind his head.\n\u201cA small price I\u2019ll gladly pay for so fair a sight! Come now, don\u2019t make me do all the work.\u201d\nHe kissed her shoulder playfully, making her shiver. \u00c9owyn sighed, then rose to her feet, placing a hand on her husband\u2019s shoulder to steady herself. Laughing, she wrapped her arms around him in defiance, just as he had prophesied.\n\u201cOh,\ndagnirig\n!\u201d\nFaramir muttered in playful resignation, using the Sindarin word which she knew meant little bratt. To appease him, she showered his lips and jaw with light kisses. Smiling, Faramir rose to fetch another bucket of warm water, while \u00c9owyn wrung out her hair. Turning back to her, he nearly caught his breath: water ran down her alabaster skin, and her hair, gathered to one side, draped over her shoulder. To his eyes, she appeared like a Maia risen from the waters.\n\u00c9owyn looked at him, unsettled by the intensity of his gaze. She felt vulnerable, as though he saw something in her that she herself would never deem worthy of such adoration. Faramir shook his head with a gentle smile. He stepped closer, dipping a cloth in clean water, then softly swept it over her arms, her shoulders, down her body. Silence thick with intimacy stretched between them, filled only by the delicate dripping of rain and the faint hiss of candles. Without breaking their gaze, Faramir knelt and brushed his lips tenderly against her abdomen.\n\u201cDo you see? Always you bring me to my knees, \u00c9owyn.\u201d\nHer cheeks flushed, and despite herself, she felt flattered, a sweet confusion stirring within her. Meeting her reflection in his adoring eyes, she finally saw herself as radiant and beautiful\u2014an image that banished all her shame, leaving only the knowledge of a love that saves and heals.",

        "comment": "On that warm July evening, Merethrond, the Great Hall of Feasts, echoed with cheerful chatter, the clinking of glasses, the clangor of cutlery, ringing laughter, and the notes of musical instruments that rose high into the air. The nobility of Gondor and neighboring realms had gathered in the Royal Citadel of Minas Tirith for one of the many celebrations hosted by Queen Arwen. After the material and moral ruins left by the War and the many years of Darkness, much had to be rebuilt in terms of human and diplomatic relationships. Alliances were formed, and marriages were arranged. Nothing widened hearts like a good Gondorian meal and a sweet Elvish dance, according to Arwen, and Aragorn wholeheartedly agreed. The little ones from the Shire had taught them that life was a whirlwind of adventures, shared meals, cheerful songs, and love always worth living.\nHowever, a delicate figure slipped away from the Hall of Feasts, blending into the shadows of the night. She wandered through the great halls in search of silence and peace, crossed one of the stone courtyards, and circled the fountain without being seen by the guards standing before the flowering White Tree. She reached the building designated to host dignitaries and stopped by a window, seeking relief from the burdens of her princely condition. Seated on a bench, she gazed at the flowers in the small garden before her. The night was warm, and the constellations of Menelvagor with the red Borgil and Remmirath farther north shone brightly, and even the star E\u00e4rendil glowed faintly as if veiled by the sky. Not a breath of breeze stirred the leaves and petals: anemones, asphodels, roses, and golden laburnums drooped their heads, their colors dull as if they too were lifeless from the heat. With a sigh, Loth\u00edriel slipped off her uncomfortable yet delicate slippers and for a moment enjoyed the cool marble under her feet.\nShe was warm, her hairpins pricked her head, and her blue dress, encrusted with pearls, weighed heavily on her shoulders. As the princess of Dol Amroth, she was devoted to following all the protocols her rank demanded, but she was tired and would have preferred to spend the evening in her quarters or, better yet, at the small summer house her family owned in Cobas Haven, a place of refuge for holidays. But something, or rather someone, kept her there: the handsome King of Rohan, to whom her father had promised her, and the hope that he would accept her hand, if not for her beauty, at least for the dynastic advantages their union would bring.\nIt was thus that \u00c9omer saw her: the princess sitting by the window, her figure slightly hunched, her long black hair gracefully styled in an updo, with a few artfully scattered curls. However, \u00c9omer\u2019s heart sank as he noticed the unhappy expression on her beautiful round face resting on her hand. It seemed to him that it was not right to spy on her so covertly, despite Loth\u00edriel's enchanting and alluring beauty. So, he cleared his throat and revealed his presence:\n\"Princess, there you are at last!\"\nLoth\u00edriel started in surprise at hearing him speak so suddenly. \u00c9omer, noticing her distress, softened his usual stern expression:\n\"Oh, I apologize if I startled you, my lady.\"\nLoth\u00edriel quickly composed herself, internally thanking her training, and nonchalantly attempted to slip her slippers back on. With a smile, she replied:\n\"No disturbance, I was merely lost in thought. Were you looking for me, Your Majesty?\"\n\"Indeed, your lord father sent your brothers to find you, and Amrothos enlisted my aid.\"\n\"You would not have come to seek me otherwise?\"\nLoth\u00edriel's grey eyes sparkled with mischief. \u00c9omer stepped slightly closer to her and allowed a small smile:\n\"Would you have allowed yourself to be found? The way you slipped away from the reception, I had the impression you sought a more secluded place.\"\nLoth\u00edriel sighed, torn between revealing her woes sincerely or showing only the nobler side of her role:\n\"In truth, I am a bit tired and overheated.\"\n\u00c9omer nodded, appreciating her candor, being himself accustomed to such directness. They remained silent for a moment, Loth\u00edriel gazing at the starry night and \u00c9omer observing her profile. Then she said:\n\"At this time of year, a sea breeze always blows at home: it carries the aromatic scent of coastal plants and the salty fragrance of shells and seaweed. Here it is so sultry that I cannot even smell the flowers.\"\nLoth\u00edriel wrinkled her nose as if she could perceive the scents she had evoked: broom, arbutus, honeysuckle, laurel, and rockrose with small white and pink flowers, and the briny aroma of seaweed mixed with the balsamic scent of maritime pines.\n\u00c9omer shifted his weight from one foot to the other and scratched his blonde beard, uncertain. Though he was educated as a noble warrior should be, he had been too occupied with his role as Marshal of the Mark and was more accustomed to decapitating Orcs than courting noble maidens.\n\"Do you miss home, Princess?\"\nLoth\u00edriel turned to him and shook her head, smiling as a few black locks escaped their pins. She did not want to give the impression of being unable to maintain composure regarding her homeland, so she quickly replied:\n\"Oh, not at all. I am merely bored, and the excess of emotions loosens my tongue without restraint. Please, do not heed my foolish words.\"\nHowever, now that Loth\u00edriel had mentioned it, \u00c9omer could not take his eyes off her full, rosy lips. He wondered if they would be as sweet and juicy as the fruits they resembled. He chastised himself for that ungentlemanly thought and sighed, flaring his nostrils.\n\"If that is the case, allow me to escort you to your quarters. I will ensure that no one will reproach your early departure.\"\nLoth\u00edriel nodded, appreciating \u00c9omer's kindness. She rose from the bench, gathered her things, and approached the King of Rohan.\n\"Thank you, my lord. It is a most courteous gesture.\"\n\"I am not entirely unfamiliar with good manners, though I spend much of my time among soldiers and horses.\"\n\u00c9omer replied stiffly, returning to his usual stern demeanor and pressing his lips together beneath his beard. Loth\u00edriel covered her mouth with her hand, mortified:\n\"Forgive my thoughtlessness, Your Majesty. Naturally, I meant no offense.\"\nThe girl's cheeks darkened, revealing her embarrassment. Fascinated by her sincerity and grace, \u00c9omer set aside his natural gruffness and forced a smile. He offered her his arm, and with a sigh, Loth\u00edriel leaned on his solid frame. They walked in silence for a few minutes along the majestic corridors, whose walls were adorned with finely carved bas-reliefs and delicate Elvish tapestries brought in dowry by the queen. The bas-reliefs depicted the epic deeds of the great kings of Gondor, and the tapestries, with their intricate patterns, portrayed scenes from Valinor and Lothl\u00f3rien, woven with silver and gold threads that gleamed in the torchlight. The high ceiling was supported by elegantly sculpted white marble columns, and here and there, niches contained statues of historical figures, heroes of the past who seemed to watch the two young people as they advanced.\nThe air was filled with the scent of beeswax and the faint aroma of the medicinal herbs that the court healers used to keep the environment healthy. \u00c9omer\u2019s hand pressed gently on Loth\u00edriel's fingers. He wished he could be as gallant as Th\u00e9odred, as charming as the Dol Amroth brothers, or as admirable as Lord Aragorn; instead, he desperately sought something to say to the beautiful princess. Something interesting and refined as befitting a lady of her rank, and not the vain and coarse words of a soldier that rose to his lips. For her part, Loth\u00edriel was grateful for the soft torchlight and her amber skin, which partly concealed the heat that rose from her shoulders to her cheeks. The close proximity of the Lord of the Horses, his measured step, and his serious expression intrigued and fascinated her. And even frightened her a little. How could she penetrate the armor of this man, which she now knew was made not only of leather and metal? She was pondering this when she missed a step, and her slipper slipped off her foot.\n\"I beg your pardon. The dances must have tired me more than I thought.\"\n\"I noticed your uncertain steps. If you are in pain, you may take those things off your feet.\"\nThe horrified expression on Loth\u00edriel's face was all the response \u00c9omer received. At home, she would not have hesitated to remove her slippers, but Gondorian customs did not permit such improprieties. \u00c9omer snorted in amusement and impulsively asked:\n\"Your quarters are not far, are they?\"\n\"No, past those arches and left down the corridor. But why... oh!\"\nWith a gesture, \u00c9omer lifted Loth\u00edriel into his arms and resumed their walk. She could have protested vigorously at such audacity, but instead, after a moment of bewilderment, she rested her face on the broad chest of the King. She appreciated his strength and his distinctive scent, the warmth emanating from his chest, the solid robustness of his biceps, and the beat of his heart. She lifted her face and wondered how soft his beard was and if he would ever let her braid his hair. At that thought, Loth\u00edriel\u2019s heart skipped a beat, and before other improper thoughts could disturb her\nmaidenly mind, \u00c9omer gently set her down before her door.\nLoth\u00edriel bowed her head in a courteous nod of thanks while \u00c9omer stood stiffly before her. Only at that moment, in fact, did the Lord of the Horses realize how inappropriate his impulsive gesture had been and how it could be a source of discontent. He would never have wanted to put Loth\u00edriel in a compromising position that could embarrass her. He mumbled something like a good night, and Loth\u00edriel had to stifle a giggle as she watched the mighty King of the Mark practically flee with burning cheeks.",

        "comment": "The Citadel and all of Minas Tirith buzzed with activity: though still scarred by the wounds of war, the Gondorians wasted no time in striving to rebuild and repair the damage. Carts, workers, carpenters, joiners, blacksmiths, and even a few dwarves swarmed in and out, engaged in their labor of reconstruction. Additionally, in a few days' time, the funeral procession for Th\u00e9oden, King of Rohan, would depart to return his mortal remains to his ancestral lands, making the life of the court quite busy as well.\nAs a princess, Loth\u00edriel had to oversee the preparations for those who would follow the procession to Rohan. She took her duties very seriously, aware of her destiny and the responsibilities it entailed. Since birth, she had been trained to fulfill her duties as a lady of the castle. She could do sums and write, speak Westron, Sindarin, and Ad\u00fbnaic. She sat in councils with her father and brothers and even had the right to speak. She knew how to oversee a kitchen and a hall and, if she put in great effort, could even do some embroidery. She knew botany and the properties of plants: medicinal, edible, or poisonous.\nShe had been taught the art of diplomacy and could discern if a trade contract was favorable or not. She knew how to swim and, thanks to lessons secretly given by her brothers, could also sail a small boat and read the skies. For these reasons, she found herself in Minas Tirith, overseeing all the activities of the traveling Dol Amrothian court, as well as being put on display like a horse at the fair.\nSpeaking of horses, Loth\u00edriel wrinkled her nose as a waft of manure reached her. She paused to try to orient herself: she had been told to take two left turns and the third corridor on the right. She was convinced she had followed the directions but had evidently become lost in the labyrinthine part of the Citadel. In truth, she was distracted: she had been thinking of nothing but the young King of Rohan and their encounter a few evenings before. She still smiled, recalling \u00c9omer\u2019s embarrassed face when he realized that picking up a high-ranking princess was not a proper gesture. And she felt warm and flustered when she thought of his strong body pressed against hers and the desire to be nestled in his arms again. She retraced her steps and tried turning left, only to find herself in the stables.\nShe tried to stay calm, despite being in the last place she wanted to be. Although she knew how to ride a horse when necessary, such as during official processions, she had always been apprehensive around those large animals. She appreciated their sleek beauty but found them too sensitive and unpredictable. Her nervousness often reflected on them, making them even more agitated and difficult to manage. Thus, when she heard a snort and the clatter of hooves, Loth\u00edriel jumped, glad the horses' stalls were closed. As she tried to get her bearings and figure out how to retrace her steps, a familiar voice with a heavy accent from the Mark interrupted her thoughts.\n\u201cPrincess?\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel forced herself to appear calm despite her initial agitation and smiled, replying:\n\u201cMajesty, we seem to meet in the most unusual places!\u201d\n\u00c9omer smiled:\n\u201cWhat brings you to the lower recesses of the Citadel?\u201d\n\u201cI was looking for the storerooms, but I fear I am lost.\u201d\n\u201cIf you don't mind, I would gladly escort you to your destination. But do not fret; it is very easy to get lost in this labyrinth. Even I, who often come to the stables, have found myself disoriented.\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel relaxed and took the arm \u00c9omer offered her:\n\u201cIn that case, I feel less at fault and gladly accept your guidance!\u201d\nAt that moment, a large brown horse lunged towards the gate of its stall, having caught the scent of its master. Loth\u00edriel, unable to help herself, jumped and squealed in fear.\n\u201cBe at ease, that is Firefoot, my horse. He must have caught my scent and probably expects a treat. Allow me to greet him, though I have already done so not long ago.\u201d\n\u00c9omer moved, expecting Loth\u00edriel to follow, but she remained rooted to the spot. He narrowed his brown eyes slightly and scratched his beard.\n\u201cAre you not curious to see the famous horses of Rohan?\u201d\n\u201cOh, truly I can wait here while you tend to your duty.\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel replied nervously, having no intention of venturing into the stables. \u00c9omer's lips stretched into a smile beneath his beard. Once again, the princess showed signs of uncertainty in his presence, not without a certain satisfaction: it was yet another opportunity for him to display himself and court the fair noblewoman. Perhaps to make amends for the misstep of a few evenings prior, though he did not regret it and his arms still nostalgically recalled the sweet weight of the girl. He nudged her gently in a good-natured manner:\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to deny the King of Rohan the pleasure of your company, would you?\u201d\nHe extended his arm, looking at Loth\u00edriel with eyes sparkling with mischief. \u00c9omer was not enthusiastic about his title or the burdens it entailed. He did not feel ready or capable of governing a country: that should have been Th\u00e9odred\u2019s burden and honor. Yet, in this case, the young man had no qualms about leveraging his title. Sometimes it could be amusing. Loth\u00edriel smiled tightly, unable to refuse a direct request from a king.\n\u201cNever! Lead the way, please.\u201d\nWith one hand she lifted her gown and with the other leaned on \u00c9omer\u2019s arm, who smiled with satisfaction. They ventured into the dim stables, illuminated only by the many high-placed slits. A heavy animal scent filled the air, mitigated only by the smell of fresh hay. Neighs, snorts, and hoofbeats greeted the visitors. \u00c9omer walked confidently, greeting the horses and taking pleasure in the princess\u2019s hand gripping his forearm more tightly.\n\u201cHere, this is Firefoot, my companion in arms and faithful steed.\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel jumped back when \u00c9omer\u2019s horse enthusiastically thrust its head out to greet its master. \u00c9omer clicked his tongue and stroked the animal between the nostrils. He turned to Loth\u00edriel:\n\u201cWould you like to try, my lady?\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel raised her hand and tentatively placed it on Firefoot\u2019s muzzle, keeping it still for a moment, awaiting the horse\u2019s reaction. \u00c9omer placed his hand over hers, guiding it gently over the sleek coat. Loth\u00edriel shivered, unsure if it was from the warmth of \u00c9omer\u2019s hand or the pleasure of stroking the horse\u2019s muzzle, which snorted softly, pleased.\n\u201cYou are fortunate, princess: usually Firefoot is not so accommodating with strangers. In truth, sometimes not even with me!\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel chuckled, reassured by the horse\u2019s behavior and thrilled by \u00c9omer\u2019s proximity, who had not yet lifted his hand from hers. He leaned down to her ear:\n\u201cI gather you do not frequent stables often. A real pity to deprive yourself of the company of such noble creatures.\u201d\nThe warm breath of the King tickled Loth\u00edriel\u2019s bare neck, sending a delightful shiver down her spine. She turned, slipping her hand from under \u00c9omer\u2019s.\n\u201cIndeed, they are splendid animals, though their company is not my preference.\u201d\n\u00c9omer fetched an apple from one of the saddlebags and handed it to the princess to feed the horse. Loth\u00edriel felt scrutinized by the sharp brown eyes watching her intently, with only the creases at the corners betraying \u00c9omer\u2019s secret amusement.\n\u201cYet, the Queen of Rohan is expected to have a certain familiarity with horses: to ride, groom, and manage them completely. After all, we are the Lords of Horses. And so should be their Queen.\u201d\n\u201cAre you so certain I will be your Queen?\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel\u2019s lips curved into a smile as she observed the confusion on \u00c9omer\u2019s face:\n\u201cAh... but your father has offered...\u201d\n\u201cAda may have proposed, but the final decision rests with me.\u201d\nThe princess\u2019s eyes sparkled with playful mischief. \u00c9omer quickly recovered from his moment of confusion, a determined smile appearing on his face. He guided Loth\u00edriel to another stall, placing a firm yet gentle hand on her back. He liked the princess, he decided. Not only for her undeniable beauty: \u00c9omer was fascinated by her soft curves and the amber color of her skin, which added an exotic touch to her charm. But also her cheerful and straightforward character, with that hint of Gondorian reserve, uplifted his spirits, and B\u00e9ma knew how much he needed that. They stopped before a horse less impetuous than Firefoot but equally majestic.\n\u201cShe is Goldwena, daughter of Snowmane,  Th\u00e9oden King\u2019s horse.\u201d\n\u00c9omer paused for a moment, unable to continue. Loth\u00edriel placed a comforting hand on his arm in silent support. \u00c9omer straightened and gave her a grateful smile. He moved to one of the nearby posts where various stable tools hung and took a curry comb.\n\u201cI\u2019ve a feeling that after so many male hands, perhaps this beauty would appreciate a feminine touch. Come, do you know how to groom a horse?\u201d\nHe handed her the curry comb, waiting for her to take it. Loth\u00edriel accepted the tool with some reluctance, but her curiosity was piqued.\n\u201cIt would be an honor to learn from you, \u00c9omer King.\u201d\n\u00c9omer showed her how to use the curry comb, moving her hand calmly and precisely along the horse\u2019s coat.\n\u201cThe Rohan\u2019s horses, especially the Mearas, are known for their strength, intelligence, and loyalty. They are direct descendants of the noble horses of Nahar, the steed of the god Orom\u00eb. Goldwena, as you see, has a coat that requires careful attention.\u201d\nLoth\u00edriel listened intently, replicating \u00c9omer\u2019s movements on Goldwena\u2019s back.\n\u201cThe horses of Dol Amroth are smaller and lighter,\u201d she responded while continuing to groom. \u201cThey need to be agile to run on the sands of our coasts and compact enough to be easily embarked. They do not possess the majesty of the Mearas, but they are equally valiant.\u201d\n\u00c9omer nodded, observing with interest how Loth\u00edriel was beginning to gain confidence with the horse. From the saddlebag, he pulled out a carrot and fed it to the animal, stroking her tenderly and murmuring softly:\n\u201cGood girl.\u201d\nFor a moment, Loth\u00edriel imagined what it felt like to be the recipient of such praise, and the thought made her cheeks warm. Her lord father may have arranged the marriage, but while she had the final say, Loth\u00edriel would not refuse the candidate chosen for her. As she watched \u00c9omer out of the corner of her eye, stroking Goldwena\u2019s muzzle, none of the geopolitical considerations that had put her in this position crossed her mind. Her eyes and her heart were already full of \u00c9omer alone.",
