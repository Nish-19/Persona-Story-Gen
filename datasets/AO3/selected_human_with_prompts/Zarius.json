Tapping her foot on the floor.\n\u201cAnger of the righteous variety. 100 percent\u201d Peter replied.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much that, it\u2019s just...I\u2019m five percent disappointed\u201d\nPeter raised an eyebrow, most curious.\n\u201cDisappointed always hurts\u201d he admitted.\n\u201cI mean, you could have come back with more than cuts and bruises\u201d she continued.\n\u201cOr not come back at all, you don\u2019t need to bring it up\u201d Peter said, trying to assert control of his own reprimanding, to take ownership of what he had done.\n\u201cYou just did\u201d MJ replied, her arms folded, she stared upward at the ceiling, then directed her looks to Peter, her expression shifted from a stern disciplinarian to lustful and loving.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the five percent comes from Tiger, five percent I can handle, and five percent I can mend\u201d\nMJ skilfully undid her belt buckle, and slid out of her jeans.\nShe walked over to Peter and wrapped her arms around him, gently pressing her lips to his nose and giving it a gentle peck. Her right hand brushed delicately against his bruised features.\n\u201cShow me the suit\u201d she said.\nPeter obliged, and conjured forth his outfit.\n\u201cHow does it look on me?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s... enterprising.

I know I haven\u2019t left second or third gear yet, but when I shift gears, it has to be full on Turbo. I can\u2019t get across the track without someone waiting at the finish line. Be that for me MJ, help me race ahead\u201d\nMJ pricked his nose with a gentle tap of her fingertip before wrapping both arms around her shirt and tugged it over her head. She quickly unhooked her bra and stood before Peter wearing nothing but a black thong.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to take me out there, into the city, into the wild, I\u2019m going to feel the barren sky on my naked back, I\u2019m going to take in the sights, the sounds, the scents, the sensations of the day, and then you are going to carry me home...and after that, we\u2019re going for a run of a different sort...and, tiger, for my sake, you\u2019d\nbest not finish\n\u201d",

Uncomplicated, sure of themselves, ready for anything.\nThese were the days and years where she felt most welcome.\nNow, with Roberto, a boy, a friend, and a bit of both combined, critically injured a few meters away from her, she realized she was no longer here to play, not when there was a price to pay.\nShe stood before her enemy; her thoughts cast themselves back to the first few words she had uttered to Roberto when he had dropped in on her earlier in the day, after her birthday plans had been denied to her.\n\u201cMagneto is a jerk\u201d\nAnd how appropriate now, that the foe she was staring down, draped in his all too familiar crimson red and purple armour, helmet attached, a formidable and seemingly impenetrable energy bubble surrounding him, was the physical embodiment of that who had jerked her around.\nThis wasn\u2019t a game, but it felt as though this was still playtime.\nCould she still have fun even if it were all business?\n\u201cI am Magneto, master of magnet\u201d decreed the simulation.\n\u201cCome again?\u201d asked Jubilee.\n\u2018Magneto\u2019 approached her, raising his arms, stacks of metal boxes raised them high and were thrust towards Jubilee\u2019s person, she darted left and right as they came crashing down, breaking open upon impact and revealing smaller components of metallic apparatus that, in turn, also became projectiles to throw at the hapless X-Man.\n\u201cX-Men, welcome to die\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re missing out on an \u2018you\u2019re there\u2019 Mags, not only are you a jerk even in this game, you\u2019re one major illiterate\u201d Jubilee remarked.\nObserving the action from his auditorium, Mojo turned to his comms and rattled censored obscenities in the ears of Spiral seated at the controls.\n\u201cI thought you sorted out those glitches during the last few beta runs\u201d Mojo yelled.\n\u201cSomeone within the system must have saved a few and are grafting them onto the existing patch\u201d Spiral said in an attempt to explain, something Mojo picked up on.\n\u201cListen to yourself; you\u2019re somehow trying to convince me that this was somehow somebody else\u2019s fault?\u201d\nSpiral muttered a few choice phrases of her own as Mojo berated her.\nMojo sulked, but only for a moment, he would not let the crushing reality of bad patching get in the way of his grand presentation.\n\u201cJust fix it, that little jubilant punk\u2019s bound to start playing the game any minute now, and when she comes to rise, oh what a fall she\u2019ll have when we trip her up. This game has to be perfect...we must preserve her every memory, her ideal vision of her world....were we to ever veer away from it, then just what would the point of nostalgia be?

Together as a race.\nBut Jean caught herself thinking a great deal about Kurt\u2019s connection to Rogue, and how grief had brought them together in a masterful way. She recognised something in Rogue\u2019s instincts on that fateful day, something that centred her.\nSomething she had been missing since losing Remy.\n\u201cKurt....I saw what you did for Rogue in Mexico, she relied on your strength all so readily, yet you haven\u2019t been in touch all that long, I didn\u2019t mean to pry, but...that felt more like she was yearning, not reaching. Whatever it was she was looking for, I could empathically tell it wasn\u2019t solace\u201d\n\u201cThe brightest eyes see things clearer than the path of day within the grace of the sun. Even when the weather isn\u2019t as fair, there is no rain\u201d\nKurt gazed upon Rogue\u2019s comatose body, he gently stroked her warm southern hair, and delicately ran his finger down the side of her cheek as a small tear escaped its duct and gingerly ran down her face, a sign she was attempting to stir herself back to consciousness.\n\u201cNo rain at all\u201d\n\u201cIs it more comforting to lie?\u201d Jean asked.\n\u201cDoes Rogue hurt?\u201d Kurt asked, sidestepping the question asked to him.\n\u201cI can hear her thoughts, they are centred on Remy, Erick...Cody.....and...you. You\u2019re in the most esteemed company\u201d Jean remarked.\n\u201cBut does she hurt?\u201d Kurt insisted.\n\u201cNo...no, these thoughts are of healing\u201d Jean explained, \u201cIt goes back to what you said, she helped them live, before and after they gave a piece of themselves to her, she\u2019s relying on their love for her, their strengths, even their weaknesses bring her humility, humbling, allowing her mind a state of grace\u201d\n\u201cEven with all the faith I have for her, all the understanding for her love, I fear this form of healing is one for the mind, not the heart. She is sharply tooling herself. Experiences of squandered potential with Remy, guilt with Cody, shame with Carol...all combustible elements, she is sharply tooling herself into a weapon. She will soon be blessed with purpose. Built...for war\u201d\n\u201cNot a cloud in the sky and it\u2019s as if we know the storm is coming. I\u2019m sorry Kurt, I\u2019d try my best to help but if I were to give her a nudge in the opposite direction, I don\u2019t know if I could understand the choice I made tomorrow\u201d a saddened Jean replied.\n\u201cIt is not up to us to control who we love, all we are required to do is understand it\u201d Kurt said, draping the bed sheets neatly over Rogue\u2019s shoulders, blowing her a kiss.\n\u201cWhat do you understand about this?\u201d Jean asked.\n\u201cThat even within the grace of the sun, there is always fire\u201d",

He slicked his hair back, and in doing so, Hailey\u2019s world went into slow motion meltdown.\nMeanwhile, back in the real world, for all of this was playing out in Hailey's head, Scott was frantically snapping his fingers directly in front of his best friend, and getting no response. He took her glasses off and continued the action.\n\u201cHas she moved yet?\u201d  Beta asked.\n\u201cNot even a blink...she\u2019s totally shut down. Beta...be honest with me...has she been a robot this whole time?\u201d\n\u201cOh for crying out loud...\u201d Beta remarked, and kicked Hailey at the back of her heel to snap her out of her hypnotic glare.\nWith a spring in her step, Hailey threw herself into Scott\u2019s arms and sweetly whispered something important in his ear.\n\"It happens today\"\n\"What happens?\" Scott asked\nHailey's answer was but one word, and the promise of an eternal memory.\nJust one word.\nNo plan.\nNo pressure.\nIt just felt right.\n\u201cTomorrow\u201d\nStroking his face tenderly, she sealed her promise with the kiss of a lifetime.",

All of time, space, and adventure. His infinite calling.\nAnd as he took a moment to pause, the tears came flooding down once again.\nSurely they should have stopped by now. Evil had been averted. Chaos prevented, an empire had been reduced to ash and ruin, he had brought death to its own door, and life had prevailed.\nThe tears had plagued him for as long as he had been encountering the many splinters of Susan Triad, or felt the cold and sensitive touch of a snowflake brought about by a lively Ruby. Just why had he been in a highly emotional state?\nHe allowed himself the pause to reflect on what he believed to be the case, and what he believed in could not be entertained further, not if he wished to continue traversing creation and righting wrongs wherever he was needed.\nBut that was just it, everything he had been told to believe in all of his lives had proven to be misdirects and manipulations, and now the one thing he wasn\u2019t certain about was the intent of his ship.\nIt also tied back to what he had told Ruby when they first travelled together, that he had no job, no responsibility, that he had freedom, and yet, he had come to find the TARDIS had none, that it was at the beck and call, the manipulations and machinations, of another greater, stronger force that had bent it to its almighty will.\nHis mind drifted back to the days of the Eleventh, the encounter with the dark entity known as House, a predator of Time Lords, and his strange family, one of whom became the host body for what he believed to be the very essence of the TARDIS itself.\nIt had told him that she never took him to where he wanted to be, but where he was needed.\nMy god\n, thought The Doctor,\nWas that a warning? Or a lie? A trick? Or perhaps a means of conveying what was required of me along? To serve as a means by which to assert dominance and death across the fabric of the universe?\nWhat does he believe now?\nThe choice brought him to tears.\nFor the sake of preserving sanity in the universe, to bring comfort to civilisations, and joy to the world, he could not afford to invite any signs of doubt to intrude upon him, for doubt would bring disaster, and too many had seen that from him, and too many hearts had been broken trying to shield them from it too.\nJust ask Susan.\nThe Doctor fought back the tears, he wondered if they would persist for as long as he was faced with this choice, perhaps it didn\u2019t matter any longer, perhaps it did, it wasn\u2019t just about him, but the soul of his chariot, pulled now by a force it could call its own, but The Doctor could tell it would be pained by each step it took onto a new world, perhaps it would malfunction more, perhaps it would be disloyal through more fault of its own.\nOr perhaps it would try to do better.\nFor The Doctor\u2019s sake, he would have to take its word for it\nBut who\u2019s word?\nThe word of Idris?\nOr the word of Sutekh?",

She was surprised to find Logan standing in the way of the door leading outside.\n\"What is it you want Logan?\" Jean said.\n\"You don't have to go Jean\" Logan replied.\n\"Didn't Hank's tests make it clear as crystal what I am?\" Jean asked.\n\"Nothing's been more clearer to me, regardless of where you came from, you still belong\"\n\"I'm a danger. To you, and all the others. You saw what Sinister did to me\" Jean replied.\nLogan walked over to her, stroking her lush red hair.\n\"...And we saw what you did when you came out of your funk. He may have cloned your body, but he couldn't corrupt your soul.

After all this, it won't be easy for her\" Logan argued.\n\"That's why you need to take care of her Logan, take care of both of them. They 're lost, damaged...\"\n\"So am I, but we're all big boys, we'll get better\" Logan bragged\nJean stroked his rugged, stony face gently.\n\"Oh Logan, we all know you can't heal that fast\"\n\"...Jean...\"\n\"No, not Jean, not anymore, call me...Madelyn. Madelyn Pryor\"\n\"Why that name?\" Logan asked.\n\"...Because 'Prior' to the future, there was the past, and it's one I'm proud to have had, I'll cherish it always, my time with you, the X-Men, Scott, with Nathan. But nothing moves forward without leaving something behind. This is my right of way Logan, and right now, you're in the way\"\nLogan sighed and stood aside, allowing Madelyn to open the door and step outside into the starlit sky.\n\"Will we see you again?\" Logan asked.\n\"If you seek out a storm, you're bound to get a forecast\" Madelyn replied, and winked at him before heading towards the gates.\n\"She going to try and find Ororo?\" asked Jubilee as Logan closed the front door.\n\"Sisters seem real happy doing this for themselves\" Logan remarked",

What\u2019s the significance of it?\u201d Rogue asked.\n\u201cThere is an intelligence on this planet that is trying to kill me across all of time and space, I couldn\u2019t stop it, but a friend of mine did, her name was Clara Oswald, and there is a good possibility an echo of her exists here, in this century, on these very grounds, on the patch of green we walked across on route to your ship, she is out there, fighting for every breath you make and every step you, and I, take\u201d\n\u201cAnd seeing one of your faces convinces you of all that?\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious Rogue? I wear that face, it isn\u2019t just appearing there to mark what will become of me, it is what I become. I become that intelligence, a being of sheer indomitable will, the ability to control and kill whenever and however I please. My people, lords one and all, spoke once of ascending beyond all demand for physical presence in the universe, they wished to bring about the end of linear time and become free of cause and effect. What if I achieve it? My god Rogue...what if that is my calling? It was said I would have many names before the end...beast, storm, Valeyard...and now...Intelligence\u201d\nRogue walked up to The Doctor and gently placed his hand on his.\n\u201cYou have an illness; your friend sounds like a good reliever of it\u201d\n\u201cSome illnesses you can\u2019t cure\u201d The Doctor admitted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to tow the line between present and future without a little bit of knowledge, but if you know yourself, then you know how to shape that future into something better to come\"\n\u201c\u201cI\u2019m a devil in scarlet and black, what would I know?\u201d The Doctor asked.\nRogue smiled and played another bopping track across the com speakers.\n\u2018\u2019Say you won't leave me no more\nI'll take you back again\nNo more excuses, no, no\n'Cause I've heard them all before\nA hundred times or more\nI'll forgive and forget\nIf you say you'll never go\n'Cause it's true what they say\nIt's better the devil you know (better the devil)\n(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)\u2019\u2019\nAnd just like that, The Doctor\u2019s spirits suddenly rose.",

Right around the time he had, with confidence, claimed that the hierarchy of power was due to change in the DC Cinematic universe.\nPlans, of course, have a tendency to pivot and change just when the world is due a vision.\nSomething changes in the weather, the mood, the taste, is decided for the consumer, he had to believe that, it couldn\u2019t be because the people decided against it. It couldn\u2019t be because the people lacked taste, lacked common sense, and lacked any kind of vision.\nHe was a man of the people, the people\u2019s champion, ordained by those who lived through life with an attitude.\nWhat Dwayne felt was unwavering entropy enveloping all his sound and fury, signifying nothing.\nDwayne believed truly everything he did, moments, matches, mattered to the people. He refused to consider the idea the fans had decided what he was willing to share with them was of little substance, and of lesser significance.\nHis bloodline was being denied, his family was being denied. By the\npeople\n.\nThis man, Cody Rhodes, was their champion.\nDwayne had been bestowed the title of peoples champion by the house of Ali, solidified in a belt that he carried around his shoulders and around his waist.\nHe was in touch with the common man, the fan, the mood of the public. He had to be, it was why this new era of professional wrestling had taken off, he had sensed the change in the weather, and had pivoted.\nBut he done so only because he thought the night would be an easy win, for there was no challenge here, no herculean task. He had defeated Cody and company rather comfortably on night one, with minimal effort on his part.\nBut, perhaps that was the problem, whatever issue, it lay in the roots of his bloodline, his family.\nRoman had done what he could for him one night, but had failed him completely on another.\nFrom Gorilla position he had watched Roman put more effort into braggadocios behaviour, mocking Cody, putting aside weapons when the rules commanded their use, and delaying his responses far too much when pushed to seal the fate of his enemies.\nAs Cody celebrated with his friends, several plans of retribution formed in Dwayne's mind.\nHe would think back to the days when Cody\u2019s father Dusty was revered as more chaser than champion, and the reasons for why this was so.\nHe thought to more recent times, of how Daniel Bryan was challenged by the Authority. Overturning of decisions, title vacancies, indecisive refereeing, in-match turmoil. There could be so many games to play with the Rhodes to come.\nBut the glory would not go back to Roman. No, he needed to be made an example of. His own inability to set aside the spark that lit his fuse in Seth Rollins had extinguished the greatest title run of the early half of the 21st century, a return to gold would not undo such a blemish\nThe hierarchy of power had to change, there must be a new seat at the table.\nA phone call would be made, meetings would be arranged, and Jacob Fatu would soon join him.\nAnd soon new blood would be called upon to run through the line.\nFaster, stronger, bigger, better.\nThey would challenge the new normal, they would rise, they would conquer.\nAnd it would be all for the sake of the fans, for Dwayne knew them best.\nHe was of the people, by the people, and forever for the people.",

These had been days of very real accomplishment, for both him and his wife.\nAnd today both had earned their reward.\nPeter\u2019s eyes slid open; the reruns were at an end.\nAnd the first face he saw was Mary Janes\u2019, her lush bright eyes staring into his, blinking in synch, she gently graced his forehead with a gentle kiss.\n\u201cYou sure can sleep Tiger. I was afraid they\u2019d soon be ready to take off again with us still on board\u201d\n\u201cAre we here Tigress?\u201d Peter asked.\n\u201cTake a look and see\u201d Mary Jane replied, inviting Peter to stare out of the plane windows.\nPeter did so, and his smile only grew bigger.\nHere they were, in the land down under, the plane had touched down in Sydney, Australia.\n\u201cI\u2019m curious Tiger; just what was it you were dreaming about?\u201d MJ asked.\n\u201cJust the Adventures we\u2019ve had, before the adventures to come\u201d Peter replied.\nMJ grabbed his hand and hoisted him up, arm in arm; they disembarked from the plane into the white-hot heat of the outback.\nPeter stared lovingly at MJ, and as he remembered just whose earnings had punched the ticket for this occasion, that sense of accomplishment was elevated by another wholesome sensation that gripped him.\nPride.\nHe was so proud of what MJ's work ethic had brought to their world, it rivalled the pride she herself felt being married to a streetwise superhero.\nBoth were one another\u2019s heroes, both had achieved their dreams.\nNone of those dreams had ever been that small, but they had taught themselves that they could be pursued and achieved.\nThis had not been their first dream, their first vacation, but it still felt altogether different compared to all that had come before them. This felt like the beginning of an unwritten chapter.\nThis felt like the future.\n\u201cMJ...do you think, we should stay here?\u201d Peter asked as he and MJ\u2019s feet touched the smooth hard slabs of the airport tarmac, solidifying their arrival.\n\u201cHere? For real? Not just for a few days?\u201d\n\u201cI fancy labelling myself the \u2018Outback Arachnid\u2019, does it sound good to you?\u201d\n\u201cYou could make a fortune coming up with Marvella movie titles Tiger\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to gauge just how popular your alter-ego is around these parts\u201d\nAn enthusiastic girl, an influence on social media, suddenly ran up to both of them, asking for an autograph.\n\u201cOh my gosh, you\u2019re Mary Jane Parker and her husband, we\u2019ve been following all your BTS on Marvella 2, can you believe the Horner\u2019s want to write that film off for tax? You can\u2019t let them do that to us, you\u2019re huge over here\u201d\nMJ obliged the girl and gave her a signed autograph.\n\u201cAnd before you ask, I\u2019ll be sure to like and subscribe\u201d MJ joked.\nPeter and MJ looked at one another, raising their eyebrows and smirking.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll be just fine Petey\u201d\n\u201cThen it\u2019s settled. You and me? Here for keeps?\u201d\n\u201cOne day at a time Tiger\u201d MJ cautioned, not wanting Peter\u2019s enthusiasm to run too far away with him.\nPeter shrugged, and hoisted her high in the air, twirling.\n\u201cLady, our daily routine is the simplest way to travel\"",

Then, when it became apparent who was in the room with her, she threw them down, revealing that she wasn\u2019t wearing anything.\n\u201cHey\u201d she said, switching on the night lamp to get a good look at her best friend.

How do you give me so much to live for?\u201d\n\u201cSimplest answer spaceman, by living, now kiss me\u201d\nThe Doctor pressed his lips to hers, and both folded themselves far beneath the sheets, eager to demonstrate how alive they truly were.\nDonna was so lucky to have this face back, this form, yet it did cause her to drift a little in their lovemaking, driving her to a momentary distraction.\n\u201cJust occurred to me...if the bi-regeneration gave new life to all your previous selves, and this body is a retread, a copy...that means there exists in the time stream....\u201d Donna began; The Doctor pressed his finger to her lips\n\u201cYeah, even more of me\u201d he replied, pointing to his face.\nAs she relaxed and let him inside of her, Donna knew she would dream of nothing else afterwards.",
